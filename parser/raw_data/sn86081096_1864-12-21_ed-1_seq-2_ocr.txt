RESULTS OF THE WAR.
The war continues. Since the last an
jiunl message, ail the important lines and
positions then occupied by our forces
Lave peen maintained, and our arms have
been steadily advanced, thus liberating
the regions left in the rear; so that Miss
ouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and parts of
other Slates, have again produced reason
ably fair crops.
The most remarkable feature in the
military operations of the year is General
Sherman's attempted march of three hun
dred utiles directly through the insurgent
region. It teuds to show a great ino ease
of our relative strength thai our General
in-Chief should feel able to confront aud
hold in cheek every active force of the en
emy and yet detach a well appointed large
aruiy to move on such an expedition. The
result not yet being known, conjecture in
regard to it is uot here indulged.
Important movements have also cccur
d cjurioy; the year to the effect of mould
ing society for the durability of the Union.
Although short of complete success, it is
rnnch in the right direction that twelve
thousand citizens in each of the States
Ark ansa* and LouLiana have orgioized
local State Governments with free Consti
tutions. and are earnestly struggling to
maintain and administer them. The
movements in the same directiou more
extensive, though less definite, in Missou
ri, Kentucky, and Tennessee should not
be overlooked ; but Maryland presents
Vhe example of complete success- Mary
land is secure to liberty and Unien for
all the future. The Genius of lltbel.ion
will DO more claim Maryland. Like an
other fon! spirit, being driven out it may
seek to tear her, but it- will woe her no
more.
At the last session of Congress a pro
posed amendment to tho Constitution,
abolishing slavery throughout the United
State?, passed the Senate but failed for
want of the requisite two-thirds vote in
the House of Representatives. Although
the present is the tame Congress and
nearly the same members, and without
questioning the wisdom or patriotism of
xhoso who stood in opposition, 1 venture
io recomend the reconsideration and pas
•age of the measure at the present session.
Of course, tho abstract question is not
changed, but aa intervening election
hw? almost eertaiuly that the next Con
gress will pass the measure if this dots
not. Iluuce, thero is ouly a question of
time as to when the proposed amendment
■will goto the States lor their action, aud.
as it is to go at all events, uiay we not
agree that the sooner the better? It i>
not claimed that the election has imposed
a duty on members to change their views
$r their votes any further than as an ad
ditional element to be considered, their
judgment may be effected by it It is
the voice of the people, now lor the first
time heard, upou the question. In a great
na'ional crisis, like curs, unanimity cl
a lion among those seeking a common
end is very desirable, almost indispensable
nnd yet no appearance to mch ununi,.ii\
i? attainable unles some deference shall
bo paid to the will of the majority, simply
because it is the will of the majority.
THE PUBLIC SPIRIT.
JQ this case, tho common end is the
maintenance of the Union, and anions i
ibe inoanes to secure that end, s ch vril!, |
through the election is most clearly de
elared in favor of such a constitutional
amendment* The most reliable indica
tions of public purpose in this country is
fltr ved through our popular t lections
Judging by the tccent canvass, ana it.-
resu : t, the purpose of the people, within
t'ti loyal States, to maintain tlie infegrt
ty of tie Union was never more firm nor
more nc.irly unanimous than now. The
ixtraordinnry calmness and good order i
which the millions cf voters mingled ;
nt tlie polit gave strong nssurui.ee of thtsj
!> T ot only all tho*e who supported the
Union ticket, io called, but a great rn.-.
jority of the opposing party also may be
fairly claimed to entertain and to be actu
ated by the same purpose. It i uo-
answerable argument to this effeet that
no candidate for any othee, however high
or low. has ventured to seek v< tes on the
avowel that he fcas fir giving up the
Union.
There has been much impugning of
motives, and much heated controversy as
to the Droper rneanes and best mode of
advancing the Union cause, but on the
distinct issue of Union or no Union the
politicians have showW their instinctive
knowledge that there is no diversity
among the people. In affording to the
people the fair oppertunity of showing
one to another, and to the world this firm
ness and unanimity of purpose, the elec
tiou bas been of vast value to the nation
al cause.
NXTtOKAL EESOtBCE3
The election has exhibited another fact not
less valuable to be known—the fact that we
do not approach exhaustion in the most im
portant branch of national resources—that oi
living men. While it is melancholy to reflect
that the war has made so many graves and
carried mourning to io many hearths, it is
souis relief to know that, compared wi'h the
surviving, the fallen have been so few. While
corps, and divisions and brigades, and regi
ments have been formed, and fought, un.l
dwindled, find gone out of existence, a great
majority of the men who composed them aire
still living. The same is true of the naval
service. The election returns prove this. So
many voters could not else be found. The
States regularly holding election, both now
and four years ago, to wit: California, Con
necticut. Illinois, Indiana, lowa, Kentucky.
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey. New York.
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, cast
; 3,982,011 votes now, against 3,870,222 cast
i then, showing at. aggregate nriv of 3,082,011
[To this is to be added 23.782 cast now in the
'new States that did U"t vote in 1800. thus
i swelling the aggregate to 4.015 G73, and the
I net increase during the three years and a
! half of war to 115.531. A table is appended
, siiow'ng particulars To this again should he
! added the number of so!di*rs in the held from
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey,
Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, and California,
who, by the laws of those States, could not
vote away from their homes, aad which num
ber caunut be less than 90,000. Nor yet is
this all. The number in the organized Ter
ritories is a trifle now to what it was loin
years ago, while thousands white and black,
join us as the national arms press back the
1 insurgent lines.
ISO much is shown affirmatively and nega
tively by the election. It is not material to
inquire how the increase has been produced,
or to show that it would have been greatei
but for the war, which is probably true. The
impoitaut fact remains demonstrated that we
have more men now than we had wheu the
war began, that wo are not exhausted, nor in
the process of exhaustion, that we are gaining
i strength, and may, if need be, maintain tin
j contest indelinitelv. This, as tinmen. Mate
j rial resources are now more complete and
! abundant than ever.
i TUB MAINTENANCE OF THE UNION —CONDITIONS
OF rhIACE.
j The national resources then are unexhaust
' ed, and, as we believe, inexhaustible. The
public purpose to establ.sb and maintain t ie
m ianal authority is unchanged, and, as we
believe, uuchangible The manner ot con
i iinuing the ellbrt remains to choose. Ou
careful consideration of all Li. e evidenca ac
cessible, it seems to nie that no attempt at
| negotiation with the insurgent leader could
result in any good. lie would accept noth
ing short of a severance of the Union, pre
cisely what we will not and cannot give.—
li;s declarations to this effect an explicit
I and olt-repeated. lie does not attempt to
deceive us. ile aftoids us no excuse to de
' ceive ourselves. lie cannot voluntarily re

i distinct, simple and inflexible. It is an issue
1 which cau ouiy be tried by war and dcided
jby victory. If we yield we arc beaten. 1.
! the Southern people fail him he is beuten. —
! Either way it would he the victory and de
| feat following war.- What is true, however,
| of him who heads the insurgent cause, is not
i necessan'y true of those who follow. Al-
I though he cannot re-aceept Die Union, they
! can. Some of them, we know, already dc
; sire peace aud leuuion. The uumber of such
| may increase. Tliey can at any moment have
j peace, simply by laving down their arms and
' submitting to the uat.onnl authority under
i the Constitution. After so much tiie Gov
| eminent could not, if it would, maintain war
| igainst them. The loyal people would not
i sustain or allow it. If questions should re
matr, we would adjust them by the peaceful
I means of legislation, conferences, courts, and
| votes operating only in constitutional and
! lawful channels. Some certain and other
' possible questions are and would lie beyond
I the Executive power to adjust, as. for instance,
; the admission of members into Congress, and
' whatever might require the appropriation ot
1 money. The Executive power itself would be
I greatly diminished by the cessation of actual
: war. Pardons and remission of forfeitures,
j however, would sdll lm within the Executive
i control. In what spirit and temper this con
| ;rol would be exercised cm be judged of b\
i the past. A year ago a general pardon and
amnesty, upon specified terms, were offered
to all except certain designated classes, and
it was at the same time made known that the
excepted classes were stili within contempla
tion of special clemency. During the year
many availed themselves of the general pro
vision, and many more would, only that the
signs of bad faith in sciua led to such pre
cautionary me >sures us rendered the practi-
I cnl process less easy and certain. During the
-nine time. ai:o, special pardons have been
gr in'ed to individuals of t'-e excepted classes,
md r.o voluntary apphcaii >u has bemi denied.
Thus, practically, the door lias been for a full
year open to all. except such j.s were not in
condition to make nee <■' ice—that is, such
as were in custody or under constraint. 11 is
still so Open to all. But the time may come
when public duty shall demand that it be

December C, 1864.
Washington Correspondence.
WASHINGTON, D C , Dec 8. 15G4
The present week has been marked by
the com of what promises to
be a very important session of Cungress.
Among the measures looked for are some
needed amendments to the Internal
Revenue Law, and an amendment to the
Constitution prohibiting human slavery
forever in the United States.
The appointment of the Hon. S. P.
Chase, to till the vacancy on the Sup r eme
Bench, caused by the dcith of Justice
Taney, has been hailed lv the radical,
reliable men.with unbounded satisfaction
lion. James Speed, ot Kentucky, has
becu nomiuated by the President 'o fill
ihe vacancy caused by tlie resrgnatiou of
Attorney General Bates. The Senate
had cot acted upon the name up tc the
time of its adjournment over Monday,
but it is supposed the failure to act indi
cates no opposition to that gentleman.
A bill to prevent the payment of gold,
silver or bullion for more than its current
value as niatked on the coin, and to pre
vent the payment or acceptance of the
lawful currency of the United States fur
less than its curient value, was on Tues
day offered by Mr. Stevct s, and relerred
to its proper committee. \e*terday Mr
Blaine (of Maine) called up the bill lie
-aid, "During the twenty four hour
-ince this b:!l was introduced, much
iiii-chief has been done, and every day
aud hour the House stands committed 'o
it, still greater mischief will result. It
indicated three states of this Union, and
made every man guilty of a misdemeanor,;
and every clause attempted to commit the
liuuse to impossibilities. Gold rose yes
terday I'd per cent, for the very reason ot
ilie introduction of this extraordinary
b 11. * lie moved a reconsideration of,
the vote of reference with a view of
moving to lay the bill on the table.
Mr. Cox (of Ohio) said he did not
agree with the gentleman that this bill
was the means of putting up the price of,
gold. lie rather* thought die President j
had played 'the bull" by his Message..
An or svmo further remarks the bill was;
laid upon the table.
The particular part of that remarkable
document, the President's Message,!
which 1 suppose to be particularly ob
noxious to the copperhead faction of
whieh this "gentleman from Ohio" is a
••representative mar:," is the last para
graph in Mr. Lincoln's "peace proclama
tion." Xotwithsiai ding the large popular
majorities iu favor oi carrying on the
war, these gentlemen wero looking, so it
j seems, lor some "ove; tares" froth the
Kxccuttvc. and here they are. I quote
from the Message :
Tn stating a stuglc condition of peace
f mean to say that the war will cea.-e ou
, ihe part of the Government whenever it
| shall have ceased on the part of those
who began it."
That is peace doctrine, so plain and
simple that a child might understand it.
rite meaning is clear. It means just
j what the people of the South will have
; u mean. It may mean honorable restor
ation to former lights under a free gov
; enimeui, cleared of the incubus of slavery
peace, prospeiiiy. and all tlicit attend
: ami b!es>i"gs—if they so will it; or it
uiav mean subjugation, and peace through
I exnaustioii. it means '"peace" at aii
events, and lasting peace, but uot the
; peace these democratic gentlemen want.
; Peace, without Slavery to quarrel about,
j :iud without lite Democratic patty in
power, is the very condition of all other.-
|ihey stand in dread of. They would
ptclcr eternal war; but they cannot have
: it. They can find a little Lull uow ami
than, can give the Administration much
trouble if I hey choose, and even give gold
an occasional upward tendency, but the
• final result they cannot change. The
only good result likely to come from their
i bickerings is the hopeless buiiul of theui
i selves in the debris of the labrtc they
have reared, when it falls.
In the way of amusements we have the
Lcmau Opeia at "Grovers," and Miss
! Maggie Mitchell's play of •• Fanehon" at
I*• l'uiJ>." Congress having arrived the
I "gay season'' is faitty inaugurated.—
j Theatrical managers aud llutil keepers
I are 'making hay while the suu shines."'
Cotisideiable amusement has also been
aftoidvd by the sending of a delegation

Cxchangc) to urge the name of Col
Forney as the candidate of Pennsjlvania,

TIIE GRAKD CAMPAIGN.
Victories from every poiutof the com
pass —nothing but victories this glorious
morning From Tcuessee, from Georgia,
from Mississippi, from Virginia—frout all
quarters where the brave soldiers of the
Union arc defending the Flag of the Re
public, laureled Victory sits upon their
hWurds and smooth succes is strewed be
fore their feet. Thomas has bceten Hood
the besieged defeating the besieger ;
Sherman has taken Fort McAllister, and
brushed from his path toe last vbs'acle
between hiin aod the sea ; Canby in
Mississippi lias fallen on the communica
tions of the llebel army that threatened
Nashville, and has destroyed them; Stone
man and Burbridge in West Viigioiu
have struck the rear of Breckinridge, and
, have cut off atonce his line of subply and
his line of retreat. From one end of the
| line to the other, it is a whirlwind of vic
; tories!
Fort McAllister will be.remembered as
the formidable earthwork that last veai ;
defied the efforts of the monitors We
hawken and Passaic. Originally built toj
uuard the passage to Savannah Iroiu the
-ea, it guaided equally in this emergency
the approach of Sherman to the fleet
which brought him reinforcements and
supplies. It was the one defence which
protected Ossabaw Sound ) the point we
have indicated as the probable end of
Sherman's inarch ; and upon this prized
-afegnard of gavaunah Sherman lias fall
en with the suddeness and force of a
thunderbolt, and has carried it by an ir
ijpMstible coup He mail. It is otic of
tiu keys to Savannah, which the genius
and courage of Sherman have made to
unlock —instead of closing the avenues
to that stronghold of the Rebels We
have meanwhile, a report bv way of Ann
apolis that Savannah itself is fallen ; but
whether that be true or not it is at. least
clear that Sherman lias simultaneously in
vested that city and cut its northern com
munications. The junction uf Geo. How
ard, who commands the riijht wing of
|Gen gherinau's army, with Gen. Foster,
who Iras severed the Charleston arid Sa
vannah Railroad at Pucotaligo, completes
the insulation of the ei y of Savannah,
and so clearly foreshadows the fate of this
1 commercial capital of Georgia that it is
: scarcely important to consider whether
: the Annapolis report of the capture be
true in fact or be only an anticipation of
the fact. We do at all events know that
: Gen. Sherman is absolute master of the
! situation tn Georgia.
The dispatches from Gen, Thomas at
Nashville aie of the same joyous tenor a<
those which from Gen. Sherman thrill
the country with anticipations of complete
andtioal victoryovcr the llebelioo. Abon
douiug the defensive, Gen. Thomas has
resorted at last to the strategy of attack ;
penetrating at the right moment the fatal
mistake of Hood in converting a cam
paign, which was stategically offensive,
into a tactical defensive. The elaborate
earthworks of the llebel commander,
which were meant to environ Nashville,
have failed even to protect him against
the retributive onslaught of the force he
supposed himself to have shut up in a
garrisoned chy. The batt!' of Thursday
was the vindication of Thomas's halting
and retreating conduct of the campaign
which lie now crowns with triumph un
dor the walls of the city which he chose
to defend in accordance with his well
known \iews of prudent and secure war
fare. The dispatches show that Thomas,
having been reinforced and deeming him
self strong euough to resume ouce mere
the offensive, assaulted on Thursday, the
intrciiclinieuts of liocd, carried them,
drove the llebels eight miles toward
Franklin, and effectively and linailv lais
ed what has been called the seige of Nash
ville. Hood lost seventeen guns and many
prisoners; lust the initiative of lire cam
paign; lost his chance of success in Tenn
essee ; lost even his security of retreat
into Alabama; and dependent upon
chance for a temporary and unsure retire
ment on the line of his advance.
Add to all this the occupation by the
forces of Gen. Canby of Hood's line of
supply and base at Jackson, Miss , and
where vanishes the hopeofthe llebel lead
er ? lie lias none remaining but in im
mediate and precipitate flight, aud not
much even in that.
The same tale falls on Breckinridge in
Bast Tennessee, lie shares the ill luck
of his superior, fur his sole railway line
into West Virginia is gone and the very
existence of his army is put iu peril. So
from one end to the other of the military
field wane the fortunes of the Rebellion,
and wax with unexpected rapidety of
increase the fortunes of the Republic.
Gen Sherman announce?,under liis own
signature, his arrival on the coa-t. r J"lie
capture ot' Fort McAllister, on the loth,
completes his communication wi h the
tinet. Previously to that he had destroy
ed all the railroads and invested the city
His march was "agreeable," the weather
tine, supplies abundant. It is remarka
ble that we hear nothing of these astoun
ding ravages which the llcbcl Gen.
Wheeler has all along been reported by
the Richmond papers to have made on
Sherman's forces. Rut Gen. Sherman
says he has not been "at .all molested
by guerrillas." Not a wagon lost on
the trip. lie has u'teriy destroyed over
two hundred miles of rail". And he "re
gards Savannah as already gained." Noth
ing could be more perfect than the whole
conduct ot this expedition, as nothing
wili be more glorious than its final result.
From Gen. Thomas we - continue to
receive accounts of the enemy's defeat
and flight. Our forces were eight iniles
beyoud Franklin —twenty six south of
Nashville —on Saturday ; continually cap
turing prisoners, trophies, and guns. —
liest of all, Gen. Thomas announces
his putpose tn keep on, and evidently
means to clear Tennessee of Rebels before
he stops. Hood has but two hues of re
treat ; one to Florence, Ala ; the other to
Coiinth, Miss.

State Normal School.
BROOKIAND, Pa., Dec. 8, 18G4.
When the sehool system of our State
becomes more fully understood, it will be
better appreciated.
If a scholar goes through the course
prescribed in common or District schools
and then through the course pursued in
our Normal schools he is fitted for nearly
any station in life, and if he desires to
follow any profession he is amply prepared
for the particular course ot study required.
We have m>w in our State three State
Normal Schools. These institutions,
where such buildings have been made
by tlie citizens as have been pronounced
by the Examining Committee, suitable,
as required bv Ihe law on the subject,
and to each of which, the Legislature ha 3
appropriated 810.000.
One is at Miliersvilie,Lancaster county,
under the care of Professor Wichersha.ll
as Principal ; one is at Edinboro', Erie
county, of which J. A. Cooper is Princi
pal ; and the third and youngest is at
Mansfield, Tioga county, and. has been
fur oue term and ii now on the second,
is in charge of Professor Fordyce A.
Allen, as.-isted by Professor Strait, late
of the Edinboro School, and others.—
Doubtless allure supplied with able as
si.-tants.
At.d what is a Normal School, and
what arc its prospects?
The leading idea of the Normal School
is to prepare teachers for the common
schools. Any nnc desiiing to be a good
teacher should place himself under an
instructor that really knows how to teach,
one who has had long experience, and
thus learn more iu one or two terms, of
the art of teaching, than might be learned
in years 0/ personal expetience without
first receiving thorough practicaFtraining.
It is often said "The beginner is the
best, he will try harder." Would you
say the saute if you wanted a young and
valuable* colt trained? Would you not
rather give him in charge of the most
experienced manager of horses you could
find ? If you wanted to learn the art of
horse tamiug and training, would you go
to liarey himself, or to one n! his imitat
ors who had just commenced its practice ?
Now would you bo less wise in refer
ence to the educators of your children?
Would you uol rather trust your child
to the care of one who had been ncrfectlv
drilled in the art of teaching, than to one
who was just about to cotntnenco the
business without suelt training, and rely
ing entirely upon experiment?
Again, when oue has learned to control
mind, has learned to study and know
human nature, he is prepared to occupy
la po.-iiioti of influence in society, and is
'capable of usefulness cither iu business
pursuits or iu the professions. So that
whether one is intending to teach or not,
| a thorough Normal course is extremely
I desirable.
With regard to common school teach
ers, so great is my confidence in the
benefits of such trailing to them in their
profession that I would pay 25 to 50 per
ceut more wages (yes, more than that),
other things being equal, to the one wito
had taken a thorough course iu one of
our Normal Schools, tha n to one who had
not. I believe a great effort should be
made—inducements should be held out
by an offer of higher wages, to iuduce
teachers to attend those schools.
I aut not sure that it would not be
economy for a District to educate one or
t wo promising teachers at its own expense
upon condition that their services should
belong to the District for several years
Does any one ask which school to at
tend ? I answer: Attend the one most
convenient. Neither of these schools is
in our Normal School District, and the
choice is in favor of the one most con
venient of access, and of best teachers
and management.
"L liitd" committed an error some
months since in stating that Mansfield
wits in our Normal Oi.-irict.
In another article I will give a sketch
of a visit to the Man-field school.

WIS TAR'S BALSAM OF WILD CHERRY,
So general lias the use of this remedy be
-ome, and so popular 19 it everywhere,that it it
' unnecessary lor me to recount its virtues. Itr
works speak lor it, and find utterance in the
abundant and voluntary testimony of tho
I many who from long suffering and gettltd
disease have been restored to pristine rigor
and health. We can present a mass of evi
dence in proof of our assertion, that
CANNOT BE DISCREDITED.
The Rev. Jacob Sechler,
Well known and much respected nmong'tb*

following statement for the benefit of vbe
1 afflicted:
HANOVER, PA., Feb. 15. 1859.
Dear Sir* : —Having realized in my family
important benefits from the use of your vnlu
i able preparation— WJSTAß'S BALSAM or WILP
i CHERRY —it affords me pleasure to recommend
.it to the public. Some eight years ago one*
1 of my daughters seemed to be in a decline 4 •
! and little hopes of her recovery were enter
tained I then procured a bottle of your ex--
1 cellent Balsam, and before she had taken the
: whole of the contents of Hie bottle there wa
■ a great improvement in fier hedltli. I hare,
in my individual case, made frequent ase of
your valuable medicine, and have also been...
benefitted by it. JACOB SECIILER.
Front .Jessie Smith, Esq.,
President of the Morris County Bank, llorrii
town, New Jersey.
"Having used DR. WIS.VAR'S BALSAM or'
WILD CIIKKRY for about fifteen years, and
■ having realized its beneficial results in my
! family, it affords me great pleasure in recom
mending it to the public as a valuable remo
! dy in cases of weak lungs, colds, coughs, Ac.,
; and a remedy which I consider to be entirely
innocent, and may be taken with perfect
' safety by the most delicate in health."
From Hon. John E Smith,
A distinguished Lewyer in Westminster, MFd
I have on several occasions used DR. WI
-1 Tit's BALSAM OK WILD CHERHY for severe coldi,,
and always with decided benefit. I know of
no preparation that is more efiicacioui or
more deserving of general use.
The Balsam has also been used with ex
cellent effect by J. B. Elliott, Merchant, Hall's •
