COST OF STATE ROADS
Some Figures of Interest
to All Interested
Good Roads
in
There lias been considerable dis
cussion of the policy of state aid to
counties in roaa building, and the
question will be one of the important
ones in the next legislative session.
There has been criticism of cost, it
being claimed that roads could be
built cheaper by old methods. State
aid involves to some extent state
supervision, and that is irksome to
many. The following figures, com­
piled from the records, show the
actual cost to the county of the state
road work, and may possibly change
some opinions. They will be worth
study.

lowest. County commissioners Ole
Wahl and F. H. Lakin were at that
place the first part of the week to let
the contract, which calls for a steel

HAS NARROW ESCAPE
Former Little Falls Banker
Saved from Watery
Crave by Son
H. A. Warner, founder of the local
Merchants State Bank, and for several
yeais a resident of this city, had a
narrow escape from drowning while
ice-boating on White Bear lake last
Saturday, being saved only by the
heroic efforts of his son, Allyn, aged
17 years. Mr. Warner is. a brother of
Mrs. C. H. Brown and Miss Lucy
Warner of this city, and with his
family visited here Thanksgiving day
with his sisters. All will admire the
bavery of the youth, who. after saving
himself from a watery grave, re­
mained to save his father. The St.
Paul Dispatch has the following
story of the accident:
Ice-boating on White Bear laep was
the cause of two accidents Saturday
and Sunday last, one of which. at
least, came within a hair-breath of
being a fatality. H. A. Warner,
banker, of White Bear, lies ill in bed
but happy that he is alive to tell the
story of his rescue by his gallant son.
Father and son were out ice-boating
on the lake Saturday when a sudden
saual drove the ice boat, tilted up
on one skate, into the open water off
the point of Manitou Island. The
momentum was such that the men
were separated from the ooat, and had
to swim for it. Allyn Warner, 17
years old, suceeding in lifting himself
on the ice but Mr. Warner could not
find a piece of ice firm enough to bear
his weight.
Mr. Warner called to his son:
"Allyn, there's no use of both us
dying, get away from the anger spot.
Allyn was not built that way.
Finding he could not grasp his
father's hand without exterme
danger he took off his overcoat and
threw the end to the struggling man.
As soon as the weight of the elder
man was hauled up on the edgeot the
ice it gave way Four attempts, with
his father's life at stake, did young
Warner make and four times the ice
foiled his efforts.
The fifth time, however, they had
reached a part of the ice field that was
firmer and he was able to haul his
father over the cracking ice till he
reached firm ice.
Father and son. shivering with cold,
but full of gratitude for their deliver­
ance, walked two miles over the ice to
the home of Casper Bloom, where the
usual restoratives in such cases were
used. The two were taken to Mr.
Warner's home at White Bear. Dr.
Francis, coroner at White Bear, at­
tended the two all day Sunday and
today they are both able to be up.
"I had given up all hope of ever
trotting ottt, said Mr. Warner.
ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION CON­
CERT AND DANCE A SUCCESS.
Both the concert and dance given
by the Little Falls Athletic associa­
tion last night were well attended.
The music furnished by the Ainsworth
orchestia was of the beet, and both the
concert and dance was highly ap­
preciated. The success of the occasion
is due largely to the untiring efforts
of the different committees that were
appointed to look after the affair.
Considering that there was a recital
going on that evening, the association
can pride itself on the outcome.
MAY WRESTLE AT LITTLE

Munsey at Workman hall Saturday
night The men wrestled 30 minutes
when Heine got a hammerlock on the
local man and came down with his
knee between the latter's shoulder
and cracked his collar bone. It is
likely that the men will come together
again at Little Falls later on.

THE LATE T. F. MURPHY.
Wadena Pioneer Journal: Many of
our readers will be pained to. note the
death of Mr. T. F. Murphy, which
occurred Sunday afternoon at his
home in Little Falls, following an
illness of a month. Some complica­
tions of tne heart became apparent the
last few days of his illness, and those
affections caused his death. Mr.
Muiphy waB but 44 years of age, and
until a few years ago was one of the
best known and most popular of com­
mercial men who visited this section.
In 1904 Mr. Murphy located at St.
Cloud, he being the general agent of
the Deering Harvester company. By
reason of his woik he traveled most
of the time, and everyone up this
way. almost, knew and highly
esteemed the ruddy, cheery and witty
Irishman. Soon after the Interna­
tional Harvester company absorbed all
the farm machinery companies, Mr.
Murphy quit his position, going to
Little Falls, where be formed a
partnership and conducted with great
success, a retail farm machinery and
hardware establishment,
spared he would have made a notable
record in the business world of this
section of the state, for he studied all
matters pertaining to his business
-with thoroughness and enterprise, and
put into succeessful application many
modern methods. His young wife
and three children have indeed
sustained a most irreparalbe loss, and
the Pioneer Journal, in company with
a host of friends, most sincerely
regrets his untimely death, and, ex­
tends to the bereaved ones, much
sympathy.
SLIGHT CHANGE IN TIME TABLE.
A slight change was made in the
time table of the Northern Pacific at
this point Sunday morning, which it
is thought will make it easier to
handle the local passenger traffic. This
affects only No. 5, the westbound
coast train, and No. 106, the branch
train from Morris. By this change
the first named will arrive here at 2:08
a. m., six minutes earlier, and the
latter at 10:35 a. m., ten minutes
earlier.

CITY COUNCIL MEETS
Says Cass County Should
Pay Expenses Incurred
for us Williamson
The regular monthly meeting of the
city council was held Monday evening
at the city hall, all members, with the
exception of Aldermen Dewey 'and
Germain, being present.
Chief of Police Gannon appeared
before the council at this meeting and
asked what should be done in regard
to Chernikowski Bros. It seems that
this concern, which deals in furs of
all kinds, and which is located on
Broadway east, has been in the habit
of storing its fur and hides in a barn
just back of its place of business, some
of which created a very nauseous smell
about the neighboring places of busi­
ness. A member of tbe firm was
asked to store a particular brand of
tionable. in some other place, but the
chief said that the concern would not
accede to this. The council instructed
the chief to prevent the furriers from
storing the hides that threw off such
an oder at that place.
The case of Gus. Williamson was
then brought to the attention of the
council. This is the man who was
hurt so badly in an accident some
time ago and who- has been receiving
treatment at the local hospital. Late­
ly he has become totally blind as the
result of the accident. It has since
come to light that the man made his
home in Cass county, and it was
thought that that county should stand
for the expenses incurred by this city
for the man. and that it should take
care of him. The city attorney re­
ported that he had investigated the
case and that the man claimed he had
a brother in some unknown part of
Missouri, also some sisters in the old
country, but no one on whom he could
depend on for a living and that he
had been making his home in Pillager.
Cass county. The council instructed
the city clerk to send a bill to the'
Cass county authorities for the
amount paid out by the city for1
Williamson, together with a letter
asking what that county intended to
do with the man.
The report of Justice George
Gerritz, with treasurer's receipt for
$25 attached was approved, as was
also that of Justice Lud Gaudet's in
the sum of $35. The street com
missioner's payroll in the sum of
$202.37 was allowed. The council also
instructed the city clerk to buy two
nozzles for the fire depirtment. There
was some talk in regard to the pur­
chase of more hose, and it is under­
stood that this will be done as soon as
there is sufficient funds in the treasury
The matter of purchasing some
planking to replace some worn-out
planking on the Broadway bridge was
discussed, as also other matters, but
the meeting was adjourned without
any action being taken on these.
