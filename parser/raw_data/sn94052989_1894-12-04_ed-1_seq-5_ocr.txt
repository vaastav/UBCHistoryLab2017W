The Secretary of Agriculture In hi* report
reviews the operations of his depannient for
the last fiscal year and makes r< conimei.datloiis
lor the further extension of it* usefulness, He
reports a saving in expeudituies during the
year ol f 600.000, which Is covered back luto
«h<s treasury. This sum Is 23 pei ceut of the
entire appropriation.
A special study has been made of the de
mand for Ameiicau f«rm products In all
foreign markets, especially Great britaln.
That country received from the i nlted states
during the nine months ending September .JO,
1894. 306.910 live beel cattle, valued aj
126.000.000, as against 182.51 1 cattle, valued
at510.C34.000, aminß the same period of lbJ«s.
Duilug the nisi six month* of 1894 the " liei
Kingdom took also 112.000,000 pounds o
dressed beef rrom the United State?, valued at
nearly $10,000,000. Tite leport allows Ujial
during me nine mODtns immediately preceding
Sept«mbei 30, 1894, me ultedS ales exported
to Great Britain 222,676,000 pounds of pork;
pork; ofai 'pies 1,900.000, llued at §2,500.
---000; nnu ol noises 2811,-at an average value
nf *iYn its head. Tiitre was a failing off in
Amercan wueaJ exports of 13,500,000
bushels? and the Secretary is inclined lo be
lieve that wneat may not In the fuiure be the
staple exr»or« cereal pioductof our country,
but tli.it corn will continue to advance in Im
portance as an exioit on account of the new
uses to which it is coustautly bdug appro
pi la cd.
j lie exports of agricultural products from
me United States lor ihe t:-c;tl year ending
June 30. 1594. amounted to $626,363,038. be
ing 72.26 per cent of American exports of
ever description, and the United Kingdom of
Ure at Britain took more than f>4: per ceut of
all fHim products rinding foreign markets.
Tbe Depanmeut of Agriculture has under
tsKeu duiing the year two new *nd Important
lines of iese;ucb. The flrsi relates to grasses
aud forage plants, with the purpose of instruct
ing au>i familiarizing the people as to tbe dis
tinctive gra*s4 s of the United Statesand teach
ing them how lo introduce valuable foreign
forage plants which may be adapted to this
country. The second relates to agricultural
Foils Dd ctop production. Involving the
analysis of samples of soils from all sections of
Ibe American union, to demonstrate their
adaptability to particular plants and crops.
Mechanical analysis ot soils may be of such
Inestimable utility that it Is foremost iv the
new lines of Mgricultural lesearch and the
Secretary therefore rt-commeuds that a divi
sion having ii in charge be peimaueully estab
lished In the department.
The amount appropriated for the "Weather
Bureau was $951,100. Of that sum $138,500,
or 14 per cent, lias iieen saved aud Is returned
to me treasury. As Illustrating ttie usefulness
cf ibis seivice, It may be here stated that the
warnings which were very geueially given of
iwo not'icai slorniß occurring In September and
October of ihe present yeai resulted iv detain
ing safely in port 2305 vessels, valued at $38.
---283,913, laden with cargoes of probably still
greater value. What is much more unuortant
and giatifying, many human lives on these
ships were also uudoubtedly saved.
lieef hikl Pork.
The approriiation to the Bureau of Animal
Inuu<try was $850,000 and the expenditures
for tlie year were only '.'.". -Ui'.t 24, thus leav
ing unexpended $334,750 s«i. Tiie Inspection
of beef animals lor export and Interstate trade
has beeu continued and 12,941,056 head were
iu.spected durlUK the year at a cost of 1% cents
per head, against 4?i cents for ISO 3. The
amount o( pork microscopically examined was
38,437,937 nound*, against 20,577,410 pounds
in tne preceding year. The cost ol this inspec
tion lias been diminished from S^i cents per
bead Id 1893 to 6% cents In 1894.
The expense of inspecting the pork sold iv
1894 lo Ueruiauy and France by the United
Stales was $88,922 10. • Ibe quantity in-
M ected was greater by 15,000,000 pounds than
duriug ihe pieceding year, when the cost of
such inspection was $172,367,088. I lie Sec
letaiy ol Agiiculture recommends that the law
pi ovlding for the microscopic inspection of ex
port and interstate meal be so amended as to
compel owners ol ibe meat inspected to pay
tiie cost of such inspection, aud 1 call attention
to the arguments piesented in his report in
support oi tiiis recommendation.
The live beef cattle exported and tagged
duung the year numbered 363,535. This is an
increase of 69.533 head ov< r the previous
>ear. Ihe sanitary Inspection ot cattle
shipped to Europe ha* cost an averag- of
lo^i cents for eacb animal, and the cost of In
sieciinK Soutnern- cattle and the disinfection
of cars a::d stockyaras average 2.7 cents per
animal.
The scientific inquiries of the Bureau of Ani
mal Industry have progressed steadily duiing
th- year. liluch tuberculin aud rn;tll-ln have
been furnished to Mate authorities for use in
the agricultural colleges and expeiiment
stations for the treatment of tuberculosis and
glanders.
Quite recently this department had published
tlie resul s of its Investigations of buviue tuber
cnlosls and its researches will be vigorously
continued. Certain heids iv the District of
Columbia will be thoroughly inspected and
will piobably supply aileijuate scope for the
Department to intelligently piosecute its
sclent Be work and furnish sufficient material
for purposes of illustrailou, desciiption and de«
hnuion.
Tlie steiiliz:Uion of milk suspected of con
taining the baccilli of tuberculosis has been
during the year veiy thoroughly exiilalvd iv a
leaflet by Dr. D. E. Salmon, the Chief of tne
bureau, aud given general circulation through
ou; the country.
The office or experimental stations, which is
a part ol the United ties Department of
Agriculture, has during the past yea; engaged
Itself almost wholly In preparing tor publica
tion woiks based upon the reports ol agricul
tural experimental stations and otUer institu
tions for agricultural inquiry Iv the United
States and foieigu countries. The Secretary,
Iv his report for 1893, called attention to tne
fact tliai the appropriations made for the sup
i">i i ol experiment stations throughout the
Union were tbe ouly moneys ta!»eii out of the
national treasury by an act ot Cougress for
wliich no accounting to Federal authorities
was required. Responding to this su^nestioa
the I if y-tiiiid Congress In making iis appro-
Driatlnn for cbe department for thepie-ient
fiscal year provided that ilie Secretary of Agri
culture shall prescribe the form of an annual
fiuancial Blatemeni required by ne.ctiou 3 of
said ac: of V.neh 2, 1887. shall ascertain
whether the expenditures uuder tbe aupropria
tion bereby made are in accoidance with the
Hovlsious of said act, and shall make a tepoit

The best source ol t tie statistician of tbe De.

by diligence aud care ot tne actual and real
cotiditiuus. favorable or unfavorable, of the
farmers and farms of tiie country, aud io such
eaiisi-- as produce ihe conditions, to the end
tiiar ihe facts i laineii may nuide their in
telligent ttlltieut. In obedience to this l.iwtlie
Depannient of Agricul i. if Immediately sent
out bi.ink lorms of expense accounts to each
station, and proposes in addition to make
miuugu trusted exierts a systematic examtni
tiou ot ibe seveial stations uunug the year for
tbe purpose of acquiring by personal investiga
tion the detailed Information necessary to en
able tlie Secretary of Agriculture to make, as
tlie statute provides, a satisfactory report to
Congress. Tiie boards of management of tbe
several s ations with cieat alacilly and cor
dlaliiy have approved the amendment to ihe
law providing for tlie supervision ot their ex
penditures, anticipating hat it will iuciease
the efficiency of tbe statiotis and protect tiieir
directors and managers from loose charges
concerning tneir use of public funds, besides
bringing the Department ol Agilculture mto
closer jnd mure confidential relations wltn the
expeilmeutal sUliou-, and tlirouuli their joint
service largely increasing their usefulness to
the agriculture of ihe conti!r>.
Acting upon a recommendation contained in
the lepoi t of 1893, Congress app .luted $10,000
to enable the Secietary of Agi (culture lo inves
tigate and report upon the nutritive value ol
virious articles aud commodities used for hu
man food with special suggestion ot fun, whole
some ants edible ai tides less wasteful aud more
economical than iuo»e In coiniuou use. Uuder
this appropriation the part men i has prepared
and now Ims nearly ready for disiiibtition an
elememaiy discussiou of the uutntlve value
and pecuuiary economy of food. When we. con
sider that fully half of all tn<: money earned by
tbe wage-earners of the civiiizi-d world is ex
[ ended by them for food tii*; Importance
and utility of such au investigation is
appaient. The drpartment ezi«nded in
tt.e fiscal year 1892 $2.354,809 66, and
out of that sum the total ..mount ex
pended in sclenillic research was 45.6 per
cent. liul In the year ending June 30. 1894,
out ot a total expenditure of $1,948,988 38 the
department applied 61.8 per cent ni th.it sum
to scieulihc woik and investigation. It is there
foi c very plainly obsei v;iln llial the economies
which liave ben practiced in Hie admiinstia
tion|of the department h;ive no! been at the ex
pense of scientilic rrsearcti.
The recommendation contained In the teport
of the Secretary foi 1893, that the vicious sys
tem of piomiscuous free distribution of its
departmental documents b- abandoned, |j
agalu urged. These publlcai ions may well be
furnished without cost to public libraries, edu
cational instttUliOtiS and the oiilcrs and
librailesof ates and of the Federal Govern
neat, but iiom all Individuals applying for
ti tn a pi ice covering me cost ol ihe document
a-kid foi should be required. Thus, the publi
cat;iJiis and document;* would be secured by
those who really desire them for propei pur
poses. Half a million of copies ol the report ot
tbe Secretary of Agriculture :> re printed for
distribution at au anuu.il cost of about
£300.000. Large uumbers of them are cum
bering stoierooms at the Capitol and the
shelves of second-hand bookstores ihi ougliotu
the country. All this labor and waste inluht
oe avoided if the recommendations of the Sec
retary weie adopted. Tiie Secietary also again
■ leromiiieiids that the gratuitous dlstilbutiou of
seeds cease, and tbai no money be appropriated
foi th.it purpose excem to experimental sta
tions, He reiterates the reasons given In his
report foi 1893 for olscontiuuiug this uuiusti
fiable gratuity, and 1 fully coucur In me" con
clusions which he has readied.
A further important utility iv agricultural
statistics is found iv their elucidation of the
relation or the supply of farm products to the
demand for them in the markets o/ the United
St.r.es aud of ihe world. It Is deemed possible
th.it an agricultural census may I c taken each
year tiiroue;!) the agents of the statistical divi
sion of the depaitme.n' and such acouise is com
mended for trial by ths chief of thai division.
Its scope would be: (!) The :nea nnd«tr each
of the more important crops. (2) The aggre
gate products of each of such crops. (3) The
quantity or wheat aud corn iv the hands of
farmers at a date alter the spring sowings, at
plantings aud befor tno beginning of harvest
and also the quantity of cotton aud tobacco re
maining in the nands of planters either ai the
same dales or at some other designated limp.
1 be cost of the work Is estimated at $7>o(> 000
Owiug to the peculi.ir quality of the statisti
cian's work and me natural and acquired
huesse n cess;, i y to its successful pro.se
cution the Secretary ot Agriculture ex
presses the opinion that every persou employed
In gathering statistics under the chief of mm
division should be admitted to that service
only after a thorough, exhaustive and success
ful examination at the hands of the United
rtiates Civil Service Commission. ThU h.is led
him to call for Mich examination of candidates
for tne position of ;issistant statisticians, and
also of candidates for chiefs of section iv that
division.
The work done by the Department of Agri
culture is very biiefly dealt with In tuts commu
nication, and 1 commend the report of the Sec
retary aud the very important Interests with
which it deals to tbe careful atteutiou of the
Congress.
Civil Service Extension.
Tiie advantages to tlie public service of an
ndherence to the principles of civil service re
form ai c constantly more apparent, and nothing
Is so encouraging 10 those in official life who
honestly desire uood government as the in
creasing appreciation by our people of these
advantages. vast majority of the voters of
the land are rt-ady to Insist that the time aud
atiention of those they select to perform jtor
them important public duties should not De
distracted by doling out minor offices, and they
are growing to be unanimous in regarding
party organization as something that should be
used In e!>iabl!sliin&£ party principles instead of
dictating the distribution o( public placet as
rewards of partisan activity. Numerous addi
tional offices and places have lately been
brought within civil-service rules and regula
tions and some others will probably soon be
included. The report of the Commissioners
will be submitted to Congress and 1 invite cart
ful attention to the recommendations it cou
taius.
National I'oard €>f Health.
I am entirely convinced lhat we ought not to
be lunger without n national board of health or
natlonal health .charged with uo other
duties than such as pertain to the protection of
our country from the invasion of pestilence ana
disease. Tills would involve the establishment
by such board or otticeis of pi ope r quarantine
precautions or the necessary aid and counsel to
local authorities on the subject, prompt advice
and assisiauce to local boards of health or
r.ealih officers in the suppression of contagious
diseases, and in cases where there are no such
local board or officers, the immediate direction
by the national board or officers of measures of
suppiession, constant and authentic informa
tiou concerning toe Health of foreign countries
aud all parts of our own country as related to
contagious diseases, and Hie consideration of
regulations to be enforced In foreign ports to
prevent the introduction of contagion into our
cities and the measuru which should be adopted
to secuie, their enforcement.
Tijeie seems to be at this time a decided in
clination to discuss measuies of piotectiou
aeatust contagious diseases iv international
coufeieuces, with a vit-w of adopting means of
mutual assistance. The creation of such a
uatiooal liealtb establishment would gieativ
aid our standing in such conferences and im
prove oui opporiuni'.ies to avail ourselves of
their benefits. 1 earnestly recommend I lie in
auguration of a national board of health or
similar Instrumentality, believing the same to
be .i needed precaution against contagious dis
eases aud In the interest of tbe safety aud
health of our people.

F»T»r« Fri-e Coal hikl Sugar.
The tariff act passed at the last session of
the Congress neeus important amendments if it
is to be executed eflectively and with cer
tainty, iv addition to such necessary amend
ments as will not change rates ot duty, and I
am still very aectdedly iv favor of putting coal
.iiul iron upon the free list. So tai as the sugar
schedule is concerned I would be glad under
existing aggravations t<> see every particle of
differential duty in favor of letiued sugar
stricken out of .our taiiff law. If vvitn all me
favor now accorded tbe sugai relining interest
in our tarill laws it still languishes to the ex
tent of closiug relinenes and pulling thousands
of workmen out of employment it would seem
to piesent a hopeless case for reasonable legis
lative aid. Whatever else is done or omitted 1
earnestly repeal here my recommendation 1
have made in another portion of ibis communi
cation that i he additional nuty <if one-tenth of !
a ceut per pound laid upon sugar imported
from countries paying a bounty on its export
be abrogated. It seems to me that exceedingly
important considerations point to the propriety
of this amendment.
v. i;n the advent of a new tariff policy, not
only calculated to relieve the consumers of our
land in the co«t of their daily life, but to invite
a better development of American thrift aud
create for us closer ana moie pioOtabie com

follows as a logical and imperative necessity
that we should at once remove the chief If not
the only obstacle which has so long prevented
our ticipaiiou in the foreign carrying tiade.
of the sea.
Free Ships Wanted.
A tarlft built UDon tbe theory that It is well to
check imports and that a home market should
bound the industry aud effort of American pro
ducers was fitly supplemented by a reius.il to
allow American registry to vessels built abroad,
though owned aud navigated by our people,
thus exhibiting a willingness to abandon all
contest for the advantages of American trans
oceanic carn.ige. Our new tariff policy, built
upon ihc theoiy thai it Is well to encourage
such Importations as our people need, and that
their products and manufactures should tind
maikeis iv every part of the habitable globe, is
consistency suppl niented by the greatest
possible liberty to our citizens id the ner*ntp
and navigation of ships in which our products
and manufactures may be transported.
The millions now paid to foreigners for
ca i rying Ameilcan passengers aud products
across the sea should be turned Into American
hands. Ship-building, which has been protected
to strangulation, should be revived by the
prospect of profitable employment tor ships
when built, aud the American sailor should be
resurrected aud again take his place, a sturdy
and industrious citizui in time of peace, and a
patriotic aud safe defender of American inter
ests in the day of conflict. The ancient provision
of our law aenylug American registry to ships
built abroad and owned byAmericans appears in
the light ot preseul conditions not only to be a
failure for good at every point, but to be nearer
a lelic of bui baiism than anythlug that exists
under the permission of a statute of tne United
States. I earnestly recommend its prompt re
peal.
I hose Bond Issues.
During the last month tbe gold reserved In
the treasury for the purpose of redeeming the
notes ol the Government circulating as money
in the hands of the people became so reduced,
and its further depletion in the near future
seemed so certain, that, Iv the exercise of
proper care for the public welfare, it became
necessary to replenish the reserve and thus
maintain popular faith In the ability aud de
lenninatiou ot the Government to meet, as
agiecd. its pecuniary oblieaaous. It would
have been wril if. lv this emergency, the au
thority had ■ xtsted to issti- ihe bonds of the
Government beariug a low rate of Interest and
maturing within a sboii period: but Con
gress having f.iiled to confer such authority,
lesort wit* necessaiily had to the lesumptlou
act of 1875, aud pursuaut to il provisions
bomls were Issued drawing interest at the rate
ol 5 per cent per annum, aud maturing ten
years after their i«sue, thai being the shortest
time authorized by the art. 1 am glad to say,
however, thai on the sale of theso bonds the
premium received operated to reduce the rate
of iuif rest to be paid by the Government to
less than a per ceut.
.Nothing could be worse or further removed
from sensible finance than the relations exist
ing between the currency the Government has
Issued, the gold held for its redemption and the
means which must be resorted to for the pur
pose of repleuishiug such ledemptlou fund
when impaired. liven if the claims upon this
fund weie coufined to the obligalions originally
Intended, and if the redemption of theso obli
gations npant their cancellation, the fund
would be very small. But these obligations
when received and redeemed lv gold are uot
cancsled, but are reissued and may do duty
m;iuy tnm«s by way of drawing gold from the
treasury. Thus w^ have an endless chain iv
operation constantly depleting the treasury's
gold and never near a final rest. . As if this was
not bad enouth we assert, by a statutory declar
atiou, that it is the policy of Ihe Government
to maintain the parity between gold aud sil

side. 1 lie demands that increase our danger
also increase the necessity of nf otecting this
reserve against depletion aud It is most unsat
isfactory to know that the protection aflorded
is only a temporary palliation. It is perfectly
and palpably plain that the only way under
present conditions by which this reserve, when
dangerously depleted, can be replenished is
through the issue of the bonds of the Govern
ment and yet Congress has uot only thus far
declined to autbonze the issue of bonds best
suited to such a purpose, but there seems i dis
position In some quarters to deny both the ne
cessity and power for the issue of bonds at all.
1 cannot for a moment believe that any of
our citizens are deliberately willing that their
Government, should default in its pecuniary
obligations or that its financial operations
should be reduced to a silver basts. At any
rate I should uot feel that my duty was done if
1 omitted any effort I could make to avert such
•t calamity. As long therefore as no provision
is made for the final redemption or for the put
ting aside of the currency oDligatiou now used
to repeatedly and coti"tantly draw from the
Government Its gold, and as long as no better
authority for bond issues is allowed than at
present exists, such authority will be utilized
whenever and as often as it becomes necessary
to maim iin a sufficient gold reserve, and in
abuuda'jt time to save the credit of our coun
try and make good the Unaucial declaration ot
our Government.
Carlisle* Plan nf Finance.
Questions relating to our hanks and currency
are closely connected with the subject just re
ferred to and they also present some unsatis
factory features.
.Prominent among them are the lack of elas
ticity iv our currency circulation and its fre
quent concentration In financial centers when
it is most needed In other parts of the country.
The absolute divorcement of tbe Government i
from the business of banking is the ideal re
lationship of tbe Government to the circulation
of the currency of ihe country. This condition
cannot be immediately reached, but as a step
In that direction aud as a means of securing a
more elastic currency aud obviating other
objections to the preseut arrangement
of bank circulation, the Secretary of
tbe Treasury presents in his report a
scheme modifying the present banking laws
and providing for the issue of circulating notes
by siaie banks free from taxation uuder certain
limitations. The Secretary explaius his plan
so plainly and its advantages are developed by
hlrnwith such remarkable clearness that any ,
effort on my part to prrsent argument In its
support would be superfluous. I shall, there
fore, content myself with an unqualified in
dorsement of the Secietarv's proposed cbanges
in the law and a brief and" iuperfect statement
ol their prominent features.
It is proposed to prepare and keep on band,
ready for issue in case an Increase In ciicula
lioii is desired, blauk natioual bauk notes for
each bank having a circulation, and to repeal
tiie provisions of the present law imposing
limitations and restrictions upon bauks desir
lug to reduc-- or increase their circulation, thus
permitting such increase or reduction, within
the limit or the 76 per cr nt of then capital, to
be quickly made as emergencies arise. Iv ad
diiiou to the guarantee fund required, it is pro
nosed to piovide a safety fund for the Immed
iate redemption of the circulation notes of
failed banks by imposing a small annual tax
say half of 1 per cent upon the average circula
tion of such bank, until tbe fund amounts to 5
per cent of the total circulation outstanding.
When a bank fails its guarantee fund is to be
paid iuto il.is safety fund, and its notes are to
be ledeemed iv the tiisc instance from such
safety luud thus augmented, any impairment
of such fuud caused thereby to be made good
from the Immediately available cash assets of
said bauk, and if these should be Insufficient
biicu impairment to be made good by pro rata
assessment among other banks, their contri
butions constituting a first lien upon the assets
of a failed bank in favor of the contributing
banks.
As a further security It is contemplated that
the existing provision lixtng the individual
liabilUy ol stockholders Is to be retained, and
ihe bank's Indebtedness on account of its cii
culating notes is to be made a first lien on ail
its assets. For the purpose of meeting the
expense of printing notes, official vision,
cancellation and other like charges, there shall
be paid a lax of say one-half of 1 per cent per
annum on the average amount of notes in
circulation. It is further provided that there
shall be uo national h;i%K notes issued of less
denomination than $10, and that each national
bank, except In case of a failed b.mk, shall le
deem or retire its notes In the first instance at
its own office, at agencies to be designated by
it, .md that no fixed reserve need be main
tained on account of deposits.
Another very important feature of this plan
is the exemption of State, bauks from taxation
by the United States in cases where It Is shown
to tbe satisfaction of the Secretary of tbe
Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency
by banks claiming sucb exemption that they
have not bad outstanding circulation votes ex
ceeding 75 per cent of their paid-up and unim
paired capital; tbat their siockholdeis are in
dividually liable for tlie redemption of tljeir
circula notes to ihe full rxtPtit of their
ownership of stock; that the liabill y of said
banks upou their circulating notes constitutes
under tfieir State law a first lien upon their
assers; that such bulks have kept aud maiu
tained a guaranee fund in United States legal
tender notes, including treasury notes of 1890,
equal to 30 per cent of their outstanding circu
lating notes, and that such banks have
promptly redeemed their circulating notes
when piesented at their puncipai or branch
offices.
It Is quite likely tbat this scheme may be
usefully amended iv some o[ this detail; but I
am satistied it furnishes tlie basis for very
great improvemeuts in our preseut bankicg
aud curreucy system.

I conclude this communication fully appre
-1 ciating that tb- responsibility for all leuisia
tioo affecting the people of the United States

any legislation that cau add to the prosperity
and welfare of our country.

Mr. Wilson, chairman of the Ways ana

would give private individuals tiie power

Mr. Harter (D.) of Ohio characterized
the President's banking scheme as a good

tion, even though it be a bank.
Senator Mitchell (R.) of Orejron— His
whole financial scheme is impossible. It
is a position really going b*ck to old wild
cats.
Senator Blanchard (Democrat of Louisi
ana) — 1 avDrnve of the State banks rec
ommendation. I am opposed to the re
peal of one-eighth and one-tenth of a cent
differential of sugar, for the reason that 74
per cent of sevou million pounds of sugar
produced in Louisiana shares iv the dif
ferential.
JSenntor rtansbrough (K.)— l had heard
the President was Buffering from the gout
and the message confirms it.
Senator Perkins of California— l like his
recommendations for an increase in the
navy, but am opposed to his Iree-sbip posi
tions.
SflDator Vilas (Democrat) of Wisconsin-
It Is a pood business message.
Senat/r Chandler (Republican) of New
Hampshire— Tbe message is a very com
monplace document.
Mr. Reed of Maine had nothing to say
regarding the message.
Mr. Burrows of Michigan had no com
ment to make.
General Cfttchingg (D.) of Mississippi,
one of tbe Committee on Rules, strongly
mdorsed the President's financial views.
Of the Democratic membrrs of tliß ."-eu
ate Committee on Finance, Senators Voor
hee?, Hurri9 and Vest asked to be excused
from expressing any opinion on the finan
cial views advanced by the President, and
Senator Junes of Arkansas would only
repeat what be bas heretofore said, that be
aid not. believe any financial legislation
could be possible during tbe present ses
sion.
Republican members of tbe committee
were almost as disinclined to talk as their
Democratic colleagues. Senator Sherman
would go no further than to say that the
message contained nothing striking. Sen
ator Allison declared it was uot a time for
Repulicans to take Ihe lead.
Senator Brice (Democrat) of Ohio — Tbe
Baltimore plan strikes meaa a pure dream.
Its udoptiou would certainly demoralize
the finances of tbe country.
Senator Teller (Republican of Colo
rado)—! caunot see that the message
offers any relief to the. country, and it ap
pears to me as if the President failed to
comprehend the financial or political con
ditions.
Senator Hoar (It.) of Massachusetts— lt
is a message without vieor or courage,
indicatiug in every sentence tbe PreM
dent's consciousness of public disapproval.
Can this be haughty MarmiouV
Senator Stewart — The financial plan
in Cleveland's message, stripped of verb
iage, means that the United States shall
give bankers £75 for ST2 50. Any bauk
that will deposit $22 50 of legal
tender, whether it be greenbacks or
treasury notes, will receive $75 of our
Government money, a cunning way of re
tiring greenbacks. It removes all restric
tions of ibe banking law against expan
sion and contraction by tbe banks to
enable them and their associates to ,'rig"
the market.
PRESS COMMENT.
Watterson Thinks the Message Is
Decidedly Different.
Omaha, Dec. 3.— Tbe Bee (Republican)
will say: Tbe portion of President
Cleveland's annual message which will
command the first attention of the finan
cial and business interests of the country
is tbat relating to tbe currency,
witb which the message coucludes.
The message is a practical, businesslike
document, notably free frmn tbe peculiar
characteristics which distinguish ino9t of
Mr. CJeveland's utterances, and will repay
careful perusal for the great amount of
useful information it contains.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 3.— Tbe Jour
nal (R.) says the President's message is a
document which will attract attention
only because of its length, and not because
of handling of subjects in which the
American paople are iatensuly interested.
Like all his oftieial acts during the present
term the document is a disappointment to
tbe people and must be * humiliation to
his remaining adherents.
The Times (D.): "The striking feature
of President Cleveland's message is its
lucidity and comprehensiveness. Tbe sur
prising feature of Ibe document is the
absence of any recommendations that
would invite contention. The message
is written in the vigorous style and rugged
periods whicii mark all the state papers of
Mr. Cleveland. It is likely to make a pro
found impression on Congress and the
country and may stimulate such a meas
ure of energy on the part of the Senators
and Representatives during tbe short ses
sion as will secure some of the important
reforms recommended."
Louisville; Ky., Dec. 3.— Tbe Courier-
Journal: Tlie President's annual message,
committed to Congress yesterday, is un
usually long and is almcst as un
interesting as it is long. Aside from
the indorsement and synopsis of
Secretary Carlisle's plan for currency
reform, with one or two other recom
mendations, tiie message has but little
other significance than attacbes to a clock
like condensation of the various depart
mental reports. In this respect it is very
different from some of tbe preceding mes
sages of Mr. Cleveland.
Denvek, Dec. 3.— The Republican
(Rep.) will comment on the President's
message to-morrow as follows: "la July,
1893) wtien President Cleveland, at the
dictation of the money power and in
accordance with an evident agreement
with tbe English Government called tbe
Fifty-third Congress together in a special
session to repeal the purchasing clause of
tbe Sherman law, he boldly declared in
his call that repeal was all that was neces
sary to restore prosperity in this
country. He accomplished his pur
pose by the coercion of the cuckoos
of his own party, through bu^dozing and
a shrewd use of the patronage of his office,
but although he has made many public
utterances since that time be has never
taken occasion to notify the country
that his prophecy regarding the best
method of securing a return of pros
parity has been fulfilled. The reason is
obvlou*. The times have grown worse
instead of better since the reoeal bill
passed in the fall of 1893, and even Presi
dent Cleveland does not possess tho hardi
hood to attempt to justify that stupendous
criminal blunder."
Cleveland, Dec. 3.— The Leader says
the message Is remarkable for nothing but
the President's financial recommendations,
wliich, it says, are intended to please the
PoDulists and Democrats of the South and
West, and which, if carried out, would
result in the revival of wildcat currency
and the material weakening of tbe national
banking system by decreasing the security
of the hclderi and leaving depositors at
the mercy of dishonest bank officials.
The Plaindealer says: The present
President is nothing, if not tenacious in
nis opinions. He still clings to tbe theory
tiiat coal and iron should be placed on the
free list, but he gives no reason for it.
The President rightfully indorses the re
organization of the Union Pacific Railway
Company so as to take it out of the hands
of the receiver*.
St. Louis Dec. 3.— The Globe-Democrat
will say: The message of President Cleve
land this year is the longest one he has
ever written, and one that contains the
least matter of original interest and im
portance. That Dart of the message which
will attract the most attention is the out
line of a plan for a new currency system.
The Republic (D.) will say: "Mr. Cleve
land's message would have been more use
ful if he had elaborated his views
upon the currency and referred briefly
to the reports of his Secretaries on
other subjects instead of slating other sub
jects fully and contenting himself with an
endorsement of Secretary Carlisle's plan
for a change in the currency. Reorgani
zation of tbe currency is by far the most
important subject that has been discussed
by any President since the war."
Chicago, Dec. 3.— The Herald (Demo
crat) will 3ay: "The annual message of
Clovflland is very much in earnest through
out, and those portions which express his
personal views on public policy and
the principles of the Government
have his usual force and directness.
On tbe whole it is a satisfactory docu
ment, which clears up tbe situation
amazingly, which will excite but little
hostile criticism and which is a creditable
American State paper."
The Times will say: "Undaunted by
wliat thfi Republican orians are pleased to
rail the verdict against free trade, Mr.
Cleveland demands free coal, free iron ore
and free ships. He even augepsts that
if revenue considerations would permit
he would be glad, under existine aggrava
tions, to see every particle of differential
duty stricken out of our tariff law— an ex
pression which a vast body of the people
of the United States, victims of the trusts
fostered by these duties, will heartily
echo."
Tbe Tribune: "With the exception oi
tbe brief tariff statement and the some
what longer financial statement, the mes
sage is purely clerical, and reveals ttie rou
tine work of the departments. Summed
up, it is a long business message, without
partisan exaltation on tbe one hand, or
useless mourning over recent catastrophes
on tbe other, aud with evident suggestions
of gout."
The Record: "The President's un
equivocal declaration that he will main
tain the national currency on a gold basis
at any cost in bonds should dispel all
doubts on tiia: score, if such doubts bave
still existed anywhere."
New VY t obk, Dec. 3.— The World says:
The message as a whole is a disappoint
ment. There is no clear note of leader
ship in it. It contains not the slightest
recognition of the causes of the late
disaster to the Democratic party. It bas
not a word indicating the purpose to
amend the faults and correct the blunders
that contributed to its defeat.
COLLIDED IN THE FOG.
Fears That the Steamer Kenmore
Mas Been Lost.
London, Dec. 3. — The steamer Alber
tine, from Shields to this port, arrived at
Yarmouth to-day witb her bows com
pletely stove in and leaking badly. Her
commander reported that she was in col
lision yesterday with a large passenger
steamer.
The Albertlne struck tbe steamer amid
ships and tbe latter disappeared in the
ton which enveloped that part of the coast
all day yesterday. The Albertine, in spite
of her damaged condition, returned to the
point where tbe collision occurred for the
vessel with which sue bad collided, bat
no trace of the steamer could be found
and it is supposed she foundered. A life
buoy and four hatches marked "Kenmore"
were washed ashore near Yarmouth to
day. Tlie steamship Kenmore left Shields
on November 18 for Cartbagena. Several
other collisions of small steamers are re
ported to have occurred during tbe fog of
yesterday.
STAKE RACES.
There Will Be Running at Sheeps-
head Bay Next Year.
New York, Dec. 3.— The following was
given out at the rooms of tbe Jockey Club
to-night: "Tiie racing season at Sbeeps
head Bay next-summer will be all arranged
for and left in abeyance until after
the meeting of tbe Legislature. If the
legislators do not make racing a misde
meanor there will be racing at Sheepshead
Bay next season. While entries will only
be received subject to tbe conditions
set forth in tbe resolution, there is
very little doubt among competent turf
authorities that the anti-gambling amend
ment will be so construed as to allow en
trance fees and stake events. If such is
the case there will be a Suburban, a fu
turity and a realization stake iv 1895."
THEY ALL WANT FLOWER.
Set Free and Then Almost at Once
Arrested Again.
Chicago, Dec. 3.— Dr. R. C. Flower of
Boston, who is charged with defraudiug
N. C. Foster, a lumberman of Fairfield,
Wisconsin, secured bail this evening
and was released from jail. His
liberty was of short duration,
nowever, as about 9 o'clock he and his
private secretary, H. C. Mosher, were ar
rested by a representative of the Mooney
& Boland Detective Agency. This second
arrest was made at tbe instance of
William Chapman of Feoria, II!., whom
it is asserted Flower got the best of on a
deal several years ago.
RADER DEFEATS RYAN.
Republicans Come Out Ahead in the
Los Angeles Election.
Los Angeles, Dec. 3.— To-day's contest
was the quietest election ever held In this
city, and judging from tbe returns received
from forty out of forty-five precincts all
the municipal offices will be occupied by
Republicans, witb the exception of three
Democratic Couucilmeu and possibly two
Sciiool Directors.
These forty precincts gave Frank Rader
(K.) a plurality of nearly 1700 over Ryan,
bis Democratic opponent for Mayor, and
at this ratio Rader will occupy the Mayor's
cbair w itb abcut 2000 votes to spare.

The Bark Detroit Is Leaking Very

Victoria, B. C, Dec. 3.— The bark De

Saturday last, put back to port last night
leaking badly. While at sea she experi
enced no rouuh weather, and her uusea
worthy condition was proven just what
her deserting crew pronounced it to be
last week— not fit for a voyage to San
Francisco. She will probably undergo
extensive repairs her".

ON HIS DEFENSE.
Fellows Fighting for

HOLDS BACK HIS BOOKS
Upon a Plea That Is Not Overly
Good.
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS LOST.
Bail Bonds Forfeited to the State of
New York and Never
Collected.
New York. Dec. 3.— The trial of
Colonel John R. Fellows, District Attor
ney of the city and county of New York,
upon charges of neglect of duty, was be
gun before Governor Flower's Commis
sioner, ex-Senator John J. Lenson, of
Kingston, to-day. One set of charges
made by the Good Government Club men
embraces over 300 specific cases, while an
other set presented by the German-Auier
ican Reform Union made exactly 501.
The first series of charges were read by
Mr. McMalion, who swore to their ac
curacy. Cross-examination brought out
the fact that the witness was swearing to
the information. It was conceded by
counsel that the accused was under no
compulsion to take the witness-stand to
swear that bis defense was true. The at
torney for the German-American Reform
Union argued that the charges preferred
by that body should, where the specific
ciiarces are not the same, b« tried sep
arately as distinct cases. Pending de
cision of this question a recess was taken.
After recess the charges regarding for
feited recognizances were taken up. Mr.
Phillips, for the German-Americau Union,
produced evidence to show negligence by
Colonel Fellows in collecting forfeited
recognizances in a large number of cases.
After a number of such cases bad been
called up Fellows objected, saying it was
the duty of the District-Attorney simply
to issue-execution and then leave the mat
ter to the Sheriff. Mr. Phillips argued
that it was the District Attorney's duty to
prosecute cases where fraudulent bonds
were given or where transfers had been
made to defraud people. They had sixty
cases, he said, where $70,000 worth of bail
had been forfeited, and ouly a few thou
sands collected and professional bonds
men allowed to go unprosecuted.
Colonel Fellows refused to produce the
books of his office, stating they would
show the names of persons indicted, but
uot yet arrested.

KEEP OUT THE WOLF.
A Short Discourse Founded on a Very
Familiar Text.
"Please sliut the door!"
This request ia in season. It stares ono In
the face everywhere. Bometimes tne "uleivse"
is omitted, aud tlit'n tbe sentence is curt aod
ill-inaunered. To people who must expose
themselves to wlutry airs we say:
Please shut the doors of your bodies to the
adverse tnllueuces of the fall and waiter. X ep
out colds and chills aud shivers. When bron-
chitis and pneumonia coma knocKing shut tho
door. "How?" you asK.
Very simply, qulcKly and economically by
using a cenle stimulant; something mat will
keen the blood briskly clrculatini; in rhe tangle
of tiny blood-vessels in tbe skin. As lons a*
this is done there is no possibility ol taking
cold, because a cold is a driving of blood from
the surface to the interior 01 the body, where
the vessels are quickly congested aud inflamed.
