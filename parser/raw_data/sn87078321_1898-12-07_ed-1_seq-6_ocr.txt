Washington, December 6. The Pres
ident's message was sent to Congres
To the Senate and House of Represen
tative: Notwithstanding the lidded burden
rendered necessary by the war our
people are In a very satisfactory and
steadily Increasing degree of prosper
ity, evidenced by the largest vol
ume of business ever recorded.
Manufacture has been produc
tive, agricultural pursuits have
yielded abundnnt returns, labor In nil
arid of Industry Is better rewarded,
revenue legislation passed by the pres
ent Congress has Increased the treas
ury's receipts to the amount estimated
by Its authnrn; the finances of the gov
ernment have been successfully admin
istered and Its credit advanced to the
first rank: while Its currency has been
maintained at the world' highest
standard. Military service under a
eommon flag and for a righteous cause
has strengthened the national spirit
and served to cement more closely
than ever the fraternal bonds between
vi ry section of the country.
A review of the relation of the
flitted Htnte to other powers, always
siproprtate, Is this year of primary
importance In view of the momentous
Issues which have arisen, demanding
In one Instance the ultimate determin
ation by arms and Involving far-reaching
consequences which will Inspire
the earnest attention of the Congress.
In my last message very full consid
eration was given to the question of
the government of the United States
toward Spain and the Cuban Insurrec
tion as being by fnr the most impor
tant problem with which we were then
tailed upon to denl. The considerations
then advanced, and the exposition of
the views therein expressed, disclosed
my sense of the evtreme gravity of the
situation. Betting aside, as logically
unfounded or practically Inadmissible,
the recognition of the Cuban Insurg
ents as belligerents, the recognition of
Cuba, neutral intervention to end the
. war by Imposing a rational compro
mise betwemi the contestants, Inter
vention In favor of one or the other
party, and forcible annexation of the
island I concluded it was honestly due
to our friendly relations with Spain
that she should be given a reasonable
chance to realize her expectations of
reform to which she had become irre
vocably committed. Within a few weeks
previously she had announced compre
hensive plans which It wns confidently
asserted would be elllcaclous to reme
dy the evils so deeply affecting our
country, so Injurious to the true in
terests of the 'nether country as well
as to those of Cuba, and so repugnant
to the universal sentiment of human
ity. The ensuing month brought little
sign of real progress toward the pacifi
cation -of Cuba. The autonomous ad
ministration Bet up In the capital and
some of the principal cities appeared
not to gain the favor of the Inhabitants
nor to be able to extend their influence
to the large extent of territory held by
the Insurgents, whllo the military arm.
obviously unable to cope with the still
active rebellion, continued many of the
most objectionable and offensive poli
cies of the government that had pre
ceded It. No tangible relief was af
forded the vast numbers of unhappy
teooncentradoa, despite the reiterated
professions made In that regard and
the amount appropriated by Spain to
that end. The proffered expedient of
aor.es of cultivation proved illusory;
Indeed, no less practical nor more de
lusive promise of succor could wail
have been tendered to the exhausted
and destitute people, stripped of all that
mado life and home dear, and herded
In a strange region among unsympa
thetic stranger hardly lea necessitous
than themselve.
I MEETING A CRISI8.
. By the end of December the mortal
ity among them had frightfully in
creased. Conservative estimates from
Spanish source placed the deaths
among these distressed people at over
0 per cent, from the time Gen. Wey
lr"s decree of reerncentratlon wa en
forced. With the acquiescence of tho
Spanish authorities a scheme was
adopted for relief by charitable contri
butions, raised In this country and dis
tributed, under the direction of the
consul general and the several consul,
by noble and earnest ndlvldual effort
through the organized agencies of the
American Red Cross. Thousands of
lives were thus saved, but many thou
sands more were Inaccessible to such
forms of aid.
The war con-Jr.ued on the old footing
without comprciseiislve plan, develop
ing only the same spasmodic encount
ers, barren of strategic result, that had
marked the course of the earlier ten
sears' rebellion as well as the present
insurrection from Its start. No altern
ative save physical exhaustion of
either combatant, and therewithal the
practical ruin of the Island, lay in
sight, but how far distant no one could
venture to conjecture.
At this Juncture, on the 16th of Feb
ruary last, occurred the destruction of
the battleship Maine, while rightfully
lying In the harbor of Havana on a
mission of International courtesy and
good will a catastrophe the suspicious
nature and horror of which stirred the
nation's heart profoundly. It is a
striking evidence of the poise and
sturdy good sense distinguishing our
national character that this shocking
blow, falling upon a generous people,
already deeply touched by preceding
veaU In Cuba, did not move them to
an Instant, desperate resolve to toler
ate no longer the existence of a condi
tion of danger and disorder .at our
floors that made possible such a deed
by whomsoever wrought. Yet the In
stinct of Justice prevailed and thp na
tion anxiously awaited the result of
the searching Investigation at once set
on foot. The finding of the naval
board or Inquiry established that th
origin of the explosion was externally
by n submnrlne mine, and onlv halted.
through lark of positive testimony, to
ox tnc responsibility or It author
ship.
All these things carried conviction to
the most thoughtful, even before thi
finding nf the naval hoard, that a crl
sis In our relations with Spain and to
ward Culm wan at hnnd. 80 strong
whs mis poller that It needed but a
nrter executive suggestion to the con
gress to receive Immediate answer to
the nuty of making instant provision
for the possible and perhaps speedily
ptolmble emergency of war. and the
remarkable, ntinost unique, spectnclc
presented or a unanimous vote of
both hcus- on the 1Mb or March ap
propriating f).-,n.ooo,non "for the nntlonnl
defense and for each nnd everv pur
pese connected therewith, to be ex
tended st the discretion of the Prcul.
dent." That this act of provision came
none too soon was disclosed when the
application nf the fund was under! ik
en. Our coasts were-practically unde
fended. Our navy needed inrge pro
vision for Increased ammunition nnd
supplies, and even number to cope
with any sudden attack from the nnvy
of Spain, which comprised modern ves
sel of the highest type of continental
perfection. Our army also required en
largement nf men and munitions. The
details of the hurried preparations foe
the dreaded contingency are told In the
reports or the secretaries or war and
of the navy, and need not be repeated
here. It Is sufficient to say that the
outbreak of war. when II did mnu
found our nation not unprepared to
meet ine rontllct.
PREPARING FOR HOSTILITIES.
The maximum effective flirhtltiff
force of the navy during the war, sep
arated Into classes, was a follows:
Four battleshp of the first class;
1 battleship of the second class: 2 arm
ored cruisers', 8 coast defense monitor:
1 armored ram: 12 protected cruiser;
3 unprotected cruisers: IS gunboats; I
dynamite cruiser; 11 torpedo boats; II
vessel of the old navy, Including mon
itors. Auxiliary navy: 11 auxiliary
cruisers: 211 converted yachts; 27 con
vener: tugs: is converted colliers: IS
re venue cutters: 4 lighthouse tenders
and 1ft miscellaneous vessels.
Mucn alarm was felt alnns our entire
Atlantic seaboard lest some attack
might be made by the enemv. Everv
precaution was taken to prevent pos
sible injury to our great cities lying
along the coast. Temporary garrisons
were provided, drawn from the Kt.ite
mllltla: Infantry and light batteries
were drawn from the volunteer fore.
About 12.000 troops were thu employ
ed. The coast signal service was es
tablished for observing the approach
of an enemy's ships to the coast of
the United States, and the life-saving
nnd lighthouse services co-operated,
which ennble-d the Navy department
to have all portions of tho Atlantic
ci-ast, from Maine to Texas, under ob
servation. The auxiliary navy was created un
der the authority of Congress and was
olllcered and manned by the naval ml
lltla of the several States. Thl or
ganization patrolled the coast and per
formed the duty cf a second line f de
fense. t'nder the direction of the chief of
erglneers, submarine mine were
placed at the most eypnsed point. De
fere the outbreak of the war. perma
nent mining casemute and cable gal
leries had been constructed at nearly
all Important harbors. Most of the tor
pedo material was n. t to be found In
the mnrket, and had to bo specially
manufactured. I'neler date of April li,
district officer were directed to take
all preliminary measures, short of
me actual attaching of the loaded
mines to the cables, and on April 22,
telegraphle order were Issued to place
the loaded mine In position. The ag
gregate number of mines placed were
1.M5, at the prlnclpnl harbor from
Maine to California. Preparations
were also made for the planting of
mine at certain other harbors, but
owing to the early destruction of the
Spanish fleet, these were not placed.
The Signal Corps was promptly or
ganised and performed service of the
most difllcult and Important character.
Its operation during the war rbvcreel
the electrli'al connection of all roast
fortifications, tho establishment of tel
ephonic and telegraphic facilities for
the camps at Manila, Santiago and In
Porto Rico. There were constructed
800 miles of line at ten great camps,
thus facilitating military movements
from those points in a manner hereto
fore unknown In military administra
tion. Field telegraph line were es
tablished and maintained under the
enemy's tire at Manila, and Inter the
Manila-Hongkong cable was reopened.
MONET PROVIDED BV CONGRESS.
In Porto Rico cable communication
were opened over a discontinued route,
and on land the headquarters of the
commanding officer was kept In tele
graphic communication with the divi
sion commander on four different line
Of operations.
There was placed In Cuban waters a
completly outfitted cable ship, with
war cables und cable gear, suitable
both for the destruction of communi
cation belonging to tho enemy und
the establishment of our own. Two
ocean cables were destroyed under the
enemy' batteries at Santiago, The
day previous to the landing of Oen.
Sharter'a corp at Calmanera, within
20 mile of the landing place, cable
communications were established and
a cable station opened, giving direct
communication with the government
at Washington. This service was In
valuable to the executive in directing
the operation of the army and navy.
With a total force of over 1.300, the loss
was by disease in camp and field, offi
cer and men Included, only five.
The national defense fund of lf.0,000,
000 was expended tn large part by the
army and navy, and the object for
which It wa used are fully ehown In
the report of the several secretaries.
It was a most timely appropriation,
enabling the government to strengthen
its defenses and make preparations
greatly neded In case of war.
This fund being Inadequate to the
requirement of equipment and for the
conduct of the war, the patriotism of
the Congress provided the means in
the war revenue act of July 13, by au
thorizing a 3 per cent popular loan not
to exceed 1400,000,000 and by levying
additional Imposts and taxes. Of the
authorized loan, 1200.000,000 were offer
ed and promptly taken, the subscrip
tions so far exceeding the call as to
cover it many times over, while pre
ference being given to the smaller
bids, no single allotment exceeded
$5,000. This was a most encouraging
and significant result, showing the vast
resources of the nation and the deter
mination of the people to uphold their
country's honor.
It Is not within the province of the
message to narrate tb history of the
extraordinary war that followed the
Spanish declaration of April 21, but a
brief recital of Its more salient features
Is appropriate. The first encounter of
the war In point of date look place
April 27, when a detachment of the
niocKRdtng squadron made a recon
naissance In force at Mntanzaa, shelled
tne harbor forts and demolished ev
eral new works In construction.
DEWEY'S MAGNIFICENT VICTORY
The next engagement wa destined to
mnrk a memorable epoch In maritime
warfare. Tho Pacific fleet. under
1 ominndore Ocnrge Dewey, had lain
for some weeks at Hongkong. t'pon
the colonlnl proclamation of neutrality
being Issued and the customary 21
hours' notice being nlven. It. repaired
to Mils Bny, nenr Hongkong, whence
It proceeded to the Philippine Islands
under telegraphic orders to rnpture or
destroy the formidable Spnnlsh fleet
men sssemmen at Manila. At dny
brenk on the 1st of May the American
force entered Manila May. nnd after a
lew hours' engagement erTeef.-d the
total destruction of the Spanish fleet,
consisting of ten warships nnd a trans
port, beside capturing the naval sta
tlon nnd forts at C'nvlte, thus annlhl
biting the Spnnlsh naval power In thi
PaelMe ocean nnd comnletelv rnnlroll
nig the bay of Manila, with the nblllty
10 inse tne city at will. Not a life was
lost on our ships, the wounded num-
nered only seven, while not a vessel
was materially Injured. For this gal
lant achievement the Congress, upon
my recomniencintion, fitly bestowed
upon tne actors preferment and sub
stantlnl reward.
1 he effect nf this remarkable victory
1. run in- spirit or our people and upon
the fortunes or the war was Instant. A
prestige or Invincibility thereby at
tached to our nrms, which continued
throughout the struggle. Reinforce-
mcnts were hurried to Mnnlln under
tne command of Mai. (Jen. Merrill
nnd lirmly established within sight of
the capital, which Iny helpless before
our urms.
in the 7th day of May the Bovern.
mcnt was advised officially of the vic
tory of Manila, and nt once Inoiitrerl
of the commander of our fleet what
troops would be required. The Infor
mation wns received on the Ifith day
of May. nnd the first armv exnerlltlnn
sailed May 2".. and arrived off Manila
June jo. Other expeditions oon fol
lowed, the total force consisting of 841
olllcers and 15,058 men.
Only reluctnnce to cause needless
loss of life nnd property prevented the
early storming and capture of the city,
and therewith the absolute military
occupancy of the whole group. The
Insurgents meanwhile had resumed
the active hostilities suspended by the
uncompleted truce of December. 1S97.
Their forces Invested Manila from the
northern and eastern side, but were
constrained by Admiral Dewey and
(len. Merrltt from attempting an as
sault. It was fitting that whatever
was done In the way of decisive opera
tions In that quarter should be ac
complished by the strong arm of the
United States alone. Obeying the
stern precept of war which enjoins the
overcoming of the adversary and the
extinction of hi power wherever as
sailable as the speedy and sure means
to win a pence, divided victory was
not permissible, for no partition of the
right and responsibilities attending
the enforcement or a lust and advan
tageous peace could be thought or.
THE BLOCKADE OF CUBA.
Following the comprehensive scheme
or general attack, powerful forces were
assembled at various points on our
const to Invade Cuba and Porto Rico.
Meanwhile, uuval demonstration were
mnile at several exposed points. On
May 11 the cruiser Wllmlnirton and
trip-do boat Wlnslow were unsuccess
ful in an attempt to silence the bat
teries nt Cardenas, a anllant enslirn.
Worth Bugley, and four seamen fall
ing. These grievous fatalities were.
strangely enough, among the very few
wmcn occurred during our naval
operation In thl extraordinary con
flict. Meanwhile tho Spanish naval nre-
pnrations had been pushed with great
vigor. A powerful squadron, under
Admiral Cervera. which had assembled
at the Cape Verde Islands before the
I'Utbreak of hostilities, had crossed
tho ocean, and by Its errntlc move
ments In the Caribbean sea delayed
our military plans, while battling the
pursuit of our fleets. For a time fears
were felt lest the battleship Oregon
and gunboat Marietta, nenrlng home
after a long voyage from Snn Fran
cisco of over 15.000 miles, might be
surprised by Admiral Cervera' fleet,
but their fortunate arrival dispelled
apprehension and lent muedi needed
reinforcement. Not until Admiral Cer
vera took refuge In the harbor of San
tiago de Cuba, about May 19. was It
practicable to plan a systematic naval
and military attack upon the Antillean
possession of Spain.
Several demonstrations occurred on
the coasts of Cuba and Porto Rico in
preparation for the larger event. ' On
Mny i;i the North Atlantic squadron
shelled San Junn de Porto Rico. On
Mny 3d Commodore Schley's squadron
bombarded the forts guarding the
mouth of Santiago hnrbor. Neither at
tack bad any mnterial result. It was
evident that well ordered land opera
tions were indlspensublo to achieve a
decisive advantage.
The next act in the war thrilled not
alone the heart of our countrymen,
but the world, by its exceptlonal'hcro
Ism. On tho night of July 3 Lieut.
Hobson, aided by seven devoted volun
teer, blocked the narrow outlet from
Snntlngo harbor by sinking the rolller
Merrlmac In the channel, under a fierce
fire from tho hore batteries, escaping
with their live by a miracle, but fall
ing into the hands of the Spaniards.
It is a most gratifying Incident of the
war that the bravery of this little band
of heroes wu cordially appreciated by
the Spanish admiral, who sent a flag
of truce to notify Admiral Sampson of
their safety and to compliment them
on their daring act. They were subse
quently exchanged July 7.
By Jane 7 the cutting of the last Cu
ban cable Isolated the Island. There
after" the Invasion was vigorously
prosecuted. On June 10. under a heavy
protecting flro, a landing of 600 marines
from the Oregon, Marhlehead und
Yankee waa effected in Guantanamo
bay. where It had been determined to
establish a naval station. This im
portant and essential port waa taUen
from the enemy after severe fighting
by the marines, who were the first or
ganised force of the United States to
land In Cuba.
DESTRUCTION OF CERVERA'S
SQUADRON.
The position so won was held despite
desperate attempts to dislodge our
forces. On June 22 the advance of the
Invading army, under MaJ, Gen. Shat
ter, landed at Daiquiri, about 15 miles
east of Santiago. This was accom
plished under great difficulties, but
with marvelous dispatch. On June 23,
the movement against Santiago begun.
On the 24th the first serious engage
ment took place, In which the First
and Tenth Cavalry and the First
United States Volunteer Calvary, Gen.
Young's brigade. Gen. Wheeler's divi
sion, participated, losing heavily. By
nightfall, however, ground within five
miles of Santiago was won. The ad
vantage was steadily Increased. On
July 1 a severe battle took place, our
force gaining the outwork of Santi
ago; on the 2d El Caney and Ban Juan
were taken, after a desperate charge,
and the Investment of the city was
completed. The navy co-operated by
Khelllng the town aa U-.s coast forts.
On the day following thl brilliant
achievement of our land force, July
t, occurred the decisive naval combat
of the war. The Spanish lle-et attempt
ing to leave the harbor, was met by the
American squadron, under oommnnd
of Commodore Sampson. In less than
three hour nil the Spanish ships were
destroyed, two torpedo bonis being
sunk, and the Mnria Teresa, Almlrnnte
Oquendo, Vlzcnya and Cristobal Colon
driven ashore. The Spanish admiral and
over 1.300 men were taken prisoners,
while the enemy' loss of lire wns
deplorably large, some 80O perishing.
On our side hut one man was killed,
on the Brooklyn, and one man serious
ly wounded. Although our ships were
repeatedly struck, not one was serious
ly Injure-d. Where all so conspicuously
distinguished themselves, from the
commodore to the g-nners. and the
unnnmid heroes In the boiler rooms,
each nnd nil contributing toward the
achievement of this astounding vic
tory Tor which neither ancient nor
modern hlrtory affords a parallel In the
completeness of the event nnd the
marvelous disproportion or casualties,
It would be invidious to single out any
for special honor. Deserved promotion
has rewnrded tne more conspicuous
actors the nation's prnfoundest grat
itude Is due to nil of these brave men
who, by their skill nnd devotion. In a
few short hours crushed the sen power
of Spain nnd wrought 11 triumph
whose decisiveness nnd fur-reaching
consequcni'cs ran scarcely he mens-
ured. Nor can we be unmindful of the
achievements of our builders, mechnn
lo mid artisans for their skill In the
construction of our warships.
With the catastrophe of Santiago

the end of June to send her Medltt-
erranenn fleet, under Admiral Camara.
to relieve Mnnlla was abundoned. the
expedition being recalled afte-r It had
passed through tho Sue canal.
THE FALL OF SANTIAGO.
The c- -ilatlon of Santiago follow
ed. The ty was closely besieged by
land, while the entrance of our ships
into the harbor cut off all relief on
that side and caused a true-e to follow
for the removal of non-combatants,
Protracted negotiations continued
from July S to July in, when, under
menace of Immediate assault, the pre
liminaries of surrender were agreed
upon. On the 17th Gen. Shaffer oc
eupled the city. The capitulation em
biaced the entire eastern end of Culm.
The number of Spanish soldiers surren
dered was 22,000. all of whom were
subsequently conveyed to Spain at the
charge of the United States. The story
of this successful campaign Is told in
the report or the secretary or war.
which will be laid before you. The in
dividual valor or olllcers and soldiers
was never more strikingly shown than
In the reveral engagements leading to
the surrender or Santiago, whllo the
prompt movements and successive
victories won Instant and universal
npplnuse. To those who Rallied this
complete triumph which established
the ascendency of the United Stntes
upon land as the fight off Santiago had
earnest and lasting gratitude of the
nation Is unsparingly due. Nor should
we alone remember the gallantry of the
living: tne tiend claim our tears, and
our losses by battle and disease must
cloud any exultation at the result and
teach us to weigh the awful cost of
war, however rightful the cause or
Ignnl the victory.
With the fall or Santiago, the occu
pation of Porto Rico become the next
strategic necessity. Oen, Miles had
previously been assigned to organize
an expedition for that purpose. Fortu
nately be was already at Santiago,
where he had arrived on the 11th of
July, with reinforcements for Gen.
Shorter' army.
With these troops, consisting of 8 41
Inrantry and artillery, two companies
or engineers, one company or the Sig
nal Corps, Gen. Mile left Guantanamo
on July 21, having nine transoort.

wmcn wns engaged In blockading that
port. The mnjor-gcnernl commanding

Sohwnn's brlgnde of the Third nrmv
corps, by Oen. Wilson, with a part of
his division, nnd also by Gen. Brooka
with a part of Lis corps, numbering in
all 10,973 officers nnd men.
On July 27 he entered Ponce, one of
the me.st important port In the is
land, from which he thereafter directed
operation for the capture of the Is
lund. With the exception of encounter
with the enemy at Guayum. Horml
gunres, Ceiamo and Ynuco, and an at
tack on a force landed at Cape Snn
Juan, there was no serious resistance.
The campaign was prosecuted with
gient vigor, and by the last of August
rouch of the island was In our posses
sion, and the acquisition of the re
mainder was only a matter of a short
time. At most of the point In the I,
land our troop were enthusiastically
welcomed. Protestations of loyalty to
the flag and gratitude for delivery from
Spanish rule met our commander at
eery stage. A a potent influence to
ward peace, tho outcome of the Porto
mean operation wa of great ronse-
eiuenee nnd generous commendation Is
due to those who participated In It.
THE CAPTURE OF MANILA.
The last scene of tho war waa enacted
at Manila, its starting place. On Au

works by the land forces. In which tho
squadron assisted, the rapitnl sur-

ish capacity for resistance was de

tne ist or May, 'Was formally sealed.
To Gen. Merrltt, his officers and men
for their uncomplnJnlng and devoted
service, and for their gallantry In ac
tion, the nation la sincerely rrateful.
Their long voyage was made with sin
gular success, and the soldierly con
duct of the men. most of whom were
without previous experience In the
military service, deserve unmeasured
praise.
The total casualties In killed and
wounded In the armv durln th war
with Spain were: Officer killed. 23:
enlisted men killed, 257; total, 280; of-
ncers wounaea, 113; enlisted men

It will be observed fhat while our
navy was engaged In two great battles
and In numerous perilous undertak
ings, in blockade and bombardment,
and more than 50.000 of our troops were
transported to distant lands and were
engaged in assault and sieges and bat-
tie ana many skirmishes in unfamiliar
territory, wa lost In both arm of the
service a total of 1,868 killed and
wounded: and In the entire campaign
by lan and sea we did not lose a gun
or a fWg or a transport or a ship, and
witn ine exception or tn crew of the
Merrlmao not a soldier or sailor wa
taken prisoner.
On August 7. 46 days after the data
of the landing of Oen. Sha't i'j army
In Cuba and 11 days from the surren
der of Santiago, the United State
troop commenced embarkation for
home, and our entire fore'e wu return

August 24. There were absent from the
United State- only two mouth.
It Is fitting that t should bear testi
mony to the pntrlotlsm and devotion
of that inrge portion of our army
which, although eager to be ordered to
the post of greater exposure, fortu
nately was not required outside of the
United States. They did their whole
duty, and like their eoimndcs nt the
front, have earned the gratitude of the
nation. In like manner, the olllcers nnd
men e.f the army and of the navy who
temalned In their department and
slnllons faithfully performing most
Important duties connected with the
war, and whose requests for assign
ment In the Held and nt sea I was com

the highest commendation. It Is my
I e gret that there seems to be no suit

The annihilation of Admiral Cer
vera' fleet, followed by the capitula
tion eif Santiago, having brought to
Spanish government a realizing sense
of the hopelessness of continuing a
struggle now become wholly unequal,
It made overture of peace through
the French ambassador, whe, with the
assent of his government, had acted
as the fiienelly representative of Span
ish Interests during the war. On the
ifith of July M. Cambon presented a
communication signed by the Duke of
Almodovnr, the Spanish minister of
state, Inviting the United States to
state the term upon which It would
be willing to make peace. On July 30,
by a communication addressed to the
Duke of Almondovar nnd handed to
M. Cambon, the term of thl govern
ment were announced, substantially
as In the protocol afterward signed. On
August 10 the Spanish reply, dated
August 7, wn handed by M. Cambon
to the secretary of state. It aciepteel
unconditionally the terms Imposed as
to Cuba, Perto Rico nnd an Island of
the Ludrone groupe, but appeared to
seek to introduce inadmissible reser
vations In regard to our demand as to
the Philippine Islands. Conceiving dls
cuHslon on thl point could neither be
practical nor profitable, I directed that
In order to avoid misunderstanding,
the matter should be forthwith closed
by proposing the embodiment In u
formal proteicol of the terms upon
which the negotiations for peae'e were
to be undertaken. The vague and In
explicit suggestion of the Spnnlsh
bote could not be accepted, the only
reply being to present as a virtual
ultimatum a draft or protocol embody
ing the precise term tendered to Spain
In our note of July 30, with ndded
stipulations of detail as tn the ap
pointment of commissioners to arrange
lr the evacuation of the Spanish An
tilles. A PROTOCOL SIGNED.
On August 12 M. fumbnn announced
bis receipt of full power to sign the
protocol so submitted. Accordingly, em
the afternoon of August 12, M, Cam
bon, us the plenipotentiary of Spain,
and Secretary of State, as the plenipo
tentiary of the United States, signed u
protocol providing:
"Article 1. Spain will relinquish nil
rlolm of sovereignty over und the title

"Article 2. Spnln will cede to the
United States the Islnnd of Porto Rico

"Article 3. The United States will oc.
cupy and hold the city, bay and har
bor of Manila pending the conclusion
of a treaty of peace which shall deter
mine the control, disposition and gov

Tho fourth article provided for the
appointment of Joint commission on
the part of the United State and
Spain, to meet in Havana and San
Juan, respectively, for the purpose of
arranging and carrying out the de
tail of stipulated evacuation of Cubn,
Potto Rico and other Spanish island
in the West Indies.
The fifth article provided for the ap
pointment of not more than five com
missioner on each lde to meet at
Pari not later than October 1, and to
ptuceed to the negotiation and conclu

ratification nceordlng to the respective
constitutional form of the two coun

The sixth and lost article provided
that upon the signature of the protocol
hostilities between the two countrlea
should be auspended, and that notice
to that effect should be given a soon
a possible by each government to the
commander of Its military and naval
rorces.
Immedlatly upon the conclusion of
the protocol I issued a proclamation of
August 12 suspending hostilities on the
part of the United States. The neces
sary orders to that end were at once
given by telegraph. The blorkade of
the ports of Cuba and San Juan de
Porto Rico was In like manner raised.
On August 18 the muster out of 100,000
volunteers, or ss near that number aa
was found to be practicable, was or

MILITARY COMMISSIONERS
NAMED.
On December 1. 101.165 officers and
men had been mustered out and dis
charged from the service and 9 002
more will bo mustered out by the loth
of the month. Also a corresponding
number of general and general staff
officer have been honorably discharg

or Cuba, rorto Klco. and the ad lucent
islands were forthwith appointed:
For Cuba MaJ. Oen. James F.

Brcoke, Rear Admiral Wlnfleld S.
Schley, Brig. Gen. Wm. O. Gordon,
who -soon afterward met the Bpanlsh

Joint commission speedily accomplished
It task, and by October 18 the evacu
ation of the Islnnd was completed. The
United State flag wa raised over the
Island at noort on that day. The ad
ministration of Its affair ha been
provisionally Intrusted to a military
governor until the Congress shall
otherwise provide. The Cuban Joint

ated It Inbors. Owing to the difficul
ties In the way of removing the large
number of Spnnlsh troop still In

Pursunnt to the fifth article of the

inieiy secretary or state; Cushman K,
Davis, William P. Fry and George
Gray, senators of the United States,

lo Pails, they there met on the first of
October, five commissioner similarly
appointed on the part of Spain. Their
negotiations hnve made hopeful prog
ress, so that I trust soon to be able to
Iny a definite trenty of peace before the
Senate, with a review of the step
lending to It signature.
I do not discuss irt this time the gov
ernment fie Ihn hnOir, r.t lha ......
I session w hich will come te us as the
result or the war with Spain. Such
discussion will be appropriate arter the
treaty or peuce shall be ratified. In the
meantime nnd until the Congress ha
legislated otherwise. It will be my duty
to continue the military government
which hnve existed since our occupa
tion and give to the people serurlty In
life and property and encouragement
under a Just snil beneficent rule.
OUR RELATIONS WITH CUBA.
A soon as we are In possession of
Cuba and hnve pacified the Island It
will be necessary to give aid and di
rection to Its people to form a govern
ment for themselves. This should be
undertaken at the earliest moment
consistent with safety and assured
stie'cess. It Is Important that our re
lations with this people should be of
the most friendly character, and our
cr mtnerelal relation close and recip
rocal. It should be our duty to assist
In every proper way to build up the
waste place of the Island, encourage
the Industry of the people, and assist
them to form a government which
shall be free and Independent, thus re
alizing tho best aspiration of the Cu
ban people.
Spanish rule must be replaced by a
Just, benevolent and humane govern
ment, created by the people of Cuba,
capable of performing alk International
obligation and which shall encourage
thrift, Industry and prosperity and
promote peace and good will among
all the inhabitant, whatever may have
been their relations In the past. NeithV-

With the one exception of the rup
ture with Spain, the Intercourse of the
United States with the great family of
nations ha been marked withcordlaity
and the close of the eventful year find
most eif the Issues that necessarily
arise In the complex relation of sov
ereign States adjustad or presenting
no serious obstacle to a Just and hon
orable solution by amicable tgree
ment. THE LATTIMER RIOT INCIDENT.
On the Pith of September, 187, a
conflict took plaee nt Lattlmer, Pa , be
tween a body of striking miners and
the sheriff of Luzerne eeiunty and Ms
deputies, in whlcn 22 miner were kill
ed and 44 wounded, eif whom 10 of the
killed and 12 of the wounded were Aus
trian and Hungarian subject. This
deplorable event naturally amused the
solicitude of the Austro-Hungarlan
government, which, on the assumption
that the killing and wounding invol
ved the unjustifiable misuse or ao
thorlty, claimed reparation for tho
sufferers. Apart from the 'arching
Investigation and peremptory""ae tion of
the authorities of Pennsylvania, the
federnl executive took appropriate
step to learn the merits of the case. In
order to be In a position to meet the
urgent complaint of a friendly power.
The sheriff and hi deputies having
been Indicted for murder, were tried
and acquitted after protracted pro
ceedings and the hearing of hundreds
of witnessen on the ground that the
killing was In the line of their official
duty to uphold law and preserve public
order in the State. A representative
of the elepartment of Justice attended
the trial for Indemnity for Its Injured
Wlh nil the fncts In it possession, thi
government expects to reach a har
monious understanding on th subject
with thnt of Austria-Hungary', ' not-''
withstanding the renewed claim of
tho latter after learning the result of
the trial for lndemnly for it Injured
subjects.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
Tho Nicaragua carnl comm'Bslon,
under the chairmanship r.f Rear Ad
miral John G. Walker, appointed July
24. 1897, under tho authority of a pro
vlslon In the sundry civil act of June
4 of that year, has nearly completed
Ira I n linr, fl ,1.1 Miu B,1I ta I .. . .
haustive inquiry Into the proper route,
the feasibility and the cost of construc
tion of an Inter-oceanlc canal by a
Nicaraguan route. In view of over
ture made ti the governments cf Nic
aragua and Cota Rica, by other par
tie for a new canal concession pre
dicated on the assumed approaching;
lapse of the contracts of the Maritime
Canal company with those tat, I
have not hesitated to express my con
viction that consideration of expedi
ency and international policy as be
tween the several governments in
terested In the construction and con
trol of an Inter-oceanlc canal by this
route require the maintenance of the
status quo, until the canal commission
shall have reported and the United
State congress shall have the whole
matter during the present session,
without prejudice by reason of auy
change in tho existing condition.
Nevertheless, It appears that the
government of Nicaragua, a one of it
last sovereign acts before merging lta
power In those of the newly found
United State of Central America, haa
granted an optional concession to an
other association, to become effective
on the expiration of the present rrra.nl'.
It doe not appear what sprvey have
been made or what route is proposed
tinder thl contingent grant, so that an
examination of tho feasibility of It
plana 1 necessarily not embraced In
tne repeirt of the canal commission.!
All these circumstances suggest thai
urgency of some definite action by the'
congress at this session if the labors
of the past are to be utilized and the
linking of the Atlantic and Pailflo
oceans by a practical waterway U to
be realized. That the construction of
such maritime highway Is now more
than ever indispensable to that Intl.

doubt not the congress will duly ap
preciate and wisely act upon.
OUR RELATIONS WITH CHINA.
