Ere clil to the Iaiaapolis Journal.
Mcncie, Dec 10. This morning, at about
10 o'clock, Herbert, the five-year-old Bon of
Alfred Barton, was nearly decapitated by
the careless handling of a gun by bis txnele,
Harry Hubbard. The little boy was at the
homo of bis grandmother at Shedfown, a
suburb to this city, when Hubbard got his
shotgan and commenced cleaning it. The
child came np with the remark: 'Uncle
Henry, shoot me with that." To
please and amuse the boy Habbard pnt a
cap on one barrel of the gun and let the
hammer down with the mnzzle pointed at
the boy. Jn an instant a load of No. 8
shot had almost torn the head from the
boy's body, scattering his brains over the
'walls and ceiling of the room. The grief
stricken young man is nearly crazy at the
result of his carelessness. He gives the
same old excuse, "Didn't think it was.
loaded," but Coroner Driscoli's inquest
will likely result in the arrest of Hubbard
lor criminal carelessness. The victim's
father is an employe of J. H. Goddard, a
wholesale grocer.

ments which he proposed to offer to tho elections
bill.
Mr. Allison renewed tbe suggestion made by

directed by the committee on ways and means
to report a resolution for the distribution of the
t a
I'resiuem a annual message, and upon nis mo
tion the House resolved itself into committee of
the whole for its consideration. Though tech
nlcaUy the resolution should have been reported
to the House, by an inadvertence it was reported
to the committee of the whole.
Mr. Breckinridge of Kentucky made a point of
order acalnst this procedure, but withdrew the
point after explaining that he did not wish e.
precedent to be founded upon this action.
In response to a question by Mr. Hooker of

NEW YOBK CLEARING-HOUSE
Its Rules Cause Several Institutions to
Yithdaw from Its Conveniences.
Trust Companies Object to an Examination of
4 Their Affairs More Gold Coming from Eu
ropeLarge Number of Small Failures.
New York, Dec 10. Kountz Bros., the
bankers, will cense having their checks and
drafts sent through the clearing-house on
and after the 15th inst. They now, clear
through the American Exchange Bank.
Wells, Fargo & Co, express, who hereto
fore cleared through the Western National
Bank; have already discontinued availing
themselves of clearing-house facilities.
Checks and drafts, etc., of Wells, Fargo &
Co. or Kointz Bros, will therefore have to
ba 7iesented for payment directly to the
l;nu on which they are drawn, tho same as
in the case of tho Central Trust Company
aud other financial concerns which do not
ha ve or avail themselves of cleasing-house
privileges.
This withdrawing from the conveniences
of the clearing-house is believed to be due
to the new rule recently adopted by tne
Clearing-house Association, which requires
all banks or trust companies or other finan
cial concerns having clearing-house facili
ties through a medium of a member of tbe
association to pay $200 a year to the Clearing-house
Association, and submit their af
fairs to examination by tbe clearing-house
committee whenever the committee deems
it necessary to make such examination. It
is believed that in some cases the con
venience afforded is not actually worth
6200 a year to the company availing itself
of tho privilege. The examination ly the
clearing-1 ouse committee would be a cer
tificate to the soundness of the company ex
amined, but . some of the bis trust com
panies do not want such a ccrtiticate, and
they object, it is said, to exposing all their
business secrets to the clearing-house. t In
some cases it is declared to be an un willing
ness to let the banks know how much
wealth they havo got hoarded up in one
shape or another. This idea rinds special
credence now in view of the rumors that
vast sums of hard money are being hoard
ed up by trust companies and others.
r
Barker Bros. Ask an Extension,
Philadelphia, Dec. 10. The creditors of Bar
ker Bros. & Co., the bankers who made an assign
ment recently, have been asked to grant an ex
tension for one year. A paper to that effect has
been circulated amcuf: the creditors for several
days, and it is said a number of signatures have
been obtained. The principal creditors of the
firm are banks, trust companies and other finan
cial institutions, aud the officers havo signed the
paper. Barker Bros fc Co. have some valuable
assets, but in the present condition of the mar
ket it is impossible to realize much upon
them. A prominent trust company which be
gan suit against the firm some time ago has with
drawn it and signed tbe paper. There has been
no objection up to this time, and none is ex
pected.
Attheouice of the (jnanestor, Cincinnati &
Chicago railroad, No. 45 Broadway, New York,
it was stated to-day that tbe liabilities were
merely nominal; that outside of tbe bonded in
debtedness $25,000 to $40,000. would cover
everything. Barker Bros., of Philadelphia, and
other parties stood behind the road, taking its
bonds and furnishing money to go into construc
tion. When that firm failed the company had to
hold up on construction for the time being, but
it did not embarrass the operations of the road.
Failures In Tennessee. .
Claeksville, Tenn., Dec 10. The Franklin
Bank, of this city, suspended payment this
morning. The failure was caused by the recent
, failure of Henry Seafort, of New York, a large
tobacconist with whom the Franklin Bank had
been doing a large credit business. The Frank
lin Bank is a private bank. Its capital stock is
$50,000. Its liabilities amount to over $200,000
and the assets exceed the liabilities about $50,
OOO. The directors hope for an early settlement,
but the prospects are discouraging.
Kendnck,rettus &Co., a largo tobacco firm,
also made an assignment to-day. Tbe suspension
of the bank, in which the firm had large deposits,
and the stringency of the money market made it
impossible for the firm to meet their obligations,
and in order to protect all their creditors alike
they assigned. Their liabilities are over $400,-
OOO; the nominal asets esceed this amount. .
OA run on the Farmers and Merchants' National
Bank followed and the doors were closed. This
was caused by the other failures, but that Insti
tution will probably resume business in a day
or two. ,
Millions of Gold Coming from England.
New Yobk, Dec, 10. The amount of gold

come on the Lahn, which sails from South
ampton to-morrow, but it is reported at 350,
000, or say $1,750,000, which, if correct, would
make the total $5,000,000. But up to 12 o'clock
to-morrow, Thursday, gold oould be wltbdrawh
from tho Bank of England for shipment on the
Lahn, so that the total by to-morrow noon may
be greater than $5,000,000. This is the largest
amount for which any data can be found of ship
ments 60 far.

and second money shall bo paid, and when but
one starts only first money shall be paid. A
horse distancing the field shall only be entitled
to so much money as the starters in the race
could havo won.
Section 5 of the same article, as amended,
reads as follows: '
It shall be the duty of the executive committee
to encourage the holding of trotting meetings of
similar organizations throughout the country
nnder the auspices of the association, upon such
terms and conditions as to them shall seem meet
and Just
In a general discussion it was agreed the
association did not receive support necessary
to keep it alive, and J. C. Sibley, in speak
ing on tbe subject, said that unless some
vigorous measures were taken the associa
tion might as well disband. The outcome
of tbe discussion was the appointment of a
committee of three to confer with the sec
retary, and prepare an address to breeders
of the country asking their co-operation.
When the subject of stakes was intro
duced it provoked mnch discussion. W. H.
Wilson, referring to tbe standard stakes,
said that while be had opposed the plan at
hT6t be had finally accepted it when it be
came the law of the association. He had
tried it at Cynthiana and found that it
worked well. The standard stakes were
referred back to the executive committee
to perfect. S. A. Browne said that he
thought the association, to be kept up to the
times, should ofler a big stake, Heoved
a stake of $25,000 be Bpent for foals to be
trotted in 18W. This was carried," and it
was also decided to authorize the ottering
of four other stakes. Three of these are for
$3,000 each, and open respectively to iive-year-olds
that have not beaten 2:20 as four-year-olds;
to four-year-olds that have not
beaten !2:80ias three-year-olds, and to-three-year-olds
that have not beaten 2:40 as two-year-olds.
The other stake was one of 82,
500 for two-year-olds that have not beaten
3:00 as yearlings.

LOST IN THE BLACK SEA,
Pitiful Story of Shipwreck and Suffering
Bailors Frozen to Death at Tbelr Posts.
Philadelphia, Dec. 10. There has
reached this city, through a private channel,
the thrilling story of the loss of the British
steamship Westbnrn, in the Black sea.
Of the vessel's crew of twenty-five four
are all that survive the ill-starred voyage,
and they are miserable . wrecks of
humanity The Westbnrn, an ocean tramp
steamship, left Theodosia, southeast of
Crimea, Nov. 24, laden with linseed, bound
to Dunkirk and thence to Philadelphia
with a general cargo. On the evening of
her , departure a. gale peculiar to the
Black ' sea" alone arose. The weath
er ' grow eo intensely cold that the
men were frozen to death in a life-like
posture at the wheel or wherever their duty
called them. Every sea that swent over
the vessel froze to her, making her
sluggish , and so heavy that she
refused to ride tho waves and become un
manageable. v hen the water gained en
trance to the hold the cargo began to swell,
and burst open the decks fore and aft
as though powder had exploded in
her interior. . About midnight, al
though , only a few hours out of
port, the vessel began to go down.
Already the corpses of a number of sea
men were visible about the f deck, stand
ing up against tho hand-rails, just as
erect- as though in full vigor they
were frozen as hard as iron. With all the
crew that still held fast to their
lives Captain Bennington put out
a small boat and headed her
back to Theodosia, distant then some
lifty, mile s. During the.early morning the
men died off, one by one, until on reaching
Theodosia at night the number was
reduced to oight Subsequently four more
died while nndergoing medical treatment,
leaving but four survivors. Capt. Benning
ton, the commander of the Westbnrn, is
well kuownlto Philadelphia shipping men.
He is completely prostrated by his suffer
ings in the open boat and by the death
of his brother, the ship's chief officer,
who perished of the awful cold before his
eyes. ,

The Democratic ISrand of Reform.
Atlanta Constitution.
The whole truth is just this: When the
people indorse a party, that party has just
as much right to till the smallest office with
one of its own members as it has to till the
executive chair with its successful candi
date. The phrase To the victor belongthe
spoils'1 has been stufled and distorted until
all the mugwumps and frauds are ready to
fall in a tit when they hear it. To the suc
cessful party belongs the responsibility of
conducting tho government, and the gov
ernment cannot be conducted satisfactorily
by any party with its active enemies in
office If there is anything in Democratio
principles, as Mr. Cleveland seems to think,
then men who believo in these principles
and will carry them out ought to be placed
in offico when the party has charge of the
government. AUother civil-service reform
is a sham.

Nothing could more completely stamp the
Farmers7 Allianco as a Democratio organi
zation than its bitter condemnation of the
Lodge bill. It is distinctly and emphatic
ally a party measure. The two great
political parties of the country are, aud
nave been for some months, distinctly di
vided upon it, and along comes an organi
zation which sets itself np as non-partisan,
as superior to all political considerations,
and it throws whatever influence it may
possess for the Democracy. If the Alliance
is not an . adjunct to the Democracy then
what is itf . ' 1 . ;

If there is any one thing to which the He
publican party is thoroughly committed by
a long and practically unbroken chain of
declarations, it is t hat of providing in some
way for a free baUot and faircount in those
Eortions of the United States where tney
ave been denied. If the party does not
carry out its pledge iu this regard, then it
stands convicted either of insincerity and
hypocrisy or cowardice. And neither of
these qualities, we need not say, commend
either individuals or oganizations to the
favorablo consideration of the. American
people.
Cheap Books and Cheap Coats.

There is a parallel between cheap litera

people, mostly free-traders, refuse to see.
The literary man in America asks to be
shielded from the depressing effect of for

MAGAZINES OF THE MONTH.
The North American Keviewfor Decem
ber opens with some views of Senator Car
lisle on the recent election. Hon. Robert
P. Porter defends the correctness of the
eleventh census as against some of the
newspaper attacks .npon it "A Topic for
Christmas" is the title given by Sir Lionel
Playfair to a paper on the merits of arbi
tration as a settlement of international
difficulties. Mrs. Burton Harrison talks in
an entertaining way of "Maids and
Matrons in Modern Society," and of the
partial retirement of the former into the
background. Mr. C. 8. Messenger, Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spofford, Mrs, Amelia
E. Barr, Mrs. Henry Ward Beech-
erf Mrs. Mary A. Livermore and
Mrs. Alice Wellington Rollins discuss the
question. "Shall Our Daughters .Have
Dowries?" Mr. Messenger is the only one
to take the affirmative, and gets decidedly
the worst of it in argument. Algernon
Charles Swinburne contributes a review
of Victor lingo's "Reminiscences." Other
papers are: "The Future of Warfare," by
Captain Zalinski; "The Partition of Africa,"
by the Marquis of Lome; "Overproduction
in Securitie8,,, bv Erastus Wiman; "Dr.
Koch's Discovery," by Dr. Gibier, of the
New York Pasteur Institute, and "More.
Testimony against Shakspeare," by Ig
natius Donnelly.
"A Far Countree" is the title of a weird
and highly imaginative sketch in Decem
ber Outing. A hunter falls asleep after his
midday lunch and wakes np in a strange
land, where vegetable life is built on a
scale that dwaifs onr forests into mere
blades of grass in comparison, and where
animals and reptiles grow to gigantic pro
portions. As if to illustrate his power of
exaggeration, the writer says that one
morning he was awakened by a noise'tbat
shook tbe ground like an earthquake.
Creeping to tbe river's side, he saw a mon
ster batrachian seated on a water lily leaf.
Every time the frog croaked tbe earth
trembled, and no wonder, for the am
phibian stood forty feet out of water, and
Srobably as mnch more of bis body was un
erneath. The leaf itself must have cov-
ered nearly an acre of the river's surface.
To persons who are fond of the Jules Verne
style of literature the sketch will prove in
teresting. Outing's best feature is its
athletic sports department. It contains
this month an excellent article on foot-balL
Ralph Waldo Emerson has the place of
honor in the New England Magazine, his
portrait as frontispiece being followed by a
sketch of himself and his Concord friends,
by Frank B. Sanborn. Charles F. Dole an
swers the question 'What Shall We Do
with Our Millionaires!" by proposing that
they be asked to give largely and liberally
of their wealth for public benefit. If they
are not willing to give he thinks tbe
cultivation of a public opinion In favor of
their doing so will tend to make them a
notion that must seem rather visionary to
those who have noted the disposition of
millionaires to cling to their wealth while
life lasts. Archibald H. Grimke has an in
teresting historical paper on "Anti-slavery
Boston. Joshua W. Caldwell discusses
'Our Unclean Fiction." Other papers are
'A Day in the Yosemite with a Kodak,"
"Making Man-o'-war'e Men.'' "The Rev.
Henry Bronson." "Harvard's Better Self,"
"Kiog Philip's War," and several stories
and poems.
Ono of the most interesting articles in
the December Eclectic is an account by
Miss Menie Muriel Dowie of her horseback
trip through the Carpathian mountains.
Miss Dowie is the young woman whose pa
per, bearing on the same journey and read
before the Royal Geographical Society,
was received with so much surprised and
favorable comment. Two articles by Mr.
Gladstone are m the number one "On the
Recent Corroborations of Scripture from
the Regions of History and Natural
Science," the other on Mr. . Carnegie's
"Gospel of Wealth." Among other papers
are "Working Hours and Workingmen,"
"Prosper Merimee," "The Decay of Rnral
New England." "Stanley and Emin Pasha"
and 'Tuberculous Meat and Its Conse
quences." The Cosmopolitan, for December, cele
brates the Christmas month with an ac
count of the "Passion Play at Ober-Am-mergau,"
written by Miss Elizabeth Bis
iand in a very vivid style. Among the
portraits of the persons taking tbe leading
characters that of John is especially notice
able, tbe face being an ideal representation
of the beloved disciple. The designs on
the margins of the pages throughout tbe
magazine are all of scriptural subjects, and
form another Christmas feature. The liter
ary matter is all of an entertaining char
acter. Among the illustrated articles are:
James Grant Wilson's "Field Marshal Von
Moltke" and Lilian Whiting's "Literary
Boston."
Wide Awake appears in a Christmas
dress of new type, larger and clearer than
that formerly used. A permanent enlarge
ment to a hundred pages, beginning with
this issue, more than offsets the lessening
of the reading matter occasioned by the
use of enlarged type. The holiday issue
includes among its attractions tbe first
chapter of a new"Little Peppers" serial, by
Margaret Sidney. New features of a high
order are promised for the coming year. D.
Lothrop & Co., Boston.
There is not ranch that is new in the de
signs of Prang's Christmas cards and book
lets, the theme having been so thoroughly
worked by artists in past years as to leave
little room for original thoughts, but there
is a perennial attractiveness in the Christ
mas angels, the chubby children and the
flowers so daintily pictured, while in point
of coloring and finish a nearer approach to
perfection is reached every year. L. Prang

The Overland Monthly for December
opens with some reminiscences of early
California by John BidwelL Willard B.
Farwell discusses "Fremont's Place in Cal

The Farmers' Alliance undertakes to re
move the element of r uncertainty from
their organization, to establish a By stem of
discipline and insure the obedience of or
ders by punishing the disobedient The
Ocala platform, at last accounts, gave to the
president of the National Alliance the
power to suspend theeditorof any Alliance
paper which advocates any policy or any
measure in violation of the platform, and
an Alliance editor must get tne consent of
the president before publishing a State,
county or sub-Alliance organ. There is to
be no free-thinking, no kicking, no un
fettered press in tbe Alliance. The
orders must be obeyed as given,
or the editor is to be disciplined
by being bounced. From this it
appears that when the farmers go in for
business they do so to an extent which the
managers of other parties must look npon
with wonder, if not with envy. That mem
bers of the Alliauce have some fears of this
attempt to give the powers of a military
commander to the president is shown by
the amendment introduced on Saturday by
Governor-elect Buchanan, of Tennessee,
having in view the abolishment of this
power.
. It mast be said for the Alliance that if
its members know in which direction ther
wish to move, thearmv organization will
serve to expedite their movements, but
how long a party can exist which, after
all, has not the power to enforce enlist
ments, but which seeks to carry through
its measures with so high a hand, is an
other question. Its race is likely to bo
swift and short.
Prices of Heady-Made Clothing.
Lafayette Courier.
One of the most thorough and convinc
ing arguments to disprove the assertion so
frequently made by Democratio speakers
and newspapers .to the effect that there
will be a large advance in the price of
clothing on account of the McKinley bill,
is the brief and simple statement made by
the purchaser for the When clothing store
at Indianapolis. He buys for several estab
lishments of tbe same nme, located in dif
ferent cities, and the purchases are made
of tho manufacturers one year in advance
of delivery. The annual purchases of the
firm aggregate tbe sum of 82,000,000. Of
the 1,200 to 1.400 staples they handle, 125 are
quoted as low and the remaider lower than
heretofore for next year's products, and
tbe assurance is given that there will be no
advance in the retail price. The purchaser
of the farm alluded to is in no sense a poli
tician, and indeed we do not know with
what party he affiliates. The statement
was made in private conversation, but as it
furnishes incontrovertible evidence of the
misrepresentation and demagogy of the
misinformed opponents of the tan IT system
some of whom combine misinformation
with unadulterated maliciousness, the
Courier is not apprehensive that there is
any violent breach of confidence in pub
lishing a fact against which no specious
theory will stand.

,.No one doubts that Dr.
Sage's Catarrh Remedy really
cures Catarrh, whether the
disease be recent or of long
standing, because the makers
of it clinch their faith in it
with a $500 guarantee, which
isn't a mere newspaper guar
antee, but "on call" in a
moment.
That moment is when you
prove that its makers can't
cure you.
The reason for their faith
is this:
Dr. Sage's remedy ' has
proved itself the right cure
for ninety-nine out of one
hundred cases of Catarrh in
the Head, and the World's
Dispensary Medical Associa
tion can afford to take the
risk of your being the one
hundredth.
The only question is are
you willing to make the test,
if the makers are willing to
take the risk ?
If so, the rest is easy. You
pay your druggist 50 cents
and the trial begins.
If you're wanting the $500
you'll get something better
