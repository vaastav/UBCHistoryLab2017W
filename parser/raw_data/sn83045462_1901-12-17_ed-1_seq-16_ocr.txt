LABOR UNION PROTESTS
REWOLUTIONS DENOUNCING IMPRIS
ONMS"NT OF IGLBSAS.
Commumleasseu Front Brothebrhoe 09
EIeetrleal Workers- Iodeueoe-Coin
mittee an District SiEr'age.
The'Central Labor Union, at its meeting
last evening, Indorsed resolutions recently
adopted by Colulabia Typographical Union
denouncing the imprisonment by a court in
Porto Rico of Santiago Iglesias and other
members of labor organizations.
The resolutions recite that "by the en
fcreement In the courts of Porto Rico of
the old and brutal Spanish laws whereby'
trade organizations are declared illegal and
members thereof are treated as conspira
tors," and as "such laws are In direct vio.
lation of the rights of laboring men and
are opposed to the interests of individual Ub
erty and our republican form of government
-a clear abridgment of the 'privileges ani
immunities of the citizens of the United
States." as mentioned in section one of the
fourteenth amendment of the Constitution.
and as Santiago Iglesias, president of the
Federation of Workmen of Porto Rico and
local organizer of the American Federation
of Labor of the Unitcd States, together
with seven of his colaborers in the cause
of unionism, have been arrested, convicted
and sentenced to terms of Imprisonment
upon the- charge of conspiracy for endeav
oring to have the price of labor raised to
correspond with the increase in the price
of commodities occasioned by the change In
the currency of the island from pesos to dol
lars-an increase of 40 per cent;" therefore,
"Columbia Typographical Union, No. 101,
hereby condemns such laws as barbarous
and as a relic of Spanish tyranny, and peti
ticns Congress for their Immediate repeal
and the substitution of a new and enlight
ened code to conform to the Constitution
and statutes of the United States."
The officers of the union "file an emphatic
porotest with tte President of the .United
States against the carrying into effect of
the sentences."
Protest Indorsed.
The un!on also indorsed a letter which
will be forwarded by the local Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers to the labor organI
zations of the country protesting against
the bill recently introduced in Congress
providing for the examination and licensing
of electrical workers. The organizations
are requested to communicate with their
respective senators and representatives in
Congress and ask them to oppose the meas
ure.
The objections to the bill, as stated in the
letter. are that its enactment would result
In the classifleation of electrical workers
by an examining board and a consequent
rating of wages in many instances below
the prevailing rate; that it will prohibit the
organization from establishing a uniform
wage scale and thus infringe upon the
right and nullify the purpose of trade or
ganization.
"To further the movement to secure the
right of suffrage In the District" the fol
lowing committee, composed of delegates
from each of the allied organizations, was
selected: Milford Spohn, Edward Burley, J.

NEW NATIONAL T lATNt1.-The Rog
era Brothers' how is on0 of the aggrea
tion of costumes and comedy which swoop
down upon a town and dassle it Into a state
of irresponsible hilarity. The mood which
It Induces is something like hypnotism At
certain times people step to the front of
the stage and Indicate that It Is time to
laugh or to applaud, and you proceed to
.comply with the suggestion without the
faintest effort to exercise personal volition.
The entertainment starts when Maurice
jAvi takes up the conductors baton. Mr.
Levi is the man who' made the music. He
has that quality so desirable in a musical
conductor-individuality. He In an effer
vescent fountain of enthusiasm. He is not
satisfied with the customary domain of the
orchestra leader. Like Alexander, he has
longed for new .worlds to conquer. Having
brought the orchestra Into a state of mag
netic responsiveness, he proceeds to wave
his baton at the chotr of whistlers In the
gallery, with the result that- the .melody
woven about the latest affairs of our old
friend Reuben -is discoursed with great vol
ume and unstinted fluency. Mr. LevY's nw
sie takes on additional charm when per
formed under his personal direction. His
own interest in it-is infectious, and it might
readily be believed that he is composing it
all over again as he goes.along.
The -musical diector attracts attention
first because he Is early in the field. He
gets to work before the curtain goes up.
The stage reveals to view a splendidly at
tired galaxy of chorus girls. and a glittering
constellation of specialty performers. The
Rogers Brothers' songs and comic dialogue
are, as usual, the chief attractions. The
stage waits for the two comedians; the
audience yearns fot them when they are
absent from the scpe, and is loath to let
them disappear, although some of the other
entertainers were the recipients last night
of handsome allowances of applause. In
this ieason's skit the brothers venture a
little way out of New York, and call the
show "The Rogers Brothers in Washing
ton." They are in Washington only a little
while, and so far as any loeal color is con
cerned might as well be in Jersey City or
Hoboken. The Capitol, the fountain in the
Botanical Garden and the Peace monument
are all represented as nestling In affection
ate proximity, and one of 'the characters
expresses surprise that the President does
not come forth from the Capitol building.
There Is also an allusion to the mint and
other reminders that the rialto of New
York Is hopelessly remote from the affairs
of national interest, and that the libret
tist's library, copiously supplied as It may
be with costume plates, Is shy in guide
books. These blunders do not interfere
with the flow of fun; they merely prevent.
the piece from being the clever travesty
which the title would suggest and leave the
responsibilities for the incessant hilarity
with the players themselves.
The Tammany Hall scene In the first act
lends Itself less happily to extravaganza
effects than does the Buffalo exposition
scene in the last. The piece is built strict
ly on the lines of the Wall street and Cen
tral Park skits in which the Rogers Broth
ers made their previous successes.
The array of talents on the stage Is lu
minous and varied. Songs and dances are
tumbled out of an exhaustless cornucopia
of comic Invention, and there is no style of
taste which cannot lay hold of something
that tickles the fahcy.
Entertaining specialties are contributed
by Miss Williams, Miss Begeard, William
West, Emma Francis, Pat Rooney and oth
ers.
COLUMBTA THEATER.-Andrew Mack
has perhaps the most congenial part of
his stage career as Tom 'Moore. In the
play of that name at the Columbia Thea
ter last night Mr. Mack was greeted by an
audience which, while friendly at the start,
soon became wonderfully enthusiastic. As
the player stated in a little curtain speech
after the second act, he is a comparative
stranger In Washington, but after the
hearty ovation accorded him during the
evening it would seem that his comings to
Washington had been altogether too in
frequent In the past. There have been
many plays written of the time when Tom
Moore, Robin Dyke, Sheridan. the famous
wit; Beau Brummel, the fashion plate, and
the Prince Regent of England were con
temporaries and companions, but it has re
mained for Mr. Mack to bring out Tom
Moore as the central and predominating
figure In a stage production. The play for
the most part is a delightful little comedy,
abounding In terse lines and heroics. The
tribulations of the Irish poet, leading up
to the time when the Prince of Wales was
prevailed upon to accept the dedication of
his first book, are dealt with In interesting
fashion. Of course history has not been
the sole source for the many pleasing inci
dents that have been introduced into the
play. The idea of the author has been to
give Mr. Mack a happy part and an In
teresting vehicle. In both purposes he has
succeeded admirably. During the four acts
of the comedy Mr. Mack sings a number
of songs, among them several of Moore's
most popular poems set to music. Many
of the rhythmic rhymes are quoted also to
give a touch of realism to the personage
in whom all interest centers. In the first
act Tom Moore is seen courting the pretty
Mistress Dyke of the district school of
Dalky. Ireland. Here he sings his "Song
Games" and has a hilarious time with the
children. The scenes between Tom Moore
and the boys and girls are delightfully
handled and the audience gave itself up
to wholesome laughter. It Is about the
brightest outfit of stage children ever got
together. The next acts show Moore in his
garret, In London, despondent. Then comes
his success with the Prince of Wales. The
third act sees him In seemingly inextrica
ble trouble, but In the fourth the clouds
are all swept away as by a master strokce
-and the play ends with the Irish bard the
poet laureate of England. In' Mr. Macks
supporting company are two players well
known In Washington, Theodore Babcock
and Myron Calice. The stage characters
with whom all playgoers are familiar,
Beau Brummel, Sheridan and the others,
are In capable hands. Josephine Lovett
is the leading woman.
AN ENEMY TO THE KING.--Several
members of the Bellows Stock Company
won additional laurel~s last night for their
work in Robert N. Stephens' romantic
drama, " An Enemy to the King." Oppor
tunity for the display of the versatile tal
ents of the comrpany is afforded in this
spir4 ted play of the stirring times of Henry
of Navarre, when that Impulsive, chival
rous and daring young ruler gathered
about -him a crew as reckless, as Impet
uous.- and courageous as hls engaging self.
What a time it was, to be sure, when the
business of a gentleman was apparently
onytom make love in a delightful but en
tryirresponsbe manner; to draw rapier
askance from another man; to ride fast and
[drink hard, bully lackeys, and toss whole
purses full of golden pieces to wandering
mendicants; to intrigue and plot and coun
terplot and of course have 'all turn out well
for those In whom the sympathies are en
listed.
The story of "An Enemy to the King" Is
unfolded quickly In the play and holds the
attention of the auditors from the begin
ning t othe end, save for one poignant but
happily brief period when a quintet holds
the stage to broaden farce into buffoonery.
Given a beautiful and filial young woman
who would secure the release of her father
from prison; a handsome, dashing. cavalier,
follower of Navarre, who is wanted Dy the
governor of the province; a bargain for the
release of the father if the woman will be
tray the cavalier, with wrhom she has
meantime fallen in love, tinaware of his
identity; a villainous side-plot by the gov
ernor's secretary (John r. Sullivan, of
course) for the possession of the woman; a
bunch of fighting, soystering youngsts,
and there's the nucleus of some stirring ac
tion.
It is worked out successfully b~ the Bel
lows Stock Company. White 'httlesey
delighted the audience as Ernanton de Lau
nay, the Huguenot captain who foiled the
plotters and won his sweetheart from the
very castle hall of the governor, Mr. SuAli
van's Montignac, the crafty secretary, was
a congenial role carried with his usual sue
cess, Charles Wyngte as Diase~ Tripault,
the cavalier's faithl follower, developed a
plangs vein of humor.
Lilian Lairrence as Julie de Yarlon, the
daughter and repentant spy -when love for
her sweetheart outweighed the filial tie,
was effectively statuesque. The play was
ansomely staged and eostnmed and was
witnessed by a lerge adnes.a

almost intact. The performance begins
with the well-worn burletta, "Mrs. Gro
gan's Pink Tea," which tells of a kissing
trust. Later on James Grundy and Sher
man Coates, the clever colored singing and
dancing comedians, Introduce "The Water
melop Trust," and the fun is fast and con
tinuous. The ollo is fairly strong and em
braces the Batchelor Sisters, who sang,
danced and played the violin cleverly; Con
roy and Keeler, in a sketch; Josie LeCoy, in
songs; Farnum and Nelson, in their well
known acrobatic turn; Collins and Collins,
punsters and parodists, and Fred Leslie's
dog circus. The sensational leaping of the
dogs was the chief attraction of the last
number. The program closed with a skit
entitled "King of the Boo Gee Boos," which
g ave opportunity to the-chorus to appear In
fetching costumes, dance and sing.
THE NEVADA CONCE2RT.-The tour of
Madame Nevada, who will be heard here
Thursday afternoon at the New National
Theater, has so far surpassed the most
sanguine expectations of her managers.
Madame Nevada's singing of the "Chanson
du Mysoli," from Felicien David's "La
Perle du Bresil," the Bell Song from
"Lakme"~ and other numbers chosen by her
for the program Is said to have been de
lightful. The company supporting her
also received its share of applause. Pablo
Cascal's playing of several fine numbers
for the violoncello and Leon Moreau's
rendittion of selections by Liszt, Cho
pin and some of his own composititons
ha stamped these two artists as genuine
virtuosi. The work of Daniel Maquarre,
the flutist, and Heathe Gregory, the basso,
has also -been well received.

held yesterday at the austom house in th
Georgetown poet ofioe butlding. The sale,,
which remsembled a rummage affair, was con
ducted in the underground vaults of the
building, where a crowd of over 100 people
assembled, all eager to secure Christmsb
In nearly every case the articles
ered for -sale- brought good prices, and
the sale netted the government somewhere
In the neighborhood of $700.
The Sale was - aonducted by Charles G.
.Sloan, auctioneer. A number.-of consign
-ments were dispased of; Including several
fine ftru-from the Treasury Department.
which'had been -elsed by tAe government,
and which, It was feared, would e -ruined
If kept In stocage the full length of time.
A handsome ealskin coat caused much
spirited biddiag among the many ladies
present at the sale. The coat Is alleged to
have been bought from a well-known Can&
dian firmr and was smuggled in turn across
the border. It was 'appraised at $275, but
brought $280 at the sale. -
A blue fox muff and boa brought the next
best price, bringing about Its appraised
vblue.
Recollections- of our forefathers arose
when two old-fashioned - grandfather's
cidcks were sold under the hammer. The
clocks -were made- In -Germany and brought
a -ancy prIce.
Two wax figures-one representing .
United States letter carrier In full dniform,
an excellent reproduction, and the other
figure an Alaskan mail carrier, typically
dressed in hood and furs-were next sold,
'bringing good prices.
Several cases of books were disposed of.
They were all printed In foreign languages
and were not regarded as worth much by
the bidders. The lots went from 10 cents
to $1 each. A package of silk, containing
sufficient material for a skirt, waist and
one other garment, started at $2, and was
finally sold for $11.50. A model of arms,
made of wood, and occupying a small space,
but representing much labor, went for the
small sum of 10 cents.
The cigars offered brought good prices,
averaging $10 per hundred. The quality
was not guaranteed. . Fifty-six packages of
Havana cigarettes brought a good price. A
package of medical preparations, contain
ing. unknown quantities and qualities,
brought 10 cents, while two cases of arti
ficial stone realized a- like amount. A half
dozen mechanical toys were finally sold for
$3.50, and after the purchaser secured the
box the toys commenced moving around in
the cramped space at a rate that ended
disastrously -for the automat4c playthings.
A quantity of beaded bags, silk and span
gled, and dress trimmings were sold in one
lot, despite the protest of some ladies who
wanted the pieces sold individually. They
were invoiced at. $91 and brought $&50 at
the sale. A quantity of alabaster busts,
statuettes and the like were the last- of
fered for sale. A statue of the "Diving
Girl," appraised at $16, which with 50 per
eent duty. would make its total value $24,

many as the greatest bargain of the entire.
sale. A number of other alabaster orna
ments brought -prices ranging from $2 to
$4.50, the last being a batch of seyeral
pieces Which brought nearly $25.

Impaired Digestion
Way not be all that is meant by DYSPEPSIA
now, but It will be if neglected.
The uneasiness after eating, fits of nervous head.
ache, sourness of the stomach, and disagreeable
belching may not be very bad now, but they will
be if the stomach is suffered to grow weaker.
Dyspepsia Is such a miserable disease that the
tendency to it should be given early attention.
This is completely overcome by
Hood's SarsaparillIa
which strengthens the whole digestive system.
