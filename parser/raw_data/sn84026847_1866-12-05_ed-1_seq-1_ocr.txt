The Vir Era.
Our neighbor of the Imtolligenctr joins
with the radicals in Congress in sneer
,ng a* the constitution of the United
States ami and treating with disrespect
the teachings of Washington, Jkkfku
son, J.m'KSon, and other sages whose
wisdom gave to our country all the
glory it ever attained. He thinks that
the constitution has nothing to do with
the settlement of the political questions
now agitating the people, and that
there never was a sage equal to Tll.\l>.
Stkvkxs in wisdom, or to the defeated
aspirant for Senatorial honors in this
State and District for patriotism and

West Virginia's Future.
1 Miring the progress of the recent po-j
litical campaign, we endeavored to show
that the programme of the Radical
party would involve, when carried out,
the destruction of the State of West
Virginia. Their theory of Str* - suicide,
v.e sought to show, would impair the
validity of the proceedings by which
West Virginia became a State, because if
that theory werecorrect, Virginia could
not have given a legal consent to her own
division. The developments of Radical I
policy, now being made at Washington, j
show clearly that we were correct in de
claring that the idea of State sui
? ide was a favorite one with Radi
cal leaders. Accounts from the
capital agree in saying that those
leaders are disj>osed to proceed upon
Mr. Stkvrns' idea that the Southern,
States were reduced by their rebellion '
t>> a territorial condition, and should be I
governed now by Congressional author- j
if v. If *t?i? i,v?a 1,0 incorporated iuto j
our national legislation, what becomes j
of this voting State of ours, which all
parties are so anxious to preserve?
If. as is claimed, Virginia forfeited
her i ? .i i>v ju.r rebellion, she lias j
since that time been isii.tpublc of any i
sovereign act, such as giving consent t.> j
le-r own disintegration. If, since her!
secession. Virginia has ceased to be a
State, the (ioveruiueiit under which !
West Virginia was formed was)
no' State Government. The act j
of 1 1 i \ ; s ? ? ? : i was the act of a ile- ]
pi rule-it territory, and lacks legality I
1 the creating power did not pos- 1
sess the requisite sov ereignty. In short, j
if the Stkvkns idea be true, and Vir
ginia no State, then West Virginia, re
lying for existence upon the continued
sovereignty of the mother State, ceases
to lie a State, because Virginia was not.
at tin- time of consent, in a condition to
agree to her own division. If this view
be incorrect, if the proposed Radical pro- j
gramme does not assail the continued j
existence of West Virginia, we
should like to be appiizcd of our error, j
According to our understanding of the
sase, not only are the integrity and
jM-rpi-tuity of West Virginia seriously)
j htcatcned. but the danger comes from
the very quarter whence have always
cmauated the warmest assurances of fi
delity to her interests. The Radical
party whose lenders here have proclaim
ed theiiiselv?ui the special champions of
the new State, appears to be the source
from which a deadly assault upon the
lit'.- of West Virginia is about to come.
Thr Conciliation
The way to tin- solution of all tlie
dittieulties that Waet the domestic
attaint of our nation is plain and simple :
let all the Departments of the Govern
ment obey tlie Constitution of the Uni
ted States. Obedience to the require
ments of the written Constitution will
lieal nil the diseases of the body politic j
and plant health and strength where!
now there is infirmity and weakness, i
!.*i but the Constitution be obeyed: let I
'lie solemn compact be fulfilled; let the
people only stand by their plighted j
fuitli: and our difficulties will vanish,
"lie nation will enter upon a new career j
? ?f prosperity aud peace.
In addition to the advantages this
conrse would afford ; in .addition
to the acknowledged truth that
'? Honesty is the best pol iVjr,"
viewing the question merely in a self
ish light; the people of the 1'nited
Stales are l>ouud by solemn to
"bey the constitution. Tliey are not
left to their own option, whether they
will obey it or not. In addition to the
promptings of interest, they are com
liy a sense of duty to revere the
teachings of tin* organic law of the na
tion. and if they would violate it they
cannot do so without being guilty of
crime. To the advantages accruing
from the observance of the principles
enunciated by the founders of our gov
ernment is added the imperative and
delilH-ratel v assumed obligation of every
officer of the government.
lu addition to both these reasons why
the constitution should be obeyed, we
have the advice and counsel of the
wisest men and parest statesmen who
have ever lived in the United States,
all exhorting and beseeching the people
guard and maintain the principles of
government established by that instru
j ment. Th? whole lino ofonr illnstrious
i men, from the founders of the govern
' ment ilown to tlio last of those who
I earned a title to the nation's love, ap
l peal to the people to revere and obey
1 the written constitution.
Under these circumstances, it must
s< cut strange that men who profess to
' desire the peace and prosperity of the
| nation are found violating the plainest
precepts set forth in the constitution;
j sneering at or utterly ignoring the in
' strumeut they have sworn to support;
setting at naught the teachings of the
men whom the pebplehave delighted to
honor; disregarding the. interests ami;
welfare of the nation, aud taking coun
sel alone from the passion and mad
ness of the hour. Yet such is
the fact. The leaders of the radical
party in Congress and the organs
of opinion in tho country at large no
longer seek to conceal the fact that
, they havo renonuced the Constitution,
and will not be guided by the princi
| pies it sets forth. They speak of the law
I they sulemly swore to obey, as lieing now
! effete, worn out and useless, inapplica
! lde to the present condition of affairs,
i and unworthy of their regard. They
1 despise the counsels of the great men of
I the past, and affect to consider them
5 selves, even when blinded by the fury
I of party rage, far wiser, and much
better statesmen thau ever before had
birth. Their assumptions of power
know no limit nor bound; they claim
tho right to do whatsoever they pleusc,
whatsoever their partisan necessities
may demand, and they trample down
all barriers, whether human or Divine,
that stand between them and the ac
complishment of their desires. Under I
their control, instead of a constitutional [
I republic, we have an unlimited despot
ism; a despotism which is all the]
worse in that instead of only one we
i have a multitude of tyrants. The will
of a faction is the only law now gov
l l ining the nation. The dictates of par
ty have superseded the constitution, the
demands of radicalism are more imi<er
lative than the oaths that have been
J sworn for the maintainanco of what
| was once known as "the supreme |
law of the land;" tho dominion of the
just principles of government ordained
by our fathers has passed away; and, in
j tho new order of things, the test of loy
alty to the government is the ability of
the subject to pronounce the shibboleth
I of radicalism aright.
This is the natural and inevitable |
I cousequence of departure from the prin
ciples of the constitution. If we would
[regain the liberty onr government was
founded to secure, we must return to
onr allegiance to the constitution.
Thiie is no other way; there can he no
other mode of redress. Our itational
difficulties will prow nmre and
more embarrassing ami u
our woes will be more andj
more increased; and the chains will
lie drawn upon us still tighter, until
the constitution is again obeyed as the
contract between tho government and
the people.

MiguiUcnut Atlmi??iou of n lCnilical
Leader.
The Hon. Henry B. Stanton, of New
York, husband of Mrs. E. Caily Stanton,
ami a radical of the first water, made a
speech at the meeting of extreme radi
cals in National Hull, Philadelphia,
the other night, from which we take
the following extract :
The recent elections show that in the
free States the Republicans were hack
ed by a population of about eleven mil
lions. while the Democrats were sus
tained l?y a population of about
nine millions. This gave the lie
publicans a majority of two mil
lions of the people in the free States.
In the slave States, excluding the
negroes, and judging by their latest
elections, the Democrats represent a
population of ahout six and a half mil
lions, while the Republicans are sustain
ed l?y only a million and a half. This
gave the Democracy a majority of Ave
millions of people in the slave States.
Thus, North and South, the Democrats
represented fifteen and a half millions
of the population, and the Republicans
twelve and a half millions, giving the
former a majority of three millions.
The Republican voters in the free
States amount to about two millions,
while the Democratic voters number
one million, six hundred thousand, thus
giving a Republican majority of four
hundred thousand. In the slave States
the Democratic vote is about eleven
hundred thousand. Thus North and
I South, the Democrats had two million
seven hundred thousand voters, and the
Republicans two million two hundred
I thousand, giving the former a majority
of half a million. According to these
figures it apiH-ars that the Democracy
I had (including southern negroes) a
1 majority over the Republicans in the
whole nation of three millious of peo
ple, and five hundred thousand voters;
and that nearly all the available polit
ical strength of tLe Republicans was in
the North, while that of the Democrats
: was ditlused in about equal proportions
j over both North and South. Sow, he
affirmed, that mo fink gcctional party

THE CAUCUS.
Tho first Congressional Repnbliaui
caucus was held last night. They had
a tumultuous time. Everybody who
hail any thing to say against the Presi
dent was vociferously cheered, and no
one atteinted to say anything in his
[ favor.
Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, was called to
the chair, and Mr. Anderson, of Illinois,
was appointed Secretary.
The first man 011 the floor was Thad.
Stevens, who suggested that a commit
tee of nine bo appointed to report a pro
gramme of action to the joint caucus of
the House and Senate, which is to meet
|on Wednesday evonipg. Ho merely
wished, he said, to make tho suggestion.
He wished some one else to make the
motion, because he did not want to be
chairman of the committee.
Several gentlemen insisted that the
uiotion should be put as coming from
'I'll ad. Steveiw, and it was so done. 'firs
made Thad. Stevens chairman of tho
committe.
The committee was then appointed ;
it consists of Messrs. Stevens, Sclienck,
IE. 1$. Washburn, Boutwell, Pike, Hart,
Allison, Paine and Ortli. On motion
Mr. Uarlield was added, making ten in
all.
The next subject taken up was the
Congressional reception to come oil' to
morrow. The programme was an
nounced. Colfax was appointed to re
spond to tho welcome speech 011 behalf
of tho House.
Thad. Stevens was appointed to re
spond in behalf of the House, at the
banquet 011 Monday night.
This matter having been disposed of,
Thad. Stevens offered a resolution that
the Republican members of the Senate
be requested not to confirm any ap
pointees of the President when thev
were removed for political purposes.
A perfect storm of applause followed]
this. Desks were rattled and hands
clapped, when Mr. Spalding, of Ohio,
had the temerity to rise and questiou
the rightfulness <>f the proposition, lb
did not see how ho could vote for any
such request. He believed the Senate
was as well acquainted with the needs ;
of the, country as the House was, and
that Senators knew as well as Repre
sentatives what was best tobedouoin
such an emergency.
This drew Thad. Steveus from his
chair. He jumped like an acrobat, and,
as he took the floor, he was liberally
applauded in advance, his sentiments
being easily anticipated. He pitched
into Spaulding in a terrible way. Said
he :
"We aro the representatives of the
people, and we know quite as well as
the Senate what tho country demands.
We have a right to advise the Senate,
and as wo are fresh from the people, we
ought to know what the people want."
In conclusion, Thad. cast u withering
look at Spalding, aud quietly remarked
tfuu he didJM# Jcntw wlint, selfifJi .BUJ
pose that gentleman had in view. He
Ji.lu't k u?*w TMOatiM vniaio. .
lilled in Ohio. He beard of a Judge
ship. or something of that sort, but lie
hoped that the representatives of the
people would stand up to the work be
fore them, and do it as became men of
principle and courage.
Judge Kclle.y, of Philadelphia, was
glad the resolution had been offered.
He didn't know how it was in other
parts of the country, but in his city the
appointing |power had been horribly
abused. Many men whom he, as crim
inal Judge, had sentenced to the Peni
tentiary, had been appointed to offices
of high trust aud profit, aud he woe wil
ling to take the risk of requesting the
Senate not to confirm any such appoint
ment."..
One case especially occurred to Juuge
Kelley, just then. It was that of a man
who had once stolen a steam engine
from the navy-yard and hidden it some
where. lie was found out, and brought
it back as soon as the matter was
hushed up. He stole it again, lie had
since then stolen all the copper and
metal ho could carry off. He was one
of tho President's appointees.
Several members hero said that was
nothing to what had' been done in their
districts. One man said the Collector
in his district stolo a house and lot.
Another said the Assessor where lie lived
had been arrested once or twice for
picking pockets. A third said that the
postmaster of his town was known to
have stolen twenty grindstones.
Mr. Darling of New York took the '
floor. He could heartily concur in all |
thai hail been said in the abuse of the j
appointing power in his district, fliel
most worthless anil incapable men had !
been selected for official positions. He
said he would not faithfully represent |
his district if he did not use his intln- !
ence to prevent the continuation of ,
such men in office. |
Hereupon the caucus resolved itself
into a sort of Methodist mass meeting, j
only that, instead of telling each other
what the Lord had done for them, they j
related what the Devil, in the person of
Andrew Johnson, had been at since the
adjournment of Congress. Such a list .
of wooe never was given out. !
Finally, the resolution was passed |
unanimously, even Mr? Spalding not vo- i
ting against it, satisfied that it would
not be safe to do so.
Thad. Stevens then rend his bill about
appointments and removals, which he
intends to oiler at an early day. It pre
vents removals without the consent of
the Senate, denies payment of all re- ,
jected by the Senate, and prevents tliem !
from hoiuing office for three years after ?
such rejection. Every provision in it
w as applauded to the echo. I
Mr. Spalding moved that the commit
tee Ik? instructed to report upon the ex
pedieney of calling the Fortieth Con- ,
gress together on the ">th of March.
n Mr. Garfield jumped up aud said he ,
had a bill for convening the Fortieth
Congress on the 4th of March at 12
o'clock already drawn np. He intended j
to press it early. He said lie believed j
the watch-dogs of the nation ought to
kept 1 11 guard all the time. [Great ap
plause for the watch-dogs by the watch
dogs themselves.] |
Mr. Boutwell, of Massachusetts, said
he intended to offer a resolution at an
earlv dav calling upon Seward and
Johnson for any correspondence in their
possession on the subject of the attempt
to arrest John Snrratt, the eseajMtl coti- j
sjtirator. Ho had good reason to believe j
that Johnson know all the time where
Surratt was, and had not only inado no j
attempt to arrest liiiu, but had connived
at his escape. This statement was loud- j
ly applauded.
* Mr. Bontwell then said thst there ;
should l>e a joint committee of the '
House and Senate appointed to.inve?t4- j
gate the pnblio acts of Johnson from :
the days of his drunken inauguration as '
Viee President down to the present I
time. [Groat applause ] Ho said the
country demanded this, aud demanded,
further, that if there was enough in his
conduct to justify articles of impeach
ment. he should be impeaehod at once.
Another stonn ot applause rose here
and lasted several minutes, Mr. Jiout
well speaking all the time, but nobody
| being able to hear hi in.
I Thad. Stevens then rose and said be
I heartily seconded -what Mr. Boutwell
j had said on this subject. After a few
! general remarks, ho said ho had been
j conservative last session, [langhter,]
but he meant to be radical hencefor
ward. When ho went home last summer,
i lie found the people of his district com
plaining against him because he had
beon conservative. He meant to be up
with the people hereafter. There was
no use in talking ? the jieople were now
ahead of Congress in this matter. He
did not mean they should be ahead of
him much longer.
[From the Detroit Tribune, Saturday.]
Frightened into Inaanity ? The Party
n Rtitidful of Warnaw, N. Y.
On Thursday evening a well-dressed
woman from Warsaw, Wyoming county,
New York, arrived in this city via the
Grand Trunk Railway, intending to go
to Mattawan, a small village on the
Central Railroad. Instead of changing
ears at the Junctiou, as she should have
done, she came to the Detroit depot, and
upon being informed that she could uot
leave for her destination before 11 o'clock
1'. M., she concluded to remain in the
ladies' sitting room, to which apartment
she was shown by Policeman Whitman,
nud told to make herself comfortable.
Subsequently the officer started all the
! "bummers" and loafers out of the depot,
j leaving the woman referred to alone,
j At a late hour, several unknown per
son stepped into the station and imme
diately passed out again. This excited
the woman's suspicions, and she at once
began to entertain fears that all whs
; not right. Her suspicions were heigton
! ed by the movements of a number of
loafers who were constantly looking in
at t lie windows, and at a late hour
I she became so thoroughly frightened
that she dared remain no longer, got out
side the building, and starting down
Woodbridge street, where she sought
protection in a house, but not liking the
appearance of things there, and being
thoroughly frightened, she left. Once
more upon the street, and in a very lone
ly locality, she was accosted by a man,
1 and supposing that she had been follow
'? ed from the depot, she cried for help,
! and was taken in charge by a policeman,
! who conveyed her to the station. Upon
1 arriving at the latter place sin' mani
fested symptoms of insanity, but gave
rational answers to all questions asked
| her. During the night she was taken
quite ill and became a raving lunatic,
and was yesterday taken to St. Mary's
Hospital. When lirst taken to the Sta
tion House she gave her residence, the
name of her friends, and stated that she
had always lived in the country, that
she had never been in a large city, and
was consequently not famliar with the
world She also stated that this was
her lirst visit from home, and having
missed the train, fretted greatly, which
was undoubtedly the cause of her ill
ness.
The Untile of Dnnkxbnrg.
The following amusing account of a
battle that occur ro<l in the wilds of
Missouri has not j ot taken its appropri
ate place in the history of the rebellion:
"The village of Dunksburg is situated
in tbe northeast corner of Pettis county,
Missouri, and very near the stream
known as the Rlack Water. In the
southeast part of Lafayette county, and
immediately in the neighborhood of
Dsnksborg, there is a larg* Cfennan
?oUlwiMit. From the very o?wimene?<
luent of the troubles In Missouri the
Germans have Lcen loyal to the govern
ment, and as they were the first against
whom the vengeance of the secessionists
was directed, they were tl??* first to toko
up arms in defense of their adopted
country, and a small company of some
forty or fifty banded themselves togeth
er for the purpose of self-defence, mak
ing the church at Dunkshurg their tem
porary headquarters. Late one aftcr
uoon they were notified of the approach
of a considerable body of rebels from
l'ottis and Saline counties, and they
prudently determined to retreat from
the position they held in the church, be
lieving that they would be unable to
defend it against greatly superior num
bers.
"The attacking party, not aware that
the Germans had retreated, advanced
cautiously, under cover of night, and by
a dexterous movement succeeded in
surrounding the church, and at a signal
agreed on, immediately commenced a
heavy tire upon tin* building, which be
ing only weather-boarded with thin
pine or poplar plank, offered scarcely
any resistance to the bullets, which were
rapidly discharged from rifles and shot
guns, and which, parsing through and
through the house, killed and wounded
many of the assailants. Uuprepared
for what they mistook for a vigorous
defense on the part of tlis Germans,
after considerable loss in killed and
wounded, they retreated to their campa
short distance oft'; but dissatisfied with
the result, and believing it entirely. in
their power to capture the small torce
which had peppered them so severely,
they determined to return to thcchargc,
and to carry the church at the point of
the bayonet.
"The same precaution was used in
making their advances for the second
attack, and they completely snrronnded
the building before the word was given
to fire. Greatly to their astonishment,
at the first volley many of their men
were killed, and being in close proxim
ity to the building, several were serious
ly wounded by splinters, which were
scattered in every direction by balls
passing through the house. The fire
was so destructive that no time was lost
in forcing the doors, with the purpose
of making a finish of all the Dutch in
side; but greatly to their disappoint
ment aud mortification, they discovered
that there was not a single Dutchman
anywhere about the house, and they
had been guilty of the extreme folly of
shooting each other. Thus ended the
battle of Dunksburg ? an event long to
be remembered by the peaceful inhabi
tants of that quiet village, which has
thus become famous among the bloody
localities of Missouri."

In Chicago, recently, a Mrs. Sullivan
died. Her husband, a drunkard, who
was absent from the House at the time,
being informed of his wife's death, re- !
turned in an intoxicated condition, and >
entering the room where the body lay, ;
struck it several blows, accompanying !
Ithem with terrible oaths. He then re- j
turned to his debauch, making no pro- j
vision for the interment of the body, j
which remained in the house until re- j
moved by the police.
Tho editor of the Cynthiana (Ky.)J
Xcict, in making an appeal to his sub
scribers who are in arrears to pay up, j
, says : "We hope they will 'settle' with
1 out delay. Not that we need the mon
| ey ? oh, no ! Our ink is given to us, we
i steal our paper, and we win our print
! era' wages at 'seven nn.' So it costs
'us nothing to carry on business. Nev
| ertheless, as a matter of accommodation,
j and to ease their consciences, we will
[ take what they owe us, if tb*y will
] send it in immediately.
During the prevalence of the cholera
in Louisville last summer, it was very
fatal in a locality within a radius of six
hundred yards from the corner of Tenth
and Green streets, about seventeen
deaths occurring within forty-eight
hours. The sickness was attributed to
the bad grading of Tenth street by the
city, which caused an overflow into the
yards of the residents near by. Mr.
(ieoree Rrnmback, who bmt his wife
and daughter by cholera, has therefore
sued the city for $25,000 damages, alleg
ing that their deaths were the results of
municipal negligence, since the fatality
would not have occurred had the grad
ing been properly executed.
A singular trial commenced in Chica
go on Monday. Jane Cole and Richard
Doyle were arraigned for peijnry. It
appears that Mr. Cole left home on bu
siness a couple of months ago, to be ab
sent four weeks. As soon as he was
Sflne his wife, Jane Cole, applied for a
ivorce on the ground of desertion, and
produced Doyle as witness. The di
vorce was granted, and when Cole re
turned he found his wife married to
Doyle. He now proaecutes both for
perjury and conspiracy.
The Denver Daily ? r? says: '"It
costs here about twelve handred dol
lars per week to rnn a daily newspaper.
The voting popnlation of Denver is
aboat twelve hundred. Of these about
two-thirds take and pay for a daily pa
i par. It is a fact too well known to (re
quire any argument to prove, that there
is scarcely a daily paper in the Union
whose subscription rates cover the cost
of the blank paper upon which it is i
printed. Did the Xetri depend upon its
subscription for support, it could not
live a week. To meet current expenses
the advertising patrons must make up
! what subscription fails to pay ? about
six hundred ami fifty dollars. The av
I erage number of advertisers in this com
munity, is about one hundred. These
one hundred advertisers must pay week
| ly, six dollars and fifty cents each, in
order to meet the expenses of the me
I chanical and professional labor re
quired on its columns."
The London Morning Adrertuer re
ports that one of the fallingstars struck
a waiter named Pike at Thompson's!
coffee house in Shoe lane. Pike came j
to the editor of the A<lrrrti*cr and said i
I that while standing in the middle of the I
j street, botweeu Shoe lane and Salisbury |
! court, with no one near him, and gazing
upward, lie became aware of a burning j
sensation in the neck, upon which lie |
tore at his neckcloth, and the next mo- ]
ment the burning substance passed j
down the left breast, scorching the shirt I
in its course, and intlicting three small
but severe burns on the desh, with one
large wonnd. The burn (says the edit
or,) we saw, but Wing of a skeptical
and matter-of-fact turn, we suggested a
fusee or lucifrr; this, however, w as earn- j
estlv negatived, and we felt ourselves i
unduly incredulous upon further exam- J
ination, as no substance whatever could j
be found in the young man's clothing, i
and he was certainly by no means like- i
ly to intlict such an injury on himself!
for the purposo of a mere sensation . A ,
medical man who saw him yesterday!
thinks it is a scald by fused metal or ;
sulpher, and the young man is decided- i
ly in a state of considerable suffering!
