Elated to Be Heard; Four
Against Hig'htowers.
A misunderstanding between th
attorney general and F. E. Kiddle,
opposition attorney in the Coffman
case ua to the time the ease would
be tried, promised to ball up the
schedule this morning at the opening
'of court. It appeared probablb, how
ever, that the case would go to bat
this afternoon Instead of tomorrow
morning. The attorney general, under the im
pression that Mr. Itiddle would be in
Muskogee today and unable to gel
hero until late tonight, uid not come
to Chickasha yesterday afternoon as
vas scheduled. Mr. Itiddle, 1iovl-
'er. appeared on the scene this ninrn
ing and Announced ready for trial.
). M. Oavaness, county attorney en
tered a protest to the court, .stating
that an important witnesn for the
prosecution was not hero and could
not, get here until this afternoon at
(i o'clock and requested the court t;
set the case for tomorrow morning.
i appeared that the empaneling of
'a jury would start some time this
morning or immediately after noon
at the latest and that the actual trial
of the case would be started this af
termost. , Mr. Frccling, attorney gen
eral was called by phone this morn
ing and advised of the turn the case
has taken. It was thought probable
that he would drive through in a
car and would arrive here shortly
nfler noon.
The stage is set In the district
court for a short but what promises
to be a Very busy criminal docket
in which three murder cases are
scheduled to be tried and during
which time a number of cases re
sulting from the general clean-up
in Chickasha, together with the
grand jury session and resulting in
dictments are on docket. The term
opens December 4 and is scheduled
to run through December 12.
Probably the feature case, which
was set down for hearing Satur
day November .'10, but. is being car
ried over until this week, is listed
on the docket as the State of Ok
lahoma vs. O. Coffman. It is the
outgrowth of the action of the grand
jury in which the body recommend
ed that the county Attorney, the
sheriff and the mayor of the city
be removed from office. II is also
the only case resulting from such
removal, as Hodge Bailey, the then
sheriff, and Oscar Simpson, county
attorney, did not fight their cases.
.Mr. Coffman. mayor, is lighting his
,j-se and although C. H. Caneman,
farmer president of the city council
lias been serving as mayor since
the action of the grand jury several
months ago. Mr. Coffman in his
fight will not only ask that he bo
reinstated in office, but will seek to
force the payment or his salary as
mayor from the time of his removal
until the present tiie.
Prince Kreeling, attorney general
of the state, will have charge of
the case for the state, and P. K.
Kiddle, founerly of this city, but
now of Tulsa, will represent Mr.
Coffman. Mr. Freeling was sched
uled to be in Chickasha Sunday
night to hold a conference with the
witnesses in the case at a local
hotel. Mr. Kiddle has wired the
court clerk that it would be impos
sible for him to be here before
Tuesday morning. Therefore it is
expected that the case will be tried
Tuesday. It is a, jury trial and it is
prcbr.h'.e that every effort will be
made to get it out of the way that

docket according to schedule Wed

Development of Waterways' r.ncl
Highways and New m
of Handling EaiI;-o.;b De
clared Urgent Probhia,
BELIEVES FINAL PEACE
COMING BY SPRING
Resumption of Public Improve
ments Urged; Suggests Lift
ing of Tax Burden from
Business of Nation.
Iiy United Press.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Decluring
that the present governmental
agencies can handle the routine prob
lems of re-adjustment, President Wil
son, in his message to congress this
afternoon, said the chief need of the
country is the development of its
waterways, highways and country
roads.
The old system of handling the
railroads, the president said, br ,ught
"conditions of restrain" without 'de
velopment. "Some new element' of
policy," he declared, "is necessary
for the public service and the relief
and credit of the stockholders. "I
frankly turn to you for counsel," he
said, at which statement the repub
lican members laughed.
The president outlined this and
other measures as his policies of re
adjustment. At the same time, he
explained his peace trip to Hurope
which, he said, he, ol, 11 was his
duty to make. ".May i not hope that
in the delicate tasks I shall have
to perform I may have l he encour
agement and added strength of "your
united support?
Continuing the president said he
believed that the final peace would
bo completed by spring, with plans
for a concrete scheme of "recon
struction." No plans have emerged
yet which he believes will work bet
ter than the present constituted
government agencies.
The immediate resumption and de
velopment, of public works to pro
vide employment for returning sol
diers was urged. The president rec
ommended the ratification of a
treaty to improve Pan-American re
lations. The immediate determination of
taxes for 1018, lilltl anil lU2n, with
the lilting of the tax burdens as
flinch as government needs will per
mit, was recommended. Priority in
the distribution of American raw
materials to war-stricken nations
was suggested.
Among the other recommendations
was the consummation of the three
year naval program, the reclama-
ition of arid and swamp lands and
the passage of the woman suffrage
amendment.

IN CHARGE HOME
SERVICE SECTION
Plans for Grady Not Complete;
Committee Asks Co-operation
of Relatives; Rep
resents Big Task.
Plans are now being formulated
by the home service sect Ion of the
Grady counyt Red Cross chapter,
jointly with the canteen committee,
for the arrangement of a "Welcome
Home Roll."
The "Welcome Home Roll" as de
fined by local Red Cross officials
and the southwestern division, will
be a list, on which is enrolled
every soldier that, is mustered out
of the service and returns to his
home. The enrollment curd will
carry the soldier's full name, divi
sion, regiment, company, rank and
home address. If the soldier has
returned from overseas, a list of en
gagements in which he has partiei
place will be added. The Grady
county "Home -Welcome Roll" will
contain a list of every soldier re
turning to his home in this county.
The roll will be preserved by the
American Red Cross.
According to initial plans, u booth
will be arranged in the Rock Island
and Frisco stations, at which one or
two of (he home service workers
will be stationed and where curds
may be filled out, .Mrs. T. II. Dwye.r,
chairman of the homer service sec
tion, says. The card may also be
filled out in Hie office or the Grady
chapter, second floor federal build
ing. In addition to the enrollment of
the names of soldiers who return
from serving with Uncle Sam, some
form of recognition for the nearest
relatives of returned soldiers such
as badge, flag, button, etc., will be
arranged.
"This is a great opportunity for
our home service section to i.ive
our returned soldiers a cordial wel
come and get in louch with their
families with a possibility of ren
dering further service," Mrs. T. H.
Dwyer, chairman, says.
"We are very anxious for co
operation on the parts of relatives
of soldiers who are asked to help
us in this enormous (ask. Although
a largo committee from the home
service section and the canteen com
mittees will be actively engaged In
the work of compiling: the "Wel
come Home Roll," Ihe task will be a
difficult one, and close co-operation
will be reiiuhvd.
"No definite plans have been
made locally, but work will be well
under way in Grady county in a
short time."

a reusing welcome be given the dej
egaiion that is whooping things up
in order that the government may
designate this route for thf perma-
nent truck express line joining cen
tral Oklahoma with Texas.
The plan as outlined in advance
is to have a number of motor
trucks, running on regular schedule
and hauling xpress. Hand In baud
with the proplsit ion, it is pointed
out goes the betterment of public
roads along the route, meaning
much to farmers and business men
in the towns, hamlets and cities
through which the route operates.
It Is understood that another
proposition will be taken lip at the
meeting tonight, one in fact lha the
boosters declare is the most vital
question before Chickasha business

Ing: "Something Is going to hap
pen at the city hull tonight, and the
business man who is not there to
take a hand In the proceedings and
help put over the propositions thai
are coming up, will have himself to
blame for being left out in the cold.
This old town is show ing some evi
dence of coming toife and If there
is not a jammed house tonight at
7:;i0, then I'll say that we are not
business men, but u gang of moss
backs and lhat we should sell out
our business places and go back in
the lasl range of hills in Arkansas
and go to trapping for a living."
