U. S. Senator for North Carblinn,
RALKarou, N. C., December 4.-W.
A, Graham was elected Senator from
North Carolina to-day, for tho long
term, receiving one hundred and thirty.
eight out of one hundred and fifty-four
votesi' Theballot'for a Senator for the
short term was without a successful re.
sult. Graham was in the Confederate
Senate, and has not been pardoned.
President's Message.
WASItNGtoN, Dec. 5.-Presidewt
Johnson's Message was sent in to-day
and read before both Houses ofCongress.
AItor the prefatory features, which
are eloquent allusions to the ' national
blessings in the national triumph, he
maintains that resistance to thte General
Government having exhausted. itself, the
first and most important question is,
whether the territory within the limits
of those States which had attemnted
secession should be held as conquered
teiritory under military authority eman
ating -fron.the Chief .MAgistraite of the
Union. ' The policy of holding it nndt-r
such rule, as a terniporarv iteasure, wits
jistified by all facts bearing on the ques.
tion-it was a public necessitv, but. he
considers that the subordiniation o4f civil
to military authority for an indefinire
period, would have orcd no- securit.y
for an early suppressioa of discoitent.
would have divided the.people into van.
quishers and vaiqnished, and envenormi'd
hatred rather than restored-affectiont anld
invited harmoiny.
The President says the trie theory is;
that all pretended acts of secession were,
from beginniitg to tile cessation of !ostil
ities, null and void. States cannot, com.
mit trenon. nor cat. they screen. by any
pretenses of individual sovereignty, their
individual citizens who rotay have been
guilty of that monstrous crime.-Those
States which attempted to secede placed
themselves it a cotditiot where their
functions' 'were sutspended. but. not
deally destroyed. But if one State ie.
glects or refuses to perform its proper
offices, there is created a kreater neces
sity why the General Government should
mintain its authority and as oon as
practicable resume the exercise of all it'
functions.
It was upon tlhis principle that. lie
proceeded in his policy towards the
Sot hern Itates.-Gradually and quietly
by steps almost imperceptible, he had
sought the restoiation of the rightful re
lations of the General Govertinent to
the separate States. To that end ProvisA
ional Governors were appointed for ea
of the members of the Union .latelvft,
rebellion, and now all, parties to the, '
terrible conflict -tntst work together in
harmony. It is not too much to ask
that on one sido the plan of restoration
shall procedd upon the basis of willing.
ness to cast the disorder of the past into
oblivion, while, on ' .die
