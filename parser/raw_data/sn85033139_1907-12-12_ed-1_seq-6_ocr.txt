including the aged Queen Sophia and
tbo crown prince, Oscar Gustav, and
high ministers of state, the inevitable

palace great crowds stuod vvith bowed
heads and tearful eyes long after the

The princes then took the oath of al
legiance and the new monarch accepted
the homage of the state ollicials.
The last hours of tic expiring mon
arch wore passed in unconsciousness and
up to the end he gave no sign of recug
m/.ing those about him. Ihe Queen was
grief-stricken because lie could not bid
her farewell
In the palace courtyard in the dim
cold gray mist stood a crowd of school
boys, King Oscar s most devoted friends
lb-re they bad stood for hours, blue air I
shivering, watching the palace tlagstufl.
There also gathered many ..id men and
women in rags, whom the King had al
ways stopp.sl to comfort with mild words
and generous alms when In met them in
the parks or streets, their faees tear
stained because tln-ir belov-d King and
benefactor was dying.

that the only way of putting an end to tm

better than to lie Intrusted with the com

STATE CAN’T FORCE
TRAINS TO STOP
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
HANDS DOWN IMPORTANT
RAILROAD DECISION.
MAY AFFECT WISCONSIN.
Held That Commission Cannot Force In
terstate Trains to Stop at Small
Stations.
INTERFERENCE WITH COMMERCE.
WASHINGTON. 1). C., Dec.
I Special.J—The United States supreme
court ruled today that a state railway
commission cannot force a railroad com
pany to stop its fast trains at small sta
tions, when those trains are engaged
in interstate business.
This decision, which is important, as
it may affect many rulings of the Wis
consin railway commission in similar ac
tions. was in the ease id' tin- Atlantic
Coast Line company vs. the Hoard of
Railroad Commissioners of South Caro
lina.
Small Town Wanted Service.
The suit arose in eouuiH'tion with tin
effort on the part of the citizens of
Latin. S. C.. to secure the stopping on
being flagged of two such trains which
daily pass through the town, and the
commission ordered that stops should he
made whenever the signal should be
hoisted. The railroad company resist
cii the ruling as unreasonable and as an
interference with interstate commerce.
The state supreme court decided
against tin company and it immediately
appealed to the supreme court of the
United States with the result that the
relief sought was obtained.
Victory for Railroad.
The opinion of the court was delivered
by Justice I’eekhnm and reversed the de
cision of the South Carolina court. The
opinion held the order of the commis
sion to be an interference with inter
state commerce.

spoke briefly for Kansas City and then
introduced Senator Warner n! that state,
who, he said, was one ol the fruits ot
the Republic. ,ll victory in Missouri three
years ago.
Senator Warner received vocifi runs
applause. He said Kansas City had a
hall which could easily accommodate
IM,OOO people. Senator Warner s;ml
that Missouri had eighteen electoral
votes; that he had labored for twenty
four years to place that state in the
Republican column: that * access had
been achieved in 11HI4, when the state
gave Theodore Roosevelt 35.000 and
while that it was not now assuredly a
Republican state, it was in the doubtful
column. Senator Warner believed it
would help Missouri as a doubtful state
if Kansas City were chosen.
In answer to a question by Senator
Scott as to whether all delegates of
whatsoever color would lie taken care
of in a dignified maimer. Senator War
ner said that if he did not feel perfect
ly to guarantee that they would be

MINERS GATHER RIFLES
Detective Patrol Discovers Hidden Guns
—Non-union Men May Operate
Goldfield Mines.
GOLDFIELD, Xev., Dec. 9.—While
Goldfield seems to be in peace, it is
evident that the death struggle between
the mining operators and the radical
members of the Western Federation of
Miners is reaching a crisis.
That the miners have armed them
selves to resist the federal soldiers tl
necessary to hold their power in the
camp was proven by the finding of a
store of rifles cached within a short
distance of the town.
('apt. Sage of the Consolidated Mines
company detective patrol was the one
who found the hidden arms. There were
lot) rifles of the latest and most deadly
kind in the pile. This is only a part ot
tho arms and ammunition which the
miners have collected during the last few
days.
Despite the warlike mood of the strik
ers, ('apt. William Cox. the representa
tive of Gov. Sparks in Goldfield, states
that th< Mine Owners' association will
attempt, during the week, to reopen the
mines here with nan-union men. This
information has been communicated to
the governor. It is thought plenty of
non-union men can be hired here.

Rockford Young Women First Foreigners
on Summit.
MEXICO CITY, .Mix.. Dee. 9. - Two
plucky American young women. Miss Hor
tense Edy and Miss Octave Woodward of
Rockford, 111 . have Just made a successful
ascent of Popocatepetl volcano. They were
the first foreigners, either man or woman,
to accomplish this feat.
The weather was severe on the summit or
the mountain and the other members of the
party and the guides declined to make the
ascent. Misses Edy and lived went
on alone and after several hours of mu a
work and many thrilling, experiences tliey
reached the crest of the crater of the vol
cano.
By this time the snow storm, which had
whirled about them during their ascent, had
given way to clear skies, and they obtained
a magnificent view of the valley of Mexico.
They made the descent without accident.
