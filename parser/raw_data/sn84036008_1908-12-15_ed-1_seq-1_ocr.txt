most tangible clew as to what became
of the .$15,000 stolen from the East

today when it was learned that two
'bills, one a gold certificate and the
other currency of large denominations
of the same numbers as some of the
money stolen, had been discovered in
the postoffice at 'Ogden, Utah.

dressee getting hold of an old news
paper, in which was wrapped $2,400 in
currency. The address was "Chas. L.
Price." A plasterer of that name who
lives in Ogden, called for and was
given the package.
On discovering the contents Price
hurried back to the postoffice and
handed it over to the authorities.

the bills and the peculiar manner in
which they were transmitted, together
with the fact that the paper was sent
from Portland, aroused suspicion and
the Portland authorities were notified,
the numbers of the bills being sent.

Ogden authorities were asked to
watch for "Price." This man, how
eevr failed to .put in an appearance.
The matter leaked out today when
Newhall filed a claim for the money
with the local postal authorities, in
spite of the fact that everything had
been done to keep the matter secret.
