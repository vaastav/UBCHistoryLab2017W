the cross-examination commenced, conducted
by Mr. bteel? lor the defence. No new tacts
were elicited or change made in the direct testi
mony. Much of the cross-examination related to
an explanation by the witness ol the use of yellow
Jessamine, which, it appears, is a favorite remedy
with him. a lecture of the witness' before a medi
ca) association was used by the counsel in tne ex
amination. H was moat searching and embarrass
ing, but Dr. Williams answered promptly and intel
ligently every question without embarrassment,
and, taking everything into consideration, was the
heat witness I eyer saw on the stand.
DH. CHEW'S KWDBNCK.
At tan mfhutes alter two o'clock Attorney General
Byater directed the calling of Dr. Chew, who
aastoted in the pon-iuortem examination ol Gen
eral Ketohum'a ovUv. He took the wituesa stand
and testified aa follows.?
f have been a practising physician for thirteen or
fOnrteen years la Baltimore, and have occupied the
chair of Materia Medics In the Medical University
of Maryland lor eight years; at the request of Dr.
Williams I assisted in making a post-mortem ex
amination o( General Ketch urn's body; Professor
Miles made It In chief; Dr. Win lams sua 1 were
present aud assisted; we examined the abdomen
first; found the liver, spleen, kidneys and alimentary
canal beaithyt we round in the latter some evi
dences ol congestion, but imperfectly marked; it
contained a whitish, pulpy substance, consisting of
mucus sad epithelium, streaked with bile; we re
moved the stomach and placed it in a clean glass
|ar, capable * holding about three pints; examined
the cavity of the sknil and found therein some evi
dences ol congestion in the nraln; portions of the
brain and the npper spiral column were taken
by Proicssor Miles ror microscopic examination;
found pnncurorm congestion, took thej
jar contain
ing the stomach to the chemical department of the
University of Maryland and leu it under charge or
i)r. Aiken for analysts; I beard the testimony of
)r. Williams in regard to the symptoms o< General
Ketcbum during his sickness, and from that narra
tion and my own observation of the changes In
ibe organs at the post-mortem I consider tue cose
a very obscure one, and
OOULD NOT AB816N A SPECIFIC CAl'SK FOR DEATH;
from all the symptoms narrated by Dr. Williams
upon the witness stand and my own observation* l
do not think U was a natural death, bnt that he died
from artificial causes.
It being tnree o'clock, Chief Justice Miller stated
that the court would now adjourn until to-morrow
morning at ten o'clock, when the examination of
Dr. Cbew win be resumed.
During the entire proceedings to-day Mrs. Whar
ton and her daughter, although perfectly composed,
seemed to watch tne proceedings with more than
usual interest. Dimly through the veils that bid
their face* from sight could be seen their earnest,
piercing glances, alternating beiwcen counsel aud
witnesses, as the actions or words ol each were di
rected toward some important point iu the case.
Indeed, the whole party accompanying Mrs. Whar
ton seemed to deeply reel the Interest that was mo
mentarily gathering around the progress of this
trial. Mrs, Nugent, as yesterday, seemed more de
pressed than the rest, aud
FREQUENTLY 8HED TEARS.
And this increasing Interest was not seared alone
by the Immediate friends aud relations ol tne pris
oner, but tne entire audience watched the pro
ceedings with an eager, breathless interest which has
heretofore been felt only by the few. At frequent
intervals ladies sitting a Utile back in the room
would rise up in their sears and lu almost breath
less suspense lean forward to catoh, if possible, every
utterance made by those managing tne case; and at
times the stillness of tne crowded room was really
painful.
To-morrow the proceedings will undoubtedly be
fully as important as npon any or the previous days
of the trial. Professor Miles, who made the post
mortem examination, and Professor Aiken, who
anSJyped the stomach of General Ketoiam and found
that tartar emetic had been administered, win go
npon the Witness stand. No ope l* able as yet to
auraii?* when the state will close frj case, but it is
generally believed that it will rest by Thursday
of next week. Several of its important witnesses
are yet to go upon the stand, among whom
are Mrs. Loney, Mrs. Hut ton's sister, the
Kwho pat the glass containing lartar emetic
fcr bocket and gave it to Dr. Williams.- Her tes
TUE LINE OF THE DEFENCE WILL HE,
bnt irom the cross-examination of Dr. Williams
to-day one might infer that they will attempt to
show that the Jessamine and chioral giren by him,
or one or the other, was the cause ol General
Ketcnuin's death; and this theory is supported by
the fact that many medical gentlemen trom Phila
delphia and Baltimore of high position have been
summoned by the defence. There is also a rumor,
that has gained much credit, that they will" under
take to snow that General Kctchum waft in the liauit
of carrying and taking poisonous drugs, and this
theory is supported by the tact that a considerable
nuraoer of arm.v officers that knew General
Ketcbum have been summoned.
There arc also many otner rumor* afloat In rcia
tloa to the case ami Its conduct,that it might no) do
to repeat until a later date. (Sunday's letter of this
correspondence will contain a review of the week s
proceedings and facts in relation to this mysterious
case of a highly interesting character. No trial
within the history of criminal prosecution* in
this country has ever been heard which developed
such interesting and Important surroundings as
belong to this. A lew days more of investigation
will dear up the terrible and mysterious circum
stances that cluster around this unfortunate lady,
or deepen their import into positive proof.

AMUSEMENTS.
Italia* Opera?"l.ada."
Last night was the final performance of tne first
regular irwon of the NUhjou Italian Opera Com
pany, which season lasted tweuty nights, and
brought in gross receipts abont $100,000. The oc
casion was the means ot bringing together the
tiaoai brilliant assemblage that patronizes opera in
this cttv, and Nilsson was in the best of voice for
what we consider one or her very beet roles, the on
happy Bribe of Lammermoor. Passing over the other
parts of this marvellous impersonation, of which
we have already given an elaborate criticism,
we can point to the mad scene aa one ot
the most magnificent creations or genius
presented on the operatic stage at the present time.
It la a enbitme effort on the part or the artist and
one that wilt never fade from the memory ot those
present. Briguoit was tne Bdgardo, having been
granted tbe honor or opening and closing the sea
son with Mlsson, He won deserved applause in the
two fine teuor arias that close the opera, Barre
was a verv tame ash ton. and nullified tbe import
ance or the role. A matinee will be given to-day, In
wnich Mile. Duval will essay tbe rote of
Zerlina lu "Fra Dlavolo," and In the even
ing Mlsson appears at the Brooklyn Academy
in "Lucia." The extra season, Philadelphia
being abandoned, either on aocount of the
prevalence or the smallpox or on account of the
success which has attended the New York season,
commences on Monday with "Mignon." On Wed
nesday "11 Trovatore" will be presented, with Mile.
Nlisson as Leonora, Miss Cary as Aaucena. Blgnor
brignoh as Manrtco and li. Barrfe as Count di Luna.
The announcement made ot Miss Keiiogg's engage
ment with the troupe appears to be premature, m
that artist will not sing until the season of opera to
he given during the Easter holidays under the man
agement of Carl Rosa, during which season Miss
Kellogg, Mme. Parepa-Rosa, Mrs. Jenny Van Zandt,
Mauame Gazzanlga (probably), Wachtel and casiel
inary will appear In Italian opera.
