FOR>»-3R STATE TREASURER BOB
LETER HAS MADE AN OFFER
OF 15.1.000
ACCEPTANCE IS RECOMMENDED
Attorney Genernl Thinks the Offer
Is Eminently Reasonable—Much
Sympathy Expressed for
the Ex-Treasurer.
Attorney General Douglas yesterday
submitted to Gov. Van Sant a proposi
tion from. Col. Joseph Bobleter, formei
6iate treasurer, in_ regard to the settler
iiicnt of the $5,000 that will be due the
etate after the bondsmen have paid the
$22,000 which they have offered in settle
ment. Col. Bobleter's letter is as fol
lows:
' "I have been advised that the bondsmen
on my official bond as state treasurer
have prepared a proposition in accord
ance with chapter 212, Laws of 1599. for
the settlement of the state's claims
against them for losses sustained by the

urer, and in arriving at such proposition
the said bondsmen figured that 1 shoulu

"In regard to this I would say, I am

said $5,000 and interest be entered against
me and also request that a commission
be appointed to adjust the matter, as
provided in chapter 212, laws of 1899.
"I feel confident that if I am granted
this time I will be able to earn enough
to pay the same."
Attorney General Douglas recommends
that the proposition be accepted, and It
is very likely that it will be.
There is a very general sentiment at
the state house that the legislature ought
to take some action which would relieve
Col. Bobleter of this liability, and in all
probability a bill will be introduced at
the next session with that end in view.
Sympathy lor Bobleter.
There is a very widespread sympathy
for Col. Bobleter, because of the fact
that he is entirely free from blame in
the matter. He was in no wise responsi
ble for the loss to the state through the
failure of the banks in which the state
money was deposited. At that time there
was a board of deposit which designated
the banks in which the state should keep
its funds, and also the manner of invest
ing state funds. Col. Bobleter had no
discretion in the matter. Although legal
ly liable, he was not to blame in any
sense.
A prominent member of the legislature
said yesterday: "I certainly should be in
favor of the legislature taking some
action in this matter, if there is any way
in which they can legally give Col. Bob
leter relief. I am sure there would be
no opposition to such a measure on the
part of any member of either house. *t
seems unfair that so good a man as Col.
BoLietcr, who has served his state and
country in so faithful a manner, shoulfl
suffer, through an unfortunate combina
tion of circumstances of mis kind, w-hen
he is not guilty of negligence or official
romissness. If we can legally appropriate
money for this purpose we ought to do
it; at any rate there ought to be some
way in which we can render the as
sistance needed."
AT WORK IN FACTORIES
STATE LABOR COMMISSIONER

State Labor Commissioner John ODon
nell has completed his report of factory
inspection in St. Paul. The report shows
that there are In this city 559 manufactur
ing establishments employing 12.5T2 men,
3,667 women, 91 boys under the age of six
teen, and 43 girls under ihz agts of six
teen, making a total of I'M'TC employes.
In 19S non-manufacturing establish
ments there are employed 4,757 men, 51
boys,-1,397 women, and 30 girls, a total of
6,265 persons. Of the 22,941 persons em
ployed in these 787 establishments, 1,737,
or 7.33 per cent, are obliged to labor on
Sundays.
In the Second district, exclusive ol
Minneapolis, 355 inspections were made;
33 were of manufacturing plants and 17

NOVELTIES IN TOYS
DEALERS HAVE AMPLE SUPPLIES
O-X HAND FOR THE HOL
IDAY TRADE
DEMAND FOR THEM IS LARGE
American Ingenuity Has Supplied
All the New Varieties—lmport
ed Goods Are of Stereo
typed Patterns.
Local dealers in Christmas toys do not
expect any unusual demand for their
goeds this year, but they look for a sale
that will at least be equal to thft average
of previous years. Large quantities of
Christmas goods are already on the
market, notwithstanding the fact that
Christmas is yet nearly three weeks dis
tant. All of the large department stores
have put in heavy stocks and are ready
for the demands of their customers.
There are not a great many new
features among the toys this year. All
the new varieties that are on the market
are of American manufacture, tne im
ported goods being of the same patterns
as for several years past. .
Among the novel toys this year are a
number of hill-climbing vehicles. These
were first introduced last year, but were
made only in small articles. This year
they are made in all styles of vehicles
including the locomotives, freight, pas
senger and flat cars, automobiles and the
like. They work upon the principle of
the heavy balance wheel and when once
started In motion will travel many feet
even through gravel or up an incline.
They are proving quite popular with the
children and are having a large sale.
Another novel toy is a top which was
invented by one of the professors of
Columbia college. It is called the sci
entific top, and by its use a child can
paint some of the most beautiful designs.
The top is so constructed as to hold a
piece of paper which it revolves rapidly,
enabling the child to paint the paper in
artistic figures.
Another novelty is a self-registering
bank which will record the amount of
coin placed in it. One of the features of
this bank which distinguishes it from
other self-registering banks is that all
the money is placed in the same slot, out
the bank registers the amount, whetlier
the coin is a penny, nickel, dime or
quarter.
The wholesale dealers say that the
trade with country merchants has been
exceptionally good this year and many
consignments have been sent out. The
retail trade In the city is principally con
trolled by the department stores, all of
which carry a large stock.
SOUP FOR THE SOLDIERS
REGULARS WILL HAVE SOUP EV-
ERY TEN DAYS.
For some time to come Uncle Sam's
regulars will receive a can of prepared
soup one day in ten, instead of the usual
issue of canned salmon. This order goes
into effect at once and the department of
Dakota has been busy making up the re
quisition for the troops In the depart,
ment.
The commissary department has the
soup on hand, it having been returned
from the Philippines where It was sent
to be offered for sale to officers, enlisted
men, hospitals and such civillana as are
authorized to purchase suppHes from the
commissary department oC the army.
The hospitals are allowed 40 cents a
day for each man In the haspltaj for the
purpose of purchasing: such delicacies as
patients may desire, or can eat. A large
amount of the soup was contracted for at
a most reasonable figure aud Uic depart-
ment has decided to distribute it amor.g
the army.
This is the first timfe that soup has ever
been issued as regular rations to the
army, but the general opinion seems to be
that the men will relish the innovation.
The poup will be distributed as sorm as
the division is made. In the lot there ia
ox tail, chicken, mock turtle and beef,
all of a fine brand of soup.
The only bank in St. Paul exclusively
for savings is The State Savings Bank,

Deposits made there' now will be enti
tled to 6 mos.' interest July 1, 1902.
SNOW GUARDS NEEDED
ENGINEER CL.AISSEX SAYS COLRT
HWISE MIST BE EQX'IPPED
If an Icicle Were to Drop From the
Cornices Chances Woulil
Be Good for a Fn
nernl.
No one, as yet, bas fallen a victim to
the tons of snow and ice that often come
thundering down the steep mansard rocf
of the court house, and crash with a roar
on the walks beneath but City Engineer
Clatfssen intends that no one shall. Yes
terday he notified the city hall and court
house commission that it.would have to
equip the building with snow guards.
Only last winter the work house van,
and a team of valuabie horses narrowly
escaped destruction from an avalanche
of snow that dropped from the roof
above, and literally filled the court with
its moisture-soaked debris.
As a precautionary measure, the roof
at all times is relieved of its covering of
snow whenever any falls, but the removal
of icicles which cling to the cornices !s
an impossibility. Fatal results would at
tend their striking a pedestrian below.
It is expected that the commission in
charge of the building will attend to tha
matter at once, and supply the necessary
guards.
MISCHIEF MAKER.
A Surprise in Brooklyn.
An adult's food that can save a baby
proves itself to be nourishing and easily
digested and good for big and little folks.
A Brooklyn man says: "When baby was
about eleven months old he began to
grow thin and pale. Thi3 was, at first,
attributed to the heat and the fact that
his teeth were coming, but, in reality,
the poor little thing was starving, his
mother's milk not being sufficient nour
ishment.
"One day after he had cried bitterly for
an hour, I suggested that my wife try
him on Grape-Nuts. She soaked two
teaspoonfuls in a saucer with a little
sugar and warm milk. This baby ate so
ravenously that she fixed a second, which
he likewise finished. It was not many
days before he forgot all about being
nursed, and has since lived almost ex
clusively on Grape-Nuts. Today the boy
is strong and robust, and as cute a mis
chiefmaker as a thirteen months old
baby is expected to be;
"We have put before Wm other foods,
but he will have none of them, evidently
preferring to stick to that which did him
co much good in his time of need—his old
friend Grape-Nuts.
"Use this letter any way you wish, for
my wife and I can never praise Grape-
Nuts enough after the brightness it has
brought to our household. These state
ments can be verified by anyone who
wishes to make a visit to our home."
F. F. McElroy, 256 So. Brd St., Brooklyn,
N. Y.
Grape Nuts Is not made for a baby
food, but experience with thousands of
babies shows it to be among the best, if
mat entirely the best in use. Bein* a
scientific preparation ~of Nature's grains,
it is equally effective as a body and brain
builder tor frown- upa.
JUNKET CALLED OFF
RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS DE
CIDE TO ABANDON TRIP TO
"WASHINGTON
FRICTION WITH GOVERNOR
Whispered That Executive Objected
to Commission Cutting; In at
Twelfth. Hour— Two of
Them Sore.
I
Gov. Van Sant, probably aided by Com
missioner Staples, scored once on the
state railroad and warehouse commission
yesterday, and as a result of the many
conferences held the railroad commission
called off their little junket to Washing-,
ton, where they were to have had a con
ference with the interstate commission.
There is every evidence of an official
coolness between part of the commission,
and the governor. Gov. Van Sant does
not like the idea of the commission "cut
ting in" at this late date, especially
when it contemplates an action not in
harmony with the plans which Gen.
Douglas and himself have decided upon.
Judge Mills has contended from the be
ginning that the matter should be left
to the federal authorities. The governor
and attorney general have been prepar
ing to get the matter into courts at the
earliest possible moment and with as
little hurrah as possible. Commissioner
Staples is a very warm friend of the
governor's, and while he has said noth
ing to indicate that he was not in entire
harmony with his brethren on the com
mission, there is every reason to believe
that after his little conference with the
governor on Friday night he went back
to tell his colleagues that the governor
was right and that the Washington ,trip
ought to be postponed. The governor
pointed out to the members of the com
mission that they could accomplish no
good whatever by going to Washington,
while they might do much harm. If they
were to go down to Washington and dis
cuss the matter with the interstate com
merce commission, and a decisicm was
rendered against their position, it would
be hailed by delight by the railroad in
terests and the country would hear that
Minnesota had lost the first round in its
fight. He told them plainly what he
proposed to do, and he was desirous of
doing it in a quiet way, without making
a. great advertisement of it. He said if
the federal authorities were desirous of
acting In the matter they would do so
without any urging upon the part of th»
state officials of Minnesota.
One of the commissioners did not try to
conceal his displeasure at the governor's
attitude, intimating that the govern*
was jealous of the commission's cutting
in, and he said that from now on the
governor could do as he pleased without
assistance from the commission.
Gov. Van Sant would make no state
ment as to what had taken place between
himself and the commission. He re
ferred all those who asked to the com
mission. He said that as far as he knew
the commission was composed of "very
pleasant gervtlemen." The commission
did not return the compliment in speak
ing of the executive.
STREETS REMAIN DIRTY
NO MOXEY AVAILABLE TO PAY
STREET CLEANING FORCE
Only Three Men at Work at Present
—Old Practice of Puymcut
Knocked by Gen.
Pope.
Much filth and slush now encumber the
streets in the business district, but it
will have to continue until there is money
available for its removal. Three men
are now engaged in cleaning street cross
ings, but even they may have to be let
out because of a ftck of funds.
"I know the streets of St. Paul are In
a frightful condition now," said City En
gineer Claussen yesterday, "but it cant
be helped. I expected to hear lots of
kicks, but I guess tha public, more than
myself, is acquainted with the condition
of things and lets me alone. I may not
be able to do anything before the first of
next year."
Last 1 year' the streets, and: heavy, falls
'of snow, were taken care of by hiring
men, and anticipating the following year's
money to the extent of ; placing the men
on the January ~ pay roll,: but this Gen.
Pope frowns down, and it will in all
probability not be,repeated.

business men have clubbed together and

NOT RECOMMENDED
FOR EVERYTHING
But If You Have Kidney, Liver or Bladder
Trouble, You Will Find Swamp-Root
Just the Remedy You Need.
It used to be considered that Only urin
ary and bladder troubles were to .be
traced to the kidneys, but now modern
science proves that nearly all diseases
have their beginning in the disorder ol
these most important organs.
The kidneys filter and purify the blood
—that Is their work.
Therefore, when your kidneys are weak
or out of order, you can understand how
quickly your entire body is affected, and
how every organ seems to fail to do its
duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly,"' begin
taking the famous new discovery, Dr.
Kilmer's Swamprßoot, -because as soon
as your kidneys are well they will help
all the other organs to health. A trial
will convince anyone.
Doctors Prescribe Swamp-Hoot.
"I have prescribed that wonderful
remedy for kidney and bladder com
plaints, Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, with
most beneficial effect, and know of
many cures by its use. These patients
had kidney trouble, as diagnosed by
other physicians, and treated without
benefit. Dr. Kilmers Swamiyßoot
effected a cure. I am a liberal man
and accept a specific wherever I find it,
in an accepted school or out of it. For
desperate cases of kidney or bladder
complaint under treatment with unsat
isfactory results, I turn to Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root with most flattering re.
suits. I shall continue to prescrioe it,
and from personal observation state
that Swamivßoot has great curative
/Properties." %

Weak and unhealthy kidneys are re
sponsible for many kinds of diseases, ana
if permitted to continue much suffering,
with fatal results, are sure to follow.
Kidney trouble Irritates the nerves, makes
you dizzy, rtstless, sleepless and irritable.
Makes you pass water often during tho
day and obliges you to get up many
times during the night. Unhealthy kid
neys cause rheumatism, gravel, catarrh
of the bladder, pain or dull ache in the
back, joints and muscles; make your
head ache and back ache; causes indi
gestion, stomach and liver trouble, you
get a sallow, yellow complexion; makes
you feel as though you had heart trouble,
you may have plenty of ambition, but no
strength; get weak and waste away.
The cure for these troubles is Dr. Kil
mer's Swamiyßoot, the world-famous
kidney remedy. In taking Swamp-Root
you afford natural help to nature, for
Swamp-Root is the most perfect healer
end gentle aid to the kidneys that is
known to medical science.
If there is any doubt in your mind as
to your condition, take from your urine,
on rising, about four ounces, place it in a
glass or bottle and let it stand twenty
four hours. If, on examination it is
milky or cloudy, if there is a brick-dust
settling, or if small particles float about
in it, your kidneys are in need of imme
diate attention.
Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and
is used in the leading hospitals, recom-

PORT IS FAME AND MfS- *
EJQAJDIN6
IS PREPARED TO REFUTE IT
Insists That Mistakes Slioitii Are
Trivial and That Gehan ami
: Steeg Are Innocent of
. Wroni; Doing.
False, misleading: and calculated to
bring- into disrepute his depaitmer^; is
what City Engineer" Claussen says of the
partial report concerning alleged abuses
in the city engineering department filed
by Bank Examiner Pope Friday after
noon. —
Mr. Claussen was In anything but a
pleasant frame of mind yesterday, and
reference to the matter was sufficient to
bring out a flow of crimson-hued lan
guage, anything but complimentary to
the bank examiner. Mr. Claussen claims
that the report is false in that It prac
tically accuses several of his employes
with having criminally misappropriate.!
certain sums of money. What others
have done he does not know, but ho Is
positive Bookkeeper Gehan and Supt.
Steeg are innocent of any wrongdoing.
He figures there is a discrepancy of about
$139, but this he says is due to errors, im
possible to avoid when it is known t* it
over $100,000 a year is paid out in small
Bums as wages. Mr. Claussen says he
will write a full answer to the report In
a few days, and submit it to the council.
He will men demand a full investigation
of the charges Mr. Pope has made.
As to Gehan and Steeg, both officials
are reticent about the report, except to
denounce Mr. Pope in rather strong
language. Th.ey insist that beyond infer
ences, not proven, the report shows abso
lutely nothing of a criminal character.
Both agree with City Engineer Claussen
that it Is impossible to adopt any other
system of paying and checking withouV
costing the city a large sum of money
for extra clerk hire.
Bank Examiner Pope and his force of
assistants were working with feverish
haste yesterday on the remainder of the
report, which he will file in a few days
with Gov. Van Sant. This portion of the
investigation will have reference to tne
padding of the pay rolls by certain of the
street commissioners in collusion with
ot«crs, and it is said will contain more
than mere inference.
City Engineer Claussen says some of
his employes have proven dishonest, but
the moment he found it out he discharged
them at once. As to his clerical force ha
