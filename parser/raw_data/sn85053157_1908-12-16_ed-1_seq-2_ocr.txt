DO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
FEAR INVESTIGATION?
The trreat length of President
Roosevelt'# last annual message to
congress discourages an attempt to
fully digest all the matters presented,
but there i- one portion of the docu
ment that deserve-* public attention.
It refers to legislation enacted by
congress 1 :tr-t year which provided
that, there should be no detail from
the government secret service and no
transfer therefrom. In discussing the
effect of this legislation, the presi
dent says iti part:
"it is not too much to say that this
amendment has been of benefit only,
and could be of benefit only, to the
criminal classes. If deliberately in
troduced for the purpose of diminish
ing the effectiveness of war against
crime it could not have been better
devised to this end. It forbade the
practices that had been followed to a
greater or less extent by the executive
heads of various departments for 20
years. To these practices we owe
the securing: of evidence which en
abled us to drive great lotteries out
of buriner.- and secure a quarter of
a million of dollars in tines from
their promoters. These practices have
■ nabled Us to discover some of the
mo>t outrageous frauds in connection
with the theft of government land and
timber by great corporations
and bv individuals. These practices
haw enabled us to get t-ome evidence
indispensable in order to secure the
conviction of the wealthiest and most
formidable criminals with whom the
government has to deal.
"The chief argument in favor of the
provision was tha'. the congressmen
did not themselves wish to be investi
ud by secret service men. Very little
of such investigation has been done in
the past,: but it is true that the work
of secret service agents was .partly re
sponsible fi>r the indictment and con
viction of a senator and a congress
man for land frauds in Oregon. I do
.not belii ve that it is in the public in
erest to protect criminals in any
ir.i .eh of the public set vice, and ex
actly as we have again and again
.luring the past seven years prose
cuted such criminals who were in the
executive branch of the government,
so in my belief we should be given
ample means to prosecute them if
found iu the legislative branch. Hut
if this is not considered desirable a
special exception could be made in
■ lu law prohibiting the use of the se
■rct service force in investigating
members of the congress."
lu this arraignment of members of
congress, the president will be sup
ported by public sentiment. Our
senators and representatives are sub
ject to the law, and any wrong doing
in which they may engage should be
investigated and punished. The en
actment of a law that will operate to
protect them from the consequences of
any crime is a trick that will not. be
sanctioned by the decern citizenship
ol the country.
The cause of good government will
b. advanced by holding all our public
ollicials to strict accountability for
their conduct at all limes. A search
ing investigation of the record of
federal, state, county and municipal
ollieers on any occasion that may call
for such proceedings would be of
beuetii to the public at large. The hon
est and capable public employe would
welcome such an investigation, as tin
opportunity to demonstrate his in
noceuee of wrong doing. Crooked
aud dishonest ollicials would oppose
such action, because of their fear of
detection, punishment and disgrace.
IMPROVING THE WATERWAYS.
There are few sections of the coun
try that will be more directly benefited
by the improvement of the iulaud
waterways of the country than Mon
tana, says the tireat Falls Tribune.
When one takes into consideration
the fact that, both as producers and
consumers, Montana people are pay
ing an enormous amount for trans
portation, it can be readily appre
ciated what it would mean to the state
if these transportation charges could
be cut iu two, and there is no doubt
that they would be at least cut in two
so far as the freight which can be
shipped by river is concerned. He
cause of our distance from either
ocean our freight charges must al
ways be considerably higher than
almost any other part of the country,
but they can be materially lowered by
water transportation.
At the present session of congress
two principal projects for the im
provement of waterways will be con
sidered. One of these is the interior
waterways down the Atlantic coast,
which would materially shorten ship
ping distances and give water trans
portation to a large number of now
inland pointa; and the second is the
improvement of the Mississippi river
and its tributaries.
The first has 6ome importance as a
commercial route at all times, but the
strongest argument for its completion
as a through route and its improve
ment as a permanent one is its useful
ness for our coast trade in time of
war and the facilities it would afford
to the safe movements of our light
draft naval vessels. This interior
line would undoubtedly prove of vast
service in case of a powerful hostile
lleet on blockade or patrol service
upon our Atlantic seaboard. It is a
line of defense that should not be
ignored, and in connection with our
great harbors sheltering our own
squadron-, can, with propriety, be
regarded as a strong line for offen
sive operations as well.
Hut, with all due respect to the At
lantic coast line, and with approval
of its establishment both as a com
mercial route aud as a national de
fense, the improvement of the Missis
sippi, the Missouri, the Ohio and the
other tributary rivers, is of far more
importance to a much larger propor
tion of our people. The material in
terests of all the people of the great
central portion of the United States
will be directly benefited by this im
provement, and indirectly the Interests
of the people in other sections of the
country will benefit from increased
business which it will bring to the
country: aud the sooner the work is
undertaken the sooner the country
will begin to reap that benefit.
FIGHTING THE GRAFTERS.
The conviction of Abraham lluef.
the wealthy political San Francisco
boss, on a charge of bribery, will en
courage the war against grafters that
is in progress in various parts of the
country. The fate of Kuef will be a
warning to those who, under the pro
tection o? political power or influence,
may be disposed to prey upon the
public by methods that invite prose
cution and punishment.
The principal credit for the con
viction of Kuef and Mayor Schmitz,
of San Francisco, his partuer in
crime, belongs to Francis J, Ileney,
the fearless public prosecutor who was
shot down in court by a friend of the
accused. The record of Mr. Ileney In
this case should be an inspiration to
other public officials who. in their
particular field, are entrusted with
the duty of protecting the interests of
the people.
Mr. Ileney has had a remarkable
career in Arizona. California and
Oregon. After leaving the University
of California he studied law and later
worked as a cowboy aad miner In
various parts of the west, lie "hung
out his shingle" in Tucson, Ariz.,
where he became known for his fear
lessness. Dr. Handy of that city an
nounced that he would shootjou sight
any lawyer who took up the case of
his wife, who was suing for divorce.
Ileney took the case and was attacked
by Handy, whom he shot dead.
After his return to San Francisco
Ileney was appointed special prosecu
tor for the government in the Oregon
land fraud eases. Through his efforts
United Slates Senator Mitchell, Con
gressman Williamson and other
prominent tuen were convicted.
Ileney was called to Sati Francisco
some months after the fire of l!)0ti to
prosecute Mayor Schmitz, Abraham
Kuef anil other men charged with
graft and bribery. He was appointed
assistant to District Attorney Lang
don. Kuef caused the "boodle
board" of supervisors to remove
Ileney and appoint him to the post.
This move was blocked by the courts.
With the financial backing of Ku
dolph Spreekles and the able assist
ance of William J. Hums, formerly
in the United States secret service,
lh'ney soou obtained confessions of
grafting from the entire board of su
pervisors. Kuef was brought to trial
on the charge that he hud extorted
money from French restaurant pro
prietors. lie broke down in court and
pleaded guilty.
Next Schmitz was triad on the same
charge and convicted. Schmitz ap
pealed and the appellate court freed
him on the ground that the indictment
was faulty. 'Ibis decision freed Kuef
also. Kuef was tried later on another
charge. The jury disagreed and a
new trial was ordered. This was the
case in which a verdict of guilty has
been secured.
Since the trial of Kuef began a man
named Blake was convicted of tam
pering with the jury. lilake con
fessed iu court afterward that he had
been promised $10,000 by counsel for
Kuef if he would serve his term and
not testify for the state.

THEY WANT RESULTS.
Milk River Settlers Propose To Send
Committee to Washington.
*
At the annual meeting of the Milk
Kivur Irrigation association, which
was held at Malta, it was practically
decided to send another committee to
\\ ashington to urge greater expedi
tion in matters connected with the Milk
river project. A Malta dispatch to
the Great Falls Tribune gives this
report of the action taken at the meet
ing:
Considerable discussion was held
upon various phases of the project as
they appear to the settler, and the
loneensus of opinion was that an ef
fort must at once be made to get an
international agreement regarding the
waters of the Milk river in the very
near future. While an international
committee was appointed last spring
to adjust the water question satisfac
torily to the settlers on both sides of
the line, there has been but very little
done since; and settlers are getting
impatient. In the last few years the
Milk river valley has been settled up
by people from throughout the United
Slates, and the population is such
that the members of the association
believe if proper pressure was brought
upon the government some action
would be taken.
An endeavor will be made this win
ter to get the interior department to
appropriate a sum of money for the
entire Milk river project, so that work
mai be hastened on the entire canal
system from St. Mary's lake to Glas
gow. A large committee will un
doubtedly be sent to Washington
about the llrst of the year to look af
ter the interests of this project, and it
will probably stay in Washington
until some definite action is taken re
arding the matter.
After a most thorough discussion of
the entire affair it was decided to call
a special meeting of the association
for December 110, to again be held in
this city. At this meeting the pro
posed committee will be selected and
sent to Washington with instructions
to stay and do everything in its power
to interest the government officials in
the Milk river project, aud urge an
agreement as to the waters of St.
Mary's lake.,
Newman, of Havre, was re-elected

May Defeat Postal Savings Banks.
washington , Dec. 8.— a thorny
path confronts the postal savings
bank bili, in spite of the fact that its
passage is advocated in the republi
can national platform. When Sena
tor Carter secured an order to take
this measure up on December 11 it is
said he had the pledges of sufficient
votes to pass the bill in the senate.
The vote seems to have changed and
at present it is doubtful if Senator
Carter can rally anywhere near the
required number. In fact it is stated
he will fall short a dozen votes on the
republican side.
Investigations conducted abroad by
members of the national monetary
commission are largely responsible
for this change of sentiment in regard
to the establishment of postal savings
banks. Several members are now on
record in favor of the government
keeping out of the banking business
rather thau engaging in this new pol
icy
Opposed To Tariff Commission.
washington , Dec. S.—Herbert K.
Miles of the tariff committee of the
National Association of Manufac
turers, assumed the stand before the
house ways and means committee to
day. lie continued his arguments for
tariff revision downward. The
schedules which Mr. Miles claimed
can be materially reduced are those
imposing a tariff on sugar, glass and
hides.
Mr. Miles said that the duty on
lower grades of textiles could be re
duced, while the higher grades could
be increased. The witness declared
that '.»0 per cent of the manufacturers
want a tariff commission or bureau to
handle the revision of the tariff. Re
plying to this suggestion, Chairman
Payne said:
"1 am confident that the man en
gaged iu business wants to know that
tariff rates are settled and not sub
ject to any changes. I don't think
there could be any greater harm to
the country than would result from
having a body of men constantly
advocating changes iu the tariff."
Kcpresentativc Underwood ( dem. i of
Alabama, agreed with Mr. Payne as
to the iuadvisability of having a tar
iff commission.
ijuttk, Dec. Victor North has
been pardoned by Governor Norris
and will, if the state board of par
dons sees tit to ratify the pardon, be
