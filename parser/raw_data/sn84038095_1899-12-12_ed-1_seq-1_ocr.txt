Will Retreat to Queenstown,
Invasion of Free State Territory Is De
layed—Reinforcements For Him Cannot
Arrive For Several Weeks—Number of
British Captured Is 679.
LONDON, Deo. 12.—No further news
has been received to remove the ^nys
tery overhanging General Gatacre's re
treat from Stormberg. He has not yet
forwarded the promised additional mes
sage and the censorship has prevented
the correspondents from explaining the
matter. Stormberg ia described as a
stronger position that Laing's Nek.
The only road leads through lofty hills
and flanking is impossible* Colesburg
is also said to be an almost impregnable
position, and as no troops are available
to reinforce the columns acting in those
directions, it becomes evident that Gen
eral Gatacre's misfortune or error will
delay the invasion of the Free State
perhaps some weeks. It is exceedingly
probable that he will be compelled to
retire on Queenstown and to wait for
reinforcements, which can hardly reach
him until Sir Charles Warren's division
arrives at the Cape. The first detach
ments will sail Saturday uext. Even if
General French is not compelled to re
treat, lie will be obliged to pause in his
advance.
It now seems certain that the Seventh
division which is being mobilized at
Aldershot will be sent to South Africa.
No news has been received concerning
the Boer report of the capture of 50
prisoners at Modder River from Gen
eral Methuen's column. It. is just
two months since the Transvaal ulti
matum was delivered. Nine engage
ments have been fought and the British
have lost 566 killed, 2,207 wounded and
1,907 missing or prisoners.
The war office has issued a notice that
after January 1, that a deduction will
be made from the pay of soldiers serv
ing in South Africa for wives and chil
dren. The order indicates a belief that
the campaign will be a long one. It is
announced from Cape Town that the
Boers have succeeded in repairing the
Leeuwfontein bridge, between Storm
berg and Burghersdorp, which the Brit
ish destroyed on retiring.
Commandant Swanepol, who com
manded the Boer forces at Stormberg,
has been replaced by a Scotchman
named Robertson.
FREERE CAMP, Natal, Deo. 13.—The
British cavalry reconnoitered yesterday
abreast with Oolenso and exchanged
shots with parties of Boers, who fell
baok across the river. The kopjes were
observed to be thiokly occupied by the
enemy. The railroad bridge at Colenso
has been completely destroyed. Two
•tone piers were blown up last night.
Xhe highway bridge is intaot.
Boers Captnre Three Gnns.
PRETORIA, Deo. 13.—The Boers cap
tured three British gnns in the engage
ment with General Gatacre's foroe at
Stormberg. The sortie at Kimberley
last Sunday was an attempt to take the
Boer position at Kamperdam and to se
cure the waterworks. All the British
•hots fell short.
Six hundred and seventy-two British
prisoners were taken at Stormberg. In
the fighting at Modder river yesterday
General Cronje maintained his position
and captured 50 British soldiers.
Lawtou Occupies San Miguel.
MANILA, Dec. 12.—General Lawton,
with the Thirty-fifth infantry and four
troops of the Fourth cavalry, has occu
pied San Miguel without a fight. The
insurgent commander, General Del
Pilar, who n. ide his headquarters there
with supposi lly the largest foroe of in
surgents north of Manila, is believed to
have divided his men into scattering
bands. The inhabitants have petitioned
for a strong garrison.
Colonel Hayes with cavalry had two
brushes with the insurgents, the Amer
icans having two wounded.
Seventy insurgents attacked a com
missary bull train returning from Capas
to Tarlac. The drivers escaped with
the loss of their rations and effects.

Overstreet Opens the Debate
on Currency Bill. 0
Characterized by All the Wit and Ele
gance of the Iowan—De Arinond of Mis
souri the Heavy Gun on the Democratlo
Side MoClelland Opposes the Bill.
WASHINGTON, Deo. 12.—The feature
of the opening day of the debate on the
currency bill in the house was the
speech of Dolliver (la.). It was char
acterized by all the wit and eloquence
for which the Iowan is noted and held
the members, without regard to party,
for more than an hour. Mr. Dolliver
declared, that the last doubt of the Re
publican party as to the wisdom of en
acting the gold standard into law had
been dissolved by the experience of the
business world during the past three
years. He scored Mr. Bryan and gen
erally ridiculed the prophecies of the
Democrats in 189G. De Arniond (Mo.)
was the heavy gun on the Democratic
side. He warned the Republicans from
the west that they could not deceive
their constituents in congressional elec
tions by claiming that they had yielded
to the wishes of their colleagues in
caucus.
Overstreet (Ind.) opened the debate
in support of the bill and Maddox (Ga.)
replied to him. McClellan (N. Y.) was
the only other speaker. He announced
his opposition to the bill on the ground
that it would contract the currency, ex
tinguish the bank notes -and enhance
the value of coin bonds. He appealed
to those of his Democratic colleagues
from New York, who it is reported in
tend to vote for the bill, not to do so.
MASON TALKS FOR BOERS.
Resolution Extending Sympathy to Soutb
Africans S»nt to Committee*
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.—An appeal by
Masou (Ills.) for an expression of sym
pathy for the Transvaal republio. in the
war with Great Britain was the feature
of the senate proceedings yesterday. It
was the first formal speech delivered
this session and was listened to with
thoughtful attention by the members
and a large gallery of auditors. In
closing he said: "I have not not sought
to excite prejudice by our past differ
ences with England. They are for
gotte-l %gfl forgiven. But when the
colors of a republio are struck and we
sit silent, it would seem that we are
ashamed or tired of our institutions and
by our silence give consent the de
struction of self-government in Africa.
The statue of 'Liberty Enlightening
the World* in New York harbor is
neither a myth, fiction nor a
lie. We may say without boast
ing that if self-government is
right, we have helped the world. If
I am right this resolution will help. It
will say to the world Washington, Mon
roe and Webster are dead but the
American policy still lives. It may
sting the oppressor, bat it will be a mes
sage of affection and hope to the strug
gling republio."
The resolution on which Mr. Mason
based his speech was referred to the for
eign relations committee, Lodge (Mass),
considering it too delicate a question in
view of the position of this government
to pass upon without serious considera
tion.
No business oHmportance was trans
acted by the senate and an early ad
journment was taken.
Thinks the President Erred.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 12.—In response
to an invitation to attend an anti-im
perial mass meeting to be held at the
Academy of Music on the oentennial an
niversary of the death of George Wash
ington, Dec. 14, the following letter has
been received from ex-Secretary of State
John Sherman, dated Washington, Deo.
9: "I have a strong conviction that the
president erred in sending soldiers to
the Philippines to take possession of
their country. The United States had
wisely, as I think, assisted the Filipinos
in driving the Spaniards out of the
Philippine islands and should, I think,
have aided them in protecting their
country against all assaults. He, no
doubt, was advised to adopt the meas

didates odav. The meeting of the com

purpose of conferring with Senator Goe
