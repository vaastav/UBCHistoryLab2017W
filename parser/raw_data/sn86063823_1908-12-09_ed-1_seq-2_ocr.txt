The Inheritance m views of the
President are calculated to cause a
Climber of the possessors of swollen
fortunes to sit up and take notice.
President Roosevelt believes in the
larger Navy and accordingly has aslc
ed Congress for money for the build
ing of four battleships of the largest
type and two hospital ships.
It will be noted that Aldrich, in the
Senate and Payne, to the House, both
reactionaries of the most pronounced
type, seem to have been able to main
tained their grip upon the present
Congress.
The message of President Roose
velt to Congress was, like all of his
messages, a long one. having in the
neighborhood of twenty-five thousand
words. It advocated many things de
sired and demanded by the people.
President Roosevelt In his message
yesterday to Congress called for the
early admission of New Mexico an i
Arizona as States into the Union. The
matter is thus placed up to Congress,
' and in its hands is the redeeming of
the pledge given by the Republican
(National Convention at Chicago last
summer. "Whether Congress will do
its part remains to be seen.
Delegate Andrews has hopes that
the statehood blU will get through
says, "the time is very short." The
Record would like to know what that
has to do with it. Andrews must have
known all about the time when he
declared agam and again that state
hood was a certainty this winter, ev
en pledging himself to resign his seat
' in Congress if he proved to be mistak
en.
The New York World is not the
best of authority when the truthful-
cess of any tale is to be considered,
but, nevertheless Congress should go
to the bottom of the story that the
Panama Canal was bought by Ameri
. can citizens from Prance for twelve
millions of dollars and sold to the
United States for forty millions. The
American citizens in question are sup
posed to be Charles P. Taft, brother
of the President-elect; an uncle of the
President and certain New York fi
nanciers.
VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF THE
NAME NEW MEXICO
Hon. H. B. Fergusson has written
a vigorous defense of the name of New
Mexico and protesting against the ad
- mission of New Mexico as a state un
der the name of Lincoln, his article
as published In the Albuquerque Jour
nal "being as follows:
Shall the historic -name "New
Mexico" be obliterated from the map
of the United States np on the creat
ion of a new state with the boundar
ies of the present territory of New
Mexico? Shall this be done even for
the sake of acquiring the great name
of Lincoln for the new state?
This has suddenly become a very
Jive question in consequence of your
editorial advocacy of such change of
name, seconded by some of the most
Influential newspapers in Ola country
; outside of New Mexico. )
: Such change of name It seems to
me, would be most Inadvisable. . '
Historically, the present area of
the United States was acquired by,
owned by, populated, civilized and
Christianized by, three of the greatest
civilized nations of Europe; the Span-
Ion of their churches and consecrated
burial grounds.
The attachment of our citizens of
Spanish descent to the traditions of
the Spanish raoe is not exceptional.
What one of us of English hlood is
not proud of the Ibarons -who' wrested
the great charter of Hherty. from IClng
John ; of the masterfulness of Crom
well: of the charge at Balaklava? Or
or Irish 'blood, -who does notf feel - a
pride at the mention of the eloquence
of COonfcell, the story of - Robert Bm-
mett or theHAeadastnes of PrnmeU?
We are a great composite nation,
composed of the blood of all the great
civilized races; and it makes for: good
citizenship In the United States, that
the descendants in our country -of the
great races take .pride in the glories
of their respective ancestral -people
Such change of name -would add noth
ing to the assured fame of Lincoln;
and It would do away with much of
ish, the French and the English. And
