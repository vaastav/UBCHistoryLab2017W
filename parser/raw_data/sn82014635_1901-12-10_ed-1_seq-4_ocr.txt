DOWN WITH THE ANARCHISTS.
"Down with the anarchists" is a cry now being echoed
and re-echoed around the world, a refrain that is being
sustained in the prints and discussed in legislative halls
everywhere. But what is an anarchist? Who is he?
Where is he? These are questions which are being found
hard to answer. Only after he has cropped out as an as
sassin, or has been caught in some overt act, are we sure
of him. When it comes to drawing a legal definition, or
to giving such a definition as would do for the basis of a
law, the problem becomes a difficult one. The teachings
of Tolstoi, Krapotkin and other socialists who dream of a
personal freedom in which there shall only be a minimum
of legal restraint, of an ideal society without rulers where
all shall be on a level and brothers, may be impractical,
they may be but dreamers, yet the teachings of these in
spire tho Emma Goldmans and the Herr Mosts, from whose
ranks spring the Czolgoszes, the Guiteaus, et aL Un
questionably there is a line between the socialist and the
anarchist, be tween the progressionist and the assassin,
but who can define it in such legal terms as will prove
constitutional? In short, is there any sure and compre
hensive way for getting rid of anarchists, and of possible
assassins other than by classing all such people as crim
inals, or as insane, and putting them en masse into
asylums or into penal institutions?
Following the assassination of the president of the
French republic the United States congress came within
a single objection, made under the rules, of passing a law
against anarchy, which would in all probability have saved
the life of McKinley by making a Czolgosz improbable, ;
If not impossible. It was a non-partisan measure and both
houses and all the committees to which it had been re
ferred were unanimous in Its favor, but a New York con
gressman, by the name of Warner, who had other fish to
fry, or who represented a faction which the bill would
hit, objected to its unanimous consideration, so it was lost
I seems that every attempt in the past to nationally legis
late against anarchism has been frustrated by minorities j
who have deigned no explanation. But the people of the j
United States are so unanimously demanding a congres-j
sional enactment, now, that some measure more or less
definite and drastic may be looked for. A number of bills
have already been introduced and others proposed.
Speaking of the difiiculty found in defining anarchism,
the North American Review of this current month is
largely taken up by prominent statesmen in the discussion
of this problem wliich Interests all governments, whether
republics, kingdoms or absolute monarchies. The mostj
comprehensive or learned disquisition, the one getting
nearest the pith of the matter, in our estimation, as it is
the one wnich most nearly shows how difficult it is to j
define the anarchism which breeds assassins, is from the
pen of Spain's ambassador to the United States. Spain i
a a monarchy has been struggling with this problem for
centuries. The writer holds that a single country can cope
with the trouble, but that, by united international effort,
through the police forces of all, this menace to life and
to all legally constituted government, may be suppressed,
if not entirely obliterated.
Anarchism, in being Inspired by a hatred of tyranny
In part, or being based on the idea that any government
for intelligent human beings is an unneccessary burthen,
is at bottom the child of a partial edcuation. There is no
more danger from the man without any education than
from the man with a liberal education, so far as anarchism
goes. The anarchist, if properly enlightened, would never
turn assassin.

THINGS ARE GROWN IN KANSAS,
When It comes to the total value of annual aggregate
results, to net profits of its orchards, fields and pastures,
Kansas, in now ranking the average state, will In a very
few years be recognized as among the leading agricultural
states. Tho editor of "American Investments," a monthly
journal of standard authority, devoted exclusively to the
interests of American Investors, published in Buffalo, New
York, in speaking of the "corn belt," says Incidentally of
Kansas:
"So conflicting are the opinions of people regarding the
latitude and longitude of tho 'corn belt,' that we very much
question whether any two minds agree on tho subject.
Tf here never has been and there is not now any rule by which
the 'belt can be fixed, and when it has once been estab
lished by general consent and approval, the lines are liable
to be changed by altered agricultural conditions. If we
are not in error, the state of Illinois boasted of having
this 'belt' wholly within its borders, but now Iowa, Ne
braska, Missouri and Kansas have a good substantial
flaim for it The fact is uncontroverted that during the
iie years ending with 1900, much abused Kansas grew
5S7S.433.347 worth of wheat and corn, outranking all other
plates, and as a strictly corn-producing state, Kansas ranks
fifth on the list It is well not to 'sneer the lip when
speaking of Kansas. Things are grown there." v

s RELIABLE ANECDOTES OF M'KINLEY.
Stories about President McKinley are now being col
lected from every ' possible source. The result is a most
thrilling and varied illumination of a well-loved character.
Among the newest anecdotes' collected are the following:
An. intimate friend, with whom he was chatting one
day on the subject of his, will, remarked upon the small-
ness of the president's estate; whereupon Mr. McKinley
said: "No, I don't leave much, but what I do leave was
honestly acquired, for it never cost anybody a tear or my
country a penny."
A number of senators were talking on the different
forces and powers of the world, and the conversation
drifted to' the subject of the heads of statest "I don't envy
any one of-them the power which Providence has given
to then," said the president "but there is one thing of
which I may be allowed to boast, which is, I fear no man.
I fear neither the revolver, nor the burglar, nor the spleen
of an injured citizen" a curious and pathetic sentiment
in the light of what occurred at Buffalo.
Mr. McKlaley was a carefulreader; he slowly digested
every line and every sentiment printed and expressed;
that no doubt was the effect of his legal training. He
cared little for fiction, but one day a friend caught him
reading a popular novel and expressed surprise. "Well,"
said Mr. McKinley, "there's more reality about fiction
than there is about fact and it takes me longer to read it
than a state treaty. Come In in about a fortnight's time
and you will .probably hear that I have got about half way
through this book, and what I read I remember for a life
time."
Like the father of M. Loubet, president of the French
republic, Mr. McKinley's mother shook her head doubt
fully when she was congratulated on her son's ascension
to the highest position in the v country. "I would rather
William were a Methodist bishop than anything else in
the world," she said. ,
The late president was, in his early life, intended for
the ministry. When a lad of sixteen, his brother David,
who was the superintendent of a coal mine, came into his
room where William was studying his Latin grammar,
and peremptorily ordered him to-harness his pony by a
certain time in order to go to a dance. When he had gone,
William turned around to his aunt and said: "Aunt
don't you think it is humiliating for a Methodist to have
to hitch up a horse for a brother to go to a dance?"
A smart young lady on seeing the president rising to
leave church after the service was over, broke all prece
dent, and, standing upon one of the benchs, waved her
lace handkerchief and called out "Three cheers for the
president" The cheers thundered out in the sacred edifice
and the president acknowledged them with becoming
gravity.
HOLD-UP OF THE RED ONION.
BAD GRAMMAR A DISEASE.
The recent visit to .Chicago of a number of Germans
who are concerned about educational matters, is bringing
results. Evidently they have informed the Berlin profes
sors of the startling departure from traditional lines
which has attracted the attention of the University of
Chicago, and made life in the city by the lake less sombre
than its pall of soft-coal smoke would Indicate. The Ameri
can peril which menaces Europe is not exclusively indus
trial, but includes the educational also; and just as the
German manufacturers have adopted American methods,
so the Berlin professors have been induced to enter into
competition with tho original and entertaining professors
at Chicago's educational midway.
The hrst product of the German attempt at yellow
school teaching was the announcement of Professor Zim
mer that the world's penal systems are all wrong. That
the person who murders another in a fit of fury should -not
be punished, but on .the contrary, should bo embraced as
having experienced a moral purification. The Herr Pro
fessor affirmed that man has within him a liability to
smallpox and to anger. As vaccination will exhaust that
upon which the disease seizes, so will great anger which
ends in homicide exhaust a man's power of murderous
intensity. In other words, a murder in passion is a moral
bath, which leaves the murderer a better citizen and a
better man than is he who has never washed his hands in
human gore.
The first effort to rival the sensationalism of the Chi
cago professors Is highly creditable. It might almost have
come from the lakeside university. The second attempt is
even more successful. Professor Liebmann, who graces the
Berlin University, affirms that bad grammar is a disease,
like the mumps or rheumatism. To a people like the
Americans, whq have been taught that drunkenness is
a disease of the physical system which can be cured by
squirting gold chloride under the skin, the idea of bad
grammar as a malady should not be surprising. There Is
no reason why bad spelling should not be included in the
list of distinct ailments of the. brain and nervous system.
The professor maintains that grammar is not an arbitrary
creation of man, but is based on solid principles. It has
been evolved from the noun, and could be nothing else
than it is. He assumes that If there be other worlds in
habited by sentient beings, their grammar must be our own.
ROOSEVELT ON IRRIGATION.
President Roosevelt in his message to congress, has
presented an adjustment of the trouble ebtween Kansas
nnd Colorado, as to the right of the use of the waters of the
Arkansas river. Unintentionally, we believe, he gives the
Jatter state two or three "jabs in the slats." which cer
tainly will force her to the realization that her present at
titude in this matter is not justifiable.
The chief executive recommends that congress take
such Treasures as will lead to the construction, of im
mens1 reservoirs at the headwaters of the large streams,
vheixin the flood waters can be stored, and in the dry
Ecascns b? tarnld into nature's canals to take their natural

The nisht it happened -was a dull one
at the Red Onipn, because there was a,
shindig up at Moll Doyle's and all tho
high-flyers were there bent on making"
a night of it. At midnight cuuek Ken
nedy let his har-tender and his two
daalers go, got down off the lookout,
shut' up the faro box and the stud-poker
deal and said to the few players in the,
room:
"Here, fellows, 'f you want to play It's
got to be rouletio.'r nothing. Far as
Fm concerned I'd as lief shut up."
Then to Hitchcock, the young English
man, whose play alone hud made the
night worth while to the house:
".Luck again you, eh? How much 'r
you out?"
"More than I care to say," murmured
Hitchcock, slipping his pile into his coat
pockets and standing' up. "I'm hit hard.
Chuck, but if you don't mind I'll bet a
few on the wheel."
Two of the players dropped out and
slunk out of the lamp-lighted room. A
Mexican tanner, who smelled of his trade,
Connolly, the one-eyed hack driver, and
Hitchcock were all that sat in at the'
roulette board. They bet dollars where
the Englishman bet tens, and Chuck felt
sorry for the stranger.
"Better quit. Hitchcock," he growled
as he swept another hundred off the
board and split a stack of whites between
Connolly and the Mexican. "Don't you
never get tired losing? I'm tired o
winning YOURnoney."
The flushed, weary eyes of the for
eigner looked at Kennedy's for a mo
ment. "You can't win forever." he murmured
drowsily. "I've got to get even, GOT to.
Hear that, Mr. Kennedy?"
The gamblor allowed that he "wasn't
doaf," smiled sleepily and rolled again.
This time Hitchcock cashed, but the
Mexican and Connolly lost and quit.
"They ought to be a load up to
Moll's," said the hack driver, passing in
his little pile of chips, "and I got to get
busy. G'nlght, Chuck! G-'night, gentle
men!" And out he walked, while the Mexican
curled up in a chair to watch the game
and Hitchcock built his towers of ivory
on the red spots. He watched with fur
tive eagerness the little ball as it
whirred and spun around the moving
groove, listened to It tinkling across the
brass divisions, bounding In and out as
it struck the sloping center and finally
settled on the black!
Kennedy reached for the Englishman's
white castles in Spain and swept them
into the drawer. The player's mouth
was drawn and blue. He looked at the
Mexican and then at Kennedy's white,
nervous fingers. He glanced about the
silent room. They were alone these
three. Hitchcock made no move to play
again.
"All in?" queried Chuck.
"I've got another hundred up at the
hotel," drawled the Englishman. "If
you'll just wait till "
"Not on your life," blurted tha dealer.
"I'm tired. I give you a run for your
money and, as I told you first, 'taln't
your night to win."
"But I've lost nearly six thousand,
Kennedy; I'm entitled to "
"You're entitled to lose sixteen thou
sand 'f you don't know when to quit.
That's what. I'm going to bed. It's 2
o'clock.-"
Kennedy took his pistol off ths edge of
tho table and slipped it Into his holster.
He -"drew a buckskin bag out of the
drawer and dropped the "bank" and tho
winnings Into it. It was a bad move. He
should have put the money away before
the pistol, but Kennedy was sleepy. His
eyelids -were heavy, but he looked up
when he heard the Mexican grunt and
bawled: f
"Git, greaser! Go to b-e-d?" with a
rising inflection.
He sa,w the Mexican's frightened eyes
fixed on Hitchcock, and following their
warning flash turned slowly round and
looked quite narrowly into the muzzle of
tho Englishman's six'shooter.
"Drop the bag, Kennedy, If you please,",
said the. .broken but deliberate gam
bler. The bag, fat. w'ith his thousands of pa
per and gold, chugged on the oilcloth
top of tho roulette.
"Look out!" a3 he saw Kennedy's hand
swing slightly backward, "hold them
up, higher, higher. That's It"
"I bato to do r,it, Kennedy," said
Hitchcock, backing? slowly toward tho
door and holding: tils artillery level at
the dealer's face?' VFact Is, the money
wasn't mine.; belonged to sister, sick
sister and I couldn't stand '
He was gone! In an instant Kennedy
had out his gun and started for tho steps
down which he heard Hitchcock bound
ing. He had reached the hallway below
just as the Englishman swung into the
saddle. Tho pony, struck with the spurs,
bounded away like a catapult.
Then Chuck, tricked at his own oft
practiced gun play, outwitted by a ten
derfoot who hadn't been in camp two
weeks, hoard the cluttering, far-off music
of Old Moll's overworked piano, wonder

already far out on tha mesa. But there
was no hope for It but to organize pur

daybreak he had turned over the "bus

with Pat HIckey, the sheriff, and Butch
Holiday, the foreman from Maxwell's,
was off across the mosa after Hitch
cock. "He's raakin' fur tho railroad," said
HIckey, as the trio swept away across
the wind-swept tables of sand, "just like
a sneakin' tenderfoot."
And sure enough at noon they were j
riding in his tracks as they led into

corral and a water tank. Hitchcock had j
