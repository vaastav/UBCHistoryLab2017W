Synopsis cf the President's Message
Washington, Dee. 7. The message
opens as follows: In uVin 1 1 1 i n my
seventh annual message Congress
in the Ceutentilal year of our national
existence as a free unci independent
people.lt ali'ordsniegreat pleasure tore
cur to the advancement thai has been
made from the time of the colonies,
one hundred years ago. We were then
a people numbering nly three mil
lions, now we nuinher more than forty.
Then Industries were confined a I in oh t
exclusively to ttie tillage if the noil,
now manufactures absorb much f the
labor of the country. Our liln-rtit u re
main unimpaired, the bondsmen have
been freed from slavery, and we have
become possessed of the respect i'' not
the friendship of all civilized nations.
Graphic uud well worded details
follow,
ONSTtTCTIoNAI. AMDNl'MKNll Mil
(if.'STKl). The President earnestly recom
mends that a Constitutional Amend
ment he submitted to the Legislature,
malting it the duty of each Slate to
establish and forever maintain free
public schools adequate to the educa
tion of all children in the elementary
brauehes within their respective lim
its, irrespective of sex, color, birth
place or religion ; forbidding the teach
in" in said schools of religion of
atheistic or pagan tenets, and prohib
iting the granting of any school funds
or school taxes, or any part thereof,
either by lepisl itive, municipal or
other authority, for; the betieilt or in
aid directly or indirectly of any relig
ions sect or denomination, or in aid or
lor the benefit of any other object of
any nature or hind whatsoever.
He alludes to the importance of cor
recting the evil of vast amounts l
tiutaxed Church property, and est-
mates that by l.S!J, ir unchecked, thi
properly will reach a sum exeeeilini;
ihree thousand million dollars. He
would suggest the taxation of all prop
erty equally, excepting only the last
resting place of tile dead.
FOKKlCiN KKLATIONK.
Relations with most foreign powers
contiuue on u satisfactory and trtemfly
looting. The President is happy to un-
nounce the passage of an act by I lie
i ieneral Cortes of 1'ortugal abolishing
slavery in the colonies. The past year
lias furnished no evidence or an ap
proaching termination of the ruinous
conflict which lias been raging for sev
en years in Cuba. The same disregard
of the laws ot civilized wariare and me
just demands of humanity which have
heretofore called forth, expressions oi
condemnation from the nations of
Christendom have continued to black
en the sad scene. Desolation, ruin aud
pillage are pervading the rich fields of
one of the most fertile and productive
regions of the earth, and the incendia
ry's torch, tiring plantations and valu
able factories audbuildingH,is the agent
mat king the alternate advance and re
treat of the contending parties. The
President narrates the damage to the
interests of all commercial nations, es
pecially those of the United Btates, aud
;he insecuiity of property owned by
citizens of the United (States iu Cuba.

ecaue of this Dope, and from au ex
treme reluctance to interfere lu the
illairsof another and friendly nation
le has patiently and anxiously
iwaited the progress of events. The
rated bauds of either side now occupy
he crouuds as iu the past. The Presi-
lent makes long arguments and con-
ludes: "A recognition ortheinde-
endence of Cuba being in my opinion
mpracticable and indefeasible, the
uestion wuicn next presents ltseit is
hat of the recognition of belligerent
ights in tbo parties to the contest."
Alter lurlher arguments u, rresi-
eut concludes : "The recogj iliou of
adependenoe or of belligerency, being,
l my judgement, equally uiaomissi
le. it remains to consider wnnt course
hull be adopted, should the conllict
lOtsoon be brought to an end by the
els of the parlies themselves, and
hould the evils which result there-
oiu affecting all nations, aud paiticti-
rly the United (state, continue, in
ich event I am of the opinion that
Llitr nations will be compelled to as-
lme the responsibility which devolves
non them and to seriously consider
ae only remaining measures possible
mediation and intervention.
RECOMMENDS NOTHING NOW.
After further statements he says:

ressed. I do not at this lime recom-
end the adoption cr any measure ot

i u discussing
FPBCIB RESUMPTION,
e Presideut suya: Too much stress
can hot be laid upon lliisqueslion, and
I hope Congress may be induce! m
the earliest day practicable to insure!
the consummation of the act of last
Congress, at its lust session, to bring
about specie re-unipttoii on and after
the first day l Junuury, 1ST!', at die
farthest. It would he a great blessing
if ttiis could be consummated, even
ut an earlier day. N'ihiii seems to
me more cert un than ilmt it foil,
healthy ai! permanent reaction can
not take pi ice in l.ivoi of llic indus
tries ami liuancial welfare of the coun
try, until we return to a niei-ute ol'
values recognize I throughout ibe civ
ilized world.
While we use a currency imt i qui vu
leiil to I bis standard, the worlo .- r -connizeil
standanl, sp-cie, bi-coines a
rommodity I ke proiluclsof the soil,
the surplus seeking a market wherever
there is a demand for it. Under our
present s. sie. in we should wanliome,
pur would we have any were it not
Mint ciisloms due are paid in coin, ami
because of our pledges to pay interest
on the public debt in coin, the yield
of precious metals would flow out tor
the purchasers of f.m htn productions,
and leave the United Stall s hewers ol
wood and drawers of water, bee iin-e ol
wiser legislation on the subject of
llnauce by nations with whom we
have dealings.
I am not prepared to say that I can
suggest the best legislation to secure
the end most heartily recommended.
It will bsj a source of great gratifica
tion to me t i lie able to approve any
measure of Congress looking ell'eelual
l.v toward securing resumption.
Unlimited inll ition would probably
bring about specie paymeuia more
speedily than any legislation i ioum
to tin- redemption of legal tenders in
coin, but H would be at I lie ex; euse of
honor. The iej;al lenders would have
no value beyond settling our present
liabilities, or, properly speaking, re
pudiating tlieiu. They would buy
nothing; afier all debts were set: led.
There are a few measures which
seem to me important in Ibis connec
tion, and which 1 commend to your
earnest consideration. A repeal of so
much legal lender acts us makes these
rules leceivable for debts contracted
after a certain date, to be fixed in the
act itself, say not later than the first
of January, 17", a hearty reaction
would set in lit once, uud Willi it u de
sire to make the currency equal to
what it purports to he. 1'iist, lie
elaborates the good ell'ects which would
follow this suggestion, hecond, that
the (Secretary of the Treasury be au
thorized to redeem say not to exceed
two million dollars monthly of legal
tender notes, by issuing la their stead
a long bong bearing 3.05 per cent,
of denominations ranging from fifty
to one thousand dollars each. Third,
that additional power be given the
Secretary of the Treasury to accumu
late Mhl for the final redemption,
either by increasing the leveuue or
decreasing expenses, or both. It is
preferable to do both. The restoration
of duty on tea and coffee is also sug
gested. Also a reduction on certain
articles, such as hardly pay for the cost
of collection, and such as enter into
manufactures.
AIIOUT CLAIMS.
He suggests that some better means
be found for bringing claims aguinst
the government than through a court
of claims, especially those growing out
of the late war. They are, in nearly
every iustance, exorbitant. Discussing
the report of the riecretary of War, he
invites special attention to making
$300,000 of the subsistence appropria
tion available before the beginning of
the next fiscal year, the repeal of the
law abolishing mileage and a return to
the old system ot appropriation for tor
pedo trials by the corps of engineers,
and a permanent organization for the
signal corps.
THK NAVY.
The condition of our navy at this
time, he savs. is a source of satisfac
tion. Reviewing details of defects as
compared with other nations, be says :
But neither our continental situation
or our foreign policy demand that we
should have a large number of these
crushing, powerful irou-clads, while
our position and the nature of our
ports combine to make those of other
nations little dangerous to us, under
any circumstances. Wo have lifty
warships, including fifteen iron-cluds
now in hand ou the Atlantic coast.
POSTAL BEltVICE.
The postal service is entirely satis
factory. The President suggests the
power of exclusion of merchandise
from the mails.
INDIAN AKKA1KS.
The method of treating with the In
dians adopted ut the beginning of my
tlrstterm, haa been steadily pursued
with satisfactory and encouraging re
sults. It has been productive of evi
dout improvement in the condition of
that race, and will be continued with
such modification us experience may
indicate to be necessary. He says of
the
IIUUEaU OK AGKll'l LTUUI--,
It bus accomplished much in dissemi
nating useful knowledge to the agri
culturalist, ami uUo in introducing
new uud useful productions adapted to
our climate, uud is worthy of the con
tinued encouragement of the (.ioveru
meiit. He characterizes the condition of
AKKAIKS JN UTAH
Assc.indulous, asan institution of po
lygamy should bo banished from
the land.
A this will be the last menage I
shall have the honor of submitting tfl
Congress before my successor is chosen,
I will repeat or recapitulate the ques
tions, which I deem of vital Impor
tance, which may be legislated upon
and settled at tiiis i.essiou.
First, that the (Stales shall bo requir
ed to atl'ord the opportunity of a good
com nion school uducatiou to every
child wjlbin their limit.
(Second, no sectarian tenets shall
ever be taught in any school, supported
In whole or in part by the State, na
tion, or proceeds of any tax levied up
on any community.
COMPULSORY EDUCATION.

sory so fir as toilcprive all persons who
can not Had and write from becoming

As it is the longest, so it is in respect to

intaresling of General (Irani' Messages :
and it is quite as iuu ortunt by reason of its
omi.-tion to refer in the remotest manner to
the condition of Hlliiirs in ,tlio reconstruc

treats. Perhaps tho President is of the
opinion that affairs are in so fair a way of

that Unngressionul truatinunt is not needed

From the Wuhinctvo llei'ubliouo.
To conclude, it is a document worthy of
tho man as well as characteristic of him. It
betrays throughout a depth of study which
bis enemies do not givo dim creditof being
capablo ot, and a capacity for close analy
sis of which nis friends and supporters may
well feol proud. Ho could not, constitu
ted as bo is, havo said moro or less regard
ing the subjects treated than lie lins I,
and if in gome future conimunic' o
Congress regarding tho affairs .)
Southern States bo spunks as plainly uud to
the point, as he undoubtedly will, the
American peoplo will give him credit for
having laid down tho law and gosplo of
true ltcpublicanisin, and having given
shape to the political contest in this coun
try for tho Centennial year.

duce religion us a controlling element in
our national politics, tbo zeal wilU which
be flings this iirobrand and tries to kindlo
theological animosities for party effect, is
the most mischievous and monstrous viola
tion of litnoss and propriety ever perpetra
ted by u President of tho United (states.
Laboring for Drunkard i.
Saturday was set apart by the evungelisU
especially' for tho benefit of drunkards who
bad been unable to conquer tlio demon of
alcoholic stimulus. Among the various
groups was a young girl, whoto face, sweet
us an angel's, was already furrowed by
grief, liusido her was a father, whom she
seemed to worship, and this lather, broken
down in health, and almost ruined in mind
by the cxersfivo use of liquor, teemed ut
lust to liavo resigned himself to hopeless
ruin, lie ga.nd about i.i a half sleepy,
half childisii way. and several times at
tumpting to gel up un 1 leave, his seat, but
the bard of the - Id woman held his very
tightly, and uutli ! i.u would conquer
his ro-tlcssness n o i down. As Air.
Moody declared on i .i.nl over again that
the God who bad oncu cist out devils could
do it now, r.nd would do it aguin if only as
ked, and as fervent supplications for this
l)ivino interposition were made, tho cloud
seemed to rio from all hearts, the noonday
sun poured in upon tho picture hko blcsacd
rays of hopo ; eyes, long dimmed by tears
beamed with a new light; lips so long
tightly pressed by anguish smiled with a
new-found joy, and dissipated faces lost
their reck lees look and become ro'ululn in
tho strength of noblo determination. It is
probable, that moro than one slave was
freed yesterday, and more than one lieurt
made bappy.
The Last Temple
Thu be t Kuropean temple in which pub
lic worship was paid to Iho old divinities is
said to have been that of Apollo at Monte
C'asaim, which remained open until its dis
tinction by Uenedict in it'.". Since then
the human mind has wandered in muiiy
niaz-es and labored under dreary hallucina
tions without end. WhoshulUay, in these
days of decaying faiths, how near Vollairo'i
prediction may como to fulfilment Y Duy
by duy the cluimi of science to universal
priesthood are urged with increasing confi
dence. The old mythology trinpid of its
imagery (it may ba said), uniduahr.ed and
resoWou into iu pristine elements, is a sys
tem of natural pilosophy ; and modern
science in its lutest phase is httlo more than
a return to the old opinions under a now
nomenclature. It would be strange, in
deed, if tha rumor of Pan's death, promul
gated so long ago, should prove unrounded
after all I Fraser's Magi'.r.ine.

What is more tendor than a mother's love.
To the swuet infant fondling in her arms ?
What arguments need her compassion move
To bear its cries, and help it in its harms?
Now if the teuderest mother were possessed
Of all the love within ber single breast,
Of all tbe mothers linca tbe world began,
'Tie nothing to tbo love of God to man.

A little boy had died. Ilia body won
laid out In u darkened room, waiting
to he laid in the cold grave. His af
flicted mother and bereaved little bister
went iu to look at the aweet face ol the
precious little sleeper, for his face was
beautiful even iu death. As they
stood gazing on the face of one so he-
loved and cuerished, the little girl
asked to shake his baud. The mother
at tlrst did no! think it best, hut the
child repeated the reipiest, and seemed
very anxious about it; she took the
cold, bloodless band of her sleeping
boy and placed it in the hands of his
weeping little sister.
The dear child looked ut it a mo
ment, caressed it fondly, and then
looked up to her mother through tears
ami love, ami said :
" My mother, this hatid neverstruck
me."

As the rays come from the sun nod

The'New York Times, noticing
th
e.-cape of Jln-s Tweed, says:
"In all probability Tweed was spir-
it
1 awuv v, rv soon utter he left IjUO-
I iw-street Jail. The necessary arrange
ments had doubtless been inudc before
hand, and all that Dunham and lis
gan had lo do was to keep out of Iho
way until after dark, and thus give tha
'old man' I he hem lit of u long start
atuinl. Thedsy was, of course, care
fully chosen live steamers sailed for
Kuropo, ami Tweed might have been
safely smuggled on board almost any
one of t In m, under cover of a simple
disguise. The (iei man steamer sailed,
we believe, at two in the afternoon R
convenient hour. Tweed whs proba
bly well out on tin" Atlantic, comfort
ably tucked up in his In rfh, long be
fore Dunham went tolhe polit e station
with his cock-and-bull story. Any
body who supposes t tint he will ever
be seen in Sew York again must have
a degree of confidence in the resources)
of justice which may be very charm

much experience or observation in
this city."
A visitor at the Confederate (Ions

Washington (Special to tho Cincinnati
(Jaxette.
The Blue Ridge Railroad.
From the Charleston News and Courier.
The movement to revive this great
work is attracting general attention.
Kuoxville is on the alert, and a Con
vention will be held in that City, on
the 20th of next month, to consider a
proposition tnude by the owners of the
Railroad to 1'aryville. The comple
tion of the Cincinnati Southern Koad
will leave a gap of only one hundred
and thirty-four miles between that
city and Clayton, Georgia, which is
south of Rabun Clap anil tho point
from which lines arc expected to radi
ate throughout Georgia and Bouth
Carolina. The Koad is com
pleted to llaryville, about twen
ty miles south of Knoxville,
and hence the projected line runs
up tbe Valley of the Little Tennessee,
to and through Kahun Uap, until it
leaches Clayton, iu Kahtni county. Of
the uncompleted portion thirty-seven
miles are iu 'iYiiiii ssce. eijjo' in North
Carolina and seventeen ' i Georgia.
The proposition bcfoie H e Kuoxville
Bourd of i iaile, from u e Maryville
Isoad. is to build a narrow-gange
road to "VMliullu, if flic city of Knox
ville v ogree to pay Ihcnt live hun
dred i - -o i ni dollars us soon as the
road is tt'iii; l,'.nl.
Walhalla is tv. i ii'.v t wo miles from
Clayton, and the gap between the two
points must be tilled in order to tap
the railroad system of Bouth Carolina.
A committee has been appointed to
confer with the mukers cf (he propo
sition, and the result will be commu
nicated to the meeting to be held in
January.
It needs no expiation or argument to
convince Charleston that (he comple
tion of the Blue liidge Railroad would
make tho fortune of )his City. The
Mountain Counties of Bouth Carolina
will do what they ran. Kast Tennes
see is ready to put money iu Cue Koad.
It is very important that Charleston
and the whole country between the
mountains and the coast should be rep
resented und heard at the Knoxvillo
Convention; and we hope that every
County, Charleston included, will send
a full delegation. This City already
controls the Kailroads from Charleston
to Wulhallu ; that is to say, the inter
ests of those lines are inseparable from
hers, nml If the connection with
Knoxville, via Wulhallu, can bo had,
the dark d;is of the low ami middle
country of BotiMi Carolina will be num
bered. I Tlie News nr:d Courier is mistaken
on this point. It is only fifty thou
sand dollars that Knoxvillo has been
asked f.ir, to bo paid when tho mud U
completed. Ki)H. CUKONl.'LE.l
