aft second class matter.
The primary election law of
V1 Wisconsin, passed by the, last scs
gi011 of the legislature, and one of
the championed measures of the
Hon. Reform Masquerade LaFoi
lelte, has, iu less than a year,
been found tov be so full of holes
that the governor, himself, has
taken fright and convoked the
solons in extraordinary session,
to rectify, if he can, the mistakes
committed, not only in the pri
mary law but all of the other pel.
measures. Now what do the in
surgents of South Dakota think
of that The Wisconsin primary
law is a rank affair, but the pro
posed measure that the insurgents
of this state endeavored to force
on the people, is even more rad
ical. In the short time that is
required to knock off twelve
months of time it is demonstrated
by the Wisconsin governor that

The football season has closed,
and well it may be. The game
as now played in most cities and
towns savors of the prize ring,
and in many instances excells the
fistic encounters for brutality.
Each season increases the long
list of deaths from accident or re
sultant from blows purposely de
livered ^y some member on a
team. Young men are sent to
educational institutions in pursuit
of useful, elevating knowledge,
not to train and cultivate the ani
mal force which is born in every
creature. The game is said to be
high-class sport, witnessed by
».thousands, among whom are the
i^olei'gv, educators, and the elete
iMiaset, whose homes have been dark
Ironed by untimely blotting out the

An awakening is at hand. The

that every institution of learning
in the land will forever bar the
diversion^!
rThe
only opposition to the re­
election of Congressman Burke
next year that has developed any
where in the state is in his home
ilHtown, and from a little coterie of
pot-house politicians whose am
bitions are greater than their
gratitude, whose selfishness is
greater than their loyalty to the
interests of their town and of the
state. Mr. Burke belongs to the
Estate and he cannot be retired at
he behest of a few jealous ueigh
ybors, none' of whom could till his

H£a hundred years. It takes years

In the Badger state he appears to
be held as a man of scintillation,
and evidently prefers to be so
considered while on the other
hand should he become senator
and go to Washington it is moie
than likely he would develop into
more shuck and nubbin. He
may, however, be following the
footprints of one David B. Hill,
who, elected senator from New
York, did not resign as governor
to become senator until a month
after the congress convened, ex
pecting to make a grand entry
into that august body. LaFol

I. Crawford, of insurgent-repub
lican fame, accuses the railroad
interests in the state of manipu
lating conventions and legislatures
of the state. Mr. Crawford hav
ing tilled the office of attorney
general of the state,.and having
been the chief counsel of a lead
ing railroad corporation in the
state, ought to be consistent with
his subject, but is he? The
strange part of all this breeze
stirring is that none of the so
called misdeeds occurred while
Coe-I. was in office, and ruling at
will over the state on the now
condemned passes. Naturally,
after having been defeated for
office these things loom into view,
but not before. The voter will
not take kindly to the present
day manipulations of the insur
gents' lieutenant.
The congress is in session and
Uncle Joe Cannon is speaker.
The president's message, the long
est. ever written by him, is brim
full of sound conservative advice
to the law-makers, and will be
recorded in history as a great
state paper. There are so many
questions touched upon that their
enumeration is forbidden. The
leading topics are the railroads
and rates, monopolies, foreign
problems, the army and navy,
immigration, the Panama canal,
the civil service, and the urging
of economy in the conduct of gov
ernment business. The message
furnishes the congress ample fuel
for the session. --I

play in a re ii I'ootball Unit was ac-lual
ly called by the satne name. The lie!
"was so liirso (hat no one. however
strong, could quite throw a stone from
one end to (lie other." aiul it was about
half us wide. Twenty, thirty or forty
persons could participate on a side, the
number being regulated by the size of
the available field. Goals were set up
at either end. No one was permitted to
strike the bull wjtli the outstretched
ami or with anything lie might: carry
in his hand: Nevertheless he was per
mitted to "strike the ball with what
ever part of his body that he pleased."
If the ball came rolling toward him
he was. allowed to kick it. the infer
ence being that if it were lying still he
could not do so. The field was divided
by a transverse line "into two eju 1
parts, and in the middle lay the ball.
The players were chosen, those who
were going to make up the opposing
parties, by means of colors, by which,
in the struggle of the contest, each
could recognize his own side. When
the signal was given by the roll of the
drum or the blast of a trumpet a play
er rushed forward, one who had been
chosen b.v lot to be the first to kick the
ball with his foot. This action was un
derstood to be the beginning of the
contest, so that after it it was permit
ted to no one from either party to seize
it, to strike it and to drive it as victor
over the goal. It was perhaps from
the method of beginning the game that
it was called football,"
