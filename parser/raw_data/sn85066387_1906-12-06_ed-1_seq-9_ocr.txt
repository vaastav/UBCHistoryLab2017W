SYNAGOGUE TO BE
RECONSTRUCTED
President Duffey of the Board of
TVorks continued the work of tearing
<iown dangerous •walls on Sutter street
yesterday with a gang of men. After
a consultation of architects had been
hHd it was agreed that the walls of
fne Temple Emanu-El on Sutler street
near Ptockton were in splendid condi
tion and could be utilized for a new
Structure.
The trustees of the synagogue in
formed Duffey that the old walls would
h#» retained as a matter of sentiment.
From 560.000 to $100,000 will be expend
"d in th*» rehabilitation of the edifice.
The building will be of steel construc
tion.
The news that the old site will be
utilized for the synagogue will be of
Interest la view of the fact that a
site on. Van Ness avenue was pur
chased before the fire on which it waa
intended to build a new synagogue.
The Board of Works ordered notices
served on the owner of the old Han
cock buildliig, on Ellis street, near
I*ea»-«>nw©rth, to pull down the walls
ivithin twenty-four hours or the work
would be done by the board. The walls
of a building on the south side of Mc-
Allister street, near Hyde, were pulled
down by Duffey's men.
Commissioner Algeltlnger stated that
. t was time the Emporium walls were
pulled down and some action to that
end will soon be taken by the board.

CANNOT SUE HEIRS
FOR STOCK
If the own«*r of stocks in" a bank or
other corporation dies his heirs cannot
be made to pay obligations against the
stock, unless the change of ownership
is properly recorded on the books of
the corporation which has issued the
stock, according to the decision of the
Supreme Court, as given out yester
day.
The case in which this decision was
rendered was that of the People's Home
Savings Bank of San Francisco against
Anna Stadtmuller. F. D. Stadtmuller
bought 100 shares of the stock of the
bank, foj" which he was to pay $100
a share. Of this amount he paid at
the beginning one-third of tho price,
and was to pay the a.t any
time he should be called upon to do so.
When Stadtmuller- died. -Anna-Stadt
muller gained possession of, the stock
and in a little while the bank became
delinquent and demanded the money
still due it for the stock-
When payment of the money for the
stock was refused, the bank tried to
gain judgment against the new owner,
but the Superior Court decided against
the corporation, and the Supreme Court
sustained this decision on the grounds
already given. The Supreme Court held,
however, that the bank could have sold
the stock to satisfy the obligation, even
though the new owner is not rec
ognized on the books of the corpora
tion.

NEWS OF THE LABOR WORLD

The election of Carmen's Union was
one of the.~raost exciting ever held In
labor circles. Polls were open all day,
and closed at 11 p. ra.. Friends of the
various candidates were in evidence all
day long, extolling the good qualities
of those for vhom they, were election
eering. Good-natured rivalry was ex
hibited by several of the candidates.
William C. Lefflngwell for vice presi
dent nosed out over George W. Lane by
eight votes. The total votes, cast were
823, about half of" the membership. The
following candidates, with their votes,
were successful: President, Richard
Cornelius, 686 votes; vice president,
"William C. Lefflngwell, 336;'secretary
treasurer. James 11. Bowling, 440; dele

Lane 3.43, E. J. Hart 299. W. J: David
son 293 and J. McDonald 251. While
many of the defeated candidates are
good and true men, it waa probably
wis^ at this juncture to return. the old
officers. There may be. stormy, times
ahead for the organization, and all the
m«n who were returned have many
times been tried and never found want

Retail Shoe Clerks' Union No. 410
held a large and enthusiastic meeting
last Monday night in its hcadquartetf.
1422 Stelner street. Five candidates
were initiated and eight applications
are now 'on the table. The report of
the committee which' Visited the shoe
stores in the Mission was very encour
aging. Many proprietors expressed a
willingness to close at 6 p. m. after
the first of the year. The union has
ordered printed 50,000 cards, which the

That part of President Roosevelt's
message to Congress dealing with
the » Japanese \u25a0 subject was gen
erally commented upon in la
bor circles yesterday. While -the
sentiments expressed "wer<s roundly con
demned so far as. the naturalization of
the Mongolians." are" concerned, it" is
thought that in no other way could the
people of the country be aroused to the
•Inormlty of Oriental immigration, and
as that is what Californlans generally
want, the message so far as the natur
alization of Asiatics is concerned, it is
claimed, will be a blessing in disguise. .
: The law and legislative committee of
the Labor Council will meet this even
ing to discuss the proposed sanitary
Inspection factory act which will be
presented to the incoming Legislature.
Whether changes are made in the pres
ent factory laws or a new one formu
lated it is believed that mora liberal
appropriations will be insisted on by
labor's representatives In order that
more adequate inspection and regula
tion of factories and workshops may
be had.
There seems to have been ~ a mistake
to say that the Labor Council \u0084 has
levied a boycott upon the firm of Mc-
Mahon, Keyer, Stiegeler Bros., j tailors.
The council has declared its intention
to levy the boycott. This was done a
week or so ago, and the matter of a
boycott is still held In abeyance. Sec
retary^ McCabe of the council confirms
the above statement of facts.
The first case against the employers'
liability act, the only 'legislation of
the last Congress of % any benefit to

Memphis, Term. . The law. departments

There will soon be much discord In
union musical circles in New York
City. It is announced by delegates of
the Actors' Protective Union that as
the. Musicians' Mutual Protective. Union
and the Theatrical Protective Union
would not order their members to
strike in the Metropolitan Opera-house
to force the re-employment of the old
chorus, their organization would order
strikes In seventeen theatecs and
amusement places, which it is said it
controls, against the Musicians' Union
and the Theatrical Protective Union.
It was also decided that the engineers
and others employed in the, theaters
should strike, and that, until the two
unions obeyed the order to^call strikes
none of the affiliated unions in the
central body would employ members of
the Musicians* Union at balls;or enter
tainments. *V

.The grievance "committee of the
American Federation of Labor has evi
dently laid the law down to the New
York City Central Federated Union.
The New York body has for the p^st
year or so been a law unto itself, and
the time has arrived when such con
duct must bo. curbed. The charter has
been ordered revoked on January 1 if
the organization does not live up to
the laws of the parent body. Because
it was supposed by the New Yorkers
that there was no backbone? to speak
of In the American Federation of La
bor its laws have been defied. Several
local unions which were regularly af
filiated with the International organ
ization have been denied seats In the
Central Federated Union and seceding
and independent unions have " been
seated. These things must stop or the
charter will be revoked and the execu
tive council of the American Federation
of Labor will organize another central
body in New York which will obey the
laws. The labor unions composing the
New York Central Federated Union are
a great power, but there is an organ
ization which is supreme in the labor
world in this country,, arid that body
is the American Federation of ; LaT>or.
It-would, be well for t he, : ( N£w Yorkers
to get off their "high horse~ahd become

cised. \u25a0

and much speech-making indulged in.
