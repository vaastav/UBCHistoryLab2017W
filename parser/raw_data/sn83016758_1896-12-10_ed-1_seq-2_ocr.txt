Washington, Dec. 7 The Message to the

sentatives of the people in the legislative
branch of their government, you have as
sembled at a time when the strength and
excellence of om free institutions and the
fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule
have been again made manifest. A polit
ical contest involving momentous conse
quences, fraught with feverish apprehen
sion, and creating aggressiveness so in
tense as to appioach bitterness has been
waged throughout our land and determined
by the decree of fiee and independent
suffrage, without dlstuibance of our tran
quility of the least sign of weakness in
our national structme.
When we consider these incidents and con
template the peaceful obedience and manly
submission which have succeeded a heated
clash of political opinions, we discover
abundant evidence of a determination on
the pait of our countrymen to abide by
evveiy verdict of the popular will, and to
be controlled at all times by an abiding
faith in the agencies established for the
direction of the affairs of their government
Thus our people exhibit a patiiotic disposi
tion which entitles them to demand of
those who undertake to make and execute
theh laws such faithful and unselfish serv
ice in their behalf as can only be i rompted

confidence wbicn the acceptance of public

Important matters not effecting our relations
with fore'gn powers, it would afford me
satisfaction if I could assure the congrebs
that the disturbed condition in Asiatic
Tmkey had during the past year assumed
less hideous and bloody aspect, and that
either as a consequence of the awakening
of the Turkish government to the demand
of humane ci\ ihzation, or as the lesnlt of
decisive action on the pait of the gieat
nations havincr the right bv tieatj to inter
fere for the protection of those exposed to
the lage of mad bigotiy and ciuel fanati
cism, the shocking featiues of the situation
had been niitiaratod Instead, howevei, of
welcoming a softened disposition or pro
tective inteivention, we ha.e been af
flicted by continued and not infrequent re
ports of the wanton destruction of homes
and the bloodv butchery of men, women
and children, made martyrs to their pro
fession of Christian faith
Several naval vessels are stationed in the
Mediterranean as a measure of caution and
to furnish all*possible lelief and lefuge in
case of emergency We have made elaims
against the Tuikish government for the
pillage and destruction of missionary prop
erty at Harpoot and Marash during up
lisings at those places Thus far the valid
ity of these demands has not been ad
mitted, though our minister, prior to such
rages and in anticipation of danger, de
manded protection for the persons and
property of our missionary citizens .Jn the
localities mentioned, and notwithstanding
that strong evidence exists of actual com
pllcity of Turkish troops in the work of
destruction and robbeiy. The facts as they
now appear do not permit to doubt the
justice of these claims and nothing will be
omitted to biing about their prompt set
tlement.
I do not believe that the present sombre
prospect in Turkey will be long peimitted
to offend the sight of Christendom. It so

Should Spain Unable to Conquer,
America Tin) Act
The Insunection in Cuba still continues,
with all its peiplexitles It is difficult to
perceive that any pi ogress has thus far
been made toward the pacification of the
island or that the situat'on of affairs as de
picted in my last annual message Is in the
least Improved If Spain still holds Hav
ana and the seaports, and a'l the considera
ble towns, the insui gents still roam at will
over two-thirds of the inland country, if
the determ'nation of Spain to put Iow
the insurrection seems but to strengthen
with the lapse of time, and is evinced by
her unhesitating devotion of largely-in
creased military and naval forces to the
task, there Is much reason to believe that"
the insurgents have gained in point of
numbers, character and resources, and are
none the less inflexible in their resolve not
to succumb without practically securing the
great objects for which they took up arms
If Spain has not yet re-established her au
thority, neither have the insuigents yet
made good their title to be regarded as an
independent state. Indeed, as the contest
goes on, the pretense that civil government
exists on the island, except so far as Spain
is able to maintain it, has been practically
abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a
government, morevoi less imperfectly, but,
that exception being made, the entire coun
tiy Is either given over to anarchy or Is
subject to the military occupation of one or
the other party
It is reported, indeed, on reliably author
ity, that, at the demand of the commander
in-chief of the insurgent army, the putative
Cuban government has now gien up all at
tempt to exercise Its functions, leaving the
government confessedly (what there is the
best reason for supposing it always to have
beea In fact) a government merely on pa
per. Were the Spanish armies able to meet
their antagonists In the open or In pitched
battle, prompt and decisive results might
be looked for, and the immense superiority
of the Spanish forces in numbers, disci
pline and equipment could hardly fail to tell
greatly to their advantage. But they are
called upon to face a foe that shuns general
engagements, and that ean choose, and does
choose, its own ground, that, from the
nature of the country Is visible or Invisible
at pleasure, and that fights only from am
buscade and when all the advantages of po
sition and numbers are on its side. In a
country where all that is Indispenslble to
life In the way of fo'od, clothing and shel
ter is so easily obtainable, especially by
those born and bred on tne soil, It is obvi
ous that therp Is hardly a limit to the time
during which hostilities of this sort may be
prolonged. Meanwhile, as in all cases of
protracted civil strife, the passions of the
combatants grow more and more Inflamed,
and excess on both sides becomes more fre
quent and deplorable. They are also par
ticipated ia bf bands of marauders,' who
occasion, harry the country at will and insurrection
plunder Its wretched Inhabitants for their
own advantage. Such a condition of things
would lnevj*ably entail immense destruction,
of property, even if it were the policy of
both parties to prevent It as far as prac
ticable. But, while sueh seems to be the
original policy of the Spanish government.
It has now, apparently, abandoned it, and
is acting upoJ^ej5fl.TOe theory as the in
surgents, namely, that the exigencies of
the contest require the wholesale annihila
tion of property, that it may not prove of
use and advantage to the enemy.
It to the same end, and in pursuance
of general orders, that Spanish garrisons
are now being withdrawn .from planta
tions and the raial population required to
concentrate itself in the towns. The sure
result would seen to be that the industrial
value of the island is fast diminishing, and
that, unless there .s a speedy and radical
change in existing conditions, It will soon
disappear altogether. That value consists
very largely,e oifn coarse, In Its capacity
produce sugar, a capacity already much re
ut
terr Ption to the
th
tillagteo
which have taken place during the last two
years. It is reliably asserted that, should
these interruptions continue during the
current year, and practically extend, as is
now threatened, to the entire sugar-produc
ing territory of the Island, so much time
and so much money will be required to re
store the island to its normal productive
ness, that it is extremely doubtful if capi
tal can be induced to even make the at
tempt. The spectacle of the utter ruin of
an adjoining country, by nature one of the
most fertile and charming on the globe,
would engage the senous attention of "the
government and the people of the United
states under any circumstances. In point
of fact, they have a concern with it which
is by no means of a wholly sentimental or
philanthropic character It lies so near to
us as to be haidly separated from our ter
iltory Our actual pecunlaiy interest in it
is only second to that of the people and
government of Spain It is leasonably esti
mated that at least from $30,000,000 to
50,000,000 of American capital are Invested
in plantations, and in railroad, mining and
other business enteiprises In the island
The volume of trade between the United
States and Cuba, which in 1SS9 amounted
to about ?80,000,000, lose in 1893 to about
$103,000,000, and in 1894, the year before
the present insurrection broke out, amount
ed to nearly $96,000,000 Besides this large
pecuniaiy stake in the fortunes of Cuba,
the United States finds itself
Inextricably Involved
in the piesent contest in othei ways both
^exatious and costly. Manj Cubans leside
ia this country, and indiiectlv promote the
insuriection throughout the press, by pub
lie meetings, by the purchase and shipment
of arms, by the raising of funds, and bv
other means, which the spiiit of our in
stitutions and the tenoi of our laws do not
permit to be made the subject of criminal
piosecution Some of them, though Cubans
at heait and in all their feelings and intei
ests, have taken out pipers of naturalised
citizens of the United States, a proceeding
lesorted to with a Mew to possible protec
tion by this government, and not unnatur
ally legaided with much indignation by tVe
country of their origin. The insuigents die
undoubtedly encouiaged and supported Iv
the widespiead sympathy the people of this
country always and instinctively felt foi
every stiaggie for better and fieer govern
ment, and which in the case of the more
adventurous and restless elements of our
population leads in only too many instances
to active participation In the contest. The
lesult Is that this government is constantly
called upon to piotect Ameiican citizens,
to claim damages for injuiies to persons
and property now estimated at many mil
lions of dollais, and to ask e\plamtions
and apologies for the acts of Sr.anish of
ficials whoe zeal for the lepression of the
rebellion sometimes blinds them to the im
munities belonging to the unoffenJing cit
izens of a friendly power It follows from
the same causes that the Uhited States is
compelled to actively police a long line of
sea cast against unlawful expeditions, the
escape of which the utmost vlgi'anee will
not alwavs suffice to prevent
These Invariable entanglements of the
United States with the rebellion In Cuba,
the laige American property interests af
fected, and considerations of phllanthrophy
and humanity in general, have led to a
vehement demand in vaiious quarters, for
some soit of positive intervention on the
part of the United States It was at first
proposed that belligerent rights should be
accorded to the Insuigentsa proposition
no longer urged because untimely and in
practical operation cleatly perilous and In
jurious to our own Interest It has since
been and is now sometimes contended that
the Independence of the insurgents should
be recognized But imperfect and restilcted
as the Spanish government of the island
may be, no other exist thereunless the will
of the military officer in temnoiary com
mand of a particular dlstnct. can be dig
uified as a species of government It is now
also suggested that the United States should
buy the islanda suggestion possibly woithy
of consideration if there weie any evidence
of a desire 01 wi'bngness on the pait of
Spain to entertain such a proposal ,It is
urged, finally, that, all other methods' fail
ing,
+hc existing inteinectine strife in Cuba
should be terminated by our intervention,
even at the cost of a war between tho
United States and Spaina war which its
advocates confidently prophesy could be
neither large in its proportions nor doubtful
in its 'asue
The correctness of this forecast need be
neither affinmed nor denied The United
States has nevertheless a character to main
tain as a nation, which plainly dictates
that right and not anight should be the
rule of Its conduct
Furthei, though the United States is not
a nation to which peace Is a necessity, it
is in truth the most pacific of powers, and
desires nothing so much as to live in amity

No other great nower, it may safely be
said, under circumstances of similear per

It may also be said that this persistent
attitude of the United States towards
Spain in connection with Cuba unquestion
ably evinces no slight respect and regard
for Spain on the part of the American peo
ple. They, in truth, do not forget her
connection with the discovery of the West
ern hemisphere, nor do they under esti
mate the great qualities of the Spanish peo
ple, nor fall to fully recognize their splendid
patriotism and their chivalrous devotion
to the national honor.

government of Spain some months ago that,
if a satisfactory measure of home rule were
tendeied the Cuban insurgents, and would
be accepted by them upon a guaianty of its
execution, the United States would endeavor-
/o find a way not objectionable to Spain ot
furnishing such guaianty
While no definite response to this intima

should not be approved by the insurgents. i

^VENEZUELA BOUNDARY

The Trouble Is Regarded a a Practlc-^'
ally Settled.
The Venezuelan boundary question has
ceased to be a matter of difference between
Great Britain and the United States, their
respective governments having agreed upon
the substantial provisions of a treaty be
tween Great Britain and Venezuela, sub
mitting the whole controversy to arbitra
tion. The provisions of the treaty are so
eminently fair and just that the assent or
Venezuela thereto may confidently be an
"tieipated. Negotiations for ai treaty of gen
eral arbitration for all differences between
Great Britain and the United States are so
far advanced and promise to reach a sue-1
cessfu} confirmation at an early date.
We have during the last year labored]
faithful y and against unfavorable condi

life in the Bering sea. Both the Unitedj
