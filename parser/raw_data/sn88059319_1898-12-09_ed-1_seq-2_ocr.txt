text of President McKinley's annual mes

of the Fifty-first congress:

creased the treasury's receipts to the
amount estimated by its authors, the

has been maintained at the world's highest
standard. Military service under a com
mon flag and for a righteous cause has
strengthened the national spirit and served
to cement more closely than ever the fra
ternal bonds between every section of the
country. A review of the relation of the
United States to other powers, always ap
propriate, is this year of primary impor
tance in view of the momentous issues
which have arisen, demanding in one in
stance the ultimate determination by arms
and involving far-reaching consequences
.which will require the earnest attention
of the congress.
SPAIN AND CUBA.
A Resume of tlte Conditions Which
Led Up to the War.
In my last annual message very full con
sideration was given to the question of
the duty of the government of the United
States toward Spain and the Cuban in
surrection as being by far the most im
portant problem with which we were then
called upon to deal. The considerations
then advanced, and the exposition of the
views therein expressed, disclosed my
sense of the extreme gravity of the situ
ation. Setting aside, as logically un
founded or practically inadmissible, the
recognition of the independence of Cuba,
neutral Intervention to end the war by im
posing a rational compromise between the
contestants, intervention in favor of one
or the other party, and forcible annexation
of the Island, I concluded it was honestly
due to our friendly relations with Spain
that she should be given a reasonable

be efficacious to remedy the evils so deep,
ly affecting our own country, so injurious
to the true interests of the mother country
as well as to those of Cuba, and so repug
nant to the universal sentiment of hu
manity.
The ensuing month brought little sign of
real progress toward the pacification of
Cuba. Tne autonomous administration set
up In the capital and some of the prin
cipal cities appeared not to gain the favor
of the Inhabitants nor to be able to extend,
their influence to the large extent of ter
ritory held by the Insurgents while the
military arm, obviously unable to cope
with the still active rebellion, continued
many of the most objectionable and offen
sive policies of the government that had
preceded it. No tangible relief was af

concentrados despite the relterateq pro
fessions made in that regard and the
amount appropriated by Spain to that
end. The proffered expedient of zones of
cultivation proved lllusoffr Indeed, no less
praotical nor more delusive promises of
succor could well have been tendered to the

athetlo strangers hardly less necessitous

By the end of December the mortality
among them had frightfully Increased.
Conservative estimates from Spanish
sources placed the deaths among theBe dis
tressed people at over 40 per cent, from the
time Gen. weyler's decree of reconcentra
tlon was enforced. With the acquiescence
of the Spanish authorities a scheme was
adopted for relief by charitable contribu
tions raised in this country and distrib
uted under the direction of the consul-gen
eral and several consuls by noble and ear
nest individual effort through the organ
ized agencies of the American Red Cross.
Thousands of lives were thus saved, but
many thousands more were inaccessible to
such forms of aid.
The war continued on the old footing
without comprehensive plan, developing
only the same spasmodic encounters, bar
ren of strategic result, that had marked the
course of the earlier ten years' rebellion as
well as the present insurrection from its
start. No alternative save physical ex
haustion of either combatant and there
withal the practical ruin of the Island lay
in sight, but how far distant no one could
venture to conjecture.

poise and sturdy good sense distinguishing
our national character that this shocking
blow, falling upon a generous people, al

in Cuba, aid not move them to an Instant,

to fix the responsibility of its authorship.

Action of Congress.
All these things carried conviction to the
most thoughtful, even before the finding
of the naval court, that a crisis in our re
lations with Spain toward Cuba was at
hand. So strong was this belief that It
needed but a brief executive sugges
tion to the congress to receive Imme
diate answer to the duty of making instant
provision for the possible and perhaps
speedily probable emergency of war, and the
remarkaole. almost unique, spectacle was
presented of a unanimous vote of botr.
houses on the 9th of March, appropriating
$50,000,000
"for the national defenses and for
each and every purpose connected there
with. to be expended at the discretion of
the president." That this act of provision
came none too soon was disclosed when the
pplication of the fund was undertaken.
Jur forts were practically undefended. Our
navy needed largu provision for Increased
ammunition and supplies, and even num
bers to cope with any sudden attack from
the navy of Spain, which comprised mod
ern vessels or the higliost type of conti
nental perfection. Our army also required
enlargement of men and munitions. The
details of the hurried preparation for the
dreaded contingency is told In the reports
of the secretaries of war and of the navy,
and need not be repeated here. It la sum
clent to say that the outbreak of the
war, when It did come, found our nation not
unprepared to meet the conflict.

Nor was the apprehension of coming
strife confined to our own country. It was
felt by the continental powers which, On
April 6. through their ambassadors and
envoys, addressed to the executive an ex
pression of hope that humanity and mod
eration might mark the course of this gov
ernment and people, and that further nego
tiations would lead to an agreement which,
while securing the maintenance of peace,
would affirm all necessary guarantees for
the reestabllshment of order in Cuba. In
responding to- that representation, I also
sharod the hope that the envoys had ex
pressed that peace might be preserved In
a manner to terminate the chronic conol
tlon of disturbance in Cuba so Injurious
and menacing to our Interests ana tran
quillty, as well as shocking to our senti
ments of humanity and, while appreciat
ing the humanitarian" and disinterested
character of the communication they had
made on behalf of the powers, I stated the
confidence of this government, for its part,
that equal appreciation would be shown for
its own earnest and unselfish endeavors to
fulfill a duty to humanity by ending a sit
uation, the indefinite prolongation of which
had become Insufferable.
Efforts Continued.
Still animated by the hope of a peaceful
solution and obeying the dictates of duty,
no effort was relaxed to bring about a
speedy ending of the Cuba nstruggle. Ne
gotiations to this obpect continued actively
with the government of Spain, looking to
the immediate conclusion of a six months'
armistice In Cuba with a view to effect the
recognition of her people's right to lnde-

that the sufferers, returning to
tholAiomes and aided by united American
and 'Spanish effort might be put in a way
to support themselves and, by orderly re
sumption of the well-nigh destroyed pro
ductive enorgles of the Island, contribute
to the restoration of its tranquility and
well-being.
Negotiations continued for some little
time at Madrid, resulting In offers by the
Spanish government which could not but
be regarded as Inadequate. It was pro
posed to confide the preparation of peace
to the Insular parliament, yet to be con
vened under the autonomous decrees of
November, 1897, but without Impairment In
any wise of the constitutional powers ot
the Madrid government, which, to that
end, would grant an armistice, If solicited
by the Insurgents, for such time as the
general in chief might see fit to fix. How
and with what scope of discretionary
powers the insular parliament was ex
pected to set about the "preparation" of
peace did not appear. If it were to be by
negotiation with the insurgents, the issue
seemed to rest on the one side with a body
chosen by a fraction of the electors In the
districts under Spanish control, and on
the other with the insurgent population
holding the interior country, unrepresented
so-called parliament, and defiant

CONGRESS ASKED TO ACT.
Whole Question Submitted to Legis
lators on April 11.
Grieved and disappointed at this barren
outcome of my sincere endeavors to reach
a practical solution, I felt It my duty to re
mit the whole question to the congress.
In the message of April 11,1808,1 announced
that with this last overture In the direc
tion of immediate peace in Cuba, and its
disappointing reception by Spain, the ef
fort of the executive was brought to an
end. I again reviewed the alternative
course of action which I had proposed,
concluding that the only one consonant
with international policy and compatible
with our firm-set historical traditions was
intervention as a neutral to stop the war
and check the hopeless sacrifice of life,
even though that resort Involved "hostile
constraint upon both the parties to the
contest, as well to enforce a truce as to
guide the eventual settlement." ,.r
The grounds justifying that —rT."
The interests of .*-rar.x.i,.ty the duty to
protect life &b2 property of our citizens in
Cuba the right to check Injury to our com

of the island, and, most Important, the need
of removing at once and forever the con
stant menace and the burdens entailed
upon our government by the uncertainties
and perils of the situation caused by the
unendurable disturbance In Cuba. I said:
"The long trial has proved that the ob
ject for which Spain has waged the war
cannot be attained. The fire of insurrec
tion may flame or may smolder with vary
ing seasons, but it has not been, and it Is
plain that it cannot be, extinguished by
present methods. The only hope of relief
and repose from a condition which can no
longer be endured is the enforced pacifi
cation of Cuba. In the name of humanity,
in the name of civilization. In behalf of en
dangered American Interests which give
us the right and the duty to speak ana to
actual war in Cuba, must stop."
In view of all this, the congress was
asked to authorize and empower the pres
ident to take measures to secure a full and
final termination of hostilities between Spain

Walking the Floor.
When a business man gets to the point
where he cannot sleep at night, where he is
so shattered of nerve that it is torture to
even remain in his bed, and he has to get
up and pace the floor—it is time for that
man to bring himself up with around turn.
If he does not, it means nervous prostration
and mental, if not physical, death.
For a man who gets into this condition
there is a remedy that will brace him up,
put him on his feet and make a man of him
again'. It is Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery. It goes to the bottom of things.
It searches out the first cause. When a
man is in this condition you can put your
finger on one of two spots and hit that first
cause—the stomach or the liver or both.
This great medicine acts directly oa these
spots. It promptly transforms a weak stom
ach into a healthy one. It facilitates the
flow of digestive juices and makes diges?
tion and assimilation perfect It gives a
man an appetite like a boy's. It invigor
ates the liver. It fills the blood with the
life-giving elements of the food, and makes
it pure, rich, red and plentiful. The blood
is the life current, and when it is filled with
the elements that build new and healthy
tissues, it does not take long to make a man
well and strong. It builds firm, muscular
flesh tissues and strong and steady nerte
fibers. It puts new life, vigor and vitality
into every atom and or^an of the body,
cures nervous exhaustion and prostration.
Nothing "just as good" can be found at
medicine stores. .. ...

lief to the starving people of Cuba.
Action ot Congress Approved.
The response of the congress, after nine
days' ot earnest deliberation, during whloh
the almost unanimous sentiment of your
body was developed on every point save
as to the expediency of coupling the pro
posed action with a formal recognition of
the republic of Cuba as the true and lawful
government of that island—a proposition
which failed of adoption—the congress,
after conference, on the 19th of April, by
a vote of 42 to 8o in the senate and 811 to
in the house of representatives, passed the
memorable joint resolution, declaring:
"First. That the people of the island of
Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free
and Independent.
"Second. That it is the duty of the United
States to demand and the government of
the United States does hereby demand, the
government of Spain at once relinquish its
authority and government in the island of
Cuba and withdraw its land and naval
forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
"Third. That the president of the United
States be, and he hereby is. directed and
empowered to use the entire land and naval
forces of the United States, and to call into
the actual service of the United States
the mllltla of the several states, to suoh
extent as may be necessary to carry these
resolutions Into effect.
"Fourth. That the United States hereby
disclaims any disposition or Intention to
exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control
over said island except for the pacification
thereof, and asserts its determination when
that is accomplished to leave the govern
ment and control ot the island to Its peo- I
pie."
Diplomatic Relations Ended.
This resolution was approved by the ex
eoutive on the next day, April 20. A copy
was at once communicated to the Spanish
minister at this capital, who forthwith an
nounced that his continuance in Washing
ton had thereby become Impossible, and
asked for his passports, which were given
him. He thereupon withdrew from
Washington, leaving the protection of
Spanish interests in the United States to
the French ambassador and the Austro
H*jngarlan minister. Simultaneously with
its communication to the Spanish minister
Gen. Woodford, the American minister at
Madrid, was telegraphed confirmation of
the text of the Joint resolution and directed
to communicate it to the government of
Spain with the formal demand that It at
once relinquish its authority ana govern
ment In the island of Cuba and withdraw
its forces therefrom, coupling this demand
with announcements of the intentions of
this government as to the future or the is
land. In conformity with the fourth clause
of the resolution, and giving Spain untu

Spain having thus denied the demand of
the United States and initiated that com
plete form of rupture of relations which
attends a state of war, the executive pow
ers authorized by the resolution were at
once used by me to meet the enlarged con
tingency of actual war between Spain and
the United States. On April 22 1 pro
claimed a blockade of the northern coast ot
Cuba, including ports on said coast be
tween Cardenas and Bahla Honda and the
port of Clenfucgos on the south coast of
Cuba and on the 23d I called for volun
teers to execute the purpose of the resolu
tion. By my message of April 25, the con
gress was informed of the situation and I
recommended formal declaration of the
existence of a state of war between the
United States and Spain. The oongress
accordingly voted on the same day the
act approved April 25, 1898, declaring the
existence of such war, from and Including
the "21st day of April, and reenacted the
provision of the resolution of April 20, di
recting the president to use all the armed
forces of the nation to carry that act into
effect. Due notification, of the existence of
war as aforesaid was given April 25 by
telegraph to all the governments with
which the United States maintain relations,
in order that their neutrality might be as
sured during the war. The various gov
ernments responded with proclamations of
neutrality, each after Its own methods.

Strengrth of the Navy.
The maximum effective fighting force of
the navy during the wai% separated into
classes, was as follows: Four battleships
ot the first class, one battleship of the sec
ond class, two armored cruisers, six coast
defense monitors, one armored ram, It

IB revenue cutters, four lighthouse

Defense ot the Coast.
Much alarm was felt along our entire
Atlantic seaboard lest some attack might
be made by the enemy. Every precaution
was taken to prevent possible Injury to
our great cities lying along the coast.
Temporary garrisons were provided, drawn
from the state militia infantry and light
batteries were drawn from the volunteer
force. About 12,000 troops were thus em
ployed. The coast signal service was es
tablished for observing the approach of an
enemy's ships to the coast or the United
States and the Ute-savlng and lighthouse
services cooperated, which enabled the
navy department to nave all portions of the
Atlantic coast, from Maine to Texas, under
observation. The auxiliary navy was cre
ated under the authority of congress, and
was officered and manned by the nav$il
mllltla of the several states. This organ?
izatlon patrolled the coast, and performed
the duty ot'a second arm of defense.
Planting of Mines.
Under the direction of the chief of engi
neers 'submarine mines were placed a.t the
most exposed points. Before the outbreak
of the war permanent mining casemates
and cable galleries had been constructed
at all important harbors. Most of the tor-
glarket
edo material was not to be found In the
and had to be specially manufac
tured. Under date of April 19 district offl
oers were directed to take all preliminary
measures, short of the actual attaching of
the loaded mines to the cables, and on
April 22 telegraphic orders were issued to
place the loaded mines in position. The
aggregate number of mines placed was
1,535 at the principal harbors from Maine
to California. Preparations were also made
for the planting of mines at certain other
harbors, but owing to the early destruction
of the Spanish fleet these mines were not
placed.
The Slgrnal Corps.
The signal corps was promptly organized
and performed service of most difficult and
Important character. Its operations dur
ing the war covered the electrical connec
tion of all coast fortifications, the estab
lishment of telephonic and telegraphic facil
ities for the camps at Manila, Santiago
and in Porto Rico. There were constructed

War Revenues
The national defense under the SSO.OOO.OOO
fund was expended In large part oy tne
army and navy and the objects for whloh
it was used are fully shown in the reports
of tne several secretaries. It was a most
timely appropriation, enabling the govern
ment to strengthen Its defense and making
preparations greatly needed tn case of War.
This fund being Inadequate to the require
ments of equipment and for the conduct of
the war, the patriotism of the congress pro
vided the means In the war revenue act of
June 18, by authorizing a three per cent,
popular loan not to exceed 400,000,000 and
oy levying additional Imposts and taxes.
Of the authorized loan, $200,000,000 were of
fered and promptly taken, the subscrip
tions so far exceeding the call as to cover
It many times over, while, preference be
ing given to the smaller bids, no single allot
ment exceeded $6,000. This was a most en
couraging and significant result, snowing
the vast resources of the nation and the
determination of the poople to uphold their
country's honor.
BRIEF HISTORY OF THE WAR.
Leading Engagements
Hnd
Thrilling:
Achievements Recounted.
It is not within the province of this mes
sage to narrate the history of thf ex
traordinary war that followed the Spanish
declaration ot April 21, but a brief recital
•f its more salient features is appropriate.
Tbe first encounter of the war in point of
date took place April 27, when a detach
ment of the blockading squadron made a
reconnolssance in force at Matanzas,
shelled the harbor forts and demolished
several new works In construction.
Dewey's Victory.
The next engagement was destined to
mark a memorable epoch In maritime war
fare. The Pacific fleet, under Commodore
George Dewey, had lain for some weeks at
Hong-Kong. Upon the coloclal proclama
tion of neutrality being issued and the
customary 24 hours' notice being given, it
repaired to Mlrs bay, near Hong-Kong,
whence it proceeded to the Philippine is
lands under telegraphic orders to capture
or destroy the formidable Spanish fleet then
assembled at Manila. At daybreak on the
1st of May the American force entered Ma
nila bay and after a few hours' engage
ment effected the total destruction of the
Spanish fleet, consisting of ten warships
and a transport besides capturing tne
kuu ucaiuco tuuvui tug iuv

My heart is filled with sincere gratitude for
thecomplete restoration of my hearing, which
had suddenly failed durl ng a very heavy cold,
au} for over a year I was almost totally deaf.
I would raise from my throat little hard lumps
that looked like cbalk. I had a fullness,
stopped-up feeling and frequent bloody dis
charges firom the nostrils. Phlegm dropped
into my throat a great deal and the slightest
cold would oause intense headaches. I could
not hear publio speaking, and in conversation
my friends were obliged to talk very loud.
It was in August, 18971
used Aerial Medication.
It restored my hearing completely, stopped
the terrible noises in' my head,
and cured mo
of catarrh and throat affection, from which I
had been a great sufiferer since 1890. In on*
month I could hear as well as ever I could,
andat the end of three months I had recovered
completely from the disease that had afflicted
me in its worBt form. My health
and hearing
have been perfect ever since, and I earnestly
desire that others may benefit by my expert,
ence with this
wonderful treatment. Mrs. Mln
