Tm people of Tuscumbia, Alabama, !
appealed to President Grant for relief
for the citizens who were rendered
destitute by the recent terrible disaster,
which he graciously declined to grant
Had an appeal been made for arms to
maintain in power the carpet-bag
plunderers it would hare met with a
speedr and farorable response.
A Speck of War.
The colored troops continue to fight
nobly. Dispatches from Vicksburgh,
Miss., dated the 7th, report that seven
hundred armed negroes attacked that
eity that morning early, advancing
upon it from six different roads. They
were repulsed wish a loss of twenty
fire killed and wounded and forty
prisoners. The whites lost one killed
and two wounded.
The attack was made to
Crosby (colored) as shiriff,
reinstate '
who bad !
been pot ont for want of bond. At
last accounts all was quiet in the city,
bat the negroes are reported as burn
ing houses in the country. ' Let us
have peace."
Thk leading journal of Texas, the
Galveston Newt, takes this view of
the political situation :
It does not follow, because the states
manship of the Republican party
proved fatally defective in many par
ticulars, and has finally worn ut the
patience of the people, that while that
statesmanship predominated in the
public affairs no event happened
which was to have been desired, and
seed was not sown from which pre
cious harvests may not iu good time
be reaped. In the trials and vicissi
tudes of these fourteen years past, les
sons hare been learned which no other
school could have taught. North and
South, pride of section, pride of clan,
of class and caste, hare been chasten
ed. Conflict and friction hare purged
away besetting faults, hare purified
and widened perceptions, so that men.
in both sections hare come to under
stand each other better, hare come to
realize that their liberties have been
exposed to a common danger, and
have eome to feel that, to save those
liberties, and secure their material
prosperity, they must desist from al
ienation, discension, mutual distrust,
proyocation and harassment.
A Stupid Story Spoiled.
The Radicals have been thrown into
a terrible state of alarm by a story set
afloat by the New York Republic, an
oagan of the Administration, alleging
that southern capitalists are engaged
in buying up claims for slaves lost by
reason of Lincoln's emancipation pro
clamation and paying as high as $100
each for such claims. Of course all
these stories are the most atupid non
sense, bnt the Radical leaders vainly
imagine they can use them to raise a
scare among the people which will
enable them to retain political power
to be used hi plundering the country.
Among those who, it is alleged, is en
gaged in this great speculation of pur
chasing claims is ex-Senator Yulee, of
P'orida. How much truth there is
in the silly story may be learned from
the following dispatch from Savanna,
Ga., dated November 29th :
Ex-aenetor Yulee, of Florida, writes
here saying : The statement now going
she rounds of the press, to the effect
that he is engaged in buying up slave
claims in hopes that Cougress will ul
timately pay for the emancipated ne
groes, is absolutely false. He says
the loss of slave property is one of the
irremediable losses of war, and the
idea of any possible reclamation is too
wild to be entertained by any sane
man.
Tbe Cinse of Defeat
Editor DejsBcratic Press :
"What has caused this great com
motion, the country through ?" asks
the Clereiand Herald, commenting on
the signal defeat the Republicans suf
fered iu the late elections. It answers,
and its answer is significant.
"We beliere it isnmainly due to the
course pursued bi the President and
those intimate friends of his who are
attempting the management of Re
publican parly affairs."
I answer, they have attempted the
management of the affairs of the Na
tion for toe past lew years, and sig
nally failed.
Pactfcation for a divided nation
"was pre-eminently needed. In this
the failure has been so palpable that I
have frequently thought that if the
Presidentand those -'intimate friends"
of his would but permanently locate
themselves at Long Branch, heeding
tbe injunction, "Hands ofl !" the Sooth
would have eliminated their Moses,
their Kellogg, and Packard, and most
of the brood of political cormorants
whieh have preyed so raven-like upon
their wasted substance.
Seldom, if ever, washerc presented
a better opportunity for the exercise
of that greatness of mind which we
express by the term magnanimity.
"Victory over our countrymen," said
the late Sumner, "shruld beknown on
ly by the rights it secures." Why so
marked a failure in this, as iu some
other matters, let the Herald speak.
It says : "11 teas a fearful thing lo
raiseTa man from the humble position
of a country dealer to that of Presi
dent of theUniled States.''
The Herald seems to take quite a
different view of Grant from what it
did in "72. Tbe Party were then in
the ascendant, now in the minority.
Ben. Butler was no less the henchman
of Gen. Grant then than now, yet the
Herald calls him the rhinoceros-hided
political infliction, tbe head-devil ot
the Salary-grab larceny." This sounds
as though they had confessed some of
their sins and had fastened them lo
the hords of a scape-goat, and were
hieing to the wilderness of political
forgetfulness.
Boiler, Grant, Garfield, the Trinity
in the Salary-grab larceny. Butler,
the bold, frank and avowed advocate
of the measure, look his pay, placed
it where it would do the most good.
Grant, "the great silent man," clutches action being taken by Cougress at that
his aud fays nothing. Garfield's con- j time, but subject to any sal? factory
nection with the measure is too well arrangements that might be made by
necuou wnu .... . . ! tlle parties to the controversy, and
known, as well as his attempt lo ex- whic, of al5 things, was1 most desira
culpata himself. The elections of Octo- j 0le. it would be his duty, so far as it
bar and November, if tho results are ; might be necessary for him to act, lo
to be construed not as a "huge joke" j adhere to the Government heretofore
w w . . . recognized by him. 'lhe President,
but as the verdict of an outraged peo-, iugnbni(8 thu qup t() c
pie, then these meh are rebuked. C

I begun. Seventy-one members au.-j
; swered to their names on tho first roll
j call, in the lower house, and about the
me proportion in the Senate. .Among

Governor Allen's message. This doc
ument is remarkable for its brevity,
its terseness of style, and perhaps
commendable for its non -reference to
national questions. It would have j
dealt more fully in matters pertaining:

State had the author received the re- j
ports from the several Boards in lime, j
The Governor very properly recom- !
mends the payment of that portion of j
the State debt falling due in 1876. He j
evidently sympathises with the meas- j
ure initiated by Mr. Holt, of Cuya- j
hoga, last winter, for the rebuilding j
! of the sleeping cells of the Peniten-j
tiary a measure too long delayed, al- i
though demanded by every impulse
and principle of humanity. These

three-fifths of their time in the aggre

President's Message.
The second session of the Forty
third Cougress, commenced at noon
on Monday, aud the Message of Presi
dent Grant was delivered on the same
xlay. The extreme length of the docu
ment and the lateness of the hour at
which it was received precludes the
possibility of our publishing it this
week. It is the want of funds and
not of enterprise that prevents us
from getting it printed abroad and
laying it before our readers at this
time in supplimented form.
The Message is quite leagthy and
no mere hastily prepared synopsis
will do the document justice. The
most important subjects discussed in
it are those relating to finance, the
larifi, civil service reform aud Arkan
sas affairs. Upon the subject of the
currency he declares most emphatical
ly in laver of a speedy resumption of
specie payment, aud argues the ques
tion at considerable length, but names
no day theretor, leaving Congress to
devise the means to secure this desired
end, it being the duty of Cougress lo
do so. The legal-teiuler clause of the
Currency Act should be repealed, to
take effect us to contracts made alter a
day to be fixed by law for its repeal,
tower should be given to the Secre
tary of the Treasury to obtain gold
irom and alter the date fixed for the
resumptiuyi of specie payments by the
issuance of bonds. Iu addition to
this, the reveuues of the Government
should be in excess o! the expenditures.
To support resumption, greater econ
omy should be practiced in all de
partments of the Government, and, if
necessary, the customs aud internal
revenue laws changed, in order to se
cured large amount ot revenue. With
the return of sppcie payments bank
ing should be tree. The bill-holders
should continue to be protected as at
present, under tbe banking law. There
should be no limitatiou to the volume
ot currency, as the community itself
slfould determine what amount is re
quired for business transactions, in
stead of leaving the Executive, the
Secretary of lhe Treasury and Con
gress to fix the limit. It would be the
duly of Congress, however, to make
regulations regarding Ire; banks of
issue, and to state the conditions on
which they cau be organized and
transact business, the legislation to be
in accordance with the new order ol
things, or in other words, the resump
tion of specie payment.;' There should
be no monopoly by fixing the amount
of i-sue. The .President recommends
that Congress do not interfere with
the . present currency act passed d: r
ing the last session, unless to amend it
so as to conform with a plan for the
resumption of specie payments.
Of the tariff he speaks briefly, sus
taining the facts and suggestions coar
tained in the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury. Ho advises fhlimi-
tat:on of lhe tariff to a few articles,
and suggests that the tariff on those
few he made sufficiently high to afford
the required revenue.
He alludes to civil service reform,
saying it has been as closely adhered
lo as the Opposition manitested against
it permitted. lis results have been
beneficial, having elevated the capaci
ty and tone of" appointments in the
several Departments of the Govern
ment, but it would be impossible to
continue the reform without the di
rect support of Congress, sanctioned
by the people.
The President devotes much space
to affairs in Arkansas, giving the rea
son why he declined lo interfere in
the n cent difficulties in that State, and
he adverts lo the facts narrated in his
special message to Congress in Febru
ary, 1873, relative to Louisiana, in
which he said he had no specific rec
ommendaliou to make on the subject ;
but if there were any practical way ot
removing these difficulties by legisla
tion, then he earnestly requested that
t he question might be taken up at that
session of Congress. Ho was extreme
ly ar.xiotn to avoid a pretense of un
due interference in State affairs, and
if Congress differed with him as to
what ought to be done, he requested
its immediate decision to that effect :
otherwise he should feet obliged, as
far as he could by the exercise of leg
itimate authority, and put an end to
the unhappy controversy which dis
turbed the peace and prostrated lhe
bu-iness of Louisiana by recognition
and support ot that Government which
was recognized and upheld by the
Cours ot the Slate. It seemed advis
able that he should slate which course
he should feci hound to pursue iu ref
erence th the m ilter in the event of no
gress, and will continue lo act as he
has heretofore acted relative to the af-
fairs of Louisiana, witless otherwise
controlled by Congress.
The President reiterates his confi
dence in the Indian peace policy. If
adhered to, be says, it will produce
additioual beneficial effects, and ulti
mately free the frontier of Indian de
predations. lie recommends that the pensions
which were cut off from the soldiers
of the war of 1812 by act of Congress
be restored to them, they being all eld
persons, who could have taken no part
in the rebellion, and the services for
which they were awarded pensions
were in defense of the whole country.
He alludes to the reports of the
heads of the several Departments
which accompany the message, and
calls attention to their respective rec
ommendations, lie again recommends
the passage of a law establishing a
Court for the adjudication of claims
of aliens against the Government, a
bill for this purpose having been in
troduced by Judge Lawrence at the
previous sessions of Congress.
There are several other matters
treated on in the message which we
have not time or space here to notice.
Illinois Correspondence.
Winchester, Nor, 26th. 1874.
TO Tax K9ITOB OF TBI DzMOCZATIC PMSS :
Enclosed find two dollars in pay
ment for a copy of the Press for my j
good old mother, who resides iu For-
tage county. The Pncss is receired
here regularly and eagerly sought after
in our household. When once taken
jip by any member of the family it is
not laid aside until perused thorough
ly, especially the local columns, adver
tisements and all.
To-day is Thanksgiving-Day. Our
turkey was led to the block and sacri
ficed on the altar of Than ksgi vine. It
was eue of our own raising, and never
paid the profits ot the middle man. It
bad eaten a bushel ot meal, costiug 80
cents, one bushel of shelled corn, cost
ing 50 cents, besides crumbs aud wast
age from our table. Turkeys eau be
bought in the market here from the
middle-men for half a dollar ahead.
We now begin-to believe that tbe mid
dle man is an indispensable being, of-,
tea courenient when we have auything
to sell, or when we want to buy.
Winchester is the county-seat of
Scott county, or "Little Scott" as it is
familiarly called, from the fact that
it is oue of the smallest counties in the
state. The town contains about two
thousand inhabitants, aad the county
about thirteen thousand. The busi
ness of tbe county consists principally
of agricultural pursuits. Winchester
being tbe only town of any importance
where mercantile trade and manufac
turing is carried oa to any extent.
Tbe principal farm products of the
county are winter wheat aud com.
The wheat crap is always a sure crop
here, and corn never fails of a fair re
turn and a handsome profit to the
farmer. No corn is raised in the coun
ty for export, it nearly all is fed to
hogs and cattle until they are prepar
ed for market. No county of its size
in the state feeds as many hogs and
cattle as this county. No section of
Illinois can produce a better grade ef
winter wheat, which often will arer
age from twenty to twenty-three bush
els to the acre. It is not uncommon
to hear our farmers boast of raising
tie hundred bethels of shelled corn to
the acre. Very little rye, barley or
oats raised in this county. The hay
crop consists of timothy and clorer
mixed. The pasturage is blue grass
and clover, white and red.
Winchester supports one cxteusire
plow manufactory, two extensive car
riage aud wagon shops, oue large fur
niture manufactory, three tile aud
stouc-ware factories, a coal shaft, i)J
feet deep, which employes thirty men,
a packinghouse, two elevators, besides
numerous small shops, mercantile and
business houses that era usually fouud
at a western county seat of two thou
sand people.
Scott county was once the home of
the immortal Douglas. It was here he
opened his first school as a teacher,
and for three long mtnths "taught the
young idea how to shoot," at the log
school house in Winchester. It was
here he made las maideu speech on
the "political topics of the day," and
received the applause of the hardy
yebtuaury who settled at au early day
along the valley of the beautiful river
