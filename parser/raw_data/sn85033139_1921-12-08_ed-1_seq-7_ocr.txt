111 UK BUDGET
Figures Are Given to Congress
by the President.
REDUCTIONS IN TWO YEARS
Makes Big Trim From $4,000,000,000,
Previous Estimate for 1923—First
Federal Attempt to Control
Country's Funds.
Washington, Dec. C. —A federal
budget for the fiscal year 1923, ap
proximately $500,000,000 below the $4,-
000,000,000 figure which had been es
timated some time ago as the mini
mum of government expenditures for
several years to come, faced congress
when It reconvened Monday.
The exact figures as prepared by
the newly-created budget bureau and
transmitted by President Harding in
a special message, were $3,505,745,-
727, including an estimated deficit of
$21,509,000 in the operations of the
postal service.
This total represented u decrease
of $402,107,639 from the $3,907,922,-
800 estimated expenditures for the
■current fiscal year uud $2,032,285,902
from the actual expenditures in the
fiscal year 1921. It Is, however, $167,-
571,977 In excess of the estimated re
ceipts of $3,943,452,003 it.v $24,408,703.
Cati /adjust Budget.
Referring to the apparent deficit for
1923, President Harding wrote congress
that “ways are provided for the rela
tively easy adjustment without added
taxation" of the discrepancy between
the Income and outgo. As one means
he recommended legislation directing
the reduction of the accumulated nav
al supply account by $100,000,000.
Actual appropriations asked of con
gress for the various federal depart
ments and agencies for 1923 total $3,-
224,875,592, exclusive of postoftlce de
partment. This represents a reduction
of $122,800,310 from the original es
timate us presented to the budget
bureau, it is stated, but is approxi
mately $27,000,000 more than the ap
propriations for this fiscal year.
Explaining the $280,879,134 excess
of estimated expenditures in 1923 over
the appropriations asked for, budget
bureau officials explain that some of
the funds actually to be put out will
be carried over in continuing appropri
ations and by other means. They say
that appropriations for a given year
do not accurately reflect actual ex
penses for that year, asserting that
while the appropriations for this fis
cal year were $3,107,807,962, the es
timated outgo will exceed this sum
by Approximately $770,000,000.
$2,900,000,000 for Wars.
Of the total estimated expenditures
for 1023, approximately $2,900,000,000
is to pay for past wars and to keep up
the fighting arms of the government,
leaving only about $000,000,000 for the
peacetime pursuits of the federal es
tablishment. The estimate for the
army and navy is $801,636,107, a re
duction of $00,305,2!t9. as compared
with this fiscal year, and $905,352,741,
as compared with the fiscal year 1921.
The navy estimate of $431,754,000,
It might be explained, does not take
Into account any possible reductions
that might be brought about as a re
sult of the arms conference.
The largest single item in the budget
Is the fund for the interest on the
public debt, the $975,000,000 provided
lacking only $25,000,000 of the total
expenses of the federal establishment
before the World war. In addition
there is an estimate of $309,338,800 for
the war debt sinking fund.
$31,964,000 for Air Service.
Included In the total for the army
and navy is $31,964,400 for develop
ment and maintenance of the air serv
ices of the two departments—sl6,l9s,-
000 for the navy and $14,904,400 for
the army. These compare with ex
penditures this year of $15,000,000 and
$19,159,700, respectively.
The navy estimates carry an Item
of $99,198,000 for continuing construc
tion on the 1910 building program, as
compared to $142,452,000'f0r this year.
Navy pay calls for $148,754,000, an in
crease of $49,000,000.
Pay, mileage, etc., for the army is
the largest Item in the War depart
ment budget, the figure being $154,-
448,000. For the national guard an
expenditure of $28,940,000 is estimated.
Expenditures on public works under
the War department are given ns $57,-
043,900, including $44,246,400 for rivers
and harbors, as compared with $29,-
850,000 for the current year.
$160,000,000 Payments for Vets.

tion, $160,000,000; military and naval
Insurance, $02,713,000; vocational re
habilitation, $127,000,000; medical and
hospital service, $72,000,000, and sal

case. They asked that the Indictments
be quashed.
Werner Schroeder of the governor’s
counsel Introduced copies of agree
ments and stipulations entered Into by
state and defense and then tin* formal
motions to quash tin* Indictments.
The state won the first point In
the argument. C. C. Leforgee, in at
ateklng the Indicemenfs, offered a
certified copy of the record of the
county clerk In Springfield with rela
tion to the selection of the grand jury.
He Insisted that If the state had ob
jections to the record it should pre
sent arguments at once. To this
State’s Attorney Mortimer objected.
He declared the prosecution would
stand on tire record of the county
clerk.
“A certified copy of which we have
presented,” interrupted Mr. Leforgee.
“I will not say as to that,” remarked
Mr. Mortimer. “I reserve the right to
attack tlie copy of the record as pre
sented to you later."
Judge Edwards ruled that the copy
would he admitted in evidence now,
and if the state later desired to con
trovert it it would be permitted to
do so.
Mr, Leforgee took ids defeat grace
fully and then began his argument.

Philadelphia, Dec. 6. —At least 22
persons were killed and a score in
jured when two trains of the Phila
delphia & Reading railway crashed
head-on at full speed on a curve near
Itryn Athyn. Twenty-two bodies have
been removed from the debris.
The impact caused one engine to
loop the loop. The explosion of holl

gas tanks under the cars added to the
horror.
Of twenty-five passengers trapped
in the forward car of one train, but
five escaped injury.
According to George .1. Campbell of
Bryn Athyn, both trains were behind
time and running “wide open," and
met on a section unprotected by block
signals.,
Among those rescued by him was
James Rook, engineman of the north
bound train, who was carried to the
hospital, asking if he was to blame
Oscar Veakle, engineer of the
train, which it was said overran the
orders, was almost hysterical as
stretcher bearers carried him beside
Rook.
“My God, my God, was It my fault?”
he moaned. "Oh, these poor souls."
According to a statement from
Reading officials the accident “seems
to be due to train No. 151, north

the Chicago plants affected by the
strike.
Pickets were in evidence as the

15 middle western packing centers.
