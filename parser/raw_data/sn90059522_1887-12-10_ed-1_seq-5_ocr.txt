'N THE RAILWAY WORLD.
A General Reduction in Freight Rates
Reported from Chicago to the
Missouri River,
Which, It Is Now Claimed, WiU Result
in the Loss of $10,000,000
Annually.
Gen. McNulta, the Wabash Receiver,
Evidently Bound to Hake
Things Lively.
The meeting of the general managers
of the Western roads has resulted in a
general reduction of rates which will
extend from Chicago to Missouri river
points and up and down the river from
Sioux City to Council Bluffs or further.
This is ■ general sweeping reduction to
take effect probably January 1. but pos
sibly as early as Dec. 30. This result
has been brought about by the railroad
companies themselves, of their own vo
lition, and with no other pressure ex
cept that exerted among them
selves. The rates were for the
first five classes 90. 75, 59, 35, 30.
They are now reduced to -.-», 00. 40. 90, 25,
and so^ou to the lowest class, which is
about 10 per cent. The estimated loss
Of the roads in consequence of this re
duction is placed at $10,000,000 annually,
and every dollar of this sum comes out
of the net ear-nines. The Illinois dis
tance tariffs are already arranged, the
lowa representatives are busily at work
getting their distance tariffs En shape so
as to harmonize with the new reduced
through rates, and Chairman Midgley
has issued a call for the Missouri inter
ested roads— Chicago « Alton, Burling
ton. Hock Island. Missouri Pacific, Han
nibal A: St. Joe. Milwaukee & St. Paul,
Wabash and Fort Scott and Culf— to
meet at Cliicago Wednesday next to
take up the work. in speaking of this
widespread reduction the Chicago Times
declares that "the trouble has been pre
cipitated on the lines by their own greed
and their anxiety to get business from
Eastern roads on a pro rata that has
ended in costing them $100 for every
dollar gained by the interchange. It
does not make a tuppence different
which road was primarily responsible:
whether it was the Wabash, which for
six months made a 13-cenl lower rate
from Toledo to St. Louis than from Chi
cago, and then suddenly discovered that
it was a crying injustice to this city;
the Rock Island, which held Daven
port's and Rock Island's interests above
that of all the remainder of the line:
the Burlington, which is charged with
secretly prorating while maintaining a
virtuous outward appearance, or any of
the others. First or last, they cuddled
the Eastern roads and allowed them to
make the through rates and ignore the
Chicago termini. New they are about
to reap the harvest, and the crop is a
bad one for them."
Cutting Wabash Rates.
Chicago, Dec. 9.— Delegations of
prominent merchants, manufacturers
and shippers from Springfield, Quiney.
Jacksonville, Decatur, HI., and Hanni
bal. Mo., were in Chicago to-day to
thank Gen. McNulta, the receiver ofthe
Wabash railroad, for a reduction of the
state tariff rates, which will take effect
Dec. 90. After several addresses had
been made by the delegates, giving to
(Jen. McNulta the honor for the coming
relief of the commerce of Illinois and
for the outgrowing benefits in adjoining
slates and in other roads throughout the
Northwest, the general repned,reaffirm
ing his intention of cutting down the
rates from 10 to 39 per cent, the average
reduction being alwnit 90 per cent.
Shortly afterward the general sent offi
cial notices of this reduction, to take
effect Dec. 20. to the Chicago & Alton,
Chicago. Burlington & Quincy. Illinois
Central and Chicago & Rock Island rail
roads.

The entire structure is to be as firm as
it is possible to make it with timl»er and
iron. C. L. White . & Co., of Tower,

CURRENT COMMENT.
A great many people think that a
K slngger." as A boxer is now denomi
nated in the West is a sort of a human
bull-dog. A large photograph of Tommy
Warren is on exhibition at a Nicollet
avenue sporting goods store, and it was
curious to note the comments of the
ladies, who from their habit of raping
into store windows, of course noticed it.
Tommy is a handsome little fellow and
the photograph which showed him in
stylish attire, drew out exclamations of
surprise and admiration. "Why. I al
ways supposed they looked tough." was
the" comment of about two-thirds ofthe
lair critics.
The severe sentence that Loir Murray
received lor his alleged assault upon
Miss .Sylvester has created considera
ble sympathy in his favor, and a fund is
already being raised for the purpose of
securing him a new trial. There is a
general impression thai certain Influ
ences were brought to bear against
him: that witnesses were spirited away,
and attorneys prevented from defending
him. The chances are that a strong
effort for a second trial will be made.
William Welch yesterday delivered
another invective "against ("en. Viias,
Attorney Erwin and others whom he re
gards as being his opponents in the
libel suit against him. There's one
thing about Mr. Welch— he is always
interesting and invariably contributes
home spicy newspaper reading when
ever lie speaks.
_____ SORTS.
It is truly remarkable that Mayor
Ames, Engineer Rioter, and Aid. K. M.
Johnson should disagree upon the man
ner in which the city work should be
performed. The trio have always worked
together* with such harmony(?). It is
astonishing that Mayor Ames and Aid.
Johnson should not agree.
A fit companion for the famous

administration, is the recently discov

The enterprising and sensitive Jour
nal reporter who published that personal
card in substantiating an alleged inter
view with the eminent J. K. Ward, may
perhaps have rioted that Tollefson's

Fight to see Col. .lames Fairman. the art

yesterday. There are men in the City
who would have given a good deal of

According to the gentlemen who
went to Washington to put in a bid for
the national convention, crow is pretty
good eating under some circumstances..
Col. Charles Johnson will, it is said,
remove to Chicago in the near future.
"-Strifes me," said a gentleman from
Tennessee yesterday, as he surveyed
the muddy streets, "that you have pe
culiar weather here. One "day it will be
so cold that frost will gather on your
stoves: next day It rains, and you have
to wear a rubber coat. The third day
it snows, aud the next day it's warm
enough to wear a straw hat and a linen
duster. I'm coming here to live soon."
It is now about the season when the
young wife begins to think of making
mince pies, and sends to the grocer's for
three pounds of mincemeat for two

SOME SURPRISING EVENTS.
That a man has actually been an ested

pedestrians might fall in and be either
killed or maimed for life.
That the dress-parade Republicans
did riot get there on the convention
enterprise.
The way the town has "limbered up.
so to speak, and the fact that the highly
moral Republican grand jury has de
cided to let the saloonkeepers rest for a
while.
That an apparently energetic effort is
being made to prosecute the venders of
adulterated milk.
That the severe sentence Murray re

That Rev. Co Lightly Morrill has kept

That the .Star-News does not attempt

THE STATE OF TRADE.
Regular Weekly Review of the Commer-
cial Situation.
LEGITIMATE TRADE ACTIVE.
Speculation in Products Takes a Down
ward Agitation of
the Tariff.
New York. Dec. 9— R. G. Dun &
Co.'s weekly review of trade will say:
Legitimate trade continues fairly active
for the season, though embarrassed in
some branches by the fluctuations in
speculative markets. Speculation in
products after a few days of wild ad
vance, has taken a turn downward, as
the natural result af enormous sales to
realize. With rapidly expanding cur
rency money is generally easier than a
week ago. though rates are still high at
many points, and complaints of slow
collections do not diminish. Agitation
of the tariff question already begins to
cause revision of calculations for the
future in some departments. The sharp
decline in real estate speculations and
prices, at some Southern and Western
points, tends to check developments
there, and .subject investors to some
financial strain. Large sales of Besse
mer iron at $18.50 are reported, and a
sale of steel rails, netting J3l at mill,
has been made. Buyers still are back
ward, but brokers "openly offer below
i*?*'.-.'. Virginia pig iron. No. 1. is offered
at 130 for delivery where freight is $1.20,
and some Alabama iron for future de
livery at low prices. One Thomas turn
ace goes out of blast, and the i.ehigh
strike causes some embarrassment.
Coal has declined about 81; orders
slackening. Woolens do not improve
in demand, and heavy goods open, in
some cases, below last year's prices, so
that manufacturers arc not encouraged
to increase their purchases of raw wool,
which appears rather weak. Raw cot
ton has declined an eighth, but goods
are held at recent advances. The boot
and shoe trade is large and promising,
with exceptionally good payments and
cheaper material, but there is complaint
that competition cuts down prices too
far. Leather is weaker, but tanners
reason that after seven years' decline
prices are low enough. The movement
ot freight westward shows an increase
of 15,000 tons for November, and east
bound shipments are increasing, but the
bank exchanges of all cities outside of
New York begin to fall below those of
last year. The decline at all cities last
week was 14.3 per cent, and outside
New York 2.0 per cent. At most inte
rior points trade is reported fair for the
season, but collections are "slow and
have to lie forced" at Atlanta, slow at
Detroit, fair at Memphis and Omaha,
and rather better at Kansas City.
Money at Chicago is in unabated de
mand at 7 per cei\, and operators bid 8
lor funds to carry products at interior
towns. Eastern bills are quoted! at par,
bank balances at New York having
been drawn as low as is convenient.
Though the money markets are on the
whole easier.the pressure at speculative
centers continues. The treasury has
paid out for the week ,000,000 more
than it has taken in, and
since July 10, has increased the aggre
gate circulation $53,000,000. Exports
from New York for five weeks are 7 per
cent below and imports •*> per cent above
those of the same week Inst year. Wheat
speculation reached 30.000,000 bushels
on Tuesday, and 105,000.000 for the
week, and prices advanced sharply.only
to close a shade lower than a week ago.
Corn and oats gained 3'*c for the
week and oil is unchanged. Coffee has
advanced Jt'e, and the excitement in
metals has lifted copper l.c, ami tin
nearly 1 cent per pound, but the reac
tion in pork products takes prices a lit
tle lower than a week ago. The aver
age risk in food products since July 1
was a shade over it) per cent on Tues
day, and it-is questioned whether the
legitimate effect of a partial failure of
crops has not been fully realized in
prices, but the increasing supply of cur
rency still tends to keep speculation
active. Stocks have been weaker since
congress met. though holders look for a
better demand in January, when yearly
dividends and profits come to be in
vested. The total business failures for
the United States and Canada this week
were 254; corresponding week of last
year 274.
BAD FOR BLAINE.
Anything But Favorable Com
ments on the Unofficial Mes
sage.
New York, Dec. 9.— commenting
on Mr. Blame's message the Times
says: "This, then, is the sum of Mr.
Blame's policy; and as lie is the leader
of the Republican party at present it
must be taken as the policy of the Re
publicans until they repudiate it. It is
not a policy they can go before the peo
ple with. Tliere is too much common
sense and too much every -day old-fash
ioned honesty in the United States yet
for the voters to be trapped by so reck
less, so shallow, and so dangerous a
scheme as this. They know that they
are enormously overtaxed. They know
that the surplus taxes are a constantly
increasing peril to their business ami a
steadily heavier drain on their resour
ces. They will not follow, the leader
who would tax them only to squander,
and who would throw their money out
of the treasury windows rather than
lift the most onerous of the tariff duties
on the materials of American indos-
i ties.*'
The Tribune says: "Mr. Blame. in
Europe speaks as an American. "Mr.
Cleveland in America speaks as a Brit
ish manufacturer, anxious to be ad
mitted without any charge to a share of
the best and largest market in the
world. Americans who make that mar
ket have to bear the expense of self
government in the natron, the states,
the counties, cities and towns, and es
pecially in the school districts, where
competent American voters for the fut
ure are trained. Without contributing
a cent to these expenditures, British
manufacturers want to share in that
market and to break (town American
industries by their competition, their
large capital and their under-paid labor.
Mr. Cleveland appears as the attorney
for the British interest in this contro
versy, and Iris words move Mr. Blame
to indignant protest.'"
The World says: "The Maine states
man's interview is in fact a proclama
tion that Mr. Blame consider-- himself to
be the chosen champion of protection
and that he is ready to enter tire presi
dential lists again" as such. The fact
that Mr. Blame had not read the full
text of the president's message must
serve as his excuse for misrepresenting
its purport. Mr. Blame is behind the |
times on this question. The people of
this country are bent upon stopping the
surplus, instead of squandering or di
viding it. They believe that the only
honest place, as well as the best place,
for every dollar not needed for the le
gitimate expenses of the government is
in the pocket of the man who earned it.
President Cleveland stands for this
purpose. Mr. Blame comes forward as
the champion of the opposite idea. The
Democratic party could not ask for a
better issue.*'
The Sun says: "If Brother Blame
entertains such loose notions of the re
lations between the federal government
and the states.it strikes us that he would j
be a conspicuously unfit person to in- j
trust with the nation's financial affairs."
Chicago, Dec. The Tribune this
morning, commenting editorially on
Mr. Blame's reply to President Cleve
land's message, says:
"Mr. Blame, as 'might have been ex
pected, has presented high tariff from a
partisan 'mint of view, as an opposition
issue to the president's views mi tariff
reduction. We have a long and appar
ently very pleasant winter before us In
which to discuss this question, and it is
a question which must be settled en
tirely upon its Merits and not upon po
litical considerations. So far, therefore,
a- Mr. Blame seeks to make it appear
as a party issue, lie will fail. It
is a sufficient explanation of Mr.
Blame's interview that he i- I
Pennsylvania!!. He was brought up in
an atmosphere of ultra-protection. He
has sat at the feet of the high-tariff
Gamaliels of that state and imbibed,
their doctrines. Like all Pennsylva
nians. Republicans and Democrats, he
believes in enormous duties on imports .
for the purpose of coddling the mill
tosses and protecting the so-called 'in
fant industries,* which long ago came of
age and ought to be able to go alone.
Every Pennsylvania!! believes that the
protective system promotes his interests,
and that in promoting his interests jt j
enhances the general good of the public.
It is almost needless to say that Mr.
Blame, as well as other Pennsylvania
Republicans in taking this position,.
makes no account of the precedents #f.
1857. of 188*2-88, or of the platform, of
1884, which explicitly declares: 'The
Republican party pledges itself to cor
rect the irregularities of the tariff and i
to reduce the surplus.' They even:
fought the small reductions of 1883.:
The Blame interview will have to stand
upon its merits, and it will be
indorsed or condemned in accord
ance with the value of the argu
ments set forth, and the public jiutg
ment will not be influenced by the dis
tinguished name behind them. It is
the weakest ground Mr. Blame has ever
yet occupied, and no national party can
expect to go into a presidential cam
paign on that issue, no matter who may
be its leader, and win. It is in a posi
tion of direct hostility to the report of
the tariff commission and to the Repub
lican platform of 1884. Upon this ques
tion, therefore, we beg leave to differ
from Mr. Blame, as he differs from us.
Freely acknowledging his right to his
own belief, as a Republican we claim
the same right as such another, free to
state our belief, that in leading the co
horts of the coddled state of Pennsyl
vania with his lieutenants —
Kelly. Cameron and McPherson— he
will find that Pennsylvania is but one
state, and that there is a large army out
side its borders who do not propose to
be levied upon any longer for its benefit.
"The surplus question must be settled
in some way. and in a different way
from what it has been settled. It can
not be settled in accordance with the
Blame idea."

THE CHOLERA.
Dr. Ranch Thinks the Louisiana
Authorities Have Not Taken
Proper Precautions.
Spuing fiki.i). 111. Dec., 9.— Dr.
Ranch, secretary of the state board of
health, upon learning that the Alesia
had arrived at New Orleans with GOO
immigrants from the cholera-infected
districts of Italy, had the following
telegraphic correspondence with Dr.
Joseph Holt, president of the Louisiana
state board of health :
"Is there any truth in the report that
the Alesia has'arrived at New Orleans
from Palermo with over COO passengers
from the cholera-infected districts of
Italy?''
To this President Bolt made a reply
as foi lows :
"The steamship Alesia left Palermo
Nov. ii. with 014 immigrant passengers
and an English surgeon on board.
Clean bill of health : no ease of sickness
on voyage ; vessel exceptionally clean.
Arrived at quarantine Dec. 4: detained
three days. Extra careful disinfection
of every article of baggage, ship ap
parel and entire vessel. Reports from
surgeon, captain and from \\ ashington
indicate no cholera in Italy during past
month."
On receipt of the above Dr. Rauch
sent the following reply:
"Regret that you did not detain the
Alesia and passengers longer. Twice
has cholera been introduced into this
country, via New Orleans, at this season
of the year. No reliance at this time on
the reports of the surgeon, captain and
Washington authorities in regard to the
existence of cholera in Italy during the,
past month. Why was the Alesia sent,
to New Orleans instead of to New,
York?"

yards across. The audience was seated
a round, terr feet above. The two horses
were gored, several matadors were in
jured and Felieian Olague, the espada,
was taken off the ring for dead, but was
afterward found to be alive, though
seriously injured.
