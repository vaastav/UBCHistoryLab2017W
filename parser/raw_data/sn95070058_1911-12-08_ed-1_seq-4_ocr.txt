Although the tobacco roorgnnlza-

The government printing office hav
ing published 21,11157,719 public docu
ments the past year , Is probably the
greatest supplier of old Junk In the
country.
It Is a misfortune to the men of
this country that Dr. Wiley cannot get
his pure tobacco law into operation
Lef'-ro the Christmas cigars are put
on the market.
In view of the way .John D. collected
his loans from the Morritt brothers ,
we have decided not to ask him for
the loan of $7.75 with which to buy
Christmas presents.
Serious charges , were made against
the army in the inspector general's
report , but If they had succeeded In
beating the navy at foot ball all
would liuvo been overlooked.
A Smithsonian Institute professor
cays the world will continue its jour
neys round the sun for 10,000,000
years. That ought to give time for
a decision in the Lorimer case.
Roosevelt Is charged with having
made a deal with Wall street , but
there will not be much complaint if
ho worked off the two spots on them
and gave them no high trumps.
Seventy thousand women register
ed for the city election In Los An
geles. This seems to indicate that
California women are anxious to
make use of their right of suffrage.
While wo disapprove of the Sunday
colored supplement , we fear still more
the demoralization of our children
from the Congressional Record which
is again turned loose in our homes.
When the reporters are listening
the congressmen will speak respectfully -
fully of the tarif board , but for pur
poses of practical politics they will
place a higher value on the garden
seeds.
The Irish players were riotously re
ceived In New York , but as the money
kings have been so Improvident as to
erect their skyscrapers in the kitchen
garden , no vegetable offerings were
made.
J. I * . Morgan is now located in the
thirty-first floor of the Hankers Trust
Co. In New York. As ho has very
little to do , he will bo glad to stop
and gossip with any of our citizens
who may visit the metropolis.
Of course Hanker Morse had no par
ticular reason to fear punishment
when ho took the money. All the pun

There was at first much opposition
to fortifying Panama , but It seems to
bo agreed now that a $400.000.000
canal is too valuable property to leave
lying around the back yard nights
with all these disreputable characters
prowling about.
The report that President Tuft Is
having a derby hat built Is one of
many signs going to show that the
"plug hat" Is gradually being rele
gated to Indian doctors , circus sales
men , and the more Infantile sprouts
of the smart set.
A great many good souls that are
now advocating the referendum , the
recall , nnd all the other so-called reform -
form dope , were just as crazy about
greenbacklstn , the grange movement ,
free silver , free trade nnd other Isms
in the past , nnd If they did live for
another quarter of a century , they
are Hiiro to swallow every now thing
' In politics that would happen to ap
pear In flight.

WHO FURNISHED THE MONEY ?
The labor unions are doing the right
thing In denouncing the MeNnmnrus.
They ought to go further and demand
that the parties who furnished the
money to the MeNanmras , bo run to
earth. Somebody furnished that mon
ey the McNamaras didn't plan all
that murderous conspiracy out of the
love for human blood. Who furnished
the money ?
Senator Clapp of Minnesota calls
President Taft a despot of the dark
est eye. all because the president Haw-
fit to refuse to glvo his sanction to
the admission of Arizona as a state
under a constitution which permitted
the recall of judges. Some people
have very queer Ideas of tyranny.
Some people take themselves and
their vlewr , so seriously as to be very
funny. Senator Clapp is one of those
people.
That the school building of the fu
ture Is to bo a social center for the
community Instead of a building to
which our children are sent five days
In the week , but is never visited by
the parents , Is certain. It is being
agitated all over the country and now
buildings are being constructed with
this end In view nnd are supplied
with audience rooms , platforms , and
all that Is required for holding public
entertainments , lectures and iniisl-
calcs.
The democrats In congress can
have the advice of their favorite
statesman in regard to the best way
of managing the Alaskan problems.
When lie was president , Thomas Jefferson -
forson wrote to Albert Oallatin , his
secretary of the treasury , under date
of Nov. 8 , 1807 : "I am afraid we
know too Mttle as yet of the lead
mines to establish a permanent sys
tem. I verily believe that of leasing
will bo the best for the United
States. "
TO HE EXCITNG SESSION.
The session of congress that opened
Monday promises to be an interesting
one. Presidential politics will cut a
big figure , in view of the fact that
next year Is presidential year. It
will be a year of vicious attack and
sharp retort. No legislation to
amount to anything is looked for , be
cause every faction will be looking
for a chance to slaughter every other
factor's prospects to claim credit from
the public. Huncombe will be on tap ,
say those who know , and the regular
republicans , the insurgents and the
democrats will all jockey for position.
Mr. Brandeis , who has made sev
eral important suggestions concerning
the better management of railroads ,
makes a further Interesting contribu
tion in the "Engineering Magazine"
for the present month , to the effect
that efficiency and unit standards
could bo better maintained if the
government should establish a bureau
for railroad along the same line as
the agricultural department , the de
partment of commerce and labor , and
other government bureaus. The time
has come when the government has
properly a great function in indus
trial business. The functions of the
government In these departments Is
not only to prohibit nnd regulate , but
much more the constructive field of
ascertainment , experiment , and edu
cation.
Iowa has a Woman's club that has
chosen a most fitting and commend
able object for which to labor. It is
nothing less than a study of physical
perfection nnd how to obtain it for
the rising generation of lowans. A
campaign is on looking toward the in
struction of every mother In the state
in the needs and possibilities of child
welfare. Theory is not enough ; from
now on , every Infant In Iowa will be
the subject of practice , and the stan
dard Is perfection. A woman physi
cian who is a member of the club , has
been sent to Europe to study stan
dards and methods In nil European
countries for a year at the club's ex
pense , and the matter is being man
aged in a most practical way. It is
a splendid undertaking nnd the most
far-reaching and Important that any
club of women has yet undertaken.
Beside it the fight for the ballot sinks
into insignificance. All success to the
women of Iowa !
FINDING PRESENTS FOR MEN.
No , Genevleve , don't buy your best
fellow that dinky little blotter holder
that has to be rolled back and forth
with a sea sick motion. Remember
that George gets from his insurance
agent flat strips of blotting paper that
are twlco as handy on his desk.
Nor don't offer him bunches of
shaving paper with a lot of frills and
flufflness that will merely catch dust.
George probably uses a safety razor
and cleans it at the hot water faucet.
If you want to glvo him something
ho will really like , study the kind of
neckwear he affects , and go down to
the swellest men's furnishing goods
store you can find , and buy him a tie
as near In color tone and pattern n
you can to those he IH already wear-
Ing.
Man Is it conservative critter In his
personal habits. If he likes Inconspic
uous patterns In his negligee shirts ,
don't pick him stripes an noisy as a
barber's pole , that will glvo him a
grouch every time he puts It on for
duty's sake.
THE PAVING MOVEMENT.
Every Norfolk patriot will rejojlce
over the completion of the petition
calling for the paving of Norfolk av
enue from Seventh Htreet west to
Fourteenth , and of Ninth street from
Norfolk avenue north to Prospect ave
nue. It Is an Improvement that In
badly needed and Its achievement will
mean another big step for Norfolk
toward the goal that It Is aiming at.
The city will look to the mayor
and council for speedy action In push
ing thu matter along , as they have al
ready given assurance of their hearty
sympathy with this progressive move
ment.
ment.With
With the completion of this pro
jected paving , there still will remain
one section of town that ought to get
Into the paving bandwagon. There
will still bo need of a paved street to
the now depot at South Norfolk and
with that accomplished , together with
that which Is proposed by the petition
that has just been submitted , Nor
folk will become an altogether differ
ent city than It ever has been.
Americans are likely to DO more or
less suspicious and ready to take of
fense when foreigners of note , espe
cially Englishmen , tell us what they
think of lib , analyze our motives nnd
criticise are Institutions , but when
AmbnssadoHryce consents to toll
the people of thu changes ho sees and
the progress be notes since he first
visited America forty years ago , wo
are all ready to listen to his words
of commendation or warning. Forty
years ago Mr. Htycc saw grave dan
ger for this republic In the strife be
tween the north and the south which
was most bitter at that time , now be
sees that bitterness scarcely more
than a memory. Forty years ago
there could bo nothing much worse
and apparently more hopeless than
the government of American cities.
Now be finds it wonderfully Improved
and progressing most hopefully to
ward a higher standard. Our civil
service reform and our currency
strengthening were liberally compli
mented end the great English pin-
bassndor expressed the belief that
having lived down the other great
evils that had threatened the life of
the republic in the past , we should
prove equal to solving the new and
equally grave problems that confront
the nation today. His words should
give us courage to attack the prob
lems of our day as bravely as our fa
thers did those of forty years ago.
THE McNAMARA CONFESSION.
The confessions of the McNamaras
in the Los Angeles Times dynamiting
case , one pleading guilty to murder
and the other to blowing up the
Llewellyn Iron works , brings to a
close one of the most sensational
crimes of history and will glvo gen
eral satisfaction to the public in the
thought that the guilty have been
found out.
Twenty-one employes of the Los
Angeles Times were blown into eter
nity by dynamite. The Times had for
years been fighting union labor. The
Times at once declared that the crime
was a union labor conspiracy nnd
labor leaders the country over argued
there was no foundation for such
statement. Some months after the
crime , the two McNamaras were ar
rested on Information that had been
secured by Detective Burns. They
were arrested In Indianapolis and hur
ried across the country to Los An
geles. Labor leaders denounced this
as illegal kidnaping. An Immense
fund was raised for the defense. Clar
ence Darrow , who had acted ns coun
sel for the defense in the Idaho gov
ernor assassination case , took charge
of the McNamnra defense. The mat
ter of securing a jury was a difficult
one. The trial had been in progress
two months and only eight jurors had
(
been secured. Then came arrests on
the charge of bribing prospective jur
ors , and later a rumor that some of
the sworn jurors had been tampered
with.
Friday sensational rumors flow
thick and fast. Then , In the evening ,
came the confessions , like a thunder
bolt out of a clear sky. Nobody ex
pected them at least , the general
public outside of Los Angeles had not
anticipated them.
The crime of the McNnmaras cnn
not bo laid at the door of labor as a
wholo. Laboring men , ns a class , like
most other men , would denounce such
methods ns damnably detestable and
would stand staunchly for enforce
ment of the law. That the crime of
the McNnmaras In trying to coerce
the Los Angolcs Times to accept
terms of union labor was a dastardly
one , no man or element neither capi
talist nor laborer would attempt to
deny.
NEW AMERICAN CARDINALS.
The creation by Pope Plus X. of
three more American cardinals Is nn
event that means a great deal to Ro
man Catholic Americans. Previously
there has been but ono American car
dinal , .lames Gibbons of Baltimore.
One reason why the college of car
dinals has remained HO largely Italian
was that In the early days It was so
difficult to communicate with the
members of the college from foreign
parts. History records one cane whore
a pope appointed a man who had
been dead some little time , the news
not having reached Home. And ono
English cardinal never learned of his
appointment , so many believe , al
though his death took place ten
months after the event. The English
court kept the news for him , and In
those days of slow communication It
never reached him in any other man
ner.
Many American Catholics bellovo
that the Italian churchmen have been
so absorbed In the artistic and ma
terial development of the city of
Rome , ( hat they have given far too
little thought to the Interest of the
church at large.
! t is the belief of American Cath
olics that the American church shows
a devoutness and loyalty that entitles
It to larger influence. On the other
hand , It Is remarked that the unsatis
factory results of Italian churchmanship -
ship are shown by the failure of that
church to plant a deeper feeling of
loyalty in the hearts of the Immi
grants who come here from that coun
try.
try.A
A Jesuit father , writing In the
Church Extension Magazine , Illus
trates this point by telling of bis ex
periences in canvassing among a gang
of Plcdmonteso Italians In an Ameri
can mining camp , to secure funds for
a Catholic chapel. None of them
would glvo a cent , and finally they
pelted the priest with coal. On apply
ing to some Japanese miners , each of
thp latter gave him $1.
On the basis of population , It Is
pointed out that the United States
would be entitled to six cardinals. In
the old days it might take a year to
get a quorum of the college at Rome.
Hut now Rome can reach Cardinal
Gibbons at Baltimore in thirty min
utes any day , and in ten days ho
could be walking up the steps of the
Vatican.
The situation , says a writer in the
North American Review , was as if all
our cabinet members and senators
were chosen from New England , leav
ing the rest of the country to bo sat
isfied with postmasters and Internal
revenue collectors. That Pope Plus
was influenced by these arguments Is
apparent , and the four Americans will
play a large part at Rome.
BOILING IT DOWN.
President Taft's message contains
this time but about 6,000 words. For
every one person that read his former
15,000-word production , there will be
a hundred who will scan this effort
closely.
It was R. L. Stevenson , we believe ,
who once remarked upon the divine
gift of leaving things out. There is
a poem , dear to the heart of every
newspaper man , that advises the
would-be contributor to leave out ev
ery superfluous word and comma , af
ter having skeletonized it to the very
limit , to send it on to the editor , who
then will begin to boil it down.
People who never had literary or
newspaper training have no concep
tion of the Increase in effectiveness
that comes through cutting out super
fluous words and phrases. Every
needless sentence Is so much dead
wood that fatigues the mind , and
weakens the structure as a means of
persuasion.
A magazine editor once showed us
the manuscript submitted by a talent
ed writer. The magazine people , to
save valuable space. had gone
through it and cut out about one-
fourth of the words without affecting
the force of the statement In the least
degree.
In the ordinary letter to the press
produced by the untrained writer ,
about one-half of the words are abso
lutely needless , being merely repeti
tions of ideas expressed before.
President Taft seems to have gain
ed some apprehension of this fact.
Perhaps he has come to realize that
the president's annual message to con
gress Is his best opportunity to gain
the public ear. He has just traveled
some 15,000 miles to talk to 5,000,000
people. And yet through the news
papers he can by a tersely worded
message get twlco as many hearers
without stirring out of the white
house.
In the old days It used to be cus
tomary for all the newspapers to print
the president's message In full. Fifty
years ago a newspaper would sweep
local news nnd sensational doings out
of Its pages to give space to the one
great public document that people
were supposed to peruse carefully.
For the last few years there has
scarcely been a newspaper In the
country that has been willing to give
a verbatim report , on account of the
growing length of the messages.
AROUND THE TOWN.
Wo'ro rather sorry John D. resigned
Just at this time. We'd hoped that he'd
stick around till Christmas , at least ,
and that ho might possibly send us a
car of gasoline on that gladsome day.
But he's resigned , nnd now we'll
have to pay fifteen cents a gallon for
the silly stuff.
Isn't It queer how you think you
need certain thinks to complete your
happiness , nnd then when you get
, 'em , find you're no better off than you
were before ? It's that way with buckwheat -
' wheat cakes. We couldn't wait for
summer to end , In order that we
could have Vln for breakfast. And
now we find they don't agree with our
stomach , and we never want to see a
b. c. again as long as we live. If wo
do see any more of 'em , we won't live
long that's n cinch.
Now why not pave some street to
that new depot at South Norfolk.

Wltten has struck an artesian well
that pours out water 100 degrees hot.
t Now wouldn't that scald you ?
I Thin kind of weather makes a man
I want to get out and glvo Col. Bogey
a run for his money.
Or go swimming with Sol.
Speaking of Bogey , that dream we
had last summer of making the course
In HO still holds the record. G. B. C.
claims to have dreamed that he
made It In 29 , but wo doubt It.
Norfolk's on the way , all right , all
right , and don't yon forget it.
West Norfolk avenue and North
Ninth street are going to be paved
with something better than good in
tentions.
Yes , Geraldine , you can keep on wear
ing your fall OIIOH until it gets cold.
The fact that it Is now Dee. (1 ( doesn't
cut any ice.
It sounds good to hear the brakeman -
man call out "South Norfolk ! " Lets
the passenger know that this is some
burg.
"Quito a depot , " said ono passenger
the other night to a comrade. "Oh ,
not too much of a depot for a town
Norfolk's size , " says he. All of which
shows that It pays to advertise , even
by building depots.
We told you some time ago that
Christinas was getting closer , and
maybe by and by you'll realize it.
Omaha democrats want R. L. Met-

"ED. " KOWE'S PHILOSOPHY.
( Copyright 1U11 ; Oeo. Matthetv Adams. )
When a package is delivered at a
house , the little girls of the family
hope it is dry goods ; the little boys
hope It is something to eat.
Sometimes I half way fear that
some day I'll become tired of "Annie
Laurie. "
When you recall that Henry James
1 is famous , you should bo willing to
! admit that Fame occasionally makes
mistakes.
The only remedy for anything is to

Don't you sometimes feel that it is
I the duty of your friends to take your
I enemies out and whip them , without
i mixing you up in it ?
When a man writes his name on a
j hotel register , he can read it easily ;
I but he can't help marveling at the
poor writers who have registered
ahead of him.
Sometimes people make up their
minds to neglect a man , thinking he
[ won't notice it ; but he does , although
noticing the neglect does him no good.
Don't get the notion that your enemy -
| emy will be less industrious in defam
ing you if you do him a favor that
should go to a friend. All your enemy
wants from you is to be let alone.
Sometimes I find that many per
sons who are accepted as honest have
funny notions of honesty.
Every family really needs a dog to
eat its bones , and a pig to eat Its
slops.
No man has a right to economize
to the extent of neglecting to pay his
debts.
When people try to give the Impres
sion that they are rich , you may depend
pend upon It that they are not. The
really rich always try to keep the
fact quiet , on account of the assessor.
When some men can't act mean ,
they talk mean.
Everyone at some time finds a lump

Popular men know so many people
that speaking to all of them must be
a burden.
Cupid has n reputation of being In

If a borrower promises to pay back
more quickly than man ever paid be

mortgage on his house nnd lot , ns
security.
I have always had an Idea that
'coon nnd 'possum are more fit to
hunt than to eat.
It will do you no good to call old

There Is no good fishing , nnd there
are no good times.
Men have their faults , but they
seem to be more popular than women

Nothing hurts n boy's feelings so

In winter , If I wear underclothing
heavy enough for outdoors , 1 can't

When a mini given up n marriage
engagement becauno the woman Is
not a member of his church , the real
facts are , he wants to gut. out of It.
There probably never was an ugly
man who did not excuse his looks by
thinking thai he was smart enough
to make up for his lack of beauty.
Most people are disposed to give
both sides when there Is only one.
Most people have n habit of giving
away their sympathy , and keeping
their money.
"You aggravate me so much , " a lit

At some time In your life , proud as

The strongest men , morally , are
those who know they cannot afford to

What causes some women to lool

vlo\v. The Chinese begin to read at
the end of the line and at thn bottom
of the | inge. The bat hangs upside
down and laughs at a topsy turvy
world. The skeptic stands on hl.s head
Intellectually nnd says. "See me hold
up the world ! " The world smiles ,
but the skeptic still argues. Iteinem
ber the "House Upside Down" on tln
midway nt the Buffalo Pan-American
exposition ? Carpets , rugs , chairs , In
blex. dishes , were on the celling. Wall
paper and pictures on the wall wore-
upside down. Finally you got con
fused and you couldn't tell whether
'twas the house or you that was up
side down. You felt that you were
walking , lly-llke , head down from the
celling.
The truth Is this Is a topsy turvy
world. One man saving to build a
house , another selling below cost
One's fighting for Justice , another lloo-
Ing from It. One man spending mon
ey for ( lowers for n woman , his neigh
bor spending money for a divorce. One
man's at the drug Htore for medicine *
to prolong life ; another's buying poi
son to end his. Thousands come Into
the world upside down nnd always
continue so. They are human crabs -
ever going backward. Society IH life-
upside down. The world started right ,
but Satan , Archimedes-like , got his
lever under It and with sin turned II
upside down. Paradise turned to per
dltlon , heaven to hell. Christ comes
and with the lever of the cross turns
It right side up. Life Is a house. With \
many It Is upside down. Heredity , en
vlroinnent , education , Indigestion , false
standards , have put us wrong. Thing *
are distorted , misplaced , untrue.
Ground Floor.
Kitchen's on this floor. To pot
along with a man "food the brute ! "
says the cynical woman. Food's fuel.
Fasting's not always a duty. Feast-
Ing's not always a sin. Sometimes
fasting's a sin and feasting a duty.
John fasted. Jesus feasted. fJIrls at
school are taught calculus , but not
cooking. In the coal regions of my
state they say "strikes are caused by
bad cooking. " In a lumber camp when *
men saw wood they get dinner with 11
can opener and a coffeepot. Brides hint
bettor not cook that way If ttys wood of
the desk Is the only lumber their hurt-
bunds see. Many n kitchen's upside
down. Smile In the dining room. Ask
a blessing , but don't cant. There's n
kind of piety that's a disease of tho.
liver. No gossip , no snarling , at your
table. A hearty laugh may do as
much good as Oolong or Java , tender
loin or cutlet. Parlor's on this floor.
It's artificial , superficial and shallow.
In it wo act like puppets and dross
like dolls. Secretly we bate the par
lor. Wo keep It dark , stiff nnd formal.
"Children , " calls mother , "keep out of
the parlor. You'll break something ! "
Sleeping rooms are on this floor.
Third of our lives are passed there.
When you reach threescore and toi > I
you'll have spent nearly twenty-live
years there. Babyhood nnd childhood
mean much sleep. "Bedrooms upshift
down ? " Sometimes. Either barren
as a barn or formal ns n funeral. Man
has to tlgure out those pink log pil
lows to be slept on or used as n bar
ricade for the door ? Is the crazy quilt
n coverlet or nn ornament ? Best sleep *
I ever had was when ns n college boy
I went preaching In the country. Big.
well ventilated room , whitewashed
walls. After 1 had said "Now I lay
me" n dear old fashioned , motherly
woman came to tuck me In bed , put
hot bricks to my feet nnd prayed that
God would bless the poor preacher
boy. Thai night I Mept the sloop of
childhood. On this floor In the front
room with the big bay window Is the
Hitting room-no , living room , I mean.
That's the room. Here's where you
are yourself , where you play with the
children , where you road the Bible-
and have family prayers. Make the
living room of life right !
The Attic.
"Except ye become converted nnd fin
little children , " said Christ. Remem
ber that third story attic room In your
old homo ? Children multiplied. Trun
dle beds were added. Then we were
packed to bed up In the attic under thiv
eaves. There we hoard the pattering
rain upon the roof. There we saw the
twinkling of the stars nt night. Thov
wove themselves Into poetry and
dreams. There In the cedar chest was
grandmother's wedding dross. She was
but sixteen then. Yonder hung grand
father's Revolutlonnry sword. How it
used to gleam In the moonlight ! That
was the place for dreams ! The frn-
( jranoe of the llhics and roses came In
the little iittlc windows. Not spider
webs did our child eyes see , but fresco
of nnguln. With the passing of tlu >
iittlc third floor wont our dreams and
i-Islons. From our soul's top floor wean
an see across the river of death to the
'lowing domes and towers of the shin
kig city beyond. In the IIOUKV right
< lde up the lower windows look out oa
the ash pile and household garbage
MHI. The upper windows see
