CUBANS HAVEliTTLE TO
SAY ABOUT MESSAGE
Havana Dec ITho message of
President Hooscwlt to tho American
Congress nan published III tho local
press this afternoon No editorial com
ment on It was made Liberal and Mod
erate lenders are chary of expi easing an
opinion of the president declaration
regarding a Cuban policy but tho gen
eral vIew Is that It does not differ ma
terially from tho statements made In
the letter to Senor Qucaijn the Cuban
minister last September and that time
final determination of the1 policy of the
United States rosin In the hands of
Congress The Dlarlo de la Marina to
morrow will aay
whim President Roosevelts declara
tions relative to Cuba arc In fact a
paraphniKoof his letter to Senor Quem
da the rnwsngo contains the additional
statement that If Cuba acquires tho
revolutionary habit It Is Impossible that
the Islands Independence be main
tained for fdnce the United State Is
standing In the position of a guarantor
as the protector of life and property
It would then be compelled to Intervene
anew Although this sentiment iilrendy
lions been expressed by Senator lleur
Idgo amid Hecy Hoot its reiteration by
President Hoosovelt gives It the final
stamp of authority1
Commenting on the mcsunge the Iost
tomorrow will say Tlmt part of the
message was expected by those
who thought that the present opposition
to tho presidents Cuban plans would
cull forth an appeal stronger than usual
for the prompt evacuation of tho Island
and the restoration of the Cuban ro
public Is tho president getting luke
warm regarding Cubit Possibly not
but whether or not there Is certainly
not that ring of enthusiasm In his
words regarding Cuba always notice
able In his utterances
