Notlilwf Is more certnln thnn that the ui
SI so-cnnid touico, ..nr.ulnius and mtut
tines, which depend upon slcohdl for their
Iffect, Is Injurious to health lu the long run.
What Rden up must come down, and the
tlevftilon (it i"'.n, the. .cmporary exnllnrn
tlon resulting from n dose of medicine con
tBinltiir alcohol will cerlnlnly be followed
In a few houis by u rorrmpondlnK duprts-';
lion, to relieve which another dtse must ue
taken.
In other word, many liquid patent rardl
linen derlvo their effect entirely from the
ilcohol they contain.
Alcehol, and medicines containing It, ara
temporary stimulants and not In ar sense
i truo tonic. In fart, It la doubtful If any
eirdlolno or drug In n real tonic,
A true tonln I something which will re
new, replenish, build up the exhausted
nervous sytitm and wasted Mmups of tha
body, something that will enrich the blood
ind endow It with the propir proportions of
red and white corpuscles, which prevent or
lestroy dlssaar. cerm.". TIiIh 1b whut n real
tonlo should do nnd no dm? or nlcohollo
illmulant will do It,
The only true tonle In nature la whole
home food, thoroughly dilated. F.vcry
parf'lele of nervous eneify, every minute
muscle, fiber nnd drop of blood la, created
lally from the food we digest.
Tho mere ratine of food has little to do
with tho repair of waste tissue, biit tho
perfect digestion of tho food eaten has
everything to do with It,
Tho reason eo few peoplo have perfect
migration Is because from wrong hablta of
living tho stomach ha.t gradually lost tho
power to afcrolo tho gastrin Juice, piptoncs
nnd no I 1s In sunielnnt quantity.
To euro Indigestion nnd elomaeh troubles
It h neerasary to lake nftcr meals somo
harmltaj preparation which will supply tho
natural peptone and dl&staso which every
weak ito.naeh lanka, and probably tho best
preparation of this character Is Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, which may bo found In
every rtrus store nnd which contain In
pleasant, palatable form tho wholesome
prptona nnd cttft.st.isn which naturo requlrcj
for prompt digestion,
Ono or two of these excellent tablets
taken ntter meals will prevent souring, fer
mentation and aridity and Insure completo
digestion and assimilation,
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are equally
valunblo for llttlo children aa for adults, ai
they contain nothing harmful or stimulat
ing, but only tho natural digestives,
Ono of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will di
gest 1,600 grains of meat, eggs or other
wholtsomo food, nnd they nro In every

about In the only natural way a restorative

NEW YORK, Dec. 7. Tha Italian consul
general In this city, G. Branch!, has writ
ten to the secretary of tbo Produce ox
change to notify nil the members and othor
traders In this city interested In exporting
grain to Italian merchants that, by u recent
decision of tho Italian government, any
cargo of maize Imported Into Itnly without
a consular certificate ns to Its quality will
bo rejected by tho health authorities and
Its landing absolutely prevented. Consul
General Branchl, when naked about tho
matter, said: "Oour grain traders havo re
celved during itho past year such a very
mlserablo quality ot corn when they had
every reason to expect a superior grade
that they havo been compelled to resort to
this expedient to insure obtaining better
grades In future."
Walter Minn, tho New York representa
tive of Norton, Swltzer & Co. ot Chicago,
whloh firm Is among tho largest shippers
to foreign countries, said when asked why
this oxtra certificate was demnuded:
"I supposo that the Italian government
considers that Italy Is the only country
which has to put up with tho poor grados
of corn this year, 'in reall'ly the same
state of affaire exists everywhere all over
tho world. Undoubtedly the consul's cer
tificate will guarantee tho receipts In Italy
that the grain Is ns represented on the reg
ular grain Inspection certificate."

NEEDS YOUNG MEN IN MISSIONS
Kilncoial Conference Closes Alter
NetthiK I'ortli DeniiinilH of
tbe t'liureti.
ROCHESTER, N. Y Dec. 7. The Kplsco
pal Missionary conference came to an end
tonight. Thn conference, In tbe opinion of
thoso who aro closest, In touch with It, has
i brought out distinctly tho following things;
First Tbo Episcopal 'church has a pre
eminent call to mission work In Latin
American lands.
Second It sadly needs young men for
mission work, both at homo and nbrnad,
Third Its fctipply of funds for prosecuting
Its poresent nilsslon work nnd for entering
upon Its lurgu opportunities is utterly in
adequate. Fourth The laity, und even somo of the
bishops nnd clorgy, the responsible for the
apathy which prevails throughout the
church toward missions,
Fifth The church at large needs a re
vival, a fresh baptism of tho holy spirit
and systematic Instruction In order that
zcol for missionary work may be aroused,
stimulated and sustained.
Sixth Tho men of tho church should be
systematically organized for tho purpose of
coming to tho aid' of the missionary cadse
and sharing tho burdens which have rested
so long upon tha women nnd children.
There his born no effort In the confer
ence to minimize or gloss over tho diffi
culties and faults.
Xo Time to He .Miserable.
Some one has said that "no one whose
time Is fully occupied has tlmo to be miser
able." That may be so, nnd yet you will
naturally ask: "How Is one to avoid foci
Ing mlserablo when stuffed up with a
cold?" Very easily, wo assure you. You
ha've only to take Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy. It will mnko breathing easier, aid
expectoration, relieve tho lungs and dispel
all symptoms of tho cold nnd the miserable
feeling which accompanies It, This remedy
always cures, and cures quickly. For salo
by all druggists.

LAB0RI KEEPS HIS SECRET
Former llefeniler of Dreyfus llofiisri'
to IMvnlsre Ileal Cnilse
of Itnplnrc.
tAnis nr. T. Thn ceneral exnectatlnn
of sensational disclosures In Maltro Laborl's
explanation of his rupture with Dreyfus
has thus far hcn disappointed, as ne an-
timinr0i llmt hln llnft nrn RPnled hv profes
sional secrecy from telling the story of tho
netual breaking of relations wun tno urey-
rus famiir.
His articles up to now havo taken the
form of a personal polemic against M. M.
Itelnach and Bernard lazare. but they havo
gone to show how wide Is the breach be
tween 'Dreyfus and Rclnach and tno tor
mr'a phnmnlnns The friends of both sides
are pained to read such lette'rs aB Lazarq
writes to .m. i.aoort, in wuicn, naimink 10
reply to certain allusions by thn latter,
ho sars:
"It Is unnecessary for me to help In
throwing down your own statue. You ap
pear qulto able to do tho work yourself,"
Tho anti-Dreyfus press naturally exults
over what It describes as n play 6f dirty
Drcytusard linen and urge M. Laborl.
now that ho has been thrown over by his
ungrntcful friends, to reveal the whole sup
posed Dreyfusard conspiracy against tho
army. On tho other hand M. Ives-Ouyot
lu the Sicclo says tho adversaries of Drey
fus are mlstnl- i It they think that nny
proof ot his guilt will emanate from the
polemics of his former friends, but ho re
peats his prediction thnt tho Dreyfus af
fair will dominate tho elections of 1302, as
it did .those ot 1808.
The accusation of Mnjor Carrlcrc that
governmental pressure hns been put upon
him to plead In favor of tho Innocence of
Dreyfus continues to be discussed, nnd (Icn
cral do Galllffot today again denied nny
part therein nnd cballcogos his nccusors to
