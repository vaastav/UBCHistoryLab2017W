Tlie President's Message.
The Message of President Buchanan which was
read in both Houses of Congress on Tuesday
of last week, is so long that we have not room
to lay it before our readers. Like all of bis
State papers, it proves him to be a clear and
forcible writer, a profound and faresceing
Statesman and pure Patriot. Its sentiments
are entitled to, and doubtless will receive the
unaualified endorsement of every friend of
the Union, North and South. Its language
is temperate, but firm and decided, and is
calculated to allay, instead of increasing the
secession excitement in the South.
After a few appropriate introductory obser
vations, the President at once proceeds to call
the attention of Congress to th e perilous po
sition in which the Union is now placed, and
to lay before them his views with regard to
the right of a Slate to secede from the Con
federacy. He very correctly attributes the
unhappy 6tate of affairs which now exists to
the long continued and intemperate lnterfe
rance of the Northern people, with the ques
tion of slavery in the Southern States, which
has lead to the formation of sectional parties
so much dreaded by the father of his country.
He thinks the impending danger does not ar
ise entirely, from the claim on the part of
Congress or the Territorial Legislatures of
the right to exclude slavery from the territo
ries. He says:
"These evils might have been endured by the
South without danger to the Union, (as . others
have been,) in the hope that time and reflection
might apply the remedy. The immediate peril
arises not so much from these causes as from
the fact that the incessant and violent agitation
of the slavery question throughout the North
for the last quarter of a century, has at lenghth
produced its malign influence on the slaves, and
Inspired them with vague notions of freedom.
Hence a sense of security no longer exists around
the family altar. This feeling of peace at home
has given place to apprehensions of servile in
urrection. Man a matron throughout the
South retires at night in dread of what may be
fall herself and ber children before the morning,
"Should this apprehension of domestic danger
whether real or imaginary, extend and intensify
itself until it shall pervade the masses of the
Southern DeoDle. then disunion will become in.
evitable. Self preservation is the first law of
nature, and has been implanted in the heart of
. man by his Creator for the wisest purpose: and
no political union, however fraught with bles
sings and benefits in all other respects, can long
continue, n the necessary consequence be to ren
der the homes and the firesides of nearly half the
parties to it habitually and hopelessly insecure
booQer or later the bonds of such a L nion must
be severed. It is my conviction that this fatal
period has not yet arrived; and my prayer to
Uod is that tie would preserve the Constitution
and the Union throughout all generations.
"But let us take warning in time, and remove
the cause of danger. It cannot be denied that.
for nve and twenty years, the agitation at the
North against slavery in the South has been in
cessant. In 163o pictorial hand-bills, and in
flammatory appeals, were circulated extensively
throughout the South, of a character to excite
the passions of the slaves; and, in the language
of Oeneral Jackson, "to stimulate them to in
nrrectton, ana produce an tne norrors ot a ser
vile war." This agitation has ever since been
continued by the public press, by the proceed'
logs of State and county conventions, and by
abontion sermons and lectures. The time of
Congress has been occupied in violent speeches
on this never-ending subject: and appeals in
pamphlet and other forms, endorsed by distin
guished names, bare been sent forth from this
central point; and spread broadcast over the
Union.
"How easy would it be for the American peo
ple to settle the slavery question torever, and to
restore peace and harmony to this distracted
country.
They, and they alone can do it. AH that is
necessary to accomplish the object, and all for
which the slave States have ever contended, is to
be let alone, &nd permitted to manage their do
mestic institutions in their own way. As sover
eign States, they, and they alone, are responsi
ble before God and the world for the slavery ex
inting among them. For this, the people of the
North are not more responsible, and have no
more right to interfere, than with similar insti
tutions in Russia or in Brazil!.- -Upon their good
sense and patriotic forbearance I confess I still
greatly rely. Without their aid, it is beyond
the power of any President, no matter what may
be his own political proclivities, to restore peace
and harmony among the States. Wisely limited
and restrained as is his power, under the Consti
tution and laws, he alone can accomplish but lit
tle, for good or for evil, on such a momentous
question."
II tleo eUfet; tbat he doc not regard the
election of any of our LI low citizens to the Pres
idency, as a sufficient cause for dissolving the
Union, and givei his reasons for entertaining
this opinion at considerable length. He
alludes to the faci, that with the exception
of the Missouri Compromise, Congress has
never, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of
the anti-slavery party, passed any law impair
ing the rights of the Southern people to their
property in slaves, and that it is not likely
any such law will be passed by this, or the
succeeding Congress He also alludes to the
decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred
Scott case, that neither Congress or Territo
rial Legislatures possess the right to exclude
slavery from the territories. He is therefore
of the opioion, that the South has nothing to
dread at present from the doctrine on this
subject held by the Black Republican Party,
and that it does not form a sufficient basis on
which to found an effort to dissolve the Un
ion. He says that the most palpable viola
tions of Constitutional duty which have yet
been committed, consist in the acts of various
State Legislatures in the Northern States, to
defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law.
But, for these, neither Congress or the Pres
ident are responsible, and being flagrant vio
lations of the Constitution of the United States
are of course null and void. The fugitive
slave law is founded on a plain provision of
the Constitution, without which it would nev
er have been ratified by the Southern States.
In one form or another, it has existed as the
law of the land, from the days of Washington
to the present moment. It is the duty of the
President to see that it is every where enfor
ced, and the refusal or neglect on bis part to
do so, would be a disregard of the Constitu
tion and laws, to the great injury of nearly
one half of the people of the United States.
But we have no right to presume in advance
that the next President will thus violate his
duty. He entertains strong hopes that the
Sjate Legislatures, will ere long, repeal these
unconstitutional enactments; unless he adds
this shall be done without any unnecessary
delay, it will soon be impossible for any hu
man power to save the Union. The South
ern States standing on the basis of the Con
stitution, have a right to demand this act of
justice from the States of the North, Should
it be refused, then the Constitution to which
all the States are parties, will have been wil
fully violated by one portion of them, in a
provision essential to the domestic security
and happiness of the remainder. In that
event, the iojured States after having first
used all constitutional means to obtain re-
dross, would be justified in revolutionary re
sistance to the government of the Union.
He then proceeds to give his views with re
gard to the doctrine, that any State, whenev
er it ehaii be its sovereign will and pleas
ure, may secede from the Union in accordance
with the Constitution, and without any viola
tion of the Constitutional rights of the other
members of the confederacy He denies the
correctness of this doctrine, and with General
Jackson and Daniel Webster, denies that se
cession is a Constitutional remedy, or that it
is anything more than revolutionary resis
tance to the general government. He denies
that the Federal Government is a mere vol
untary association of States, to be dist-olved
at pleasure by any one of the contracting par
ties; for if this be so, the confederacy is a
rope of sand, to be penetrated and dissolve!
by the first adverse wave of public opinion in
any of the states. Ia this manner our 33
States, may resolve themselves into as many
petty, jarring and hostile republics, each one
retiring from the Union without responsibili
ty, whenever any sudden excitement might
impel them to such a course.
In speaking of the government of the Uni
ted States, he says:
"It was intended to be perpetual, and not to be
annuuea at tne pleasure of any one of the con
tracting parties. The old articles of confedera
tion were eutitled "Articles of Confederation and
Perpetual Union between the States; and by the
13th article it is expressly declared that the
articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably
uusvrvcu uy ctry oiate, ana me union shall be
perpetual." The preamble to the Constitution
of the United States, having express reference to
the articles of Confederation, recites that it was
established "in order to form a more perfect
union." And yet it is contended that this "more
periect union" does not include the essential at
tribute of perpetuity.
"But that the Union was designed to be per-
pciuai jtiws tuuciusiveiy jrom tne nature and
extent of the powers conferred by the Constitu
tion on the Federal Government. These powers
embrace the very highest attributes of national
sovereignty. 1 hey place both the sword and
the purse under its control. Consrrcss has rower
to make war, and to make peace: to raise and
.
support armies anu navies, and to conclude trea
ties with foreign governments. It is invested
with the power to coin money, and to regulate
the value thereof, and to regulate commerce with
foreign nations, and among the several States.
It is not necessary to enumerate the other high
powers which have been conferred upon the Fe
deral Government." In order to carry the enu
merated powers into effect, Congress possesses
the exclusive right to lay and collect duties on
import, and in common with the States to lay
and collect all other taxes.
Many more convincing arguments are ur
ged in support of his position, to which we
-may allude to hereafter. He acknowledge
the right of resistance on the part of the gov
erned, against the oppression of their govern
ments. It exists independently, says the
President, of all Constitutions, and has been
exercised at all periods of the world's history.
It is embodied in strong and express language
in our Declaration of Independence. But
the distinction must ever be observed, that
this is revolution against an established gov
ernment, and not a voluntary secession from
it by Tirtne of an inherent Constitutional
right. Secession is neither more or less.
than revolution. It may, or may not be jus
tifiable rSTolution, bat still it is revolution.
He then proceeds to- the eoiifiiJr&tlou of J,
the following question: --lias the " Constitu
tion delegated to Congress power to coerce a
State into submissicu, which has withdrawn,
or is attempting to withdraw from the con
federacy? He ie of the opinion that ibis pow-
does not cxict for the ftdlowibg reason: ."
"It 13 manifest, upon an inspection of tin Con
stitution, that this is not among the specific and
enumerated powers granted to Congress; and it
is equally apparent that its exercise is not ne
cessary and proper for carrying jinto execution
any one ol tuese powers. - iSo-lar from this power
having been delegated to Congress, it was ex
pressly referred by the Convention which framed
the Constitution. , ..."
'It appears from the proceedings of that body
that ou the 31st May,-1787, the clause "author
izing an exertion of the force of the vhole against
a delinquent State,1 came np lor consideration.
Mr. Madison opposed it in a brief but powerful
speech, from which I shall extract but a sinsle
sentence. He observed: "The use of force
against a State would look more like a declara
tion of war than an infliction of punishment; and
would probabJy be considered by the party at
tacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts
by which it might be bound."' '
"Upon this motion the clause, was unanimous
ly postponed, and was never; I believe, again
presented. Sjon afterwards, on the. 8th June.
1787, when ucidentally adverting-to the subject
he said: "Any Government-' for the United
States, formed on the supposed practicability of
using force against the unconstitutional proceed
ings of the States, would prove as visionary and
fallacious as the government of '- Congress," evi
dently meaning the then existing Congress of the
old Confederation.
"Without descending to particulars, it may
be safely asserted, that the power to make war
against a State is at varience with the whole
spirit and intent of tin Constitution. Suppose
such a war should result in the conquest of a
State, how are we to govern it afterwards? Shall
we hold it as a province, and govern it by des
potic power? . In the nature of things we could
not, by physJcal force, control the will of the
people, and compel them to elect senators and
representatives to Congress, and to perform all
the other duties depending upon their own vio
lation, and required from the free citizens of a
free State as a constituent member of the con
federacy. ,-
"But, if we possessed this power, would it not
be wise to exercise it under existing circumstan
ces? The object would doubtless be to preserve
the Union. War would not only present the
most effectual means of destroying it; but would
banish all hope of its peaceable reconstruction.
Besides, in the fraternal conflict a vast amount
of blood and treasure would be expended, ren
dering future reconciliation between the States
impossible. In the meantime, who can foretel
what would be the sufferings'' and, privations of
tne peopie ounng its existence? ' .
The fact Li, that our Union rests upon public
opinion, and can never b cemented by rhe blood
ot its citizens t-hed in civil war. ; If it cauuot live
in the affections of the people, -it must one day
perish. Congress possess many-means of pre
serving it by conciliation; but the sword was not
placed in their hand to preserve it by force.
After setting forth in eloquent language
the inestimable value of the '. Union, to the
American people, he very truly remarks that
its dissolution ought to be the last desperate
remedy of a despairing people, after every
other Constitutional means of conciliation has
been exhausted.
As a remedy for existing evils, and a means
of restoring tranquility to the country, he
recommends the amendment of. the Constitu
tion in the manner that instrument has point
ed out; he 6ays;
Th explanatory amendment may be confined
to the final settlement of. the true constriction of
the Constitution on three special points:
1. An express recognition of the right of prop
erty in slaves in the States where it now exists
or may hereafter exist. r.
2. The duty of protecting this right in all the
common Territories throughout their territorial
existence, and until they shall be admitted as
Stales into the Union, with or without slavery as
their Constitutions may prescribe.
3. A like recognition of the right of the mas
ter to have his slave, who ef capes from one State
to another, restored and "delivered up" to him,
and of the validity of the Fugitive Slave Law en
acted for this purpose, together with a declara
tion that all State laws impairing or defeating
this right are violations of the Constitution, and
are consequently null and void. :
Our relations with foreign nations are rep
resented as being generally of a highly ami
cable and satisfactory character, and the
American flag is everywhere 'respected. He
recommends a modification of the tariff du
ring the present Session of Congress, for the
purpose of increasing the revenue, and is in
favor of imposing specific instead of ad valo
rum duties on imported articles, . whenever
these can be applied. In this hasty abstract
we have omitted several important features in
the message, to which we will probably allude
next week. In conclusion,. we have only to
say, that it contains nothing which we do not
fully endorse, or that is not sound democratic
doctrine.
Tne Censu.s s
It appears from the returns of the Census
published in the City papers, that the popula
tion of this State now is 2,913,041; almost
equal to that of the entire nation at the time
of the Declaration of Independence'. In 1850
it was 2,311,776; 601,265 of an increase in

", The Union SHU In Danger.
The .iiews which we daily receive from
Wathioctou City, id of the most discouraging
and alarming character. The intelligence re
ceived there from the South, indicate that the
Secession movement is fast gaining ground
and that the people of Georgia and Alabama
are now almost as enthusiastic in the cause as
those of South Carolina. A bad state of feel
ing exists at . the Capitol. The Republican
members seem determined to stand firm, and
not to yield an inch in order to save the Union.
They still adhere to theii irrepressible con
flict doctrine, and on the principal that
might is right, are endeavoring to make the
Southern people their underlings and vassals,
because they think they possess the power to
do so. The Southern idtraists also, bluster
and talk fierce, so tnat between the two, it is
impossible for conservative men to obtain even
a respectful hearing. The most sanguine
friends of the Union ars beginning to dispair,
while iu enemies are becoming proportionate
ly elated. If anything is to be done for its
preservation, it must be done quickly.
S3T "Glad to see you Mr. Editor," said
Mordecai, as he seated himself by our side in
the court room one day last week "what's
the news? . Do you really think they are go
ing to dissolve the Union? "Dont talk so
loud Mordecai" we replied; Andy Lewis, the
Court Crier , is shakink his head menacingly at
ns " "Well I wont talk loud any more Mr.
Editor," said Mordecai. "That's right Mor
decai," we replied, "and as you have now re
covered breath, tell me how are all the folks
at Monkbarns; and especially bow is old Jon
athon, young Jonathoi and the pretty School
Mistress. "All well," replied Mordecai
'especially the pretty School Mistress, and I
trust in heaven she may ever be so." "Why
Mordecai" said we "it is an extraordinary
thing to hear an oil bachelor like you, speak
so enthusiastically of a young girl of sixteen
or eighteen, for I suppose that is about her
age, from what you have told me. She must
be a divine creature indeed to excite so much
enthusaism in her favor in your old breast."
That's so Mr. Editor" rejoined Mordecai,
"She is a divine creature, and nothing else
For beauty, she has no superior I am certain
in the world; and then she is so sweet, so
gentle and condescending in her loveliness.
She is not a creature of the enthusiastic ro
mancer's imagination, but a being made to be
loved by all young and old; for her face is
but a mirror which reflects the beauty of the
soul within." "Why Mordecai" we replied,
"yoa interest me very much; can't you give
me a brief description of her charms." "No,
Mr. Editor, replied Mordecai, "that is impos
sible. But I will endeavor to do the best I
can. Well then, Mr. Editor, her form is
faultless; her cheeks rival the bloom of the
fall blown rose; her teeth are of pearly white
ness; her lips but I won't attemt their des
cription and her eyes Mr. Editor; I wish you
to live and die happy, and I therefore hope you
may never encounter their gaze. Rut to fin
ish the description, her foot to judge from
seeing it only once slyly peeping from beneath
her hoops, is small, very small, and her voice
like that of Miss Annie Laurie, about whom
you sometimes sing, is low and sweet. "And
Mordecai, we replied, if your description be
correct, a great many of the young gentlemen
around Monkbarns doubtless can truly ex
claim in the words of the song from which you
have jast quoted; "She's all the world to me."
But Mordecai, I think at your time of life,
your mind should be the chronicler of more
serious thoughts, than those called up by ga
zing on a young girl, fair though she be.
In a word, you should fix your thoughts'
less on this world, and more on Heaven."
"3Ir. Editor", replied Mordecai, "I don't
pretend to be a devout man, but if I were,
I would not think that I was committing a
crime, or offendiog my Creator, by admiring
in the right spirit, this beautiful work
of his hands. In admiring the the creature
I would feel that I was honoring the Creator.
Why has our Creator made any of his crea
tures beautiful and fair to gaze upon; or why do
the ocean, the majestic mountain, the thunder
storm, excite in ourbreasts emotions of admir
ation of sublimity and awe? Because they
tell of the surpassing beauty and power and
majesty of Him who created tbem, and are
therefore intended to arouse the true spirit of
Divine Love in our breasts. Thus a truly de
vout man while gazing on a beautiful natural
object, whether animate or inanimate, would
naturally ask himself if the creature be so
beautiful, what must the Creator be? and at
once be lost in wonder, love, adoration and
praise. I therefore, Mr. Editor, think that
if I were all you say I should be, I would be
committing no offence in admiring tho charms
of the pretty School Mistress." "I believe
vou are right Mordecai," we replied, and one
of the sublimest of our English Poeis, doubt
less entertained similar thoughts when he ex
claimed; "How wonderful, how intricate is man,
How passing wonder He who made him such"
"That is doubtless very sublime Mr. Edi
tor, said Mordecai, but to return to the pret
ty schoolmistress She is as good as she is
fair. By special invitation, I called . around
the other day, to see her in her schoolroom.
I found her the oentre of what might be cal
led a happy family, for all her pupils love her.
I never until then believed, that it was far
better and easier to rule by love than fear.
I wish Mr. Editor you could behold her in
that schoolroom, ruling with the wand'of love
that youthful group, many of whom are often
so rude, insolent and boisterous, even beneath
the gaze of their parents. You would then
agree with nr. that he will be a happy man
w.hosbail be permitted to callJierwiiV; tbatj
they mux Xyn happy cbndreu nw t-tiali cll u r
mother. But I weary you with ibis ltg
conversation. Who is that lady who now oc
cupies the witnesses chair ? "That Mordecai,
we answered "is Josephine Bassett." ''Weil,
he's a glib talker and a euiart woman any
how," said Mordecai. She's been to College ;
that's certain "Where does she reside, and
what does she do for a living?" "I know noth
ing about Ler Mordecai" we replied. "She is
now giving her testimony in a conspiracy case.
Suppose we step np to Wissel'a and get some
small beer ?" "Agreed. Mr. Editor, said
Mordecai, after this long chat a little, won't
hurt us."
Court Proceedings.
A large amount of business was transacted
in the Quarter Sessions last week. Tha
grand Jury were not discharged until Satur
day morning Of the many cases disposed of,
few were of an important character. We
therefore notice only the following :
Commonwealth, vs. Francis Kable et o.
Indictment for conspiracy. Josephine Bas
sctt. Prosecutor. Verdict, cot guilty.
Commonwealth, vs, Francis Kable. In
dictment, keeping a gambling bouse in Johns
town. Verdict, Guilty. . Sentenced to pay
costs and a fine of 50 and imprisonment in
the County Jail for 2 months.
Commonwealth, vs, Josephine Bassctt.
Indictaaent for Adultery. Verdict, Not guil
ty, but that she pay the costs.
Commonwealth vs John Lee alias John
Leahy. Indictment for Murder. This case
was taken np on Friday evening. The In
dictment charges the defendant with murder
ing Charles Watkins, in Johnstown, on the
29th of September. It appealed from the
evidence, that a Republican meeting had
been going on the night the fatal event occur
red, and that the deceased was a member of
the Johnstown "wide-awake club." At
about midnight he met near Wood Morrel!
&co's Store defendant and several other per
sons, and commenced quarreling and fighting
with ;hem. He was soon jointd by several
friends, who endeavored to take him home
A few moments after an encounter with the
defendant, he was struck on the left temple
with a stone fracturing the temporal bone,
and causing death the next day. The Com
monwealth failed in proviug, that the stone
was thrown by the defendant, or even by anv
of his party, as there were persons standiug
ou the opposite side of the canal at the time.
The jury after retiring a few moments ren
dered a verdict of Not Guilty.

is entitled to a sbaro of the spoils, now that
it has them to dispense. Bat ten to one, be
