ner stone, which Is combined with the
dedication of the building, and the for
mal opening of 'the new session of the
Reichstag.
Immense crowds of people were gath
ered along the route and outside of .the
new building and cheered the Emperor
and the German reigning Princes on
their way there and upon their arrival.
Prince Hohenlohe, the Chancellor,, and
Field Marsnal Ulumenthal, Chief of the
General Staff of the Prussian Army, Is
about eighty-four years old, were ac
corded an especially warm welcome
from the people. '
The sew Reichstag building, a monu
mental structyre, has taken over ten
years to build. . , .
On June 9. 1634, the foundation was
laid by Emperor William In the pres
ence of nearly all the German Princes
and rulers. . .
Since that time the chief architect, Paul
Wallet, and scores of assistants, scu.p
tors, painters, carvers and artisans from
every part of Germany have been busy
oa the structure, and now Jt is being de
dicated to its proper use. Yet It is not
by any means complete and (lnltfted In
all Its details. Among the more note
worthy objects It stl.l lacks are the great
Ulsmarck statue, to be placed In the
west frontage; the two gigantic heralds,
to be placed on the east frontage, and the
outer decorative surroundings, which,
with the complete clearing of the square
arourM the building, will take years.
It stands on the east side of the Koe-nlg-Platz,
a stone's throw from the Col
umn of Victory, and covers 11,638
square meters. It has cost 28,700,000
marks to build and equip, of which 18.
000,000 only were asked for under the
first estimate.
As to the style of architecture It Is a
special creation of the architect, belong
ing strictly to no school at all. The
building Is quadrangular, flanked by four
turrets, and bears In the centre part of
its roof a cupola made of gilt wrought
Iron.

Andrews's "Vindication" tho Sub
ject of Much Comment
Tenderloin Bods Again In Evidence,
Reaily to Testify.
Street Cleaning Commissioner An
drews's vindication of his ofuctal charac
ter as President of the Excise Board,
which he presented to the Senate In
vestigating Committee yesterday with
the able assistance of Mr. Goff, was the
sole topic of conversation this morning
among the throng that gathered at the
Lexow headquarters In the Court-House
this morning.
It was likened to the vindication
which Civil Justice George F. Roesch
Insisted upon and obtained when he felt
that his character had been aspersed
by Mrs. Augusta Thurow early In the
Investigation. Like Justice Roesch,
Commissioner Andrews, when it was all
over, probably wished that he hadn't,
for when Mr. Goff finished with him In
the hot wind-up last evening, his gen
eral appearance suggested the condition
of a man who had been suddenly and
unexpectedly overtaken by a Kansas
cyclone.
No Evidence that lie Wasn't llrlbed.
Although he denied very solemnly .that
his action as an Excise Commissioner
had ever been Influenced by money con
siderations, Mr. Goff told him very plain
ly that he had not produced the slightest
evidence to prove that ho had not been
paid tS00to grant a license to Mme.
Chaude's notorious resort, the Malson
Tortonl, as his former friend, ex-Chief
Inspector Tomllnson, had testified, but
that the whole record was against him
on this particular Issue.
That he regarded his vindication as
sufficient was shown by the fact that
he kept away from the Committee this
morning. All the other witnesses, how
ever, who have been In waiting for the
last two days were on hand early, among
them being the little bevy of faded beau
ties of the Tenderloin.. There were also
a number of tired and dejected-looking
Frenchmen, who, it is said, will be asked
to tell the Committee what they know
about the protection afforded by the po
lice at the annual public balls of the
French cooks and other social organiza
tions, where open violations of the Ex
cise law and other Irregularities have
been notortopsly permitted.

Father Ducey arrived not long after

for a moment In uncertainty, as he
pulled off his gloves. Mrs. Grannls,
catching a glimpse of him, at once arose
and moved to a seat further back, but
Father Ducey chivalrously begged her
not to disturb herself, and gallantly es

showed symptoms of strlchnlne poison

features are enshrouded in mystery.
The man waa about sixty years old.
He entered the lodging-house shortly

MR.FELLOWSDEFIANT
His Attorney Declines to Produoo
Untried Indiotments.
Commissioner Linson Orders the
Disputed Papers Sent in.
Merchants Who Could Not Get
Criminals Irled.
There Is a growing Impression that
District-Attorney Fellows, by frequent
abscense, Is endeavoring to convince
Commissioner Linson that he Is a very
busy man.
It Is rumored that the German-American
Reform Union nttornejs will meet
Col Fellows's defense by bringing wit
nesses who have seen him getting
around to his ofllce shortly before noon
each day.
Before the hearing was begun this
morning, Chief Clerk Nuger said that
the aggregate amount of ball In the
thirteen cases In which Charles L
Jaehne had been accepted as surety Is
111,600, Irstead of 110,000, as stated yes
terday. Referring to the effort of Mr. Phillip
to show that the District-Attorney had
been remiss In accepting Peter De
lacey, the bookmaker, as bondsman,
Mr. Nuger emarked:
"Why, Chauncey M. Depew hits been
charged with misdemeanor, and the
Rockefedders are under Indictment, bo
you see It would be unfair to refuse to
accept as bondsmen men who have
been accused."
Attorney Phillips said: "We have
shown that 350 Indictments were not
brought to trial during the year, and
we expect to unearth a great many
more."
When the Commissioner arrived, Mr.
Phillips asked for a ruling on his mo
tion to have the specifications amended.
Commissioner Linson decided that the
specifications could be amended to In
clude the case of George Murray, the
pickpocket, and Frederick C. Gedney,
ex-President of the North River Bank.
Mr. McCurdy protested In vain.
Frederick Hoffman, a Mercer street
furrier, whose watch was stolen on Feb.
2G, and who had Murray arrested on the
charge of being the thief, swore that he
Identified Murray as the thief, and after
calling on Col. Townso-, the Assistant
District - Attorney, so n times. Mr.
Townsend said. "Why, ou can't Identify
that man. He Isn't the thief, and there
Is no use trying the case."
Mr. Hoffmann responded to him: "Col.
TOwnsend, there Is a nigger In the
fence."
Townsend brought out several pic
tures and first snowed hlmmone that
"looked like that man," said the wit
ness, pointing at the stenographer.
"That made me mad," went on Mr.
Hoffmann, "so thay brought out the pic
ture of Murray and I told them he was
the thief." -
"How were you treated," asked Mr.
Phillips.
"Col. Townsend acted very I can't
think of a word," remarked the wit
ness, "very, very mean, I'll say. He
told me to go away, and I haven't been
back since.
Henry J. Schloss, of N. J. Schloss &
Co , clothing manufacturers, who were
defrauded out of 1125,000 by their book
keeper, Joseph H. Louis, testified to the
difficulties he met to have Louis tried,
lie said that because of his failure to
have the case taken up his business
suffered.
Chief Clerk Unger was recalled and
acked for certain copies of records to
produce to-day. The most Important of
these records waa the number of Indict
ments pending and untried on Dec. 1,
1891.
"I have been unable to prepare the
list' he said, "because of lack of time."
"Did not Col. Fellows Instruct you to
not prepare such a Hat?"
"No, sir."
"Will you prepare such a list?"
Mr. Unger started to say he would
when Mr. McCurdy conveyed Col. Fel
lows's defiance by saying:
"Under my direction witness says no."
"I so say,1' said Mr. Mlzer, meekly.
The Ccmmlsiloner Instructed Mr. Unger
to prepare the Information and produce

Clustered about Miss Klaprath were a

their leader, all are armed, and will re

Miss Klaprath owns about three-quarters
of the property on Johnson avenue,

Think of the Board of Health Ofllce
In Such Condition.
The Board ot Police Commissioners,
acconpanled by Supt. Byrnes, made an
Inspection recently of the rooms at
rollce Headquarters recently vacated
by the Board of Health. They are on
the second and third floors on the Mott
street side. They were oocupled many
years by the Board of Health. Two
months ago the rooms were vacated,
and Commissioner Kerwln has been
quietly making a personal Investigation.
What he saw, the Commissioner con
fesses, was a startling revelation.
"To put It mildly," said the Commis
sioner to an "Evening World" repor
ter, "I was shocked. The most com
plimentary thing I can say Is that It la
unfit for police purposes. If the same
conditions existed In any other building
In New York the Board of Health would
order the place vacated or be guilty of
neglect of duty.
"The rooms reek with filth. I doubt If
they have been thoroughly cleansed In
years Tho building as a whole Is open
to condemnation, not only from a sani
tary point, but for other reasons. The
plumbing Is bad. There are draughts
from air quarters, which. I have been
Informed, were responsible for the death
ot a number of officers detailed to special
duty In the long, tunnel-like hallway
on the floor. The room are tit only for
dogs to live In.
"I would be In favor of vacating the
building. I am satisfied It will not be
long before Police Headquarters will be
moved to a more central location. At all
events the building must be remodelled
to make It safe for occupancy."
Commissioner Kerwln will lay the re
sults of his Investigation before the full
Board.

HOW A "" FEELS
Elevator Man Mo&uliffe Tell All
About tbe Thing.
He Rescued Girls from a Burning
Broadway Building.
Ran His Elevator "through Flames
and Smoke to Safety. '
1 i
A big man with a blue Jumper and
clothes which were what Is known In
the dramatic profession as "up stage"
stood on a pile of cinders In front of 517
Broadway this morning, and with tbe
gesticulations of a born orator described
tn a group of people and shop girls how
the fire of last night broke out and how
the girls were rescued from the top
floor.
People stopped and listened. They had
heard of the bravery of Dennis McAu
llffe, the freight elevator man, and they
thought the man with the blue Jumper
and the wonderful flow of language was
the hero of yesterday. He wasn't. He
didn't amount to anything. He was only
working up a little halo for himself.
McAullffe, the man who really did In
the excitement and alarm of the fire
yesterday a brave and heroic act, was
standing off by himself to one side, and
It didn't seem as If any one paid any at
tention to him. Ills clothes, which had
been ruined yesterday, still showed
traces of the cinders, and after what he
had gone through he wasn't feeling par
ticularly fit this morning.
He certainly wasn't In a talking mood.
He is one of those men who believe that
actions count, not words. He Is a well
built man, with a square Jaw that shows
etrength of mind and determination.
McAullffe was not standing around
waiting for thanks this morning. He
was speculating on how long he would
be out of work, for he has a wife and
five children to look after.
"How did you get those girls downT'
asked a curious young man.
McAullffe didn't produce a halo or go
Into a detailed description of his bravery.
He kept on stuffing the tobacco In his
pine, as he replied:
'Got 'em down on the elevator. How
fell did you think I got 'em downT"
"I didn't know," went on the young
man, "but I thought perhapi there would
be a lot for you to talk about. You're a
hero, now, ou know."
'"Te:i with the hero business. I'm
thinking how long It wltl be before I get
to work again. I don't want to be laid
off no month." ....
"What made you think of running the
freight elevatorr' . , ,
McAullfte's face took on a look ot
"What have 1 got this on my shoulders
fort" pointing at his head. "The passen
ger elevator wis stopped and my eleva
tor was running. 8o 1 yelled to the en
gineer to put on full steam and keep It
up. I went up to the top floor and found
the girls all half crazy. They were los
ing their heads-and their hats, too.
Some was crying, some yelling, but the
most of them was praj Ing They piled
on to the elevator until ft waa full Then
I run her down and came back after an
other load.
"The fourth time I didn't see any
body left, so I yelled out 'Anybody up
herer There was no answer, and 1
didn't ' anything but a cat, and I
started down for the last time. But the
cat wasn't going tn be left, and she
Jumped. She's djwn In the cellar now,
and I guess she'll Jlv."

realize that ho acted like a brave man.

SCRAMBLED TO BUY. SUGAR.
Trust Stook Bid Up Two Points
on Washington News,
Coalers, Grangers and the General
Lltt Wat Weaker.
There was a regular rush to buy Sugar
at theQpenlng on.the news from Wash
ington that-ttie-Democralic Senators bad
failed to agree to pats the 'Anti-Trust
measure at their caucus yesterday.
The shorts were thoroughly alarmed,
and In their anxiety to cover, bid the
price up on themselves. As soon as the
gong sounded at the Stock Exchange the
Immenso crowd which had gathered
around the Sugar post bid frantically
for large blocks ot the stock.
Bales were road simultaneously at
from 84 to 84 1-2, against a closing last
night of 85 1-4, and In a very few
moents 87 1-4 was bid.
The dealings were attended with con
siderable exclttment. After this flurry
the brokers stopped to think, and It
dawned upon many that the directors of
the Trust, who are to meet this after
noon, might make a big cut in the divi
dend. ,
The upward movement bolted and
under big 6fferlngs the stock sold down
to 86 1-4, but later rallied to 87 1-4.
Chicago Gas was a prominent feature,
rising rapidly from 71 to 7S. The Jump
was due almost entirely to purchasers
to cover Shorts. The general market
was weaker, especially tor the Grangers
