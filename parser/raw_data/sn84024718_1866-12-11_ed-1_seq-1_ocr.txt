In Memoriam.
Prentice ofthe Louisville Journal thus speaks

most wish to die, if he knew that so beautiful a
tribute as this would be written to his ineinorj'."
On the bosom ofthe river
Where the sun unloosed his quiver,
Where the starlight streamed forever,
Sailed a vessel light and free;
Morning dew-drops hung like manna,
On the bright folds of her banner,
While the zephyrs rose to fan her
Softly to the radiant sea.
At her prow a pilot bearnifig
In the flush of youth stooadrcaming,
And he was in glorious seeming,
Like an angel from above;
Through his hair the breezes sported.
And as on the wave he floated
Oft that pilot, angel throated,,
Warbled lays of hope and love.
Through those locks so brightly flowing,
Buds of iaurel bloom were blowing,
And his hands anon were throwing
Music from a lyre of gold ;
Swifter down the stream he glided,
Soft the purple Avaves divided,
And a rainbow arch abided
On his canvas' snowy fold.
Anxious hearts with fond devotion,
Watched him sailing to the ocean,
Prayed that no wild commotion
'Midst the elements might rise;
And he seemed some young Apollo,
Charming summer winds to follow,
While the water flags corolla
Trembled to his music sighs.
But these purple waves enchanted,
Rolled beside a city haunted
By an awful spell, that daunted
Every comer to her shore;
Night shades rank tho ai? encumbered,
And pale marble statue;, numbered,
Awoke to life no more.
Then there rushed with lightning quickness,
O'er his face a mortal sickness,
And the dews in fearful thickness
Gathered o'er his temples fair,
And there swept a dying murmur
Through the lively Southern summer
As the beauteous pilot comer
Perished by that city there.
Still rolls on that radiant river,
And the sun unbinds his quiver
O'er the starlight streams forever
On its bosom as before,
But that vessel's rainbow banner
Greets no more the gay savanna
And that pilot's lute drops manna
On the purple waves no more.
MESSAGE
OF TIIE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
TO THE
TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS
AT THE
Commencement of the Second Session.
Fellow-citizens of the Senate and
House of Representatives :
After a brief interval the Congress of the
United States resumes its annual legislative la
bors. An All-wise and Merciful Providence
has abated the pestilence which visited our
shores, leaving its calamitous traces upon some
portions of our country. Peace, order, tran
quility and civil authority have been formally
declared to exist throughout the whole of the i
United States. In all the States civil authority
has superseded the coercion of arms, and the
people, by their voluntary action, are maintain
ing their governments in full activity and com
plete operation. The enforcement of the laws
is no longer "obstructed in any State by combi
nations too powerful to be suppressed by the
ordinary course of judicial proceedings;" and
the animosities engendered by the war are rap
idly yielding to the beneficent influences of our
free institutions, and to the kindly effects of un
restricted social and commercial intercourse. —
An entire restoration of fraternal feeling must
be the earnest wish of every patriotic heart;
and we will accomplish our grandest national
achievement when, forgetting the sad events of
the past, and remembering only their instruc
tive lessons, we resume our onward career as a
free, prosperous, and united people.
RECONSTRUCTION.
In my Message of the 4th of December, 1865,
Congress was informed of the measures which
had been instituted by the Executive with a
view to the gradual restoration of the States in
which the insurrection occurred to their rela
tions with the General Government. Provis
ional Governors had been appointed, Conven
tions called, Governors elected, Legislatures as
sembled, and Senators arid Representatives
chosen to the Congress ofthe United States. —
Courts had been opened for the enforcement of
laws long in abeyance. The blockade had been
removed, custom-houses re-established, and the
internal revenue laws put in force, in order that
the people might contribute to the national in
come. Postal operations had been renewed,
and efforts were being made to restore them to
their former condition of efficiency. The States
themselves had been asked to take part in the
high function of amending the Constitution,
and of thus sanctioning tbe extinction of Afri
can slavery as one of the legitimate results of
our internecine struggle. •
Having progressed thus far, the Executive
Department found that it had accomplished
nearly all that was within the scope of its con
stitutional authority. One thing, however, yet
remained to be done before the work of restora
tion could be completed, and that was the ad
mission to Congress of'loyal Senators and Rep
resentatives from the States whose people had
rebelled against the lawful authority of the Gen
eral Government. This question devolved upon
the respective Houses, which, by the Constitu
tion, are made the judges of the elections, re
turns, and qualifications of their own members;
and its consideration at once engaged the atten
tion of Congress.
EXECUTIVE EFFORTS.
In the meantime, the Executive Department
—no other plan having been proposed by Con
gress —continued its efforts to perfect, as far as
was practicable, the restoration of the proper
relations between the citizens of the respective
States, the States, and the Federal Government,
extending, from time to time, as the public in
terests seemed to require, tbe judicial, revenue,
and postal systems of the country. With the
advice and consent of the Senate, the necessary
officers were appointed, and appropriations
made by Congress for the payment of their sal
aries. The proposition to amend the Federal
Constitution, so as to prevent the existence of
slavery within the United States or any place
subject to their jurisdiction, was ratified by the
requisite number of States; and on the 18th
day of December, 1865, it was officially declared
to have become valid as a part of the Constitu
tion of the United States. All of the States in
which the insurrection had existed promptly
amended their constitutions, so as to make them
conform to the great change thus effected in the
organic law of the land ; declared null and void
all-rdinances and laws of secession; repudiated
all pretended debts and obligations created for
the revolutionary purposes ofthe insurrection ;
and proceeded, in good faith, to the enactment
of measures for the protection aud amelioration
of the condition of the colored race. Congress,
however, yet hesitated to admit any of these
States to representation ; and it was not until
towards the close of the eighth month of the
session that an exception was made in favor of
Tennessee, by the admission of her Senators
and Representatives.
IMPORTANCE OF ADMISSION OF SOUTHERN REP
RESENTATIVES.
I deem it a subject of profound regret that
Congress has thus far failed to admit to seats
STAUNTON, VA., TUESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1866.
loyal Senators and Representatives from the
other States, whose inhabitants, with those of
Tennessee, had engaged in the rebellion. Ten
States—more than one-fourth ofthe whole num
ber —remain without representation ; the seats
of fifty members in the House of Representa
tives and of twenty members in the Senate are
yet vacant —not by their own consent, not by a
failure of election, but by the refusal _of Con
gress to accept their credentials. Their admis
sion, it is believed, would have accomplished
much towards the renewal and strengthening of
our relations as one people, and removed seri
ous cause for discontent on the part of the in
habitants of those States. It would have ac
corded with the great principle enunciated in
the Declaration of American Independence,
that no people ought to bear the burden of tax
ation, and yet be denied the right of represen
tation. It would have been in consonance with
the express provisions ofthe Constitution, that
"each State shall have at least one Representa
tive," and "that no State, without its consent,
shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the
Senate." These provisions were intended to
secure to every State, and to the people of ev
ery State, the right of representation iii each
House of Congress; and so important was it
deemed by the framers ofthe Constitution that
the equality of the States in the Senate should
be preserved, that not even by an amendment
of the Constitution can any State, without its
consent, be denied a voice in that branch ofthe
National Legislature.
SOUTHERN STATES STILL IN THE UNION.
It is true, it has been assumed that the exist
ence ofthe States was terminated by the rebel
lious acts of their inhabitants, and that the in
surrection having been suppressed, they were
thenceforward to be considered merely as con
quered territories. The Legislative, Executive,
"and Judicial Departments of the Government
have, however, with great distinctness and uni
form consistency, refused to sanction an assump
tion so incompatible with the nature of our re
publican system, and with the professed objects
of the war. Throughout the recent legislation
of Congress the undeniable fact makes itself ap
parent, that these ten political communities are
nothing less than States of this Union. At the
very commencement ofthe rebellion each House
declared, with a unanimity as remarkable as it
was significant, that the war was not "waged,
on our part, in any spirit of oppression, nor for
any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor
purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the
rights or established institutions of those States,
but to defend and maintain the supremacy of
the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance
thereof, and to preserve the Union with all the
dignity, equality, and rights ofthe several States
unimpaired ; and that as soon as these objects"
were "accomplished the war ought to cease."
In some instances, Senators were permitted to
continue their legislative functions, while in
other instances Representatives were elected
and admitted to seats after their States had
formally declared their right to withdraw from
the Union, and-were endeavoring to maintain
that right by force. All of the States whose
people were in insurrection as States were in
cluded in the apportionment of the direct tax of
twenty millions of dollars annually laid upon tbe
United States by the act approved sth August,
1861. Congress, by the act of March 4, 18G2,
and by the apportionment of representation
thereunder, also recognized their presence as
States in the Union ; and they have, for judicial
purposes, been divided into districts, as States
alone can be divided. recognition ap
pears in the recent legislation in reference to
Tennessee, which evidently rests upon the fact
that the functions ofthe State were not destroy
ed by the rebellion, but merely suspended ; and
that principle is of course applicable to those
States which, like Tennessee, attempted to re
nounce their places in the Union.
The action of the Executive Department of
the Government upon this subject has been
equally definite and uniform, and the purpose
of the war was specifically stated in the Procla
mation issued by my predecessor on the 22d day
of September, 1862. It was then solemnly pro
claimed and declared that "hereafter, as here
tofore, the war will be prosecuted for the object
of practically restoring the constitutional rela
tion between the United States and each of the
States and the people thereof, in which States
that relation is or may be suspended or disturb
ed."
The recognition of the States by the Judicial
Department of the Government has also been
clear and conclusive in all proceedings affecting
them as States, had in the Supreme, Circuit,
and District Courts.
In the admission of Senators and Represent
atives from any and all of the States, there can
be no just ground of apprehension that persons
who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers
of legislation ; for this could not happon w_ien
the Constitution and the laws are enforced by a
vigilant and faithful Congress. Each House is
made the "judge ofthe elections, returns, and
qualifications of its own members," and may,
"with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a
member." When a Senator or Representative
presents bis certificate of election, he may at
once be admitted or rejected ; or, should there
be any question as to his eligibility, his creden
tials may be referred for investigation to the
appropriate committee. If admitted to a seat,
it must be upon evidence satisfactory to the
House of which he thus becomes a member,
that he possesses the requisite constitutional
and legal qualifications. If refused admission
as a member for want of due allegiance to the
Government, and returned to his constituents,
they arc admonished that none but persons loy
al to the United States will be allowed a voice
in the legislative councils ofthe nation, and the
political power and moral influence of Congress
are thus effectively exerted in the interests of
loyalty to the Government and fidelity to the
Union. Upon this question, so vitally affecting
the restoration of the Union and the permanen
cy of our present form of government, my con
victions, heretofore expressed, have undergone
no change; but, on the contrary, their correct
ness has been confirmed by reflection and time.
If the admission of loyal members to seats in
the respective Houses of Congress was wise and
expedient a year ago,_ it is no less wise and ex
pedient now. If this anomalous condition is
right now —if, in the exact condition of these
States at the present time, it is lawful to exclude
them from representation, I do not see that the
question will be changed by the efflux of time.
Ten years hence, if these States remain as they
are, the right of representation will be no strong
er —tbe right of'exclusion will be no weaker.
DUTY OF TIIE EXECUTIVE.
The Constitution of the United States makes
it the duty of the President to recommend to
the consideration of Congress "such measures
as he shall judge necessary or expedient.'' I
know of no mcasuro.more imperatively demand
ed by every consideration of national interest,
sound policy, and equal justice, than the admis
sion of loyal members from the unrepresented
States. This would consummate the work of
restoration, and exert a most salutary influence
in the re-establishment of peace, harmony, and
fraternal feeling. It would tend greatly to re
new the confidence of the American people in
the vigor and stability of their institutions. It
would bind us more closely together as a nation,
and enable us to show to the worldjhe inherent
and recuperative power ofa Government found
ed upon tlmwill ofthe people, and established
upon the principles of liberty, justice, and in
telligence. Our increased strength and enhan
ced would irrefragably demonstrate
the fallacy of the arguments against free institu
tions drawn from our recent national disorders
by the enemies of republican government. The
admission of loyal members from the States now
excluded from Congress, by allaying doubt and
apprehension, would turn capital, now-awaiting
an opportunity for investment, into the channels
of trade and industry. It would alleviate the
present troubled condition of those States, and,
by inducing emigration, aid in the settlement of
fertile regions now uncultivated, and lead to an
increased production of those staples which have
added so greatly to the wealth ofthe nation and
the commerce ofthe world. New fields of en
terprises would bo opened to our progressive
Eeoplc, and soon the devastations of war would
c repaired, and all traces of our domestic dif
ferences effaced from the minds of our country
men.
CONSOLIDATION TO BE AVOIDED.
our efforts to preserve "the unity of Gov
ernment which constitutes us one people," by
restoring the States to the condition which they
held prior to the rebellion, we shoffld be cau
tious, lest, having rescued our nation from per
ils of threatened disintegration,.?- resort to
consolidation, and in the end absolute depotism,
as a remedy for the recurrence of similar trou
bles. The war having terminated, and with it
all occasion for the exercise of powers of doubt
ful constitutionality, we should hasten to bring
legislation within the boundaries prescribed by
the Constitution, and to return to the ancient
landmarks established by our fathers for the
guidance pf succeeding generations. ' 'The Con
stitution which at any time exists, until changed
by an explicit and authentic act of the whole
people, is sacredly obligatory upon all." "If,
in the opinion of the people, the distribution or
modification ofthe constitutional powers be, in
any particular, Wrong, let it be corrected by an
amendment in the way in which the Constitu
tion designates. But let there be no change by
usurpation ; lor" "it is the customary weapon
by which free Governments are destroyed."—
Washington spoke these words to his country
men, when, followed by their love and gratitude,
he voluntarily retired from the cares of public
life. "To keep in all things within the pale of
our constitutional powers, and cherish the Fed
eral Union as the only rock of safety," were
prescribed by Jefferson as rules of action to en
dear to his "countrymen tho true principles of
their Constitution, and promote a union of sen
timent and action equally auspicious to their
happiness and safety." Jackson held that the
action of the General Government should al
ways be strictly confined to the sphere of its ap
propriate duties, and justly and forcibly urged
that our Government is not to be maintained
nor our Union preserved "by invasions of the
rights and powers of the several States. In
thus attempting to make our General Govern
ment strong we make it weak. Its true strength
consists in leaving individuals and States as
much as possible to themselves; in making it
self felt, not in its power, but in its beneficence ;
not in its control, but in its protection ; not in
binding the States more closely to the centre,
but leaving each to move unobstructed in its
proper constitutional orbit." These are the
teachings of men whose deeds and services have
made them illustrious, and who, long since
withdrawn from the scenes of life, have left to
their country the rich legacy of their example,
their wisdom, and their patriotism. Drawing
fresh inspiration from their lessons, let us emu
late them in love of country and respect for the
Constitution and the laws.
REPORT OF SECRETARY OF TREASURY.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
affords much information respecting the revenue
and commerce of the country. His views upon
the currency, and with reference to a proper ad
justment of our revenue system, internal as well
as impost, are commended to the careful consi
deration of Congress. In my last Annual Mes
sage I expressed my general views upon these
subjects. I need now only call attention to the
necessity of carrying into every of
the Government a system of rigid rlccountabili
ty, thorough retrenchment, and wise economy.
With no exceptional nor unusual expenditures,
the oppressive burdens of taxation can be les
sened by such a modification of our revenue
laws as will be consistent with the public faith,
and the legitimate and necessary wants of the
Government.
The report presents a much more satisfactory
candition of our finances than one year ago the
most sanguine could have anticipated. During
the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1865,
the last year of the war, the public debt was in
creased $..11,902,537, and on the 31st of Octo
ber, 1865-j it amounted to $2,740,854,537, and
on the 31st day of October, 1866,- it had been
reduced to $2,551,310,066, the diminution, du
ring a period of fourteen months, commencing
September Ist, 1865, and ending October 31,
1866, having been $206,379,565. In the last
annual report on the state of the finances, it
was estimated that during the three quarters of
the fiscal year ending the 30th of June last, the
debt would be increased $112,194,947. During
that period, however, it was reduced $31,196,-
-386, the receipts ofthe year having been $89,-
-905,905 more, and the expenditures $200,529,-
-235 less than the estimates. Nothing could
more clearly indicate than these statements the
extent and availability ofthe national resources,
and the rapidity and safety with which, under
our form of government, great military and na
val establishments can be disbanded, and ex
penses reduced from a war to a peace footing.
During the fiscal year ending the 30th of
June, 1866, the receipts were $558,032,620, and
the expenditures $520,750,940, leaving an avail
able surplus of $37,281,680. It is estimated
that the receipts for the fiscal year ending the
30th of June, 1867, will be $475,061,386, and
that the expenditures will roach the sum of
$316,428,078, leaving in the Treasury a surplus
of $158,633,308. For the fiscal year ending
June 30th, 1868. it is estimated that the re
ceipts will amount to $436,000,000, and that
the expenditures will be $350,247,641—5h0wing
an excess of $85,752,359 in favor of the Gov
ernment. These estimated receipts may be di
minished by a reduction of excise and import
duties ; but after all necessary reductions shall
have been made, the revenue of the present and
of following years will doubtless be sufficient to
cover all legitimate charges upon the Treasury,
and leave a large annual surplus to be applied
to the payment of the principal of the debt. —
There seems now to be no good reason why the
taxes may not be reduced as the country advan
ces in population and wealth, and yet the debt
be extinguished within the next quarter of a
century.
REPORT OF SECRETARY OF WAR.
The report ofthe Secretary of War furnishes
valuable and important information in reference
to the operations of his Department during the
past year. Few volunteers now remain in the
service, and they are being discharged as rapid
ly as they can be replaced by regular troops. —
The army has been promptly paid, carefully
provided with medical treatment, well shelter
ed and subsisted, and is to be furnished with
breeeh-loadiii£ small arms. The military
strength of the nation has been unimpaired by
the discharge of volunteers, the disposition of
unserviceable or perishable stores, and the re
trenchment of expenditure. Sufficient war ma
terial to meet any emergency has been retained,
and, from tlie disbanded volunteers standing
ready to respond to the national call, large ar
mies can be rapidly organized, equipped, and
concentrated. Fortifications on the coast and
frontier have received, or arc being prepared
for more powerful armaments; lake surveys
and harbor and river improvements are in course
of energetic prosecution. Preparations have
been made for the payment of the additional
bounties authorized during the recent session of
Congress, under such regulations as will protect
the Government from fraud, and secure to the
honorably-discharged soldier the well-earned
reward of his faithfulness and gallantry. More
than six thou, md maimed soldiers have receiv
ed artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus ;
and forty-one national cemeteries, containing
the remains of 104,626 Union soldiers have al
ready been e:stablished. The total estimate of
military appropriations is $25,205,669.
REPORT OF SECRETARY OF NAVY.
It is stated in the report of the Secretary of
the Navy that the naval force at this time con
sists of two hundred and seventy eight vessels
armed with two thousand, three hundred and
fifty-one guns. Of these, one hundred and fif
teen vessels, carrying one thousand and twenty
nine guns, arc in commission, distributed chiefly
among seven squadrons. The number of men
in the service is thirteen thousand, six hundred.
Great activity and vigilance have been displayed
giiiMii.
by all the squadrons, and their movements have
been judiciously and efficiently arranged in such
mauncr as would best promote American com
merce, and protect the rights and interests of
our countrymen abroad. The vessels unem
ployed are undergoing repairs, or are laid up
until their services may be required. Most of
the iron-clad fleet is at League Island, in the
vicinity of Philadelphia, a place which, until
decisive action should be taken by Congress,
was selected by the Secretary of the Navy as
the most eligible location for that class of ves
sels. It is important that a suitable public sta
tion should be provided for the iron-clad fleet.
It is intended that these vessels shall be in prop
er condition for any emergency, and it, is desi
rable that the bill accepting League Island for
naval purposes, which passed the House of Rep
resentatives at its last session, should receive fi
nal action at an early period, in order that there
may be a suitable public station for this class of
vessels, as well as a navy-yard cf area sufficient
for the wants of the service, on the Delaware
river. The naval pension fund amounts to $11-
-750,000, haying been increased $2,750,000 du
ring the year. The expenditures ofthe Depart
ment for the fiscal year ending 30th of June
last were $43,324,520, and the estimates for the
coming year amount to $23,568,436. Attention
is invited to the condition of our seamen, and
the importance of legislative measures for their
relief and improvement. The suggestions in
behalf of this deserving class of our fellow-citi
zens are earnestly recommended to the favora
ble attention of Congress.
REPORT OF TIIE rOSTM ASTER GENERAL.
The report of the Postmaster General pre
sents a most satisfactory condition of the postal
service, and submits recommendations which
deserve the consideration of Congress. Tbe
revenues of the Department for the year ending
June 30, 1866, were $14,386,986, and the ex
penditures $15,352,079, showing an excess of
the latter $965,093. In anticipation of this de
ficiency, however, a special appropriation was
made by Congress in the act approved July 28,
1866. Including tho standing appropriation of
$700,000 for free mail matter, as a legitimate
portion of the revenues yet remaining unex
pended, the actual deficiency for the past year
is only $265,093 —a sum within $51,141 of the
amount estimated in the annual report of 1864.
The decrease of revenue compared with the pre
vious year was one and one-fifth per cent., and
the increase of expenditures, owing principally
to the enlargement of the mail service in the
South, was twelve per cent. On the 30th of
June last there were in operation six thousand
nine hundred and thirty mail routes, with an
aggregate length of one hundred and eighty
thousand nine hundred and twenty-one miles,
an aggregate annual transportation of seventy
one million eight hundred and thirty seven
thousand nine hundred and fourteen miles, and
an aggregate annual cost, including all expendi
tures, of $8,410,184. The length of railroad
routes is thirty-two thousand and ninety-two
miles, and the annual transportation thirty mil
lion six hundred and nine thousand four hun
dred and sixty-seven miles. The length of
steamboat routes is fourteen thousand three
hundred and forty-six miles, and the annual
transportation three millie% four hundred and
eleven thousand nine hundred and sixty-two
miles. The mail service is rapidlj 7 increasing
throughout the whole country, and its steady
extension in the Southern States indicates their
constantly improving condition. The growing
importance of the foreign service also merits at
tention. The Post Office Department of Great
Britain and our own have agreed upon a pi _
liininary basis for a new postal convention,
which it is believed will prove eminently bene
ficial to the commercial interests ofthe United
States, inasmuch as it contemplates a reduction
of the international letter postage to one half
the existing rates; a reduction of postage with
all other countries to and from which corres
pondence is transmitted in the British mail, or
in closed mails through the United Kingdom ;
the establishment of uniform and reasonable
charges for the sea and territorial transit of cor
respondence in closed mails; and an allowance
to each post office department of the right to
use all mail communications established under
the authority of the other for the despatch of
correspondence, either in open or closed mails,
on the same terms as those applicable to the
inhabitants ofthe country providing the means
of transmission.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior
exhibits the condition of those branches of the
public service which are committed to his su
pervision. During the last fiscal year four mil
lion six hundred and twenty-nine thousand three
hundred and twelve acres of public land were
disposed of, one million eight hundred and
ninety-two thousand five hundred and sixteen
acres of which were entered under the home
stead act. The policy originally adopted rela
tive to the public lands has undergone essential
modifications. Immediate revenue, and not
their rapid settlement, was the cardinal feature
of our land system. Long experience and ear
nest discussion have resulted in the conviction
that the early development of our agricultural
resources, and the diffusion of an energetic pop
ulation over our vast territory, are objects of far
greater importance to the national growth and
prosperity than the proceeds of the sale of the
land to the highest bidder in open market.—
The pre-emption laws confer upon the pioneer
who complies with the terms they impose the
privilege of purchasing a limited portion of "un
offered lands" at the minimum price. The
homestead enactments relieve the settler from
the payment of purchase money, and secure
him a permanent home, upon the condition of
residence for a term of years. This liberal pol
icy invites emigration from the Old, and from
the more crowded portions of the New World.
Its propitious results are undoubted, and will
be more signally manifested when time shall
have given to it a wider development.
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
Congress has made liberal grants of public
land to corporations, in aid of the construction
of railroads and other internal improvements.—
Should this policy hereafter prevail, more strin
gent provisions will be required to secure a
faithful application of the fund. The title to
the lands should not pass, by patent or other
wise, but remain in the Government and sub
ject to its control until some portion of the road
has been actually built. Portions of them might
then, from time to time, be conveyed to the
corporation, but never in a greater ratio to the
whole quantity embraced by the • grants than
the completed parts bear to the entire length of
the projected improvement. The restriction
would not operate to the prejudice of any un
dertaking conceived in good faith and executed
with reasonable energy, as it is the settled prac
tice to withdraw from market the lands falling
within the operation of such grants, and thus
exclude the inception of a subsequent adverse
right. A breach ofthe conditions which Con
gress may deem proper to impose should work
a forfeiture of claim to the lands so withdrawn
but unconveyed, and of title to the lands con
veyed which remain unsold.
PACIFIC RAILROAD.
Operations on the several lines ofthe Pacific
railroad have been prosecuted with unexampled
vigor and success. Should no unforeseen causes
of delay occur, it is confidently anticipated that
this great thoroughfare will be completed be
fore the expiration of the period designated by
Congress.
PENSIONERS.
During the last fiscal year the amount paid to
pensioners, including the expenses of disburse
ment, was thirteen million four hundred and
fifty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-six
dollars; and fifty thousand one hundred and
seventy-seven names were added to the pension
roils. The entire number of pensioners June
30, 18G6, was one hundred and twenty-six thou
sand seven hundred and twenty-two. This fact
furnishes melancholy and striking proof of the
sacrifices made to vindicate the constitutional
authority ofthe Federal Government, and to
maintain inviolate the integrity of the Union. —
They impose upon us corresponding obligations
It is estimated that thirty-three million dollars
will be required to meet the exigencies of this
branch of the service during the next fiscal
year.
INDIANB.
Treaties have been concluded with the In
dians, who enticed into armed opposition to our
Government at the outbreak of the rebellion,
have unconditionally submitted to our authori
ty, and manifested an earnest desire for a re
newal of friendly relations.
During the year ending September 30, 1866,
eight thousand seven hundred and sixteen pat
ents for useful invention and design were is
sued, and at that date the balance in the Treas
ury to the credit of the patent fund was two
hundred and twenty-eight thousand two hun
dred and ninety-seven dollars.
LEVEES.
As a subject upon which depends an immense
amount ofthe production and commerce ofthe
country, I recommend to Congress such legisla
tion as may be necessary for the preservation of
levees of the Mississippi river. It is a matter
of national importance that early steps should
be taken not only to add to the efficiency of
these barriers against destructive inundations,
but for the removal of all obstructions to the
free and safe navigation of that great channel
of trade and commerce.
DISTRICT OP COLUMBIA.
The District of Columbia, under existing laws,
is not entitled to that representation in the na
tional councils which, from our earliest history,
has been uniformly accorded to each Territory
established from time to time within our limits.
It maintains peculiar relations to Congress, to
whom the Constitution has granted the power
of exercising exclusive legislation over the seat
of Government. Our fellow-citizens residing in
the District, whose interests are thus confided
to the special guardianship of Congress, exceed
in number the population of several of our Ter
ritories, and no just reason is perceived why a
delegate of their choice should not be admitted
to a seat in the House of Representatives. No
mode seenis so appropriate and effectual of
enabling them to make known their peculiar
condition and wants, and of securing the local
legislation adapted to them. I therefore rec
ommend the passage of a law authorizing the
electors of the District of Columbia to choose a
delegate, to be allowed the same rights and
privileges as a delegate representing a Territory.
The increasing enterprise and rapid progress of
improvement in the District are highly gratify
ing, and I trust that the efforts of the munici
pal authorities to promote the prosperity ofthe
national metropolis will receive the efficient and
generous co-operation of Congress.
AGRICULTURE.
The report of the Commissioner of Agricul
ture reviews the operations of his Department
during the past year, and asks tho aid of Con
gress in its efforts to cucourage those States
which, scourged by war, are now earnestly .en
gaged in the reorganization of domestic indus
try.
" FOREIGN RELATIONS.
It is a subject of congratulation that no for
eign combinations against our domestic peace
and safety, or our legitimate influence among
the nations, have been formed or attempted.—
While sentiments of reconciliation, loyalty, and
patriotism have increased at home, a more just
consideration of our national character and
rights has been manifested by foreign nations.
THE ATI.ANTIC TELEGRAPH.
The entire success of the Atlantic Telegraph
between the coast of Ireland and the Province
of New Foundland, is an achievement which
has been justly celebrated in both hemispheres
as the opening of an era in the progress of civ
ilization. There is reason to expect that equal
success will attend, and even greater results fol
low, the enterprise for connecting the two con
tinents through the Pacific Ocean by the pro
jected line of telegraph between Kamschatka
and the Itussian possessions in America.
PARDONS BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.
The resolution of Congress protesting against
pardons by foreign Governments of persons con
victed of infamous offences, o_ condition of em
igration to our countr\-, has been communicated
to the States with which we maintain inter
course, and the practice, so justly the subject
of complaint on ouv part, has not been renewed.
CONGRATULATIONS TO RUSSIA.
The congratulations of Congress to the Em
peror of Russia, upon his escape from attempted
assassination, have been presented to that hu
mane and enlightened ruler, and received by
him with expressions of grateful appreciation.
EMIGRATION OF FREEDMEN.
The Executive, warned of an attempt by
Spanish American adventurers to induce the
emigration of freedmen ofthe United States to
a foreign country, protested against the project
as one which, if consummated, would reduce
them to a bondage even more oppressive than
that from which they have just been relieved.
Assurance has been received from the govern
ment of the State in which the plan was ma
tured, that the proceeding will meet neither its
encouragement nor approval. It is a question
worthy of your consideration, whether our laws
upon this subject are adequate to the preven
tion or punishment ofthe crime thus meditated.
MEXICAN AFFAIRS.
In the month of x\pril last, as Congress is
aware, a friendly arrangement was made be
tween the Emperor of Fiance and the President
of the United States for the withdrawal from
Mexico of the French military expeditionary
forces. This withdrawal was to be effected in
three detachments, the first of which, it was
understood, would leave Mexico in November,
now past, the second in March next, and tbe
third and last in November, 1867. Immediate
ly upon the completion of the evacuation the
French Government was to assume the same at
titude of non-intervention, in regard to 3lexico,
as is held by the Government of the United
States. Repeated assurances have been given
by the Emperor, since that agreement, that he
would complete the promised evacuation within
the period mentioned, or sooner.
It was reasonably expected that the proceed
ings thus contemplated would produce a crisis
of great political interest in the Republic of
Mexico. The newly appointed Minister of the
United States, Mr. Campbell, was therefore
sent forward, on the 9th day of November last,
to assume his proper functions as Minister
Plenipotentiary of the United States to that
Republic. It was also thought expedient that
he should be attended in the vicinity of Mexico
by the Lieutenant General ofthe Army of the
United States, with the view of obtaining such
information as might be important to determine
the course to be pursued by the United States
in re-establishing and maintaining necessary
and proper intercourse with the Republic of
Mexico. Deeply interested in the cause of lib
erty and humanity, it seemed an obvkr . duty
on our part to exercise whatever influence we
possessed for tbe restoration and permanent es
tablishment in that country of a domestic and
republican form of government.
Such was the condition of affairs in regard to
Mexico, when, on the 22d of November last,
official information was received from Paris that
the Emperor of France had some time before
decided not to withdraw a detachment of his
forces in the month of November past, accord
ing to engagement, but that this- decision was
made with the purpose of withdrawing tbe
whole of those forces in the ensuing spring.—
Of this determination, however, the United
States had not received any notice or intima
tion ; and, so soon as the information was re
ceived by the Government, care was taken to
make known its dissent to the Emperor of
France.
I cannot forego the hope that France will re
consider the subject, and adopt some resolution
in regard to the evacuation of Mexico which
will conform as nearly as practicable with the
existing engagement, and thus meet the just
expectations of the United States. The pa
pers relating to the subject will be laid before
Number XXV.
you. It is believed that, with the evacuation
of Mexico by the expeditionary forces, no sub
ject lot serious difference between France and
the L nited States would remain. The expres
sions ofthe Emperor and people of France war
rant a hope that the traditionary friendship be
tween the two countries might in that case be
renewed and permanently restored.
A claim of a citizen of the United States for
indemnity for spoliations committed on the
high seas by the French authorities, in the ex
ercise of a bellfgerent power against Mexico,
has been met by the Government of France
with a proposition to defer settlement until a
mutual convention for the adjustment of all
claims of citizens and subjects of both countries,
arising out of the recent wars on this Continent,
shall tie agreed upon by the two countries. —
The suggestion is not deemed unreasonable, but
it belongs to Congress to direct the manner in
which claims for indemnity by foreigners, as
well as by citizens _* the United States, arising
out of the late civil war, shall be adjudicated
and determined. I have no doubt that the
subject of all such claims will engage your at
tention at a convenient and proper time.
GREAT BRITAIN AFFAIRS.
It is a matter of regret that no considerable
advance has been made towards an adjustment
of the differences between the United States
and Great Britain, arising out of the depreda
tions upon our national commerce and other
trespasses committed during our civil war by
British subjects, in violation of international
law and treaty obligations. The delay, however,
may be believed to have resulted in no small
degree from the domestic situation of Great
Britain. An entire change of ministry occurr
ed in that country during the last session of
Parliament. The attention of the new ministry
was called to the subject at an early day, and
there is some reason to expect that it will now
be considered in a becoming and friendly spirit.
The importance of an early disposition of the
question cannot be exaggerated. Whatever
might be the wishes of the two Governments,
it is manifest that good will and friendship
between the two countries cannot be establish
ed until a reciprocity, in the practice of good
faith and neutrality, shall be restored between
the respective nations.
THE FENIAN-.
On the 6th of June last, in violation of our
neutrality laws, a militara expedition and enter
prise against the British North America Colonies
was projected and attempted to be carried on
within the territory and jurisdiction of the
United States. In obedience to the obligation
imposed upon the Executive by the the Consti
tution, to see that the laws are faithfully ex
ecuted, all citizens were warned by proclama
tion, against taking part in or aiding such un
lawful proceedings, and the proper, civil, milita
ry, and naval officers were directed to take all
necessary measures for the enforcement of the
laws. The expedition failed, but it has not
been without its painful consequence. Some of
our citizens who, it was alleged, were engaged
in the expedition, were captured, and have been
brought to trial as for a capital offence in the
province of Canada. Judgment and sentence
of death have been pronounced against some,
while others have been acquitted. Fully believ
ing in the maxim of government that severity
of civil punishment for misguided persons who
have engaged in revolutionary attempts which
have disastrously failed is unsound and unwise,
such representations have been made to the
British Government, in behalf of the convicted
persons, a*, being sustained by an enlightened
and humane judgment, will, it is hoped, induce
in their cases an exercise of clemency, and judi
cious amnesty to all who were engaged in the
movement. Counsel has been employed by the
Government to defend citizens of the United
States on trial for capital offences in Canada,
and a discontinuance of the prosecutions which
were instituted in the courts of the United
States against those who took part in the expe
dition has been directed.
I have regarded the expedition as not only
political in its nature, but as also in a great
measure foreign from the United States in its
causes, character, and objects. The attempt
was understood to be made in sympathy with
an insurgent part in Ireland, and, by striking
at a British province on this continent, was de
signed to aid in obtaining redress for political
grievances which, it wa3 assumed, the people of
Ireland had suffered at the hands ofthe British
Government during a period of several centuries.
The persons engaged in it were chiefly natives
of that country, some of whom had, while others
had not, become citizens of the United States
under our general laws ofnaturalization. Com
plaints of misgovernment in Ireland continually
engage the attention of the British nation, and
so great an agitation is now prevailing in Ireland
that the British Government have deemed it
necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus
in that country. These circumstance must
necessarily modify the opinion which we might
otherwise have entertained in regajd to an ex
pedition expressly prohibited by our neutrality
laws. So long as those laws remains upon our
statute books they should be faithfully execu
ted, and if they operate hashly, unjustly or op
pressively, Congress alouo can apply the remedy
by their modification or repeal.
Political and commercial interests of the Uni
ted States are not unlikely to be affected in
some degree by events which are transpiring in
the eastern regions of Europe, and the time
seems to have come when our Government ought
to have a proper diplomatic representation in
Greece.
This Government has claimed for all persons
not convicted, or accused, or suspected of crime,
an absolute political right of self-expatriation,
and a choice of new national allegiance. Most
ofthe European States have dissented from
this principle, and have claimed a right to hold
such of their subjects as have immigrated to
and been naturalized in the United States, and
afterwards returned ou transient visits to their
native countries, to the performance of* military
service in like manner as resident subjects.
Complaints arising from the claim in this re
spect made by foreign States, have heretofore
been matters of controversy between the United
States and some of the European Powers, and
the irritation consequent upon the failure to
settle this question increased during the war in
which Prussia, Italy, and Austria were recent
ly engaged. While Great Britain has never
acknowledged the right of expatriation, she has
not practically insisted upon it. France has
been equally forbearing ; and Prussia has pro
posed a compromise, which, although evincing
increased liberality, has not been accepted by
the United States. Peace is now prevailing
everywhere in Europe, and the present seems
to be a favorable time for an assertion by Con
gress of the principle, so long maintained by
the Executive Department, that naturalization
by one State fully exempts the native-born sub
ject of any other State from the performance
of military service under any foreign Govern
ment, so as be does not voluntarily renounce
its rights and benefits.
CONCLUSION.
In the performance of a duty imposed upon
me by the Constitution, I have thus submitted
to the Representatives of the States and of the
People such information of our domestic and
foreign affairs as the public interests seem to
require. Our Government is now under-going
its most trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer is,
that the peril may be successfully and finally
passed, without impairing its original strength
and symmetry. The interests ofthe nation are
best to be promoted by the revival of fraternal
relations, the complete obliteration of our past
differences, and the reinauguration of all the
pursuits of peace. Directing our efforts to the
early accomplishment of these great ends, let
us endeavor to preserve harmony between the
co-ordinate Departments of the Government,
that each in its proper sphere may cordially co
operate with the other in securing the mainte
nance of the Constitution, the preservation of
the Union, and the perpetuity of our free insti
tutions.
