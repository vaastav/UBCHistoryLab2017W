"Woo her not wih boastful phrases,
Lest yon teach, her lips to sneer ;
Still a suitor's warmest praises
In his conduct should appear.
'.'Woo her not yithsenseless sighing

Tell her not that you are dying,
Lest she, mocking, bid you die !
I' ?? Wob ber not with weakly whining. J

" TBoth your sorrows- and jourselt !
Woo her with manly wooing ;
Giving hostages to Fate,
All the heart's devotion showing
By its strengtlitP wprk and wait.

A DOSE F0ES TIG GEE S-
A SERIO-COMIC SKETCH.
' . ." BY SYLVATftJS COBB, JR.
Elnathan Stiggera was raving. El
nathan Stiggers was mad. Flnathan
Stiggers was, jealous as jealous as
man could b s. And thus it was :
j-.EJnatran Stiggers was forty years
of age, and until within a year of the
time of wh'ch we write he had lived
tho life of a grasping- bachelor; but
at length he had' fiunlly taken a wife,
whether he had loved Maria Brown
as a true man ought 'o lovewc cannot
say ; but we can say that no sooner
had she become Lis wife than ho
sought to guard her from the admir
ing eyes ol the rest f the world.
Maria wa young and good-looking.
Asa child the had admired tire Stig
gers mansion, ana as a woman sneuaa
Hccepted the position ot its mistress.
People said that Stiggers had conclu
ded it would be chenper to maintain a
wife than to hire a housekeeper ; and
at the same time they expressed the
opinion that Stiggers had made a mis
take if he anticipated that he was go
ing to bend Maria Brown to the yoke
of his penurious purpose.
We have s:iil that Stfggers was jeal
ous, lie had di-covered that a young
and dashing looking uian had visited
hw house during his' absence that he
hatl been there twice, at least, and
on both occasions he had been closeted
with Mr S'.iggers. He had received
t'ns information from old Jotham Jub
ktiis, his inan-of-all work about his
place.
' '"Sartin sure, sir," declared Jothama
'the man's been her? twice within a
week. Finttimehe'ax'd me. was my
master to hum ; and when I told him
No, he . put straight for the house,
and ax'd for the missus: She come to
the door, and he went in. Three days
afterwards he come agin. When he
went away he last time1 I wa3 stand
in' close by the -porch ; and I -heerd
Missus tell him to te keerful, and not
to breath a word, of what had happen
ed ! I did. sir, sartin sure. .
OJ the scoundrel J Oh, the perfid
ious wretch i' '
. Stiggera ground his heel into the
sand, and when he had sworn to his
heart's content or, as much as he
thought Jolham conld be r, he start
ed for the house, and in . the hall .he,
met Polly Piper. Polly was the young
maid-servant, and warmly attached to
her mistress. Stiggers took her by
the arm, and dragged her into the
drawirg-room.
. 'Polly Piper, if you valne your life,
tell me the truth !' He stamped his
foot, :nl looked furious. Ordinarily
Pollv woul I have been frightened by
such an exhibition of madness on the
pan oi a man, SSn-
was hrrlly made up for frightening
anybody, parUculaily a quick-witted
Omail. ,, .(.I,.,-..
'There has "been a young man here
to see Mrs. Stiggers a dashing man,
here twice !" . t '- '
.'Yes, sir,' answered Polly.
, , 'Ah ! you acknowledge it ! What
didheco-tefor?"
, 'I cannot tell you, sir.'
'Don't you know?' '
Polly looked up almost wickedly.'
- ,'Yes, sir.'
'Aha! Oho! j'ouknow, eh? And
what did he came here for 1'
Polly Piper-looked resolute, and yet
the wicked expression an expression my own.
such as only a bright-eyed, saucy girl 'O, ves ! - very careful for my sake!
can wear was upon her face. ; - -' j 'j$nr jirg. SHsrgers, would you be so
'I cannot tell you, sir.' ' " ' : . kind as to tell us what that marvel
'Cannot?' ous deed was, which he hnd feared
'No. sir. ;
Polly Piper, if you value
life, tell me 1
3'oir
'I cannot.
Why not?'
'My mistress made me promise."
0HiQ;;;WEI3
.Made you promiso'not to tell why
that young villain csrae nere r
,Made me promise, sir, not to tell
why the: beautiful young gentleman
came here."
C '.Wretch 1 Hypooiite I Worn !
Leave my house 1 You are no. longer
in my .employ ! But etayi-Tr-Did..you
heartrfhis creeping, sneaking villainous
aBoxouiation --of a man use : terms of
endearment to Mrs. Stiggers i'-.
'I .think he had reasonj. sir, . to blest
her.'
'Ha!-he did? And for what?'
'I cannot tell yo", sir.' -
'You promised Mrs. Stiergersnot,
Yes, sir."
'Out with you, vixen ! Pack up
?rour contemptible wardrobe, and
eavei Let me jiever set eyes upon
your detestable, fiendish face again !' '
1 Elhathan Stiggers went to the, side
board hi the dining room, and swal
lowed a tumbler- full of brandy, and
then sought his wife,' whom he found
quietly sewing in the sitting room.
.-So ! Mrs. Stiggers ! I have caught
3ou at last, have-1 ?' '
Mrs. -baggers was not unprepared
for this. " Polly had just passed thro'
the roomi : r .'-.-.'! ;
'You have caught me sewing a but
ton upon '3-our shirt, you careless
man,' she said, without looking up.
'O ! you double-dyed traitress!'
' ' Mrsl Stiggers laid down her work,
and raised her head.
; 'Elnathan!' ' ' .
O. don't think to fool me, Mre.
ctiggers. - I know yon are for a false,
deceitful,' treacherous, evil-eyed-.-'
'Mr. Stiggers!' '
- I'Who is "the-gay Lothario that's
b'ien buzzing about your bower in my
absence ?'
Elnathan had sat down, wcl'.-uigh
out of breath.
'You mean the -young man who
called to see-me?' , ,
'Yes I mean the graceless villain
who persists in visiting you when I
am a away.' -
Really, 51 r. Stiggers, your abrupr
and ungentlemaiily maunerdoes not in
vite me to entertain vour question.'
'But you do not deny that he haj
been here Y ':
'I do not.'
The la t time he was here he gave
vou a written letter, and told you that
you had made him happy ?'
'He gave me a wiilteu paper, sir.
A nd declared that you had made
him a happy man ?'
'I think he did -use words to that
effect.'
- 'Mrs. Stiggers, wliat.jras.Uiat written
pnper Y '
'When you are more respectful, 1
may tell you." ,
Then j'ou will not tell me now V
And you bade Polly Pifer to be se
cret alout the matter 2"
Ye?.' ..
'Mrs. Stgigcrp, that is enough ! I am
not a fool ! I am not to be hen-peck
ed ! Henceforth you are nothing to
me!: Had you confessed your weak-
eojs, and humbly asked my fomive
ness,. I might have overlooked this
disgraceful proceeding: but since you
are wickrdJy contumacious, 1 shall do
th only thing which is left for me to
do. I ehidl call your relatives in, and
in iheir presence I shall expose you ;
and they shall then judge' whether I
have reason to put you from me?'
'You can do as you please, Mr.
Stiggers.'
'I shall do a I please !' And with
this Elnathan Stiggers strode from the
room.
And while the savajrc fit was upon
him Stiggers posted off and called up
on the relatives of- his wife who lived
near at hand. They were shocked
when they had heard his accusations ;
but they wero incredulous- They
had known Maria as a most proper
and discreet maiden, and they could
not believe that she had so forgotten
herself. But they were willing to as
semble at his house, and .witness the
effect of his accusation before them.1
And that evening the Browns, and
the Jonesis, and the Pipers all rela
tives of the suspected wife were
gathered tocether in Elnathan Stig
eers' largo drawing room, and Mrs.
Stiggers was summoned before them.
First, Jotham Judkns ;waa called
upon for his1 etory. - .
But Mi . Stiggers interrupted.
There is no need,' "she ' said, 'that
onr servants shou'd be questioneT. I
enn give all needed particulars.'
'Aha, madam ! We shall see ! Now
answer me.' Mr. Stiergers spoke
very grandiloquently. 'I have told
cur friencs ot the scandalizing facts
so far as they are known to me. No v,
Mrs. Stigirers,, will you tell-'ui what
was the villain's name?'
'You mean the name of the genjlo
ma who tailed upon me?'
'As yon p'ease.'
.: 'His name, as he wrote it, was Gits-
tavus Vandervrer.'
r -'A most callant name, I must con-

i you made him a happy man V
I 'He Bo declared.
i 'Ho did ? So, so, we are getting
on. And what did you do that made
him so excessively happvY
'I did what he had evidently began
to fer never would be done.'
"You did ?' And yoicbound your ser
vant to secrecy ?' . ,
'Yes. I did not care that his er
rand should be known to onr friends,
for your sake, Elnathan,
as well as
never might be accomplished,
wn;ch you so pleasantly wrought
but
out
lor him r
'It is written on this paper,' said
i Mrs. Stigeers, at the same time taking
a neatly folded paper from her pocket.
14, 1870
"OhJ f " Thar isT.be paper he gave
you .-r'j -i. . . tr I -
" Yes. Shall I letmy uncle read it ?'
'Aye. We 'will hear it. Read it
'aloud,. Deacon. - Read every word.'
., Deacon Solomon .Brown, took the
paper, and having stood up near the
mantel lamp, and adjusted his specta
cles, he . read, in. (resonant, vigorous
tones, aa follows : w , . "
Net York, June first, eighteen
hundrodand sixty-eight Mr. Elna
than Stiggers to Paperpod & Inkman,
Debtor: To one copy of The Evan
gelical Gazette, from June first, eigh
teen hundred and fifty-eight Twenty;-
hve dollars" Keseived .payment,
Guatavcii VmViderveer, -for the Pub
lishers ' 1 -.
You -will understand,' ' remarked
Mrs. Stiggers, very quietly,' that' the
terms of the paper were two dollars a
year, to 'which fifty cents'1 was to be
added it not paid withm six months.
'Mr. Stigger3 ; caught the receipt
from the Deacon's hand,- and when
he had seen its written face, he sank
down like a man palsied.
'The collector,' pursud Mrs. 'Stig
eers, wa? very, very happy, wuen he
found himself in possession of the
full, amount of the bill -'He had
sought long, but in vain, to collect it
by mail ; And perhaps you can all
of you understand that delicate in
stinct of a true and sensitive wife
which would seek to hide from the
world a thing so damasing to the
character of her husband as an unpaid')
newspaper acoouot oi so many years
standing!' . 1
' To the present day Elnathan Stig
gers has but a faint idea of how he
got rid of bis summoned witnesses on
that eventful evening: but upon two
very important particulars he -feels
thatho . can with perfect assurance
take his oath t
First, He has not allowed himself
to manifest any symptoms of jealousy
toward his wife; and. Second, Ho
has precluded the possibility of anoth
er visit from the New York collector
by paying iu variably in advance for
his newspaper. New York' Ledger,
Civil Service Reform.
Theoucstion of imbuincr onr civil
service with more of efficienc-, hones-ri
ty and economy, has excited much
discusion for a year past, and has
now aroused a widespread interest,
which bodes the best results. To Mr.
Jtnckes, of Rhode Island,- belongs
the credit of first bringing the ques
tion tangibiy before Cocgres3. The
plan' of civil service reform,'; contem
plated iu his bill, was to make qualifi
cation and fitness the test of accepta
bility. It provided for competitive
examinations of candidates, and lim
ited appointments to such as should
have successfully passed the ordeal.
It also intended that faithfulness and
efficiency, and not political opinions,
should be the condition of continu
ance in'the public service. One of
the fundamental objects of Mr Jenckes
bill was to kill the much abused cus
tom of making the public offices the
mere rewards for political service. It
is not strange tbat Radicalism should
have frowned down tho bill.
- Senator Schurz also made himself
prominent, last winter, by his advoca
cy ol reform iu this direction His
bill provided for the appointment by
the. President, with the consent of the
Senate of a civil service board of com
missioner.; who would prescribe the
qualifications requisite for appoint
ment into each branch and grade of
the civil service, and examine appli
cants for such positions, excepting
Judges and Clerks of the United
States Courts, members of the Cabi
net, ministers to foreign countries,
and officers of the Senate and House
of Representatives ; and thereafter al
other appointments of civil officers
were to b-j made from persons who
had been found duly qualified under
the regulations established by Board.
Appointments by heads of depart
ments were to. be made i' the order
of seniority and meriL Officers ap
pointed on recommendation of the
Board were to be appointed for twelve
years, but of the first nin) appointed
three were to go out every four years.
Thair salaries were fixed, at $(3,000
per annum, woman to. be equally elig
ible with men for examination and ap
pointment to all offices they can fill
equally well. Tho bill was not acted
upon.
. Senator Trumbull is another agita
tor for civil service reform. The Sen
.ator has annouueed that he will soon
bring forward a bill embodying his
views iu the premises. His bill, says
the Chicago Timet 'is merely a propo-
aitinn to,nnL- it , r,HW r 11 i.,',9M.
&o , for any Senator or Congressman
to recommend any person lor appoint
ment, unless requested so to do by the
President, or head of a department,
and thajt then the recommendation
shall b.e made in writing. It
amounts to nothing. Its only effect,
in the event of its passage; would be
prevent Congressmen f -om disti rb
ing their recommendations and prom
ises of favor promiscuously among
the horde of office-seekers by whom
tbey are beset. It "might give some
relief to Congressmen ; but it would
not 'afford the slightest remedy for the
evil that most needs cure. It would
not exchange partisan dirty work for
capacity and fitness as qualifications
for the public service, it would not
remove dishonesty and incapacity in
the present; it would not assure hon
esty and capacity in the future. As
regards the civil service, it would ac
complish no reform.'
President Grant has been the means
unwittingly, of warming np the peo
ple to a keen interest in this practjcle
subject. A few weeks ago, one of
the most valuable officers in tho pub
lic servica, who had earnestly striven
to promote honesty and efficiency in
his department, found his oflice inva-
de(J by a . gang "of politicians, who
were levying forced assessments upon
his clerks, for political purposes.
The officer felt impelled to set his
face like a flint against these proceed
ings, and accordingly the President,
acting as the tool, of the aforesaid gang,
turned hini out. And how the Pres
ident has the effrontery to come 'out
in his Message m fayor of reform in
the civil-service. - We imagine that
the country will be better off without
any of his reformation ' if Grants idea
of what such reform should be, is
shown in his conduct toward '. the In
terior Department. '
'Secretary Boutwell, too, is con
strained by the ' pressure of public
opinion, to-make a show of zeal in the
new ' crusade.' The Secretary says
that the act of 1855, in regard to the
examination of the 'clerks has been
observed 'in his .department. ; Mr.
Boutwell took 'occasion to announco
this fact, at the time that Mr. Cox
left the Cabinet; but the Nation inti
mates that his observance of the act
is more nominal than real. It is well
known that the policy which Mr. Cox
rebelled against, and which is one of
our civil service, has no more earnest
supporter than the Secretary of the
Treasury.
One tiling seems assured : the pub
lic mind is now so thorongnly aroused
oifthis subject, that it will be satisfied
with nolhit g short of a substantial
remodeling of onr political machinery.
If tho work is prosecut-d aright,- that
machinery will be found to be com
plex beyond all reason, and the ne
cessity lor a reduction in officials, by
at least one half, will enforce itself.
During the past decade, the multipl'
cation of useless offices has been ' one
of the woret evils inflicted upon the
couutry.-i.Pff Dealer.
The President's Message-
The messages of our chief magls
trates, as they are given from year to
year, are mile stones, so to speak, in
the nations growth. Each exhibits
the material progress the nation has
made in the twelve-months just gone
over- Ihus. tlie Presidents message
necessarily more or less interesting
to the American reader, and the one
which has just been given to the pub
lic is no. exception to the rule. But
we shall find no especial traces of
ability in the document ; us a state
papqr it is safe to say that many oth
ers iiave excelled it.
The Message manife-ts an occasion
al spasm of energy; in those portions
of it for instauoe, which refer to tho
acquisition of San Domingo, the
fisheries question, and the navigation
of the St LaArence. Of course no
one imagines that Grant had anyhaud
in the writing of the message, or in
its general design ; but at least his
inspiration is plainly perceptible in
the remarks on San Domingo. Tho
acquisition of that spec of tropical dirt
has loDg been known to be a hobby
of his. When the idea was in its
embryo state, it will be remembered
that he so forgot the dignity of his
official position as to buttonhole Con.
gre?smen for their influence in carry
ing through the scheme. But there
was about the latter so perceptibly the
odor of a job, that it soon fell into
disrepute, popularly, and had the
effect to array against the President,
Senator Sumner, and other Republi
can leaders. Considering all this, it
is somewhat remarkable that Grant
should have so warmly electioneered
tbejob, as be has in his message.
On the subject of the fisheries, the
President, we imagine, represents the
average sentiment of the country.
There is uo-doubt that the authorities
of the Canadian Dominion, have Ja
ken grounds against our fishermen,
which they cannot 'be permitted to
maintain; and this country will be
glad to hear the President say that,
should the authorities ill question per
sist iu exercising their untenable ju
iisdiction over the vessels of the Uni
ted States, it will be his 'duty lo
take such steps as may be necessary
to protect t' e rights of the citizens of
the United States." And tho deter-
. nilUailOH Ol t.lU X TOU'M
protect the rights of our people in the
nfivLration of the St. Lawrence will
-ry
also meet with approval. These are,
perhaps, the salient points of his
message.
He describes tho foreign relations
of the oountr-, especially in connection
with the war in Europe ; but no new
points are touched upon, if we except
the matter of the Alabama claims
Grant recommending to Congress "to
authorize-the appointment of a com
mission to take prcor of the amounts
and the uwnership of these claimes on
notice to the representatives of Her
Majesty, at Washington, and that
authority be given for the- settlement
of these claims by the United States,
so that the Government shall have
the ownership of. the private claims
as well as the responsible control of
all demand against Great Britain."
With reference to the decline of
American commerce, he says that
several propositions will belaid befoFe
Con press in the course of the present
session, looking to a remedy of the
evil,

The President advocate! the adop
tion of Secretary Creswell's recom
mendation for the franking privilege.
On the subject of civil pervice re
form, Grant has the coolness to say : '
"Always favoring
I respectfully call ,
practical reforms,
pour attentian to
an abuse of long standing, which I
would like to see remedied by this
Congress. It is a reform in the .civil
service of the country." Seeing that
the President has just . turned one of
the ablest members of his cabinet out
of office, because he attempted to in
stitute a reform in this direction, hia
remarks on this subject' will be aptTto
make people open their eyes some.
The Message speaks encoursgei ug
ly of our Indian affairs; and the hope
is expressed that the present policy
of the government will eventuate in
the civilization of these-"wards of the
nation."
The remainder ot the document
concerns general matters of which it
is unnecessary to speak here. Fx.
The Tariff Bobbers Cornered-
Free trade has swept like a tornado
over the great agricultural West, and
the Congiessional elections have al
ready returned a majority in Congress
against the robbers who have so long
fattened on the industry of the coun
try by the aid of Radical legislation.
The State of Illinois" gave some fi ty
thousand majority for General Grant-.
Mark tho change in that State as con
fessed by the Chicago Tribune, the
Republican, but not the Grant organ
of Illinois :
In ''his State thirteen of the four
teen members elect are opposed to
protection, and the other member has,
until very recently, been classed as an
anti protectionist, and may, very
probably, be so classed now. The
Senator, to be elected this winter will
also be an anti-protectionist, so that
Illinois will be represented in the
next Congress by a delegation in both
houses in favor of revenue reform.
The next House of Representatives
will then overhaul the present tariff,
and liberate the people ffom the out
rageous exactions of the Yankee
monopolists. Henceforth no West
ern Congressman ran live politicaly
who votes for protection or a protec
tionist Speaker. Tho House will,
with little doubt, be so organized as
to give the speakership and the power
over the reform committees to a "rev
enue reformer" that is to a Republi
can free, trader. The Democrats are
in a minority, and. cannot make their
own speaker. But on the tariff ques
tion the Republican "revenue reform
ers" joined with the "free trade"
Democrats can control the legislation
of the House. How to make this
combination rind still keep up the
distinctive lines ot parties, which . the
Democrats have no idea of abandon
ing, or any occasion for abandoning,
is now the subject of discussion in the
press of the country. .The New York
World has entered fully Into the de
bate. That journal; while advising
the preservation of the Democratic
organization in' the hope that bore
that thG e-reat bodv of the "revenue
reformers" will ultimately come over
to it, yet recommends that the Demo
crats and Revenue Reformers 6hall
act together in the organization of the
next House of Representatives. It
savs that the two co-operating, will
conf titute a majority of the House,
can olect a Speaker, get control of the
ommittees, and effectually block the
chemes of protectionists an advant
age which the Democrats should net
foreero. Tho World says that the
Democrats can, as usual, hold their
preliminary caucus, and make a nom
ination for Speaker, who, "if a Re-
a. -
publican," "will still be the nominee
of the unbroken Democratio party."
As for the Republican Revenue Re
formers, it thinks that Having been
elected as Republicans, their position
wdl be one of real delicacy and diffi
culty; they were also elected as
"anti Protectionists" and are bound
to act with fidelity to their free trade
constituencies. The Democrats, says
the World, "should be considerate of
the party relations of these members,
and make it as easy as they can for
them.'' The great difficulty with
them will be in the Republican cau
cus. If the Republican Revenue
Reformers go into that caucus, they
will be a minority, and will be out
voted by the protectionists, and will
be bound by its action. The World's
advice in this difficulty, is, that they
hold "a separate caucus in advance of
both of the party caucuses," and adds:
"It is a necessity of their position that
they should nominate a Republican
for speaker, and pledge themselves to ,
vote for him steadily iu every contin
gency," so as to "have a good party
defence." If the Democrats, who are
not strong enough to elect their own
Speaker, will adopt the candidate of.

cause it to be discussed with unwont-''
