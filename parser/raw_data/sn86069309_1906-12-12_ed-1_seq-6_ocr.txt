the kidneys are your
blood purifiers they fil

Impurities in the blood

of order they fall to do
their work
Pains aches and rheu
matism come from ex
cess of uric acid In the
blood due to neglected
kidney trouble
Kidney trouble causes quick or unsteady
heart beats and makes one feel as though
they had heart trouble because the heart is
overworking In pumping thick kidney
poisoned blood through veins and arteries
It used to be considered that only urinary
troubles were to be traced to the kidneys
but now modern science proves that nearly
all constitutional diseases have their begin
ning In kidney trouble
If you are sick you can make no mistake
by first doctoring your kidneys The mild

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
Washington Dec 4 President
Roosevelt in his annual message
again urges the enactment of a law
prohibiting corporations from contri
butlng to > campaign funds He also
urges the passage of a bill conferring
upon the government tho right of ap
peal In criminal cases on questions or
law also legislation to limit the set
ting aside of judgments and granting
new trial on trivial technicalities
On the subject of injunctions In la
bor cases objection Is made to abol
ishing altogether the writ of Injunc
tion but It Is recommended that so
far as possible abuse of thfe power
should be provided against by some
such law as was advocated In the
message a year ago
Lynching Is discussed extensively
not as a crime of any particular sec
tion but as an evil tendency of law
lessness It Is argued that justice
should be exercised alike to all re
gardless of color creed or social posi
tion As to mob vlolece In cases of
rape the message says In my judg
ment the crime of rape should always
be punished with death as Is the case
with murder Assault with Intent to
commit rape should be made a capital
crime at least in tue discretion of the
court and provision should be made
by which the punishment may follow
Immediately upon the heels of the
offense
In dealing with both labor and cap
capItal
corporations and trades unions there
Is one matter more Important to re
member nan aught else and that is
the Infinite harm done by preachers of
mere discontent These are the men
who seek to excite a violent class
hatred against all men of wealth The
one hope for success for our people
lies in a resolute and fearless but
sane and cool headed advance along
the path marked out lat year by this
very congress There must be a stern
refusal to be mired into following
either that base creature who appeals
and panders to the lowest instincts
and passions in order to arouse one
set of Americans against their fellows
or that other creature equally base
but no baser who In a spirit of greed
or to accumulate or add to an already
huge fortune Seeks to exploit his fel
low Americans with callous disregard
to their welfare of soul and body The
plain people who thInkthe me
chanics farmers merchants workers
with head or hand the men to whom
American traditions are dear who
love their country and try to act de
cently by their neighbors owe It to
themselves to remember that the
most damaging blow that can be giv
en popular government is to elect an
unworthy and sinister agitator on a
platform of violence and hypocrisy
If ever we let this government fall
Into tho hands of men of either of
these two classes we shall show our
selves fnlpe to Amerlcas past
I rail your attention to the need of
passing the till 11 11 LIng the number of
hours of employment of ralroad em
ployes The measure Is very moder
ate and I can conceive of no serious
objections to It
Let me again urge that congress
provide for an Investigation of the
conditions of child labor and of the
labor of women Ir the United States
The horrors Incident to the employ
ment of young children In factories or
at work anywhere Lre a blot on our
civilization A federal commission
for concllation and arbitration of
strikes and lockouts Is favored
Control of corporations under a fed
eral license law is preferred to con
flicting acts of state legislatures
Recommendation is made for a
graduated income tax and a graduated
inheritance tax
Industrial training In schools is en
couraged to develop the hands and
brains of the wageworker Concern
ing farmers It Is said In the message
Organization has become necessary
necessaryIn
complished much for rood In the
world of labor It Is no less necessary
for farmers Such a movement as the
grange movement Is good In Itself and
Is capable of a sell nigh Infinite fur
ther extension for good so long as It
Is kept to Its own legitimate business
The benefits to be derived by the as
sociation of farmers fo mutual ad
vantage ae partly economic and part
partly
Irrigation and forest preservation I
are advocated along usual lines i
It Is suggested that the whole ques i
tion of marriage and divorce should
be relegated to congress
Legislation for the merchant marine
liB favored along lines in a report sub
mitted at the last session and It Is
said that the proposed measure Is is
nearly unobjectionable as any can be
Currency reform Is discussed and
the views of Secretary Shaw for legis
loginlotion
lotion on the subject are approved
IlatlOn
On insular affairs a lower tariff or
else absolute five trade with the Phil
ippines Is recommended citizenship
for Porto RIcans favored Improve
ment of San Juan harbor and the pay
ment of expenses of the federal court
In Porto Rico paid out of the federal
treasury reorganization of govern
ment for Alaska and the Seattle ex
position sanctioned
Protection of the rights of all alien
citizens Is emphasized and the nat
uralization of Japanese to full citizen
ship favored
Discussing Cuban affairs It is pro
posed that the provisional government
will bo withdrawn after an election Is
hold and a new government Installed
unless the election becomes a farce
or the insurrectionary habit becomes
confirmed
The results of the Rio conference
are commended as promoting friendly
feeling between American republics
A special message will be submitted
on tho Panama canal
It is urged that the Algeclras treaty
treatybe
ratifiedMaintenance
Maintenance of an adequate navy is
nrged an Increase In the number of
men for coast defenses and various
suggestions for strengthening the ef
fectiveness of the army
The United States navy Is tho BUr
est guarantor of peac this coun
try possesses I do not ask that wo
continue to increase our navy I ask
merely that it be maintained at its
present strength and this can be done
only if we replace the obsolete and
outworn ships by new and good ones
the equals of any afloat In any navy
To stop building ships for one year
means that for that year the navy
goes back instead of forward
In both the army and the navy there
is urgent need that everything penal
ble should be done to maintain tho
highest standard for tae personnel
alike as regards the officers and the
enlisted men I do not believe that In
any service there is a finer body of en
enlisted
wo have in both the army and the
navy including tho marine corps
West Point and Annapolis already
turn out excellent officers We do not
need to have these schools made more
scholastic On the contrary we should
never lose aught of the fact that the I
