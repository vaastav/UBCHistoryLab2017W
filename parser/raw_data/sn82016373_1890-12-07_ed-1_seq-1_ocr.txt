SENSATIONAL INCIDENTS.
A IiOMBSHEIil. IN THE NATIONAL
AIXIANGE CONVENTION.
Stormy Sessions Charges of Corruption
A Boom Turns Into a Boomerang Dis
satisfaction With Now Ofllcors A Presi
dential Ilcsidcnao at Washington.
Ocai,a, Fi.a., Dec. 0. Tho afternoon session
of tho National Alliance was exciting through
out. Tho Macunc-Folk-Llvlngston investiga
tion was productive of sensational Incidents.
President Hall, of tho Missouri Alliance, got tho
lloor and his indignation subsequently found
vent in a written protest against the report
of tho committee on investigation submitted and
adopted yesterday. A cross-flro of objections
and demands ensued, during which excitement
arose to tho highest pitch. Macuno's friends in
tho meanwhile used every art to choko off tho
whole business and to proceed with the order of
the afternoon. Those of the anti-Macunites
who managed to maUc themselves heard said
that if there vas "a cat in tho bag" they
wanted it let out. They demanded again and
again that Hall's report bo read.
Finally, the reading of the report was ordered
by a big majority amid cheers and shouts. Then
Hall proceeded to state why ho had refused to
sign tho report of tbo investigating committee.
One was that it censured President Polk for
writing tho Norwood letter, a censure which
was unjust to Polk for various reasons, be
cause it exonerated Dr. Macuue, although
Macuno had actually and openly admitted be
fore tho commltteo that he had gone to Georgia
and formed a combination among Alliance legis
lators and others in tho interests of Pat Cal
houn for United States Senator, because Ma
cuno had also admitted that Calhoun
had "loaned him" (Mucune) $3,000, and be
cause Macuno had further admitted that ho re
mained sixteen days in Georgia lobbying for
Calhoun's election; third, becauso Macune had
admitted before the committee that he had for
tho past year travoled on transportation fur
nished him by the West Point Terminal Com
pany. Other proofs as to lobbying and several minor
charges had also been presented.
Tho reading of this document produced a
profound sensation in the convention hall, and
fu a few seconds another scene of wild excite
ment was being enacted. It was a fight be
tween Polk and North Carolina, backed by
their friends, on one side, and Macune and
Livingston aud Georgia, and their friends, on
tho other.
Finally, as a sort of compromise Livingston
secured the adoption of a motion making the
continuance of the investigation a special order
for 8 P. M. It was hoped that the matter could
be patched up in some way.
The commltteo on the president's message,
with reference to salaries, reported in favor of
making the Presldeut's salary $3,900 with
traveling expenses, out of which ho must pay
his private secretary, and In favor of fixing his
ofllclal resldcnco in Washington. This report
was also adopted. The action in both in
stances was In direct opposition to the recom
mendations of Dr. Macuno in his official re
port. Conversation about tho lobbies of tho hotel
during supper was entirely absorbed by discus
sion of tbo Macune matter which had been a
bombshell in the deliberations of tho conven
tion. As indicating the state of feeling in Kansas
over tho third party conference, numerous tele
grams of congratulation have been received to
day by Gen. John II. Rice from prominent citi
zens there identified with tho people's party.
Starke, another prominent people's party man,
says the Citizens' Alliance is in lino for 1892,
and blazo away and rally for the National
Union ticket.
Those having this call In charge aro circulat
ing it industriously, and to-day succeeded in
securing signatures to it of fifteen out of tho
sixteen Colored Alliance State delegates now
here, E. S. Richardson, of Georgia, alone re
fusing to indorse the movement. This practi
cally commits the colored Alliance men In fif
teen States to the third party project.
It has been a recogulzcd principle of tho
Farmers' Alliauco from the very first that its
organization should not be used by its members
for gaining any political advantage, and Presi
dent Polk in his annual address dwelt strongly
upon this point, insisting that acceptance of
Alliance oflico should debar a member from
over becoming n candidate upon any political
ticket, and vico versa.
Since yesterday's election there has been a
strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction with tho
action of several prominent Alliauco men for
accepting Alliance oflico whllo holding or hav
ing been elected to political office
Right in the face of Presideut Polk's address
tho Alliance reelected Congressman-elect
Clover, of Kansas, as Its vice-president, John
T. AVllllts, of Kansas, as national lecturer. Ho
being a prominent candidate for tho United
States Senato against Ingalls. This was not tho
work of Wllllts himself, but of his friends, under
tho idea that it would benefit him for tho Sena
torshlp at homo. Criticisms aro very severo
upon this, using tho National Alllanco to foist
men in tho different States to oflico. There is
a stroug belief that this election of Willits yes
terday will prove not a boom, but a boomerang,
and some of his friends aro alarmed at tho
existence of this condition of affairs and aro
thinking seriously of insisting that ho refuse to
accept tho office under tho circumstances.
Piesldent Polk, in an interview to-night, ox
pressed his opinion that tho National Alllanco
could hardly close its deliberations before mid
night next Monday. This is goucrally predicted
by tho members. Very little important busi
ness has so far been transacted.
At Exposition Hall to-day over 2,000 people
assembled to hear the speeches of distinguished
visitors, including T. V. Powderly, Graud Mas
ter Workmau, Knights of Labor, who was In
troduced as a leader in tho great reform move
ment aud a speaker of national renown. In tho
course of a leugthy speech Mr, Powderly made
a fiery attack upou tho employment of labor
efwing machinery as defrauding workmon of
tho right to work. Ho was especially bitter
against all olectrlc devices, declaring that capi
talists in their greed had oven cornered God's
wrath and compelled it to do their bidding.

A Gunner Fatally Shot.
Mii.ivii.i.12, N. J., Dec. 0. Daniel Creamer
and his stepson, Henry Dunham, were return

Creamer's gun was accidentally discharged, and
Dunham received tho full load through his left
lung. His injuries aro fatal,
BIG FIRE THIS MORNING.
lluport's Building Badly Burnod Heavy
Damages,
This morning at 1:30 o'clock as Officer Wil
liams, of tho First Precinct, was patrolling his
beat, at tho corner of Seventh and D streets ho
heard several loud reports and Instantly
his attention was attracted to smoke and
flames that were Issuing from the fourth
story of tho building at Seventh aud I) streets,
occupied by C. Ruppert as a toy aud fancy
store. Officer Williams ran to Ninth.' and D
streets and turned in an alarm from box
129, and then seeing the necessity of
a general alarm pulled that in
also. Tho depaitnicnt. responded promptly,
aud every engine went immediately to work.
By this tlmo the lire had made good headway,
aud tho extreme noithern part of tho building
was burning very rapidly. Tho opinion of tho
police and firemen was that in tho place was
stored a largo quantity of firowotks, and they,
becoming ignited from spontaneous combus
tion, soon spread iuto a seething Are. Tho build
ingisa very high one, being five 6tories. of iron
and stone, and it was some tlmo before tho fire
men could get water on the burnlnsi part. Tho
building is occupied by II. Fianc, hattor and
clothier", at 401; C. Ruppert, -103, toys and
fancy goods; Relzenstela & Co., 405, clothiers;
while adjoining these Is the store of 11. Hoffa
that was burglailzcd so successfully lately.
The entire upper portion of the building
Is used by Mr. Ruppert for storage
aud show-rooms of his Immense stock
of toys, etc., a heavy cargo having
just been added to meet the Christmas trade, it
being estimated that his stock was worth fully
$100,000. Ho will be the principal loser, but
how much cannot be stated at this writing.
II. Franc escaped with but a slight
loss, while Reizenstelu will lose fully $10,000"by
damage from water alone. Hoffa will lose con
siderably by water.
SHORT IN HIS ACCOUNTS.
An EmPloyo of tho Potomac Steamboat
Company missing.
Special Despatch to Sunday Hekai.d.
Nonroi.ic, Va., Dec. 0. Charles B.Burke, the
confidential clerk to Geu. V. D. Gronor, of this
city, and chief cleric of the Potomac Steamboat
Company, the line plying between Washington
aud Norfolk, is missing and the detectives arc now
looking him up. There is said to bo a shortage
in his accounts of upward of S1,000. No one to
night can irivo any exact figures. Burko is mar
ried, and has moved in tlio best circles of Nor
folk society. Ho was looked on as a promising
man, aud no one had tho least suspicion of any
wrong-doing on his part. Lately ho took to
drink, and was living pretty high. The police of
other cities have been instructed to keep a
lookout for hiui. His wife loft Friday for Now
York to join relatives in that city. D.
The police authorities of Washington have
been informed of the embezzlement of funds in
Norfolk by Burke, and are watching for him.
The officers of the steamboat company here ex
press very little concern in the matter, as they
hold that Burke, being Gen. Grouer's clerk, tho
responsibility for tho loss will fall directly on
him. President Savago says he knew Burke,
having met him in Norfolk, but he know noth
ing definite of tho facts 6tated above, except he
knew Burke had been discharged.
A STEAMSHIP DISASTER.
A' Baltimore Steamer's Frightful Kxpori
enco in Monday's Hurricane.
Bai.timoiie, Dec. 0. The steamer Maryland,
of the Atlantic Transportation Line, of this
city, was caught in a hurricaue on December 1.
Capt. Lockhurst, tho second cook, and boat
swain were killed, and First Mate Lloyd had a
leg broken and was otherwise injured. Other
persons were injured aud hundreds of cattle
perished. Tho Maryland put Into Delawaro
Breakwater in distress this afternoon. She had
encountered tho fearful hurricane which swept
tho Atlautlc Coast on the 1st instant with fear
ful results. Sho was boarded by a terrific sea,
which dashed those on the deck In all direc
tions aud swept everything movable overboard.
The Maryland as sho sailed into tho Breakwater
carried her fiag at half-mast, tho corpse of her
unfortunate captain being on tho forward deck.
Tho two others killed were burled at sea.
All her boats except ouo were carried away.
At tho time tho Maryland encounted, tho hur
ricane she was 000 miles off tho cost. A heavy
sea on tho afternoon of December 1 carried
away tho bridge. At tho time Capt. Lockhurst
was on tho bridge, and it was supposed by tho
crew that ho had been washed overboad, but on
tho second day afterward his body was found
on top of the galley, which Is situated just aft
of the bridge,tho remains being eompletly hidden
Thero wero 520 head of cattle on tho vessel.
It was necessary to .close tho hatches to keep
tho water out of tho hold. This had a disas
trous effect on tho live 6tock, they being smoth
ered to death in droves. Two huudred dead
animals have already been thrown into tho sea,
and two hundred aro now dead in tho hold, but
the health authorities will not allow them to bo
thrown overboard.
Tho vessel's cargo will bo unloaded at
Philadelphia, and 6ho will go on tho dock for
repairs.
A Bill That Should Pass.
Mr. Bingham, of Pennsylvania, yesterday in
traduced in the House, a bill granting loavo of
absence with pay to clerks and letter-carriers of
tho post offices of tho country, who whilo iu tho
discharge of their duties may become injured.
Under tho law at present thero is uo way post
office employes can bo paid any salary whllo ill,
even though they were disabled in their offices.
Tho clerks of local post offices are tho worst
paid, tho loast thought of, aud tho hardest
worked men in tho Government service, and it
is to be hoped that this bill and somo others
that Mr. Biugham has introduced will become
laws. With all tho efforts for tho good of his
clerks and carriers Postmaster Sherwood, of
of this city, Is in full sympathy.
Important Railroad Extension.
Danvillk, Va., Dec. 0. A meeting of tho
Danvillo and East Tennesseo Railroad Company
was held hero to-day, and arrangements wero
perfected to build at ouco a new lino of road
from Dauvlllo to Bristol, Tenn., a distance of
200 miles. Tho road is to bo an extension of
tho Atlantic aud Danvillo Road, now operating
between Danvillo aud Norfolk, und when tho
eutlro Hue is built it will be practically a parallel
lino with tho Norfolk and Western Road.

THE BEST GOVERNED CITY.
SPICY DEBATE ABOUT AFFAIKS AT
THE NATION'S CAPITA!,.
Interesting Criticisms Upon Our System
of Gorcrnmcut An Anomaly, a Des
potism, a "Corroding Canker" The
Uace Question.
Tho merits and demerits of the picseut sys
tem of government in tho District of Columbia
were freely discussed in tho Senate yesterday in
connection with tho joint resolution reported
favorably by Chairman Ingalls, from tho Dis
trict Committee, providlug that two of the
three Commissioners of the District shall con
stitute a quorum, and that an engineer officer
detailed as a substitute for tho engineer com
missioner (whon absent or disabled) may per
form all the duties imposed by law upon tho
latter.
During the discussion Mr. Ingalls admitted
that tho government of thoDIstrictof Columbia
was an absolute despotism, an anomaly In mu
nicipal government. It was tho only place on
the continent, at least under tho American fiag,
whore the people had no voice whatever in tho
administration of their own local affairs. They
had nothing to say about the imposition of
taxes; they had no voice in the selection of
those who wero placed over them for the ad
ministration of tho functions of government,
and it was not wholly to the praise of
Republican institutions to say that "Washing
ton was tbo best governed city in
the United States. There was no community
of a similar number of men, women, and chil
dren where tho conditions of humuu happiness
weie so abundant aud where the conditions of
prosperity were more stable and permanent,
flic experiment of popular suffrage had been
tried iu Washington for a number of years, and,
after many years of experience, it had been de
liberately abolished by the concurrence (ho
thought the unanimous concurrence) of both
Houses of Congress, and with the approval of
all tho people of the District except those who
wanted to be in local offices.
It was no exaggeration to say that there was
no municipal community that was so well gov
erned, so cheaply governed, and so satisfactorily
governed as the city of Washington. He did
not propose to say that that was an intimation
that municipal government in other cities had
been wrongly conducted. Ke had no Inference
to draw.
Tbo government of the District of Columbia,
when compared with the government of cities
like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago,
St. Louis, or San Francisco, Is not open to
obnoxious criticism. Mr. Bluir did uot coincide
with Mr. Ingalls's statement, no believed tho
government of the District of Columbia to be a
despotism, a corroding canker at tho heart of
the Institutions of the United States, and he
believed that it was an instrumentality which
(if not extirpated) would ultimately lead to
disaster and troubles not different from those
arising to tho French Government from the
nature of Paris society. He did not believe
Washington to be a well governed city. There
might bo peace there, as iu Warsaw; but tho
people of the District of Columbia desired the
privileges of free men; aud, if the question wero
to-day put to a vote, nine-tenths of the peoplo
of tho District would vote for a popular form
of government.
Tho people desired representation in the Sen
ate and In tho House of Representatives, and
they ought to have It. The euloglum of tho
Senator from Kansas did not voice the princi
ples of tho American constitution of American
freedom.
The discussion was continued by Messrs.
Dolph, Stewart, Reagan, Allison, aud Morgan.
The latter compared the abolition of tho Dis
trict Government iu 1875 to tho burning of a
barn, in order to get rid of tho rats tho rats
being the negroes and tho "feather-duster
legislature." Thero might have been, ho said, a
reason for limiting tho amount of suflrago in tho
District, but there was uo reason for taking
from the enlightened peoplo aud property
owners of tho District a voice in tho Govern
ment merely becauso thero wero bad materials
among the then voters. Tho fact had been,
however, that iu tho face of tho Influx of ne
groes into tho District tlio Senate and Houso
had felt compelled, iu order to preserve prop
erty rights aud decency of administration in
tho District, to disfranchise every man so as to
get rid of negro suffrage. Ho know that it
would bo very offensive to tho sensibilities of
humantarians that colored men should not be
permitted to vote while tho bettor classes of
citizens were. One of these colored men, Fred
erick Douglas, had led to tho altar one
of tho brides of tho North, and had con
ferred great distinction upon her. It
was uot right that tho white mou of tho District
of Columbia (many of them ablo and learned
men) should bo put upou tho level of ponlten
tlary convicts disfranchised for what?
Merely becauso they wero neighbors of tho
negro, merely becauso they lived in tho same
community, merely becauso tho nogroes could
either outvote them or could Infuse into the
ballot box so much of tho colored ballot as to
make peace and order unsafe
Mr. Blair took exception to Mr. Morgan's
allusion to tho colored question and to Fred
Douglas, and 6aid that tho fact of Mr. Douglas
having taken a white Northern brido was not
an undivided honor coming to tho
North exclusively from tho colored
race. Ho reminded Mr, Morgan
that tho world was indebted to ono of tho
prominent whlto fathers of tho South for Mr,
Douglas himself, and expressed tho opinion
that tho relations of Mr, Douglas to his
Northern brido were as houorablo to that sec
tion aud to his own race and to all races as tho
relations between that white father and tho
dusky maldeu who was tho mother of Douglas.
Tho Presiding Officer Interrupted Mr. Blair's
remarks at 2 o'clock, when the Election bill
came up in order, and Mr. Hoar declined tho
request to let that bill stand aside temporarily
till he would concludo what ho desired to say.
So the quorum question was laid asldo until
to-morrow morning.

PARNEMi DESERTED.
Kxcltlng Meeting, from "Which McCarthy
nnd Others Withdrew.
London, Dec. C At the opening of tho meet
ing of the Irish Parliamentary party to-day Mr.
Parnoll said they wero assembled to receive tho
report of tho delegates on tho conferenco with
Mr. Gladstone. Mr. Kenny proposed
that the delegates retire to pro
pare their report. Mr. Hcaly said
thero was no ncccssl.1 retire, as tho delegates
had agreed on the mutter. Ho opposed any
further suspension of the pioceedings. A reso
lution that the delegates retire to prepare their
report was put and defeated by a vote of 34 to
25. Mr. Hcaly then proposed that all
the communications which had passed
between the Irish Parliamentary party
and tho Liberal leaders be read. After
a prolonged squabble over this proposal, Mr.
Healy moved that the chairman read tho whole
of the documents bearing on the position. Mr.
Parucll objected. He insisted that the dele
gates prepare a report of their interview with
Mr. Gladstone, and submit it to tho
meeting This course, he said, was
absolutely necessary In order to
put tho public in possession of all the facts.
This caused a heated debate. Mr. Sexton Anally
said that ho aud his friends felt that theso in
tolerable proceedings should be brought to a
close, if not by tho action of tho chair, by somo
other means. If his friends, ho said, were in
tho minority they would gladly retire. But the
fact that they were iu the majority placed
the obligation upon them to exercise their
powers.
At the conclusion of the reading of the re
port thero was a scene of great confusion. Mr.
Abraham and Mr. Johu O'Connor rose from
their seats simultaneously, when Mr. Parnell
declared that the latter had tho floor. Then fol
lowed a bitter personal dispute between Mr.
Parnell aud others, whose utterances
could not be distinguished, so great
waB the noise and confusion. Tim
othy Healy made himself heard as he
shouted "who is to be mistress of the party ?"
(Cries of "shame" camo from all parts of the
room, and William Redmond shouted: "They
must bo badly off to resort to argumeuts like
that")
Mr. Parnell referred to Healy as a cowardly
little scoundrel, who dared in an assembly of
Irishmen to insult a woman. This denuncia
tion of Healy was received with chceis and
counter cheers.
Mr. Justin McCarthy got tho lloor to close
the debate. He did not desire to increase the
bitterness engendered by tho crisis. Ho had
hoped up to last night that Parnell would still
help them out of their terrible uatioual diffi
culty. He was disappointed. Mr. Parnell had
lent them no assistance out of their dilemma, ne
felt that it would be a waste of time to discuss
the matter fuithcr, since it had been made
clear that the door would be barred against
any definite settlement iu that room. Ho sug
gested that all agreeing with him withdraw.
Whilo the members were leaving Mr. Justiu
Huutly McCarthy explained, amid much inter
ruption, that he was sorry for the decision, but
would go with tho party.
Mr. Parnell was left in the room with the
Messrs. John and William Redmond, Leamy,
O'Kelly, Byrne, Blane, Corbett, John and
Joseph Nolan, Maguire, Harrison, Dalton,
William McDonald, Conway, Quinn, Clancy
Mahony,Hayden, Fitzgerald, Harrington, Rich
ard Power, Shell, Campbell, John O'Connor,
Dr. Keuuy, and McKeuua, and the meeting was
resumed.
Others having spoken, Mr. Parucll said:
"The deserters, knowing we wero going to
Ireland to-morrow, clamored for a decision,
becauso they dreaded the lightning of public
opinion in lrelaud. They recoiled before this
opinion when they fled from this room.
Gentlemen, wo have won to-day. Loud
cheers. Although our ranks are reduced, I
hold this chair still. Cheers. Although many
comrades have left us Ireland has power to fill
their places and send as good men and true for
every ono of thoso who have left us, and I little
know our gallant country if I am mistaken in
the opinion that when she gets au opportunity
she will freely exercise the power. They
have left this room because they saw that their
position was uo longer tenable, becauso they
saw arrayed against them a force before which
wc must all bow, aud without which nono of us
would over have been hero. Thoy stand iu a
most contemptible position that of men
who, having pledged ttiemselves to bo true to
their party, to their leader, and to their
country, have been false to all." (Loud
cheers.)
John O'Connor's resolution was thou put
and carried by acclamation, and tho meeting
dispersed.
The proceedings of tho McCarthy section were
conducted in private,
When Mr. McCaithy had assumed tho chair
tho meeting proceeded to consider tho follow
ing resolutions, proposed by Timothy llealy
aud seconded by Mr. Sexton:
"We, members of the Irish Parliamentary
party, solemnly reuow our adhesion to tho
principle, in devotion to which wo have uover
wavered, that tho Irish party Is and always
must remain independent of all other parties.
"Further, wo declaio that wo will never en
tertain any proposal for a settlement of tho
homo rule question, except such as satlfles tho
aspirations of tho Irish party and tho Irish peo
plo." Tlio resolution was uuauimously adopted.
Tho result was immediately communicated to
Mr. Gladstone. Upon learning what had been
done, Mr. Gladstone exclaimed: "Thank God,
homo rule is saved."
After the withdrawal of Mr. McCarthy and
tho other anti-Parnell members tho supporters
of Mr. Parnell adopted resolutions expressing
regret at Mr, Gladstone's refusal to state his
views on tho ques tlous submitted to him, and
then ratified tho reelection of Mr, Parnoll as
chairman.
Tho McCarthy party aro now preparing a
manifesto to tho Irish peoplo.

WANT DEMOCRATIC BLOOD.
THE INDIANA KEPUUI.ICAN CI.TJK
OKIES AI.OUB FOR A CLEAN SWEEP.
'Tuwsn't thoMcKinloy Bill, Nor tho Force
-uli Bui. 'Twns tho Slownoss of tho Ad
ministration in Turning Out Domocrnts
that Caused tho Novcinhor Landslide.
Tho Indiana Republicans in Washington want
blood rich, and Democratic blood. They don't
want it individually nor for tho gratification of
any mere privato thirst for gore. But thoy
hanker after It collectively as members of tho
G. O. P., and for tho good of that apparently
moribund organization. They mado public
their yearnings last night at a meeting which
thoy held iu Grand Army Hall, aud they did
it at considerable length and with a vigor of
emphasis that must have rattled the crockery
up at the Whlto House. Whether they in
tended to produce this latter effect or not
is uot cutircly clear, but thero aro
good grounds for believing that
thoy did. Some of tho speeches which wero
mado at tho meeting wero of a character that
the cool and placid little gentleman, who at
present presides over tho destiny of the nation,
would not have enjoyed hearing. Thoy didn't
exactly go 60 far as to attack Mr. Harrison;
openly, but thero was a spirit about them that
meant volumes in tho way of condemnation of
his course iu retaining Democrats in oflico
whilo thousands of tho faithful hungered and
thirsted out in tho cold of private life.
It was a meeting of this Indiana Republican
Club, and after transacting somo routine busi
ness and admitting several new members, tho
pent-up feelings of tho faithful Hoosiers found
vent in vigorous speech. The result of the late
elections was discussed and the causes of the
crushing defeat of the Republicans analyzed,
and they wore generally agreed not to have
been tho McKiulcy bill nor tho Force bill, by a
large majority. Tho course of the Administra
tion in retaining Democrats in office, It was
agreed, with mingled sorrow and anger, had
had a great deal to do with it; and it
was unanimously resolved that the future
of the G. O. P., which involves, of course, the
future of the Union, of Christian civilization
and of the human race, depends on incon
tinently firing tho last man of these Democrats
out. Among thoso who held forth in perfcrvid
addresses to tho above effect were Messrs. W.
W. Curry, Weaver, and Bryer, and Gen. J. J.
Reynolds. After the feelings of the assemblage
had been worked up to a proper heat, they
were poured forth in a set of resolutions of
great length and complexity.
Tho resolutions begin by reciting "That pa
tronage strengthens political organizations
when properly distributed to active and deserv
ing party workers; that there are yet, after a
lapse of nearly two years of Republican rule,
hundreds of Democrats and non-residents of
the several States holding positions under tho
Government to which they are not cutitled by
reason of saidnon-rcsldcnce and abandonment
of party affiliation; and that said Democrats
and non-residents are in many instances le
tained at tho solicitation and endorsements of
statesmeu and politicians of high standing in
our party, the same being erroneous and deplor
able from a part' standpoint." Theu the reso
lutions go ou to solemnly declaro "That tho
retention of this class of employes contributed
its share to our defeat at the late election,
causing in many instances a feeling of apathy
and disinterestedness on the part of many
worthy aspirants for promotion and otherrecog
nitton at the hands of the several departmental
heads, tho same being au opeu insult to tho
competency and ubillty of members of our
grand old paity, especially so in tho
Bureaus in which tho Civil Service law
has no jurisdiction, where division chiefs
and preferred ofllclal positions aro continued to
political mugwumps and offensive party
enemies on the grounds that they are indis
pensable. Having thus laid bare tho evils which led to
tho deplorable results in November tho angry
Hoosiers expressed their condemnation of
them and pointed out the remedy as follows:
Therefore, be It
Iicaolved, by tho Indianapolis Kcpublloan Club,
of Wasliiugton.D. C, that wo earnestly condemn
retaining in position to tlio detriment of com
petent aspirants of our own party tho abovo
classes of einployiis, and that it is tho sense of
this clubjthat tho party's success would bogreatly
enhanced if just recognition weio given to thoso
cutitled through years of earnest and ollcctivo
labor iu behalf of our great causo; and that tho
appointment of tried and true Republicans is
