CLEARFIELD, PA., DEC. 12, 1866.
Arrest of John H. Surratt.
Oar readers will doubtless remember that
John H, Sorratt, who was implicated in
the assassination of President Lincoln, made
his escape, and that his whereabouts have
remained well concealed ever since. The
evidence taken before the Military Com
mission in June, 1865, proved that he was
one of the principal conspirators. It was
at the house of his mother that the meet
ings were held ; he made frequent journeys
to Richmond ; Booth was his constant com
panion; Dr. Mudd concealed him in the
woods near hu Louse ; Payne consulted
with him ; and Atzerodt confessed that he
was induced by Surratt to join the conspiracy.
Up to the 3d of April none of the princi
pals were so frequently seen, yet on the af
ternoon of the 14th he was seen for the last
time, booted and spurred, ready for his es
cape. From that time the very existence
of John Surratt was a mystery ; it was be
lieved that he was either dad, or having
revealed the names of - his associates in
crime, had been permitted to escape. It
was noted that no reward was offered for
his arrest. And as time passed on, John
Surratt was nearly forgotten, when the other
day came the electrifying news' that he had
been arrested by the American Consul-Gen
eral in Egypt.
Of his wandei ings, little is known. It is
paid that he was recognized on a Liverpool
steamer shortly after the murder. Then
came the rumor that he was serving as a
private soldier in the Pope's Guards at
Rome. We know now that he had been a
soldier in the Papal Zouaves at Veroli, and
served under the name of Jobn Watson.
The fact became known to Mr. Rufus King,
our Minister at Rome, who telegraphed to
our Government, and wad instructed to se
cure his arrest. Sir. King conferred with
Cardinal Antonelli, who issued an order for
his seizure. Surratt was taken ; he was
imprisoned ; and on removal from jail,
' guarded by five soldiers, broke from their
hands, jumped, it is said, over a precipice
more than 100 feet high, and escaped into
the Italian territory. Mr. Marsh, our Min
ister at Florence, obtained telegraphic instruc
tions from the Italian Government to have
all the seaports of Italy watched to prevent
his escape. He was soon supposed to have
embarked in a steamer for Malta, and a dis
patch to the island arrived too late to de
tain him ; another was sent to Alexandria,
and when Surratt stepped upon the shores
of Egypt, he was seized by the strong, far
reaching arm of America. United States
detectives, it is said, have watched him since
October. But long before this he must
have been overtaken by a speedier, surer foe.
Fear was ever at his back ; from remorse he
could hardly escape, for even if he could
forget the crime he had committed, how
could he ever cease to see the. phantom of
his mother on the gallows? Coward all the
world believed hini, since the day when he
fled and left her to suffer ; a coward, it was
said, she held him, and in her last moments
refused to hear his name.
New revelations are expected from the
trial of Surratt. In this tho public may,
however, be disappointed ; but there can
be no doubt that, if he could be induced to
confess, he could give a correct account of
the assassination of Mr. Lincoln.
Another Conversion. Marvelous as
it may seem it is nevertheless a fact, that
' the Philadelphia Age is a convert to the
new faith as propounded by the Chicago
limes. It even goes further and heartily
endorses the nomination and election of a
negro to office as a member of the Massa
chusetts Legislature. ' It says t "For our
own part we heartily indorse tho nomina
tion. We believe that the color of the skin
is no badge of dishonor, and when qualified
by education to hold the; ballot, the man
should be eligible to office. The nominee,
we hear, is a man of sense and sagacity, and
will do no discredit to the State." When
will wonders cease ? -
Dkcision in a Deserter Case. Two
election officers ot Nippenose township were
, tried at the recent Court in Lycoming coun
ty, for having refused to take the vote ot
J as. S. Stewart, a deserter from the draft.
The Jury rendered a verdict of, Not Guilty,
Th Law Judge of the county, Hon. A.
Jordan, is a Democrat, and, we presume,
charged the Jury that th officers- bad only
obeyed their oaths, and that the State law
had disqualified deserters from voting; ami
the Jury decided accordingly. ; :
The Legislature of Alabama has rejected
. the Constitutional Amendment by a large ;
majority, and it is significant that Mr. John
son's opposition to it was ' quoted as an ar
gument by its enemies.
.. Wrangles of the Democracy. j
The LatterDay Democracy, it seems, are
having a rather"happy time"at settling their
political family differences. The advocacy
of negro suffrage by the Chicago Times,
Boston Port, and other influential journals
of the party, is being bitterly denounced
by such of their organs as arc ''joined to their
old idols." Thus we find an article from
the N. Y. Dny-Bwjh co'pied into the last
Clearfield Republican, which pours a per
fect broadside of vituperation and condem
nation into such "Democratic journals and
leaders", as "have been doing all they could
"for five or six years to educate the people
"in the Black Republican abomination of
"loyalty." Says the Day-Book:
"These Democratic leaders went over
themselves into the filthy slough ot Black
Republican loyalism alias despotism, alias
devilism, of every infernal type, and did
their utmost to drag the people after them,
and now are trying to drag them out again
with just about the same kind of ropes or
principles, with which they dragged them
in. Vain attempt ! Worse than vain to at
tempt to drag the people out of the Aboli
tion slough with Abolition ropes ! . . . The
organization, the machinery of the party,
is worn out and broken in the service of its
enemies. It smells at once of the stench of
negroes and the blood of white men ! It is
loathesome to every Democrat, that is, to
every Democrat who has refused to be a par
ty to the stupendous crime of the Abolition
war. If the Democratic party, we say. ev
er returns to power, it must be by other
means than this old,filthy, venal, bloody, ne
jrroized machinery of the party organiza
tion." That is, surely, not a very flattering ac
count of the condition ot their party, but
as the Day-Book and Clearfield Republican
are organs in good standing with the Lat-ter-Day
Democracy, we must take it for
granted that they "know whereof they af
firm," and hence that their representations
are correct. They not only thus admit that
their organization is in a sorry plight,, but
they assert that
"The attempt to make it a mulatto party,
or something between a white man and a
negro, has resulted in nothing but disgrace
ful and continuous defeat. Thee cunning
or rather foolish leaders have been trying to
split the difference between a white man
and a negro, and the result is, that they
have made political Mongrels of them
selves." That sounds like harsh language, but it
must not be forgotten that we are quoting,
italics and all, from the Clearfield Republi
can, it is in the columns of that pa
per that we find these bitter accusations.
Nor is this a'L Prominent Democrats who
took part in the 1 4th of August Conven
tion at Philadelphia are also dealt some
heavy blows. . That assemblage is stigma
tized as
"A bastard concern, where the marplots
of one section held their bloody hands over
the voiceless mouths and choked throats of
the other section, reading them lessons of
reprcof and submission. If there is any
man who bore a prominent part in it, who
is not already ashamed of both its action and
its results, let us believe that he is past
blushing."
It must be highly refreshing to Chairman
Wallace, ex-Gov. Bigler, and other Demo
crats of our town who "bore a prominent
part" in that Convention, to be told by their
home organ that if they are not "ashamed
of both its its action and its result," that
they are "past blushing" that the "politi
"cal offspring born ot such an embrace
"the white State of South Carolina hugging
"the black State of Massachusetts could
"be nothing but a mongrel brat." We
should think that such "left-handed" com
pliments would be comforting, in an emi
nent degree, to our "distinguished fellow
citizens" who attended that celebrated con
vocation of heterogeneous political spirits.
Whilst the organs of the Latter-Day De
mocracy, from which we are quoting, are
thus disgusted with the course of "many"
journals and leaders of their party, it must
not be supposed that they are at a loss for a
remedy. "An early great Convention of
"the true old Democracy of the States," is
suggested as a sovereign balm for the com
plication of ills, that is now racking the body
of their distracted organization. It is to
be composed, not of the "black and mu
"latto politicians that have been holding
"their conventions all around," but it is to
be made up of "genuine white politicians,"
of "brave and true patriots," like the edi
tors of the Day-Book and Republican, we
presume. None of those "who are foolish
"enough to think they can hold the Radical
"bull by the tout" are expected to intrude ;
but only "those who mean to seize the beast
"by the horns," "who want the Union as
"it vms and the Constitution as it was"
are invited to attend. "Such a Conven
tion," it is hoped by its brilliant projectors,
"might start an enthusiasm which will
"arouse the sleepy ear of the old Domocra
"cy again, and give us at least one campaign
"in which Democrats shall not be in doubt
"whether they are running a Democratic or
"a Black Republican platform." We trust
this enterprise will be encouraged by the
"faithful." As all other "conventions"
held by the Democracy, for some years past,
have proved rather harmless affairs, we want
to see what one, gotten up on the high
pressure prinoiple, may do." We would,
however, kindly suggest to our neighbor and
to his New York cotemporary, that they had
better secure the services of a vigilant in
spector, so that the Democratic "mulatto
politicians' ' who have been running the 'ma.
c-hinery" that "smells of the stench of ne
groes and the blood of white men," are not
!crmitted to get inside, or those "negro-
ized" leaders will force the editors of the
Day-Book and Republican- to place the
Democratic party again on what they term
the "prostituted, bloody, negro-worshipping
basis of loyalty."
The Mexican Muddle.
The reported action of Marshal Bazaine,
commander-in-chief of the French forces in
Mexico in giving arms and ammunition to
the partizans of Ortega, indicates the possi
bility of a new complication in that country.
Jaurcz and Ortega are rival claimants for
the Mexican Presidency. Neither was cho
sen to fill that office at the proper time and
in the proper constitutional way. Contin
ued military disturbances prevented a pence
ful election. Both base their claims
on their former position as Chief Jus
tice of .the Supreme Court, that officer
being the proper incumbent of a vacant
Presidential chair. The issue between them
is whether the old Chief Justice or the new
one has the best claim to authority. Our
Government has not only refused to recog
nize any other ruler than Jaurez, but it ar
rested Ortega when ha was attempting to
enter Msxico. France appearsas anxious to
favor his cause as we were to oppose it, and
thus the two great nations most deeply in
terested espouse the claims of opposing can
didates. It is to be hoped that this dispute
will not lead to our entanglement in a war
of succession, after the fashion of the fa
mous old conflicts of Europe.
The Course op the Democrats in Con
grkss. The Democrats in Congress are
said to have agreed to wait for s. methins
to turn up, in the hope that, as the only
chance, the Republicans will commit some
excess, of which advantage can be taken.
Not much opposition will be made to mea
sures, however extreme, which, considering
how utterly powerless they are, is very con
siderate. Tte President in adhering to the
"My Policy" doctrine, took their advice,
that he might not appear to be inconsistent,
although no one doubted that his policy was
a failure. It is evident the Democrats and
the President have heard how the elections
went.
. Threatens to Rebel. The Richmond
Enquirer, alarmed at the indications of a
disposition on the part of Congress to dis
mantle the Southern rebel governments set
up by "Andrew Johnson, has the audacity
to threaten a new revolt if this policy is
pursued. It says that "the President is
bound by his oath to maintain the State gov
ernments in their just rights, and any at
tempt to abolish them by Congress, as pro
posed by the caucus, tcoubl necessitate a col
lision." These are brave words, but the
time has gone by when the Representatives
of the American people are to be intimidat
ed by arrogant Southern traitors.
Served Them Right. The Republican
U. S. Senators, in the. re arrangement of
the standing committees, deprived Doolittle,
Cowan and Dixon of their chairmanships.
Doolittle, who was next to Sumner on the
Committee of Foreign Relations has been
placed at the foot. Ramsey is head of the
Post Office Committee, vice Dixon, dis
placed, and Henderson is made chairman ot
Indian Affairs instead of Doolittle ; while
Cowan is transferee! from the head to the
foot of the Committee on Patents.
The Indian Troubles. The casual
reader has, probably, not fully compre
hended the nature of the difficulties with
the Indians in our Western States and
Territories. The extent ot these troubles
may, however, be inferred from the fact re
ported by the Secretary ot War to the House
of Representatives, in answer to a resolution
of inquiry, that the total amount expended
for the suppression of Indian-hostilities, for
the year 1864 and 1865, is $30,500,001).
Martial Law in Missouri The Gov
ernor of Missouri has been compelled to
place several of the western counties of that
State, which are inhabited principally by
rebels, under martial law, to secure the life
and property of Union men. This exhibi
tion of their prescriptive feelings in a Com
monwealth under the control of a loyal Leg
islature and Executive illustrates the dan
gers to which Unionists of States domina
ted by rebel Governors are subjected.
U. S. Troops in Mexico. We have at
length a trustworthy statement that Mata
moras was occupied by the United States
troops under Gen- Sedgwick. This was done
under the protest of saving American citi
zens from plundering operations. General
Sheridan, acting under an order from Gen.
Grant, has relieved Gen. Sedgwick of his
command and placed him under arrest The
U. S. Troops have since been withdrawn
from Matamoras.
The Chinese at Pekin have been eleven
months without rain or snow. This is in
China a great public calamity, which is
sought to be averted by fasting, prayer and
expiatory ceremonies. In the Summer of
1S64 the drouth was so great that the Em
peror himself made a vow to "rectify his
conduct and be more anxious for the wel
fare of his people. "
" John S. Rock, Esq., the well known col
ored lawyer, of Boston, died a few dava
since at his residence in Phillips street, of
consumption. A short time ago, on motion"
of Hon. Charles Sumner, he was admitt?d I
to practice in the United States Supreme
Court at Washington, "beinjr the first color
ed man who ever enjoyed that privilege.
The President's Message.
It is not so much what the President says
as whafhe declines to say. The first im
pression of the message is that his Excellen
cy is chastened. He makes no allusions to i
Congress hanging on the verge of the Gov
ernment. This is something from an Exec
utive who has been in the most unreasona
ble humor for so many months. Mr. Pierce
could not have written a weaker massage.
Congress would as readily have heard an es
say upon the cause of thunder as this tame
and harmless disquisition. There is much
that the President regrets. There are some
good words from Washington and Jefferson,
likewise J ackson. We marvel that his Ex
cellency neglected the other fathers of their
country. " For any living fact, for any sug
gestion, for any helpful thought, we might
as well turn to the last novel of Trollope as
to the President's message. Ephraim
seems irrevocably joined to his idols.
There is much that Mr. Johnson might
have done. He has missed many golden
opportunities but none so glorious as this.
Congress came from the people'magnanimous
and kind. There was no disposition to re
member anything that had been done not
even the shameless antagonism to the peo
ple in the recent elections. All good men
trusted that one word might be said which
would show a disposition on the part of the
President to reach a solution of the many
difficulties surrounding the country. All
that his Excellency has done was no longer
remembered when we saw the peace he
might bring to a harrassed nation, loving
kindness and rest. We believe that there
was no feeling of resentment to the Presi
dent, not even in the hearts of the most
Radical members of Congress, that would
not have given way before the slightest ten
dency of the President to hantonize the
country. In his Message he shows no such
tendency. He clings to his dogmas with as
much tenacity as when he hoped to carry
the country in the late elections. There is
not one word fcr the negro not one word
lor the loyal in the South not one sen
tence which might not as well have been
written a hundred 5-ears ago as to-day, for
all the truth and cemfort it brings.
In a mere business way the Message is of
little importance. It refers briefly to the
Treasury Report, advocating thorough re
retrenchment, and the other Reports of the
Departments, but makes no suggestion of
importance. Mr. Johnson thinks the Pa
cific railroad will be finished before the time
set by Congress as a limit ; advises such leg
islation as n ay be necessary to preserve the
Mississippi Levees ; urges the importance
of admitting to Congress a delegate from
the District of Columbia, and touches up
on the aid that body should give to the ef
fort of the Southern States to reorganize
their agriculture. He congratulates the
couutry on peace with foreign nations and
the success of the Atlantic telegraph, and
thinks there is reason to expect greater re
suits from the projected Pacific line by way
of Behring's Straits. The Mexican ques
tion is briefly alluded to. Gen. Sherman's
mission being said to be the obtaining of in
formation necessary to maintain proper in
tercourse with the republic of Mexico. "It
stemed an obvious duty on our part," he
adds, "to exercise whatever influence we
possessed for the restoration and perma
nent establishment in that country of a re
publican form of government." A clearer
account of the object of sending Gen. Sher
man with Minister Campbell would have
been desirable. Complaint is made that
France has broken its compact with our
Government, by declining to remove any of
its troops in Mexico till next Spriftg. The
United States have protested against this
determination, and the President trusts
that the Emperor will recede from his pres
ent ground. He regrets that the Alabama
claims have not been settled by Great Brit
ain, but thinks there is reason to expect our
demands will be met in a friendly spirit
He condemns the Fenian invasion of Cana
da ; thinks mercy should be extended to
the prisoners ; thinks Congress ought to do
something for the rights of American citi
zens abroad, and without referring to their
wrongs at home, as illustrated by the New
Orleans massacre and such trifles, closes
with the customaty prayer.
We have no heart to dwell upon this
dreary, lifeless document. There is noth
ing that any loyal man can read with com
foit or hope. Andrew Johnson is as much
an eneniy as when he menaced the nation
from his White House steps ten months ago.
He does not mean to help us in the work of
reconstruction. The' duty devolving upon
Congress becomes more solemn and respon
sible, and we look to Congress with infinite
yearning. Let there be kindness 'and pa
tience, charity toward all, malice toward
none, firmness and devotion ; but above all,
a single hearted determination, come well
or ill, despite Presidents or Cabinets, to la
bor without ceasing, until over this land
there shall be peace and rest, liberty and
protection, and all rights for all. X. Y.

Secretary McCulloch's statement of the
public debt on Dec 1st shows that, deduc
ting $135,364,637 in the Treasury, the total
is $2,549,631,238. The report does not
compare these figures with those of last
year. Nov. 30, 1865, less cash in the Treas
ury, the debt was $2,714,633,314, which
shows a decrease of $165,002,076.
The reception j of a satisfactory reply
from the Emperor of France to the note of
Mr. Seward, concerning the speedy evac

the anxiety which has been felt on the sub
ject for the last week. The evacuation, it
is said, is to be in good time.

him with a hatchet.
Venango County. Hon. C. V. Culver,
now held in custody by the civil law, was
brought before Judge Trunkey, at Frank
lin, on Dec. 6th, on a writ of habeas cor
pus, and asked to be discharged on the
ground that he was a member of the Thirty-ninth
Congress from the Twentieth Con
gressional district of Penn'a. After able
arguments by counsel on both sides, Judge
Trunkey decided that a member of Congress
was. not entitled to his privilege when held
for an indictable offence.
Blair County. Milton Stevens, aged
sixteen years, and another boy named John
Jones, aged thirteen years, had a quarrel on
the 28th Nov., in Hollidaysburg, during the
course of which J ones threw a piece of iron,
striking Stevens on the temple, and so com
pletely stunning him that he died at 10 o'
clock the saute evening. Young Jones was
arrested and entered bail, in the sum of $2,
000, for his appearance at Court. . . Three

Washington County. Robert W. Dins
more, a thriving farmer, residing about five
miles from Washington, in Hopewell town
ship, was murdered in cold blood on the
night of Dec. 4th. He had been to town
trying to get a $1,000 bond changed, and
returned home late in the evening. At
about 10 o'clock he was called to the door
by a rap, when he was told that a neighbor
was sick and asked that one of the boys
should be permitted to go there. On re
plying that he had no boys, the two assail
ants sprung upon him, and in the struggle
that followed Mr. Dinsmore was sliot and
cut in the breast in such a manner 'that
death ensued in about three hours. Mrs.
Dinsmore was a spectator to the horrib'e
tragedy, fright restraining her from getting
away. A little daughter making a noise up
stairs, scared the villians away before they
got any plunder A man named Robert
bogle was next day arrested, and on search
ing his room a suit of clothes, covered with
mud, 3 pir ot boots with one heel off,
were discovered. A heel that fitted ti e
boot nicely beini found at the scene of the
murder, see-med to fix the deed upon Fogle
beyond a doubt. Finding the evidence so
strong again t him, he confessed that he
and a boy. about 17 years of age. named Wm.
Montgomery, had committed the murder,
which they had plotted three weeks before.
Montgomery, it is sloped, will also be ar
