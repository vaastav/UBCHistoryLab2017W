THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
President Roosevelt's message to congress is one of the
longest and most interesting documents ever submitted to the
national legislature. It sets forth in clear terms the ideas of
one of the most positive, ablest and aggressive men that have
ever filled the presidential office, covering the entire field of
vital questions now before the people. For a number of years
past these messages have been growing in length, owing" to
the argumentative [style which has been of late introduced
into their make-up. It is not enough nowadays to state the
policies recommended, but the reasons are given why they
should be adopted- While there is no indication' of a back
down from the path of enforcing the law known as the inter
state commence act against the powerful corporations which
have heretofore never felt the controling force of the law, the
document partakes of a conciliatory and conservative rather
than a radical tone. Amendments are recommended for the
purpose of dealing fairly and generously with the giant cor
porations which are part and parcel of our national life.
Still the position is strenuously maintained that the govern
ment must exercise such control over these vast concerns as
will insure the best interests of the commonwealth. Among
other things the president recommends:
A revision of the banking laws, and a more elastic cur
rency.
Income and inheritance taxes as a means of reducing over
grown fortunes.
A limitation of courts in the issuance of writs of injunction.
Compensation for accidents to workmen in federal employ,
and the extension of the eight-hour law.
The compulsory submission of labor' disputes to arbitra-
The establishment of the postal savings banks.
That the products of child labor should be barred from
entering inter-state commerce.
A revision of the tariff is not recommended at/ this session,
on the ground that the time is too short to permit of such an
undertaking, and also that it would be inadisable to attempt

repeal of the tariff on wood pulp, however, is :' recommended
at the urgent request of the newspaper publishers.

A Pretty Sight
Last Sunday four of our town boys
secured some whiskey in some way.
and before they had finished they
bad become -drunker than lords. They
went vp oofn f the hills back of town,
and passed the time riding cows, and
various other stunts. When they
came back to/town a couple of them
were pretty badly cut up, as the re
sult of falling off the animals. It is
more than likely that the boys stole
the whiskey, bat some one wants to
keep: a closet eye on these lads, for
they are all under atse.

Red Berries
Abundant H^re
: Somo parts of the state are'com
plaining that there -is a scarcity -of
the red berry thi3 year, that is that
they are not so plentiful as they
were last. JBut in this section they
are more plentiful if anything, liven
before the flrst of October tbo berries
we're in full bloom. The weather has
been ideal this year for , tramping
over the hills in search of them, and
every day or two some one would go
oat and bring in a big bunch.
What has buen scarce this year- ia
the mushroom. ". Usually they appear
after he first good rain, bat as yet we
have had no 'rain.' to^epeak of.
Numerous people went oat after each
rain, but aa yet { wo have failed to
hear of anyone finding very many.
Probably after this rain j they may
come up, though it is ratbei late.

as mercury will surely destroy the sense

California Promotion Y
Committee Report.
Keports received by the California"
Promotion Committee from the . gold
mining districts, indicate great activ
ity, with heavy output.: California
has given to the world, since gold was'
discovered in the state, a total 'of .■
more than'Sl, soo,ooo,ooo worth of the
metal, and indications are that there
will be greater developments than ever
with modern methods that "are now
being used in all the mining dis
tricts.: .During the month just- past
there has been increased inquiry into,
mining opportunities. In November^
California gold mines produced over
31,500,000.
Kailroad building continues, i.botb.
in steam and electric lines, and . the
demand for labor shows ;no slacken
ing. •_ In manufacturing lines* the "re :
ports show continued prosperity. 5
AH crops have . been harvested,^' arid
the returns have been better than .was
expected. . Harvesting of the citrus
crop has begun, - and already; many,
carloads have gone to Eastern[market3
from points iv the inferior 'valley 1\ :
■ From returns . made by ,. railroads,'
more ; than 100,000 people came Ito
California on colonists' rates during
the two seasons of 1907. Ihese new
settlers have been distributed all over
the state, and ; their coming has been
of material help in the subdivision of
large tracts of land. Keports received
by: the committee from its eastern
affiliations indicate . that .there is ' a
very general inquiry about California
from prospective settlers.
