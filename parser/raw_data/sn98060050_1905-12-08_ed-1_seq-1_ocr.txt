THE ESTEY POLICY.
The numerous pianos designated as
"stencils" are pianos which cannot be
traced to the factory in which they were
made. Such pianos have no standing, and
no firm can be held responsible for them.
The Estey Company takes pride in the
fact that it does not carry in stock an in
strument of such a "paste." Every instru
ment it handles is of known origin, either
an Estey or some other reputable make.

Says He Paid for Protection.
Because a posse of 17 United States and
Canadian olllclnls descended upon the
famous "line house" at Rlchford, owned
by A. B. Chapelle, and seized liquor worth
$700, he was arrested and brought to Bur
lington Wednesday by a deputy United
States marshal and arraigned before Com
missioner George F. Johnson, who held
him for the federal courts.
Chapelle said that he had for years paid
officials in Rlchford for protection, and
that he has known when his place was
to be searched. His present trouble was
caused by temperance forces, he said, who
had special deputies appointed to make
the raid. He said he knew the raid was
to be made, but supposed It would be
similar to those made In previous years.
Chapelle's place of business Is partly
In Canada and partly In the United States,
nnd when searches have been previously
made his stock of goods would always be
across the lino, no matter from which
side the search was made. Tho Joint
search made this play Ineffective.
Shooting Affray at Walllngford.
Fred Dumas and an Italian, whose name
Is unknown, were shot about midnight
Thursday night near Walllngford, by
Charles Hawkins, the Italian being seri
ously wounded, while Dumas's condition
is not considered dangerous. Hawkins
went home In an Intoxicated condition
and abused his wife. She ran to a neigh
bor's for assistance, Dumas, a brother of
Mrs. Hawkins, and an Italian responded
to the appeal. As they approached Haw
kins came out and gave each a charge
from a double-barrelled shot gun. Cons
table C. I HIgglns of Walllngford ar
rested Hawkins and brought him to Rut
land, where he was lodged In Jail, charged

The President's Message.
Too long.
That's the main criticism of the Presi
dent's message.
It Is the most formidable document In
length any Resident has ever sent to
Congress. Its rending occupied threo
houis at the session of Congress Tuesday
nnd entirely reproduced It would 1111 three
full luges of u paper like Tho Phoenix.
Not ono citizen In 11 hundred has rend it
word for word.
The first main section, which Is devoted
to a consideration of corporations and of
their supervision nnd regulation by federal
authority, attracts lending attention.
The President is awaro of the difficulties
In the way of this undertaking, but ho
urges that Congress shall exercise Its
authority as far ns the constitution will
nllow. If this prove Ineffective, "It will
certainly be necessary ultimately to con
fer in fullest form such power upon the
national government by a proper amend
ment of the constitution." While corpora
tions have done nnd aro doing much good,
and are not to be regarded In any spirit
of hostility, they must bo restrained from
doing wrong by "a sovereign whoso Juris
diction is coextensive" with their field
of operation, nnd "our steady aim should
be, by legislation cautiously and carefully
undertaken, but resolutely persevered In,
to assert the sovereignty of tho national
government by affirmative action."
The particular application of this, of
course. Is to the regulation of railroads.
The laws on this subject hitherto have
been of "a negative or prohibitive rather
than an affirmative kind." They have
In part sought to prohibit what could not
be prohibited, and therefore they could
not be enforced. The President discusses
tho subject of rate-regulation at length,
deprecating "Improperly radical or hasty
action," but Insisting that "tho power
should be affirmative and should be given
to some administrative body created by
Congress."
Regarding public ownership of railroads
as highly undesirable, and probably en
tailing far-reaching disaster, ho wishes
"to seo such supervision and regulation
of them In tho Interest of the public as
will make It evident that thero Is no
need for public ownership."
Tho comparatively brief paragraph In
which the President deals with the sub
ject of the public revenues Is plainly de
signed to discourage discussion of the
tariff. There is much moro need, he says,
of stability than of the "attempt 'to at
tain an ideal perfection"; no change
should bo made except for gravo reason
and by general agreement, and while some
readjustment may be desirable, It is "as
yet too early to say whether thero will be
need of It." Economy Is urged.
The last portion of the message treats
of the Panama canal. The President re
lates very briefly what has been done and
how far tho plans may be regarded as de
termined. On the only point remaining
unsettled, "the question of type," he de
fers comment until he shall be able to
lay before Congress tho report of tho
advisory board, What Is needed now is
an immediate appropriation for the cur
rent and accruing expenses of the com
mission.
Senator Proctor to Resign?
Washington despatches to tho Boston
papers Wednesday announced the Inten
tion of Senator Itec field Proctor of Ver
mont to resign two yenrs before the ex
piration of his present term, or about
March 4. 1900. The Herald quoted him
ns saying thnt he had written his Inten
tion to friends In Vermont nnd that It
was his wish to be fair to his successor,
who would be nble to Btnrt with tho new
n
administration, which will follow the ad
ministration of President Roosevelt The
Globe announced that Senator Proctor had
sent to the editor of the Burlington Free
Press a letter for public use, announcing
his plans.
Ills age he Is now In his 75th year
and the enforced nbsence of Mrs. Proc
tor from Washington, where tho climate
does not agree with her, are given ns his
reasons of proposing to .withdraw to
private life. In 1909 Senator Proctor will
have completed 20 years' service In Wash
ington, counting the time which he served
In President Harrison's cabinet ns secre
tary' of war. He has been one of the strong
men of the Senate from the day that ho
entered It. He Is one of tho men who,
as the Boston Globe says, "can .guide and
direct, who keep their feet on the earth
Instead of soaring off Into the cloud's,
cntchlng sunbeams with oratorical nets;
men like Aldrlch nnd Hate nnd the late
Senator Piatt of Connecticut."
Senator Proctor has never posed as an
orator, but no speech In many years has
had a moro far-reaching effect than the
one which he delivered In the Senate
shortly after his return from Cuba, In
which he Indicted Spain nt the .great
bar of public opinion. ' v
The Boston papers rather prematurely
announce Representative David J. Foster
of Burlington as Mr. Proctor's probable
successor, nnd he Is iunted ns saying that
he will be a candidate when the time
comes. Senator Iroctor proposes to fol
low the course tnken by his distinguished
predecessor, Senator Edmunds, in resign'
Ing.
It would 'seem difficult to find In .Ver
mont today n man who can go to Wash
ington and carry the all-around woight
which Senator Proctor represents, but It
Is possible to develop the "man of tho
hour."
' Ninety-one new members took their
seats In tho Houso of Representatives In
Washington this week. Eighty-three havo
nover hnd experience In Congress and
eight return after absences more or less
extended. Including the venerable J. War
ren Kelfer of the 5th Ohio district, who
served prominently from the 45th to 4Sth
Congress, nnd was speaker of tho 4"th
Congress, and Charles A. Towne, now from
the 2d New York district, who has served
from Minnesota In both the House and

MARY ROGERS TO
Execution to Take Place Shortly After One O'clock Today-Gov.
,Bell Again Refuses to Interfere.
Windsor, Vt., Doc. 8. 10.30 a. m.
This Is undoubtedly Mary Rogers's last
dny on earth.
The conference of her attorneys with
Gov. Bell nt White River Junction this
morning Is understood to have been with
out result, the governor remaining In
flexible In his determination not to In
terfere with the operation of the law.
It Is expected now that the execution
will take place shortly after 1 o'clock.
Mrs. Rogers passed the night nulctly,
ate breakfast ns usnnl this morning and
Is calmly awaiting hcr doom. It Is her
expectation' now to go to the gallows un
aided. The preparations for tho hanging are
complete nnd several times the gallows
wns tested yesterday by springing a bag
of sand through the drop. Deputy Sheriff
A. McAuloy of Wilder will spring the trap
nnd Deputy Sheriffs Spafford, Klnlry nnd
Thomas of Windsor county will be upon
the scaffold wljh him. The military guard
will consist of Deputy Sheriffs Barney
Kllby of St. Albans, E. A. Horton of Bur
lington, F. W. McClurc of Brattleboro and
Sheriff Gunnison of Newport, N. H.
Deputies W. I Fairbanks and James Mc
Dermot will accompany Mrs. Rogers from
her cell down tho three flights of stairs
and up the steps to the gallows.
Sheriff Peck formally read the death
warrant to Mrs. Rogers yesterday. This
wns the third time the warrant had been
rend to her. It Is said that she listened
without npparent emotion and remarked,
"I will go with you quietly." Father
Delaney administered the sacrament of
the holy communion following her con
fession to lilm yesterday.
E. B. FHnn of Springfield, one of the
lawyers who lias beui laboring for the
condemned woman, left Montpeller last
night for St. Johns. P. Q., planning there
to Intercept Gov. Bell before midnight.
Gov. Bell hnd been later In coming from
Chicago than expected. He planned to be
nt White River Junction today. It Is
understood that Fllnn nnd the other law
yers have nflldavlts to present to him
with a final request for reprieve, prob
ably on the ground of Insanity. P. W.
Clement of Rutland has Interested himself
In the woman's behalf and Is said to have
sent n message to the governor urging
for n reprieve until after the session of
tho next legislature.
Over 200 telegrams of protest against
the hanging were wnltlng Gov. Bell's nr
rlval at White River Junction last night.
Attorneys Claimed to Have Hope for Mrs.
Rogers.
"The prospects for saving Mary Rogers
are much brighter, I think we shall be
able to squeeze out of It." This was
tho statement of E. B. Fllnn of Spring
field nt the close of n conference of at
torneys working In behalf of the woman,
held nt the Bnrdwcll House In Rutland
Wednesday evening. This statement is
givon more weight because the attorneys
had then Invited Hon. H. H. Powers of
Morrlsvllle to their conference, nnd the
presence of a mnn of his legal standing
has given the move more character than
It has heretofore possessed.
The nttorneys are reticent about giving
out their plan but It Is known they had
before them n large amount of documents
relating to the mental condition of Mary
Rogers by which they hope to show that
she was of a depmved nature nnd not
responsible for the crime of which she has
been legally convicted.
The nttorneys would not say so but It
Is thought that one of their number left
Rutland Thursday morning to meet tho
governor en route home from Chicago to
present their claims to him.
United States Marshal H. W. Bailey
was at the prison at Windsor nil day
Wednesday. His presence has given rise
to the supposition that there is some hitch
between the federal hnd state officers
about the custody of Mnry Rogers. Noth
ing definite can be learned ns a special
guard has been placed nt tho entrance of
the prison nnd will not allow any repre
sentative of the press to enter.
The much-discussed paper which Mary
Rogers signed recently before Attorney
Fllnn, nnd which has been alleged to bo
a statement that she was with child, Is
'said on good authority to have been a
document relinquishing nil claims against
the Insurance carried by her on
her husband's life to his brother, Wnlter
Rogers of Hooslck Falls, N. Y for tho
purpose of paying the funeral expenses
of her husband. It Is said the paper con
tained absolutely no reference to her

physlcnl condition. Tho nmount'of tho
Insurance is $500.
Gov. Bell, who was In Chicago to
attended n meeting of the New England '
association, said In an Interview Monday;
"My stand Is unalterable In tho case of
Mrs. Rogers. There nre some things
which we In Vermont respect, I am happy
to say, and the supreme bench is one of
those things. The laws of the state nre
there to be enforced, and I happen to bo
the official whose duty It Is to see that
they are, enforced. If Mrs. Bllckensder
fer wishes to see me I am ready to meet
her." He also said that ho expected to
be back In the state nt the time of tho
execution. It Is understood that he ar
rived at his home In Walden yesterday.
T. W. Mnloney. attorney for Mrs.
Rogers, nt Rutland Tuesday, criticised
Gov. Bell for his early announcement
thnt he would let the law take Its course
nnd not Interfere In the hanging. Tho at
torney said:
"The governor Is a court of last'resort,
and for a tribunal to give his decision
before he has heard the evidence Is un
becoming, undignified and scandalous.
I had Intended to make a last appeal for
another reprieve until the hasty decision
came from Walden, the home of the
executive."
Fake, Stories In Boston Papers.
Superintendent W. S. Lovell was very
Indignant when he saw the article printed
In a Boston newspaper Wednesday, sent
by a special correspondent . In Windsor.
It stated that a message was sent -to
Mnry Rogers by the paper's representa
tive, asking It there remained anything
that could be done for her to add to her
comfort In these, her List days and that
she replied ns follows: "I thank you for
your offer. There is nothing you can do
for me now. Everything has been tried.
I must hang. There Is nothing you can
do to lighten the hours of these last days.
I nsk you only to pray for my soul when
I am dead."
The superintendent said that It would
be Impossible to get a message to Mrs.
Rogers and that the story is a falsehood
from beginning" to end; made tip of whole
cloth. No one can reach Mary Rogers, he
said, unless they have business of a na
ture to warrant sdeh privileges. A guard
Is stationed at the door of the corridor
to keep everyone out. More than 100.
other fake Interviews with Supt. Lovell,
Atty-Gcn. Fitts and other officials have
been published.
The Gallows Erected.
The warrant for the execution of Mrs.
Mary Rogers was rend to the prisoner '
yesterday morning by Sheriff H. H. Peck.
Early In the forenoon Rev. C. C. Delaney
was admitted to the cell Of the condemn
ed woman to give her religious counsel.
Work on tho gallows wns begun In the.
morning nnd the task was completed at

That God besets us behind and before
and has laid his hand on all of us is the
crowning glory, as it Is also the perpetual
mystery, of human life. In the light of
this truth nothing seems small or negligi
ble. Every incident and association of
our lot takes on a new meaning. Tho
stars have a .fresh message for us; the
flowers look up to us with Intelligent
faces; God walks In his garden still, and
his voice calls for our recognition, even
though we are afraid and hide ourselves
from his approach. Nothing becomes Im
possible for us; our strength Is sufficient
for our day, and new Ideals press upon
us for acceptance as soon as we have
faithfully .done tho work "of the Immediate
present. Christopher J.' Street.
