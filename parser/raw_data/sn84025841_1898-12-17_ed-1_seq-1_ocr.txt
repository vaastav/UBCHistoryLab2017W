OPPRESSION.
Camp A. G. FoBSB, Ala., Dec. ll, '98.
"Horse" Douglass, the Negro villian ?
who murdered Corporal David Garret
and Private John R. Brooks on the
night of November ll, 1898, is a free
man. He was seen last Thursday niglit
by several members of the loth Caval?
ry in a saloon intoxicated flourishing a
revolver and making threats, "He wa*
going to kill more of the 10oh and
boasting of having killed those two j
and was backed up by the white citi?
zens of Alabama.
He w asf rrt sttd and locked up on cir-1
eumstanual evidence tried perhaps
amd to-day he is a free man and yet the|
Huntsville papers, other* edited in the
South failed to note anything concern?
ing the supposed trial, except a sen?
tence of ten or fifteen words in the edi?
torial of "The Huntsville Mercury"
when he wac arresttd.
When the murder was committed,
the commanding offiaers (white)
begged the boys not to be h*sty or ho-.
headed over the affair aud start a riot,
but, be cool and collected snd they
would assure us that justice would be
meted out to the assassin, and they
would see that he receive his just de
Berts for we were U. 8. Soldiers The
heroes of Santiago snd San Juan Hill
besides being the Great Indian fighters
of ths West.
We took the advice but with a super?
stitious frame of mind for well we
knew that justice had never been done
the black soldier in the Sooth. But!
we anxiously awaited to hear of the I
trial and verdict of the Jury, At last I
it came and Douglass, (the murderer)
now a free man was allowed to noske it |
public in the presence of the 10th Cav -
airy boys in these terms: "To-day I
am free and ready to murder more of I
the 10th. They cannot harm me, they
have no arms, besides, I am tn with a
ring of white men who hate the Ne?
gro soldier. They have and will pro?
tect me by law and I am well paid for
each man I kill."
WHAT DO THEY THINK ?.
Douglass. "1 am eolebrating the
event, 'let's have a drink 1' I'll have
more money when 1 kill another of the
10th Cavalry." Now, what does thej
unprejudiced minded citizen of this
glorious union think of such treat?
ment? Have we not always acted as
gentlemen and U. 8. soldier ? We
have and will protect the stars and
stripes; but we would to God that the
representative head of our government
the President of the IL S., would pro?
tect the 10th Cavalry soldier and their j
Interest when human lives are at stake
without a battle.
A DELICATE QUESTION.
Are the good people of this glorious
union awarer of* this outrageous fact
that here in Huntsville there isa house
of ill-repute kept by some mulatto
women where white U. S. soldiers
are posted and relieved day and night
as ''a Provost Guard" to parole the im- j
mediate vicinity of "This House" for j
there is no other within three hun?
dreds yards of this house. ^L
This guard was placed there after
the arrival ol the 10:h Cavalry and we
are three miles away.
Is this what the U. 8. soldiers are to
be used for ? Yet, there ia no protec?
tion for the black soldier, but there is
for a house like this kept of colored
women.
THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE.
But, perhaps this committee on
camp investigation which waa on a
tour through the soathern camps fail?
ed to notice this scandalous use of the
TJ. S. soldier ox the half frozen and
sickly members of the 10th. wading in
mud and water, ankle deep. One would
naturally ask, "Why ?" and the an?
swer is, "Because this Gamp A. G.
Forse, Ala., the worse place in the Un?
ion was never visited by this commit?
tee although we were ordered to brush
and eleen eur clothes and look our
best for inspection for four or five
days.
DID NOT SEB THFat.
Bnt alas! they failed to put in an ap?
pearance perhaps for fear of getting
stuck here in the mad. But, now the
ground is frozen hard. Oar conical
wall tents (which have arrived) are
I1
still cased up our sibley stoves are still
in crates. The doctor has ordered us
not tc nit around camp Ares for fear
cf blindness Rheumatism and pneu?
monia prevails. The old and young
soldier is discouraged. Take us away
from Alabama or send us to Cuba or
even Haden
Yours as ever.

JAilES MEKIWEATHER'S BASH ACT
He Takes His Own Life.
A shocking suicide took place Tues?
day at about 8 p. m . at the residence
of Dr. Jno. E. Meriwether, 820 N. Sec?
ond St.
It seems that James E. Meriweather.
brother of the physician referred to
has been at stated times a person of
convivial habits. He had been on a
?pcaa for about three weeks, and while
the doctor and his friends were in tbe
front part of the residence, he wad in
the rear portion lying down.
He went oat in the yard and taking
a six-shooter in his hands placed it in
his mouth and fired a bullet into hi*
brain. His death was instantaneous.
The deceased was a man of fine in?
tellectual abilities. He was a fine con?
versationalist and was at one time em
?iloyed in the government office at
Vashington. He was appointed Dep?
uty Internal Revenue Inspector Octo?
ber 20th, and the term of office expired
Nov. 20th.
Meri weather was engaged to be mar?
ried, it ie said to Miss Mary Davis. She
got up from a sick couch and went to
the place where the remains now are,
Mrs Crump's, 786 N. Third St., where
she was put to bed and has sinoe been
under the influence of opiates, being
too ill to be removed.
The funeral took place from the
house of his sister, Mrs. Crump, Thurs?
day af ternoou at 8 o'clock.
He is well-known throughout the
state and his people are all well-con?
nected.
The Grand Lodge in Session.
The Masonic Grand Lodge of Masons
has been in session since low six, Tues?
day Masonic Hall. There has been a
large attendance and harmony has
characterized its deliberrtions.
The election of Grand Master result?
ed in the promotion of Deputy Grand
Master R. E. Jones of this city to that
position. A creditable parade took
place on Thursday afternoon.
H. M. 8. Pinafore.
Thia beautiful opera was presented
to a large and fashionable audience at
the True Reformers' Hull last Monday
evening. The cast, composed of some
of Richmond's finest singers, did well.
Th'i cast was compote! of the following
bright lights, many of whom have
starred in former operas:
Sir Joseph Porter, K. C. B., Mr. D.
0- Jackson; Josephine, Mme. F. P.
Walker, Capt. Corcoran. Mr. Ed. Clay ;
Buttercup, Mme. M. A. Cross ; Ralph
Rackstraw, Mr. M. Sydney Mayo; Dick

Mme. Carrie Hawkins; Quakeress,
Mme. E. J. Robinson; Boatswain, Mr.
W. E Hope, Boatswain's Mate, Mr. E.
Christian ; Marine. Mr. Stephen Turn?
er.
The chorus was particularly heavy
and the caste was therefore strongly
supported,
The management was excellent, Mr
John 0* Lewis deserving much eredit
for the same. Mr. James M. Jasper
was the efficient stage manager.
It is rumored that the troupe will be
held together for future entertain?
ments.

MR. MCKINLEY'S MESSAGE.
A UNIVERSAL WAVE OF DISAPPROVAL.
Ringing Utterances by Brilliant Editors..?The
Brother in Black Forgotten.
THE PROTECTION OF FOREIGNERS.?THE SLIGHTING OF AMERICAN
CITIZENS.?FEW TAKE A HOPEFUI VIEW OF THE SITUATION.
Where the Work Must Be Done.
[Cleveland, 0 Gazette.]
In all this there is a lesson wh)ieh
should be seared into the very marrow
of .he bones of our children and that
is that it is folly to look to any politi?
cal party for protection for our livfPS,
liberty and property in the south, un?
til a stronger manhood and race loyal?
ty and more .independent politisal ac- j
tion along race lines, is developed
among our people. The bulk of ttke]
work must be done in the north wheire
our votes and political work coant oki
election day.
The Afro-Americans of the soutjh
who go to national republican conven?
tions in the future must (snd will aVs
Boen ss they are properly developed
alongjiinee indicated) get toge thar arid
give their support only to such men
who as presidents will nave the eoulr
age (and do so) to uphold | every con?
stitutional provision, especially' ttybse
I for the protection of life, liberty /and
j property everywhere in thia] coalntry
' regardless of the class or coior, of the
citizen, even if he has to use, every
soldier and sailor ayailable.
Oharity Should Begin at Home.
.'Louisville, Ky., American Baptist.]
In speaking of Cuba, the President
says it is our duty to give the people
of that Island the needed aid and di?
rection in forming a government of
their own that should be stable, just,
beneficent, without revenge and in ac?
cord with the enlightened principles
prevailing in our own land. This is
right and proper, but charity should
begirra. home and the same principles
be first firmly and permanently estab?
lished in this Country.
Perhaps It Was.
[Philadelphia, Ps., Christian Recorder]
Of course, some of us are a good deal
disappointed that some reference is
not made to the conditions which ob?
tain in certain sections of the country
relative to the exercise of the elective
franchise by certain of our citizens.
Perhaps this message was writtea
before the latest and most glaring vio?
lations of law took place. If so, we
may look for a subsequent reference
to this subject.
Brosght Disappointment.
[Philadelphia, Pa., Tribune ]
The President's Message, consisting
of some 20,000 words, has been pub?
lished and brought disappointment to
many hearts. "The Tribune" had
hoped he would have said something
about mob violence in the South, but
he seems not to be aware that the
Afro-American exists at all.
President McKinley may ba a very
good man, but it must be evidsnt to ail
impartial minds that he is Hot the msn
for the hour. He lacks the sand and
the grit needed. Gentlemen trot out
the name of the next President; is his
name Roosevelt?
Editor Fortune is Charitable.
[New.York Age.]
There are about ten million people
in the United States who finished read?
ing President McKinley's second an?
nual message to Congress with a pro?
found sense of disappointment and eor
row. In all the fourteen columns of
nonpariel type there is not a word of
reference to the extraordinary atti
tude of Governor Tanner in the Pana
and Virden coal mine riots, in Illinois,
nor to the murderous and revolts iou
ary condition of a Hairs that pre\ sited
in North a-nd South Carolina from the
first to the eighth of November.
We do not wish to believe that the
President regards these extraordinary
happenings in those States as beneath
his notiee or that of the Congress, of
which he ii (he constitutional ftdyiltr
and that thry do not call for a refer?
ence from the thief Executive of the
Nation and for some action on the part
of the Congress. vVe prefer to believe
that in a second message, when domes,
tic subjects wil) be treated more at
length than in the first, this vital mat?
ter will receive adequate treatment by
the President with appn priate recom?
mendation to Congress.
' Xe One Cares foi Us.
[Columbia, S. C., Peop "s Record ]
ThislaaC ont >:; ii ?.
sheuld i>e ncajeu bj a ia this
country. lt should be st-n as "the
hand-writing on the wall" that no one
?not even>our President cared for us
nor oar situation. Let the Negroes be
wise and put ourselves in a position to
care for ourselves, putting our seal of
disapproval on any man wno will "cur?
ry f av os" with his political opponents
and neglect his loyal supporters.
Let the Negroes of thia country
cone together and unite f r the com?
mon good of all. Let us care Tor such
white .men aa wfll manifest care for
us. whether he ba a President or an
ordinary American citissn.
Weak and Disappointing.
[Augusta,Ga., Union.]
The colored citizens of America had
boned that the President would have
at least followed the proper example
set by President Grant and had said
something about tbe recent slaughter
of his fellow citizsns in the Carolinas?
that he would have said to the Ameri?
can people that ha had at least a frown
for such outlawing.
In this one particular the document
is painfully weak and disappointing;
especially so since the President bas
employed the army and navy to put j
down in the island of Cubs the inhu?
man treatment that wat accorded the
natives of that island by Spain.
As Silent As A Tomb.
[Philadelphia, Pa. Odd Fellows
Journal |
The President has sent his annual
message to Congress. It is able and
comprehensive. It tells all about the
victories that we have achieved by land ]
and by sea for the sake of humanity?
what has been done by our government j
by way if righting the wrings of the
oppressed of other lands but he is as si?
lent as the tomb about what ought to
be done for the sake of humanity at
home, what ought to be done to pro?
tect at home the people who have been
fighting in the defense of our fla?
abroad.
Must Have Patience.
[Chicago, 111 , Conservator.]
The message is significantly silent
on the recent outrages and lawlessness
in the Routh?thousands upon thous?
ands of people of this country had anx?
iously awaited the message expecting
that the President would administer,
at least, a merited rebuke to the law?
less element of the couatry. Bow
ever, the President thought proper not
to say a single word in condemnation
of these outrages; yet he may have
another plan by which these evils are
to be corrected. We hope so. At any
rate we must wait?patience is neces?
sary in these times of trouble and op?
pression.
The President Yields.
[Philadelphia, Pa. Christian Banner.]
The President waa dependent upon
tie South to aid him in the war with
.^pain.^and will still needjtheir support
ut ni hi n tain the sovereignty of the
United States over the newly acquired
territory, in order to have their sup?
port Iii munt not interfere in any way
with wt at they regard as their State
rights, therefore the Negro is sacrific?
ed and left to a sad fate without any
protection whatever, The President
and hia cabinet yields to the prrjudici 1
Osmand* of the Suu'h and aliowa. net
only inoffensive cirz*na to be brutally
treated and murderrd, but the Coun?
try's defenders also.
Thicks Indignation Meetings Caused lt.
iSpartan&burg. 8. C. Piedmont In?
dicator.
In his mef??p? to Congress last week
TrMMOnt McKinley failed to cali at?
tention to tne recent race riots in the
South. The reason for the failure is,
aa stick, tbe indignation meetings
were he'd in the North instead c f in
the South. The man whose shoe
i ini'li-s id the one to holler. Catch on,
njrthern brethren?
Qreat is the President'
[Denver,Col., Statesman.]
The President's message to Congress
is before the country. He declares
that we have had a war. and tells hew
it happened. Upon the question of do?
mestic violence, race conflicts and
lynchings, he saj?u never a word. The
President's money ideas are still gold?
en. Upon matters affecting the color?
ed brother he is silent, and 'silence is
golden." In this way. everything is
made to flt, and we are all made a hap
py people. Great is the President.
We Have Watched!
I Martinsburg. W. Va., Pioneer Press. ]
We publish the following which was
printed when we were hurt and things
have happened to show that Editor
Mitchell is a good prophet.
"We regretted to learn of the injury
sustained by our brilliant legal friend,
J. R. Clifford, Esq.. editor of the Mar
tinsburg, W. Va. Pioneer Press at the
hands of the commonwealth's attorney
of Berkley Co.
"The failure of the Justice to pro?
tect Mr. Clifford is as mystifying as
the attack itself.
"The mixed jury for which the col?
ored attorney was contending was se?
cured, but he lost his case owing to
the arbitrary ruling) of the court. We
presume the matter will not rest here
and shall watch with interest tke re- I
suit of the controversy."?Richmond

Brother Mitchell, have you w\tcbed
and seen to your heart's delight?
Won't Read It Thoroughly.
[Denver, Col. Statesman ]
We have not xead tbe message thor?
oughly, (and don't expect to) but have
read the heads and sub heads of the
various subjects discussed, but found
nothing concerning ths oppressed and
unfortunate sons and daughters of
Ham.
Some people claim, that there is no
reason for special mention of this class
of American citizens. Under ordinary
circumstances, there would notb*, but
the condition and experience cf the
Negro in this country are extraordi?
nary, and something should have Peen
said about his present and future citi?
zenship in America.
The President mentions the killing I
of aliens, which has been proven justi I
liable under the law, but he has no
suggestions to make about the infamy
of killing Negroes, when there is no ex?
cuse in the majority of cases, exoept
malicious murder. Evidently, Mr.
McKinley is aware that the Negro is
entitled 11 actual citizenship, in this
country, because he helped to make it
what it is; both in war and peace. !
Yet the President may know his busi?
ness and tbe people with the most io*
fluence will bave no criticisms to make
because the ^Ohlef Executive has ap
Sarently forgotten the existence of the
egro race.

army reached camp last Saturday.
They have a full regiment of 1200 men
and 1200 horses, and a wagon train
with about 150 mules. They are en?
camped at the race track in the Fair
Grounds about half a mile from town.
Ou Sunday I witnessed a sad and im?
pressive ceremony, a funeral of one of
the troopers who had committed su

coming from Huntsville. Ala. I bad

The ground f's rolling sad well adapt?

a very good system of sewerage, and
ample water supp'y. The colored peo?
ple here seem to be verv industrious,
and have several very handsome
churches, but the average colored
person, met with seems to be sadly
lacking in ordinary intelligence. Sev?
eral large citton mills and factories
are loeated here, and this tis the staple
of trade. The streets are very broad,
and parked iu the centre which gives a
very picturesque effect. Architecture
in the residential portion of the city is
in the classic ante-bellum style, long
driveways and broad virandas around
each house, which is so cf ten found in
old fashioned Seuthern homes.

This morning Reveille was sounded
at 5:30, the boys were given breakfast
at 6:45 and evervthing put ii readiness
for the Grand Review given for our
Corps Commander, Maj. Gen'l Wilson
in the city at 0 o'clock. At 7 o'clock,
our command left camp for the long
march to town, which was reached
shortly after 8 o'oloek. Every man
was in heavy marching ord3r, with his
rifle, canteen, haversack with lunch,
shelter tent, poncho and blanket rolled
across from shoulder to waist. More
than 7500 troops were in line, and it
was truly a magnificent sight as they
marched through the streets and pass?

Division Commander and his staff

DBfLOBABLB CONDITION.
I understand from reliable authori?
ty that in this neighborhood is a large
work house, where colored women and
girls are kent and forced to work in
chain gangs, cleaning the public roads,
and doing all kinds of menial labor,
with bill and chain around their an?
kle?, for slight offences.
Altogether, from my personal obser?
vation, this State has created a very
I unfavorable impression in my mind ;
and offers very alight inducements to
citizens of color.
Many of the boys are putting in ap?
plications for furloughs home, during
th* holidays. Changes and incidents
follow each other so rapidly in the af?
fairs of this Command that it is unsafe
to predict, or even think what will
happen next. While seemingly every?
thing points to a long can paign in Cu?
ba, and avery preparation is being
made therefor, beneath the surfaee,
many significant currents flow to a
probable early muster out.

The number of furloughs for enlist?

men can leave a company at the same

filed several days in advance, as they
have to go through the regular milita?

and everybody leaving has to give his
