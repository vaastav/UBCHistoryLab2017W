. Referring to the eriod of Fraud Hayes,
President Arthur, in his message, speaks
of it as ''the four years immediately pre

The board of supervisors are
high-handed and illegitimate position, in
regard to the county hospital. It is
downright attempt to thwart, the "will of
the people as expressed at the ballot-box.
The people of Rock Island county gave an
emphatic expression of the . purpose and
wish to build a county hospital, ai d voted
$ 30.000 for that particular object. The
Argcs cares, not a single . rush-light
whether or cot the "legislature may
at the session of 1882-8 enact . a
law providing " for the care of -the
insane of the state." The board of super
visors have nothing whatever to do with
the matter. ISobody .asted them a ques
tion on the sub jtct, and their action is a
srratuitous assumption of a power not
vested in them. They should and must
be taught to understand that the people
voted a sum of money to "build a county
hospital," and their late action is only a
high banded ruse to defeat the will of the
people.
WASHINGTON LETTEK.
From onr regular correspondent.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 6, 1883.
There was an uncommonly slim attend
ance of representatives at the ... opening of
congress on Monday the slimmest I have
seen in my eight year's observation here.
The laggards are always numerous at the
beginning of a session, in years when there
is no speakership to settle, but what it was
that kept such an unusual number behind
this year can hardly be explained, . unless
Speaker Keifer's ruling that 11 o'clock
should be the hour was too much for them.
People who work from sunrise to sunset
will have some difficulty in comprehending
the tardiness of congressman who finds
11, or even 12 o'clock too early for him to
be in his seat, but there are many of them.
The greetings among members of both
parties were unusually cordial. . The cheer
fulness of the day appeared to dwell on
the democratic side, as they discussed what
they would io in the next congress. .Every
one was curious to note the manner and
demeanor of the defeated members who
were represented in such large numbers
upon the floor. Robeson, upon whom the
eves of the gallery were often centert-d.
was very active going about among bio
colleagues, ana no one would Dave inferred
from his manner that he is an intensely
disappointed man. He did not extend
many of his calls to the democratic side,
probably because of the jokes and chaffing
he met with there. ju.uch of the talk
among members on the republican side
was made up of explanations by those who
had been defeated for re-election of the
peculiar causes which led to that result.
Jay Hubbell was one f the absentees. In
running over the republican side . the
flsrures most sought after- by the ' galleries
were the diplomatic and courtly Kasxon.
the strudv and vigorous Father Kelley, the
judicious and ever alert Robinson, of
Massachusetts, Mr. Robeson and SpemkejrH
Ketf erf L pon the t democratic side tae
candidates far the next speakership jg.re t$e
main objects of attention. They were all
on hand Monday. Carlisle and Randall
were the most dignified of these gentlemen
remaining at their desks to receive callers.
Is one of the candidates we;e so agile , and
so effusive us the genial Springer, who in
the course of thirty or forty minutes, em
braced every democratic voter in the
house.
On the senate side of the capitol the ex
change of pleasant greetings, comparison
of notes about the past , fall's, campaign
and other subj-cts kept up a perfect buzz
of conversation in the chamber. As is
usual on the first day of a session, every
body was in good humor, The chamber,
with the handwome .new carpet .lately laid,
new chairs and desks, .freshly varnished,
wore a bright - an&'cletmJyipearaDce.
Some of ihu -desks were decorated with
make good use of their limited time and
talents. The president's message was re
ceived here with varying degrees of criti
cism and. approval, but the preponderance
of sentiment s that while u does not rank
as one of tua ablest of thestate papers,
it was nererthete constructed withr
great deal of fihrevdness. so as i touch; a
popular chord upon ail the various ques
tions concerning which the people have
lately expressed themselves, and he steals
awav from the democrats a (rood deal of
their loudest thunder. There was not the
usual experience of printing the' message
ali over the country . before it was Bent -to
congrcbs. A rumor was current in news
paper row Saturday niht that a copy of
the message t ad been procured -and was
for saltv-to correspondent desiring it. One
or two. I believe, were taken in by this
bogus copy, bat when President ! Arthur
heard the rumor he sent word that he
would like to get a copy himself,; as his
own message was not finished, and this
might av him all further trouble. Though
the Garfield monument fair was not
financially a success it developed a num
ber of amusing incidents. One was the
developu ent of Congressman Ilouck. of
Tennessee, and one Wigsrins, of : some
where, as presidential candidates.. A gold
watch was voted the most popular candi
date, and k spite of the fact that votes
were cast for more -than twenty-five candi
dates, among whom were such well-known
names as James , U. , Blaine, bamuel J
Tilden and Dr. Mary E. Walker, the
friends of Houck and5 Wiggins fairly
astonished themselves by the strength they
were found to possess. , iiut ilouck car
ried off the election.
All the goasipers, have been indulging in
more or less talk about the coming social
season at the capital, which they generally
predict is to be unusually lively. The
season will be short,, and , we shall have
here an unusual number r of people who
come just to spend the winter and see
what is going on. This class is growing
yearly, and the peculiarities of the present
situation adds to their number a good
many who are interested in political mat
tersthe cac vass for the next speakership.
the revision of the tariff and other kindred
subjects. The President will take a hand
in the social festivities this season, which
will be opened with the New Year's recep
tion at the White House. Having a good
deal of pride about doing such things cor
rectly and. brilliantly, it is probable that the
rounds of receptions and dinners will be in
keeping with the predictions and expecta
tioos ror an unusually brilliant season.
Last winter, while the President was writ
ing ' his CQBimumcations to congress and
his . notes . to personal friends on paper
deeply bordered with , mourning,, it was
proper that a degree of restraint should be
observed at the executive mansion. The
season of official mourning was long xgo
ended, and the occasion for it has faded
from the memory o." most people here. In
preparation for the fitting reception of
guests at the, vt bite House, the interior.
as well as the exterior, has been improved
The scaffoldings are still up in the halls
and the vestibule, but the work of the dec
orators will be completed in a lew days.
Don Pedro
'Merrimac" in March. 1862, In the course
of discussion Mr. Bayne, of Pennsylvania,
called attention to the fact that yesterday !
tae house voted down a measure for the
benefit of the soldier wha- were n poor-
houses, and now all at once a great oppo
nent of all impoverished soldiers, (alluding
to Mr. Hewitt, of. New York) rose ? and
described a conference which he once at- i
tended, and how he and that conference'
had saved the spoliation of New York
city, and told how be wanted to appropri
ate 1200.000 to a few men who had taken
part in the combat with the Merrimac. If
these people were poor let New York take i
care of them. The enacting clause of the
bill was then struck out on a motion by
Mr. Atherton, of Ohio 102 to 84.
The committee then rose, but no action
on its report was taken by the house.
Mr. Bingaam, of Pennsylvania, reported
a bill reducing postage to two cents. Re-1
ferred.

iue iew lorx ueraia commences a
lengthy and able review of the , President's
message as follow;:
President Arthur's second annual mes
sage, like his first, is an admirable, clear
and ousiness like state paper. It deals
with the various affairs and interests of the
country in the tone and manner proper to
the chief executive of the republic Its
recommendations are wt 11 considered and
wise. They deserve, and if the majority
are prudent, will receive the careful atten
tion of congress.
And these are the words with, which the
New York Sun concludes its review of the
same admirable state document. .
f resident Arttiur has written a most
instructive message, patriotic in its spirit.
bu3ite8S.,Jike ,ia.i iUi.lorm.nd full of
evidence of a thorough study of the for
eign and domestic business of the government.
It will be well for the incoming; demo
crats to read, mark, learn.and inwardly di
gest the sensible augestioas of President
Arthur.
WASHINGTON NOTES-
Washington. Dec. 8. The committee
on commerce; after discussion of the presi
dent's reference to the river and harbor
bill, in the message, agreed to a resolution
ask in if the secretary of war to state waat
anorenriations made last session were not
i l .he iht rest c f commerce.
The house judiciary committee agreed
upon fixing next Tuesday for the consider
ation of the bill for the relief of the Su
preme Court, known as the Davis bill.
which provides for additional judges for
the court.
it is understood that the house com
mittee on appropriations designs a reduc
tion of the force and salaries of the civil
service.
In the Jeannette court to-day, Ninder-
man told the story of finding DeLong and
party the same as Melville told it.
THE PROPOSED REDUCTION OF LETTER POS
TAGE.
Bingham, in his report to the house urg
ing the reduction or letter postage to two
cents, gives statistics as far back as 1792,
when the rate for carrying a letter was six
cents for a oistance of thirty miles and
twenty five cent fr 450 miles; also a care
ful estimate based on the history of the
reductions in the past, which sustains the
repo:i, that the stimulus to letter writing,
w'lich would naturally be caused by the
reduction, would lessen the estimated loss
in the first year, which, not counting such
increase of letters, would onlv reach
f 8,000,000. s The entire loss, the report
assumes. could be offset by a
fair allowance, - for carrying the
mail matter of the governmeut. It is also
estimated that should the reduction not
take effect till January 1, 1884, as pro
vided in the amended Anderson bill, the
surplus of the first half of that financial
year would balance the loss of the last half.
and there would be ample time to exhaust
or call in the printed supply of government
stamped three, cent envelopes. . The sur
plus of the postofflce depa rtment m 1883
will be fully doubled, it is believed, in
1883." ? It is suggested that when the loss
experienced by this reduction shall be
a surplus, a reduction of postage on drop-
letters can b made.

of poison accidentally administered by a
servant- He was by the direction of his
physician, trying some mineral water, and
some nyaro-cnionc acia nad been put in a
bottle similar to that containing tne min
eral water. Tbe servant mistook the bot-
a. -- . .
ties, ana gave mm tne acid 'contained in a
preparation of milk. He took but one or
two swallows when he discovered the mis-
tase. his pnysician was : called at once
and administered the usual antidotes, so
that he was greatly. relieved. He lived
after this for eight days, but it was the
opinion of his physician that death result
ed directly from tbe poison, thiugh many
on this opinion differ. His stomach was
greatly debilitated and he was under tr at-
ment for it, so the acid may only have fur
ther affected it'and been the indirect cause
of his death. Mr. Griffith was one of the
wealthiest citizens of Dubaque and a lead
ing lawyer.
