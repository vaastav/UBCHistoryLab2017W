Senator Smoot, Following
Talk With President.
Offers Amendments to
Meet Executive"? Ideas
Flexibility To Be Keynote
Revised Measure Also Would

y*-0m The Tn^unr's Washington Burea?
WASHINGTON, Dec. ?.-Recasting
of the Fordney tariff bill in many im?
portant respects is deemed sure to
follow on the recommendations of
President Harding- in his annual mea
<ajsre to Congress to-day.
The President presented ideas for
meeting the chaotic conditions abroad,
whieh are much at variance with the
bill as it passed the House. He would
have a highly flexible tariff, one which
the Executive, or? the strength of in?
formation from the tariff commission,
can rai?e and lower as may be neces?
sary; he would apply American valua?
tion only when essential and would
meet depreciated currencies by the
raising of duties to correspond.
President Hardies, before taking his
position on tariff, conferred with lead?
ers on the Finance Committee of the
>enate. ami among otners met Senator
Sir.oot arui went into detail on the
subject with him. Senator Smoot for
some time has advocated changes in
the bill along the lines suggested by
the President. Furthermore, as soon
as the Senate reconvened, following the
delivery of the message, Senator Smoot
offered amendments to carry into effect
?he ideas of the Executive.
Gives President Power
One of the amendments authorizes
?he President to increase and decrease
duties. Another enables the President
-o ?x duties which will equalize con?
ditions caused by depreciated currency.
A th?r? authorizes the President -in
eases wherein he deems it necessary
10 apply American valuation. This
amendment is founded on the idea that
t?ongre;s will restore the foreign mar?
ket vaiue as the basis for the assess?
ment of 'id valorem duties.
?e~.:\\.nr Smoot also introduced a
fourth amendment which covers all
three of these points and provides that
when in his judgment the public wel
:":.re may require, the President shall
direct that investigation be made of
ons affecting competition in the
American market between foreign and
: ime tic producers of any article or
If the President finds that
he duties under the law do not equal?
ize the advantages of the foreign and
domestic producers he shall increase
duties, apply American valuation or
:aise duties to meet depreciation of
foreign currency. This amendment pro
.des that the total increase or de
'?rease of such duties shall not exceed
."'! per cent.
Follows Harding's Idea
The purpose of my amendments,"
nator Smoot, 'is t > carry out the
recommendations as to tariff contained
i.; the message of the President.
"The amendment on American valua?
tion is a modification of the House plan.
in many lines of goods tho American
valuation is not necessary. The House
provision would apply to it everything
in the bill. My amendment would ap?
ply it oniy when the President on in?
vestigation found it to be necessary.
"The President, under one of my
: mendments, would be authorized to
examine into the difference in condi
". ona here and abroad and increase du
: es or decrease them. Conditions now
may not be the same as they will be
six months from now-, and it might be
necessary to raise or lower duties to
meet the change. Under one of the
amendments the President is given
power to take account of depreciated
currency in any country abroad and
mod::";.- duties to meet such a condi?
tion."

oners are at work outside or above the
pier blocks of the building, and that

To promote efficiency by minimizing

tions are;
Liberal mining and land laws framed

Continued conservation and safe

Uninterrupted construction of roads

Rabbi Tony Wies Fined
For Figlit in Cemetery
Lump He Says Tannenbaum1?
Umbrella Raised Proves
To Be a Tumor
Rabbi Tony Wies, of 107 Lewis
Street, and Rabbi Samuel Tannenbaum,
of 115 Prospect Avenue, the Bronx,
were in the Court of Special Sessions,
Jamaica, yesterday afternoon, and re?
counted in detail happenings in Mount
Hebron Cemetery October 10 last.
Rabbi Tannenbaum, who was the com?
plainant, seemed to have the more con?
vincing story and Rabbi Wies, who was
the defendant, was fined $25.
Rabbi Tannenbaum said that he was
in the cemetery to pray for those com?
ing to visit relatives and friends, and
found Rabbi Wies also there. A woman,
Rabbi Tannenbaum said, approached
him and asked him to accompany her
to the grave of her husband and pray.
He was to receive pay for such service
Rabbi Wies, the complainant alleged,
tried to induce the woman to let him
do the praying, and a fight between the
rabbis ensued. Rabbi Tannenbaum
later caused the arrest of Rabbi Wies
Rabbi Wies undertook to prove ii
court that a lump on his head had been
caused by a blow from Rabbi Tannen
baum's umbrella, but physicians ex?
amined the lump and found it to be a
tumor of long standing.

Country to Prosper
In Spring, Fetleral
Reserve Head Says
Dull Times at Home Nearing
End, but Foreign Trade
Must Wait on Stabilizing
of Situation in Europe
From The Tribune's Wanhinptnn Bureau
WASHINGTON, Dec. ?.?American
business has passed through the most
acute stages of stc<rnation and may
look to un advance in all linos, ac?
cording to W. P. G. Harding, chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, in an
address to-day heforo the United Stales
Potters' Association. Mr. Harding said
it would bo impossible to expect an
enlargement of world trade until the
political situation in Europe is stabil?
ized. Ho predicted a big business boom
for America in the spring.
"Businesn conditions throughout the
country are very much better than
they were a year ago," Mr. Harding
said at the outset of his analysis. "Th?1
Federal Reserve System lias done what
it could to stabilize conditions?and 1
believe it succeeded. The country has ,
I passed through it? crucial stage. The!
?reaction is by no means uniform, but ?
: it, is well market!. The cost of living ]
; is above the pre-war level, but is grad
I ually seeking lower levels. There is !
a moderate revival of building opera- !
: tions nnd next spring activities in this
lino will be greater. There are several
I reasons why freight rates, taxes, fuel
1 and rent are higher than they should
: be. Fuel costs will come down to a
i more normal level.
j "We cannot continue to do business
forever on the. gold stock of other na
! tions. They have gut to increase their
j gold supply. The question is then
I asked: 'Why doesn't America push our
foreign trade?' The answer ?3, lack of
i confidence in the political stability of
i Europe. Russia, Poland, Rumania and
; other nations aro glowing examples of
1 what is meant, it is necessary that
! they have political stability before we
, run do business with them.
! "The most hopeful sign of the times
is the conference now taking place in
Washington, if a ten-year naval holi?
day is assured an American syndicat?
can be formed to extend credit abroad.
Sooner or later ways will be devised by
which A in?, rica can use its hugo gold
I stock so as to make the free exchango
! of goods between this and other coun
? tric-i possible. The lack of ordinary
I foreign markets is the main trouble
to-day."
