THK PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
In his message to congress at the
opening of the rinal session in his ad
trlhistration it was anticipated that he
v. ould have something to say relative to
he question of taxation, that he would
i-npress U'ion the two houses the Im
portance of keeping before them the
needs of the nations calling for early
action and the conditions that call for
the exercise of economy in the spend
ing ol the nations money. These he
did lay stress upon along with other
recommendations such as the creation
rf a budget system, and as if he had
in mind the fact that he had prevented
uch a system' from being in effect tL
the present time he urged that it be a
"workable" system. ...
Once again has he put forth the
question ot giving independence to the
fhiltppines, a proposition Which It is
thoroughly understood the country will
carry out when it becomes apparent
that they have reached the point where
they can safely be set adrift without
such action being a menace to their
own welfare. There are too n
amples of the danger involved In has
tening such action, and it Is not sur
prising tint the feeling exists that a
jnaeh greater service can be rendered
them by Insuring them adequate protec
tion until there fs -no question about
their ability to go it alone.
The matter of a loan for Armenia
comes at a time when the world is In
terested in those people tnd there can;
be no question but what there is need ef
better attention being givn- to the re
habilitation and tr.,ing of the dis
abled soldiers and sailors. That there
should be no Indorsement of the bonus
is not surprising, and the fact that he
made no reference to the peace treaty

HIGH HEELS.
Efforts have been made to set forth
the dangers of the high heels on wo-
men's shoes from the ' standpoint of'
health. The osteopathic convention in
Massachusetts heard from one physi
rian that they are a crime, that they
not only mean discomfort but they, are
actually injurious, aud that a law should
he passed making it unlawful to make
and wear heels which are more than an
Inch and a half high.
It is probable that many Individuals
have been told much the same thing
about the danger to health of high heels
and that they aggravate if they do not
cause many of the Ills with which hu--manity
finds Itself burdened. But it is
i Invariably the case that warnings do I
' little or no good. There will b' those!
who do not believe that high heels havei
any detrimental effect because none has
been directly experienced therefrom, j
Other, will remember that high heelsl

bring to mind the fact that so-and-so I
wears Wry high heels and if there wus!
any harn from them she would bo st.re
t ahow it or tell about it, while others
will gee the reasonableness of the onr
position but will not be Inclined to give
mem up because they are so pretty, -,
The fact of the matter is, however,
that just as long as it is the style to
have high heeled shoes, those who are
slaves to fashion rather than serfkers
after health and comfort will continue
to wear high heels if it kills them. U
in well known that "you might as well
ue aead as'out of fashion," and there
ore those so unreasonable as to .main

make such a fuss about hich heels ni

that point n much tho same manner as
might be expected of an independent
nation.
In dolnar so, however, there has been
open disregard for the attitude of the
allied powers and the 'discloture by
them in advance as to what can be ex.
rected from them 'when Constantine
does return. That the Greeks had a
right to do as they please cannot be
nuestionel. It Is simply a matter vt
policy. Greece fully understands what
dependence it places upon the larger na
tions of Europe in. the way of military
and financial support. The ' allies have!

lies were instrumental in having him

face of the expressed attitude of the
powers it is to be supposed tht they
are prepared to meet the si raation.

elm tree at hackamaxon, much used for
Indian council, tne name enackamaxon
meaning in the language of the tribe "the
place Of kings."
It is stated that then and there Penn
bought Indian lands, and that with the
transfer went certain verbal agreements.
About two months later Penn wrote:
"When the purchase was agreed great
promises passed between us of kindness
and good neighborhood, and hat the Eng
lish and Indians must live 'n love as long
as the sun gave light."
A century later a famous artist, Ben.
jamin West, painted a pict ire that repre
sented the affair as a formal function,
instead of as an ordinary business trans
action. The unique feature of the lncl
dent is that the agreement made that day
was faithfully kept for sixty years. Vol
taire pronounces Pern s treaty "the only
league between the aborigines an1 the
Christians which was never sworn to and
never broken."
The great elm at Shadkamaxon was
blown down In 1S10, and today a hand
some monument marks its site containing
the. words: "Treaty ground of WUiaro
Penn and the Indian Nation, 1682. Up
broken Faith." The treaty, was probably
made with the Lenni Lenape or Dela-,
ware tribea and some of the Susquehanna
Indians. ..
s Tradition has it that Penn went to the
council in e. barge and wore a blue sash.
A belt of wampum has come from the
Penn family yhieh, it is claimed, was

In his letter of Aug. IS, 16SS. to the
Society of Free Traders, Penn, writing
from Philadelphia about the Indians,
whose habits and language he had been
studying closely in the course of a tour
among them, he describes minutely the
conduct of the Indian council.. "I have
had occasion to be in council with them
upon treaties for land and to adjust the
terms of, trade.
He further wrote, although not naming
tne location, but which fits in every way
ihe Shaekamaxon meeting: "Every kintf
hath his council, and that consists ot all
the old and wise men of his nation, which.
perhaps, s two hundred people. Theis
jirder is thus: The kins sits in the middle
of a half-moon and has his council, the
old and' wise, on either handi Behind
them, at a little distance, sit the younger
fry, in the same fitrui6."
Although Penn had" paid King Charles
for the province, he recognised Indian
ownership and purchased from them all
i.ne iana ne acquired, paying a ' price
which, while not large by modern stand
ards,, was more than was paid in other
colonies. Penn not only made promises to
the Indians but kept them, and not only
n tne acquiring of land, b it Penn Insist
ed that wrong-doers to the Indians
should be treated as though their crimes
had been directed against fellow settlers,
and that Indian criminals should bs pro
ceeded against before magistrates as
though they were whites.

auction piquet, the new game for two
players which is capturing the fancy of
eard players, who complain that they
know all that there is to be known
about auction bridge. Enthusiasts who
are bitten with auction piquet say that
just as nobody who now plays auction
bridge ever wants to go back to bridge
Or whist, so nobody who once tries auc
tion piquet will ever revert to the par
ent game. And experience is daily prov
ing that many who havo taken up auc
