wilt this >ear outstrip Pittsburgh.
The directors of the local association
are proud of this record.
They are prouder still of the fact that
tilt District of *"o!umbia for the decade
7910 to 1920 led alt the states in the
late of reduction of the tuberculosis
death rate. Had the death rate for the
year 1900 prevailed in 1921. instead of
P53 deaths from consumption in the
District of Columbia there would have
been 1.17 7. This is an actual saving of !
711 lives on the basis of the present
population.

Keller's Attorney Hints of "High
Crimes and Misdemeanors"
Counts to Be Filed.
"Additional charges of high crimes
and misdemeanors" may be placed before
the House judiciary committee
soon, Jackson H. Ralston, counsel for
Representative Oscar E. Keller, republican,
of Minnesota, who brought
impeachment charges against the Attorney
General, says in a letter to
Chairman Volstead.
That these charges will be "of equal
or greater importance" than those
contained in the fourteen counts recently
filed with the committee, hearings
on which are to begin before the
judiciary committee tomorrow, Attoriifv
Ttal'stfin omnhu.(ii'/oc
Volstead Want*
In connection with Mr. Ralston's
letter Mr. Keller made public a number
of letters, including one from
Chairman Volstead to Mr. Ralston,
saying that the committee desired to
investigate all of the charges and
wanted to know what witnesses were
to be used in considering the first
specification, relating to prosecution
of anti-trust suits. Mr. Volstead said
this was necessary, "because as to
some of the charges the committee
may desire to hear you as to whether
they are impeachable before incurring
the expense of sending for witnesses
to substantiate them."
Dispute on Itureau.
Referring to a conversation with the
chairman. Mr. Ralston said the former
had suggested that he was in
doubt as to whether the charge relating
to the appointment of William J.
Burns, as chief of the Department of
Justice bureau of investgiation. was
an impeachable offense. Mr. Ralston
replied that he could not personally
conceive the slightest room for doubt
on the subject.
Mr. Keller complained to Mr. Volstead
in writing about the failure of i
i it r- vuiiuuiurii u? I m i 11 l in*.- iuh i *r- j
port of the hearings at which he and i
Mr. Ralston appeared, demanded that j
it be supplied to him "and to the |

REFORM BUREAU PUNS i
FIVE-STORY HOME HERE!
i
i
Building at 3d and Pennsylvania j
Southeast to Cost $500,000. j
Dr. Burrows Says. j
Erection at the corner of -d and j
Pennsylvania avenue southeast of aj
$.">00,000 building", to bo used as head- j
quarters of the International Reform
Bureau, was announce?] by Dr. A. Ed- s
win Burrows of Pittsburgh at the j
iiitreimg vvirviaiiii^ ims inciu.' :
eighth anniversary of the organiza
tion, in Mount Vernon Methodist |
Church yesterday afternoon. i
Dr. Burrows said it was the plan of j
the bureau several years ago. when j
two lots at the foregoing location j
were purchased, to begin work on the j
structure, but active opeations had
to be delayed, due to the war. ;
The new structure will be live sto- j
ries high and will contain dormitories. {
apartments, libraries, reading rooms, i
executive offices and a large audi-'
toriuni. In addition there will be i
space available for private business ;
enterprises, and the revenue from this i
will he used for furnishing literature!
for the society. Dr. Burrows said. j
More than $?.">.000 has been pledged
to the new building, the speaker said. :
and he hoped to have sufficient funds j
on hand to start actual construction :
within a year. I
Addresses also were made yesterday ;
by Dr. Wilbur K. Crafts, superintend- j
enf of the bureau: Rev. Henry W. i
Stotugh. J Frank Chase. Canon I
William S. Chase and Miss Jessie Ack- s
crman on the opium question. It was 1
brought out by the speakers that
there was enough opium produced in
Jndia last year to supply 122 worlds
"the size of ours."
Resolutions were adopted urging
President Harding "to renew America's
leadership of the anti-opium
crusade" and adoption of a constitutional
amendment on child labor.
COAL BOARD'URGES BAN
ON OPENING NEW MINES
Industry Already Overdeveloped
ana .Business uemanas uessa- j
tion. Report Declares.
Investigations of the United States
Coal Commission already have developed
the conclusion among its
members that the soft coal mining
industry in the United States is overdeveloped.
and that good business and
good citizenship require investors to
rease embarking upon new coal mining
operations, according to a statement
made public today. Except in
h few localities, where transportation I
conditions may modify the general j
tule. the commission asserted, in-!
creased mining activity will do harm. I
The present excessive coal - mining!
capacity, the commission further said, j
"cannot for long lower the price of j
coal simply because that condition '
of things is too wasteful."
"Too many soft coal mines and too
many miners describes the situation
in plain English." the commission's
statement said. "In these coal mines
more capital Is invested and more
miners are employed than are needed !
to produce the coal the country requires.
This condition, of course,
involves waste on a country-wide
scale.
ttuw tu ornate nit* coai mousiry is
one of the many problems before the
commission. It seems plain enough,
however, that the industry should not
be further inflated by opening new
mines."
Existing bituminous mines, the
statement continued, can produce
theoretically a billion tons of coal a
year, while the country consumes
only a half billion tons. The result,
in some places, is to bring about, the
commission said, a "mine-working
time which is too short to pay adequately
either owners or miners."
URGES AGE PENSION LAWS
NEW YORK. December 11.?A resolution
recommending the passage in
every state of a pension act which
would grant *1 a day to every person
more than seventy years of age,
whose income is not more than $300
yearly, was adopted at the closing
session of a conference of the old
age pension commission of the Fraternal
Order of Eagles here.

CHRISTMAS AMNESTY"
FOR PRISONERS URGED
Mass Meeting Calls Upon President
to Release Those Held Under
Espionage Act.
Christmas amnesty for prisoners
held for violation of the war-time
espiorage act was asked of President
Harding in resolutions adopted at a
meeting'at the Shubert-Garriek Theater
yesterday afternoon under auspices
of the joint amnesty committee.
Speakers included Representative
Winifred Mason Huck of Illinois. I>r.
John A. Ryan of the Catholic Welfare
Council. Airs. Harriet Stanton Klateh

general amnesty before* Christmas for
the sixty-two men now in federal
prisons. Following- the meeting yesterday.
at the suggestion of Mrs.
Blatch. a number of those attending
marched to the White Mouse and left
a copy of the resolutions.
Mrs. Muck declared it her privilege
"to stress the woman's point of view,
to represent the mother, the sister,
the wife and the daughter as a definite
duty iii my representation of my
state.
For Sake of Humanity.
"It is from the woman'** angle." she
continued, "that I want to plead for
these politeal prisoners, and. remember.
I am not pleading from the prisoner's
angle, llis angle is individual,
personal; and. although I. as an individual.
would gladly plead the individual
cause, i am here today to
spevi: for humanity and urge that
these prisoners be freed?not for their
sake, but for the sake of our people,
that we might clear th? way of
obstacles, that our road to world
peace may be easier to travel."
LINERS SHIFT ROUTES
BECAUSE OF ICEBERGS
Change Recommended by Hydrographic
Office of Navy Agreed
To by Ship Companies.
Owing to the "constant prevalence
of icebergs" in the North Atlantic
steamship lanes the dbuble track
route of the regular liners has been
shifted to the summer or southern
tracks normally followed after February
1. The change was recommended
by the hydrographic office of
the Navy Department, and. according
to the announcement of that office,
was agreed to by all steamship companies
signatory to the transatlantic
track agreement.
Effective immediately. eastbound
transatlantic liners will cross longitude
47 degrees west in latitude 40
degrees and 30 minutes north, while
west-bound traffic will cross the same
longitude in latitude 41 degrees and
30 minutes north. By this change the
double track is moved simultaneously
southward from the danger point off
the Newfoundland banks.
"It is urged." the hydrographic
office's announcement said, "in the
interest of safety at sea that all vessels
engaged in the transatlantic
trade between the I'nited States and
European ports also adopt these |
routes."
Reports from the ice patrol and i
from steamers plying in the North
Atlantic have Indicated for some time
that icebergs were moving southward
In larger numbers than is usual at
this season of the year.

They Believe Man Contemplating

by dragging the Eastern branch were
Instituted by the police of the harbor
precinct yesterday following the discovery
by three boys of a pair of
trousers, cap and note on the bank
in the vicinity of 14th street southeast.
The dragging bore no results
last night, and it was resumed today,
although the police doubt that the
owner of the garments committed
suicide. The only name mentioned in
the note was "Dr. Butz of 8th street
southeast," whom the writer said
could furnish identification.
Police of the fifth precinct conducted
an investigation and concluded the
owner of the garments and writer of
of the note had not jumped overboard.
They suggested that a man
contemplating suicide in the river
would hardly remove the clothing
from his body, and they also think he
would have signed the note, which he
failed to do.
The note, written on a piece of
brown paper and pinned to one ot
the garments, reads:
"While I might be doing wrong. 1
hav<? no money and am a former
service man out of work and hungry, j
Rather than steal. I will end all. j
"My home is in Washington. My
people hate me. My remains can he j
identified by Dr. Butz of 8th street I
southeast. |
"I am going to jump over now. All <
my people can go to hell."
Dr. A. D. Butz. 42$ 8th street southeast,
the physician referred to in the
note, examined the wearing apparel
and handwriting, but was unable to
solve the question of identification of
the individual, who left the garments
and note on the river front.
