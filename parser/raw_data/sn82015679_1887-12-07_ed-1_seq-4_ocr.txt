The President took the advice of the news
papers and cut it down.
The President seems to have been trying
to familiarize himself with the sheep ques
tion. Mr. Cleveland seems to have been con
sulting with Brer Carlisle. Brer Randall's
views 'will be heard later.
Hungry Hoosier Democrats are at the
capital in force, ready to see that no office,
however email, gets away.
The Journal prints this morning the full
text of the Kansas prohibition decision. It
will be read with interest by all classes of
people.
CrviL-SERVlCE reform seems to have been
lost in the shuffle. The President evidently
thought tariff reform wa3 the -winning card
this year.
THE Democratic plan of campaign for dis
posing of the surplus is before the country.
We believe the Republicans can formulate a
better plan.
The President's message puts Senator
Voorhees completely out of line -with the
Democratic party. Senator Voorhees is a
protectionist or was, at last accounts.

Pittsburg coal men are reported to be
anxiously waiting for a rise. They say it i3
a rise of the river they mean, but some sus
picious people decline to take their word for
It.
It is a little expensive to have 22,000 words
put into type, and then to cut it down four
fifths, but the grateful public will feel thai
the relief experienced is worth the cost and
will say nothing about it.
American farmers will reject Mr. Cleve
land's specious arguments in favor of free
trade. They know full well that the agricult
ural interest has been and is as much bene
fited as any other by protection.
It is at least a relief to see a President's
message that is not padded, out and loaded
down vt Lth the rehashed reports of the Cabinet
officers. In this regard Mr. Cleveland has
set an example worthy of future imitation.
The more they think about Dr. Parker the
madder the Plymouth Church people get.
When they recover their equanimity perhaps
they will explain what part of the Lord's
prayer they regard as insulting and offen
sive. The press of the country has a right to in
dulge in ghoulish glee. Without its persist
ent urging and advice, the public would be
afflicted this morning with unreadable
columns of rubbish in the President's mes
sage. THE expected Cabinet changes were an
nounced yesterday. Mr. Vilas is transferred
to the Interior Department, and the Michigan
"boss," Dickinson, is appointed to manipulate
the Postoffice Department patronage for the
benefit of the party.
The appointment of Don M. Dickinson, the
Michigan "boss," to run the Postoffice Depart
ment for all it is worth during the adminis
tration's fight for re-nomination and re-election,
is Grover Cleveland's civil-service reform
Vnessage to Congress and the country.
Hon. Wm. R. Morrison was in Washing
ton the other day, and spoke in a sad and
discouraged way of. the prospect ox agreement
among Democratic Congressmen on the sub
ject of tariff legislation. Mr. Morrison un
derstands the situation if anyone does.
The President says "it is a condition which
confronts us, not a theory." Just so, and the
condition is one of unparalleled progress and
development during a long period of protec
tion. For this condition, made up of hard
facts and figures, the President and his party
would substitute their barren theory of free
trade.
The report of the Secretary of War presents
facts concerning the defenseless condition of
our coasts which make a ridiculous picture of
national helplessness in this regard. Perhaps
it would not be a bad idea to use a portion of
the surplus revenue in completing a system of
national defense. What does Mr. Cleveland
think of that?
Indianapolis citizens who keep warm by
working their way on the street cars read
with wonder of the action of the Chicago cler
gyman, who has entered upon a crusade to
compel street -car companies in that city to
heat the cars. The surprised Hoosiers forget
that in Chicago conductors collect the fares
and passengers take no exercise.
After making the strongest argument he
could against protection, the President en
deavors to hedge by disclaiming any advocacy
of free trade. "The question of free trade,"
he says, "is absolutely irrelevant." This is
juggling with words. The President wants
to get the benefit of opposing protection
without the odium of favoring free trade. He
ries to capture the free-traders by denouncing
protection, and then tries to placate the pro
tectionists by saying he doesn't mean free
trade. But what does he propose to substi
tute for protection? A tariff for revenue
only, and that is practically free trade. A
tariff for revenue only means a tariff without
protection, and that is practically free trade.
That is the platform and is the policy of his
party to-day. A Democratic tariff means a
tariff without protection, and that is pre
cisely the burden of the President's message.
Therefore, when he says "the question of free
trade is absolutely irrelevant," he misstates
the case. The question of free trade is of
the very essence of the case, and is the log
ical conclusion of the message, despite the
President's cunning disclaimer.
MR- CLEVELAND'S AEEAIGKMENT.
The President's message is a new departure
and in some sense a surprise. Instead of pre
senting a . general review of governmental
affairs, as has been customary, it is devoted
exclusively to a discussion of the Treasury
surplus and tariff question, and instead of
being uncommonly long, as was expected, it
is considerably shorter than usual. It is
direct, and at times vigorous in style, and
carries an air of sincerity and personal con
viction; but in the opinion of the Journal it
is based on incorrect views of political econ
omy, and abounds with financial fallacies,
adroit misrepresentations, and mischievous
appeal to presumed popular ignorance and
prejudice. The message is in perfect accord
with Mr. Carlisle's address on taking the
Speaker's chair, and the fact that both give
great prominence to the surplus and tariff
question, to the exclusion orall others, shows
that the President and Speaker have decided
that the time has cbme when their party must
do something; it can not longer safely re
main a spectacle of monumental incompe
tency. The first part of the message discusses the
evils and dangers of an excessive revenue and
a Treasury surplus. While we think the
President fancifully exaggerates these feat
ures, no person will deny that the situation
does demand consideration and action. The
President treats the surplus as a condition
fraught with public peril and national calam
ity, refers to the hoarding of "the people's
money" almost as a crime, and to the duty of
releasing it as one of the greatest urgency.
He exaggerates this feature of the case for
dramatic effect. Neither the welfare nor the
finances of thi3 country can be seriously dis
turbed by the accumulation of a surplus of
$100,000,000, or one even much larger. The
accumulation of the surplus has not injured
the people, and its existence but slightly
threatens their prosperity or welfare. The
President's repeated allusions to "the distress
of the people," "the relief of the people," "the
demands of business," etc., mean simply
Wall street. It is a figure of speech, by
which a part is placed for the whole. The
President's argument on this point is mainly
for Wall street. The people at large are not
worrying about the surplus, which, by the
way, is even now less than one-fourth as
large as the Democrats said it was in the
campaign of '84, if the Democrats told the
truth in that canvass. Nevertheless, all
must admit that excessive taxation and the
accumulation of a surplus in the Treasury
is not right. The question is how to meet
this situation. One way would be to let the
revenue continue and enlarge the operations
of the government so as to utilize and absorb
the surplus, as in coast defenses, public works
and other measures of general welfare. Un
doubtedly this could be done in such a way
as to benefit the entire people and the country
at large. Another way is to limit the revenue
to the actual necessary expenses of adminis
tering the government, and to do this by re
ducing taxation. That would abolish the sur
plus by reducing the revenue. Admitting
that this is the best way, the question arises
where and how to reduce, what revenue and
how much vo cut off. Here is where the road
forks. Under the pretext of abolishing the
surplus the Democracy propose to make a
wholesale attack on the protective tariff sys
tem. This is the plan of campaign agreed on
by the President and Mr. Carlisle, and a large
part of the message is given to expanding and
enforcing this idea. All that is said in refer
ence to the evils of a surplus simply paves the
way for recommending the practical abolition
of tariff duties. There is where the President's
ignorance of political economy, of social sci
ence and the laws of business comes in. This
part of the message is conspicuous for its
erroneous statements, false reasoning and
wrong conclusions. Without stopping now to
cite these in detail, the Journal will simply
say that it differs from the President in toto
as to the principles that should govern our
revenue system and regulate the needed
changes in the tariff. We deny that the tariff
duties in whole or in part are an oner
ous burden on the people, or that
their abolition in whole or in part
would permanently cheapen manufactured
articles to the consumer. We hold that Amer
ican industries and American labor are alike
benefited by a protective tariff, that the
profits of the manufacturer and the wages of
the workmen are both increased, and that all
classes, all industries and all interests share
in the benefits. The President regards the
tariff as a barrier between the people and pros
perity, as a system of organized extortion by
which the many are made to pay tribute
to a few, and as a cunningly devised
scheme for increasing the prices of the neces
saries of life and making the rich richer and
the poor poorer. We have heard that kind of
talk before, and all that the President says on
this topic has been said a thousand times in
the weekly Democratic press of the country.
He does not advance a new idea or a new ar
gument in favor of free trade which is the
real idea of both the President and the party
he represents but he makes some ot the old
ones conspicuous by parading them in a pres
idential message. The whole argument in
this part of the document is based on an
appeal to the cupidity of the people and an
attempt to array one class and one interest
against another. There is evident a total
lack of ability to comprehend a general sys
tem of political economy or governmental
policy, and an apparent desire to make polit
ical capital by appealing to individual selfish
ness and fostering popular discontent. The
President adds nothing to the free-trade argu
ment, and the people will not be deceived by
old fallacies in a new dress.
The President's remarks concerning the
combinations of capital known as "trusts,"
and commonly called "combines," are emi
nently true. We indorse them the more cor
dially because they are in line with recent
articles in the Journal, and of other Repub
lican expressions, notably General Harrisons
Danville speech, in which it was Baid these
trusts and combines of capital would soon
be used by free-traders as an argument against
the protection of American industry. . The
President furnishes a quick verification of
this prophecy. Trusts and combines are an
unmixed evil, but they are no more due to
the protective policy than anarchism or
typhoid fever is. They might exist under
any revenue system. They must go, but it
does not follow that protection must go with
them.
Politically, the message is a terrible ar
raignment of the Democratic party. The
Democracy have for several years had control
of the House of Representatives, where alone
revenue measures can originate. They have
neither amended the tariff nor made any hon
est effort to do so. If there is anything dan
gerous or mischievous in the present situation
the responsibility rests with them for not
having long since taken the initiative to cor
rect it. Mr. Cleveland's message is a forcible
reminder of thi3 fact, and a distinct declara
tion of Democratic policy for the future, so far
as he can control it.
AN UNFIT APPOINTMENT.
The President has nominated Secretary
Lamar for judge of the Supreme Court. The
appointment is not a fit one to be made, and
it should be rejected. There are several
reasons why he should not be confirmed.
In the first place, he is not qualified for
the position, either by education or train
ing. Mr. Lamar is by no means a great law
yer, and was never so regarded even in the
South, where lawyers are called great who
would not rank higher than third-rate in any
Northern city. He was merely a respectable
local lawyer. After practicing two years in
Georgia, he relinquished the profession to
become a professor of mathematics. After
teaching a few years he entered politics, and
after that never gave much attention to the
law. He is not learned in the law, and he
does not possess a legal mind. His acces
sion would lower the court in the eyes of the
profession, and would be notice to the world
that a man may aspire to the Supreme Bench
without being a great lawyer. In addition to
his lack of professional qualifications and
experience, Mr. Lamar is too old to be made
a judge of the Supreme Court. He is sixty
two years old. Under the law a federal judge
may be retired at seventy. Mr. Lamar is,
therefore, within eight years of the age fixed
by Congress for retiring. He is too "old to
learn new duties. None of the present judges
were so old at the time of their appointment.
Chief-justice Waite was fifty-seven when he
was appointed; Justice Miller was fortyi'c;
Justice Field was forty-seven, and the others
less than fifty. A man at sixty-two, even if
he were learned in the law and fresh from
professional studies, is too old to keep up with
these trained judges of long experience. A
third objection to Mr. Lamar, altogether apart
from professional qualifications or ability, is
his rebellion record. He resigned a. seat in
Congress to take one in the secession conven
tion of Mississippi, and subsequently entered
the confederate army. He spent a year in
Europe, at the solicitation of Jefferson Davis,
trying to have the independence of the Con
federacy recognized, and to form foreign
alliances. ' In a speech delivered at Richmond,
inl8G2, referring to Abraham Lincoln, he said:
"A vulgar buffoon now disgraces the chair
once occupied by Washington and Jefferson."
More recently, in the Senate of the United
States, replying to Senator Sherman, he said
no person should call Jefferson Davis a traitor
in his hearing without receiving his instant
and indignant denial. Mr. Lamar belongs to
the class of Southerners whoacceptthe situa
tion because they have to. He ha3 never
admitted that secession was wrong. Although
he admits that the sovereignty of the United
States has been established by the war, he is
still a believe v in State sovereignty. He is
an enthusiastic admirer of John C. Calhoun,
on whom he delivered an elaborate eulogy a
few months since, and has shaped his political
faith and career on Calhoun's writings
and speeches. It was Mr. Lamar's familiarity
with these that first commended him to the
Southern people, and opened the way for his
entrance into political life. In the South he
has been spoken of as "a great constitutional
lawyer." This means that he is thoroughly
versed in the Calhoun doctrine and con
struction of the Constitution. All this may
not detract from Mr. Lamar's standing in
private life or from his fitness to fill some
public offices, but it adds to his disqualifica
tions for Supreme Judge. Even if he were
learned in the law and of suitable age bis views
in regard to State sovereignty, the abstract
right of secession and his belief in the Cal
houn school of constitutional construction,
would unfit him for a judge of the Supreme
Court. In that high tribunal these and
kindred questions are apt to come up in
the varied complications of our national
life for final adjudication. It is
important that there should not be even one
judge of that court whose views of constitu
tional law and construction have been mainly
acquired in the Calhoun school. If there
were no other objection against Mr. Lamar
his views of the Constitution and of Constitu
tional construction should be an insuperable
bar to his confirmation for Supreme Judge. It
should be, but we are by no means sure it
will be. The President desired to reconstruct
his Cabinet. He wanted to retain Mr. Vilas
and make a place for Don Dickinson, the
Michigan boss. To this end he proposes to
unload Mr. Lamar on the Supreme Court. It
is an indecent scheme and should be frus
trated. There are scores, aye hundreds of
able Democratic lawyers, qualified by learn
ing, character and experience for a place on
the Supreme Bench, and who are not open to
the objections which lie against Mr.
Lamar. Why should the President pass by
all these to take up a man who is absolutely
hedged around with disabilities? Why, ex
cept to carry out a scheme for his own per
sonal and political aggrandizement? The Sen
ate ought to reject the nomination; but the
President is likely to have his own way. A
President can generally manage a matter of
that kind, especially in a Senate so closely di
vided as the present one.
TnE Bums case affords Judge Irvin a most
excellent opportunity to teach the white
aproned fraternity of defiant law-breakers
that they need expect nothing but the hot end
of the poker in his court. Here is a most
flagrant and arrogant transgressor. There
are several sentences against him appealed
from the Mayor, and one or more cases begun
against him in the Criminal Court itself.
Why none of them have been hitherto dis
posed of we do not know, nor is it pertinent
to inquire? It may be presumed that there
has been good and satisfactory reason. But
now there is a new cause of action, a flagrant
and defiant breach of the law, committed by
Burns 6imply to emphasize his disregard of
the law, and his purpose to break it at his
pleasure. He has persisted in selling liquor
without license, paying no attention to re
peated notifications from the officers. Burns
is a most fitting subject to try the experiment
upon whether the law can be executed against
his kind. It is within the power of the
Criminal Court to send the man to the work
house for a period of sixty days. His case
can be taken up on the first day of the new
year. The evidence of hi3 guilt will not be
hard to present, and with a vigorous prosecu
tion of the case and a vigorous conduct of the
trial from the bench, there will be little diffi
culty in securing a verdict from the jury, or
else there will be a jury go out of the court
room with a plaster that no other twelve men
will care to wear the rest of their natural lives.
It is high time that the liquor-law-breakers
were brought up with a round turn, and
the Burns case is a good one to begin with.
We shall watch it with interest.
It is to be regretted that the Circuit Court
could find no authority to revoke the commis
sion of the notary who took the oath of the
colored man against Mayor Denny at the un
seasonable hour he did, and under suspicious
circumstances that would have put any honest
man upon inquiry. The notary read the affida
vit, and he knew it was an attack upon an hon
orable man's character, and unless it is to be
presumed that the notary is an idiot, he must
have known that its truth was questionable,
and that it was to be used for merely partisan
and personal effect. The act shows him to
be utterly unfit to hold a commission from
anybody, and to be unworthy the indorse
ment of the court upon which he obtained
the appointment. It is evident that the
notary would not again receive the recom
mendation of the court, but it is a great pity
that he cannot be driven from his office
with merited disgrace. The example would
be beneficial, and would be likely to give re
lief from such scandals in future political
contests.
The 'decision of the Interstate-commerce
Commission requiring Southern railroads to
furnish colored passengers, who have paid
first-class fares, with accommodations equally
safe and comfortable with other first-class
passengers, is a step in the right direction.
With all their protestations of friendship for
the negro, and loud proclamations that the
blacks were treated fairly on railroads and in
public places of amusement, the fact remains
that the people of the South have persistently
put them off in second-class car3 and in the
poorest portions of theaters and halls, not
withstanding the fact that most of them were
clean, respectably-dressed and well-behaved,
and had paid the same money as the white peo
ple who persecuted them. Whether the decision
will change this state of affairs remains to be
seen; but the probability is that it will have
some effect, because the United States is back
of it, and the South has had enough of fooling
with the general government.
We hope it is true that the Republicans
will prepare and present, at the proper time,
a revenue reform measure. The party cannot
content i'self or the country simply with op
position. Our representatives must show their
ability and willingness to do something. And
if they do, the people will not forget that the
only effort ever made to revise the tariff was
made by a Republican Congress. That at
tempt was more than the Democratic party
has ever been able to do.
The assumption that the price of imported
articles would be reduced to consumers by
removing the tariff is not sustained by ex
perience. . Some years ago the duty on tea
and coffee was removed by this plea, and they
were placed on the free list. The repeal of
the duty threw away a revenue of $20,000,
000 a year, the payment of which was not
felt by the people, and the price of tea and
coffee was not appreciably reduced to con
sumers. He soaped away the mossy spray

Last summer a band of Indians wandered in
to St. Liouis and laid seige to a hotel, and now
tlio word comes that wolves threaten the safety
of Chicago citizens who are out after dark. In

within the bounds of civilization, where 'wolves
and Indians never come, and where only a bob
tail street-car octopus disturbs the peace.
Omaha and Minneapolis might as well save
their money and not try to get the National Re

entertain the crowd, and they ought to admit it,
as Indianapolis has done.

SENATE AND HOUSE.
All Business Deferred Until After the Heading-
of the Message.
Washington, Dec 6. After the reading of
the journal in the Senate the presiding officer
asked whether it was the pleasure of the Senate
to proceed with tbdusual morning business.
Mr. Harris suggested that bills and memorials
might be introduced and referred.
Mr. Hoar opposed the proposition, stating that
it was an ancient- custom of the Senate not to
enter upon any ordinary business until after
hearing the communication from the President
at the beginning of the session; that was a mark
of respect due from the legislative department
of the government to the executive. Us there
fore moved a recess for half an hour, and the mo
tion was agreed to. After the recess had beea
extended for a quarter of an hour longer, Mr.
Morrill reported that the joint committee ap
pointed to wait upon the President had per
formed the duty, and had been informed that the
President would immediately communicate
with Congress in writing. Thereupon Mr. O. Lv
Pruden, one of the President's secretaries, pre
sented several messages in writing, and the pre
siding officer laid before the Senate the Presi
dent's annual message. Mr. McCook, Secretary
of the Senate, at live miuutest past 1 com
menced the reading of the message.
The message is printed below in full.
The reading of the message was concluded at
half-past 1, when the Senate adjourned.
Proceedings in the House.
Washington, Dec 6. The proceedings of the
House this morning were opened with prayer by
the Chaplain.
Mr. Mills, of Texas, offered a resolution di
recting the Speaker to appoint the committees
on rules, accounts, enrolled bills and mileage,
each to consist of the same number of members,
as is provided for by the rules of the Forty
ninth Congress, and referring the rules of the
Forty-ninth Congress to the committee on rules
when appointed. Adopted.
Mr. Cox, of New York, chairman of the com
mittee appointed to wait upon the President
and inform him of the organization of the
House, reported that the committee had per
formed its duty, And that the President would
communic.f e with the House forthwith.
The following amendments to the roles were
submitted, to be referred to the committee on
rales when appointed:
By Mr. Dincley, of Maine: Providing that,
pending a motion that the House go into com
mittee of the whole or proceed to business on the
House calendar, a motion shall ba in order to
designate the particular bill to be considered.
Also, for the appointment of a committee oa
navigation and fisheries, to consist of thirteen
members.
By Mr. Anderson, of Kansas: Providing that
ex-members of the House shall sot be admitted
to the floor on more than three days during the
same term of Congress.
By Mr. Stone, of Missouri: Giving prece
dence in consideration to bills reported by the
committee on public lands for the forfeiture of
land grants and restoring them to bona fide set
tlement. By Mr. Cox, of New York: For the appoint
ment of a committee on the eleventh census.
By Mr. Johnson, of North Carolina: Provid
ing that when any motion or proposition to
amend the revenue laws is under consideration,
any amendment thereto or substitute therefor,
whether it refers to internal or customs reve
nue, shall be in order.
At 12:30 a recess was taken until 12:40, and a
subsequent recess until 1:10.
At the expiration of the recess Mr. Pruden,
the President's private secretary, appeared at
the bar of the House with the President's an
nual message. It was received, and its reading
immediately begun. The message was listened
to with great attention, and at the conclusion of
the reading, which consumed forty minutes,
was (rreeted with applause. The House then,
at 1:50, adjourned until Thursday.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
An Urgent Plea fur a Redaction of Revenues
by Tariff Revision.
Washington, Dec C. The President's mesi
sage was sent to Congress to-day, and was read
in both houses. The text is appended:
To the Congress of the United tate:
You are coufronted at the threshold of your
legislative duties with a condition of the na
tional finances which imperatively demands im
mediate and careful consideration. The amount
of money annually exacted through the opera
tion of present laws from the industries and
necessities of the people largely exceeds the
sum necessary to meet the expenses of the gov
ernment. When we consider that the theory of
our institutions guarantees to every citizen the
full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry
and enterprise, with only such deduction as may
be his share towards the careful and economical
maintenance of the government which protects
him, it is plain that the exaction of more than
this is indefensible extortion, and a culpable
betrayal of American fairness and just
ice. This wrong inflicted upon those
who bear the burden of national taxa
tion, lite other wrongs. multiplies a
brood of evil consequences. The public Treas
ury, which should only exist as a conduit con
veying the people's tribute to its legitimate ob
jects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding place
for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and
the people's use, thus crippline our national
energies, suspending onr country's development,
preventing investment in productive enterprises,
threatening financial disturbance, and inviting
schemes of public plunder. This condition of
our Treasury is not altogether new, and it has
more than once, of late, been submitted to the
people's representatives in the Congress, who
alone can apply a remedy. And yet the situa
tion still continues, with aggravated incidents,
more than ever presaging financial convulsion,
and widespread disaster. It will not do to
neglect this situation because its dangers are
Dot now palpably imminent and apparent. They
exist none the less certainly, and await the un
foreseen and unexpected occasion when suddenly
they will be precipitated upon us.
On the 30th day of June, 18S5, the excess of
revenues over public expenditures, after com
plying with the annual requirement of the
sinking-fund act, was $17,851), 735.84; during the
year ended June 30, 188G, such excess amounted
to $49,405,545.20; and daring the year endfid
June 30, 1S87, it reached the sum of $55,567,
849.54. The annual contributions to the sinking
fund during the three years above specified,
amounting in the aggregate to $158,058,320.94,
and deducted from the surplus as stated, were
made by calling in for that purpose outstanding
3 per cent, bonds of the government. During
the six months prior to June 30, 1SS7, the sur
plus revenue had grown so large by repeated ac
cumulations, and it was feared the withdrawal
of this great sum of money needed by the people
would so affect the business of the country, that
the sum of $79,864,100 of such surplus was ap
plied to the payment of the principal and inter
est of the 3 per cent bonds still outstanding, and
which were then payable at the option of the
government. The precarious condition of finan
cial affairs among the people still needing relief,
immediately after the 30th day of June, 1887.
the remainder of the 3 per cent, bonds then out
standing, amounting, with principal and inter
est, to the sum of $18,877,500, were called
in and applied to the sinking-fund
contribution " for tbe current fiscal
year. Notwithstanding these operations of the
Treasury Department, representations of dis
tress in business circles not only continued but
increased, and absolute peril seemed at band.
In these circumstances the contribution to the
sinkiutr fund for the current fiscal year was at
once completed by tbe expenditure of $27,684,
283.55 in the purchase of government bonds not
yet dne bearicr four and fonr-and-a-balf per
cent, interest, the premium thereon averaging
about twenty-four per cent, for the former and
eight per cent, for tbe latter. In addition to
this, the interest accruing during the current
year upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness
of the government was, to some extent, antici
pated, and banks selected as depositories of pub
lic money were permitted to somewhat increase
their deposits. While tbe expedients thus em
ployed to release to the people the money lying
idle in the treasury served to avert immediate
danger, ourgsurplus revenue has continued to ac
cumulate, the excess for the present year amount
ing on the first day of December to $55.25S,70L 19;
and estimated to reach the sum of $113,000,000
on the 30th of June next, at whieh date it is ex
pected that this sum, added to prior accumula
tions, will swell tbe surplus in the treasury to
$140,000,000. There seems to be no assurance
that, with such a withdrawal from use of the
people's circulating medium, oar business com
munity may not in the near future be subjected.
to tbe same distress which was quite lately pro
duced from the same cause. And while the
functions of our national Treasury should be
few and simple, and while its best condition
would be reached, I believe, by its entire dis
connection with private business interests, yet
when, by a perversion of its purposes, it holds
money uselessly subtracted from tbe channels
of trade, there seems to be no reason for the
claim that some legitimate means should be
devised by the government . to restore, in an
emergency, without waste or extravagance, suea
money to its place among the people.
If s neb. an emergency arises, there now exists
no clear and undoubted executive power of re
lief. Heretofore the redemption of 3 per cent,
bonds, which were payable at the option of tha
government, has afforded a means for the dis
bursement of the excess of our revenues; but
these bonds have all been retired, and there aro
no bonds outstanding, the payment of which we
have the right to insist upon. Tbe contribution
to the sinking fund, which furnishes the occa
sion for expenditure in the purchase of bends,
has been already made for the eurrent year, so
that there is no outlet in that direction. In the
present state of legislation the only pretense of
any existing executive power to restore, at this
time, any part of our surplus revenues to tbe
people by its expenditure, consists in the suppo
sition that the Secretary of the Treasury
may enter the market and purchase the
bonds of tbe government not yet due,
at a rate of premium to be agreed upon.
The only provision of law from which such a
power could be derived is found in an appropria
tion bill passed a number of years ago; and it is
subject to the suspicion that it was intended to
be temporary and limited in its application, in
stead of conferring a continuing discretion and
authority. No condition ought to exist which
would justify tbe grant of power to a single offi
cial, upon his judgment of its necessity, to with
hold from or release to the business of the peo
ple, in an unusual manner, money held in the
treasury, and thus affect, at bis will, the finan
cial situation of the country; and if it is deemed
wise to lodge in the Secretary of the Treasury
the authority, in the present juncture, to pur
chase bonds, it should be plainly vested, and
provided, as far as possible, with rneh checks
and limitations as will define this official's right
and discretion, and at the same time relieve
hira from undue responsibility.
In considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a means of restoring to circulation the
surplus money accumulating in tbe treasury, it
should be borne in mind that premiums must of
course be paid upon such purchases; that there
may be a large part of these bonds held as in
vestments which cannot be purchased at any
price, and that combinations among holders who
are willing to sell may unreasonably enhance
the cost of such bonds to the government. It
has been suggested that the present bonded
debt might be refunded at a less rate or inter
est, and the difference between the old and new
securities paid in cash, thus finding use for the
surplus in the treasury. The success of this
plan, it is apparent, mnst depend upon the voli
tion of the holders of the present bonds; and it
is not entirely certain that the inducement
which must be offered them wonld result in
more financial benefit to the government than
the purchase of bonds, while the latter proposi
tion wonld reduce the principal of the debt by
actual payment, instead of extending it. The
proposition to deposit the money held by the
government in banks throughout the country, .
for use by the people, is, it seems to
me, exceedingly objectionable in principle, as
establishing too close a relationship between the
operations of the government xreasury and the
business of the country, and too extensive n
commingling of their money, thus fostering au
unnatural reliance in private business upon pub
lic funds. If this scheme should be adopted it
should only be done as a temporary expedient to
meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and ex
ecutive effort should generally be in the oppo
site direction, and shonld have a tendency to di
vorce, as much and as fast as can safely be done,
the Treasury Department from private enter
prises. Of course, it is not expected that un
necessary and extravagant appropriations will
be made for the purpose of avoiding the ac
cumulation of an excess of revenue. . Such ex
penditure, beside the demr.raliza'ion of all just
conceptions of public duty whieh it entails,
stimulates a babit of reckless improvidence not in
the least consistent with the mission of oar peo
ple or the high and beneficient purposes of our
government.
I deem it my duty to thus bring to the knowl
edge of my countrymen, as well as to the at
tention of their representatives charged with
the responsibility of legislative relit f, the
gravity of our financial situation. The failure
of the Congress heretofore to provide against
tbe dangers which it was quite evident tbe very
nature of the difficulty must necessarily
produce, caused a condition of financial
distress and apprehension since your
last adjournment which taxed to the
utmost ail the authority and expedients within
executive control; and these appear now to be
exhausted. If disaster results fron the con
tinued inaction of Congress, the responsibility
must rest where it belongs. Though the situ
ation thus far considered is fraught with danger
which should be fully realized, and though it
presents features of wrong to the people as well
as peril to the country, it is but a result growing
out of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause,
constantly reproducing tbe same alarming cir
cumstances a congested national treasury aod
depleted monetary condition in the business of
the country. It need hardly be stated that,
while the present situation demands a remedy,
we ean only be saved from a like predicament
in the future by the removal of its cause.
Our scheme of taxation, by means of whi?h
this needless surplus is taken from the people
and put into the public treasury, consists of a
tariff or duty levied upon importations from
abroad, and internal revenue taxes levied upn
the consumption of tobacco, and spirituous, aid
malt liquors. It must be conceded that none of
tbe thiegs subjected to internal revenue taxation
are, strictly speaking, necessaries. There ap
pears to be no just complaint of this taxation by
the consumers of these articles, and there seems
to be nothing so well able to bear the burden
without hardship to any portion of the people.
But our present tariff laws, the vicious, in
equitable and illogical source of unnecessary
taxation, ought to be at once revised and amend
ed. These laws, as their primary and plain
effect, raise the price to consumers of all articles
imported and subject to duty, by precisely the
snm paid for such duties. Thus the amount of
the duty measures the tax paid by those who
purchase for use these imported articles. Many
of these things, however, are raised or manu
factured in onr own country, and the duties now
levied upon foreign goods and products are
called protection to these home manufacture!,
because they render it possible for those cf our
people who are manufacturers to make theia
taxed articles and sell them for a price equal to
that demanded for the imported goods that have
paid customs duty. So it happens that while
comparatively a few use the imported articles,
millions of our people, who never use and never
saw any of the foreign products, pcr
chase and use things of tbe same kind made
in this country, and pay therefor nearly or quite
the same enhanced price which the
duty adds to the imported articles. Those who
buy imports pay the duty charged thereon into
the public treasury, but the great majority of
oar citizens, who bay domestic articles
of the same class, pay a sum at least approxi
mately equal to this duty to the home manu
facturer. This reference to tbe operation cf our
tariff laws is not made by way of instruction,
but in order that we may be constantly re
minded of the manner in which they impose a
bnrden upon those who consume domestic prod
ucts as well as those who consume imported
articles, and thus create a tax upon all our peo
ple. It is cot proposed to entirely relieve the
country of this taxation. It must be
extensively continued as the source of tbe gov
ernment's income; and in a readjustment of our
tariff the interests of American labor engaged
in manufacture should be carefully considered,
as well as the preservation of our manufactur
ers. It may be called protection, or by any oth
er name, but relief from the hardships and dan
gers of our present tariff laws should be devised
with especial precaution against imperiling the
existence of our manufacturing interests. But
this existence should not mean a condition which,
without regard to the public welfare or a na
tional exigency, mast always insure the realiza
tion of immense profits instead of moderately
profitable returns. As the volume and diversity
of our national activities increase, new recruits
are added to those who desire a continuation of
the advantages which they conceive the present
system of tariff taxation directly affords them.
So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the
present condition been resisted by those of onr
fellow-citizens thus engaged that they can hard
ly complain of the suspicion, entertained to a
certain extent, that there existed an organized
combination all along the line to maintain their
advantage.
We are in the midst of centennial celebrations,
and with becoming pride we rejoice in American
skill and ingenuity, in American energy and en
terprise, and in the wonderful natural advant
ages and resources developed by a century's nat
ural growth. Yet when an attempt is made to
justify a scheme which permits a tax to be laid
upon every consumer in the land
for the benefit of our manufactures,
quite beyond a reasonable demand fcr govern
mental regard, it suits the purposes of advocacy
to call our manufactures infant industries, still
needing tbe highest and greatest degree of favor
and fostering care that can be wrung from
federal legislation. It is also said that the in
crease in the price of domestic manufactures re
sulting from the present tariff is necessary, in
order that higher wages may be paid to our
workingmen employed in manufactories than is
paid for what is called the pauper labor of Eu
rope. All will acknowledge the force of an argu
ment which involves the welfare and liberal com
pensation ot our labor; it is honorable in the
