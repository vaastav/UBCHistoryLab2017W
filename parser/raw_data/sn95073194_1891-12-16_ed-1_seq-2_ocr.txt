There seems to be much dissatisfac
tion between the beet sugar people and
the farmers who raise the beets. Tb:
is not as it should bo and the trouble
should be speedily corrected. Nebraska
is said to be the best sugar beet soil in
the United States. Then why cannot
the basin srs be made profitable to both
the farmers and the Oxnards? We have
heard many say that their first exper
iiant with the beet sugar people was a
failure, and still they raised the finest
kind of beets. Let this trouble be per
manently settled, and let this industry
which promises so much for Nebraska
bs not killed in its infancy.

Ik the death of Colonel Edmond Dick j
Taylor, which occured Friday, and was
announced in The Inter Ocean Satur
day, Chicago lost one of the most
picturesque and interesting of its citi
zens. His very age was enough to give
him distinction, for he was in his 89th
year. He was a cousin of President
Taylor, and was the friend of both Ab
raham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas.
It was his own firm conviction that
neither would have studied law and risen
to eminence but for his advice and
encouragement. Both wore warmly at
tached to him. His home in those days
was Springfield, but he came to Chicago
as early as 1835, holding the appoint
ment of receiver of public moneys under
General Jackson. In that capacity he
sold nearly all the present site of Chic
ago for 8L25 per acre. That he should
have lived to so city of over a milhon
souls covering what was then a wild and
dreary swamp, is a wonderful record
even for this era. Nothing else could
so strikingly accentuate the wonderful
growth of this city. Colonel Taylor
was especially proud of tho part he be
lieved he had taken in favor of the
greenback policy adopted by the govern
ment early in the war. It is probable
that the issue of United States notes
and making them legal tender would
have been adopted had Colonel Taylor
never been born, but he may have
hastened tho day. He surely had
occasion to be proud of tho fact that
President Lincoln asked his advice and
that it was followed. (Inter Ocean.
Virtually AdMittrd.
The oil inspection department, with
E. C. Cams at its head, has seen fit thus
far to offer no explanation of the farcical
methods pursued under the pretense
of enforcing tho oil inspection law. Al
though The Bee has made an exposure
of the utter worthlessness of the Foster
cup, which is used in making tests, and
the indifference and neglect of tho in
spectors charged with the duty of test
ing oils sold in Nebraska, not a word of
defense or explanation has been offered.
The Standard Oil company by its
silence virtually admits the charge that
Nebraska has become the refuse tank
for oils which will not bear the inspec
tion in other states. The Standard Oil
company also, by its silence, pieaus
guilty to the charge that the Foster cup
was fe'sted upon this state and the
present ricfectivo law enacted through
itf. influence.
Oil inspection under E. C. Cams has
been not merely a farce, but a fraud.
Tho work of inspection is not performed
with that degree of honesty which
assures the people that they are receiv
ing the only protection possible under a
very weak law. The inspection depart
ment, by its silence, admits the truth of
the charges. Omaha Bee.
Mr. CnxRLES F. Crisp, the new
speaker, stands about five feet ten, with
a physique harmoniously trim, rotund
but not corpulent, with a placid strong
face, expressive in every outline of
strong character, ovary feature being
distinct without a mark of coarseness,
but refinement and gentility in his entire
contour will at once impress an observer
with the idea that ho was born to con
trol the minds of men. He is not nor
never was a southerner of the bulldoz
ing class, but has always contended
that reason, good judgment and sound
pdicy should be the basis of all political
success.
Mr. Crisp possesses largely by nature
what psychologists denominate "animal
magnetism." He would easily be taken
f jr a successful Now YorkorPennsylva
n:a politician, rather than the aggressive
blustering southern brigadier. In the
house he seldom takes the floor, but
when he arises and says 'Mr. Speaker,"
there is at onco attention, for it is well
known that he has something to say,
and he always says it well. He has tho
good senso to look on and listen, and he
possesses that keen discretion which
prompts him when to speak.
Tub trouble in Chili seems to grow
more complicated. Another American
seaman has just been subjected to the
cruel outrages of the Chilian authori
ties. The president's message implies
that, should not Chili make a satisfac
tory answer to the requests of this gov
ernment a declaration of war would
follow. There is reason to fear that war
may yet be necessary. The expressions
of the Chilian minister to the president
were of a very friendly nature but the
course of that government since has not
justified the impression. The president
says the answer to the request of the
United States for information was of a
very offensive tono and consequently no
reply made to it Outrages upon Amer
ican citizens cannot be committed with
impunity, and that little coast-bound
strip will "find itself tipped into the sea
some fine morning if it does not learn to
keep its hands off, and quit monkeying
with tho gun.

The governor of Texas told a preacher

will eventually result 'in the enlighten
