Socialist vote was less this year th
in 1904 the respective figures belnit
401506 and 402288 Fewer votes were
cast for the Prohibition candidates tho
count standing 228014 last Fall as com
pared with 258536 in the last preside
tlal year In a few instances says tho
f Times these figures are not final B

CONCERNING the calling of an extra
session of the Legislature Gov Witlso
sayshI have no idea of calling an ex
tra session I do not know of any em
ergency that requires it The law pro
t vides for regular sessions to attend to
measures which are usually brought up
r for legislation and it does not contem 1
plate calling an extra session except i
an emergency The consideration of
r questions like the county until bill Is
not an emergency but is a question of
the character that is usually and proper
ly considered at the regular sessionsI
The desire for legislation on such quest
tiona no matter how strong does not
constitute an emergency
TUB millions of admirers of William
Ham Jennings Bryan will learn with
4surprise and indignation that he Is
under arrest in Texas The heinous
crime with which he is charged Is
that ho killed more than 25 Mallard

dignity of the Lone Star State whit
provides a penalty of so much a piece
for all over that number killed in a
day The penalty however does not
prescribe a penal sentence

Harbors Committee should report a bill

The sweetest music we have heard in
many a day was the quartette singin I
of Revs D M Walker J L YandU I
Guice and Prof J W Ireland at the
Methodist church Sunday afternoon ItI
was soulstirring and no one could have I
heard It and not felt better by it I
Shouting that ho was John the
Baptist come to save the world an
insane man held the town of Edgewater
N J in terror for nearly in hour He I
rushed down the main streets waving aI
revolver and shouting held up half aI
dozen citizens robbed the tills of thre I
business establishments stole a team
of horses and exchanged many shot I
with a hastily formed posse He was
finally captured and sent to an insane
asylumThe Methodist church could not at
comodate more than twothirds of the
immense crowd that wanted to hear
Revs Harbin and Guice Sunday nigh
and an overflow meeting was held at
the Baptist church to which Rev
Guice preached It Is likely that one
of the larger churches will be used dur
ing this week as it is desired that all who
wish to hear the powerful sermons of
Rev Harbin and the sweet singing ot
Rev Guice shall have the opportunity r
of doing so
The meeting at the Methodist church I
conducted by Revs Harbin and Guice
is largely attended at its every service
and great interest is manifested It
was decided at a meeting of the pastor
jf the four churches Saturday that It
should bo a union meeting and it is now
onducted as such While Rev Harbir
does most of the preaching the various
pastors in town help with their presence
md timely talks Rev Harbin is ar
jxceeding able expounder of the gospel
truths and an intensely interesting talk
er He never wants for a word and his
tore of fitting narratives is remarkable
He is a great preacher and our people
are taking advantage of the opportun
ity to hear his splendid sermons Rev
iulue is an excellent singer and the
music is a pleasing feature of the ser >
vices He sings a solo at every ser
vice If you have not been to these
meetings you should attend and be sure
to get in in time to hear Rev Guide I
There were four services Sundaythe
regular morning sermon a sermon to
the children at 2 oclock an address to
men only at 3 and tho evening services
All were well attended Rev Guico I

The death of CoLT P Hill which
has just occurred at Stanford marks
the passing of a most remarkable man
sclftnado one in every sense Be
ginning life a pour boy but with a fix
ed purpose he grew to be a fine law
yer a superior advocate and a man of
most comprehensive knowledge a1
though the schoolroom was compact I
tively unknown to him and no college
claimed him as a pupil He amaased J
quite a fortune by his practice and was
able to buy the farm his fatherinla 1
Owned and nearly everyone in the neigh
borhood a resolve that he made wheR
the old gentleman refused him tho hand
of his daughter with whom he after
wards eloped For years he was the
leader of the bar In his section and for
a long time was engaged in one or tho
other of nearly every law suit of conse
quence Aa an orator he was most
captivating and as a conversational I
he was the center of any group in I
which ho appeared In his long life of
86 years ho never held office and oply
ran for it once when he was dcfcatc
for Congress entering the race greatly I
against his will He was the friend or
the aspiring young man and many
sought his aid and advice always
freely bestowed I
He was long an honored citizen of a
community which held him In higbci

esteem and his passing will be felt and
deplored Safe by the eternal In

the richest reward of a wellspent life
