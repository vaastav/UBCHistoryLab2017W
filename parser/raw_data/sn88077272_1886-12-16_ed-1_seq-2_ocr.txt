The Michigan pensioners who

done enough for him.
The annual report of the post
master General recommends that
fiird class postmasters be given
allowance for office rent, fuel, gas
and clerk hire, which under the
present law is paid by the postmas
ter. Eaton comes under the law
mentioned. No other federal officer
is required to furnish these things
referred to above, free of cost to the
government, and there is no good
reason why a postmaster should
it.
Governor Robinson of Massachu

his fellow townsmen in Chicopee,

Fcople neglect local government
too much, and by their neglect al
low abuses and corruption to crawl

national government is administer

our county and city government.
Tiiero are many more checks in do
ing national business than in city
and comity aiiairs. The ease with
which small men with little caliber
get fat places and work them for
thev arc worth is illustrated in more
than one city and county in, Ohio.
Let the people interest themselves
in having a pure, honest and eco
noinical administration of local
fairs and the national government
will takt care of itself.
