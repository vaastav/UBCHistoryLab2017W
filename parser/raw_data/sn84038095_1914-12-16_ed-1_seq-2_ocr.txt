THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
::. The annual message bf President
Wilson will scarcely rank as a state
-paper along side of some of his other
messages. He spends a good deal of
time in congratulating the democratic
party on the legislation it has placed
upou the statute books regardless of
the faqt that a great many people are
charging up the depression in business
and money stringency to the legisla
tion which he congratulates his party
tor enacting.
He devotes some time in his mes
sage to tho question of building up
our merchant marine and points out
that this is an opportune time for this
country to lay claim to South Ameri
can trade. A man does not have to
be much of a statesman to grasp this
(act and reach the conclusion that
there never lias been such an oppor
tunity for the United States to secure
control ot the South American trade
OS at this very time, it has been our
misfortune in the past to purchase the
products of South America and pay
c'iish tor them with which the people
Of that country make their purchases
in Europe. The opportunities for keep
ing up tins practice are cut off to our
Southern neighbors by the war which
prevails in Europe and they naturally
turn to the United States as a market
in which to make their purchases.
The question is, will we take advan
tage of this opportunity and build up
a trade with these countries?
It is realized that this can be done
by-increasing our merchant marine
And Mr Wilson seems to favor this
being done. Tho democratic party is
80 hostile to anything in the nature
of subsidies that it is difficult to per
suade it to offer inducements for men
Of large means to put their money
into ships to carry our produce into
othar countries. If the experiment
la'once tried the results will show
the wisdom of so doing and the polit
ical 'party that grasps the situation
and acts promptly in the premises
tflU win the applause of the American
people. We sincerely hope that the
democratic party will rise to the occa
sion and take steps to secure the
trade that is due us and will not per
mit' it to be monopolized again by
European nations.
Thte President's message offers little
encouragement for strengthening our
means of defense. It is recognized by
military men as well as civilians that
our country is in a state of unpre
paredness and that we couhl make bat
feeble resistace to an assault from a
foreign foe. Republicans in both the
fcOMto and "senate have sought to have
hkVtatigatlons made in order to as
certain the exact position in which we
ftfed Ourselves but the president with
bis big stick is able to whip his demo
cfitic followers into line andito have
fated 'down a resolution offered in
fUrttr of the investigation. It is
ettttted by the president that our
ttqntry would be tn a stronger posi
tfali' tb intercede or intervene between
ttfebelllgerent nations in Europe if
jWA'tre not ourselves engaged in
kifftnglhetting our means of defense. It.

ft THE PREVAILING WEATHER
."We do not know of anything which
IS more pleasing to the merchants of
Ugnison than the weather which pre
vails, in this locality. The falling
^pow, which spreads over the western
opuntrv, as well as the lowering
bf. the temperature insures an
increase in trade. Already there
she•
many evidences of an im
provement in business. The farm
*ira have their crops gathered and a
better crop of corn has never been pro
dliced in Crawford county, and, added
io (his. is the fact that good prices
prevail for the products of the farm.
$!rom now on we predict with the
till
re
deliveries of corn that money
increase in circulation, which
ikeans a larger trade for the merchant,
'.fflttr a few months there has been such
4 tightening of the money market that
tat few people were supplied with
tfeeMis to purchase for cash, but now
Wtlt plenty of corn to sell at good
jprlcea every farmer should be well
fW1"
supplied with means to make his pur
chases.
The Denison stores are the best in
the country and no better places can
be fonnd for selecting up to date goods
than in Denison. This accounts for
the large number of people coining
from other communities to Denison to
trade. It is a frequent thing that one
hears it said that Denison offers bet
ter opportunities for purchases than
other towns of its size in .Iowa.
Another reason why the Denison
merchants succeed is that they are
good advertisers. They believe that
they have stocks of goods that will
stand investigation and they are will
ing to have their stores visited and
criticised because it insures large
sales of goods. For the next few weeks
our merchants should have a phe
nomenal trade and we believe that,
stocked up as they are, all previous
records ol' sales will be broken this
winte/.
RECOLLECTIONS OF LINCOLN.
The Ileview is under obligations to
General Grenville M. Dodge, of Coun
cil Bluffs, la. for tho book which he
has recently published giving his per
sonal recollections of Abraham Lin
coln, General Grant and General
Sherman.
No one is better qualified to write
concerning these distinguished char
acters than General Dodge. As early
as 1859 and from that time as long
as they lived, Gqneral Dod.go was
closely related to them by bonds of
friendship as well as military and
political ties. His personal acquaint
ance with Abraham Lincoln began in
the summer of lSGit at a time whenj
Mr. Lincoln visited Council Bluffs on
legal business and from that time un
til the death of the president, lie
sought, the counsel and advise of Gen
ere! Dodge on numerous occasions.
The time Mr. Lincoln visited
Council Bluffs was noon after his
joint, debate with Stephen A. Douglas
in which Mr. Lincoln had laid the
Inundation or his nominal ion and
election 1o the presidency. He was
requested to deliver a speech while at
Council Bluffs and, although short
notice was given of the meeting, lie
was faced by splendid audience
which was treated to a remarkable
address.
The book treats In an impartial man
ner the history ot General Grant':',
connection with the early events of
the Civil war and discloses that Grant
was a great general but a poor actor.
He was little concerned about politics
and was above maneuvering in order
to win favors from his superiors, lie
depended rather upon his ability to
win victories from the enemy than up
on personal efforts to impress him
self upon his superiors. Notwith
standing his remarkable success in
winning the battles of Belmont, Ft.
Henry and Ft. Donelson, his superiors
and, especially General Halleck, in
various ways sought to discredit him
and oven to order his arrest. General
Grant was .patient under all the mis
treatment accorded him and bided his
time depending upon the justice of
his fellow countrymen for his vindi
cation which carno in due time and
with such unanimity that his critics
were soon forgotten but his star rose
higher and higher until the people
with one accord proclaimed him as
the greatest military genius develop
ed in the civil war. He pictures Gen
eral Grant not only great as a mili
tary leader but as a statesman and
cites a number of instances to prove
the foresight of President Grant on
legislative matters.
General Dodge was a great admirer
of William T. Sherman and believed
that he possessed military qualities
of the highest order and he gives to
him great credit for the part he per
formed in the Civil war. He traces
his record from the battle of Shiioli to
the close of the civil war and reaches
the conclusion that General Sherman
was second only to General Grant in
military leadership.
The people do not overlook the fact
that General Dodge, himself, ranks
along in character, ability and repu
tation with Mie three great men whom
he eulogizes in his book. When the
war commenced he was a civil en
gineer and was distinctively a self
made man. His ability, however, was
recognized by Mr. Lincoln before the
war commenced and, notwithstanding
lie was not a graduate of a military
school, he was appointed to respons
ible positions and never failed to make
good in every duty imposed upou him.
He was made a major general before
the war was over mid he was a major
general not only in name but iu size
and enjoyed the full confidence of the
other military leaders of the country.
Since the Civil war ended he has de
voted his time to engineering prob
lems and financial matters with re
markable success. He is the only
major general whi survives the Civil
war. While he has spent much of his
time in New York where his business
claimed his attention, iie lias never
given up his legal residence at Coun
cil Muffs, la. where lie is idolized by
his neighbors as he is by the people
of the state and country where lie, is
best, known.
We hope the years to come will deal
gently with General Dodge and that
he may be with us for a long time.
MORE OF HASSON BROTHERS.
A communication purporting to come
from Shenandoah, la. contains the in
teresting informatoin that a move is
about to be inaugurated whereby the
government of Syria proposes to have
the Hassen brothers, who were charg
ed with the murder of their cousin,
Fred Naufle, and convicted of the
crime, released from imprisonment.
The statement is made that attorneys
have already been employed to bring
about their release that the father
of the deceased has made a statement
in which lie claims that an investiga
tion discloses tho Hassen brothers
were not implicated in his son's death
and that they should be released from
custody.
It would be most remarkable if it
should turn out that the accused are
not guilty of the crime of murdering
their cousin in view of the fact that
.sentiment in the county was so pro
nounced against tho defendants at the
time of the trial, and the feeling ran
so high against the Hassen boys that
even their counsel who worked prac
tically without a fee were censured
for the performance of their duty in
defending the defendants.
Judging from what is stated in the
communication we scarcely believe
that the evidence claimed has been
discovered. Whether the boys are
guilt.v or not there i: such un aggre
gation of circumstances against them
that it would require a very strong
showing to secure the release which
Is suggested. We imagine llial when
the matter is carefully sifted it will
'develops that the report from Shenan
doah is more sensational than reliable.

pleased with the results and only last

used a liberal amount of advertising
space and it brought him big returns.
