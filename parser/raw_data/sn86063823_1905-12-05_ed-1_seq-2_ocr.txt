"centuries ago It was necessary to
safeguard the accused" in criminal
trials but now it has become more
necessary to safeguard the state
from ' the criminals who make the
laws for the benefit of the" trusts. '
Inasmuch as President Roosevelt
selected Herbert J. Hagerman for
governor of New Mexico, it is fair to
assume that the Pecos Valley man
had as much Influence in securing a
recommendation of the President that
gambling be prohibited in the Terri
tory as the President had In shaping
the views of the new governor on
the statehood question.
President Roosevelt selected for
governor a man from the first large
city of New Mexico to prohibit gam
bling a man whose father was large
ly responsible for the general move
ment against gambling in the Terri
tory. The President now asks con
gress to prohibit 'the licensing of
gambling in all the territories and
Roswell and Artesia are farther in
the lead than ever.
The 'President demands economy
in public expenditures, the abolish
ment of useless offices and the intro
duction, of business methods into the
various - departments of government.
Just what New Mexico is promised
under the new governor and joint
statehood. Half the offices of New
Mexico and Arizona will be abolish
ed under jointure, and in the mean
time Mr. Hagerman will introduce
economy and business methods into
the Territorial government.
NOW YOU'RE SHOUTING.
It is said we will soon have a joint
statehood governor, but it is hoped he
will exercise his opinion in the mat
ter as well as other political con
cerns, as Mr. Hagerman, not as Gov
ernor Hagerman. Springer Stock
man (Dem.)
The Record feels safe in assurim
the Stockman that Mr. Hagerman
will do just that thing. He will not
make any effort at coercing his ap
pointees to do anything but work for
the best interests of the whole Ter
ritory. On matters In which there
is honest difference of opinion he
will allow them to reach their own
conclusions.
The President's Message
titious damages, or of a concession,
a free pass, reduced passenger rate,
or payment of brokerage, is illegal.
is worth while considering whether
it would not be wise to confer on the
Government the right of civil actiov
against the beneficiary of a rebate for
at least twice the value of the rebate
this would help stop what is really
blackmail. Elevator allowances
should be stopped, for they have now
grown to such an extent that they
are demoralizing and are used as re
bates.
"The best possible regulation of
rates would, of course, be that regu
lation secured by an honest agree
ment among the railroads themselves
to carry out the law. Such a general
agreement would, for instance, at
once put a stop to the efforts of any
one big shipper or big railroad to dis
criminate against or secure advan
tages over some rival; - and such
agreement would make the railroads
themselves agents for enforcing the
law. The power vested in the Gov
ernment to put a stop to agreements
to the detriment , of the public should
in my judgment, be accompanied by
power to permit, under specified con
ditions and careful supervision, agree
ments clearly in the interest of the
public. But, in my judgment, the
necessity for giving this further pow
er is by no means as great as the neo
essity for giving the Commission or
administratice body the other pow
ers I have enumerated above; and it
may well be inadvisable to attempt
to vest this particular power In the
Commission or othter administrative
body until It already possesses and is
exercising what I regard as by far the
most important of all the powers
recommend as Indeed the vitally im
portant power that"'- to fix a given
maximum rate, which rate, after the
lapse of a reasonable time, goes Into
full effect. Subject to review by the
courts.
"All private-car lines, Industrial
roads, refrigerator charges, and the
like should be expressly put under the
supervision of the Interstate Com
merce Commission or some similar
body so far as rates," and agreements
practically affecting rates, . are con
cerned. The private-car owners and
the owners of industrial railroads are
entitled to a fair and reasonable com
pensation on their Investment, but
neither private cars nor Industrial
railroads nor spur tracks should be
utilized as devices for securing pre
ferential rates. A rebate in icing
charges, or in mileage, or in a divi
sion, of the rate ; for refrigerating
charges is just as pernicious as a re
bate in any other way. No lower rate
should apply on goods imported than
actually obtains on domestic goods
from the American seaboard to des
tination except in cases where water
competition, is the controlling jnfl'i
ence.. There' should be publicity of
the accounts of common carriers; no
common carrier engaged in interstate
business should keep any books or
memoranda other than those reported
pursuant to law or regulation, and
these books or memoranda should be
open to the inspection of the Govern
ment. Only in. this way can viola
tions or evasions of the law be sure
ly deteced. A system of examination
of railroad accounts should be pro
vided similar to that now conducted
into the national banks by the bank
examiners; a few first-class railroad
accountants, if they had proper direc
tion and proper authority to inspect
books and papers, could accomplish
much in preventing willful violations
of the law. It would not be necessary
for them to examine into the ac
counts of any railroad unless for good
reasons they were directed to do so
by the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion. It is greatly to be desired that
some way might be found by which
an agreement as to transportation
within a State intended to operate as
a fraud upon the Federal interstate
commerce laws should be brought un
der the jurisdiction of the Federal
authorities. At present it occurs that
large shipments of interstate traffic
are controlled by concessions on pure
ly State business, which of course,
amounts to an evasion of the law.
The Commission should have power
to enforce fair treatment by the great
trunk lines of lateral and branch
lines.
"I urge upon the Congress the need
of providing for expeditious action by
the Interstate Commerce Commission
in all these Tnatters, whether In regn
lating rates for transporation or for
storing or for handling property or
commodities In. transit. The history
of the cases litigated under the pre
sent commerce act shows that Its ef
ficiency has been to a ' great degree
destroyed by the weapon of delay, al
most the most formidable weapon in
the hands of those whose purpose it
is to violate the law.
"Let me most earnestly say that
these recommendations are not made
in any spirit of hostility to the rail
roads. On ethical grounds, on
grounds, of right, such hostility
would be intolerable; and on grounds
of mere national self-interest we must
remember that such hostility would
tell against the welfare not merely of
some few rich men, but of a multi
tude of small investors, a multitude
of railway employees, wage-workers;
and most severely against the inter
est of the public as a whole. I be
lieve that on the whole our railroads
have done well and not ill; but the
railroad men who wish to do well
should not be exposed to competition
with those who have no such desire
and the only way to secure this end
is to give to some Government tri
bunal the power to see that justice is
done by the unwilling exactly as it
is gladly done by the willing. More
over, if some Government body is
gen increased power the effect will
be to furnish authoritative answer on
behalf of the railroad whenever Ir
rational clamor against it is raised,
or whenever charges against it are
disproved. I ask this legislation not
only in the interest of the public but
in the interest of the honest railroad
man and honest shipper alike, for it
is they who are chiefly jeoparded by
the practices of their dishonest com
petitors. This legislation should be
enacted In a spirit as remote as pos
sible from hysteria and rancor. Jf
we of the American body politic are
true to the traditions we have inher
ited we shall always scorn any effort
to make us hate any man because he
is rich.-just as much as we. should
scorn any effort to make us look
down upon i or treat contemptuously
any man. because he is poor. "We
judge a man byvhis eonduct that is
by ' his character- and not by his
wealth or intellect. If he makes his
fortune honestly, there is no Just
cause of quarrel with him. Indeed
we have nothing but the kindliest
feelings of admiration for the suc
cessful business man' 'who behaves
decently, whether he has made his
success by building or managing a
railroad or by shipping goods over
that railroad. ' The big railroad men
and big shippers are simply Ameri
cans, of ordinary type who have de
veloped to an extraordinary degree
certain great business qualities. They
are - neither better nor - worse than
their felllow-citlzens of : smaller
means. They are merely more able
in certain lines and therefore expos
ed to certain peculiarly strong temp
tations. These temptations have! not
sprung, newly into being; the excep
tionally . successful among mankind
have always been exposed to them ;
but they have grown amazingly in
power as a result of the extraordina
ry development of industrialism along
new lines, and under these new con
ditions, which 4 the lawmakers or oia
could not forsee and therefore could
not provide against, they -"have be
come so serious and menacing as io
demand entirely new remedies. It is
in the interest of the best type of rail
road .man and the best type of shipper
no less than of. the public that tnere
should be governmental supervision
and regulation 'of these great busi
ness operations, for the same reason
that It Is In the interest of the corpor
ation which wishes to treat Its em-
ployees aright that there should be
afl effective employers' liability act,
or an effective system of factory laws
to prevent the abuse of women and
children. All such legislation frees
the corporation that wishes to do
well from being driven into doing ill
In order to compete with it which pre
fers to do 111. We desire to set up a
moral standard. There can be no delu
sion more fatal to the Nation than the
delusion that the standard of, profits,
of business prosperity is sufficient in
judging any business or political ques
tion-irpm rate legislation to municipal
government. Business success, wheth
er for the individual or for the Nation
is a good thing only so far as it is
accompanied by and develops a high
standard of conduct honor, integri
ty, civic courage. The kind of busi
ness prosperity that blunts the stand
ard of honor, that puts an inordinate
value on mere wealth, that makes a
man ruthless and conscienceless in
trade and weak and cowardly in citi
zenship, Is not a good thing at all,
but ' a very bad thing for the Nation.
This Government stands for man
hood first and for business only as an
adjunct of manhood.
"The question of transportation lies
at' the root of all industrial success,
and the revolution in transportation
which has taken place during the last
half century has been the most impor
tant factor in the growth of the new
industrial conditions. Most emphat
ically we do not wish to see the man
of great talents refused the reward
for his talents. Still less do we wish
to see him penalized; but we do de
sire to see the system of railroad
transportation so handled that the
strong man shall be given no advan
tage over the weak man. We wish to
insure as fair treatment for the
small town as for the big cities; for
the small shipper as for the big ship
oer. In the old days the highway of
commerce, whether by water or by a
road on land, was open to all; it be
longed to the public and the traffic
along it was free. .At present the rail
way is this highway, and we must do
our best to see that it is kept open to
ill on equal terms. Unlike the old
highway it Is a very difficult and com
ilex thing to manage, and it isfar
better that it should be managed by
private individuals than by the Gov
ernment. But it can only be so man
aged on condition that justice is done
the public. It is because, in my judg
ment, public ownership of railroads
is highly undesirable and would prob
ably in this country entail far reach
ing disaster, that I wish to see such
supervision and regulation of them
in the interest of the public as will
make it evident that there is no need
for public ownership.
Safety Appliances.
In my annual message to the Fifty-eighth
Congress, at its third ses
sion, I called attention to the neces
sity for legislation requiring the use
of block signals upon railroads en
gaged in interstate commerce. The
number of serious collisions upon un
blocked roads that have occurred
within the past year adds force to the
recommendation then made. The
Congress should provide, by appro
Driate legislation, for the introduc
tion of block signals upon all rail
roads engaged in interstate com
merce at the earliest practicable date
as a measure of increased safety to
the traveling public.
Hours cf Labor of Railroad
Employees.
The excessive hours of labor
to
which railroad employees in train ser
vice are in many cases subjected is
also a matter which may well engage
the serious attention of the Congress
The strain, both mental and physical
upon, those who are engaged in the
movement and operation of railroad
trains under modern conditions is per
haps jrreater than that which exist
in any other industry, and if there
are any reasons for limiting by law
the hours of labor in any employment
they certainly aoply with peculiar
force to the employment of those up
on whose vigilance and alertness in
the performance of their duties the
safetv of all who travel by rail de
pends.
Labor.
"The National Government has as
a rule but little occasion to deal with
the formidable group of problems
connected more or less directly with
what is known as the labor question
for in the great majority of cases
these problems must be dealt with by
the State and municipal authorities
and not by the National Government
The National Government has con
trol of the District of Columbia, how
ever, and it should see to it that the
City of "Washington is made

gards parks, public playgrounds, pro-
Der regulation of the system or nous

vent all abuses in the employment oi

These will be useful chiefly as object
lessons, but even this limited amount
of usefulness would be of real nation
al value.
There has been demand for de
priving courts of the power to issue
iniimetions in labor disputes. Such
special limitation of the equity pow
ers of the courts would be most un
wise. It is true that some judges
have misused this power; but this
does not justify a denial of the power
any more than an improper excersise
of the power to call a strike by a la
bor leader would justify the denial
of the right to strike. The remedy is
to regulate the procedure by requir
ine the judge to give due notice to
the adverse parties before granting
the writ, the hearing to be ex parte
if the adverse party does not appear
at the time and place ordered.. What
is due notice must depend upon-the
facts of the case; It should not be us
ed as a pretext to permit violation of
law, or the jeopardizing of life or pro
perty. Of course, this would not author
ize the issuing of a restraining order
or injunction in any case in which it
is not already authorized by existing
law. : - -

general public. Every considerable
labor difficulty in which interstate
commerce is involved should be inves
tigated by the Government and the
facts efficially reported to""the public.
: "The .question of securing a healthy
pelf-respecting, and mutually sympa
thetic attitude as between employer
and employee, capitalist and wage
worker, is a difficult one. All phases
of the labor problem prove difficult
when approached. But the underly
ing principles, the root principles, in
accordance with which the problem
must be solved are entirely simple.
We can get justice and right dealing
only if we put as of paramount impor
tance the principle of treating a man
on his worth as a man rather than
with reference to his social position,
his occupation, or the class to which
he belongs. There are selfish and
brutal men in all ranks of life. If
they are capitalists their selfishness
and brutality may take the form of
hard indifference to suffering, greedy
Msregard of every moral restraint
which interferes with the accumula
tion of wealth, and cold blooded ex
nloitation of the weak; or, if they are
laborers, the- form of laziness, of sul
len envy of the more fortunate, and
fif willingness to perform, deeds of
-lurderous violence. Such conduct is
ji.st as reprehensible in one case as
in the other, and all honest and far-"
seeing men should 'join in warring
against it whenever it becomes mani
fest. Individual capitalist a-ad indi
vidual wage worker, corporation and
union are alike entiled to the protec
tion of the law, and must alike obey
the law. Moreover, in addition to
mere obedience to the law, each man
if he be really a good citizen, must
show broad sympathy for his neigh
bor and genuine desire to look at any
question, arising between them from
the standDoint of that neighbor no
less than from his own; and to this.
end it is essential that capitalist and
wage-worker should consult freely
one with the other, should strive to
bring closer the day when both shall
realize that are properly partners
and not enemies. To approach the
question which inevitably arises be
tween them solely from the stand
point which treats each side in the
mass as the enemy or tne otner side
in the mass is both wicked and fool
ish. In the past the most direful
among tne influences wnich nave
brought about the downfall of repub
lics has ever been the growth of the
class spirit, the growth of the spirit
which tends to make a man subordi
nate the welfare of the public as a
whole to the welfare of the particu
lar class to which he belongs, the sub
stitution of loyalty to class for loyal
ty to tbe nation. This mevitaoiy
brings about a tendency to treat each
man not on his merits as an individ-
iat ,but on his position as belonging
to a certain cla-s in the community.
If such a spirit grows up in this Re
public it will ultimately prove fatal
to us, as in the past it has proved fa
tal toevery community In which it
has become dominant. Unless we
continue to keep a quick and lively
sense of the great fundamental truth
that our concern is with the Individ
ual worth of the individual man, this
Government can not permanently
hold the place which it has achieved
among the nations.

constitutionally be extended to cov
er interstate transactions in insur
ance.' Recent events have emphasiz
ed the importance of an early and
exhaustive consideration of this ques
tion, to see whether it is not possible
to furnish better safeguards than the
several States have been able to fur
nish against corruption of the flag
rant kind which has been exposed. It
has been only too clearly shown
that certain of the men at the head
of these large corporations take but
small note of the ethical distinction
between honesty and dishonesty ;
they draw the line on this side oL
what may be called law-honesty, the
kind of honesty necessary in order to
avoid falling into the clutches of thB
law. Of course the only complete re
medy for this condition must be found
in an aroused public conscience, a
higher sense of ethical conduct in the
community at large, and especially
among business men. and In the great
profession of law, and in the growth
of a spirit wnicn condemns all dis
honesty, whether in rich man or in
poor man, whether it takes the shape
of bribery or of blackmail. But much
can be done ' by legislation which is
not only drastic but practical. There
is need of a far stricter and more uni
form regulation of the vast insurance
interests of this country.
The Revenues.
There is : more need of stability
than of the attempt to attain an ideal
perfection in the methods of raising
revenue; and the shock and strain to
the business world certain to attend
any serious change in these methods
render such change inadvisable un-
