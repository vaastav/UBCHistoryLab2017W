when a (lag of truce was hoisted by the Insurgent*,
which was answered In a similar manner by those In

then took place, and during tho conversation the

two of the Cubans. This art, treacherous as it was,

Cuba?The Position al tha I'rncldeot and
Prababla Action of t'eairaa.
Our Washington correspondence published
yesterday gives an account of a long inter
view which a delegation of Cubans, represent
ing the Junta and the Cuban government, had
with President Grant. The President received
this delegation very cordially, and listened, as
the despatch says, with profound attention to
what the gentlemen comprising ft. headed bj
Mr. Fesser, had to state. The Cubans argued
well their claims to recognition as belligerents
by the United States government, and when
the President remarked that there was
this important difference between Spain
and Cuba, that tbe former was a recognized
government and the latter was not, Mr. Fesser
replied that it was this difference which he and
Lis compatriots desired to see removed, and
that was the object of their appeal to the gov
ernment. "The United States," he said,
"make use of the incubus vitio?u? in dealing
with the question. They say wa are no gov
ernment because we are not recognized, and
that we are not recognized because we are no
government. The United States tie one of our
bands behind our back and allow Spain to
have both hands free, and then expect us to
fight on such unequal terms. Give us the most
ordinary fair play, whioh is all we ask, and
then let the strongest win." He argued that
this great republic should not aid a
European power to crush out the aspira
tion of a noble people, struggling heroically
to obtain their independence. "The course at
present pursued by the United States govern
ment, he said, "was entirely one-sided. The
Spaniards were allowed overy privilege; they
were permitted to get everything here neces
sary to carry on the war, while poor, struggling
Cuba was denied the same privilege. There
was hardly an ounce of powder used on Cuban
soil by the Spaniards that was not supplied
through some port of tho United States; yet
the Cubans were not allowed to send to their
country ships, ammunition or provisions." At
the conclusion of the interview the President
said he "could do nothing in his position as
Chief Magistrate but to eiocute the laws; but
that Congress would soon assemble and no
doubt would take the matter into prompt con
sideration and adopt the best course that could
be followed under the circumstances."
Although the President was very guarded in
his expressions to the Cuban delegation, his
reception of it and his cordial and long inter
view with ii miiHt be regarded as significant,
and especially ao when we consider that just
now ho is very much occupied in the prepara
tion of his tniMsa ?e and in other work con
nected with the assembling of Congress. But
his expression that Congress would no doubt
take the Cuban question into prompt consid
eration and adopt the best course that could
be followed under the circumstances is full of
meaning. It Implios that the Presidont
expects Congress will act upon the matter
very soon ; that he is already informed of the
sentiments or members, and that he prefers
to throw the responsibility upon that body. So
far so good. But tho President has not shown
in this Cuban business that moral oourago
which he had shown on former occasions dur
ing his public career, and which the country
has given him credit for. The House of
Representatives passed a resolution unani
mously last spring, expressing sympathy with
the Cubans and assuring the President of the
support of Congress in the official recognition
or Cuba whenever he might think proper to
take such action. Though tills resolution was
passed at the last hours of tho session and
when the Senate had not time to act upon it,
there oan be no doubt that the Senators agreed
with the Representatives. Then the people of
the country throughout every section con
curred with Congress in tha sentiment and
views expressed. The Republican Stats Con- I
vention of New York last September passed 1
resolutions, unanimously, in favor of the
Cubans and recommended their recognition by
the administration. Other publio and repre
sentative bodies in the different States have
acted similarly. The President, then, ought
not to have had any hesitation in according
belligerent righto, at least, to the Cubans on
the ground of public opinion or authority
from Congress. He has simply refused to act
on bis own responsibility and against the wish
of both the people and or their representatives.
And why has the President taken this strange
and unpopular course ? It could not be because
the Cubans had not actually acquired the char
acter or belligerents, for all the world knows,
and General Grant might have known, that
the Cubans have carried on a most berolo
struggle for more than a year; that they have
been gaining ground from the beginning of the
revolution; that Spain, with all her troops,
ships or war aud other resources, has been
losing ground, and that the patriots have
shown their ability and determination to sus
tain the war for independence. Has not the
President, against his own reelings and con
victions, submitted to the timid representa
tions, or misrepresentations, or members or his
( ubiuet ? Indeed, we can hardly resist the
conviction that misrepresentations have
reached hiin through the influence or inter
ested parties through Americans near his
advisers who are Spanish agents, and one of
whom, It Is said, received a fee of forty
thousand dollars from the Spanish govern
ment. If this be so, and there is reason to
believe It, what a blot upon the character of
the administration. What a want of penetra
tion and judgment. The pro-Spanish policy
of the government and almost persecution or
the Cubans could hardly have sprung from
regard for Spain, for it Is known that Spain
joined the other European Powers in endeav
oring to break up the republic at the com
mencement of our civil war. On the 7th of
June, 1801, less thaa two nonths after tbe
confederates fired udou Sua tor, the Spanish
govcrnmont issued ft decree forbidding the
United States to flt out or to obtain ships in
Spanish ports, and our war vessels were pro
hibited from remaining in any such ports for
more than twenty-four hours, except in stress
of weather or from absolute necessity?the
shortest time acoorded to a belligerent Power
in suoh cases?and arms or other supplies of
war were also expressly forbidden. This
was aimed directly against the United
States, for the Confederates at that
time had no ships. And it is well
known how the rebel blockade runners and
cruisers afterwards found shelter and protec
tion in ports belonging to Spain. Our govern
ment, then, certainly did not owe Spain uny
favors in the present case of Cuba. But it is
on higher ground than this the United Slates
should have acted, and ought now to act, in
recognizing the Cubans as belligerents, or
their independence. This country is deeply
interested in the establishment and develop
ment of republican institutions on this Conti
nent and ovor the islands pertaining to it, in
the enlargement of our relations had commerce
with all the people of America, and in exclud
ing the despotic rule of European nations from
this hemisphere whenever a favorable and
reasonable opportunity occurs, such as that
which is now presented in the case of Cuba.
We might speak of the noble and generous
impulses of Americans for a people like the
Cubans, struggling for their independence, but
we put the question of recognition on the
ground simply of a broad national policy.
Report of th? Commissioner of Internal
BevnM.
Wo publish to-day the report of the Com
missioner of Internal Revenue. Mr. Delano
makes a gratifying exhibit of the revenue
income through his office and shows a steady
Increase over that exhibited in previous reports.
This Increase, though due to some extent to
the growth of the country in wealth and popu
lation, is to be attributed mainly to an improve*
ment in the revenue laws and to a more faithful
collection of the taxes.
The total receipts from Internal revonue
sources, exclusivo of the direct tax upon lands
and the duty upon the circulation and deposits
of national banks, were, for the fiscal year
ending June 80, 1869, $160,039,844. The
receipts for the current year are esti
mated at $175,000,000. This estimate is
based upon the revenue as now coming in.
The amount received from all sources for
the six months from the 1st of January, 1869,
to the 80th of June, 1869, was $90,542,760.
For the corresponding period of 1868 it was
$64,479,948. This shows again of $26,865,544.
General Grant's administration covers four
months out of six of this period, and there
fore it is but just to give that administration
the credit of this improvement in the internal
revenue receipts. This is the more evident
when we look at the increased receipts
from April to September of this year, during
the whole of which timo the present adminis
tration has been in power. There has been a
gain of over twenty-two millions, eleven mil
lions of which has been on the tax collected
from spirits and more than six millions and a
half from the tax on tobacco. Evidently, then,
the revenue lawn are better administered.
The Commissioner docs not recommend the
taking off any of the taxes, but soems desirous
of keeping up the revenue from all the present
sources.
One thing is worthy of remark %ere, and
that is, the banks and bankers only pay about
five millions a year to the government. When
we look at the stupendous wealth and business
of the banks and bankers, at the vast profits
they derive from the people, and at the enor
mous gains they reap from a national circula
tion, which the government has been stupid
enough to give them, this miserable contribu
tion to the revenue is a gross injustice to the
rest of the community. Cannot Congress
make these wealthy monopolists pay some
thing more to the support of the government ?
Mr. Delano does not recommend the repeal of
the inoome tax; but there Is no doubt the
time has arrived when the tax should be either
abolished altogether or modified so as to
exempt people with a limited and fixed salary
or inoome from this burden. In few other
respects, perhaps, it will be wise not to disturb
the internal revenue laws until the national
debt be adjusted and placed on a solid founda- |
tion, with a reduction of the interest and
establishment of a sure system of liquidation.
Polios Juanoss.?The duty of the Police
Justice is to take hold of accused criminals in
the lncipiency of eaoh case and decide whether
there be any cause to send the accused
for trial before a higher court. He may,
if he be evil disposed, or oorrupt, or
a political partisan, let loose upon society
some of Its worst members; and if he be just
and honest he can protect the community
against the ruffians who feast upon honest
people. We have had two or three cases of
late where blood has been shed and where
the vigor of an honest police magis
trate was all Important. We shall have more
of them, no doubt, as society is at present con
stituted in this oity, where the roughs in and
out of office and seeking office appear to have
a pretty full swing of their own way. In voting
for Police Justioes In the several districts,
to-morrow none but men of integrity, firmness
and experience should be chosen, wherever
they can be found on the tickets.
Gknkral Siibrman makes a Sappy sugges
tion to the government touching seals in bis
report as General of the army. It may be
thought that seals have but little relation to
the efficiency of the army or to our means of
making war, but as the suggestion is a good
one it matters ilttle whence it comes. He
proposes that we sell to those desiring to en
gage in the fishery of seals the islands bought
with Alaska, and believes that we may get for
them a price that will somewhat indemnify us
for the outlay on Alaska. It ought to be tried.
Mktter!Ucu'b Trap to Vienna.?The Aus
trian Minister at Paris has gone to Vienna and
this visit is naturally connected with the latest
point of dispute between Prussia and Austria.
In discussing with Prussia that point In the
treaty of Pragu* that relates to Schleswig
Ilolstein Austria evidently intends to move
with cautious regard to France, or perhaps it
is Franc* that keeps Austria keon to the in
dignity that Prussia puts upoa her In her non
ohalaut iMflsol ?f <&? tr?tty.
Report ?f Km Ncmtan Uw !<?*?.
We 1mra from Washington that 8?cr?tory
Robeson'? report to the President of the condi
tion of oar navy will contain several note
worthy and important recommendations. The
Secretary thinks that our naval force in
foreign waters is wholly inadequate to the
demands of American commerce. In March
last but forty-three vessels were In active
service in the various parts of the world, of
which not more than eighteen were in good
condition. Since then some fourteen have been
added and all the squadrons made, to a great
extent, efficient. Evon this addition is not
sufficiently great, and we agree with the Secre
tary in his recommendation to farther increase
the number. Ia the same waters that our squad
rons cruise Great Britain and France main
tain large naval forces, In every respect capa
ble of protecting their citizens and commerce
and of defending their national flags. We have
repeatedly urged the necessity of having large
and efficient squadrons at the various naval
stations. But for our paucity in numbers and
strength the Spanish authorities in Cuba
would not have dared to murder American
citizens at Santiago de Cuba with the cold
blooded Impunity tint they displayed. In this
connection wo are glad to learn that Secretary
Robeson reports having ordered Admiral Poor,
who sucoeeded Admiral Hoff, to prevent inter
ference with our commerce and to repel and
punish any disrespect to or violation of our
flag while preserving a strict neutrality
towards the Spaniards and Cubans,
In reference to the general oonditlon of the
navy wo learn that the report characterizes It
as being at a low ebb. It is urged that great
disadvantages attend the possession of so
many vessels dependent solely upon steam for
motive power, which makes them liable to be
easily disabled by reason of their complicated
machinery. Steamers, the Secretary, we
understand, thinks very poor schools of sea
manship for officers and men. This is very
true in a measure, but not* wholly so. It is,
nevertheless, a necessity that all our war ves
sels shall be bo constructed that they can use
either sails or steam, as necessity demands.
The good results arising from the allianoe of
the two motive powers are seen In the vessels
recently repaired by the department and put
Into commission. For example, the Severn,
Swatara, Juniata and Lancaster have, since
they wero repaired, attained a high rate of
speed under sail. The cost of repairing these
vessels and of placing the navy on a more
efficient footing has, we learn, been largo, but
by rigid economy the expense has been kept
below the sum expended by the department
during the same period last year.
With regard to our iron-clads, Secretary
Robeson does not think them in general fit
for other than homo service. His recom
mendation that the government construct ten
sea-going iron-clads on the same principle that
France and England have will be generally
approved. We need such vessels In our navy
for foreign Borvice. Our monitors, whilo
admirably adapted to home defence, cannot be
depended upon for long cruisos. They require
too many convoys, and If their machinery
becomcB disarranged they are rendered per
teotly helpless. The Secretary refers lu a
euloglstio manner to the torpedoes, and urges
attention to this branch of naval warfare. He
also thinks that the construction of swift and
strong ocean steamers by American ship
builders should bo encouraged by the govern
ment, they being in time of war powerful
auxiliaries to the regdlar navy.
Additional navy yards the Secretary thinks
desirable; those we have require repairs and
enlargement. Our timber lands demand better
protection than they have received for some
years past. The Naval Academy is spoken well
of. Referring to the per?onnel of the navy,
Secretary Robeson thinks that the character and
training of petty officers and seamen should
receive closer attention. We trust, though, that
our information is incorrect as to his remarks
regarding the cosmopolitan oharacter of the
sailors. However preferable it might be to
have as many native born Americans in our
navy as possible, the fact of a large number
of seamen being foreigners should not militate
against discipline, good morale and efficiency
to the slightest extent. Still, the recommenda
tion is a good one for the education of a class
of warrant and petty officers, as is also that in
flavor of increased pay, a system of ftirloughs,
pensions, honor* and, at times, bounties.
These last are not only Incentives to greater
eilclency, but they also attract a desirable
class of seamen to the navy.
We learn with pleasure that the Secretary
urges the prompt action of the government In
the matter of constructing a oanal across the
Isthmus of Darien. Explorations and surveys
should be commenced at once, as it would be
most mortifying for the United States to be
anticipated In the work. The important ques
tion of the relative ranks of naval officers the
Secretary declines to give an opinion about at
present, preferring to wait until the board of
officers having it under consideration shall
make a report, ne, however, thinks the ques
tion should be regulated by law.
Such, In brief, are the salient points in the
report, as our Information from Washington
gives them. The most notioeable feature if
the plain statement that our navy Is in a very
inefficient condition. That the necessity exists
for thus officially reporting it is to be regretted ;
but if the report should effect a change for the
better Its making will undoubtedly prove a
source of congratulation.
Scnooi. TRrsTtB#.?There is a school trus
tee to be elected in each ward to-morrow. The
care of the children who are to become our
future citizens will be to a great extent In the
hands of these men. Voters should therefore
exercise great judgment in selecting from the
candidates before them for these offices, such
as they are. There must be some men of intel
ligence and capacity among them, oven if they
are not entirely qualified for the position. At
all events the capacity to read and write
should be a nine qua non. We have had ex
amples of the violation of this rule before now.
Let us not have them thlf time.
WniTB CirTIVM WITH THB Indians.?The
very painful intelligence from the I iains that
the Cheyenne Indians hold captive more than
twenty white boys and girls, If it Is true, sug
gests the question as to what our troops are
doing out there. We have a considerable
| force at all the forts on the frontier from Fort
[ Leaveuworth to Ntw I* ^ uossible
that those children cannot be delivered from
the hand* of these (lends ? One of the cap
tives ia aaid to be a young Boston girl of
sixteen, whoee brothers were murdered by the
i Indians in Tez?s. The fate of this poor girl
Is horrible to think of and unnecessary to
speculate upon. Is it only cattle and mules
that are to be rescued from the Indians ?
General Sherman should look after this affair.
The ClwcbM aid Hermoun.
The city and suburban churches were not so
crowded yesterday as thoy usually ar? on the
Sabbath, owing to the disagreeable state of the
weather. We report the sermons which were
dolivered after service this morning. Some of
the clergymen found a sad text for exhorta
tion?one for recrimination and argument?in
the subject of the Richardson tragedy. The
Rev. O. B. Frothingham, whose name figures
so conspicuously on the record in connection
with the case, officiated and preached in the
lecture room of Lyrio Hall. About half the
members of the oongregation attend
ed. The reverend gentleman held lorth
on "Aspiration and Perfection," advising
his hearers against the cherishing of an un
due ambition in the "aspiration after virtue
and the perfection of holiness." From this he
passed on, not to an illustration of the consol
ing social fact that the first miracle wrought
by tho Saviour of the world was accomplished
at the marriage feast which He sanctified by
His presence in Galilee, but to a sort of pulpit
defiance of the publio opinion in sustainment
of the holy bond by classing it as a "clamor
about the outrago against social laws and the
blow levelled at the sacred marriage relation,"
winding up with a considerable deal of a
Stigglns-like?as Sam Weller would oall
it?"soft sawder" about "charity" and
"genius," and "talent" and "love," and
"culture" and "forgiveness" all round. In
the Universalist church Rev. Mr. Pullman
treated of "the libertine as worse than the
assassin." Rev. Henry Ward Beecher had
an exceedingly crowded house in Plymouth
church, Brooklyn. He did not, however, refer
to the Richardson oase, so that many devotees
returned home disappointed. The churches
of other different denominations were well
attended, the pastors and clergymen dis
charging tho duties of their commission to
preach and teach, to admonish and to reprove,
faithfully.
The Postmaster General'* Report.
We publish elsewhere the report of Post
master General Creswell. From it we learn
that the ordinary revenues of the department
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1869, wore
$18,344,510 and the expenditures $23,698,181,
showing a deficiency of $5,353,621. Mr.
Creswell holds that this deficiency is due to
three causes?namely, the depreciation of the
paper currency, unpaid postage on printed
matter and the franking privilege. The first
he regards as a temporary evil, which cannot
?ow be remedied; the second can be regu
lated by a stringent law, the passage of which
he recommends, and the third should be
abolished. By those means he believes tho
department can be made self-supporting. The
practical operations of the department during
the year were of a satisfactory natnre. Its
business Increased materially, proving a more
extensive correspondence, superinduced, doubt
less, by greater efficiency in the transmission
and delivery of the mails. All that remains
of the overland mail, by reason of the comple
tion of the Paciflo Railroad, is a route of ono
hundred and two miles from Cheyenne City to
Denver, which would doubtless be superseded in
a few months by railroad facilities. A careful
revision and readjustment of pay on railroad
routes is recommended. Referring to the
foreign mail service, which shows an increase
in the number of letters transmitted and
received and a small decrease in the
postage receipts, by reason of the reduction
in postage rates, Mr. Creswell urges
"the necessity of some legislation to
encourage the re-establishment of American
lines of transatlantic steamers." He declares
that "it is humiliating to our national pride to
find not only that our vaBt commerce with
Europe is monopolized by foreign steamship
lines, but that even the mails we send abroad
have to be transported under the protection of
foreign governments."
During the fiscal year the number of money
orders increased to 1,468 and the receipts to
$176,247, of which there was a surplus over
expenditures of $65,553. A further extension
of the system is recommended, its steady suc
cess having proved Its utility and the confi
dence of the people in its safety. On June 30,
1869, there were 27,106 post offices In opera
tion. Mr. Creswell recommends the adoption
of numerous measures calculated to increase
the efficiency of the department, all of whioh
are worthy of earnest consideration.
The Health Officer.?We have not heard
that the Governor has made any change yet in
the Health Officer's department. The publio
of all olasses, and the merchants especially,
are very anxious on this subject. They desire
to see the place filled by a competent physi
cian who knows something more than a mere
village practitioner's experience, and, above
all, they deBire that politios and politicians
should be kept out of a position to which tho
public health and a good deal of the commer
cial Interests of the city are entrusted. Per
haps the Governor is waiting for the assembling
of the Legislature in order to have his appointee
confirmed. With such a name as that of Dr.
Carnochan before them the Senate could not
hesitate a moment.
The Coin All Right.?Just after the great
gold uproar and tho installation of a new Sub
Treasurer here it was directed that tho coin
in the Sub-Treasury vaults should be counted.
This tedious job is now completed and the
coin is found to be all right, having suffered
no unauthorised diminution in the hands of
the late Assistant Treasurer.
Civil Justices.? Although the Civil Justics
has but a comparatively limited jurisdiction in
commercial oases, still there are a thousand
litigations coming before him which are of
considerable importance to the parties con
cerned, the fair adjustment of which renders
much vexatious legal proceedings unneces
sary. The Civil Justices to be elected to-mor
row should be men of probity and good stand
ing In the community. It Is essential also
that they should know least a little Uw.

J The second session of the Forty-Ural Con
grew begins at twelve o'clock to-day. There
Is no doubt of a quorum, although the mem
bers of the House of Represent* tiro#,
hare been unusually slow in arriving
at Washington. No time will be lost la
organizing both Houses of Congress, and
committees will duly notify the President that
it is ready to receive his Message and iU
accompanjing documents, which will, of
course, materially aid in giving shape and
action to its deliberations and decisions. It
is probable that Senator Wilson does not err
in predicting that this will be a strictly busi
ness session. The leaders of all shades of
political complexion appear, however, to bs
undetermined as to the course which they will
respectively follow. They are disposed to
await the President's Message before deciding
definitively upon that course. Most of tho
measures to be proposed and considered
will be previously discussed in caucus. It
seems likely that a principal feature of the
session will be the action of Congress as to the
funding of the national debt. Nor will the
tinkering of the revenue and tariff laws be
neglected. The prospect with referenoe to
questions of foreign policy is at present
altogether indefinite, although It may become
clearer if the message of the President shall
throw more light than is now anticipated upon
the Cuban question. It may likewise be
affected by the numerous petitions which are
to be presented in favor of tho recognition of the
belligerent rights of the Cuban revolutionists,
and of the annexation of Cuba. One of these
petitions is from Philadelphia and measures, It
is said, a mile and a half In length. Many of the
Western members will undoubtedly resume
the agitation of the question of the removal
of the capital, but other and more imme
diately urgent questions will probably engross
the attention of Congressmen during the pre.
sent session.
The Fnrman Street Man Trap A rain.
Yesterday afternoon the residents of
Brooklyn south of the Fulton ferry were
startled by a heavy concussion, which proved
to emanate from the fall of a couple of ware
houses in course of construction on the
ever fatal Furman street. Fortunately it was
Sunday and the buildings as well as the neigh
borhood were doserted, or the loss of life might
have been appalling. The buildings fell out
wardly from the hillside in which they were
burrowing, and, toppling over, left a frightful
chasm extending to the street on the heights
above. By a rare chance there were no
cars on the stroet below, although two linos are
constantly bearing passengers to and fro along
its railway tracks, or, Sunday as It
was, there might have been a sudden
inhumation of human beings beneath the mass
of bricks and rafters. Is it not time that the
corporative authorities of Brooklyn took steps
to prevent a recurrence of these disasters?
Either the line of Furman street should be
abandoned as a system of dwellings and store
houses, or tho crest of the hill should be
deprived of its superincumbent weight of
buildings. Originally it was proposed to lay out
a river side park on the west side of Columbia
street, which is the thoroughfare running
along the Heights, and thus afford a drive
commanding a view of our picturesque bay
and harbor. Butter a consummation of this
plan, which would add a beautiful feature to
Brooklyn geography, than the continuance of
the present dangerous system of houses whose
gardens overlie the roofs of the houses below.
The Ekie Suit of Ramsey against Gould
and others soems to have dwindled for some
days past to a game of ruses and strhtagems
in the attompted service of papers. The affi
davits of the many men who have been In
pursuit of Gould and Lane, who have watched
them through their windows and waited for
them on many corners, present the lives of three
railroad magnates in a new and not enviable
light. How, after all, is a railroad president
any better than a street beggar if he is not
a little more the master of his own destiny ?
And what is the value of richos if they do not
enable one to hold up his head in independence
of spirit? For men to be seen thus dodging
in and out of their houses and offices and
afraid of overy shadow, lest it might be a man
"with papers," Is a mean spectacle, and we
are glad that Judge Murray, in view of the
evasions of his order, has directed that the
papers may be served through tho Post Offlo*
or by being affixed to the front doors of tho
dodgers' houses.
The Western Members of Conqbbm oh
the Removal or thk Capital.?It la said
that General Logan and several other Western
members of Congress have determined to
make the question of the removal of the cap
ital from Washington to some point in the
West a prominent feature of the preaent ses
sion. We hope they do not mean by this to
distract the attention of Congreaa from more
Important measures, such as the independence
of Cuba, the flnanoea of the country, the inter
nal revenue laws, and many other questions
of vastly more importance, or to fritter away
its time with lengthy discissions. The removal
of the oapital can afford to wait It will
come in its own good time.
The Use of Guizot.?M. Guizot has writ
