FOREIGN RELATIONS.
FAVORABLE ASPECT OF AFFAIRS
Ythe Congress of the United States: At
^threshold of your deliberations I con
nate you upon the favorable aspect of
[domestic and foreign affairs of this
nment. Our relations with other na
continue to be on a friendly footing,
tbo Argentine .Republic, Austria,
im, Brazil, Denmark, Haiti, Italy,
•toDomingo and Sweden and Norway,
fincident has occurred which calls for
eial comment. The recent opening of
new
lines of telegraphic communication
Central America and Brazil permitted
[interchange of messages of friendship
the governments of these countries,
Dg
the year there have been perfected
proclaimed consular and commercial
ties with Servia, and a consular treaty
iKoumania, thus extending our Inter
with the Danubean countries. While
eastern relations have been upon a wide
iis by treaties with Corea and Madagas
|r, the new boundary survey and other re
^ons with Mexico, and the trades mark
jivention, and the supplementary treaty
{extradition with Spain, and the conven
0 extending the duration of the Franco
oerican claims commission have also
proclaimed.
ICE OF THE TERMINATION OF THE
FISHERIES ARTICLES
fthe treaty of Washington was duly given
»the British government. The privileges
1 exemptions of the British government,
tne reciprocal privileges and exemp
ts ot the treaty, will accordingly close
I July 1, 1885. The fisheries' industry
nsned by a numerous class of our citizens
the northern coasts, both of the Atlantic
Pacific oceans, are worthy of the
jring of congress whenever brought
competition with like industries ot
_r countries. Our fishermen as well as
manufacturers' of fishing appliances
ipreparers' of fish products, hiive main
nM a foremost place. 1 suggest that
gogress create a commission to consider
question of our rights in the fisheries
jibe means of opening to our citizens
der just and enduring conditions the
lehly-stocked fishing waters and sealing
lounds of British and North America.
ASSISTED IMMIGRATION.
r^be
question has arisen touching the
lgi|pnt»tion to the United States from the
islands by governmental or munl
pal aid of persons unable there to gain a
ving, and squally a burden on the com
mnitv here. Such of these persons as
ime under the pauper class, as defined by
mlftw. have been sent back in accordance
Jritfa tie provisions of our statutes. Her
ft Majesty's government has insisted that pre
nitons have been taken before shipment,
lis has, however, in so many cases proven
effectual, especially so in certain recent
itances of needy immigrants reaching our
rritory through Canada, that a revision of
tar legislation upon the subject may be
deemed advisable. Correspondence relative
lo the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty has been con-
Shraedand will be laid before congress.
If The legislation of France against the
IMPORTATION OF PREPARED SWINE
gmdoced from the United States has been
repealed. That result has been due no less
tothe friendly representations of this gov
ernment than to a growing conviction In
France that the restriction is not demanded
by any real danger to health. Germany
(till prohibits the introduction of swine
products from America. I extended to the
Imperial government a friendly in
vitation to send experts to the United
States to inquire whether the use
of these products was dangerous to
health. This invitation was declined. 1
have believed it of such importance, how
ever, that the exaet facts should be ascer
tained and promulgated, that 1 have ap
pointed a competent commission to make a
thorough investigation of the subiect. Its
members have shown their public spirit by
accepting their trust without pledge of com
pensation, but I trust congress will see in
the national and international bearings of
fhe matter a sufficient motive of providing
atjeasttorthe reimbursement for such ex
pellee as they may necessarily incur.
THE CORONATION OF THE CZAR
at Moscow afforded to this government an
occasion for testifying its continued friend
ship by sending a special envoy and repre
sentative of the navy to attend the cere
mony. While there has arisen during the
Tear no grave question affecting the status
the Russian empire of American citizens
of other faith than that held by the national
chnrch. this government remains firm in its
csnvictioa that the rights of her citizens
abroad should be in no way affected by their
religious belief.
It is understood that measures for the re
movalof the restrictions which now burden
our trade with
CUBA AND PORTA RJCA
are under consideration by the Spanish gov
ernment. The proximity of Cuba and the
peculiar mode of administration which there
prevails necessitates constant discussion
and appeal on our part from the proceedings
of the consular authorities. I regret to say
that the just protests of this government
hare not as yet produced a satisfactory re
sult The commission appointed to decide

A convention
was signed with Mexico on
uly 13,188a, providing for the rehearing of
the causes of Benjamin Weiles, the Abra
Silon Mining company, in whose favor
awards were made by the late American
and Mexican claims convention. That
convention still awaits the consent of the
senate. Meanwhile, because of the charges
of fraudulent awards which have made a
new commissoner necessary, the executive
has directed the suspension of payments of
the distribution quota received from Mex
ico, Our geographical proximity to
CENTRAL AMERICA
and our political and commercial relations
with the states of that country justify, In
my judgment, such a material increase of
our consular corps as will place at each
capital a consul general. The contest be
tween Bolivia, Chili and Peru has passed
from the stage of strategic hostilities to that
of negotiations in which the consuls of the
government have been exercised. The de
mands of Chili lor the absolute
cession of territory have been
maintained and accepted by the
party of Gen. Iglesias to the extent of con
cluding a treaty of peace with the terms of
the protocol signed in May last between the
Chilian government and Gen. Iglesias. As
a result of the conclusion of this treaty
Gen. Iglesias has been formally recognized
by Chili as president of Peru, and has a
government installed at Lima which has
been evacuated by the Chilians. A call has
been issued by Gen. Iglesias for a repre
sentative assembly to be elected on the 13th
of January and to meet at Lima
on the 1st of March next. Meanwhile the
provisional government of Gen. Iglesias
has applied for the recognition of the prin
cipal powers of America and Europe when
the will of the Peruvian people shall be
manifested. I shall not hesitate to recog
nize the government approved by them.
Diplomatic and naval representatives of
this government attended at Caracus the
centennial celebration of the birth of the
illustrious Bolivar. At the same time the
inauguration of the statue of Washington in
the Venezuelan capital testified the devo
tion in which his memory is held there.
Congress at its last session authorized the
executive to' propose to the Venezuelan
government a reopening of
THE AWARDS OF THE MIXED COMMISSION
of Corea. The departure from this country
of the Venezuelan minister has delayed the
opening of negotiations for reviewing the
commission. This government holds that
until the re-establishment of a treaty on
this subject the Venezuelan government
must continue to make the payments pro
vided for in the convention of 1S66. There is
ground for believing that the dispute grow
ing out of unpaid obligations due from Ven
ezuela to France will be satisfactorily ad
justed. The French cabinet has proposed
a basis of settlement which meets my ap
proval, but as it involves a recasting of the
annual quotas of the foreign debt, it has
been deemed advisable to submit the pro
posal to the judgment of the cabinets of
Berlin, Copenhagen, Tne Hague, London
and Madrid.
At the recent coronation of his majesty.
King Kalakua, this government was repre
sented both diplomatically and by the for
mal visit of a vessel of war. The question
of terminating or modifying the existing
reciprocity
TREATY WITH HAWAII
is now before congress. I am convinced
that the charges of abuse and frauds under
that treaty have been exaggerated, and I
renew the suggestion of last year's message
that the treaty be modified wherever its
provisions have proved onoreus to the legit
imate trade between the two countries. I
am not disposed to favor the entire cessa
tion of treaty relations which have fostered
good will between the countries and con
tributed toward the equality of Hawaii in
the family of nations.
In pursuance of the policy declared by
this government of extending our inter
course with the eastern nations, legations
have during the past year been established
in Persia, Siam and Corea. It is probable
that permanent missions of those countries
will ere long be maintained in the United
States. A special embassy from Siam is now
on its way hither. Treaty relations with
Corea were perfected by the exchange at
Seoul on the 19th of May last of the ratifica
tions of the lately concluded constitution,
and envoys from the king of Tahehasim
have visited this country and received a
cordial welcome.
COREA,
as yet unacquainted with the modes of
western civilization, now invites the atten
tion of those iaterested in the foreign trade,
as it needs the implements and products
which the United States are ready to sup
ply. We seek no monopoly of its commerce
and no advantages over other nations, but
as the Chinese, in reaching for a higher
civilization, have confided in this republic,
we cannot regard with indifference any
encroachments on their rights. China, by
the payment of a money indemnity, has
settled certain of the long-pending claims
of our citizens, and I have strong hopes
that the remainder will soon be ad usted.
Questions have arisen touching the
rigtits of American and other foreign manu
facturers in
CHINA
under the provisions of treaties which per
mit aliens to exercise their industries in
that country. On this specific point our
own treaty is silent, but under the oper
ations of the "most-favored-nations"
clause we have a like privilege with those
of other powers. While it is the duty of
the government to see that ourcitizens have
the full enjoyment of every benefit secured
by the treaty, I doubt the expediency of
leading in a movement to constrain
China to admit an interpretation of which
we have only an indirect treaty right. To
exact the transfer to China of American
capital for the employment there of Chinese
labor would in effect Inaugurate a competi
tion for the control of markets now sup
plied by our home industries. There is good
reason to believe that the law restricting
the immigration of Chinese has been vio
lated intentionally or otherwise by the
officials of China, upon whom devolves the
duty of certifying that the immigrants be
long to the excepted classes. Measures
have been taken to ascertain the facts Inci
dent to this supposed infraction, and it is
believed that China will co-operate with
the United States in securing the faithful
observance of the law. The same con
siderations which prompted congress at its
last session to return to Japan the
Semoneki indemnity seema [to me to re
requre at its hands like action in respect to
the Canton indemnity fund, now amount
ing to §300,000. The question of the general
revision of the foreign treaties of
JAPAN
has been considered In an international
conference held at Tokio, but without defi
nite result as yet. This government is dis
posed to concede the requests of Japan to
determine its own tariff duties, provide
such proper judicial tribunals as may com
mend themselves to the western powers for
the trial of causes to which foreigners are
parties, and to assimilate the terms and dur
ation of its treaties to those of other civil
ized states.
Through our ministers at London and
Moravia this government has endeavored
to aid
LIBERIA
in its differences with Great Britain touch
ing the northwestern boundaries of that re
public. There is a prospect of an adjust
ment of the dispute. The adoption of the
Marmot river as the line of this arrange
ment Is a compromise of the conflicting ter
ritorial claims, and takes Irom Liberia no
country over which it has maintained ef
fective jurisdiction. The rich and populous
valley ot the Congee is being opened to
commerce by aisociety called the interna
tional African association, of which the
king of the Belgians is president and afiitl
zen of the United States the chief executive
officer. Large tracts of territory have been
ceded to the association by native chiets,
roads have been opened, steamboats placed
on the rivers, and the nucleus of states es
tablished at twenty-two stations under our
flag, which offers freedom to commerce and
prohibits the slave trade. The objects of
the society are philanthropic. It does not
aim at the management of political coali
tion, but seeks the neutrality of the valleys.
The United States cannot be indifferent to
this work, nor to the interests of their citi
zens involved in it. lt may become advisa
ble for us to co-operate with other commer
cial powers in promoting the rights of trade
and residence In the Congee valley, free
from the interference or political influence
of any one nation. In view of the fre
quency of invitation from foreign govern
ments to participate in
SOCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC CONGRESSES
for the discussion of Important matters of
general concern, I repeat that suggession
of my last message—that provision JUe made
for the exercise of discretionary power by
the executive in appointing delegates to
such convention. Specialists are ready to
serve the nation in such capacity without
personal profit or other compensation than
the defrayment of expenses actually in
curred, and these a comparatively small
annual appropriation would suffice to meet.
I have alluded in my previous message to
the Injurious and vexatious restrlctlous
differed by our trade In the
SPANISH WEST INDIES.
Brazil, whose natural outlet tor its great
national staple, coffee, is in and through
the United States, imposes a heavy export
duty ou that product. An alike narrow
policy is pursued in other American coun
tries, and our petroleum exports are
hampered in Turkey and other east
ern ports by restrictions as to
storage, and by onerous taxation, and the
free outward movement of our great food
products is in some quarters clogged with
like implements for these mischiefs. Ade
quate relief is not always provided by reci
procity treaties like that with Hawaii, or
that lately negotiated with Mexico and now
awaiting the action of the senate, and is it
not advisable to provide some measure of
equitable retaliation In the relations with
governments which discriminate against
our own? If, for example, the executive
were empowered to apply to Spanish ves
sels and cruisers from Cuba ana Porto Klco
the same rules of treatment and scale of
penalties for technical faults which are ap
plied to vessels and cargoes in the Antilles,
a resort to that course might not be barren
of good results. A discretionary authority
to forbid the importation of articles of con
sumption injurious to health might be ad
vantageously exercised in our
dealings with
those countries that discriminate against
our food products.

CONDITION OF THE COAST DEFENSES.
I again call your attention to the present
condition of our extended sea coast, on
which are so many large cities whose
wealth and-Importance to the country
would In time of war invite attack from
modern armored ships, against which our
existing defensive works could give no
adequate protection. These works were
built before the Introduction by Germany
of heavy rifle guns into maratime warfare,
and If they are not put in efficient condi
tion we may be subjected to humilities by
a hostile power greatly inferior to our
selves. As germaln to this subject, I will
call your attention to the Importance of the
perfection of our submarine torpedo de
fenses. The board authorized by the last
congress to IVport a method which should
be adopted tor the manufacture of heavy
ordnance adapted to general warfare has
visited the inciple iron and steel works in
this count! and in Europe. It is hoped
that its port will be soon made, and that
congress will thereupon be disposed to pro
vide suit ible facilities and plans for the
manutac! uro of such guns as are now im
peratively needed.
THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY
reports that under authority of Ithe acts of
August 5,1SS2, and March 3,18S3, the work
of strengthening our navy by the construc
tion of modern vessels, has been auspi
ciously begun. Three cruisers are in prog
ress of construction, the Chicago, of 4,500
tons displacement, and the Boston and At
lanta, each of 2,500 tons. They are to be
built of steel, with the tensil, strength and
ductility prescribed by law, and in combi
nation of speed, endurance and armament
are expected to compare favorably with the
best unarmed war vessels of other nations.
A fourth vessel, the Dolphin, is to be con
structed of similar material, which is in
tends. to serve as a fleet dispatch boat.
The double turreted monitors Puritan. Am
phite and Terror have been launched on the
Delaware river and a contract has been
made for the supply of their machinery. A
similar monitor, the Madanock, has been
launched in California. The naval advisory
board and the secretary recommend the
completion of the monitors, the construc
tion of four gun boats, and also of three ad
ditional steel vessels like the Chicago, Bos
ton and Dolphin. As an
IMPORTANT MEASURE OF MATERIAL DE
FENSE
the secretary urges also the immediate crea
tion of a fast line of water ways across the
peninsula of Florida, along the coast from
Florida to Hampton Roads, between the
Cbesepeake bay and Delaware river, and
through Cape Cod. 1 feel bound to impress
on the attention of congress the necessity
of continued progress in the reconstruction
of the navy and the condition of the public
treasury, as
I have already intimated, makes
the present an auspicious time for putting
this branch of the service in a state of effi
ciency. it is no part of our policy to create
and maintain a navy able to cope with that
of the other great powers of the world. We
have no wish for foreign conquest, and the
peace which men have long enjoyed is in no
seeming danger of interruption, but that our
naval strength should be made adequate for
the defense of our harbors, the protection of
our commercial interests and the mainten
ance of our national honor is a proposition
from which no patriotic citizen can with
hold his assent.
THE STATE MILITIA.
On several occasions during the past
year officers of the army hsve at the request
of the state authorities visited their mili
tary encampments for the inspection ot the
troops. From the reports of those officers
I am Induced to believe that the encourage
ment of the state militia organization ly
the national government would be followed
by very gratifying results, and would afford
it in sudden emergencies the aid of a large
body of volunteers educated in the perform
ance of military duties.
TSIK FINANCES.
A HEALTHY CONDITION.
The report of the secretary of the treas
ury gives a full and interesting exhibit of
the financial condition of the country. It
shows that the ordinary revenues from all
sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1883, amounts to S398,2S7,581.95. Of this
there was received:
From customs $214,708,490.93
From internal revenue 144,720,368.95
From the sales of public lands.. 7,985,864.42
From tbe tax on circulation and

of bullion deposits and assays, 4,480.205.17
From other sources 17,333,637.60
Total $ 398,287,581.95
For the same period the ordinary expen
ditures were:
For civil expenses $22,343,285.76
For foreign intercourse 2,419,275.24
For Indians 73.625.9C3.47
For pensions 66,012,573.04
For the military establishment

For the naval establishment, in

For miscellaneous expenditures,
including public buildinfrs,
light-bouses and collecting the
revenues 40,098,432.74
For expenditures on account of
the District of Columbia 3,817,028.48
Forinterest on the public debt— 5,9160,131.25
Total $265,408,137.54
Leaving a surplus revenue of S132,879.
444.41, which, with an amount drawn from
the cash balance in the treasury of SI,299,
312 55, making §134,178,750.90. there was ap
plied:

est of other notes
13,300.00
Total $134,178,756.96
If the revenue for the fiscal year which
will end on Juno 30, 1885, be estimated on
the basis of existing laws, the secretary is
of the opinion that for that year the receipts
will exceed 560,000,000 and the ordinary ex
penditures, including the amount devoted
to the sinking fund. Hitherto the surplus
as rapidly as it has accumulated has been
devoted to
THE REDUCTION OF THE NATIONAL DEBT.
As a result the only bonds now outstand
ing which are redeemable at the pleasure of
the government are the 3 per cents, which
amount to about $305,000,000, the 4)4 per
cents, amounting to $250,000,000. The #737,
000,000 of 4 per cents are not payable until
1891 and 1907 respectively. If the surplus
shall hereafter be as large as the treasury
estimates now indicate the 3 percent, bonds
may all be redeemed at least four years be
fore any of the 4£ per cents can be called
in. The latter at the same rate of accumu
lation of surplus can be be paid at maturity,
and the moneys requisite for the redemption
of 4 per cents will be in the treasury many
years before those obligations become paya
ble. There are cogent reasons, however,
why the national indebtedness should not
be thus

RAPIDLY EXTINGUISHED.
Chief among them Is the fact that only by
excessive taxation is snch rapidity attaina
ble. In my communication to congress at
the last session recommended that ail ex
cise taxes be abandoned except those relat
ing to distilled spirits, and that substantial
reductions also be made on the revenues
tkt
from customs. A statute has since been
en
acted by which the annual tax and tariff re
ceipts of the government have been cut
down to the extent ot at least 850,000,000 or
860,000,000. While I have no doubt that
still further reductions maybe wisely made,
I do not advise the adoption at this ses
sion of any measure of large dimensions of
the national revenue. The results of the
legislation of the last session of congress
have not as yet become sufficiently apparent
to justify any direct revision or sweeping
modification of the existing law. Ia the in
terval which must elapse before the effects
of the act of March 3,1882,
can be definitely
ascertained, a portion at least of the sup
plus revenues may be wisely applied to the
long-neglected duty of rehabitatmg our na
tion and providing first-class defenses for
the protection of our harbors. This is a
matter to which I shall again advert.
Immediately associated with the finan
cial subject just discussed is the important
question what legislation is needed regard
ing
THE NATIONAL CURRENCY.
The aggregate amount of bonds now on de
posit in the treasury to support the national
bank circulation is about $350,000,000.
Nearly $200,000,000 of this amount consists
of 3 per cents, which, as already stated, are
payable at the pleasure of the government,
and are likely to be called In within less
than four years, unless meantime the sur
plus revenue shall be diminished. The
probable effect of such an extensive retire
ment of the securities which are the basis of
the national bank circulation, would be
such a contraction of the volume of the cur
rency as to produce grave commercial em
barrassments. How can the danger bo ob
viated? The most effectual plan, and one
which adoption at the earliest practicable
opportunity I shall heartily approve, has
already been Indicated. If the revenues in
the next four years shall be substantially
commensurate with the expenses, the vol
ume of the circulation will not likely suffer
any material disturbance but. if on the
other hand, there shall be great delay in re
ducing the tax, it will become necessary
either to
substitute another form of currency
to replace the national bank notes or to
make
IMPORTANT CHANGES
in the laws by which the circulation is now
controlled. In my judgment tho latter
course is far preferable. I commend your
attention to the very interesting and
thoughtful suggestions on this subject
which appear in tho secretary's report.
The objections which he urges against the
acceptance of any other securities than the
obligations of the government itself as a
foundation for national bank circulation
seems to me inseperable for averting the
threatened contractions. Two courses
have been suggested, either of which is
probably feasible. One is the issuance of
new bonds having many years to run, bear
ing a low rate of Interest, and exchangeable
upon specified terms]for|those]now[outstand
ing. The other course, which commends
itself to my own judgment as the better, is
tha enactment of a law repealing the tax on
circulation and permit the banks to issue
notes for an amount equal to 90 percent, of
the market value, instead of as now the face
value, of the deposited bonds. I agree
with the secretary in the belief that the
plan will afford tho necessary relief.

was coined for the purpose of traffic In
countries where silver passed at its value
ascertained by its welghtjand fineness. It
never had a legal tender quality. Large
numbers of the coins entered, however, the
volume of our currency by common consent.
Their circulation in domestic trade has now
caused trouble, and they have become a dis
turbing element. They should not be lon
ger permitted to embarrass our currency
system. I recommend that provisions be
made for their reception by the treasury
and mints as bullion at a small percentage
above the current market price of silver of
like fineness.
The secretary ot the treasury advises a
CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN CUSTOMS DIS
TRICTS
of the country and suggests that the presi
dent be vested with such
Dower
in relation
thereto, as is now given him in regard to
the collections of internal revenue, by sec
tion 3141 of the revised statutes. The sta
tistics on this subject which are contained
in his report, furnish of themselves a crown
ing argument in defense of his views. At
the adjournment of congress the number of
internal revenue collection districts was 126.
By executive order of June 25, 18S3,1 di
rected that certain of these districts be con
solidated. The result has been a reduction
of one-third in the number, which at pres
ent Is but'eighty-three.
THE POSTAL SERVICE.
A GRATIFYING EXHIBIT.
The report of the postmaster-general con
tains a gratifying exhibit of tho condition
and prosperity of this branch of the public
service committed to his care. It appears
that on June 30,1883, the whole number of
postoffices was 47,863, of which 1.C32 were
established during the last previous fiscal
year. The number of offices operating un
der the system of free delivery was 154. At
the latter offices the postage on local matter
amounted to 54,195,230,522, a sum exceeding
by S102,1S9,401 the entire cost of the carriers'
service of the country. The rate of postage
on letters passing through these offices Is
now fixed by law at2 cents per half ounce,
or fraction thereof. In offices where the
carrier system has not been established the
rate is only half as laree. It will be remem
bered that in 1S63, when free de
livery was first established by
law, the uniform single rate of
postage upon local letters was 1 cent, and so
It remained until 1872, when in those cities
where carriers' service was established it
was increased to defray the expense of such
service. It seems to me that the old rate
may now with propriety be restored that,
too, even at the risk of diminishing for a
time at least the receipts from postage
upon local letters. I see no reason why
that particular class of mall matter shonld
be held double for the entire cost, not only
of its collection and delivery, but the col
lection and delivery of all other classes.
And I am confident that after full consid
eration of the subject the reduction of the
rate would be followed by such a growing
accession of business as to occasion but
slight and temporary loss to the revenues of
the postoffice.
The postmaster-general devotes much of
his report to the consideration in various
aspects of
RELATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO THE
TELEGRAPH.
Such reflection as I have been able to give
to this subject since my last annual mes
sage has not led me to change the view
which I then expressed in dissenting from
the recommendation of tho postmaster-gen
eral that the government assume tbe same
control over the telegraph which it has al
ways exercised over the mails. Admitting
that its authority In the premises is as am
pleas has ever been claimed for it, it would
not, in my judgment, be a wise move for the
government to purchase or assume the con
trol of existiag telegraph lines or to construct
others with a view of entering into general
competition with private enterprises.
The objections which may be justly urged
against either of these projects, and indeed
against any system which would require
an enormous increase in the civil service
do not, however, apply to some of the plans
which have lately provoked public comment
and dissension. It has been claimed, for
example, that congress might wisely
authorize the postmaster-general to con
tract with some private person or corpora
tion for the transmission of messages at
specified rates and under government
supervision.
VABIOUS SUCH SCHEMES
of the same general nature, but widely dif
fering In their special characteristics, have
been suggested in tbe public prints, and the
arguments by which they have been sup
ported and opposed have doubtless attracted
your attention, lt Is likely that the whole
subject will be considered by you at the
present session. In the nature of things It
Involves so many questions of detail that
your deliberations would not probably be
aided slightly, if at all, by any particular
suggestions which I might now submit. I
avow my belief, however, that the govern
ment should be authorized by law to exer
cise some sort of supervision over inter
state telegraphic communication, and I ex
press the hope that for attaining that end
some measure may be devised which will
receive your approbation.
THE INTERIOR.
VARIOUS IMPORTANT SUBJECTS.
Much interesting and varied informatmP
is contained In the report of the secretary
of the interior. I particularly call your at
tention to his presentation of certain phrases
of the Indian question to his recommenda
tions for the repeal of the pre-emption and
timber culture acts, and for more stringent
legislation to prevent frauds under the pen
sion laws. The statutes which prescribe
the definitions and punishment of crimes re
lating to pensions could doubtless be made
more effective by certain amendments and
additions that are pointed out in the secre
tary's report.
I have previously referred to the
ALARMING STATE OF ILLITERACY
in certain portions of the country, and
again submit for the consideration of con
gress whether some federal aid should be
extended to public primary education
where adequate provision therefor has not
already been made.
THE UTAH COMMISSION
has submitted to the secretary of the inte
rior its second annual report in full of its
labors in supervising the recent election in
that territory.
Pursuant to the act of March 23,1883, it
appears that the persons by that act dis
qualified, numbering about 12,000, were ex
cluded from the polls. This fact, however,
alfords little cause for congratulation, and I
tear that It is far from indicating any real
and substantial progress toward the extir
pation of polygamy. All of the members
of the legislature are Mormons. There is
grave reason to believe that they are in
sympathy with the practice that this gov
ernment is seeking to suppress, and that
its efforts in that regard will more likely
encounter their opposition than receive
their encouragement and support. Even
if this view should happily be erroneous
the law under which the commissioner
has been acting should be made more ef
fective by the Incorporation of some such
stronger measure that they recommend, as
was included- in bill No. 2,233, on the roll
of the senate at its last session. lam con
vinced, however, that polygamy has be
come strongly entrenched in the territory
of Utah that it is profitless to attack it
withanybutthe stoutest weapons which
constitutional. legislation make. I favor,
therefore, the appeal of the act upon which
the existing government-depends, and the
resumption by the national legislature of
the entire political control of the territory,
and the establishment of a commission with
such powers and duties as shall be delega
ted to it by' law.
From tho report of the secretary it will
be seen that in only one single instance has
there been a disturbance of the quiet condi
tion of our Indian tribes—the raid from
Mexico into Arizona by a small party of In
dlans, which was pursued by Gen. Crook
into the mountain regions, from which lt
had come. It is confidently hoped that seri
ous outbreaks will not again occur, and
that the Indian tribes which have for many
years disturbed the west will hereafter re
main in peaceable submission.
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
Is accomplishing much in the direction of
the agricultural development of the
country, and the report of the commis
sioner giving the results of his investiga
tion and experiments will be found inter
esting and valuable. At his instance a con
vention of those interested in the cattle in
dustry of tbe country was lately held at
Chicago. The prevalence of pleuro-pneu
monia and other contagious diseases of
animals was one of the chief topics of dis
cussion. A committee of the convention
will invite your co-operation in investigat
ing the cause of these diseases and provid
ing methods for their prevention and cure.
1 trust congress will not fail at its present
session to put
ALASKA
under tho protection of the law. Its people
havo repeatedly remonstrated against our
neglect to afford them the maintenance
and protection expressly granted by the
teruis of the treaty whereby that territory
was ceded to the United States. For six
teen years they have plead in vain for that
which they should have received without
the asking. Thev have no law for the col
lection of debts, the support of education,
the conveyance of property, the adminis
tration of estates or the enforcement of
contracts—none indeed for the punishment
of criminals, except such as are afforded
by certain customs of the commerce and
navigation acts. The resources of Alaska,
especially In fur, mines and lumber are
considerable in extent and capable of large
development, while in its geographical
situation it is one ot political and commer
cial importance. Tho promptings of inter
est, therefore as well as the considerations
of honor and good faith, demand the im
mediate establishment of civil government
in that territory.
RAILROAD CORPORATIONS.
Complaints have lately been urgently
made at tho action of certain corporations
controlling the whole or in part, the facili
ties for the inter-state carriage of persons
and merchandise upon the great railroads
of the country, which have resorted in their
dealings with the public to divers measures,
unjust and oppressive in their character.
In some instances the state governments
have attacked and suppressed these evils,
but in others they have been unable to af
ford adequate protection because of the ju
risdiction limitations which are imposed on
them by the federal constitution. The ques
tion how far tbe national government may
lawfully interfere in the premises, and what
If any supervision or control it ought to ex
ercise, is one which merits your careful

tion to the necessity of protection by suita
ble legislation.
THE FORESTS SITUATED UPON THE PUBLIC
DOMAIN.
In many portions of the west the pursuit of
general agriculture Is only made practicable
by resort to irrigation, while such useful ir
rigation would be impossible without the
aid afforded by the forests in contributing
to the regularity and constancy of such
supply of wattr. During the past year se
vere sufferings and great loss to property
has been occasioned by profuse floods, fol
lowed by periods of unusually low water in
many ot the great rivers ot the country.
The irregularities are in a great measure
caused by the removal from about the
sources of the streams in question of the
timber by which the water supply has been
nourished and protected. The preservation
of such portions of the forests on the na
tional domain as essentially contribute to
the equitable flow of Important water
courses is of the highest consequence. Im
portant tributaries of tbe Missouri, the
Columbia and the baskatahewaD rise in the
mountains of Montana near the northern
boundary of the United States, between
the Blacktoot and Flathead Indian reserva
tions. This region is unsuitable for set
tling, but upon the rivers which flow from
it depends the future agricultural develop
ment of a vast tract of country. The at
tention of congress is called to the neces
sity of withdrawing from public sale this
part of the public domain and establishing
there a forest preserve.
THE INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITIONS
which have been held In tbe United States
during the present year have attracted tbe
attention of many foreign countries when
tbe announcement of these enterprises had
been made public through the foreign agen
cies of this government. The industrial
exhibition at Boston and southern exposi
tion at Louisville were largely attended by
the exhibitors from foreign countries not
withstanding the absence of any profes
sional character in these undertakings. Tbe
centennial exposition, to be held next year
at New Orleans In commemoration of the
century of the first shipment of cotton
from a port of tbe United States, bids
fair to meet with like gratifying
success. Under the act of congress of the
lOthof February, 1883, declaring that expo
sition to be national and international in its
character, foreign governments with which
the United States maintain relations have
been invited to participate, and the pro
moters of this important undertaking have
already received assurances of the lively
interest which is excited abroad. The re
port of the commiss loner of
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
is herewith transmitted. I ask for it your
careful attention, especially for those por
tions which relate to assessment, arrears of
taxes and water supply.
CIVIL SERVICE.
The commissioners who were appointed
under tho act of January 16, 1883, entitled
An act to regulate and improve the civil
service of the United States," entered
promptly upon the discharge of their duties.
A series of rules framed in accordance with
the spirit of the statute were approved and
promulgated by the President. In some
particulars wherein they seemed defective
these rules were subsequently amended.
They provide for the discontinuance of any
political or religious tests for admission to
the offices of the public service to which the
statutes relate. The act Is limited in its
original application to the classified clerk
ships in the several executive departments
at Washington, numbering about
5,600, and
to similar positions in customs districts and
postoffices, where as many as fifty persons
are employed. A classification of these
positions analogous to that ex
isting in the Washington of
fices was duly made before
the law went into effect. Eleven customs
districts and twenty-three postoffices were
thus brought under the immediate operation
of the statute. The annual report of the
civil service commission, which will soon
be submitted to congress, will doubtless
afford the means of a more definite judg
ment than I am now prepared to express.
As to the merits of the new system, I am
persuaued that- its effects have thus far
proven beneficial. Its practical methodsap
pear to be adequate for tbe ends proposed,
and there have been notorious difficulties in
carrying them into effect. Since the
16th of
July last no person so far as I am aware
has been appointed to the public service in
the classified portion thereof at any of the
departments or any of the postoffices and
customs districts above named,
except those
certified by the commission to be most com
petent on the basis of the examination held
in conformity to the rules.
stead oT-in part by fees, as is now the case.
The change would prove to be a means of
economy and would discourage the institu
tion of needless and oppressive legal pro
ceedings which is to be feared haveln some
instances been conducted for the mere sake
of personal gain. :~L:. i..
PRESIDENTIAL SUOCERSIOHb
NECESSITY FOB PBOPBB LEGISLATION.
At the time when the present executive
entered upon his office his death, removal,
resignation, or inability to discharge hi*
duties, would have left the government
without a constitutional head. It la proba
ble, of course, that a similar oontlngeney
may again arise, unless the wisdom of eon*
cress shall provide against its recurrence.
The senate at tte last session, after foll
consideration, pasaedan aet nbrtlng to ttdg

itself to the approval of both houses of con
gress. The clause of the constitution upon
which must depend any law regulatln? the
presidential succession presents also for so
lution other questions of parmount import
ance. These questions relate to the
proper interpretation of the phrase
"inability to discharge the powers
and duties of said office." Onr or
ganized law, providing that when the presi
dent shall suffer from such inability, the
presidential office shall devolve upon the
vice-president, who was himself under like
circumstances to give place to such officer
as congress may by law appoint to act as
president. I have not set forth the numer
ous and interesting inquiries which are
suggested by these words of the constitu
tion. They were fully stated in my first
communication to congress and have been
the subject of frequent deliberations by that
body. It is greatly to be hoped that these
momentous questions will find a speedy so
lution, lest the emergencj may arise
when long delay wlU be impossible, and
any determination, albeit the wisest, may
furnish cause for anxiety and alarm,
CONCLUSION.
NEEDED AMENDMENT OF THE VETO
POWER.
For the reason fully stated in my last an
nual message, I repeat my recommendation
that congress prepare an amendment to
that provision of the constitution which
prescribes the formalities for the enact
ment of laws whereby in respect to bills
tor the appropriation of public money the
executive be enabled, while giving his ap
proval to particular items, to interpose his
veto to such others as do not commend
themselves to his judgment.
THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT
of the constitution confers the right of citi
zenship upon all persons born or natural
ized in the United States and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof. It was the special
purpose of this amendment to insure to
members of the colored race the full enjoy
ment of clyil and political rights. Certain
statutory provisions intended to secure the
enforcement of these rights have been re
cently declared unconstitutional by the su
preme court. Any legislation whereby con
gress may lawfully supplement the guaran
tees which the constitution affords for the
equal enjoyment by all the citizens of the
United States of every right, privilege and
immunity of citizenship, will receive my
unhesitating approval.

FEDERAL COUBT SALARIES.
The attorney-general criticises in his

courts. The provisions are chiefly con
tained in the
act of February S6,1853, though
some of them were introduced into that
action from statutes which had been passed
many years previous. It is manifest that
such compensations as might when these
laws were enacted have been just and rea
sonable, would in many Instances be justly
regarded at the present day inadequate. I
concur with the attorney-general in the be
lief that the statutes should be revised by
which these fees are regulated. So too
should the laws which regulate the compen
sation of district attorneys and marshals.

HOUSE.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.— Mr. Converse
said he had been requested by Mr. Manning
to ask unanimous consent in the question
of his prima facie right to a seat, to be re
ferred to the committee on elections, with
instructions to report at the earliest day
possible.
Keifer asked that the case of Chalmers
be also referred, and Coverse put a request
in the resolution referring to the committee
on elections all papers In tbe case, with in
structions to report immediately whether
on the prima facie case presented either
Manning or Chalmers is entitled to be
sworn as a member, comparing tbe contest
on its merits, and not to effect the final
right to a seat.
The resolution was adopted.
The delegates from the territories ap
peared at the bar of the house and were
sworn in.
Mr. Springer offered a resolution that the
committee on elections, when appointed,
send a memorial to tbe governor of Kansas
and others, presented yesterday, and the
papers presented to the clerk ot the house,
In regard to tbe election qualifications of
Peters, of Kansas, with instructions
to report
whether Peters was eligible. If not,
whether the contestant, Wood, was en
titled to a seat. Adopted.
A resolution was adopted providing that
tbe rules of the forty-seventh congress be
the rules of the forty-eighth until two
weeks from the appointment of tbe com
mittee on rules.
Tho democratic caucus nominnees for
minor officers were elected this morning.
A committee consisting of Messrs. Cur
tin, Blackburn and Hiscock, was appointed
to wait on tbe president and inform him
that the house baa organized and was ready
to receive communications and transact
business. The drawing ot seats was then
proceeded with.
Recess until 3 o'clock.
Upon the completion of the drawing Mr.
Dunn offered a resolution for the appoint
ment of a committee' of fifteen members,
to be known as the committee on rivers
and harbors, to which shall be referred the
the proposition for the improvement of
rivers and harbors. Referred to the com
mittee on rules, when appointed.
The speaker appointed as the committee
on mileage Messrs. Moulton, Weltbarr
Glasscock, Rauny and Miller, of Pennsyl
vania.
Mr. Tucker offered a resolution referring
tothe committee on elections, when ap
pointed, the certificates and all papers re
lating to the election of representative in
the First district of Virginia, with instruc
tions to report as early as practicable which
of the rival claimants (Mayo and Garrison)
to the seat has tbe prima facie right, re
serving to the other party the privilege of
contesting the case on its merits.
At this point the committee to wait upon
the president announced that the president
would communicate to the bouse his mes
sage in writing. The president's secretary,
at 3:05, appeared and presented the presi
dent's message.
Consideration of Mr. Tucker's resolution
was then entered upon. Mr. Calkins con
tended that the prima facie right was. al
ready settled by the swearing in of Mayo.
The previous question was seconded.
Keifer spoke in opposition to the resolu
tion, contending that should it be adopted
and Garrison allowed prima facie right to
the seat, Mayo would be deprived oL all
power of contest. This was the plan by
which a man already sworn In coula be un
seated on a prima facie case and forever de
prived of the right of contest. The house
should hesitate before It undertook to put
nj gentleman In that position.
S. Wise asked bis
colleague whether
there was any question who has the prima
facie title.
Tucker answered: Yes.
Springer said he understood that Garrison
made tbe contest on a prima facie right as
well as the right on its merits. Now that
the bouse was organized it was tbe judge of
everything that pertained to the right of a
member. Would the house allow a return
ing board to usurp the authority of tbe
house and disfranchise whole committees
In granting prima facie certificates? If
there ever had beeu an arbitrary exercise
of ruasl judicial power bv a returning board
It was in this case.
J. S. Wife said the only case from Vir
ginia in which* the question of returning
boards was raised Was the case of Piatt
alnst Goode. when Piatt was elected, but
"e was given the seat by a democratic
bouse. It came with bad grace from the
other side to make the statement of the
frauds of returning boards becoming too
common in Virginia.
Mayo stated that the certificate which al
lowed him to be sworn in was,identical with
tbat presented by his colleague (Tucker.)
He asked In common justice that tbe house
deal with his case fairly, for he would be
sorry to have to say tbat he belonged to a
body of men who so far forgot what right is
to decide upon the case in advance merely
because he belonged to tbe minority.
Calkins appealed to the gentleman from
Virginia (Tucker) not to establish a prece
dent that would endanger every man in his
seat. After the clerk of the bouse bad put
a man on the roll and he was sworn in the
prima facie right was res adjudicata.
On suggestion of Randall the matter went
over until to-morrow and the reading clerk
read the president's message.| Ordered
printed and referred to committee of the
whole.
Adjourned.
THE BEASTLY ART.
A Brutal and Bloody Price Fight In
Pennsylvania
PITTSBURG, Dec. 4.—Ross' grove, on the
West Pennsylvania railroad line, nine miles
from Alleghany City, was the scene this
afternoon of one of the most brutal and
hotly-contested prize fights that ever took
place in western Pennsylvania. The prin
cipals were Patrick Moran and James Mc
Coy, and 114 rounds were fought in 1 hour
and 36 minutes. The fight has been on the
tapis several months and was for a purse of
$300. Both men were pugilists of some
repute, McCoy having fought several battles
In this vicinity, while Moran has partici
pated in a number of fights in this country
and England. McCoy is 27 years old and
Moran 51. Owing to the great difference in
their ages it was thought the former would
have an easy victory and betting was two to
one in favor of McCoy. The encounter
was to have taken place Thanksgiving day,
but was {postponed for some reason, and
generally believed to be off. This afternoon
ttO sporting men left the city and arrived at
Ross' grove at 3 o'clock. A ring was marked
out, but nojropes put up. and at 3:43 time
was callad. From the beginning McCoy broke
bis right wrist, and for tbe rest of the bat
tle fought with his left hand. Both men ap
peared determined to win and were soon
covered with blood. After McCoy broke
his wrist he fought desperately, and suc
ceeded In knocking down his antagonist 110
times. In the lllth round Moran got in a
terrific blow on McCoy's neck, felling him
like an ox. He was picked «p and carried
to his corner, but was completely dazed and
wanted to stop fighting, but his friends pre
vailed on him to continue and he fought
three more rounds, Moran knocking
