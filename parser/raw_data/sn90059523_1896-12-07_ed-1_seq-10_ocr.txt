BROTHER'S > IMS AGAINST
CAMi'AiP:," LIES.
SUPREME COUriT NOT PACKED
IX THE TIME OF GRAXT TO SE
CURE A REVERSAL OF THE
HEPDURX CASE.
SETS FORTH THE PROOF.
Letters From tlie Surviving Mem
bers of Gen. Grant's
t'nbinct.
WORCESTER, Mass., Dec. 6.—Sen
ator George F. Hoar has written a long
It tter defending his brother, the late
E. R. Hoar, attorney general in the
Crant cabinet, from an attack made
during the recent presidential cam
paign. Mr. Hoar says in explanation
of the letter:
"About a fortnight before the elec
tion, when on my way to a dinner of
the Norfolk club, I read in a morning
paner that Mr. Fairchild, formerly
secretary of the treasury, had repeated
in a speech before the Reform club
the statement, often contradicted, that
the supreme court of the United States
had been packed to reverse the decis
ion in Hepburn vs. Griswold, in which
the court held the legal tender act as
unconstitutional. At the dinner, a
few hours later, I criticised this state
ment as being as vile as was ever ut
tt-ied upon the stump. I do not sup
pose that Mr. Fairchild was aware of
the falsehood of the charge that he
indorses. He only made the too com
mon mistake of adopting, without in-
Vittigation, an error which had become
current in regard to the facts of po
litical history."
After entering into details concern
ing the matter and quoting liberally
f ; i m the records, Senator Hoar makes
public two letters just received from
two of the members of the cabinet of
Piesident Grant Says Senator Hoar
in this connection:
"I have received this letter from
Gov. Cox. He was then secretary of
the interior in Grant's cabinet. He
dwelt in the same house with At
torney General Hear during the sum
mer until the meeting of congress on
the first of December, 1869, and was
the judge's intimate personal friend.
He would have known of this matter
if it had been known, both as a mem
ber of the cabinet and from his famil
iarity with Judge Hoar. This is the
letter:
Cincinnati, 0., Nov. 6, 1896.— My Dear Sena
tor Hoar: In reply to yours of the 3d Snst. ,
I would say that I have always regarded the
charge that the supreme court was packed to
reverse the legal tender decision in Hepburn
vf. Griswold, as one of the most curious in
stances of declaring an unwarranted conclu
sion from a mere coincidence. When I orig
inally heard the assertions made, I carefully
reflected, to tee whether I could recall any
fart that sustained it. I could not. Every in
cident pertaining to the appointment of
Judges to fill the vacancies was, so far as
my recollection could reach, exactly what high
minded men would wish, exactly what all
wi'o knew Judge Hoar would expect from an
attorney general having his high ideals of
public duty.
I can recall some discussion of the char
ic:er and qualities of Judges Strong and Brad
ley among members of the cabinet, but not
t single word of reference to their opinions
on the legal tender question or to any case
pending, or iikely to be pending in the
Supreme court. Nothing could be plainer than
that the attorney general was earnestly de
termined to recommend only such men as
combined the qualities of "able ' lawyers with
those of perfectly pure, single-minded and
upright citizen?.. When the nominations were
made we felt that just such men had been
•elected.
I am the more sure that I should have i
been Quick to notice anything inconsistent j
with the good .purpose I have described, be
cause, as a matter of fact, my personal con- j
victions then were and still are, that the j
opinion of Chief Justice Chase in Hepburn vs. j
Giiswold as well as in the subsequent legal :
tender cases, so called, was the better one in i
law and a sounder one in statesmanship as j
well as a solid barrier against all forms of
fictitious or "flat" money.
One of your brother's strongest claims to
public reverence as a departed worthy, in !
my judgment, was his unchanging adherence j
to the highest possible rule of action in j
selecting the judicial nominations as i
attorney general and this was the most notice
able, as it should be, when the positions H I
be filled were the highest. Faithfully yours,
— J. D. Cox.
"Gov. Cox resigned his position in
the cabinet not long after this transac
tion, stating in a public letter his rea
sons for resigning, that he had not
bten duly supported by the president
in his attempt to protect the rights of
the United States against fraud. It
is absolutely incredible and I do not
believe any man in the country will
suggest that Gov. Cox would have i
forgotten such a transaction, or that I
he would have screened it from public j
eendemnation.
"I also have a letter from Gov. Bou- j
telle, formerly secretary of the treae
uiy. I believe he and Gov. Cox are the
only surviving members of that cabi- j
net:
Grafton, Nov. 6, IS9G— Dear Sir: My answer
to your letter of the 3d of this month must
be by negative statements rather than by
affirmative assertions. The charge to which
you call my attention is this:
That in the year 1870 the supreme court was
packed by President Grant for the purpose
of reversing the legal tender decision in the
case of Hepburn vs. Griswold. and that
•when the names of Messrs. Strong and Brad
ley were sent to the senate on Feb. 7, 1870,
the nature of the decision In the above
named case, although it had not been an
nounced from the bench, was known to the
president and the cabinet.
1 was a member of Gen. Grant's cabinet at
the time mentioned, and I wa<? present at
one or more cabinet meetings when the sub
ject was considered, and when opinions were
expressed as to the fitness of Messrs. Strong
and Bradley for the vacant places upon the
bench of the supreme court.
The legal tender controversy was not spoken
of. nor in any manner referred to by the
? resident or by any member of the cabinet,
ndeed, the conver?ation was limited. Strong
and Bradley were then without controversy
at the head of the profession in the states
of Pennsylvania, New Jersey. Maryland and
Delaware. At that time there was a justice
on the bench feom Xew England, one from
New York and one from the Pacific coast, and
four from the central states to the West.
At that time the South was not considered.
Since the controversy was opened the state
ment has been made that Judge Strong had
recognized the constitutionality of the legal
terdpr law In his place as judge of the su
preme court of Pennsylvania. I cannot say
■whether that fact was known to the presi
dent or to any member of the cabinet, but
there was no reference to the opinion of
either Strong or Bradley. Truly.
—George S. Boutelle.
MADRID IS ANXIOUS
Aft to the PoNKiblc Effect of the
President's Message.
NEW YORK. Dec. 5.— A dispatch from
Madrid sajs: Intense anxiety is felt by all
classes concerning what President Cleveland
may say in his message about Cuba and sub
sequent action by the American congress.
In official circles this anxiety, though sup
prc-ssed, is even keener than It is in un
ofFrial quarters. Most of the Spanish con
servatives perceive that many people in
Spain are inclined to believe that if Presidpnt
Cleveland's language is sufficiently concilia
te] y to pave the way for an understanding
between Spain and the United States for an
nc".orable settlement, implying no infringe
ment of Spanish sovereignty in Cuba, such
an impression probably will be made on the
puHtc mind and on the court Itself a? may
Indue* Cucen Christina to change the present
war ai d repressive policy in Cuba for a more
liberal cnc. The government will allow no
demonstration when the news of the attitude
assumed by Axifrica arrives. The authorities
■are instructed to act ene r getically.
KKW IHANTOiiVII.LE LINE.
It "Will lie Placed In Operation Tues
day.
Gen. Supt. Shied?, of the Great West
ern road. Saturday issued a circular
announcing that service on the new ex
tension from PJden to Mantorville will
be commenced xi noon Tuesday, at
which time regular freight and pas
senger business will be Btarted. F. S.
Coleman has been appointed agent of
the road at Mantorville. The opening
of the extension is somewhat impor
tant to the people of the Twin Cities, as
the milk train will hereafter leave from
Mantorville instead of Eden.
CANADIAN EXCURSIONS.
Rates and Dates Agreed Upon by the
Western Roads.
CHICAGO, Dec. s.— The managers of
the lines of the Joint Traffic associa
tion have approved the recommenda
tion of the Central Passenger commit
tee, regarding rates for the inaugura
tion of McKinley as president of the
United States. The rate will be one
fare for the round trip. Tickets will
be sold on the first four days of March,
and the final return limit will be at
any time between March 5 and 18.
The Chicago-St. Paul lines have
agreed upon the rates and arrange
ments for the excursions from points
in the Northwest to points in Eastern
Canada, which have made so much
trouble of late. The dates of sale will
be from Dec. 5 to 31, Inclusive, and
there will be a blanket rate of $40.
Tickets will have a final return limit
of three months from the date of sale,
and extensions may be arranged for
by the payment of $15 for every fifteen
days extension is desired. No stop
overs will be allowed in either direc
tion east of St. Paul or between Chi
cago and St. Paul, but they will be
allowed in the transit limits east of
Port Huron and Detroit.
The roads of the Western Passenger
association have followed the example
of the lines of the Central Passenger
committee in granting holiday rates
for students returning to their homes
for the holidays. Tickets at the re
duced rates will be granted to students
bearing certificates from the presi
dents of the colleges at which they
have been in attendance.
XEW GILF LINE
Desired Kansas City Connection
Finally to Be Made.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 5.— A
through freight line from Chicago by
way 0f Kansas City to the gulf, which
project has long been in consideration
by certain railway capitalists, has
again been revived. Theodore Bates,
of Massachusetts, manager of the re
organifeed company, who owns the un
finished Winner bridge with its valua
ble terminal properties, has been in the
city for several days holding confer
ences with railway men and inspect
ing the property in question. To com
plete the projected route it would be
necessary, it is said, to build but six
teen miles of road between Dearborn,
Mo., to Smithville, giving a direct
route to Kansas City, and the finishing
of the Winner bridge and its local ter
minus. The Pittsburg & Gulf railroad
will have been finished to the gulf by
February next. Mr. Bates says his
clients have plenty of money and plen
ty of confidence, but care to say noth
ing of their plans at present. Com
menting upon the situation, the Star
this evening says:
"Nevertheless the cherished scheme
is coming to a focus. Men in Chicago,
who are allied with Mr. Bates, have
seen the possibilities with covetous
eyes."
NOT PART OF THE U.
Receiver Mink Says the Oregon
Short Line Will Be Independent.
OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 6.— Oliver W. j
Mink, receiver and comptroller of the j
Union Pacific railroad, left for New |
York this morning. He goes on im- j
portant business pertaining to the fore- i
closure of the Oregon Short Line. Mr.
Mink said, in an interview prior to his !
I departure:
"My judgment is that the owners of
j the Short Line property, as reorgan-
I ized/ will operate it as an independent
property, though probably not in ho - I
tility to the interests of the Union
Pacific. It will not materially affect
the existing tariff relations. It will I
| undoubtedly injuriously affect the
j Union Pacific if the Ogden & Denver !
gate is opened to all roads. This j
| would let in all competing lines and j
| the bad effects would be inevitable.
j So far as the Union Pacific lines mak- i
j ing up the Union Pacific proper are
i concerned, the security holders in a
great part will deposit their securities
with a reorganization committee. |
I which will attempt to advance its plan i
j independent of the plans made or sug
j gested for the reorganization of any
j of the branch line property."
! LOOKIXG OVER THE BIG FOUR.
W. K. Vanderljilt Inspects the Prop

CINCINNATI. 0., Dec. 6.— William
K. Vanderbilt, H. McK. Twombley,
President M. E. Ingalls, Vice President
Layng, and Gen. Manager Schaff.of the
! Big Four, members of the Vanderbilt
party who have been over the Big
Four railroad from Cleveland to St.
i Louis, were here today. The depots
I and terminals of the Big Four and
j Chesapeake & Ohio were inspected, and
i Mr. Vanderbilt. Mr. Layng and Mr.
; Twombley returned tonig - ht to New
York. The trip has no further signifi
cance than that Mr. Vanderbilt, who
: will suoceed his brother as head of the
j Vanderbilt system of railroads (at least
! until Cornelius Vanderbilt fully recov
ers) desires to become familiar with
the improvements that have been
made, and those that are needed, on
the Big Four system.
PARALLELING THE C, H. & D.
Brlce's Latest Move In a Railway
Scheme,
LIMA, 0., Dec. 6. — Articles of incor
poration for the Dayton Northern Rail
i way company, with general offices to
be located here, were filed yesterday.
The capital stock is $10,000 and the in
| corporators are James B. Townsend,
j W. B. Ritchie, C. N. Haskell, Edward
j R. Thomas. W. C. Brown and J. R.
Megrue. The same power which built
j the Lima Northern is behind the new
j move, and it means that if the Ohio
i Southern gets into other hands the
j Lima Northern will be built to Cin
cinnati, and the Lake Erie & Western
will use the road. to Franklin, join the
Northern Ohio and Lima Northern at
Mackinaw, and will enter Cincinnati
together.
The line is a Brice move, and when
executed the paralleling of the power
ful Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton will
be effected.
CA'VT COMPEL REDUCTION.
Kansas Commissioners Act on the
Grain Rnte Case.
TOPEKA, Kan., Dec. 6.— The Kansas
state board of railway commissioners
has handed down a decision in the
grain rate case filed by the Kansas
City, Kan., board of trade and 11,156
citizens of Kansas against the rail
roads of Kansas, holding that it had
no power to promulgate an enforcible
order under the law under which the
case was brought and dismissed. The
case was filed in June for the purpose
of compelling the railroads to reduce
the freight rates on grain from points
in Kansas to Kansas City. Peti
tions were secured in each county in
the state asMng the board to enforce
the maximum rate order made by the
Populist board in 1894, which has nev
er been enforced since its promulga
tion.
CALLS OFF HIS RECEIVER.
County Judge Gives lp His Fight
on the Santa Fe Road.
TOPEKA, Kan., Dec. 6.— Judge Louis
Myers, of the Jefferson county court,
who under the alien land law re
cently appointed a receiver for the
Atchison, Topeka & sunta Fe railroad
property in Kansas, has, it is said here
tonight, agreed to discharge the re
ceiver, and the case, which has been
the theme of so much discussion will,
it Is further believed, now be dropped
for good and all.

TftlO Ifl A TRUST
GIGANTIC DEAL WHICH IS TO GIVE
ST. LOUIS LIGHT, HEAT AAD
TALK,
MILLIONS IN THE COMBINE.
THREE COMPANIES WHICH EX
PECT TO REVOLUTIONIZE
ELECTRIC AFFAIRS.
RATES GO DOWN AT THE START.
Complete System of Conduits to Be
One of the Features In the
New Deal.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 6.— A gigantic
deal. Involving a revolution in the tele
phone and electric lighting business of
St. Louis, has been consummated.
Three big companies, with an aggre
gate paid-up stock of nearly three mill
ion dollars, have been organized by
about twenty of the most prominent
and wealthy citizens of St. Louis. One
of the companies will introduce a new
telephone system in St. Louis at much
lower service rates than those prevail
ing at present. It will establish a
home telephone plant which will in
time extend to neighboring points. The
second company, owned by the same
persons, will operate an immense elec
tric plant, supplying power of all kinds
for public and private use. The third
company will construct the telephone
and electric plants for the two other
companies, manufacture the equipments
and will construct a complete system
of underground conduits. A fourth
company is also in the deal, but it
will not figure in the proceedings at
present.
The local capitalists interested in the
new companies are: Ellis Wain
wright, Adolphus Busch, August Geh
ner, Samuel M. Kennard, Julius S.
Walsh. Rolla Wells. Charles H. Tur
ner, William F. Nolker, William T.
Haarstick, C. Marquard Foster, Henry
Nicolus, George J. Kobusch, Philip
Stock, Lawrence B. Pierce, Breekin
ridge Jones, C. K. D. Walsh, Otto Yon
Schrader, William D. Orthwein and H.
S. Priest.
The Kinloch Telephone company is
the name of a $1,000,000 company char
tered by the secretary of state at Jef
ferson City Saturday, with a paid up
capital stock. The incorporators were
the St. Louisans just named, and Hop
kins J. Harford, of Evanston, 111., and
James H. Parish, of Brooklyn, N. Y.
The capital stock of the company, how
ever, will also be taken by the St. Louis
parties.
Articles of incorporation of the St.
Louis Electric and Construction com
pany, with a full capital of $600,000,
were filed in the recorder's office in
this city. The papers contain the same
list of incorporators.
Late yesterday afternoon the same
gentlemen held a meeting and closed a
deal which put them in possession of
the Citizens' Electric Lighting and
Power company and the Telephone and
Telegraph Service company, both of
which have had but a nominal busi
ness for many years The Citizens'
Electric Lighting and Power company
was then organized with a full paid
capital stock of $750,000 and officers
were elected.
The deal is one of the largest ever
accomplished in St. Louis and its ef
fects are far-reaching. The combina
tion was made for the avowed pur
pose of revolutionizing the telephone
and general electric business in St.
Lcuis. The local capitalists start out
with the announcement that the new
telephone company will provide tele
phones at $36 per year for residences,
$50 for physicians and $60 for business ;
houses. The present telephone rate is j
$100 per year for the Bell telephone
service. The new company will open !
general offices next week and will at
once get out and hustle after pros
pective subscribers. The local capi
talists apparently mean business, as
they filed their applications for con
duit space with the board of public im
provements late yesterday afternoon
and also filed four bonds aggregating
$140,000 with the mayor and council.

JAPS *RE CUT OUT.
Americans "Will Control the JTew
Transpacific Linen.
LOS ANGELAS, Cal., Dec. 6.— The
much discuss^a steamship line from
Japan to a Southern California port,
which Japanese capital is said to have
been toying with for some months, will
be owned by Americans. The presa
dispatches fronj Chicago stated that E.
C. Potter, soir of O. W. Potter, the
noted financier of that city, is work
ing on the establishment of such a
steamship line.
It is learned -from Secretary Willard,
of the chamber 1 of commerce, that the
news is correct and that the entire
affair is in a fair way to be successful.
Mr. Potter has been in Southern Cali
fornia for some days and is now at the
Coronado hotel. The project is backed
by himself in conjunction with the
largest holders of Santa Fe securities
and the Cramps' ship builders at Phil
adelphia. The project will not be of
ficially connected with the Santa Fe
railway, but will be in full sympathy
with that corporation. The capital
stock will be probably $10,000,000 ana
pledges for a large portion have al
ready been made.
The chamber of commerce here has
taken the matter in hand and is pusn
ing forward with zeal.
The plan is to have built the finest
passenger steamers of the day, cost
ing $1,500,000 each, to be 8,000 tons
burden, in all particulars to excel the
best of the P. and O. vessels. The
projectors figure that East India trav
elers to England will save at least
three days' time as against the Sues
route. The time on freight will also
be materially reduced and rates con
siderably reduced. The whole enter
prise is based on the lines of mag
nificence and the greatest possible
speed with the expectation of depriv
ing the Canadian Pacific of its trade
and the English P. and O. steamers ot
a good proportion of theirs. The service
is to be semi-monthly at least. The
port has not been selected, but is likely
to be San Diego, until San Pedro is
made a deep water harbor.
STILLWATER NEWS.
Elks Remember Tliose Who Have
Gone Before.
The annual lodge of sorrow of Still -
water Lodge No. 179, B. P. O. E., was
held in their hall in the McKusick
block yesterday afternoon, and the
services were very impressive. The
memorial address was delivered by
Hiler Horton, of St. Paul Lodge No.
59, and the eulogy was delivered by H.
H. Gillen, of this city. Musical selections
were rendered by a quartette com
posed of Mrs. R. S. Davis, Mrs. W. C.
Matterman, Geo. O. Haskell and Hon.
W. C. Masterman. The hall was ap
propriately decorated with flowers and
plants and a beautiful wreath laid
loosely over the marble slab on which
are carved the names of the dead mem
bers of the lodge. During the past
year two members passed into the vast
unknown, namely Edward A. O'Brien
and A. S. Meriam.
Several of the leading loggers of this
city will send a crew of men up river
today to haul in the logs that are ly
ing along the banks of the St. Croix
and some of its tributaries. About
thirty-five men will be employed and
the loggers expect to secure about
4,000,000 feet of logs.

SOME QUEER TOURISTS.
They Go Abroad ns Cattlemen and
Return as Swells.
While hosts of people look over the pas
senger lists of the lucky ones who are able
ta go abroad and envy them way down in
their hearts, there Is a class of men who
make frequent trips across the ocean which
would hardly excite envy, excepting by rea
son of their peculiar privileges, says the Chi
cago Chronicle. This class is humorously
called "cattle chambermaids," because of the
fact that those who belong to it give their
attention to the live cattle that are exported
from this country to Europe. The men who
do this are the riffraff of the world, and whon
here find it difficult to earn more than enough
to keep body and soul together. But when
they are lucky enough to get one of these
"chambermaid" jobs they feel like million
aires, for they get more money a day for the
trip than they could get on shore in a week, j
There are a number of Chicago stock yards
men who do a large business exporting cat
tle, and they always have a gang of fellows
around waiting for the first chance to go
out with a cargo. The average time of these
trips from Chicago to London is about four
teen days and the price paid the attendants
is $30 in gold. The chambermaid is at no
expense whatever. He is fed, but, oh, such
feed. It is worse than that of the animals he
looks after. There is always a gang boss and
he it is who dispenses the "grub." Ordinar
ily this is boiled fat pork and bread, with i
only water to drink. The pork comes from
the kitchen in a great pot or tub. The boss
stabs a chunk of solid fat with the long
handled fork, almost a pitchfork in fact, and
hurls it at one of the "maids" with some
choice specimens of billingsgate. It is caught
much as a dog catches a chunk of meat in
his mouth and no attention is paid to the
liquid grease which flies in every direction.
The fat pork is followed by a hunk of stale
bread and a drink of water finishes the re- #
rast.
But what care these fellows for the fare
and the labor going over. They know there
will be joy and pleasure when their destina
tion is reached. Once landed in Liverpool or
Southampton they are given their $30 in
English gold, this so they will spend it in
England, auti a return ticket good for ninety
days from date.
Then at once begins a season of riotous
living. The first thing is a flashy suit of
clothes and a walking stick and then off for
London. The old hands know better than to
'•blow in" their money on expensive oating.
They have become familiar with the "coffee
palaces" to be found all over London, where
they get an imperial quart of coffee for one
penny and a "bun," eo.ual in size to an
average loaf of bread, and thus for two pen
nies they buy all they can possibly eat. On
certain days, when they feel like luxuriating,
they may perhaps spend threepence on some
I dainty, like a dozen shrimp, but even with
I that extravagance. Indulged in every two or
| three days, the $30 will last a long time and
give plenty of opportunity to soak themselves
with " 'alf and 'alf."
These chaps always stay until the money
is about goiie and then back they come to
Chicago, where the glory of their London
clothes soon beeow«s dimmed as they loaf
around the cattle pens at the stock yards
while waiting for another chance to act as
chambermaids to a drove of cattle.
A Dream Dfapelled.
The two sweet things were standing on a
corner waiting for a car when they saw a
boy coming up the avenue leading a four
footed object that was blanketed and swathed
out of sight. A small crowd was following
the blanketed object.
"It's one of those perfectly lovely race
horses. Just see how gracefully it walks,
Maudie, dear. Isn't tt a dream?"
"Oh! Lily, dontt you think we might just
see its dear nose*' Why. it must be a perfect
| poem or they wouldn't" be so careful of it. I
i have a lump of svgar — there was more than
I I wanted with the chocolate. I am going to
! ask if I mayn't give it to the dear thing."
"Yes. dear, do. I'll stop the procession.

But the poem aftd dream began a series of

he could do to keep his feet, and he was
pulled across the avenue and back again sev
i oral times before he could respond to the two
I sweet things who were trying to converse

"Been to the races with it?" they asked in
concert.
"Xaw: ain't any races."
"Oh. then you are just exercising the lovely

"Naw. miss; it*s 'tother way. The lovely

ENGLISH MUSEtM PESTS.
Amatenr Collectors Who Demand
Unreasonable Prices for Treas
ures.
The amateur collector of curiosities gener
ally has an exaggerated idea of the value of
his treasures. No sooner* does he get hold of
something which he considers unique and in
teresting than he fancies that every museum
in the country will jump at the chance of pur
chasing it from him. With this idea he is
continually calling upon museum keepers and !
trying to persuade them into exhibiting his
so-called rarities, says London Tid Bits.
The curator of a popular Northern museum
has been much worried in this way during the
last year or so. Only the other week a white
haired old man came to him and showed him
a dagger which was said to be the weapon
used by King John in stabbing the boy Prince
Arthur. The dagger was quite a modern affair
and showed no signs of age, but the old man
stuck to his description strenuously.
"My dear fellow," he said to the curator,
in patronizing tones, "if you are so blind to
your own interests as to refuse this dagger,
It is no concern of mine. It has been in our
family for centuries, and we are descended in j
a direct line from Hubert de Bourg, the
nobleman who refused to allow Prince Ar
thur's eyes to be burnt out with red-hot
Irons. I'll give you one more chance, and if
you won't have it, I'll take it elsewhere."
Needless to say, he had to take it elsewhere.
Another crank drove up to the museum
gate one afternoon on a dray, to which was
strapped a big, cumbersome writing table.
The curator hastened out to meet him and
was just in time to prevent him bringing the
piece of furniture bodily into the hall.
On being asked for an explanation, the vis
itor said he had decided to present the mu
seum with a priceless treasure in the shape of
a writing table used by Sir Francis Bacon.
He had been preserving it for a long time,
he said, in order that he might write its his
tory, which he had at last completed in a
manuscript volume of 320 sheets. The cu
rator, who is, of course, an expert, examined
the desk and declared it to be worthless. It
had apparently been used in a school room
until it had got too rickety for service, and
then dispensed with. At any rate it couldn't
have been more than seventy years old. This
report wa~ communicated to the visitor, who
thereupon took to raving like a madman,
and became so violent that he and his treas
ure had to be moved along by the police.
Royal relics are much in favor with ama
teur collectors, and, though some of the curi
osities submitted to the museum recently
have been tlrought worthy of a place on the
tables, the majority have proved to be hope
less rubbish. One lady, who is well known
for her eccentricities, turned up last July,
carrying a luxurious plush case, in which
reposed a very diminutive feeding bottle.
She told the curator that she wanted £50 for
it. and that It ought to be worth more, seeing
that it had been used in the weaning of her
majesty. Queen Victoria. This magnanimous
offer was gently but firmly declined with
thanks.
Some amateurs do not hesitate to stoop to
fraud in order to gain an entrance to the
museum, and the curator admits having been
tricked on more than one occasion by clever
bits of faking. One man. drea?ed as a par
son, brought a vegetable oddity in the shape
of a carrot which bore a splendid resemblance
to a mermaid. Head, body and tail were all
complete, even to the fins, and after a care
ful examination the curiosity was given a
•prominent place on the principal table. It
afterward transpired that the whole thing had
been cleverly cut out of an unusually large
carrot, and that the parson was a curio
hunting crank in disguise. He had labored
three months oveT the mimic oddity, and
was delighted with his success in hooSwink
ing the curator.
PEARLS AM.E NOW THE FAD.
Fnsliion Dcmanili They Be Worn,
Be They Few or Many.
Pearls are the fad of the hour. Every
debutante of any social account has one or
two strings, costing $1,000 or $2,000, but the
society matrons indulge in great ropes of
them, to which they are continually adding,
says the San Francisco Chronicle. Mra.
Potter Palmer, who spent last season in New
port, is said to own pearls which a princess
might envy. Mrs. Fred Vanderbilt's pearls
are also markedly beautiful. Corsage orna
ments are graceful novelties. Two separate
bow knots, for instance, studded with pearls
and diamonds, are linked together wth rope*
of pearls.
Jewels this season are worn most lavishly.
At any large Newport function it seems to
be only a question who shall manage to put
on the most diamonds and the biggest. Cor
sage fronts are so covered that the material
does »ot matter. Add to this the fact that
nearly every married woman wears a tiara,
and the effect is Just a little dazzling. These
tiaras are built so that they can be taken
apart and worn as pins and other ornaments.
The most brilliant tiara possible has a suc
cession of spiky rays set up on a band which
twinkle and flash with every step.
Another beautiful tiara ha* a graceful scroll
surmounted by tall, delicate sprays of dia
monds of various sizes, symmetrically ar
ranged on almost invisible platinum wires.
Bracelets are to claim more attention this
winter than for some seasons. They are of
Oriental splendor, and are to be worn with
Cleopatra-like enjoyment of display. Large
diamonds, joined by chains or small diamonds
and alternating with others set with rubies,
are regal fancies. For the debutante there
is a design less bold and rather more dainty,
slender chain* being secured with pear
shaped pearl clasps, fringed with pearl pend
ants.
The most bizarre ornament is the ring
reaching from knuckle to knuckle, called the
"banquet ring." It looks ridiculous and
savors of barbarism. If a woman has bo
many atones she is not satisfied until all are
in evidence, let her find some more pleasing
way of using them than to spread over her
hands. Increase the size of the garter buckle
and diminish th&t of the ring. The more
beautiful the hand the more important it is
to wear on the lingers only a few choice
stones, set as simply as possible. Diamond
lncrusted scroll work is to hold an important
place in the winter jewelry.
