THE 81TUAT10K.
We have from rebel newspapers of tbe 6th lost, what
sre apparently pretty reliable accounts of General Sher
man's position sad movements on Mocday last. It Is
? id ibat bis columns bad then united, and that bis wbo'.s
army was southwest of Mlllcn, and marching steadily
towards tbe coast, which It was thought bs designed
reaching at or In tbe vicinity of Savannah. A battle
north west of Sivannab, before tbe close of this
week, betwesn bis fores snd Its ppposers, was
anticipated by the rebels. Another fight between
Ktlpatrlck and Wbeeler, which to said to hare
occurred on Sunday last, to reported. Of course
?he Yankees "were repulsed'' snd "lost besvily," and it
was romored that General Ktlpatrlck was wounded. Tbe
rebels sstiaaate General Sherman's entire force at thirty
thousand Infantry and five thousand cavalry, snd say that
bis soldiers expressed astonishment at tbe richness of
the country through wh'ch they were passing and tb?
abundance of provisions-* contained.
By tbe arrival here yesterday of the government
steam transport TraHe Wind, from Hilton Bead, 8. C, on
tbe tth last., we sre f urn is bed by our correspondents
with fall asd Interesting details of tbe battle st Honey

Charleston sad Savannah Railroad, on tbe 30th ulU,
betweeu sons or Geaerai Foster's troops snd
a rebel force wider General Gustavus Psaltb.
We Mare already given some rebel newspaper
aoooosts of this euKsymost. Our own des
-jUobes show it to hsve been s stubboarly contested
).'air. Tbe Unioa force left Bilton Head, early en tbe
}ornlng of tbe 29th ulL, on transports, and proeeeded up
)roa4 river to Boyd's Point, where they were landod.
> naval force accompaslod tbem, and both Admiral Dabl
gren asd General Foster were with the expedition. After
landtag tbe troops were pushed out for several
miles la various directions, driving tbs enemy
before tbem at every p^nt. The day was thus con
sumed In recocneitrlrg and ikirmbhing. Early on
tbe asornisg of tte30ih tbiy were sttackcd by a body of
rebels wbo moved out from tLuir earthworks at iloney
HHi. These were Immediately driven in, at:d deter,
mined and severe fighting commenced between our men
on tbe open ground snd the enemy In bis Intrcnchments,
and lafted for several hours. Three gallant charges
were mads en tbe rebel works by the Union
soldiers; but, finding tbem tno strong to be
easily taken, seed not of suTicent lmportsoce
to compensate for the losses which their capture would
Involve, General Foster witiirfw bis oommand to a
Btro g ar,d important position on tbe Savannah real,
where bis troops retaaioed during that ni>-ht and the
following day. No accounts o! bis later movements have
reacted oa. We accompany our descriptive despatches
with a map snowing tbe local ty of the battle.
Tbe exchange of prlsounrs in Savannah rtvor baa
ceased, either Geueral Sherman s or General Foster's
operations having rendered the rebels ucable or IndiS
posed to continue tbe delivery of our jn-n at tbst point.
A Nashville nswspapor of \ dnesJay p>ubiUlted s re

felting his command across to tbe north side of the Cam

Daf
la regard to the practical and paramoaat
business of the war the President'* Message is
?erj flat and unsatisfactory. It is not surpris
ing that the gold gamblers of Wall street have
turned it to their advantage for there is no
thing in the measure promising a rigorous
prosecution of the work of demolishing the
rebel armies.
Mr. Lincoln calla for more taxes, more loans,
more "greenbacks," more additions of many
millions to the national debt; hut he says
nothing of the urgent necessity for more sol
diers, in order to extinguish the rebellion at
oice. lie apparently loses sight of tho im
portant fact that it is the war which is embar
rassing the Treasury and depreciating tho na
tional currency, and expanding our national
debt at the rate fcof five, six, seven or
eight hundred millions a year, lie seems to
forget that it is imperatively necessary to
finish the war in order to save the Treasury,
tbe national credit, the national currency, and
the public confidence in the national secu
rities. He seernB to have adopted the falla
cious idea that the poople have given him tbe
a nple margin of four yours more for the war,
when, in reality, his re-election is due to tho
popu'ar idei that it would onoourago bin
to more energy and activity la pushing
the rebels to a surrender. After f?ur y ars' ex
perience at tbe head of our national affairs,
through all the trials of this terrible struggle
from the beginning, and in view of tbo con
trolling issue of the lata national election and
the result, we naturally expected that Mr. Lin
coln, in his annual message, would rise, or at
least a'tcmpt to rise, to tho exigencies of t'.;e
day, the grandeur of his position and the dig
nity of the occasion.
lie bas disappointed u*. Ilis re-election
and the ringing voice of the people for an over
whelming pressure upon fie rebellion stir up
no enthusiasm in bis quiet, easy nature. With
tbe power and tbe authority placed in bis
hands by Congress and tlie people to extinguish
the D .vis conrederacy within six months, or
even three months; with the power ?,nd dis
cretion given him to control events, b > Is still
content to be controlled by them and to flo.it
along as the winds and waves nay drive hUn.
Oh, that fer a month, a week, or a day, he oould
give us a touch or tho earnostness, ve olution
and energy of Old Hickory. Why Is it that
the message embodies no demand, do recom
mendation, no request for more soldiers? Can
It be that Mr. Lincoln proposes to take it
quietly and patiently, to worry the rebels till
eihausl ;d with his present armies In 'a? field!
What explanation can be given of h a a.range
emission of the paramount buslne** of '!ie day?
\Te may be told that he ondorses and refers
the two houses of Congress to t'?e sug?< s',ions
and r qulsl tions embraced In the forthcoming
report of the Socrotary of War; th.xt Mr. Stan
ton will probably oall for more s?l tiers, and a
liberal appropriation for bounties, and so on.
Rut even this explanation will not sufll. e. Tbe
main business of the country should have been
the main topic of the message. A bird's eye
view of tho events and achievements of the
war during the pa t year, of tho advantages
gained, and the work remaining to be done,
and tbe men and means required to do it
speedily and effectively, Involved the proper
application to be made of the President's
statistic* of tbe Increased strength and wealth
of tbo" loyal Btatos in men, means, and ro?
?m-vs ?*4 ??? sir ry**
What atail is his exhibit of this increa!S3
strength If It Is uot to bo employed to secure
Mt early pe^e? C leer If U tfaja pattfr Mx.
L'ncoln's remissness leads to tbe conclusion
tbat wbat ha has been from tUe beginning?easy
going, good-natured, Uklag 11 quietly, and
trusting to luck?ba will bo to tbe end of tbe
chapter. His mind does not appear to belong
to that clasa which, charged with tbe weighty
responsibilities of a revolutionary crisis,
steadily expand with the proportions of pass
ing and comlog events. *
It is not ye t too late, however, for Mr. Lin
coin to supply the deficiencies of the message
on tbe war question. General Grant, with the
armies at present in tbe field under his com
mand, may perhaps be able to bring tbo rebels
to a capitulation; but we sUall not be dealing
fairly with him, the army or the country in
resting upon this lazy presumption. We have
bad too much of tbis walling to see what an ac
tive army in the field would accomplish before
proc eJiug to reinforce it. Thus we have failed
to reap the inviting fruits wbich otherwise
might bave been gathered, not only from our
past victories, but from our d Rasters. Let us
have no more of this; but let Congress and the
administration this time " make assurance
doubly sure" by strengthening our armies in
the field, so that reinforcements at all points
may be forthcoming in the niok of time.
Tbe three great rules of eloquence as laid
down by Demosthenes are "action, action, ac
tion;" and these are the instructions of the
neoole to Mr. Lincoln and all in authority in
ruierence to the suppression of the rebellion.
Everything else, tbe negro ami all, should be
made subordinate to this, tbe main question.

On Wednesday we published in full the re
port of the Secreta\y of tbe Treasury. This
document is a most important one, since it
{jive** in cxten.io a view of th? present financial
condition of the country; shows tbe people
the real state of the national purse, and as the
national purae id tbe influence that must
alter all control and sustain the national life,
Mr. Febsenden's budget is not second in cocao
qnence to any that will be laid before tbe
people. If the people have not generally read
this document they ought to do so. It is a duty
that every man owes to the country to wutcb
its condition and the condition of tbe govern
ment, in order that wLen the voice of the
petple is called for iu favor of this or tuat
measure it may be given with an intelligence
en.igbtened by a knowledge of all tho import

It is an accepted axiom in commerce that
supply is regulated by demand, and that the
two tend to balance. Generally this is not
less true in tbe more olevated regioa of na

rious Miltous" steal watermelons-every sum
mer. "Hands that the rod of empire might
have swayed" have been blistered' with birch
in every year of the world alnoe the bead of
Prisclaa was in danger. Men of tbe greatest
ability are always ready whenever the odfcasion
comes to call them out and develop their
latent faculties. This is sustained, by every
great epoch in tbe world's history. Late in
ths eighteenth century the disease and trouble
of Fraace seemed to be pigmy men, and
presto, the French Revolution developed
IU brood of giants. It bas been tbe
satae ia England and la oar own couutry.
The necessities of governments produce men
of high administrative powers, the necessities
of war great generals, aad tbe aceessities of
finance great financiers.
We in this natural arrangement have been
especially happy in tbe productioa of great
soldiers aad sailors?happier perhaps than ever
a people were before. We can point to Grant,
Sherman, Sheridan, Thomas, Farragut, Porter,
Footc, Dupent, and fearlessly challenge any
period in history to equal that array. ? But in
some other directions we are less happy. We
bel'eve that our great financier is still in ob
scurity?has not yet been seen upon tbe sur
face. Mr. Feaseuden'ts message is fair enough
as a financial statement. It show3 us what we
owe, what our expenses are, and wbat our in
come is. This is arithmetic, aud we suppose it
is corrcct. llo also makes some good recom
mendations?as that for an application of ths
income tax tp all incomes, and for other re
visions of the internal revenue. His views on
the national domain?agricultural and mineral
lands?w.ll nceiwith general approval; and so,
we suppose, will his view3 oa the currency.
Cut tlio n>al difficulty is that the country does
not just now want Mr. Fossenden's views ou
ony of these questions. It doos not w uit any
one's views. It wants a sound financial adinin
,istr?tion?a great financier, to ta^e hold of
there matters practically, aad to develop the
national wealth so that this rich couutry shall
not look like a poor one and fetl like a poor
one when it bis to pay debts that arc not rela
tively great. Mr. FassenHen hopes "that Con
gress will be able to devise sosun means by
which'' all this can Lo done; and that is to hope
that Congress will do what the country cxpects
him to do.
Ws take it that the facts of oar financial
position are tolerably clear. We aro tbe richest
peop.e in material resources fhat there ia in
the world, and we are suddenly called upon to
boar the burden of a national d< bl. Now,
judged by comparison with tbo dobta of other
nations, the debt that wo have to bear is not
large for our strength, and ought not to trouble
the steadlneis of our footsteps. Nations not so
ttrotig as wo are bear easily debts much greater
tban ours Is. We ought, therefore, i> be.ir this
debt well; but tho truth btill ia that there are
'?embarrassmonts," and that the national credit
Is not wl at, in view of tho facts, it oujht to be.
Oar national pursekeeper should fiod a remedy
for this, and he does not. lie shius tt e burden
oa to tho shoulders of Congr?3s?a collection
of politicians familiar with no sl iple fact ex
cept the prioe of a convontien. Mr. Fessenden
exhibits an entire want of that grasp of tbe
H.ubject undor his control that would give the
peoplo a firm confidence In thr national flnacccg.
He Las not any original power. lie has studied
finances all lile life, and he is satikfird to give a
debtor and creditor return of tbe national ac
count, to make some feeble recommend ?t?ons to
Congress, and leave the subject In that way.
IIo is not the man for ths pla^e. tLerefore, any
more than Mr. Chaso wa<. It is said that Mr.
Fessenden'a health is poor, that ho is not robust
enough for the arduous duties of his position,
and that he holds it again.it his inclination,
lie ought not to do so. Rolust, physical health
and ths clear and vigorous Intellect tnat goes
with it are nec??8!ties of that efice, and Mr.
Fesseodon ooght to resign. By that moaua be
would, at the least, give the tountry ose more
opportunity te get tbe services of tte right

Aa Anunun Gift to Shirmu'( Yn
raxs.?In sixteen days mora the Christmas fes
tivities will be arteind aa, and we should not
forget In the comforts of oar own homes the
gallant tray under General 8hermau, who,
after tbeir grand inarch of throe hundred
miles?such a march as was nerer made sluoe
the time of Xerxes?will be in camp on the
Atlantic ooast, somewhere near Sarannah or
Beaufort, on Christmas Day. We gave a boun
tiful Thanksgiving dinner to the army and
nary on tbo James and on the ocean. Let us
now prepare a etill more bountiful Christmas
feast for the toil-worn veterans of Sherman. It
will he an appropriate offering, and a substan
tial recognition of their services. After their
long journey through swamps and forests,
where we may suppose turkeys and plumpud
ding do not abound, how pleasant it would be
for the gallant fellows to be regaled at a fine
Christmas dinner, and to feel at the same time
that they were not forgotten at homo; that
their boats were waiting for them with well
Qlled tables aod a hearty welcome. It is a
novel way, it Is true, for a people to reward
its soldiers. No nation ? ever did It
before ?, but then wo hare done many new
things, and introduced many innovations in
tbe way of wiuning battles as well as in the
manner of rewardiug tbe victors since the war
began. - At ail events it is a very good Ame
rican way of showing our appreciation of our
soldiers in the field. Not the least thing prized
by a soldier on campaign is his rations; and
wtiat better rations are there than roast tur
keys, plumpudding and " homemade" pies?
There is plenty of time to get up a fine din
ner for tbe wbole of Sherman's army between
this and Christmas. The rebel papers estimate
his force at fifty thousand men. Let us take
this as a bane, and we will want just thirty
thousand turkeys, fifty thousand pies, and
twelve thousand large plumpuddings. This
will be an excellent bill of fare, with a few
other delicacies added, which benevolent
ladies know ho well how to suggest.
In tbe meantime we hope that tbe portion of
Sherman's army left in tbe West to look after
Hood, will be similarly feasted by the people
of that region. New Year's Day would be
an appropriate occasion. Thoy will have
finished up Hood by that time, and wilt be
in fine humor to enjoy a good dinner. Bat
no time should be lost in this city in commenc
ing preparations for the Christmas dinner for
Shermau's historic fifty thousand.
Demoralization or the Chivalrt.?Tbo war
is manifesting its demoralizing effects upon
Southern men in a marked way. In our last
accounts from Matamoros it is stated'that a
nephew of Governor Vance, of North Caro
lina, has been arretted for a highway robbery
committed near that city. He holds a commis
sion in tbe rebel army, and had been sent over
from Brownsville, with a pass from Golonol
Ford, to obtain supplies. During his leave-of
absence be thought bo wonld do a stroke of
business on bis own account, and accordingly
associated himself with a band of thieves, wfio
stopped tbe stage from Matamoros to the-mouth
of the river and pillaged the passengers. There
is every probability tbat he will swing for this
want of discrimination between guerilla prao*
tices In hostile and friendly territory. Sueb -ls
tt^o Condition of principle and feeling to which
tbe chivalry are being brought by the war.
Let it last but a couple of .years longer, an&
they will all become as dead to honorable feed
ing and shame as this Captain Vance.
A Good Tiitno for Gideon.?There Is no
mintake about the fact tbat the Secretary of the
Navy baa presented iu bis annual report a very
well written document. It is- a complete his
tory of the navy for the past year, full of in*
teresting matter, valuable statistics, and hap
pily conceived and distinctly put suggestions.
The education Gideon received as a reportor
for the newspaper press in Connecticut has not
been lost upon him. If be should make as good
* Secretary of tl:e Navy as he docs a reporten,
and avoid those blunders in the administration
of tbe affairs of liis department as intelligent
reporters of the prvra do in making up tb??ir
daily report", he would prove of more service
to tbe country. It is evident tbat, although
slumbering for most of the time, be wakes up
once a year and gets up as good a history of
tbe American navy as could be desired. This
is a good thing for Gideon.
Rf.bkt< Inoimtitt dr.?We had alwaye been

one of the representative men of tbe South.
Certainly in bhiFter and swagjjer no on? had a
fairer claim to the title. Both in Congress and
nut of Congress he rendered the cause of
c'nralry important services. Now wo are told
by the rebel journals that be Is of no account.
