Senator La Follette Argues
' Against the Pending Rail
way Measure.
"Return of the railroads by the gov
ernment to the samf Interests that
formerly controlled them was opposed
1n the Senate today by Senator La
Kollette. republican, of Wisconsin,
who said before the T'nited States en
tered the war the railroads failed to
function and had not the government
taken over control of them they
would have been in worse shape than
they are at present.
Senate Keeoaaiders Action.
Before the Wisconsin senator be
gan his discussion of the bill, which
he expects to continue tomorrow, the
Senate reconsidered its previous ac
tion taken yesterday, advancing the
bill to its final parliamentary stages
preliminary to final passage, and re
turned the measure to the committee
of the whole.
In withdrawing bis opposition to the
Senate retracing its steps. Senator
Cummins, chairman of th~ Senate in
terstate commerce committee, it was
understood, was influenced by the fact
that a number of senators have not in-,
formed him of amendments they in
tended proposing: and which they de
sired ample o|>]H>rt unit> to discuss.
Senator I.a Follette** Argument.
Senator I,a Follette said immediate
return of the roads is impracticable,
saving if such action was taken they
would be incapable of giving decent
service unless triven governmental
financial assistance.
Quoting statements accredited to
President Wilson, two years before
this country's entry into the war. that
the transportation situation was se
rious. the Wisconsin senator told the
senate thai government control over
The carriers was inevitable if they
were to continue to function. Gov
ernmental regulations under pre-war
conditions, he said, were "liberal to
the last degree.'* but despite this "the
railroad business of the country fell
?under that liberal control into a state
of being unable to serve the public
interests.**
Director Hines Prepares
Report for President Wilson
After conferring with Chairmen
Cummins and Esch of the Senate and
House interstate commerce committees
regarding pending railroad legislation
Ihrector General Hines has drawn a re
port with recommendations for I "resi
dent Wilson.
It was said at the 'White House today
that the report would he given to the
President today or tomorrow, but offi
cials would not divulge its contents. In
hiK recent message to Congress the
President said he would deal with the
railroad situation in a separate message
and Mr. Hines was requested to draft a
report on the pending legislation.
While the President has announced
that the railroads would be returned
to private operation by January 1
there is a growing belief here that
return of the lines will await enact
ment of permanent legislation by
Congress. Officials, however, refuse
to comment.
PRESIDENT FORBIDS
MR. HITCHCOCK TO
NEGOTIATE ON PACT
(Continued from First Page.)
the peace treaty has been defeated.
Twenty republican senators stand
ready to agree to reservations which
forty-five democrats will accept, thus
making sixty-flve senators in favor
of a ratification of the peace treaty?
which is one more than is necessary.
Mr. Wilaon Believed Adamant.
Just what took place in the con
Tersation between President Wilson
and Senator Hitchcock last Friday as
the latter lingered behind when Sen
ator Fall of New Mexico left the sick
chamber has not been revealed, but
It doesn't take Capitol Hill long to
Biie up the situation. Coupled with
sundry things that have come to light
since last week concerning the Presi
dent's attitude toward compromise
there is no escaping the conclusion
that Mr. Wilson still believes he can
get the treaty through the Senate
without vital reservations, if any.
The attitude of many of his friends
Is entirely different. They see a prac
tical situation. They see the Senate
leaders committed to certain courses :
of action. They see many honest
doubts raised by some of the republi
can senators concerning ambiguous
phrajses of the treaty.
They believe in a league of nations
safeguarded against misconstruction
or misappropriation of the military
and naval forces of the United States.
They see foreign governments object
ing to the preamble and certain rser
vations. but ready in these critical
days to swallow a good deal more
than they might have been willing to
accept two weeks or two months ago.
They, too, are in a compromising
mood, for the need of the moral and
material support of the United States
in the process of reconstruction is so
acutc that no price seems too great
to pay to get America's help. Yet
there is no necessity of making the
price as extreme as it looked at first.
Kor many of the republicans are ready
to modify the preamble as well as j
certain of the *>njertionable res^rva- I
tiens.
I
Democrats May "(io It Alone."
Two developments may come out of
the present situation. Either Presi
dent Wilson will modify his per
sistent theory that the international i
situation will eventually compel the .
Senate to act of its own initiative or j
the democratic senators, under the J
leadership of Senator Hitchcock, will ;
"go it alone." In the latter case they |
would undertake, with the assistance j
of the republican leader, to work out
a compromise. Senator Lodge is re
ported to b*- unwilling to talk com
promise with Senator Hitchcock un
less ti e latter has explicit authoriza
tion of the President. On the other
hand, in the elusive game of where
the responsibility for delay shall lie
the Massachusetts senator would cer- j
tainly not maintain such an attitude
if Senator Hitchcock approached him !
a^> the leader of the democrats who !
were willing to accept reservations
and vote upon the saine irrespective
of whether they were to the taste of
the President.
Situation Summarised.
Mr. Wilson's trourse of dogged silence
Is fraught with many dangers. He
may split his own friendly following
in the Senate and kill efforts at com
promise. Many republicans who don't
want to see the treaty or league
established would be glad if Mr. Wil
son were clearly held responsible for
the killing of the pact. But the true
jfriends of the treaty inside- and out
side the Senate care muA less about
the pride of the President or the pride
?f the senators than th y do about
fritting a treaty of peace ratified that
will t>e a start, however imperfect,
toward the reconstruction of a war
torn world.

Bed Prosecution on Coast.
TACOMA, Washington, December 9.
?Federal Judge E. E. Cushman has
called a grand jury in line with the
government policy of prosecuting
radicals in this part of the state.
Evidence that radicals in Mexico,
with the knowledge and support of
President Carranza, plotted to insti
gate a revolution in the United States
and to seize the border states acquired
iby the American government in 1848
is contained in a memorandum on the
Mexican situation submitted to the
President last weeU by Senator Fall
of New Mexico. Senator Fall made
the memorandum public last night
following the receipt of a letter from
the President opposing action by the
Senate looking to breaking off dip
1 lomatic relations with Mexico. The
; senator is chairman of the foreign re
. lations subcommittee which has been
; investigating the Mexican situation.
Mfetlac In Mexico City.
Plans for the proposed revolution
were obtained by the subcommittee
from the minutes of a meeting last
October 15 in Mexico City of lodge
23, an organization of extreme
agitators and members of the Indus
trial Workers of the World. The
Mexican president is linked most di
rectly with the plot through corre
spondence in which he recommends
three men for special consideration
because of their connection with "the j
plan they desire to put into practice
in the state t>f Texas." These men, ,
the committee states, have been iflen- I
titled as active agents of Lodge 23.
The notes of the October 15 meet
ing of the radical lodge declare "there
appeared three delegates, two Amer
icans and one Mexican, who had ar
rived from the United States, and
| who claimed that "the society' would
I be able at the beginning of next No- J
I vember (that is, November. 1919) to
call a general strike of all miners
I and metal workers in the I'nited
1 States: that they have 3.000.000 ad
herents in that country, where they
will be able to seize one western
and two Atlanta norts; that a large
number of Aiperican soMi^rs were
preparing to take sides with them,
and that they proposed to establish
a capital of a reformed government
of the United States in the state of
Colorado; that when such a revolu
tion was successful, the Mexicans
rendering their assistance, the border
states which were acquired by the
United States under the treaty of
1848 would be returned to Mexico."
Photostatic Copies of letters.
The three men referred to are the
samp, the memorandum states, as
those mentioned by Carrazna in let
ters of which the committee has se
cured photastatio copies. The first
of these letters, dated June 4. and ad
dressed to Manual Aquirre Berlanga,
Mexican minister of gobernacion,
says:
j "Senor Lino Cabello, bearer of this
letter, is the person who. In com
pany with two friends, will bring to
you tTie manifestos and the plan
which they desire to put into prac
tice in the state of Texas.
"This plan being very favorable for
Mexico, please aid them in every way
and give the necessary instructions in
the frontier states. I remain,
"Tour affectionate friend.
"V. CARRANZA."
The second letter, dated August 19
and addressed to the same govern
ment official, follows:
"The present letter will be delivered
to you by Mr. Juan N. Garcia and the
two friends from Texas who accom
pany him and, in accordance with our
conversation, please give them the
guarantees they solicit, as well as the
pecuniary assistance they may de
sire. I remain.
"Your friend, affectionately,
"CARRANZA."
Mexico and Japan.
Other information Secured by the
committee and which it regards as re
liable indicated treaty negotiations
between Mexico and Japan. The docu
ment in possession of the committee
states that one high official of Mexico
would communicate to another high
official that "the treaty with Japan is
coming along," and that the writer is
convinced of the "great advantages it
would bring Mexico for its national
integrity." Reference is contained in
i another document to the support the
Mexican government proposes to give
German commercial initiative in
Mexico.
Senator Fall's comment on the plan
of revolution disclosed in the minutes
of the lodge meeting is that it would
appear "preposterous, ridiculous and
so fantastic as of Itself to deserve
little attention were it not. Brut, for
the fact, that it Is similar In all es
sentinals to the plan of San Diego,
which as the only judicial tribunal pass
ing upon the question was declared
to have been backed or supported by
.armed forces through a state of war
by V. Carranza in 1915; and, second,
were it not for the fact that the plan
of San Diego, itself antedating, and
this present plan, following, were and
are In exact line with the note of
June 19, 1917, from Zimmerman to
von Eckhart. then ambassador from
Germany to Mexicd"."
The Zimmerman note contained the
paragraph: "We (Germany) shall
give general financial support (to
Mexico), and it Is understood that
Mexico is to reconquer the lost ter
ritory in New Mexico. Texas and
Arizona." In this connection the
memorandum called attention to the
suggestion in the Zimmerman note
that Mexico communicate with Japan,
suggesting adherence to the plan and

offer her mediation between Japan
and Germany. . .
The evidence in possession or tne
committee. Senator Fall informed the
President, indicates that conditions
now along the border are "rapidly
taking on the same character which
had been assumed in our relations
with Mexico prior and subsequent to .
the date fixed for the uprisings under J
the plan of San Diego. ,
The New Mexico senator supported
his recent charges that radical litera-|
ture advocating the soviet form or
government was being distributed by
the Mexican embassy and the con
sulates of Mexico in the United
States by an account of the manner
in which the Information was se
cured. ,
A copy of the booklet was procured
from the embassy by wailing a re
quest to the embassy, the senator
said, adding that admission by the
author, Arthur Thomson, that the
Mexican government was aiding mm
in the distribution of his article, and
that it had secured from him several
thousand copies, is contained in a
letter written in reply to one signed
by a German name.
The committee, the memorandum
said, has obtained possession of what
President Carranza called his "'Blue
Book." At various places in this
book attention is called to "the op
pressive policy" of the United States
toward Mexico, and stress is laid upon
the assertion that President Carranza
has resisted every such encroach
ment. and in every instance from the
first proposed Niagara conference
down to and including the American
protests as to nationalization of lands
and other properties that he has been
successful by "refusing absolutely to
yield in any respect to tlu: demands"
of this government.
"Syntematlc Hostility."
The memorandum also contained a
copy of a letter said to have been
written by Carranza to Miss Hermila
Galindo. who had written a book en
titled "The Carranza Doctrine." The
Mexican president's note to her con
cerned a second book which he said
he wished her to write, and with this
in view he was sending her a copy
of the "Blue Book." which he said
would justify the attitude of his gov
|ernment in its "syste'taatic hostility
towards foreign speculators, especial
ly Americans and English."
"Do not forget my injunction." Car
ranza wrote, "to describe In lively
colors the tortuosity of the American
policy with relation to our country,
i causing the figure of Wilson to stand
well out as the director of that
policy."

200,000 in Michigan
in Idleness Awaiting
Indianapolis Parley
DETROIT, December 9.?Approxi
mately 200,000 idle industrial work
ers in Michigan anxiously watched
the miners' strike developments at
Indianapolis today, business houses
in practically every city In the state
were adjusting their affairs to a six
I hour day and at least 50.000 other
factory workers were expected to be
thrown out of work tonight or to
morrow. Manufacturers held little
hope of an immediate resumption of
normal operations even with an early
strike settlement, owing to the de
pleted fuel supplies of power com
panies.
None of the cities reported a short
age of fuel for domestic use, how
ever, and all of them set about a strict'
observance of the fuel administra
tion's conservation measures.
One of the largest automobile plants
in the city, compelled to close by the
orders of the national fuel adminis
tration. will attempt to reopen to
morrow with gasoline furnishing the
motive power to operate its ma
chinery. Hundreds of automobile
motors will be hooked up to turn
the factory wheels.
Anticipating success of the plan,
employes in twenty-one departments
have been ordered to return to work
Wednesday morning.
Supplies Refused "Volunteers."
BEAR CREEK, Mont., December 9.? |
Storekeepers have refused to sell sup-!
plies to volunteer miners who began
to dig coal in a mine of the Bear
Creek Company. Refusal of the
keepers of a boarding house to fur
nish accommodations to the men re
sulted in the purchase of the place to
be operated by the volunteers.
Little Effort to Obey
in Pittsburgh District
PITTSBURGH, Pa., December 9.?
Little was being done in the Pitts
burgh district today to obey the in
junction of the government and save
fuel. Mills with coal supplies were
operating as usual, stores were open
for their customary hours, and. this
being a dark day. lights were burn
ing in office buildings and residences.
Railroads, however, were curtailing
schedules and cutting off trains.
At the offices of the railroad admin
istration. it was said, no order had
been received from Washington put
ting the fuel conservation regulations
into effect, and so far as known there,
individual and corporate initiative
was responsible for such steps as had
been taken.
It was expeoted that before night
fall many business organizations, even
if a formal order did not come from
Washington, would have perfected
plans to carry out the published regu
lations.
tittle Increase Shown
in West Virginia Fields
CHARLESTON. W. Va? December
9.?The United States district court
injunction restraining members of
the miners' union fron^ conspiring to
keep the strike ordef in effect in the
southern West Virginia coal fields
has not resulted in any material in
crease in the number of mines work
ing, according to reports received to
day by operators. These reports
showed-that since Saturday, when the
court order was issued, only slight
improvement has been noted in the
Kanawha and New river fields.
Most of the Kanawha mines were
still closed today, and early reports
indicated that there was no change
in the New river fields. Operators
said, however, that non-union mines
were working at normal and that in
the organized Fairmont district all
mines were operating excepting two.
Secretary Wilson Wires
Lewis to Urge Miners
to Accept Proposal
Secretary Wilson today sent a tele
gram to John L. Lewis, acting presi
dent of the United Mine Workers of
America, urging the miners to accept
President Wilson's proposal for set
tlement of the coal strike. The
miners' representatives are to act on
the proposal this afternoon at in
dianapolis.
The President, Secretary Wilson
said, "has pointed a way out with
honor to the government and honor
to yourselves."
Text of Telegram.
The telegram, which was addressed
also to the members of the miners'
scale committee, follows:
"I cannot too strongly urge you to
accept the basis of settlement pro
posed by the President. I have been
associated with him for more than
six years, and I know .that every
fiber of his strong nature has been
devoted towards securing fair play
for everybody, and particularly the
under dog in a fight. Every blow
he has had to bear?and he has had
to bear many of them?has been
brought about by his intense earnest
ness in that direction. You can rely
thoroughly upon every promise he
makes.
"But aside from that, as a result of
the stoppage of work in the mines
we are facing the most difficult in
dustrial situation that ever confront
ed the country. It threatens the very
starvation of our social life. In this
emergency the President has pointed
a way out with honor to the govern- i
ment and honor to yourselves. If my
judgment and experience are of any!
value to you. let me use them in ad
vising you, for the welfare of your
self and the country as a whole, to
accept the way out that is proposed
by the President."
Secretary Morrison of the American
Federation of Labo-- and other labor,
leaders conferred with senators today
in behalf of the effort to secure from
the Treasury Department a detailed
statement of profits made by indi
vidual coal operators as disclosed by I
their income tax returns. A reso
lution by Senator Johnson, demo- j
crat. South Dakota, for this purpose j
is pending and. at Secretary Morri-1
son's suggestion, will be broadened
by Senator Johnson when he calls it
before the Senate, to require sub
mission of operators' capitalization.
INAUGURATE M0BR0W TODAY
FRANKFORT, Ky., December 9.?
Inauguration of Edwin P. Morrow,
the first republican Governor of Ken
tucky in sixteen years, drew a great
throng to the capital today. A pa
rade headed by Mr. Morrow through
flag-bedecked streets, the usual re
ception at the statehouso and the
inaugural ball at night were on the
program.
In his inaugural address Mr. Mor
row promised to carry out the cam
paign pledges of his party, pledged
himself to the development of the
nation's natural resources, to promote
every agency of public education 'and
to protect the integrity of state in
stitutions. The reference to state in
stitutions apparently harked back to
the campaign, one of the slogans of
which was a promise of a "house
cleaning at Frankfort."
Bomb Damages at Havana.
HAVANA. Monday. December 8.?A

CHINESE STUDENT
IS PLACED ON TRIAL
Ziang Sung Wan Faces In
dictment for Murder in
First Degree.
Ziang: Sung Wan. a Chinese student,
was placed on trial today before Jus
tice Gould, in Criminal Division 1. to
answer an indictment for murder In
the flrst degree in connection with
the death of Ben Sen \Vu, an assistant
at the Chinese aducational mission, at
2023 Kalorama road. January last
The morning session of the court was j
occupied in a vain attempt to secure a |
jury. The panel of regular jurors was |
exhausted and the court ordered a j
special venire for tomorrow.
Wan is also under indictment for i
the death of Dr. Theodore T. Wong. !
director of the mission, and of Chang
Hsi Hsie. secretary of the institution. |
whose bodies were discovered at the ,
mission at the same time that Wu's j
death became known, three days after
the tragedy. The triple murder gave
the police a mystery to work on. and
a visit of detectives to N'ew York re
sulted in the finding of Wan and his
younger brother, Tsong Ing Van. who
consented to come to Washington to
aid in the unravelling of the'mystery, j
The arrest of the brothers followed .
and they were held by a coroner's jury
as responsible for the tragedy.
Indictment for Forgery.
The grand jury after an extended
inquiry into the homicudes reached
the conclusion that the elder brother
alone did the shooting and tffat the
younger one should be exonerated.
As Van. however, bad been identified
by officials of the Riggs National
Bank as the Chinaman who presented
early January 30 a check for $3,000
supposed to be signed by Dr. Wong
and his secretary Hsie. an indictment
for forgery was reported against the
younger brother, and he is now
awaiting trial.
Although Wan is charged with a
triple murder by the grand Jury to
day, he was called on to answer only
the indlatment charging the death of
Wu. United States Attorney Laskey
and Assistant United States Attorney
Laws, who are conducting the prose
cution, explained that the reason for
trying first the Wu murder Is that
according to an alleged confession
obtained from Wan by the police he
admitted that he had killed Wu, but
explained that he did so only after
he discovered that Wu had killed his
two friends. D*. Wong and Hsie.
Attorneys James A. O'Shea and
Charles Kahy, for the accused, have
not yet outlined their defense, but
from questions put to the prospective
jurors it would appear that they will
attempt to expose the "third degree"
methods claimed to have been adopted
by the police to secure the alleged
confession.
The theory of the government, as
indicated in the wording of the in
dictments. appears to be that it was
the scheme of the two brothers to
break into the Chinese mission and
obtain possession of the check boodc
in general use there and forge the
signatures of Dr. Wong and his sec
retary to a check large enough to
cover what the two brothers are said
to have knoVn was on deposit with
the Riggs National Bank. Their dis
covery in this act is thought to have
led to the triple murder.
TO ASK G. 0. P. LEADERS
TO AID FEDERAL WORKERS
Head of Employes' Federation Be
quests Hearing: Before Na
tional Committee Here.
The National Federation of Federal
Employes will ask the republican na
tional committee, at its meetings here
this week, for republican party sup
port for legislation to improve con
ditions in the federal civil service.
In a letter addressed to Chairman
Hays today President Luther C.
Steward of the National Federation
of Federal Employes asks for a hear
ing in order to lay before the mem
bers of the republican national com
mittee and thus before the party
leaders * throughout the country the
specific measures deemed essential by
the organixed employes of the gov
ernment as represented by the 153
local unions of the federation in forty
three states.
The organized employes demand pro
tection in organizing and affiliating
with the American Federation of
Labor.
Equally important, from the em
ployes' point of view, is the proposi
tion of the national federation for a
new kind of Civil Service Commis
sion, with enlarged powers and a
personnel to include representatives
of employes, administrative officials
and the general public, women as well
as men to be members of each group.
Coupled with this proposition the fed
eration urges legislation gmarantee
| ing to women in the service equal op
[ portunities and equal pay with men.
I The Nolan minimum wage bill, ex
j tension of the work of reclassification
to the- entire civil servce of the
United States, and, pending such ex
[ tension, a wage increase of $480 per
year for employes receiving base pay
up to and including $2,500 per year, I
$360 for those in the grades between
$2,500 and $3,500 per year and $240
for the grades between $3,500.and $4,
500 per year, are other features of the
employes' program.

LAND CUUMS FILED
FOR D. WtRIY
Officials Here Deny Validity
of Rights as Asserted
Under Old Law.
Several persons have filed claims to
enter valuable downtown business
properties in Washington under an
cient land lawn applicable to public
lands. They have paid entry fees or
$1 an acre for the land filed up?>n.
Such persons claim right to the cost
ly property under the terms of an
act of Congress of March 3, 1S07. I
which set out that public lands could
be held only by the securing of a par
ent from the commissioner of the pen
eral land office. Such patents have
not been taken out by District land
owners, they claim, and this land in
the District, they sav. beeamo part of
the public domain when it was oeded
to the United States by Maryland.
Make l ight of Project.
Officials of the title guarantee con
panies, of the offioe of the recorder of
deeds, of the District surveyor s of
fice are inclined to make light of the
project to acquire valued lard at ?
i low pric. They declare that there <s
no reason why property owners
should become apprehensive. 1'rop
j erty rights held in the District of
{Columbia are safe and will be protect
ed. these officials state.
Those who have filed caveats or made
entries and paid fees at $1 an acr.
will have only ,their trouble for their
pains, it is stated, by title guarantee
companies in the District.
It is understood that about twenty
five claims have be.n filed and fees
paid, the fees being held awaiting a
decision of some higii official of the gen
eral land office in the Interior Depart
ment
Warning to Re?i<len??.
"Do not pay any retaining fee for
defending possible land title su>ts af
fecting property in the District of Co
lumbia," is the warning to property
owners from Secretary Seymour < ' the
Chamber of Commerce.
The safest plan. Secretary Seymour
suggested, would lie for property owners
to keep calm and refuse to pay heed
to any persons who might seek a fee
Melvin C. Hazen, surveyor of :he Dis
trict, said today there is absolutely no
foundation for the claim that the United
States originally held title to land in
the Dis*ict of Columbia and that, the
present owners have not a clear title un
less they obtained a patent for their
, land from the United States land ofli.e
The grand total of estimated and a!
readv-approved estimates for the fiscal
year 1911 is $5,249,470,031.?2 and these
must be scientifically and efficiently cut
to under $4,000,000,000, according to x
warning made to the Housei today by
Chairman Good of the appropriations
committee. House L?eader Mondell will
address the House on the same subject
I tomorrow.
After summing up all the proposed
appropriations in the book of estimates
and other appropriations already ap
proved or supplementary to pending
legislation. Representative Good warn
ed :
"Whatever its legislative duties, no
greater problems confront this Congress
than that of applying the pruning knife
to the estimates of expenditures.
"It must be applied with intelli
gence. but with vigor and determina
tion, for if this Congress shall appro
priate more than $4,000,000,000 for the
expenses of the government for the
next fiscal year, over and above the
necessary appropriations for the rail
road administration, it will fall short
of its obligations to the taxpayers of
the United States."
Kollr to Increase Borden.
It is absolutely imperative at this
time. Mr. Good said, that the members
of the House must realize the folly
of fathering legislation that proposes
to still further increase the financial
burden. He gave a carefully pre
pared survey of the financial situa
tion facing Congress.
He pointed out that the estimates
sent to Congress by the Secretary of
the Treasury do not include $78,000.
000 in the Post Office appropriations
act. In addition to $26,000,000 in the
permanent appropriations for road
construction; nor $125,000,000 which
the Secretary of the Treasury in his
annual report said he proposes to pay
under the law in redeeming war sav
ings certificates; nor $25,000,000 for
retiring federal reserve bank notes,
nor $300,000 for miscellaneous re
demption of public debt.
Other requirements of the govern
ment for large sums were emphasized
by Mr. Good.
