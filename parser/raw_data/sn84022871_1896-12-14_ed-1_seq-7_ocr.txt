Let The Whole World

Dr.Miles' Heart Cure Does
-
HEAKT DISEASE, has its victim at a
disadvantage- Always taught that
heart disease is Incurable, when the
symptoms become well defined, the patient
becomes alarmed and a nervous panic takes
place. But when a sure remedy is found
and a cure effected, after years of suffering,
there is great rejoicing and desire to "let
the whole world know." Mrs. Laura Wine
inger, of Selkirk, Kansas, writes; "I desire
to let the whole world know what Dr. Miles'
XT Mi1rc' Heart Cure has done for
Uim 1 111 CO me For ten years I had
Heart Cure pain in my heart short-
ness of breath, palpita
IvCStOreS tion, pain in my leftside.
TTaoltri oppressed feeling in my
XlCHllll chest, weak and hungry
spells, bad dreams, could not lie on either
side, was numb and suffered terribly. I took
Dr. Miles' Heart Cure and before I finished
the second bottle I felt its good effects, I feel
now that I am fully recovered, and that Dr.
Miles' Heart Cure saved my life."

Preacher How do you like your
new mamma, Johnny? Johnny Oh,
party good. I ate a jar of plums yis
taday and she blamed it on the hired
girl.
Dearest, if I were far away could
you still love me? Why, Reggy,
what a question! I'm sure the farther
you were away the better I should
love you.
Teacher James, can you tell me
what is meant by a cubic yard?
James I don't know exactly, but I
guess it's a yard that the Cuban
children play in.
I believe he had two sons; one of
them was lost at sea, and the other
became vice-president of the United
States. And of course neither of them
was heard of afterwards?
Mother Don't eat your pie now,
Johnnie; save it until the last. John

but the kid who swiped my pie at the

I guess we'd better tell that errand
boy he'll have to give up his habit of
whistling, said the business man. I
shouldn't do that, his partner replied.
The only time he hurries is when he
is keeping time to a march.
Stand back! exclaimed the friend of
the man who was down on the
ground. Stand back, and give him
air! And the bystanders accommo
datingly stood back; while the man
who was down on the ground calmly
went on pumping up his rear tire.
A great many people sleep between
these walls, said the guide, showing a

church where the noble families were
interred. Same way over in our coun

they get a better preacher.
Mrs. Coopah What fo' yoh take

want no gun to get a Thanksgiving
turkey? Mr. Coopah Yes, indeed I

pishuslike when I bring um home as I

Visitor I am grieved to learn of
your mistress' illness. Nothing seri
ous no great cause for alarm, I
trust? The new French maid No,
monsieur, nozzing beeg, nozzing
grande. Something what you call
little, petite. What zey call ze little
small small pox.
Mre. Chaffie I don't know how I
can get Johnnie to take his 'medicine.
If I tell him what it is, he won't take
it, and if I don't tell him what it is he
won't take it. Mr. Chaffie I'll tell
you what to do. Just put it on the
table and forbid him to touch it, and
then he will take it sure.
Harry She has jilted me, and I
know I shall die. The disappoint

Mr. Hardbake, with a sigh, you'd see
that there wasn't no other way to

At the second battle of Bull Run a
Michigan regiment, in making a
change of position, came upon a Con
federate soldier sitting astride of a
Federal, who was lying on his back.
Each had a firm hold of the other, and
neither could break the hold. As the
troops came up, the "reb" was taken
in, and as the "Yank" rose to his feet
he was asked how he had got into
such a fix.
"Why, I captured the Johnny," he
replied.
"Then how did he come to be on
top?"
"That's what makes me so mad!"
shouted the bluecoat. "He captured
me the same time I did him, and then
he wouldn't toss up to see who had
the bulge! He's no gentleman no
sir, he aint!"

WASHINGTON LETTER.
SPEOIAL OOa&BSPONDHCTOH OF THH MON1TOB.
Washington, Dec. 7ih, 1896.
Speaker Reed's '.'the House will
please be in order" at noon today an
nounced the opening of the last ses
sion of the fifty-fourth Congress. Ev
ery seat was not filled, but more than
a quorum of the House was in attend
ance. Ditto the Senate. The prin
cipal business of the first day was the
alleged listening to the reading of the
message, because they all have print
ed copies of it, but today, when they
all knew that the recommendations of
the message will not amount to a row
of pins as a factor in influencing le
gislation, there was scarcely a pre
tense of listening. There are many
points of resemblance between the
message and that sent to Congress
one year ago the same ideas are
stated in different language.
While none of the numerous repub
lican Senators and Representatives
who have recently been to Canton
are willing to quote President-elect
McKinley to that effect, their general
manner of talking leaves not the
slightest doubt that an extra session
of Congress will be called together
within a few weeks after the inaugu
ration, to pass a tariff bill, regardless
of whether this session passes any
revenue legislation or not.
Chairman Hanna has no reason to
complain of any lack of attention
since his arrival in Washington, to
make the start on the preparation for
the inauguration. Indeed, it is fair
to suppose after seeing the crowds
which are always around him he sees
all callers that he would be just as
well pleased with less attention. Gen.
Horace Porter, who will be Chief
Marshal of the inaugural parade, is
one of Mr. Hanna's constant com
panions and assistants. It is regarded
as about settled that the Inaugural
Ball will be held in the new Library
Building.
The substitute for the House Im
migration Bill, which provides that
no immigrant shall be admitted who
is unable to read five lines of the U. S.
constitution in some printed language
is the "unfinished business" of the
Senate and as such has the right of
way in that branch of Congress. The
bill is in charge of Senator Lodge who
expresses confidence that it will pass.
There seems no logical reason for op
posing it. Certainly no man who is so
illiterate that he cannot read in any
language can be considered a desir
able accession to our country.
Senator Dubois of Idaho isn't half
as sure that he will be re-elected to
the Senate as some other people have
assumed to be. He said on the sub
ject: "Those friends who have been
saying that I would certainly be re
elected don't know anything about
the situation. It is the democrats who
are bothering me. They have united
with the populists and are engaged in
a still hunt for an original silver man
to represent them in the Senate."
And, while Senator Dubois didn't say
so, it is evident that he fears they
will find the man they are hunting
for. There is no truth in the state
ment that the Republican National
Committee is trying to prevent the
re-election of Senator Dubois, to
punish him for bolting the St. Louis
Convention.
Representative Blue of Kansas,
who has made more of a name for
himself than most members do in
their first term, and who was a victim
of the popo-dem. combine, presents
this word picture of the elements that
carried his state this year: "The lead
ers of the populists in Kansas are at
heart socialists every one of them,
and they welcomed Bryan's candida
cy because they believed it was in its
essence socialistic, as indeed it was.
The unrest and discontent in Europe
and in this country are but manifesta
tions of socialism. Every man who
had failed in his professional business,
whose life had been unsuccessful, was
on Bryan's side; so were those who
contend that one man should not
have any more property than anoth
er; that all citizens should stand on
an absolute equality regardless of in
dustry and ability, and that it is the
business of the government to sup
port the people rather than the peo
ple to support the government."
Commissioner of Pensions Murphy
has had several unpleasant interviews
with republican Congressmen who
accuse him of having during the cam
paign, purposely delayed answers to
calls they made on the Pension Bu
reau in behalf of their constituents,
for the purpose of injuring them and
preventing their getting votes. Mr.
Murphy denied the accusation , in
every case, but that didn't prevent the
indignant Congressmen having their
say, and it will not prevent their
working to have Murphy's head be
among the first that falls after the
inauguration of President McKinley.
One of the notable absentees of the
opening session of the Senate was
Senator Allison of Iowa, who was
kept at home by a severe cold.

MASONIC TEMPLE CURIOS.
Many Rare Relics Carefully Preserved In
New York.
Few people are aware that, hidden
away in carefully guarded rooms of an
imposing structure at Sixth avenue and
Twenty-third street, New York city,
are preserved rare relics of bygone ages,
works of art and priceless curios. These
raretiea are to be found in the Masonic
temple, where strangers are seldom per
mitted to enter.
The temple itself is one of the most
interesting objects of interest in New
York. The massive bronze pillars at the
entrance excite curiosity. The mysteri
ous figures at the foot and the marble
statue of "Silence" at the head of the
grand staircase may cause an inquiry
to be made. The richly emblazoned coat
of arms of the Masonic fraternity over
the grand lodge room door cannot fail
to attract attention, and other features
on the same floor will certainly lead the
inquisitive to ask what it all mean.
But these are about all that the stranger
is likely to see. On the floor above the
grand lodge room are the library, read
ing room and museum of the Masonic
fraternity.
In the library of the Masonic temple
are books and records that have no du
plicate in this country. One is a three
volume folio work, bound in vellum,
printed in Latin with large type, in the
year 1604. This gives a' description of
King Solomon's temple and has several
finely executed engravings, maps, de
signs of architecture and pictures show
ing the customs of the ancient Jews. The
work was gotten up for and dedicated
to Philip II of Spain by a distinguished
member of the Society of Jesus. A
"black letter Bible" of about the same
date is in the library. It ia supposed to
be a copy of the famous "Breeches Bi
ble," but the pages which should have
proved this are absent. With this excep
tion the work is perfect and has many
curious charts.
An old English work, giving the his
tory of the Masoqic society, or Society
of Builders, from the time of William
the Conqueror to the date of publication
about the beginning o the last cen
tury is a curiosity. It gives the names
of all the grand masters for nearly 1,000
years. A number of works, published
during the exciting times of the anti
Masonic crusade, are also in the library.
Both sides of the struggle are therein
related. These books were preserved by
Mason3 during that eventful period, and
now, when the principal actors have
passed away, become objects of histor
ical curiosity. Masonic magazines,
works of distinguished Masonic authors
and encyclopedias go to make this li
brary one of the most valuable for refer
ence to be found anywhere in the Unit
ed Stat.
The greatest interest, however, cen
ters in the museum of Masonic curiosi
ties and antiquities. In this collection
can be found the gold trowel used by
Benjamin Franklin while master of
the ledge in Pennsylvania, preserved by
Franklin lodge of New York state and
presented by that body to the museum.
A model of the obelisk, made under the
direction of the late Commander Gor-
ringe, has been deposited in the museum
by Anglo-Saxon lodge of Brooklyn, to
which he was attached as a member.
Three candlesticks used by Ancient
chapter, No. 1, of Royal Arch Masons
during the last century are curiosities.
A past grand master's jewft presented
to the grand lodge of New York by the
grand lodge of New Jersey in 1782, re
calls the early period of Masonry in this
country. The jewels and records of
Rainbow lodge of New York state, sto
len by British soldiery daring the war
of 1812 to 1814 and preserved by a lodge
in Montreal, to which place they had
been taken, is found commemorated
here by a past master's jewel on which
the whole history of the affair is en
graved. Coins and Masonic medals of
great antiquity are preserved. One,
commemorating the creation of a Eon of
King George III as grand master of Ma
sons in America and England, struck
before the Revolution, is of great inter
est to American Masons. Detroit Free
Press.
Supreme JL&w of the Land.
"The constitution of the United States
is the supreme law, and every law of
congress, every state constitution and
every state law must be brought to the
test of this supreme law and is valid or
invalid as it stands, or fails to stand,
that test," writes ex-President Harrison
in the Ladies' Home Journal. "The in
terpretation and enforcement of the na
tional constitution and laws could not,
for several obvious reasons, be left to
the state courts. Uniformity of inter
pretation would be impossible if the su
preme appellate courts of the states
could, each for itself and finally for the
people of the particular state, construe
the national constitution and laws. And
especially questions affecting the con
flicting powers of a state and of the na
tional government could not be left to
the decision of the state court. If the
powers given to the national govern
ment were to be maintained and uni
formly and beneficially exercised, it was
essential that the final judicial deter
mination of the scope and limits of these
powers should be confided to national
courts. It would not have done in 1861
to submit the question of the right of a
state to secede from the Union to the
"supreme court of South Carolina."
Utilize Old Jewelry.
Much of tho old fashioned jewelry that
our grandmothers wore can be made
over into many pretty, quaint bits of
modern wear that will delight the relic
loving woman. Old earrings, invariably
quaint and odd looking, can be trans
formed into very attractive heads for
hatpins, and the old time hair brooches
with the hair usually much frayed
now may be slipped out of their twist-"
ed frames and laid lovingly away, 4 f or
memory's sake," while the frames'
themselves may be made to encircle a
recent miniature. Beautiful chatelaines
may be fashioned out of the heavy, long
watch chains of "auld lang syne."
Experiments in machine voting, at
Rochester, N. Y., and Worcester,
Mass., at the recent national election,
appear on tho whole to have been
most flattering to the hopes of those
who have looked forward to these
trials with confidence in their success.
It is currently reported, and without
doubt is true that there was a saving
of more than $10,000 in the cost of the
election, in the city of Rochester
alone. Both at Rochester and Wor
cester the working of the machines
appears to have been perfectly satis
factory, save to a few persons, who
doubtless bad beforehand made up
their minds to be dissatisfied. This
class of people is met everywhere,
and deserves very little considera
tion. If these machines will prevent
election frauds, they should certainly
be adopted before another election,
though, truth to tell but few case of
fraud in the last election have yet
been brought to light.
Seems as if con
sumption always
picks out the bright
est and best. Fully
one-sixth of all the
deaths that occur in
the world are caused
by consumption.
Many things were
once considered im
possible. It would
'be strange if med-
ical science did not make
some progress. The telegraph and tele
phone, the phonograph, the electric light
all were once impossible, and once it was
impossible to cure consumption. That was
before the time of Dr. Pierce's Golden Med
ical Discovery. Taken according to direc
tions, this standard remedy will cure 98 per
cent, of all cases of consumption. Consump
tion is caused and fostered by impurity in
the blood. It is cured by purity and rich
ness of the blood surely, certainly cured
by the " Medical Discovery." It builds up
solid healthy flesh and vigorous strength.
