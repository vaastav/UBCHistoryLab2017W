THE . PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
' '! ' Owing touthe great" length of the
President's Message, we are unable at
present lo publish it in full. We will
":gtve its leading features, with- a few
'comments. ' It is clear that Mr. Grant,
' is not the author of tbe document. It
-is the ' joint production of Secretary
Fish,. John W. lorney, L . S. Grant,
and a few of his friends. In point of
-literary merit, it excels anything writ
; ten by Mr. Lincoln. The Message
-'pens as follows :
CONGRATULATORY
i ' lA.ycar of peace and ganoral pros
... perity to'this nation has passcvl since
. the last assembling of .Congress.
''We have, through a kind Providence,
'';een blessed with abundant crops, and
?-Jbeen spared from complications and
i". war with foreign nations. In our
j,i?jmidst comparative harmony has been
l restored . It 13 to be regretted, how
." ever, thrt a free exercise of the elec
V'tive franchise has been denied to citi
- J -Zens in exceptional cases, in several
.'. State's lately in rebellion, and tli9 ver
dict of the people has thereby been
"' reversed. The States of Virginia,
f' "' Mississippi and Texas have been re
Stored to representation in our uation
L jmI councils.- Georgia, the only State
mow withont representation, may be
confidently expected to take her place
" there also at the . beginning . of the
,J "new year, and then let us hope will be
completed the. work of reconstruction.

C '3 UNITED STATES PROTECTION EX
f - '- TENDED TO FOREIGN RESI DENTS
. OF PARIS.
Soon after the existing war broke
xut in Europe, the protection ot the
k- United States Minister, in Paris was
;'invoked in' favor of the North Ger
: ... mans domiciled in French territory.-
Instructions were issued to grant the
" protection, lhis lias been loljowcd
in hy an extention c4 American protec
ts p-tioa. to citizens of Saxony, Gotha,
-w.Hesse, and Saxe-Coburg, Colomhia,
Portugal, Uraguay, the Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, .Chili, Paraguay,
e-and Venezuela in F&ris. The charge
-was an enormous one, requiring con-
' '.t ttant and severe labor as well as the
. Exercise of patience, prudence and
good judgment. It has been per-
formed to the entire satisfaction of
-v this government ; and as I am ofli--B1
cially; informed, equally so to the
satisfaction vi iuo guveromeui 01
North Germany.
RECOGNITION OF THE FRENCH RE
PUBLIC. 'T". ' As soon as I learned that a Repub-
,',:lio had been proclaimed fat Paris, and
''r that the people ot France had acquies
"" ' 1 cedin the change, the Minister of tbe
a ' United States was directed by tele
graph to recognize 'it, and t?nder my
, , , congratulations and- those of tbe pco-
, pie of the United states, lne re-es-'"'
tablishment in France of a system of
."'cbvernment disconnected wilh the dy
. t JlOSbtC iraulLlvxis ui iij'c-v uj'iicu
v; to bo a proper subject lor the ielicita
7' -'tionof Americans. Should the pres
. ent struggle result in aiuiching the
'"'J hearts of the French to our simpbr
" "j';' forms of representative government,
" it will be a Bubiect of still further sst-
I . r v.. . a
"'isfaction to our people. While we
'.' make no effort to impose our iastitu
" tions upon the inhabitants of other
countries, and while we adhere to onr
traditional neutrality iu civil contests
elsewhere, we cancot be indifferent
.to the spread of American political
"' ideas in a great and highly civilized
. "country like France.
L . THE CUBAN INSURRECTION.
! . It b not understood that the condi-
tion of. the insurrection in Cuba has
' materially changed 6ince the close of
the last session of Congress. In an
;. early stage of the contest, the author
ities of Spain inaugurated a system of
arbitrary arrests, ot close con fane
I :' in ent, ot military trial and execution
1. "of persors suspected of complicity
d v ith the insurgent', and of summary
- embargo of their properties ami requi
; vsWiitians of their revenues by executive
warrant. ,f Such proceedings, a.-: jar as
tnev aliecteU the rtersons or property
of citizens oi the United States, were
in violation of the treaty of 1795, be-
citizens ot the United totates, by rea
son of such violations, were made to
the Spanish government From April,
1869 to June, last, the Spanish Minis
ter at Washington had bceu clothed
with a limited power t aid iu redress
ing such wrongs That power was
found to bo withdrawn, in view, it
was said, of the favorable situation in
which the island ot Cub.i then was,
which, however, did. not lead te revo
lution or suspension of the extraordi
nary and arbitrary functions exercised
by the executive power in Cuba; and
were obliged to make our complaint
at Madrid In the negotiations thus
opened, and still pending there, - the
Uuited States only claimed that lor
the future the rights secured to their
citizens by treaty should be respected
in Cuba, and that as to the past a
joint tribunal f houKl be established in
the United fetates, with lull jurisdic
tion over all such claims. Before all
such an impartial tribunal each claim
ant would be required to prove his
case. Un the other l:aii(l, bpani
would be at liberty lo traverse every
material fact and thus complete equity
would be done.
The Prosident made harte to recog
uizc the new French Republic, wbic'.i
in fact, has no . real existence. But
the patriots of Cuba, who have suc
cessfully defied the tyrants of Spain,
for the last two years, find no friend
in Grant. He would rather see them
cut to piece or garoted then to ad
mit that a Repubiio.and freedom are
possible for Cubans.
TnE ANNEXATION OF SAN DO
MINGO.
During the last session of Congress
a treaty for the annexation of tbe Re
public ot fan Uomiugo to tne United
States failed to receive the requisite
two thirds vole of the Senate. I was
thoroughly convinced then that the
best interests of the country, coramer
cirtlly and ' materially, demanded its
ratification. Time has only confirm
ed me iu this view. I now firmly be
lieve, that the moment it is known
that the United States have entirely
abandoned the sulject of accepting as
a part of its territory the Island of
San Dmiugo, a free port will be ne
gotiated for by Emopcan nations, in
i he 13a y ot bamana a large commer
cial city will spring up, to which we
will be tributary without receiving
correspondent benefits. The Govern
ment of ban Domingo nai vo uutanly
sought this anae.xatiou It is a weak
power, numbering probably less than
ons hundred aud tw.-nty thousand
souls, and yet possessing one of the
richest localities uuder the sun, capa
ble of supporting a population of i0.
000,000 of people in luxury. The
people of Sau Domingo are not capa
ble of maintaining themselves iu their
present condition, must loo lor out
side support. They yearn for the pro
tectiou of our free institutions and
laws our progress aud civilization.'
Shall we refuse them ? Tile acquisi
tion ot San Domingo is desirable be
cause of iu geographical position. It
commands the euirancu to the Currib
bean Sea and the Isthmus transit !
of commence. It possesses the rich
est soil, best and- most capacious har
bors, most salubrious climate, and the
most valuable products ot the foieit,
mine and soil 01 auy of the West In
dia Inlands. Its possession by the
United States williu a few years build
up a coast raise commerce of im
mense magnitude, which will go lar
towards restoring 10 us our lost mer-.'
chant marines. It will give to us
those articles which we consume large
ly and do not produce, thus cqualiz.ug
our exports and imports.
Mr. Grant, has a sort of mania on
tbe Domingo business. He button
holed Congress last winter, and insist
ed upon its purchase -vith such per
sistence, that Sumner and other lead
ing Republicans turned away with
disgust. Domingo is an African colo
ny. It is a fair sample of what the
South will be, it Republican rule can
place its government in the hands of
negroes He admits that the Domin
go negroes cannot govern themselves!
- THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.
I regret to say .no conclusion bar
been reached lor the adjustment of tte
claims against Great Britain growing
out of the course adopted by that
Government during the rebellion.
The?abinet of London, so far as its
views have been expressed, coes not
appear to be willing to concede that
lier Majesty s tjovernment was guil
ty of negligence, or did or permitted
any act during the war by which the
United States has any just cause qf
complaint. Our firm and unalterable
convictions are directly the reverse,
and therefore rccomiueud to Confess
to authorize the appointment of a com
mission to take proof of the amounts
and ownership ot their claims on no
tice to the representative of Her Ma
iusty at Washington, and that author
ity be uiven lor the settlement of
these claims by the United States, so
that the Government shall nave the
ownership of tbe private claims, as
well aa the responsible control ot all
demands against Great Britain. L
cannot be necessary to add that when
ever Her M.'ijestj-'s Government shad
entertain a desire tor a lull and Iriend-
ly adjustment of these claims, the
United Stales will enter upon ineir
consideration with an earnest dosire
for a t.onclusion consistent with th
honor and dignity of both nations.
From the summary manner in
which Reverdy Johnson and Mr. Mot
ley were rc called from the Court cf
St. James, we were led to believe that
Mr. Grant, and his advisers wero
about to bring Great Britain up with
a round turn on the Alabama claims.
It would now seem, ' that the Presi
dent is ready to come down from his
stilts, 'and will bo content with doing
that which should have been done in
the first place, viz : to ascertain what
injuries were done, and the amount
of damages. Of course Great Brit
tain will shudder over the new pro
gramme. Will Sehenck now go on .a
fools errand, for General Grant ? We
will see.
REVENUE REFORM.
'Revenue reform has not been de
fined by any of iU advocates to inv
1 knowledge, but s-eenis to be something
which islo supply every man's wants
w'lhout any cost or effort on his part.
A true revenue reform cannot be made
in a day, but must be the work ofra
tional legislation and of time As
soon as revenue can be dispensed with,
all duty should be removed' from cof
fee, ten, and other articles of univer
sal use not produced by ourselves.
The necessities of the country com
pels us to collect revenue from im
ports. An army of collectors and as
sessors is not a pleasant sight to the
citizen, but that or a tariff for revenue
is necessary. Such a tariff, so lar as
it acts in encouragenent to home ,ro
luc s, affords employment to labor at
living wages in contrast to the pauper
labor of the old world, and also in the
development of home resources.
In the west, revenue reform is un
derstood to mean the discharge of an
army of tax eaiers now quartered on
the people, and a different and more
economical mode of providing reven
ues. OUR DEPRESSED COMMERCE.
. Our depressed commerce is a sub
ject to which I called your epecial at
tention at the hist session. I suggest
ed that we will in the future have to
look more to the countries south of
us, and to China and Japan for its re
vival. Our l f -present a tives to all tbese
governments have exerted their influ
ence to encourage trade between t!ie
United States and the countries to
which they are accrditedr but the fart
exists that the carrying is done almost
entirely in foreign bottoms, and while
this state of affairs exists, we cannot
control our due share of the com
merce of the world ; that between th
Pacific States and China and Japan is
about all the earn i"g trade now con
ducted in American vasfels. I would
recommend a liberal policy towards
that line of Americ n tteamcr3 one
that will insure its success and even
increased usefulness. The cost of
building iron vessels the only ones
that compete with foreign ship in the
carrying trade is so much greater in
the United Mat 33 than in foreign
countries, that without some assist
ance from the Government they can
not be successfully built here. There
will be several propositions laid before
Congress in the courso of the' present
session, looking to a remedy for this
eyil. ' Even it it should be at some
cost to the national treasury, I hope
such enco;ir.igement will be given as
will secure American s! lipping on the
high seas and American shipbuilding
at home.
Prohibitory tariffs, and commercial
enterprise do not belong to the same
people. By prohibiting foreign man
ufactures, and interchange of commo.
dities, our commercial ravy will ne
cessarily rot iu our own p;rts; while
yankce g"eed will thrive for want of
competition, by fixing a price for the
raw material as. well as for the manu
factured article. This is the occasion
of the luin of the American trade. -CIVIL
SERVICE REFORM RECOM
MENDED.
Always fjivi.'ing p a-!tic.il re'orms,
I respectfully direct y u; attention to
one abuse of I0U4 bian l.ng vh:c'i I
would like to see re nowd lv this
Congress. It is a re.'orm in t! c Civil
Service of iUi country. I would have
it go beyond the mere fixing of the
tenure of offia of clerks and employ
ees, who do not require the advice
and consent of the Senate to make
their appointments complete. I would
have it govern not the tenure but the
manner of making all appointments.
There is no duty which so much em
barrasses the extcutive and heads of
departments as that of appointments,
nor is there any such' arduous or
thankless labor imposed on Senators
and Representatives jis that of finding
places for constituents The rrjscnt
system does not secure the best men,
and often not even fit men for public
places. The elevation and purifica
tion of the civil service of the Gov
ernment will ba hailed with approval
by the whole people of the United
Stales.
This, coming frrm Mr. Grant, so
soon after the removal of Secretary
Cox, for attempting to shield his
clerks against the downright robbery
of political mountobanks and scoun
drels.Js decidedly rich. It i3 enough
to make every thoughtful American
citizen blush with shame. 0
We notice, that bills have already
been introduced in' the Senate and
House, affixing severe penalties, to
prevent the extortion, yearly prac
ticed upon illy compensated clerks
and government employees in Wash
ington Let it como quickly ; and
let the thieves be scourged from the
Federal Capital.
