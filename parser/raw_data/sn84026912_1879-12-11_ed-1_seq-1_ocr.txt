PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Tho President congratulates Congress on
tho successful execution of thc Resumption
Act. The demand upon tho treasury tor
gold and silver in Rxchungo for United
States notes has been comparatively small,
and thc voluntary deposit ot' coin and bul
lion in exchange for notes lias been very
i largo. Tho excess of thc precious metals
j deposited or exchanged for United State.-;
I notes over the amount of United States
notes redeemed is about forty million
do Ins. Ho refers to thc consequent
rcviv d of trade, at ti stijs th t thc incom
ing loreign demand for our manufactu
ring and agricultural products baa caused a
large balanco of trudo in our favor which
has been paid in gold, (rom thc first of
.July hist to November l?tti, to the amount
of $09,000,000. Since tho rcKumpticu of
specie payments there baa also been a
marked and gratifying improvement ol' the
public credit. Tho bonds of tho go\cr?
ment bearing only per cent, interest have
bein sold at or above par sufficient in
amount lo pay elf tho National debt
which wis redeemable under thc present
laws.
Thc amount of interest saved annually
by the process ol refunding thc debt since
March 1st, 1877, is 814,207,177. Thc
bonds sold were largi ly in small sums, and
thc number of our citizens now holding tho
public securities is much greater than over
before. The amount of the Nation; 1 debt
which matures within less than two years
is 0102,121,700, of which ?500:U?U,O??
bears in totes t at the Vole of livo per cent.,
thc balance is in bonds boning G per cent,
interest, lt is believed that this part of
thc public debt can bc refunded by the
issue of ? per cent, bonds, and by tho re
duction of interest whioh will thus be
effected about $11,000,000 can bc annually
saved to ibo treasury. To se? ure this im
portant roduotiou of interest to bc paid by
thc United States further legislation is
required, whioh it is hoped will bo provided
by Congress during its present session,
THE 001.1.? AND SILVER QUESTION.
Thc coinage cf gold by tho mints of thc
United Stales during the last fiscal year
was $-10,980,012. Tho coinage of silver
dollars ?duce thc passage of tho act for that
purposo up to November 1st, 187!), was
8l5,000,8f>0, of which 812,700,811 have
been issued from thc treasury and arc now
in circulation, and 8<J2,800,50l> arc still in
thc possession of tho government. Tho
pendency of thc proposition for unity of
j action between the United States and thc
I principal commercial nations of Lurope to
j effeot a permanent system for tho equality
i of gold and silver in thc recognized money
Of tho World leads mc to recommend that
J Congress refrain from new legislation on
tho general subject. Tito great revival of
j trade, internal and foreign, will supply,
during thc coming year, its own instruc
tions, which moy well bc awaited before
attempting further experimental mcusurcH
with thc coinage. I would, however,
strongly urge upon Congress thc importance
of authorizing thc Secretary of thc Treasury
to suspend thc coinogo of silver dollars.
Upon thc present legal rates thc market
value of tho silver dollar being uniformly
! and largely lesa than thc market value of
I tho gold dollar, ic is obviously iinpracticu
? bio to maintain them at par with each other
I if both aro coined without limit. If tho
j cheaper coin is forced into circulation it
will bo reined without limit, soon
becomo tho ?ole standard of value
I and thus defeat thc desired object, which ia
j a currency nf betti gold and silver, which
] shall bc of equivalent value, dollar for
j dollar, with thc universally recognized
i money of tho world.
UHKKNltACKS SUOUi.l) UK WITHDltAWN.
Thc remo from ch eolation of United
? States notes wuh thc capacity of legal tender
in pr?valo contracts is a step to bc taken in
our progress toward a safe and stable cur
rency wilie! should be accepted us thc
i policy und duty of tho government und thc
i interest and security of thc people, lt is
my firm conviotion that tho issue of legal
I tender paper money, based wholly upou tho
authority and credit of tho government,
oxoept in au extremo omergency, ia without
Warrant in the Constitution sud a violation
of sound financial principles. Thc issuo of
United States notes during tho late civil
war with tho capacity of legal tender bei
tween private individuals was not author
izod except as n means of rescuing thc
country from imminent peril. Tho circu
lation of those notes as lt paper money for
any pro ti acted period of timo altor thc
accomplishment of this purposo wus not
contemplated by the framers of thc law
under which they were issued. They an
ticipated thc redemption and withdrawal of
these notes at thc earliest practicable period
consistent with the attainment of the object
for which they were provided. Tho policy
of thc United States, steadily adhered to
from the adoption of thc Constitution, has
been to avoid thc creation of a National
debt, and when from necessity in thc ti:;;cs
of war debts have boen created they have
been paid off on the return of peaco ns
rapidly as possible. With this view, und
for this purposo it is recommended that the
existing laws for tho accumulation of ii
sinking fund sufficient to extinguish lh(
public debt within ti limited period bc
maintained.
UKSTOlli: THU TAX ON TKA AND COFFKi:
If any change of tho objecta or r iles o
taxation is deemed necessary by Congress
it is suggested that experience hos showi
thal a du'y can lc placed, on tea and collei
which will not enhance tho price of thosi
articles lo Ibo commuer, and which will nd<
several millions of dollars annually to tin

On thc subject of civil service rofe

i fuller information upon tho subject,
accordingly requested tho chairman of tho
civil servicecommission to make a thorough
investigation for this purpose. Tho result
has been au elab?ralo und comprehensivo
?'r?port. Tho report sets forth tho history
of tho partisuu spoils system in (J rcat Britain,
of thc rise and fall of parliamentary patro

A largo and responsible part of the duty ol'

XIIK APPROXIMATION l'Oit JUDICiAli BX- 1
1? KN.si: H,
which has heretofore becu mudo for tho
department of justice in gross, was subdi
vided ut tho last session of Congress, and
uo appropriation whatever was made
for thepayuicnt of tho ices of inur
shahs and their deputies either in thc |
eer.ieo of process or for tho dir-pharge of |
other duties, and since dune 30th theso I
officers havo continued the performauoo of
their duties without compensation from thc
government, taking upon themselves tho
necessary ii.eidculul outlays, ns well an
rctideriug their own services, in only o
few unavoidable instances has tho proper
execution of tho process ol' thc
United States failed by reason of thc
ubi'cnco of requisite appropriation. This
course of official conduct on tho part of
these ofijeera, highly creditable to their
fidelity, was advised by the Attorney Gene
ral, who informed them, however, that they
would necessarily' have tu rely fur their
compensation upon tho prospect of future !
legislation by Congress. 1 therefore es
pecially rooommond that ?inmediato appro
priation bc made by Congress for this pur*
pose. Tho act making the principal appro
priation for tho department of justice at
previous sessions has uniformly contained
tho following clause: And for defraying thc
expenses which may bo incurred i:i the
enforcement of this act, approved february
2S, 1?7S, cutitled un act to amend
nu act approved May 80, 1370, end
tied ?:i act to cnforco tho r'ght of chi
liens ot* thc United States, mid for other
purposes, or tiny acts amendatory thereof or
supplementary thereto. No appropriation
w:.s mode for this purpose for thc current
year. As nu general election of Congress
occurred the omission wa a matter ol little
importance. Snob election will, however,
take place during tho eusuiug year, und thc
appropriation made for the pay of marshals
and deputies should bc sufficient to embrace
00uipcn3ution for tho Service they may ba
required to perform nt such election.
On the topic of the delayed business in
tho United States Supremo Court, tho
President ?aya; In the courts of many of tho
circuits also tho business lus increased to
such uti estent that thc delay of justice will
cal! tho attention ol' Congress to an appro
priate remedy. Thc remedy suggested hy
Attorney General is thc appoint nient of
additional Circuit Judges, and the creation
of nu intermediate court of errors and
appeal.], which shall relievo thc Supremo
Court of a part of its jurisdiction; while u
Iorgo force is also obtained for the perfoin
nnco of circuit duties. I commend this
suggestion to tho consideration ol' Congress.
It would seem to afford u complete remedy,
and would involve, if ten additional Circuit
Judges are appointed, un expenditure, at
tho present, rato of salaries, of not more
than sixty thousand dollars per year, which
would certainly bc small in comparison with
the objects to be attained.
Thc President reviews his recommenda
tions in former mossnges in favor of enlarg
ing the facilites ol' thc department of agri
culture, and says that, tho results already
accomplished, with thc very limited means
heretofore placed ut thc command of thc:
department ul' ngricullnro, ia nu earnest ol'
what may bo expected with increased ap
propriations for tho several purposes indi
cated in the report of thc commissioner,
with a view to placing the department on a
footing which will enable it to prosecute
more effectively thc objects for which it is
established. These requirements will not
involve any expenditure of moucy that the
country cannot, with propriety, now under
take in the interest of agriculture.
Tho President urger. Congress to consider
the subject of a fireproof building for n
Congressional library for which the necessity
is pressing,
On the subject of the Washington monu
ment nt Washington, the President says
already thc strengthening of tho foundation
has so fur progressed as to insure the ontirt
success ol'that part of tho work; n massivt
layer of masonry bab been introduced below
thc original foundation, widening tho bast
und rendering it possible to carry tho shnfi

From Columbia.
COLUMBIA, December 1.-Xo busincs
of importance was transacted to d:>y i
cither tho 1 louse or the Senate, but thcr
was a spirited debate in tho House upon th
bill creating school districts and authors
ing a special levy for school purposes.
J ustice Willard desires mc to say tba
his sense oi duty leads bini to maintain hi
views of tho constitutional rights of hi
office, becauso tho election ol' Chief Justio
in this State has always been conduele
independently of tho interests of politician
und only upon considerations of what \vj
duo to tho administration of jus!iee; an
ho wa3 not willing that his administrado
'should bo signalized by a departure frot
this henltliy practice.
The bill "lo provide for tho establisl
nient of nev/ school districts in tho sever;
cities and towns and incorporated viilagi
of tho State, mid to authorize tho levy au
oolleotion of special taxes therein," wi
then taken up.
Mr. Karlo, of Sumter, moved to elril
out tho enacting clause.
Mr. Bacon defended tho bill nt som
length, stating that it had been ca ru full
propared, wit!) tho approval of tho Superb
tondent of Kdttoation. lt was slryi'nr I
thc acts ?ow ia force in many States of
this Union und in Europe, und hud ulwjys
proved to bo a blessing to nil classes, sud
.'specially to the puorcr oucs. Ho denied
that it imposed au onerous local taxation,
iud burdening of tho peoplo being prohib
tcd by tho terms of tho bill itself. It was
lcoigncd merely to supplement tho present
auto ?nd insuflioiont school syst o tn by allow
ng citizens of such towns, cities and, vii
ages ns saw lit to lmprovo their cducotional
idvantugcs by taxing themselves for tho
jcnciit of their children-especially tho
ihildrcn of thc poor.
Mr, E ulo opposed tho bUJ. Whilo it
ivas not identical with thc somewhat s??iilar
jill of tho Radical rcgimo, it would, ho
thought, bo found equally odious. He op
posed tho delegation of thc power of taxa
;iou by thc Legislature, which should os-*
?.unie thc responsibility of increasing tho
uxalion if necessary. Tho bill gaye tho
lower cf making snap judgments to a few
nen in each town or city, who could get
ogethcr und impuse onerous taxation upon
ho remaining people of tho district who
.sight, and probably would, bo utscnt. Ho
lid not Oppose education of thc people, but
?bjccled to tilia system. It provided that
my citi.'.co returning real or personal pro
