The President's Message.
We have received the President's
Message, but do not propose to tax
the patience of our renders with an
invitation to read it. Grant's short,
oracular sayings h a v e become
somewhat proverbial for stupidity.
If we imagine them lengthened out
into a half dozen newspaper col
umns, with an increase of stupidity
at every step, a very good idea of
the message can be formed. Wheth
er Mr. Grant himself wrote it, or
whether its incubation is due to
the brain of the "venerable sar
dine who presides over the State
department,' as Don Piatt would
say, is a question of very little mo
ment, because the people have al
ready learned that it is a very dif
ficult matter to decide whether
Grant or his premier is entitled to
the palm for stupidity. '
The Message is taken up with a
rehearsal of liadical platitudes on
subjects that have long since beern
exploded, and Radical promises
that will never b; fulfilled. It is1
the weakest document that ever
emanated from the Executive de
partment. No wonder that, as the
telegraph says, it produced no im
pression in either this country or
in Europe.
' Weather, the past week, has va
ried somewhat from its lbng beautiful
path. We have experienced about 48
hours real mean and ugly weather,
with rain and wind. But since this
bad spell all is righted again, and we
now enjoy another course of lovely
weather.
The river is still low and falling, nav
igation at the mouth still bad, shutting
out our fine Packets. Cotton, sugar
and molasses have poured into Town
and Pineville. Every Warehouse is
crowded, at least, while we write.
The Lulu D., specially chartered by
Captains Ilaberle and Hienn, came up
Sunday night, put out her up freight
here and loaded entirely here. This
was very considerate and a great relief
to shippers. The Rapides, going down
this evening, will make a clean sweep
of the balance.

NEW SENATORS.
The Legislature of North Caro
lina has elected HIon. Z. B. Vance,
U. S. Senator for six years in place
of the carpet-bagger Abbott. Gov
ernor Vance is oue of the ablest
n.en in a State that has ever been
proverbially prolific in able jurists
and Statesmen. He is one of the
most popular and effective speak
ers in the South, and cannot fail to
take a high stand in the Senate.
As Governor Vance gave all the
aid and comfort he was able to the
rebellion, some of the truly loyal
are already setting up a howl and
calling for his rejection when he
presents himself at the bar of the
Senate. On the other hand Mr.
Greeley, who has become disgust
ed at the course of the North Car
olina Radicals, which he thinks
cost them the State, is equally
postive that he, and all like him,
must be admitted.
The regenerated State of Ala
bama has been equally happy in
securing a good Democratic Sena
tor in place of the Yankee WVainer
The next Senator is Judge Gold
thwaite, an old and highly esteemed
citizen of the city of Montgomery.
He has been Judge of the Circuit
and Supreme Courts of the State
and has a high reputation as aju.
rist but iscomparatively unknown
in politics outside of the State.
There was much rejoicing in Dem
ocratic and Conservative circles
over his election, and his friends
claim that he will do honor to the
State which has elevated him.
It is said that West Virginia,
now thoroughly Democratic, will
elect Hon. Charles James Faulkner
to succeed Senator Willey. Mr.
Faulkner was, for many years, an
able member of Congress from Vir
ginia and U. S. Minister to France
at the time of Secession. As he
had the honor of incarceration in a
Federal Fort for treason, the same
objection will probably be urged
against his admission as against
that of Governor Vance. He has,
however, too much ability and hon
esty not to call forth an earnest ap
peal from Mr. Greeley in his behalf.
We are pleased to see that the
D)emocrats in the Southern States
are determined to give. as in times
past, the offices to those best qual
ified to fill them. The Radicals,
however, do not seem to improve
on their old plan. Robertson has
just been re-elected from South
Carolina, and we doubt not some
one equally as incapable will get
Harris' seat from Louisiana.
New Orleans Market.
CoTrro-The sales to-day summed
up 6300 bales at irregular prices, which
were firm before the receipt of the 3:15

any change in quotations, as follows:

14bc. and 14tc. Middling as low as 141e
and in an exceptional case at 14fe.,
and Strict Middling in exceptional
cases under 15e. Towards the close
there was manifestly more anxiety
among falctors to realize, and none but
strong descriptions of Middling and
Strict Middling would have commanad

heaviest yet reported--had a depress

grams from New York.

AfMr. 0. . Hawley, Alexandria :
DEAn Sit--The reason I wrote you
the letter that appeared in the Lou
isiana Democrat, about the testimony
referred to in that letter, I had re
quested a lawyer, who is .familiar
with the office and its contents, to
read the testimony for a particular
purpose. He stated to me after
wards, that he had examined all the
suits in which the name "Wells" is
connected and could not find said
testimony. I have no doubt it was
taken out, and has been returned.
My offer of a reward upon convic
tion of the thief, induced its return.
I will give you the name of the law

INFxIDLITY.-"The truth of Chris
tianity," says Dr. Chalmers, "is neither
more nor less than the truth of certain
facts that have been handed down to
us by the testimony of reporters. Let
the historical evidences on which it
rests be made to pass in review, and
become the subject of sober inductive
examination: let the question be deci
ded by a patient and fair inquiry;
let the enemies of our faith show the
world that their infidelity rests on
higher grounds than a stale invective
against the jugglery of priests, or the
impertinence of a flippant witticism;
let them bring along with them the
spirit of cool and candid reflection, an
anxiety after truth, and a ready sub
mission to evidence. How little do
they think, as they strut along in the
pride of their infidel philosophy, how
little of the spirit and temper of true
philosophy is in them--of the humble,
cautions spirit which Bacon taught, and
on which Newton rests the immortali
ty of his genius ! There is a puppyism
in infidelity for which I have no pa
tience. I thought that now-a-days
both gentlemen and philosophers
would have been ashamed of it! At the
commencement of the last century,
one had some credit in sporting the
language of unbelief and infidelity; for
they were s upported by the counte
nance of Shaftsbury and Bolingbroke,
who in addition to their being peers of
the realm, had a sufficient acquain
tance with their mother-tongue. But
infidelity, like every other fashion, has
had its day; and since the masterly
and triumphant defences of our En
glish divines, it has been generally
abandoned by the superior and more
enlightened classes of society, and to
use the words of an Oxford professor,
"is now rarely to be heard but in the
language of blackguards."
t By special request of the young
men composing the Dramatic Associa
tion, we publish the following article
from the Rapides Gazette:
We learn that it is the intention of
the Dramatics to give a series of first
class legitimate Dramatic entertain
ments, if the public will give them suf
ficient encouragement by coming to
see them. They certainly deserve,
from their past performances, the beat
wishes of our citizens who are fond of
pleasusl and amusement. It is their
Intention to pui upon the "boards"
and perform the best legitimate Como
dies, in three and five acts, that have
ever been written. Particular and
careful attention will be given, both by
the Manager and Stage Manager, tosee
that every piece put upon the stage, is
properly "mounted" and worthy to be
witnessed by the most fastidions.-
They will shortly produce the beautiful
Comedy, in three acts, entitled "The
People's Lawyer," written by. Ameri
ca's greatest Comedian, Douglass Ger
rold. This Comedy was performed at
the Broadway Theatre, New York, two
hundred and ten nights consecutively.
It is moral, amusing and instructive.
Every one should see it, both old and
young. The performance will conclude
with an amusing Farce, never before
played in Alexandria. Due notice of
the same will be given, also the date.

STORY OF THE YOUNG LADY WHO WENT
To CALIFORNIA TO MARRY A MAN
WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN-TBE
ROMANCE OF STERN FACTS.
The following, from the Sacramento
(Cal.) Bee, probably refers to a yonng
lady from this vicinity who, as we know
recently went to California for the
purpose of being married to a gentle
man whom site had never seen, and
who was known to her only through
the report of friends and a photograph
We. hope the bride will never have
cause to hate the bridegroom:-
An incident came to our knowledge
a few days ago which may. strike our
readers as being quite romantic in its
way : When condnctor-- ,o one of
tihe Central Pacific trains, took charge
of his train at Truckee, bound for this
city, one day last week, he noticed
among the pIassengers a very pretty,
nmodeast-appeariug young lady, lwho
sweemed to be traveling alone. As the
cars cimbed the mountain, whirled
through gorge and around precipice,
site sat at one of the windows and
gazed out with an anxious look, as
thought she longed to reac; the shore
of the Pacific, where site might meet
with friends or relatives. While pass
ing through, the conductor thought he
heard some one address him, anti on
looking around discovered that it was
hias vovng female passenger, who, with
at bashful air, inquired if he was going
through to Sacramemnto. On Iteing
tinswered that hlie was, site blushed still
deeper, and said that she had riather a
queer request to make of. him. She
said site expected to meet at "the Junc
tion" a gjtleman whomn site had tnever
seen, but to whom she was about to be
manrried, and reqitested the conductor
to watch for himi and to introduce him
tot her if lie should find him. For soine
two years they had been ill correslon
deuce with one another-how it was
brought about she did not say-and it
was ttially vrranged that she should
comee to Calitornia and that her nn
known friend should at once lead her
to the altar. On sped the train through
tuInne'ls and snowdritts and over yaw
ning gulfs, but the soon-to-be bride
neither thought of danger nor of the
beauties and grandeur of the Sierras;
she sat still and gazed wistfully down
into the valley where the muddly S:e
ramento was winding its crooked way
toward -the ocean, and where she
hoped soon to meet her mystierious
lover. Station after stationt a s
reached, anid finally "the Junction"
cantne in sight. Tile conductor stationed
himself ont the ploltftrmt of the front car
mtid scanned the crowd that thronged
about as the train neared the depot.
A well dressed, gentlemanly-looking
individual stepped forward upon the
plntform. He too, wore a somtewhat
anxious look, and he concluded lie had
found his man. A tap on the shoulder
and low inquiry by him and a quick
eager response fromn the stranger ful
lowed; the conductor was right. The
train moved on and they entered the
ear. The tetting of the lovers we
shall not tttenmpt to describe, but will
leave each of oult readers--esplecially
the young ladies-to draw such pie
tutre as they miay think the circuns
stnuce will warrant. Fromo- the Junc
tion" to the city weihave no aeccount;
the two fond beings were unmuolested.
A few motments after the train reached
this city a carriage drove away from
the depot cotitaining two persons, a
getletteman and lady, whom the conduc
tor "tcoginized as Ilis young lady pas
sanger ant. t!:! gentletman. who muet Iher
at "'the Junction." The latter' whis
pered to the driver to go strnailit to the
iouse of 1Rev. Mr. - , and they were
lost to view. We read of such things
in works of fiction, but it is seldoln
that they actually happen.-[lRochester
Chronicle Nov. 14.
WHAT Is MAS ?--What is man?
Nothing, I cannot compare him to
anything. Science teaches us that in
6,300 years more a grand deluge will
end his race and make him a fossil
You think this an idle tale, bat it is
not. Astronomy shows that the earth
is oscillating in the angle of its axes to
the sun in periods of21.000years. The
zones are undergoinga constant change
Now, at the North Pole it is growing
colder each year, and at the South Pole i
warmer. Thus an immense accumula
tion of glaciers or icebergs at the North
Pole will result, while at the South
they will not form at all. In 6,300
years the glaciers will have accumula
ted so much that it will suddenly over
balance the earth. Then the waters
of the sea will ·raush from the South to
the North, and there will be a deluge.
The last deluge of which we have a
tradition was produced in this manner,
only the conditions-were reversed- the
South Pole becoming the heaviest.
Formerly the poles were the equator;
now it is reversed. The same reverse
will occur again and a new formation
of land and water will result. I men
tion these facts to show the insignifi
cance ofman.-[A Frbnch Scientist.
WHAT CONSTITTES IHELL.-Mr. Nor
man Maclend is accredited with the
following: Let tie fairest star be se;
lected, like the beauteous island in the
vast and shoreless sea of the azure
heavens, as the fature home of the
criminals from the earth, and let them
posea what they moseet love, and all
that it is possible for God to bestow ;
let them be endowed with undying
bodies, and with minds which shall
ever retain their intellectual powers;
let no Saviour ever press his claims
upon them, no God reveal himself to
them, PQ Sahbbauth ever dawn upon
them, no sp.nt ever live among theim,
no prayer ever be heard-within their
border, let society exist forever,
smitten only by the leprosy of hatred
to God, and with atter radishness as
its all pervading andeternal appirpe=-
then, as sure asthe law of rghteous
ness exists, on which rest the trone of
God andthe' government of the ani
verse, as society so constituted must
work fpr itself a hell of solitary and
bitter suffering, to which there is spo
limit except the capaseIty ofa finite na
ture; alaes! the spirit that is without
love to its God or its neighbor, is
already possessed by a power which

and a fire that can never more be
quenched.

It is easier to be a good business man
than a poor one. Half the energy dis
played in keeping ahead that is vequir
ed to catch up when behind will save
credit, give more time to business, and
add to the profit and reputation of your
work. Honor your engagements. If
you promise to meet a man, or do a cer
tain thing at a certain moment, berea
dy at the appointed time. If you go
out on business, attend promptly to the
matter on hand, apd then as promptly
go about your own business. Do not
stop to tell stories in business hours.
If you have a place of business, be
found there when wanted. No man
can get rich by sitting around stores
and saloons. Never "foo'" on business
matters. If you have to labor for a
livi g, remember that one hour in the
morning is better than two at night.
If youn employ others, beoon hand to see
that they attend to their duties, and to
direct with regularity, promptness and
liberality. Do not meddle with any
business you know nothing of. Never
buy a thing simply because the man
that sells will take it out in trade.
Trade is money. Time is money. A
good business is pleasant and attract
ive; then stay where to wait on cus
tomners.
Never use quick words, or allow
yourself to make hasty or ungentle
manly remarks to those in your em
ploy, for to do so lesoens their respect
for you and your influence over them.
Help yourself and others will help you.
Be faithful over interests confided to
your keeping, and all in good time
your responsibilities will be increased.
Do not be in too great haste to getrich.
Do not build until ypn have arranged
and laid a good foundation. Do not
as you hope to work for success-spend
time in idleness. If your time is your
own, business will suffer if you do. If
it is given to another for pay, it be
longs to him, and you have no more
right to steal it than to steal money.
Be obliging. Strive to avoid harsh
words and personalities. Do not kick
every stone in the path; more miles
can be made a day by going steadily
on than by stopping to kick. Pay as
you go. A man of honor respects his
word as he does his bond. Ask, but
never beg. Help others when you eun,
but never give when you cannot afford
to, simply because it is fatshionable.
Learn to say no. No necessity for
snapping it out dog fashiii, but say it
firmly and respectfully. Have but few
confidants, and the fewer the better.-
Use your own brains rather than those
of others. Learn to think and act for
yourself. Be vigilant. Keep ahead
rather than behind the times. Young
man, cut this out; and if there is a fol
ly in the argument, let usknow.--[Ex

A TERRIBLE SCw.--I - Vacuna,

Texas and three~ew Orleans gamblers
were playing a game of poker, when a
quarrel arose between Joe Bigger, a
'exian, and Orestes Watrons, one of
the gamblers, which it was decided to
fght it out with bowie knives on
horseback. The combatants were di
rested of their coats. and shirts, and
their knives were bound to their right
hands. They were then 'placed sixty
yards apart, with ordere to ride at
ejtch other full speed, passing or. the
left side. Both were splendid horse=
men. Bigger wamnounted on a clean
limbed, fiery pony, a little over foiur
teen hands high, While Warrous rode
a large, "watch-eyed," vicious roan.
Eight times they hurled their horses
upon each other, and each time fearfal

the party badly wounded.
OLD NEWSPAPERS.-Many people
