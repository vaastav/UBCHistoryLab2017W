Olympia. Dec.3.—How. since
1905, when the state tax commis
sion was created, the burden of
taxation has shifted from the farm
ers and others so that the greater
proportion of the increase now falls j
upon the railroads, timber interests,
and public service corporations, is
l feature of the biennial report of
the tax commission, now being pre
pared for the printer.
J. E. Frost, of the commission,
has prepared the following, which
will be in the report:
In 1905 the total assessed value
of the taxable property in the state j
wa55328,542,525. it is now $906,-
--247,944, an increase in five years
of $577,705,419.
Five years ago the assessed value
of all real property was $244,089,-
--870;itis now $692,766,995, an in
crease of #448,677,085.
Steam railroads, then assessed at
$26,789,655, are now assessed at
$100,157,754, an increase of $73,-
--368,099.
Five Years ago there were
3,730,655 acres of inproved land in
the state. Unfortunaely under the
system of assessment then in vogue
bo attempt was made to separate
the value of improved from unim
proved lands, and it is consequent
ly impossible to arrive at its value.
There, are now, however, 6,173-
--688 acres of improved land within
the state, valued at $140,175,243,
or an average of $22.71 per acre.
Improvements on these lands are
assessed at an average of $3.49,
making the average assessed value
of farm lands, including the im
provements thereon. $26.20 per
acre. It is to be noted that 2,443-
--093 acres of raw land have been
placed in cultivation during the
put five years.
In 1905 town and city lots, with
improvements, were assessed $130-
--519,726; this year they stand at
$377,275,928, an increase of $246,-
--756,202.
In 1905 there were 18.747.997
teres of land, improved and unim
proved and including timber lands
etc, within the state, which includ
ing improvements, were assessed
•t $114,120,144, or an average of
$6.09 per acre. There are now 22-
--148,869 acres, assessed at $301,-
--563,856, or an average of $13.62
per acre.
There are no means of ascertain
ing the acreage of timbered land
for 1905, but from careful investi
gations made by the tax commis
sion it was found that it was as
•Msed at that time at an average of
$4.88 per acre. There are now 5,-
--628,666 acres returned as timber
•and, assessed at $76,470,056; or an
average of $13.59 per acre, an in
crease of $8.71 per acre over the
assessment of 1905.
At that tim; the taxable value of
Personal property in the state was
$57,663,000. It is now #113,323-
--195 an increaseof $55,662,195 and
in this connection it may be of in
terest to note that in 1905 there
wers 406,569 head of cattle in the
•tate, while at the present time
there are only 305,508, or a falling
•f 101,061 during the past five
years.
Five years ago there were 525,-
--770 sheep, while the returns for
the present years show only 359407
« a loss of 166,365. Un the cat
tle now returned 186,006 or approx
imately 69 per cent., milch cows.
The falling off in the number fo
jattle and sheep can be attributed
to the fact that the addition-

jal 2,443(065 acres of land put un

years Ims reduced pasturage to that!
(extent. In 1905 there were 210,-
--! 716 horses within the state, having
I an average value of $29.07. There
II are now 258,840 horses with an
average of $49.62. Of these, 154,-j
» 251, or approximately 60 per cent.
are work horses. Then the value
. of horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, etc.,
was $12,766,441; it is now $18,983-
--" | 433.
I At that time there were 26,179
'I pianos and organs valued at $1,760
11520; thtre are now 51.760 valued
,at $4,461,033. Then all hotise
t hold goods, office furniture, and.
| including jewelry, silver plate,
j books, organs, pianos, sewing ma
(chines, etc., were valued at $11,-
--.! 128.524. The same articles are
i now assessed at $26,283,885. Ag
ricultural tools, implements, m.r
, chinery, harness, etc.. were assess
ed in 1905 at $1,748,130; now at
; [#2,403,512. Goods, wares ami
merchandise in 1905 were returned
' at #15,800,934; now at #32,370,284
Manufactures were then valued at
#3,296,446: now at #13,167.180.
Bonds, stocks, shares, moneys of
banks, returned in 1905 at #5.215-
--199, are now assessed at #12,518.-
--140. The property of telegraph,
telephone, gas, water, electric
light, power, street, railway com
panies, etc., were assessed in 1905
at #5,924,577: they are now return
ed for taxation at $24,798,343.
It is to be noted that the great
est ihcrease in the assessed value
of personal property has fallen,
first upon the public service cor
porations, next, upon the property
of banks and bankers, followed by
goods, wares, merchandise, etc. In
1905 farmers' tools, implements,
machinery, live stock, etc., repre
sented 28 per cent of the total as
sessed value of all personal proper
ty, while it now constitutes but
18.8 per cent.
By analyzing the for going state
ment, it will be seen that the great
est ratio of increase in values have
been upon the operating property
of railroads, which shows an in
crease of 273.9 per cent.
City property follows, with an
increase of 189.1 per cent; next
comes timbered land, showing a
gain of 178.5 per cent. Unfortun
ately it is impossible to make any
comparison between the assessment j
of farm lands, but as the assess
ment of all lands, including timber
and other unimproved lands, im
proved lands and improvements,
there is shown an increase of 123.6
percent., while personal property
has increased but 96.5 per cent.
In connection with the personal
property assessment, attention is
directed to the fact that intangible
personal property assessed in 1905
is now exempt from taxation ami
is not included in the assessment of
1910, consequently the ratio of in
crease is not a true one.
These figures reveal the fact that
taxes have shifted, to a consider
able extent, from the property of
the farmer to public service cor
porations, city and other property.
Out of a total assessment of $906,'
247,944, $377,275,928 falls upon
city lots and improvements, $161,-
--696,853 upon steam railroads, $189-
--841,003 on timber and other unim
proved lands, $26,585,973 on tele
graph, telephone, gas, water, elec
tri. light, power, street railways,
ar.d other public service corpora
tions, and the remainder upon var
ious items of personal property. In
other words, city property repre
sents 41.6 per cent., farm lands
17. A per cent,, timber and other
uniaproved lands 15.4 per cent.,
steam railroads 11.1 per cent., oth

DAIRY BUTTER VS.
OLEOMARGARINE
The discussion given to the sub
ject of cost of living has directed
more or less attention to the federal
oleomargarine tax and the price of
butter. People who are in favor of
repealing the present oleomargarine
law have taken advantage of the
situation to loudly condemn as
! 'undemocratic and un-American
I this "burdensome tax on a purs,
wholesome and nutritious food
j products.''
j They conveniently forget to ex
plain that over per cent of the
oleomargarine put upon the market
is taxed at only one-fourth cent
per pound. They do not explain
that only that oleomargarine that
is artifically colored is taxed at ten
cents per pound.
Even if it were all taxed at ten
per pound it would have absolutely
I nothing to do with the price of but
ter after the latter reaches thirty
1 cents a pound retail. It costs a
; bout fourteen cents a pound to pro
duce the very best grade of oleo
margarine. Add to this a ten cent
tax and the cost of production
wotdd be twenty-four cent-. The
product cotdd be retailed at thirty
cents at a handsome profit to man
ufacturer and retailer.
Looking at the question from
any view point it is clearly seen j
! that the oleomargarine law has ab- '
Isolutely nothing to do with the
price of butter.
The dairy interests of the conn-!
try are not enjoying any benefit!
through oleomargarine legislation
except as the integrity of the in-j
dustry is maintained. In this
every honest citizen should feel a
keen interest. He should also un
derstand that the effort put forth
by the nanufacturers of cleomar
garineto secure legislation which it
will make it easy for men to com
mit fraud in selling cleomargarine
is not inspired by love for the poor
man who wants a cheap substitute
for butter.
The whole proposition may be
thus summed up; oleomargarine is
I now made to taste and smell some
thing like butter. The manufac
turers and a few retail dealers want
theprivilege of putting it upon the
market so that it will look like but
ter, thus making it easy to commit
j fraud.
Every good citizen should be in
terested in effective pure food leg
islation and the oleomargarine law
is just such legislation —no more,
!no less.

YAKIMA WILL GET
FUNDS FOR PROJECT
Washington, D. C. Dec. l —
Apportionment of $20,000,000 of
the reclamation fund among various
government projects will probably
be announced by President Taft in
a special message to congress next
week. As yet the President has
not had time to consider the report
of the board of army engineers, but
it was announced at the White
House today that he will transmit
this report to congress together
with a statement relative to this
action. Xo prior announcement is
expected. From reliable sources it
was learned that the Yakima project
in Washington will be adequately
recognized in the apportionment,
but there is danger that Oregon will
get nothing.
THE PRESIDENT
of a manufacturing concern recent
ly said to The Dawn man, as he
laid down a written order for a big
job of printing: "I could get that a
shade cheaper elsewhere, but I
like to deal with The Dawn. You
are always cheerful and good-na
tured —not common virtues among
printer>, according to my exper
ience."
