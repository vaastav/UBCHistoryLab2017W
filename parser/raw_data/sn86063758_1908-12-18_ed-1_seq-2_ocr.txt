PRESIDENT ATTACKS WORLD
Brands Editor Pulitzer as Villifier of
the Nation-Panama Canal Charges
Are Made the. Subject of a Special
Message to the Congress.
Washington. December 15.- Re
peated peals of laughter greeted the
reading of the opening paragraph of
the presiden'ts message to congress
on the Panama Canal charges today.
As the secretary read the statement
that le charges were "false in every
particular," Senator Bailey laughed
outright as he was passing along the
rear of the chamber to his seat. Other
senators on both sides of the chamber
joined with him, and when the read
er reached the statement that a state
nent in -a newspaper, which he men
tioned. would not be believed, there
was general merriment from both
sides of the chamber.
There was only a small number of
senators present when the reading
was begun and it was hurried through,
the papers accompanying the mes
sage not being read at all.
The message elicited the greatest
interest in the house of representa
tives. The members gave close at
tention during the reading of the do
eument, and there was a ripple of
laughter over the president's charae
terization of Joseph Pulitzer, pub
isher of the New York World. The
message, with its accompanying pa
pers was referred to a committee.
Accompanying the president's mes
sage was a large bundle of documents
bearing upon the trans.-r of the can
al property to the United States.
Many of these documents were in
French, without English translation.
There was nothing which showed di
rectly the persons who received the
$40,000,000 paid by the United Sta
tes, but there was included a list of
about 7,000 stockholders in the old
and new Panama Canal companies,
all of them citizens of France and of
the Colombian Republic. There was
not the name of a citizen of th-e Unit
ed States in the entire list.
Attack on Pulitzer.
"These stories," the president, in
his message, says "were first brought
to my attention as published in a pa
per in Indianapolis, called the News,
edited by Mr. Delavan Smith, The
stories were scurrilous and libelous
in character and false in every essen
- tial particular. Mr. Smith shelter.s
himself behind the excuse that he
merely accepted the statements which
had appeared in a paper published in
New York, the World, owned by Mr.
* Joseph Pulitzer. It is idle to say that
the known character of Mr. Pulitzer
and his newspaper are such that the
statements in that papei' will be be
lieved by. nobody; unfortunately,
thousands of persons are ill informed
in this respect and believe the state
ments they see in print, even though
they appear in a newspaper publish
ed by Mr. Pulitzer.''
Summarizing the etiarges made in
this 3onnection the president says:
"These statem-aents sometimes ap
peared in the editorials, sometimes in
the news columns, sometimes5 in the
shape of contributions from indivi
duals, either unknown or known to be
of bad character. They are false in
-every particular from beginning to
end. The wickedness of the slander
ers is only surpassed by their fatuity.
So utterly baseless are the stories,
that apparently they represenit in part
merely material collected for cam
paign purposes and in part stories
originally concocted with a view of
possible blackmail. The inventor of
the story about Mr. Charles P.' Taft,
for instance, evidently supposed that
at some period of th'e Panama pur
chase Idr. W. H. Taft was secretary
of war, whereas in reality Mr. W. H.
Taft never became secretary of war
until long after the whole transac
tion in %uestion had been closed. The
inventor of the story about Mr. Doug
glas Robinson had not taken the trou
ble to find out the fact that Mr. Rob
inson had not had the slightest con
nection, directly or indirectly, of any
kind or sort with any phase of the
Panama transaction frc>m beginning
to end. The men who attacked Mr.
Root in the matter had not taken the
trouble to read the public documents,
which would have informed them that
-Mr. Root had nothing to do with the
purchase, which was entirely arrang
ed through the department of jus
tice under then attorney general, Mr.
Knox.
No Investigation Needed.
"Now, the stories as a matter of
fact need no investigation whatever.
No shadow of proof has been or can
be produced in behalf of any of them.
They consist simply of a string of
infamous libels. In form they are in
part libels upon individuals, upon Mr.
Taft and Mr. Robinson, for instance.
But they are, in fact wholly, and in
form. party, a libel upon the United
St.ates government. I do not beliere
we should concern ourselves with the
particuar individuals who wrote the
from correspondents or articles in
the news columns. The real offender
is Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, editor . and
proprietor of the World. While the
criminal offence of which Mr. Pulit- I
zer has been guilty is in the form of
a libel upon individuals, the great in- 1
jury done is in blackening the good
name of the American people.* It
should not be left to a private citizen
to sue Mr. Pulitzer for libel. He t
should be prosecuted for libel by the
government authorities.
'1n point of encouragement of ini
quity, in point of infamy, of wrong
doing, there is nothing to choose be- E
tween a public servant who betrays
his trust, a public servant who is guil- t
ty of blackmail or theft or financial
dishonesty or any kind, and a man
guilty as Mr. Jos Pulitzer has been
,guilty in this instance. It is, there
fore, a high national duty to bring to t
justice this villifier of the American (
people, this man who wantonly and
wickedly and without one shadow of
justification seeks to blackmail the
character of reputable private citiz
ens and to convict the government of
his own country in the eyes of the ci
vilized world of wrong doing of the
basest and foulest kind, when he has
not one shadow of justification of
any sort or description for the charge
he has made. The attorney general i
has under consideration the form in
which the proceedings against Mr.
Pulitzer shall be brought."
The president cites the Act of con
gress by which he was authorized to
pay $40,000,000 for the canal proper- t
ty, and says it was no concern of the t
president what the new Panama Can
al Company did with the money.
Deal Made by Knox.
"The Panama Canal transaction i
was actually carried through, not by 1
eitehr the then secretary of State, T
Mr. John Hay, or the then secretary
of war, Mr. Elihu Root, both of whom t
however, were cognizant of all the -3- I
sential features, but the then attor- I
ney general, Mr. P. C. Knox, at pres- I
ent senator from Pennsylvania. 1 4
directed or approved every action,
and am responsible for all that was N
done in carrying out the will of the :
congress; and the provison of the law i
enacted by congress after exhaustive i
examination and discussion weie ra
pulously complied with by the exec.u-]
tive.''
The action of the government, he
says, was wholly uninflueneed by ainy
question of who were or were not
stockholders, either in the new or the
old company.
''If, as a matter of fact,'' he ex
plains, ''the canal companies, either
or both, had been owned by American
citizens or by citizens of any other
nationality, it would :iot have al.;r
ed in the slightest degree the acti n
taken by this government. Our con
cern was to get the canal property
which was owned by the French com.
pany, and to see that the title was
clear. Our transactions were carried
on openly, 'and were published in de
tail, and we dealt solely (so far as
the interests of the old Panama Comn
pany were concerned) with the liqui
dator appointed by the proper French
governmental body, the Civil Tribu
nal of the Seine.
Didn't Manage Distribution of Mon
ey. .
''I wish to make as clear as passi
ble, and as emphatic as possible, the
statement that we did not have any
thing to do with the distribution of a
dollar of the $40,000,000 we paid as
regards any stockholder or bon3.
holder of the French companies, save
that we followed out the award of the
arbitrater appointed in accordance
with the decree of the French court,
which had dealt with the subject in
awarding a certain proportion to t'ie
old comipany and a certain proportiP.1.:
to the new company.
''As a matter of fact, there is noth-]
ing whatever in .which .this govern
ment is interested to investigate abiat
this transaction. So far as this guv-:
ernent is concerned every step of' 4
the slightest importance has been i
made public by its 'executive, and e e
ery step taken in France has 'thiere
been made public by the proper of- 1
ficials.''
The president submitted with th'e
message what he said was a full list
of the stockholders of the new esmi
pany (numbering over 6,000) furnisi
ed by Mr. Cromwell, and other papers
corroborative of his message.
WORLD ANSWERS ROOSEVELT.1
"A Reckless, Unscrupulous Demago
gue," it Says-Refers to his
"Lamentable Habit of
Inaccurate State
ments."
INew York. December 15.--Th(
World. in the cours:e of its answver to
Piresident Roosevelt 's references .to
that paper, in his special message to
1anno1it muzzle the World.
"'While no amount of billinsgate
)n his part can alter our determina
:ion to treat him with judicial im
)artiality and scrupulous fairness;
ve repeat what we have already said,
hat the congress of the United States
;hould make a thorough investigation
)f the whole Panama transaction,
hat the full truth may be known to
he American people.
"The World fully appreciates the
ompliment paid to it by Roosevelt
n making it the subject of a special
nessage to the congress of the Unit
ad States.
"The World likewise appreciates I
he importance of Mr. Roosevelt's
tatement when he declares to the
ongress that the proprietor of the
Yorld should be prosecuted for libd
y the governmental authorities, and
hat 'the attorney general has under
onsideration the form under which
he proceedings against Mr. Pulizer
hall be brought.'
"This is the first time a presideat
ver asserted the doctrine of lese ma
este or proposed, in the absence of
pecific legislation, the critninal pro
ecution by the government of citiz
ns who criticised the conduct of tha
overnment or the conduct of indivi
luals who may have had business
lealings with the government. Neith
r the king of Great Britain nor the
rerman Emyeror would venture to
xrrogate such power to himself. John
Wams's attempt to enforce the sedi
ion law destroyed the Federalist par
y in America. Yet Mr. Roosevelt, in
he absence of law, officially propos
s to use all the power of the great
st government on earth to cripple
he freedom of the press on the pre
xt that the government itself has
een libelled-and he is the govern
nent.
"It is true that the World printed
he public repo-ts concerning the
anama canal affair which resulted
'rom William Nelson Cromwell's ap- I
)eal to the district attorney's office
luring the recent campaign to pre
rent the publication of a story which
vas said to be in the hands of the
)emocratik national committee. It
as Mr. Cromwell's own action which
-aised the issue in the campaign.
"It is true also that when Mr.
loosevelt made his attack upon Dela
an Smith the World called attention
o certain statements which Mr.
oosevelt must have known to be
~alse or misleading, and appealed to
~ongress to end all scandal by a full
md impartial investigation. If this
e treason, let Mr. Roosevelt matke
he most of it.
''Mr. Roosevelt's lamentable habit
>f inaccurate statements make it im
ossible to accept either his judg
nents or his conclusions. In his mes
age he does not state correctly even
o simple a matter as the pretended
sanses of his grievance. The World
2as never said that Charles P. Taft
mnd Douglas Robinson made any pro
its whatever. Mr. Taft denied that
ie was concerned in the transaction
.n any way, which denial the World
ublished and accepted. It would
2ave been equally glad to print Mr.
Robinson's denial could it have sue
~eeded in obtaining one frr,m him.v. as
t frequently attempted. The Wo;rld
ia no evidence -that he was associat
d with Mr. Cromwell, and would ac
:ept is word to that efhet, for Mr.
-binson is an est;imable gentleman
f hg~h character, whose reputation
r verr,eity is infinitti b;iter ihan
:iit of his distinguishe I. hotther-in
''If the World has libelled anybody
e hope it will be punished, but we
lo not iritend to be intimidated by
MIr. Roosevelt's threats or by Mr.
Roosevelt's denunciation, or by Mr.
oosevelt's power.
''No other living man ever so gross.
y libelled the United States as does
;his presi.dent, who besmirshes the
~ongres, bulldozes judges, assails the
ntegrity of courts, sla.nders private
~itizens, and who has shown himself
he most reckless, unscrupulous dema
rogue whom the American people ev
r trusted with great power and an
;hority.
'We say this not in anger, but in
~inere sorrow. The World has im
ieasurably more respect for the of
ice of president of the United States
than Theodore Rloosexelt has ever
;hown during the years in which he
1as maintained a reign of terror and
illified the honor and honesty of
>oth public officials and private eit
zens who opposed his policies or
;hwarted him in his purposes.
'So far as the World is concerned
.ts proprietor may go to jail, if Mr.
Roosevelt succeeds, as he thraatens;
ut even in jail the World will not
ease to be a fearless chan'pion of
free speech, a free press and a free
Teople. '
