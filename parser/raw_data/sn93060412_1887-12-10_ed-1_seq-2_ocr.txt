Puck seems to like Mr. Cleveland's
message. With Nast and Kepler ou
his. side the president will be invinci

manly and bold enunciation of a living
issue.

The London Times thinks that the

appears so, and thus far good has come
from the unfortunate Wilson episode.
The Register has been interviewing
Missouri republican editors on their
presidential preferences. It finds, up
to publication, 18 tor Lincolu; 7 for
Blaine; 9 for Sherman and 1 tor Har
rison. Mr. Blaine's reply is a bid for votes
io each industry affected by a reduction
ol tariff taxes, whether the proposed
reduction be fair or not, and no one
thing in it is a clearer appeal to preju
dice than what is said upon the whis
ky question. Mr. Blaine lends his aid
to the supreme court's encouragement
to prohibition. Well, welt, things are
shaping themselves up.
The total amount of lands restored
to the public domain since March 4,
85, is 31,821,489 acres, equal to the
area of the state of New York. Jn
addition to this 14,238,913 acres have
been recovered by the canceling ol
fraudulent entries, making an aggre
gate ot 45,C63,S91 acres iu all restored
iu the last three years. That is pretty
good lor the time mentioned.
The Register thinks that "There is
promise of fun in this congressional
.district. There has been fuu in this

does not object to seeing some more ol

as it did in 18S4 in mischief-making

uol a very high political ambition lor a
newspaper. It will hardly succeed this
time.
The city election at Atlanta, la
Wednesday, hinged upon the prohibi
tion question. The antis had out a
straight ticket, while the prohibitionists
ran a combination ticket. The election
was warmly contested aud resulted in
a decisive victory for the autis, their
average majority being about 1,000.
This gives the autis complete control ol
the city government. The commis
sioner of Fulton conuty has fixed the
wholesale licenses in the county at
91,00V per year. Their right to do so
js contested.
Mr. Wm. Briukley, a student si Wil
liam Jen el college, struck another
tudctit, Mr. Wm. Salmon, on the head
with a eiung shot, some days ago, in
dicting a wound which it is feared will
prove mortal. The entire difficulty is
au ugly one. The young man who is
injured is a son of Dr. Bajmon, of Clin
ton, with whom many of our people
who know and esteem him wili deeply
sympathize in the . accumulation
misfortunes which have overtaken him
in the last tew years.
The Post-Dispatch hits the tiaii
wjnarely on the head wheu it savs:
"There is not a word in the president
message that is not iu strict accord with
the promises of revenue reform in the
last republican platform. The message
is no more a 'free trade screed' than
were the reveuue reform planks iu the
platforms of both parties. It asks nolii
Jug, urges nothing. but what
both parties promised." And yet the
ultra protect iouists will continue to
denounce the message as a free trade
utterance just as much as though it
advocated au abrogation of (he entire
xUriff.
THE PEESIDEHT'S MESSAGE-
We have given up so much of our
space to-day to the president's message
that we have lelt ourselves but little
room to comment upon it. But it
speaks best for itself. It is short, and
full of interest from the first line to the
last. Contrary to the general custom
ot giving to the country & half dozeu
columns of platitudes, Mr. Cleveland
has devoted all of his message to a live
and pressing issue.
In treating it he takes strong demo
cratic ground. He shows, beyond
question or cavil, that a surplus existF,
and that this surplus must increase,
concluding upon this point in these
words: "While the expedients thus
employed to release to the people the
mouey lying idle iu the treasury served
to avert immediate danger, our sur
plus revenues have coutiuued to accu
mulate, the excess for the present year
amounting on the 1st day of December
to $55,258,701 19, and estimated to
reach the sum of $113,000,000 on the
80th day of June next, at which date
it is expected that this sum, added to
prior accumulations, will Bwell the sur
plus in the treasury to $14U,000,000.-'
lie also demonstrates, clearly and
unanswerably, the danger of putting
in the hands of the United States trea
sury the power to contract or expand
the currency ot the country.
Mr. Cleveland then clearly and for
cibly recommends a reduction ot re
venue by a reduction of tariff duties
where these can be made without in
jury to the manufacturing interests of
the country. Anticipating the usual
cry of "free trade" which is raised
whenever any reduction of federal tax
ation is proposed Mr. Cleveland says:
'Our progress toward a wise conclu
sion will not be improved by dwelling
upon the theories ot protection and free
trade. This savors too much of bandy
ing epithets. It is a condition which
confronts us not a theory. Relief
from this condition may involve a
slight reduction of the advantages
which we award our home produc
tions, but the eutire withdrawal of
such advantage should not be onleii -plated.
The question of free trade is
absolutely irrelevant, and the persistent
claims made in certalu quarters that
all efforts to relieve the people from
unjust aud nnuscessary taxatiou
are schemes of so-called free traders is
mischievous and far removed from any
consideration tor the public good."
Mr. Blaiue has already justified this
reproof, as have the thick-aud-thiu
protection newspapers, but the Chica
go Tribune, the second strongest jour
nal in the country which supports the
gentleman from Maine does not aree
with them. It says of the message:
"Full justification of President Cleve
land's unprecedented course in devot
ing his animal communication to con
gress exclusively to a consideration of
the surplus and the best means ot dis
tributing it, is to be found in the mes
sage itself The message is able and
statesmanlike, business like iu style,
perspicuous in statement, clear iu its
reasoning and irrefutable in its conclu
sions. The message rises above party
liues and presents a common basis of
patriotic statesmanship on which re
publicans and democrats are bound by
every consideration of the public wel
fare aud ot political expediency to
stand together. The position taken in
the previous cougress by the Minnesota
delegation and some other republicans
must be stoutly maintained uy me re
publican side of the bouse at this ses
sion, or they and perhaps the party
which tbey represent will be over
whelmed. The message is simply the
tariff reduction plank of the republi
can party, adopted in 1884, expanded.
It is neither more nor less tbau a textual
sermon on that passage ot the resolu
tions which promises to "reduce the
surplus by correcting the inequalities
ot the tariff," aud it is certainly none
the less binding ou the republicans for
being now so indorsed by a democratic ! Pel" seemed at uami. in these cir

The New York Herald, the leading i the interest accruing during the cur-
indeoeudent paper of the couutrv I
says: "The message will not please
extremists of either side, free trade or
protectionist. But it will, we believe,
please and satisfy the people at large,
and it puts upon both parties in con
gress the solemn duty to relieve the
country from a most serious danger "
And Mr. Randall, the leader ot the
few ultra-protection democrats iu con
gress disappoints the enemies of the
democratic part)', who would wreck
the fiuaucial interests of (he country to
injure it, by asserting that "a large re
duction wili also be made iu the rates
of duty on imports. There is certain
ly urgeut need for such revision of the
tariff as will remove its inequalities
and ambiguities, and so simplify it
generally as to prevent the abuses now
so prevalent and so hurtful to the hon
est trader. There can be such enlarge
ment ot the free list aud reductions iu
the dutiable schedules as will reduce
the revenue from customs--witbout the
least injury, however, to any of our
established and useful industries, auti
without lowering in the least the re
muneration now awarded to labor.

fully, calmly aud fairly.
The so-called crisis in French poli
tics has been very happiiy settled. Mr.
Grevy, ou last Friday, resigned tho
presidency, aud on Saturday Mr. Marie
F rancois Sadi-Carnot was ejected pres
ident by the congress without trouble
or difficulty. The prominent can;ii
titles were Ferry, de Freycinet and
Clemence&v. Mr. Sadi-Carnot was ac
cepted by all factions as a compromise
and elected by 618 votes out of 824.
Sadi-Carnot was a deputy irogi the
Cote d'Or. He is usually 'called Sal
Carnot, i;; order to distinguish him
from his falhei, Lagare Hippolyte (Jar-

at Limoges, August 11. Is37, and is Lie
grandson of the great Camot, the cele

of the republic.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Cotturc of the United Stales
You are confronted at. the threshold
of your legislative duties with a eon
ditiou ot t tie national finances which
iinnerativclv demands immediate and
careful consideration.
The amount ot money annually ex
acted through the operations ot present
laws from the industries and necessi
ties of tho neoole largely exceeds the
sum necessary to meet the expenses of
the government.
INDEFKNSIBLK KXTORTION.
When we consider that the theory of
our institutions guarantees to every
citizen tho mil enjoyment of all the
fruits of his industry ami enterprise,
with onlv such deduction as may be his
share toward tho careful and economi
cal maintenance of the government
which protects him. it is plain that the
exaction of more than this is indefensi
ble extortion, and a culpable betrayal
of American fairness and justice. This
wrong inflicted upon those who bear
the burden of national taxation, like
other wrongs, multiplies a brood of
evil consequences. The public treasury,
which should only exist as a conduit
conveying the people's tribute to its
legitimate otijecie oi expeiiuiuue, ue-
conies a hoarding-place for money need
lesslv withdrawn from trade and tho
people's use, thus crippling our nation
al energies, suspending our country's
development, preventing investment m
productive enterprises, threatening
financial disturbance and inviting
schemes of public plunder.
TKESAQINU FINANCIAL DISASTER.
This condition ot our treasury is not
altogether new, aud it has more than
once f late been submitted to the peo
pie's representatives iu the congress,
who alone can apply a remedy. And
yet the situation still continues, with
aL'trravated incidents, more than ever
presauriug financial convulsion and
wide-spread disaster.
It will not do to neglect this situa
tion because its dangers are not now
palpably imminent and apparent. They
exist none the less certainly, aud await
the unforeseen and unexpected occasion
wheu suddenly they will be precipilat
ed upon us.
EXCESS OV REVENUE.
OnthcSOih day of June, 1885, the
excess of revenues over public expen
ditures, after complying with the an
nual requirement of the sinking fund
act, was $17,859,735 84; daring the
year ended June 30, 1886, such excess
amounted to 19,405,545 20; aud dur
ing the year ended June 30, 1887, it
reached the sum of 855,567,849 64.
The annual contributions to the sink
ing fund during the three years above
specified, amounted m the aggregate to
S13S,05S,3i0 94 aud deducted from the
surplus as stated, were made by calling
in for that purpose outstanding 3 per
cent, bonds of the government
THK CALLS KOIl BONDS.
During the six mouths prior to June
30, 1887, the surplus reveuue had
grown so large by repeated accumula
tions that it was feared the withdrawal
of this great sum of money needed by
the people would so affect the business
of the country, that tho sum of $79,
864,100 of such surplus was applied to
the payment of the principal and inter
est of the 3 per cent, bonds still out
standing aud which were then payable
at the option of I he government. The
precarious condition of financial af
fairs among the people still needing re
lief, immediately after the 30th day of
June, 1887, the remainder of the 3 per
cent, bonds then outstanding, amount
ing with principal aud interest to the
sum of 18,877,500, were called in and
applied to the sinking-fund contribu
tion for the current fiscal year. Not
withstanding these operations of the
treasury department, representations
of distress in business circles not onlv
continued, but increased, and absolute
sinking fund for the current fiscal year
was at once completed by the expendi
ture of $26,684,28S 55 in the purchase
re,lt vear "P" .lue outstanding bonded
indebtedness of the government was to
some extent anticipated, ami banks se
lected as depositories of public money
were permitted to somewhat increase
their deposits.
A SURPLUS OF $140,000,000.
While the expedients thus employed,
to release to the people the money
lying idle in the treasury, served to
avert immediate danger, our surplus
revenues have continued to accumulate,
the excess for the present year amount
ing on the 1st day of December to $55,
258,701 19, and estimated to reach the
sum of $113,000,000 on the 30th day of
June next, at which date it is expected
that this sum, added to prior accumu
lations will swell the surplus in the
treasury to $140,000,000.
There seems to be no assurance that,
with such a withdrawal from use of the
people's circulating medium, our busi
ness community may not iu the near
future be subjected to the same distress
which was quite lately produced from
tiie same cause. And while the func
tions ot our national treasury should
be few and simple, and while its best
condition would be reached, I believe,
by its eutire disconnection with private
business interests, yet when, by a per
version of lie purpose, it idiy holds
money uselessly subtracted from the
channels ot trade, there seems to be
reason for the claim that soma legiii
mate means should be devised by the
government to re-lore in an emergen
cy, without waste or extravagance,
such mouey to its place among the peo
ple. f such au emergency arises there
now c?i.3(s nr dear aud undoubted ex
ecutive power of relief. Heretofore
the redemption ol 3 per cent, bonds,
which were payable at ilta option of
the government, has a'2on!ca a means
for the disbursement ol the excess oi j
our revenues; but these bonds have alt
been retired, and there are no bonds!

iu the treasury, il should be
borne iu mind that premiums must of
course be paid upon such purchase,
that there may be a large part of these
bonds held as investments which can
not be purchased at any price, and that j
combinations among tue notuurs who
are willing to sell may unreasonably
enhance the cost of such bonds to the
government.
It has been suggested that the present
bonded debt might be refunded at a
less rate of interest, and the difference
between the old and new security paid
in cash, thus finding use for the surplus
iu the treasury. The success of this
plan, it is apparent, must depend npou
the volition of tho holders of the pres
ent bonds; aud it is not entirely certain
that the inducement which must be
offered them would result in more
financial bcuefit.to the government than
the purchase of bonds, while the latter
proposition would reduce tho principle
of the debt by actual payment, instead
of extending it.
THIS TKEASUKf AND PRIVATE ENTER
PRISE. The proposition to deposit the money
held by the government iu banks
throughout the country for use by the
people is, it seems to me, exceedingly
objectionable iu principle, establishing
too close relationship bet een the op
erations of the government treasury
aud the business of the country, aud
too extensive a commingling of their
mouey, thus fostering au unnatural re
liance in private business upon public
funds. If this scheme should be adopt
ed it should only be done as a tempo
rary expedient to meet an uigeut neces
sity. Legislative and executive effort
should generally be in the opposite di
rection and should have a tendency to
divorce, as much aud as fast as can
safely be done.the treasury department
from private enterprise. Of course it
is not expected that unnecessary aim
extravagant appropriations will be
accumulation ot au excess of revenue.
Such expenditure, beside the demorali
zation of all just conceptions of public
duty which it entails, stimulates a habit
ot reckless improvidence not in the
least consistent with the mission of our
people or the high and beneficent pur
poses of our government.
(i RAVE FINANCIAL SITUATION.
I have deemed it my duty to
thus bring to the knowledge of my
countrymen, as well as to the attention
of their representatives charged with
the responsibility of legislative relief,
the gravity ot our financial situation.
The failure of the congress heretofore
to provide against the dangers which
it was quite evident the very nature of
the difficulty must necessarily produce,
caused a condition of financial distress
and apprehension since your last ad
journment which taxed to the utmost
all the authority and expedients within
executive control and these appear now
to be exhausted. If disaster results
from the continued inaction of con
gress the responsibility must rest where
it belongs.
THE CAUSE.
Though the situation thus far con
sidered is fraught with danger which
should be fully icalized, and though it !
presenis ieaiures oi wrongs io me peo-jiu tue diminution ot their compensa
ple as well as peril to the country, it is Hon. Nor can the worker in mauii
but a result growing out ol a perfectly ifactures fail to understand that whim
palpable and apparent cau-e,constantly
reproducing the same alarming circuui
stances a congested national treasury
aud depleted monetary condition iu the
business of the country, it need hard
ly be staled that while the present situ
ation demands a remedy, we can only
be saved from a like predicament in tho
future by the removal of its cause.

TARIFF RK-APJUSTMENT.
It is not proposed to entirely relieve
the country ol this taxation. ' il must
he extensively continued as the source
ol the government' income; and in a
re-adjustmeiil ol our taritr the inter
ests of American labor engaged in
manufacture should be carefully con
sidered, as well as the preservation of
our uiaii'ifact nres. It may be called
protection or by any other name, but
relief from tho banliih'ps snd dangers
of our present taritl laws, should be
devised with especial precaution against
imperilling the existence of our uiaiiu
taci tiring interests, lint this existence
should uol u;eau a condition which,
without regard to the public welfare or
a iiuliniiai exigency, must always in
sure the realization of immense- profits
instead of moderately profitable re
turns. As Ilia volume and diver.-itv ol
our national activities ;i!cre.se, new
recruits are added to those who desire
a continuation ol the advantages which
they conceive the present system of
tariff taxation directly affords them.

It is also said that the increase iu the
price ot domestic inanulaclitres result
ing from the pre.-enl tariff is necessary
iu order that higher wages may be paid
to our workingiuen employed in manu
factories than arc paid for what is call
ed the pauper labor of Europe. All
will acknowledge the force of argu
me n I which involves the welfare and
liberal compensation ot our labor.
Labor is honorable in the eves of every
American citizen; and as it lies at the
loundatiou of our development and
progress, it is entitled, without aflecta
lion or hypocrisy, to the utmost regard
Ihe standard ot our laborers' life
should not be measured by that of auv
other country less favored, and they
are entitled to their full share of all our
advantages.
PROTECTED WORKERS.
Dy the last census it is made to ap
pear that ot 17,392,009 of our popula
tion engaged in all kinds of industries,
7,670,493 are employed in agriculture,
t,U4,2Jts in professional and personal
service (2,934.870 of whom are domes
tic servants aud laborers), while
1,810,256 are employed iu trade and
transportation, and 3,827.112 are class.
ed us employed in manufacturing aud
mining.
For present purposes, however, the
last number given should be considera
bly reduced. Without attempting to
enumerate all, it will be conceded that
there should be deducted from those
which it includes $375,143 carpenters
ana joiners, zmj,4U1 milliners, dress
makers and seamstresses, 172,726
blacksmiths, lj.i,,li tailors and tail
oresses, 102,473 masons, 76,241 butch
! era, 41,309 bakers, 22,08:! pli:steicrs,and
;4,S91 engaged in manufacturing agri-
cultural implements, amounting iu the
aggregate to 1,214,023, leaving 2.623.-
0y persons employed in t-uch manu
facturing industries as are claimed to
be benefited by a high tariff.
To these the appeal is made to save
their employment and maintain their
wages by resisting a change. There
should be no disposition to answer
such suggestions by tire allegation that
they are in a minority among those
who labor, and therefore should torego
au advantage in the interest oi low
prices for the majority ; their compen
sation, as it may be affected by the
operation of tariff laws, should at all
times be scrupulously kept in view:
and yet with slight reflection they will
not overlook the fact that they are con
sumers with the rest; that they, too,
have their own wants and those of their
families to supply trom their earnings.
and that the prices of the necessaries
ot hie, as well as (he amount of their
wager.will regulate the measure of their
welfare and comfort.
But the reduction of taxatiou de
manded should be so measured as not
to necessitate or justify either the loss
ot employment by the workiiigman nor
the lessening of his wages; and the
profits utill remaining to the manufac
turer, alter a necessary re-adjustmeiil,
should furnish no excuse for the sacri
fice ot the interests of his employes

and material for use, its cost .s not
;only increased to the extent of the
'tanners' taritl profit, but a Itirther sum
has been added for the benefit .f Ihe
manufacturer under the operation of
other taritl laws. In the meantime
i the day arrives when the farmer finds
'it necessary lo purchase woolen goods
ami material to clothe himself aud fam
:ily for the winter. 'A'hen he faces the
tradesman lor that purpose he discov
ers that he is obliged nut only lo return
iu the way of increased prices his tariff
prolit on the wool he sold, and which
then lies before him in imiiniii'.ciiiied

Woman aiid clithi i; ti:: !?.!,", reasons
are suggesft'd why the removal cr ra-
ductiou o this dtdy should be included
iu a revision of our larifl law-
rtiLsis.
In siieakins; oi the i:u cased cost to
the consumer ol our h.-me oianii-'ac-Inres,
resulting from n ihity Kid upon
juipoitaut articles ol the eame dtsviip- i
lion, the fact is not overlooked that
competition among our domestic pro
ducers sometimes has the effect of
keeping the price of their piodncts he
low thu highest limit allowed by such
duly. But it is notorious that this
competition is too often strangled by
combinations quite prevalent at this
time, aud frequently called trusts,
which have for their olijeol the regula
tion of the supply and price of com
modities made and sold by members ot
the combination. Tho people can
hardly hope for any consideration in
the operation of these smlish schemes.
If, however, in the absence ot such
combination, a healthy and free com
petition reduces the prices of auy par
ticular dutiable article of home pro
duction below the limit which it might
otherwise reach under our tariff laws,
aud if, with such reduced price, its
manufacture continues to thrive, it is
entirely evident that one thing has
been discovered which should be care
fully scrutinized iu au effort to reduce
taxation.
MAINTAINING II IO II I'ltlCHS.
The necessity of combination to
maintain the price of any cominodity
to the tariff point furnishes proof that
some one is willing to accept lower
prices for such commodity, and that
such prices are remunerative; and low
er prices produced by competition
prove the same thing. Thus where
either ot these conditions exist, a case
would seem to be presented for an easy
reduction of taxation. The considera
tions which have been presented touch
ing our tariff laws are intended only
to enforce an earnest recommendation
that the surplus revenues of the gov
ernment be prevented by the reduction
ol our customs duties, and, at the same
time, to emphasize a suggestion that iu
accomplishing this purpose we may
discharge a double duty to our people
by granting to them a measure of re
lief from tariff taxation in quarters
where it is most needed and from
sources where it can be most fairly and
justly accorded.
OS THE APPEAL TO TUE SIANUKAC
TL'KKlt. Nor can the presentation made of
such considerations be with any degree
of fairness regarded as evidence of
unfriendliness toward our manufactur
ing inlercsts,orof any lack of apprecia
tion of t hoi r value aud importance.
These interests constitute a leading
and most substantial element ot our
national greatness and furnish the
proud proof of our country's progress.
But if, in the emergency that presses
npou us, our manufacturers are asked
(o surrender something tor the public
good to avert disaster, their patriotism
as well as a grateful recognition of ad
vantages already afforded, should lead
them to willing co-operation. No de
mand is made that they shall forego
all the benefits of governmental re
gard; but they cannot fail to be ad
monished ot their duty, as well as their
enlightened self-interest and safety,
w tie ii tuey are reminded ot the fact that
financial panic and collapse, to which
the present condition tends, aflord no
greater shelter or protection to our
manufactures than to our other impor
tant enterprises. Opportunity for sale.
careful aud deliberate reform is now
offered; aud none of us should be uu-
innidlul ot a time when an abused and
irritated people, heedless of those who
have resisted timely-aud reasonable re
lief, tnav insist upon a radical and
sweeping rectification ot their wrongs.
WISE AND FAIIS REVISION OF THE
TARIFF.
The difficulty attending a wiso aud
tan revision ol our tariff laws is not
under-estimated. It will require on
the part of the congress great labor and
care, and especially abroad and nation
al contemplation ot the subject, and a
patriotic disregard ot such local and
selfish claims as are unreasonable and
reckless of the welfare ot the entiro
couutrv.
SUBJECT TO I1UTV.
Under our present laws more than
4,000 articles are subject to duty. Many
of hese do not in any wav compete
with our own maiiiihielures, and many
are hardly worth attention as subjects
of revenue. A considerable reduction
can be made, iu the aggregate, by add
ing them to the free lisl. The taxatiou
of luxuries presenis no features of hard
ship; but the necessaries of life used
and consumed by all the people, the
duly upou which adds to the cost of
living in every home, should be greatly
cheapened.
RAW MATERIAL,
The radical reduction of Ihe duties
imposed upou raw material used iu
manufactures, or its free importation,
is ot course an important factor in anv
effort to reduce the price of these ne
cessaries. It would not onlv relieve
them from the increased cost caused bv
the tariff ou such material, but Ihe
manufactured product being thus
cheapened, that part of the tariff now
laid upon such product, as a compen
sation to our manufacturers for the
present price of raw material could be
accordingly modified. Such reduction
or free importation would serve beside
to largely reduce the revenue. It is
not apparent how such a change can
have any injurious ellect upon our
inanulacturers. On the contrary, il
would appear to give fhem a better
chance in lorcign markets with the
manufacturers of other countries, who
cheapen their wares by free material.
Thus our people might have the oppor
tunity of extending their sales beyond
the limits of home consumption sav
ing them from the depression, inter
ruption in business and loss caused by
a g ntted domestic market and afford
ing their employes more certain and
steady labor, with il resulting quiet
and contentment.
Li N N KCE A K ? II KV KM H .
The question thus imperatively pre
sented tor solution should be approach
ed iu a spirit higher than partisanship
and considered in the light of that rer
ard for patriotic duty which should
characterize ihe action of those entrust
ed with the weal ot a confiding people.
But the obligation to declared party
policy and principle is not wanting to
urge prompt and effective action. Both
of the great political parlies now rep
resented in the government have, by
repealed and authoritative declarations,
condemned Ihe condition of our laws
which permit, the collection fiom the
people of unnecessary revenue, and
have, iu Ihe most solemn manner,
promised its correction, and neither as
citizens nor partisans are our country
men iu a mood lo condone the deliber
ate violation of these pledges
A CONIUTIKN, NOT A TIlKoliV.
Our progress toward a wise conclu
sion will not be improved by dwelling
upon the theories ol protection and
free trad?. 'I his savor loo much id
bandying epithets. It is a ,'ONI UTION
which confronts us not a theory.
Belief from this condition may involve
a slight reduction of ihe advantages
which, we award our home productions,
but the entire withdra v at of such ad
vantages should not be contemplated.
The question ol free trade ia absolutely
irrelevant; and, Ihe persistent claim
made in certain quarters that all efforts
lo relieve the people from unjust ami un
necessary taxation are schemes of so
called free traders, is mischievous and
far removed from any consideration for
the public good.
KEIU'CE TAXATION.
