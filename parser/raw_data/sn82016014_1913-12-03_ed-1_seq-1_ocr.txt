FLY TO UNCLE SAM
Seven of Huerta's Generals
Headed for the Boundary
Where They Know They Will
Be Arrested on Crossing.
SMALL ARMY IS WITH THEM
Villa Will Try to Catch Them
Before They Cross.
Haerta's Power in Northern
Mexico Is About Ended.
Juarez, Mexico, Dec. 3. Confident
that the seven federal generals who
evacuated Chihuahua City with troops
intend to seek refuge in the United
States and thus be beyond danger of
being taken prisoners by the rebels,
General Francisco Villa today sent
more rebels to attempt to Intercept
them. The generals, led . by General
Salvadore Mercado, whose desertion
of Chihuahua and whose statements
that he had no money to pay his
troops are regarded as a virtual
breakdown of the Huerta dictatorship
so far as the north of Mexico Is con
cerned, are headed for OJinaga on the
border. It is thought they will cross
the river to Presidio. At Presidio
they are expected to be arrested by
the United States military authorities,
taken to Marfa and thence to San
Antonio. Their arrest on crossing the
river would follow as a matter of
course under a ruling of Secretary of
War Garrison.
With the generals are many subor
dinate officers, about 2,000 federal
regular soldiers and more than a
thousand people of the wealthier class
of Chihuahua, who took flight rather
than face an attack by the rebels.
General Pascual Orozco and General
Jose Ynez Salazzar, believed to be
with Mercado, are under indictment
returned in the federal court in El
Paso, Texas, for violation of the neu
trality law. Salazar Is out on bond,
but Orozco never was arrested.
Got the Start of Him.
Villa had little hope that his soldiers
would be able to overtake the federals
who left Chihuahua several days be
fore the fact of their flight became
known.
That Mercado, after handling the
portfolio of state to Fredericko Moye,
civil governor ad interim, should on
behalf of himself and subordinates of
fer to surrender and then fly to the
border, was regarded by Villa as an
unusual proceeding. '
"The only place they will surrender
will be in the U. S." said Villa, as he
eat at breakfast in his Juarez head
quarters today and patted an automa
tic revolver which lay among the
spoons and forks at his plate. Carlos
A. Heberlein of Los Angeles, who
came from Chihuahua with the peace
commission requesting Villa to occupy
the city said before the federals left,
the penitentiary had been emptied of
all the political prisoners.
Everything possible was done by
General Mercado to treat the citizens
humanely," said Heberlein.
"Patience, however, was worn out.
The people had been in a panic for so
long they could endure it no longer.
All the money had been withdrawn
from the city. The repeated defeats
of the federal troops, as they ven
4,.i rnrth nnd came back broken.
ji.nn,.r!iilng. There was no mon- I
ey to pay the troops and everybody
lost heart."
The Capital Is Moved.
Mexico City, Dec. 3. The seaport city
of Tampico was officially declared the
temporary capital of the state of Taraau
lipas today. General Antonio Rabago,
the military governor who was forced
to abandon Ciudad Victoria and who
was erroneously reported to have com
mitted suicide, has gone to Tampico
under orders from the federal govern
ment to re-establish his governorship
In the temporary capital. The war de
partment announced that General Arl
zomendi and other federal officers who
fled from Ciudad Victoria to Cerritos
In the state of San Luis Potosl had
been ordered to reorganize their forces
and to march again on Victoria.
This task had been entrusted at first
to General Rubio Navarrete, who re
treated to Monterey after his failure to
relieve the hard pressed garrison of
Victoria.

of the organization and equipment as
well as the long distance and broken
topography of the country the federal
government will find it difficult to han
dle Its various military expeditions
without trains now that the railroads
have been practically deprived of oil
fuel by the oil producing companies.
On some divisions of the railroad sys
tem coal may be used, and sufficient
supplies of that fuel are available to
operate trains for sometime, but at the
best it is probable that all traffic ex
cept military trains will be suspended
shortly.
Reliable News Scarce.
Reliable news as to the military op
erations in various parts of the repub
lic is very meagre in the federal capi
tal and what little there is does not
favor the government. Telegraphic
communication along the line of the
National railroad has been reestablish
ed but It is understood this has been
done with the consent of the rebels.
They are known to dominate the line
south of Saltlllo and to a point within
75 miles of San Luis Potosi.
A consular report received here
from Saltlllo shows that residents of
that city are still in ignorance of the
military operations in progress in the
surrounding country owing to the in
terrupted telegraphic communica
tions. Extraordinary methods are be
ing employed here to secure recruits
for the federal army. Servant girls
display marked caution when they ap
pear in streets as they are aware that
scores of their fellow servants have
been drafted into the army as female
soldiers.
Conscripting Recruits.
One trick utilized by the recruiting
diiicers iieneu ine xeaerai army 65
conscripts in a single haul yesterday.
The bills posted outside a moving pic
ture show announced that the exhibi
tion vap "for men only." The little
room was crowded some time before
the performance began. A series of
religious pictures was thrown on the
screen, the first being "The Virgin of
Guadalupe" patron saint of Mexico.
The crowd greeted this good natured
ly, but when It was followed by two
other religious pictures, the men who
had looked for a different kind of en
tertainment started an uproar. This
resulted in a raid by the police, who
marched off the majority of the men
to the barracks, where they were at
once placed In the ranks of the army.
Preparations for defense in case of
local disturbances are being con
tinued by the various foreign colonies
other than the American. Leaders of
the American colony are Inclined to
believe that any move in that direc
tion taken by them would be mis
construed by the Mexican govern
ment. In order to avoid being re
garded as organized combatants, the
Americans in case of necessity will
take refuge beneath the protection of
the various European flags.
Diaz on Active List.
Mexico City, Dec. 3. The war de
partment today published ' an order
transferring General Porfirio Diaz
from the retired list to the active list.
The order bears date of September 20.
Kidder Is Released.
Mexico City, Dec. 3. H. S. Kidder,
general traveling sales agent for the
Waters-Pierce Oil company, was re
leased on a bond of $2,500 at San Luis
Potosi today, after submitting to trial
by the federal authorities on a charge
of sedition. Apparently the only evi
dence against Mr. Kidder was that
while riding on the railroad he had
talked with employees regarding pre
vailing conditions and looked through
his field glasses at the landscape. He
was arrested on Nov. 27 charged with
complicity in recent dynamite out
rages on the railroad.
Kidder was formerly a locomotive
engineer and has lived in Mexico for
many years. The American consul at
San Luis Potosi was present at the
trial.
Comment on Wilson's Message.
Mexico City, Dec. 3. Aa outline of
the message delivered bv President
Wilson to congress at Washington was
prominently displayed Dy all the Span
ish mornings newspapers today. The
only paper printed in English, how
ever, printed it on an inside page. In
commenting on the message, the In-
dependiente, which is controlled by
me government, says:
"The man at the White House has
dared to affirm (against the truth
universally conceded) that Provisional
President Huerta is losing sympathy

Foond in Rooming House."
St. Louis, Dec. 3. The body of Miss
Emma M. Dene, a domestic, was
found today in a rooming house. Her
skull had been crushed with a blunt
instrument. Officers who examined
the body said she apparently had been
dead a week
The murder was discovered by Mrs.
Noticing an odor from the room oc
cupied by Miss Dene she called on a
street railway employee to help her,
and together they broke into the
room.
A side door was unlocked, indicating
that the murderer had escaped that
way. The body was identified as that
of Miss Emma Dene, 55 years old.
The police are searching for a man
who frequently 'called On Miss Dene,
and with whom she is said to have
quarreled.

May Repeal Sunday law.
Aurora. 111., Dec. 3.-r Preparations
are being made by councilmen to re
peal the recent ordinance prohibiting
work on Sunday. So many complica
tions have arisen since the first oper
ation of the new law last Sunday that
a majority of councilmen are said to
favor the laws revocation. A man
who had quarrel with his neighbor
asked a warrant for the latter's arrest
on the ground that he had violated the
ordinance by carrying ashes out of his
Basement on Sunday. .

New Vice Governor to Start
Thursday, Dee. 11.

Home Today From Washing,
ton Packing Up Tonight.
The Appointment Was a
. Surprise to Him.
Big
Henderson S. Martin returned to.
Topeka today with his commission as
vice governor and supervisor of edu
cation of the Philippines duly signed
by President .Wilson and carefully
tucked in his grip. Immediately Mar
tin began arrangements for his de
parture to the Islands, and will leave
Topeka Thursday, Dec 11, sailing
from San Francisco Dec 18. He will
assume the duties of his new job as
soon as he arrives in Manila.
Just as soon as the affairs of his
office as chairman of the public util
ities commission can be adjusted,
Martin will resign from the commis
sion. His successor has not as yet
been appointed, although it is prob
able that Governor Hodges will name
the new member of the commission
some time Thursday.
Before returning to Topeka, Martin
wired Mrs. Martin telling her to make
preparations to leave Topeka Dec. 11.
The new vice governor will be accom
panied to the Philippines by Mrs.
Martin and their daughter. Miss Sibyl
Martin. They expect to arrive in
Manila Jan. 15, and Martin will im
mediately take over the duties of his
new job, which is in many respects
the most important federal appoint
ment ever given a Kansas man.
Appointment Surprised Martin.
The news of the fat $15,500 Job came
as a complete surprise to Martin, he
told his friends in the state house.
"Why didn't you say something about
your new job before you left Topeka
for Washington?" a friend asked of
Martin.
"Why didn't someone say something
to me?" queried the Marion man. "It
was a real sure surprise to me. I
was in Washington at the time Presi
dent Wilson made the appointment, but
the first thing I knew about it was
when I saw my name in a Washington
evening paper the day ' the appoint
ment was made. That was the first I
knew of it."
Term of Office Indefinite.' .,
The tenure of Martin's new job is
indefinite. It is subject to change at
the pleasure of the president, which is
assumed by Martin's friends to mean
that the Kansas man will continue to
draw his $15,500 a year salary as long
as the Democrats are in power in
Washington.
But the new job is by no means a
political snap. There is real work at
tached to the office and Martin ex
pects to be a busy man while he is in
the Islands. In addition to his work
as vice governor of the Philippines,
he will have charge of the educational
system of the Islands, which includes
supervision over 9,000 teachers. Man
agement of the Philippine prison sys
tem, the province's agricultural sys
tem and the general management of
public printing are other responsibili
ties which will be heaped on the head
of the Kansas man who was largely
responsible for the Democratic victory
in Kansas last year.

Washington, Dec. 3. Secretary
McAdoo's first report to congress, de

review of the achievements of the
treasury department in matters that
have been of nation-wide interest; to

The secretary discussed at some

of an unrest in business circles fol

SPEED SAVED HIM
Fast Train Saves Life of To

Special Rushed to Lower Alti
tude for J. R. Koontz.
A report Just leaked out in To
peka railroad circles today that the
life of J. R. Koontz, general freight
agent of the Atchison. Topeka A
Santa Fe railroad, was saved recently
In a speed-mad race of a special train
from the high altitudes to the lower
strata of air in Kansas. Receiving a
congestion of the lungs in the Albu
querque region, Mr. Koontz, whose
headquarters are 4n Topeka, was
placed on a special-and rushed east.
He was relieved- immediately upon
descending into Kansas, v.
It seems that Mr. Koontz. who was
out on a business trip in the west,
was taken suddenly ill at Albuquerque.
The high altitude caused the attack.
It was necessary to remove Mr.
Koontz to a different climate and a
special tram was made up immedi
ately. The train made an average
speed of 55 miles an hour, according
to reports, and the Topeka general
freight agents was relieved.-
It is reported from the west that It
was the fastest time ever made by the
Santa Fe over the famous Belen cut
off. Between two stations, a distance
of 21 miles, the train made the
stretch in 18 minutes. Between
Vaughn and Taiban, 88 miles, the
train made the distance in 81 min
utes. Mr. Koontz is suffering no ill ef
fects from the experience.
PERISH JY FIRE
Burning Hotel Claims 27 Tic-

Nearly All Bodies Naked and
Terribly Mutilated. . .
JUED r:U"3ERED BY SCOPES
Lodgers Awakened to Find the
Stairways in Flames.
Three Jump From Roof and
Two Are Killed.
Boston, Dec. S. Twenty-seven men
were killed in a fire which swept
through the upper floors of the Arcadia
hotel, a lodging house in the South End
early today. Others are missing.
Scores suffering from injuries were
taken to hospitals.
Nearly all the bodies were terribly
burned and mutilated, making identi
fication impossible. The victims were
men in poor circumstances who had
resorted to the place . for . a night's
lodging. Caught in the crowded bunks
on the top floor of the five story orick
building and in the small rooms on
the fourth floor they were helpless.
When they were aroused the stairways
were in flames and there was a mad
rush . for the fire escapes at the rear.
Practically all of the men were naked.
Many Are Rescued.
Many were rescued by the firemen
and police. Some escaped by walking
a shaky plank stretched to an adjoining
building or by jumping across a five
foot alley to neighboring roofs. The
properly loss is only $25,000. .
The Arcadia was located at the cor
ner of Washington and Laconia
streets. The lower floors were occupied
by stores. The fire apparently started
in a hall way closet on the street floor.
Flames swept up the wooden stairs and
burned through the roof. According
to William Walsh, the night clerk,
there were 170 lodgers in the building
when the fire was discovered by a pass
ing newsboy. After turning in an alarm
he rushed into the building awakening
the men with his shouts.
The top floor was one large room
filled with cots and bunks. On the
fourth floor where the loss of life was
heaviest there were 30 tiny roomlike
cells with two cots in each. A hall
way ran through the center. Nearly
all those occupying rooms on the front
of the building perished. The men in
the rear rooms opening on the Are
escape had locked the doors when they
went to bed and those in front were
unable to reach the fire escape. -
' Jump From Roof.. " TJ"
When the firemen arrived flames were
shooting 20 feet in the air from the
windows on the fourth and fifth floors
and the fire escapes and the roof were
a mass of shrieking, struggling human
ity. Despite shouts of assurance from
below three men Jumped from the roof.
Two were instantly killed. The third

ed with a few bruises. ,
; Life nets were quickly stretched by
the nremen and many were rescued in
this manner. Others were taken down
ladders with the flames sweeping about
them. The intense heat soon drove the
firemen from their ladders and made
it necessary to fight the fire from the
street ' and from the elevated railway
structure in front of the building. The
fire was in the heart of the tenement
district and lower class hotel district.
Hundreds of occupants of adjoining
buildings rushed to the etreet when the

before they were able to enter the lodg

Before the ruins had cooled, two in
vestigations were begun, one by the
grand jury and another by the build

Democratic leaders failed to ratify
their currency bill program but
forced long session.
House met at noon. Sub-committee

corn planters from Ohio visited the
capitol.
President Wilson's recommendation
for direct primary election of presi
dential candidates came up In the
senate in a debate that held the body
more than an hour, during which Sen
ators Bristow, Cummins and others
expressed the hope that Democrats
would follow the president in sup
port of the reform, which they de
clared progressive Republicans long
had demanded. Senator Martin re
plied that the Democrats were "in
entire accord with the titular head
and the actual head of the Democrat
ic party." Senators Bristow and
Cummins retorted the Democratic
leaders should prove it by endorsing
bills introduced by progressive . Re
publicans early in the session. ' Mr.
Bristow has introduced such a bill,
modeled after the Kansas law.
'"I hope that under the inspiration
and impulse of this admirable mes
sage, delivered to congress by the
president, you can be induced to re
port that bill favorably or agree on a
modification of it," said he to the
Democrats. Senator Galllnger, Re
publican leader, declared a. nation
wide primary would "give the rich
man an advantage over the poor
man," and "make bribery easier than
at present,"
AnACKS KANSAS" LAW
Fire Insurance Company Files Brief in
United States Supreme Court.
Washington, Dec. S. Laws widely
adopted since 1909 by various states to
regulate fire, insurance rates were de
nounced as unconstitutional today in
a. printed brief filed with the United
States supreme court by John G. John
son of Philadelphia and associate coun
sel. : The brief was filed on behalf of the
German Alliance Insurance company,
which is seeking to have the court de
clare, unconstitutional the Kansas fire
insurance rate law.
A similar attack will be made short
ly before the court on the Kentucky
fire insurance rate law. A number of
other state laws, it is said will stand or
fall by decision in these cases. It was
insisted by counsel that a state has no
power to fix rates charged to the pub
lic by those engaged in a private busi
ness. It was said that fire insurapce
is a private business as shown by its
right to refuse to take undesirable
risks.
The insurance companies contend if
the states may fix the price of insur
ance they may fix the price of meat,
clothes and doctor services. Tbey
pointed to decisions in Illinois and
Pennsylvania where the courts denied
the right of the state to fix the price
of theater tickets. Taking up another
phase of the controversy, Mr. Johnson
and his associates contended that the
law cannot be supported as a valid ex
ercise of the police powers to protect
the public health, life, liberty or mor
ality. They argued that these insurance
laws must fall as unconstitutional for
the . same reason that the court de
clared invalid the New Tork law limit
in,, the hours of labor in bakeries. It
was this case that former President
Roosevelt made a national issue in the
last presidential campaign.
MAY HAVE ESCAPED.
Much Doubt Is Expressed Regarding
the Fate of Lopez.
Bingham, Utah, Dec. 8. That the
work of Sheriff Andrew Smith and his
two hundred deputies in the last three
days has been for naught and that
Ralph Liopez, tne nexican oanaii uu
murderer, has not been in the Minnie
mine here since Sunday was the opin
ion generally expressed among the
miners of this camp today. This,
however, is. not in accordance with
the belief of the sheriff who an
nounced that he probably would open
the mine Thursday morning when he
expected to find the body of Lopes.
Some credence is being given to the
theory advanced that Lopez had made
his escape trom tne mine ana detec
tives have been put to work in Bing
ham to trace down possible clews. Sul
phur fumes are still being sent into
the mine.

Miss Helen Eacker of Lawrence
' Tells Suffrage Association
Of Methods Pursued in Win
ning Totes in Kansas.
Except What Was Raised In
Their Own State.
The Speakers Adhered Strictly
to the One Subject.
Washington. Dec 3. The intrica
cies and the hard work of a stats cam
paign for woman suffrage were de
scribed today by Miss Helen Eacker of
Lawrence, Kansas, In an address at
the annual convention of the National
American Woman Suffrage associa
tion. Miss Eacker drew her lessons -from
the successful campaign recently
conducted by the organization of hei
own state.
"Excepting $441 sent by other states
and $2,000 from the national organi
zation," said Miss Eacker, "the women
of Kansas raised funds for their work
by voluntary contributions." Their
organization charged no membership
fee, and she believed the large mem
bership that resulted from this plan
more than offset, in increased enthus
iasm, any financial loss. This money
was used to establish headquarters,
send out missionaries and issue liters-
ture and conduct a general campaign :
Of education.
"We had much literature from the
national," she continued, "but found
there were many things we must pub
lish that would fit our own needs. Wo
had literature published In Croatian,
Swedish, French and German. Our
own Kansas furnished the copy.
"While we were bending every en
ergy to persuade all speakers in every
Chautauqua and other public places to
speak for us in the course or their re
marks, we told our .workers in good
big type that they must stick to their .
subject and not insert in - their re
marks any other ism, doctrine, po- -
litlcal or humanitarian belief, suf
frage was their sole faith. - For that
must they work and pray, and for that
alone. We knew no politics and no
creed, only suffrage. This may seem
selfish and narrow, but it was our
only salvation and an Important rea
son for our success. I might give an
example of temptations to deviate
from this straight and narrow path
we had so rigidly marked out for our- .
selves and our speakers, but there is
not time. Very, few of our workers '
ever deviated from the rule."
...v ; -tut.- RstS of Condnf. ....... ..,. ,, -.
la conclusion Miss Eacker summar
ized her recommendations as follows; "
"Established headquarters early.
"Chose harmonious forces for the
work there.
"Have the press chairman one of
the office force. " . .
"A big campaign bank account.
"Organizers of personality who can
create favorable sentiment.
"Constant communication between
headquarters and all parts of the
kingdom, a personal touch.
"Kindly supervision of the officers
and a watchfulness for their comfort.
"A small territory under the imme
diate supervision of a trained worker.
"A weekly bulletin sent out from
headquarters, keeping the publie In
formed of the work best for it to
know. ' .
"Keep watch of all public gather
ings and secure, endorsements and
kindly mention.
"Carry the word of this endorse
ment into each subdivision.
"Remain neutral on all political
questions.
"Have trained workers to secure
membership at each public gathering.
"Request the local workers to get
into close personal touch with each in
dividual in her locality.
"Let all this be tabulated and con
stant pressure be brought to bear on
the unsaved.
"Call on all ministers and publls
speakers for aid.
"See that your speakers and work
ers are suited to the local needs.
"Keep sweet and hopeful.
"Open headquarters each morning'
with prayer and Scripture reading.
"Be always on your job."
They Move on the Capitol.
Washington, Dec. 3. The suffrage)
convention was suspended today while
delegates moved on the capitol to urge
a favorable report by the house rules
committee on a resolution to create a
standing committee on woman suffrage
In the house. The scene resembled a
charge on a citadel when more than
1,000 women advanced in regimental
formation in quick step order and
crowded the hearing room long be
fore the committee arrived.
Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president
of the National American Woman Suf
frage association had charge of pre
senting arguments .. for a . committee.
She told the members it was not the
purpose of the speakers to convert the
congressmen to - suffrage but to con
vince them that the suffrage move
ment was entitled to a house commit
tee equivalent to a similar one in the
senate.
Mrs. Ida Husted Harper declared' the
suffrage movement had grown to na
tional ' proportions. Justifying a house
committee, that the movement had not
received its Just treatment and that
justice required that . the movement
should come under thj Jurisdiction of
the national congress.
Helen Gardner, Miss Jane Ad dams.
Mrs. Desha Breckenridge, Mrs. Mary -Beard
and Mrs. Carrie Chapman Carl
also pleaded for the committee. - Rep
resentative Baker of California spoke
for his resolution which would pro
vide for a suffrage' committee of II
members. A' resolution oy Representa
tive Kelley. Progressive, of Pennsylva
nia, was adopted providing that the
