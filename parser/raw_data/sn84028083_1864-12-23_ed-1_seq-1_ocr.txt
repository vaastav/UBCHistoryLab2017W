The Hon Salmon P. Chase.
The appointment ol Mr, Chase to tl e
Chief Justiceship oo the supreme JJeuch
ol the National Judioary, will be hailed
by al! loyal cil z ri witb saii&facttQO.
The appointment was made by ibe Presi
dent himself, and waa sent into the Sen
ate io hie own handwriting. Senator
Sherman was first apprised ol the appoint
ment, it not being known even to t he
President's own Secre'artes until it was
sent to the Senate, In which body it wai
confirmed wanimoutty withovt rtftrtnee to
any cummtittt. A Washington dispatch
pertinently tugged it at a curious coin
cidence that it will become the duly of the
(renlleman who was Mr. Linooln'a only
serious nval'ior the .Presidency, to swear
him into office for his second term. A
biiei sketch ol Mr. Chase's life aod terv
ices may ?rove interesting:
Snlinnn Portland Chase was born in
Cornish, New Hampshire, on I lie I3h of
January, 1808. He graduated at Dart-moth-
College io 1819, and before the
close ol (be year, was admitted to the bar
ol Ibe District of Columbia. Id 1830 he
hegan practicing law in .Cincinnati, Ohio,
and gained some notoriety by bis deience
of James O, Birney, prosecuted for bar
boring a slave. Io 1835 he was appoint
ed Solicitor of tbe Bank of the Uuiied
Stales in Cincinnati, and soon alter of one
of Ibe ctiy banks.
Io 1841 Mr. Chase look a decided
stand in politics, attending an Anti-slave
ry Convention in Columbus, Ohio, aud
preparing an address, which was adopted
Dy tue convention, tie was on the Com
mittee of Resolutions in the National Lib
er'y ConveotioB at Buffalo. In 1845 he
was Chairman of the Committee ol au
Anti-slavery Convention al Cincinnati.
On tbe 22d ol February, 1849. be was
shosen oeoalor of the United States from
Uhlo. in Uct., iUlii), Air. Chase was
elected Governor ol Ohio, and afterward
re eleeted, Mr. Chase's career as Secre
tary ot tbe Treasury i of recent history.
Mr. Chase bat attained distinction in eve
ry civil position he bat filled. He is a
clear, comprehensive, dispassionate think
er. The babils of bis mind are eminent
ly judioial, nd he will reflect credit upon
the Supreme Bench. 1 bis sppoiulment
does honor to Mr. Lincoln, as well as jus
tice lo thnt general sentiment which
pointed lo Mr. Chase as (lie man for the
position. We may confidently anticipate
now a series ol decisions upon constitu
tional questions which will establish a sys
tem alike durable and consonant with tbe
enlightenment of the age.
Simplicity in Sttlr A letter foil Into
my bands which a Scotch ' servant girl had
written to her lover. Its style charmed
me. It was fairly inimitable; I wondorod
how, in ber circumstances io life, she could
have acquired so elegant and perfect a
style. 1 showed the letter to tome of my
literary friends in Now York, and tbey
uoanimously agreed that it was a model of
beauty aod elegance. I tbon determined
to olve the mystery, and I went to I ho
bouse where she was employed, and asked
ber bow it was that, io ber simple circum
stance lo lite, she bad scquired a style so
beautiful (bat tbo most cultivated minds
could but admire it. "Sir," she said, "I
come to tbi country four yeir ago. Tbon
I did hot know how io read or write. But
since theu I have learned to read and write,
but I have not learned how to spell : so al
way., whon I sit down to write a letter, I
choose those words which are so short aod
simulo that I am sure I know bow to (poll
ibem." There was tbe whole secret. The

densu a world of rbetnrio into a out shell.

THE SILVER MINES.
!
Nevada is probably tbe richest Slate in
the Union in respect to mineral resources.
No region in I lie wotld is richer in aj
genii'crous leads. These leada are found
over the entue Washoe country, the rich
est ol which is thai known as the Corn
stock lead, at Virginia City. The local
ities ol the oiber principal mines io the
region east of the Sierra Nevada, are tbe
Estnerald mines, one hundred miles
southeast ol Virginia City, the Humboldt
one hundred aod sixty miles northeast;
lite Bilver Mountain, sixty miles south;
Penvioe, thirty miles north, and the Reese
River country, one hundred aod seventy
miles east of northeast, embracing many
districts, sod flanked by two of more than
ordinary promise the Cortiz, seventy
miles north, and the San Aatonio, one
hundred miles south of Austin, now the
p.jncipal towns on the Rees River.
. . .
Lying south ol Virginia City, and ex
tending to Carson River, a distance of
eight miles,, are the Gold Hills, Devil's
Gate and Sulphur Springs distticts, con
taining innumerable ledges, msny of them
large, and exhibiting lair prospects upon
Ineir outcrops. Here are scores of tun
nels, some of them two thousand feet
limp: and shafts wiihout number, vary
ing ia depth . Irom filly to three hundred
feet.
IMMENSE BASIN OF SALT.
A low months ago another deposit of
mineral wealth was brought, to light,
which bss proved of incalculable value
to the silver miners. Tnis was an im
mense basin of salt, five miles square,
near the sink of 'he Carson River.
This basin, says a gentleman who writes
from Virginia City, appears once to have
been tbe bottom ol a lake, and tbe salt is
found, good, even on the 6ur(uce. A cov-
eringol about three inches is loose and
iuditl'eieoi; but beneath this, lor a depth
ol fourteen teet, pure rock ssll is lound,
as clear as ice, And "white as the driven
snow." Beneath there is water, which
seems to be filtered through Rail of an
unknown dep'ti. 1 lie whole of tbe four
treo leel to thickness .does not contain a
single streak of any deleterious mailer or
rubbish, and is ready lor quarrying and
sending to market. Great blocks ol pure
stuff can be raised the same as if it were
ice and stone; on exposure, however, it
crumbles sufficiently to admit ol being
closely packed io sacks and wagon boxes.
Grinding is necessary to prepare it for
tbe tahlt; otherwise nature bss "done
the clean thing" in its preparation. Once
the loose salt on top is removed, one man
can quarry and wheel out five loos each
day he may work. The importance ol
this discovery may be estimated from tbe
fact that many hundred tons of salt are
used by tbe mills of the Territory every
month Id segregating the ore. The lo
cality is one hundred miles west ol Reese
River, and seventy miles east of Virginia
City, on theOveiland Road.

tho concluding words of the Mnssagn: "Tbe

&c.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE EAST,
NEW YORK CITY, Dec. 14. 1864.
Gineral Orders No. 97. Ioforma-
ion having been received at these Head
quarters, that the Rebel marauders, who
were guilty ol murder and robbery at St.
Albans, bave been discharged from sr
rest, and tbat other enterprises are alually
in preparation in Canada, tbe Command
ing General deems it due to the people of
the frontier towns to adopt tbe most
prompt snd efficient measures for the se
curity of their lives and property.
All military commanders are, there
fore, instructed, in case further acts of
depredation and murder are attempted,
whether by mvauders or peieons acting
under commissions from tbe rebel author
itiet at Richmond, to shoot down the per
petrators, if possible, wbile in tbe com
mission of Ibeir crimes; or, if it be neces
sary, with a view to their capture, to eross
the boundary between tbe United States
and Canada. Said conrmenders hereby
are directdd lo pursue them wherever
tbey moy tske refuge; and, if captured,
tbey are under no circumstances lo be
surrendered, but are to be sent lo these
headquarters for trial and punishment by
martial law.
Tbe Major General commanding the
Deparun'l will not hesitate to exeroise to
ibe fullest extent the authority be pos
sesses, under tbe rules of law recognized
by all civilized states.in regard to persons
or gangs io hostile expeditions within a
neutral territory, and fleeing lo it lor an
asylum, after committing acts of depreda
tion witbio our own, such an exercise of
authority having become indispensable lo
protect our cities and towns from incen
diarism, and ourpeopie from robbery abd
murder.
It is earnestly hoped Ibat tbe inhabit
ants of our frontier districts will abstain
from all acts of retaliation on account of
tbe outrages committed by rebel maraud
ers, and '.bat the proper measures of re
dress will be left tp ibe action of the pub
lic authorities.
By command of Major-Gen'l Dix.

An Ossified Man.
' There is a man residing in Portage

his borse. Tbe injury caused ossification
which immediately set in, and in the
oourse ol fifteen years bad completed its
terrible woik. He can only move two of
bis fingers and two of bis toes. He baa
not opened bis jaws for more than thirty
years, yet still maoagea to talk with ease.
Hia food is placed within his lips by kind
attendants, aod without mastication is
conveyed lo bia stomach. Hs lies in tbe
same position during an entire day, only
changing bis position once in twenty-lour
hours. His skin, fortunately retains its
normal condition. He bas been blind for
thirty years, aod is compelled to draw
upon bis memory for mental exercise.
Tbi laculty bat become exceedingly te
nacious. He remembers tbe most minute
son triuing incident or circumstance; nas
tbe entire past.every fact and event in his
experience, before bim, piled up like stra
ta', afld summons at will, or as occasion
requires, occurrence wbicb bave faded
from tbe minds of their friends. His
reccolleotion of localities is wonderful.
Places tbat be bas visited yesrs ago, be
fore struck with blindness, be can now
identify as be rides along, so vivid a rec
ollection bas be of tbe relative position of
things, as bridges, rivers, to. He is
very expert at mathematical calculations.
and can with great readiness, give, lor
