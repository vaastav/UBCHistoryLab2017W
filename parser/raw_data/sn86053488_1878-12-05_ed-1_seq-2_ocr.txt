The election of Mr. C. K. Garrison, Presi
dent of the Missouri Pacifie Railroad, to tbe
Presidency of the Wabash Road, is likely
to be followed by a number of important
changes in the connections of several of tbe
leading roads. The Wabash has pur
chased the unfinii-lied Chicago and
Paducah Road, which will be util
ized by the Wabash In securing
an independent through line from St. Louis
to Chiosipo. The Illinois Central meanwhile
has begun the survey of a new connecting
line from Kinnoy, In Dewitt County, to East
St, Loutswhich it is reported will be con
structed In . the shortest practicable time.
Other changes are talked of, but the two
mentioned seem to be fully determined
upon. '
It is reported that negotiations are pend
ing for the consolidation of tlie Union and
Central Pacific Railroads under one man
agement. On application' of Major Keno, Seventh
Cavalry, a Court of Inquiry is appointed to
assemble at Chicago on the second Monday
in January, to inquire into the Major's con
duct at the battle of Little Big Horn, when
Gen. Custer was killed.
Secretary Sherman's plan of resumption

out limitation. There -will be no other
point of unlimited redemption ex
cept : New , York, though other
sub-treaauries may redeem legal
tendernotes"within ordinary limits." Silver
dollars will be exchanged for greenbacks or
National Bank notes in multiples of $1,000,
and the-expense of transportation will be
paid by the United States Government. A
specie Issue of legal tenders of large denom
inations will take the place of gold certifi
cates. Legal tenders will be receivable for
customs dues.

TnB CONCRESSIOXAL ELECTIONS W THB
SOU1 HEKN STATES.
The permanent pacification of the conntry
by the complete protection of all citizens in
every civil and political light continues to
be ot paramount Interest with the preut body
of our people. Kvery step in this direction IS
welcomed with public approval, and every
Interruption of steady and uniform
progress to the desired consum
mation awakens general unesislness and
wMe-sareAdcondempntion. TherocentCon.
greosioual election hHvb furnished a direct
and tmetworthv test of the advance thus far
rnaile in the practical establishment of the
right of suffrage, se tired by the Constitution
to the liberated race in the botithern Stiites.
All disturbing inrtiienee-s reiil or imaginary,
hud been removed from all of these States.
Tne three constitutional amendments.
which conferred fieid'in and equality of civ
11 :nul nolitienl rtrlils noon the colored peo
pie of the Soutbi-wcie adopted by the tori'
r.nrn-iit. Ri Hon of tl.c sjicut boilv i f pood citi-
Kens who maintained the authority of the
x-Lti.miit Uovci-nii. ei t uiul tlie iiitcuntv tuid
perpetuity of the Colon t such a cost of
trvasnre and lite, as a we and necessary
embodiment in the organic law of tbe Just
results of the war. The people of the former
slave-holding States accepted, these results.
and gave, in every pi lu in niiie iorm, ur
antes thut the thirteenth, fourteenth and tlf
teenth aiiiendmeiiis. and laws imssed in pur
thei-eot Hhould. in uotid faith, be en-
f.nted. rnridlv and inip:ii-tiallv. in letter and
spirit, to the end that the humblest citizen,
without distinction of luce or color, should,
under them, receive full and eoual protec
tion in person and property and lm political
liuhtM and privil. ges. By these con
stmitioual amendments, the Southern
section of the Union obtained a
luriie increase of political pow er in
Conm-eas and in the Kiectoiai College, and
the country Justly expected that elections
would proceed, as to tne enfranchised race,
upon tlie sauic ciicuiiisiunces of legsl ana
t oii-titull'iiial lie. doui and pmtection which
tibtmued in all the other staiesof the Union.
Tlie friends of law and order looked forwaid
to the conduct of these elections, as cm-ring
to the eeneral liKiKinent of the country an
important opportunity to measure the degree
in w hich the light ot suninge couia lie exer
cised bv the colored Peonle.und would be re
spected by their fellow-citizens; but amove
general ei Joyuient of freedom of suifiage by
the colored people, ami. a more Just and (ten
erous protection of tnut trecdotn by the com
uiuiiiiii-s of which they form a part, were
generally anticipated than tbe record of the
election disclost . In some ol those States in
which the ooloreHl people have been unable
to make their opinions telt in the elections,
the result is mainly due to infliicnces not
easil measured or remedied by Jegitl pi-otec-tion:
but in the States of Louisiana and South
IStroIii.aat la'ge, and in some paitlenlar con
gressional districts' ouUide of those Stittes.tno
r cords of therleetions eem to compel the
conclusion that tlie lights of the colored vot
ers have been o erridden, and their paitiel
piitiou iu the election not permitted to be
eiti.er (teneral or five.
It w ill be for the Congress for which these
elections were held, to make such examina
tions iuto their conduct as may be appropri
ate to determine the validity of the claims of
members to their seats, in tbe meanwhile it
becomes the duty of the Executive and Ju
dicial Departments of the Government, each
in its province, to inquire into and punish
violations of the luws ol the United Slates
which have occurred. I can bm repent what
1 skkI in this eoum ctiou iu my last message,
that whatever authority rests with me to tii
end I shall uot hesitate to put forth, ami I am
unwilling to lorego a renewed appeal to the
legislatures, the courts, the executive au
thorities, and the peoplot the Mates where
these wrongs have been perpetrated, lo give
their assistance towards bringing to Justice
the offenders and preventing a repetition of
ti.e crimes. Xo means within my power will
be spared to obtain a full and fair investiga
tion ol the alleged crime, and to secure the
conviction and Just punishment of the guilty.
It is to be observed that the principal ap
propriation made lor the Department of Jus
tice at tbe last session contained tbe follow
ing clause: "And for defraying- the expenses
which may be incurred In the enforcement of
the act approved February twenty-eighth,
eighteen hundred and seventy-one, entitled
'An act to amend an act approved
Hay thirtieth, eighteen hundred and
seventy, entitled An act to en
force the rights of citizens oi the United
fctatcs to vote in the several States of the
Union, and for other purposes,' or any acts
amendatory thereof or supplementary there
to." It is the opinion of the Attorney-General
that the expenses of these proceedings will
largely exceed the mnoant which was thus
provided, and I rely confidently upon Con
gress to m- ke adequate appropriations to en
able the Executive Department to enforce
the laws. ' ' - - t : ' V
I respectfully urge npon your attention
that the congressional elections, in every
district, in a very important sense, axe Justly
a matter of political interest and concern
throughout the whole country. Each State,
every political party, ts entitled to the share
of power which i conferred by tbe legal and
constitutional sutlrage. Jt is the right of
every citizen, possessing the qualifications
prescribed by law, to east one nnintlmidated
ballot, and to have his ballot honestly count
ed. 8o long as the exercise of thla,powerand
the enjoyment of this right are common and
equal, practically as well as formally, sub
mission to the results of the suffrage will be
accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all
tbe departments of Governn-ent will feel the
true vigor of the popular will thus expreaseiL
Ko temporary or administrative interests of
Government, however argent or weighty,
will ever displace the zeal of our people in
defense of the primary rights of t itizenshlp.
They understand that the protection of lib
erty requires the maintenance, in full vigor,
of the manly methods of free speech, free
firess, and free suffrage, and will sustain the

Tne Japanese Government, has oeen uo
si rous of k revibion of such parts of its treaties
witti foreign powers as relate tb commerce;
and, it is understood, has addressed to each
ot tlie treaty powers a request lo open nego
tiations with that view. The United States
Government has been inclined to
regard the mattes: iavora'uly. treat
ever restrictions upon trade with
Japan are found injurious to that people can
not but uttcct injuriously nations holding
coinmeicial interc uirse with them. Jpan,
atu r a long period of seclusion, has within
the past few years made rapid strides in the
path of enlightenment and progress, and,
not unreasonably, is looking forward to the
time when her relations with the
nations ol Europe and America
shall be. assimilated to tints"
which they hold with each other. A treaty
looking to this end ha been made;, which
will be submitted for the consideration of this
Senate.
Alter an Interval of several years, the Chi
nese Government has again sent envoys to
the United States. They have been received
and a permanent legation is now established
here by thatGoverniueiit. His not doubted
that this step will be of advantage to both
nations m promoting friendly relations and
removing cause of different e. The treaty
witn the Samr.an Islands, bavin been duly
rll'ilied and accepted on the part of both
Governments, is now in operation, and n sur
vey and soundings of the harbor of 1'agrt
Pago have been made by aimval Vessel of the
United States, with a view of its occupation
as a naval station, if found desirable to the
service. , ,
since the resumption of diplomatic rela
tions w ith Mexico, correspondence has Dcen
opened and still continues between- the two
liovernmcnts upon the various questions
which at one time seemed to endanger their
relations. While r.o formal agreement has
been r. ached as to the troubles on the bor
der, much has been done to repress and di
minish them. The effective force of United
Stales troops on the ltio Grande, by a s-trict
ami faithful compliance with instructions,
has done much to remove the sources ol dis
pute, and it is now understood that a like
force of Mexican troops 011 the other side of
the river is also making an energetic move
ment against the marauding Indian tribe.
This Government looks with the greatest
Miti-faction upon every evidence of strenirlh
in the national authority of Mexico, and up
on every ctf irt put forth to prevent or to
punish incursions upon our tenitory. Ko
luctiint to a-Mi nc any action or attitude in
the control of these incursions, by military
movements across tlie border, not impera
tively demanded for the protection of the
lives and property of our own citizens, I
shall take the earliest opportunity, consistent
with the proper discharge of this plain duty,
to recognize the ability ot the Mexican Gov
ernment to restrain elfcctfvelv violations of
our territory. It is pro osed to hold next
year an In ernaii inal Exhi'-iti n in Mexico,
and it is believed that the di-phiy of tne ag
ricultural and 1t1am1t.11 tin lug products of
the two nstforis will tend to better under
(dancing and increased commercial inter
com se between their people.
V illi Brazil, and the lb-publics of Central
ftndf South America, some steps have been
taken toward the development of closer
commercial intercourse. Diplomatic rela
tions have been resumed with Colombia and
with Bolivia. A boundary question between
the Argentine Kepublic and Pi rag iay has
been submitted by those Goveinin-nts for
arbitration to the "President "f the Ui ited
states, and I have, alter careful examination,
given a dec i-lon tifwin it.
A naval expedition up the Ama
zon mid Madeira Bivers has brought
back intormation valuable both for scientific
and commercial purposes. A like expedition
is niM.ut vNiiing the coast of Africa and the
Indian Ocean. The reports of diplomatic and
consular otlleers, in relation to the develop
ment of onr foreign comE--'rce, have '.iimi-h-ed
many tin ts that 1- iVe proved of public in:
terest, and Iihv--stimulated to practical ex

In the fort going statements ot expendi

the act approved February' l bioh
quires that one per cent. of the entire debt of
the United states shall be purchased or paid
within each fiscal year, to be set apart a a
sinking fund. There has been, however, a
substantial compliance with the conditions
of the law. Bv its terms, the public debt

the close of tbe Isst fiscal year, ti-'W;
the actual reduction of the ascertained debt,

The progress made during tbe last year, in
refunding the public debt at lower latesof
interest, is very gratifying. The amount of
4 per cent, bonds sold during the present
yc-nr prior to Novembers.!, is;s,is Sl0n,-J70,!)ft),
and 0 per cent, bonds, commonly known ns
live-twenties, to anequal amount, have been,
or will be, redeemed as callsmature.
It has bt en the policy of tbe Department
to place the 4 per cent, bonds within easy
reach of every citizen who desires 10 invest
his savings, whet her small or great, iu these
securities, lhe secretary 01 me nrui-ui;
recommends that the law be so moddied.iiuit
small sums mav beinvested.andtliat through
the post -oltices", or other agents oi the Gov
ernment, 'tie freest onporMinttv mav lie given
In all parts of the conntry, for such invest
ments. The best mode suggested ls.that the Depart
ment be authorized to issue eertiflcutesot de
posit, of the denomination ot ten dollars-,
bearing interest Bt the rate of S.Si per cent,
per annum and convertible at any time with
in one year after their issue into the four per
cent, bonds authorized by tbe Refunding act,
and to be issued only in exchange of United
States notes sent to the Treasury by mail
or otherwise. Such a provision of lav, sup
ported by suitahle regulations, would enable
any person readily, without cost or ristr, to
convert Ida money into an interest-bearing
security of tbe United States, and the tconey
so received could be applied to tbe redemp
tion of six per cent, bonds. '
The coinage of gold during the last fiscal
year was jM,79B.95U The coinage of silver
dollars, under the act passed February' S
IsTS, amounted, on the 2 -dot November, 1S78,
to i,ell.O, ol which amount Jt.347 is in
circulation, and the balance, Sll.sjJ.eOJ, is still
in the possession of the Government. .
tVith view unchanged with regard to the
act under which the coinage of diver pro
ceeds, it has been the pttrpoeeof the Secretary
faithfully to execute the law, ana to all old a
fair trial to the measure
In the preent financial condition of the
country, I am persuaded that the welfare of
legitimate business and indntry of every
de.-criptien wul be best promoted by ab
staining fsom all attempts to make radical
changes in the existing tin uncial legislation.
Let it Ik- understood that Ounng the coming

w. t S7l fti7 wv TIia Amount drawn from the
Treasury on appropriations, in aaauion -u
the revenues of the Department, was $5,307,
MJ.H. The expenditures for the fiscal year
ending Juno SO, llWO, are estimated at $J6,"i71,
900, and the receipts from all sources at $,
6M,il.!0, leaving a deficiency to be appropri
ated out of tbe Treasury of $5,9o7,876.10. The
report calls attention to the tact that the
compensation of postmasters and of railroads
for carrying the mail is regulated by law, and
that the failure ot Congress to appropriate
the amounts required for these purposes doe
not relieve the tiovernment of responsibility,
but necessarily increases the deficiency bill
which Congr ss will be called npon to pass.
In providii g f .ir the postal service, the fol
lowing questions are presented: Should
Congress annually appropriate a sum for its
expenses largely in excess of its revenues, or
should such rates of postage be established
its will make tbp Department self-sustaining?
Should the postd service be reduced by ex
eluding from, tie mails; matter which does
not pay it way? Should the numberof post
routes be diminished? Should other methods
be adopted which will increase the revenues
or diminish the expenses of the postal serv
ice? The International Postal Congress, which
met at Paris May 1, WS, and continued in
session until June 4 of the same year, was
composed of delegates from nearly all the
civilized countries of the world. It adopted
anew convention, to take the place of the
treaty concluded nt Heme October 9, 1S74;
which goes into effect on the 1st of April, ISiU,
between the countries whose delegates have
signed it. It was ratified and approved, by
and with the consent ot the President, Aug
ust I!, 18:8. A synopsis of this Universal
1'ostul Convention will be found in the re
port of the PostniBster-Generul, and the full
text in the appendix thereto. In it origin
the Postal Union comprised twenty-three
countries and colonies, with a population of
three hundred and lifty millions of people.
On the 1st of April next it wiU comprise for
tv. three countries and colonies. With a popu
lation of more than six hundred and fifty
millions ot people, and will soon, by the ac
,...i,.i, tin. feur remaining countries and

The annual reixirts of the Secretary of tlie
Interior and of the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, present an elaborate account of the
present condition of the Indian tribee, and of
that branch of the public service which min
isters to their interests. While the conduct
of the Indians, generally, has been orderly,
and their, relations with their neighbors
friendly and peaceful, two local disturbances
have occurred, which were deplorable in their
character, but reuialred, happily, confined to
a comparatively smitii nuiiioer 01 iiiuians.
The discontent among the Bannocks, which
led iirst to some acts of violence on the part
of some members oi the tribe and finally to
the outbreak, appears to nave lieen causea
hv an inttlitieiicv of food on the reservation.
aiid this insuflicicncy to have been owing to
the inadequacy of the appropriations, made
by Congress, to the wants of the Indians, at a
time when the Indians were prevented from
stipp'J'lng the deficiency by hunting. After
an arduous pursuit by the troops of the Unit
ed States, and several engagements, the hos
tile Indians were reduced to subjection, and
the larger part of them surrendered them
selves as prisoners. In this connection, I de
sire to call attention to the recommendation
made bv the secretary of the Interior, that a
sullle'ciit fund be placed nt the disposal of
the Executive, to be used, witn proper ac
countability, at discretion, in sudden emer
gencies of the Indian tervice.
' The otherease of disturbance was that of a
band ol Noi t bel li Cheyenne who suddenly
hit their reservation in the Indian Territory
and inarched rapidly through the States of
Kansas and Si-braska in the direction of their
old hunting-grounds, committinir murders
and other crimes on tln-ir way. irom
documents accompanying the refairt of the
Secretary of the Interior, it appears that
this disorderly- bund was as fully supplied
with tlie necessaries of li!e as the 4,7(0 other
Indians who remained quietly on the reserva
tion, and that tb" distui banco was caused by
men ot a restless and mischievous disposition
among the Indian themselves. Almost the
whole oi this band have surrendered to 'the
military authorities, audit is a gratifying fact
thut, when some of iheufliad taken refuse in
the ca.np ot the lied Cioud Sioux with whom
they had been in b uiiuiIy.ela.;ions, the Sioux
held them as prisoners and readily gave them
up to the olticeis.f the? United States, thus
giving new proof of the loyal spirit which,
alarming rumors to the contrary notwith
standing, they have uniformly showed ever
since -thw wishes they expressed at the
council of acpuambei', 1877, hud been com
plied with.
Beth tbe Secretary of the Interior and the
Secictaryof War unite iu the recommenda
tion that provision be made by Congress lor
the organizatiun of a corps of mounted "In
dian auxiliaries," to be under the control of
the Army, aud to be used for tbe purpose of
keeping the Indians en their reservations
and preventing or repre-sing disturbance on
their part. I earnestly cov-cur in this recom
mendation. It is believed that the organic ac
tion of such a bod of Indian cavalry, re
ceiving a moderate pay ; from the
Government, would, considerably weaken
the restless element ,'ainotig tbe Indiana, by
'withdrawing from it a uumUer of young luea
and giving them eongvnij employ merit un.
der the Government, it being a matter of ex
perience that Indians in onr service almost
without exception are fMithfnl in the per
formance of the duties assigned to tl.em.
Such an organization wonld materially aid
the Airuy in tj ut-conrplisUuteut of a task
for which its nnintric v aireutu is some
times fuund insnrtleieiit.
But, v bile the employ merit of force for the
prevention or rt-prrasiyn ct Indian troubles
is of occasional necessttys-iirfd wie pr? p ira
tion should be made- to that ei.d, greater ro
iisi.ee mustM) piuced on huiin.no and civil

w hat is called the Indian pr. bleni. It maybe
