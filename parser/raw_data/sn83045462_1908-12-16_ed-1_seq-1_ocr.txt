CARACAS Venezuela. December Jo. via
TYillemstad. Curacao December lf>.?The %
' people of Caracas arose yesterday against b
President Castro. An infuriated mob. unhindered
by the police, swept through the S1
city wrecking the property of his hench- ,r
men and closest friends. The people ^
rounded up all the statues and plrtures of w
President Castro from the clubs and other ;
semi-pub'ic buildings and burned them. ]
with rejoicing, on the Plaza Bolivar. Sev- '
eral persons were killed in the course of ' t)
the rioting.
Castro's rule in Venezuela probably i3
ended. No official act deposing Castro
from the presidency of Venezuela yet has b<
been taken, but such a step is expected C
any moment. C
It became necessary by nightfall to de- tt
clare martial law In order to put an end to
the rioting and pll'aging. h
There w. re several attacks on private >"'
property on the part of the mob before ^
the atithoritles got the situation in p,
hand and several of the agitators were
arrested. There was no actual conflict it
between the people and the police. The ?
pillaging was confined to the p opertles
of Venezuelans, notably Senors Rivas and ?
Thielen. No foreigners were molested. A
Today the city is quiet and business is jj
taking its normal course. '
Not Directed Against Holland.
In spite of Holland's warlike activity on
the coast there have been no demonstra- f(
ions against the Netherlands. They ah cl
have been directed against President Caa- e;
tro and Acting President Gomez. t
An inormotis crowd of the inhabitants
of tpi capital, swelled by people from the tt
outlying country", gathered In the streets ai
sjon after daybreak. The people began
marching up and down the main thor- in
ough fares. and It was easy to see that
their ill t-mper would soon result in vlo1rn<_e
The police stood by and made no ;e
attempt whatever to restrain the mob. I
The first building to be attacked and
looted was that of the lottery monopoly. ^
The offices of the state nte prise that jr
as enriched itself at the expense of the 0|
p op' were ransacked and pillaged. Fur- ?*'
ritnre was broken nnd th own into the
streets and thousands of lottery tickets rt
were destroyed. ui
Newspaper Office Looted.
T'.e crowd then moved to the printing <_ ?
office of 11? Const it uelonal, tiie organ of OI
President Castro, of which Gumersindo
Kivas is editor, and pillaged it completely
A steam laundry belonging to Senor Riva* oi
also was wrecked.
The attack on the offices of El Constitucional.
when the crowd was curbed by a | <jj
detachment of soldiers, who fired into the j
demonstrants. resulted In several fatali- ! a
ies. A criminal action has been begun ' L
against Editor Rivas and other employes ;
of the paper, ir. which they are charged :
w ith responsibility for these deaths. It is : j
declared that Rivas ana his men fired first
on the people, making use of revo'vers.
El Constituclonal has suspended publi- J
cation and (,'aratas is practically without
a newspaper. j"
The crowd then turned Its attention to'
se\fcia! drug stores belonging to Senor j
Thielen. a son-in-law of Gen. Tello Men-1
doza. and turned them inside out. Gen.'

Tne statues and pietu:rs of President a

Numerous Inscriptions setting forth the

AWYER HYPNOTIZES COURT!

rnd. for First Time, Commission of i
Attorneys Is Sitting to Find
Out if It Is True.
DHNVKH December 16?To determine
rhether an attorney has tlie gift of hypolism
to the extent of influencing courts
nd juries the federal court here yesterday
->rmed a commission of leading attorneys
or investigation.
Judges and jurors before whom the al- j
>ged hypnotic lawyer has practiced will 1
p examined by the commission as to what '
hey have seen in the way of undue in- .
tience of a supernatural nature in the I
ttorney's methods.
The man under investigation is Benja- ,
lin B. La ska. a former palmist and clairoyant
who lias been practicing law for
time time, and the United States Supreme !
'ourt wants to know whether he is a real ;
ypnotist, whether his appearance in ihe'
uurt is dangerous to the laws of the i
ountry. and whether it is safe to have a
Lwver around who can "cast a .-pel!" over ;
urors and court attaches.
The Investigation Is secret. and is being

morning in an encounter with live men.

railroad yards of that village.
Marshal Woods accosted a man
standing near the post office and acting
in a suspicious manner. In reply
to questions the unknown said he was
a stranger in town, but desired to leave
on a freight train.
The marshal escorted him to the railroad
yards. Just as they reached the
tracks four other men suddenly Jumped
from behind a car.
They ordered the marshal to throwup
his hands. He did. but in one hand
he had an automatic revolver, which
lie fired.
One bullet pierced the heart of one
of the quartet, who fell dead. The tiring
was returned by the other four,
and one of the balls struck the marshal
in the back.
As the marshal fell the men beat him
into insensibility and then escaped. The
firing aroused the village and the
wounded marshal and the body of the
unknown man were found in the railroad
yard.
A posse is today searching the surrounding
territory for trace of the
men. The dead man was about fittyllve
years of age and well dressed.
GREENWICH. Ohio. December Hi.?

A bold and cleverly planned scheme
to rob the two banks of the town and

foiled by the marshal, at what will
probably bo the cost of his life.
The marshal was rushed to a hospital
at Gallon after the shooting. His

Seeking West Virginia Collector- i

TIME WASTED, SAYS PRESIDENT j
Hearn Delegation Impressed With
the Possibility of Its Man Winning
the Appointment.
If the small brigade of West Virginians
who departed from the White House today
had been chameleons their odors
would have beeu ihe wonder of tlia* section
of the city. As it was. there was 1
sufficient expression of various emotions
and enough of face and word play to ,
clearly show that something had happened.
"The President told us that it was a
pure waste of time to recommend to him
a brother of Judge Grosscup for a position
in West Virginia." one of the callers
declare)!, and he quoted the President's
particular words.
His statement was confirmed from two
or three other callers. "That was not
all." said the visitor. "The - President
; looked as if he meant every word he said,
too. At any rate every man present will
undoubtedly take him at his word in the
tight for the collectorshlp thai is now

political office in the state?collector
of Internal revenue.
After waiting awhile Senators kllkins
and Scott got together and decided they
would put up to the President the name
of Fred Paul Grosscup of Charleston for
collector. Grosscup was at one time
speaker of the house of representatives
of the slate and is now an oil and gas
owner. Senator Scott called on the President
ahout a week ago and diplomatically
sounded the President to see how Grosscup's
name would go. It didn't go at all.
but the President was not as emphatic as
he could have been. He didn't clinch his '
remarks by displaying the big stick, i
Grosscup's friends insisted on the matter
going before the President in more formal
and material form. They now recognize j
that the Grosscup family Is out of the i
game at the executive offices for the next !
three months, at |east.
The West Virginians arrived at the J
White House ahead of thr rest of the '
caHers. Senators Pcott and Klkins and ]
Representative Gaines introduced Fred '
Paul Grosscup and as his hackers Grant '

Representative Hughes introduced n ;
rival delegation, which called in the in- i
terost of A. J. Hearn of Bluetiold. After
the Hearn people listened to the brief hut
pointed remarks of the President they
went away impressed with the possibility
of winning for their man.

ROOT VISITS "THE CAPITOL
APPEARS BEFORE FOREIGN RELATIONS
COMMITTEE.
Discusses Entente Between United
States and Japan?Tokio Exposition
Commission.
Secretary Root voluntarily appeared
before the Senate committee on foreign
relations today and discussed the
entente between the I'nited States and
Japan in relation to the maintenance
of the integrity of China. Jle took the
position that the only obligation 011
ri:h?'i party to tthe understanding is that
they shall consult with each other before
undertaking any action concerning
Chinese affairs, and that therefore the
agreement does not assume the character
of a treaty. He cited j>recedents
for the executive laying down a policy
concerning foreign affairs.
Democratic members of the committee
pointed out that the only question at issue
is whether the understanding goes to the
"I ? Irraiy oil llie SilOjeet
necessary. If no action is taken by the
committee the matter will remain as negotiated
by the Secretary of State. The
question will be discussed by the members
of the committee at a later meeting.
Republicans Are United.
The republican members of the committee.
are united in supporting the position
taken by Mr. Rcot. and some of the democratic
members also favor non-action on
the part of tlie committee.
Another question taken up by Secretary
Root is the status of the commission appointed
to look after American interests
in connection with tiie Tokio exposition in
1!>17. In view of the postponement of the
exposition from 1012 it was prat ticallv decided
by the committee to recommend an
amendment to the law providing for the
continuance of the commission w.th nominal
salaries to serve us a nucleus of the
organization that will be necessary later,
but to continue one commissioner genera]
at a fair compensation. -If this action is
taken by Congress the nomination of the
commissioners named will be confirmed by
the Senate. ,

with sfde trips after animals and birds,
so as to come out a't tidewater, say.
about March 1. This would give me ten sli
months in Africa.

It has been the custom of tire District bi
Commissioners to grant leaves of ah- : J*_f
sence to temporary or per diem employes j
, under an act approved March 2, 1895. j m
which pro\ides "that the Commissioners tlr
are authorized, in tiieir discretion, to
grant leaves of absence, not to exceed j w
thirty days to any individual in any lis. al J jn
year, to regular employes not to exceed j jt|
thirty in number, annually appointed di- ;
rectly by tlie Conmnissiontrs and ? aiu ! vj
out of the general appropriation, whose as
service is continuous hut who r eeivt p.r j rn
diem compensation."
It appears to have been the practice j {n
heretofore that under this act for leaves j OI
of absence allowing not exceeding thirty
days each to thirty employes, the Commissloners
liave allotted a total <?f nine a(
hundred days among the various em- V.L
ployes of the District, without regard t<? at
then umber of employes sharing in the j
allotment, but in most instances exited
lag the number designate*! in tlie law. |
Corporation Counsel Thomas, 10 whom ..
the matter was referred, declared that the |
law mentioned limits the Commissioners
to the number of employes.
Auditor Tweedalo will at once reeont- ^
mend that tiie Commissioners urge legis- 01
lation at the present session of Congress .
providing for leaves of absence ami hoi;- .
days for temporary and per dieni employes.
t
Commissioner West says In favors such
a measure and he is satisfied it will meet J*,
with the approval of his colleagues.
Mr. Tweedale is of the opinion that the!
law does not relate to temporary per diem
employes, and the corporation counsel in |
his opinion states that the Commissioners re
have no authority by its provisions to j F0
divide tXiO days among the indefinite nuni- " ,
her of employes exceeding thirty in nuni- j
