John Sellers is the name of a very
eccentric farmer who lived three miles
east of New Philadelphia, O. He has
a flock of sheep that has not been
shorn for six years. The wool has
grown entirely over their eyes, and is
so long that it drags on the ground.
The sheep have the appearance from a
distance of big hay-shocks in the field.
Upon bein» asked why he did not
shear his sheep, Mr. Sellers replied:
"God put the wool on their back to
stay there and keep them warm and I
do not propose interfering with His
plans." The flock is a great curiosity,
and people come for miles around to
see the sheep. Mr. Sellers never
shaves or cuts kis hair or finger
nails. Stis hair hangs down his
back, and has the appearance of
never having been combed. His
whiskers arc !ong and shaggy, and
his general appearance is entirely dif
ferent from other men. He lives with
his sister, and owns a good farm. He
has never bought any improved farm
machinery, but all his tools are home

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE*
Fall Text of Preafdent Arthur's Mett
•age'tothe FortfEighth Con
gress, December -1, 1883.
To the Congress of the United States:
OX FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
At the threshold of your deliberations I con
gratulate you upon the favorable aspect of the
domestic and foreign affairs of this government.'
Our relations with other nations continue to be on
a friendly footing with the Argentine Republic,
Belgium, Austria, Brazil, Denmark, Hayti. Italy,
San Domingo and Sweden and Norway. No inci
dent has occurred which calls for comment. The
recent opening of a new line of telegraphic com
munication with Central America and Brazil per
mitted the interchange of messages of friendship
with the governments of those countries. Dur
ing the year there have been perfected
and proclaimed a consular and commer
cial treaty with Servia and. a consular
treaty with Roumania thus extending
our intercourse with the Danubian countries,
while our eastern relations have been placed up
on a wider basis by treaties with Corea and Mada
gascar. The new boundary survey treaties with
Mexico, the trades mark convention and a
supplementary treaty of extradition with Spain,
and a convention extending the duraUon of the
Franco-American claims of commission have
also been proclaimed. Notice of the termination
of the fisheries articles of the treaty of Wash
ington was duly given to the British government
The privileges and exemptions of the British
overnment and the reciprocal privileges and
•xemptions of the treaty wil' seemingly close on,
July 1st, 1885. The
FISHINO I.NDC8TRJ
pursued by a numerous class of our citizens of
the northern coasts both of the Atlantic and Pa
cific oceans, are worthy of the fostering care of
congress. Whenever brought into competion
with like industries of other countries, our risher
uif n, as well as our manufacturers of lis iing ap
pliances and preparers of fish products, have
maintained a foremost place. I suggest that
congress create a. commission to consider the
question of our rights iu the fisheries, and the
means of opening to our citizens, under just and
enduring conditions, the riclily stocked fish
ing waters and sealing grounds of British
North America. The question has arisen
'ouching the deportation of the United Slates
from the British Islands .by the government or
municipal aid of persons unable there to gain
a living and equally a liurden on the community
here. Such of these persons as will come under
the pauper class as defined by the law, have been
sent back according to the provisions of our
statutes here. Her Majesty's^ government has
insisted that precaution should nave been taken
l'fore shipment It has, however. in so
many cases proven ineffectual, and especially
iu certain instances of needy emigrants reach
ing our territory through Canada, that a revision
of our legislation upon this subject may be deemed
advisable. Correspondence relative to the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty has been continued and will be
laid before congress.
GERMANY'S PROHIBITION.
The legislation of France against the importa
tation of swine produced from the United State-,
has been retracted. The result has been due no
i.ss to the friendly representation of this govern
ment than to a growing conviction in France hat
the restriction is not demanded by danger to any
real health. Germany still wishes the introduc
tion of some products from America. 1
extended to the imperial government a
fi ieudly invitation to send experts to the United
states to inquire whether the use of these prod
acts was dangerous to health. This invitation
was declined. I have believed it of sucn impor
tance, however, that the exact facts should be
ascertained and promulgated that I have ap
pointed
A COMPETENT COMMISSION
to make a thorough investigation of the subject.
Its members have shown their public spirit by
accepting their trust without pledge of compen
sation, but I trust that congress will see into the
national and inter-national bearings of the matter
a sufficient motive of proceeding, at least for re
imbursement of suck expenses as they may nec
essarily incur.
THE CORONATION OF THE CZAR
at Moscow, afforded to this government an occas
ion for testifying to its continued friendship by
sending a special envoy and a representative of
cheuavvto attend the ctremoujr. While there
have arisen during the year, no grave issues af
fecting the status in tho Russian Empire «f Am
erican citizens of other faith than that held by he
National Church this government remaius firm
in its convictions that the rights of it~ citizens
abroad should be in no way affected by their re
ligious belief.
11 is understood that measures for the removal
of the restrictions which now burden our trade
with
CUBA AND PORTO RICA.
are under consideration by the Spanish govern
ment. The proximity of Cuba and the peculiar
method of administration which there prevail,
necessitate constant discussion and appeal on
our part from the proceding of the insular au
thorities. I regret to say that just protests of
this government have not as yet produced a sat
isfacto. result.
THE COMMISSION
appointed to decide certain clainys of our citizens
against that government, after the recognition of
a satisfactory rule as to their validity
was admitted, has been without avail. Full rep
aration to our citizens should tie no longer delay
ed. Some of the awards, though made more than
two years ago, have not yet been paid. The
specie payment is expected. Claims, to large
amounts, which were held by the late Commis
sion to be without its jurisdiction, '-=en
diplomatically promoted to tHc fapanish Gevern
ment. as the addition of '-'-e Colouist authorities
which has given ri«* io those claims.
TI*E CASE OF THE MASONIC
has not roacned a settlement The Manilla court
has found that the proceedings of which this gov
ernment has complained were authorized, and it
is hoped that the goveramant of Spain will not
withhold the speedy reparation which its sense of
Justice should impel it to offer for the unusual se
verity, and unjust action of its subordination of
colonial oflleirs. In "he case of this vessel the
Helvetian confederation has proposed the inaug
uration of a class of international treaties for the
deferment to arbitration of grain questions be
tween nations. This government has assented to
the proposed arbitration of such already with
Switzerland.
UNBEH THI TREATY OF BERLIN
liberty of conscience and olvil rights are assured
to all strangers in Bulgaria. As the United States
have no distinct conventional relations with that
country, and are not a party to the treaty, they
should, in my opinion, maintain diplomatio rep
resentation at Sofia for the improvement of in
tercourse and the proper protection of the many
American citizens who resort to that countrr as
missionaries and teachers. I suggest that I be
given authority to establish an agency and con
sulate at the Bulgarian capital. The United
States are now participating in a revision of the
tariff of the
OTTOMAN MTPIHE.
They have assented to the application of a license
tax of foreigners doing business in Turkey, but
have opposed the oppressive storage tax upon
petroleum entering toe ports of that country.
TUB GOVERNMENT OF THE KHEDIVE
has proposed that the authority of the mixed ju
dicial tribunal in Egypt be extended so as to cover
citizens of the Unltea States accused of crime,
who are now tried before consular courts. This
government is not indisposed to accept the change,
but believes that its terms should be submitted for
jriticism to the commission
the whole subject At no time
torv has there been more manifest need of close
and lasting relations with a neighboring state than
now exists
WITH RESPECT TO 1IEXIOO.
The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into
that country, shows by what has already been ac
complished, the vast reciprocal advantages which
aust attend the progress of its internal develop
ments. Tho treaty of commeroe and navigation
of 1848 has been terminated by the Mexican
government. The absence of convention en
gagements, the rights of our citizens In Mexico
now depend upon the domestic status of tha
republic. There have been instances of harsh
enforcement of the laws against our vessels and
citizens in Mexico, and of the denial of diplomatic
resort for their protection. The initial step to
ward a better understanding, has been taken in
the negotations by the commission authorized by
congress, of a treaty which is still before the sen-

ted States and Mexican soldiers fighting in
a common cause. The convention for the
RE-SDJIVET OF THE BOUNDARY
from the Rio Grande to tho Paciflo having been
ratified and exchanged, the preliminaiy reconsid
eration therein stipulated has been effected. It
now rests with congress to make provision for
completing the survey and re-setting the bound
ary monuments. A convention was signed with
Mexico, on July 18.1882, providing for the rehear
ing of the cases of Benj. Wells and the
AUKA BTLOU MINING COMPANY
in whose faror awards were made by the late
American and Mexican claims commission that
convention still awoltl the action of the senate.
Meanwhile, because of the charges of fraudulent
awards which have been made, a new comraisslr
is necessary, and the executive has directed the
suspension of pay of the distribution quota rz
celved from Mexico.

In this government attended al Caraccas,
the centennial celebration of the birth
of the illustrious Bolivar. At the same time the
inauguration of the statue of Washington in the
Venzuelar capital testified to the veneration in
which his memory is held there. Congress, at its
last session, authorized the executive to propose
to the Venzuelar government a reopening of the
awards of the mixed commission of Caraccas.
The departure from this country of the Venzuelar
minister had delayed the opening of negotiations
for reviving tte commission. This government
holds that until the re-establishment of a treaty
on this subjebt the Venzuelar government must
continue to make the payment provided for in the
convention of 1866.
There is ground for believing that the dispute
growing out of the unpaid obligations due from
Venezuela'and France will be satisfactorily ad
justed. The French Cabinet has proposed a oasis
of settlement which meets my approval, but as it
Involves a recasting of the annual quotos of the

by this government el extending our Interests
with the eastern nations, legations havejduriug
the past year, been established in Persia, Siam
and Corea. It is probable that permanent mis
sions of those countries will, ere long, be main
tained in the United States. A special embassy
from Siam is now on its way hither. Treaty re
lations with Corea were perfected by the ex
change at Siam on the 19th of May last of the
ratifications of the lately concluded convention,
and envoys from the king of Tohihasur have
visited this country and received a cor
dial welcome. Corea,- as yet unacquainted with
the methods of western civilization, now invites
the attention of those interested in the foreign
trades, as it needs the implements and products
which the United States are ready to supply. We
seek no monopoly of its commerce, and no advan
tage over other nations but as
THE CHINESE,
in reaching for a higher civilization, have confid
ed in this republic, we cannot regard with indif
ference any encroachments on their rights. China,
the payment of a money indemnity, has settled
certain of the long pending claims of our citizens,
and I have strong hopes that- the remainder wili
soon be adjusted. Questions have arisen touching
the rights of American and other foreign manu
facturers in China under the provisions of treaties
which permits aliens to exercise their industries
in that country. On this specific point our own
treaty is silent, but under the operation of the
most favored nation's ause, we have like privi
leges with those of oiher powers. While it is the
duty of the governvnent to see that our citizens
have the full enjoyment of every benefit secured
by the treaty, I doubt if the movement to con
strain China to admit an interpretation which we
have only one indirect right to exact. The trans
ference to China of imerican capital for the em
ployment there of Chinese labor, would in effect
inaugurate a competition for the central markets
now supplied by our home industries. There is
good reason to believe that the low restriction
and the immigration of the Chinese has been vio
lated intentionally, or otherwise.by the officials of
China, upon whom is devolved the duty of cer
tifying that the immigrants belong to the except
ed class. Measures have been taken to ascertain
the facts incident to this supposed infrac
tion, and it is believed that the government of
China will co-operate with the United States in se
curing the faitnful observance of the law. The
same considerations which promoted congress at
the last session to
RETURN TO JAPAN
the Simoneski indemnit^"# seems to me, to requlr#
at its hands like action in respect to the Cantou
indemnity fund, now amounting to 8300,000. The
question to the general revision of the foreign
treaties of Japan, nan been considered in an inter
national conference, held at Lares, but without
definite result as yet This governnieut Is dispos
ed to concede the requests of Japan to determine
its own tariff duties, provided such proper judi
cial tribunals as may commend themselves to the
western powers for the trial of causes to which
foreigners and parties, and to assimilate
the term
and duration of its treaties to those of other civ
ilized states. Through our ministers at London n»d
at Monrovia, t-bi» government has endeavored to
AID LIBERIA
in its differences with Great Britain, touching the
northwestern boundaries of that republic. There
are prospects of the adjustment of the dispute by
the adoption of tho Waunah river as the line. This
arrangement is a compromise of the conflicting
international claims and takes from Liberia some
territory. Rivers have been opened an steam
boats placed on the rivers and the nuclei of states
established a* 22 statiops, under one flag at which
otTwrs are made to freedom, to commerce and
prohibits slave trade. The rich and popular
valley of the Congo is being opened to commerce
by a society called the
INTERNATIONAL AFRICAN ASSOCIATION
of which the king of the Belgians is president,
and a citizen of the United States the chief ex
ecutive officer, and large tracts of territory have
been ceded to the association by native chiefs.
In view of the
FREQUENCY OF INVITATIONS
from foreign governments to participate in social
and scientific congress for the discussion of im
portant matters of general concern, I repeat the
suggestion of my last message that provision be
made for the exercise of discretionary power by
the executive in appointing delegates to such con
ventions.
OUR PETROLEUM EXPORTS
are hampered in Turkey and other eastern ports
by restrictions as to storage
and by onerous taxa
tion. For these mischiefs adequate relief
is not always provided by reciprocity trtatr
les like that of Hawaii or that lately negotiated
with Mexico and now awaiting action of the lea
ate. Is it not advisable to provide some mea-ure
of equitable relation in relations with governments
which discriminate against our ownt If, for ex
ample, tha executive were empowered to apply
t'j Spanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba nd
Porto Rico the same rules of treatment aud sra.e
of penalties for technical faults which are applied
our vessels and cargoes in the Antilles, a
resort to that course might not Le barren
of Ttod result".

FISCAL YBAB 1885.
If the revenues for the
fiscal year which will end
on June 30,1885, be estimated upon the basis of ex
isting laws, the secretary is of the opinion that for
that year the receipts will exceed $60,000,000. The
ordinary expenditures including the amount de
voted to the sinking fund hitherto, and all surplus
as rapidly as it has accumulated,has been devoted
to the
tt
SEDUCTION OF THE NATIONAL DEBT.
As a result the only bonds now outstanding which
are redeemable at tho pleasure of the government
and 1907 respectively.
years before any of the four and one-half per
cents can be called in. The latter at the same
rate of accumulation of surplus can be
PAID AT MATURITY,
and the monies requisite for the redemption of
the 4 per cents will be in the treasury many years
before these obligations become payable. There
are cogent reasons, however, why the national ia
debtedness should not be thus rapidly extinguish
ed. Chief among them is the fact that only
through excess of taxation is such rapidity at
tainable.
In a communication to congress at its last ses
sion I recommended that ail excise taxes be
abolished except those relating to distilled spirits,
and that substantial reduction also be made in
the revenues from customs. A statute has since
been enacted by which the annual tax and tariff
receipts of the government have been cut down to
the extent of at least fifty or sixty millions of dol
lars. While I have no doubt that still farther re
ductions may be wisely made, I do
not advise the
adoption at this
session of any measures for large
diminution of national revenues. The results of
the legislation of the late session of congress have
not
must elapse
fore the effects of the act of March 8d 1883 can be
definitely ascertained.
The probable effect of such an extensive retire
ment of the securities which are the basis of the
national bank circulation, would be such a con
traction of the volume of currency as to produce
fangercommercial
rave embarrassments. How can the
be obviated The most effectual plan and
one whose adoption at the earliest practical op
portunity I shall heartily approve, has already
ueen Indicated, if the revenues of the next four
years shall be kept substantially commensurate
with the expenses. The volume of circulation
will not be likely to suffer any material disturb
ance, but if on the other hand there shall be great
delay in reducing taxation, it will become neces
sary either to substitute some other form of cur
rency in place of the national bank notes, or to
make important changes in the law by which
their circulation is now controlled.
In my judgment the latter course is far prefer
abl e. I commend to your attention the very in
teresting and thoughtful suggestions on this sub
ject which appear in the secretary's report. The
objections wliich he urges against the acceptance
of any other securities than tbe obligations of the
§ank
overnment itself, as the foundation for national
circulation, seem to me insuperable. For
advocating the threatened contraction, two
courses have been suggested, either of which is
probablv feasable. One is the ifs uance of new
bonds having many years to run, bearing a low
rate of interest and exchangeable upon specified
terms of those now outstanding
The other course which presented itself to my
own judgment as the better one, is the enactment
of a law repealing the tax on circulation, and
permitting the banks to issue notes for vou at an
amount equal to 9 per cent of the market value,
instead of as now the full value of the
deposited bonds. agree with the secre
tary in the belief that the adoption of this plan
will afford the necessary relief.
THE TRADE DOLLAR
was coin ed for the purpose of traffic in countries
where silver passed at Its value as cost ascer
tained by its weight and fineness. It never had a
legal tender quality. A large number of those
coins entered, however. Into the volume of our
currency. By common consent their circulation
has now ceased in the United States
Because a disturbing element, they shoul not be
longer permitted toembarrass our currency sys
tem. I recommend that proyls'on be ma !e for
their reception bv the treasury and mints, as
bullion at a small percentage above the curi eut
market pri -es of silver of like fineness. The Sec
retary of the Treasury advises a consolidation of
certain of the customs districts of the conniry,
and snpgests that the president be vested with
Rich power in relation thereto as is now given
him in H-port of Collectors of Internal revenue,
Sect on 3141 of the revised statutes.
The statistios on the subject which are contained
in his report furnish of themselves a strong argu
ment in defense of his views. At the adjournment
of congress the number of
INTERNAL REVENUE COLLECTION
districts was 128. By executive orders dated Juno
25 18?3. I directed that certain of these districts
be consolidated. The result has been a reduction
of one-third their number which at present is but
83. From the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR
it will be seen that in only a single instance has
there b«en any disturbance of the quiet condition
of our Indian tribes a raid from Mexico into Arizo
na by a small party of Indians which was pursued
bv ("Jen. Crook into the mountain regions from
which it had come. It is confidently hoped that
serious outbreaks will not ngain occur, and that
the Indian tribes which have for so many years
di-turhed the west will hereafter remain in peace
able submission.
I again call your attention to tbe present condi
tion of our extended sea coast, upon which are so
many large cities, whose wealth and importance
to the country would, in time of war, invite _at
Uct. from modern armored ships, against which
our existing defensive works could give no ade
(jiiBte protection. These works were built before
tile introduction of modern heavy rifled guns into
maritime warfare and if they are not put in an
efficient condition, we may easily be subjeoted to
humiliation, by a hostile power greatly inferior
to ourselves. As germane to this subject, I call
your attention to the importance of perfecting
our
SUB-MARINE TORPEDO DEFENSES.
The board authorized by the last congress to re
port on the method which should be adopted for
the manufacture of heavy ordnances adapted to
mixlern warfare has visted the principal iron and
steel works in this country and Europe. It is
hoped that its report will be soon made and that
congress will thereupon be disposed to provide
suitable facilities and plans for the manufacture
of such guns as are now imperatively needed.
On several occasions during the past year officers
of the nrmy have, at the request of the state
authorities, visitedf their military encampments
f. inspection of the troops. From the reports
of these officers I am induced to believe that tho
encouragement of state militia organization by
the national government would be followed by
very gratifying results, and would afford it in
sudden emergencies the aid of a large body of
volunteers educated in the performence of mili
tary duties. The secretary of
THE NAVY,
reports that under the authority of the acts of
August 5th, 18&!, and March 3d, 1883, the work of
strengthening our navy by the construction of
modern vessels has been auspioiously be£yj
Three cruisers are in progress of oonsti
the ductibiUt»-prescribed by law, and in combin
ation cf opeed, endurance and armanent, are ex
pected to compare favorably with the best un
armed war vessels of other nations. A fourth
vessel, the "Dolphin," is to be constructed of sim
ilar material and is intended to serve as a fleet
disnatch boat.
The double turreted monitors, Puritan, Ample
rate and Terror, have been launched on the Dela
ware river, and a contract has been made for the
supply of their machinery. A similar one, the
Monadrosk, has been launched In California.
The naval advisory board and the secretary re
commend the completion of the monitors, the
construction of four gun boats, and also of three
additional steel vessels like the Chicago, Boston,
and Dolphin, as an Important measure of national
defense. The secretary urges also the immediate
creation of an interior fast line of water ways
across the peninsula of Florida, along the coast
from Florida to Hampton Roads, between the
Chesepeake Bay and Delaware river, and through
Cape Cod.
I feol bound to impress upon the attention of
congress the necessity of coutinued progress in
the construction of the navy. The condition of
the public treasury, as I have already inlim ited,
makes the present an auspicious time for pntting
this branch of service in a state of efficiency. It
is no part of ourpolicv to create and maintain a
navy able to cope with that of the other great
powers of the world.
We have no wish for foreign conquest and the
peace which we have long enjoyed is in no seem
ing Manger of interruption. But that our naval
strength should be made adequate for the
defense
of our harbors, the protection of our commercial
interests, and the maintenance of our national
honor, is a proposition from which DO patriotic
citizen can withhold his assent.
THE REPORT OF THE POSTMASTER GENERAL
contains a gratifying exhibit of the condition and
prospects of the interesting branch of the public
service committed to his care.
The whole number of postoffices was 47,863, of
which 1.633 were established during the previous
fiscal year. The number of offices operating un
der the system of free delivery was 154. At these
latter offices the postage on mall matter amount
ed to $4,195,230.52, a sum exceeding by $1,031,894.04
the entire cost of the carrier's servioe in the coun
try. The rate of postage on drop letters passing
tlirough these offices is now fixed by law at
TWO CENTS PER HALF OUNCE,
or fraction thereof. In offices where tho
carrier system has not been established
the rate is only half as large. It
will be remembered that in 1^63. when free de
livery was first established by law, the uniform
single rate of postage upon local letters was one
cent, and so it remained until 18?3, when in those
cities where carrier service was established, it
was increased to defray the expense of such serv
ice. It seems to me that the old rate may now,
with propriety, be restored, and that, too, even
at the risk of diminishing for a time, at least, re
ceipts from postage upon local letters. I can see
no reason why that particular class of mail mat
ter should be held accountable for
the entire cost of not only its
own collection an delivery, but the collection
and delivery of all other classes, and I am confi
dent, after full consideration of the subject, that
the reduction of the rate would be followed by
such a growth of business as to occasion but slight
and teinporary loss to the revenue of the post
office. The Postmaster-General devotes much of
his report to the consideration on its various as
pects of the
RELATION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO THE TELE
Such reflection as I have been able to give to the
subject since my last annual message has not ie 1
me to change tne view which I then expressed in
dissenting from the recommendation of the Post
master General, that the government assume the
same control over the telegraph which it has al
ways nad over the mails. Admitting that its
authority in tbe premises is as ample as has ever
been claimed for it, it would not, in my judgment,
be wise to purchase or assume the control of ex
isting telegraph lines, or to construct others with
a view of entering into general competition with
prlvato enterprise.
The objections which may be justly urged
against either of these projects, and indeed
against any system which would require au
enormous increase in the civil service, do.not how
ever apply to some of the plans which have lately

public commnnt and discussion. It has
een claimed, for example, that congress might
wisely authorize the post master to contract with
6ome private person or corporation for the trans
mission of messages, at specified rates and under
government supervision. Various schemes of
the same general nature, but widely differing in
their special chacteristlcs, have been suggested in
the public prints, and the arguments uv which
they have been supported and opposed have
doubtless attracted your attention.
It is likely that the whole subject will be con
sidered by you at the present session. In the na
ture of things it involves so many questions of
detail that your deliberations would probably be
aided slightly, if at all, by any particular sugges
tions which I might now submit I vow my belief,
however, that the government should be author
ized to exercise court supervision over inter-state
telegraph communication, and I express the hope
that for attaining that end some measure be adopt
ed which will receive your approval.
The attorney general criticises in his report the
provisions of the existing law, fixing the
FEES OF JURORS AND WITNESSES
in the federal courts. These provisions are
chiefly contained in the act of February 26.1853.
Though some of them were introduced into the
action from statutes which had been passed many
years previous, it is manifest that such compen
sation as might, when these laws were enacted,
have been just and reasonable, would in many
instances be justly reminded at the present day
as Inadequate. I concur with the attorney gen
eral in the belief that the statutes should be re

So also should the laws regulating the compensa

could be paid wholly by salary Instead in part by
fees as is now the case. The change would prove
to be
A MEASURE OF ECONOMY,

feared have in some instances been conducted for

Much Interest and valid information is contained

particularly call your attention to certain phases
of
THE INDIAN QUESTION,
to his recommendation for the repeal of the pre
emption of timber culture acta, and for more
strict legislation lo prevent fraud under the pension
laws. The statute which prescribes by definition
and punishment of crimes relating £o pensions
could doubtless be made more effectual by certain
amendments and additions pointed out in the
seeking' to suppress, and mat its
effort in that regard will be more likely to en
counter the opposition than receive their encour
agement and supportEven if this view should hap
pily be erroneous the law under which the commis
sioners have been acting should be made more
effective by the incorporation of some such

I tiustthat congress will not fail at its pres

ALASKA
under the protection of our laws. Its people
have repeatedlv demonstrated against our
neglect to afford them the maintenance and pro
tection expressly guaranteed by the terms of the
treaty, whereby the territory was ceded to the
United States. For sixteen years they have
pleaded iu vain for that which they should have
received witnout asking. They have no law fur
the collection of debt, the support of education,
the conveyance of proierty, the administration
of states or the enforcement of contracts. None
indeed for the punishment of criminals except
such as are offered as against certain customs of
commerce and navigation acts.
The resources of Alaska, especially in fur
mines and lumber, are considerable in extent
and capable of large development while its geo
graphical situation is one of political and com
mercial importance. The promptings of interest
therefore, as well as considerations of honor an-t
good faith, demand the immediate establishment
of civil government iu thi't territory.
Complaints have lately beeu general and urgent
that certain corporations, controlling in whole or
in part the facilities for the inter state carriage
of persons and merchandise over the great rail
roads of the country, have resorted, in their deal
ings with the people, to divers measures, unjust
and oppressive in their character. In some instan
ce) the state forts have attacked and suppressed
these evils, but in others thev have been unable to
afford adequate relief because of the jurisdiction
al limitations which are imposed upon them by
5he federal constitution. The question, how far
the national government should interfere in the
premises, and what, if any, supervision of control
it ought to exercise, is ons which merits your
careful consideration. While we can't fail to
recognize the importance of the
VAST RAILWAY SYSTEMS
of the country, and their great help and benefit
to the development of our material wealth, we
should, on the other hand, remember that no in
dividual and no coloration cuglit to te' vested
with absolute power over the interest of any other
citizens or class of citizens. Tke right of those
railway corporations to award any profitable re
turn upon their investments, and to reasonable
freedom their regulation, must bo recognized,
but it seems only just that so far as its constitu
tional authority will permit, congress should pro
tect ihe people at large In their inter-state traffic
against acts of Injustice which the state govern
ment are powerless to prevent.
PROTECTION OF FORESTS.
In my last annual message I called attention to
the necessity of protecting, by suitable legisla
tion, the forests situated on the public domains in
numerous portions of the west The pursuit of
general agriculture is only made practicable by
resort tolrrigation. While successful irrigation
would be Impossible without the aid afforded by
forests in contributing to the regularity and cus
tomary supply of water, during the past year se
vere suffering and great loss of property hsve
been occasioned by profuse floods, followed by
periods of unusually low water. In many of the
great rivers of the country these irrigations were
fn a great measure caused by the removal from
about the sources of the streams in question the
timber by which the water supply had been nour
ished and protected. Tbe preservation of such
portion of the forests on the national domain as
essentially contribute to the'flow of Important
water courses, is of the highest. consequence. Im
portant tributaries of the Missouri, the Columbia
and Saskatchewan rise in the mountains of Mon
tana, near the northern boundary of the Uniwd
States, between tlie Black Feet and Flat Head In
dian reservations. This region is unsuitable for
settlement, but upon the rivers which flow from it
depend the future agricultural development of a
vast tract of country. Tho attertlon of congress
is called to the necessity of withdrawing from the
public sale this part of the public domain and es
tablishing there a forest preserve.

CIVIL SERVICE.
The commissioners were appointed under the
act of July 16, 1883, entitled "an act to regulate
aud Improve the civil service of the United
States," entered promptly upon tho discharge of
these duties. A series or rules framed in accord
ance with the spirit of the statute, was approved
and promulgated by tho president. In soiue par
ticulars, wherein they seemed defective, those
rules were subsequently amended. It will bo
ceived that they disoountenanco any politic-i
religious tests for admission to the officer of
public service to which tho Ft
utes relates. The act is limited
in its original application to the classified clerk
ship In the several executive departments at
Washington, numbering about 5,600, and to sim
ilar positions in custom districts and post offices.
Whi-re-as many as fifty persons are employed a
clnssificatiou of the positions analogous to that
existing in the Washington offices was duly made
before the law went into effect. Eleven custom
districts and twenty-three post offices were thus
brought under the immediate operation of tbe
smtnte. The annual report of the civil service
commission which will soon be submitted to con
gress will doubtless afford the measure of a
more definite judgment than I am now
prepared to expose as to the merits of
the new system. I am persuaded that Us
effects have thus far proved beneficial
Practical methods appear to bo adequate for the
ends proposed and there has been no serious diffi
culties In carryingthem into effect. Si»ce the 16th
of July last, no person, so far as I am aware, has
been appointed to the public service in the classi
fied portion thereof at any of the departments or
at any of the post offices and customs districts
above named, except those certified by the com
mittee to be competent on the basis of the exam
ination held in conformity to rules.
At the timewhen the present executive enteral
upon his office, his death, removal, resignation, or
inability to discharge his duties, would have lei
the government without a constitutional head.
It is possible, of course, that a similar contin
the wisdom of con

will now, I trust, commend itself to tho approval
of both nouses of congress. The clause oi the
constitution upon which must depend any law
regulating tha
PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION,
presents also for solution other questions of para
mount importance. These questions relate to the
proper interpretation of the plirase "inability to
tlischaige the powers and duties of said office."
Our organic law provides that when the president
shall suffer from such nability, instantly the pres
idential offloo shall devolve upon the vloe presi
dent who must himself undertake the duties of
the office. Circumstances give place to such offi
cer as congress may by law appoint to act as
president I need not hero setforth numerous and
interesting lnqulrios which are suggested by these
these .words of the constitution. They were
fully stated In my first communication
to congress and have since been subject of fre
quent deliberations in that body. It is greatly to
be hoped that these momentous questions will
find speedy solution lest emergencies may rise
when longer delay will be Impossible to any deter
mination, albeit, the wisest may furnish cause for
anxiety and alarm for the reasons fully stated in
my last annual message.
1 repeat my recommendation that congress
propose an amendment to that pro
vision of the constitution which prescribed
that the formalities for the enaotmeut of laws
whereby, in respeot to bills for the appropriation
of public moneys, the executive may be enabled,

stitution confers the rights of citizenship upon
all persons bora or naturalised in the United
States, and subject to the Jurisdiction there
of. It was the. speolal purpose of this
amendment to insure members of the
oolored race the full enjoyment of olvil
and political rights. Certain statutory provisions
intended to seoure the enforcement of those
rights have been recently deolared unconstitu
tional by the supreme oourt. Any legislation
whereby congress may lawfully supplement the
guarantees which the constitution affords for
equ enjoyment by all the citizens of the United

Simpson, who was known for. her
peculiarities and her wealth. She own

other valuable pieces of property
about the city. Sne made her home at
Soho, where the Catholic Church now
stands. It was her habit to go about
Jthe city in an elegant carriage, attend
ed by a diiver and a footman, and be
side her she always had at least half
a dozen pet dogi, dressed in all sorts
of colors. In the latter part of 1868
she died, leaving a very peculiar will,
whieh provided, among other things,
for a trust fund to be used to purchase
food and protection for her pet dogs.
She directed that 50 cents a week
should be expended by her executor,
William Hoffman, for the purpose of
buyingmeat and food for each of the
dogs. The provisions of the will have
been strictly adhered to by the execu
tor, who has just filed his final ac
count, which shows a balance in his
hands of $172.43. Mr. George Burg

in filing the account, that the last dog
was dead, and the trust was, therefore,
at an end, hence the desire, of the
executor to file his account »nd be dis-

All the Year R«und.
Though there is every pro
that California's big tree will maintain
its supremacy as the most massive
column in the world's forests, it must
perforce yield the palm of altitude to
the Australian eucalyptus. In the val
ley of the Watts River, in Victoria,
many fallen trees hare been measured
as they lie on the ground, and found
to exceed 350 feet in length. One
mighty giant had fallen so as to form
abridge across a deep ravine. It had
been broken in falling, but the portion
which remained intact measured 435
feet in length, and as its girth at the
pcint of fracture is nine feet, its dis
coverer estimates that the perfect tree
must have measured fully five hundred
feet. Its circumference, five feet above
the roots, is fifty-four feet. Another
gum tree on Mount Wellington was
jound to be 102 feet in girth at three
eet from th ground. Its height could
not be estimated, dwiagto the density
jo the forest. But its next neighbor,
which was ninety feet in ciroumfer-
". W^Ptfe
ence, was found to
be 300 feet in height
In the Dandenong district of Victoria
an almoud-leaf gum tree (eucalyptus
amygdalina) has been carefully mean
ured, and is found to be 430 feet in
height. It rises 380 feet before throw
ing out a branch its circumference is
sixty feet. Tasmania also produces
specimens of eucalyptus which are
350 feet in height and which rise 200
feet ere forming a branch. One near
Hobart Town is ninety-six feet in
girth, and, ten years ago, towered to
a height of 300 feet, but is nowa ruin.
The question of supremacy, is how
ever, confined to altitude, for the un
tidy looking eucalyptus, with it* rag
ged and tattered gray bark hanging
about it in such slovenly fashion, can
never contest the palm of mighty or
majesty with the stately cedars, whose
magnificent golden red shafts tower
on high like the fluted marble column^

LIFE IN A BLACK HASS TANK.
Men the Pinny Tribe Disport Them*
sclvcit ina Worldol'Limited Dlmeu-
ftiOIlH.
American Field.
Mr. Thomas Rinek, of Easton
Penn., has fitted up a tank with a
perpetual How of water, and has
placed in it a number of bass which
he was fortunate enough to capture
from the Delaware. Tlie two largest
weighed respectively three pounds
and seven ounces, aud the latter four
pounds two ounccs. The latter's fins
and tail are very ragged and torn,
owing to a fierce attack made on him
shortly after he was put in by the
former. But the relations between
•ill of them have since been amicable
The largest one, after a few days'
confinement, made a determined
effort to escape, and jumped with such
persistency and force that he loosened
the wire gauze over the tank from its
fastenings, and damaged his mouth
to such a.n exlent that he carried it
open three-fourths of an inch for over
two weeks, and it interferred material
ly with the comfort of his feeding.
Thtiy fed very deliberately, and their
favorite food seems to be young cat
fiih. When one of these is put into
the tauk they will sort of point it,
following its movements rather with
their eyes, but never remitting this
deliberate pursuit, and it is often a
long while before they make an as
sault. The catfish instinctively
recognize their danger, and im
mediately begin their tactios of de
fense. These are limited to turning
tail to their enemy and keeping their
heads in the bottom corners of the
tank and under favoring stones. As
Jong as they can hold this position
they are conparatively safe, as the
bass will rarely touch them except
head first.
5
Recently a catfish somewhat oVer
three inches long, by his skirmish
ing, evaded the largest bass for several
minutes, and dually got his head well
sheltered under a favoring stone. The
bass, after several futile efforts to
dislodge it. at last took it by the tail,
dre«v it out, and swam leisurely
around the tank several times wittt
it, when, giving it a sudden toss, he
caught it by the head.
SAGACIOUS MULES.
How They Behave Under Ground In
Mine* and Tunncla.
Mules seem to be more useful about
mining operations than horses. In
running an arastra a mule is much
better than horses. He will get sly
and shrink work if he can by going
very slowly, but may be encouraged
by rocks and other mis'-ilen to quicken
his pace. He will stand this tread
mill work well, and thrive ou it,
wr.ile the nobler animal will wear
out.
Underground the mule is preferable
in many ways, aud these animals are
generally used there instead of horses.
They are intelligent, and if they fall,
and are entangled, are apt to lie quiet
ly while being released instead of
kicking and thrashing about to their
own injury, as a horse will do. Some
people have a prejudice against them,
alleging their tendency to kick, but
under ground they do not seem to do
that, whatever may be the case above.
They become very tame when under
ground. Mr. Sutro describes those in
use at the famous tunnel, as having
become the miners' pets. He says the
men become attached to them, and as
the shaft mules pass alongby the men
at lunch, edibles are given them.
When signal is given to fire a blast
the mules understand the signal, and
will try to get out of the way of it
just as the men do. Of course, the
mules become accustomed to the dark
ness, and in going out into the sun
light can not see very well, and when
they go back from the sunlight into
the tunnel they can not see at all. At
the Sutro Tunnel they are in the habit
of covering one eye of the mule until
they go into the tunnel again, when
the cloth is removed, s« they have one
good eye to see with. This plan had
to be adopted, because the mule is so
stubborn that he will not null unless
he can see his way ahead. At tiiis
place another thing was found out
about mules. They tried horses at
first, but found that whenever any
thing touched the ears of a horse he
would throw up his nose and knock
his head against the roof but if you
touch a mule's ears he drops his head.
The horses were given up, and mulet
answered very well.
A Remarkable Man.
A Geneva correspondent writes:
"A man who, by dint of sheer courage
and energy overcame almost insuper
able difficulties aud showed that life,
even when it seems almost a curse,
may well be worth living,died recent
ly at A.rare, in thi Canton of Geneva,
Switzerland. Jean Trottet, the man
in question, was born in 1831, without
hands and without feet. His short
arms were pointed, aud his legs, such
as they were, not being available for
progression, lie was able to move only
by twisting his body from side to side.
His case greatly interested the sur
geons of the neighborhood, and local
Barnums made tne parents, well-to-do
peasants many tempting offers to turn
the child's misfortune to account by
exhibiting him about the country.
But these offers were inevitably de
clined, and when Jean was old enough
he was sent to school. In writing he
held his pen at the bend of the elbow.
As he grew older he took a great in
terest iu husbandry, became an active
hay-maker, used the reins with dexter
ity, and was so good a shot that he of
ten carried off the prize at the village
tirs. He enjoyed, too, some reputa
tion for sagacity, was consulted by hui
neighbors on matters of importance
ana has left behind him a widow and
four children amply provided for.
