Other Roads Blasted.
THREE JUSTICES IN DISSENT.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dee. 14.—1n
Ml opinion by Justice Holmes, the su
' mme court of the United States today
Idd that E. 11. Harriman and Otto
jvahn. the latter a New York broker,
jhould not he required to answer the ia
(erstatc commerce commission's qnes
) ions concerning dealings in stocks be
tween the Union Pacific and other roads
t.i which they refused to make response
when the subject was under investiga
tion in New York. Construing the de
cision of the i "iirt in a dissenting opin
ion. Justice Day expressed the opinion
that tin- construction given the inter
state commerce law takes from It all
power of investigation.
Cross Appeals Filed.
The case came to the supreme court
on cross appeals by Harriman and the
government from a decision of the circuit
c.uirt of the Dulled States for the south
ern district of New A ork, holding that
Mr. Harriman should be compelled to
make response to most of the quest ions.
It nr in eoiuieetinn with the order of
the coiiinJssiou of November 15, 1001*,
din ) ting mi inquiry into the combine
1 1> >u of the I'niiui Dacitic road with such
ether lines as the Southern Pacific, the
All-bison, Topeka A Santa Fe, the
Northern Dacitic. the Great Northern,
the Illinois Central, the Chicago & Al
ton and the New York Central, Ibis or
tier was very sweeping in character ami
intended to develop the facts regarding
tin' community of interest between the
Dnion Dacitic and other roads, the prae
l Sees and methods of the roads, I lie rates
reeeived. etc. It was also hoped that
it would bring out the facts regarding
the inmsfi r ol other stocks in the Inion
I ’aeitie.
When Mr. Harriman was put on the
stand, he ilcelined, in response to a ques
ion, to say whether he had owned any of
the Chicago A Alton stock which was
purchased hy the Inion pacific and the
price of whieli had been fixed by him
self; wild her a portion of the stock ol
the Illinois Central had been acquired
by a pool of which he was a member
with the view to selling it to the Union
Dacibe; atnl whether the Inion Pacific
lireciors wire interested in tint New
A ork Central stock which was acquired
by the Inion Pacitie. He also declined
to state bow much of the stock of the
.Atchison, Topeka A Saute Fe was owned
by director of the Inion I ’aeitie.
Answer Order by Appeal.
The circuit court directed Mr. Harri
man to reply to these questions, and be
responded by appealing to the supreme
court.
The appeal "1 the government from
the decision of the court was based
upon the refusal of the lower court to
compel Mr. Hurriman to answer a ques
tion as to whether he hud purchased
slock in the Union Pacific in aulieipa
lion of an increased dividend. There

AMENDS BILL FOR RE-ENLISTMENT.
WASHINGTON. D. C.. Dec. 14.-
Senntnr Ft raker today introduced an
amendment to the bill providing for the
rc-cnlistment of the negro troops dis
■linrged without honor because of al
leged participation in the affray at
Brownsville, Tex., and addressed the
Senate concerning the amendment. He
proposes in his new measure to estab
lish a tribunal consisting of retired army
officers, naming these officers in (he bill,
before w hom evidence may he submit- j
led as to the guilt of defendant- and he- j
lore whom the defendants themselves
might appear to answer to charges. The
measure is so drawn as practically to .
lak ■ out of the hands of the c\ ■cutive
and give to a tribunal appointed by Con
gress full authority to consider the
Brownsville question and by its findings
provide for the rc-cnlistmeat ol the dis
charged negroes.
New Investigation Necessary.
In addressing the Senate Air. Foraker
mid it was an elementary proposition in
American law that the accused may |
have an opportunity to confront the ac- i
■user and to appear in person and an- j
tnver with evidence. He said that he 1
md not expected it would he necessary !
(i enter upon anew investigation of the
Brownsville question, hut that during 1
he summer letters had hcea coming to
aim from these discharged negro sol
liers declaring that detectives were con
stantly engaging them in conversation.
‘These men.” said Senator Foraker,
’are not secret service detectives of
curse, for they would have no right
under (he law to engage i.i such service.” j
President’s Message Read.
“Dpon the conclusion of Mr. Forakcr’s
remarks, Mr. Culberson asked that the
President's message on the Brownsville I
iff air be read and Vice President Fatr
lanks directed that that be done, till the
senators present remaining in their |
-eats find listening attentively to the
reading.
After the reading of the President's
message, which was brief, had been con
cluded, the clerk read all of the state- ,
incuts and other evidence' submitted to i
:he war department for which the I‘resi- {
hail's message was merely a letter of
transmittal. This is contrary to the
tsital custom. Ordinarily the general
rep uts are -■ nt to tic- propt r e mimic |
tee without the formality of reading. In
view of the fact that the report con
tains what purports to he a partial con
fession of guilt by one if the discharged
negro soldiers much interest was shown
in the reading.
