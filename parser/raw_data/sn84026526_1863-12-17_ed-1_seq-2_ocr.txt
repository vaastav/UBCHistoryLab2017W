THUBSPAY, DECEMBER 17, 1863.
TJUo News
From Virginia there ii littlt of interest to report.
It if rimored that the enemy are about to make a
raid o the Va. aad Tenn, railroad frem the West.
If change to note of affairs ia this State.
At Charleston the enemy continue to shell the
itj occasionally vrithontdoiBg any serious barm.
Their bombardment of omr ferU also coatiaues, but
It effects aothing.
There are important rumors afloat from the West.
It is said tiat the Yankee arm had evaouated Chat
tanooga, falling back to Nashville for vr iater quar
ters, and thaw SO.onfj of this force would be sent
to the army, of the Potomao, of -which Grant vras
to take the command. This looks somewhat rea
senaVle and in all probability has truth in it.
Longatreet is considered safe, and was taking his
ewn time in falling back towards Virginia.
Northern news is interesting in some particulars.
We give elsewhere a batch, among which Lincoln's
message will attract attention from the singular af
rrontry with which he portrays and dictate to his
hirelings.,
Jff It will be noticed from the Captions of
the Acts passed by the Legislature at its late
session, that the wholesale squandering of the
pablie funds to partisan officials, is far from bo.
ing all the money appropriated by that, remark
able body. JFar from it. It has authorized the
increase of the State debt some two millions of
dollars, besides making appropriations of sever
al millions more, which will deubtless be raised
in such a manner as to add this much to the
permanent debt of the State.
Now the people would do well to remember
that the State debt is already large .enough.
The burden it creates is now a heavy one, and
besides this, every dollar of it will ono day
have to be paid in coin or a currency equal in
alue to gold. This is emphatically true.
But notwithstanding all this, the Legislature
has, from the time it first assembled added very
largely te the public debt, apparently without
even looking to the future, or considering when
and ho w the debt created was to be paid. Its
action in this particular is not surprising when
we bring to mind the course pursued on the
sasae sabjeet during previous sessions. It is
nothing more than the people may expect, and
we can only regret that it is but a short time,
until it will resume the business of enlarging
the debt due by the State, of legislating in fa
ter of itself and its partisan adherents, and do
ing rery little of real benefit to the State at
large. . , .
Its general action is in striking contrast to
the doings of the Legislature of Georgia, now
in session.- An item concerning the manner in
whioh oar Southern sister State is proceeding
will be found in the following ea tract
Both Houses bare passed the general tax bill
containing a clause exempting two thousand
dollars worth of property belonging to soldiers
levied a tax on all other property not exceed
ing one per cent. It is estimated th&t the tax
will raise twelve millions of dollars, this with
the increased tax oa . the Slate Road will pay
the expenses f the State Government, without
further increasing the indebtedness.
Georgia resolves to pay as she goes.

The President's Mess aqb, The reader is
referred, to a compendium of the President's
Message ia this paper. We regret that the
length of this interesting document prevents us
from giving it entire. Like all similar papers
of President Davis, it bears unmistakeabl
marks of ability, and a thorough insight - into
all the intricate details of our common govern
ment. His suggestions are very important and
will doubtless be endorsed and acted upon bv
Congress with that unanimity which has hereto
fore characterized the relations existing between
the two branches of our government. J
SuBSTiTUTps.- This matter is already attract
ing the earnest attention of Congress. On one
of the first days of the session, the Senate pass
ed the following bill V , , " 7
'The Congress of the Confederate States of
America do enact, That no person liable to
military .service .shall hereafter ;;be , permitted
or allowed to f urn ih a substitute for such ser
vice, r.or. shall any substitute, be ; received, -enlisted
ortnroHed in; tho military ser vice of the
Confederate States, and that all laws hereto for
passed permitting or allowing persons liable to
military service to Jurnish substitutes for. the
same, or authorizing the acceptance, enlistment
or enrollment of any such substitutes in tbe
military service be and the same are hereby
allowing fersens liable to military service to
furnish substitutes, those who have done so will
be required to enter the army, should the bill
become a law.
The House has also had this Bill before it,
but referred it to the Military committee to re
port upon. From the tone of the remarks
made in the House, we should not be surprised
it the bill also passed that body.

gHf" In the discharge of our duty as a pub
lic journalist, we felt it encumbent upon us, in
our lat issue, to comment with some severity
upon the course pursued by the representatives
of the people, in the reeent extra esion ot the
Legislature ; they having increased their per
diem to 812, and , mileage to 20 cents. We
thought the example eet by these "honorable,"
in these times of speculation and extortion, rath
er bad, and suggested to them the fact, that al
though, they had exempted themselves from
military service of every character, they were no
better than their constituents who fight tbe etiB
my for $11 per month and take pay in Confed
erate money.
The salaries too of all the other State officers
were raised in about the same proportion, ex
cept that of th Judges which were increased
o'nly about $1000 an addition of one third to
that of the old salary. While that of the other
State officers together with their own pay, was
increased four times as much. It will be re
collected that the greater portion of the Judges
arc of the ''old stripe." and that ail the other
Sute officer, Solicitors and all, ar8 lbevr
stripe."
For this the hireling buffoon of the Raleigh
Progress denominates us an "ass" and savs
that we are "brainless;" that; we "demand
specie for wood that we have done all w
ooald "to destroy the currency," &o. We tell
the buffoon simply that he lies, and that every,
body who reads his paper in this community
will know it as soon as they tee it. We will
not bandy epithets with him. That is a dirty
work, one suited rather to "an expert vender of
lemonade in a negro circus show," the to an
editor of a newspaper. We don't know how
true it is, but we have seen it stated in the pa- i
pers that the Progress man, who does the bid
ding of bis master writes paragraphs lor the
Buffalo cause, and buncombe for Abe Lincoln,
in addition to his superior skill as i Psychologist,
in titnes of ustreighrt" has exhibited rare tack
in this latter caliing, and did not ' demand the
specie" either.
" We too. like our contemporary have said "too
much on a very small subject," and to a very
small talef ;'at that.
P. S. Wish we could have heard one of those
lectures on Psychology, "brainless" as we are !
al States and to the laws of Congress and the proo
tarnations ot the President confiscating property
and liberating slaves, and finally to the desire that
persons heretofore engaged in said rebellion may
resume all allegiance to the United States, and as
sist in the reorganization of th loyal States Got
ernments. Therelore it is proclaimed that full
pardon be granted to all participants in the rebel
lion with a restoration of the rights of property
except slaves, upon condition that they take
an oath, the form ot which is presented, :o faith

of the President in reference to slaves, until modi
Bed or declared vojdtAU prominent officials of the
Confederate Governnaent,ofEcers ef the army above
the rank of Colonel, and others mentioned, are ac
cepted from the benefit of this pardon. He furth.
er proclaims that whenever one-tenth of th quali
fied voters of any State in rebellion after taking !
said oath, shall re-establish, their State Govern
rrent, it shall be recognized as the true Govern
ment ot Raid State.
The N. Y. Herald concludes that Lincoln's plan
will be a failure, and expresses the hope that the
discussion ot it will lead to some satisfactary halt- j
way house of rest.
Now we all recollect that the King of England
in the Revolutionary struggle,made precisely a eim
ilar proposition to the rebels in arms agaiast his
power, aBd that there were few, very few, low
and mean enough to accept it. Thus it will be
now. There may be some disposed to crave the
tyrant's mercy and be satisfied with what he ohoos
es to g've, but the mass of our people will laugh at
and seorn this effort of a trembling coward to up
hold and mn.intft.in his totterrnsr irovernment. Tb '

very fact that he offers such & proposition, is an i
evidence of his weakness and knowledge that the
means he possesses to conquer ns, are not adequate
for the accomplishment of what he desires.
