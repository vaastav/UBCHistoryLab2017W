WILM1M El. VANDRKBILT.
"William H. Vanderbilt, who was yesterday
morning the richest man in this country, and
was envied by millions, was in the relentless
grasp of death before yesterday evening.
His many millions conld not keep him alive
and cannot rescue him from death." And
"all he can hold in his cold dead hand, is
what he has given away."
The story of his career is already well
known to the American pnblic. Much of
his life was snent in comnarativs obsenritv E
until his father called him to the front to re- I
tain and increase the wealth of the "Vander
bilt family. The old commodore judged
wisely concerning his ability, as the sequel
has shown. He could not have found any
body better fitted for the work.
The record of the dead man as a money-
getter is perhaps mere respectable than that
of some of the "money kings" of this coun
try. At least no such complaints have been
made against him as have been made
against Jay Gould and others. Still, he
has not won a wide reputation for generosity
and unselfishness in his dealings with his fel
low men, and there is no indication that he
wanted to. He has, however, planned and
carried out some great schemes which have
been of much benefit to the country.
The rich man liked one thing almost as well
as he did money and that was a nood horse. He
liked to own, drive and be with good horses,
and those who know what good horses are
have always thought better of him because
he had such a liking for horses.
It is interesting to speculate concerning
the effect which his death will have on the
great fortune whioh he and his father ol
lected. If it should be scattered it would be
a good thing for the country. Another in
teresting question is, what effect will his
peciaily on the stocks with whioh hhas
been indentified. A great many very anxious
investors in these stocks are wishing that
they knew what te-do. ,
THE MESSAGE.
We have been told that President Cleve
land was a man of few words. Twenty thou
sand is not "a few," and yet he takes twenty
thousand words, more or less, to tell Con
gress" and the people what he thinks about
the state of the country and the improve
ments which he thinks ought to be made.
As life is short, and space in the Journal
and Courier is limited, we put before our
readers this morning the most important
parts of the message and omit that which is
not of general interest.
In his discussion of our foreign relations
the President pays attention to the Chinese
question. He seems to be of the opinion
that the Chinese must go, though he declares
that all the powers of the government should
be exerted to maintain the amplest good
faith toward China in the treatment of those
who have murdered Chinamen in Wyoming
and Washington territories.
Perhaps no part of the message will be
read more eagerly and carefully than that
whioh relates to tho tariff. This matter is
treated very carefully and wisely. The
President would like to &ee the burdens of
the people reduced, but he does not think
there is now any occasion for the general dis
cussion of the wisdom or expediency of a
protective system.
The silver problem receives very foil dis
cussion, and the suspension ef the compul
sory coinage of silver dollars is reoom
mended. The reasons the President gives
for this recommendation are very convincing.
The Indian problem is wisely and humane
ly treated, and what the President has to
say concerning the public lands will meet
the approval of all true patriots. Much in
terest has been felt in what the message
would say concerning the Mormons. Noth
ing could be more satisfactory or more to the
point than this part of the message.
The President is still a civil service re
former, although he has done some things
which looked the other way. We reoommend
our readers to pay careful attention to his
remarks upon this topic. -They are well
worth reading and thinking of. .
On the whole the message will make a
good impression. It is not a brilliant or
startling document, but it is thorough,
straightforward and' bold, and its recom
mendations will meet general approval. It
is a pity that it is so long.
EDITORIAL NOTES.
The sailing for France yesterday of six un
fortunate children who were bitten by a mad
dog in Newark the other day was a notable
event. They have gone to be treated by M.
Pasteur, the celebrated Frenchman who
laims to be able to prevent hydrophobia by
inoculation with hydrophobic virus.
Their experience will be watched with
great interest in this and other countries.
- In a recent speech in his cathedral city the
Archbishop of Canterbury, alluding to the
preposterous notions prevalent among the
peasantry in England as to the advantages
they ore to reap from disestablishment, said:
"There is a parish where there is a devoted
clergyman, whose family are coastant in their
attention to the sick and sorrowing. One of
them discovered that many of the cottagers
she visited were in favor of disestablish
ment. She asked several 'Why!' but could
get no answer. At length a man said, 'Well,
mum, I know it's a pity,, but it would be
very convenient to have a cow. We do
want a cow, mum.' "
The people of New Hampshire seem to be
in a way to find oat that the passage of the
now. famous "Valued Policy" law was a mis;
take. Among other injuries it threatems to
seriously hurt the ''summer , boarder" busi
ness. There are in the State, of hotels only
opened for the summer traffic no less than
142 whieh have accommodations for over 50
people apiece, while a number of them are
large enough to house hundreds of people at
once. ' They are costly structures, with ex
pensive furnishings, and are always consid-
ered very risky property; the insurance on
one of the great hotels being usually distrib
utee! among a large number of companies.
Since the new law went into effect, and the
foreign companies withdrew from the State,
not a company in New Hampshire will take
a dollar on such property. Their policies
are running ont daily, and everybody who
has capital invested in them is anxious to
get it out, while an effectual quietus has
been put upon all new enterprises, like the
projected $65,000 extension of the Glen
House and the erection of other hotels.
, The wild-beast pest but slowly disappears
in British India. There is, however, a
slight decrease in the loss of life from the
bites of wild animals and venomous snakes.
The numbers are 22,905 for 1883 and 22,425
for 1884. The numbers representing those
due to snake bites are 20,067 and 19,629 in
the two years respectively. The reported
loss of cattle amounted to 49,672, against
47,478 in the previous year. Of these, 47,
944 are said to have been caused by wild ani
mals and 1,728 by snakes. Tigers and leop
ards are shown to have been about equally
destructive, having killed 19,680 and 19,699
head of cattle respectively. In the number
of wild animals destroyed there was a satis
factory increase from 19,890 in the previous
year to 23,775. . The destruction of poison
ous snakes is enormous, but the aumbera
have declined from 412,782 -to 380,981.
Wherever the system of rewards has been
pursued the figures have shown a satisfac
tory increase, although it naturally happens
that here and there a too adventurous csnake
killer pays for his daring with his life.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Cleveland begins his first mes
sage to Congress by making suitable refer
ence to the recent death of the Vice Presi
dent. He then devotes much space to the
consideration of our foreign relations. The
following are the most important features of
this part of the message:
NO TREATT WITH NICARAGUA.
The interest of the United States in a
practicable transit for ships across the strip
of land separating the Atlantic and the Pa
cifio has been repeatedly manifested during
the last half century.
My immediate predecessor caused to be ne
gotiated with Nicaragua a treaty for the con
struction, by and at the sole cost of the
United States, of a canal through Nicaragua
territory, and lai d it before the Senate.
Pending the action of that body thereon, I
withdrew the treaty for re-examination. At
tentive consideration of its provisions leads
me to withhold it from re-submission to the
Senate. Maintaining, as I do, the tenets of
a line of precedents from Washington's day,
which proscribe entangling alliances with
I foreign States, I do not favor a policy of
acquisition or new ana distant territory or
the incorporation of remote interests with
our ewn. The laws of progress are vital and
organic, and we must be conscious of that
irresistible tide of commercial expansion
which, as the concomitant of our active civ
ilization, day by day, is being urged onward
by those increasing facilities of production,
transportation and communication to which
steam and electricity have given birth; but
our duty m the "present intrusts us to ad
dress ourselves mainly to the development
of the vast resources of the great area com
mitted to our charge, and to the cultivation
of the arts of peace within our own borders,
though jealously alert in preventing the
Ameiican hemisphere from being involved in
the political problems and complications of
distant governments. Therefore I am unable
to recommend propositions involving para
mount privileges of ownership or right out
side of our own territory, when coupled with
absolute and unlimited engagements to de
fend the territorial integrity of the State
-where. such interests lie. While the general
project of connecting the two oceans by
means of a canal is to be encouraged, I am
of the opinion that any scheme to that end to
be considered with favor should be free from
the features alluded to.
THE CHINESE QUESTION.
The condition of the Chinese question in
the western States and territories is, despite
this restrictive legislation, far from being
satisfactory. The recent outbreak in Wyo
ming territory, where numbers of unoffend
ing Chinamen, indisputably within the pro
tection of the treaties aud the law, were
murdered by a mob, and the still more re
cent threatened outbreak of the same charac
ter in Washington territory, are fresh in the
minds of all, aud there is apprehension lest
the bitterness of feeling against the Mongo
lian race on the Pacific slope may find vent
ia similar lawless demonstrations. All the
power of this government should bo exerted
to maintain the amplest good faith toward
China in the treatment of these men, and the
inflexible sternness of the law in bringing
the wrong-doers to justice should be insisted
upon.
Every effort has been made by this govern
ment to prevent these violent outbreaks and
to aid the representatives of China in their
investigation of these outrages; and it is but
just to say that they are traceable to the law
lessness of men not citizens of the United
States engaged in competition with Chinese
laborers.
- Race prejudice is the chief factor origin
ating these disturbances, and it exists in a
large part of our domain, jeopardizing our
domestic peace and the good relationship we
strive to maintain with China.
The admitted right of a government to
prevent the influx of elements hostile to its
internal peace and Moutity maj not n vx-
tioned, even where there is no treaty stipu
lation on the subject. That the exclusion of
Chinese labor is demanded in other countries
where like conditions prevail is stronurly
.i J l. b- lpMrfaion . of 0iiR;t . where
UUlUCSd llUullglULlUll i.3 11UW ItgOmTOI y
laws more stringent than our own. If ex
isting laws are inadequate to compass the
end in view, I shall be prepared to give earn
est consideration to any farther remedial
measures, within the treaty limits, which the
wisdom of Congress may devise.
THE CONSULAR SERVICE.
I earnestly urge that Congress recast the
appropriation for the maintenance of the di
plomatic and consular sarvice on a footing
commensurate with the importance of our
national interests. At every post where a
representative is necessary, the salary should
be so graded as to permit him to live with
comfort. With the assignment of adequate
salaries the so-called notarial extra-official
fees, which our officers abroad are now per
mitted to treat as personal perquisites,
should be done away with. Every act re
quiring the certification and seal of the offi
cer should be taxable at schedule rates, aud
the fee therefor returned to the treasury.
By restoring these revenues to the public use
the consular service would be self-supporting,
even with a liberal increase of the pres
ent low salaries. In further prevention of
abuses, a system of consular inspection
should be instituted. The appointment of
a limited number of secretaries of legation
at large, to be assigned to duty wherever
r-ecessary, and in particular for temporary
service at missions which for any cause may
be without a head, should also be authorized.
I favor, also, authorization for the detail
of officers of the regular service as military
or naval attaches at legations.
The financial condition of the country is
then considered and the following is said
concerning
THE TARIFF.
The fact that our revenues are in excess of
the actual needs ot an economical administra
tion of the government justifies a reduction
in the amount exacted from the people for its
support. Our government is but the means es
tablished by the will of a free people by
continued on fourth page.
Catarrh
Is a constitutional disease, caused by scrofulous
taint in the blood. Hood's Sarsaparilla, being a con
stitutional remedy, purifies the blood, builds up
the whole system and permanently cures catarrh.
Thousands of people who suffered severely with
this disagreeable disease, testify with pleasure
Can be
cured by taking Hood's Sarsapsi ilia. Mrs. Alfred
Cunningham, Fallon avenue, Providence, R. I.,
says: "I have suffered with catarrh in my head
for years, and paid out hundreds of dollars for
medicines, but have heretofore received only tern-
Lporary relief. I began to take Hold's Sarsaparilla,
but now my catarrh is nearly cured, the weakness
of my body is all gone, my appetite is good in
fact, I feel like another person. Hood's Sarsapar
illa is the best medicine I have ever taken, and the
only one which did me permanent good. I cordi
ally recommend it." A gentleman in Worcester,
Mass
Cured
of catarrh by Hood's Sarsaparilla, says: "I would
not take any moneyed consideration for the one
bottie did me." If you are a suffarer, do not put
off taking- a simple remedy till your bronchial
tubes or lungs are affected, and consumption has
gained a hold upon you. Be wise in time. That
flow from the nose, ringing noise in the ears, pain
in the head, inflammation of the throat, cough and
nervous prostration will be cured if you take
Hood's Sarsaparilla.

bath with Cuticura Soap, and a single application
of Culicura, the great Skin Cure. This repeated

Will McDonald, 3,f43 Dearborn St., Chicago,
gratefully acknowledges a cure of Eczema or Salt
Rheum, on head, neck, face, arms and legs for sev
enteen yeara; not able to walk except on hands and
knees for one year; not able to help himself for
eight years; tried hundreds of remedies; doctors
pronounced his case hopeless; permanently cured
by Cuticura Resolvent (blood purifier) internally,
and Cuticura and Cuticura Soap (the great skin
cures) externally.
Charles Ilonditon, KsqM lawyer, 82 State
street, Boston, reports a case of nezerua under his
observation for ten years, which covered the pa
tient's body and limbs, and to which all known
methods of treatment had been applied without
benefit, which was completely cured solely by the
Cuticura Remedies, leaving a clean and healthy
skin.
ITIr. Jotio Xhiel, Witkesbarre, Pa, writes:
"I have suffered from Salt Rheum for over eight
years, at times so bad that I could not attend to my
business for weeks at a time. Three boxes of Cuti
cura and four bottles of Resolvent have entirely
cured me of this dreadful disease."
Itching Diseases Cared.
Cuticura stands at the head of its class, especially
is this the case with the Cuticura Soap. Have had
