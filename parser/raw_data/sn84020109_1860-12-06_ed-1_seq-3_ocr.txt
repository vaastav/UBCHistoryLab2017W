ing of the slave trade, nor the right of
Lincoln to the unanimous support of the

that a meeting Would be held in hi3
church on the evening. In response to
this announcement the church was filled
at an early hour. A large proportion of
the audience were black. Wendell Phi
lips, Fred. Douglas and other John
Brown sympathizers vindicated their opi
nions. Outside of the church there was
an immense crowd and a strong force of
police. The disturbance was confined to
noisy demonstrations, though the crowd
seemed very anxious to get hold of Red
path. The meeting broke up about ten
o'clock, and the audience dispersed quiet
ly. Some of the leading spirits were
hooted at while passing through the
crowd, but no violence was committed.
F. B. Sandborn was acting president of
the meeting. In anticipation of a riot,
the 2d battalion of infantry was called in
readiness at their armory by order of
the mayor. The police force, however,
was amply sufficient, and the evening
passed with good natured, but great pa
triotic excitement.
Washington, Dec. 4th.
The President reviews the history of
the anti-slavery movement, and says all
that is necessary to bring about peace is
to let the slave States manage their own
domestic institutions in their own way.
That the election of any man to office is
no just cause for secession ; the antece
dents of the President elect are calcula
ted to excite fears in S. C, but is the
question of contingent danger sufficient to
justify "destruction of the Government?
He reviews the acts of the different North
ern State on the passage of personal lib
erty bills, and pronounces them unconstitutional.-
He says it should not be pre
sumed in advance that the Presidentelect
will fail to enforce the fugitive slave law,
but wait for the overt act. He then de
clares against the right of secession, and
says admit it and the Union may be. broken
in less than two weeks ; he quotes the
language of Jackson and Madison; and
says secession is founded on an inference
not in the Constitution and quotes the
Constitution in support of this view. The
right of resis-atiCe against tyranny and
oppression, however, cannot be denied,
it is asserted in the declaration of inde
pendauce, but secession is neither more
nor less than revolution. He speaks of
the affairs of S. C. Does not believe that
an attempt will be made to seize the fort;
the officers have orders to act strictly on
the defensive and let the responsibility
rest on the assailants. He invokes hi-s
countrymen to pause before attempting to
destroy the Lcion which has conferred so
many benefits. He urges that Congress
can do much to restore peace by propos
ing and recommending an amendment to
the Constitution for remedying the exist
ing evils. He recommends the following
