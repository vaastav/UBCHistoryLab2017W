Breaking Up.
When a mass of ice that lias bound
up a stream in fetters" begins to yield
under the pressure of a freshet, there
cornea first a loud report, a great .crack
or fissure extending across the crust
then smaller fissures seem to dart to
ward It to meet it, and soon what was a
short while before a solid cake, becomes
a drift of broken and melting fragment!
swept along on the stream. "The Solid
South." a crust of prejudice, a mass of
orystalized and . petrified conservatism
and fogy ism, that has for fifteen years
fettered the flow of .progress and pros
perity in the South appears to be break
ing up in this way. The defeat of Bour-
bonisin in Virginia was the first fissure
iu the crust of the Solid South. ' It rang
oat with a report like a piec of artil
leay. It showed that the strong cur
rents that had been moving beneath this
leaden and stolid repression were in
creasing to torrents, and that the tide
ef social and political prosperity could
no longer be stayed by caste, prejudice,
fossil traditions or wooden-headed con
servatism. The Bourbons lament and
wring their bands and say that Virginia
ruined. . If this means that Bourbon
ism is ruined, they are not far wrong.
By and by it will be perceived that Vir
ginia is far better off industrially, polit
ically and socially than ever before. A
new life is already evident there. But
the liberation of Virginia is only the be
ginning of the break. In South Carolt
na the same forces are at work with in
creased power. The duel-fighting, reck
less, tissue-paper ballot Bourbonism of
South Carolina has brought that state to
a most unhappy condition. The frauds
by which the elections have been carried
for ths Bourbons of that state have been
Open and flagrant. They -were justified,
like duels, by public opinion. With
haughty frankness the Palmetto states
men admitted that to cheat the negroes
at the ballot-box was better and safer
than to terrorize them or drive them
from the polls by such events as took
place at Hamburg and elsewhere. This
cheating of the negroes was at first only
winked at. The clean-handed cavaliers
would not personally touch the defile
ment, though they accepted the results;
The actual cheating was done by a low
er set of sharpers. But tLese soon ' be
gan to cheat on their, own aceount. and
are noW pretty well in control -of that
state, and-hold it with a grip thai noth
ing short of a revolution will relax. But
that revolution 58 coming. The next
election in South Carolina will baa rp-i
etltlorrof IhatTtTVirginia. The tissue
ballot and the false count have had their
day, and like the shot-gun and the ku-
klux piask. must be laid .aside. The
magnificent agricultural and industrial
progress of Georgia, as shown in the At
lanta Exposition, is-an evidence of the
lioeral spirit that must soon throw off
Bourbonism. " So also in Tennessee. In
Maryland the recent state elections Te-
vealed a profound dissatisfaction ' with
Democratic conservatism, especially
when iron-bound by ring rule. It was
not, however, merely, the disposition of
the Democracy to split into factions that
showed this. It was their readiness to
combine with the Republicans io fight
each other that was the most significant
fact. Though the Democratic leaders
fought this with desperate energy and
with partial success, still their half vic
tory was almost a defeat. Some of the
strongest and most eloquent men of the
Democratic party, especially in Howard
eounty, were ready to unite witli the
Republicans to break the ring. The
elections terrified the Maryland Bour
bons. The Republicans carried many of
their fortresses.and Republican strength
growing, while the Democrats are
wrangling in petty factious and uniting
their fortunes to this leader . of that
without a thought of principle, or policy
in their schemes. .It is within the pos
sibilities that Maryland may at the next
election be added to the Republican col
umn, and that an end may be make to
Maryland Bourbonism. Balt.American.
The fraudulent part of the medical
expert in iufanity in murder trials is
that he pretends to know better than
other men, and to know positively,
whether a stated line of conduct proves
insanity In fact he knows no better
than other men. Another part of bis
fraud is that he pretends that there is a
defined line between the sane . and the
nsane, and that he is expert to tell who
is on one side, and who on the other
Yet he can not define insanity, nor de
tine the relation of what he calls insan
ity to moral responsibility. Another
part of his quackery is that ne assumes
to pronounce, upon a certain line of ir.
rational conduct, that the person is in
sane, and thereforeis not responsible for
the crime, as if he did not know its na
ture,, aiid did not know right from
wrong. The insane experts are a pretty
bad lot of cranks, and are largely pro
moters of the murdering cranks. Cin
Gazette. ..
To the "literature of cranks" may be
added some curious statistics recently
compiled in England, showing the ex
tent of mental aberration among the
members , of various professions and
trades in that eountry. Among the 5,234
civil engineers in England, last year, 24
became insane. The same unhappy fate
befel IS of 5,804 painters and sculptors;
only 25 of 32,000 architects aqd contract
ors; 35 of 20,064 clergymen of the estab
lished Church-; 145 of 234,773 masons,
bricklayers and stonecutters ; 132 of 106,-
824 painters, glaziers and paperstaioers;
and 174 of 205,624 carpenters. Only the
enviably small number of 12 cases of
permanent Insanity were ; reported
among the . 130,143 authors, journalists,
reporters and translators, male and fe
male; of the Kingdom.
THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
. r With an appropriate reference to the
"appalling calamity" that befell the
American people in the death of , Gen,
Garfield, and the universal tribute of
sympathy and sorrow which history will
record "as signal tokens of the kinship
of '.Nations," President Arthur appro
priately opens his first message to Con
gress.
A rapid and cursory review of our re
lations with foreign Powers follows.
'There is nothing especially now in what
be says on the subject. Early in the
year the Fortune Bay claims wei9 satis
factorily settled with Great Britain. Ne
gotiations for an International Copy
right Convention are still pending. The
surrender of Sitting Bull has allayed ap
prehension on our Northwestern border,
though bodies of British Indians still
make incursions in quest of food, so that
in all respects our relations with Great
Britain are eminently peaceful and
friendly.
Congress is recommended to provide
for the repayment of expenses incurred
by our commissioners and delegates to
the Paris Electrical Congress, in which
honors were won by our specialists.
Relations with Germany and fepain
continue friendly, but attention is call
ed to the onerous fines which have been
imposed upon American shipping in
Spanish Colonial ports, especially in the
case of the bark Masonic, which put in
to the port of Manilla in distress, and
the cargo of which it was sought to con
fiscate for alleged shortage in her tran
shipped cargo.
The exchange of condolences between
our own and the Russian Governments
on the assassination of the Czar and the
President is duly noticed, also the con
clusion of an agreement with Italy, put
ting at rest conflicts of jurisdiction iu
the case of crime on shipboard, and re
commending Congressional recognition
to the proceedings of various interna
tional congresses held during the year.
The failure of the. Turkish Govern
ment to execute the condemned mur
derer of Dr. Parsons, missionary, is no
ted ; also the protest of our Government
to the Swiss authorities in permitting
the emigration of criminals and other
objectionable persons.
Our relations with Mexico are rnena-
ly, and the Government encourges Mex
ico to promote a more intimate commer
cial intercourse as of advantage to both
countries, while at the same time provi
ding for the restraint of lawlessness on
the bordtr and the suppression of forays
by the Reservation indianaon both sides
thwjiiip.;, ; , -
Relations with the Central American
States are friendly and satisfactory, but
there is a suggestion of paternal interest
in their affairs. It is assumed in the
matter of the inter-oceanic canal that
we are ti e sole guarantor of the in
tegrity of Colombian territory and of
the canal itself," and should treat a Eu
ropean guarantee of such neutrality as
an impertinence.
The message expresses regret at the
withdrawal of the American lines be
tween the ports of Brazil and our own,
but does not show that it has affected
our commerce with that country disas
trously. . ' '
The treaties lately . negotiated with
China have been ratified on both sides;
we gain in the privilege to suppress im
migration, and China in exemption from
the evils of the opium trade, so far as
American commerce is concerned. ,
A few other matters, incident to our
foreign relations, are mentioned, but of
no particular interest
A new code of maritime regulations
to prevent collisions at sea is recommen
ded. They ars now in general practice,
and attention is called to the new rules
and regulations adopted by the National
Board of Health to prevent tne introduc
tion of contagions diseases into the
country.
The financial condition of the country
at the ending of the fiscal year, June 30,
is stated at length.'- It is estimated that
the receipts for the current year will ex
cel those of the last by some $60,000,000
in round numbers, while the expendi
tures will remain within $10,000,000 of
last year. This will leave $130,000,000
to be applied to tne MnKing j; uua ana
redemption of the public debt.
, The President recommends tne retire
ment of the silver certificates, and the
repeal of the law authorizing their issue,
and concurs in Secretary Folger8 re
cummendation that the coinage of silver
dollars be suspended for the present.
Also that the $15,000,000 of ueredeemed
fractional currency be dropped from the
statements of the public . debt. It will
never, probably, be offered for redemp
tion. It is also suggested that National
banks may properly be forbiden to re
tire without giving "reasonable notice."
The details ol the revenue from cus
toms, and the excess of exports over
imports, amounting to over $91,000,000,
will be read witn interest. The balance
is oh the right side still, and likely to
continue so.
After stating the history of the re
funding of the Five and Six per centum
bonds into Tbree-and-a-balfs, the Presi
dent says, "Unless these bonds can be
funded at a much lower rate of interest
than they now bear, I agree with the
Secretary of the Treasury, that no legis
lation restricting them is desirable.
In view, also, of our .abundant resour
ces, the President thinks the time has
come for relief to tax-payers, and re
commends the repeal of all internal rev
enue taxes except upon tobacco and dis
tilled fermented liquors. But he doubts
the advisability of reducing the taxes on
these commodities. -
The tariff also needs revision, and he
concurs in tne recommendation of a
Commission to consider the subject and
report to Congress.
In his commeuts on the reports of the
various Departments, the Army, the
Navy, of Justice, &c there is nothing
strikingly new in the message. The im
portance of reorganizing the Navy and
making it efficient is dwelt upon; and it
is recommended that women shall be
made competent to testify on trial of
their husbands where they are tried
upon a charge of bigamy. Other meas
ures calculated to repress Mormon prac
tices in this respect are recommended.
The enormous amount to be paid in
pensions and for arrears of pensions is
discussed at some length. On churns
filed before June 30, 1880, the .sum of
8235,000,000 at least will . have to be
paid. Thirty-eight thousand five hun
dred cases hare sines been filed and are
now pending. The average sum obtain

The subject of civil service reform
comes in for large consideration. The
President is in favor of adopting some
or tne features or tne lincUsh svstem
including life-tenure, limitations to the;
maximum age at which an applicant
may enter the service, and an allowance
upon retiring from office. He would at
least offer no objection were these fea
tnres of the English system adopted.

motions to an oinces exceut such as
would be fairly considered exponents of

some doubts of the expediency of purely

iioard or Examiners, without resort to
the competitive test, would perhaps "nut

present system of appointments."
. iiie uecune or our mercliaot marine
is greatly deplored, but the President,
witnout venturing any sueeestton how

in its specification of "inability to per

The Assassin's Trial.
CLOSE OF THE DEFENSE.
Washington, Dec. 6 Upon the open
ing of court this morning - Guiteau an
nounced that he had prepared an order
for the attendance - of witnesses. He
suggested Saturday, and would desire
the court to sign it at once. The order
was banded to Judge Cox. -
Mr. bcoville called Geo. Gorbam. edi
tor of the Republican, but he did not re
spond until after Congressman B. Far-
well testified as to his belief of me pris
oner s responsibility. When Gorham
took the stand a discussion ensued be
tween counsel upon the form of ques
tions in wnich Uuiteau insisted upon ta
lcing part. . Turning to Scoville he said,
l ou are getting a little cracked yoar-
self on this subject. ' I wouldn't have
your line of defense. - It is altogether
too narrow.
Gorham was asked to step down. when
Guiteau otmuted out, "Corne back, Mr.
Gorham. . I want to ask you a few ques
tions. -1 want you to state whether yoa
did not write and publish in last April,
May and June a great many bitter arti
cles denouncing President Garfield for
wrecking the Republican party V
Uorham I decline to answer that
question unless ordered by the Court.
lhe files of the Republican speak for
themselves.
' Judge Cox You can produce the files.
Mr. Prisoner, but you cannot compel the
witness to state what those hies contain.
Guiteau- Very well, Mr.;.Gorham, I
shall have you on the stand later with
your files. I propose to show how your.
paper denounced the . President for dis
rupting the Republican party. , u. .
Uuiteau then, at Scoville s suggestion.

which set forth the trials and teach) rigs

said Guiteau ; "that's just the way 1 tried

Shortly afterward the prisoner became
involved in angry discussion with Sco
ville, in the coarse of which -he became
very violent and denounced him as no
politician and no lawyer. "You insinu
ated yourself upon the defense just be
cause you happened to' be my . brother-
said Guiteau. . . -
J udge Porter undertook to address the
Court when Guiteau shouted imperions-
"Now you just keep quiet, Mr. Judge
Porter. You are altogether too talka
tive this morning." ii;
Scoville stated he desired lo have Pres
ident Arthur testify in the case. ' '
Guiteau (interrupting)! es ;and Grant
and Cockling and the rest of my political
friends. Scoville here takes ' altogether
too narrow a view in this case. . ; "
Scoville continuing, said be had made
every effort to secure the President's at-:
tendance but without success.' It was
absol utely essential to obtain . his testi
mony. ...
After some discussion, the counsel for
the prosecution agreed to allow Scoville
prepare interrogatories to be submit
ted to the President, and to allow his
evidence in this form to be put in later.
scoville stated that with this excep
tion the defense had concluded.
Guiteau (excitedly) I want that or
der signed, Judge. I
Jucge Cox 1 fail to see the necessity
for summoning the witnesses you have
named, and Bball therefore refuse the
order, Mr. Prisoner.
Guitean Then I note an exception.
Reporter, put that down.
Scoville then produced Uuiteau s oooK
Truth," which has been put in evidence,
but not yet read to the jur.
Guiteauar-Scoville, you read like a
schoolboy. You don't put any spirit in
to it Let me read.
Guiteau then begun reading. -He
apologized to the audience by way of a
preface by saying: "iadies and gentle
men I have not had any practice for so
long that my voice may be a little husky.

hope you will give your attention. You
will hud some very interesting reading."
Confusion ensued iu the rear of the
court room which greatly annoyed Gui-
teau,and he appealed petulently to Judge
Cox, saying, "I must have order in this
room or 1 cannot be heard." Then turn
ing partly round to the audience: "If
any one wants to go out let them go,but
you must keep order, ladies and gentle
men." Thirty minutes were occupied in the
reading, when the hour of recess arriv
ed. Connsel for the prosecution object
ed to the reading of the entire book, and
after some discussion it was arranged
that Scoville should mark such passages
as he intends to rely upon or touch upon
in his argument, and submit the book io
the prosecution to-morrow. With this
understanding and argument between
counsel relative to the evidence of Pres
ldent'Arthur, Scoville announced the
close of the defense. -

the prosecution will introduce their evi
dence in rebuttal."
Dkclmkbek 7 The Criminal Court
was densely crowded this nioinin.
Among the audience were Gen. Sher
ui.tli and Kev. DeWitt Taluiadge.
To-dy tlie prosecution commence in
ebuttal. to demolish the theory of in
sanity a set Up by' the defense. ' In do-
irg tins tney will retraverse me grounu
gone over by the defense, and from the
standpoint of the prosecution will thor
oughly ventilate Guiteau's past life and
habits, beginning with his early life in
Freeporl, and concluding "with a vast
amount of the best expert testimony ob
tainable in the country.
As Soon as court was opened, uuiteau
addressed the Court in rather imperious
toues as follows: "May it please your
Honor, the American people don t de
sire that this case shall be tried again
and I don't desire it I say with the ut
most respect to this Court and jury and
my counsel, Scoville, that I am not satis
fied with the political situation as devel
oped in this case. This is tne gist or
this alleged offense. The President of
the U. States would never have been shot
if it had not been for the political situa
tion which existed last May and June,
and I say I have the right, as a matter
of law, iu appearing as my own counsel.
to ask vour Honor that Uen. urant, teu-
ators Conkling and Piatt and President
Arthur, and those kind of ' men. who
were so down upon Garfield that they
would not speak to him on the street
and would not go to the' White House,
shall be put on the stand. I have the
right to show my ' personal 1 relations to
those gentlemen ; thaf I was - cordially
received by them, and that 1 was well
dressed and well fed at the Fifth Ave
nue Hotel. I want to show my person
al relations to those' men. : 1 don't want
to except to your Honor's rulings, but I
shall be obliged to do soi and I have no
doubt the court iu banc will give me a
new trial."
Judge Cox Your' exception' has been
noted. ' , ' ,". '
Scoville then called up the subjeet or
President Arthur's testimony, and said
he had not receeived any response to his
interrogatories; that the President's ev
idence was absolutely essential to the
defense, etc ' ; -
Guiteau' interrupted him excitedly
with : "I don't think it at till necessery for
Gen. Arthur to be here." To Scoville:
"I don't care what you want I am do
ing this myself. I ask as a personal fa
vor that he shan't be dragged into court
I think a good deal of Gen. Arthur. He
is President of the United States and I
made him so. and I think I should have
something to say in' this matter." '
It was arranged between connsel mat
the President's answers should be put in
as evidence at any stage of the trial,and
Scoville called Gen, W. T.Sherman. The
witness simply recited the orders he had
issued for the disposition ' of troops at
the time of the assassination.1 He iden
tified a letter written by ' Guiteau, and
said he suspected at the time that there
might be a conspiracy, but he afterward
concluded that the shooting was the act
of one man.
As he left the stand Guiteau said : "I
Xbank you. General, for having ordered
out those troops that day. it it naa not
been for you I should not be hereto-uay.
owe my life to the protection wnicn
you and Gen. Crocker gave me during
that period when the moo spirit was
rife." At this the General smiled grimly.
Edward P; Barton, a lawyer; A. T.
Green and G. W. Tandy, all of Freeport,
Illinois, testified that they knew the
Guiteau family and considered them all
sane. ' "
Dr. R. P. Buckley, of Freeport testi
fied that he was L. W. Guiteau's family
physician. Never saw any indications
of the slightest mental derangement in
him nor in Abram uuiteau.
Mr. Atkins, of Freeport a Republican,
confirmed the testimony of the previous
witnesses as to the sanity or various
members of the Guiteau family.
Just before recess, someone in the
audience behind Guiteau, made a re
quest for his autograph. Guiteau did it
with a nounsD, ana as ne tore ou me
slip, said: "I want to call attention to
this autograph business. A great many
people want my auto, and 1 give it mem ;
but there is no vanity in me or egotism.
I notice the newspapers are taking it
up again. There is nothing in il at all."
J. S. Cochrane, a lawyer, who had re
sided in Freeport since 1868, testiued
that he never saw any indications of in
sanity in any member of the uuiteau
familv. When the witness nnisnea, uui
teau Bhouted to him: "Hold on; haven't
you heard him discuss free lovism ana
all that? Don't you know he was the
laughing stock of all Freeport for 25
years, for his crank ideas ?"
Sooville, whispering to Guuteau, tried
to restrain him, but he shouted at him:
"You keep quiet; I am doing this. Don't
you know enough to keep still? Ian
questioning the witness." Then with a
wave of the hand: "Goon, Mr. Witness,
and answer these questions separately."
The witness was told that he might
answer, and he replied: "I know just
the reverse to be the case." ; - :
Guiteau Well, that was the fact any
way. We don't want any more of this
kind of evidence. ;These people don't
know anything about my father's social
life and character. There is no contro
versy abaut his business character. - -
Geo. W. Oyler, a Justice of the Peace;
had lived in Freeport since 184d, and
never saw any indications of insanity in
the Guiteau family.
' Annan B. Babcock. a farmer, bad
known L. W. Guiteau since 13-10, and
never saw any indications of insanity
in him; never regarded anv of the fam
ily of unsound mind.
D. II. Sunderland knew L. W. Guiteau
for 30 years, and never saw anything
to indicate he was of uneouud uiind in
any way or in any degree. From his
knowledge- r Hint arqiiaintaiice with
members of the Guiteau family, inclu
ding the prisoner, witness Imd never
supposed there was insanity in the faui- '
ily.- - . ' '
Guiteau lmJ for some minutes been
reading the President's message, and
suddenly interrupted the Court and the
proceedings to express his opinion upon
"he document. -I'm glad said the
(irisorter, "Frejideut Arthur has given
these tniseritble Mormons such a slap:
I hope he will teep at them. It is a good
message. It has got the right ring to
it. Arthur is doing well, and he U go
ing to give us the best administration
we ever had."
Horace Tarbox, of Freeport was well
acquainted with the prisoner's father.
He had as good a head on nim as any'
man in the State,' and (after a slight
pause) he was the third smartest man
in the county.
"Who was'the first?" quickly asked
Guiteau.
Answer Mr. Sweet. ' ' . '
Guiteau Who was the second ?
Answer Mr. Turner.
"Well," said Guiteau, with a broad
smile of satisfaction, "as they have both
been dead a great many years, mv fath
er was ahead."
Guitteau was about to make another
little speech when Scoville endeavored
to stop him. and w:ts told: "Don't be
punching me under the table, please:- I
want to speaK. and (after a short pause)
I tell yoa what it is, Scoville. you have
got to abandon your theory; that's all
there is about iu Father was a smart
man and everybody knew it only he
was badly cracked on religion."
Adjourned.
When Ben Butler Prayed.
While Ben Butler was a student at
Colby University.it is said that one dark
night he and a congenial companion felt
moved to abstract the sign of a village
storekeeper. They fled with their prize
to the college dormitory, 'whither they
were followed by the indignant citizen.
attended by a local coustable, who knock
ed loudly for admittance at the offend
ers' door. To bum the sign before an
entrance to the room could be effected
was the only way the boys could escape
the consequences of their act and to
gain lime for this operation, tradition
says that Ben commenced to pray both
loud and long judging and wisely, as
the issue proved that ther unwelcome
guests would not force an entrance to a
room whose occupants were engaged in
their evening devotions. When the cause
of his auxiety ha I been wholly consum
ed, Ben brought kis supplication to a
close in the followiug eminently suita
ble words: "O Lord., we thank Thee for
deliverance from a wicked and perverse
generation, who go about seeking after
a sign, but no sign shall be given them."
The constab'e and his companion were
then admitted, but as they found no
trace of the stolen property, were forced
to depart with their desire for vengeance
unappeased.
Everybody knows what anumbrella
is, and can tell of what it is constructed ;
but few are aware bow large an indus
try is represented in the stick of this
nsesul and generally missing property.
An official estimate, made in September
last in Kingston, Jamaica, showed that
there were a little over 500,000 sticks
awaiting export to England and the Uni
ted States to be made into umbrella han
dles. These sticks were almost without
exception pimento, and it is not surpris
ing to lie informed that owners and les
sees or pimento whiks are Decoraing
alarmed at the growth of a trade which
threatens to uproot in a few years, all
their young trees. The export returns
for the past five years show that an av
erage of 2,000 bundles of sticks has been
sent out of the island annually in the
ordinary course of trade, and the returns
for the hrst three-quarters or 188 1 show
an export of over 4.500 bundles valued
at $15,000. When it is remembered thut
each bundle contains from 500 to 800
sticks, each of which represents a young
bearing pimento tree, the extent of ths
destruction may be realized.
