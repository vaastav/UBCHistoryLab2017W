The President's Message.
President Roosevelt's message to the
69th congress, which appears in com
plete form in today's Argus, together
with the appendix containing Secre
tary of State Root's address as hon
orary president of the third conference
of American Republics at Rio de Ja
neiro, July 31, last, and which is made
a part of the document. Is the most
voluminous - document that has come
from the pen of the present executive,
It Is written with characteristic vigor.
In a word the president knows what
he wants to say. and says it. In the
original the new system of simplified
spelling is applied. . The pres
ident has succeeded In establish
ing a reputation for candor and frank
ness and sincerity to the point of up
setting all precedents in the adminis
tration of his great office, and in his gen
eral course and recommendations as the
chief of the nation, and if he succeeds
in securing tne enactment and enforce
ment of half the reforms he proposes
he will accomplish wonders, and fur
ther his reputation as a man who not
only advocates, but does things.
Yet as a drive at the trusts, the
paramount problem as well as const!
tutiqg the paramount evil before the
American people today, he Is not as
pronounced as he might be, although he
urges more complete supervision of
corporations, holding that the operation
of such laws as are designed to regu
late gigantic corporations oppressing
the people are noxious where not en
forced. He believes in the regulation,
not the abolition of the power of in
junction, and the creation of a federal
commission of conciliation and arbi
tration to deal with labor disputes, a
very good idea if the commission so
constituted shall prove less a farce and
more fair than the interstate commerce

The popular Idea, says the Com
moner, that the governorship of New
York is a stepping stone to the presi
dency will be rudely shattered when it
is recalled that in 30 years only one
New York governor has removed from
Albany to the White house, and his
name was Grover Cleveland. Mr.
Roosevelt left the state house at Al
bany to become vice president, not to
become president.
John Davenport, an 81-year-old citi
zen of Wilkesbarre, Pa., a year ago
married a 30-yearold wife. The other
day she had him in court on a charge
of assault and battery. Mr. Davenport
declared: "I only married her to keep
my feet warm." His wife gave a prac
tical demonstration of how John seized
her around the neck and shook her. As
she did so, they both laughed, and some
one in court called out: "Oh, kiss and
make up." The couple adopted the
Idea on the spot, and left the court
arm in arm.
Bismarck held that three was the
perfect number. His own associations
therewith were remarkable. He had
served three masters. He had three
names: Bismarck, Schoenhausen and
Lauenburg. The arms of his family are
a clover leaf and three oak leaves. He
was concerned In three wars and sign
ed three treaties of peace. In the
Franco-Prussian war he had three
horses killed under him. He brough;
about the meeting of three emperors
and was responsible for the triple al
liance. He had three children, his fam
ily motto wag "In trinitate robur"
(strength in trinity), and contemporary
caricatures pictured him with three
hairs on his head.
President Roosevelt makes to congress
are for the passage of federal income
and inheritance tax laws, the exten
sion of facilities for agricultural edu
cation, elastic currency reforms, the
regulation of marriage and divorce by
congress, lower tariff or absolute free
trade with the Philippines, a liberal
policy toward Cuba, continuation of ef
forts to bring about world peace, and
to that end the maintenance of a strong
army and navy.
The message, taken as a whole, af
fords congress, not only much to think
about, but to act upon.
Killing Workmen.
According to figures compiled by the
Bridge and Structural Iron Workers
union in Chicago, 147 of its 1.35S mem
bers were either killed or disabled by
accidents while at work. Thirty-four
men lost their lives, thirteen were to
tally disabled, and 100 partially dis
abled. Most of the men killed lost their
lives by falls from steel framework of
buildings in the downtown district. "
People in any city who have watched
workmen toiling away at dizzy heights
in positions most perilous, marvel at
the daring of such workmen. Occasion
ally workmen take unnecessary risks,
but these brave men do not purposely
place themselves in death's way. They
risk their lives in doing work made
necessary by demands of the times.
Their skill and daring cannot be too
greatly praised.
And the people will agree with the
Chicago Daily News that the grim ac
cidents in this hazardous yet necessary
employment, show conclusively the
need of a well-considered law establish
ing workingmen's insurance.
The man who sacrifices his life, limb
or health in work which the commun
ity requires, should have compensation
for the lost wages.
The Fifty-ninth Congress.
At high noon yesterday the short
session of the 59th congress convened.
While appropriation measures will oc
cupy the most attention, and while gen-
eral legislation will be side-stepped as
much as possible, some fun, serious
fun, perhaps, is promised in the pres
ent assembly.
Much interest centers, for instance.
around the tariff and ship subsidy
questions, which are loaded with po
litical significance, and which the peo
ple are watching. Then, too. there is the
trust question, and a number of other
matters of vital interest. The repub
lican party has a big majority In this
congress, and realize the party will be
held responsible.
There are three forces that will en
hance interest in the republican par
ty's analysis and action on the tariff.
There are the "stand-patters," who rad
ically oppose tariff changes; "revision
ists," who want to revise the tariff, and
professional office grabbers who are
uninfluenced by ideas of principle, but
who, like circus "supes," want to lead
the G. O. P. elephant where it can be
seen to best advantage. This third
class is numerically strong, and may
be termed the "up-in-the-air" class.
They will fall in line when their places
are pointed out by Roosevelt, Root,
Cannon and other republican ring
masters who will furnish the motive
power for this session. The question
A tiesson of the Campaign.
Ex-Governor Benjamin B. Odell, of
New York, is a thorough-going ma
chine politician, who has all his life
been accustomed to look upon the vot
ers of the city and his state as so many
stepping stones to preferment in his
chosen career. But he has been study
ing the returns of Tuesday's election
to some purpose, and the lesson they
have imparted to him is more likely
to exercise a lasting influence upon
those who guide the councils of his
party in New York for many a year to
come.
"From this time forward," says Gov
ernor Odell. analyzing the strength and
character of the forces that gave the
Hearst movement Its impetus, "the re
publican party must give greater heed
to the demand of the people for the
betterment of conditions, and less to
the ambitions of politicians." The dem
ocrats have all along accused the re
publican party with false pretenses.
There cannot be a doubt but the repub
lican party has paid a great deal of
attention to the requirements of trusts
and bosses and but little to the require
ments of the people.

PRACTICAL MARRIAGE.
Original.
There is no element In a man's life
that contributes more to his success or
failure than the woman he chooses for
a helpmeet.
Ralph Bawnard married a girl who
thought more of her present comfort
than keeping her husband In those
channels for which he was fitted. No
sooner did he begin to win a compe
tence In one field than she proceeded
to remove him to another. She dis
liked the country, so 6he made bis life
miserable till he pulled up stakes and
went to the city. Then she took It Into
her head that she preferred to live lu
the same place with his mother, and
they moved again. A rolling stone
gathers no moss, and the Bawnard
family gathered only debts.
One day a young woman of pleas
Ing appearance called at Bawuard's of
fice to collect a debt of long standing.
Bawnard asked her If she knew where
he could borrow the money ($100) on
his note. "At what interest?" asked
the girl. "I'll pay as high as 3 per cent
a month," was the reply. "For how
longV" "Oh, as long as you like
three years." The girl thought awhile
then said she would lend him the mou
ey herself. "Give me your note for
$8," she said, "and we will be square."
Bawnard asked her what she meant.
"The amount loaned is $100, the in
terest $108. You will owe nie $3 and
get no money."
Bawnard was taught a lesson that he
never forgot.
Five years passed. Bawnard was n
widower. From the time of his wife's
death he managed his affairs with
proper care and got them in fair con
dition. He was very louely, but he
was untrammeled. and it was possi
ble fr him to remain in one place and
accumulate. The only drawback finan
cially was that be had no one to at
tend to the buying of houseliold sup
plies, which needed constant attention,
since prices were rising with frightful
rapidity. His capital was still limit
ed, and he was not yet very quick pay.
This kept him from that financial good
standing which enables a man to got
on.
One day the same woman, collector
who had called upon him before came
to his ollice to collect a debt. She
looked tidy and thrifty, and what little
she said was to the point. Bawnard
kept her talking as long as he could.
He had the money to pay with, but he
did not care to pay. He was thinking
what a valuable woman the collector
was. Bawnard chatted with her good
naturedly and drew her into common
place affairs, quietly drawing her out.
He soon made up his mind that she
was a very practical as well as at
tractive young woman. Thus he won
her sympathy by telling her his trou
bles, assured her that he was doing
the best he could and ended by offer
ing to pay up the indebtedness by in
stallments. If she would call every
Saturday afternoon he would pay
something on account till the matter
was settled. To this she agreed and
took her departure.
The next Saturday she called, and
Bawnard In addition to the Installment
had a few flowers for her, an acknowl
edgment, he said, of her kindness, her
trouble and her patience. She accept
ed them gladly and warmed to the
donor. The next Saturday after that
a buggy was standing at the door, and
he Invited her to take a drive. He
said she would oblige him by doing
so; that he was not very well, he need
ed recreation and had no companion
unless she would go with him. To
show her that he was not using money
that should go to pay his account he
gave her a double Installment.
During the ride he told her that he
had two nice little tots at home, but
had no suitable person to take care of
them. She pitied the ioor widower
and said she would like to see them.
He gave his home address, and during
the next week she went in and spent
an hour with them. Then followed
some toys. On her next coming to the
office she gave him an invitation to
call upon her.
Bawnard called and was Impressed
with the pleasant appearance" of the
home, which was under the care of the
young woman herself. lie was espe
cially struck with tbJ homemade cur
tains, tablecloths Indeed, all articles
that could be produced without being
paid for. He made several calls and
with each call was still more of the
opinion that some young man who con
siders merely a pretty face and coy
ways the proper attribtites for a house
keeper was losing an opportunity.
The next Saturday afternoon when
the collector called Bawnard, bein?
alone In the office, handed her the re
mainder of the money due and took
her receipt for the account in full.
Then he said to her:
"Since our acquaintance began with
a matter of business I. wish it to con
tinue as a matter of business. Usually
affairs between men and women begin
with love and end with business. That
is the reason why marriage is said to
be a lottery. I have observed that you
are a sensible, frugal woman, with
good business qualifications. I offer
you the position of wife and house
keeper. If you accept you may be sure
of my love.
The offer was accepted, and Ralph
married his second wife. In her he
found a helpmeet who instead of re
tarding him assisted him in getting on.
His children were well taken care of
and. If they did not receive a mother's
affection, did not lack for all that could
be expected from one who was not
their mother. The Improved financial
condition of the father was certainly to
their comfort.
