The treasury officials now estimate
that the government will recover more

by solicitor Wilson, and which led to the
détection of the frauds.

Recent events in the history of San
Francisco more than ever prove the mer
curial character not only of its institu
tions, but of its people. San Francisco
lives upon the Nevada mines. The con
dition of the mines, therefore, has a great
deal of influence upon the business and
temper of the people of San Francisco.
The recent firfc in the bonanzas has de
pressed San Francisco trade. At the
same time the agricultural enterprises of
the state are tempering the sensational
spirit of the San Francisco people.
There is an undergrowth of business in
the city which does not depend upon the
mines, and it will supplant the sensa
tionalism.
Pertinent to the question of &
war with Spain, the New York Herald
publishes a statement of the navies of
all nations. This shows that Spain has
eight "line of battle ships of the first
class," while the United States have not
one. The tonnage of the navies of the
two are about equal, but that of the
United States is largely in amphibious
craft for coast defense. Counting our
inshore craft and all, Spain has a quarter
more guns than we. As we have clung
to the cast-iron smooth bores, in which
no material improvement has been made
m a century, we can not boast of the su
perior power of our gun3. But there is
one source of consolation: the monitors
can not leave onr shores, so our defenders
can not desert us.

Inquiry has been especially made in
relation to 'The Philadelphia University

Livingston University of America'—in

never existed, and the charter of the

of the issue and side of sp"rious diplomas.
The famous submarine tunnel of the
English channel will soon be begun. The
members of the French commission, com
posed for the most part of practical men
and engineers, declare that an under
ground communication between France
and England is only a question of ex
pense, and their report leads to the
belief that the project can be carried out
with less expense than was at first
imagined, and that the danger of leakage
and infiltration will not be so great
was at first supposed. A shaft will short
ly be sunk on the French side of the
channel near Calais, to a depth of 350
feet, for the purpose of hauling up the
earth and rock from the excavation.
There were important disclosures last
week in the trial in St. Louis of McDon
aid for defrauding the revenue. The
man who collected the enormous sums of
blackmail from the distillers was on the
stand. He swore that something like
$400,000 a year was collected and dis
tributed among the thieves for four
years; that the "emoluments" were more
than $8,000 a week, and that one of the
ring who believed in "the policy of si
lence" received $50,000. A bad lot all
around, but the worst of them is this
Megram, who willingly made himself a
confederate of theirs for five years, and
now betrays all the rest in order to retain
his own share of the plunder and keep
out of jail. The St. Louis ring seems to
have been conducted by shrewd and cun
ning men, and it is to be hoped that
their punishment may serve as a warn
ing instead of a profitable trick to be
imitated by unscrupulous officials in
other heavy revenue districts. It is pos
sible thatjthere is some "crooked whisky"
here in New York.
The bank of England clips every light
sovereign that comes into the bank.
Three thousand are weighed in an hour
with one machine. Last year the bank
weighed coin to the amount of $115,500,
000, and rejected $4,200,000, or about
3.6 per cent., as being light gold. For
this amount the bank paid the full value
making a deduction for the deficiency of
weight, which is generally about six or
eight cents per light sovereign. Mr.
Hodgson, M. P., a bank director, says
that in a box of 5,000 sovereigns the
number which will be found to have
turned the point of light weight will
generally be about eight, if they have
not been disturbed, and he adds : " You
are aware that the sovereign which is in
your pocket at 8 o'clock in the morning is
not the same sovereign at 12 o'clock at
night." After this rather alarming an
nouncement it is satisfatory to find Mr.
Hodgson stating also that the charge for
light weight on the eight deficient sov
ereigns would be about four cents per
coin, making only thirty-two cents on
the box of $25,000; so that " it really
amounts to nothing."— Exchange.

From July 1 to Oct. 31, there was a

This month thus far, the receipts are much
larger. The internal revenue receipts
show an increase for July, August, September
and October of $2,400,199, and it is exj>ected
the increase for the present month will be
one million and a half of dollars. The in
crease in the receipts from the increased tax
on distilled spirits has not been as large as
anticipated, but there has been an increase
of receipts from tobacco and snuff, owing to
the change of the tax from 20 to 22 per cent,

Gen. Ord, in command of the depart

More effectual means must be adopted, than
sending troops to look on, while our people
are being despoiled- and murdered; for it is
evident that soldiers, however willing, can do
nothing if confined to this side of the river,
and an order to make reprisals with means
to carry out the order has sometimes resulted
in indemnity as well as security.
General Sherman's report.—The an
nual report of Gen. Sherman, after stating
the geographical limits of the various com

line of the army according to the last re
ports received, is 1,540 officers and 25,031 en
listed men, made up as follows: Five regi
ments of artillery, 270 officers and 2,504 men ;
10 regiments of cavalry, 422 officers and 7,206
men; 25 regiments of infantry, 848 officers and
11,000 men, available recruits, hospital
stewards, ordnance sergeants, etc., 33,201.
During the past winter troops in the depart
ments of Missouri and Texas were employed
in arduous and severe winter campaigns
against the Kiowa, Cheyenne and Comanche
Indians on the Staked Plains, that have for
years been engaged in depredations on the
Texas and Kansas frontier, resulting m their
disarmment and subjection to authority. If
military commanders can have control over
supplies needed by these Indians, as they 0ow
have over their persons, I am convinced, by
a recent visit, that a condition of peace .can
be maintained. The Sioux Indians hav? re
cently made incursious into northern Ne
braska, mostly to steal cattle and horses from
the farms along the Pacific railroad and north
of it. Gen Crook is of the opinion that an
army acting defensively cannot prevent these
incursions, and suggests that troops be ; sta
tioned in the midst of the Indians so as to
watch and prevent them leaving on a -pre
tense of hunting. This is impracticable unless
the army can have supervision of the neces
sary supplies of these tribes within th<i re
servation; whieh is now not the case. The
reports of several commissioners, which have
under military escort recently been engaged
in exploring the country and in negotiating
with these Indians, will throw much light on
this subject. Generally speaking, the damage
to life and prosperity by the Indians lis be
lieved to be less during the past year than in
any former year, and the prospect is that as
the country settles up it will be less and less
each year until all the Indians are established
on small reservations; but until they acquire
habits of industry in farming orstock-raistng
they will need food from the government, be
cause the game on which they have hitherto
subsided has diminished rapidly.
A HODKIi MAIDED
Little maid with downcast look,
And a glancc not yet love laden,
Stand within yon shady niK>k—
Bean old man's model maiden.
Listen whilst lie tells you stories,
Tells of lift- and all its glories,
0(>ening now u |k »n your view—
Past for him—to come for you.
Years ago one lived for him
(Gracious, how existence passes!
Sure the light is growing dim :
Something has hedew'd his glasses)—
One there lived, from him to claim
Earth's most venerated name:
Ere his darling learnt to toddle
She became his maiden model.
Years she stay'd with him—how few
Seeni'd they when their course was flowing!—
Lived to In? as old as you—
Lives on many a canvas glowing;
Lives in pictured memory.
Though his eyes 110 longer see,
Since aloft the angles caught her—
Iiis beloved model daughter.
Little maiden, you must smile—
Why, I vow, my model's crying !—
Nay, 'tis purely pagan style
When we speak of children «lying.
Who would hid the lost ones roam
Earthwards from that brighter hume?
Kather live to join the chorus
Of the loved ones gone before us.
So, my model smiles again :
Clouds and sunshine blend together,
Like c lear shining after rain
In the pleasant April weather.
Such of life the motto be,
Still keep childhood's purity.
Happier lot than earthly Aden—
Always be;a model maiden !

Where are the songs and laughs
Nor June might live nor July st:
To Southern eaves our birds have
From lilies low and roses dead :
The swallows long have taken flight
From waters wau and lost delight ;
All things of ■summer sweetness die,
Yet joy why droop and life why sigh?
Color and hue and sunshine wane,
But only die to live again;
Ever again the lost Is found,
The found is lost in lime's swift round.
Why mourn for loss? Why hold it strange,
Beautv should dim and fairness change?
That, for blue heavens, gray skies should con
For warbling boughs but woodlands dumb?
Why so should fair things tleet ? we say ;
Why should white winter t*»mb sweet May '. 1
Ah, senseless sorrow, Death supplies
A dearer charm to all that dies.
Were rose and lily always here,
Lily and rose were both less dear;
Hue, odor, bloom, and !eaf but wane
And die, more dear to live again.

' Hang Miss Ashurst!"
'Oh, Phil!"
' Well, I can't help it. Why docs
she come to spoil everything? Don't I
know how it will be?—always Miss
\shurst to be considered, taken about,
included in everything. No more drives
and boat-rows, just you and me, Amy;
no more evenings on the door-step. I
declare I've a great mind to go over to
Uncle Phil's at Goshen for a month."
" Now, Phil, please (coaxingly.) "It
won't be so bad as you think. Besides,
you may like her very much. Mother
says her mother was the greatest beauty
in Connecticut."
' She isn't a beauty, though; I'll bet
on that. A talking, writing, society wo
man— I hate the kind. Amy, will you
go out for a row? We'll have pne more
while the boat is all our own."
This confabulation was held on either
side of the Widow Mauran's garden gate
a model gate for purposes of conversa
tion, just high enough and wide enough
to accommodate two pairs of elbows, and
allow the owners of the elbows to look
easily into each other's eyes. Phil
smiled into Amy's as he swung wide the
barrier. He offered his arm, she took it,
and they sauntered down to the shore.
They were a picturesque couple to look
at. Tall Phil, in spite of his momentary
ill-temper, possessed a frank, handsome
face lit with fine eyes and the sweetest
of smiles; while little Amy's modest,
wild-flower beauty was exquisite in its
way. Second cousins, intimate friends,
all but declared lovers, it was a pleasant
matter of course that they should be al
ways together; and in spite of Amy's
disclaimers, she was at the bottom of her
heart as sorry as Phil at this interruption
to their tete-a-tete —as sorry or sorrier;
for blended with her regret was the in
stinctive apprehension of a girlish heart,
which, pledged in fact though not in
name, grieves with the unspoken dread
that some other woman may yet pass by
to snatch from her very lips the coveted
un tasted cup in whose depth lies, or
seems to lie, all the best sweetness of
coming life. It was a comfort to have
Philip so cross about it, however; and in
the effort to soothe him, she, woman-like,
forgot her own annoyance. So the even
ing ended happily.
Next day brought the expected guest.
Amy's first glance sent her heart to
quaking again. Never had she seen a
woman in the least like this. Rose
Ashurst was one of those born enchant
resses who reign not only by intention,
but by right. Her beauty would have
been remarkable had not her charm been
more remarkable. Her wit and talent
were balanced by a sweet humor which
pervaded every word and act, and fla
vored all with fascination. Tact, cul
ture, the perfect self-possession which
verges upon self-forgetfulness, lent their
aid to complete her attraction. And all
was real. There was no pretense about
Miss Ashurst. The kind looks which
beamed from her beautiful eyes sprung
from a kind heart. She tfirew herself
into the interest of every human creature
who approached her with a warmth born
of true sympathy. No wonder she was
popular. Popularity hardly spoiled her.
She received Her daily ovations as a mat
ter of course, half indifferently, half
gratefully, but always with a modest
race which enhanced her effect. A
angerous woman this to bring into pro
pinquity with susceptible youths. Poor
Amy!
But Amy, too, felt the charm. The
dazzling bro .vn eyes which had bewitched
so may hearts worked their spell upon
Iter's at once, and she lent delighted aid
in settling the new-comer and her belong
ings. This month in Pemigewasset was a
sudden whim of Miss Ashu rat's. She want
ed quiet and a place to write in, and the
old homestead in which her great-grand
mother was born seeming to meet these
conditions, she wrote to offer herself as
an inmate; and Mrs. Mauran, who was
glad to add to her small income by an
occasional boarder, gave pleased consent.
All manner of pretty things came out of
the trunks to adorn the simple chamber.
Miss Ashurst could not live without/
artistic surroundings, and traveled al
ways with photographs, sketches, books,
small articles of virtu, and bits of bright
color in this or that. These disposed on
walls and table, with daintily frilled and
embroidered covers laid oTer the old
fashioned pillows, an easel with its can
vases and oil-tubs in one corner (Miss
Ashurst painted pictures,) a writing ta
ble exquisitely arranged drawn into the
window (Miss Ashurst wrote books,) a
sweet-faced Madonna painted on ivory, a
few flowers grouped in a classic vase,
made the homely keeping-room chamber
over into a bower of romance, simple
Amy thought. She stood as in a dream,
inhaling the perfume of a wide luxurious
life, of a whole world of sensations and
sights unknown until now, and scarccly
comprehended.
" There!" said Miss Ashurst, giving
the last touch to her vase of clematis
and roses, "now I shall do beautifully.
What a pleasant room this is! The very
exposure I like best, and such a sweet
view! It is just the room to work in. I
am glad your mother let me come, Amy.
I may call you Amy, may I not? We
are relatives, you know—far away, but
tit ill relatives."
"Oh yes, please do," cried Amy,
"every one else calls me so."
"How lovely she is!" was her solil
oquy as she went down stairs. " I won
der what Phil will think of her? He
will be surprised, I'm sure, but lie must
admire her; he can't help it."
She watched the expression of his eyes
at teatime, but it told her nothing. Phil
scarcely spoke. He looked at Miss
Ashurst a great deal, but Amy could
only guess what the looks meant.
" Well?" she said, interrogatively, as
they met on the door-steps after tea.
" Well," responded Phil.
" What do you think? Isn't she
pretty?"
"Pretty!" with an indignant inflec
tion.
"Why, Phil, how can you help think
ing so?"
" Pretty is not the word at all. She is
superb-—beautiful."
"I thought you would think so," said
Amy, cheerfully, but with a little stric
ture at her heart.
" Yes. She's not my style, of course;
but she is a woman in a thousand. No
wonder she has been such a belle'all her
life."
"I'm st> glad you admire lier. Now
you won't mind her being here, and
you'll be polite to her, won't you, Phil ?"
" Oh, yes; I'll do whatever you wish,"
replied Phil, with a carelessness which
was half affected.
" She's v not Philip's style," whispered
Amy to her pillow that night, and fell
asleep with the talismanic sentence on
her lips.
" Alas, how easily things go wrong !
A word too much, or a kiss too long,
And therefalleth a mist and a blinding rain,
And life is never the same again,"
sings George Macdonald. Things went
"wrong" in little Amy's world during
the next fortnight. Was it only the pre
science of coming mists which darkened
the blue, and made the days sad? Was
it only foolish jealousy, or was it some
thing tangible? She made herself mis
erable over these questions. She scolded
herself, but scolding did no good ; the
wrung, hurt feeling would not leave her.
And yet why was she hurt ? Was it not
natural and right that Philip should be
attentive to their guest, who had on him,
as on her, the claim of kindred blood—
this guest who was so charming? For
Amy never denied the charm ; she felt it
herself, too strongly. Was it not the
very thing she had asked him to do?
Yes; but yet—but yet—but yet— All
these reflections ended by deepening the
vague unhappiness. Night after night
she sat alone on the door-step and
watched the boat glide off into the moon
light; Phil at the oars, Miss Ashurst with
the tiller ropes in her white hands.
" Come with us," thev always said; but
when she murmured an excuse, they
passed on cheerfully without her. Yes,
it had come to that : Philip went with
out her, and liked it just as well! The
world—her world—had changed. Would
it ever be the same again? "
Philip was in a temporary dazzle of
admiration ; he neither reasoned nor re
flected. But for Miss Ashurst, no slight
est glimpse of the truth had crossed her
mind. She thought Amy a sweet, pretty
child, but shy, and busy with household
matters, as the only daughter of a widow
in poor circumstances must naturally be.
For Phil, he was charming ; she liked
him best when alone—the truth being
that a slight uneasy consciousness made
him awkward when in company with the
old love, with whom he was somehow a
little " off," and the new, with whom he
was not fairly "on." So Miss Ashurst
was not sorry when Amy refused to join
in the moonlight rows, and knowing no
thing of what had gone before, it did not
strike her as unusual or make her ques
tion. He and Amy were as brother and
sister, she reflected. So her eyes being
sealed by ignorance, and Phil's blinded
as by a sudden spell, Amy's pale cheeks
and woful looks passed unheeded, except
by one pair of eyes which were not
sealed, namely, her mother's.
Mrs. Mauran was a quiet person ; but
her quiet concealed strength and a power
reading character. Instinctively she
"took stock" of all persons with whom
she came in contact, and her instinct
rarely failed. A bitter experience had
taught her how "easy things go wrong"
in this world of ours, and though she
"hated to meddle," and was sorry to lose
her boarder, she resolved to appeal to
the sweetness and nobility which she felt
were the underlying stratum of Miss
Ashurst's nature. It was in this wise
that she accomplished her purpose r
Miss Ashurst and Phil had been off on
a drive prolonged into late twilight. Tea
was over. Phil had strolled down to the
village after the mail, and Mrs. Mauran
sat beside her guest in the shaded porch.
"Where is Amy?" asked Miss Ash
urst.
" Gone to bed with a bad headache,"
said Mrs. Mauran.
"A headache? I am so sorry! Isn't
there something out of my medicine
case which would relieve her?—Pulsatil
la, perhaps, or iris." Miss Ashurst was a
devoted homeopath.
" I think there is something. Not out
of your case, however," replied Mrs.
MauraD, quietly.
" What can you mean?"
" My dear Miss Ashurst, may I speak
frankly to you about something that is
on my mind ? And will you not think
me unkind or impertinent?"
" I amquitesure you could be neither."
" I want to tell you a little story which
concerns Phil and Amy."
" Phil and Amy !"
" Yes. They arc second cousins, as
you know. Phil's father was my moat
intimate friend, and the children were
naturally brougl/i up together. Last
spring Phil, who trusts me as if I were
his mother, begged my leave to ask Amy
to be his wife." She paused a moment.
Miss Ashurt said nothing, only leaned
forward a little and listened. " I told
him that Amy was so young that he had
better wait a few months before he said
anything. I wish I hadn't."
" I don't know why. It might have
IK'cn better. Since that time 1'liil has
seen a woman a little older, far more
beautiful, than my little «rirl, richer in
all that life has to give, but not richer as
far as he is concerned, for she has no
love to give him, and Amy has. If she
had, if she could, I should not speak. If
1 did not know that she is as true and as
good as she is beautiful, I should not
speak. As it is. I do."
"My dear Mrs. Mauran —thank you,"
said Miss Ashurst, as last. " You were
right to speak. I have made mischief,
but without knowing it. You are sure
of that, I hope."
" I am sure of it."
" Phil is a charming person. I like
hiin extremely, and of course I saw that
he—liked me. Hut I never thought of
it as a serious thing. A great many other
people have felt the same, and have got
ten over it."
" Phil will tret over it also. He has
loved you but three weeks, and Amy
three years. It is a glamour, which will
wear off."
Miss Ashurst smiled still, but less
brightly. It is not pleasant to he agreed
with so cordially in matters of this kind.
" Yes," she said ; "it is, as you say, a
glamour. It will disappear as 1 disappear.
And the sooner that disappearance takes
place the better. I shall have a letter
this evening which will oblige me to
leave you day after to-morrow. Will
that do ?"
" My dear Miss Ashurst, my dear kins
woman, believe me when I say that I am
truly sorry that anything must make you
go. You are what 1 thought, what I
trusted, and I thank you with all my
heart."
" And I thank you for trusting me,"
replied Miss Ashurst.
But after she went upstairs her (ace
changed. Long she stood at the window
looking out at the dim-tinted sea.
" It has been very nice," she whispered
to herself at last. " But this is foolish.
I must go to bed."
Miss Ashurst's letter of recall came,
and on the day fixed she left. Amy,
dazed, as it were, by this sudden de
parture, reproached herself heartily for
feeling glad. This reproach deepened
into remorse when, the farewells spoken
and the beautiful radiant presence van
ished, she found her walls and table orna
mented with good-by gifts. There were
the photographs she had most admired,
the books, even the Madonna, ivory
painted and velvet-swung, all left for
her by her sweet-hearted rival. A mist
of penitent tears dimmed her eyes; but
in spite of penitence and of tears, she was
glad. For Phil, the rattle of the wheels
which bore his charmer away was like
the sound which breaks sharply into some
fantastic dream.
Metaphorically speaking, he rubbed
his eyes. For a day or two he hung
about, vacant and listless ; then he
roused, as desirous to pick up dropped
threads again. Somehow Amy was more
difficult of approach than of yore. A
little veil rested between them. She was
not always to be had when wanted. We
value what we work for, what we hold
with some trembling sense of insecurity.
As weeks went on, Phil grew to prize
Amy more than ever. The knowledge
that he had half lost her intensified his
love. It required months to win his
way back to the old place. But at last—
"And you are quite, quite sure that
you care most for me ?" whispered Amy,
saucily, the night after their engage
ment.
"Most? Altogether, you mean. There
is no other."
" Not even Miss Ashurst ?"
"Not even Miss Ashurst; though"—
and Phil lifted his cap as beiore a queen
—" she is a stunner, a real lady, every
inch of her, and as good as she is beauti
ful. Bless her!"
And bless her, say we.
Felt Sad About It .—A story is lately
current at Hartford of one of the city
clergymen who is famous for his manly,
earnest good fellowship. He was traveling
on the cars on the New York & New Haven
road, not long since, engaged in a pleas
ant chat with a friend, when he was re
peatedly annoyed by a drunken bummer
in the seat in fro it, who persisted in at
tempting to engage him in conversation.
At last, wearied beyond endurance, the
clergyman arose, and turning the. man
sharply away from him, said, " You are
drunk, and I don't wish to hear or see
anything more of you." The bummer
sank into silence for a moment, and then
once more turned, and, gazing reproach
fully at the clergyman, exclaimed, so as
to be heard nearly the whole extent of
the car by the passengers, whose atten
tion had generally been directed that
way, " Mr. T , 'jiears to me you
don't care anything at all 'bout my soul."

writers have the greatest difficulty in
finding accurate equivalents in their
own language for European words used
to denote recent European discoveries
and scientific terms. They are almost
always obliged to paraphrase; thus dy
namite becomes "the powerful thing,"
torpedo" under-waterburster," and soon.
The great evil is that each different
writer chooses his own paraphrase for
such terms as "polarization" "spectro
scope," "protoplasm," etc.— Pall Mall

Conflicting Reports of the Cotton Crop.
The New York Herald calls attention
to a matter of supreme importance to
all growers, dealers in, and manufactur
ers of cotton—the apparently irreconcila
ble difference between the reports of the
national cotton exchange and those of
the agricultural bureau at Washington—
and gives the annexed table, comprising
the estimates of the crop of the United
States, based on October and November
reports from those sources, as showing
the inconsistencies and contradictions
complained of :
Cotton Agricultural Average.
Exchange, Bureau,
bale». bale«. )*aies.
October 3,876,000 4,222,000 1,049.000

Averages 4,036,000 4,fêî7,000 4,03f,000
In New York, the impression seems to
prevail that the report of the national
cotton exchange for Octoiler was manip
ulated in the interest of the bull party*
to the speculation which was then in
progress ; and it is also believed that the
construction which has been put upon
the November report of the bureau is
forced and unnatural—ignoring, perhaps,
the increased acreage, and the fact that
the increased percentages of yield take
place in sections where the greater pro
portion of the crop is usually grown, and
the decreased percentages in sections
where the growth of cotton is at best not
large. Should the November estimate
of the agricultural bureau prove correct,
the receipts at the ports must hencefortli
show a falling off.
