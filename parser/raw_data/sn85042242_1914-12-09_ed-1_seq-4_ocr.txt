WILSON'S MESSAGE.
One of the outstanding features of
President Wilson's message to Con­
gress is the absence of any reference
to legislation touching business. The
Democratic party leaders are siware
that this is no time to push further
their program of trust legislation.
There is little unusual in the mes­
sage. It touches specifically upon few
points. There is no reference to the
Mexican, situation, the administration
is evidently willing to consider inter­
vention there a closed incident.
'President Wilson is right in urg­
ing the passage of legislation which
will permit the creation of a mer­
chant marine through federal aid. He
makes it plain that the entry of the
government into this Held of action
will be merely temporary and when
private capital is attracted, the gov­
ernment should withdraw.
The chief executive shows that his
sympathies do not lie on the side of
big armaments, great national de­
fenses and a large standing army.
On this point he says:
"We never have had, and while we
retain our present principles and
ideals -we never shall have a large
standing army."
'He advocates, however, military
training, but makes no specific recom­
mendations as to extending the vol­
unteer service.
But many will hardly agree with the
following, in view of the plight in
which all Europe finds herself:
"But I turn away from the sub­
ject. It i3 uot new. There is no new
need to discuss it. We shall not alter
our attitude toward it because some
amongst us are nervous and excited.
We shall easily and sensibly agree
upon a policy of defense. The ques­
tion has uot changed its aspects be­
cause the times are not normal. Our
policy will not toe for an occasion. It
will be conceived as a permanent and
settled thing, which we will pursue at
all seasons, without haste and after
a fashion perfectly consistent with
the peace of the world, the abiding
friendship of states, and the unham­
pered freedom of all with whom we
deal. Let there be no misconception.
The country has been misinformed.
We have not beeu negligent of na­
tional defense. We are not unmind­
ful of the great responsibility resting
upon us. Wfe shall learn and profit
by the lesson of every experience and
every new circumstance and what is
needed will ibe adequately done."
Aside from the merits of the issue,
t}ie Germans to date have .put up the
b^st fight. Tlie victory at Lodz will
gm down in military annals.
Sfameone should open a relief fund
for the unfortunate 'bystander at!
faomfe. Eastern reports show that
tile associations are liard push­
ed td care for the poor within our
own aomain.
BABIES AND HOGS.
Recently a country newspaper an
niMiiiced that 3,047 hogs had been
lost from cholera and placed their
value at $29,855. In the same couuty
during that period, 7-1 babies died of
cholera Infantum. Their value was
estimated in economic figures as being
$148,000. While tho comparison was
merely arbitrary and done to show
the economic waste caused even when
himians die, the paper which publish­
ed the hog loss refused to give tlio
baby item any publicity.
JIow to prevent infant mortality is
becoming more and more a serious
study in the different communities.
Tho science of child welfare is being
placed upon a practical basis, and
few communities now are as far 'be­
hind as that one whicli seemed to
think loss from hog cholera of great­
er news value than the loss of babies
through an epidemic.
There is great room for improve
meat yet. In many localities the dis
eases of animals receivo more atten
tion from state and federal officials
than tho various ills^ which claim
thousands as their victims among hu
man beings.
When a baby pig dies, tife farmer
realizes that the death represents a
money loss and that, the death should
have been prevented.
While grief and a sense of loss is
more potent when a child dies, the
economic waste is not considered.
The death is viewed largely from the
sentimental side.
But there is a great economic waste
there and some organization similar
to that which stamps out epidemics
among animals under the stimulus of
federal and state support should also
safeguard the health of the men, wom­
en and children.
•Local health boards and states are
doing much, but a federal health
board is necessary just as a federal
animal husbandry department is vital
lo the agricultural growth of the na­
tion.
PERSONAL EFFICIENCY.
And now, after we have organized
our establishment, and systcmatizeC
our work and card-indexed our time}
and reduced our motions to their low­
est terms, we come to the most diltl
eult matter of all, the Question of tho
efficiency of the individual. Is the
reader doing as "well by himself as he
is by his business? Is lie as success­
ful in attaining the aims that lie
thinks most desirable, whatever these
may be, as lie is in achieving the
ends of his profession? Is he making
as much out. of life as lie ought to
make? Let us, in accordance with
the spirit of the time refer the ques
lion to an expert, the iinost expert of
modern analysts of tho human mind,
Professor William .lames. In his soul
stirring essay on "The Energies of
Man," lie says:
"The human individual lives usual­
ly far within his limits. He possesses
powers of various sort which lie habi­
tually fail lo use. We energizes be­
low his maximum and he behaves be­
low his optimum, Compared
with what we ought, to be, we are only
half awake. Our llres are damped,
our drafts are checked. We are mak­
ing use of only a small part of our
possible 'mental and physical resourc­
es."
In this expert opinion we would all
concur from our own experience. But,
when Ave pass from diagnosis to rem­
edy it is found, as usual, that doctors
disagree. How can we tap these un­
utilized reservoirs of power and emo­
tion that we feel within U3? Profes­
sor James says by prayer. Professor
Chittenden says by fasting he would
have us cut down our calories and
protein by half. Mr. 'Edison would
cut down our sleep by half three or
four hours every day or so when we
have nothing else to do. Heart and
lungs never sleep why need hands
and brain?
Perhaps we do eat and sleep too
much, though personally
Ave
are some-
what skeptical of the desirability of
much curtailment of the restorative
functions of the body. But at least
we ought to see to it that we eat and
sleep efficiently, that we do not cheat
our stomachs to please our palates,
and do not dawdle away our bedtime.
Listening to the clock strike at night
is as lazy habit as watching it in busi­
ness hours. And when
Ave
go in for
pleasure purely we should look out
that we get the worth of our time
and money. We ought not to waste
OUT*
playtime in doing anything .less
than what we most delight in doing
so far as that is attainable. This also

Japan in
a Business Way, Say the
Financiers.
Tokio, Dec. 8.—Big business inter­
ests of apan, some of which have op­
posed from the start the participation
of Japan in the war, are Avondering
how Japan will be able to borrow
needed money from now on. "The
war may be necessary for Japan from
a political and ethical standpoint,"
said a prominent banker to the cor­
respondent of the Associated iPress,
"but I wonder if it will ibe a good
thing for business. Moreover, I think
it will be impossible for Japan to bor­
row money in Europe Avitliin the® fl«re
or seven years following the close of
the war."
Japan, he continued, desired to go
on with her work of commercial and
financial development. The European
money market being closed, bankers
'were, asking themselves whether it
would be possible to secure loans in
the United States. The ibusiness in­
terests were anxious to create closer
and more extensive business relations
With the United States and to make
the Pacific ocean a sphere not only
of peace but of greater commercial
activity. It was evident, he said, thai
there existed, in Japan today a power­
ful current of opinion in this direction
which was opposed to any considera­
tion of local political party strife in­
terfering Avitli such a trade and com­
mercial development.
Tajiri Writes.
Viscount Inajiro Tajiri, president o£
the board of auditors, who studied
economics and finance at "Yale univer­
sity, has written this month about the
fundamental solution of Japanese fin­
ance, which he considered the tmost
difficult problem that Japan has to
face. In Japan, it was perhaps, more
difficult than ia any other country iu
the world and yet there was no coun­
try on earth where there Avas such
hope for the future, if all -classes con­
tinued to co-operate toward the one
end of financial consolidation.
He Avrote:
"The question that most vitally af­
fects national finance in this country
is that of food. Itis, in fact, the
great fundamental problem of the na­
tion. Solve this problem and thc
problem of finance *s solved. iAt pres­
ent our food supply is deficient anc
renders us a debtor nation. This is
reflected in our excess of imports over

PIOTRKO dOPOT«:HNO.
GERMANS BEGIN OFFENSIVE FROM SIERADZ, RELIEVING CORPS NEAR LODZ.
It is reported from Petrograd that there has been a concentration of German troops from the west and
that a new offensive movement from Sieradz has led to a desperate encmnter. This would account for the
reported relief of the German army corps Avhich was almost surrounded by the Russians near Lodz. Both
sides claim to have taken an enormous number of prisoners.
exports, and our unfavorable balance
of trade generally. The government
is in debt and private enterprise is in
debt to the extent of hundreds of mil­
lions. Many of our municipalities
are in debt, too. More than 200,000,
000 yen (.$100,000 0(H)) of our business
capital is foreign money.
"It is not too much to say that tho
whole difficulty lies if. our deficiency
in food supply, chiefly in rice, the staff
of life in Japan.''
Dr. Tajiri pointed out that the ai
niinl supply of rice was deficient, and'
Avas
made more so by the annual con­
sumption of 20,000,000 bushels by the
breweries for making the native drink
culled sake. In eating rice, much of
which she imported, Japan was eating
verily "the money of the usurer." It
would be a. long time before Japan be­
came a creditor nation, and in addi­
tion to adopting the remedies of re­
organization: of commerce and indus­
try and moKe extensive colonization,
Japan must, readjust, her cultivated
land so as to insure an annual in­
crease in the rice crops of at least
35,000,000 bushels. 'lie declared:
"If we go on importing "the most
necessary articles of food and export
only luxuries and ornaments we can
not^bjring about the desired change."
Muclf could be done, he thinks, by ex­
terminating injurious insects which
destroy 75,000,000 bushels of rice ev­
ery year. lnipro"ed methods would in­!
crease crops in Hokkaido, Korea and
Formosa. In the south two crops a
year could easily be raised.
Agriculture Important.
"What Japan has to do is to make
agriculture the main vocation of the
people. Let lier become as successful
a commercial and industrial peopie as
she may, yet she should never forget
that
without agriculture there is no
hope for her a& a nation. Agricultur­
al reforms constitute the best policy
for promoting national economy. It is
tile ill-considered notion that, industry
rather than agriculture, should be the
foundation of national economy that
leads so many young men of Japan lo
forsake the iand and wander to the
cities, where they come to nothing.
"Another necessary reform relates
to foreign trade. Instead of importing
necessities and exporting luxuries,
Japan's goal should be to export the
necessities. She should learn to grow
her own cotton, as she is now attempt­
ing to do in Korea."
Iln conclusion, Viscount Tajiri warns
liis fellow countrymen thus:
"Japan needs to be careful to guard
against the western tendency to run
after ornament and to be reckless of
tue more practical things of life. Our
people should think more about the
substance and maning of life. The
foundation of national economy de­
pends much upon the economy of in­
dividuals. If we began by reforms in
the supply and consumption of food
and then Avent on to improve com­
merce and industry we wduld be tak­
ing the right and natural course.'

FOREST NOTES. .»
•White pine and yellow pine are the
woods most used for boxes, and eacii
contributes more than a billion feet
to the box industry annually.
The annual cut of British Columbia
timber is approximately a billion feet.
There are 420 mills and 790 logging
cainps in the province, employing
about 60,000 men.
The Massachusetts Forestry associ­
ation offers as -a prize the planting of
50 acres of white pine, to the town
Avthdch gains first place in a contest
for town forests.
The Boise National forest in Idaho
had 30 fires during the past summer,
yet 28 were held down to less than
10 acres, and of those 15 were less
than one-quarter of an acre. The
supervisor sayvs this success was due
to a lookout tower, and to efficient
telephone and telegraph service.
Because of the war, English manu­
facturers and consumers, of wood pulp
have been caused considerable un­
easiness. Production is at a stand­
still in the countries at war, and in
Norway a-nd Sweden, principal sources
of siupply, imills have been greatlv
(hampered because of a lack of coal
and of chemicals. England has prac­
tically no domestic sources of pulp.
