FRIDAY DECEMBER i 1914
Cuyahoga county democrats have

Cleveland as the democratic candidate
ior governor of Ohio In 1916 Well
Newton Is fit

unable to escape them
By a unanimous vote the senate on

Charles S Whitman former Can
field boy elected governor of New
York Is credited with having offered
the position of district attorney of

A movement started In Warren to

momentum and it will not be surpris
ing if that desirable end Is accomp
lished The entire country Is Inter
ested In the plan proposed and It is
bolloved that this government will
make tho request which there Is rea
son to think will bo granted
In commenting upon the probability
of petitions being circulated In Raven
na asking for an election under the
Beal law the Democrat says The
prevailing sentiment in Ravenna is
undoubtedly for a dry town and the
Beal law election will probably result
in a vote of approval for present con
ditions But tho fact that the peoplo
of Ohio are very erratic and only a
few short weeks ago repudiated Gov
Cox because ho believed In good laws
rigorously enforced casts a shadow of
doubt upon the result of any election
Tho secret ballot is a mighty good
place to voto personal prejudice and
passion at the expense of gcod demo
cratic government
Gen Isaac R Sherwood congress
man from tho Toledo district whoso
wife was a Poland girl is determined
dn his light against militarism In tho
United States and a host of people aro
In sympathy with him Gen Sher
wood served with distinguished gal
lantry through tho civil war and Is
qualified to speak aulhorltlvcly upon
the subject which will bo an import
ant issue during the present short
session of congress In an Interview
tho other day Gen Sherwood said
We aro today the only great nation
nt peace with all tho world In our
entire career of a century and a quar
ter of national life no foreign power
has ever declared war against us In
stead of further wasting C9 per cent of
all the enormous revenues of tU9 gov
ernment In preparation for future
wars that are sure never to happen
let us legislate to make our present
peace permanent and perpetual

High spots of message
from wilson to congress
President Wilson In addrrESlng
Congress Tuesday said In part
When half of the world is on fire
we shall bo careful to make our moral
Insurance against the spread of the
conflagration very definite and certain
and adequate indeed
We aro the champions of peace and
of concord and we should bi very
jealous of this distinction which we
have sought to earn
If asked Are you ready to defend
yourselves we reply Most assured
ly to the utmost and yet wo shall
not turn America Into a military camp
We will not ask our young men
to spend the best years of their lives
making soldiers of themselves
We have always found means to
defend ourselves against attack and
We snail nnd them whenever it is nee
essary without calling our people from
their necessary tasks to render com
pulsory military service In times of
peace
The United States should be ready
as never before to serve itself and to
serve mankind ready with Its ro
sources Its energies Its forces of pro
ductlon and Its means of distribution
We shall not alter our attitude
toward our army and navy because
some among us are nervous and ex
cited
It Is right that the National Guard
of tho states should bo developed and
strengthened by every means which Is
not inconsistent with our obligations
to our own people or with the estab
lished policy of our Government
While wo have worked at our tasks
of peace the circumstances of the
whole ago have been altered by war
A powerful navy wo have always
regarded as our proper and natural
means of defense and it has always
been of defense that wo have thought
never of aggression or of conquest
We have grossly erred in the way
In which wo have stunted and hinder
ed the development of our merchant
marine
Our program of legislation with re
gard to the regulation of business is
virtually complete The road at last
lies clear and firm before business
ino government must open our
gates of trade to South America op
en them wide before streams of mer
chandlso will flow through them
Give a larger self government to
the people of tho Philippines
THEIR SECOND CHOICE
Claiming that a total of raoro than
1700000 progressive votes were cast
at tho recent election progressives in
conference at Chicago show no indl
cation of an intention of retiring as a
party from the national field Counled
with their purchase the other flay of
a morning ana evening dally newspa
per at iioston the progressive attltudj
shown at Chicago may be taken to
promise several hard fights yet beiore
leaders of tho party will bo willing to
quit
Even more interesting than the pro
attitude toward the ques
tion of their own dissolution is their
declaration also at Chicago that If
they find they havo no hone of electlnc
one from their own ranks presdent in
mo tney will turn to President Wt-
son Between the reactionary ele
ments now In control of the republi
can party and the party of Woodrow
wiison tho choice for conscientious
supporters of progressive principles 13
oasily for the latter
Progressives claim some of the
credit for Mr Wilsons nomination at
Baltimore and undoubtedly are enat
led to some of it The renomlnatlon
of William H Taft preceded the Bal
timore gathering Democrats knew
that the Taft candidacy wjiuld tend
to consolidate the ultra conservative
vote behind him It was as yet un
certain how far the Roosevelt revolt
would go a great mass of progressive
republican sentiment was in a wait
ing mood to see who would offer a
presidential nominee worthy its sup
port
Had the republicans been au nit be
hind President Taft the result at
Baltimore might have been different
It would not however have been as
fortunate for the country or the party
And all things considered it nay be
believed a footless Inquiry as to what
might have occurred at Baltimore un
der different circumstances
Certainly no one will begrudge the
progressives -their admiration for
President Wilson Their suport In
1916 will be welcome and logical for
no candidacy except that of Woodrow
Wilson is likely to offer any reason
able promise of continued progressive
legislation Cleveland Plain Dealer
