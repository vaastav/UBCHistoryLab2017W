RETURN TO SPAIN
ZELAYA VERDICT
International Tangle Over Nic
araguan Exile Is Ended by
Compromise.
Washington, Dec. 2. The interna
t i ona.1 axrgy ttf QA)iuweuPein the
United ' SCaferB of' 3? Santos Zelaya,
former . president of Nicaragua, ap
parently was solved last night by Ze
lava agreeing to return to Barcelona,
Spain, wnence he came to Kew York
a month ago.
This agreement came as the result
of a day of conference at the state
department between Solicitor Folk
and counsel for both Zelaya and the
Nlcaraguan government. In promis
ing to leave the country, Zelaya stip
ulated that he should have ample time
to transact some important business
matters.
Speaking with his counsel, Cory M.
Stadden, over the long distance tele
phone from New York, Zelaya said
the next boat from New York to Bar
celona did not sail until Dec. 11, and
said he thought he -could finish his
business in that time.
State department officials insist
that when the deposed dictator de
parts he go direct to Barcelona and
that in the interim he enter into no
political intrigues involving Nicar
agua. This arrangement proved agreeable
to Charles A. Douglas, counsel for the
Nlcaraguan government in the nego
tiations that have followed the arrest
in Nevv York.
Upon Mr. Douglas' advice General
Chamorra, Nicaraguan minister here,
cabled the Nicaraguan foreign office,
suggesting the cancellation of that
government's request, now in the
mails, for extradition of the former
president for trial for the alleged mur
der of two of his countrymen at Ma
saya, in April, 1901.
Zelaya, from the outset, has main
tained that the offenses alleged
against hin were political and that
upon hearing be could prove that the
two murders alleged against Him were
committed at different times and
dates in Nicaragua and without his
knowledge.
Washington, Dec. 2. At the state
department today the Zelaya case was
considered closed. The former dic
tator's release in New York is expect
ed by nightfall, with thj agreement
that he return U Barcelona, Spain.

FARMERSARE
READYTO AID
EGG COST CUT
High Price Solution Of
fered by Illinois State
Institute.
SELL DIRECT, THE PLAN
All Producer Desires Is That
He Be Guaranteed Steady
Market.
Chicago, 111., Dec. 2. A solution of
the high prices of eggs was offered
today by the Illinois Farmers' Insti
tute, in annual session. Word was
sent to Chicago club women who are
conducting a boycott campaign that
the farmers w-olld be willing to sell
direct to consumers if assured of a
steady market.
In the discussion today at the ses
sion of the institution. Professor H. A.
Bittenbander of Iowa State Agricul-
tuial college said the farmers had been
trying for years to find a way to elim
inate a situation that threatens to
send eggs up to 60 ents or more,
when hens are not laying, while in
the spring there arc mora eggs than
there is a market for.
'He said it had been found the farm
ers could handle eggs and poultry
through creamery associations in such
a way that they could save money
and give the consumer the benefit of
reduced cost in handling. All that re
mained to do, he said, was for the con
sumer to carry out his part.
Still Going Up.
Prices of "ordinary firsts" eggs ad
vanced today seven cents above yes
terday's low figure. Receipts were
1,000 cases fewer and the price re
gained Saturday's mark, 33 to 35.

ARREST MARSHAL HITCH
AS A DRY LAW VIOLATOR
Paris, 111., Dec. 2. Charges of sell
ing liquor in anti-saloon territory and
maintaining a common nuisance were
made in two informations filed in the
county court yesterday against United
States Marshal Charles P. Hitch of
the southern Illinois district. The
bond In each case was fixed at $500.
Mr. Hitch is a stockholder and acts
in a managerial capacity in an amuse
ment park north of Paris. Last sum
mer the refreshment stand privilege
was ieased to Samuel Hybarger and
Joseph Connery. The former was con
victed on fourteen counts of selling
liquor in anti-saloon territory. The
charges assert Mr. Hitch, as manager
cf the park, accepted a certain percent
of the receipts of the stand and was
equally guilty of the sale.
"I can easily trace these charges to
Representative Frank T. O'Hair and
bis political friends," Mr. Hitch said.
"Their bitter feeling has grown out of
the fact that charges of a sale of the
Paris postmastershlp made by several
of the unsuccessful applicants were
given space in my newspaper as a
matter of news.' Not long ago Mr.
O'Hair preferred charges against me
at Washington, bat I met them square
ly and was exonerated by the demo
cratic Inspector. The real fac's in the
case will be saUsfactorially exnlameH
when the proper time comes.

WILSON SEES
HUERTA FALL
NOTFAR OFF
Dismisses Situation in a
Few Words in First An
nual Message.
STRICTER TRUST LAWS
Document, One of the Briefest,
Is Read by President Before !
Joint Session.
(President Wilson's message Is
printe in ful on page 9 of this Isaue.
Editor Argus.)
Washington, Dec. 2. President Wil
son read his first annual message to
congress today at a Joint session in
the house chamber. It was among the
briefest documents of its kind from
any president and was of about three
thousand words and required less
than half an hour to read It. The pres
ident dismissed the Mexican situation
with brief comment, reiterating the
sentiment of his brief address ot
some time ago that the Huerta gov
ernment was slowly crumbling and
that the United States probably
would not have to alter Its policy ol
waiting.
Desirability of early amendment ol
the Sherman law to prevent "privatt
monopoly more effectually" was point
ed out and promise made of a special
message to congress on the subject.
Other features of the message wer
the endorsement of Alaskan railway
building, concentration by the senate
on the pending currency bill, necessity
of rural credits legislation, self gov.
ernment for Porto Rico and Hawaii
and Independence of the Philippines,
common conference and council be
tween states and the federal govern
ment on conservation questions and
revision of the primary election iys
tem. For details of the government's
business the president referred con
gress to the annual reports of cabi
net officers.
The conclusion of the address wat
a compliment to congress xor naving
labored so unreservedly during the
last seven months on business of leg
islation." The galleries were packed with a
brilliant throng when the . president
began reading his message at 1:08. H
read easily and clearly, and wai
heard plainly all over the chamber,
The president was heartily cheered as
ho rose to begin the message.
During the reading of the message
the president was warmly applauded
several times, especially on references
to the Mexican situation and when he
said the Sherman law should be
strengened. He finished at 1:35. All
through It Secretary Bryan, in the dip.
lomatic gallery, was broadly smiling.
Forcing Currency Bill.
Efforts to get an agreement to vote
in the senate on the currency bill,
Dec. 20, failed today, but the senate
democrats began a campaign they
think will force early action. The
p'an is to "exhaust the senate" and
force an early vote. Senator Bristow
attacked this as unfair. Owen and
S;iaffroth retorted that the republic
cans already had delayed the bill by
prolonging the debate.
