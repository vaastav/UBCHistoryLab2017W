IN PWTY-POURTH CONGRESS
Mr. Reed Makes a Modest Little
Speech of Aoceptance From
the Speaker's Chair -
The Upper Branch.
Washingwt. Dee. :-The beose of
repreesntattves pawed to-day Into the
control of the repubtleans. and Thomas
Brackett Reed of Maine agati trzumwpi
antly assumed the speakers gavel.
The opening seisson was, as usual an
animated and brillant occasion. set
off with crowded galiertee In hoiday
attire, intoaxiated with the perfume of
hundreds of floral triutes to popular
memberu and pervaded with a spirit of
jtrbilatlon and good nature. Old famil
tar faces were absent, but there were
plenty of new ones to take their places.
Still the proceedings themselves, as
usual with opening sessions, were of a
routine dharacter, and devoid of sense
tional features. The house simply or
ganised, adopted the usual resolutions
to notify the president and the senate
that the house was ready for business
and wound up by Indulging In the bi
enalal lottery or seat drawing contest.
Speaker Reed was beyond question the
star of the occasion. His appearance
was the signal for a most flattering
and enthusiastio demonstration. His
Inaugural was modest and full of good
feeling, but non-committal as to poll
eies. However, it was not expected
that the speaker would touch upon
questions to be dealt with by the
house. Ex-Bpeaker Crisp assumed the
)eadership of the minority and it was
s nifloent that Payne of New York
mlade a motion which usually devolves
upon the leader of the majority. fThis
is taken to mean that he is to be
chairman of the ways and means comn
mittee and the recognised leader of the
republicans on the floor.
Spraktr I. i. Reed.
By 10 o'clock the marble corridors of
the hall of representatives were
thronged with sightseers and place
hunters, and before 11 o'clock the gal
leries, public and private, were packed
to the doors. Flowers were conspicu
ous on the desrs of various members.
As the hands of the clock pointed to
12. Clerk Kerr called the Fifty-fourth
house of representatives to order. Rev.
fMr. Bagby of this city, chaplain of the
house, offered the invocation. Under
the direction of 'Mr. Kerr the roll of
members elected to the Fifty-fourth
house was called. Mr. Reed, for whom
everyone was inquiring, had not made
his appearance. Kerr announced that
341 of the 356 members of the house
were present and that credentials had
not been received from the Tenth New
York and First Nevada districts. Kerr
then called for nominations for
seeaker.
-& u rO VV1& epuD1can, unlo, cnair
man of the republican caucus, placed in
nomination Thomas B. Reed of Maine;
Sayres, democrat, Texas, the name of
Charles 8. Crisp of Georgia, and Mr.
Kem. populist, Nebraska, John C. Bell
of Colorado. The result of the vote
was: Reed. 234; Crisp. 95; Bell, 6; Cul
berson. 1.
Crisp. Grosvenor and Bell were ap
pointed a committee to conduct the
speaker to the chair, and soon ap
peared at the main entrance, Reed
leaning on the arm of ex-Speaker
Crisp, and Mesmrs. Bell and Grosvenor
arm in arm. As Reed ascended the
rostrum the roar swelled until it was
deafening. Above this volume of sound
came like pistol shots cries of "Reed.
Reed. Reed." The republicans cheered,
many of them wildly, and the ladies in
the gallery waved their handker
chiefs. Reed stood calmly and serene
ly. with his hands clasped in character
istic tashion behind his back Until the
house was quiet. Harmer, republican.
Pennsylvania. the oldest member in
continuous services present, came for
ward and administered the oath of
office to the speaker. The latter then
turned to the house and delivered his
InauguraL Slowly and distinctly the
words fell from his lips. At many
places his brief speech was punctuated
with applause.
"It will not be unbecoming in me, I
bope. if I acknowledge to this assem
bly that it is very agreeable to me to
stand once more in the place I left four
years ago. Of the past, however, I
shall not speak, for the past speaks for
Itself in terms more fitting and appro
priate than any words which could
come from my lips. Nor shall I speak
of the future. for we are not putting
off harness but putting it on. Yet I
think I venture to say of the future.
in the light of the past, that if we do
something which for the moment
seems inadequate, it may be that time
which has justified itself for us on so
many occasions, may do so again.
Those who have acted with wisdom
heretofore may be fairly expected to
act with wisdom hereafter. I am sorry
to say the pleasure associated with
the honor you have bes:owed on me.
an honor no American citizen can fall
to apOreciate and for which I give
thanks. is but for a moment so, while
the cares and responsibilities extend
over many days. So far as the per
formance of my duties affect the whole
people of the United States I invoke
their considerate Judgment. So far as
it affects the members of the house, I
ask from both sides of the ohamber
that cordial cooperation without which
I cannot hope to succeed, assuring
them r.o efts.-: on my part will be
spared to aid them in the performance
of their duties by that entire imparti
alitv which is their Just due.'
