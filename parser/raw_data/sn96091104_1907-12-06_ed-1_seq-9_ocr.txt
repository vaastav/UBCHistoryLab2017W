PITTSBURG. Pa., Dec 4 Wm. J.
Bryan, en routs to hla home in Lin
coln, N'eb.. arrived hera today from
Washington, meeting hie wife and
daughter .who are bound for New
York, whtnee they will .all for Eu
rope Saturday. Mr. Bryan will not
KccoUipuny them, he said, a he has
lecture engagement, which will keep
hfm engaged for some time.
Mr. Bryan was reluctant to discuss
President Roosevelt' message to Con
gress, saying that he bad not had suf
ficient time to read It through. He.
however, commented freely on several
of the most Important Issues, and gave
President Roosevelt credit for Intro
ducing an original proposition in sug
gesting the appropriation of campaign
funds by the Government. "I hope,"
he said, "that It will be enacted Into a
law."
On Important questions Mr. Bryan's
Ideas coincide with the text of the
message. He I. strictly in accord
with the President concerning postal
savings banks and guaranteed banks.
He said:
"The ulan of the guaranteed bank
Is simply this: Statistics show the
average loss to depositors to be very
small, taking all the banks together,
but the depositors .are afraid because
they do not know much about the af
fairs of any particular bank. The
Postmaster Oeneral, In recommending
the postal savings banks, called atten
tion to the fact that a large sum of
money Is sent back to the Government
banks of Europe by people who are
afraid to trust the private banks here,
and Mr. Wanamaker has ( been quoted
as saying that a large sum is kept in
hoarding. During the last forty years
the average loss among National
banks has been less than 1-10 of 1 per
cent of deposits, and as we have
passed through two panics in that
time. It is not likely that the average
loss will be' greater drulng the next
forty yeara.
"To sum up the situation, the depos
itors need protection, and this must
either be given by the postal savings
banks, which will grow until it ha.
absorbed the deposit banking of trfe
country, or It must be furnished
through the guarantee of existing
banks."

NEW YORK. Dec. 4 That the
country Is already beginning to recov
er from the sever shock received in
Ue recent panic 1. the opinion of E.
H. Harriman, as expressed In aa in
terview published here today.
"We are in the rebound from the
depression, and we are in It to stay,
Mr. Harriman said. "There will be no
falling back; each step that we are
taking is firm. Underneath the whole)
situation there is industrial stability.
There is too much work to be dona
and too great capacity for doing it to
allow a long-drawn-out depression.
There are indications that confidence
is being restored. The country is too
big and the people too sensible to
allow the acts of a few men to shake
their faith In the Integrity of our great
financiers and business men as a
whole. Naturally there was a little
scare at first, but when the people saw
that there were rotten spots only
here and there they quickly recovered
from their fright. The dawn of a new
era of prosperity Is here. The over
strain on cash Is being relieved and
credit is once more being allowed! to
perform its normal work.
