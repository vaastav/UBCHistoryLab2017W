A railroad bridge across Bering strait,

The representatives of organized labor

Attorney (Itneral Knox of having been

employer.
In view of the unanimous rinding of the

An impression prevails that the Eastern
States have the largest number of banks
on the basis of population. Such, however,
is not the case. In New Kngland there
is one bank to every 7,034 inhabitants, while
in the Western States there is a bank to
every l,C,v' inhabitants. Furthermore, Iowa
has more banks on the basis of population
than any other State in the Union.
Mr. Croker consents to draw from his
Inexhaustible store of political wisdom so
far as to say that trusts will be the salva
tion of the Democratic party because "that
party is against trusts and always will be,
while the Republicans are not in earnest
in their opposition to them." Probably Mr.
Croker is the mcst ignorant man that ever
lived who posed as a political oracle.
Several men In New York entered Into

proper punishment for such offenders.
Thus a precedent has been established for
the punishment of men who spread rumors
calculated to embarrass banks and busi
ness firm.
The resignation cf Postmaster General
Emith has been foreshadowed in Cabinet
gossip from time to time and probably has
no special political significance. Mr. Smith
has important newspaper Interests in Phil
adelphia to look after and has rrobably
held office as long- as he cared to. He has
made an excellent record as postmaster
general, and his term of service has been
fully as long as tho average. His suc
vssor, Hon. Henry C. Payne, of Wlscon-
sin, has had large experience in politics
and business. He was chairman of the Re
publican state central committee of Wis
consin, a member of the Republican na
tional committee since lSO, delegate to sev
eral national convention?, postmaster at
Milwajkeo ten years, president of the Mil
waukee Electric Railway Company, presi
dent of a telephone company, receiver of
the Northern Pacific Railroad, etc. Few
men have had a more varied experience in
politics and business than Mr. Payne, and
he has invariably shown rare executive
ability. Mr. Smith has been an able post
master general, and there is every reason
to believe that his successor will prove
equally so.
IMJtSTRIAL 1'KACE.
The opening years of the twentieth cen
tury have been marked by an almost uni
versal discussion of the wonderful strides
this country is making towards commercial
supremacy. "The American rerir has be
come a familiar phrase, not only among
foreign manufacturers, business men and
newspaper writers, but among foreign
statesmen. In past years It was a theory,
but now It Is a condition which. If not fully
realized, la at least on the verge of realiza
tion. The superiority of American methods
of Industrial organization, workmanship,
production, distribution, etc.. Is recognized
abroad even more distinctly than at home,
and yet, strange to say, the one weak point
in the situation is right here at home. It
is the unfriendly relations, one might al
most say the warring conditions, between
capital and labor, between employers and
employes. Thi3 is the only thing that
stands In the way not only of the com
plete establishment of American commer
cial supremacy, but of the beginning of a
new era of national development and prog
ress, not material alone, but moral and so
cial as well, that will place us in the front
rank of nations. What we need Is industrial
peace peace between capital and labor, be
tween employers and employes, between
those who pay wages and those who earn
them. With this kind of peace assured
at home we could defy the commercial
world in arms against us. The real Amer
ican peril Is at homethe peril of war be
tween American capital and labor. If this
continues, the prospect of American com
mercial supremacy will vanish, but if it
can be removed nothing can prevent the
realization of conditions that all the world
is now talking about.
The National Civic Federation deserves
the thanks of the nation for trying to bring
about a solution of this problem through
the conference at New York, and It Is not
too much to say that Senator Hanna has
shown a truer appreciation of the situation
and done more to bring about the confer
ence and pave the way to practical results
than any other person. No public man In
this country has talked more frankly or
more Intelligently concerning a question
of vital importance than Senator Hanna
does concerning this one, or has shown
more genuine solicitude to contribute to its
settlement. "If by resigning my seat in
the United States Senate," says Mr. Hanna,
"I could bring to fruition the plans that we
are now fostering to make strikes, lockouts
and great labor disputes impossible I would
gladly do so." Nobody has a right to
doubt that Senator Hanna means what he
says. He has given many evidences of his
ardent Americanism, but none so striking
or characteristic of his career as a busi
ness man as what he Is trying to ac
complish in bringing about a condition of
industrial peace in the United States. Even
the beginning of such an end would be
an achievement that would undoubtedly
rank among the great ones of the twentieth
century. Fifty years of Industrial peace in
the United States were better than a cycle
of strikes, lockouts and boycotts.
SPECIAL TENSION LEGISLATION.
There are some Indications that the pres
ent session of Congress may be marked by
the Introduction of an unusually large
number of special pension bills. This would
not be surprising, for, at the present re
moteness from the war period, every year
develops cases of supposed merit that do
not come under existing laws. Yet these
laws are so liberal that the really meritori
ous cases not covered by them are com
paratively few and should be closely scru
tinized. As President Harrison said In his
annual message of 1SW, in commenting on
the operation of the disability pension act:
"This liberal enlargement of the general
law should suggest a more careful scrutiny
of bills for special relief, both as to the
cases whe-re relief is granted and as to the
amount allowed." President Cleveland,
during hl3 first term, vetoed more than 230
special pension bills, and the general law
was not as liberal at that time as it was
later and i3 now. In 1ST3 President Grant
vetoed an act to equalize bounties on the
ground that "the passage of the bill at this
time is inconsistent with the measures of
economy now demanded by the necessities
of the country." This veto message was
written In the President's room at the Cap
itol on March 3, 1ST3, but failed to reach the
House of Representatives before the final
adjournment of Congress, and the original
is filed at the executive mansion. The b!ll
died by a pocket veto. It is the enly bill of
a general character for the relief of tx
soldiers that has ever passed Congress and
not been approved by the President.
The liberal pension legislation of recent
years Is In marked contrast to the spirit
that prevailed in some former periods. In
ISIS Congress passed an act granting pen
sions to all surviving soldiers of the revo
lutionary war who had served nine months
or more and were "in Indigent circum
stances." Because the number of appli
cants under this law exceeded expectations
Congress In 1S20 passed a law requiring
proof of absolute indigence. Under this
law the then secretary of war, John C. Cal
houn, began the process of weeding out
revolutionary pensioners. The number of
such pensioners at that time was about
16.000, and their aggregate pensions amount
ed to about tf.0O0.0O0. The rule established
by the secretary of war was that those
who were drawing pensions under the act
of ISIS, as well as new applicants, must sub
mit a sworn schedule of their property, and
under this harsh and humiliating rule all
pensioners and applicants were excluded,
with a very few exceptions, whose sched
ules of property exceeded ?2C0. By this
means the list of pensioners was reduced
about one-half, but it was a cruel rule and
a disgrace to the Congress that passed and
the administration that enforced iL Pres
ident John Quincy Adams made the follow
ing allusion to it in his Inaugural address
In 1S25: "As the numbers of these venerable
relics of an age gone by diminish; as the
decays of body, mind and estate of those
that Burvive roust, In the common course
of nature, Increase, should not a more lib
eral portion of Indulgence be dealt out to
them? May not the want In most Instances
be Inferred from the demand when the
sendee can be proved, and may not the last
days of human Infirmity be spared the mor
tification of purchasing a pittance of relief
only by the exposure of its own necessities?
I submit to Congress the expediency of re
viving the act of the 1st of May. 1S20. with
a view to mitigate the rigor of Its exclu
sions In favor of persons to whom charity
now bestowed can scarcely discharge the
debt of justice." It was several years,
however, before the act was amended or
the policy of the government changed. The
spirit of modern legislation Is far more lib
eral, and, as President Harrison said,
should suggest a careful scrutiny of bills
for special relief.
HOLDING ITS OWN AND MORE.
An exchange, having discovered that the
number of young men studying in Presby
terian schools has fallen to 000 from 1,500
in 1S06, proceeds to find reason for the de
cline, which it bases upon the falling off
in church attendance. The preaching of
the narrow creeds of Calvinism is given
as one of the causes; at the same time the
liberalizing effect of modern preaching has,
it is claimed, done its part toward thin
ning1 congregations. All these assumptions
would be very serious if they had basis in
fact. Because the number of theological
students has fallen off in one or In all de
nominations Is not sufficient ground to
assume that church attendance Is falling
off or that churches are being closed be
cause people will not attend. It Is possible
that young men have discovered that the
ministry does not afford as good prospects
for educated men as other professions.
There are reasons why men who look ahead
may now hesitate to enter the ministry.
The lawyer and the physician who keep
up with their professions are at their best
in many respects between the years of
fifty and seventy, but the preacher who has
reached fifty has not, as a rule, so good an
opportunity to obtain a call as one of
thirty or thirty-five. Why this is so it is not
necessary to undertake to state. This fact
may have Its Influence. The dissensions over
the revision of creeds may deter men from
entering the ministry. Possibly young men
have discovered that there are more preach
ers than pulpits. If men entering or at
tempting to enter other professions could
come to a like conclusion it would be much
better for them, as it is well known that
the professions are crowded.
There are some facts which should coun
teract the gloomy forebodings of those
who see a decline of religious interest in
the falling off in the number of theological
students. The census of 1000, which will
give accurate statistics regarding religious
bodies, is not yet available, but Rev. II.
K. Carroll, D. D., who collected the
statistics for the census of 1S0O, has kept up
his inquiry every year since. Ills sum
wary for 1S00 was 110.9S2 ministers for all
denominations, 150,945 churches, and 20,-
rSlS,307 communicants. The summary issued
by him for 1S90 was 131,717 ministers, 1S8.406
Churches and 26,971,033 communicants. Here
Is a gain in nine years of 40,735 ministers.
28,330 churches and 6,333(C2ö communicants,
or 30 per cent, in communicants In nine
years. During the decade 1S90-1300, the popu
lation of the United States Increased about
20 per cent. If the membership of the
churches has increased 30 per cent. In nine
years or considerably more than 10 per
cent, faster than the population of the
country has increased In ten years, it is
not worth while to waste time in deploring
the decline of tjie churches unless one finds
satisfaction in imaginary evils.
NOW FOIt THE CANAL.
By the ratification of the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty the United States is left with an
absolutely free hand to construct and con
trol a canal across the isthmus of Darien.
The Importance of this consummation can
be best appreciated by remembering that
it is something we have been talking about
and working for for nearly fifty years.
Valuable as such a canal will be to the
commerce of the world, it will be of In
finitely more value to the United States
in bringing the Atlantic and Pacific coasts
of the continent nearer together and in
greatly strengthening our control of the
trade of the Pacific ocean and the Orient.
It will also be of Immense value in time
of war, for, although the United States is
pledged to maintain the neutrality of the
canal and keep it open for the ships of all
nations in time of war, as well as in peace,
It will be of far greater value to this
country than to any other. The American
people have not yet forgotten their anxiety
during the memorable voyage of the bat
tleship Oregon from San Francisco to Key
West, where she reported to the Navy De
partment In time to take part in the bat
tle of Santiago. She left San Francisco
March Ii, 1S9S, and made Key West on
May 21, making a record unexampled in
the history of naval achievement. If there
had been an isthmian canal the Oregon
would have reached the scene of action In
far less time than she did,- though she
would not have had the record as she now
has of being the first United States battle
ship to cross the equator and perhaps her
seamen, whose terms of enlistment ex
pired during her long voyage, would not
have been afforded the opportunity of
patriotically re-enlisting on board ship.
This, however, 13 but an incident. The im
mense importance and value of the canal
to the United States are too plain for argu
ment, and now that the way Is open for
its construction there should be no un
necessary delay In beginning the work. It
i a case in which the people expect Con
gress to do its duty, regardless of factious
opposition or conflicting interests.
The most effective argument in favor of
reciprocity with Cuba is made, by General
Wood, the military Governor of the Island,
in the New York Independent, when he
places it on the basis of enlightened eco
nomic expediency. Cuba, he says, now
supports a population of a million and a
half, but the Island can easily support
twelve millions. Cubans now buy nearly
$70,CjO,000 worth of goods which would be
purchased in this country under an Intel
ligent reciprocal arrangement. As the pop
ulation shall increaso the amount pur
chased will increase. To obtain this trade,
General Wood does not urge free sugar
and tobacco and fruits for Cuba, but re
duced duties.
The proposition to pass a natural gas
meter ordinance seems to contemplate the
admission of a new company. In the light
of experience it is evident that if meter
measurement had been adopted at the be
ginning the supply of natural gas would
hav lasted much longer, and with proper
r
management gas bills would not have been
much If any greater than they were at
ordinance rates. At 10 cents a thousand
feet, meter measurement, natural gas
would be a very cheap fuel. It seems like
a waste of time, however, to talk about a
meter ordinance while there Is one in exis
tence requiring companies to furnish .meters
on request of consumers and fixing the
price at 10 cents a thousand feet.
The two senators who voted against the
ratification of the Hay-Fauncefote treaty
because they fear that the treaty does not
give the United States power to close the
canal against an enemy are ex-Confederates.
Their zeal is commendable, yet it
Is safe to say that an enemy will never
pas3 through an American canal In time
of war.

MANSION TOR THE GOVERNOR.
Experience Shows that Such Provision
Was Very L'nsatlufnctory.
To tho Bdltor of the Indianapolis Journal:
It seems now that the question of a
mansion for the Governor Is likely to be
come an issue fix the election of the next
Legislature, and it Is quite liable to be
come a party question in the absence of
any available national issue, the Demo
cratic party taking whatever side the Re
publicans do not. But, whether an issue at
the polls or not, it cannot fall getting be
fore the Legislature, for, at every session
for the last third of a century, sojne un
happy individual has found himself in a
bigger house than he could afford to keep
up and has sought to unload it on to the
State for a Governor's mansion. There
are two such now seeking the chance, and
It will be an unusual Legislature if there
are not one or more members, serving their
first term and probably their last, who
will be only too glad to champion such a
measure. Meanwhile, it will not be amiss
to inform the young people that we have
tried that scheme twice, and It proved a
stupendous failure each time. More than
three-quarters of a century ago, when the
town was young and the State too, a man
sion for a Governor was built. Not to be
niggardly about it, they devised liberally,
taking the "Monticello" residence of
Thomas Jefferson as the model, and a
two-storied brick, about fifty feet square,
was built In the geographical center of
the entire city, though considerably nortL
of the center of the most fashionable resi
dence district. It stood where the soldiers'
monument now stands, with four fronts,
the exact duplicate of each other, facing
east, west, north and south with absolute
impartiality. It was divided into four large
rooms on each floor by wide halls cross
ing each other at right angles; the floors
were of hard wood (ash), and the inside
finish was strictly up to date, but when
Governor James Rrown Ray arrived with
his domestic outfit, which had been
brought from Brookville in two two-horse
wagons, he peremptorily refused to lose
himself and his belongings in any such an
outlandish structure. "WhyV' said he, "it
has no back yard or backyard conven
iences," and he bought a house better
suited to home life, and every Governor
after him until CJovernor Wallace did the
same thing, for the same reasons, and the
"Monticello" cf Indiana never was occu
pied as a residence, except for a few
months by Rev. John Strange, who occu
pied one of the rooms on the first floor,
and who died there in 1S32. After his death
the whole of the first floor was appropri
ated to state offices, and Judge Blackford
moved his library into the second story
and it became the consulting headquarters
of the supreme judges. No Governor would
ever live in it.
Meanwhile the notion of a mansion for a
Governor was still In tho air. the people
of that period not knowing any better; but
this time it was to buy, not to build. For
awhile it was a close race between a pa
latial residence built and occupied by Dr.
McClure where the Training School now
is. on the triangular point between Madi
son avenue and South Meridian street, and
a little more pretentions house, biter built,
on an acre of ground at the northwest
corner cf Illinois and Market streets, so
up to date in its architecture that Oliver
H. Smith, a few years later, duplicated it
in every detail on the northwest quarter of
the same square, fronting on Ohio street,
which yet remains, but so often remodeled
inside and out to keep up with tho changes
of style that the original can hardly be
recognized. The McClure house had the
advantage of being in the better residence
neighborhood, for there were many more
good homes south of Washington street
than north of it, but the Saunders home
had the merit of being nearer the new
Statehouse, and the fact that Miss Zerelda
Saunders was to soon become Mrs. Gov
ernor Wallace may have had something
to do with the selection, for she became
the first mistress of the mansion. That
house became the residence of every Gov
ernor from Wallace to Morton, and before
venturing upon another experiment in the
mansion business it would be well to study
that history. First it was expensive.
What with repairs and betterments and
changes to keep it in touch with the latest
style of architecture, and the furnishing
and refurnishing at least with every new-
Governor, the bills became so enormous
that the Legislature prevailed upon Gov
ernor Morton to accept 52.0.0 a year In
lieu of all these, and the property was sold
and the State was relieved from a pecuni
ary responsibility that is not measurable
by the interest on the original investment.
But there was another and even greater
objection to the system, though but little
was ever said about it by the successive
Governors except to most intimate friends
The home life of the Governor was almost
wholly suspended during his administra
tion. Tne house belonged to the State.
and some people felt quite as free to drop
in upon the Governor's family as into the
Statehouse, only a half square away, and
there was no help for it. But this was not
the worst feature. It practically compelled
every Governor to live in the same style.
no matter what his personal tastes or pref
erences mlgnt be. lhis was sometimes
quite a hardship. It was particularly so
with Governor nitcomb. who had . no
managing partner, and who. though one
of the most cultured of all our Governors.
had no fondness for domestic life, yet he
was compelled to maintain the dignity and
hospitality or tno mansion during his ad
ministration, at the expense of a personal
discomfort he never talked about except
to a few intimate friends.
It has been quite different since a money
commutation has taken the place of a
mansion. Not only has the State profited
by the present method in a pecuniary way,
but every Governor has be-en free to con
sult his own taste and convenience in a
matter strictly personal. We cannot af
ford to shut ourselves up to the necessity
of electing only such men as are equipped
for the management of a mansion. We
ma3 again choose for Governor a typical
bucolic who will prefer to leave his part
ner on the farm to look rffter the stock
rather than to bring her into a mansion
with all the mansion stands for. Shall we
be estopped from such a right by the ne
cessity a mansion compels? Or suppose
we now had a mansion all furnished and
ready, and the people of the State should
wish to transfer our attorney genornl from
the suite of offices in the north end of the
Capitol to the suite In the south end, and
make him a Governor and they can find
no better material how would he manage
a mansion, having no managing partner?
True, he might get one by the asking, but
evidently he does not want to have to ask.
Would it be kind to put him into such a
strait? So, then, whether we consult the
comfort of the Governor or the interest of
the taxpayer, the conclusion Is that, in the
language of the late Governor Hendricks,
we had better let it be. U. L. SEE.

with all the gas they need to make them
comfortable.
With Frank B. Burke, Mr. Warrum
states, he is acting as the local representa
tive of a firm of Chicago lawyers who are
counsel for the gas company which seeks
entrance to the Indianapolis field. He de
clares that at the present time he is not in
a position to divulyre the identity of the
Chicago gas company or the Chicago at
tcrneys whom he represents. There is no
question, however, Mr. Warrum goes on to
say, but that the company Is sincere in its
desire to enter into competition with the
existing gas companies, and that It Is a
corporation having a high rating In the
business world.
His clients do not wish to give their
names or to announce their course of pro
cedure until they are assured that tho
Council will act favorably on an ordinance
providing that gas shall be burned by
meters. They will not attempt to supply
gas here under the contract sj'stem.
Mr. Warrum says that if Council passes
the meter ordinance and a new gas com
pany Is given entrance here Indidanapolis
people will find that the days of natural
gas are not over by a good deal. He Is con
vinced, he says, that the new company has
plenty of gas and only awaits an opportu
nity to sell it here af reasonable rates.
Furthermore, Mr. Warrum believes that
the entrance here of a new company would
force the Indianapolis Gas Company and
the Consumers' Gas Trust Company to de
liver all the gas they are capable of fur
nishing, something he Is inclined to think
is not being done at the present time.
While it is probable that the gas can never
again be used extensively by factories, the
chances are good, he believes; that it can
be used satisfactorily for heating purposes
for years to come.
The Chicago company, its local represent
atives say, will furnish all the gas In
dianapolis people want at lu cents per
thousand feet; they will agree to furnish
meters without expense to consumers, and
they will also make all connections free of
charge to their customers. Mr. Warrum
states that these are terms which mean in
effect that, while people are paying high
rates for gas they do not get, they would
under the new arrangement pay low rates
for plenty of the fuel.
The ordinance will be introduced Into
Council at the next meetiner. it is stated.
and will be referred to the proper commit
tee for its report. The attorneys have had
no opportunity of ascertaining the views
of all the members of Council, but they are
sanguine as to the success of the measure
Messrs. Burke and arrum said yester
day that the name of the Chicago company
will be given to the public very soon if cir
cumstances indicate that favorable action
will be taken on the meter ordinance.
The news that a meter ordinance had been
prepared and is ready for introduction into
Council created much discussion around
town yesterday. So far as could be judged
rrom expressions dropped here and there,
L 1 I . I I 1 .11 I A .
puoiic opinion is inclined to iavor sucn a
measure. It is believed that the gas ques
tion will never be settled in a satisfactory
manner until Council requires gas to be
burned by meter. Several gentlemen who
were against meters a year ago are talking
now in favor of the new ordinance.
TAXING OF GAS MAINS.
It Is
Said a Councilman Will Pre
pare an Ordinance.
The question of taxing the mains of. the
natural gas companies will be brought up
in Council at some meeting before the year
1002 is far advanced. That assertion was
made to the Journal yesterday by a mem
ber of Council, who, while he was unwilling
to permit the use of his name as authority
for the announcement, consented to discuss
the matter in a general way.
"I have been Informed," ho said, "that
Jaqueliri S. Holliday Is working on the de
tails of a plan to be submitted to Council
by which the gas companies will be re
quired to pay a considerable amount year
ly into the city treasury. Mr. Holliday has
not asked my opinion of the plan, but two
members of Council have approached me
and have asked how I stand. The inten
tion, I believe, is to secure enough prom
ises of support to insure the success of
an ordinance if Introduced. The ordinance,
1 understand, will provide that the mains
of each company shall be taxed 3 cents
per foot. It is estimated that the aggre
gate returns from such taxation would
net the city about $30,w0 annually."
Councilman Holliday was approached on
the subject last night, and while admitting
that he U considering legislation of the
kind descrioed, refused to talk about the
plan at length. "I have nothing to say
about an ordinance for the purpose of
taxing gas mains at the present time,"
he said, "but I may have some information
for the newspapers at a later date." Mr.
Holliday said also he believes it the best
plan to secure expressions on the idea
from members of Council before making
public the details of an ordinance of the
kind referred to.
The advisability of taxing mains fur
nished a prolific subject for discussion in
the old Council. Two ordinances were in
troduced in it, one fixing the tax on the
mains at 2 cents per foot; the other mak
ing the tax 3 cents. Both were killed. At
the time the gas companies claimed the.y
were in no position to meet the provisions
of such an ordinance, since their receipts
had fallen off appreciably.
The condition of the Washington-street
bridge has Impressed a number of coun
cilmen with the necessity of furnishing the
city plenty of ready money to make much
needed improvements, and it is possible
that the ordinance would meet with more
approval in the present Council than in
former ones. Councilmen, however, are
extremely noncommittal on the subject.
OPINIONS OF ENGINEERS.
They Say the Washington-Street
Bridge In Comparatively Safe.
Councilman Andrew Wahl advances a
new suggestion In regard to the Washington-street
bridge ovr White river. He be
lieves that the bridge, in its present condi
tion. Is worthless as a conductor of traf
fic on Washington street, but he thinks it
. . . A 1 Q 1 V tO

Is an annoying absence of means to get 10
the west bank of White river. There is
no place in the city where a new bridge
is needed more than at ,ew Jwk street.
1 think the old iron bridge w hich Ms now

Mr. Nelson tore up part of the
Mooring of the structure and examined tne
iron work thoroughly. He has arrived at
the conclusion that the bridge is as
now as It was Deioro me un-aiv i..
He stated that the broken rods have been
repaired, and thaLho does not consider the
bridere any more dangerous to public gaiety
at the present time tnan 11 nas uecu i
years. He does not think that there is
ground for alarm on the part 01 peupio
who constantly traverse the structure.
Mr. Nelson states that the bridge can be
put in fairly gocd shape by the expenditure
of a small sum or money, ana me piuu.
hmHas nr that the Board of Works will
act on whatever suggestion Mr. Nelson may
make along that line.
Engineer Jones, of the street-car com
pany, says that he is absolutely familiar
with the exact condition of the bridge, and
that there is no danger to the public in
using it. With the repairs which the com
pany has made on it, he says, it is in pafe
condition. The company would not take
the risk of carrying passengers across ft if
there existed any danger of an accident.
Street cars, he said, are not as weakening
to the structure as heavily loaded wagons,
since by the cars the weight is distributed
along an iron rail, and, in addition, the
load is carried over smoothly and evenly.
Passengers in street cars evidently think
the bridge is safe enough, for very few
take advantage of the invitations Issued by
conductors to get out and walk across.
LIGHT AND POWER.
Prominent Wholesale Merchants In
terested In a New Company.
The Merchants Power Company, which
Is said to be composed of a number of
prominent wholesale dealers, wants a fran
chise from the Board of Works. In a per
tition presented to the board yesterday
appeared the names of A. Kiefer & Co.,
Hibben, Hollweg & Co., M. O'Conner & Co.,
Hollweg & Reese and others. It is under
stood that the company Is not formed to
fight the Indianapolis Light and Power
Company, but simply as a means of insur
ing low rates of heat and lighting to its
stockholders. The merchants interested ex
pect, it is said, to establish a light and
power station of their own.
Object to Expert's Ordinance.
Councilman Eppert's ordinance annexing
a good-sized district between Thirty-eighth
street and Fall creek, including within its
limits Newby Oval and the Driving Park,
has aroused opposition from G. Q. Bruce,
whose mother owns the site of the Oval
and the Driving Park. Mr. Bruce objects
to having his mother's property taken into
the city on the ground that she cannot af
ford to hold the ground as it Is and pay
city taxes. The members of the Driving
Club, it is said, are inclined to take sides
with tho Bruces.
Councilman Eppert stated last night that
be would not have the ordinance with
drawn, and he thought the objections to it
would not be strong enough to affect the
action of Council.
Horse Stuck: In Soft Mml.
II. Babe, of East Lincoln street, met yes
terday with an unpleasant experience simi
lar to J. H. Darmody's the other day.
While driving over a recently constructed
sewer in an alley near Laurel street and
Woodlawn avenue, Itabe's horse broke
through and was imbedded in soft mud.
He charges that the sewer contractor dis
played no lights. The Board of Works will
make his complaint the ground for Investi
gating alleged carelessness of contractors.
Condition of City Water.
Dr. Eugene Buehler, city sanitarian, is
trying to find out what chemical element
gives the water in the city mains such a
peculiar taste. Some persons have com
plained that to drink a glass of water is
like taking a glass of medicine, and others
have said that the water is muddy and dis
colored. The water company thinks the
taste and color are caused by Iron oxide
from the pipes, and the city sanitarian
thinks that is probably the case.
A PENALTY OF $80 A DAY
BROAD RIPPLE IS ASSESSING FINES
AGAINST THE MONON.
It Is Claimed that the Hand Refuses
to Place Light at the
Town Crossing;.
The Monon Railway Company Ij sup
posed to be paying the town of Broad
Ripple the sum of $bQ a day in the way of
fines for failure to comply with an or
dinance enacted by tho Town Board. The
ordinance was passed under a legislative
act giving towns authority to require rail
way companies to place lights at town
crossings. There are four of these cross
ings at Broad Ripple and the railway com
pany is being fined 520 a day for each light.
The ordinance was passed several weeks
ago. The railway company has failed to
pay the fines, it Is announced, and suit
will probably be brought.
FRANKLIN COLLEGE.
Directors Meet Here to Consider Sev
eral Matters of Importance.
The directors of Franklin College had
lunch at the Commercial Club yesterday
and In the afternoon held a business meet
ing at the office of Dr. G. V. Woollen on
West Ohio street. The chief matter up
for discussion was the endowment of the
Greek chair. Some time ago A. J. Thurs
ton, of Shelbyville, president of the board
of directors, offered to give $1,000 toward
this endowment if the sum of could
be raised. A considerable part of this sum
has already been pledged and it was de
cided yesterday to make an active canvass
among the friends of the college for the
remainder.
The Baptist churches, with which denomi
nation the college Is identified, will be asked
to take an interest In the fund. The direc
tors want to get this matter out of the
way so that the Shirk library movement
may be taken up more actively. This move
ment was started by Moses Shirk, of Peru.
The plan is to build a fireproof library
where the 20.WQ volumes now owned by
the college may be more safely kept. The
directors want to erect the library build
ing next year if possible. It is announced
that the increase in attendance at the col
lege has been about fifty in the last year.

TIHE FOR PROTESTS EXTENDED
SAMPSON'S COUNSEL WILL EXCEPT
TO DEWEY'S OPINION.
McComns, of 31nrland, Will Intro,
dure n Resolution In the Semite
To-Day Principal Resolutions.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 17. The chief d.
velopments In the Schley situation to-y
were the flood of resolutions and tills in
troduced In the Houfo, the announe. ir.-r.t
that Secretary Long had extended tU r.rr.e
for the filing of the protest of Schy'
attorneys against the majority findi:-.- cf
the court of inquiry, his permission to
counsel for Admiral Sampson to file a pro
test against the substance and form cf the
minority opinion, and the announcement
that Senator McComas, of Maryland, to
morrow will reinforce the agitation by pre
senting a resolution In the Sen..te similar
to those introduced In the House to-dar.
The various House resolutions provi k f or
a sword for Admiral Schley, for SchUy
medals for his officers and men, for hi
restoration to the active list, for the full
pay and allowance of his rank in active
service from the date of his retirerr.t,
for an investigation of the majority mem-
bera of the court, for an Investigation cf
the Navy Department and for the in
vestigation of the prize money awards.
Isador Raynor and Mr. Teague, counsel
and assistant counsel, respectively, for Ad
miral Schley during the court of inquiry,
went to Baltimore and are busily cngagtd
In that city to-day with the preparation
of the statement of objections to the court's
findings, which Admiral Schley has btea
granted permission to file with the review
ing authority. Secretary Long.
So far as completed, the results of the
work may be summarized as follows: First
of all, protestants aver that the findings of
the court should be set aside on the broad
ground that they are not in accordance
with the evidence; and, following this, each
point in the report, tuch as the charges of
dilatoriness, disobedience or orders, the
sending of misleading dispatches, the con
troversy with Lieutenant Hodgson, the
famous loop, etc., will bo touched upon in
turn and the salient features of the evi
dence disproving these charges iointed out.
Practically the protest will be a review
of the evidence in the case, submitted in
such a way that Secretary Long will have
the opportunity to pass upon the whole
controversy.
Senator McComas, of Maryland, ca'.lrd
at the Navy Department to-day and had
a long talk with Secretary Eng before the
latter went to the Cabinet meeting. It is
understood that the senator wished to s-e-
cure an extension by several d.ys of the
time allowed by Secretary Long for the
submission of the protest, if it appears
that the admiral's counsel cannot properly
prepare their document in time.
Secretary Long this afternoon informed
Senator McComas that he would grant
Admiral Schley's attorneys an extension f
twenty-four hours of the time origin tily
allowed them lor the submission of tlmr
statement. This will make the time ex
pire Thursday at 4 o'clock.
Stayton and Moore, who appeared befoie
the court of Inquiry as attorneys for Ad
miral Sampson, have applied to Secretary
Long for permission to be heard in prjUst
against the approval by the secretary ct
the minority report written by Admiral
