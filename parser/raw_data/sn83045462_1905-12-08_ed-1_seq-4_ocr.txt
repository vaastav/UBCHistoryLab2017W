A Fight for the Child.
Washington welcomes today delegates
from all parts of the country to a national
child-labor conference, which Is to last
three days. The purpose of the men and
women engage.) In this important cam
paign Is to ameliorate the condition of the
little workers in nil the trades and occupa
tions. and eventually to secure their release
from wage-earning during the years when
they should be acquiring an education. This
Is a noble effort, and deserving of the warm
est support of all good citizens who look
ahead to the welfare of the next genera
tion.
The working of children In mills, facto
ries. stores and other places is bad on sev
eral accounts. It is had for their health, to
begin with. They are continent closely, often
In the most debilitating atmosphere, some
times engaged in positively harmful occur
pations, at the age when they need exer
cise nnd fresh air .and freedom from re
straint. They are likely to be stunted
In their growth, their systems weakened.
They are robbed of their most prenlous heri
tage. that of a sound constitution. Great
advances have already been made along
the line of improving the conditions under
which children are employed, through the
efforts of the organizations In the states and
cities whose representatives are here In ses
sion. When prohibitive laws are not yet
possible, owing to the opposition of large
Interests, the ameliorative work Is of vital
consequence.
The children suffer morally when they are
t*ken out of their natural line of life and
set to work at tender years. They are often
herded in with adults of low character,
whose language and conduct arc demoral
izing influences upon the young minds.
Many a character has been permanently
wrecked by the evil associations formed in
the early days of child labor. Smoking,
drinking i<nd other vices are readily ac
quired In such circumstances. This Is an
Inherent evil. It is difficult to lessen it. The
remedy fur It lies in prohibition, to remove
the chlid h! solutely from these contami
nating conditions and give it a chance for a
wholesome career.
Tho little wag. -corners suffer mentally
when they are deprived of their schooling.
They are thus handloipped trebly, their
health menaced, their morals polluted, their
minds stunted. They pay dearly in after
years for the few dollars they earn as chil
dren. They enter manhood and womanhood
permanently handicapped for the race. The
preferments go to the brighter, better-edu
cated young men and women. The boy or
girl who Is kept at school until after six
teen at the earlies- and given a good Kng
llsh education is fitted to jump into any
business or trade and make headway much
faster than tho dull-witted, feeblo-bodled.
weak-charactcred ore who has started out
In the money-making effort at the age of
ten, or even younger.
These are facts. They admit of no dis
pute. The\ cannot be set aside by consid
erations of expediency or a wrong concep
tion of charity. To lessen the .'ight for let
ter child-labor laws because of the fear
that the poverty ifroblem may become more
acute Is to temporize with both evils?that
of child labor and that of poverty. Much of
the present penury of the lower classes is
due to the lack of education, and that in
turn may lie traced squarely to the employ
ment of little folks at the years when they
should have teen learning.
It is to be hoped that much good will
flow from this Washington conference, per
haps in the enactment of a model child
labor law for the District, and surely In the
stimulation of interest In this important
propaganda.
A Bossless Age? Or Spasm?
Are we in this country entering upon
what the political historian will describe as
the bossless age? Are we going to hold
fa^t to what fortune has recently given us
?the spirit to conduct our public affairs
without the agenc les of corrupt men at the
top. whose sole aim is to line their own
Jackets with money filched from the peo
ple? Or are we -imply having a spasm of
lidignation a:.d virtue, to be followed by a
relapse Into the old conditions of indiffer
ence and sloth, when the bosses, who never
rleep and are ::ot easily discouraged, will
shoulder forward again and resume charge
In the old way and for the old purposes?
However this may be, Mitre is no doubt
of the spirit now abroad. It is anti-boss
on every hand, and with an emphasis that
l?aves nothing to be desired. No man In
office, or seeking offifalls to deliver him
self on the subject la good, round terms.
Every fellow considers that ho advances
hlmse'.f In the pub I estimation by announc
ing that ho wears no man's collar, and
could not be Induced to put one on. It Is
the day of Independence and self-rcspect,
and th?re Is wide approval of the manifes
tation of thoee qualities.
As bosslsm reached Its greatest luxuriance
in New York, the repudiation of it is the
most emphatic and pronounced there. Both
sides are voicing the new day and their
purposes with regurd to it. Men put for
ward by Murphy and McCarren on the city
ticket in the recent contest, and elected, or
counted In. as the case may be, are now
openly proclaiming a disposition to be their
own men In office. They pledge all to the
state, and nothing to the floss. "Charley"
sod "Pat," for the first time In their lives,
are finding themselves out of the calcula
tions of those they have raised to power.
On the republican side we hear deliver
ances of like tenor, and apparently of as
great earnestness. Mr. Parsons, who is to
be chairman of the New York county com
mittee. objects to being considered either a
Piatt or tin Odell man, and declares that he
will know only tho organization's Interests,
without regard to persons or factions. Can
didates for the speakership of the state as
sembly are announcing themselves in a
new ar.d healthy tone, and asking to be
considered on their personal character and
standing.
The general condition of affairs Is whole
Pome and Inspiring. But will it last?
The Insurance investigation continues to
make people famous against their wills.
Developing Foreign Trade.
Senator Overman of North Carolina is of
those who think that we need more mar
kets. and that we shall not find them un
1V> we seek them and Inform ourselves as
to the general foreign trade. For th!? pur
pose he proposes the appointment of a
commission of five members, with author
ity to employ experts, whose duty It shall
be to investigate the whole question of the
world's commerce, with the view of ascer
taining how much more of it than we now
Wjojt could be ours by the making of a
MONDtrated and Intelligent effort. He
would have the commission alt three years,
and would limit the expense of their labors
to half a million dollars.
In some observations on the subject Mr.
Overman says:
"It Is generally recognized that there Is a
strong need of such a commission because
of the poor showing made by our manu
factured exports of raw material. The cot
ton products of the south are increasing
every year. The south exports more than
7,000,000 bales of raw cotton, which are
manufactured Into cotton goods In England
and sent btck to South America, where
J52,000,000 worth were sold to Argentine
alone last year. Why should we not get
that trade instead of England? This com
mission is intended to help find that mar
ket."
This one Item, bearing upon this very im
portant subject, is vastly suggestive. As
the North Carolina senator inquires, why
should we not sell to Argentine this annual
bill of goods instead of selling the raw ma
terial to England, to be put Into fabrics
there for our South American neighbor?
And there are other items. There are a
hundred others, showing how important it
Is that we bestir ourselves If we may
hope to take the place to which we are
entitled In thl3 era of the world's strenu
ousness and rapid progress. The spindles
that now pre turning, both in the south
and In New England, are turning to profit,
and if our alertness can be made to keep
pace with our opportunities we should at
no very distant day be manufacturing near
ly all, If not the whole, of the growth of
our cotton fields.
The best advances we can possibly make
to our neighbors to the south are those of
trade relations. That Is the solution of any
difficulty that may now exist between them
and us. The Monroe doctrine probably does
not give them the uneasiness which. In the
gossip of the press, is now and then de
scribed. They are well advised as to our
position on that point, but are not so well
advised as to our ability to fit them out
with the finished products they need from
abroad.
Enforcing Bad Laws.
One of Mr. Roosevelt's firmest convic
tions, to judge from his past performances,
especially as police commissioner of New
York, is that all laws should be enforced
until repealed, and that a law that has-been
allowed to die through neglect is a menace
to tiie public good. While he served at
the head of the metropolitan police depart
ment he resurrected several such statutes,
breathed life into them and put them Into
effect, to the consternation of portions of
the community. He was often quoted as
saying that there was but one safe way to
repeal a law, and that was by legislative
enactment.
Were it not for the frequent news para
graphs in the local papers relative to cer
tain court proceedings it might be suspected
that the President thinks that the District
smoke law is moribund and in need of en
forcement. perhaps to the end of securing
its amendment. His recommendations for
much more severe penalties, if adopted by
Congress, would certainly galvanize the
statute into a mo3t amazing life, but Its
active application would cause the death of
all local business.
The present law is far from dead. It i3
not even dying. It 13 in good health, indeed,
so far as Its application Is concerned. That
able sanitarian, the health officer, has saved
it from an ignominious end by interpreting
it arbitrarily. If it stood in attempted prac
tice. as its letter Indicates, forbidding tlie
slightest emission of dense black or gray
smoke, with any sort of inspection corps
to put It Into cffect, It would, with the
penalties running as at present, render the
conduct of business in Washington virtually
impossible. And with the one-minute grace
granted by the health officer, it is a bur
densome. Inequitable, unevenly applied, im
practical statute.
The adoption of the President's recom
mendations, without amendment, would
cause such a serious state of affairs at the
capital that the radical amendment of the
law would be Imperatively demanded In the
interest of the public welfare. Of the two
evils, continued partial and Inequitable en
forcement of the law as it is now construed
by the health officer, and the application of
the harsh penalties suggested by the Presi
dent on either a one-minute or a no-emis
sion basis, the latter would be really prefer
able. For then relief would surely come,
probably In the form of a sensible adjust
ment of the prohibition to the requirements
of business, coupled with such penalties as
might be deemed wise to give the statute
full and just bearing upon all offenders.
There is. Indeed, no objection on the part
of the progressive, conscientious citizens of
Washington to the adoption of the Presi
dent's proposed penalties for smoke-emis
sion, provided the law is so framed that it
becomes possible to obey it.
There is no doubt that some of Un-cle
Sam's representatives in the neighborhood
of the equator feel that the pay-roll should
be so revised as to permit a greater allow
ance for Ice water and malaria medicine.
When Senator Tillman finds things to ap
prove In the President's message there does
not seem to be much use In anybody's con
tinuing to hold out. Might as well make
the popularity vote unanimous.
It will be no great hardship to some of
the corporations to be prohibited from con
tributing to campaign funds. They were
not very enthusiastic In the first place.
Popular Interest In the bicycle has disap
peared, but New York can still get crowds
to witness Its use as a test of the utmost
possibilities of human endurance.
A legislative fight over the Panama canal
was long ago regarded as down on the list
of things inevitable. It may as well come
early.
The Russian citizen's method of attacking
graft Is as ineffectual as it is crude and
sanguinary.
A number of the bills now being intro
duced in Congress are good old friends.
David B. Hill's Valedictory.
David B. Hill Is quoted as follows:
"I am out of all active participation la
politics, and shall never again get within
the magic circle erf political Influence. I
shall never attend another convention?dis
trict, state or national. If I can aid my
party by making a speech or two In a cam
paign I may do so, but I shall never again
do more than this."
In some comment on the deliverance ap
pears this paragraph:
"This declaration from Mr. Hill Is gen
erally regarded as being sincere, but there
are thoee who believe that when the dele
gates gather at the next state convention,
whether It Is held In Albany or some other
city, they will Instinctively turn to the
'Sage of Wolfert's Roost' for counsel, and
that no Important nomination will be made
without consulting him."
It Is difficult to associate Mr. Hill with
the role of leader emeritus of his party at
home. He Is a veteran only in point of
length of service, and still retains the force
and fire and shrewdness which character
ized his fighting days. He was born with
the scrapping Instinct, has developed and
indulged It all his manhood years, and ?
at sixty-flve, with vigor unimpaired and
some natural scores to settle, he does not
belong on the shelf. Rather la his proper
place still on the firing line, directing the
forces and keeping the other side on the
jump.
It Is true, however, that this man, who
has done so much to warn his party against
trouble and fought so bard In tbe effort to
rescue it after It had got Into trouble, has
had but a meager reward for all his pains.
National leadership has been denied him,
and even his local leadership *u often dis
puted while It laated. Traduoed hy the
Cleveland peopla and harried hjr tha Croker
people, he waa kept between hawk and
buszard for years, until at la?t hla patlenoe
gave out and he retired In undisguised dis
gust. Still, with some years of *0od fl*ht
In him, he Is not going to enjoy the future
he mapped out for himself. When the
bugle sounds and the hosts march past,
the old war horse will And It difficult to
stay inside the fence.
Mr. Hill, unlike his great preceptor, has
trained no youngstera for the public service.
Mr. TUden kept a aort of school, and Mr.
Hill was his brightest, as he waa his favorite
pupil. Lamont, and a great many others,
who afterwards figured In New York poli
tics, learned their first, and many of their
mo?t important, lessons at the feet of the
sage of Orammercy Park. But with Mr.
Hill the old school disappears, and the New
York democracy passes Into new hands,
whose methods have yet to be proved In the
fires of experience.
Now that motor cars are to be placed un*
der the supervision of the Interstate com
merce commission the man who wants to
be safe may have to take along a lawyer
as well as a chauffeur.
It seems odd to suggest a salary of J3.000
a year for the superintendent of a national
bureau of life Insurance when $100,000 Is an
ordinary salary for an office In one of the
companies.
It Is most unfortunate that the careers
of some Russian officials should seem to
sanction assassination or any brute violence
as a means of vengeance.
It Is not quite clear whether the discon
tinuance of passes by railways la to be re
garded as a threat to legislators or a prom
ise to the general public.
The army cooking school seeme to indorse
the wisdom of the epicures who declare
that biscuit may be more deadly than
bullets.
SHOOTING STABS.
Mild Sarcasm.
"I suppose you have some original Ideas
that you would like to offer In Congress?"
"No." answered the new member, "I have
been observing closely and I perceive that
the man who seeks to be original In this
august assemblage immediately stamps him
self a novice."
Of Equal Importance.
"Which do you think we had' better
make," said one Russian official, "threats or
promises?"
"Whichever you choose." answered the
other. "The people are paying just as much
attention to one as to the other."
A Serious Disagreement.
Oh, dove of peace, your wings uplift.
And show us by your kind devices
A reconciliation swift
'Twlxt Christmas pocketbooks and prices.
"Once in a while," said Uncle Eben,
"you'll hear a man sayin' he regrets his
past, when de fact is dat he's afraid of his
future."
Endurance.
"Are you capable of enduring toll, self
sacrifice and personal discomfort in your
determination to accomplish something you
have set out to do?" inquired the man who
gives advicc.
"Yes," answered the youth. "I can con
scientiously say I am. I once colored a
meerschaum pipe."
The Dawn of Gentleness.
When foot bail is at last reformed
By national decree.
Let us not rest, tout still toil on
Toward things that ought to be.
I.et's regulate the bargain throngs
That madly surge and press
And lure the temper feminine
To anger and distress.
I.et's regulate the crowds that climb
On the suburban car
And push their elbows in your eyes
And leave full many a scar
With their umbrellas used for spears
As the redoubt Is stormed.
There may be hope for e'en these things
If foot ball Is reformed.
Farmers Becoming Business Men.
rrom the LouisrUle Courier-Journal.
Viewed from all sides, farming is a great
business. And It Is as a real, live, sub
stantial and serious business that the
farmers should regard and conduct their
affairs. Fortunately, system Is rapidly rev
olutionizing the business. In the golden
northwest the successful farmers are man
aging their estates like great manufactur
ing plants. There are no leak*, no slipshod
methods. They are piling up magnificent
crops and are making fortunes. Down ou?
way, through Kentucky and the south, too,
the farmers are beginning to look upon
their occupation as a sure-enough business
and not as a speculative pastime.
Oyama and Togo.
From the New York Tribune.
Home from his wars, the veteran Marshal
Oyama Is fittingly received with all the pub
lic honors grateful Japan can bestow.
These are comparable only with those given
a little time ago to Admiral Togo, the voice
of the Island empire saying to the latter:
"Mighty Seaman, this Is he
Was great by laud as thou by sea."
Higher praise could not be given to either,
and, unlike their illustrious prototypes, they
both receive It in their lives, and not "to
the roll of muffled drums."
Dregs of Misrule.
Fro!ii the Philadelphia Ledger.
The horrible state of the Schuylkill water,
since the autumn rains washed down new
clouds of culm into the dirty stream, ex
cites renewed Impatience and may well ex
cite renewed Indignation at the dishonest
maladministration that haj# kept a supply
of filtered water still an unrealized dream.
Cigarettes and Beer.
From the New York 11*11.
A Wilkesbarre judge has decided that
cigarettes are worse than beer. Some cigar
ettes than some beer, your honor. Objec

Cannon.
From the Springfield Kepubllcin.
"Economy" is said to be the watchword
of the coming Congress. But who will
watch the watchword and keep It ltj sight?
The Serpent in Eden Again.
From the IMttiburg Gaiette.
Mark Twain has recently revived both
Adam and Eve for literary purposes, but
has not yet threatened to raise Cain.
Those Good Old Days.
From the Princeton Clarion-News.
With a bumper corn crop safe, and prices
of farm products ruling strong, there Is no
longer any need to revert to the "good old
times." The average farmer considers the
present times good enough for him. The
man with a bad liver. Is, of course, not
average.
