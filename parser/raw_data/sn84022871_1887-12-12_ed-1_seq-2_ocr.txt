The republican state committee
bold a fully attended meeting at Bur
lington and decided to bold the state
convention for the election of dele
gates to the republican national con
vention at liurlingtOD on the first
Wednesday in April. This conven
tion will elect four delegates and four
alternates. The time and place for
holding the two district conventions
for electing the four additional dele
gates to which the state is entitled,
have not yet been determined by the
committees of the 1st and 2d con
gressional districts. The state com
mittee decided to meet on the first
Wednesday in April to fix a time aud
P'lace for holding a convention for
the nomination of a governoj, lieutenant-governor,
treasurer, secretary
of state and state auditor. This con
vention will probably be held sn
after the meeting of the national con
vention. Both of the state conven
tions will consist of about C30 dele
gates, the basis of representation in
each being the republican vote for
governor at the last election.
Congress assembled on 3Ionday.
Both houses were promptly organized
for business, without contest in eith
er. In the house, Carlisle, demo
crat, was chosen speaker, having 163
votes, to 148 for Reed of Maine,
republican, 2 for Brum of Pa., cast
by independents. The democratic
candidates for officers of the house
were also chosen, and after drawing
of,seats adjourned.
The senate continued under its
former organization, with senator
iDgalls of Kansas, republican, as
president. The new senators took
the oath of office. Two persons
claim to be senators from West Vir
2inia, and when Mr. Faulkner's cred
entials were presented senator Hoar
objected, and they were referred to
the committee on election without
opioition. In this case one claimant-
Lucas, holds an appointment
from the governor, and Faulkner
was elected at a special sebfiwn of
the legislature, after Lucas had been
AytK.inted. The question hi there

are Jemocrats. Some question a

The President's Message
Tlie president, in his annual mess
age to congress, has digressed from
the usual custom, leaving all the de
tails and the matters of interest which
relate to the departments of state,
commerce, the Indians,the Mormons,
and other topics usually disc-anted
upon, and touched upon only one
subject, viz., the revenues of the
country, of course referring to tariff
and free trade. After speaking of
the fact that the revenues exceed the
necessary expenditures, and calling
attention to the evils which naturally
grow out of a plethora in the
treasurv, he continues :
"On the 30th day of June,18G,the
excess of revenues over public ex
penditures, after complying with the
annual requirement of the sinking
fund act, was 17,820,73-3.34; dur
ing the year ended June 30, 1886,
such excess amounted to 849,405,
645.20 ; and during the year ended
June 30, 1887, it reached the sum of
855,507,849.54. The annual contri
butions to the sinking fund during
the three years above specified,
amounting in the aggregate to S 138,
358,320.04, and deductions from the
surplus as stated, were made by call
in? in for that purpose outstanding
3 per cent bonds of the government.
During the six months prior to June
30th, 1887, the surplus revenue had
grown so large that the sum of 879,
s64,10O of such surplus was applied
to the payment of the principal and
interest of the three per cent bonds
still outstanding and which were then
pavable at the option of the govern
ment. The precarious condition of
financial affairs among the people
still needing relief the sum of 818,
877,500, were called in, to be applied
to the sinking fund contribution for
the current fiscal year afterwards.
Notwithstanding these operations of
the treasury department, representa
tions of distress in business circles
not only continued but increased and
absolute peril seemed at hand. In
these circumstances the contribution
to the sinking fund for the current fis
cal year was at once completed by
the expenditure of 827,684,283.55 in
the purchase of government bonds
not yet due bearing four and four-and-a-half
per cent interest, the premium
thereon averaging about 24 per cent
for the former and eight pei cent for
the latter.
"While the expedients thus employ
ed to release to the people the money
lving idle in the treasury served to
avert immediate danger, our surplus
revenues have continued to accumu
late, the excess of the present year
amounting on the first dav of Decem
ber to 855,258,701.19, and estimated
to reach the sum of 8113,000,000 on
the 30th day of June next, at which
date it ts expected that this sum add
ed to prior accumulations will swell
the surplus in the treasury to 8140.
000,000.
There seems to be no assurance
that, with such a withdrawal from
use of the people's circulating medi
um, our business community may not
in the near future be subjected to the
same distress which was quite lately
produced from the same cause, and
while the functions of our national
treasury should be few and simple, and
while its condition would be reached,
it is believed bv its entire disconnec
tion with private business interest,
yet, when by a perversion of its pur
poses it idly holds money uselessly
subtracted from the channels of
trade, there seems to be reason for
the claim that some legitimate means
should be devised by the government
to restore in an emergency, without
waste or extravagance, such money
to its place among the people, if such
an emergency arises there now exists
no clear and undoubted executive
power of relief. Heretofore the re
demption of 3 per cent bonds, which
were payable at the option of the
government, has afforded a means for
the disbursement of the excess of
revenues, but these bonds have al
been retired, and there are no bonds
outstanding the payment of which we
have the right to insist upon."
The message proceeds to show that
it will be impossible at present to
purchase any more bonds, thereby re
leasing any portion of the surplus
and he sees no wav to avert what mav
seem a threatening danger, excep
by reducing the revenues. After
suggesting that it would be unwise
and dangerous to make extravagant
appropriations to use up the surplus
the president reminds congress that
only in them is vested the power to
remove the so-called difficulties by
appropriate legislature, speaking of
the tariff and the internal revenue
system, he says :
'Our schemes of taxation, by means
of which this surplus is taken from
the people and put into the public
treasury, consists of a tariff or dutv
levied upon importations from abroad
and internal revenue taxes levied ur.
on the consumption of tobacco and
spirituous and malt liquors. It mus
be conceded that none of the thing
subjected to internal revenue taxation
are, strictly speaking, necessaries
There appears to be no just complaint
of this taxation by the consumers of
these articles, and there seems to be
nothing so well able to bear the bur
den without hardship to any portion
of the people. But our present tar-
ig laws, the vicious, inequitable and
illogical scarce of unnecessary taxa
tion, ought to be at once revised and
amended. These laws, as their pri
mary and plain effect, raise the price
to consumers of all articles import!
and subject to duty by precisely the
bum paid for such duties,"
While home manufactured goods
are sold at prices equal to those of
foreign make, owing to the fact that
the foreign is debarred from eompet -
ing with the domestic manufactured
goods.
"This reference to the operation of
; our tariff laws is not mad- br av r,f
- , . " "
Uibtructiou, but in order tLat we may
be
ponstaijtlv reminded of the man-
j utr in Lich thev iuiixwe a burden
upon those who consume domestic
products as well as those who con
sume imported articles, and thus cre
ate a tax upon all our people. It is
not proposed to entirely relieve the
country of this taxation. It must oe
extensively continued as the source
of the government s income, aud in a
re-adjustment of our tariff the inter
ests of American labor engaged in
manufacture should be carefully con
sidered, as well as the preservation
of our manufacturers. It may be
called protection or by any other
name, but relief from the hardships
aud dangers of our present tariff
laws should be devised with especial
precaution against imperilling the ex-
stence of our manufacturing inter
ests. But this existence snould not
mean a condition which, without re
gard to the public welfare or a na
tional exigency, must insure the real
ization of immense profits instead of
moderately profitable returns."
These remarks are followed by a
ongf ree trade argument, in which sta
tistics are used,which attempt to show
that while a few are benefitted by
manufacturing interests, the masses
are surrering ironi import taxes on
manufactured goods.
A long paragraph is devoted to
talk, which means that tariff on
wool and woolen goods should be
reduced regardless of the wool and
sheep interest of the county. A
point against manufacturers is made
by referring to the fact that they
sometimes combine to force down
or to enhance the price of certain
articles by way of monopoly ; the
argument is that if the tariff were so
cut as to let the world in with its
goods, such a state of affairs cannot
exist. The president has the follow
ing suggestions in regard to lifting
off some of the revenue taxes :
'"The difficulty attending a wise
and fair revision of our tariff laws
is not under estimated. It will re
quire, on the part of congress, great
abor and care, and especially a
broad and national contemplation of
the subject and a patriotic disregard
of such local and selfish claims as
are unreasonable and reckless of the
welfare of the entire country. Under
our present laws more than tour
thousand articles are subject to duty.
Many of these do not in any way
compete with our own manufactures,
and many are hardly worth attention
as subj-cts of revenue. A consid
erable reduction can be made in the
aggregate by adding them to the free
list. The taxation of luxuries pre
sents no features of hardship, but
the necessaries of life used and con
sumed by all the people, the duty
upon which adds to the cost of living
in every home, should be greatly
cheapened. The radical reduction
of the duties imposed upon raw ma
terial used in manufacturers of its
free importation is of course an im
portant factor in an effort to reduce
the urice of these necessaries. It
would not only relieve them from
the increased coot ciusod by tariff
on such material, but the inanufae-
ured product being thus cheapened,
that part of the tariff now laid upon
such product as a compensation to
our manufacturers for the present
price of raw material could be ae
cordingly modified. Such reduc
tion, or free importation, would serve
besides to largely reduce the revenue
It is not apparent how such a change
can have any injurious effect upon
our manufacturers. On the contra
ry, it would give them a better chance
in foreign markets with the nianu
facturers of other countries, who
cheapen their wares by free materi
al. Thus our people might have the
opportunity of extending their sales
beyond the limits of home consump
tion, saving them from the depres
sion, interruption in business and
loss caused bv a glutted domestic
market and affording their employes
more certain and steady labor, witli
its resulting quiet and contentment."
"The question thus imperatively
presented for solution should be ap
proached in a spirit higher than par
tisanship and considered in the flight
of that regard for patriotic dutv
which should characterize the action
of those interested with the zeal of a
confiding people, but the obligation
to declared party policy and princi
ple is not wanting to urge prompt
and effective action. It is a condi
tion which confronts us not a the
ory. Relief from this condition may
involve a slight reduction of the ad
vantages which we award our home
productions, but the entire withdraw
al of such advantages should not be
contemplated. The question of free
trade is absolutely irrevalent, and
the persistent claim made in certain
quarters that all efforts to relieve
the people from unjust and unneces
sary taxation are schemes of so-called
free traders is mischievous and
far removed from any considerations
for the public good. The simple and
plain duty w hich we owe the people
is to reduce taxation to the necessary
expenses of an economical operation
of the government and to restore to
the business of the country the mon
ey which we hold in the treasury
through the perversion of government
powers. These things can and should
be done with safety to all our indus
tries, without dangei to the oppor
tunity for rumerative labor which our
i workingmen need, and with benefit
to all our peop e by cheapening their
means of subsistence and increas
ing the measure of their com
forts." Worth, of Paris, lias deciii-d in favor of hoop,

SPBCIALCORRBSPOJiDESCK OF THI MONfTOl.
Washington, Dec. oth
Secretary Fairchild's report is v.j-y
volumnious and one that will be rad
with great interest. It represets
much earnest thought and hard wok.
for the secretary devoted a while
month's time to the great task befie
him. The report is in the secretart's
own nanciwriung. xms uol-uui oi
will not be submitted to congress m
til the second day after the meeting
of that body. Among the important
i , rn.: - .3
recommendations is the suggesun
that congress provide, for the erection
of a fire proof hall of records for the
better presentation of valuable got-
erument records that at present are
in too much danger of destruction.
Many of the president's friends are
again concerned about his health, on
account of his disinclination to tase
outdoor exercise. In this respect, M.
Cleveland differs greatly from most
of his predecessors, for an early jaurt
on foot was almost an invariable cus
tom with Mr. Arthur, General Grant
and other presidents.
During the mouth of November
there was a considerable increase ii
the national debt, chiefly because o;
the vast sums paid out for pensionsr
the amount being eighteen millim
dollars on that account. For the pe
riod in question, the receipts of t'ae
(TAvfirnmtint wprp nvp r a million iliV-
lars a dav.
The report, of the postmaster gen
eral makes a very favorable showing,
from which it appears that there has
been a gain of 84,480,000 in receipts,
as compared with the previous year,
while on the other hand, the increase
in expense is but little more than two
million dollars. The deficiency ,which,
two years ago was 8700, 000, has beet
reduced about three-fourths, and it it
estimated that it will almost entirely
disappear before the close of the cur
rent year, if the present promising
condition of the affairs of the depart
ment continues. In the matter of
changing officers, this report shows
that of the 2,337 presidential post
masters, who were in place March 4,
1885, but 340 remain 1,807 new
men having been appointed.' Another
feature of postal business that will
doubtless-interest many of your read
ers, is the official record of the amount
of money lost in dead letters, which,
for the past year footed up 829,687 :
of this amount the sum of 822,637
was restored to the owners ; the
amount of 86,772, which could not be
returned to the owners, was deposit
ed in the treasury, together with 82,
921, the sum realized from auctioa
sales of unclaimed parcels of mei
chaudise found in the mails.
The report of the controller of the
currency is one that will be read, es
pecially by business men, with more
than ordinary interest, as an import
ant addition is made in the practical
suggestion of a new code of bank
laws, a copy of which has been sent,
with an explanatory letter, to each
memoer of congress. Up to the 31st
of October the totI ..mh- uf ua"
tional banks organized was 3,s05,
of which 117 have failed, 625 have
crone into voluntary liquidation, leav
ing 3,061 banks still organized at
that date.
In the fiftieth congress, political
parties will be more evenly balanced
than for many years, the republican
majority having dwindled to almost
nothing in the senate, and the demo
cratic majority having been reduced
to about a dozen in the House. There
are three contested election cases in
the senate, and eight in the house.
The republicans have been felici
tating themselves that they would be
able to control the presidential elec
tion, in the event that there should
be no popular choice, as that party
claims a majority of the states bv
congressional delegations ; but this is
by no means an accomplished fact,
as the democrats, in settling the con
tested election cases from California
and Indiana, have it in their power
to trasfer the majority of the state
congressional delegations to that or
ganization. Since their arrival at the capital
over one hundred congressmen hare
been interviewed, and the drift of
sentiment is largely in favor of tariff
reform.
The democratic congressional cau
cus dereloped much excitement and
bitter feeling over the heated con
test for the doorkeepership, and there
was an occurrence that suggested a
slight resemblance to the proverbial
Donnybrook fair. The lie was passed
between the gentleman from Arkansas
and the gentleman from Georgia, and
these members then came to blows,
and bjood was drawn blfore the bel
ligerent legislators should be separat
ed by their friends.
President jyo tem of the senate,
John James Ingalls, may now be
numbered with the literary statesmen
like Blaine and Cox, as he will give
to the world a novel that will illus
trate his experience of public life.

sy, and demanded the repeal of the
resumption act after it had begun its
beneficent work.
With this wretched reeord,the dem
ocratic leaders at Washington now
announce that the tariff must be re
duced so as to get rid of the surplus.
This is to be their first point to at
tack, as it always has been hereto
fore. It matters not that the pros
perity of the entire country independ
ent on the prosperity of its manu
facture, and that when mills' and
shops are shut down then all their in
dustry is depressed, including agri
culture, trade and commerce. No
doubt the free list must be enlarged,
and the place to begin is with sugsr,
from ,the consumers of which lifty
millions are extorted. At least one
half of this should go.
So should one-half the tobacco tax if
not the whole of it. No doubt the
free list can be extended, but an
extension that simply breaks down
home manufactures and home wages
is not a wholesome way to reduce t he
surplus. British and Canadian inter
ests are hoping for this no doubt ;
hence their sympathies are with the
administration ; but these conditions
only render it justly suspicious that
their way is not our way. There can
be no general reduction of the tariff
without a reduction of wages.
Congress ought to make a resolute
attempt to restore the American car
rying trade. Should a liberal portion
of the surplus be devoted to that ob
ject, it would be wisely applied. This
was the one great enterpaise that the
republicans had not carried out in
their general scheme of suyplying the
waste of the war. Other and more
pressing matters had engaged their
attention. The restoration of the
party to national power on this
ground alone is not only warranted
but demanded. It is the only con
structive party in the country. The
postal telegraph is another enterprise
that ought to be established, and a
good bit of the surplus should go for
that. Telegraph.

To Save Life
Frequently lequnes prompt action. An
hour's delay waiting for the doctor may
be attended with serious consequent-en,
especially in cases of Croup, I'neumonia,
and other throat nnd lung troubles.
Hence, no family should be without a
bottle of Ayor's Cherry rectoritl,
which has proved itself, in thousands of
cases, the best Emergency Medicine
ever discovered. It gives prompt relief
and prepares the way for ft thorough
cure, which is certain to be eflected by
Its continued use.
S. II. Lntiiu. r, M. Mt. Vernon.
Oa., s ivs: " 1 lia found Aver's I'Imti v
Pectoral a pci-fci-t cirv fr Troup in all
cases. I have Un -uii the worst casts
relieved in a verv time by its use;
and I advise nil families to use it in sud
den emergencies, for coughs, croup, &c."
A. .1. Eidson, M. !-, Middletown,
Tetin.. savs : " I have used Ayer's
Cherrv Pectoral with the best effect in
my practice. This wonderful prepara
tion once saved my life. I had a con
stant cough, night sweats, was greatly
reduced in tlesh. and given up by my
physician. One bottle ami a half of the
Pectoral cured me."
" I cannot sav enough in praise of
Aver's Cherrv Pectoral," writes E.
Pragdon. of Palesiine. Texas, " ln-liev-iisg
iis I do that, but for its use, I should
long since have died."
