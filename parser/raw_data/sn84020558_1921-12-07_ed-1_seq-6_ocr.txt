NEW YORK. Dec. 6. The stock
market was fairly active and broad
again today but the only shares to
display consistent strength were
those favored by technical condi
tions, namely, an extensive short in
terest.
Favorable" developments, such as
President Harding's message and the
strength of foreign exchange failed
to stimulate public support, but im
pelled considerable short covering in
the later dealings.
The feature of the message which
seemed to cause disappointment was
ins qualified reference to the coun
try's merchant marine. Shippings
reacted sharply, mercantile marine
preferred being under .pressure.
Declaration of regilar dividends
by numerous industrial companies.
including American Car and Foundry
and payment of several deferred div
idends indicated more hopeful trade
prospects.
Motors, rubbers, oils, chemicals.
merchandising and utility issues tea.
tured the constructive side at ex
treme gains of one to six Doints.
Rails lagged until well towards the
finish, when lehigh Vallev became
the center of interest. Steels, equip
ments and leathers were moderately
reactionary. Sales. 750.000 shares.
Call loans ruled at 4 per cent un
til the final hour, an unexpected in
quiry forcing the rte to 5 per. cent
on prime collateral 30 and 60-day
loans were made in moderate
amounts at 4 per cent.
Settlement of the Irish question
caused a brisk rise in sterling ex
change to 4.08 54 for demand bills.
that figure exceeding the maximum
of the last two years. Important
continental rates, including German
marks, were 5 to 15 points higher.
and Swiss francs at 19.30 equaled
their par or pre-war value.
turther realizing sales accounted
for the irregular tone of the bond
market, that condition applying espe
cially to Liberty and Victory issues.
Rails reacted to the heavy trend of
Pennsylvania and St. Paul issues and
internationals were less active than
at any recent period.
lotal sales, par value, $20,7o0,000.
CHICAGO BOARD.
, CHICAGO, Dec. 6. Wheat under
went a material setback in price to
day owing largely to reports of poor
demand for cash wheat and flour at
Minneapolis. The close was heavy,
Si to 3c lower, with May 1.12'i to
1.12. and July 1.011 to 1.01,.
l to Provisions varied from un
changed figures to 7Va advance.
Before stuting to decline, wheat
temporarily showed considerable
firmness. . Prospects that Germany
would be granted three years' respite
from cash indemnity payments ap
peared to have much to do with the
early price upturns. Gossip was also
current about crop deterioration in
Argentina, that country being repre
sented as rebuying grain sold to
Great Britain. Demand here, how
ever, lacked volume and bulls seemed
to lose confidence when news came
that Minneapolis wheat stocks were
increasing and that the milling de
mand for wheat in any position had
fallen off. Scattered liquidation here
ensued and with no aggressive sup
port in sight, the finish was at the
day's low.
President Harding's recommenda-.
tion that the Rust-inn relief commis-'
sion be given ten million bushels of
corn had no apparent effect on corn.
The country sold corn rather liber
ally to arrive and prices were on the
down grade. Oats receded with other
grain.
Higher quotations on hogs gave a
little firmness to provisions.

short time.

strictly up-to-date. I renew your
shoes exactly as the factory would
