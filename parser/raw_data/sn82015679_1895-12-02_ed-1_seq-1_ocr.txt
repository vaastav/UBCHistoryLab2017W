NEW WOOL EXCHANGE.
Ilovr Xew York Hopes to Capture the
Trade of Huston and London.
NEW YORK. Dec. 1. The Herald to-day
says: Tho opening of tho Wool Exchange,
whose- handsome new building' at Beach
street ami West Broadway is almost com
pleted, Js expected to make Xew York tha
wool market of tho country and to revolu
tionize the methods of the business both
here and in the East. It is asserted by
those who are back of this scheme that It
t fleet will be to drive the wool trade of
Boston to this city in a body. Already
many Eastern merchants and traders have
taken offlccs in the Wool Exchange build
ing. There has never before been an es
tablished center for the marketing of wool
in thl country. Wool merchants ahd
brokers in this city, for example, wer
scattered about from Canal to Tine street.
There was no concert among them and no
means of providing entertainment or ac
commodations for the out-of-town trade.
.Many merchants have long been convinced
that New York, as the natural port of en
try of the country, should be provided with
fcllitJ-s for the sale of foreign wool. It
was eeu that It this was done, merchants
would no longer h obliged to go to Lon
ilon to bid on their wool, as thev do a;
present, but could transact all the'lr busi
tifia In New York. Th- new Wool Ex

Another important feature of this cen

WOMAN HOLDS UP A TRAIN.
She rianta Ileraelf on the Track nnd
the Cam Come to a Stop.
MORIUSTOWX. N. J.. Dec. 1. The
Whlppany River railroad on Tuesday went
into tho hands of a receiver, and yesterday
one of Its trains was held up by a woman.
Mrs. Margaret Conley did the Job. The
railroad runs through her farm. There has
been a. dispute about the right of way. It
culminated by Mrs. Conley planting herself
on the track In front of an incoming train.
The engineer saw her, blew his whistle
and put on the brakes. She stood immova
ble, with arms akimbo and head defiantly
thrown back. The train stopped within a
few feet of her.
"Whv don't you get off the track?"
shouted the engineer, when he recognized
who It was.
"Why doesn't your road pay me what it
owes for right of way through ray prop
erty?" she retorted.
Then the proceedings became spicy. Final
ly the engineer pleaded. He was delayed
and must go by. Mrs. Conly was as in
flexible as the rock of Gibraltar. Thero
was nothing else to do. and Charles H.
Marshall, the fireman, climbed down and
?ently led Mrs. Conley from the track,
he did not resist. She did not do a
thin? but swear out a warrant charging
Marshall with assault and battery, and he
is now under bond to answer to the next
grand jury. Then ihe train rolled on.

Mnilame 111 avat sky's Secretary Score
the Christian Kndearorers.
NEW YORK. Dec. 1. Claude Falls
Wright, secretary to the late Madame Bla
vatsky, delivered a lecture on "Occult
Phenomena" at Chickering Hall to-day.
The lecture was under the auspices of the
Aryan Theosophlcal Society. During tho
course of his lecture Mr. Wright created a
sensation by referring to the prayers of a
large body of Christian Endeavorers in
Cleveland, O., for the converslo: of Colonel
lngersoll. "They are doing a great wrong,"
said he, "and are practicing sorcery or
black magic. You have no right to attempt
to change a man's life because you think
It wrong and because it differs from your
own. If lngersoll wants to have a cer
tain religion, why should he not? The Chris
tian Endeavorers are not doina1 the fair
thing. I don't think they will have much
success. They are not competent to havo
great Influence, as their minds aro not
ritjht. lngersoll Is a good man, and this
effort Is only a display of egotism."
CHRISTIANITY IN HAWAII.
How Its Spread "Wn Stayed and Idol
atrous "Worship Restored.
NEW YORK, Dec. 1. The Rev. Robert
Stuart MacArthur delivered a sermon ii the
Calvary Baptist Church to-night on "The
Responsibility of Kalakaua and Liliuok.i
lant." After referring to the characteristics
of the Hawaiian, whom ho pronounced a
good-hearted and generous people, ha
quoted figures to show the falling oft In tho
number of Christian converts among the na
tives since the reign of Kamehameha V,
who removed all restraint from the Hula
masters and the Kahuna influence, and
thereby aided the spread of idolatry. From
1SCS, when missionaries first visited the
inlands, to 1S18. 27.000 converts to Christian
ity, were madC Twenty thousand more
converts , Joined the Christian - standard
within the next twenty years, and In lfcsrt
'.t becams necessary to put some restraint
on the officials, because they were almost
forcing the people into adopting the Chris
tian religion. Shortly after this a crisis
was precipitated ami the churches were
considered as independent organizations.
This action was unfortunate in its results.
In 1SSS there were only G,i33 converts among
the. natives In the islands, and within the
next three or four years the number was
still further decreased. This alarming fall
ing off was. not to be ascribed wholly to the
largo decrease in the native population. In
the early days the people were governed bv
chief.-, who materially aided the missionar
ies, but after the passing away of these
tribal rulers no authority whatever wa ex
ercised in favor of religion.
Among the causes which the preacher
held responsible for the reaction in the
spread of Christianity in the island was the
rise of the Kahuna and the Hula masters.
The former is a form of superstitious wor
ship and the latter a kind of. priest, who
favored the practice of Idolatrous cere
monies. The worst forms of heathenism
were revived under Kalakaua, who formed
the Hula Nana Society. He also en
eouraged the heathen dancing, and let loose
the monster of drunkenness and lewd
ness. He was a man utterly devoid of prin
ciple, the preacher said. It was related of
him that he once accepted from a Chinamatt
a bride of $70,000. for which he granted the
Celestial the exclusive right to sell opium
on the islands. A few days later he gave
the same privilege to another Chinaman for
rHOCO. leaving --the two men to fight it out
between themselves. Liltuokalanl, who sue,
ceeded her brother. Kalakaua. was little
better than he was. Oa July 14, lSUS, she
proclaimed her Intention of forming a new
constitution. The majority of the residents
of the islands told her not to meddle with
the constitution or she would go. She de
clared that she would meddle with it, and
she went, and she never returned to power.
Dr. MacArthur said that ho bad great
hopes for the Hawailans now that they were
In enjoyment of a pure and free govern
ment. lie eulogized the officers of state,
who are administering the affairs Tit tho
people. "They were good. Christian men.
he exclaimed, "and their government is the
purest in the world to-day."
RELAY BICYCLE RACK
MILITIAMEN HIDING FROM WASH

Carrliiflr 3lesM.ge from Grnrml

Gotham Good Time Made.
WASHINGTON D.c 2 Precisely at 7,
o'clock this mornir.s th military relay
bicycle ride from thia city to New York
was begun, when a mcssago from General
Miles, commanding th army, was given In
charge of two members of the local Na
tional Guard for delivery to army head
quarters at Nev York. This is said to be
one of tho longest runs of the kind that
has ever been undertaken, and it has re
ceived the orticial sanction of the command
ing generul of the army and General Ord
waj commanding ' tljo District National
Guard. According to schedule, the dis
tance is 213i miles, and twenty-three hours
was allowed in which to cover it. This Is
the maximum of time and allows plenty of
margin for improvement. The schedule
calls for ten relays between the two points,
the shortest of which will be MP.i miles and
the longest thirty-five miles. The message
from General Miles was delivered from tne
stps of the War Department to Capt. S. If.
Wiggins and Sergeant R. I. Durfee, who
were to cany It from this city to Columbia
on tho road , to Baltimore, a distance of
2Sa mile, in three hours. The mes
sage was very brief, being to the effect that
it would bo delivered by military cyclists
of the District, as' an indication of the
availability of the bicycle in time of war.
Twenty men will be used in the ride.
Preparations have been made for pacers
along tho route and a quick run is expectr

They reported encountering several
stretches of bad road between the points
and having to carry their wheels a great,
deal of nc way. The Journey from here to
Belairr Md., was taken up by Messrs. At

IMMORALITY AT ELLIS ISLAND.
Employes of the Immigration Darenn
Charged with Wrongdoing:.
NEW YORK, Dec. 1. During the past
week Commissioner Stump, of Washington,
has been in this city conducting an in
vestigation Into immoralities alleged to have
occurred at Ellis Island recentls. Xo publlp'
report has been made concerning the mat
ter, but it is understood, that some of the
employes attached to the Ellis Island Im
migration Bureau in a minor capacity,
have been accused of wrong doing. .Some
of the young women, who have been de
tained at tho island by the local immigra
tion commissioners, pending investigation
Into their cases, being also, accused of im
moralities. The story first came out
through the confeslon of a night watchman
who boasted of an intrigue with Miss Annie
N. Grimmer, a governess from Bremen,
Germany. Mis Grimmer eloped with a
well-known architect at Bremen. The
architect was permitted to land, as he had
relatives in New York, but the. young
woman was held pending an investigation.
Before the board of special inquiry had re
ported on her case, the boasts of the watch
man reached the ears of his superiors and
Misa Grimmer, being deemed an immoral
character, was sent back to Germany. Sev
eral cases of a similar nature have since
been discovered and the Immigration com
missioners are now trying to determine the
extent to which the service has been 'af
fected by the misconduct of subordinates.
MISTAKEN FOB A BURG LAB.

RATA VIA, X. Y., Dec. 1. A terrible trag
edy took place at the house of Willis
Broughton, located about three milts south
of Corfu, in the town of Darien, early this
morning. Broughton was awakened by a
noise in the back yard, and, seeing a person
coming towards the house, took him for a
burglar. Arming himself with an ax,
Broughton secreted himself in the wood
shed. When the man entered the shed,
Broughton struck him five times on the
head with the blade of the axe, inflicting
fatal wounds. When a light was secured
Broughton was horrified- to find that tho
supposed burglar was his hired man, Will

Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1. The Fifty
fourth Congress will convene at noon to
morrow, but the Presidents message will
not be submitted to the legislators until
Tuesday. The house will be organized by
the election of the Republican caucus nomi
nees, but whether the Republicans of the
Senate will attempt to reorganize . that
body is still a mattri of doubt. The caucus
of the Republican Senators to-morrow after
noon bids fair to brliig to a crisis tho latent
antagonism between the older and the
younger men In the ody. Within the past
few years there hasten a large influx of
new members from: the. newly admitted
States, nono of whom has much patience
or reverence for the ancient tradition and
"senatorial courtesy" rubbish on which
older Senators dwell with o much solemn
emphasis. Senator Edmunds resigned from
the Senate because of the levity of some
of the new men and every young man who
has entered the chamber has struck fresli
terror to the hearts of the veteran like
Messrs. Sherman, Hoar, Morgan, Harris
and their contemporaries. To-morrow's
caucus will see the contest fought out. The
young element wants a redi vision of the
appropriation bills so that committees on
which they sit shall have a word in the
apportionment of the vast millions 'that are
appropriated every year. At present near
ly every one of tho thirteen appropriation
bills is in the hands of the appropriations
committee and that committee is exclusive
ly composed of old members. The river and
harbor appropriation come from the com
merce committee, but that, too, is monopo
lized by veterans. Hence the protest of the
3'oung men. Senator Dubois, of Idaho, is
the leader of the young men and he can be
depended on to conduct a lively campaign.
How far he will succeed It is useless to
attempt to predict, but he is convinced that
victory, if won, will perch only after the
hardest fight he has ever had. It is in
timated that the case of Mr. Dupont, who
was clected.Senator from Delaware, may
come up for casual discussion and there
is strong reason to believe that there is a
marked differ? nco. of opinion . among tho
Republican Senators as to the strength of
Mr. Dupont's case. Should this prove to be
so all possibility of a reorganization of tho
Senate this session in destroyed, since even
with the two new Senators from Utah Mr.
Dupont's vote is needed to give the Re
jnibiicans a majority, in the F-nate. There
will bo some effort' made by certain Re
publican Senators to remove Colonel Bright,
the Sergeant-at-arms, but it cannot suc
ceed, except by consent of several Demo
cratic Senators.' before the Republicans se
cure control. Colonel Bright has recently
been casting an anchor to windward by
removing some Democrats on the Senato
force and appointing Republicans In their
place.
"REED'S RULES" MAY BE ADOPTED.
The first week of the new Congress prom
ises nothing at either end of the Capitol
in the way of actual legislation. The time
before the Christmas holidays is usually
devoted to preliminary matters and the
work of the session does not begin until
after the recess. The new Congress will
probably not be an exception to this rule.
As stated, the Senate proceedings may be
enlivened by an attempt at reorganization,
but in the House nothing can bo done until
the committees are appointed. Speaker
elect Reed says that the committees will
not bo announced this week, with, perhaps,
ia single exception the committee on rules.
This committee formulates the rules which
are to govern the House during Its sessions
and it is customary for the Speaker to name
it during the first week in order that it can
Immediately begin its labors. While it is
believed that the rules of the Fifty-first
Congress,- over which Mr. Reed presided,
will be reported for the guidance of the
present House, it Is understood that a few
changes will r?o made as a result of ex
perience which are designed to still fur
ther Improve the House machinery and
the facilitation of public business. To-morrow
Mr. Kerr, Clerk of the last House,
will call the House to order. After the roll
call the election of the officers nominated
by the Republican caucus Saturdav night
will occur, and as soon as Mr. Reed Is
formally installed as Speaker the drawing
of seats, which I known as the congres
sional "raffle,", will follow. This is a some
what tedious but amusing affair, and will
occupy the remainder of the afternoon. Th
reading of the President's message will
consume Tuesday, and at its conclusion the
House will probably adjourn until Thursday,
and, on convening Thursday, adjourn Im
mediately until Monuay. These adjourn
ments will continue probably until the
committees aro announced. This is the
programme, but the unexpected might oc
cur, as it so often does in the House, if
some aspiring members should introduce u
sensational resolution and ask for its im
mediate consideration.
It Is not probable that the first week will
witness much serious effort at legislative
work in the Senate. If anything should be
accomplished beyond the receipt of the
President's message and of the recess
nominations and the introduction of bills,
the session would b an exception in the
history of the Senate. In view of the fact
that .he message will not be received until
Tuesday, the proceedings of Monday w.ll
consist in the swearing in of the newly
elected members who may be present and
tho appointment of a committee to wait on
the President. The session will probably
not continue beyond 1 o'clock, when the
Republicans will meet in caucus. The mes
sage will be read on Tuesday, and the
brief sessions of Wednesday and Thursday
will be devoted largely to the introduction
of bills, of which there will be several
hundred. Following precedents, the Senate
will adjourn on Thursday until the follow
ing Monday. One or two brief executive
sessions for the reference of nominations
are also among the probabilities for the
week. If the Republicans decide on an
effort to reorganize the Democrats will fol
low with a conference on Tuesday or
Wednesday, at which they probably will
decide on a course of action. It now ap
pears probable that all three parties will
place candidates for President pro tem. in
the field, and in that event the week will
be enlivened somewhat by a triangular con
test for this and the other offices of the
Senate.
A call has been issued- for a meeting of
silver Senators to be Meld in the marblo
room at 11 o'clock to-morrow for the pur
pose of discussing the feasibility of organiz
ing the Senate on a silver basis. It is
signed by four Populist Senators and has
been sent to all the Republican and silver
Senators who have professed allegiance to
the silver cause.
Representative Lawrence McGann, of Chi
cago, who held a rrst In the Fifty-second
and Fifty-third Cor reises and was chair
man of the commit, e on labor In the last
Congress, will fur. V to the House the
unusual spectacle - J member making a

he is able to r recognition from the
Speaker Mr. Zt: i ttIU make a statement
to the Hous: r eKect tr.it hz ttlzli
that his Republican opponent. Mr. Hugh
R. Belknap, is entitled to the seat and that
he (McGann) waives all claims thereto.
This step will make it possible for the com
mittee on elections, as soon an it is or-'
ganlzed, to report in favor of seating Mr.
Belknap and will relieve that gentleman of
the necessity of making a contest before
the committee. Mr. Belknap, who will suc
ceed Mr. McGann, is a son of Hon. W.
W. Belknap, who was Secretary of War
under President Grant.
l'EXSIOX SIEASritES.
Legislation That Will lie Iraed He
fore Congress ly Mr. Overstreet. .
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON, Dec 1. Representative
Overstreet, of Indiana, will Introduce at the
earliest practicable moment, two bills which
will prove of deep interest to all pensioners.
The first measure will strike at the evil
of the dangerous influences that beset pen
sioners when they come to the pension
agencies to draw-their money. Under the
present law pensioners may obtain their
money either by draft or on personal ap
plication to the pension agent. The pur
pose of the latter provision was to facilitate
the paj-ment of their money to pensioners
who live at the pension agency cities. The
law has worked very unsatisfactorily, how
ever, because most pensioners deem it de
sirable to travel from their homes to the
pension agency and there obtain their
money. . Unscrupulous men at every agency
have made a practice of turning pension
day Into a bacchanalian revel for the" pen
sioner, and it is no unusual occurrence
that the pensioners have yielded to tempta
tion and have drunk or gambled away every
cent of their pension money within twenty
four hours alter it was received, and the
pension intended by a grateful country to
maintain Its gallant saviors and their fam
ilies has wandered into the pockets of sa
loon keepers or gamblers. .To obviate this
evil Mr. Overstreet proposes to amend the
existing law by sulking out tho provision
to pay pensions on demand, and to thus
make all payments of pensions by draft.
Pensioners will ilnd that the law, it thus
amended, will prove of incalculable benefit
to -them. They will be saved the expense
now incurred in traveling from their homes
to the agency, and the pension will find Its
way to their families, whither it was In
tended. Mr. Overstreet has been in corre
spondence with evefy agent of the depart
ment, and the majorltj indorse his pro
posed bill.
Another bill which he will Immedately
Introduce is designed to make a oldiers
pension, when once awarded, a vpsted right.
At present, under a recent legal decision,
e.ery pensioner Is at the mercy of the Com
missioner of Pensions. Mr. Overstreet
hopes to place on the statute .books a law
which Insures to the pensioner his pension
until he has been convicted by the govern
ment of fraud in obtaining Jt. or has been
legally proved not to be entitled to its fur
ther payment.

Hoke Smith ftct Entangled' In the
Applications of Trro Brothers.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 'L Secretary Hoke
Smith to-day found himself enveloped in a
verltabTe comedy of errors, which has gone
as far as a 'presidential commission, signed
and sealed by the President, and which will
result In the bitter disappointment of one
man and the great rejoicing of another.
Some time ago the receiver of the land
office at Alva, O. T.. died, and there
was quite a contest waged for the appoint
ment of his successor. Papers were re
ceived from a number of applicants, and
what appeared to be a double set of papers
indorsing James W. Conian. formerly of
Mississippi, but now of Oklahoma. This
candidate was Indorsed most heartily by
Governor Stone, of Mississippi, a well
known administration stalwart The two
sets of papers were not explained, but no
one paid much attention to them.
Secretary Smith liked the application and
the proposed qualifications of candidate Co.
man, and decided upon his appointment.
A commission wa3 ms.de out and sent to
the President, receiving Immediately his
signature. The appointment was made pub
lie through the press, and soon a letter wah
received from Mississippi thanking the Sec
retary for the appointment, although the
commission had not been mailed. This let
ter led ultimately to the discovery that the
man in Mississippi who had been appointed
was not the man whom the Secretary had
intended to appoint and that all the boast
of a home-rule appointment, which wa$
made at the time the appointment was.
made public, was untrue. There are, it
gcems, two brothers Coman, one J. W.,
who lives in Mississippi, and one J. J., for
two years a resident of Alva. Both had re
ceived general commendation from Gov.
Stone, and neither knew that his brother
was an applicant for the placet It seem
that Governor Stone himself did not real
ize he had Indorsed the two men for the
.same place.
There is nothing to be done now but to
recall the commission, which, fortunately, la
still at the department, and, in spite of dis
appointment and regret, to make the home
rule appointment first intended.
MIL REED'S SPEECH
Of 3Iore Importance than the Presi
dent's Message or Carlisle Report.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON, Dec. l.-The address of
Mr. Reed, in acknowledging the compliment
paid him by his party In its unanimous
nomination for the speakership, is in every
way a more important statement than will
be either the annual message of the Presi
dent next Tuesday or the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury on the following
day. How totally Mr. Cleveland's most
earnest warnings and most Importunate
entreaties were disregarded by his own
party was shown again and again In the
last session of the Fifty-third Congress,
and not even the critical emergency that
led the President to urge actiorl In a spe
cial 'message waa sufficient to bring his
party Into line. As for Mr. Carlisle, the
men of his own party were his bitterest as
sailants, and the most reskless denuncia
tion of his recommendations came from the
Democratic side. There is consequently no
reason to ascribo to Mr. Cleveland's mes
sage to a Republican House any more than
the interest (which is really curiosity) al
ways attaching to the hebetudlnous plati
tudes of which Mr. Cleveland is master.
Mr. Reed's utterances, on the contrary,
were the words of a leader secure of obedi.
encc. Mr. Reed's remarks are interpreted
bv all members of Congress to-day as In
dicating that the only work for the ways
and means committee at this session will
be to frame some simple measures that will
raise revenue and that no elaborate tariff
bill will be attempted. This belief finds
support in the general supposition that
Air. Reed has determined to appoint
neither Messrs. Dalzell or Payne to
the chairmanship of the ways and
means committee, but his colleague,
Mr. DIngley. who it is true, lacKs
the brilliancy and magnetism that
are' indispensable for leadership in the
House, but possesses in unequaled degrees
an accurate acquaintance with the sources
of revenue and the expenditures of the
government. With. Mr. Dingley at the head
of the wavs ana means comnmiee . simpie
but effectlvo measure may be expected,
which will accomplish Mr. Reed's promise
that revenues sufficient for the government
shall be raised and that confidence shall
be restored to the business world.
Hooslers Lit on Their Feet.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON. Dee. L Though the slate
of the McDowell combine was broken when
the chaplain was'elected, the Indiana dele
gation lit on its feet as usual. Mr. Hemen
way was deeply impressed with the merits
of Mr. Couden's case, and determined from
the outset to voto for him In preference to
Mr. Fisher, the candidate of the combine.
lie persuaded Messrs. Steele and Johnson,
to vote with him on the first ballot. On the
second ballot he carried Messrs. Watson and
Royse over into the Couden camp, and on
the third and last ballot the entire delega
tion was voting for the blind minister, with
the exception only of Henry, Overstreet
and Tracewell. Mr. Couden is an uncle of
Mr. Hemenway by marriage. The delega
tion is congratulating itself that on affairs
spiritual as well as matters temporal, it got
in on the ground floor.

AN ODD GENIUS.
Denver Preacher's Opinion
Schlatter, the 'Messiah."
of
NEW YORK. Dec. L-In view of the re
ports that Schlatter, the "healer," may
soon appear in New York, the Rev. A. C.
Peck, director of the Haymarket Mission,
of Denver, Col., visiting in the East, was
asked to-night what he thought of Schlat
ter, who had been posing as the Messiah in
Denver. "Well," Fald Mr. Peck, with a
laugh. "Schlatter is an odd genius any
way you tako him. .1 believe he is perfectly
sincere. Of course, I do hot believe ho is
divine. His words and actions leave no ex
planation except that he is daf."
The Hev. Mr. Peck said he believed
Schlatter, notwithstanding his delusion, has
done a lot of good, and adJel: "Ik. has
made a lot of people who were perfectly
well certain of that fact, and that is worth a
good deal. In every city there are plenty
of people who think they are sick when
they are not. Schlatter makes these peo
ple think they are cured, which is Just as
beneficial as if they were. No, I never saw
any of his cures, although I have heard
of them. I have bad people whom I knew
tell me that he had cured them of differ
ent things, but I had not previously known
they were sick. Some of them claimed re
lief from rheumatism; It certainly had not
been sufficiently sever to make them
limp."
Mr. Peck says he has been told, too, that
Schlatter possesses some magnetic power.
T never took his hand myself." said Mr.
Peck, "but I have been told that he com
mnulcates a kind of electric shock by con
tact, a phenomenon which, I believe, is not
uncommon."
LION DAN IS DEAD.
Went Mad After Ilnrlng a, Tooth
traded nnd AYns Killed.
Ex-
TORONTO, Dec 1. The big trick
lion
Dan, valued at $1,000, which had been exhib
ited all over the continent, was killed yes
terday at a local museum, where it was
being exhibited. One day last week the
brute had a light with his keeper over his
dinner, and received a wound in his Up,
through which one of his teeth protruded.
This caused the lion great pain and nearly
drovo it frantic. Yesterday a veterinary
dentist was called. The Hon, which 'was
the largest in Colonel Boone's possession,
was coaxed out of its cage and walked
into a network of ropes and chains. It was
secured and chloroformed. Then, with a
pair of forceps with handles like crowbars,
the dentist grasped the tooth and pulled it
out. The extraction of the tooth sudden
ly aroused the lion and it wrenched one
of Its paws loose and began frothing at the
mouth, exhibiting signs of lelng mad.
Chloroform was then administered in suf
ficient quantity to kill him. anl Colom-l
Boone said the killing was necessary. The
lion was four years old.

Details of the Revolt of Arabs, Who

LONDON, Dec 2. A dispatch from Con
stantinople says: It is stated that ths
American admiral at Smyrna recently asked
permission to bring an Ironclad bore to
visit the Sultan, but permission was re
fused. An Odessa dispatch to the Dally News
sajs: Many British captains are complain
ing of the provocative attitude of the Turks
In, the Dardanelles. Captain Noble, of the
steamship Loch Rannoch, says that a few
days ago he arrived at Chanak. In the Dar
danelles, four minutes after sundown. He
observed that the shore on either sile a
lined with troops under canvas. Field can.
non, only partially masked, were placed at
close stages along the embankment. Two
blank shots, one from each shore, were
fired at the Loch Rannoch. Thinking that
this was done y in. the course of military
maneuvers, Captain Noble paid no atten
tion, when three shells were fird. one of
them coming within a yard of Captain No
ble's head. He reversed his engines anl
signaled the Siren. He was so astonlfhed
that he thought war had been declared, be
tween England and Turkey, as usually k
time margin Is allow ed at sundown. Ths
head of the Dardanelles is covered with
torpedoes, to the great anxiety of mer
chantmen. One exploded recently and
nearly wrecked a French vessel."
. A letter from Aden, Arabia, dated Nov.
20. gives details of tho Arabian revolt
against the Sultan in Yemen, the coffee
growing district of southwestern Arabia. .
The Importance of the outbreak lies in it
proximity to Mecca. The loss to the Sultan
of the Mussulman holy city would probably
mean his deposition. Hence the strenuous
official denials which havo been mede of the
existence of the rebellion. So far the re
volt has been confined to the district around
Kharmar. two days' Journey from Saana,
the capital of Yemen. The rebels number '
43,000 Arabs, armed with Martini and Snyaer
rifles, and are lei by Say Yid. a pretender
to the lmaunshlp of the whole Yemen coun
try, who wields a great influence and sur
reptitiously collects tribute or taxes from
air Arab ttibes under Turkish rule. Six
thousand Turkish troop recently arrived
at 1 S.iana from Constantinople, and were
distributed emong the garrisons in the
Kharmar district. The rebels had already
captured, after severe lighting and much
bloodshed, two Turkish forts at Kharmar
and Ralabula. In the latter three hundred
Turks were killed. The garrison Ted to
Masmer, and begged' the twenty-live
sheikhs there to help to recapture Balbuda.
The sheikhs refused, and were taken to
Saana and Imprisoned. The telegraph Is
constantly cut, and Say Yld, the pretender,
burns the letters and presents which the
Sultan sends.
The Constantinople corresondent of the
Times says, with reference to the rumors
that the Sultan is insane, that he (the cor
respondent) gleans from the diplomat a
who have most recently eeen him that the
Sultan brings to all government business a
mind highly gifted with reasoning power;
that he is entirely satisfied with his own
mode of ruling, arid is convinced that, al
though it is not ideally perfect, it Is the
best adapted to the conditions of his em
pire. "Viewing matters from his own
standpoint," the correspondent says, "hls
reasoning is lucid, consistent and cogent."
The Daily News has a dispatch from
Constsantlnoj.le which says: "All the Ar
menians employed at the palace are being
dismissed on various pretexts. The Ameri
can missionaries at Kharput. Bitlis and
Marash are practically prisoners. They are
protected by the troops but are afraid to
venture uion the streets. The surviving
Christians of the villages near Mook!i,
( Kharput and Arabklr are being offered the
choice between Islamism ami the sword. -The
Porte has documents purporting to be
written by Armenians at Kharput, accusing
the American missionaries of Imbuing
youthful Armenians with revolutionary
ideas."
A dispatch from Constantinople to the
Chronicle says: "Dyavld, the son of Ilallf
RIfaat, Grand Vizier, has been txlid to
Syria on the Sultan discovering that he had
demanded a. bribe of 3,) pounds sterling
as the price of his father's favorable report
on the loan negotiations with the tobae-eo
monojKdlsts.j TJie Sultan Is furious and will
probablyVdjsnilss Hnllf Rtfaat."

Sir Philip Currle'w Itcaons for Re

CONSTANTINOPLE. via Sofia. Bul
garia, Nov. CO. It has not yet bem con
clusively developed here what is to be the
effect on the disordered tate of the m
plro of the relinquishment, temorarJiy, at
joast, of the purpose of the owpri u In
troJitCH adltlonal guard ships into tic Dar
danelles for the protection of foreUnets In
the domain of th Sultan. The ordering
back to Salonlca bay of the British gun
boat Dryad, which had been ordered tp to
the Dardanelles, at the request of the nit
ish fmbassador, Sir Philip Currie. in untid-'
pat ion of tho promised granting of the llr
,mans by the Sultan for war spjr tj jf.ss
through, is officially expl?icj on the
ground that tho proposed action would do
more harm than good by inflaming the
fanaticism of ihe Tutks against foreigners
on account of tho supposed affront to the
Sultan of what would, in effect, have
amounted to a naval demonstration a? r.nst
Constantinople. The effect of the abandon-
ment of its purpos.; by Great Britain cn
the situation in Turkey is awaltei with
anxiety anl great interest. Th qucrftloi
of guard ships seems at a FtanJstiil for
the present, though the threat of Sir Plul'p
Currie to renew his puriose unless foreign
ers should be exempt from outrage Is sill!
open.
Undoubtedly one effect of the crLrlns
back of the Dryad to Salouica Is that tht
belief in the often-alleged concert cf tin

waning. The Sultan is known jto have l-r
