PRESIDENT'S
ANNUAL MESSAGE
(Continued from page 6)
colliers, torpedo-boat destroyers or
torpedo boats, will have to be built
also. All this, be It remembered,
would not increase our navy, but
wouid merely keep it at its present
strength. Equally of course, the
ships will be absolutely useless if
the men aboard them are not so
trained that they can get' the best
possible service out of the formidable
but delicate and complicated mechan
isms intrusted to their care. The
marksmanship of our men lias so im
proved during the last five years that
I deem it within bounds to say that
the navy is more than twice as effi
cient, sliip for ship, as half a decade
ago. The navy can only attain prop
er efficiency if enough officers and
men are provided, and if these offi
cers and men are given the chance
(and required to take advantage of
it) to stay continually at sea and to
exercise the fleets singly and above
all in squadron, the exercise to be
of every kind and to include unceas
ing practice at the guns, conducted
under conditions that will test
marksmanship In time of war.
In both the army and the navy
there Is urgent need that everything
possible should be done to maintain
the highest standard for the person
nel, alike as regards the officers and
the enlisted men. I do not believe
that 'in any service there is a finer
body of enlisted men and junior offi
cers than we have in both the army
and the navy. Including the murine
corps. All possible encouragement
to the enlisted men should be given,
in pay and otherwise, and everything
practicable done to render the ser
vice attractive to men of the right
type. They should bo held to the
strictest discharge of their duty, if
it conduc es to the honor 4md the in
terest of the American nation; and in
return the amplest consideration
should be theirs.
West Point, and Annapolis already
turn out excellent officers. We do
not need to have these schools made
more scholasic. On the contrary we
should never lose sight of the fact
thai the aim of each school Is to
turn out a man who shall be above
everything else a fighting man. li
the army in particular it is not nec
essary that either the cavalry or In
fantry officer should have special
mathematical ability. Probably in
licit h schools the best part of the
education is the high standard of
professional morale which it eonrf
fern.
Hut in both services there is ur
genr need for the establishment of
a principle of selection which will
eliminate men after a certain age t.'
they can not be promoted from the
subordinate ranks, and which will
bring Into the higher ranks fewer
men, and these at an earlier age.
This principle of selection will be
objected to by good men of medi
ocre capacity who are fitted to do
well while young in the lower posi
tions, but who are not fitted to do
well when at an advanced age they
come into positions of command and
of great responsibility. But the
desire of these men to be promoted
to positions which they are not com
petent to fill should not weigh
against the interests of the navy and
the country. At present our men,
especially In the navy, are kept far
too long in the junior grades, and
then, at much too advanced an age.
are put quickly through the senior
grades, often not attaining to these
senior grades until they are too old
to be of real use In them; and if
they are of real use, being put
through them so quickly that little
benefit to the navy comes from their
having been In them at all.
The navy has one great advantage
over the army In the fact that the
officers of high rank are actually
trained in the contiual performance
of their duties; that Is, in the man
agement of the battle ships and ar
mored cruisers gathered into fleets.
This is not true of the army officers,
who rarely have corresponding
chances to exercise command over
troops under service conditions. The
conduct of the Spanish war showed
the lamentable loss of life, the use
less extrnvgance, and the inefficiency
certain to result, if during peace the
high officials of the war and navy de
part ni"nts are praised and rewarded
only if they save money at no matter
what cost to the efficiency of the
. service, and if the higher officers
are given no chance whatever to ex
ercise and practice command. For
years prior to the Spanish war the
secretaries of war were praised
chiefly If they pactlced economy;
which economy, especially in connec
tion with the quartermaster, com
missary, and medical departments,
was directly responsible for most of
the mismanagement that occurred in
the war Itself and parenthetically
be It observed that the very people
who clamored for the misdirected
economy In the first place were fore
most to denounce the mismanage
ment, loss, and'.mfferlng which were
primarily due to this stune misdi
rected economy and to the lack of
preparation it involved. There should
soon be an Increase in the number
of men for our coast defenses; these
men should be of the right type and
properly trained; and there should
therefore be an Increase of pay for
certain skilled grades, especially in
the coast artillery. Money should be
appropriated to permit troops to be
massed in body and exercised in ma
neuvers, particularly In marching.
Such exercise during the summer
just past has been of Incalculable
benefit to the army and should un
dcr no circumstances be discontin
ued. If on these practice marches
nnd In these maneuvers elderly offi
cers prove unable to bear the strain,
""v Riiuiiiu oe retired at once, ror
he fact Is conclusive as to their un
fitness for war; that is, for the only
purpose because of which they should
be allowed to stay in the service.
It Is a real misfortune to have scoreB
of small company or regimental
posts scattered throughout "the coun
try; the army should be gathered in
a few brigade or division posts; and
the generals should be practiced In
handling the men in masses. Neg
lect to preside for all of this means
to incur the risk of future disaster
and disgrace.
The readiness and efficiency of
both the army and navy in dealing
with the recent sudden crisis ,ln Cu
ba illustrate afresh their value to
the nation. This readiness and ef
ficiency would have been very much
less had it not been for the exist
ence of the general staff In the army
and the general board In the navy;
both are essential to the proper de
velopment and use of our military
forces afloat and ashore. The troops
that were sent to Cuba were handled
flawlessly. It was the swiftest mo
bilization and dispatch of troops over
sea ever accomplished by our gov
ernment. The expedition landed
completely equipped and ready for
Immediate service, several of Its or
ganizations hardly remaining in Ha
vana over nght before spitting up
into dciacments and going to their
several posts. It was a fine demon
stration of the value and efficiency
of the general staff. Similarly, it
was owing in large part to the gen
eral board that the navy was able
at the outset to meet the Cuban cri
sis with such instant efficiency; ship
after ship appearing on the shortest
notice at any threatened point, while
the marine corps in particular per
formed indispensable service. The
army and navy war colleges are of
incalcuable value to the two services,
and they cooperate with constantly
increasing efficiency and importance.
The congress has most wisely pro
vided for a national board for the
promotion of ritle practise. Excel
lent results have already come from
this law, but It does not go far
enough. Our .regular army is so
small that in any great war we
should have to trust mainly to vol
unteers; and in such event these vol
unteers should already know how to
shoot; for if a soldier has the fight
ing edge, and ability to take care of
himself in .the open, his efficiency on
the line of battle is almost directly
proportionate to excellence in mark
manship. We should establish shoot
ing galleries In all the large public
and military schools, should main
tain national target ranges in dif
erent parts of the country, nnd
should in every way encourage the
formation of rifle clubs throughout
all parts of the land. The little re
public of Switzerland offers us an ex
ample In all matters connected with
building up an efficent citizen snidery.

SAX KKAXCISCO TKAIN DELAYED
Through the derailment of the
front part of the engine attached to
the through San Francisco train it
did not arrive until about 1:30 on
Tuesday morning. The accident oc
curred near Tonopah Junction and
was caused apparently by the heavy
snow clogging the frog plates. The
engine .after leaving the rails,
plowed its nose into a ditch before
it wai brought to a halt. After
hard work matters were finally ad
justed and the train proceeded.
