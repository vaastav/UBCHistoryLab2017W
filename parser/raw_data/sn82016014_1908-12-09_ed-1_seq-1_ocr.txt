Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 9. "I am not
going to die. I am going to get well
and live to kill a few more policemen."
That is the assertion of Louis Pratt,
self sty led "Adam God." the religious
fanatic who Is lying in the general hos
pital here seriously wounded in a bat
tle between his followers and the po
lice late yesterday. As a result of the
fight, Pratt's 13-year-old daughter.
Lulu, and Policeman Albert O. Dalbow
are dead and two other policemen are
In a critical condition.
James- Sharp, knokn as Elijah II, and
who was the real head of the little
band of religious enthusiasts, is still at
large. Shortly after the shooting he
walked into a saloon, laid down his
revolver with the remark, "I am satis
fied I give up." As there were no
police present and no one seemed in
clined to take him into custody Sharp
waited a moment then picked up the
weapon, reloaded it and walked out.
He has not been seen since.
Kansas City, Dec. 9. In a battle
between the police and religious fa
natics which began at Fourth and
Main streets at 3:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon and ended at the Missouri
river bank, two persons were killed
and six were Injured. The trouble
came about through the police trying
to break up a religious street meeting,
at which revolvers and knives were
carried by the exhorters.-
Just a few minutes before the
tragedy occurred George M. Holt, a
probation officer, found Mrs. Melissa
Sharp. Mrs. Delia Pratt and the lat
ter's five children singing near Fifth
and Main streets. He asked why the
children were not in school, and was
answered with an insult.
"Do you belong here?" he asked of
one of the women.
"No, we have a houseboat on the
river." she replied.
The fanatics. after a collection
amounting to about $3 or $4 had been
made, started north on Main street
with Mr. Holt following. They went
into what Is known as the Poor Man's
miss-ion, 309 Main street, conducted
by J. C. Creighton and wife. Mr. Holt
then approached J.. A, Sharp, husband
of one of the women, and addressed
him and Louis Pratt, the other's hus
band. Assaulted Holt.
"I am the father of Jesus Christ,"
said Sharp. "I have been sent to re
organize the world. You are no more
than damned sheep. Get out of here.
I am going to preach with my child
ren right in front of that police sta
tion. You'll see what they'll do to me.
Get out!"
With that Sharp drew a big re
volver and struck Mr. Holt over the
head. He left the "mission" with the
fanatics following, all of them but two
having revolver?. Sharp with both re
volvers and knives. The fanatics con
sisted then of Mr. and Mrs. Sharp, Mr.
and Mrs. Pratt and the latter's child
dren. Lulu. 14; Lena, 12; Mary. 11;
Dewey. 8 and Edna 4 years old.
While Mr. Holt hurried into police
headquarters, his head bleeding, the
fanatics ranged along the curb in front
of John Blancon's saloon. 400 Main
street, and the men began to flourish
revolvers and knives and talk in wild
tones about what God had commanded
them to do. While all this was going on
Patrolman Dalbow. who was sent from
the station to see what the trouble was.
walked up to James Sham, who styles
himself as "Adam God." Witnesses say
that Dalbow spoke kindly to the man
and told him he must cease, as a crowd
was gathering.
"I'll Slioot the Sergeant.''
"Do you come as a friend, brother?"
Sharp asked. They shook hands.
"Yes." replied the officer, "the ser
geant wants to see you."
"I am going over and shoot the ser
geant," said Sharp, his wrath rising
again.
Just at that juncture Lieutenant Har
ry E. Sttge. who had followed Dalbow
out of the station, arrived on the scene
and said to Sharp. "Drop that knife."
at the same time drawing a revolver
and pointing it at Sharp.
Then the trouble began in real earn
est. Louis Pratt, who, up to that time,
had stood mute by the curb, a little in
the rear and to one side of Sharp,
raised a revolver which he was carry
ing in his hand and shot at Lieutenant
Steze.
The ball tore through Stege's cloth
ing from the right to the left side
along the chest, taking a chunk out of
the left arm. Stege retreated, shooting,
and a general fusillade was opened on
the police. Pratt shot Dalbow through
the chest, just as he was drawing his
revolver, and one of the women. Mrs.
Sharp, witnesses say, shot him in the
back as he retreated.
Dalbow staggered across the street
south to the door of the emergency
hospital. As he pushed open the
door his revolver fell from his hand.
'I am shot bad," he said to Dr. R. N.
Coffey. The officer caught him and
carried him to a cot in the hospital.
He died in a few minutes without re
gaining consciousness.
The shooting by that time had at
tracted the attention of all the officers
In police headquarters. Sergeant
Patrick Clark, in his shirt sleeves and
unarmed went out and into the thick
est of the fray. The big leader.
Sharp, was tackled by the sergeant
and, though the latter was armed
with both a knife and revolver, the
sergeant went after him with his fists.
Clark was stabbed twice in the face
and as he turned, was shot - through
the shoulder.

PLEASANT WEATHER TODAY.
Mercury Mounts to Fifty Degrees This
Afternoon.
Topeka is enjoying the kind of
weather that is being advertised in
other parts of the country which
boasts that thev are winter resorts, and
that the weather conditions are cure
alls and offer a panacea for every ex
isting malady from gout to smallpox.
To be frank about the matter the of
fering Is .exceptional for this time of
the year for coatless men and shirt
waist women were on the streets dur
ing the noon hour, just as comfortable
like as could be.
An old trapper from up Mission
creek says that this kind of a day is
a "weather breeder" but then he is
hoping for cold weather and snow
covered ground and his hopes may
nave been father to his expression.
The weather bureau man, however,
takes a somewhat similar view and
while he forecasts fair weather for to
night, he also predicts snow or rain
for Thursday. The following were the

HATRED OF DE SAGAN.
Is Charged as Motive of Dc Castellane
by lawyers of Print-ess.
Paris. Dec. 9. French society
crowded the court room in the palace
of justice today to hear M. Julemir,
speaking in the name of the Princess
De Sagan, oppose the suit entered by
Count Boni De Castellane in which he
petitions that the custody of his three
children be given to his mother, the
Marquise De Castellane. When
Princess De Sagan. formerly Miss
Anna Gould, secured a divorce from
the Count De Castellane. custody of
her children was awarded to her.
If M. Bonnet. speaking for the
count, did not sfare Prince De Sagan
a fortnight ago, M. Julemir was no
less denunciatory and bitter in his
characterization on this occasion of
the count. Castellane's sole motive in
entering this suit, .he charged, was
hatred of De Sagan; the very thought
of the prince occupying a place in the
affections of his former wife and
living in the superb mansion on the
avenue Malakoff goaded De Castellane
to fury. The count, said M. Julemir,
did every thing possible to hinder the
marriage of his former wife to De
Sagan and having failed in this, he
was now seeking by every means in
his power to bring discredit upon the
De Sagan household.
CASTRO IN EUROPE.
He Is There to Settle Venezuela's Dif
ferences With the Powers.
Santander, Spain," Dec. 9.- The
Guadeloupe with President Castro on
board came , into Santander -today fly
ing the flag of Venezuela. In addition
to President Castro there were on
board his wife, his sister, Senora Car
denas, two aides and three physicians.
The mystery of the president's trip
to Europe was dispelled very soon af
ter the Guadeloupe dropped anchor. It
was declared that he came to Europe
with the double purpose of being ex
amined by European specialists and
to settle . Venezuela's standing differ
ences with foreign powers. As Pres
ident Castro is his own minister of
foreign affairs, he is confident of be
ing able to conduct the negotiations to
this end to a successful conclusion.
Carmelo Castro, one of the presi
dent's brothers, who recently arrived
in Europe from Caracas by way of
Xew York, had come down to San
tander to meet the president and with
the Venezuelan consul, the port of
ficials and a number of journalists he
boarded the steamer.
President Castro was found in his
cabin shaving. He laughed heartily
at the fantastic rumors regarding his
purpose and plans. The doctors said
that the president's general condition
was excellent. He spent hours every
day promenading the deck and was
the life of the ship. The physicians
explained that Castro desired to con
sult European specialists regarding
the advisability of an operation. He
has been suffering for some years
with a disease that is understood "to be
a tumor of the kidneys. President
Castro in spite of the reports that he
might not be permitted to land in
France, announced that he had started
for Bordeaux and that was where he
was going. His position is that the
French government is aware that he
is going to France with his hands
stretched out In peace. Before he left
Venezuela he made the first advance
by authorizing the return of several
Frenchmen who had been exiled for
political reasons and during the voy
age over he had several long talks
with M. Merelou. the French minister
to Peru who was "a fellow passenger.
He declared specifically to the French
minister that he was ready to make
important concessions in order to re
store amicable relations with France.
M. Merleou assured Castro that he
would suffer no disagreeable incident
on landing at Bordeaux. In a dis
patch from Santander M. Merleou in
formed the French government fully
of the situation.
President Castro, it is said, also ex
pects to arrange the difficulties of his
government with the United States in
cluding the asphalt affair.
President Castro declined to talk
for publication and kept to his cabin.
His wife, however, chatted with the
newspaper men.
NOW IT'S LAND FRAUDS.
Attorney General Thinks There's Been
Illegal Homesteading at La kin.
Laktn. Dec. 9. Some days afro Assistant
Attorney General John S. Dawson was in
Lakin looking up some matters concern
ing the sale of school lands. Since his re
turn to Topeka Attorney General Fred S.
Jackson has filed suits in the Kearny
county district court to recover three
quarter sections of the school land from
J. N. White. L. G. Eyman and T. G.
Ky man. He claims that these men se
cured the land for $1.25 an acre through a
conspiracy formed with certain county of
ficials here and that the land is worth
from $5 to $10 an acre. On account of the
alleged fraud perpetrated in securing the
land so cheaply, the attorney general
wants their deeds to it cancelled, and the
property restored to the state.
MANY GOVERNORS
More Than 30 States Represent
ed by Chief Executives
At the National Conservation
Commission Conference.
THE MINERAL SECTION
Submits a Report Through Sen
ator Flint of California.
Says We Are Wasting a Million
Dollars a Day.
Washington, Dec. 9. The national
conservation commission today began
a conference with the governors of
the different states, with the probable
result that some concrete plan will be
mapped out for the conservation of
the nation's natural resources. More
than 30 states were represented by
their chief executives. Much of the
time at today's session was devoted to
reports on water, forest, land and
mineral resources, these being in the
form of an inventory of resources, a
work in which the commission has
been vigorously engaged since the
White house conference last May.
The report of the commission was
presented by former Governor
Blanchard of Louisiana. Mr. Blanch
ard urged the appointment of a per
manent conservation commission and
said that the investigation of the
country's natural resources had not
been yet thorough enough to afford
an adequate knowledge of how to con
serve them. Our national efficiency
he declared, depends upon our natural
resources and private ownership of
them should be regarded as a public
trust. The responsibility for the pre
servation of the forests, he pointed
out, rests upon the co-operation of
the states and nation.
Senator New-lands of Nevada, spoke
of the Importance of the conservation
commission work and the need for its
permanency with suitable appropria
tions, and upon his motion, seconded
by Senator Smoot of Utah, a com
mittee will be appointed to present
the question to congress.
Mineral Resources.
Senator Flint of California, pre
sented the report' of the mineral sec
tion of the commission.
In submitting the report Senator
Flint made an address in explanation.
He predicted the supplies of high grade
iron ores will be consumed by the mid
dle of the present century, high grade
available coal by the middle of the next
century; copper, lead, zinc and precious
metals by the end of the present cen
tury and phosphate rock, so essential
to soil fertility within 25 yeirs at the
present rate of use and waste. He de
cried wastes of natural resources,
charged that enough natural gas to
light all the large cities of the United
States of over 1,000 population is escap
ing into the atmosphere, and that ap
proximately one million dollars a day is
being wasted in coal mining and other
mineral products. He pointed out that
there are only one trillion, four hun
dred billion tons of easily accessible
available coal for mining under present
conditions, three billion, eight hundred
and forty million tons of high grade
iron ores and 59 billion tons of low
grade iron ores. The American people,
he contended were ready to pay what
ever increase in the cost of the fuel
may be necessary to guarantee safety
to miners and saving of fuel which be
longs to the next generation. The fed
eral government, however, must look to
the states for such protection.
The chief waste in oil supplies, the
senator said, is in their extensive use
for fuel as for locomotives, for which
purpose coal might be substituted, leav
ing the principal use for petroleum in
isolated districts, where there are no
available substitutes.
Discovery of other deposits In the
middle and western states to prolong
the life of - petroleum and natural gas
was indicated, he added.
SHOT IN BACK.
Robert Mason Wounded by Nathan
Chiles.
Robert Mason is in Christ's hospital
dangerously wounded and Nathan
Chiles is in the county jail.
These boys, who with several others
about the same age, were hunting
near Tecumseh when Chiles dis
charged his shot gun into the back of
the other boy. The physicians say
that the boy has little chance of re
covery, and a statement was taken at
the hospital this morning. Mason
claims that he was shot just after an
argument with Chiles, and intimates
that it might not have been ac
cidental. "He- was trying to trip me up while
I was carrying some rabbits," says
Mason, "and I saw him move the
'safety' on his gun. I said, 'be care
ful with that thing,' and he says, 'I'll
just shoot you. And he did."
The boy who did the shooting.
Chiles, claims that the shooting was
entirely accidental.
The entire load of shot, fired at a
range of only a few inches from the
body of the victim, passed through
the hip, breaking off the point of the
pelvic bone and carrying portions of
clothing with the, charge. ... 1

New York. Dec. 9. More than a
score of persons were injured, five of
them seriously . and a hundred more
were thrown into a panic early today
when a bomb was hurled into the air
shaft of the tenement house at 330
West Sixty-third street. The house
was badly wrecked. It was occupied
exclusively by Italians, and it de
veloped that threatening letters had
been received by many of them dur
ing the past few months.
The explosion was terrific. The
concussion shook buildings for brocks
away. Thesldes of the airshaft down
which the bomb was thrown are lined
with sleeping rooms on one side and
bath rooms on the other. Practically
all of those Injured- were asleep in the
bedrooms on the south side. The
bath rooms were wrecked, the water
pipes torn and broken and the whole
building on that side was flooded be
fore the water could be cut off in the
partially wrecked cellar.
Plaster and bricks, mixed with
jagged pieces of glass from the shat
tered windows were hurled into the
sleeping rooms with frightful force
and some of those Injured were
found, half buried . and unconscious
under the debris piled upon their
beds. The roar of the explosion
brought residents into the streets for
blocks around and in a few minutes a
crowd of hundreds of half clad men
and women were gathered in front of
the house.
It was more than an hour before
the excited men and women who
thronged the surrounding streets
could be quieted and induced to re
turn to their homes.

FOR WATERWAYS.
The National Rivers and Har
birs Congress Assembles
In Fifth Annual Session at Na
tional Capital.
NOTABLE GATHERING
Includes Diplomats and Finan
ciers. Address by Vice President Fair
banks and Others.
Washington, Dec. 9. One of the
most notable gatherings ever assem
bled in the history of this country in
the interest of waterway development
was called to order today when the
national rivers and harbors congress
met in fifth annual convention.
The congress is national in its pur
poses, representing all sections and all
waterways and is endeavoring to im
press congress with the necessity of a
comprehensive policy for improving
rivers, canals and harbors of the na
tion. Senators, representatives, diplomats,
captains of finance, governors of many
states, and others high in official life,
were present when Representative Jo
seph E. Ransdell, of Louisiana, presi
dent of the congress, escorted to the
front of the platform, his eminence.
Cardinal Gibbons, whose invocation,
a prayer of thanksgiving to the giver
of all resources, signalized the formal
opening of the convention.
An address by Vice President Chas.
A. Fairbanks followed.
Ambassador James Bryce of Great
Britain told of the waterways of Great
Britain in a notable speech. Others
on the programme today were Judge
George H. Hillyer of Georgia's railway
commission; Samuel Gompers, the la
bor leader; Governor George E. Cham
berlain of Oregon; Seth Low, former
mayor of New York; Governor San
ders of Louisiana; Representative
Champ Clark of Missouri, and Prof.
W. D. Lyman, Whitman college, Wash
ington. Coincident was the first annual con
vention of the woman's national rivers
and harbors congress, which held its
session simultaneously in another hall.
Fairbank's Address.
In extending to the rfvers and har
bors congress a cordial welcome to
the city of Washington, Vice President
Charles W.- Fairbanks said . it was
perfectly obvious that the improve
ment of our waterways had not kept
abreast of our industrial needs and
our national progress. The time has
arrived, he said, when we must give to
the subject of securing adequate
transportation facilities at a minimum
cost intelligent and effective con
sideration. V .
In discussing the cost of improving
the American waterways the vice
president said that as much of the
benefit to be derived from the ex
penditures would be for the future, a
reasonable share of the amount
should be provided for by a bond is
sue, so as justly and equitably to dis
turb the burden among all the
beneficiaries of the expenditures. He
believed that the importance and
magnitude of the work of improving
the waterways were so exceptional in
character as to justify the people in
anticipating future income by a rea
sonable bond issue. The vice presi
dent said that while the work of im
proving river navigation could
not be done all at once, the
rate of progress should be
determined by an enlightened con
sideration of all the facts bearing
upon each project. While there might
be a wide divergence of individual
opinion as to the relative importance
of various projects, he had no doubt
a common ground of action might be
found. The success of so vast an un
dertaking, in his judgment, would de
pend upon the dissemination of
accurate information as to the need
and cost of work and upon the arous
ing of intelligent interest in it among
the people.
Appropriation of $50,000,000.
President Ransdell called the con
gress to order and addressed the dele
gate. The need of some imme
diate legislation looking to the im
provement of the waterways of the
country was the keynote of his ad
dress. Mr. Ransdell asserted that the
time has come for decided action.
"I am convinced," he declared,
"that we should insist in the strongest
manner both in the resolutions of our
convention and elsewhere upon the
prompt passage of a large river and
harbor bill at this session of congress
and upon the committal of congress to
a broad, liberal policy of waterway
improvements and an annual river
and harbor bill carrying not less than
$50,000,000."
He recommended the creation of a
commission of nine members to study
waterways and suggest to congress a
plan for improving them.
James Bryce, the British ambassa
dor, in the course of his address, said
he believed the canals are of the
greatest importance for the carrying
of heavy freight. He said that he be
lieved that far from being hostile to
the railroads they are a positive ad
vantage to them.
"Nature has given you.' concluded
the ambassador, "a larger river sys
tem than exists anywhere else in the
world, except in the tropical forests of
South America, and in considering the
great plans to which your attention is
now being directed you will have the
interest and sympathy of everyone
who feels that this superb gift of
nature ought to be turned to the ut
most advantage for the development
of the unequalled natural resources
which your country possesses."

New York, Dec. 9. Ten of the
eleven teams remaining today in the
six day bicycle race at Madison Square
garden were still maintaining the rec
ord breaking pace which has set a new
mark for almost every hour since the
long contest began. It had been a
trying night filled with prolonged
sprints, and during the early forenoon
the riders contented themselves by
plugging along at what has become
known as an "easy gait." They were
well beyond the best previous record
at the end of the 56th hour, however.
At that time the leaders, Rutt and
Stol, MacFarland and Moran, Hill, and
Demara and Fogler and Lawson had
covered 1,117 miles 9 laps: Walthour
and Root, and Palmer and Walker had
gane 1,117 miles 8 laps; Collins and
Mitten 1.117 miles and 7 laps; Galvln
and Wiley 1.117 miles 6 laps; De
vonitch and Drobach 1,117 miles 4
lapse, and Faber and LaFourcade
1,097 miles 1 lap.
The best previous record for 56
hours was 1,112 miles 7 laps, made by
Miller and Waller in 1899.
The score at 9 o'clock was:
Rutt and Stold, McFarland and
Moran, Fogler and Lawson, Hill and
Demara, 1.134 miles 5 laps: Wal

TAFT AND CANNON MEET
Hold Conference on the Subject of
Tariff Revision.
Washington. Dec. 9. President
Elect Taft and Speaker Cannon today
had a conference of an hour and a
half at the Boardman residence where
Mr. Taft is a guest. At its conclusion
each participant announced that an
arrangement has been made whereby
Mr. Taft was to meet the Republican
members of the house committee on
ways and means tomorrow afternoon
after which a statement would be is
sued. Until this statement is made Mr.
Taft said he and Mr. Cannon had
agreed not to discuss what had taken
place between, them. The apparent
satisfaction ' with which "Mr. yaft ex
plained the situation was taken as an
evidence that matters were very much
to his liking:.- It is known of course
that the subject under discussion be
tween Messrs. Taft and Cannon was
the forthcoming revision of the tariff,
regarding which Mr. Taft has de
clared himself most positively in favor
of a thorough revision.
It is understood that very little was
said concerning the details of the pro
posed tariff legislation, but that the
conversation dealt entirely with the
broad principles involved in that leg
islation. Mr. Taft and the speaker
proceeded npon the express under
standing that they had come together
as the representatives or two co-ordinate
branches of the government
and whatever of difference in details
in the future may develop if any to
day's discussion was on the friendliest
possible basis.
The understanding was so far as
there was any, that the president's
part in the preparation of a new tariff
would be confined to such suggestions
as he might desire to make and he
was assured that while these would be
listened to by the house with every
possible consideration, he was not led
to believe that the house would aban
don its prerogative in the preparation
of the new law. Nor was there any in
dication on Mr. Tart s part that he
would expect or desire it to do ao.
Both agreed that the tariff should be
revised and that the revision should
be along the lines indicated by the
tariff plank of the Republican plat
form. Neither indicated a desire to
depart from protective principles in
the work to come.
When urged for a statement con
cerning the interview Speaker Cannon
replied that owing to the fact that he
had met Mr. Taft at the latter's re
quest he could say nothing.

POUTIGAUJOSSIP
Senator-Elect Glenn Has Some
Reapportionment Plans.
Western Members Will Stand
Solidly for New Measure.
CO UNTIES BACK IN LINE
Everyone Cast More Than Re
quired Number of Totes.
Still Five Have No Representa
tives in House.
Senator-elect W. M. Glenn of Trlb
nue, Greeley county, of the 38th, Du
mont Smith's old district, was in To
peka this week and announced that
he intends to introduce a reapportion
ment bill at the next session that will
affect representative and senatorial
districts in every section of the state.
Senator Glenn was present at the
meeting at Garden City some two
weeks ago at which the western mem
bers of the next legislature held a
caucus and agreed on a reapportion
ment bill. There is no doubt that an
organized and determined effort will
be made by all the western members
to get such a bill through at the next
session.
The state constitution provides that
every county in the state that cast two
hundred votes shall be entitled to a
representative in the legislature. Now
there is not a county in Kansas that
did not cast three hundred votes at
the last election yet Morton, Stanton,
Haskell, Seward and Greeley counties
are without representation in the
house.
The state has a population of 1.
656,000 which would give an average
of 41,400 to each of the forty senator
ial districts in the state. Senator
Glenn has prepared a new apportion
ment of the senatorial districts based
on the proper average of population
and on the natural geographical ar
rangement of counties. The table rep
resents the pains and labor of Senator
Glenn and his friends for several
weeks and a large number of legisla
tors have been consulted in the mat
ter. While there may yet be some
slight changes made in this apportion
ment, and while suggestions from
those interested backed by figures and
logic, are still in order, it Is likely
that the new senatorial districts of
the state will be incorporated in Sena
tor Glenn s measure as the nearest
possible to a practical and fair reap
portionment law.
An idea of the present disproportion
of the present senatorial districts of the
state can be gained from the statement
that the Thirty-ninth district is now
composed of 13 counties with a popu
lation of 81,000 people and the Thirty
eighth with 118 counties has 62.000 pop
ulation, while Washington and Osage
counties, with about 20.000 population
each, have separate senators.
As regards the representative districts
Senator Glenn would have' a represen
tative for each of the 105 counties of
the state and then .divide the 20 addi
tional representatives among the more
populous counties. At present Jefferson
county with" 15,000 population has two
representatives while nine other coun
ties, each with over 20,000 population,
have but one. Leavenworth county with
40,000 population has three representa
tives while Montgomery county with
60,000 people has but two.
Senator Glenn would not give two
representatives to any county that has
not a much larger population than any
county having but one. Jefferson.
Brown, Osage, Marshall, Butler and
Franklin, all counties with about zo,
000 population and now having two rep
resentatives each in the house, could
Justly give up one to each of the five
new representative districts created out
of the counties not now represented
in the house, and Leavenworth could
give to Montgomery the representative
due the latter county.
The state constitution provides that a
reapportionment shall be made every
five years, yet there has not been a
real change of this , kind made since
1891, although there was a slight effort
at reapportionment made In the legis
lature In 1897 and again in 1901. Even
counting these efforts as reapportion
ments it has been over five years since
any change at all has been made.
The reapportionment measure Intro
duced at the laat session was beaten
by the eastern members, but there i
every reason to believe that the west
ern members are well organized for the
effort to get their bill through at the
next session and it does seem that there
is Justice in their demands, especially
as regards the five counties with no
representatives at all. This state of
affairs is clearly beyond the letter and
spirit of the law.
Robt. Loofbourrow, of Neodesha, the
new representative from Wilson county,
was in the state capital today, and in
speaking of legislation that was near
to his heart declared that he would In
troduce a bill at the next session com
pelling all locomotive engines on the
railroads of the state to carry electric
headlights.
Mr. Loofbourrow also declared him
self as strongly in favor of good road
and forestry legislation.
LIVELY BLAZE AT CARBON DALE.

live Business Building.
Carbondale.'Dec. 9. This town had
a bad Are Tuesday which destroyed
five frame business buildings on Main
street. The fire engine failed to work
for a time and good work by the
bucket brigade and stone buildings on
either side checked the flames.

barber shop. Clair Hyatt, In starting
a fire in the stove, used gasoline in
stead of coal oil by mistake. In a
moment the whole shop was ablaze
and the two independent telephone
centrals on the second floor of the
building were forced to make a hasty
exit. The fire spread to a carpenter
shop, then to the barber shop, bowling
alley and livery barn.
