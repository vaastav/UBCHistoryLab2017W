SCiixjL BOOK LAW HOLDS
JUDGE FRAZER SAYS IT IS GOOD.
There Is 'ot An Unconstitutional Point
la It and It Mast Be Ob-yed No Com
fort For the .-school Book Trust
The Decision in Full.
For the past three days the Van Ant-TteTp-Jouniat
Dragg company (co-operative
and profit-sharing unlimited) hits been
proclaiming editorially and in head lints
that Judsrc Frazer of Kosciusko county, a
a republican and an esteemed ex-merabt-r
of the state supreme court, had declared
the new school-book law inoperative and
invalid. With its accustomed effrontery
the Van Antwerp-Journal Bragg company
(co-operative and profit-sharing on
limited) has boldly and baldly lied in its
editorial columns and bead-lines. It has
also Wen injudicious, for with its edito
rials and head-lines it has printed Judge
Frazer's decision, which clearly and une
quivocally upholds the school-book law.
That the public may know the depth and
breadth and length of the book trust's lying
The Sentinel herewith prints Judge Fra
zer's decision in full. If the Van Ant-werp-Jour7trt
Dragg company (co-operative
and profit-sharing unlimited) can get any
comfort out of it, it is welcome. Judge
Frazer says:
"This is an application originally by the
relator Snoke for writ of mandate against
Dlue. trustee of the school township of
Seward, to compel the trustee to make re
quisition upon the county school superin
tendent for certain school-books. The af
fidavit in support of the application shows
that the relator noke is a patron of one
of the public schools of the township, and
a head of a family, citizen, taxpayer and
voter, resident therein, having a child in
attendance as a pupil in one of the schools
thereof ; that he has made demand upon
the trustee, and orlered to pay for
some of the books selected by the
f-tate board of education under the
act of ISO (acts 1M, p. 74), with
a view to the use of euch books by
his child in the public school; that the
trustee refused to supply the books, did not
have them, and declared that he would not
take any measures to procure or tuppiy
them, and that he fails and refuses to make
the necessary certificate to the county
superintendent, as the act requires; and,
for that reason, the latter has made no re
quisition up"n the state superintendent
for any of such books for the people of the
township. It is also shown, intrr alia, by
the a.hdavit, that the state board ot edu
cation l.a du y contracted with the 'Indi
ana school-book co'upany' for said books,
and that the governor has issued his proc
lamation as the act provides, etc.
"The 'Indiana -chooI-book company'
has, upon its petition, without objection,
been admitted as a relator, and has there-
w.ton filed it complaint for mandate !
iiiiisi me uienuant o compel inm to
make the necessary requisition for the
books setting forth its contract with the
state to furnish the school-books and all
the preliminaries thereto required by the
act, the fact of the governor's proclama
tion, and its present readiness, after larga
expense in preparation, to furnish the
books the refusal of the defendant to
make requisition therefor, the demand of
Snoke, etc.
"The return of the alternative writ ad
mits the facts to be set forth above, and al
leges several grounds for the defendant's
refusal to act. The sufficiency of this re
turn is challenged by the separate demur
rers of the relators.
"1. The validity of the act of 1SS9 and
the contract made under its authority are
questioned upon the ground (1) that they
i:npoe without compensation a duty upon
the trustee, which is wholly for the bene
fit of the contractor; (2) that the act i-i
against public policy, as it establishes a
monopoly, and (3) "that it is unconstitu
tional generally. In the absence ot re
strictions to I e found in the constitution
of the United States and of this state, the
legislature of Indiana is untramraeled in
declaring what shall be our public policy.
In a restricted sense, so far as the courts
recognize it, public policy is only law
and the legislature may certainly change
this as well as any other law.
"As to the suggestion of establishing a
monopoly: Sometimes, and on some occa
sions, this word monopoly is regarded as
potent argument. But the courts must not
lose their equilibrium on account of the
employment of epithets, or the misuse of
terms. By the act of the legislature this
contract was open to all the world, uoon
the wide invitation which the most extens
ive public notice of the letting could give.
The lowest bidders obtained it. This
method of letting public contracts for
buildings and other things required by the
public service ha been a po.icy always
approved and reauired by the legislation
and practice of the nation of this state,
perhaps of all the states, as well as by
privip P' vns and corporations, time out
Vin. it invites the fullest possible
competition and is absolutely free
from any odious feature of a mo
nopoly. Ey this method every
Eublic building in the state the state
ou.e, this and all other court-houses, our
prisons and costly benevolent institutions,
and many, if not most, of our school build
ings have been erected and the material
for thern furnished. By this means the
etate contracts, from time to time, for its
large service cf public printing, its blanks
and its stationery. In every such case th i
fucti ssful bidder obtains, much more than
in the cape under consideration, the
exclusive right to perform the Bervice, or
furnish the thing covered by the contract.
Free and full competition comes fefore the
contract is entered into, as it should; but
not afterward, for that would be absurd.
Unless something can be found in the con
stitution, either expressed or fairly im
plied, against this practice, a court should
not and cannot interfere to put a stop to
iL Nothing of the kind has been referred
to in the argument, nor have 1 found any
such thing.
"The defendant is a public officer, and
it has ,'tiways been held in this state that
euch officers hold their places subject to
whatever burdens for the public benefit
the legislature may, in its discretion, im
P"f"e upon them, even without compensa
tion. But in this cape it seems to me that
compensation is provided. For whatever
Service is required of the trustee, he U en
titled to receive a sum per day which is
fixed by law. Our public schools are state
institutions, required by the constitution
to 1 established and maintained. To their
usefulness and efficiency, books as well as
teachers, are deemed essential. Is the
hiring and payment of the teacher a serv
ice merely for the private benefit of th
teacher? Can the trustee decline this
service for that reason? The books, like
the teacher, are needful for the schools,
and that they shall be prcurable at mod
erate prices concerns the public at large,
and if, to this end, the legislature deems it
wise to require some service by a public
officer, I do not think it accurate to aav
that it is not a service for the public which
is required, though incidentally, like the
payment of the teacher, it inures also to the
benefit of the book publisher. It is sim
ply part of the inducement which was in
tended to secure school books to the peo
ple of the state at prices very much les3
than must otherwise be paid.
The return also avers that the
books provided by the contractors are not
equal to the specimen books by which
they are measured in the contract "
in this, to-wit: That they are not so well
made and bound as the" books named in
the act as the standard of comparison.
There are books named in the act, to whic h
reference is thus made. The second sec
tion of the act required that specimen
copies of the various liooks ollered for
selection by the state board of education
should accompany each bid. Whether the
j specimens thus turnished were equal in
j make and binding to the standards named
in the act was a question which it was re
quired the state board should decide, and
this must have been decided in the aliirma
tive before the bid could be accepted or
contract made. This decision having been
made by the board upon which the
law devolved the duty of making
it, is not open to review by the courts,
until it shall bo challenged for fraud.
Thus the specimen books became, by
the contract, the standard of comparison
thcreafttr. Books inferior in any respect
to these would not be such as the contract
requires, and the trustee need not receive
or sell them. But he could hardly assume
in advance mat inferior goods would be
sent to fill his requisition, and, therefore,
refuse to make any requisition at all.
"o. One question still remaining is not
quite so easy of solution. It c oncerns the
paragraph of the return numbered five,
which, stripped cf the immaterial matter,
avers that books of equal excellence, for
the same branches of study, though not
adopted by the county board of education,
which board had never adopted any books
for use in said township, had before been
adopted, and were in use and in full sup
ply in the schools of the township with the
approval of the defendant; that a change
now is not desired or approved by either
the trustee or the patrons of the schools,
and would only impair the efficiency of
the schools, and if the new books were
possessed by Snokc's child, he would not
be permitted to use them in the school
which he attends.
"As to this point the demurrer requires,
in its consideration, an examination of the
act of 188l. Bid it, by its own force, re
quire, in exclusion of others covering the
same studies, the use of books which the
state board might select and contract for?
Be for."! the pas-age of this act power to
adopt text-books to be used in schools in
townships was vtstvd bv law in the county
aboard of education, and the township trus
tees were required, "as nearly as practica
tfc,' to conform to this action ot the
county board. And when the county
board had adapted a text-book, it could
not be changed within six years except by
unanimous vote. I II. S. sec. 4,-lV.) Cities
and incorporated towns were not thus sul
ject to the eontixil of the county loard, but
were und' r theeare of their local officers.
i 1 1. r J'er.-f'f 1 1.T "5 n the absence of action
upon t'ae matter by the county board of
education, it seems to me that the town
ship trustee, by virtue of the general
power conferred on him 1 y sec. 4,414,
Ii. S., had this authority.
But the legislature could, at anv time,
in its discretion, take away ibis authority
of county and local boards or officers by
the express repeal of the law conferring
it, or by implication repeal it by a new
enactment in conflict with it, in which
case the old statute, so far as it migtit be
in conflict with the new one, must be re
garded as no longer in force. ' Kepeal by
implication, however, is not favored, and,
if by fair construction the two statutes can
be harmonized, that must be done, and
both be regarded as in force. The act of
has a repealing clause, but it atlords
us no help whatever, inasmuch as it re
peals only such laws as are in conflict with
its own provisions, which would have
been quite as w ell accomplished without
it.
The inquiry must be whether, and, if at
all, to what extent, the act of 1SSQ is in
consistent with the control of the subject
of text books, which, by pre-exi-ting laws,
as hps been seen, was confined to the local
authorities. By our constitution the sub
ject of an act must be expressed by its
title, and if the body of an act goes beyond
the subject thus expressed, and matters
properly connected therewith, it is set
tled by our decided cases that, so far, the
act is void. In this case the title of the
act is: 'An act to create a board of com
missioners for the purpose of securing for
use in the common schools of the state of
Indiana of a series of text books,' fol
lowing which is an unnecessary enumera
tion of matters merely connected with
the subject thus expressed, but do not
enlarge it. This language gives no idea
of more than a purpose to 'secure' or
obtain the books it does not by any
apt expression even hint that there is any
requirement in the act that such books
shall exclusively be used in the schools.
But I am not sure that provision for the
exclusive use of the books to be secured
may not be properly enough connected
with the subject expressed that, if found
in the body of the act, it should be held to
be valid. I am much inclined to think so,
for reasons which need not le 6tated. But
if this be the subject of doubt, still any
such provision should, according to all
authority, be upheld. uch respect is due
to the legislature that even the court of
last resort may not, upon a doubt, hold an
act of the legislature to be void.
"We must then look to the body of the
act itself, and, if need be, construe it. The
act Is remedial. The mischief was not, I
think, that there was not a uuiforraity of
text books in use throughout the whole
state. Such uniformity in a single school
was, I suppose, generally deemed essential
to even a tolerable efficiency of the school
quite desirable if secured throughout a
townghip, and appreciably so if it covered
a whole county, but it is not recalled as a
part of the history of the times that it was
recognized as a mischief; that control of
the matter had been confided to each
countV, city, town or town.-hip acting
through its local officers, and indepen
dently of all other counties, cities and
towns. There was, in short, no recognized
mischief, in remedy of which it was neces
sary to deprive the local authorities of the
power which they had of determining the
text books which must be used within
their several jurisdictions. We are not
required, therefore, to regard this statute
as intended to remedy that as a mischief,
and put such a construction upon it as
will prevent it.
"What, then, was the mischief? The
cotemporaneous history is almost of to-day.
The act iUe f discloses a part of it. Cer
tain text-liooks were in 'general use so
the act declares (see. 1) and the legisla
ture deemed them entirely satisfactory,
for it names them and makes them the
standard of excellence, to which the books
to le secured by virtue of the act must
conform.'They might have been the very
books thus secured under the act, if their
publishers had oTered to furnish them at
the prices limited by the act. But the then
existing prices that is the mischief which
it is notorious confronted the legislature
and oppressed the people of the state.
These books, it was charged and believed,
were not even sold at the same prices
throughout the state, and further, that the
publishers thereof were in combination
with publishers of other rival scries of
text-books, by which competition was
prevented and exorbitant prices main
tained and exacted. It is cer
tain that this mischief would be amply
remedied by any enactment which would
secure a proper reduction of the prices of
the books then in general, use, or bring
within reach of the people other books of
equal excellence, at satisfactory prices.
Now, to accomplish this, the act, among
other things, requires the state board of
education, by extensive advertisement, to
invite sealed bids from publishers for fur
nishing text-books for use in the public
schools for a period of live years, such
bids to be accompanied by specimen sam
ples of the books offered and the prices
demanded for each. Then the board is
required to examine the specimens, No
bid can be accepted for any book unless
the specimen accompanying it is adjudged
to be of equal merit with the correspondina
book of the series named as being then in
general use. Of bids thus eligible, the
lowest is to be accepted, the merit of the
look considered, provided it does not ex
ceed a price which is fixed as a maximum
by the act itself. A bid being accepted,
then a contract is to be made with the bid
der, binding him to furnish the book or
books, 'to be sold to patrons' of public
schools, for uso therein, at the prices
named in the bid. The state is not to be
come the purchaser of any book, but by
its school officers it is to sell the books to
the people for use in the public schools.
The school trustees are to sell for cash, and
the proceeds are to be returned quarterly
to the contractor. Notice of the quantity
needed for use in the several school cor
porations is to be given by the trustees
thereof by requisition through the county
Superintendent, and the contractor is re
quired to deliver the required books to the
latter officer, from whom the trustees are
required to obtain them for sale. Thu.s the
contractor is to be relieved of the expense
of distribution to purchasers, and making
sales and collections, a devise certainly
well adapted, as was intended, to secure
the lowest jtossible prices. So far it is not
expressly required that these books shall
be exclusively used in the schools, nor can
that requirement be fairly implied. It is
one thing to secure good books at low
prices, and quite a different thing to com
jel their exclusive use in the schoo's. It
is probable, however, that the considera
tion of low prices would, in the end, by its
own force secure the universal adoption of
these books throughout the state in the
absence of -any statute or authority com
pelling it. But it can hardly be doubted
that it was within the power of the legis
lature to adopt these books to the exclu
sion of all others. At any rate, I think of
no sufficient reason for denying that
' power. If this power, as to a county, could
be conferred upon the county board of
education, I know not why the legislature
can not itself exercise the same power as
to the public schools of the whole state, or
confer it uHr the state board of "education.
There are, however, other portions of the
act not yet reviewed which are supposed
to affect the question in hand, and these
must be examined.
"The first section of the act invests the
state board of education with authority in
this language: 'For the purpose of making
a selection or procuring the compilation,
for use in the common schools of the state,
of a series of text-books in the following
branches of study.' It then names the
studies and fixes the standard of merit of
the books, as already stated. This section
does not, in terms, make the power of
selecr ion dependent upon the acceptance
or tender of any bid for the furnishing or
compilation of books. Considered apart
from the other provisions of the act, if this
language, by it3 own force, makes it obliga
tory upon the local school officers to put in
usa in the schools the books 'selected
for use in the schools" by tho state board,
and to exclude other books, then it does,
without doubt, repeal, by implication, the
former laws which gave control of the
matter to local school olficers. The words,
make a selection of text books for use in
the public schools of the state, are net
quite as exact an impression of the idea as
the English language iscapablcof furnish
ing. Books which shall be used in the
public schools, would be mora definite.
Or 'books suitable for use' would have
forbidden the conclusion that it was in
tended to compel the use of the books to
be so selected. A merchant also selects
goods for use by his customers, but this
does not necessarily imply that his custo
mers will or shall purchase or use them.
"But this section may not be construed
apart from its context. Nobody so con
tends, nor would it be claimed that, un
conditionally, it gives to the 6tate board
authority to prescribe the books v hich
shall be used, if no contract for their sup
ply had been made. The whole act must
be considered in construing any part of it
which needs construction, in order that
inconsistencies therein may be avoided,
and all its parts be made to harmonize
with each other. It seems to me that the
last proviso to sec. 7 has an important
bearing upon this question. This is its
language : 'Nothing in this act shad oper
ate to prevent the state board of educa
tion, boards of school trustee., or boards of
school commissioners from devising means
for the sa'e, exchange or other
disposition of such books as may be owned
by the pupils of the schools under their
charge at the time of the adoption of books
under the provisions of this act.'
"This is in terms a canon of construc
tion for the whole act. The local boards
are not to be, by anything in the act, pre
vented from making terms for exchanging
old books in use, when new ones shall be
adopted, for the new ones. But if such
olficers or boards have, by force of the act,
lost their former power to adopt books,
and the new ones have been adopted bv
reason of the fact that the state board
has contracted so as to secure them, then
the local authorities are not free to make
terms for exchange of books they
mutt take the new books, nolens
volens and, if they would ex
change at all, it must be upon
6uch terras as the contractors choose
to prescribe. But if the power to
adopt the new books still belongs to the
local officers, then they Are at lib
erty to negotiate for the exchange upon
favorable terms as a condition upon w hich.
they will adopt the new books, and in this
view this proviso becomes a substantial
protection to the people' and not a mere
string of verbiage wholly inefficient for
any useful purpose. Now it seems to mo
that sec. 1, above quoted, ia in perfect
harmony with this proviso thus inter
preted, that the 'section' of books, which
the state board is authorized to make, has
reference w holly to the duty imposed upon
it by Bee. 3, which requires it to examine
the specimen books submitted by bidders,
with a view to ascertaining whether they
reach the standard of merit prescribed in
the firbt "section, and then from anong
such as are selected a3 being up to that stand
ard to contract for such as are cTered at
the lowest price," not above the maximum
fixed by the act, merit being also consid
ered. .
"Thus construed no violence is done to
the language of any part of the statute,
every part and clause of it is given sub
stantial and beneficial effect, in harmony
with every other part, and a remedy for
the old mischief is fully attained. This is
in harmony also with the immemorial
policy of our state, which, as far as may be
found convenient, confers upon local and
municipal authorities the control, in ad
ministration of local concerns. The wis
dom of this policy in general has, so far as
I know, never been controverted in Indi
ana, and without now calling in question
the power ot the legislature to change it,
as to the matter of public schools, I do not
think the courts can be justified in assum
ing that legislation wa3 intended to in
fringe upon it, unless the language em
ployed, and a mischief existing and at
tempted to be cured, indicate clearly and
affirmatively tint such a result was really
intended.
"If it M ere conceded thst the language
of the statute is equally susceptible of a
construction which would make the use
of the new books in our schools compul
sory which I do not think the result
would be the same. Nothing is better
settled by all authority than that in that
caso the interpretation must be adopted,
'which will bring the new statute into
agreement with the old one, avo.d repeal
by irnpl cation, and give eflect to the prin
ciple that repeal by implication shall not
be favored.
"It follows as a conclusion that the fifth
paragraph of the return is good upon
demurrer. If other books had been
adopted and in uso in the schools of the
township, with the approval of the defend
ant, tiie statute does not require hint to
supersede them. The new books could
not at present be used in the schools of the
township, and, inasmuch as the duty of
the defendant is only to provide them 'for
use in the schools,' he has not failed in its
performance."
JUDGE FRAZEK'S DECISION.
The Scliool-IJook Company Xot a Monopoly -Iii
Law vtand.
Indiana; olis 'ews.
The decision of Judge Frazer of Kosci
usko county on the school-book question
leaves the ring of rascals, whose plunder
ing this law choked olf, cold comfort. The
decision affirms the constitutionality of the
law, and not only this, but oilers with it
an obiter dictum that the legislature could
make the law compulsory where it
did not. It brushes aside the
whimper which the corruptionists set up,
that the public officers could not be com
pelled to wait on the people in supplying
thern with school books. It a'so makes an
end of tne imbecile chatter about the pres
ent supply being a monopoly, and, m so
doing, it speaks of the scoundrelism of the
old rinir in its supply of books to the peo
ple. As to compulsion, the iudge holds
that the present law does not declare this,
leaving this point open to the local
authorities. But as the law imposes
a standard as to certain books both in
quality and price,; it would certainly
limit the local 'authorities in that
regard. They couldlnot buy poorer nor
more expensive books. We mav expect a
final clearing up of the question from the
supreme court, and then'if there has been
a loop-hole left in the present law, the
people will stop it up at the next legisla
ture. The school book plunderers are
going to be driven out of Indiana, bag and
bageasre. They may just as well make up
their minds to that. And it is the begin
ning of their exodus from other states;
which is why they are fighting so desper
ately here with their suborned newspa
pers and anonymous lying circulars.
Good Common ene.
Terre Haute Express. J
Judge Frazer of Warsaw has decided that
the school book law is constitutional ; that
additional duties can be imposed on trustees
without providing compensation therefor; that
the state may prescribe what books shall be
used in the common schools, but that "where
the schools were supplied with a tuflicient
number of hooks for the use of the pupils
therein, which were in all respects equal to the
new Beries, and satisfactory to pupils, patrons
and teachers, and their use approved by the
trustee, the law does not require him to certify
the number of books required for use to the
county superintendent." This would seem to
he trood common (tense as well as xool law.
That the pupils, patrons and teachers were
desirous of using the new and cheaper books is
no longer disputed, except by the paid agents
of the old book trust fraud.
SCHOOL BOOKS IN MONTGOMERY.
A Trust Agent Predicts the Benton County
Dec on Good LfTecisof the Law.
To TnE Editor Sir: On Nov. 9 a prom
inent book agent of Crawfordsviile in
formed a prominent citizen of this place
that a decision was soon to be made
against the Indiana school law and gave to
our citizen the substance of the Benton
county decision a3 it was afterward ren
dered. This same agent proposed to the
Waynetown gentleman that, if he would
assist them (meaning the firm of which he
was azent) to get rid of the Indiana
school books, said Waynetown man would
be handsomely provided for and given a
lucrative business. We send this because
it supports the charges made by The
Sentinel. It would be interesting to know
how this Crawfordsviile book agent knew,
before hand, what would be the decision
of the Benton county judge.
There has been no complaint about the
new books, except by one poor, illiterate,
sore-eyed pauper, who wanted the town
ship to pay the robber prices rather than
have his children taught inthe new books.
Outside of paid agent, there is nowhere in
te county any complaint against the new
books, except from the pauper element,
which depends upon the trustees cf the
several townships to buy books for their
children. Marked copies of the Indianap
olis Journal are being sent to prominent
teachers in this locality.
One effect of the echool-look law is al
ready apparent. In spite of the eflorts of
the octopus, assisted by three of Mont
gomery county's republican trustees,
Montgomery county ha to-day 259 more
pupi.fi in her schools than in any year un
der the high-priced book system. The
Union township trustee advised his teach
ers not to use the new books, but after two
or three of his teachers found they had to
either teach the new books or lose their
licenses, there has been no more trouble
in Union township, and that tool of Van
Antwerp, Bragg & Co. et al. will be com
pelled by the patrons of his schools to give
a better showing of his school than he has
ever been able to do before. .
Fuily 95 per cent of the children of
school asre in Montgomery county are now
in school. Such has never been before
known in the history of the county.

THE BEEF BOYCOTT.
Witnesses Tell How the CMcngo Crowd
Control ed 111 ng.
Washington, Dec. 9. The investigation
of the dressed beef business was resumed
this morning by Senator Vest's social
committee in the rooms of the senate com
mittee on commerce. Senators Vest, Coke
and Farwell were present and conducted
the examination of witnesses. Dr. Charles
B. Purvis, surgeon-in-chief of the Freed
mans' hospital, was the first witness ex
amined, lie makes contracts for supplies.
This year Armour & Co. have the contract.
Last vear. he said, presumably. Armour Jc
Co. had the contract, but it was made in
the name of Scannel. The ryt-f was de
livered to the hospital iu wagons of four
dillerent lirms, in terms of about a week
each.
William II. Hoover testified that he is
a butcher in Washington. He aid that
Mr. Carroll told him last spring it would
not be wise for him to bid on government
contracts; for, if the witness or any of his
friends got any of these contracts, the
Chicago beef men would not sell the wit
ness aDy meat and would drive him out of
the market. Witness, however, did bid
and secured some small contracts, where
upon the threats outlined bv Mr. Carroll
were carried into effect. None of the
agents of the Chicago firms Armour ei
Co., Swift & Co. and Nelson Morris would
sell witness meat nor anv of his friends
who tried to purchase for him. Complaint
was made to the Chicago hou.-es direct bv
witnesses through an attorney. Armour
Ä Co., and Nelson Morris answered, ray
ing that they did not countenance any
such proceeding. In order to test the
genuineness of these letters, witness took
a friend and endeavored to buy meat ot
the representatives of these Chicago firms
but could not do so at th market rates.
They asked him two or Ciree times the
regular rates and they have never since
sold him any meat.
Gen. Omohundro, Washington sale-man
for Nelson Morris, was called to the stand.
"You have heard Mr. Hoover's state
ment?" asked Senator Vest.
"Yes, sir."
,:Is it true?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you have instructions to sell to
hira at prices 2 or 3 cents above the mar
ket rates?"
"I did."
"For what reason ?"
"No reason was given."
"Are these instructions now in force?"
"No, sir."
Witness said he furnished meat to the
Hamptoninstituto, Virginia, and to various
government institutions in this city, at
regular intervals. He did not know who
had the contracts; had been told his em
ployer had one, but never seen it.
John Hoover, brother of W. II. Hoover,
confirmed the statement of the latter as
to the representatives of the Chicago deal
ers to sell him (witness) meat, because he
had bought for his brother. This boycott
lasted a month or six weeks. It was lifted
while the committee was in the West pur
suing its investigation.
"Any of them will sell to me now," ho
said.
Santus Authe, a butcher of twenty-fivo
years' experience, accompanied Mr. V. II.
Hoover in his round to the Chicago
dressed beef agents, and confirmed the
latter's testimony of the refusal of the
asrents to sell them meat at all, at tirst. and
afterward only at prices largely above
market rates,
SURPRISED THE GUESSERS.
David J. Brewer ol Knnoi Nominated For
the Suprt-me Court.
"Washington, Dec. 4. The president
to-day surprised the guossers by nomi
nating David J. Drewer of Kansas for the
vacancy in the supreme court, occasioned
by the death of Justice Stanley Matthews.
Judge Brewer is about fifty years old, and a
native of Smyrna, Asia Minor. His father,
the Dev. Josiah Brewer, was a missionary
to that country when the justice was born,
but returned to this country when
David was three years old. The
appointee graduated from Yale col
lege by a strange coincidence
in the same class with Judge Brown ot
Detroit and John Mason Brown of Ken
tucky, both of whom were prominently
named in connection with the appoint
ment. After a year's study of the law in
New York City, Mr. Brewer removed to
Kansas, where he early took a prominent
place in his profession. He served two
terms of six years each on the bench of
the supreme court of that state, and had
entere! upon the third term when Presi
dent Arthur appointed him judge of tiio
Eighth judicial circuit to succeed George
W. McCrary. . Justice Brewer is a nephew
of Justice Stephen J. Field, his mother
having been a member of the famous Field
family.
Voorhees on the Tariff.
Washington, Dec. 5. fn the senat to-day
Mr. Voorhees offered a long presmble and res
olution in reference to tariff taxation, which he
asked to l ave laid upon the table for the pres
ent. It declared that all existing' tariü" taxes on
foreign merchandise should be so revised, re
pealed, or amended, as to provide: (1) For
the collection of asuflicient amount of revenue.
to pay the expenses of the government, eco
nomically administered; the principal aud in
terest of the publie debt as they fall due, and
liberal pensions: but not a dollar more. ('')
For the taxation of all articles of luxury at t he
highest practicable rates, and for the reduction
of taxes on all necessaries of civilized
life, 6uch as salt, sugar, woolen goods, iron,
steel and other staple commodities to the low
est possible rates consistent with a thrift' for
revenue for nothing but revenue. (.') For
the curtailment and overthrow, as far as possi
ble, of all monopolies in trade by the enlarge
ment of the free list to the full extent that the
same can be done without impairing and en
dangering the necessary revenues of the pov
ernment, having in view at al times and under
all circumstances, a liberal policy of trade with
the people of foreign countries, and the estab
lishment of equal and exact justice amongst our
own citizens, with exclusive privileges to none.
Mr. Voorhees will hereafter call up the resolu
tion and address the senate upon it, .

l.cans Fail to Toot the Tin Horn or
Wade Through the Mnd.
The irrepressible Baby McKee was in all his
glory at the Union station at noon Saturday.
The strangers in the waiting-room did not
recoenize this precocious youngster until iu
grandfather fathered it in Lis anus and paced
Hirouirh the lar'e room to the private carriaes
waitiii;,' in the court-j ard. There was no crowd
at the ttntion when the train bearing the presi
dent, and party pulled in at 1-' :"(, and no
demonstration wn made by the few people
that were there. The train was a special one
on the l'an-Hand'e known as No. 21.
It consisted of but two cars one a combina
tion bairaire-Citr and the other a director's car.
It came direct from Pittsburg, making but two
st' P-i. At Richmond the presideut spoke a
few words to the lonrcers about the train.
When the train reached the city the lirst per
son to get oil was the president's va'et, Charles
linier. He busied himself looking after the
bai'ease, while a (rroup of colored men azed
at h'.in with open-mouthed admiration.
Stjn-in-I.aw McKee, wife and baby and Messrs.
William Wallace and Theodore Haut;hey greet
ed the president a he came through the gates.
Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Ciarkson followed the presi
dent, while Private ccy. Halford and Russell
JIarrisou brought up the r ar. Miss Wana
maker decided at a late hour not to
make the trip. Mr. McKee formally
invited the party to bee. .nie lin cuests while it
the city. The president smiiincly accepted,
but Mrs. Ciarkson laughinirly replied that then
would be too many in the lamiiy and that her
self and hushand would have to decliue tht
kind invitation.
The presiiiei;t, Mr. arid Mrs. Robert McKee
and the baby were- bundled into the family
carriage of tne McKees arid driven to their res
idence, No. 418 N. ler-iiies-ee-st. The remain
der of the party took carnages for the New
Penison, where lunch had Leen prepared for
them. Lat-r in the afternoon they were driven
to the McKee residetice. There were few
callers during the day Riid the party returned
to the hotel iu the evening.
The nervous 'Lige wan iered about the hotel
corridors and shooK hnnds with runny of his
edd friends. He and Atty.-Gen. MicheDer were
in dt-ep consultation for a short time. The
erst ashist&nt postmaster-general was intro
duced to a number of local republicans, and
chattel with them n few minutes before retir
ing to his rooms. He is a well-hui.t man, simi
lar in cut to bruce Carr. Mr. Halford told a
reporter that the trip had been
unusually quiet. The rcrty will attend
services at the First presbyterian

ably receive personal frier.ds of the president
in the afternoon, leaving this evening at niid

Richmond, Dec. S. pecial.1 When the
train having on board President Harrison and
pitrty pulied into the depot yesterday therA
were not a hundred people present to greet
him, although his comin had been heralded
by the newspapers. There were positively na
local politicians present, and not a cheer waa
given. The president appeared en the plat
form of the car without being called and vai
evidently disappointed at not finding a great
crowd to greet him at thi first towu in Indiana,
and it the banner republican city ot the state,
too. He twirled a piece of paper in his hand,
on which Mere written some notes, but he did
not use them, as no one cal'ed for a speech,
lie, however, asked to be excused from making
one. It was a forlorn spectacle, but he might
have expected as much, as he has j;iven Rich
mond the go-by, except in the appointment ot
two negroes to in!nor ofiires at Washington,
and the political workers are exceedingly 6ore.
Prince Rus came over from Indianapolis early
