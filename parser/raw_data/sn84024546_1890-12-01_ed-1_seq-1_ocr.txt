LODGE HAS AN ASTMMjnGRATIOH BILL BEADT
IFnOM A STAFF COKBESrOXDEST.l
Washington, Nov. SO. At high noon
to-morrow Mr. Speaker Heed's big bulk will
roll into tbe chair, liis little gavel will fall
on the sounding board of bis dest, tbe chap
lain will offer up a fervent petition for tbe
preservation of ihe health and morals of the
members duriug the session about to begin,
and with proceedings somewhat similar in
the Senate, the short sitting of the Fifty
first Congress will be in full blast.
There will be tbe President's message,
and at this juncture of political affairs a
good deal of curiosity is manifested to know
what His Excellency will have to say. Or
dinarily a message at this lime would be of
little moment, but in view of the revolution
in party politics, it is in order that there
should be something vigorous, something
that will strike a "keynote" as it were.
A Strong Reason for Caution.
Again, if, as it is suspected, the 1'resident
Is a candidate for re-election, he will have
to exercise a good deal of cunning to avoid
giving some other candidate more of a boom
than he does himself. The message, I am
sorry to say, is not available at this writing.
It is well known that there is always a
scheme cooking to steal these messages and
publish tbem in advance, and therefore of
late years messages have been read lrom the
manuscript and only put in print when it is
too late lor the burglars of the press who
look upon all such things as their legiti
mate prey.
The messare of to-morrow lias only this
evening been sent to tbe printer, and it
will be carefully watched until it is in type,
which will not be before to-morrow morning,
as only two or three compositors will be
,. . , i 1- :. . .1... ...........
allowed to work, on ll. .n.a w kuc lajuicuus
of the message tbey can only be surmised
from tbe course that has been pur
sued by the administration on important
measures and from things that have been
let Crop from time to time by those who are
near to the person of the President and his
advisers.
"Will Stand by the aiclvinley Hill.
The paper is expected to be a very vigor
ous one for so cautious and unexcitablc a
man as Harrison. It is said that it will
contain a stout affirmation of the principles
exemplified in the McKinley bill, and an
appeal to the Republicans of tbe House and
Senate to stand by it and retrace not a sin
gle step.
Of course it will throw out some sugges
tions in regard to the passage of an appor
tionment bill on the basis of the new cen
sus, and it was decided at the last Cabinet
meeting, so it is said, that the passage of a
federal elections hill should be urged that
would tend to ensure to the proscribed
people of the South the privilege of the
ballot box.
Though Mr.Harnson was slow to adopt the
reciprocity theories of Mr. Blaine, it is
thought that he will have something to say
in favor oi all legislation tending to pro
mote closer relations with tbe sister Repub
lics of the South America, and in connec
tion with this the passage of the steamship
subsidy Lills.as they are called.
The Vexed Question of Silver.
The great sticking point in the construc
tion of the message has been the silver
problem. It is well known that the Presi
dent is not one of the extreme silver advo
cates, being rather inclined to take the
Sherman "Wall street view of things, but
the condition of the finances of the country,
notwithstanding the passage and operation
of the bullion purchase bill, has made the
situation much more difficult, and the Presi
dent has been conlronted with the most
vexing quandary of his administration.
The stringency of tbe money market has
brought the silver men to the front in force
and more aggressive than ever in their fight
for free coinage. TJp to the last moment
the matter was discussed by the President
with his advisers, and it is probable that
the message will either contain no reference
to the silver matter at all or that it will
recommend a farther trial of the present
bill which, it was expected, would give the
money market all the relief required.
Impossible to Suit Them AIL
But it is well known that the bill now in
operation was not at all satisfactory to the
silver men, and that they accepted it merely
because tbey thought it tbe best they could
get at the time. It will be remembered that
a free coinage amendment to the silver bill
passed the Senate and was killed by a small
majority in the House.
This was accomplished by the efforts of
Speaker Heed, more than through any other
influence, and it is predicted that the
Speaker will again array himself on the
same side of the question. But since that
the eventful elections have occurred which
will be likely to temper the domineering
moods of the burly Speaker.
The Farmers' Alliance has'shown alarm
ing strength and the tendency will be to en-
act legislation that will please this crowing
"lenient and not leave it all to the next
inse with its bis Democratic majority. It
lieved the President will r commend a
r trial o! the present silver bill and
ose who believe with him will do all
n to block the way to any further
lislation by keeping the elections
and apportionment bills in the way until it
is too late for the free coinage bill.
Strength of tho Free Coinage Idea
It is almost certain, however, that the
friends of tree coinage will Tduster enough
strength to suspend the rules, it necessary,
and to pass a bill. In view or the virtual
certainty of such a result some think that
tbe President may have been led to modify
his views at the last moment and to ignore
the question altogether
The only legislation of importance to
Pennsylvania now on the books in Congress
is the raid claims bill, which has been con
sidered favorably by the committee having
it in charge. Looking at the mass of bills
which must almost of necessity be enacted
into laws it must appear that this bill has
little or no chance at this session, and in the
next Congress, when each party will strive
to make a record for economy, the chance
will be still less.
A good deal of this session will be enliv
ened by expectation in regard to the pend
ing Senatorial elections. There is a Sena
torial contest under way in nearly every
St .eof the Union. Oil the 4th or next
March the terms of some 23 Senators expire,
but in many instances the changes can be
predicted now with considerable accuracy.
Their Calling and Election Sore.
It is already certain that Governor Gor
don will succeed Senator Brown, of Georgia,
and tbe Alabama Legislature has just de
cided to return Senator Pugb. The re-election
of Senators Stanford, of California;
Jones, of Arkansas; Piatt, of Connecticut;
Voorhees, of Indiana; Vest, of Missouri,
and Vance, of North Carolina, may be re
garded as certain.
In Colorado Senator Teller is likely to
have a fight on his hands, and in Florida
Senator Call will probably be defeated. It
is set down as a positive prediction in some
quarters that Senator Farwell will not be
re-elected, even if the Illinois Legislature
should be Republican, while if it is Demo
cratic Governor Palmer will surely come to
the Senate. The politics of the successor to
Senator Blair will depend upon the com
plexion of the party that captures the New
Hampshire Legislature, and Senator Bvarts
will be succeeded by a New iTork Democrat
whose name is now in Governor Hill's keep
ing. Senator Mood v's successor will be a Demo
crat, probably Bartlett Trip, of Yankton.
"Wyoming's two new senators have already
been elected, ex-Delegate Carey and Governor
"Warren, hut the Kansas situation will not
be cleared up till next January.
The terms of Senator Jones, of Nevada;
Senator Squire, of "Washington; Senator
Hampton, of South Carolina, who had a
hard fight on his hands. Senator Mitchell, of
Oregon, and Senator Spooner.ol "Wisconsin,
will also expire next spring. Tbe last
named Senator will be succcdcd by a Demo
crat. Lightner.
QUAY NOT TO RESIGN.
THE LATEST STATEMENT REGARDING
THE CHAIRMAN.
Harrison Has Become Reconciled to nim
Because of the Fear That Blaine Would
Gain by a Change l'latt Does Some
Lively Hustling.
rfrECIAt. TELEOKAK TO TIIB BISPATCH.l
"Washington, Nov. 30. Senator Quay
said to-day that he should not resign the
chairmanshin ot the National Republican
Committee, "jnst to please a lot of fellows
who are not Republicans, anyway." Secre
tary Fassett and Senator Quay have had
teveral conferences' durinc the week, the
Tcsulc of which will be the bearing of the
message to Mr. Clarkson at Asheville, that
he will have to remain vice chairman of the
National Republican Committee and will
not be able to use the machinery of that
body tor General Alger's Presidental aspira
tions. Since he came to "Washington last
"Wednesday, Fassett has been busy all the
time. There has been a stron? influence at
work to get Mr. Quay out of the Chairman
ship of the National Republican Commit
tee. Ex-Senator Thomas C. Piatt did not
want this to succeed, although he and Gen
eral Alger are closely connected in busi
ness. He sent Mr. Fassett to see if the
movement conld not be defeated. Mr. Fas
sett dined with the President on Thanks
givinc Day, and there discussed the ques
tion ol Quay's retirement. The President
rather favored it. Senator Fassett also di-s-covered
that Speaker Reed was advocating
the abdication of Quay, aud was displaying
a good deal of vindictiveness in the matter.
Mr. Reed has been down on Quay ever since
the Pennsylvania Senator prevented the
passage of the fnrce bill last summer.
Yhen Mr. Quay got back last Friday he
was told of the situation, and Mr. Piatt
was at once sent for. He arrived late on
Friday night.
On Saturday he had a preliminary talk
with Senator Fassett. He then visited Mr.
Blaine, who some people think had been
quietly helping the movement to-oust Mr.
Quay. Thence Mr. Piatt went to Secretary
Tracy's, and finally he brought up at the
"White House and remained an hour and a
half. There is good ground for saying that
Mr. Piatt yesterday was all things to all
men, and that he succeeded in reconciling
the President to Senator Quay's remaining
Chairman by representing that it was dan
gerous to begin changing the management
of the National Committee, for Mr. Blaine
was on the watch and would be apt to turn
things to his own advantage. Mr. Ouav's
closest friends say that he does not want to
remain Chairman and that if his enemies
will stop snarling at him he will resign in
the spring.
A CEETD7ICATE UECESSAET
To Emigrate to America If Mr. Lodge is to
Have the Say.
"Washington, Not. 30. Mr. Lodge, of
Massachusetts, will introduce to-morrow in
the house a bill to regulate immigration.
The first section of the bill excludes from
the United States any person who is obnox
ious in any way to the existing laws of the
United States, including what is known as
the "alien contract labor" law. The
main point, however, of the proposed bill is
in the succeeding sections, which require
that every immigrant shall obtama certifi
cate from some consul or diplomatic repre
sentative ot the United States, and that
without such certificate he cannot land in
this country.
The certificate thus required certifies that
the holder is a person of good character, not
obnoxious to any law of tbe United States,
self-supporting, not assisted by charity or
otherwise, and able to read and write his
native language, and to read the Constitu
tion of the United States, either in hiB native
language or in English. To this consular
certificate the law requires that a medical
certificate, testifying to tbe physical and
mental sonndness of tbe holder be ap
pended. .

Land Deal.
rBraCIAI. TKLEOBAJJ TO THX DISPATCH.
Washington, Nov. 30. Ex-Marshal
Lusk, of North Carolina, retired from office
about seven years ago. He hid a little
money when he became Marshal, and added
to it by carefully husbanding his salary.
Upon tbe appointment of b.is successor, he
put all of his money into North Carolina
acres. The result of hi Investment was
that until a short time ago be was "land
poor." His mountainous domain was ex
tensive and picturesque, but it was not pro
ductive, JBut his turn came at last. Van
derbilt, the great paper man, became enam
ored of Lust's acres, and bought the tract
of him at such figures tlfat he cleared about
535,000 on the transaction.
Thesa things were told to a bright young
North Carolina girl, who is employed in
the Department of Justice, and who is a
iriend of Mr. Lusk. She expressed herself
as pleased at Lusk's good fortune, but
wanted to know if Vanderbilt got off with
only 100 acres. She wan asked what she
meant. Her reply' was: "Oh, I am from
that part of the country, and know what
kind of land spreads itself out in those
parts. Why, the usual method of proced
ure down there is for a man who purchases
100 acres from another to stand over the
seller with a shotgun to prevent him from
giving a deed for 120 acres."
THBEE HISTORICAL DESKS.
Captain Bassctt Keeps Their Location Secret
to Ward OffKelio Hunters.
rBPKCIAl. TKLEQKAtt-TO TUB DIS'PATCnl
"Washington, Nov. 30. The furniture
in the Senate and Honsc of Representatives
is renewed so often, especially that of the
House, which has yeomen's service to per
form when the members seek up and down
for something to destroy and maul things
within their reach, that very few desks be
come historical objects. But the Senate is
a bit more courteous toward inanimate
things. Consequently desks in that cham
ber have some show of becoming historical,
but that show is limited. There are really
but three desks in use in the national halls
of legislation that have anything like his
tory clinging aronnd them. They are in
the Senate. "One is the desk that was used
by Henry Clay; another is the desk at
which Daniel Webster sat, and the third
had John C. Calhoun for its owner.
But nobody except the most venerable
Captain Bassett, the Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms
of the Senate, around whom it is
legendary that the Capitol was built, knows
which are those three desks. He has them
marked in some way, and will probably
leave when he dies, a key to the situation,
but he now persistently refuses to tell any
body this secret. He siys that he wanted to
preserve the desks lrom the irrepressible
relic hunters.
A POOR LOCHINVAR

HIS BRIDE AWAY

Marry A ItnnnlngFigliton Horseback
The Lovers Come Out Best and Are
Happily Married.
rFVEClAl. TKLEGKAM TO TUB BISFATCIM
BurFAT.o, Okla., Nov. 30. A shooting
affray, in which a Western Locbinvar and
his stolen bride came out best, is reported
from the Southern part of tbe public land
strip. Mary Carson has been the belle of the
section, and all the young men have
aspired to her hand, but the parents were
cold to ail comers until a wealthy cattle
man named Royson made known bis inten
tion of paying court to the young lady. His
suit was favored by the girl's father and
mother, but the suitor to which the belle
showed preference was a young and hand
some herder who had nothing but monthly
wages on which to live.
The persistent wooing of the cattleman
and the coercion of the parents caused the
lovers much unhappiness. After holding
out against th.- demands of her parents un
til life was made a burden to her,
Mary at last consented to marry Roy
son. All the preparations for a big
wedding were completed, and when the dav
'egrajLtbe'peopie gathered fur,iji!lcx.round.
oust Deiore me nour sei ior ine ceremony,
John Holland, the poor lover, appeared
riding a large horse and leading another.
The prospective husband and the parents of
the girl met him with Irowns, but he was
allowed'to come into thehouse to participate
in the festivities
All went well for a time, but it was soon
noticed that the girl and Holland had dis
appeared, and a search revealed the fact
that both the horses were also gone. A hot
chase was begun, and a large party soon got
on the trail of the fleeing couple. The girl
had dressed herself in a suit of men's
clothes, and was riding astride beside her
lover, both being heavily armed.
A running fight ensued on the plains, in
which old man Carson and one of his herd
ers were slightly shot and Royson had his
horse killed under him. This proceeding
drove back the pursuers, and the couple
rode into Bufialo, where they were made
husband and wife.
NEW FISHERY TROUBLES.
Cuban Vessels Said to ho Violating tho
Marine League Limit.
Punta Goedo, Fla., Nov. 30. News
has just reached here of an outrage com
mitted by Spanish smugglers on the Port
Sanitary Inspector in Charlotte Harbor, Mor
ris Cochran, an appointee of tbe State Board
of Health. He boarded a Spanish schooner,
and when asked to show his papers, the
crew seized him and threw him overboard,
afterward cutting his boat loose. With
much difficulty he reached the shore. Tbe
schooner sailed off, and her name could not
be learned.
The State Health Officer has made an of
ficial complaint to tho Treasury Depart
ment and the Marine Hospital service, be
sides notifying the State Department that
Spanish vessels are continually violating
international laws and treaty obligations by
fishing in Forida waters itiside the Marine
League limit. Cuba has placed a high duty
on American fish, and this, with violations
of the lawj have broken the export fish busi
ness from Key West, which formerly
amounted to $100,000 or more annually.

A THIRD PARTI M0YEMEKT SOT-fcEE
u
(SPECIAL TELEOllAM TO TtlB DISPATCH.! (
Ocala, Fla., Nov. S0.-More thjribalf
of the delegates to the National Contention
of the Farmers' Alliance, which oij?nsDn
Tuesday, have arrived and the town Is
already thronged by these and other
strangers. AU of the national ofisers of
the Alliance are here, and the prelimiaary
caucusslng and canvassing, ,Jhlch
will settle probably tho action
of the convention upon political
subjects, has actively begun. It may be
said without qualification, that the third
party movement will not be indorsed by the
Alliance at tbe coming convention. Tbe
plans or the leaders lie iu a new and different
direction. They propose to keep the
Alliance nominally out of politics, in the
belief that its power will be greatly en
hanced by such a course.
It does not follow that there will Ve' no
third party movement in 18D2. On the con
trary, the prevalent feeling among the
delegates now here is that there will be such
a party and that it will have the full sup
port of the Alliance, although not organized
under its direct auspices.
BLAINE AND CLEVELAND TABOOED.
"Suppose Cleveland and Blaine should be
the rival candidates in 1S02, what would be
the course of the Alliance?" was asked of
a leader. "The Alliance would not sup
port either of them." was the straight, un
hesitating reply. Then came the further
declaration that there would be a third
party in the field, that it would not be.
organized by the Alliance, but that it would
receive the full support of the Alliance if
its candidates and platform were acceptable
to it.
"Blaine cannot possibly get Alliance sup
port," said one man. "He is spattered from
head to foot, and above all things the Alli
ance demands purity in men and measures."
To test the strength of the opposition to
Cleveland, it was suggested that, according
to recent rumor, he was rapidly becoming a
convert to the doctrine of free coinage of
silver, which is one of the Alliance's
pet measures. "That will make no difference
whatever in our opposition to him," replied
one of Colonel Polk's associates. "We
havcinvestigated thoroughly the conduct of
the Treasury Department under Cleveland's
administration, and it was the worst ever
known. Things were done with his ap
proval in defiance of law and right, and no
late repentance could possibly rehabilitate
him in our eyes."
"We shall constantly strive to avoid any
appearance ot arraying the agricultural
against the commercial interests of the
country," said Dr. Macnne, Chief of the"
National Executive Board ot the Alliance.
"That is another reason why the Alliance
should keep out of partisan politics."
what a thied tahty siiould.be.
"If a third party should be formed," said
National Lecturer Terrell, "I hope it will
be dissolved the moment it has accom
nlinhed its obiects. I don't believe in a
permanent third party movement under any,-,
auspices. - AV-Bnomo, oa icwiku w iu
taneonsly under pressing necessity, and
should be abandoned as soon as the desired
aim is gained. If occasion demands its re
organization, it can be revived if the emer
gency is really great enough to justify it."
The coming convention will tackle the
National debt question in a rather startling
way. "Do you know," said one of the
National officers of the Alliance, "that if
one of the big metropolitan dailies should
investigate and make public the acts of
Coneress authorizing the issue of the Gov
ernment bonds now outstanding, that the
premium on those bonds in the
market would disappear within 30
days? We have had attorneys en
gaged upon the matter for five months,
and if we can get it inta court, we have the
assurance of high legal authority that all
outstanding bonds would be declared now
due and payable at par. "We contend that
evcrv payment of a premium on these bonds
by tbe'Governnient has been not only ille
gal, but unnecessary, and that the seuenty
millions thus paid out in interest has been
money thrown away.
TO ENJOIN BOND rREJIITJMS.
"The refunding act of 1871 stipulated that
the bonds issued under it should not be pay
able in advance of the time or limit pre
scribed in the act, unless gold and green
backs should become interchangeable at
face values. We contend that under that
specification the bonds become payable at
any time after the resumption of specie pay
ments. We have accordingly been trying
to secure an injunction against the further
payment of premiums on bonds by tbe Na
tional Treasury."
Powderly has not arrived yet. He has
explained the main features ot'his political
plans to the officers of the Alliance. He
will not ask lor any decisive political
action at this convention. All he will ask for
will be the appointment of a committee to
represent the Alliance at a conference to be
held two or three months hence, at which
delegates from all thef'.reat agricultural and
labor bodies may consider the question of
united political action iu matters where in
terests are identical. Such a committee
may be appointed, but it will probably be
closely restricted in power and discretion.
PRESIDENT POLK KBEES HIS MIND.
President Polk, of North Carolina, said:
"It will be the aim of the National Alli
ance at this meeting to so direct all its la
bors and deliberations that its policy shall
be universally recognized as one of na
tional fraternity and unity. We desire to
make it thoroughly national in its charac
ter. We desire to break down sec
tional lines. We have had enough of
bloody shirt We have had enough of sec
tional animosity on both sides. Prior to
last December, the Alliance was practically
unknown north of the Ohio river, but at the
St. Louis convention we made a grand
break across Mason and Dixon's line."
When asked for an opinion as to the
cause of the result of the recent election,
President Polk said:
"I am morally certain we shall have to look
beyond tne McKinley tariff bill. It was not
that. We must look farther than any and all
of the political anestions which have been ob
scuring the real .issue for nearly 20
years. It was tbe oppression of the
financial system of this country upon tbe
masses ot people. They have just found out
what the matter is. Tbey are thinkers to-day
if they never were before. Tbey have scratched
away all the rubbish of the negfo qnestion, of
the bloody shirt, of the tariff and of tne Fed
eral control of elections, aud they have at last
got down to hard pan.
the money powek.
It's the dollar that is keeping people down
to-day. It is tbe money power the rnle of
plutocracy, and tbe people will have no more
of it. Tbe slogan henceforth is to be financial
reform. The National hanking system must
go. The farmer and laborer most be given a
chance to get what money tbey need upon the
security of their real property a privilege
which is denied them to-uay. Tbe issue
from now on is to be a square one between
thA m&nhnnd of America on one side and tbe
irreat American dollar nn the other. And L
tell yon ncht now that unless leaders of the
great political battles come to recognize the
real issue thero is going to be terrible times in
tbis country.
The people will not suffer tbe real issue to be

New York, Nov. 30. The stay of exe
cution which Lawyer R. J. Haire
succeeded in getting for his client,
murderer Joseph "Wood, the negro,
who was to have been shocked to' death
sometime in the week beginning to-day,
was generally commented on to-dny,and the
lawyer got a good many compliments for
shrewdness. Whether he loses his case on
appeal or not, he has saved Wood from
being tho victim of the second experiment
of electric execution.
Jugiro, the Japanese, who stabbed a man
in the back, will almost certainly be the
next victim of the law. His case has been
appealed to the highest court, and it has
been decided aeainst him. He has no
other chance. He will be brought down
from Sing Sing to-morrow by Warden
Brush, and Recorder Smith will re-sentence
him to death. Under the law the ex
ecution or the sentence cannot take
place in less than four weeks from the
time of the sentence and must not be put off
more than eight weeks. In the cases that
have come before tho Recorder here
tofore he has made the date of executions
early as the law has allowed. There
is no reason to suppose be will not do the
same in this case, and if he does, the mur
derer may be killed before the new year.
Jngiro has been a good prisoner since he

CniCAGO, Nov. 30. Flora and May
Irwin, tho sisters whose specialties and
songs have made them favorites in the City
Directory Company at the Chicago Opera
House.had a narrowescape from being burned
to death this afternoon. While the sisters
were in their dressing-room making up for
their appearance at the matinee Flora had
occasion to use a curling iron that had been
left too long in a hot fire. When she ap
plied it to her hair it set the latter
afire. Thoroughly frightened, she let go of
the iron and it dropped into the folds of lace
that encircled the bodice of her dress. In a
moment the delicate fabric was ablaze.
Miss May Irwin sprang to her sister's
assistance, and, while trying to put the fire
out, the lace on her own dress also became
ignited. The two women tore tho blazing
stuff from their bodies in an effort to keep
the fiame3 from mounting to their laces,

New York, Nov. 30. Two grangers
from near Jackson, Miss., both armed with
big revolvers, were escorted to the Pennsyl

by the police and forwarded to their homes.
They were convinced that they were in luck.
They went to Newark at the invitation of
green goods men, who promised them ten

made by the National Bureau of Engraving
and Printing. They hung around the
Adams House, in Newark, lor three or four
hours on Friday, and were finally picked up
and taken to police headquarters by.a police
sertreant.
When the little game was explained to
them they expressed their thanks and said
that all they wanted was permission to go
home with the big rolls of money which
each bad. They admitted that they in
tended to flood Lower Mississippi "with
cheap, but excellent, money. There is no
law in New Jersey to prohibit carrying con
cealed weapons, or both men would have
been fined heavily.

The Governor-elect is understood to have

PAEKELL ACCOMPLISHED MUCH,

Ruinous Coarse.
THE DECISION MADE EEMJCTAKTIjT
Chicago, Nov. 30. The views of the
Irishmen in America, excepting Timothy
Harrington, were cabled to-night to London.
The following is the document in full:
To Justin McCarthy, M. 1'., Vice Chairman of the
Irish parliamentary 1'arty:
Our sense of the matchless genius of Mr.
Parnell as a leader, of the imperishable serv
ices he has rendered to tho Irish cause, of tbe
courage, integrity and splendid success with
which ho has led our people for ten years, and
thotioof comradeship and personal respect
and affection which for years bonnd us to him,
have made us suspend to tbo latest possible
moment our judgment against his further
leadership. The obligation to express that
jadcnient is to all of us tho most nainfnl dnty
of onr lives. No earthly consideration could
have moved us to onr determination except the
solemn conviction that we are driven tochooso
between Mr. Parnell and the destruction of onr
country's cause.
LAST nOPE COT OFF.
So palnf ally alive were wo to all that might
be involved in the loss of such a leader, that wo
eagerly co-operated with our colleagues In
every effort to retain his influenco in our conn
sols. The manifesto which Sir. Farnell has
jnst issued cuts ns off from the last hopes to
which wo clung. Anxious to avoid words that
missht embitter this controversy, wo shall
not dwell upon the cruel Injustice with which
he treats the members ot the party Iliac
has followed him with a loyalty and
affection snch as no leader ever experienced
before. His recollection of their fealty to him
In many an hour of trial might well have
saved tbem from the impntation tbat any
section of them could have allowed their In
tegrity to be sapped by Liberal wire pullers,
nor would wo do more than enter a protest
against this violation of all constitutional prin
ciple in floating by anticipation tbe decision of
elected representatives of tho people, from
whose votes tbe Chairman of the Parliamentary
party receives his antbority, and resorting to a
vague general appeal over their heads.
ME IMPUTATION AGAINST LIBERALS.
Considerations like theso wo should readily
have waived in tbe interest of national soli
darity; but tbe method in which, ignoring the
origin of tbe present calamitous sitnation, Mr.
Parnell endeavored to fasten the responsibility
for it upon Messrs. Gladstone and Motley, com
pels us to disassociato ourselves In the strong
est manner from an Imputation which we be
lieve to be reckless and unjust.
We view with abhorrence tho attacks that
have been made upon Mr. Parnell by his public
and private enemies under cover of bis present
difficulties. To attacks of this kind, addressed
to a man of a proud and strong spirit, we all at
tribute many of the terrible dangers with which
Ireland is now threatened; and we. fear that
tlicy do the f artber-mlscbiet cfdlvertlnfr tbe
minds of manypop1e'lrototr'aveiIJitionai to
purely personal issues, in natural resentment
of ungenerous attacks on a great leader in an
hour of stress and disaster. But while making
every possible allowance for Mr. Parnell's feel
ing on this score, we consider it
UNJUST TO THE ENGLISH PEOPLE,
and lamentablo from the point of view of inter
national good feeling, to describe as English
wolves, howling for his destrnction. those who
have not been able to bring themselves to tho
same view to which gratitude and the neces
sity for union impelled Mr. Parnell's own col
leagues and countrymen.
1 he plea of 31r. Parnell that Mr. Gladstone's
letter involves a claim to dictate to the Irish
party, and therehystrike at the independence
of that party as a strictly Irish National body,
is one calculated to inspire every Irish Nation
alist with alatm, if that plea were not an
obvious fallacy.
The Irish party was formed for tho purpose
of winning home rule for Ireland. Anyattempt
to divert tbe Irish party from that object in
the interest of English parties would he an In
vasion of tbo independence of the Irish party,
and would, we believe, be repelled by no one
more sternly than by our colleagues and our
selves, who are now in opposition to Mr.
Parnell.
But the very basis of our Independent alli
ance with the Liberal party, is tho adoption by
them of tbe programme for which the Irish
party was formed, and the recognition that it
must be the first tasU of a Liberal cabinet to
realize that programme.
MR. GLADSTONE'S INTENTIONS.
Whatever difference of opinion may exist as
to the haste with which Mr. Gladstone's letter
was communicated to tho public, it was obvi
ously not his hostility to home rule, but hl3
earnest desire to save it from disaster, that
prompted Mr. Giadstono to write his letter.
We deplore that the difficulties of Mr. Glad
stone's position were not frankly recognized by
Mr. Parnell, and that, on the contrary, friendly
private communications communications ob
viously made with a view of smoothing tho
passage of the homo rnle bill have been made
tbe basis of insinuations of treachery to tbe
Irish cause. By his conviction, again and again
expressed, the home rnle, to be effective, must
be such a measure as will satisfy the Irish peo
ple. Mr. Gladstone ii bound to a full and ample
measure of self-governincntto Ireland. Tooffer
any other scheme would not only ho an act of
incredible baseness, hut also of incredible folly;
and we emphatically separate ourselves from
any such charge against Mr. Gladstone.
We think it deplorable that Mr. Morley's sug
gestion that some of the Irish party would co
operate in carrying out tbe programme of a
Liberal Home Rnle party, would be so strange,
ly interpreted by Mr. Parnell.
OFFICE HOLDING.
Every member of tbe Irish party will, of
course, agree with Mr. Parnell tbat the accept
ance by any Nationalist member of office from
an English ministry would be a breach of the
elementary principles upon which our party is
founded; but nobody who knows Mr. Morley's
character will doubt that the suggestion was
made in the honest belief that a Liberal min
istry wonld be helped in the difficult work of
carrying through tbe details of an Irish home
rule bill by the co-operation of Irish colleagues,
and it was not an Insidious attempt on the in
teenty and Independence of the Irish party.
We have now to confront the statement that
Mr. Parnell's leadership opens an impassable
gulf between tbe representatives of Ireland
aud the Liberal party, who have faithfully ob
served their side of tbe agreement as to tbe
National claims of Ireland, and the sitnation is
aegravatcd by tbo deplorable expressions of
ill-will toward the British people who have
again and again, within tbe past five years,
manifested their determination to do justice to
Ireland, and have by their votes paralyzed the
arm of coercion.
BASH AND FATAL COURSE.
In deliberately bringing things to this posi
tion, Mr. Parnell has entered npon a rash and
fatal path, npon which every consideration of
Ireland's safety, as well as of personal honor,
forbid us absolutely to follow him.
In tbe future of a party thus isolated and
discredited, we cannot imagine how any Irish
man can see anything but destrnction of tbe
hopes of self-government, happiness and peace,
which but a few weeks ago weroontbe point
of being rea!ized,for our people, so tried by
many years of sacrifice and suffering.
What Mr. Parnell asks us to do, stripped of
all side issues, is to sacrifice all tbe hopes of an
early settlement of the Irish struggle to his
resolve to maintain bis personal position. We
are driven to choose between onr leader and
onr cause. In that sacred choice we cannot
hesitate.
We lay theso views respectfully before all
oor colleagues of the Irish Parliamentary
party. In the earnest belief that a decisive vote
of their parly mil deliver Ireland from the
fearful anxiety which now overhangs her
people,
APPEAL TO PABNELL.
JjflVo ateconvlnced that a calm but resolute
course of action on our part in this cruel emer
gency will redound to the advantage of our
cause, by furnishing conclusive testimony of
tho capacity of our party and of our people "for
self-eoTerntnent. We cannot relinquish tho
hope tbat in face of such decisive action by tbe
electlvo representatives of tbe Irish people.
Mr. Farneirs sense of patriotism will withhold
him from plunglnc Ireland Into those horrors
ot dissension which bare so often already, in
her tragic and unhappy history, robbed her of
liberty at tbe moment it was within her grasp,
and will save him from undoing In one -passionate
hour the result of ill his incomparable ser
vices to his country.

MORLEY'S REPLY.
HE DENIES THE LEADING STATEMENTS IN
THE MANIFESTO.
No Attempt Was Made to Fetter Parnell's
Actions The Office Proposal Repudi
ated No Conclusions Formed Against
Legislation Mr. Giadstono Defended.
London, Nov. 30. Mr. Morley writes to
the press as follows:
The manifesto of Mr. Parnell contains two or
three statements affecting me which I desire,
withont loss of time, to correct:
First I made no sort of attempt to fetter
Mr. Parnell's action with reference to tbe land
bill. He agreed with mo in all our conversa
tions that the bill ought to be opposed, as
omitting tbe principles of local control and for
other reasons specified in bis speech of April
21. The only qnestion was as to the
form of a motion for the rejection of tbe bill.
I pointed ont to him on April 14. that as many
Liberals objected to the whole principle of the
bill, an amendment stating their reasons wonld
be less suitable than a motion for its rejection
simpliciter. Pa-Jl assented. Twodars later
he explained tq''sms alternative plan lor

Irish party into English politics by means of
office. I made no proposal. J,t was natural
tint in a iree. confidential discussion ot the
Sotsiblo future, I should wish to make sure for
Ir. Gladstone's information that Par
nll still held to his self-denying declaration of
lSiO. His answer to my inquiry was what I
fully anticipated. ... ,
Third Mr. Parnell's account or what passed
on the same occasion on the subject of evicted
tenants on the plan of campaign estates is
wholly incorrect. I observed tbat some direct
action might become necessary. Though I
foresaw difficulties in the way of legislation, I
never said that lor anypf my colleagues had
formed any conclusion against legislation. I
never said or hinted that it would be Impos
oiiitn fnr an Irish Parliament to do anything in
the matter. 1 did say that, whother by direct
or indirect action, evicted tenants eugbt not be
allowed to suffer. As to Tipperary, there is all
the difference between a sensible perception ot
the difficulties and tho despair which Mr. Par
nell ascribes to me.
Mr. Gladstone is well able to deal with his
own share of the manifesto, but I am bound to
savtbaton November 10 I was under the most
distinct impression that Mr. Parnell did not
object to tbe impression thrown ont at haw.
arden a year ago, as subjects for provisional
examination, it thoso suggestions were likely
to make the scheme generally acceptable to
Great Britain.

Edward Meakin, of the Jefferson Branch,

AECHBISHOP WALSH ON PAENELL.
Ho Criticises rnrnell's Breach, of Confidence
With Gladstone.
Dublin, Nov. 30. In an interview,
Archbishop "Walsh, referring to his recent
letter on the Parnell difficulty, says:
The letter was guarded becauso Mr. Parnell
had not then spoken. But now his manifesto
enables me to speak more plainly. Unless Mr.
Parnell clears himself of the charge of immor
ality tbe party taking or retaining him as their
leader will not find tbe support, co-operation or
confidence of the Irish bisXons. Mr. Parnell's
breach of Mr. Gladstone's confidence is blame
able. Archbishop Walsh speaks only of the
moral aspect of the manifesto, saying tbat
he leaves itsjpolitical bearings to the Irish
members.
GLADSTONE SPEAKS AGAIN.
Alliance Between Irish, Nationalists
and
Liberals Will Continue.
London, Nov. 30. Mr. Gladstone, writ
ing to Mr. Mellor, the Liberal candidate at
Bassctlaw, say3:
Mr. Parnell's manifesto has widened the gulf
made by recent disclosures, and ha3 separated
him from tho Liberal party, who have now to
consider the great and noble cause of justice
for Ireland aoart from any individual name.
But I am glad to tbink. so far as appears,
there will not be a severance between us and
the Nationalist party, for Mr. Parnell throws
over his colleagues. He acknowledges In tbem
no right or authority, and goes past the consti
tutional representatives of his country in his
fancied appeal to the nation which had chosen
them to speak its wants and wishes.

tSrSCTAI. TELr.Gr.AM TO TUE DISPATCH.
Baltimore, Nov. 30. Along the line
cf the Monocacy river, skirting the Balti
more and Ohio P.ailroad, a gang of robbers
has been operating for nearly a year. They
not only stole from the company, but held
up foot passengers who came their way.
When booty was scarce they broke into
country stores. All efforts on the part of
the railroad people to capture them had un
til to-day proved unavailing. Detectives
were placed along the line and stationed on
cars, but in some way the highwaymen were
always warned of their coming and got out
of the way. The Baltimore and Ohio de
tectives who had worked on the case knew
the robbers, "but could not get at them.
They had established headquarters on a
little island in the middle of the Monocacy
river, where, provided with boats, they
easily made their escape when an attack was
threatened.
Since last month they have become more
daring than ever, and some ol their esca
pades rival those of the train robbers ou the
Pacific slope. On October 5 tbey held up
William H. Williams, of Harper's Ferry,
near Elliott City, and took all of his money,
his watch and chain, and even all his clothes,
except one shirt and a pair of trousers.
George H. Marshall, of Hagerstown, was
the next victim. After going through him,
they kicked him off a train while it was
passing. Sansdowne. Marshall spentseveral
weeks at the Maryland University Hospital
recovering from injuries received by being
thrown from the train.
robbing cars and stores.
On Friday night, November 21, the band,
robbed a car at Frederick Junction of
enough goods to start a store, and on the
following night they robbed the store of
AVilliam Meyers, of Van Cleeversville, W".
Va., ot S250 worth of goods. It was then
that Policeman Short, of the Southern dis
trict, one ol the pluckiest men on the force,
was detailed to assist the Baltimore and
Ohio detectives in running down the gang.
He unexpectedly came up with them on
Monday morning last on the railroad near
the Washington road. They passed in a
coal hopper train, and when some little dis
tance off they left the train and began to
fire at Short
There were five in the gang, and though
they escaped at tbe time, the officers came
up with them again to-dav on the banks of
the river. They were taken unawares, and
when ordered to surrender three of them,
Michael Worth, Michael Cunningham and
Harry Duvall, obeyed, but tbe other two
pluoged into the river and struck out for
the other shore. The three men caught
were unarmed, but wore stolen clothing and
had a quantity of stolen goods on them.
The two fleeing men each had 38-caliber
Smith & Wesson revolvers and plenty of
ammunition. The detectives couldn't get
across the river, and so deputized Farmer
Best, who mounted a horse and followed the
fugitives. He was armed with a 32-caIiber
pistol and had only a few ballets. As he
ascended, the hill, on the other side of the
river.f he men saw him, and turning quickly
opened fire upon him. Best returned their
fire, and for'a time there was a lively fnsil
ade. About 25 shots were exchanged, when
the men dashed into the woods and disap
peared. MORE OF THE GANG CAPTURED.
The three men who were captured were
taken to Frederick and committed to jail to
await a hearing next week. Last night
Policeman Short and Detective Hutchinson,
while going up the Toad on a Metropolitan
branch train, saw a fire in the woods near
Washington Grove. TJiey left the train at
Gaithersburg, and going back, caught
Harry Hallman, alias Flick. His com
panion, Archer Zepp, alias Woodberry, the
leader of the gang, escaped to 'the woods.
He tried to hold up the officers, and as they
would not have it that way, he ran -and
several shots were fired after him.
Hallman, or Flick, was brought to Balti
more and locked up in tbe Southern Police
Station. He is about 18 years old, and was
formerly an inmate of the House of Refuge.
He talk'ed with little concern about the
deeds of tbe gang, and showed himself a
hardened young rascal. He said he had on
three suits of underclothing which he had
taken in the Van Cleeversville robbery.
The others were older than he. All were
well armed, and he said two pistols were
held at Williams' head when they robbed
him.
Hallman told of several additional
robberies and seemed to take great delight in
having held up the champion roller skater
of the world. The champion had been play
ing in hard luck, and with an old man from
Philadelphia, wag beating his way from St.
Louis. The gang ran across them near
Dabtown and relieved them of everything
they had. The champion roller Bkater told
them that his manager had robbed him, but
the gang wouldn't listen to his plea aud
took what the manager had left.
