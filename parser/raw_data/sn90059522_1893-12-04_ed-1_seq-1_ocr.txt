SLL EYES ARE ON THE HOUSE.
Wilson Bill to Be Introduced
Late This Week.
A BIG SHORTAGE IS CERTAIN,
To Be Partly Made Up by a
Tax Upon Incomes.
WEEK'S FORECAST OF THE HOUSE
Washington, Dec. 3.— lnterest in the
regular session of congress, which con
venes at high noon tomorrow, will cen
ter at the house wing of the capitol,
where the new tariff bill is on the way.
An enormous pressure for legislation of
all kinds, public and private, beneficial
and otherwise, will exist from the first,
but as soon as the desks can be cleared
the tariff bill will have the right of way.
The extraordinary session showed the
purpose not only of eliminating the
silver question, but advancing the tariff
problem four months on the road of so
lution. 'Ihe Wilson bill will be intro
duced in the house the latter part of the
week, probably Thursday. On that day
the ten days allowed by the rule under
which the tariff bill was filed during
the reces, will expire. The McKinley
bill was not reported to the house
until April IS. If the Republicans
attempt to prevent the reporting- of
the bill this week on the ground
that the ten days allowed them should
not be deemed to have begun until the
Democrats ot the committee furnish
the estimates of the -revenue to be de
rived from the bill, these estimates as
yet not having been completed, the
claim can and probably will be set up in
opposition that the order under which
the. Republicans were allowed the ten
days in which to make their report was
A BECKS- ORDER,
and, its terms having been complied
with, the order fails at the openihg of
the regular session and the status quo is
restored. The estimates of the revenue
to be derived from tne tariff bill ase
completed, and will be submitted to
morrow. They show that the deticit in
the revenues on the basis of a govern
mental expenditure of 1550,000,000 a year
will be raised to £05,000,000, wliich might
be raised from increased internal rev
enue taxes or an income tax. It is not
probable that the tax on whisky will
he increased more than 10 cents
per gallon, which will increase the rev
enue from this source 510,000,000. Al
though it was at one time last week
practically decided in an informal way
to impose a tax on the incomes of corpo
rations and legacies, there has been a
change of sentiment, and it is almost
certain that a straight tax on individual
incomes over 85,000 will oe recommend
ed. Even if the Wilson bill is reported
this week, it is not expected debate can
begin until next week. The proceedings
in the house for that week cannot be
accurately forecast. It is expected that
the death of Representative O'Neil, of
Pennsylvania— the father of the house
— wiil be announced immediately after
the convening of congress, and that an
adjournment of both houses will follow,
out of respect to his memory, It may
he, however, that the announcement
..will be withheld until after the recep
tion and reading of
the president's message.
If not, the message will be read on
Tuesday. The Terry bankruptcy bill
has the right of way as soon as the pre
iminaries are over. By the terms of
the order adopted Oct. 19 this measure
must be considered after the morning
hour each legislative day until disposed
of. General debate on this measuer
lasted two weeks, and Representative
Oates will ask that the debate be con
tinued under the five-minute rule. The
bill was fought with persistence during
the extra session, and there is no rea
son to doubt that the fight will con
tinue. The general belief is that it will
hold the right of way until the tariff
bill or something else of more urgent
importance appears to antagonize it. It
may be that the Hawaiian affair will
cut some figure in the proceedings dur
ing the week. A resolution calling for
the papers in the case is almost sure to
be introduced, and it might come up in
still another way if the news from
Hawaii, which is expected via Auckland
on the 7th. should be of a sensational
nature. In addition to the tariff, many
other matters will crowd forward at the
first possible moment for consideration.
Chairman Springer, of the banking and
currency committee, has uuder consid
eration a bill to repeal the
10 I'ER CENT ON STATE RANKS
and depose the national banking sys
tem, lie has not yet worked out all of
It, but he and his friends seek to lint
some other basis ot bank circulation
than national bonds. Mr. Bland, who
has a majority of the coinage commit
tee at his back, will bring forward a
free coinage bill, not with the hope that
it will become a law, but merely with
the intention ot placing congressmen
on record, as all sensible men iv the sil
ver ranks recognize that the free coin
age measure cannot become a law as
long as Mr. Cleveland is in the Whit
house unless they can command a two
thirds majority in each house, and this
is admitted to be out of the ques „on.
The bill making more stringent th
naturalization of foreigners, which was
discussed three days during the extra
session, is also oending,and it is consid
ered among the members that it will
surely pass both houses. Although the
extra session succeeded in getting the
Chinese question out of the way for si
months at least by extending the period
of registration lor that length of time,
it promises to bob up again. It is prob
able that the Chinese do not intend to
register now any more than they did
before.
ALL READY FOR BUSINESS.
No Preliminary Work to Be Done
This Morning.
Washington, Nov. 3.— The extra
session disposed of aii the preliminaries
■___!___ ' - ■ <ea
general-]; necessary at the opening o;
lone sessions, consequently there will
be none of the usual reasons, why con
gress may not begin business*' promptly
upon convening tomorrow. The com
mittees of both the senate and the house,
appointed at the beginning of the
extra session, reported many bills
which are now on the calen
dars of the two houses and in
position to be considered when
it shall be the pleasure of the members
to take them up. There are between
fifty and sixty bills and resolutions on
the calendar, so that congress can be
gin legislating immediately after the
receipt of the president's message if
such course should be deemed desirable.
A large majority of these bills are of
minor importance, and relate to private
pension aud other claims against the
government for small amounts. These
will be disposed of with dispatch in a
majority of instances when taken up.
Many of the resolutions refer to sub
jects which were incidental to the sil
ver repeal bill, and with that measure
out of the way they will in all proba
bility be dropped.
There are, however, a few bills of gen
eral importance, such as Senator Hill's
federal election bill, the bill reported by
Senator Voorhees to increase the cir
culating notes of national banks. Sen
ator Morgan's concurrent resolution for
the appointment of a joint committee of
the two houses to consider financial
questions; Senator Stewart's two reso
lutions, the first for a committee to in
quire if any senators are stockholders in
national banks, and the second relating
to the independence of co-ordinate de
partments of the government; Senator
l'eifer's resolution concerning interstate
commerce, and Senator Palmer's, re
garding pensions to non-residents.
ltis impossible to say which, if any,
of these measures will be taken up
during the first week the session. It
Lt is impossible to say which, if any,
these measures will be taken up
ring the first week of the session. It
is considered probable that none of
them will receive as much attention as
the Hawaiian question, which is not
now before the senate in any shape, but
which is almost sure to be brought
before it in some way before the close
of the week. It is probable that a num
ber of resolutions of inquiry will be in
troduced, asking for all the papers in
the case, including the instructions to
Minister Willis, and there will undoubt
edly be a full discussion of the entire
subject, if not during the present week,
later in the session.
The exact shape in which this subject
will come up for consideration will de
pend somewhat upon the turn of the
president's message bearing upou this
question, Band, also, of course, upon
double appointments in Hawaii, It is
also likely that there will be some ex
ecutive business during the week, as
there will be several recess appoint
ments to office to be confirmed. There
ill probably be very little, if any, busi
ness attempted tomorrow beyond the
receipt of the president's message, and,
it is probable, judging from precedents
and because of the fact that several
senators will be absent, that the senate
ill adjourn Thursday until Monday of
next week.
FEDERAL ELECTIONS.
ho Hill or House Hill Will Pass
Soon.
Washington, Dec. 3.— The bill for
he repeal of the general elections law
is expected to receive the attention of
the senate at an early day during the
session which will begin tomorrow, but
whether the subject will be taken up on
the bill, now on the calendar, which
was introduced by Senator Hill early in
the extra session, and reported by the
judiciary committee, or whether the
senate will elect to wait until the com
mittee can consider and report upon the
fill which passed the house, cannot be
stated. The only material difference
between the two bills is found in the
fact that the Hill bill deals exclusively
with the portions of the election laws
relating to the franchise, all of which is
repealed, while the house bill <*eeks to
accomplish the same purpose, and also
repeals the portion of these laws relat
ing to crimes in connection with the
national elections, and is, therefore,
more sweeping. It is not now believed
hat the subject will give rise to pro
longed debate, but that Republican sen
ators will content themselves with put
ing on record their protests.
RECEIPTS LIGHT.
A Customs Loss in Five Months of
$25,000,000.
W ashington, Dec. 3.— The estimate
of the secretary of the treasury of gov
ernment expenditures and receipts for
the fiscal years of 1594-5 has not yet
been given to the public. It has been
withheld later than usual, possibly be
cause the secretary was desirous of
having the tariff bill take definite
shape, that he might form an idea of
the revenue to be expected from the
proposed law. He has also been hope
ful that times might improve and the
revenues increase, and if this change
had taken place it would also have
been a guide to him. On this
hope he has, however, been disappoint
ed. There has been a constant falling
off in the customs duties paid since las
July, and a big decrease for each month
this year as compared with correspond
ing mouths of last year. There has
been a loss in these five months over
the same months of 1592 amounting in
the aggregate to 525,000.000, and during
the month of November of the present
year the collections were a little over
$10,000,000. as compared with over ?1~,
000,000 for November, 1893.

SAINT PAUL MINN., MONDAY MORNING DECEMBER 4, 1893.
THE POLICY OF PERIER.
IT IS APPROVED AT A COUNCIL OF
THE CABINET.
BCPIY'S CABINET INDORSED.
A Democratic Policy to Be Fol

Schemes Rejected — Mello's

From Peixoto's Squadron.
Paris, Dec. 3.— The declaration of the
policy of the new ministry, which will
be read by Premier Casimir-Perier in
the chamber of deputies tomorrow, was
approved at a cabinet council held to
night. This declaration of policy is
said to be as emphatic as that of the
Dupuy cabinet against an Income tax. a
revision of the constitution, and the

separation of church and state.. The
ministry, however, intends to pursue a
democratic policy, and will agree to the
proposal to establish a superannuation
fund for workmen; but will reject the
Utopian schemes of the Socialists. A
peaceful foreign policy will be pursued.
The election of M. Dupuy to the presi
dency of the chamber of deputies is re
garded as assured.
The Gaulois says that M. Casimir-
Perier is anxious that the public should
know that he alone will be responsible
for the ministry's declaration, and that
neither President Carnot nor any of M.
Casimir-Perier's colleagues will have a
voice therein. M. Dubose, the new
minister of justice, was a great friend
of M. Gambetta. M. Jonnart, the new
minister of works, has had no political
experience, but is a new and untried
man. He is an -ardent protectionist.
M. Marty, the hew minister of com
merce, is also an intense protectionist.
M. Dupuy, it is expected, will be op
posed in his candidacy for the presi
dency of the chamber of deputies by M.
Brisson, who will be supported by all
the radicals aud socialists. The elec
tion for the presidency of the chamber
of deputies, therefore, will afford an ex
cellent opportunity for the government
to connt its partisans. M. Dupuy's vot
ers will be supporters of the govern

ITALY'S NEW CABINET.
List of the Ministers of King

Rome, Dec, 3.— The following min

been formed, and the report has been
confirmed by the afternoon newspapers:
Sgr. Zanardelli, premier and minister of
the interior; Gen. Barataleri, minister

ot public works; Gen. San Marzano,
minister of war; Admiral Raccachi,
minister of marine; Sur. Coccurtu, min

of finance, but has not yet decided. lie

San Marzano had an interview with

sented to accept the portfolio of min
ister of war after a long consultation
with the king. It is expected that the
cabinet will be completed tomorrow,
and that the parliament will be con
voked on Dec. 7. '
London, Dec. 13.— The Rome corre
spondent of the News says the Zanar
della cabinet, although still incomplete,
is bitterly criticised upon all sides. The
papers, both of the Right and Left, de
clare that they are not satisfied with the
composition of the new ministry. Only
a few of the papers maintain reserve on
the subject.
ON A VOLCANO'S VERGE
Is tbe Little Republic of Costa
Rica.
New York, Dec. 3. -The World's
special dispatch from San Jose says:
The arrival of the cruiser San Francisco
in Costa Rican waters has caused no
little comment, and superinduce ithe
belief that the United States is inter
ested in the present political agitation
here. Since the visit of the Kearsarge
in 1875 and the Atlanta last October
(the latter stayed only about three
hours), there have been no United
States war vessels in the Atlantic ports
of Costa Rica. Hence the conclusion
that Mr. Cleveland is more intimately
acquainted with affairs than appears on
the surface. The political situation is
critical. The dictatorship of Senor
Rodquez is likely to produce a revolu
tion, which, added to the already pan
icky condition ot finances, imperils the
welfare, not only of natives, but of for
eign residents, the greater part of whom
are engaged in commercial enterprises,
and. in fact, comprise the backbone of
the nation's credit. GUI

"President Peixotois in good health.
The reported capture of Coritiba is
false. The whole of the state of Par

COMMERCE AMONG STATES
INTERSTATE COMMISSION TAKES A
HAND AT RECOMMENDING.
STARTLING APPEALS DECISION
Which Is Giving the Commission
a Great Deal of Worry— The
Point as to What Constitutes
a Line — Seven Recommenda
tions for Additional Legisla
tion.
Washington, Dec. 2.— The following
isa synopsis of the seventh annual re
port of the Interstate commerce com
mission:
Attention is called to, the peculiar
office of common carriers and the de
pendence of every occupation upon
their facilities ; the right of every per
son to receive just and equal treatment
in all that pertains to public
transportation and the paramount
purpose of regulating enactments to
secure to the people - the actual
enjoyment of this right. There must
be a common public rate, prima facie
just and reasonable, which - measures
the lawful charges of the carrier. The
enactment of the long-and-short-haul
clause was deemed a public necessity.
It is nothing more than an extension to
places of the rule forbidding unjust dis
crimination betweeu persons. The
operation of the long-and-short-haul
provision is stated to have been satis
factory under the construction put upon
it by the commission and accepted gen
erally by the carriers. But the effect of
a decision of the
COURT OF APPEALS
in an lowa case, wherein the word
"line" in the statute was given a
wholly different meaning from that
which the commission had held was the
proper construction, has been startling.
This court decision has been followed
and expanded by other courts. These
decisions hold in effect that one railroad
is a line, and that another road is a dif
ferent line, aud that these railroads
are still another line, and so on; and
that rates on one line are not to be com
pared with rates on another. The com
mission holds that the word "line"
means a physical line, the tracks
of one or more railroads and
that a line may be extended
over other roads by simply con
necting the tracks. It is alleged that
"tramp" vessels on the lakes, operating
under fluctuating rates, prevent the
"regular"lives from publishing through
rates in connection with rail carriers.
But certain methods pursued by the
"regular" lines are as obnoxious as
those of the "tramp" vessels. Further
statements are made with regard to
publication of rates for water and rail
transportation, and recommendation is
made for amendment so as to br'ng
these water carriers under the law.
LEGISLATION RECOMMENDED.
The commission recommends addi
tional legislation on the following sub
jects:
1. With respect to proceedings to en
force the lawful orders of the commis
sion.
2. To give legislative construction to
the word -'line" in the statute.
3. To provide for establishing through
routes and joint through rates.
4. To give the commission power to
prescribe minimum as well as maximum
rates to competitive points.
5. To provide for the adoption of a
uniform freight clas? s Ucalion.
6. To make corporations subject to
the act liable to indictment for viola
tions of the law.
7. To provide a penalty for failure on
the part of carriers to file their annual
reports within a specified time.
The commission also calls the atten
tion of congress to the subjects gen
erally considered In the body of the re
port, and the suggestions therein made,
with a view to further extension of the
act by additional amendments.
BATTLE IN CHIHUAHUA.
Where It Wos Fought, However,
Not Yet __nbwn.
El Paso, Tex., Dec. 3.— Persons who
arrived from Chihuahua this morning
confirm the reports of the revolutionists
of a severe battle between the federal
troops and the insurgents. They have
indisputable proof that last Thursday
morning a number of officers were
brought in from the west to the army
hospital, lt was reported that they were
all cases ot dysentery.butit is positively
known that they nad been shot in a
battle. Where it was fought is not
known. Neither can it be learned how
many officers wero brought in. The re
ports of a continued movement of the
federal troops to the north from Chihua
hua have also been confirmed. Gov.
Ahumada declared again today that the
Times newspaper shall not be circulated
on the Mexican side of the river, but
the threat has not yet been made good.
PRENDERGASI'S TRIAL. j
It Will Begin Today— Prisoner Re

Chicago, Dec. 3.— The trial of the
assassin of Mayor Harrison, Prender
gast, will begin at 10 o'clock tomorrow
before Judge Brentano. Prendergast
was very quiet today, and refused to
leave his cell to talk.
_ "1 have nothing new to say. and I will
not talk over the same 'old thing,"
said he.
Guards will be placed at the foot of
the stairs leading to the court room, and
as soon as the seatiug capacity is ex
hausted no more people will be allowed
to pass up to the second floor, lt is be-*
lieved that at least two weeks will be
required to secure a jury.
Alger Anxious to Aid.
Cleveland.O., Dec. 3.— Gen. Russell
A. Alger, of Detroit, has been in Cleve
land several days in consultation, it is
said, with some of the heaviest stock
holders in the Michigan iron mines. He
is trying to induce them to resume
operations, so that the starving miners
may find employment. Gen. Alger says
that if the men can be given work only
part of the time the state of Michigan
will appropriate money to help them
through the winter. He has met with
little encouragement here, however, the
mine owners seeing no immediate pros-*-'
pect of a market for their ore. *._-■' ■ ':

their satisfaction at the successful re
sults of the first American races and
the brilliant inaugural of the Penon
race course. The crowds were all satis
fied, and the general topic in every cir

track was slow, the weather clear and
cool. There were some tremendous
disappointments as result of climatic
conditions owing to the elevation. Sum

me that the president, by and with the
J. J. VAX ADEN.
advice and consent of the senate, has
appointed me ambassador to Italy.
Since the receipt of your letter I have
given the matter my careful attention,
and, as the result of ray reflections.have
concluded to ask you to express to the
president my decision not to accept the
office tendered me. I must beg that
you will uot infer from this action any
lack of appreciation on my part of the
honor conferred. On the contrary, I
fully comprehend tbe dignity, Impor
tance and responsibility of the position,
aud, having this realization, I may
frankly add that the nomination was
extremely gratifying to me, not in a
personal sense merely.but more particu
larly because of the opportunity af
forded me of representing my country
in such a manner as I hoped might be
satisfactory to the American people
and creditable to the administration.
Among the comments upon my nomina
tion which appealed in the public press,
one charge only needs attention, not
because it was true, but because it was,
and, I suppose, still is.believed by many
persons unfamiliar with the individuals
oncemed and the facts essential to the
formation of an accurate judgment.
The charge was that I received the ap
pointment in return for a contribution
of £50,000 to the Democratic national
campaign fund. While my nomination
was pending in the senate it did not
eem fitting or proper for me to offer
more than an explicit denial. 1 was
aware that, as an interested party, my
statement would have little effect be
yond the limits of my personal acquaint
ances. Now, however, when my action
cannot be fairly attributed to purely
selfish motives, it seems to me that a
repetition of that denial, which I make
without qualification, should be suffi
cient for any honorable man. I
never denied that I contributed
to the campaign fund, not §50,000,
sincerely believing as I did that the con
tinuation of Republican rule would be
not only a hindrance to our progress,
but, in time, a menace to the success of
popular government: and, having large
interests at stake, I was impelled by
patriotic aud unselfish reasons to cham
pion the Democratic cause. I didn't
believe that it should entitle me to any
more consideration than other patriotic
men who championed the Democratic
campaign. I feel confident that the
president, who, in fact, was kind enough
to say to the Democrats of Rhode Isl

and that his personal acquaintance with

dacy solely upon its merits, will bear
me out in this asserticn. On the other
hand, 1 frankly admit that until after
the appointment had been made it
never once occurred to my mind that

CLEVELAND URGES HIM. i
Executive Mansion, 'Washington,
D. C. Nov. 22.— T0 lion. J. J. Van
Alen— My Dea r Sir: The secretary of
state has submitted to me your letter of
the 20th inst., in which you tender your
resignation as ambassador to Italy. 1
hasten to express my earnest wish that
you will reconsider this conclusion.
The sentiments contained in your letter
do credit to your conscience and Ameri
canism, but you must allow me to dis
sent from their application in this case.
I did not select you for nomination to
the Italian mission without satisfying
myself of your entire fitness for
the place. I am now better con
vinced of your fitness thau ever.
You know, and I know, that all the
malignant criticism that has been in
dulged in regarding this appointment
has no justification, and that the decent
people who have doubted the propriety
have been misled or have missed the
actual consideration upon which it
rests. We should not yield to the noise
and clamor which have" arisen from
those conditions. My personal prefer
ence should enter very slightly into
your final determination; but, so far as
I have such preference, it is emphati
cally that you accept the honorable
office conferred upon you and under
take the discharge of its duties. Await
ing your early reply, I am yours sin
cerely. GboVEB Cleveland.
HIS final DECLINATION.
Newport, R. 1., Nov. 25.— T0 the
President— air: I have the, honor to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 22d inst. In reply allow me to
thank you most sincerely for your kind
and flattering letter. For the reasons I
have already stated in my letter to the
secretary of state, which were reached
after long consideration on the subject,
1 feel that I cannot accept the high
office to which 1 nave been appointed.
My only regret in this decision, which I
beg yoii to consider as final, is that it is
contrary to the personal preference
which you so kindly express. But 1
cannot think it would be advisable for
me to invite future misrepresentation
by taking advantage of your generosity.
Again thanking you for your most kind
words, I beg to remain, sir, with much
respect, your obedient servant,
J. J. Van Alen.

But the Anarchists Assemble
Just the Same.

BARCELONA FIENDS EXTOLLED,
London, Dec. 3.— The good or bad
people of London were treated this aft
ernoon to a sight rarely seen in Eng
land. It was little less than anarchy
bidding a bold defiance to the law and
to the authorities, who made a display
of police calculated to strike terror into
the hearts of the evil-minded. And
while this was going on thousands of
law-abiding citizens looked on and won-' .
dered if this were "MerryEngland,*'and
asked each other if the world were not
coming to an end. lt all came about
through the announcement made by the .
anarchists of this metropolis to the et-'
feet that they intended to hold a meet
ing on Trafalgar square, at the head of
Whitehall street, where the government 1
officers are in the main situated and not
far from the residences ot the most'
aristocratic, and within rifle shot of the
palaces of royalty. Such a thing could
not be tolerated, said Right lion. Henry j
Asquith, the secretary of state for
home affairs, when questioned upon that
subject in the house of commons last
week, and he promptly issued
INSTRUCTIONS TO THE police,
orderiug the chief commissioner, Sir,
Edward Bradford, to take the steps!
necessary to prevent the meeting from?
taking place. The anarchists thereupon
declared their intention of holding the
meeting in spite of the authorities. At
first this was looked upon as being only;
an idle threat, but as Sunday drew near
reports reached the chief commissioner,
of police indicating chief commissioner
lolice indicating that the anarchists
really intended to carry out their threat
to meet on Trafalgar square in defiance?
of the authorities, if the latter did not
take most energetic steps to prevent
;e most energetic steps to prevent
them. The anarchists had upon several
previous Sundays held meetings upon
Trafalgar square, and they had been
tolerated by the authorities on the
ground that they were not at all dan
gerous, and that the mere fact of sup
pressing them wculd call call undue
attention to a class of people
whose vaporings were only danger
ous when brought to public notice
by attempts upon the part of
the authorities to prevent them from
airing their wild doctrines, But the at
tention of the house of commons was
called, through the newspapers, to the
fact that tie anarchists, upon the occa
sion of their last meeting in Trafalgar
square, openly advocated a
POLICY OF BLOOD,
and held up for glorification tho dyna
mite outrages at Barcelona, at Mar
seilles and at other places, and
practically urged the anarchists of
England to follow the example of their •
brethren in Spain and France. The
result was that the home secretary did]
not dare to allow any further rope to'
the reds of Loudon, and the police
this afternoon mustered a strong force :
at Trafalgar square, in the Strand ,
and in Cockspur street, while re
serves were stationed in Regent!
street, Waterloo, Charing cross'
road, Northumberland avenue and 1
on the embankment. One would have
Imagined that this display of police
force would have deterred the anarch-'
ists from making any demonstration:"
but they were evidently prepared to do
their utmost to carry out the threat to
meet in Trafalgar square in spite of tho
authorities, for they began to muster at
7 o'clock, though both sides of the
square were black with police. Thia
display of force caused many thousands

people to flock to the neighborhood
of the square, and the front of the na-*
nal gallery was soon so packed with
people that it was utterly impossible
for a vehicle to pass through the crowd
unless assisted by the police. The
gathering of these crowds was just what
the anarchists wanted, and it enable
them to do more towards
SPREADING THEIR LITERATURE,
and thereby ventilating their dynamite
doctrines, than any meeting which they,
could have held upon the square would
have done. Male and female anarchists
mixed among the thousands of people
assembled about the square and began
hawking anarchist literature, which,
owing to the novelty of ttie situation,
found a ready sale among the people
assembled. Copies of the Common
Weal, the organ of the anarchists of
London, found a ready sale in the
crowds, its organ the anarchists
