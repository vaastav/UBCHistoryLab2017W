The Separate School Proposition
Is Upheld.
Supreme Court Decides the Par
sons Case Today.
MUST BE GOOD ONES.
Institutions Shall Be Equal to
' Those for Whites.
Ex-Chief Stahl Wins Liquor Re
plevin Cases.
The supreme court of Kansas today
handed down decisions on the cases
tried at the previous term. The most
important of these decisions is the one
that holds that the cities of Kansas
can maintain separate schools provided
that the schools for the negTO children
'are accessible and as well kept up as
those for the white children.
Another important decision is that in
the Allen county high school case in
which the-tourt held that a majority
of the votes cast for a high school pro
position must consist of a majority of
all the votes cast at that general elec
tion. The Hines vs. Stahl and the Jacobs
bridge cases from Shawnee were de
cided. Judge Dana is affirmed in the
former and reversed in the latter case.
In the batch of decisions handed down
today there are a large number of re
versals from the lower courts, a larger
number than usual.
The following are the more important
cases decided which are of interest to
the state at large:
Powder Law Is Constitutional.
The law requiring coal operators to
sell black powder in packages of VlVz
pounds each to miners is held constitu
tional and not a violation of interstate
commerce by the Kansas supreme
court. In order to test the law J. H.
Williams, superintendent of the Cen
tral Coal and Coke company's mines in
Crawford county, sold powder to miners
In 25 pound packages. He was arrest
ed and fined $50 for the violation of the
law passed in 1907. The case was at
once appealed to the supreme court on
the ground that the restrictions on the
size of the packages was inviolation
of the bill of rights of the state con
stitution. It was also contended that
powder was made in the eastern states
and shipped to Kansas in 25 pound
packages and that any attempt to
regulate the size of these packages
would be a violation of the interstate
commerce law. The supreme court
holds that it was a regulation -for the
protection of the miners that the 12J2
pound package was required by the i
state law and that the state had am
ple authority to make these regulations.
Kansas Can Have Separate Schools.
Cities of Kansas can provide sepa
rate schools for white and negro chil
dren in the grades below the high
school but the schools for negro chil
dren must have equal facilities and be
as easy of aeces as those provided for
the white children. The city of Par
sons built a school for negro children.
It was located in the heart of the
negro district but was surrounded by
railroad tracks. Owing to the large
number of trains operated on these
tracks parents were afraid to send
their children to the school. The
negroes brought an application for a
writ of mandamus to compel the Par
sons board of education to allow
negro children to attend the white
schools. The decision of the court
while not finallv settling the question i ganied this speculation. The presi
in regard to Parsons, sets up the gen- Kent's message served as a helpful
eral proposition that it must be just
as easy for negro children to get to
get to their school building and they
must have equal facilities with the
white children.
Ex-Chief Stahl Need Not Pay.
In the supreme court decision ren
dered by Justice Mason. ex-Chief of
police of Topeka. Frank M. Stahl. is ;
neia not uaDie tor tne value or tne
seizure of intoxicating liquors he had
from Chas. M. Hines while perform
ing his duties as said chief of police.
The owners of the liquor are held
liable for that replivened from the
chief of police. There are seven other
cases of a similar nature in which W.
F. Lake, Geo. Knauer, Frank Keith,
K. S. Lee and K. L. Evans were sued
to recover full value for their goods
seized by the ex-chief of the Topeka
police force and replivened by them.
These are decided in the same matt
er as the Hines case. In these cases
ihe judgment of Judge Dana of the
fc-hawnee district court is affirmed.
In his opinion Justice Mason held
that "intoxicating liquors is not sub
ject to seizure on execution, because
the statute forbids its sale except by
eertain persons for restricted pur
poses, and upon affidavit of the buyer
showing the occasion of his purchase.
Another Shawnee Case.
In the case of the countv commission
ers of Shawnee county vs. Joseph Ja
cobs the supreme court held in the de
cision handed down by Justice Graves
that Jacobs cannot recover damages on
account of an overflow from Bourbony
creek caused by a bridge erected
across said creek by the countv com
missioners of Shawnee county. Jacobs
recovered judgment in the sum of $775
in the Shawnee district court and that
decision is reversed.
The, supreme court holds that "a
county, while engaged in building a
bridge upon a public highway, acts as
a subdivision of the state government
and is not liable for the negligent per
formance of such work unless made so
by statute."
IniIKrtarit High School Decision.
Before the Barnes high school law can
be aJopted in any county a majority
of all the votes cast at the . election
must be cast in favor of the proposi
tion. In 1905 the legislature adopted a
law providing that high schools can be
established and the county can help pay
for their maintenance by a tax levy.
The school must be maintained at a
certain standard and all the children
of the county and city must be admit
ted without tuition.
The supreme court in a decision hand
ed down today holds the law good but
makes certain requirements in the vot
ing before it can be put into effect in
any county.
In Alien county a proposition to
adopt the law and make the city of
Humboldt high school In reality, a
county high school was voted on at
the electon of 1906. In the eelction
4.558 votes were cast. On the propo
sition of adopting the high school law
1,821 persons v oted in favor of it;
1,205 voted against it and 1,532 per
sons who voted at the election failed to
vole on the high school proposition
although they voted on all other mat
ters offered at the election.
While the high school proposition
received a majority of votes cast on
it, it did not receive a majority of
votes cast at the election. The su
preme court holds that the proposition
to adopt the law failed to carry.
This decision will affect the status
of high schools in about forty counties
in the state. In nearly every one of
thse counties oniy about two-thirds of
the people voting at the election voted
on the adoption or rejectoin of the
high school law. While the proposi
tion carried in every instance the fact
that there was not a majority of all
the votes cast in favor of the high
school knocked out the tax levy made
in these counties to help support the
high school in the cities.
The educational commission is
drawing an amendment to the law
which will obviate this difficulty.
A Wyandotte Ouster.
Tha Kansas supreme court today
ousted Frank D. Hutchings, judge of
the circuit court of Wyandotte coun-
It; ? 'T.cJf ,f-..f,i;1f iS
winter. He onalifled in February and
hia court has been doing a rushing
business ever since.
The supreme court holds that the
law creating this court was special
legislation and In violation of the con
stitutional amendment adopted two
years ago. In the general election
last month Hutchings ' was defeated
and a Democrat elected. Hutchings
will be ousted in twenty days and the
new judge will not be allowed to
qualify for the place. The decision
was made on a quo warranto pro
ceeding brought by the attorney gen
eral.
In deciding the case the supreme

UNITED EFFORT.
To Redeem Clricago to Be Led by Rev.
J. Wilbur Chapman.
Chicago. Dec. 12. Chicago is to
have six weeks of revival services be
ginning March 1 next, under the lead
ershiD of the Rev. J. Wilbur Chapman
of Philadelphia, assisted by the min-
Isters and congregations 01 every
Protestant church in the city in con
junction with the laymen's evangelistic
council.
This was decided at a dinner at the
Auditorium hotel last night. when
pastors of 204 churches, who were the
vntictE rf lav-men. sanctioned the
! invitation sent to Dr. Chapman some
time ago. Dr. Chapman was present
at the banquet.
The evangelist and various speakers
last night outlined the . plans tor tne
coming revival. It will not be a one-
man affair, they said, but a general
move me nt. wherein Dr. Chapman, as
sisted by his fifty pastors and workers,
will hold fifty simultaneous meetings
every night' and day for six weeks in
every part of the city.
HELFTuUMESSAGE.
President's Vtterance Gave Impetus
to Speculation.
New York, Dec. 12. The week's
speculation in the stock market has
broadened out so as to embrace de
partments of the list formerly
neglected. Numerous unverified ru
mors of supposed railroad mergers
and new alignments have accom-
factor, by reason of its omissions as
much as by its contents. The gov
ernment report on winter wheat re
lieved some anxietv concerning that
crop. The copper market was called
1 w r 1 1 r and It wa rpnnrtpii - that the
early placing of large orders for steel I tv with its charge of $583 or Cheyenne
products bv the railroads was ex-countv with $349, as well as the oth
pected. Money became firmer and er extreme charges noted above, are
the gold export movements to Paris
was resumed and the speculation was
inclined to look with confidence to the
bridging of the end-year period with
out hurtful stringency.
TUG BOATS TIED UP.
Crews of 23 Strike Against Working
Overtime.
New York, Dec. 12. Because the
New York Central railroad marine
superintendent refused to reinstate a
tug boat crew, he had discharged
when they refused to work a half
hour overtime last night without pay,
the twenty-three tugs of the company
did not move today. The crews of all
these craft, which handle- the com
pany's floats on East and North rivers
and the harbor refused to begin work
this morning and added a further de
mand that they be paid twice a month
instead of monthly as heretofore.
Two hundred men took part in the
strike.
J. D. M'FARLAND BUYS.
Pays Eleven Thousand six Hundred
for Kansas Avenue Property.
J. D. McFarland closed a deal for
the property at 602 Kansas avenue
Friday, paying $11,675 for the two
story brick building and the lot, 19 V
feet in width by 75 feet in depth. The
building is occupied by G. Schmidt as
a tailoring establishment, and was
bought as an investment by Mr. Mc
Farland, from the heirs of the Bodwell
estate.
Ordinance Concerning Downspouts.
An ordinance relating to the condi
tion of eave gutters and down spouts
was referred to the city attorney, the
street commissioner and the city engi
neer last night at the S. & W. commit
tee meeting. The ordinance provided
for the proper draining of eave gutters
and down spouts preventing damage to
walls, foundations and pavements and
for sanitary purposes. There are so
many sewers in the city unable to carry
off the whole surface water that the
ordinance was left to the proper offi
cials in hopes that it might be revised
to prevent the damage" mentioned. There
have been a number of complaints late
ly from the improper draining of such
spouts.
COST OFPRIftlARY
It Falls Below What Had Been
Expected.
Only Little More Than One Hun
dred Thousand Dollars.
A NEED OF CHANGES.
Inequalities Brought to the
Surface This Year.
C. E. Denton, Secretary of State,
Makes Suggestions.
Secretary of State C. E. Denton has
after ten days of hard work compiled
the ta lw of the cost of the pri.
marv election last August by coun-
ties. The secretary sent a list of eight
questions to all the county clerks for
complete information about the cost of
the primary. All but seven out of
105 responded. The total cost was
$101,523 with about $10,000 to ac-'
count for for the seven missing coun
ties. The secretary has compiled in
; x,.-. eririt th. , tVl. at
i "r . 7. ,
the last election, their valuations as
icyuueu uy liio siitm Lajc commission
and other interesting information but
onlv enough is nublisherl in the table
I ,,. ., , Th
to the general public, I will state that
since it became known that I was col
lecting information on the subject I
have received many letters asking
when I would be able to furnish the
figures, nearly everyone who has come
Into the office and many whom I have
met on the street have asked me the
same question, and it is the desire for
this information that has prompted
the news gatherers to ask that I sub
mit at this time that part of my bien
nal report containing it.
"I regret to say that a few county
clerks have not as yet responded to
! my inquiries and a
great many of
them while stating very plainly the
total cost in their counties, have failed
to furnish the information in detail as
asked for and I am therefore unable
in many instances to divide or appor
tion the cost as I should like to have
done. But enough of them are thor
oughly itemized having the cost set
opposite each inquiry concerning the
services performed so that compari
sons can be made with reasonable ac
curacy and it is from such reports that
the following comparisons are made.
purpofIely selected some of those
showing the greatest differences in
charges for a like service performed.
"For the publication of notices of
offices for which candidates were to
be nominated and the notices of can
didates for whom nomination papers
had been filed Wyandotte county
heads the list with a charge of $583,
Cheyene county is next with a charge
or $343, followed by Labette county
with $34 5, Wilson with $339, Neosho
with $306. Barton with $287, Dickin
son with $213.
The other extremes on this particul
ar item are headed by Sedgwick coun
ty with no charge at all for this ser
vice. Then comes Kiowa county with
a charge of $2.75, Norton county with
$10.00, Atchison county $12.00, Doni
phan county $38.00, Pratt county, $41,
Osage county. $51.00.
"In the publication of the aforesaid
notices the size of the county, popu
lation or voting strength has nothing
whatever to do with fixing the cost as
the law provides that such notices
shall be printed for three consecutive
' weeks in the official county paper. So
lit will be seen that if Wyandotte coun-
right there is no reason why Sedg
wick county should perform this ser
vice for nothing at all nor why Kiowa
county should pay the insignificant
sum of $2.75 or Norton county $10.00.
Charge by Sheriffs.
"The next question asked was as to
the charge made by sheriffs for posting
notices in each voting precinct in the
county. In response to this inquiry
Osage county, with 27 precincts, heads
the list with a charge of $142; Saline
county, with 26 precincts, is next with
$116; then comes Nemaha county with
28 precincts, at $100; Sherman county,
16 precincts, $75, Lyon county, 28 pre
cincts, $75. Minimum charges for this
service are reported from Greeley coun
ty, having four precincts. $4.50; Haskell
county, three precincts. $4.80; Bourbon,
26 precincts. $12; Anderson county, 19
precincts, $18; Johnson county. 26 pre
cincts. $22.
"Here it is hard again to reconcile
the figures. Osage county paid $142 for
posting these notices In 27 precincts,
Saline paid $116 for posting these no
tices in 26 precincts while Bourbon hav
ing 26 precincts paid only $12 and John
son with a like number of precincts
paid but $22.
' "In response to the inquiry as to cost
of printing the official primary ballots
and the sample ballots, Leavenworth
county, with a population of 40,000,
heads the list in cost of ballots by
charging $1,366. Wyandotte county is
next with its population of 111.000,
charging for the ballots $955. Reno
county with a population of practical
ly 35.000, charges $952 for ballots while
Montgomery, Shawnee and Sedgwick
having a population of around 60.000
each, charge respectively $807, $700 and
$672 for ballots. These are of course the
highest charges in the state for ballots.
Nevertheless It will not be easy to un
derstand why Leavenworth county with
but a little more than one-third the
population of Wyandotte, should make
a charge for printing ballots of over
50 per cent more, while Reno county
with less than one-third the population
of Wyandotte makes a charge of the
same amount. It would seem from the
returns that the charges made by
Montgomery, Shawnee and Sedgwick
counties were nearly uniform in pro
portion to their population.
"Now taking up the other extreme I
find that Haskell county with a popu
lation of 1.400, charges but $40 for these
ballots. Riley county having a popula
tion of 15.000. or nearly ten times as
many as Haskell, makes a charge of $50
or only $10 more while Wichita county,
whose population is less than one-seventh
that of Riley county, charges Just

BIRTHDAY GIFT OF $100,000
Comes to the Wife or a Poor Cobbler
in Los Angeles.
Los Angeles, Dec. 12. William J.
Perry, a cobbler, working at his trade in
a little 4 by 15 foot hole in the wall at
845 South Main street, has been sud
denly raised -from his humble station
to a position of affluence by the inherit
ance by his wife of $100,000 in dividend
paying stocks, and a promise of $300,000
more on the first of May next.
Mrs. Perry is a sister of Chas. H.
Merry of St. Louis, a wealthy capital
ist and principal stockholder in the
Rail and River Transportation com
pany. Mrs. Perry recently wrote her
brother that she would soon celebrate
her fifty-ninth birthday, and the $100,
000 worth of stock in the transportation
company came as an advance birthday
gift, with a promise of additional for
tune next May.
FIGHT ON THE RULES.
House Republican Insurgents Hold a
Preliminary Conference.
Washington, Dec. 12. The fight for
a revision of the rules of the house of
representatives was inaugurated last
night at a meeting of the socalled "in
surgents," attended by 25 Republican
representatives. Representative Hep
burn of Iowa presided and was auth
orized to draft the proposed amend
ments to- the rules and report to the
organization on Tuesday night.
The "insurgents" considered the va
rious suggestions for more than two
hours.
Those interested have been proceed
ing quietly with their plans- with the
apparent purpose of increasing their
numbers sufficiently to be able to con
trol the situation by joining the Demo
crats in a fight on the rules. The "in
surgents" claim that in the present
congress, they need but 2 7 Republi
cans to join the Democrats in order
to bring about a change in the rules
while in the Sixty-first congress, they
say, they will need but 24 Republican
members. Three of the representatives
present Hepburn, Pollard and Ellis
will not be members of the next
congress.
While several of the insurgents are
for Cannon for speaker they made it
plain they greatly desired a change? in
the rules.
"There were no expressions except
those of friendly feeling for the
speaker," said Mr. Hepburn after the
meeting.
"Nobody said anything against Mr.
Cannon."
He said the general feeling was that
! if under the rules the house must
j have a despotic leader there was no
; one they would rather have than
J "Uncle Joe."
; Several new sugestions, in addi
tion to those already advanced, were
made at the meeting. To increase the
! membership of the rules committee of
' the house has been the most popular
suggestion and in this connection it
has been proposed to have this com
mittee elected by the members of the
house instead of being named by the
speaker.
The election in like manner of a
committee on committees to perform
duties similar to a like body in the
senate, also has been proposed by-
leaders in the movement. Another
plan proposed is to set two Thursdays
apart in each month for the consider
ation of measures on the union calen
dar. None of those present would state
whether it was intended to bring the
matter to an issue in the present ses
sion of congress or wait for the new
congress. RIDERS MAKE UP TIME.
Six Day Cyclers by Repeated Sprints
Pass the 1899 Records.
New York, Dec. 12. With the end of
their long Journey only half a day dis
tant, eight weary but determined riders
were whirling around the big saucer-
shaped track at Madison Square Gar
den today. Eight more men equally
as worn by the fearful strain of the
almost ceaseless grind in the six day
bicycle race were snatching a brief rest
before they were to be called upon to
take up the struggle while their spent
partner sought the rest they so much
needed. The night had been a trying
one for all the men, one sprint follow
ing another with scarcely a breathing
Interval between. For a time yesterday
the riders were many miles behind the
mark set by Miller and Waller in the
famous race of 1899, but this loss was
gradually cut down and during the
night new records were established
hour after hour and at 8 o'clock this
morning the three leading teams were
more than 10 miles ahead of the mark
established nine years ago. The score
at that hour was:
Rutt-Stol 2,469.9.
Macfarland-Moran. 2,469.9.
Hill-Demara. 2,469.9.
Walthour-Root, 2,469.8.
Collins-Mitten, 2.469.7.
Galvin-Wiley, 2,469.6.
Anderson-Vanoni, 2,469.3.
Palmer-Drobach, 2,457.5.
The best previous record was 2,459
miles and 6 laps, made by Miller and
Waller in 1S99.
The fast pace of the night was
steadily maintained during the early
hours ot the forenoon and the old rec
ord was constantly falling farther be
hind. At 10 o'clock the three leading
teams, with Rutt and Stol in the van,
were more than fourteen miles ahead
of the Miller and Waller 1899 record.
They had covered 2,508 miles 9 laps
against the old record of 2,494 miles 8
laps for 130 hours. There had been
no change in the relative positions of
the riders at that hour.
Between 10 and 11 o'clock the leaders
covered 19 miles nine laps and Increas
ed their lead over the old record more
than two miles. At 11 o'clock they had
covered 2,528 miles 8 laps against 2,512
miles 2 laps made by Miller and Wal
ler in 1899.
The score at 1 o'clock was as fol
lows: Rutt-Stol. 2,566.7.
Moran-Macfarland. 2,566.7.
Hill-Demara, 2,566.7. .
Walthour-Root, 2.566.6.
Mitten-Collins, 2.566.5.
Wiley-Galvin, 2,566.4.
Vanoni-Anderson, 2,566.1.
Palmer-Drobach, 2.554.3. i
The record for 133d hour was 2,549
miles and 6 laps made by Miller and
Waller in 1899. ,

Congressman Murdock Is Still
Fighting Cannon.
Says Those Who Support Speak
' er Face Defeat.
THAT CABINET PLACE.
Wichita Congressman Suggests
Maj. Hood for Treasury.
Dodge City Land Office Leads
in Fees Collected.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 12. "Every
member of the Kansas delegation in
the house who votes for the re-election
of Joseph G. Cannon for speaker
of the Sixty-first congress will find
himself facing Inevitable defeat in his
own campaign for re-election two
years hence."
This startling statement was maae
by Congressman Victor Murdock, who
is prominently menuneo wim mc
movement to defeat Cannon for the
speakership.
"Kansas people are demanding a
new deal here and are strong for a
rhaniro in tha gtrten Wershin." continued
i Mr. Murdock. "They are so intent on
! revising the rules of the house and
the speakership that if these de
sired changes are not voted for, they
; will undoubtedly revise the member-
snip 01 tne Jvansas aeiegauon ai me
next election."
There is no discussion here in
Washington among the Kansas people
concerning the. possibility of the state
securing a place in the Taft cabinet.
Members ef the congressional delega
tion declare they know of no can
didate seeking such honor or that
they will even consider the question
of asking for such an appointment in
the future. As one of the members
of the delegation said, "It's just
newspaper talk. The delegation has
ot considered any action along this
line and probably will not in the
future." -
Congressman Murdock says that if
Kansas is to get a cabinet job, he
wants to see Calvin Hood of Emporia
named for the . secretaryship of the
treasury. "He is one of the biggest
j men in Kansas." said Murdock, "and
is well qualified for the office. '
The attention of the. postoffice de
partment has been called to the re
cent publication of an article to the
effect that according to an order of
the department, mail boxes along
rural routes belong to the department
and not to the patron, even though the
latter pays for them.-
It was authoritatively stated to the
State Journal correspondent that no
such order has ever been issued by
the postmaster general or the fourth
' assistant postmaster general. The
j erroneous impression probably arose
t from the fact that the department
will not permit mail boxes erected on
rural routes to be used for any other
purpose than the receipt and dispatch
of mail matter.
The position taken by the depart
ment with reference to rural delivery
patrons' boxes is that while such
receptacles are the property of the
patrons, they are erected exclusively
for the receipt and dispatch of mail,
and matter placed therein is con
strued to be in the mails and subject
to the laws and regulations govern
ing mall matter, including payment of
postage. .
The secretary of the treasury has
Just made public a statement

BAD FORWnETT
Indicted for Bribery in School
Book Case.
Trial Set for Monday Lively
Interest.
Gallatin, Mo., Dec. 12. The case of
Samuel Burnett, representative of Ginn
& Co., indicted for' attempted bribery,
is attracting a great deal of attention.
Edwin Ginn, Senior Partner of Ginn
& Co.
The case comes up for trial Monday
next, December 14, and the Interest here
is intense.
Nothing will cause the people at
large to sit up and take notice, as
quickly as will a contemplated change
in school text books. During the sum
mer of .1907, Missouri was the battle
ground of one of the fiercest school
book fights in the history of the busi
ness. This was caused by the new text
book law, passed by the legislature and
which went into effect June 14, 1907.
The law provided for county uniformi
ty of texts instead of state uniformi
ty, which bad been in force for some
years. As there are 114 counties in
Missouri, the various publishing con
cerns sent in hundreds of their: best
men. from all parts of the country and
they succeeded in raising a turmoil
from one end of the state to the other.
The fight continued all of last sum
mer. Under the new law. every county has
a text book commission of three mem-
bers, empowered to let a contract for ,
all books used in the county for a 1
period of five, years. The county school j
commission is ex-omcio, a raemrer ana
president of the commission. - Onej mem
ber is appointed by the county court
and the other member is appointed by
the state board of education.
In the aggregate, the contracts let
tv the various counties, will amount to
several millions of dollars. As Davies !
county is one ui tne laigcai ui uio
it was the scene of a particularly hot
contest. ' Among the agents competing
for the business, appeared Samuel
Burnett, of Springfield, 111., one of the
Illinois agents of Ginn & Co., one of
the largest school book concerns in the
world. After the smoke of the battle
cleared away, there was considerable
talk going the rounds that perhaps un
due influence might have been brought
to bear on the members of the board.
The talk finally reached such propor
tions that a grand jury was called to
investigate the matter. The result was
that the grand Jury indicted Burnett
representing Ginn & Co., for attempt
ed bribery.
The Davies county board is compos
ed of S. W. Shreckengaust, county com
missioner. Prof. John L. Anderson,
superintendent of schools of Gallatin,
and Miss Elsie Fischer, a teacher In
the Pattonsburg schools.
The specific charge against Burnett
was that he had offered Anderson $200
for his vote on the Frye Geographies,
one of the publications of Ginn & Co.
Although the indictment against Bur
nett was found April 21, the arrest was
not made until October 21, at which
time he was apprehended in Kansas
City by Sheriff Hutchinson. Burnett
gave bond for $1,000 for his appearance
December 14, his sureties being J. C.
Hisey, one of the Missouri agents for
Ginn & Co., and J. C. Grover, an ex
agent of Ginn & Co., but now practicing
law in Kansas City. It is said that
Grover recently had a personal encoun
ter with Anderson on the street in
Gallatin.
Prof. Anderson stands high among
the leaders in educational circles in
Missouri, and has held a number of
prominent positions. - -
The people of Kansas will watch the
outcome of this case with considerable
interest. The big contract recently let
in this state and the charges made in
that connection are of sufficiently re
cent occurrence to be still fresh in the
mind.
It will be remembered that Mrs. Ella
Burton. Democratic candidate for state
superintendent. made many grave
charges against the various publishing
houses. Indeed she, practically made
her campaign on this issue.
Smallpox in Uie Fleet.
Colombo, Ceylon, Dec. 12. The battle
ship Georgia, preceding the battleship
fleet under Rear Admiral Sperry due
here tomorrow morning, came into port
today with a smallpox case on board.
The patient was at once removed to a
hospital. The Georgia separated from
the fleet at 10 o'clock the night of De
cember 9, and came ahead at a speed of
14 knots. The fleet Itself is coming at
a speed of 10 knots an hour.
TRADE SLACKS UP
Holiday Business Takes Pre
cedence of All Other Lines.
Best Reports Come From West
ern Section of Union.
BUILDING REPORTS
Continue to Show Activity in
Month of November.
Most Cities Record Large In
crease in Bank Clearings.
New Tork, Dec. 12. Bradstreets saysr
Retail and holiday trade are mors In
evidence this week and as these have
expanded, business in regular wholesale
and jobbing lines has quieted down;
both regular retail trade and the usual
Christmas shopping demand have not
yet fully met expectations at many
points, particularly at the south, where
low priced cotton is a retarding feature.
Best reports as to trade come from the
southwest and the spring wheat states
and Pacific northwest. In wholesale
and jobbing there is a disposition to go
slower, pending a clearer view of year-
end distribution and inventories. There
is also in evidence some conservatism
as to placing spring business.
In Industrial lines the volume or or
ders is sufficient to 4nduce manufactur
ers to go ahead freely. An example is
afforded by a report of pig iron pro
duction for November larger than for
any previous month this year and 60
per cent in advance of January.
Final building reports for November
testify to activity in this line.

FOR LOOTING CARS.
Two "Men Placed Under Arrest in Nerr
York.
New York, Dec. 12. Charged with
having in their possession stolen goods'
the property of the West Shore rail
road, two men who said they wem
Charles Cohen and Jacob Barney, both;
ol Buffalo, were arrested today.
For months the West Shore road
has been a heavy sufferer from a hand
of train robbers. Cars enroute from
Buffalo to New York were opened
and thousands of dollars worth of
merchandise taken. Although snma
of the cleverest railroad detectives
were assigned to the case they could
not ascertain just where the cars were
broken open. A short time ago while
the investigation was going on a car
was broken open and $10,000 worth of
merchandise removed. According to
the police, the thieves hid thlr loot
for a while, then packed It in fresh
cases and shipped it on to this city or
elsewhere, consigned to confederates
who disposed of it in various ways.
It is said by the authorities that there
was $1,500 worth of stolen freight In
the lodging rooms In which Cohen
and Barney were found.
