\<yrre on Domestic Affairs
Tribune Washington Bureau
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Here are a
few of the comments of members of
Congress after the address, particular?
ly on the peace question:
Senator Rood: "The President says
s'd nations have approved the fourteen
' peace points. No nation has approved
the fourteen peace points. The Presi?
dent says our soldiers fought for these.
fought to whip Germany.
. disagree with the President that
we should assist in the r?habilitation
of France. On domestic questions 1
am in substantial accord with the
President."
Senator James Hamilton Lewis: "The
message was splendid. 1 was particu?
larly pleased with the President's
treatment of the railroad question.
Railroads should be owned by the gov?
ernment, but operated under private
management."
Senator New, of Indiana: "It was an
occasion of no consequence."
Representative McKinley, of Illinois:
"I do not believe 1 fully gathered from
the message why Senators Hitchcock
and Lodge should not accompany the
President to France."
Senator Kellogg, of Minnesota: "I
was disappointed that the President
?lid not take the Congress and the
country more into his confidence upon
the great points of the peace treaty,
especially ns the Senate has coordinate
treaty-making power."
Senator Simmons: "The message
vas fine. It was a great deliverance,
easily one of the President's strongest
Utterances. His frank statement of the
reasons impelling him to go abroad
and personally participate in the
peace negotiations will to a large ex?
tent allay criticism, both inside and
outside of Congress,"
Senator J$Hl*son, of California: "For
days and lays it has been heralded
through the press that on this oc
casion the President would make clear
why his presence was imperatively de?
manded in Europe and that he would
the American people what he. as
their leader, desired at the peace con?
ference. We know no more now than
We did before the address. There has
beer, neither amplification nor eluci?
dation. 'Open diplomacy.' 'Freedom of
? . Seas,' 'I.?.'ague of Nations,' are yet
ere generalities as nebulous as they
have been in the past few months. The
Presiden! leaves us without an ad?
ministrative programme for ? recon?
struction of definite American policies
s- to peace terms. The American
people have the right to know both."
(ourse (dear. Says Phelan
Sei tor Piulan, of California: "The
President's justification for his attend?
ance ? ?. the peace conference was ab?
solute ; convincing. He has been the
country's leader in the war and the peo?
ple and Congress approved enthusiasti?
cally his cause. He made articulate the
?sentiments of his countrymen. The
representatives of the Allies have con?
curre?! in his statement of war pur?
poses and aims. If he failed to attend
find support by his counsel the high
ideals he has utt( red in our names h<
would have conspicuously failed of his
duty."
Senator Harding, of Ohio: "A fine
tribute to the soldiers and sailors of
' i fit -pul?! ie and the country's patriotic
l . ??port of the war. The statement of
the railway problem was frank and fait,
and carried the revelation that Con?
gress really has a work to do and is
?gain expected to do it. The message
Was not revealing so far as peace terms
fire concerned, but one would not ex?
pect the spokesman of the Western
Hemisphere to revi a! his hand in ad?
vance. Th<- message lacked the cock
Bure confidence of many previous ut?
terances."
"Reasons Not Convincing"
Senator Sherman, of Illinois: "The
President docs not convince by his
reasons for going abroad. The more
he argues the less he justi ies himself.
While admitting great inconveniences,
?erts it to he his paramount dut v.
' ?"' ?; not a negotiation of perma?
nent peace that could not as well be
conducted with the Presiden! at his
LeaVe?rsameeSr?ment in WashinSton as
Senator Underwood ? Democral I, Ala?
bama: "It is my clear impression thai
the Pr?s,dent intends, if there is no
legislation in the near future bv Con?
gress, to restore the railroads to theii
owners. It ,s a physical impossibility
for there to b? any legis
present session of Congress no1 onh?
because o? the lack . ? ume but >i,';
cause the subject is one that will re?
quire several montl of serious con?
sideration before a bill could be sen
o sly taken up. It therefore seems
obvious to me that tiie President's atti?
tude will result in throwing this prob?
lem into the lap of the next Congress,
\vhich the Republicans will control. It
i-? further evident that if the President
??ne= no' call an extra session before
the regula;!' convening in next Decem
ker he will, under his language to-day,
Teturn the railroads to their owners in
! eu of Congressional action."

New York Editors Agree

Even "Tin? Times" anil "The World," Supporter?
of the Administration, Give No Full Measure of
Approval to Proposed Trip to Co uferen re
Editorial comment in New York
. morning newspapers was unanimous in
j deploring the reticence of the Presi

I agreement in its hostility to his pro
nosed trip. Even "The World" and
"The Times." supporters ?if the Admin

approval. "The World" says that only
by results can the trip be judged.
"The Times" regrets that be has not

cerpts from the editorials say:
"THE WORLD"
"Those who looked for an elaboration
? of his reasons for attending the Peace
Conference in President Wilson's 1111
! nual address to Congress yesterday
! were disappointed, of course. In the
nature of things, the stronger his con
' viction that his presence in Paris is
! necessary the less he could say about
?; it publicly.
"When the President, of the United
' States, acting within constitutional
i limitations, refers to any act of his ns
without private thought or purpose but
ns his highest duty, it is to be supposed
that he is governed by weighty con?
siderations as to the outcome of which
he is prepared to accept full responsi
"THE TIMES"
"Specifically, they (the American peo
j pie) have practically no knowledge of
; what he intends to say in respect to
? the freedom of the seas and the league
'of nations; they are quite ignorant of
? the measures lie will recommend for
i deliverance and safety of the Russian
i people, where the need of immediate
action is imperative, and they are quite
: as much in the dark as to his purposes
concerning certain questions of terri?
torial apportionments in Europe which
are becoming acute. It will be admit
, ted that with all our sudden and ideal?
istic devotion to open diplomacy, it
might have been inexpedient to open all
these matters to public discussion, but
for all the people know Mr. Wilson
has made up his mind upon these
weighty matters without resort to the
counsel of other mind.'. They trust
him, they have confidence in his wis?
dom, but they would be well pleased
to feel that the decisions he has
reached had been shared in an?l ap?
proved by other Amenicans of "light
and leading" well qualified to give ad?
vice upon these complex international
problems."
"THE SUN"
"All other features of the address,
. considered as an annual message by the
President to the Congress on the state
of the Union, fade into comparative
insignificance beside this unparalleled
assumption of almost autocratic pow?
ers. Since our national history began
there has been nothing like the theory
of a President's powers and duties here
by him disclosed. His departure under
such circumstances, and with so bold >:
defiance of the prevailing sentiment of
the country so recently expressed at
his own invitation in the recent Con?
gress elections, creates the most im- j
. portant issue and raises the greatest
question now before the American Re?
public namely, the question as to who
is legally the Republic's President now
that Mr. Wilson is sailing away on the
George Washington on a mission un- ?
known to our Constitution and laws."
"THE HERALD"
"What Congress wanted to hoar was
the 'why' of the visit to Europe. It
heard about what it had heard before. ,
The President said that the Allied ?
governments had asked him to attend !
the peace conference in order to make ?
clear the meaning of his 'fourteen
points,' and he felt, therefore, that
he should go. He failed, iiowever, to
give his reasons for objecting to the ?
Vice-President performing the duties j
that would seem clearly to devolve ;
upon that official during the period
when the President is unable to per?
form them.
"So the attitude of Mr. Wilson tow- \
aid Mr. Thomas Riley Marshall _-e
! mains as great a mystery as ever."
President Playing
Lone Hand. Editors
Of ISation Assert
The country's reaction to the
President's message to Congress is
reflected in the following editorial
?-uniment :
"Chicago Tribune" "The President's
address to Congress is in large par:
an eloquent review of American
achievement in this world war.
"The President'.-' statement a3 to the
purpose of his journey to the peace
conference i i of a general nature siid
does not attempt to answer the ob?
jections raised against the departure.
We see no reason at this time to dis
CU8S these objections, inasmuch as his
course is determined upon and com?
ment would be futile."
"Phildelphia Public I-edger"?"He
has chosen to play a lone hand. This
is always a course of peril, not only in
this case for the player, but for the
country, and quite possibly for human?
ity. But no one seriously imagine
that this choice having been made,
matters would be helped by a barrage
of political criticism following the
President from Washington and dis?
counting his prestige in Paris."
"Boston Herald" A notably brief
? fraction of the President's address to
Congress yesterday deals with the
subject of paramount interest to the
American people. And that is the
war's termination and his own part in
i it. We incline to the belief, however,
that, they are disposed to trust him to
perform his duty in his own way. They
would resent, we believe, any of the
plans like that which Senator Cur.i
' mins. of Iowa, has proposed for send?
ing over a special representation to
watch the course of events in behalf
of the Senate.
"Boston (.lobe"?"if the war made
of the President an autocrat he ha
now abdicated his autocracy, In yes
terdny's message to Congress the
longest, but hardly the strongest of his
messages there is nothing autocratic.
The words seem to be those of a man
a little weary, perhaps a little disap?
pointed, who is anxious to turn away
from issues and duties of which he
has tired to issues and duties that
lure and thrill him.7'
"Indianapolis Star" "The defence of
the trip to Enro?e is lame and almost
insulting in its inadequacy. What he is
going for nnd what he proposes to
accomplish there is something which
Congress and the people have the right
to know, but which he discusses in
terms so vague and euphemistic to sug?
gest grandma trying t<> camouflage nn
inquisitive baby into silence. Why he
h'*?:' to go instead o? sending a com?
petent delegation is ignored and not a
single explanation is offered of the
| aims which hi? hopes to accomplish."
? that is in everybody's mind the sub
? jeet of the peace terms to be written
j in Paris in the next few weeks he
j I President Wilson) is thoroughly dis
! appointing. There is nothing in -the
i address to show why it was so essen
jtial that the President appear in per
j son at the conference, and the country
is still left ?~n this point to conjecture."
"St. Louis (.lobe Democrat"?"The
; President had least to say about, the
, subject on which the country expected
! most. . . . Whatever we may think
' of Mr. Wilson's manner of going at the
! task we fervently wish him success in
' its accomplishment, if that accomplish
| ment is to be in line with the American
; ideals for which we have fought. We
| are not disposed to think he can make
? either application any surer by h4
personal presence at the peace confer?
ence, but, evidently, his view of it is
? different, and we don't think there i ?
1 anything to be gained for our cause

German Famine Is Sham,
j Says Official Telegram
French- Quote Teuton Paper?
to Prove Last Harvest
Was Abundant
Tribune Washington Bureau
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.- An official
; French telegram to-day states that the
' "famine" in Germany is a sham and
i that, according to German official as
j well as press statements, there are
1 sufficient foodstuffs in the empire to
carry it through the winter.
During 1917 Germany, the dispatch
says, was revictualled from a crop in?
ferior to the average, bu% the last har?
vest was abundant. Before the armis?
tice the Germans declared their food
sufficiency, and their effort since the
signing- of the armistice to make it
appear that the nation faces starvation
was undertaken, the telegram asserts,
"to move the universe to pity."
The Imperial Chancellor declared be?
fore the signing of the armistice that
Germany was able to overcome food
difficulties and to defeat the attempts
of the Entente and America to starve
her into submission. On September 20
the Cologne "Gazette" declared: "The
situation shows itself more favorable
than it was at this time last year."
The Munich "Abend Zeitung" said on
October l": "The crop of hurley and
oats is estimated to be 12,000,000 tons,
at least, which will allow the daily
bread ration to be increased to BOO
grammes, which is more than the aver?
age per head consumption."'
The Cologne "Gazette" stated on
November 16: "The sugar output.
1,800,000 tons, greatly exceeds the
needs of peace times, 1,200,000 tons.
There are plenty of potatoes. At the
end of September Herr von Waldow
spoke of raising the weekly ration to
nine pounds."
The Chemnitzer "Volks Zeitung"
wrote on September il": "Some cities
have enough to lasl them until April
. 1, 1919."

Tribune Washington Bureau
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Boris Bakh
| metiefF, Russian Ambassador to the
i United .States, to-day informed the
State Department that he expects to
embark for France within a few days.
| He will confer with the Russian rep?
resentatives at Paris, London, Rome
? and Stockholm in the preparation of
I Russia's case for the peace conference.
Mr. Bakhmetkeff will be accompanied
to Kurnpe by ?VI. M. [varpovitch, secre?
tary of the embassy, and V. T. Novit- i
!;.'.", financial attache.
The Russian diplomats will be por- :
mitted by the Allies to attend ?he peace
conference in Paris as representatives
of their country, it. was intimated to?
day by Prince George E. Lvoff, Premier;
of the first provisional Russian gov
? ernment, who will head the Russian del- .
egation at Versailles.
In view of the absence of united gov
j ernment in Russia, the delegation is
| not likely to have foil recognition as,
i plenipotentiaries. Prince LvotT, who is
| now in Washington, will depart soon
for France by way of England.
The conference of Russian diplomats
? in Paris probably will discuss plans
i for continued Allied aid for the reha
? bilitations of Russia.
That the United States and the
Allies do not intend to withdraw their
forces from Russia was demonstrated
in cables made public by the Russian
I Embassy. The cables were from the
regional government at Archangel,
which is cooperating with the Allies in
Northern Russia. The embassy's an
, nouncement follows:
"The American Ambassador, who left
: Russia for a short time owing to ill?
ness, before his departure addressed
! the American soldiers at Archangel,
j saying that when war would be ter
I minated they would leave Russia after
j helping to establish order.
"Mr. Linsley, representative of Great
i Britain, declared in an interview that!
the Allies would remain in Russia un?
til the situation became clearer and
until a single government was formed
which would be capable to assure order. |
"M. Nouions, Ambassador of France,
; stated that the Allies would render un
t sellish assistance until the Bolsheviki
I were; expelled.
"Genera! Ironside, commander of the
Allie?! trcops, speaking to the officers,
declared thai the Vllies had come to
: Russia with the purpose of helping in
the struggle against the Bolsheviki and ;
in the reorganization of the Russian
army."
The embassy made public ;>.iso the
: following cablegram from the Foreign
Affairs Ministry at Omsk, which has
buc-n transmitted t>? the State Depart-;
ment:
"Kindly bring to the knowledge of
the United States government that the ?
government which is headed by Ad-I
mirai Kolchuk as its supreme chief,;
hearing in mind that Russia had al- ;
ways sacredly executed all liabilities
toward its own subjects as well as
| toward nations with which it is bound
by treaties, deems it necessary to
state in the declaration of November
j 21 that it undertakes to fulfil, as soon
as United Russia is reconstructed, all
| the liabilities of the state treasury
i. e., payment, of interest and cmorti
zatiou on interior and exterior state
loans, payments on contracts, salaries!
of employes, pensions and all other
legal foundations. The government at
the same time declares all financial j
'acts o,r the Soviei powers a?-ts pub-1

Our Peace Perils
Not Obvious Ones,
Says H. C. Emery
Prussianizing of the Spirit
Threatens Nation, For?
mer Prisoner in Germany
Tolls the Economie Club
Peace perils which the United .States
faces, Henry Crosby Emery told the
Economic Club of New York last night
at its dinner at the Hotel Aster, are
not the obvious ones which come glibly
to the tongue of every clapt**ap orator.
The United States is not. in danger of
becoming militarized, he asserted, it. is
not in danger of autocratic centralized
government. What threatens the na?
tion, now that victorious peace has
come, he said, is Prussianizing of the
spirit "that overweening conceit, self
satisfaction, cockiness.call it, what you
will?of the German which made him so
irritating even in his peaceful moods."
That and a lowering of ideals, a loss o?
t ht* sincerity with which the nat?o i cm
Larked upon i a great adventure are the
most ominous perils the future would
offer, ho said.
Mr. Emery, who now is connected
with the Guaranty Trust Company of
New York, was in Russia on a govern?
ment mission, when lie had to flee from
the Bolshevik i and was captured by
the Germans.
American Word Believed
"Perhaps my stay in Germany made
me hypersensitive in detecting the
Germanic accent in anything bordering
on trick?);' or deceit," he said. "1 can?
not, however, refrain from telling you
what a solemn pride it was to me to
Find how the German took it as a mat?
ter of course that the American gov?
ernment meant exactly what it said;
that no one. outside t'.ic Pan-Germans,
questioned the sincerity of a single
phrase in an American state docu?
ment."
It is still a question, Mr. Emery con?
tinued, whether the force that de?
stroyed militarism is powerful enough
to crush Bolshevism, it. might be nec?
essary, he thought, to continue to aid
in guarding democracy, not now against
kings, but against mm crazy from a
release from the restiaints of law and
order.
Besides Mr. Emery Mir speakers were
Henry Morgenthau, president of the
club, ivho presided; Ma or ("enera! J.
Franklin Bell, Dr. Charles \V. Eliot and
Darwin 13 Kingsley. The guests of the
club were Lorenzo Giovanni, of the
Palian High Commission', Henri La
Fontaine, ex-Senator of Belgium, and
N3 (!. Kyriakides, pr?s dent of the
Committee of Unredeemed Greeks.
About 2.000 attended the dinner.
"Freedom of the Meas" p
A closely-knit Anglo-Latin Federa?
tion, not a league of sovereign nations,
was advocated by Mr. Kingsley as the
only certain method of preserving the
peace of the world. lie warned Amer?
icans against future dangers lurking in
the cryptic phrase "the freedom of the
seas."
"It" I understand what President Wil?
son means by the freedom o;' the sens
and I sometimes wonder whether any?
one 'inderstands it (?rent Britain will
never agree to it, and can never agree
to it," he said.
"As a consequence the basi- of grave
differences between Britain and our?
selves is likely to be laid down at the
peace table. The contest in sea power
that went on so long between Great
Britain and Germany und finolly cul?
minated in this war is apparently about
to be transferred to the British Empire
and the United States. Could any hin?;
be more stupid not to say criminal."
Mr. Morgenthau outlined the oppor?
tunities of humanitarian service
which, he said, would < nable America
to occupy a new position as the great?
est nation in the world's history. "1 n
less we show the world we possess the
highest qualities of unselfishness," he
said, "we are apt to sink back into the
materialism which so many observ? iv
formerlv attributed to us."

j stroyers to sail for the Azore Islands,
i there to await passage of the fleet

It is said that the squadron forming

Up io to-night, nothing definite had
! been determined whether the Presi?
dent would land at Brest or Cherbourg,
j but it is expected thai Mr. Wilson,
with the united fleet, will arrive at
; Brest on the afternoon of December 11.
The squadron of American dread
' noughts and destroyers which will go
! to sea to meet the ship carrying the
: President with its escorting warships
will take its course for a rendezvous
. fixed for the two fleets on the high
.??as.
Admiral Mayo, who has returned to
the United States, will command the
e ?corl squadron across the Atlantic.
The admiral's dag will flv 'rom the

American troops will take part in
the visit of the President, as escorts

be distinctly an event of state.
Will Be Greeted at Brest
The first greetings to President Wil
| son will be extended by Foreign Minis?
ter Pich?n and Georges Leygues, the
Minister of Marine, at Brest. Oppor?
tunity will be given the populace of
Brest, for a public demonstration of
welcome.
As Biest is ten hours' journey from
Paris the President's departure will be
timed so that he will reach the capital
at 2 o'clock on the afternoon of Decem?
ber 13', according to the present ar
: rangements. These may be changed,
i however, so that the arrival will take
I place at 2 o'clock p. m. on December 13,
? in order to avoid train travel by night.
In the latter case a stop will be made
by the party between Brest and Paris,
so that the arrival will occur at the
designated hour in the early afternoon,
when the whole populace will have an
opportunity to join in the welcome.
It. is expected that the Presidential
train, instead of at riving at the Mont?
parnasse station, the usual terminus,
will be switched to arrive at the Dau
phine station, at the entrance of the
magnitieent Avenue Bois de Boulogne.

I ness and industry, the President took
I the position that ttfk remarkable initia?
tive of the American business man
would deal with the problem in a
prompt and satisfactory manner and
that business would resent any pater
nalistic policy of attempted govern?
mental direction of its plans and poli?
cies in confrontation of the new era.
Reconstruction Policy
About all that the government could
or should do, the President holds, is
i to place at the disposal of business the
? knowledge and experience the various
war administrations have acquired.
The three weeks that have elapsed sinc?a
the armistice was signed justify this
policy, he thinks. He finds that the
celerity with which business moves to
its new duties and functions "promises
to outrun any inquiry that may be in?
stituted and any aid that may be of?
fered it. It will not be easy to direct
it any better than it will direct itself."
This statement disposes so far as
executive initiative is concerned of ail
schemes for reconstruction commi.
sions which will seek to impose a new
and artificial system on American busi?
ness. Anything that may develop in
j that line will now have to originate
! with Congress. If there be a recon
j struction problem the President has
i passed it to Congress. He appears to
hold that it is not the United States
| but the world that is in need of recon
i struction.
Only in one respect does the Pr?s?
dent hold that the government should
I do anything to hasten industrial stabil
! ity, and that is in respect to unemploy
i ment of labor, which he appears to
think is inevitable in some degree for
! the unskilled men of the army. It is
i noticeable that the President is speak
! ing of unemployment problems arising
! from the displacement of war workers.
The only problem he mentions is
that of the returning soldier who was
; in civil life an unskilled laborer. For
this returning soldier, who knows not
whither to go or what to do. the Presi
i dent urges the resumption of public
works and the development of our un
1 used lands and idle natural resources.
In the relation ho devotes especial
: attention to Secretary Lane's plans for
reclamation of arid, swamp and cut
? over lands. The reclamation of those
lands, some 300,000,000 acres in ex?
tent, "would effect a great rural and
' agricultural development which will
afford the best sort of opportunity to
| men who want to help themselves."
The only continued regulation of
i trade that the President recommends
. relates to foreign reconstruction to
? the rehabilitation of Northern France
and Belgium, for which purpose he
: asks Congress to grant to some such
agency as the War Trade Board, it it
? should become necessary, the right to
establish priorities of export and sup
? ply, in favor "of these people whom
j we have been so happy to assist in
saving from the German terror and
whom we must not th oughtlessly
! leave to shift for themselves in a piti
? less competitive market."
