Wc print lo-ilay the voluminous docu
ment which the law coir puis the president
to send to coiifiress from time to lime, Riv
ing tho condition of the country and its
arms of service, und making such supi;es
tiuns as the exeoutiva of the country thinks
congress should attend to. The message,
theoretically, is valuable as alliirding the
legislators nuthentlo information as to the
state of affairs in tho country generally, so
that they may know better how to act. In
fact, the chief interest iu the document cen
ters in the president's views on public ques
tions as contained in his recommendations.
So prosperous aro the United States nt
present that the president, iu the messnge
soul in yesterday, congratulates the peo
pie warmly upon the fact. He then dwolls
upon our relations to other nations. We
are nt peace with every people and sustain
Kith them the most cordial re
lalions. In our dealings with Great
HrlUin, France, (iormany, Russia,
Italy, and in fact nil the
countries, but Bpain, and possibly Turkey,
any requests mado by us lately have been
at once complied with, nnd courtesies have
been cheerfully and mutually extended
With releronco to Spain tho president Oom
plains that our demands upon her in ityost
Instances havo not been mot with a disposi
tion to accede as promptly nnd cheerfully
thereto as ought to have been, and
Bpcaks of the heavy lines imposed
iu 8 punish ports upon American
vessels nnd tho excessive tees charged upon
American importations, lie details the
fact that Germany has invited us to one nf
tier exhibitions in '.'! and asks that provision
be made to comply with the request: that
Italy bus been very prolusu in Its expres
aions of regret over the death of Mimktkh
Maiihh; tint the sr.opo of the extradition
treaty with Belgium hns been enlarged; that
tho Swiss government has ceasod
to give countenance to the ship
incut ol its paupers and criminals
to America; recommends the continu
ance with niodilicatioiis of the reciprocity
treaty with the Sandwich Islands, and
dwells upon tho part played by our state
department with refeiunce to the Chili
Peruvian troubles. In commenting on
foroign affairs, tho president shows tint ho
has tho correct American Idea of letting
Other people's business nlono, and is very
modoruto. In view of the growing disposi
lion among the nations to settle important
questions by conference and arbl
tration, ho very sensibly sug
Bonis that greater powers should
bo conferred upon tho president with refer
enco to tho appointment of delegates to
Uioso international conventions. There is
no special foreign polit y indicated by Mu
AiiTimit's remarks on our foreign relations,
nor nothing now or startling to tell. As to
homo all'alrs, lie dwells at length and si a
tlstically upon the financial and industrial
condition of the Union. Tho show
ing throughout is nu ndmirnblc
one, and denotes that within
our atlalrs at-) as prosperous
nnd as satisfactory as are our relations with
tho outsldo world, Upon tho great subject
of interest now in America, the revision or
abolition of tho tariff, the president Is just
Whero hit party stands. He wants (he in
ternal revenue taxes reduced, but by the
abolition of the tux on articles other than
whisky and tobacco. In this respect ho
and the Commissioner of Interim! Revenue
stand upon the sumo platfoum. The
president uiilorliinitoly oilers tho conn
try no new views, no startling sug
get-lions, no urotul and progressive
statesmanship in his treatment of tho tarill'
or financial problems of the government,
llo thinks with his party that there should
bo protection, but that our present system
needs correct ions to tho extent of cqualit
ing duties and taxation. With reference
to the. war and navy departments ho is
in accord with (lie secretaries of those
arms, and approves of tho recoiiimenda
ttnns made by them in their reports, He
thinks, of courso, that the bill pnssci!

peculation or broad research and sugges
tion indicated in the document, but it is
plain and practical, and is valuable as a
statistical epitome ot the present political,

of tho country. While the president
shows that he is posted as to what is going

Wasiiinutos, Dec. 3. The report ol E. IS.
Ilium, commissioner ot internal revenue,
bus been submitted to the secretary of the
treasury, it begins with the topic ol reduc
ing taxation, as follows: Receipts of inter
nal revenue taxation have increased Inim
illa.boo.bonin the fiscal year of l7!Ho $11,
ouo.uijO iii iwsO, $i:j5,lni0.uon in 1V1, and to
$I Ui.Ouo,(iO in round figures; in the fiscal
last ended. There will probably be some
diminution in reports of the present
fiscal year, us compared with last year,
but it is not likely thu collection
of internal re venue for the current year
will lull below $1I,'i.i.Ki0.iiO, should taxes
now imposed be retained, it is an old and
sound maxim that no more revenue should
be raised than is hlm essary for tiie economi
cal administration of government and the
gradual reduction of the public debt,
Hlthoutli taxation uauy be so wisely
adjusted, as not to operate as u
severe burden upon the people. When
tho amount collected is beyond the actual
needs ol the government there is presented
constant temptation to extravagance in ap
propriations. Another consideration at
tending the eiciliug overltowing condition
of thu public treasury cannot have failed to
attract your notice if the present rate of
paying the principal of the public debt bo
continued, nil bonds subject to call will be
paid within three years, ufter which the
Kovernmunt be compelled, in order to dis
pose of its surplus rt'Tonuo, to buy
ill open market li per cent,
bonds, which fall due in 1H!I,
or I percent, bonds, .winch fall due in I'Ml.
Should the government thus buc.nme an
active purchaser of theso bonds before ma
turity, it seems clear they would advance
in pay, which would bo regarded us waste
of tlio people's money. It teems to me ju
dicious that tlio principal of the public
debt should bo extinguished us originally
contemplated, only us necessary to meet
the requirements ot the sinking
mud, viz: to tho
extent
of
arrangement, the effect of which will cut
down I lie production ot all cIusth ot dis
tilled spirits lo tne demands of the trade.
OutheoOtbof June, l.s2, the spirits re
maining in wareboiies reached the highest
point, namely: HI.iHU.tri5 gallons; since that
tune there has been a gradual reduction in
the amount remaining iu warehouses and in
the 1st of November, lM, the amount
was M.R'N.-s.') gallons This large stock
mainlv consisted of line grades of whisky,
the tax upon which lull due from month io
month. The lust witlulrawul must tie made
tlieilthol December, l.V; 1 lie lulure de
mand for this class of goods is to be judged
of by the withdrawal of similar
Roods and the tax paid dur
ing the past few years. The slock now
on hand, is equal to a year's consumption.
To postpone the payment of tax on this
stock until its withdrawal is required by
the demands of the trade. A movement
lias been set mi foot for ils exportation and
reiuinoitation, and storage iu customs
bonded warehouses. This is fairly practi
cable under the existing laws, and it has
become a question whether it would not be
better to afford by legislation tho relief
sought to be obtained by this in
direct means. The extension nf
tho bonded period for a reasonable time
need not impair the security of the govern
ment for taxes, and would in no manner
tend to reduce tne income of the govern
ment from this source of revenue, which
his, up to this period, resul'ed fiom the
natural laws of trade and the demand for
distilling spirits. Hy this meunsthe ex
penses of transportation both ways and
custom-house charges ulreudy would bo
saved. It affords me greut pleasure to re
port the siiprenincy ol laws for the collec
tion nf internal revenues wh cli have been
published iu all parts of tlio country. To
maintain this favorable condition nt 'things
ond prevent tlio recurrence of frauds, it will
be necessary lo continue the system of care
lul policy which has brought about tins re
sult. Tho recommendation is renewed for
granting a pension to persons disabled or
injured in enforcing tlio law and to widows
and to the orphans of olllcers killed in the
discharge of duty. The recommendation
is also mado that a law be passed, fixing
the term of otllco for collectors of internal
revenue at four years, nnd that collectors
not be sub ject to removal except for such
uuses ns lire designated in the law. Iho
