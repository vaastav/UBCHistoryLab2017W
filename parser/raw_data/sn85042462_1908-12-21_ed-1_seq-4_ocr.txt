TEACHERS' TOUR
EEADERS of The Herald are voting
for twelve teachers who will
visit the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific ex
position as guests of this paper. The
exposition will be held at Seattle,
Wash., June 1 to October 15, 1909. It
will cost $10,000,000, and will be the
greatest enterprise of its nature which
the western coast has ever attempted.
To visit it will be a liberal additional
education to anyone, no matter how
well educated she or he may have been
before.
,": As educators cannot be too well edu
cated, we think all who are interested
in education will agree with us a teach
ers' tour to the great exposition will
I have a most beneficial effect, not only
on the teachers, but on the pupils who
will later receive the benefit of the
knowledge acquired by the teachers.
The announcement of the contest will
be found on another page, and with it
is a ballot-coupon. Write the name of
the teacher of your choice on this cou
pon and send it to The Herald office.
Your candidate may be successful, and
"a vote is a vote." When it Is so easy
to vote, use your ballot.
The exposition party will be com
posed of six school teachers from Los
Angeles county—three from the city
" and three from the county at large
, outside the city: and one In each In
stance from San Bernardino, Orange,
Santa Barbara, Riverside, Kern and
Ventura counties.
Teachers form the most helpful class
in the community. They are never
overpaid for their services, and some
, times they are underpaid. We owe
them a debt of gratitude, and members
of the public, by voting for "delegates"
to the exposition, will do something to
ward paying this debt. If you are In
terested in the success of any teacher,
you should not be contented with send
ing in your own votes. You should
organize and conduct a campaign.
Send or come to The Herald office for
subscription blanks, and go to work
among your friends. As yet it is "any
body's contest," and hard work for any
candidate may put her among the for
tunate- dozen.
FOREFATHERS' DAY
THIS is "Forefathers' day." Grand
old New England and every New
7 England society and every son of
New England ln the United States will
celebrate It. It is a long time since
"the. breaking waves dashed high on
a /stern ' and . roekbound coast," Mid
if the Pilgrim fathers had been scared
by. the roekbound coast or the dashing
breakers or the great trees tossing their
giant 1 branches, it is hardly likely we
would have.been in California today.
. .'Every state in the Union is interested
in New England's "Forefathers' day,"
not only because In every state of the
Union there are sons of New England,
but because all .Americans realise the
significance': of the work of the great
hearted, dauntless, strong willed "Fore
fathers" in the making of the United
States.
AMERICAN RIGHTS
ACCORDING to our appreciative
and highly esteemed contempor
ary the, Brawley News, "the Los
Angeles Herald has set & halo on the
heads of all the profession in Its unique
and winning tight for the p*or and
neglected element of that city. St.
Peter will wink with both eyes at once
when The Herald tries to pass." This
deserves a word of comment. The
fight we are making is in line with our
present policy, which, as we have fre
quently told our readers, is an asser
tion of the first principles of Amer
icanism, which compel us to believe
ALL men are created EQUAL, that
they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights, that among
these are life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness. We believe interference
with these rights to a large extent was
responsible, not only for the Repub
lican panic, but for much of the pov
erty and distress of which in recent
years more has been heard and more
seen in the United States than ever
before ln recorded history. Washing
ton's soldiers starved at Valley
Forge, and starvation attended some
of the sieges conducted during
the War of the Rebellion, but never
in the peaceful and civil history of the
United States, when Its liberties were
not menaced or interfered with by
armed foes, had starvation claimed as
many victims. This starvation was the
result of disorderly social conditions,
which had paralyzed some Industries
and had disorganized the finances of
the people.
These disorderly social conditions
proceeded from a contemptuous dis
regard of the first principles of Amer
icanism exhibited by certain so-called
magnates, among whom we must In
clude some of the traitors to their
country who dined in purple and fine
linen with Taft the other day, while
the bread line was still on Broadway,
New York, where the snow is begin
ning to Jly. We should have thought
they would have been unable to swal
low their food. We should have
thought It would have choked them,
but they seemed to be and doubtless
are sublimely unconscious of the very
serious fact that in the modern history
of Industrialism In the United States
"there ls a history of repeated Injuries
and usurpations, all having in direct
object the establishment of an absolute
industrial tyranny over the States."
That tyranny is already to a great ex
tent established. Every prodigiously
rich beneficiary of the system which
robs children of education and spreads
disease, starvation and death among
the poorer CLASSES of this "free"
nation, where class is a crime, is a
traitor to Americanism. Taft will
have to be a cautious and sagacious
chief executive, or during his term of
office there will be an assertion of
Americanism that may amount to a
crisis. ' j
JURY DUTY
JUDGE WILBUR gave an Illumi
nating and instructive address to
the members of the City club on
the question of changes in criminal
procedure. He thinks Judges have
permitted too great latitude in cross
examination, and says they frequently
"allow a witness to be badgered and
browbeaten and Insulted by attorneys
In violation of the plain duty imposed
upon them by the law and by the very
fact of their position." He says one
of the most important changes which
can be made in criminal practice Is In
the matter of instructing Juries. He
made the criticism that in very many
cases instructions are given to Juries
in such a way that they do not com
prehend at all the meaning of the
court, and he added: "I think in our
effort to state the law, and not to state
the facts or conclusions based upon
the facts, because of frequent re
versals for so doing, we have struck
the pendulum to the other extreme."
All citizens who have done Jury duty
will feel grateful to Judge Wilbur for
an outspoken assertion of a fact which
for various reasons they might per
haps be reluctant to acknowledge. We
believe it ls true that sometimes a
Judge's charge will befog a Jury the
members of which have followed the
course of a case with the ordinary
business intelligence and aptitude for
the discernment of actualities which
characterize our clear-headed Amer
ican citizenship.
To expect a man to conduct commer
cial transactions day in and day out
and then suddenly to acquire, as
if by Intuition, a sagacious and
exact knowledge of legal technicalities,
is asking "Just a little too much." To
enlighten a Juror explicitly and sim
ply as to every technicality or tor
tuosity Which may puzzle him .might
sometimes almost require the services
of an Interpreter.
NATION'S AWAKENING
AT LAST the sultan of Turkey is
popular. Abdul Hamid, the whi
lom "monster of iniquity," * who
by a British member of parliament
was nicknamed Abdul the Damned, is
now a reformed and universally es

this amazing change of sentiment?
Abdul has learned to trust his people.
Despot no longer, hut constitutional

tion with good grace, and the American

SHOP EARLY
CITIZENS who have not already
done their Christmas shopping
should attend to It early ln the
day and early in the week. One of the
best methods of showing the Christmas
spirit is to have consideration for the
store clerks, delivery men and errand
boys. Do not put off until tomorrow
the shopping you can do today. Christ
mas shopping has often become so
strenuous toward the clcse of the time
In which purchases may be made that
the Christmas joy of the workers has
been turned into pain. No one has any
right to rob another of Christmas. It
is the universal holiday which should
"make the whole world kin." If you
would enjoy Christmas do not be one
of those who heedlessly or carelessly—
not willingly or malevolently—make
Christmas miserable for their fellow
human beings, the store attendants and
other employes. Long before Christ
mas eve all your purchases should be
made and most of them mailed. A
rush during the last week makes life
miserable for postofflce employes as
well as for store clerks.
Really, friends, WE HAVE NO
RIGHT TO INTERFERE WITH OUR
NEIGHBOR'S ENJOYMENT OF
CHRISTMAS. He or she is as much
entitled to a happy holiday as you or
I. If you have not bought all the pres
ents you intend to give, get right up
after reading this article and go out
and do your duty by completing your
Christmas shopping TODAY. DO IT
NOW. Then when you hear the choir
caroling—
Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born king,
your conscience won't prick you, for if
there are any stories ln the newspapers
about fainting or dying store em
ployes, sacrificed to the last-hour rush
of Christmas shopping, you will know
you had no part in the.barbarous out
rage.
RAILROAD TAX
AT the New Year the railroads pro
pose to tax California industries
and products by making an ar
bitrary and unwarranted Increase of
freight rates. Some railroad magnates
were tempest tossed during the Repub
lican financial storm and the earnings
of their roads were not up to the av
erage. It has become a tradition with
the railroads that there must be big
profits and dividends, otherwise the
enterprise; is not a "success," and it is
the fact that in order to provide proflts
the, public Is expected to pay more
than the cost of hauling, which gives
plausibility to the contention of those
who assert it is time the railroad!
were put on a somewhat similar basis
to the postofflce service and taken un
der national control.
In an Ideal republic, it is urged,
transportation would be conducted on
the theory It is a public necessity and
therefore not necessarily governed al
together by the ordinary commercial
laws of supply and demand. In fact,
under circumstances which railroads
are about to demonstrate, they may
actually Interfere with the laws of sup
ply and demand and upset the econom
ical balance by Introducing an abnor
mal and unnecessary condition.
There is no reason why California
should be taxed'for the benefit of the
coffers of the railroad magnates who
are the ultimate and inevitable bene
ficiaries of the great sum derivable
from an increase in rates.
All persons who have cut their wis
dom teeth know there is only a thin
veneer of truth over the statement
that the public owns the railroads,
"because there are hundreds of share
holders." The smaller shareholders
were not thought of by Harriman and
his associates when they adopted a
new rate schedule. Harriman is not a
philanthropist. . His best ' friend is
Harriman and he is always willing to
do more for him than for any other
human being in the world. Some men
have become famous for self-sacrifice,
but the self devotion' of Harriman
makes him a pathetically: grand ■ and
noble figure in the American Valhalla.
Joyous Season at Washington
WORLD TRUST
A WORLD TRUST Is being formed
by copper producers, refiners and
manufacturers. The copper In
dustries of the eastern and western
hemispheres will be combined ln such
a manner that they will transact busi
ness co-operatively and regulate pro
duction to suit the market —in other
words, they will give an example of
something resembling Socialism In
every respect excepting one, which of
course is highly important. Profit
taking by the "heads" of the various
concerns will be continued. The reg
ulated association will not be conducted
for the benefit of mankind, but for the
benefit of a few exploiters.
Whether civilization will permit this
trust to operate on the extensive scale
proposed remains to be seen, but pre
vious experiences show civilization will
probably not Interfere excepting per
haps in the United States, where an
academic and oratorical campaign may
be conducted against the great trust.
This campaign will not really hurt the
business of the copper octopus, but
Will give it some of the advertising for
which under ordinary conditions it
would hay 3 to spend some of its
money. It will also provide an excuse
for retaining an attorney at an enor
mous salary and way be responsible
for various other minor philanthropies
of that kind. But the operation of the
trust and its influence in the business
world will not be disturbed. There is
only one way in which civilization can
deal effectively with the trust ques
tion, and that is by owning the trusts —
a step for which even the United
States, with more advanced views and
methods than any other nation, is far
from being prepared.
Health Officer Powers says germs
should be kept from getting into milk,
and not destroyed after they are in
the milk. This sounds like the clear
common sense which characterizes all
of Dr. Powers' teachings on sanitary
subjects. His language on the subject
is not scientific. There isn't a three
foot word ln his review of the milk
and microbes question. But everybody
understands it, and after all, even in
a "learned discussion this 'condition
has its merits.
Next Sunday a big mass meeting

Presidents' Names Are Used
Freely by Town Founders
RECENT destruction by Are of the
town of Taft, In Montana, which
aside from that calamalty had
dwindled greatly in population and was
said to be a frontier town of "tough
repute," suggests that even a president
may not always be flattered by tho
places named In his honor. Prominent
men differ greatly ln their "luck" in
this particular. Gen. Denver, not a
great historical character, lived to see
the city named for him the most sub
stantial In a great section, whereas
many presidents and other national
leaders have had no town, mountain,
lake or pass named for them important
enough to be recalled by any person
ordinarily well informed. The older
presidents, the towns named In their
honor profiting by a century's growth,
are better oft In this particular than
the later ones. Madison, Wis.; Monroe,
Mich., and Jackson, Miss., are better
known than any Hayes, Garfield, Arthur
or Grant that appears on the map, says
the Boston Transcript.
Our federal capital ls the greatest
city named ln honor of a president.
Cleveland, the largest city bearing a
presidential name, may centuries hence
be thought of as named for Grover, in
stead of Moses. This may be one of
the catch questions of 2508. The

other states, appropriately bear the

AN APPRECIATION OF MERCY;
A RETROSPECT AND APPEAL
LOS ANGELES, Dec -[Editor
Herald]: Hats off and heartiest Christ
mas greetings to Judge Jamison—
Judge who has the best kind of cour
age; the courage to be humane and
merciful in a court whose traditions in
an opposite direction would have ren
dered it so fatally easy to be heartless
and severe. I do not know Judge
Jamison even by sight, and I have not
had my attention drawn to the general
character of his sentences; but cer
tainly he ls on right lines In his action
in granting a probationary term to a
young man convicted of highway rob
bery. It was a flrst offense; the mans
record was not a bad one, and he had
a young wife and two small children.
Taking all into consideration the Judge,
like a mar (and not like an iron ma
chine for crushing the bones of its vic
tims) took the better part of mew
as well as of reason and placed the (
prisoner on probation for five years.
Mercy and kindness, like curses and
cruelty, come home to roost; and I
predict for Judge Jamison the peace
of mind that comes of a good act, ana
complete Justification of his leniency
in the future good conduct of'the con
victed man, not to mention the bless
ing and prayers of the wife.
Now, a word more: Just a year ago
-for I remember noting it as a 'Christ
mas" sentence—a man (named White, I
think) was sentenced by Judge Jami
son's predecessor for » crime Blmltarto
the one above noticed, The accused
was said to be an old .soldier,.and des
titute, with no known blemish on his
record. The Judge himself commended
him for his candor in confessing and
saving the court and police all trouble
and said, "I will take this Into con
sideration" Yet he gave what I must
call the STAGGERING SENTENCE
OF FIFTEEN YEARS. "-'■"'_
Who will show their Christmas good
will by co-operating with me (through
The Herald) to urge the powers that be
iperhaps Judge Jamison would lend
the weight of his recommendation— for
a commutation of that dreadful sen
tenCe? A MAN AND A BROTHER.

SAYS PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
SHOULD BE MUCH DISCUSSED
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 18.—[Editor
Herald]* I have noticed with pleasure
two criticisms of the President's mes
sage at the reassembling of congress
and I have regretted that there were
only two. for President Roosevelt is
a great thought-stirrer and what he
says. is well worth consideration _
To me. and to those who believe as
I do. that the multiplication of offi
l cials is a curse; to all who watch with
anxiety tho gigantic dimensions to

, all who hold that government is com
pulsory force, the very antithesis of
freedom, the direction in which our
civilization should , grow, the presi

1 that is fraught with disaster to us and
our children. But he presses his case
. with admirable boldness and he af
fords us the rare spectacle of a man
who Is not afraid to say what he
I am firm in the belief that as the
result of this outspokenness the
country will understand before long
that what Mr. Roosevelt wants Is _ a
gigantic bureaucracy, with an auto
crat at its head—as, indeed, every bu
reaucracy always has had and always
must have—and that the masses will
comprehend that of all the.masters

probably the best known of the name
sakes of the author of the Louisiana

have each a Jefferson. Grant pass Is
doubtless the most conspicuous of the
geographical terms which recall the
eighteenth president, Just as Mount
McKinley, the highest elevation on the
North American continent, gives the
twenty-fourth president his best- posi
tion in the geographies. The Roosevelt
dam, the greatest piece of engineering
in connection .with the country s irri
gation experiment, is prominent among
the objects which bear our present
executive's name.
It ls to be hoped that President Taft
will have something worth while named ,
in his honor before long. One presi
dent made it a rule to have a polite
acknowledgment sent to any parents
who reported that they had named ft
child in his honor, but to pay no atten
tion to missives, though plainly writ
ten in good faith, conveying the intelli
gence that his name has been bestowed
on a favorite dog, horse, revolver or.
motor boat. Even some honors must
be accepted grudgingly. Samuel Bowles
wrote, half a century ago that It was a
poor compliment to the father of the
country to have the northwestern cor
ner of the country named for him, but
this was one of the Instances where
Samuel proved a poor prophet. Per
haps Taft, Mont., may yet be famous
for Its boulevards and cathedrals.
SUGGESTION PURELY NATURAL
PHENOMENON OF THE MIND
LOS ANGELES, Dec. [Editor
Herald]: Ever since man became a
self-conscious animal ho has asked
three questions: "Who am I?" "Where
am I?" "Where am I going?" And
there has been a class of folk •to an
swer"for a consideration," because
man has ever been willing to pay hand
somely for the answers.
Messrs. Hobbes, Clodd and other
authorities tell us that all primitive
religion grows out of man's fear and
ignorance of natural phenomena.. "It
was fear that first created the gods.''
Primitive man did not understand
shadows, eclipses, thunder, dreams,
etc., and attributed them to supernat
ural entities, spirits, etc. He assumed
himself the central point of the uni
verse, as children always overestimate
their own importance. Science gradu
ally explained these things to a degree,
but as man developed mentally his
fears took on a more psychical aspect.
This fear of the unknown, however,
dominates all religions even today more
or leys, a variety of labels notwith
standing.
When we flrst heard of suggestion,
hypnotism, mental therapeutics, we
were afraid and called them the works
of the devil. (Some do yet.)
But when Mrs. Eddy studied psychic
phenomena (mental healing) from P.
P. Quimby, she evidently understood
this human weakness or fear of the
unknown, the mysterious, and sho
banked on It. Accordingly she Incor
porated it upon Christianity, and took
advantage of the uncertain meaning of
the scriptures to prove her claims.
Humanity drifts along lines of least
resistance, for It Is much easier to be
lieve than to reason, especially when
one learns "to deny what we perceive
materially."
Whatever good Christian Science ac
complishes is not due to its tenets,
but In spite of them. Sugestion—a nat
ural phenomenon of the mindwith Its
finite and material limitations, is the
force that does it.

SAYS CLAIM OF SUGGESTION
IS A FORM OF HYPNOTISM
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 17— [Editor
Herald].* Asbury Cecil evinces a dis
position to concede that mind is con
trolling power. In order to be con
vinced we have got to have a' clear
understanding and a logical promise to
work from.
It Is Illogical to reason that mind is
the Intelligence of matter, for matter
has no Intelligence, to be that It would
have to be In matter and therefore
under matter's control.
The belief of Intelligence in matter
Is "the one evil or evil one" which is
the error of the ages, and the cause
of every Inharmonious experience. Hell
has Its Inception and continuation In
this concept.
If we have that mind (God) ln us
which was also in Christ Jesus, which
meant a knowledge of his allness and
reasoning therefrom, therefore a denial
of every other concept of life or action,
a prayer so grounded In faith anil
demonstration that would enable us to
practice the Golden Rule and see golden
results follow we must proceed from
this basis, not with a theoretical carnal
or negative impulse but with scientific
conviction which brooks no sense of
opposition.
The mortal claim of suggestion—thn
semblance of mind or intelligence in
matter counterfeiting the omnlpotenc«
and omniscience of mind is a mild form
of hypnotism which in its aggressive
or malicious forms Is pure diabolism,
capable of untold evil, a corruption of
the truth which alone enables us "to
do unto others whatsoever we would
have them do unto us."
The forces Imputed to matter men-,
tioned by Asbury Cecil belong to mind,
but like the consciousness which sees
snakes in delerlum their nature seems
at times perverted, and thus manifest-
In phenomenal disturbances —so-called
nature hypnotised by mortal conscious
ness, if I might so explain it. But
divine law always rights things, prov
ing evil's temporality. R. N. /'
SAYS ARGUMENT AGAINST *
SEX EQUALITY IS FOOLISH
SOUTH PASADENA. Dec. 16.—[Ed
itor Herald]: I have for some months
taken a great Interest in the Public
Letter Box, especially in the letters
written on Socialism. Socialism to me
means stagnation, or, worse still, going
backward, because it does not take,
Into consideration human nature.
* While It promises bread to the indo
lent and money to the lazy, amd good
clothes to the shiftless, It offers noth
ing better to the thlrfty, the persever
ing, the intelligent and the ambitious.
Socialism offers no opportunity to rise
above the general level of the masses.
A3 it promises to all a good living, it
really means that the best workers
will have to keep the thirftless and
lazy in good food and clothing, where
as under present conditions, if , the
masses will only vote Intelligently for
straight, men every one has a chance
to work, and those who are ambitious
have a chance to rise and to assert his
or her individuality. >-, ■
Under socialism, they will Just be a
cog, in a state wheel, ■ working longer
hours because a vast army of ne'er-do
wells have to be 'kept on full pay, In
stead of on short rations.
