effectively with "those persons who
by violent methods would abrogate
our time-tested institutions."
Bring Down Prices
Several recommendations, some
renewals of previous ones, were
made by the President to bring
down the cost of living. Among
them were extension of the food
control law to peace times for the
emergency; regulations for transpor
tation of foods in interstate com
merce: a cold storage law modeled
after the law in New Jersey; a law
requiring marks to show the length
of time foods are kept in storage
and a law to secure "competitive
selling and prevent unconscionable
profits," by Federal license of cor
porations selling food in interstate
commerce.
I.ong I<abor Discussion
A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the con
dition and rights of labor. "A defi
nite program to bring about an im
provement in the conditions of labor '
and bring about a genuine democ
ratization of industry was recom
mended.
"The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances is to re
move the grievances," said the Pres
ident's message. At another point
it declared "the seed of revolution
is repression."
"The establishment of the prin
ciples regarding labor, laid down in
the covenant of the League of Na
tions," said the message, "offers us
the way to industrial peace and con
ciliation. No other road lies open
to us. • • • Governments must
recognize the right of men to bar
gain collectively for human objects.
• • • Labor must no longer be
treated as a commodity.
"The right of individuals to strike
is inviolable," continued the mes
sage, and ought not to be interfered
with by any process of government,
but there is a predominant right,
and that is the right of the govern
ment to protect all of its people and
to assert its power and majesty
against the challenge of any class."
The President wa.s referring to the
government's recent injunction
against the coal strike.
Russia an Object lesson
The message closed with a point
ed reference to radicalism and Red
doctrines and referred to "Russia
to-day with its blood and terror" as
a "painful object lesson of the power
of minorities."
"There are those in this country."
said the message, "who threaten di
rect action to force their will upon
a majority. • • • It makes little
difference what minority it is;
whether capital or labor, or any
other class, no sort of privilege will
ever be permitted to dominate this
country."
Orderly processes, the message
declared, were the only ones by
which relief and reform could be
obtained.
"Those who would propose any
other method of reform are enemies
of this country," the message said.
• * * "L<et those beware who take
the shorter road of disorder and rev
olution."

TUESDAY EVENING,
Text of President's
Message to Congress
[Continued from First Page.]
increased prices have increased their
value. On the other hand, she has
purchased a large proportion of the
American securities previously held
abroad, and loaned some $0,000,000.-
000, to foreign governments and
has built her own shjps. Our fa
vorable balance of trade has thus
been greatly increased and Europe
has been deprived of the means of
meeting it heretofore existing. Eu
rope can have only three ways of
meeting the favorable balance ot
trade in peacetimes:
Must Find Outlet
By imports into this country of
gold or of goods, or by establish
ing new credits. Europe is in no
position at the present time to ship
gold to us nor could we contemplate
large further imports of gold into
this country without concern. The
time has nearly passed for interna
tional governmental loans, and it
will take time to develop in this
country a market for foreign securi
ties. Anything, therefore, which
would tend to prevent foreign coun
tries front settling for our exports
by shipments of goods into this
country could only have the effect
of preventing them from paying for
our exports and therefore of pre
venting the exports from being made.
The productivity of the country,
greatly stimulated by the war, must
find an outlet by exports to for
eign countries, and any measures
taken to prevent imports will inevi
tably curtail exports, force curtail
ment of production, load the bank
ing machinery of the country with
credits to carry unsold products ard
produce industrial stagnation and
unemployment. If we want to sell,
we must be prepared to buy. What
ever, therefore, may have been our
views during the period of growth
of American business concerning
tariff legislation, we must now ad-
Just our economic life to changed
conditions growing out of the fact
that American business is full
grown and that America is the great
est capitalist in the world.
Against Isolation
No policy of isolation will satisfy
the growing needs and opportuni
ties of America. The provincial
standards and policies of the past,
which have held American business
as if in a strait jacket, must yield
and give way to the needs and exi
gencies of the new day in which we
live, a day full of hope and prom
ise for American business, if we will
but take advantage of the oppor
tunities that are ours for the ask
ing. The recent war has ended our
great duty. The United States must
share the expanding world markets.
The United States desires for itself
only equal opportunity with the
other nations of the world and that
through the process of friendly co
operation and fair competition, the
legitimate interests of the nations
concerned may be sticcessfully and
equitably adjusted.
Urges Soldiers' Relief
There are other matters of im
portance upon which I urged action
at the last session of Congress which
are still pressing for solution. I am
sure it is not necessary lor me again
to remind you that there is one im
mediate and very practicable ques
tion resulting from the war, which
we should meet in the most liberal
spirit. It is a matter of recognition
and relief to our soldiers. I can do
no better than to quote from my last
message urging this very action:
"We must see to it that our re
turning soldiers are assisted in every
practicable way to find the places
for which they are fitted in the daily
work of the country. This can be
done by developing and maintaining
Wipon an adequate scale the admir
able organization created by the De
partment of Labor for placing men
I seeking work; and it can also be
done, in at least one very grent field,
by creating new opportunities for
individual enterprise. The Secretary
of the Interior has pointed out the
way by which returning soldiers may
be helped to find and take up land
in the hitherto undeveloped regions
of the country which the Federal
government has already prepared or
can readily prepare for cultivation
and also on many of the cut-over or
neglected areas which lie within the
limits of the older states; and I once
more take the liberty of recom
mending very urgently that his plans
shall receive the immediate and sub
stantial support of the Congress.'*
Touches on Tariff
In the matter of tariff legislation,
I beg to call your attention to the
statements contained in my last
message urging legislation with ref
erence to the establishment of the
chemical and dyestuffs industry in
i America:
Among the industries to which
special consideration should be given
is that of the manufacture of dye
stuffs and related chemicals. Our
complete dependence upon German
supplies before the war made the in
terruption of trade a cause of ex
ceptional economic disturbance. The
close relation between the manufac
ture of dyestuffs, on the one hand,
and of explosives and poisonous
gases on the other, moreover, has
given the industry an exceptional
significance and value. Although the
United Sttaes will gladly and unhesi
tatingly join in the program of in
ternational disarmament, it will,
nevertheless, be a policy of obvious
prudence to make certain of the suc
cessful maintenance of many strong
and well-equipped chemical plants.
The German chemical industry, with
which we will be brought into com
petition was. and may well be again,
a thoroughly knit monoply capable
of exercising a competition of a pe
' culiarly insidious and dangerous
! kind."
Encourage Farmer
During the war the farmer per
| formed a vital and willing service to
I the nation. By materially increasing
the production of his land, he sup
plied America and the Allies with
the increased amounts of food nec
| essary to keep their immense armies
]in the field. He indispensably help
!ed to win the war. But there is now
; scarcely less need of increasing the
production in food and the necessi
ties of life. I ask the Congress to
consider means of encouraging ef
forts along these lines. The import
ance of doing everything possible to
promote production along economi
cal lines, to improve marketing and
to make rural life more attractive
and healthful, is obvious. I would
urge approval of the plans already
proposed to the Congress by the
I Secretary of Agriculture, to secure
the essential facts required for the
proper study of this question.
Harrisburg TELEGRAPH
'through the proposed enlarged pro
grams for farm management studies
and crop estimates. I would urge
also, the continuance of Federal par
ticipation in the building of good
roads, under the terms of existing
law and under the direction of pres
ent agencies; the need of further
action on the part of the states and
the Federal government to preserve
and develop our forest resources, es
pecially through the practice of bet
ter forestry methods on private hold
ings and the extension of the public
ly owned forests; better support for
country schools and the most defi
nite direction of their courses of
study along lines related to rural
provision for sanitation in rural dis
tricts and the building up of needed
hospital and medical facilities in
these localities. Perhaps the way
might be cleared for many of these
desirable reforms by a fresh, com
prehensive survey made of rural
conditions by a conference composed
of representatives of the farmers
and of the agricultural agencies re
sponsible for leadership.
Political Restlessness
I would call your attention to the
widespread condition of political
restlessness in our body politic. The
causes of this unrest, while various
and complicated, are superficial
rather than deep seated. Broadly
they arise from or are connected
.with the failure on the part of our
government to arrive speedily at a
just and permanent peace permit
ting return to normal conditions,
from the transfusion of radical the
ories from seething Europeun cen
ters pending such delay, from heart
less profiteering resulting in the in
crease of the cost of living, and last
ly from the machinations of pas
sionate and malevolent agitators.
With the return to normal condi
tions, this unrest will rapidly dis
appear. In the meantime, it does
much evil. It seems to me that in
dealing with this situation Congress
should not be Impatient or drastic
but should seek rather to remove the
cause.
Speedy Return to Peace
It should endeavor to bring our
country back speedily, to a peace
basis with ameliorated living' condi
tions under the minimum of restric
tions upon personal llherty that is
consistent with our reconstruction
problems. And it s.hould arm the
Federal government' with power to
deal in its criminal courts with those
persons who by violent methods
would abrogate our time-tested in
stitutions. With the free expression
of opinion and with the advocacy of
orderly political change, however
fundamental, there must be no in
terference, towards passion and
malevolent tendency to incite
crime and insurrection under guise
of political evolution there should be
no leniency. Legislation to this end
has been recommended by the At
torney General and should be en
acted. In this direct connection T
would call your attention to my
recommendations on August S,
pointing out legislative measures
which would be effective in controll
ing and bringing down the present
cost of living, which contributes so
largely to this unrest. On only one
of these recommendations has the
Congress acted. If the government's
campaign is to be affective, it is
necessary that the other steps sug
gested should be actecf on at once.
Extend Fo<xl Control
I renew and strongly urge the
necessity of the extension of the
present food control act as to the
period of time in which it shall re
main in bperation. The Attorney
General has submitted a bill pro
viding for an extension of this act
foi a period of six months. As it
now stands it is limited in operation
to the period of the war and be
comes inoperative upon the formal
proclamation of peace. It is im
perative that it should be extended
at once. The Department of Justice
lias built up extensive machinery for
the purpose of enforcing its pro
visions; all of which must be aban
doned upon the conclusion of peace
unless the provisions of this act are
extended.
Publicity an Aid
During this period the Congress
will have an opportunity to make
similar, permanent provisions and
regulations with regard to all goods
destined for interstate commerce
and to exclude them from interstate
shipment, if the requirements of the
law are not complied with. Some
such regulation is imperatively nec
essary. The abuses that have grown
up in the manipulation of prices by
the withholding of foodstuffs and
other necessaries of life cannot oth
erwise be effectively prevented. There
can be no doubt of either the ne
cessity or the legitimacy of such
measures.
As I pointed out in my last mes
sage, publicity can accomplish a
great deal in this campaign. The
aims of the government must be
clearly brought to the attention of
the consuming public, civic organi
zations and state officials who are
in a position to lend their assist
ance to our efforts. You have made
available funds with which to carry
on this campaign but there is no
provision in the law authorizing
their expenditure for the purpose of
making the public fully informed
about the of the government.
Specific recomntendation has been
made by the Attorney General in
this regard. I would strongly urge
upon you its immediate adoption, as
it constitutes one of the preliminary
steps to this campaign.
Regulate Cold Storage
I also renew my recommenda
tions that tl# Congress pass a law
regulating cold storage, as it is reg-*
ulated, for example, by the laws of
the State of New Jersey, which limit
the time during which goods may
be kept in storage, prevents the
method of disposing of them if kept
beyond the permitted period and
require that the goods released from
storage shall in all cases bear the
date of their receipt. It would ma
terially add to the serviceability of
the law, for the purpose we now have
in view, if it were also prescribed
that all goods released from stor
age for Interstate shipment should
have plainly marked upon each
package the selling or market price
at which they went into storage.
By this means the purchaser would
always be able to learn what profits
stood between him and the producer
or the wholesale dealer.
First Fricc Marked
I would also renew my recom
mendation that goods destined for
Interstate commerce should in every
case, where their form or package
makes it possible, be plainly marked
with the price at which they left the
hands of the producer.
We should formulate a law re
quiring a Federal license of all cor
porations engaged In interstate com
merce and embodying in the License,
the conditions under which IT is to
be Issued, specific regulations design
ed to secure competitive selling and
prevent unconscionable profits in the
method of marketing. Such a law
would afford a welcome opportunity
to affect other much-neded reforms
in the business of interstate ship
ment and in the methods pf corpora
tions which as-e engaged in it; but
for the moment I confine mp recom.
mendatlons to the object immedi
ately in hand, which is to lower the
cost of living.
Remove Grievances
No one who has observed the
march of events in the last yeur can
fail to note the übsolute need of a
definite program to bring about an
Improvement in the conditions of
labor. There can be no settled con
ditions leading to increased produc
tion and a reduction in the cost of
living if labor and capital ure to be
antagonistic instead of partners.
Sound thinking and an honest de
sire to serve the interests of the
whole nation, as distinguished from
the interests of a class, must be ap
plied to the solution of this great and
pressing problem. The failure of
other nations to consider this mat
ter in a vigorous way has produced
bitterness and Jealousies and the
food of radicalism. The only way to
keep men from agitation against
grievances is to remove the griev
ances. The unwillingness even to
discuss these matters produces only
dissatisfaction and gives comfort to
the extreme eleihents in our country
which endeavor to stir up disturb
ances in order to provoke govern
ments to embnrk upon a course of
retaliation and repression. The seed
of revolution is repression. The rem
edy for these things must not be
negative in character. It must be
constructive. It must comprehend
the general interest. The real anti
dote for the unrest which manifests
itself is not suppression, but a deep
consideration of the wrong! that be
set our national life and the applica
tion of a remedy.
Democratization of Industry
Congress has already shown its
willingness to deal with these indus
trial wrongs by establishing the
eight-hour day as the standard in
every field of labor. It has sought to
find a way to prevent child labor. It
has served the whole country by
leading the way in developing the
means of preserving and safeguard
ing lives and health in dangerous
industries, it must now help in the
difficult task of finding a method
that will bring about a genuine
democratization of industry, based
on the full recognition of the right
of those who work, in whatever
rank, to participate in some organic
way in every decision which direct
ly affects their welfure. It is with
this purpqse in mind that I called
a conference to meet in Washington
on December 1 to consider these
problems in all their broad aspects,
with the idea of bringing about a
better understanding between these
two interests.
Plcnds With World Unrest
The great unrest throughout the
world, out of which has emerged a
demand for an immediate consider
ation of the difficulties between cap
ital and labor, bids us put our own
house in order. Frankly there can
be no permanent and lasting settle
ments between capital and labor
which do not recognize the funda
mental concept for which labor has
been struggling through the years.
The whole world gave its recogni
tion and endorsement to these fund
amental purposes in the League of
Nations. The statesmen gathered
at Versailles recognized the fact
that world stability could not be
had by reverting to industrial stand
ards and conditions against which
the average workmen of the world
had revolted. It is, therefore, the
task of the statesmen of this new
day of change and readjustment to
recognize world conditions and to
seek to bring about, through legis
lation, conditions that will mean the'
ending of age-long antagonisms be
tween capital and labor and that will

hopefully lead to the building up
of a comradeship which will result
not only in greater contentment
among the mass of workmen but
also bring about a greater produc
tion and a greater prosperity to busi
ness itself.
To analyze the particulars in the
demands of labor is to admit the
justice of their complaint in many
matters that lie at their basis. The
workman demands an ndequate
wage, sufficient to live in comfort,
unhampered by the fear of
and want in his old age. Ho demands
the right to live and the right to
work amidst sanitary surroundings,
both In home and in workshop, sur
roundings that develop and do not
retard his own health and well be
ing; and the right to provide for
his children's wants in the matter of
health and education. In other
words it is his desire to make the
conditions of his life and the lives
of those dear to him tolerable and
easy to bear.
Paves Way
The establishment ot the princi
ples regarding labor laid down in
the covenant of the League of Na
tions offers us the way to industrial
peace and conciliation. No other
road lies open to us. Not to pursue
this one is longer to invite enmities,
bitterness and antagonisms which in
the end only lead to industrial and
social disaster. The unwilling work
i man is not a profitable serveant. An
employe whose industrial life is
hedged about by hard and unjust
conditions, which he did not create
and over which he hus no control,
lacks that fine spirit of enthusiasm
and volunteer effort which are the
necessary Ingredients of great pro
ducing entity. Let us be frank about
this solemn matter. The evidences of
world-wide unrest which manifest
themselves in violence throughout
the world bid us pause and consider
the means to be found to stop the
spread of this contagious thing be
fore it saps the very vitality of the
nation itself. Do we gain strength
by withholding the remedy? Or is it
not the business of statesmen to
treat these manifestations of unrest
which meet us on every hand as
evidences of an economic disorder
and to apply constructive remedies
wherever necessary, being sure that
in the application of the remedy we
touch not the vital tissues of our in
dustrial and economic life? There
can be no recessions of the tide of
unrest until constructive instrumen
talities are set up to stem that tide.
Collective Bargaining
Governments must recognize the
right of men collectively to bargain
for humane objects that have at
their base the mutual protection and
welfare of those engaged in all in
dustries. Labor must not be longer
treated as a commodity. It ipust
be regarded as the activity of hu
man beings, possessed of deep yearn
i ings and desires. The businessman
gives his best thought to the re
pair and replenishment of his ma
chinery, so that its usefulness will
not be impaired and its power to
produce may. always be at its height
and kept in full vigor and motion.
No less regard ought to be paid
to the human machine, which after
all propels the machinery of the
world and is the great dynamic, force
that lies back of all industry and
progress. Return to the old stand
ards of wage and industry in em
ployment are unthinkable. The ter
rible tragedy of war which has just
ended and which has brought the
world to the verge of chaos and dis
aster would be in vain if there
should ensue a return to the condi
tions of the past. Eilrope, itself.
DECEMBER 2, 19T9. ~
whence has come the unrest which
now holds the world at bay, Is an
example of stnndpatism in these vi
tal human matters which America
might well accept as an example,
not to be followed but studiously
to be avoided. Europe made labor
the differential, and the price of
it all is enmity and antagonism and
prostrated industry. The right of
labor to live ill peace uul comfort
I must be recognized by governments
and America should be the first
to. lay the foundation stones upon
which industrial peace shall be
built.
Favor Both Sides
Labor not only is entitled to an
adequate wage, but capital should
receive a reasonable return upon its
investment and) is entitled to pro
tection at the hands of the govern
ment In every emergency. No gov
ernment worthy of the name can
"piny" the elements against each
other, for there is a mutuality ot
interest between them which the
government must seek to express
and to safeguard at alj cost.
Right to Strike Inviolate
The right of individuals to strike
is inviolate and ought not to be in
terfered with by any process of gov
ernment, but there is a predomi
nant right and that is the right of
the government to protect all of its
people and to assert its power and
majesty agofinst the challenge of
any class. The government, when it
asserts that right, seeks not to an
tagonize a class but simply to de
fend the right of the whole people
as against the irreparable harm and
injury that might be done by the
attempt by' any class to usurp a
power that only government itself
has a right to exercise as a protec
tion to all.
Establish Tribunal
In the matter of, international
disputes which have led to \Var,
statesmen have sought to set up as
a remedy arbitration for war. Does
this not point the way for the set
tlement of industrial disputes, by
the establishment of a tribunal fair
and just alike to nil, which will
settle industrial disputes which in
the past have led to war and dis
aster? America, witnessing the evil
consequences which have followed
out of such disputes between the
contending forces, must not admit
itself impotent to deal with these
matters by means of peaceful pro
cesses. Surely there must be some
method of bringing together in a
council of peace and amity these two
great interests, out of which will
come a happier day of peace and
co-operation, a day that will make
for more comfort and happiness in
living and a more tolerable condi
tion among all classes of men. Cer
tainly human intelligence can devise
some acceptable tribunal for ad
justing the differences between cap
ital and labor.
Hour of Test and Trinl
This is the hour of test and trial
for America. By her prowess and
strength and the indomitable cour
age of her soldiers, she demonstrat
ed her power to vindicate on foreign
battlefields her conception of liberty
and justice. Let not her influence
as a mediator between capital and
labor be weakened and her own
failure to settle matters of purely
i domestic concern be proclaimed to
I the world. There are those in this
country who threaten direct action
I to force their will upon a majority.
Russia to-day, with its blood and
terror, is a painful object lesson of
the power of minorities.
It makes little difference what'
minority it is—whether capital or
labor, or any other class—no sort of
privilege will ever be permitted to
dominate this country. We are a.
partnership or nothing that Is worth
while. We are a democracy, where
the majority are the masters, or all
the hopes and purposes of the men
who founded this government have
been defeated and forgotten. In
America there is but one way by
which great reforms can be accom
plished and the relief sought by
classes obtained, and that is through
the orderly processes of representa
tive government. Those who would
propose any other method of reform
are enemies of thi3 country.) Amer
ica will not be daunted by threats
nor lose her composure or calmness
in these distressing times. We can
afford, in the midst of this day of
passion ami unrest, to be self-con
tained and sure. The Instrument of
all reform in America is the straight
road of Justice to all classes and con
ditions of men. Men have but to
ffollow this road to realize the full
fruition of their objects and pur
poses. Let those beware who would
take the shorter road of disorder
aad revolution. The right road Is
[the road of justice and orderly pro
cess.
