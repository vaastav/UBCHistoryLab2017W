.Centralization.
Among -many voters In the recent
campaign, some fear was entertained
over possible evil consequences of a
so-called centralization of power in
the 'federal government. Some were
of the opinion that "centralization"
meant a robbery of local government,
corruption, class discrimination, decay.
The question was argued during
the campaign, but there are
many yet who entertain some fear of
i. "centralization of power" In our
government. In his last annual
message to Congress. President
Roosevelt devoted an interesting
lJWa>?ruji n lu cuts i|u?nw* ui w;utrallzatlon.
pointing out that not
more power. Is wanted or needed, but
;? tbe means of adequately using already
existing power in the proper.
.... channels, and this distinction should
be carefully considered by those to
g whom the question does not seem
?" quite clear.
i* Alter enumerating the measures
deemed "by him to be vitally necesKw
sary for the federal regulation of interstate
corporations. President
Roosevelt states:
"To accomplish this, means of
course a certain Increase in the use
, or?not the creation of?power, by
the Central Government. The power
already exists; It does not have to
be created: the only question Is
whether it shall he used or left Idle
?and meanwhile the corporations
over which the power .ought to be
exefclsed will not remain ldlo. Let
those 'Who abject to this Increase in
the use of the only power available,
the national power. l>e frank, and
admit openly that they propose to
abandon any effort to control the
great business corporations and to
exercise supervision over the accumulation
and distribution of wealth,
for such supervision and control can
oniy come inrougn mis puruuuiai
kind of increase of power. We no
more believe in that empiricism
which demands absolutely unrestrained
individualism than we do*
in that empiricism which clamors for
a deadening socialism which would
destroy all individual initiative and
would ruin the country with a com- ,
pjetoness that not oven an unrestrain- '
ed individualism itself could achieve.
The dapger to American -democracy
lies not In the least in the concen- ,
trutfon of administrative power in
responsible and accountable hands.
It lies in having the power insuflie- ,
icutly concentrated, so that no one
can he held responsible to the people
for its use. Concentrated power is
palpable, visible, responsible, easily
reached, quickly held to account.
Power scattered through many administrators.
many legislators, many
men who work behind and through
legislators 'and administrators, is Impalpable,
is unseen, is irresponsible,
can not 1>e reached, can not be held
to account. Democracy is In peril
wherever the administration of political
power Is scattered among a
yarlety of men who work In secret,
wfioon vorv namoB oro nnlf nnwn to
the common people. It is not in
peril from any man who derives authority
from the people, who exercises
it in sight of the people, and
who Is from time to time compelled
to give an account of its exercise to
the people.'*

"The unprecedented destruction
this season :by forest flrjjs in West
Virginia has called the attention of
the people, as never before, to the necessity
of better protection to woods

Commission. "The relationship

' "There...wore losses in manu-,

and other Improvements amounting <
to -$' 90,176. Tills year there was i
an unusually heavy damage to on- i
dergrowth sod soil, and this has ibe?n
placed at one dollar an sere for

$1,703,850 in the State. Those ?

an Interesting contrast -to the loss of r

are reported to- have spent to

to have apent about 389.000. i
"The injury to the soil from fire t
was much more severe this season In g
West Virginia than ever 'before, not
alone because the burned area was
larger than in any former year, hut
also for the reason that excessive r
dryness exposed the humus to a n
greater depth. Ground fires have li

by burning the tfiumus beneath the I
surface, and then started up on the a
farther side. The fires burned so b
deeply Ln the humus that an <un.usual ti
phenomenon was presented when a tl
snow fall came early in November.
The snow apparently extinguished
the fires, but It went away quickly
under the influence of a strong, dry ?
wind, and the fires came up and out V
of the -ground and were soon spread- o
ing again, il saw an interesting ex- ?
ample of -this. In the morning the ti
snow in the <woods was two inches ?

Before sunset'the snow was gone and ?
the leaves were burning. P
"Large tracts of land on the high si
mountains were denuded of soil n

the area where the Pottsville con- ^
glomerate is the surface formation, w
there never was much mineral soil, c
Beds of 'moss, lichen, leaves, and de- ft
caying wood formed a covering for tl
the rocks which gave anchorage to ii
the roots of the forest trees. Over
extensive tracts, soils of that kind
were absolutely destroj'ed."

coffee in order to vciake up the deficit
in the national revenue caused
by the prohibition wave that is
sweeping* over the country. It is C
questionable whether the American
people will stand for thi3 as it would
be hard to make the average man believe
that coffee Is a luxury at this

plan will be adopted before consideration
of Mr. Bartholdt's bill is reached.

are trying to raise a row because it
is believed Grafton is to have a fine a
