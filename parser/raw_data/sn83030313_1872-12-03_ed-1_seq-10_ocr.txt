COMTUUED FROM THIED PAGE.
Bo meet the appropriations. That portion referring
to the success of the Oenera arbitration Is appre
ciated by tho friends of the administration as re
fwclng over a diplomatic triumph. The President's
inference to the Ku Klux laws had been Hilly an
ticipated, and it Is understood that a portion of the
original draft was struck out lo revising the mes
sage. The President hap positive ideas, and wres
tles with himself sometimes before he yields to
policy. In the preparation of the work this year
be gave himseir no particular concern, it is said,
except that it might be regarded as eminently pa
cific by all classes, irrespective of politics or na
tionality. Civil service reform was gently disposed
?I, much to the surprise of its advocates and op
ponents. The allusion to the fact that the rules
would not be binding on his successors led a promi
nent democrat in the House to express the belief
that General Grant docs not expect to be Presi
dent forever. The Message will be printed and
distributed, and will be exceedingly valuable three
months hence, as giving an Idea of what bis inaugu
ral will be on the 4th of March, 1873.

Yonr telegram was received last night. The
President had determined as early as last Satur
day to attend Mr. Greeley's iuneral, if the day
fixed should be one on which he could properly be
absent from the capital. He is still of the same
mind, and will attend on Wednesday, if Ills public

Carping at the President's Motives.
The partisans of this administration take excep
tion to the President's motives in proposing to at
tend tne funeral of Mr. Greeley. They are gene
rally distinguished from the class recognized as
Statesmen by their exalted opinion of thomselves
or their high appreciation or their own services in
the campaign. The President, on the other hand,
expresses the opinion that it is a sorrowful duty
which ftg will perform shouljl jiublic business uot

eeat on the Bench of the Supreme Court to which
lie was appointed by President Tyler In 1846, he

Southern States will naturally claim, as there has
been no Southerner on the Bench of the Supreme

In view of the reccnt death of Horace Orecley, for whom
.at the late election more than three million votes were
cant lor Presld-nt. that a record lie made on the Journals
ot t'onKTuM of appreciation for the eminent services and
personal purity and worth of the deceased and of the sad
Impression created by his death following a keen family
bereavement
Mr. Cox, of New York, rose and said:?
Mr. hpkakkk?I desire to add a word to the reso
I lulion of condolence and sympathy ottered by my
i triend from Massachusetts. I have the honor to
i reside in the city ol New York, once represented by
Mr. Greeley In the American Congress. This House
lias heard with profound sorrow of the tragical
death of one or Its most illustrious citizens, Horace
Greeley. Ills demise creates a void impossible
to All in American journalism. society and lire.
His remarkable services were illustrated by prac
tical charities, enlarged benevolence, earnest
thought and Independent expression. In the va
rious qualities of mind and character he is an ex
ample of and incentive to that sturdy seU-relfance
and unresting enterprise which distinguish Ameri
can manhood. Therefore It is eminently just,
gentle and wise that, at the sad termination or his
long and useiul career, we should make public
recognition of this event.
The resolution was unanimously adopted.
IANK8 AND THB FOREIGN AFFAIRS CHAIRMANSHIP.
Mr. Banks, (lib.) of Mass., rose aud offered his

Mr. Hhoobh, (<ien.) of N. Y.( said be hoped that

THE SPEAKER RISKS TO RXPLA1N.
Mr- Blaine, having called Mr. Cox to the chair as
Speaker pro (an., took the floor, and said
Mr. Hpkaker? 1 rise to a question of the highest
privilege, one that concerns the Integrity of mem
hern of the House and the honor of this House it
ttclf. During the late Presidential campaign there
wan a widespread accusation to the effect tliat
members of Congress had been bribed by presents
of stock in the Credit Mobilier to perform certain
legislative acts for the beneflt of the Union Paclflc
Railroad Company. The persons thus chanted with
crime are, or had been, in high public station; one
of them is tne Vice President of the United States;
another the Vice President elect; still another, the
Secretary of the Treasury; three Senators of the
United States are included?Messrs. Bayard, Fow
ler and Patterson. In this House the accusation
touches a former honored member from Massachu
setts, now In his grave, Mr. Thomas A. Elliott; it in
cludes the chairman of Ways and Means, Mr. Dawes;
the chairman of Appropriations, Mr. Garfield; the
chairman of the committee on Civil Service Re
form, Mr. Kelleyithe Chairman of the House Naval
Committee, Mr. Scliofleld; the chairman of the Ju
diciary, Mr. Bingham; an eminent member of the
Committee of Ways and Meams, Mr. Brooks, and
an ex-member from the state of Pennsylvania, Mr.
Rozer; and It includes the .Speaker or the House,
who now occupies the floor. All of these gentlemen
are alleged to have received presents or stock in
the Credit Mobilier from the hands of Oakes
Ames, a representative from Massachusetts
presents of stock which were in the nature of
bribes. This grave accusation Includes men of
both political parties, and men holding, as I have
already said, eminent public stations. The charge
of bribery of members is one of the gravest that
any legislative b6dy is ever called upon to consider,
and one that demands prompt, thorough and im
partial investigation, i have taken the floor,
therefore, for the purpose of moving that a select
committee be appointed to investigate these
charges and to ascertain whether tney be true or
false. Unwilling, or course, to appoint a committee
to investigate a charge In which my own name is
included, I have called you to the chair to per
form that duty. I have selected you because
you are a political opponent, held In
high honor both in the House and in the
country, and when on Saturday last I advised you
that I should ask this service from you I placed
upon you but one restriction in the selection of the
committee, and that was that It should not con
tain a majority of ray political friends, and this re
quest is cordially concurred In by all the members
of this House who are accused with whom I have
been able to confer. Without further detaining
the Ifonsc, I submit, the following resolution, and
unless some gentleman desires to speak 1 will call
the previous qvestion
Whereas accusations have been made in the public
SroM rounded on the alleged letters of (hikes Ames, a
??preventative from Massachusetts, nnrt upon the af
fidavit of Henry S. McComb, a citizen of Wilmington, jn
the State of Delaware, to the effect that members of this
House were bribed bv Oakes Ames to perform certain
leclijativ? acts for th s benefit of the Union Pacific Kail
road Cufiipahy. by piflsentti of stock in the Credit Mobilier
of America or by present! of a Yuluvblc character de
rived therefrom;therefore,
Resolved, That a s|>eciul committee of Ave members be
appointor! pjr the Spj ukar )>ro tempore, whose duty it shall
to investigate and aseerJLiilu. jvhethcr any member of
this House was bribed by O^lJCiJ AiUftS (lr in,y ?ersoff or
corporation In any matter touching ills legislative duty,
and that the coiumittec be authorized to scud for persons
and papers
Mr. Archer, (dom.) of Md., hoped that the reso
lution would not be adopted. The question had
been already tried by a higher tribunal than the
Sousev The American people had passed upon it.
e thought It much better for the House to go on
with the regular business of the conntry.
Mr. Randall, (rep.) of Pa., hoped that the reso
lution would be adopted with unanimity, and ho
trusted that, in the language of the Speaker, the in
vestigation would be lull, thorough and searching.
Less than that should not meet the expectations
and requirements of the American people. There
had been a dark cloud of scandal raised over the
Honse, and 1(" was due to those members who had
never been Involved In such proceedings that their
character should be raised above suspicion. It was
also right thai public condemnation should fall on
the heads of those, if there were any such, who
were implicated In voting for bills In which they
were directly or indirectly Interested.
Mr. Dawes agreed with Mr. Randall, and hoped
that the resolution would be adopted without a
dissenting voice. Without expressing any opinion
as to the result of such an investigation, it was
due to the House, as well as to the members im
filtcated, that there should be no shrinking at this
Ime from a thorough, exhausting, lair and Impar
tial investigation. In times past he had borne his
full share of urging on the House the propriety of
taking cognizance of charges of this kind when
made by responsible authority, ne did not Intend
now to shrink from any such Investigation, and he
trusted that the House generally would feel in the
same way, and that the investigation would be
pursued In such a manner that the result would
command, as he had no doubt it would receive, the
approval of the American people.
Mr. Holman, idem.) of Ind., expressed the hope
that the resolution would be adopted unanimously.
THB COMMITTEE APPOINTED.
The resolution was adopted, with a few negative
votes on the democratic slue; and Mr. Cox, as
Speaker pro tnn., appointed as the Select Commit
tee MessrB. Poland, Banks, Beck, Niblack and Mc
Crary.
Mr. Sarornt, for the Committee of Ways and
Means, reported
TUB INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILL,
which was made the special order for Tuesday, the
10th Inst. He stated that the amount appropriated
under it was $6,370,365, being (982,G97 lees than In

The Speaker presented the resignation of Mr.
Mercur, of Pennsylvania, who has been elected
Judge of the Supreme Court of that State.
After a short recess the President's Message was
at twenty minutes to two P. M. received and read.
The reading of the Message was completed at ten
mlnut.es to three P. M., having occupied one hour
and ten minutes.
The Message was ordered to be printed.
Mr. Oarfiei.d, itora the Committee on Appropria

BURIED ALIVE!
_ . W '
Shocking A-vi-ioehl In Brooklyn?Three
. v Men Killed.
At three o'clock yesterday afternoon while five
I men were at work In an excavation for a sewer in
Qnincey street, near Tompkins avenue, a quantity
of earth caved in and bnrled three of them alive,
the other two making their escape, having ob
served the earth about to give way. The two men,
who were so fortunate to get out, shouted for help,
and a large crowd gathered at the place and made
strenuous eirorts to rescue the men from their living
tomb. The heads of two were just above the
earth, and they presented a horrible sight,.
The weight of earth against their bodies and
chests bulged their eyes from their sockets ana
cauHod their tongues to hang from their mouths.
These two m^n were not instantly killed, but one
died while his fellow laborers were at work en
deavoring to extricate him, and the other imme
diately alter he was taken out. The third, who
, was completely bnrled, was round dead and his
body badly mutilated. These unfortunate men
were Italians, and their names were John Rudzon,
Prank Monttvidl and John Lovay. Their bodies
were removed to the Morgue.
The trench in which they were working Is for
the purpose of laying in a twelve-inch
1 pipe. For a distance of thirty feet from
Tompkins avenue the excavation had been made
seven feet deep, and the other pan was but Ave
feet from the surface. No braces had been used to
prevent the earth rrom caving in, and It Is said that
some of the men hart refused to work In the sewer
on this account. In making this excavation the
men had thrown up considerable dirt on the e<lge
or the sewer, and the weight of this caused it to
fall npon them. The contractors, Messrs. York and
Mulvey, should, It is said, have used some precau
tion against an accident of this kind. The foreman
stated that they were never In the habit of putting
braces In the excavation nntll they had dug it
seven feet deep.
Coroner Janes will hold an Inquest over the
bodies to-day.
