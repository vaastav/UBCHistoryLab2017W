if It did not moan war, at least it did
moan a stronger and more vigorous policy to

is now penoMllv believed that tbo future course
of the President wdl bo governed entirely by
the result of the negotiations now pending be

crinlawaa beyond doubt the cause of our recent

Representative# of several Western cities are
lure iu the hopes of securing the location of a

of the Hoard of Trade of that city, Omaha by
the Nebraska donators, and ocher cuiea by Con
gressmen especially interested iu them. Dr.
Lmderman la now engaged in tbe preparation of
bis report to the President, who is requited by
law to report to Congruss tbo city which*,
in his Judgment, is most suitable lor
the location. Tho teport will not bo completed
for acme days. Omaha has signified its inten
tion to press her claim, and through Hitchcock
to-day introduced a bill to locate (he mint there.
Tbe claim is made for Omaha that it does more
smelting than any other city. It is quite posui
hle that tho rivalry oi tho different cities may
result io the defeat uf ail nroposluous to lucuto
a mint in tbo AlisaUsippi Valley.
AUAODULBNT SOCTUaUN CLAIMS.
The passage iu the President's message relat
ing to Southern claims hsa attracted marked at
teutiou, aud will undoubtedly nave some effect
upon legislation. The President plainly says
that a groat many fraudulent claims have beau
paid, aud that suooeaalul claimants have re
ceived for damage* very much more than the
damaged property was ever worth. In ibis the
President fully confirms TuuTjubuhs’s pool
tlon oo tbe claims question. The Southern and
border Btates men generally, trreapective of
party, will not concede the fraudulent character
of claims, as . tbeae claims bring vast sums of
money into their districts.

cided upon a general suspension of work through

month. Tbe collieries will rsmain idle four
weeks. This action la taken by tbo Exchange
for tbo purpose of getting rid of tho largo sur
plus stock chat now lies in evory available place
of storage. Tbo demand during the vear boa
been light, and tbo production since Ilia end of
the five muutbs's strike last spring has fallen only
JWj.IOU tons behind tbat of last year. Individual
operators have been forced to atop in some
cases by tbo close of tbe canal, or the difficulty
or disposing of their product, and on Saturday
last tbe Philadelphia A Reading Coal and Iron
Company clo»od thirty-one collieries, leaving
only nine in opeiatiou. The action which is
takoa to-day will, it is believed, relieve the
(inoittors from present embarrassment, al
though it will n eull in tbe enforced idleness of
over UU,OOO miners.
The Lehigh coal operators will bold a meeting
in Now York this week, to agree upou a partial
nusponaiou. It la probable that they will Halt
their collieries to ihroo-fourlhs time, which, by
reason of toe difficulties la tbo way of operatlooa

one-half. The Lehigh region baa produced only
tone lean than last year, aud the ao

BEARISH COMMENT.
Srteiat Vuvateh to Tht C/ueartn Tnburu.
New York, Dec. 6.—The dispatch from Chi
cago pubhabed in the New York morning papers
to day io regard to affaire of tho Chicago k
Northwestern Railroad have been tho matter of
moob comment, and, emanating from the Presi
dent of tbo Road, hare added to the interest felt
in financial circles hero on tbo subject at issue.
Tbe dispatch has not bad a beneficial elfect, for,
while quoting the earmuga of tbo road during
the past thirty-six davs, it ignores the real ques
tions at issue, and the ones which have chief
concern in the New York stock market. Mr.
Keep’s telegram does not refute tbe allegation
made her.-, teat tbo Company cannot earo enough
to pay interejt over opera'iug eiDPosos, after
woriang tho main linra and the raisons lesaed
and proptloiarv roads. It is alleged here that
tbe losses of the road on It* leas> d and proprie
tary I.dch are on the increase, and more than
couuteroalsuce tbe net profits on tbe main line.
It la further claimed hero that tbo construction
and equipment can only be effected by a new is
sue of eI3.OOD.DUO wold bonds authorized to be
issued tu 1372, $35.000,000 of which were pul
aside to take up rarioua mortgages. There
are at present very little remains
on hand. Tbe Company's losses on
leased lines bare been $315,000 in 1573, $550,000
io 1374, and $363,000 m 1375. The outlook, as
shown from a careful investigation of figures, is
not regarded here as favorable to the Chicago k
Northwestern Road.

CARD TO TirE PUBLIC.
Akn Arbor, Doc. C, 1875.—1 n regard to the
painful charges which have been made against
me, touching my c-innection with the finances of
tue University, I desire io the roost emphatic
manner to give them a direct and total uonial.
They are wholly and cruelly unune.
At present 1 only ask of tbe public that those
who may bo inclined, on more ex-pnrto state
ments. even to doubt my integrity, will suspend
lodgment until all the facts of the case aro fully
brought out, oitber bv & fair and impartial com
mittee appointed by the Board of Bogents. or
else In a court of law.
Of tbo Board of Begems I ask two condi
tions :
Fil'd —Thai he wbomast convict or be convict
ed shall not bo my judge.
Second— That 1 may have a speedy and impar
tial trial.
A word In relation to tbe transfer of my prop
el ty. That that sot, which was at once the most
cooecieotious aud guiltless of mv life, should be
construed into a enufessiou of guilt is to ms tbe
most painful of all this vile alauder.
1 was confronted by gentlemen m whose hon
esty and Integritv I had tbe utmost oontideuco.
They looked upon mo etrangotv, aod began to
give out daik insinuations against my integritv,
not so much of what they knew aa what they
greatly feared. They manifested deep sohoiis
t on for me, aod aipearod very anxiour to main
tain entire secrecy, and prevent scandal. They
inquired of my ability to give security until an
investigation could bo had and the facts ascer
tained.
Helloying that alt partlea were action In good
faitb, and overwhelmed by the euddenneas and
enormity of the Intimations. anxious to door
lefiuo ootblog tbat might give room to doubt
me. coiibcloub of my innocence, I did not atop
to question the honesty of others, but unhes
itatingly conveyed mv properly 10 (be Kegents
as a pledge of my iuetiot readme** to meet any
Just claim that could be brought against me, and
now the act is pointed to aa a compromise of
guilt.
Again I aver my entire lenoeeoce of each and
every of the charges that my eneralea are
making against me, and. whatever elao I may
leave to my wife and little ones. 1 shall (save a
pure character, or be buried m oblivion.
