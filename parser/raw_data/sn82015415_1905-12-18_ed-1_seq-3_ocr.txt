It was decided that an operation was
necessary. The operation was ac
cordingly performed, but was of no

ie Electric Smile
Darkness destroys confidence. Business men don't like it
any more than children do.
Light not only inspires confidence, it also inspires cheerful
ness. When you have Electricity in your office or home, you press
the button and nature'll do the rest.
You'll find ten smiles In a light room to one- in a gloomy
place and the electric smile is a good basis to conduct busi
ness on.
There's not a better investment than Electric Light. It pays
large and frequent dividends of health and happiness.

vlllty can never again be tolerated on
American soil. We cannot concedo that
tho proper solution of Its problem is
special legislation admitting to Hawaii
a class of laborers denied admission to
tho other States and Territories. There
nre obstacles, and great obstacles, in
tho way of building up a representative
community In the Hawaiian Islands;
but It Is not In the American character
to glvo up In the face of difficulty.
Many an American commonwealth has
been built up against odds equal to
those that now confront Hawaii.
No merely half-hearted effort to meet
Its problems as other American com-
Lmunltles have met theirs can bo ac
cepted as final. Hawaii shall never be
como a Territory In which a govern
ing class of rich planters exists by
means of coolie labor. Even If the rato
of growth of the Territory is thereby
rendered Blower, the growth must only
tako place by the admission of Immi
grants fit In tho end to assume the du
ties and burdens of full American citi
zenship. Our aim must be to develop
tho Territory on tho same basis of,
stable citizenship as exists an this con
tinent.
