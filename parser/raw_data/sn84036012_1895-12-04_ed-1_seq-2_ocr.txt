GETTING A MESSAGE
How td President's ddre Cones
Oves the Wires.
THE OPERATORS' LONG SHIFT
A Triumph of Modern Enterprise
Is the Distribution of the
the News -How it is
Done.
Yesterday at noon, In Washington,
congress assembled and, after a few
fosesslttes, received from President
Cleveland his annual message. The
clerk of the house read it and the sen
ators and representatives read for
themselves from printed copies with
which they are furnished, or lounged
and chatted in the cloak rooms. Its
reading of the message has become a
matter of form in congress, for the rep
rssentatives of the people are given
copies which they may read for them
selves, instead of listening to the clerk.
Yet this annual reading goes on and for
an hour and a half the clerk reads
eloud arousing only the echoes in the
balls of congress.
This morning the Standard places in
the hands of its readers a verbatim
copy of the message as it was read
yesterday in Washington. The handling
at a president's message is one of the
triumphs of modern journalism, and of
modern times. In former days it was
weeks and months before the policy of
the president was known, but now the
world reads the message a esoon as
mot of the congressmen.
This is due to a great extent to the
recognition of the power of the press
by the chief executive of the nation,
who supplies the press associations of
te country with advance copies, under
conditions best explatned by the follow
lag telegram, which was the introduc
tion to the message as it came over
the wires Tuesday morning:
"New York. Dec. 3.-The following
message of the president of 'the United
States is sent to the press of the coun
try through his courtesy, in advance of
its presentation to congress. and is
transmitted free with the compliments
of the Western Union Telegraph com
pany, the only conditions being that
managers are required to get a written
gurantee from a responsible person
Connected with 'lch paper or press as
sociation that the mesage will net in
any way be made public or used ex
oept to be put in type until a release
message from our manager at Wash
ington, M. Marean, is received, and
managers are hereby instructed to
withhold the message from any paper
or agent refusing to give such written
guarantee until such release message
has been received.
"W. R Somerville,
Supt. Press Service, W. U. T. Co."
The written guarantee is promptly
forthcoming and then the message fol
lows. How it came over the wires is
an interesting story.
The telegraph operators at the Stand
ard office didn't go to bed till 9 o'clock
yesterday morning. The president's
message each year causes quite as
much flurry in telegraph offices as a
general election.
It can easily be imagined that the
transmission of from 15,000 to 20,000
words in addition to regular press re
ports to every daily newspaper in the
United States involves an amount of
telegraphic labor and wire facilities
that is astonishing. There is a certain
class of telegraphers who work only on
two occasions each year; one 4s election
day and the other the night on which
the president's message is sent. The
balance of the time they are on the
"block."
It may be Interesting to some to trace
the message from its origin in Wash
ington to its final resting place on the
Standard's pages. When it Is filed in
Washington it is sent at once to New
York, which office supplies the New
England and Eastern states. New
York sends it to Chicago, which is the
main telegraph office of the United
States. At Chicago probably 100 or
more copies are taken and these are
distributed among the different sec
tions-the South, North and West.
Thus while it may be received in Chi
cago by only a sufficient number of
men to make the necessary copies, it is
being flashed by a hundred fast senders
to Florida, to New Orleans, to Denver,
and in fact to all points where a tele
graph line runs.
The copy which was hung on the
"West hook" was sent to Omaha, and
is the one that the people of this sec
tion are reading this morning. Omaha
sent it to Ogden, perhaps by human
machinery, but more likely by means
of the Wheatsome automatic telegraph.
The latter system is capable of a wire
speed of 300 words a minute and is op
erated by means of long strips of tape
punched full of holes and slits-the
holes for the dots and the slits for the
dashes. The holes and slits are repro
duced at the receiving end on similar
strips in ink. The characters are then
copied by young women into plain Eng
lish and given to the "'Morse" opera
tors in Ogden.
It will require a little exDlanation of
how it came from there to Anaconda.
One wire in the Standard's telegraph
department is used for the associated
press reports from the Ogden office.
That made one wire. The Standard's
special wire to Butte was connected at
that place with a "quadruplexed" wire
to Ogden. Willie Wheaton received on
the first mentioned wire, and Johnnie
Derks on the latter. The message was
sent to Butte and Helena at the same
time it was sent to this office.
The transmission began on the
"quad" at 12 o'clock and on the "sin
gle" at 2 o'clock. The senders at Og
den were evidently pretty sleepy for
they didn't average much more than 20
words a minute. while it should have
come at a speed of 50. The message
was divided into sheets of about 120
words each; there were 134 sheets.
These 'were sent in a very badly mized
way; for instance. 98 would come and
an hour later sheet 10 showed up. When
the 196 sheets were all in they were
given to the editors to be arranged in
rotation and the telegraph operators'
weerk was done.

Idense, Dee. 2.-The Daily News corr
epesadet at Constantinople says a letter
freo a Europesa at Marsovas says that
on Sunday. after the massacre, there was
a ghastly spectacle at the edge of the
Armseata cemetery. Corpses were
breugbt by the wagon load and tossed
yeal tse mund La beeps. Aside from
the rtiing of the bodies by the perpetra
tonu of the slaughter, a hyena-like horde
of barbarism pounced upon these beeps
and stripped the dishooored moreasses of
what poor clothing they had, leaving
them in all degrees of nudity. Finally,
about noon. a score of Armenians headed
by a priest. went. under the protection of
soldiers, to bury the corpses. Eiglty
three of them were laid in a single
trench. Probably about a hundred of
them were killed.

Boston, Dec. 3.-The new city gov
ernments were chosen in 19 of the 31
cities of the state to-day and in three
quarters of them there was practioally
no enthusiasm whatever. In many
places party Jines were not drawn, and
in Springfield. Somerville, Glouchester,
Brockton and other cities the battle was
fought on the A. P. A. issue. The
contest in Springfield was one of the
warmest in the history of that city and
resulted in the overthrow of the can
didates endorsed by the A. P. A. In
Somerville. where the organisation has
had control, its candidate for mayor
was defeated. The secret organiza
tion was triumphant in Glouchester
and Brockton. Republicans showed
unexpected strength in Fall River and
carried it by nearly 1,500 plurality.
They also carried Lawrence, a former
democratic stronghold, by more than

Chicago, Dec. 3.-Three-quarters of
a million dollars has been stolen from
the campaign fund of the democratic
party, raised for the years 1356. 1864 and
the spring of 189%. The charge is made
by IM. C. lMcDonald and Alderman John
Powers. It is sustained by the newly
elected chairman of the county central
committee, Thomas (lahan, in the
statement that the funds of the past
two years have not been accounted for.
The money was raised for the cam*
paign which resulted in the election of
John Hopkins over George B. Swift, as
mayor, for the county commissioners'
campaign following, for the aidermanic
campaign. for the winter contest and
for the drainage canal campaign. but
recently closed. The democratic ad
ministration of the central committee
born out of the asmassination of Carter
Harrison, is charged with the misuse
of this money.

No More Old Maids.
From the New York Ierald.
"There is one good thing that the
new woman has accomplished," re
marked a daughter of frivolity, who is
most provokingly not new in any thing
save fashion. "She has abolished the
old maid."
Of course al her hearers irnialmed.
"How abeurd!" "What nonsense!" and
one started to prove "from the latest
statistics" that there never were so
many old maids em now, and that this
increase was largely due to the abom
inable theory and praotloe of the new
woman.
When the objections had all been
urred. and the excitement began to
quiet down. the young person remark
ed calmly. "Nevertheless, I tm x'ght.
There are no more old maids, for as
soon as one gets into that debatable
land she becomes a new womrn!"
