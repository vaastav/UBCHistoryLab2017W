I IT seems that Uncle Sam might as
well set his house in order for a few

annual message to Congress that h

IF reports are true the countys
16000 pike from Hartford to Beav

IiParties who have heretofore as
sumed supervision of this the coun
tys only piko road have by their
C inaction signified their intention to
let it go unattended and unrepaired
It seems to us to be the height of fol

property go to ruin when 500 spent

HOW UNGRATEFUL
The announcement from Washing
ton that W GDearing of Flemings
burg would about the first of next
March lupersede Col C M Barnett I
as Collector of Customs at Louis I
ville comes to the people of this
Mr Barnetts home county like a I
thunderbolt from a clear sky Not
only his fellow countymen but the
whole of Western Kentucky are in <
dignant and rightfully so at the
utter disregard of the claims of
Western Kentucky Republicans to
some recognition in the distribution
of federal patronage as well as mer
rit and meritorious indorsement the
men having control of Federal ap I
pointments defiantly thrust at them
by the appointment not only of an t
Eastern Kentucky man to succeed
Mr Barnett but to fill every impor j
tant Federal position in the State
Of all the appointive Federal of
fice holders in the State Mr Barnett I
and Dr A D James are the only 1
two that are to lose their places
notwithstanding most of the others
have like them been eight years in
the service Eight years is probab 1
ly long enough for one to hold a I
Federal job but if so why was mot
the rule made absolute and all the 1
eight year men removed Certainly
Mr Barnett deserves to hold on as
much as any of the rest He has
made an enviable record find has the
indorsement not only of his party t
leaders but the indorsement and
recommendation of the hundreds of 1
patrons of his office The Big I

wards Messrs J W Yerkes and R
P Ernst supposed friends of Mr
Barnett are the ones to whom this
unjust discrimination is chargable
Of these four socalled referees
Bennett is probably pardonable for
indorsing Mr Dearing But the
other three how ungrateful Ernst
Chairman of the Republican State
Central Committee Edwards Con
gressman from the Eleventh district
and Yerkes Commissioner of Inter
nal Revenue whose sponsor and
faithful supporter Mr Barnett has
always been and who owe their very
existence politically speaking in
great measure to Mr Barnett and
his friends at the last hour betray
ed friendships trust and the trust
of every Republican in Western
Kentucky and indorsed Dearing
Who is this man Dearing any way
and what claim he has on the Repub
lican party that should entitle him
to a 5000 job at its hands
terms of the Louisville Herald he
a Flemingsburjr lawyer whose only
claims are as far as known that he
quit the Democratic party because
that party failed to give him office
that he has never since won an elec
tion for the Republican party
although many chance has been giv
en him that he has lost his practice
and has to bo provided for at the
table of the grand goodnatured old
party which prefers it is said the
convert of yesterday to the earnest
brother that has kept the faith and
fought the good fight from the be
ginning
The ungratefulness of the quadri
vate composed of Messrs Yerkes
Ernst Bennett and Edwards to
wards their staunch friend and sup
porter Mr Barnett together with
their defiance of Western Kentucky
Republicans in view of the factthat
Mr Barnetts home county as well
as many other counties in the West
ern part of the State made much
better showing in the recent election
as compared with Eastern Kentucky
is beyond palliation and the sooner
they are removed from the councils
of tke party the better it will be for
