The President's Message.
President Wilson read his mes
sage to Congress which assem
bled last Monday. Every avail
able seat and space on the floor
of the House was occupied, a,
Mr. Wdson appeared in persdc
before a joint session of -bothl
houses of Congress, while the
galleries were packed with visi
tors.
We give a synopsis of the
'President's message, as follows:
The session upon which you
are now entering will be the
closing session of the Sixty-third
Congress, a Congress, I venture
to say, which will long be remem
bered for the great body of
thoughtful and constructive work
which it has done, in loyal re
sponse to the thought and needs
of the country. I should like in
this address to review the nota
ble record and try to make ade
quate assessment of it; but no
doubt we stand too near the
wvrk that has been done and are
ourselves too much a part of it
to play the part of historians to
ward it.
"Markets of Central and South
America can be turned to the
United States and what interests
us now is our duty and oppor
tunity.
"We have grossly erred in the
way in which we have stunted
and hindered the development
of our merchant marine. The
time and circumstances are ex
traordinary and so must our ef
forts be also.
"Safeguard the resources of
the national domain and encour
age the? use of the navigable
waters outside that domain for
the generation of power.
"A larger measure of self-gov
ernment to the people of the
Philippines. TIhe passage of this
bill will nobly crown the record
of these two years of memorable
labor.
,"Open the gates of trade to
*k he anited States by passage of
S hi ll pending in both
louses. It is not a question of
:he government monopolizingI
,he field, but providing means of
raining trade.
"Show good faith in adopting
the rural credits bill, already rati
tied by Great Britain and Ger
many.
"Provide means for charting
and surveying the coasts of the
United States and Alaska, there
by conserving lives and shipping.
"Provide for economy in public
expenditures. - The duty is mani
fest and imperative.
"As to national defense, the
policy of the United States is set
tled against a large standing ar
my. A nation of peace has no
need to be alarmed by sensation
alists. We shall not turn Ameri
ca into a military camp. Con
gress should encourage military
training in schools. The nation
al guard should be developed and
strengthened. The country has
been misinformed as to the mat
ter of the nation's defenses. The
United States has not been neg
ligent.
A powerful navy we have al
ways regarded as our proper and
natural means of defense; and it
has always been of defense that
we have thought, never of ag
gressiveness or of conquest. But
who shall tell us now what sort
of navy to build? We shall take
leave to be strong upon the seas,
in the future as in the past; and
there will be no thought of of
fense or provocation in that. Our
ships are our natural bulwarks.
When will the experts tell us just
i,iht kind we shall construct
and whien will they be right for
ten years together, if the rela
tive efficiency of craft of differ
ent kinds and uses continues to
shange as we have seen it change
irder our very eyes in these last
few months?
"Great tasks of and duties of

"The Ideal Catalogue."
A librarian's idea of the most useful
form of catalogue for a library is gives
as follows:
"The ideal catalogue for a public It
brary is one published with one line
entries, each being about twice as long
as the average newspaper Column is
wide. This catalogue is published in
the for m of a newspaper, on cheap
paper, cheaply printed. It is sold by
the library at about two cents a
copy. The copies sold are soon worn
out or thrown away and do not conde
back in after years to vex the librar1
ian. The library keeps the whole
thing in type, takes out some titles ev
ery month, adds hew ones, and prints
a new edition. This catalogue con
tains author entries only. If a man
wishes to know anything about the
books in the public library that this
catalogue does not tell he goes to the
library and finds out by asking; if he
wishes information concerning books
on a certain subject he goes to a bibli
ography of that subject; if he wishes
to know certain specific things about
certain books he asks to see the books
themselves."
Old Sayings About the Weather.
If it thunders on Sunday, the death
of a great man will follow; on Mon
day, the death of a woman is portend
ed; on Tuesday in early summer, an
abundance of grain; on Wednesday,
warfare is threatened; on Thursday,
an abundance of both sheep and of
corn; on Friday, a man of note will
be murdered, and on Saturday, there
will be a pestilence or some other
great disaster.
Truly, thunder is sa ill-omened visi
tor at the best!
If the full moon should rise red, ex
pect wind.
The sharper the blast, the sooner
'tis past.
A light, yellow sky at sunset fore
tells a windstorm.
Three foggy mornings in succession
mean rain.
A sky full of stars predicts .rain.
Look Ahead.
There are some people who ride all
througn the journey of life with their
backs to the horses' heads. They are
always looking into the past. They
are forever talking snout the good
old times, and how different things
were when they were young. There is
no romance in the worlt now, and no
heroism. The very winters and sum
mers are nothing to whit they used to
be; in fact, life is altogether on a
;mall, commonplace scale. Now, that
s a miserable sort of thing. It brings
a kind of paralyzing chill over life,
and petrifies the natural spring of joy
that should be forever leaping up to
meet the fresh new aneled ia the

HAT AND THE HABITATION
Architect Shows How the One Has
Always Borne Strong Relation
to the Other.
A well-known architects has pointed
out that the form of the hat bears a
certain relation to buildings of a prim
itive nature-huts. He has invited at,
tention to the curious resemblance
that has existed, and that is still to be
found in many countries between
headgear and habitations or other
buildings. It may be that the same
taste, or the lack of it, has given rise
to the similarity of style, or in the be
ginning the designer of the hat may
have taken the hut as a model
In the Hawaiian islands, long before
the inhabitants took the trouble to
clothe themselves, they built grass
houses, and at the present time the
characteristic Hawaiian hat is remark.
ably like the hut.
The turbans of the dignitaries of the
Eastern church are still of the shape
of jbose worn by the high priests
among the Jews of olden times, and
they are extraordinarily like the charl
acteristic domes that surmount
mosques. Again, it is pointed out, the
high-pointed spires of Gothic churches
were contemporaneous with the high
horn-like headdress known os the hen
niLn.
It is believed, too, that like remults
may be found after a comparison of
other styles of architecture with the
headgear of the period wherein they
flourished.
PUBLIC LED BY CONVENTION
Fact Explains Why Reality in Any
Form of Art Comes as Some
thing of a Shock.
We are all such creatures of conven
tion that the first impreassion made by
reality in any form of art is sometimes
a distinct shock and we close the win
dows of our intelligence and draw the
blinds, that the fresh air and the new
light may not enter it. Just as so
form of art is so strange as life, so
it may be the strangenesa of reality
in books, in pictures, and in music that
makes our attitude one of resistanes
rather than of welcome.
Virgin snow often looks blue, but it
took courage to paint it blue, because
people judge not by eyesight, but by
convention, and snow conventionally is
assuredly white. In reading books of
fiction we have become so accustomed
to conventions that we hardly notice
how often they contradict reality. In
many novels 1 have read I have been
introduced to respectable women with
scarlet lips, whereas in life I never
saw a really good woman with
such labial curiosities. Conversations
are conventionally unnatural. A triv
ial illustration will sulce. Someone
in a group makes a. proposition.
"Agreed!" cried they all. Did you
ever hear anyone say "Agreed'-

Lyon Phelps.
Relieving Monotony on Train
As a method of relieving the 'mo
notony of a long journey the ober
vation of the distance post has a val
ue. Calculated in this way, the high
est speed I have achieved in this
country has been one mile in 46 see
onds, or at the rate of 78 miles per
hour, on the Midland railway tom
pany's system between Chesterfield
and Stockport-a most exciting run on
a down-grade five miles length of
track. The train swung frightfully,
but we survived. The next highest
speed has been bbserved on the Ion
don and Northwestern railway com
pany's system between Pearitt and
Carlisle; another down-irade run,
when a speed o0 70 miles pe hour can
often be observed. Speeds of be
tween 60 and 70 miles an sour are
however, quite commonly attaine4 by
many of the main line express thrins
in this country, and the amateur ob
server need not trouble to record any
runs in which the quarter-mile takes
over 15 seonds to oomplete.--Loado

The Physiolan's Life.
The study of medicine is an on
trancing subject; its practice reqadres
an array of virtues whose more con
templatlon staggers the mind. One
must meet violence with gentlesees,
ingratitude with equanimity, insult
with fortitude, slander with uience.
The physician's life is a daily exempl
fication of the Golden Rule. The very
sensitiveness that inspires sympathy
with pain and misery is a weapona in
the hands of ignaorance and maltee
wherewith they deal dreadful wouds,
wounds which must be endured dilent
ly. Resentment can have no place in
the physician's mind. Eq~ulamty
must be maintained in the faoe of md
apprehension and abuse.-From "Re
