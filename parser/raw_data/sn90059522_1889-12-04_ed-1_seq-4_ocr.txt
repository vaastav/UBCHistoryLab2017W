THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The 'president's .message speaks for
itself: at least, it will to the few who
will have the patience to wade through
it. The document is more remarkable
for its verbosity than its matter, and
may be likened to a Dakota wheat crop
in a dry season a tremendous pile of
chaff for so little kernel, It will be a
blessed fortune for this country when
our presidents learn to cut down their
annual messages to the average length
of the queen's address in opening par
liament* tor then tin would be able to
conceal their opinions without so ranch
labor.
.President H.vi:r.i<ox has traveled
over the entire field of foreign and
domestic affairs, touching upon every
subject of public interest, without im
parting a single item of information
that had not previously been given and
discussed throng- the newspapers; and,
with but one or two exceptions, without
expressing a positive opinion as to what
line of policy congress should pursue.
It is a labored effort from beginning to
end to straddle or dodge every impor
tant issue before the country, except
that be advocates the IJi.au: educational
bill and federal control of elections iv
the Southern states; ground upon which
the Republican party camped twenty
years ago and was glad to abandon.
In his discussion of our foreign rela
tions the president devotes a great deal
of space to affairs in all the countries of
the world, except Brazil. It is note
worthy that, while the Brazilian revolu
tion is the most notable event of modern
times, the president devotes just about
a stick and a half of Ms message to it;
and the only information he imparts
is that the new republic has not
yet been recognized by this govern
ment, and will not be until the people
of Brazil declare by a formal vote their
preference for ttie provisional govern
ment that has been established on the
ruins of the empire. This is queer doc
trine to be enunciated by the chief
magistrate of the model republic ofjbe
world. Our recollection is that when
the Spanish revolutionists established a
new republic the American minister to
Spain received his instructions the next
day to recognize the new government.
Why the same course has not been pur
sued in the ease of Brazil is a mystery
that the administration doesn't care to
explain.
In his discussion of domestic affairs,
the president is forced to admit that
under the existing tariff system the sur
plus continues to accumulate at the
rate of from forty to fifty millions a
year, notwithstanding the able efforts
of Corporal Taxxer and Secretary
Wixdom to scatter it. A broad smile
must have spread itself over the faces
of eensressmea yesterday as they
listened to the reading of this part of
die message. A lame duck, floundering
in shallow water, couldn't have cut a
more ridiculous figure than the presi
dent does in his endeavor to suggest
relief from over-taxation, and yet not
to stand upon the ground occupied by
the Democrats. With tremulous voice
he raises a cry in defense of the protect
ive system, while virtually admitting
that the system is nothing moie or less
than legalized robbery. De wanted to
recommend to congress to abolish the
tax on whisky and tobacco, but he
hadn't the nerve to do it, so he ap
proaches it somewhat in the fashion of
the girl who wanted her lover to kiss
her, but didn't like to come right
out and say so. Sin* supposed a
case of two cherry lips warm with
love's breath, properly adjusted for a
smack, and then reasoned what a fool a
fellow would be not to avail himself of
the opportunity. Still, it is more cow
ardice than modesty in the president in
hinting to congress that by removing
the tax from whisky and tobacco, in
stead of from the necessaries of life,
they might be able to stop some of this
In;" and cry about the growing surplus.
How different, how vastly different is
President Haerisox's evasive position
on the tariff from the clear, ringing sen
tences of Mr. Cleveland's last mes
sage on the same subject. The latter
had a policy that an honest man was
not afraid to advocate, while President
B_j__SO_ is frightened at his own
shadow because of his consciousness
that the ground upon which his party
stands is sliding out from under him.
THE LEAVEN WORKS.
That tariff reform was the most ef
fective influence in the results of the
"November ballot is more clearly evident'
as th 3 ground is reviewed. Bishop
Pekky, of the Episcopal church, says
the Democratic committee filled lowa
with enthusiastic stumpers from East
ern universities, and "tariff reform was
the burden of all the speeches on both
sides." Senator A i.i.i-"\. in a speech
the night before the election, explicitly
asserted that protection was the issue.
While the voting showed a marked
change In the general sentiment on this
issue, a very remarkable expression
was had adverse to . the Republican
leaders. There is a uniformity in the
condemnation that indicates a convic
tion with thoughtful Republicans that
their party leaders are not entitled .to
public confidence. Wherever an oppor
tunity has been afforded they have ad
ministered a rebuke to the men at the
head. In Ohio and lowa the Repub
licans elected all their state tickets but
the head. Their candidates for gov
ernor were buried under a for
midable pile of ballots. In Massa
chusetts the Republican candidate for
governor narrowly missed defeat, while
others on the ticket had 20.000 more ma
jority. In Virginia the utter badness of
Mahoxi so disgusted the better class of
Republicans that they would not accept
any names tainted by association. He
pulled the whole ticket down to his
level. The verdict of the jury in the
popular trial is thus specially directed
at the men at present in control of the
[Republican party. The men who led
the party iv its early career, when it
achieved the results which are "pointed
to with pride," have nearly all passed
away or been forced to abandon the
party. Those now in control use it as a
machine for individual advantage ex
clusively. They have for years been
leading it wrongly, in the face of the
protests of the Independents. It is
notable, too. that the decadence in the
leadership of the Republican party has
been contrasted with indisputable im
provement in the Democratic manage
ment. Adversity has taught and devel
oped, and the part; is on rising ground.
M'KIXLEY'S OPPORTUNITY*.
The mutations of a polit'cal career arc
•seriously exemplified in the anomalous
status of Maj. William McKixley*.
who a year ago was concededly the fore
most man in his party, and yet to-day
there are none in Washington BO poor
as to do him reverence. What has Maj.
McKiMiv done to forfeit the confi
dence of his party and to be so suddenly
divested of power and influence? If
merit, ability and conscientious effort in
support of party organization and prin
ciples counted for anything:. Maj. Mc-
KiM.i.v would have been entitled to
the speakership. As it is. according: to
all parliamentary usage and precedents,
the major is entitled to the chairman
ship of the principal committee of the
house, and to be recognized as the lead
er of his party on the floor. But the in
dications are that he is to be relegated
instead of exalted, and a special effort
will be maue by those in control of the
organization of congress to dwarf him
in public estimation.
When we look back to the position
M< Kim.ky occupied a year ago and
then at where he stands to-day. there is
a natural disposition on the part of the
outside public to inquire into the secret
cause which brought aliout this remark
able change. McKixley drafted the
platform upon which the parly won its
victory last fall. There are no indica
tions that the party intends to abandon
its position on the tariff and other ques
tiou? that were made prominent in the
late campaign. McKinley has been
involved in no scandal, nor has he had
the opportunity to commit a grave polit
ical error by which he would forfeit
the confidence of the Republican masses.
Why the necessity, then, for throwing
him overboard at a time when the party
needed the services of tt~abtesl leaders'*
There can be but one answer to the
question. "Notwithstanding his ex
treme protection views. McKixley
is an honest man, who acts upon con
viction, and is guided by prin
ciple. In point of ability and the
higher qualities of statesmanship
he is head and shoulders above any Re
publican member of the Fifty-first con
gress, and it is due to the very fact that
he possesses these qualities that lie is to
be crashed. He isn't the kind of a man
to suit the purposes of the Quays and
the Cameeoxs and the reckless ele
ments who control the party organiza
tion. Speaker Reed is of the type that
better suits the purposes of the schem
ers who propose to flood congress with
subsidy jobs. Reed is smart enough in
his way and in their way— that is, he is
quicK-witted, aggressive, and is indiffer
ent to a guiding principle by which to
shape his conduct. He will be a ready
and pliant tool in the hands of the
schemers, which M'Kinley would not
have been. Hence the necessity for
keeping McKixley ourof the speaker's
chair. Yet, under ordinary circum
stances it would have been supposed
that the subsidy schemers would have
been satisfied with McKinley's defeat
in the speakership contest, and would
have been willing to let him enjoy the
distinction of leadership on the floor of
congress. But they are not. Now that
they have him down, it is their serious
purpose to jump on him and rub sand
in his eyes. There is no mortification
they are not anxious to inflict upon him.
If Maj. McKinley"-- nerve is com
mensurate with his brain, this is his
brilliant opportunity to make a record
for himself and to make himself a con
spicuous figure iv national affairs. If
he is lacking in pluck and will quietly
submit to the indignities that the Reed
following propose to visit upon him,
then he will pass out of political exist
ence forever, unwept, onbonored and
unsung. But if he will pull himself to
gether and go into a fight with the Reed
gang for the supremacy of the house,
he will make a reputation that will en
dure. He may not have the following,
nor the power and Influence to over
throw the Quay-Reed combination yet
if he keeps up the fight in vigorous style
during the Fifty-first congress, refusing
to surrender or compromise, and will
stand at the door of the treasury as
Raxdall and Holman used to do, and
protect it against the Invasion of the
subsidy robbers, he will come out ofthe
contest a good deal bigger man than
when he entered it.
AN INSTRUCTIVE INCIDENT.
The defeat of the Republican caucus
nominee for chaplain of congress was
significant, in that it conveys a useful
lesson to the Republican leaders. It will
teach them the danger of attempting to
force extreme measures. Party ties
are not as strong as in former times,
and the dictates of the caucus do not
carry the weight that they once aid.
We can recall the time, when the Re
publican majority in congress was
under the domination of the three B's —
Blame. Butler and Bingham— it
would have been considered treason for
a Republican member to bolt the caucus
nominee for bootblack, and the offend
ing member would have been pilloried
on the spot. It is different now. It was
one of those outrages which are often
justified on the plea of party necessity
when the Republican caucus put a can
didate in the field against W. H. Mil
burn, the blind preacher, who had
filled the post of chaplain during the
entire Democratic regime in tho lower
louse. But there were enough Repub

lican members, who nad more respect
for proprieties than for caucus dictation,
who united with tho Democrats in re
electing Mr. Mit.nuKX.
: As *we havo intimated, the incident is
both suggestive and instructive. There
will be no effort to discipline the muti
nous members who broke away from the
caucus nominee, for the simple reason
that the Republican leaders realize the
folly of pursuing such a course. It
Ought likewise instruct them as to the
necessity for pursuing a conservative
line of legislation. The Democratic mi
nority can be relied on to stand in solid
phalanx in opposition to all force bills,
subsidy jobs, or schemes to increase the
burthens of taxation with a view of en
riching thojnonopolists. it ought now
be apparent to the Republican leaders
that they cannot rely on the power of
the caucus to force objectionable legisla
tion upon the country. There aro yet a
few righteous men in Sodom who may
prove the salvation of the Republican
party, as they will surely aid the Demo
crats in the matter of keeping conuress
in the line of decency and propriety.
One of the" Mormon apostles in the recent
examination! testified that a Mormon would
not take ii secoud wife without the consent
of the first. That shows Unit the women look
favorably upon the system, of course. A lit
tle funnel along the information was elicited
that the wife was assured that if she did not
consent she would bo eternally damned, and
when a wife was headed in that direction her
wishes were not to be considered. The mail
who walks to the gallows without being
dragged helplessly shows the same sort of
cheerful willingness. A wife who is willing
for her husband to take other women in that
relation has sunk her womanhood iv re
ligious fanaioisni or does not love her hus
band. In one of the rural distiicts of Utah,

ored aud rewarded for his vote. Probably
the "mail and brother" has the right idea
but the connection of vote and reward is
suggestive of Republican associations. Dem

not hope of lucre. They have had to quite

Madison, Wis., Dec. B.— The supreme
court to-day rendered a decision in the
most important railroad case that ever
came before the courts of Wisconsin.
lt was the case of the Chippewa Valley
& Superior Railway company, respond
ent, vs. the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneap
olis & Omaha Railway company, in
which the title to a land Rant from
Vea/.ie to-Superior, a distance of sixty
miles, was involved. The dispute arose
out of a contract entered into between
these companies, the former of which
is, in reality, the Chicago, Mil
waukee & ' St. Paul. At that
time the grant made originally to the
Portage & Superior Railroad company,
consisting of MO.OOO acres of land,
mostly heavily timbered with pine and
hard wood, and was about to lapse be
cause of non-tulliilment of the condi
tions on the part of the company.
Thereupon, the companies above-named
set about securing the forfeited grant,
but it was plain that if all entered
the contest no one would get the
grant. Hence, a meeting of the
representatives of the railways now
-interested was arranged and it was
agreed to let the Omaha company
take the grant without any opposition,
and tin roads agreed to aid this road as
best they could, for which courtesy on'
the part of the other roads the Omaha
was to turn over a : * *, ; * *.. > .
SIIAIIE OF THE SPOILS,
in all, about a fourth of the entire grant,
with running privileges over the new
line, etc. The scheme worked beauti
fully. The Omaha company gobbled
the grant and built the road, but
when the other companies sought to
get their share of the land grant
the Omaha company stood them off, and
they sought the courts for redress. The
iower court decided against the Omaha
company. which thereupon demurred
on the ground that the contract was a
"lobby contract," and against public pol
icy. The circuit court overruled the
demurrer, but the supreme court to-day
reversed the ruling. In the opinion
rendered Justice Cassaday says: "In
the matter of disposing of land grants,
as in all other matters of legislation,
it is important to the continued
welfare of the state and all Its citizens
that all improper avenues of approach
should be effectually closed.'" He then
quotes some maxims from Justice lield
on the subject of "lobby contracts,"
and continues: "These maxims of leg
islative and oflicial propriety and duty,
it is believed, are as old as our govern
ment, audit .. mny be safely assumed
that they will never be brought

courts. To properly aid in wield

traneous bias and purchased influence.
'I hey imply continued vigilance for the
public weal and the faithful perform
ance of every public duty. "In the exe
cution of such official trusts no favors
can be secured, and no obligation in

to the decision rendered. The amount
involved in the case is something over
$2,000,000. ■
NO MORE COMMISSIONS.
The Trunk Lines Will Do Business
Legitimately Hereafter.
New York. Dec. 3.— The Trunk live presi
dents met to-day at the office of the associa
tion, No. 346 Broadway. George 8. Roberts,
chairman presided. All the lines in the as
sociation except the Reading, were repre
sented. The principal business of the meet
ing was the question of abolishing passen
ger commissions on all lines in the Trunk
line territory. This question was practically
settled at the lust meeting ofthe presidents,
but laid Over for the purpose of securing the
consent and co-operation of the Central
Traffic association, and New Engtand roads.
Tbe meeting unanimously agreed to abolish
the commission business on all lines east of
Chicago. An exception, however, was made
in the case of the Grand Trunk and
Vermont Central roads. They were allowed to
use in their discretion the method of paying
commissions iv such cases as would arise in
their competition with the Canadian Pacific,
the great competitor of these roads for the .
Northwestern business. A somewhat pro
tracted discussion was indulged ill as to the
advisability of abolishing the use of private
stock cars. The various roads represented
seemed to be in favor of abolishing these
cars because of their trouble and great ex
pense. The Chicago* Atlantic and the Chi
cago & Grand Trunk representatives were
not so enthusiastic in wishing their abolish
ment, and so expressed themselves. While
they are in favor of abolishing them, they
first want to see their active competitors also
agree with them in the matter, and practi
cally put into effect what they say. The Cen
tral Vermont explained that existing con
tracts precluded them from abolishing the
use of private stock cars on their road, but
when these expired they would be glad to
follow the rest in the matter. A resolution
whs then passed abolishing the use of such
cars in trunk line territory.
The subject of appointing a successor to
Mr. Fink as trunk line commissioner did not
come up.

A DOUBLE-JOINTED KICK.
Chicago, Dec. 3.— At the meeting of the
board ot managers of the Interstate Com
merce association to-day the report of the
special board of arbitration on the adjustment
of through and local rates to points in Neb
braska and Kansas was considered. The
Burlington and the Union Pacific refused to
accept the rates as recommended by the
board because they involved au advance in
the present through rates to Lincoln and
other Nebraska points, which have heretofore
been favored with lower rates than would,
its is claimed, . naturally pertain to
their geographical position. The refusal of
the above-named roads to change the present
condition of things arises from a fear of pro
voking the wrath of these localities and ulti
mately causing further anti-railroad legisla

subject will be resumed to-morrow.

FOR THE GRAND JURY*.
Opening of the Winter Term—
:,-.; ; Collom in Court.
Tho grand jury for the December
term of co.rt met yesterday. There are
several cases of prominence which they
will be called upon to consider, among
which Is the attempted indictment of
ex-County Attorney Davis for his part
in the alleged criminal libel of Judge
Welch. Mr. Welch declares that he
will try to have Davis indicted. He
had W.W. Irwin, of St. Paul, indicted,
and now he proposes to _o for Davis.
The case of Henry Marks, of Brook
lyn Center, accused of subordination of
perjury*— come up. Chaiiesßlakeman
was last summer prosecuted for bas
tardy, the witnesses against him being
Ilenry Marks, Ins stepdaughter and his
wife". The stepdaughter accused Blake
man of being the father of her child.
Later there was trouble in the Marks
family, he skipped out and Mrs. Marks
and the girl immediately made deposi
tion that Marks was really the father of
the child, and that Blakeman was ac
cused because of threats made by
Marks. . Now the old lady and the girl
have left the country. Then there are
the embezzlement cases against officers
of the Northwestern Collection and
Loan agency; that of Harry Benham,
charged with "holding up" the express
driver near the union depot, and James
M. Johnson, formerly Min neapolis agent
for the Michigan Mutual Life Insurance
company, arrested for embezzlement.
The matter of the Wansch affidavit may

.^EXCEEDED AUTHORITY.
A Suit Brought Against Some of
"" **"■""-.-■* Our Magnificent-Police.
:, There are warm, lurid flames of battle
in the South Minneapolis police station.
Ciipt. Ness blames Sergeant Allen, Sergeant
Allen blames the several patrolmen, and
(hey in turn jump real hard upon
the frame of Officer McLeod. The
cause of this upheaval in South town
police circles is a couple of comi.laints tiled
in the district court yesterday afternoon, in
which Nelson White and while and his wife
ask for damages to the extent of $5,316 and
$10,000, respectively. Louis Ness, caitiin
of the Soutn Minneapolis section; James
Allen, lieutenant, and Mack Brady and M, It.
McLeod, patrolmen, are made defendants,
to the suit. The circumstances which
brought about the suit are these.
as stated in the complaint: On tho
evening of the 3"th of May last Officer Mc-
Leod. it is alleged, dressed in citizen's
clothes, in company with two young men
whose names are unknown, entered the resi
dence of Mr. White, at 259 Seventh avenue
south. Mrs. White had but recently got out
of bed after a severe illness, and was still in
a weakened condition from its effects. Two
other gentlemen, with their wives, friends of
the Whites, were present, lhe three men.
from their actions, it is said, evidently sup
posed that they were in a house where
'everything goes." They would vouchsafe
no reply to Mr. Wnite's repeated inquiries as
to what they wanted. Instead they began to
make themselves at home. They tried to be
come somewhat familiar with the ladies pres
ent, and. as the story goes, one of
them advanced toward Mrs. White.
She became frightened, and Mr.
White began to .let slip the cords
that controlled his "mad." For the last time
he demanded to know what the intruders
ere after. He received the same repiv as
before— a word. He arose to his feet,
and the man who was approaching his wife
continued to advance and tried to brush pass
Mr. White. That gentleman stands some
thing over six feet in his stockings and thick
in proportion. His muscles were also in a
good state of developmeut, and when
a man tried to run his house he remonstrated
and remonstrated real hard. The intruder
found himself going down stairs, impelled
by the boot of Mr. White. Another of the
trio fled, and the third, who is said to nave
been Oflicer McLeod, was caught by the col
lar and the rear of the trousers, in "the man
ner employed in ranking a person "walk
Spanish and bodily thrown down
the stairs and into the street. The
doughty guardian of the law.' so it Is alleged,
was not thus to be overcome by a base civil
ian. He summoned his companions- ui-arins,
and right valiantly the blue-coated heroes re
sponded. A storming party was formed.
The complaint sets forth that, the door was
broken in and that Mr. White was seized,
without ever being told that he
was under arrest, and kicked, cuffed,
buffeted, and pounded with "batons,
billys and other weapons." Various and
sundry vile epithets were hurled at the head
of Mrs. White, aud all the oaths and obscene
expressions in the category are said to have
been applied to her, and to her husband.
The patrol wagon was summoned and Mr.
White was knocked dowu and dragged into
it. despite his frequent assertions that he
would* go along quietly if the pounding
wtuid only be abated for a few mo
ments; He was locked up. When
arraigned the next morniug in the municipal
Court, and before a judge who is especially
hard upon offeuders. the charges were so
palpably unjust that ho was immediately dis
charged". The above is a recital of the facts
as gathered from the complaiut and from
the olaintiffs.
Mrs. White in her complaint declares that
her health was poor when this attack was
made upon her home, and that a .severe ill
ness, was caused by the shock to her system
occasioned by tbe tumult, the fighting and
swearing, the attack upon her husband and
tho abuse suffered by herself, ln considera
tion of all these she asks damages to the
amount of 810,000. Her husband alleges that
he suffered from false imprisonment aud
from 1 the ill treatment inflicted upon
him by the officers; that he was unable to at
tend to his business on accout cf them: that
he was caused trouble and expense because
of his arrest, and that the illness of his wife
compelled him to expend considerable
money for doctor's fees, etc. He seeks to re
cover"jr).34(*. The action causes some sur
prise, since Capt. Ness is noted for being a
capable, conscientious and careful officer,
and the South Minneapolis station for being
one of the most efficiently conducted In the
city.
Mr. White is employed n« city salesman for
a well-known wholesale house. He is highly
respected by His neighbors. Not a word has
ever been breathed against the character of
himself or wife. The firm for which he
works is said to be backing bim In this ac
tion. . They propose to find out if a man's
borne can be invaded in Minneapolis and
himself and wife be subjected to all sorts of
abuse without redress being secured. ; .?

Bishop Hennessey Denounces
; the White Caps Who
Threaten His Life.
A Wealthy Woman, Addicted
to Drink, Almost Entirely
Eaten by Rats.
Discovery of a Wide-Spread
Conspiracy to Rob Nyp
ano Trains.
Two Colorado Mortally
Wounded in a Free-for-
All Fight.
DvEi;svii.i.E, 10., Dec. 3.— lit. Rev.
Bishop Hennessy, In dedicating a large
Catholic church here to-day in the pres
ence of 100 priests and 0,000 people, read
from the altar a letter which
he had received, signed "White
Caps," threatening his life if
he dared appear at the ceremonies,
The bishop bitterly denounced the
authors of the letter, pointing frequently
to certain portions of the church, as
though indicating the presence of his
enemies. There.are two factions in the
Dyersville church, which is located
in an almost exclusively German parish.
One faction desired Bishop Ilenuessy
to place the Rev. Father Brinkman in
charge of the parish, hut the bishop re
fused to do so. and sent the Hey. Father
Herr. This created considerable dis
satisfaction. The bishop curtly refused
to reconsider his action when asked to
do so, and it is assumed that the threat
upon his life is the result.
RATS ATE HER FACE.
Horrible Fate of a Wealthy
Woman Addicted to Drink.
i Denver, Col., Dec. 3.— A horrible discovery
was made here late to-night, which may yet
prove to be a tragedy. About a year and a
half ago a Mrs. Ritchie, an old gray-haired
woman, about sixty years of age.
came here from Cheyenne, Wyo., accompa
nied by a young mau of twenty-five, whom
she represented as her son, and a deaf and
dumb daughter, about fifteen. They lived in
various parts of the city until about two
mouths ago, wheu they engaged apart
menu at lti"i*l "stout street, where
they lived a very retired life.
Three weeks ago the mother and son went on
a protracted debauch. The old lady had not
oeen seeu for several days, and the landlord
becoming alarmed broke open tne door of
ber room to night, and was horrified in find
ing the woman lying upou the floor
by the side of her bed dead, with
her face almost entitely devoured by rats.
The body was taken to the corner's. The
son was fouud in an adjoining room in a
beastly state ol intoxication, and was taken
to the police station, where he now lies
unable to speak or give any account of him
self. The dead woman had an deposit at the
First National bank """"iO.OOO. 'the family
went to Cheyenne from Texas, and while
living iv Wyoming a son was mysteriously
murdered. It is said the deaf and dumfc
daughter knows who committed the crime,
but refused to divulge the secret, and nc
arrests have been made.
ROBBING NYPANO CARS.
Discovery of an Organized Gang
of Train Robbers.
Marion, 0., Dec. 3.— Consternation has
been produced among the trainmen on the
New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio rail
way by the arrest of John McPger
son, John Kinsinger and Chailes
E. Downs, on the charge of robbing
freight cars in the trains on whtch they were
employed, and ,he issuing of warrants for
many others. The trial of Charles Downs
commenced this morning before Mayor Cay
ley. Downs a brakeman on a local freight,
and made a confession. He said the
first he knew of the thieving was on
April 10 last year. One day at Caledonia, a
quantity of clothing, etc., was abstracted
from the car, and upon another occasion, at
M artel, a car was opened and three lady's
workboxes were taken ana presented to the
wives and girls of the men implicated.
Dowus explained the method of abstrac
tion .as follows : In nearly every way
car some boxes of through freigut were
found, and these were the boxes tampered
with. Goods were always taken from freight
cansigned to points beyond the New York,
Peunsylvania & Ohio. It is claimed a regular
commission business was done at Daytou by
the suspected men. Clothiug, dress goods,
boots and shoes, whisky, and nearly every
thing suffered. A large number of the offi
cials of the road are here, and great interest
is manifested. •

Street Fight in Colorado.
Denver, Co!., Dec. 3.— A tragedy oc
curred here early this morning, resulting In

DERELICT DEAD.
Bodies of Shipwrecked Sailors
Buffeted in tbe Waves.
New York, Dec. 3.— appalling sight
was witnessed in the water off the Delaware
breakwater about dusk yesterday by the ere*"
of the Norwegian bark Christian Schriver,
which arrived from Boeaofl Ayres today.
The lookout discerned between 4 and 5
o'clock p. in. a huge raft bobbing up and
down with each motion of the waves. As
the bark approached the derelict the figures
of two human beings were indistinctly made
out lying out at fulllencth lashed to the logs.
Both men were in sailors' costumes. At a dis
tance of probably three yards from the
raft, the body of a middle aged woman, en
circled by a life preserver, was being tossed
about by the rough sen. The Woman's lower
limbs were even with the water, and her head
and face were Lcing continually washed by
the waves. The captain of the bark ordered
his vesel around to the leeward of the raft,
and tacked about for over an hour,endeavor
ing to discover sonic means of identifying
the derelict. There was no name discern
able, however, and finally the vessel went on
her course, leaving the bodies to the mercy
ot tin* waves. Tho receipt of the captain's
report in shipping circles In this city, oc
casioned no little excitement. . Upon the
Maritime exchange tho opinion pre

We propose to form an offensive arid de

mutually advantageous. If onr pa'hsleadus
along the same road it adds to the strength of
both orders to work together. When our
ways diverge we can part in friendship to
meet further along in some other issue. I
am not one of the principal advocates of co
operation with the Knights, but I can see tha
advantage to be derived from such a step.

further governed by to-day's experience.
