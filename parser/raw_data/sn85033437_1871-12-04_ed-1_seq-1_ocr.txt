He commends tho Ministers and Consuls in
x ranee ior tneir course in protecting tne in
terests of German subjects in Paris during the
war. lie informs Congress that in conformity
with the established precedent, he has recor-
nized the chancre of governments in Home and
the Italian States. He speaks of the friendly re
lations between Russia and the United States,
and refers to the visit of Grand Duke Alexis
and the hospitable recention riven to him. In
relation to tho Catacazy question the President
says that the inexcusable course of the Russian
Minister had rendered it necessary for him to
ask theMinister's recall and lo decline to receive
that functionary any lonircr.
He says that it was impossible for him, with
self respect, or with a just recard to the dignity
of the nation, to permit JUr. Uatacazy to con
Hcue to hold intercourse with this Government,
after his personal abuse of Government officials,
and after his improper interference by various
means in the relations between this country ana
other powers, lhe Government had therefore
been released from further intercourse with 3lr.
Catacazy, and another minister had been com
missioned who was entirely unobjectioneble.
CUBAN AFFAIRS.
He recommends tho education of four
American youths in Japan and four in China.
He eives the history ot the difficulty in Corea,
and leaves the subject to the action of Congress.
As to Cuban affairs,hc says that he has instruct
ed American naval commanders in Cuban
waters to protect the lives and liberties of bona
fide citizens of the United States and the digni
ty of the flacr, and expresses the hope that all
the pending questions between the United
Stjxtes and Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of
peace and conciliation which has heretofore
guided both powers.
PACIFIC TRADE SPECIE PAYMKNT KUKLUX.
lie recommends Congress to take measures to
support the lines of steamsnips between ban
Francisco and China and San Francisco and Ja
pan. Also to taKe steps to Dnng aDout a return
to specie payment. Also to unite the telegraph
ic system with the postal system of the United
States. He defends the policy pursued in ref
erence to the stoppage of kuklux outrages, and
expresses tno Denei mat out 01 tne numerous
arrests made, no innocent persons in custody.
TOLTGAMT IX UTAH.
In regard to polygamy in Utah, he relates the
action of the Federal courts and authorities and
says that the Mormons will not be permitted to
violate the laws under the cloak of religion, but
suggests whether the children already born
under the Mormon system should not be legiti
mate. BEDUCIKG TAXATIOX.
lie recommends the abolition of all internal
revenue taxes, except those on epiritSj made li
quors, tobacco and stamps; also, the revision of
the tariff.
INDIAN POLICT REMOVAL OF DISABILITIES.
He says that the Indian peace policy has thus
far resulted favorably, and he recommends the
formation of a territorial government in the
Indian Territory. Uo suggests the removal of
all political disabilities under the Fourteenth
Amendment, and says that it will be a happy
day for the Southern State3 when the old citi
zens shall again take an interest in public
affairs.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
He recommends liberal appropriations for
the District of Columbia and for the public
buildings in Chicago. He reviews the ques
tion of civil service reform and promises that
the experience of reform shall have a fair
trial.
"Washington, Dec. 1 Blair offered a reso
lution in the Senate to-day, being the same as
that offered by Beck in the House, making in
quiry regarding the enforcement of the kuklux
law. It went over under objection.
The message was read. Adjourned.

Returns from all but five counties in
Wisconsin give Gen. Washburn 9,547 ma
jority for Governor. The remaining coun
ties are strongly Republican, and will pro
bably increase his majority to over 11,000.
This is a handsome gain. Fairchild's ma
jority, two years ago, was 8,215. In 1870,
the aggregate Republican majority on Con
gressmen was only 6,117.

The Bill to Equalize Salaries The Peni

NAsnviLLE, Dec. 4, 1871.
Editors Chronicle: The bill passed
, u ci j. is il. 1
by the Senate
ui ! 1 ifii iii u 1 1 i ri iiu 1 1
olticers is creating quite a sensation. This
bill was introduced by Senator Gibson.
and provides that Clerks of Courts, Sheriffs,
.trustees and Itevenue Collectors shall nay
into the county treasuries of their respec
tive counties all fees or other omcial com
pensation received by them in excess of
5? 4,000 per annum. These officers are also
allowed S1.S0O ner annum for onoh Hpnntv
the Countv Court mav deem lipnossnrv.
The passage of this bill by the Senate has
1 Ki. A 1 ill. ;i
to jNasnviiie quite a swarm
of : lobbyists to kill the bill in the
House. The people are unanimous for
it 111 tlie wealthy counties; and the
officers affected are unanimously
against it. It is not generally known that
the above named omcers in bhelby, David
son and some other counties make from
ten to forty thousand dollars a year out of
their offices, while the Governor and the
Supreme Judges receive but four thousand
a year.
TUB PENITENTIARY LEASE
This lease has not given universal satis
faction, and the discontent is on the in
crease. The Penitentiary Inspectors claim
to have made $90,000 last year over all
expenses. It is insisted that the lease was
made secretly and then rushed through
the Legislature. It is further insisted that
if the State had let it be known that a lease
would be made, at last bb0,00 a year
could have been obtained instead of $30,-
000. .
THE APPORTIONMENT HILL.
The manner in which the State has been
redistricted creates almost universal dis
satisfaction among the members, and
there is a general disposition to postpone
final action on this subject until the Con
gressional Districts are redistricted. It
seems to be taken for granted that there
will be an extra session ior this latter pur
pose.
STATE GEOLOGIST.
A bill passed the Senate on Saturday to
create the office of state lieologist at the
nominal salary of $300 per annum. The
object of this is to get the benefit of an
act of Congress directing the United States
coast survey to triangulate any State
wherein a geological survey is in progress.
A tnangulation of the State is indispens
able to the making of a correct State map,
and will also bring many thousands of dol
lars into the State during the prosecution
of the work by the Uuited States officers.
FINANCES.
Tennessee finances are getting mixed up
worse and worse every day. There is sup
posed to be about one million of the old is-
I'll At .
sue srm outstanding ; tne new issue is
placed auy where you ploa,se between three
and thirty millions and must be paid ; the
House is threatening to repudiate various
issues 01 bonds : the Senate Finance Com
mittee voted a few days ago to put down
the advalorcm tax to fifteen cents ; the
State has sold out many of her railroads
for a mere song and is now paying back a
considerable part of what she did receive.
by way of compromising law suits : there
are i?o0,000 outstanding 111 State warrants;
the totate has -10,000 01 borrowed money
to pay in a short time or Ipse its hypoth
ecated bonds ; there are 90,000 more in

ment ; the Chancellor of Davidson coun
ty has just attached $50,000 in United
States bonds and other bonds and coupons.
in the handsof the StateTreasurererand has
enjoined the Governor, Treasurer. Comp
troller, Secretary of State andotherofficials
from in any manner disposing of said
bonds, at the suit of certain depositors 111
the banks of Tennessee ; the school fund,
amounting now to at least two millions of
dollars, the State is bound in honor to re
place ; the people are crying for relief from
oppressive taxation ; the merchants are
flooding the Legislature with appeals for a
reduction of taxes; the .Legislature is
spending its time in passing railroad and
local laws, and is about to adjourn without
seeming to think for one moment of the
tremendous financial perils environing
the State. In a word, the General Assem
bly is unequal to the emergency. It is
sleeping on an earthquake. Relief must
be devised. The times demand Action
Action Action : imbecility m omce is
treason to the State ! Timidity is imbecil
ity. The thunderings of the coming storm
are muttering afar ofl". The whole action
of this Legislature is in the interest of re
pudiation. The incubus of debt is
now almost unbearable. It seems
to be the policy or the Demo
cratic leaders here to increase the
State debt. Of course this means repudia-
ion at last. The Tennessee money, old
and new issue, to be redeemed, amount
ing to unknown millions, stalks abroad
through the State like the ghost of the
Confederacy, and the Democracy are par
alyzed at this image of its own treasonable
doings. Let it then be written down : De
mocracy means repudiation and insolvency
or Tennessee. The people have, perhaps,
one more chance to redeem their State
the next election for the Legislature. Let
hem meet the issue squarely. Democracy
in Tennessee has been a failure ; that fail
ure is a crime. No wonder honest Demo
crats want their party buried out of sight.
New York City has set this State the ex
ample. Will we follow it ? Honesty and
patriotism urge us on. Kast Tennessee, at
east, will do her duty. 1 hat much is cer
tain. All else is damness. iours.
