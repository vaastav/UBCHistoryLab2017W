TWENTY-SIXTH YEAR.
San Francisco, Dec. 6.—President®
Itoosevelt's denunciation of Califor­
nia's anti-Japanese attitude has
aroused bitter resentment here.
The president is excoriated for his
threat to use troops and he openly is
Ehe
barged with deliberately misstating
position taken by the authorities
tof this city and the Btate.
Should force be used the Califor
fciians declare they will not weaken
and while they may have to bow for
the time being to federal dictation
they will withdraw all the white chil­
dren from the public schools and leave
them in sole possession of the Japa­
nese.
Open threats aire made that Califor­
nia will be turned to the Democratic
column in the next election, the cam­
paign slogan to be, "The Democratic
party is & white man's party."
There also has arisen another fea­
ture—bitter, open resentment against
Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of
the University of California. In Pres­
ident Roosevelt's message Californians
declare they recognize the words and
sentiments of the head of the state
university and against him, rather
than against either Roosevelt or the
federal government, is directed the
greater part of the wrath of San Fran­
cisco.
Angry men declared Wheeler had
taken open himself to dictate the pol­
icy of California and from his stand­
point to tell the rest of the nation how
California stands. Threats are open­
ly made to cut the appropriation of the
university one-half- in the next legis­
lature to teach its bead he cannot run
Federal Officials Will Have Courts
Rasa on California Statute.
San Francisco, Dec. 6.—Under direct

I legality of the state statute which
provides that children of Mongolian
'descent shall attepd a separate school.

kpecially appealsto the British at the
present time because both in South

Speculators.

ulent practices in entering school

ranch land was charged as improve­
ments on one forty-acre tract of school

Mississippi Young Woman Placed on
Trial for Murder.
Hazlehurst, Miss., Dec. 6.—The trial
on a charge of murder of Mrs. Angle
Birdsong, a young member of one of
the most prominent families in Mis­
sissippi, began during the day.
Mrs. Birdsong shot and killed Dr. T.
H. Butler, also a member of a prom­
inent family and nephew of former
Governor Longino of Mississippi, on'
Nov. 25, 1905. The shooting occurred
in Dr. Butler's office in Monticello,
Miss., where Mrs. Birdsong resided.
The young woman went-to the office,
waited until a patient had completed
his interview with the physician and
then, entering Dr. Butler's presence,
fired five shots. Going to the street
she remarked to a gathering crowd
that they would find the result of her
work up stairs in the doctor's, office.
She then surrendered herself to the
sheriff. Although admitting the shoot­
ing she has not let her line of defense
become public.
A few days before the shooting Mrs.
Birdsong attempted to commit suicide.
At her preliminary hearing her
brother-in-law testified that the pris­
oner had experienced extreme mental
troubles oyer rumors concerning her
character.
The- prominence of both families in
the case and intense feeling in Monti
cello caused a change of venue to be
granted. Mrs. Birdsong is about
twenty-two years of age.
SEEKS INCREASE OF POWER
PRESIDENT WOULD DISMISS ANY
OFFICER WHOM HE THINKS
IS UNWORTHY.
Washington, Dec. 6.—The president
has sent a special message to congress
urging legislation giving the executive
authority upon his own initiative and
responsibility to dismiss any officer

.^jjer .dull .be dismissed except.ln par
-finance of a courtniju-tiaL or in mitiga­
tion thereof. «Thls prdv^sion the pres­
ident wants repealed.
Illustrating' the necessity for the
legislation desired the president cites

is not given, but who was accused of
"indecent and disgusting behavior."
He was convicted* but the court, to his
surprise, the president says, did not
sentence him to dismissal.

fireproof, storage vault forced the Jooi
and hurled a sheet of flame across the
workroom. There was a run for the
stairway, which became choked with
the struggling girls, screaming and
fighting, with blazing hair and cloth­
ing. Three of the girls, penned in by
the flames and unable to reach the
stairway, jumped through the windows
to the ground. At the stairway sev­
eral of the girls fell and were tram­
pled upon.
The forewoman of the factory
reached the telephone and while she
was calling the fire department oth­

Washington, Dec. 6.—Congressman
Butler Ames of Massachusetts has be­
gun a prppaganda for an immediate
movement in the interest of tariff re­
vision. He says he is not undertak­
ing to secure action at the present
session of congress, but is urging upon
Republican members the advisability
of a general caucus to "give concrete
expression of their determination to
immediately revise the inequalities
present in our tariff laws so that all
possible notice to the country at large
may be given as to the time of re­
vision." He thinks that the subject
should be taken up immediately after
March 4 and would have the caucus
determine the best method of proce­
dure and whether the whole tariff laws
should be revised or only particular
schedules amended.
WITH DISCLAIMER ATTACHED.
Senate Committee Will Favorably Re
port Algeciras Treaty.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Whether Dem­
ocratic senators shall support the Al­
geciras treaty in relation to Moroccan
affairs^ when it is voted upon in the
senate on Dec. 12, will depend upon
the fate of a resolution to be present­
ed disclaiming the responsibility of the
United States for the convention and
declaring that the participation of this
government. is only in furtherance of
its general poliey of promoting peace
and in the Interest of its commercial
relations with Morocco.
The senate committee on foreign re­
lations considered the treaty and or­
dered that it be favorably reported to
the senate. This action was taken,
however, after a committee consisting
of Senators Spooner, Lodge and Bacon
fead -been ressihw
tibn which would declare that the
United States had no intention of in­
terfering in the regulation of Euro­
pean internal affairs.
The contest in the senate over the
treaty will be close in the event that
a disclaimer of the character outlined
is not adopted. The United States is
exempted from the responsibility of
enforcing the treaty through a reser­
vation made by Ambassador White,
the American delegate, in signing the
act.
BILLS, PETITIONS, ETC.
Large Number Make Their Appear­
ance in Senate.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Morning busi­
ness was heavy in the senate. It was
practically the first opportunity sen­
ators have had to introduce petitions,

this order the vice president laid be­
fore the senate a number of communi­
cations from the executive depart­
ments, which were ordered printed as
documents.
No Action on Resolutions.
Washington, Dec. 6.—After debate
the senate postponed for a day the
consideration of the resolutions call­
ing for information relative to the dis­
charge cf the negro troops of the
Twenty-fifth infantry, formerly sta­
tioned at Brownsville, Tex. The delay
was caused by the absence of Senator
Penrose.
House Passes Banking Bill.
Washington, Dec. 6.—The bill per­
mitting national banking associations
to make loans on-real estate as secur­
ity and iimiting the amount of such
loans passed the house during the day

KARL HAU AGAIN REMANDED.
English Court Awaiting Further Evi­
dence in Case.
London, Dec. 6.—Karl Hau, the
Washington professor who has been
under arrest here since Nov. 7
charged with the murder of Frau Mo
littor, his mother-in-law, at Baden
Baden, again Appeared on remand in
the Bow street police court. The
prisoner, who has fully recovered his
health, was remanded for another
week in order to enable the German
representatives to obtain further evi­
dence. The magistrate said the evi­
dence already here was sufficient to
warrant Hau's extradition, bat to make
the caM complete it was necessary to
hate proof of the cause of the death
of Frau Molittor, which the German
authorities had omitted to obtain.
Ham although laboring under a
great mental stran, which has entirely
changed his appearance, was quite
calm during the brief proceedings aad
at the close, when asked by his coun­
sel whether he understood what had
oesarred, he replied affirmatively.
