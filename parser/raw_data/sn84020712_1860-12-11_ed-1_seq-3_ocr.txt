nada has specially acknowledged itself to be responsi
ble to our citizens for damages which were caused by
the riot at Panama on the 15th April, 18o6. These
claims, together with other claims of our citizens which
had been long urged in vain, are referred for adjust
ment to a board of commissioners. I submit a copy of
the convention to Congress, and recommend the legis
lation necessary to carry it into effect.
Costa Rica and Nicaragua.- Persevering efforts
have been made for the adjustment of the claims of
merican citizens against the government of Costa
Rica, and I am happy to inform you that these have
finally prevailed. A couvention wa3 signed at the city
of -San Jose, on the 2d of July last, between the minis
ter re&ideiii of the United States in Costa Rica and the
plenipotentiaries of that republic, referring these claims
to a hoard of commissioners, and providing for the
payment of their awards. This convention will be sub
mitted immediately to the Senate for their constitu
tional action.
The claims of oar citizens upon the republic of Nica
ragua have not yet been provided for by treaty, al
though diligent efforts for this purpose have been made
by our minuter resident to that republic. These are
still continued, with a fair prospect of success.
MEXico.--Our relations with Mexico remain In a most
unsatisfactory condition. In my last two annual mes
sages I discussed extensively the subject of these rela
tions, and do not now propose to repeat at length the
facts and arguments then presented. They proved
conclusively that our citizens residing in Mexico and
our merchants trading thereto had suffered a series of
wrongs and outrages such as we have never patiently
borne from any other nation. For these our successive
ministers, invoking the faith of treaties, had, in the
name of their country, persistently demanded redress
and indemnification, but without the slightest effect.
Indeed, so confident had the Mexican authorities be
:!iie of our patient endurance, that they universally be
lieved they might commit outrages upon American citi
zens with absolute impunity. Thus wrote our minister
in I cSjG, and expressed the opinion that '-nothing but
a manifestation of the power of the Government, and
of its purpose to punish these wrongs, will avail."
Afterwards, in 1S57. came the adoption of a new con
stitution for Mexico, the election of a President and
Congress under its provisions, and the inauguration of
the President. Within one short mouth, however, this
President was expelled from the capital by a rebellion
in the army, and the supreme power of the republic
was assigned to General Zuloga. This usurper was in
bis turn soon compelled to retire and give place to
General Miramon.
I'nder the constitution which bad thus been adopted,
Keuor Juarez, as chief justice of the Supreme Court,
became the law ful President of the Republic; and it was
for the maintenance of the constitution and his author
ity derived from it that the civil war commenced, and
still continues to be prosecuted.
Throughout the year 1858 the constitutional party
grew stronger and stronger. In the previous history of
Mexico successful military revolution at the capital had
almost universally been the signal for submission
throughout the republic. Not so ou the present occa
sion. A majority of the citizens persistently sustained
the constitutional government. When this was recog
nised iu April. 1859, by the Government of the United
States, its authority extended over a large majority of
the Mexican States and people, including Vera Cruz and
all the other important sea ports of the republic. From
that period, our commerce with Mexico began to revive,
and the constitutional government has afforded it all the
protection in their power.
Meanwhile, the government of Miramon still held
fav at the capital and over the surrounding country,
and continued its outrages aguinst the tew American
t itizens who still had courage to remain within its
power To cap the climax: After the battle of Tacu
baya, in April. I8.!, Gen. Marqitez ordered three
t-iiizens of the United .States, two of them physicians,
to be seized iu the hospital of that place, taken out and
shot, without crime and without trial. This was done
notwithstanding our unfortunate countrymen were at
the moment cugaged in the holy cause of affording
relief to the soldiers of both parties who had been
wounded iu the battle, without making any distinction
between them.
The time had arrived, in my opinion, when this Gov
ernment was bound to exert its power to avenge and
redress the wrongs of our citizens and to afford them
protection in Mexico. The interposing obstacle was
that the portion of the country under the sway of Mira
mon could not be reached without passing over terri
tory under the jurisdiction of the constitutional govern
ment. Under these circumstances, I deemed it my duty
to rceomuieml to Congress, iu my last annual message,
the employment of a sutiicieut military force to pene
trate into the interior, where the government of Mira
mon was to be found, or, if need be, without the con-s-ut
of the Juarez government, though it was not doub
ted that this consent could be obtained. Never have I
had a clearer conviction oti any subject than of the
justice, as well as wisdom of such a policy. No other
alternative was left, except the entire abandonment of
our fellow-citizens who had gone to Mexico, uuder the
faith of treaties, to the systematic injustice, cruelty,
and oppression of Miramon s Government. Besides,
it is almost certain that the simple authority to employ
this force would of itself have accomplished all our ob
jects without striking a single blow. Thecoustitution
al government would then ere this have been establish
ed at the city of Mexico, and Mould hate been ready
and willing, to the extent of its ability, to do justice.
In addition aud I deem this a most important
consideration European governments would have been
deprived of all pretext to interfere in the territorial and
domestic concerns of Mexico. We should thus have
been relieved from the obligation of resisting, even bv
force, should this become necessary, any attempt by
these governments to deprive our neighboring republic
of portions of her territory; a duty from which we
could not shrink without abandoning the traditional
and established policy of the Americau people. 1 am
happy to observe, that, firmly relying upon the justice
And goud faith of these governments, there is no j. re
sent danger that such contingency will happen. Having
discovered that my recommendations would not be sus
tained by Congress, the next alternative was to accom
plish, in some degree, if possible the same objects by
treaty stipulations with the constitutional government.
Such treattes were accordingly concluded bv our late
able aud excellent minister to Mexico, and on the 4th Jan.
last were submitted to the Senate for ratification. As
these have not yet received the final action of that
body it would be improper for me to present a detailed
statement of their provisions. Still I may be permit
ted to express the opinion in advauce that they are
calculated to promote the agricultural, niaunfacturing,
aud commercial interests of the country, and to secure
our just influence with an adjoining republic as to
whose fortunes and fate we can never feel indifferent;
whilst at the same time they provide for the payment
of a considerable amount towards the satisfaction of.
the claims of our injured fellow-citizens.
KANSAS AND UTAH.
At the period of my inauguration I was confronted
in Kansas by a revolutionary government, existing un
der what is called the Topeka constitution. Its avow
ed object waS to subdue the territorial government by
force, aud to inaugurate what was called the Topeka
government in it stead Xo accomplish ,lis bject an
extensive military organization was formed and its
command entruMed to the most violent revolutionary
leaders. I oder these crcum-taiices. it I e a i.e my im
perative duty to een the whole constitutional power
of the Executive to prevent the flames of civil war from
again raging in Kansas, whU-h, i the excited state of
the public mind, both North and South, might have ex
tended into the neighboring States
The hostile parties in Kansas had been jnnanied
against each other by emissaries from the North and
the South, to a degree of malignity without paralled in
our history. To prevent actual collision.and to ait
the civil magistrates in enforceing the law?, a strong
detachment of the army was stationed in the' Territor
ready to aid the marshal and his deputies, when law
fully called upon, as a posse comitatus in the execution
of civil and criminal process.
Still the Troubles in Kansas could not have been
permanently settled without an election bv the urnni.
The b allot-hox is the surest arbiter of disputes among 1
freemen. Under this conviction, every proper effort '
was employed to induce the hostile parties to vote at
the election of delegates to frame a State Constitution,
and afterwards at the election to decide whether Kan
sas should be a slave or a free State. The insurgent
Tarty refused to vote at either, lest this mi ght be con
sidered a recognition on their part of the territorial
government established by Congress. A better spirit,
however, seemed soon after to prevail, and the two
parties met face to face at the third election, held on
the first Monday of January, 1858, for members of the
Legislature and State officers under the Lecompton
Constitution. The result was the triumph of the anti
slavery party at the polls. This decision of the ballot
box proved clearly that this party wereia the majority,
and removed the danger of civil war. From that time
we have heard little or nothing of the Topeka govern
ment ; and all serious danger of revolutionary troubles
in Kansas was then at an end.
The Lecompton Constitution, which had been thus
recognised at this State election by the votes of both
political parties in Kansas, was transmitted to me with
the request that I should present it to Congress. This
I could not have refused to do without violating my
clearest and strongest convictions of duty. The Con
stitution, and all the proceedings which preceded and
followed its formation, were fair and regular on
their face. I then belived, and experience has proved,
that the interests of the people of Kansas would have
been best consulted by its admission as a State into the
Union, especially as the majority, within a brief period
could have amended the Constitution according to their
will and pleasure. If fraud existed in all or any of
these proceedings, it was not for the President, but for
Congress to investigate and determine the question of
fraud, and what ought to be its consequences. If, ai
the two first elections, the majority refused to vote, it
cannot be pretended that this refusal to exercise the
elective franchise could invalidate an election fairly
held under lawful authority, even if they had not sub
sequently voted at the third election. It is true that
the whole Constitution had not been submitted to the
people, as I always desired : bat the precedents are nu
merous of the admission of States into the Uniou with
out such submission.
It would not comport with my present purpose to re
view the proceedings of Congress upon the Lecompton
constitution. It is sufficient to observe that their final
action has removed the last vestige of serious revolu
tionary troubles. The desperate band recently assem
bled, under a notorious outlaw, in the southern portion
of the Territory, to resist the execution of the laws and
to plunder peaceful citizens, will, I doubt not, be
speedily subdued and brought to justice.
Had I treated the Lecompton constitution as a nulli
ty and refused totransmft It to Congress, it is not dif
ficult to imagine, whilst recalling the position of the
country at that moment, what would have been the
disastrous consequences, both in and out of the Terri
tory, from such a dereliction of duty on the part of the
Executive,
Peace has also been restored within the Territory of
Utah, which, at the commencement of my Administra
tion, was in a state of open rebellion. This was the
more dangerous, as the people, animated by a fanatic
al spirit, and entrenched within their distant mountain
fastnesses, might have made a long and formidable re
sistance. Cost what it might, it was necessary to
bring them into subjection to the Constitution and the
laws. Sound policy, therefore, as well as humanity,
required that this object, should, if possible, be accom
plished without the effusion of blood. This could only
be effected by sending a military force into the Terri
tory, sufficiently strong to convince the people that re
sistance would be hopeless, and at the same time to
offer them a pardon for past ofiences, on condition of
immediate submission to the Government. This policy
was pursued with eminent success ; and the only cause
for regret is the heavy expenditure to march a large
detachment of the army to that region, and to furnish
it subsistence. Utah is now comparatively peaceful and
quiet, and the millitary force has been withdrawn, ex
cept that portion of it necessary to keep the Indians in
check, and to protect the emigrant trains on their way
to our Pacific possessions.
FINANCES.
In my first animal message I promised to employ
my best exertions, in co-operatiou with Congress,
to reduce the expenditures of the Government within the
limits of a wise and judicious economy. An overflowing
treasury had produced habits of prodigality and extrava
gance which could only be gradually corrected. The
work required both time aud patience. I applied myself
diligently to this task from the beginning, aud was aided
by the able and energetic efforts of the heads of the differ
ent Executive Departments. The result of our labors in
this good cause did not appear in the sum total of our ex
penditures for the first two years, mainly in consequor.ee
of the extraordinary expenditure necessarily incurred iu
the Utah expedition, aud the very huge amount of the
contingent expenses of Congress during this period.
These greatly exceeded the pay and mileage of the mem
bers. For th; year ending 30th June, 165b', whilst the
pay and mileage amounted to $1,490 214 the contingent
expenses rose to $2,OU:5,309 79, and for the year ending
30th June, 1859. whilst the pay and mileage amounted to
$8tJ9,U93 CG, the contingent expenses amounted to$l,
431,565 78. I am happy, however, to be able to inform
you that during the last fiscal year ending on the 30th
June, 1860, the total expenditures of the Government in
ail its branches legislative, executive, and judicial ex
clusive of the public debt, were reduced to the sunt of
$55,412,465 46. This conclusively appears from the books
of the Treasury. In the year ending on the 3Uth J une,
1H58, the total expenditure, exclusive of the public debt,
amounted to $71,901,129 77, and that for the year ending
3oth June. 1859, to $66,346,226 13. Whilst the books of
the Treasury show au actual expenditure of $59,848,474 72
for the year ending on the 30th Ji.ue, 1860, including $1 ,
040,667 71 for the contingent expenses of Congress, there
must be deducted from this amount the sum of $4,296,
009 26, with the interest upon it of $150,000, appropriated
by the act of 15th February, I860, " for the purpose of
supplying the deficiency in the revenues and defraying the
expenses of the Post Office Department for the year end
ing the 13th of June, 1859-" This sum, therefore, justly
chargeable to the year 1859, must be d ducted from the
sum of $59,848,474 72, in order to ascertain the expendi
ture for the year ending on the 30th June, 1860. which
leaves a balance for the expenditures of that year of $55,
402.465 46. The interest on the public debt, iucluding
Treasury notes for the same fiscal year ending on the 30th
June, 1860, amounted to $3,177 ,314 62, which, added to
the above sum of $55,402,465 46, makes the aggregate of
$58,579,780 08-
It ought in justice to be observed that several of the
estimates from the departments for the year ending 30th
June. I860, were reduced by Congress below what was
and still is deemed compatible with the public interest.
Allowing a liberal margin of $2,500,000 for this reduc
tion, and for other causes, it may be safely asserted that
the sum of $61,000,000, or at the most $62,000,000, is
amply sufficient So administer the Government and to pay
the interest on the public debt, unless contingent events
should hereafter render extraordinary expenditures ne
cessary. This result has been attained in a considerable degree
by the care exercised by the appropriate departments iu
entering into public contracts. I have myself never in
terfered with the award of any such contract except in a
single case with the Colonization Soeiety, deeming it ad
visaele to cast the whole responsibility in each case on the
proper head of the depart menr, with the general instruction
that these contracts should always be given to the
lowest and best bidder. It has ever been ny opinion that
public contracts are not a legitimate source of patronage to
be conferred upon personal or political favorites; but that
in all such cases a public officer is bound to act for the
Government as a pruJent individual would act for him
self. AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE, Ac
It is with great satisfaction I communicate the fact that,
since the date of my last Annual Message, not a single
slave has been imported into the United States in viola
tion of the laws prohibiting the African slave trade. This
statement is founded upon a thorough examination and in
vestigation of the subject. Indeed, the spirit which pre
vailed some time since among a portion of our fellow
citizens iu favor of this trade seems to have entirely sub
sided. 1 also congratulate you upon the public sentiment which
now exists against the crime of setting on foot military ex
peditions within the limits of the LInited States, to proceed
from thence and make war upon thepeopIe of unoffend
ing States, with whom we are at peace. In this respect a
happy change has been effected since the commencement
of my administration. It surely ought to be the prayer
of every Christian and patriot, that such expeditions may
never again receive countenance iu our country or depart
from our shores:
It would be -a useless repetition to do more than refer,
with earnest commendation, to my former recommenda
tions in favor of the Pacific railroad of the grailt of power
to the President to employ the naval force in the vicinity,
for the protection of the lives and property of our fellow
citizens passing in transit over the different Central Amer
can routes against sudden and lawless outbreaks aud
depredations; and also to protect American mrrehant ves
sels, their crews and cargoes, against violent and unlaw
ful seizure and confiscation in the ports of Mexico and the
South American republics, when these may be in a dis
turbed and revolutionary condition. It is my settled con
viction, that without such a power we do not ifford that
protection to those engaged in the commerce of the coun
try which they have a right to demand.
ELECTION OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
I again recommend to Congress the passage of a law in
pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution, appoint
ing a day certain, previous to the 4th March, in each year
of an odd number, for the election of representatives
throughout all the States. A similar power has already
been exercised, with general approbation, in the appoint
of the same day throughout the Union for holding the
election for President and Vice President of the United
States. My attention was earnestly directed to this sub
ject from the fact that the 35th Congress terminated on the
3d March, 1859, without making the necessary appropria
tion for the service of the Post Office Department, I was
then forced to consider the best remedy for this omission,
and an immediate, call of the present Congress was the nat
ural resort. Upon enquiry, however, I ascertained that
15 out of the 33 States composing the Confederacy were
without representatives, and that, consequently, these fif
teen States would be disfranchised by such a call. These
fifteen States will b in the same condition on the 4th
March next. Ten of them cannot elect representatives,
according to existing laws, until different periods, extend
ing from the beginning of August next until the months of
October and November.
In my last message I gave warning that, in a time of
sudden and alarming danger, the salvation of our insti
tutions might depend upon the power of the President
immediately to assemble a lull Congress, to meet the
emergency.
TARIFF.
It is now quite evident that the financial necessities of
the government will require a modification of the tariff
during your present session, for the purpose of increasing
the revenue. In this aspect, I desire to reiterate the rec
ommendation contained in my last two annual messages, in
favor of imposing specific instead of ad valorem duties on
all imported articles to which they can be properly applied.
From long observation and experience I am convinced
that specific duties, are necessary, both to protect the rev
enue and to secure to our manufacturing interests that
amount of incideal encouragement which unavoidably
results from a revenue tariff.
As an abstract proposition, it may be admitted that ad
valorem duties would, in theory, be the most just & equal.
But if the experience of this and of all other commercial
nations has demonstrated that such duties cannot be asses
sed and collected without great frauds upon the revenue,
then it is the part of wisdom to resort to specifics. Indeed,
from the very nature of ad valorem duty, this must be the
result. Under it the inevitable o.nsequence is, that for
eign goods will be entered at less than their true value.
The treasury will, therefore, lose the duty on the differ
ence between their real and fictitious value, aiid to this ex
tent we are defrauded.
The temptations which ad valorem duties present to a
dishonest importer are irresistible. His object is to pass
his goods through the custom house at tht very lowest
valuation necessary to save them from confiscation. In
this he too often succeeds in spite of the vigilance of the
revenue officers. Hence the resort to false invoices, one
for the purchaser and another for the custom-house, and
to other expedients to defraud the Government. The
honest importer produces his invoice to the collector. staK
ing the actual price at which he purchased the articles
abroad. Not so the dishonest importer and the agent
of the foreign manufacturer. And here it may be observ
ed that a very large proportion of the manufactures im
ported from abroad are consigned for sale to commission
merchants who are mere agents employed by the manu
factures. In such c?ses no actual sale has been made to
fix their value. The foreign manufacturer, if he be dis
honest, prepares an invoice of the goods, not at their act
ual value, but at the very lowest rate to escape detection.
In this manner the dishonest importer and the foreign
manufacturer enjoy a decided advantage over the honest
merchant. They are thus enabled to undersell the fair
trader, and drive him from the market. In fact, the
operation of this system has already driven from the pur
suits of honorable -commerce many of that class of regular
and conscientous merchants, whose character, throughout
the world, is the pride of our country.
The remedy for these evils is to be found in specific du
ties, so far as this may be practicable. They dispense with
any inquiry at the custom-house into the actual cost or
value of the article, aud it pays the precise amount of du
ty previously fixed by law. They present no temptations
to the appraisers of foreign goods, who receive but small
salaries, aud might, by undei valuation in a few cases, ren
der themselves independent.
Besides, specific duties best conform to the requisition in
the Constitution that "no preference shall be given by any
regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one
State over those of another." Under our ad valorem sys
tem such preferences are to some extent inevitable, and
complaints have often been made that the epirit of this pro-?
vision has been violated by a lower appraisment of the
same articles at one port than at another.
An impression strangely enough prevails to some ex
tent that specific duties are necessarily protective duties.
Nothing can be more fallacious. Great Britain glories in
free trade, and yet her whole revenue from imports is at
the present moment collected under a system of specific
duties. It is a striking fact in this connection that, in the
conimericai treaty of 23d January, I860, between France
aud England, one of the articles provides that the ad va
loiem duties which it imposes s-hall be converted inio
sj ecific duties within six months from its date, and these
are to be ascertained by maknig an average of the prices
for six mouths previous to that time. The reverse of the
proposition would be nearer to the truth because a much
larger amount of revenue would be collected, by merely
converting the ad valorem duties of a tariff into equiva
lent specific duties. To this extent the revenne'would be
increased, and in the same proportion the specific duty
might be diminished
Specific duties would secure to the American manufac
turer the incidental protection to which he is fairly entitled
under a revenue tariff, and to this surely no person would
object. The framers of the existing tariff nave gone fur
ther, -aad in a liberal spirit have discriminated in favor
of large aud useful branches of our manufactures, not by
raising the rate of duty upon the importation of similar ar
ticles from abroad, but w hat is the same in effect, by admit
ting articles free of duty which enter into the composition
of their fabrics.
Under the present system it has been often truly re
marked that this incidental protection decreases when the
manufactuier needs it most, aud increases when he needs
it least, and constitutes a sliding scale which always op
erates against him. The revenues of the country are sub
ject to similar fluctuation. Instead of approaching a
steady standard, as would be the case under a system of
spec. lie duties, they sink and rise with the sinking aud
rising prices of articles in foreign countries. It would not
be difficult for Congress to araange a system of specific
duties which would afford additional stability both to our
revenues and our manufactures, and without injury or in
justice to any interest of the country. This might be ac
complished by ascertaining the average value of any given
article for a series of years at the place of exportation, and
by simply converting the rate of ad valorem duty upon it
which might be deemed necessary for revenue purposes,
into the form of a specific duty. Such an arrangnient
could not injure the consumer. If he should pay a greater
amount of duty one year, this would be counterbalanced
by a lesser amount the next, and in the end the aggregate
would be the same.
I desire to call your immediate attention to the present
condition of the Treasury, so ably and clearly presented by
the Secretary in his report to Congress; and to recommend,
that measures be promptly adopted, to enable it to dis
charge its pressing obligations. The other recommenda
tions of the report are well worthy of your favorable con
sideration. I herewith transmit to Congress the reports of the Sec
retaries of War, of the Navy, of the Interior and of the
Postmaster General. The recommendations and sugges
tions which they contain are highly valuable and desrrve
your cart ful attention.
The report of the Postmaster General details the circum
stances under which Cornelius Vanderbilt. on my request,
agreed, iu the month of July last, to carry the ocean mails
betw een our Atlantic and Pacific coast. Had he not thus
acted, this important intercommunication must have been
suspended, at least for a season. The Postmaster General
had no power to make biro any other compensation ihan
the poastages on the mail matter which he might carry.
It was known, at the time, that these postages would fall
far short of an adequate compensation as well as of the
same service had previovsly cost the Government. Mr
Vanderbilt. in a commendable spirit, was willing to rely
upon the justice of Congress to make up the deficiency;
and I, therefore, recommend that an appropriation may be
granted for this purpose.
I should do great injustice to the Attorney General were
I to omit the mention of his distinguished services in the
measures adopted and prosecuted by him for the defence
of the Government against numerous and unfounded
claims to land in California, purporting to have been made
by the Mexican Goverment previous to ihe treaty of cess
ion. The successful opposition to these claims has saved
to the United States public property worth many millions
of dollars, aud to individuals holding title under them to
at least an equal amount.
It has been represented to me, from sources which I deem
reliable, that the inhabitants in several portions of Kansas
have been reduced nearly to a state of starvation, on ac
count of the almost total failure of their crops, whilst the
harvest in e-TV otrn r portion of the country have been
abundant, The prospect before them for the approaching
winter is well calculated to enlist the sympathies of every
heart. The destitution apperas to Ik- so general that it can
not be relieved by private contributions, and they are in
such indigent circumstances as to be unable to purchase
the necessaries of lite for themselves. I refer the subject
to Congress If any constitutional measnre for their re
lief can be devised I would recommend its adoption-
I cordially commend to your favorable regard the in
terest of the people of this District. They are eminently en
titled to your consideration, especially since, unlike the
people of the States, they can appeal to no Government
except that of the Union.

NOTICE. We have a large number of subscribers
who owe for one year's subscription, and several for
more than one year. As we endeavor to conduct busi
ness on the cash system, we hope they will find it con
venient to pay up. The amount each one owes is small,
but in the aggregate it makes an important sum to us.
With but.few exceptions, we think all our subscribers
are willing and ready to pay, but owing to forgetfulness
some have neglected to do so. We think we have a
few who will evade paying as long as they can we dis
like to stop their paper, but if they don't settle we shall
do so, and collect the debt in the best way we can. All
can pay if they choose without putting us to any in
convenience. Washington, Dec. 7. The proceedings of Congress
show a stern resolution on the part of the South not to yield
to any proposed compromise. The antagonism to the
North is daily increasing. It is improbable that any pub
lic business of importance will be transacted till the all
absorbing questiou of compromise or secession is settled.
The South Carolina members are unanimous in their de
sire to prevent a premature collision with the General
Government.
It is thought that Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi,
will make an attempt to persuade South Carolina to detei
the period of her secession.
It is probable that all the Southern members will refuse
to serve on the Committee of Thirty-three, of which Cor
win is Chairman.
The best authority reports that the Republican Sena
held a caucus, and resolved to make no concession.
Southern members pronounce the House special com
mittee a farce. There is not a representative man on it.

and cast the vote of the State for Bell and Everett.
Boston, Dec. 4
Abolition Meeting Broken up. The Abolitionists
of this city called a meeting to-day to honor the memory

his execution, and lauding Virginia, aud passed. The
Abolitionists were unable to be heard.
South Carolina Columbia, Dec. 5. During the de
bate in Legislature, yesterday, establishing an Ordnance
bun au, Mr Rhett said that there had been eight largest

Texas. New Orleans, Dec. 3. Advices have reached
here from Texas,stating that, owing to the unanimous feel
ing for secession, Governor Sam Houston will resign.
Florida. Tallahassee, Dec. 2. The Florida Legisla
ture has unanimously- passed the Couvention Bill. The
Convention meets on the 3d of January next.
Mr Breckingridge regards the Union as in gTeat peril,
and is understood to have views in consonance with
Democrats generally from the border slave States. Senator
Hunter is said to be for a Southern convention which shall
declare the sentiment of the South, and in the event of its
repudiation by the North, that steps shall be devised for
peaceful separation, with division of property, & c.
tThe Committee appointed by the Hou3e of Com
mons to inquire into the matter of the Constitutional or
ganization of that branch of the General assembly, have
informally reported that the House is properly organized,
and that its acts are valid in every particular. The truth
is, the trumped up charge against Mr Cantwell, the prin
cipal clerk, that he acted informally in organizing the
House, was jnade in ignorance of the requirements of law.
Mr Cantwell knows his duties and faithfully performs
them.-RAL. State Jocrsal.
Westers N. C. Road. At a meeting of the stock
holders of this company, held recently in Salisbury, on

CONGRESS.
Congress met on Monday the 3d inst. Nearly all the
southern members were present. Messrs Smith and
Tance of this State, and Mr Miles of S. C, were absent.
On Tuesday the 4th, the President's Message was
read. In the Senate, MrCIingman of N. C. moved that
it be printed, although he said he regarded it as unsatis
factory in the present condition of things. He thought
it fell short of investigating the crisis. He declared
his bemf that many of the southern States would fol
low Sonth Carolina in secession, and he thought the
wisest thing Congress could do would be to divide the
public property as fairly as possible after paying the
public debts. He did not think that the southern States
were acting precipitately. In conclusion, Mr C. said
that our true policy was to meet the issue if we can
maintain our personal safety let us hold on to the Gov
ernment; if not, we must take care of ourselves at all
hazards. He thought this was the feeling-that prevailed
in North Carolina. We have received a copy of Mr
Clingman's speech, in full, and will try to make room
for it in oor next. 4 -
Mr Crittenden said he was for preserving the Union,
and hoped that the example of the gentleman fromX.C.
would not be followed. He viewed disunion with fear
and trembling, and hoped for reconciliation and har
mony. He hoped there would be no angry debates.
Mr Clingman said he approved the desire to preserve
the Union, but when it ceased to protect his people,
North Carolina will bid it good bye.
In the House of Representatives, after the reading of
the President's Message, Mr Boteler of Va., moved to
refer that portion relating to secession to a committee
of one from each State. After some efforts at amend
ment, the motion was adopted yeas 145, noes 38. The
S. C. members and some of those from Georgia, Ale
bama, Miss, and Florida refused to vote, saying that
their States had called Conventions to settle difficulties.
Among those who did not vote were Messrs Craigeand
Ruffin of this State. Mr Winslow was appointed a
member of the committee for N. C, though it is stated
that he, and other southern members, decline tc serve.
in the Senate, on Wednesday, Mr Hale of New Hamp
shire, caused some excitement by a speech. He said
that if secession w as persisted in, war was inevitable.
Mr I verson of Ga., said he did not think there would be
war, but if it come to that the invaders of the South
would be welcomed with bloody hands to hospitable
graves. He declared that five of the southern States
would secede even if the northern States were to repeal
their laws preventing the execution of the Fugitive
Slave Law. Senators Brown and Davis said they be
lieved there wwuld be a peaceable separation, and that
Miss, and Ga. would leave the Union before the 4th of
March peaceably if they could, forcibly if they must.
Mr Green of Missouri, offered a resolution directing
the Judiciary Committee to inquire into the expediency
of establishing an armed police force between the free
and slave States, for the protection of property and the
more effectual execution of the fugitive slave law. He
addressed the Senate and said that the election of Lin
coln was a violation of the spirit of the Constitution,
and If the question could be brought before the Supreme
Court he had no doubt that the election of Lincoln
would be pronounced unconstitutional.
Gen Lane said that the nullifying laws of the north
ern States must be repealed and new guarantees given
to preserve the Union.
Mr Saulsbury of Delaware, said his State was the
first to adopt the Constitution, and would be the last
to countenance separation. When the Union is de
stroyed by the madness of extremists, said he, it will be
time enough for his State to determine what to do.
The House passed the Homestead bill by 56 majority.
On Thursday, the Senate appointed a committee of 13
on secession matters. Both Houses adjourned over to

State and of the South. The proceedings were referred
to the committee on federal relations.
