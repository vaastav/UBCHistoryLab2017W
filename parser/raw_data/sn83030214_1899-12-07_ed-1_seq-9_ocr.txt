munity of Interests between the two republics
jr. the translsthmlan canal, for It Is now abso?
lutely immaterial to the French government
whether the Panama or the Nicaragua or any

of France m the matter Is that the republic of
Ecuador shall not be at liberty to ?ell or cede

DKNT M'KINLEY'S MESSAGE.
Berlin. Dec 0 ?The German Government and
jireie almost unanlmo?ue!y welcome President
?icKlnley's message t<? Congre??. Even the
Agrarian papers, always oppoeed to things
American, grudclng'.y admit that the message Is
fair and honeet The drift of private comment Is
virtually the same. In the lobby of the Retch
nag f>-day similar sentiments were expreseed
without resene by member? of every shade of
political conviction
Emperor "WiHiam, it Is reported, had a long
consultation this afternoon with Count Von
? ..?*. the Foreign Minister, and expreased him
re'r a? rar? much pleased with President Mc?
Klnley's attitude ?nward Germany. It Is also
report?*! that His Majeety discussed the best
mode of glvlr.g official voice to the feelings of
th? Crown fimi the Government. In any event,
oa December 12. the day fixed for the first read?
ing of the budget. Count Von Billow will eelze tha
opportunity of showing Germany'a high appre?
ciation of the friendly tone of the meeaage. Late
thu evening Count Von BUlow authorised The
Associated Press correspondent in Berlin to send
to the T'nlted State? the following a? Ms lm
????SJtoa of the message:
Count Von BUlow regards the message as an
enunciati.,? memorable (bedeutsam) ln the de?
velopment of German-American frlendahlp. The
**??p? tone In which the President speaks of our
mutual relations haa created here the beet Im?
piega :., and one may be eure that the eyin
lathlee exhibited by the President for Germany
ar?? aere ?lncerely reciprocated. Politically,
eventhing (?etween the two countrlea 1? aerene,
ana there is nothing that disturbs the entente
erdia!- (gut? ? !!i\ernehmen). Economically
considered, the contents and tone of the *_***??
*?*?* ?trengthea the hope that the United States.
?*?_ Ita increasing exporta to Germany, will
make fair ronc*?s8ione to German trade, and
?.* reciprocity negotiations will be further
?nducted m a friendly Bplrit to a good end.
The pr?ta particularly rejoice? at the an
?_a_c?a_e_t regarding alliances, despite many
-i-veratlone to the same effect. The
MM-otBcIa "Berliner Post" says:
Pre?'?.. ? ? m Klnley haa put a stop to euch
rumors and guesses, and has placed ln lieu of

Havana. Dec. ??President McKinley*? Mes?
sage to Congress has been receive?! t,y Cubans
of all classes with much satisfaction. Even the
leaders of the extreme party admit this, and the
announcement that there will be no American
Civil Governor has cleared away moet of the
clouds that had been hanging over the Cuban
? political situation. The "Lucha" alone among
the papers still favors a Civil Governorship.
General Collazo says:
The Messapr?? will ?pacify the country. Presi?
dent McKinleys statements ar?? not very con?
crete; but If Congress guarantees the Independ?
ence of Cuba, we need not ask Tor any specifica?
tion as to time or for the removal of the Amer?

to see the black troops go. bejeanM of the (??.

Cubans ft-ar the Administration, but thev do
not fear Congress Th?? Administration repre?
sents the trusts Although Cubans are as good
business men as Americans, they could not em?
pete with the enormous power of the trusts,
which, by creating monopolies, would eventu?
ally enslave the workingman. We wish to SSS
each man owning some property, at least enough
to make It worth his while to behave as a good
cltlr.cn should. Instead of going to th? woods.
Gualberto Gomez says:
I had expected the Message to be encouraging,
but I had not ?xpected such clearness of
thought. Congress wilf go further and will Jus?
tify the hope of the Cul>an people.
The "DlscuElon" says:
President McKinleys Message will fill the
hearts of all lovers of Cuba with Joy. His
?words; "Whatever be the outcome, we must see
to it that free Cuba be a reality, not a name,"
should be written In letters of gold over the
door of the Cut?an White House. The Cuban
republic will bt bound to Lincoln and McKinley
by indissoluble bonds of lot a
The "Patria" says:
Hurrah for President McKinley' He could not
have spoken in clearer tones. It is Impossible
for the giddiness of conquest to overpower the
deep, natural Impulse ot a noble and demo?
cratic people.
The "Cubano" says:
The Message contains the cb-arest words yet
spoken by President McKinley and shows that
Justice la the guiding principle at Washington.

Three hundred Jolly descendant? of tho??? old
Dutch burghers who founded New-Amsterdam ?at
down to the ?lity-flfth annual dinner of the St.
Nicholas Society at Delmonl'-o'e l??t nleht. True
to their motto. ''Orange Roven." the orange waa
aarsr all, for four great streamer? of that color
depended from the cornar? of the eellln?: ?nd met
In a festoon Just under the m?ln chandelier The
feast ?as an elaborate one. and the souvenirs of
Holland delft were works of art. With the coffe?
?Ter? ?llstrlbutisl long clay church wstden ptl"*s.
an?l as tho smoke irle ? ;p in blue wrenth? from
their qnefsMtf carved bowls the ?ound of a tnimpet
was heard at the do"r, und in rame a procession of
the stewards, bearing the sji?-r?d emblem of the
?orlety, the ancient weathercock which u?ed to
stand on the top ?f the 8tadthaus of New-Amster?
dam. Washington Irving preserved It and present
ed It to the society. Tho member? rose to their
feet In Its honor. It was BlSCSd on the ??resident's
and that wa? the signal for the speech
making to begin.
S'?nie aspected that a place on the toast list would
I.?- kept for ?ha; other branch of rir.'y Dutch stock
which Is now making the fight of It? life tn South
Africa-the Boer?, but t?>o mu-h English. Irish and
Scotch blood ha* got mixed up with the Dutch of
Manhattan to make ?uch a toa?t acceptable to all
at a St. Nb-hola? 8oelety dinner. Moreover, there
were present a? Invited guests representative? of
8t George? and St. David's ?ocletles, who might
have felt offended had such a thing been ?lone.
Therefor.?, the Boer? did not appear on the toast
list, but for all that a committee of the. St. Nicholas
Soclef Is raising fund? to be ?ent to Oom Paul'?
government to be expended tn R??d Cross work.
with th? expree? provision that it shall be shared
alike by the P.oer wounded and by Kngllsh prison?
er? who are ?lek or wounded within th* Boer lines.
President Koster F. De. Peyste'r presided, and in
his opening remark? congratulated the society on
It? material prosperity aa evidenced by an overflow?
ing treasury and a long waiting list of applicarne
for members/hip. In mentioning the ten death?
among the members In the last year he paid a
warm tribute to th? worth and the modesty of
their former president. Vornellu? Vanderbllt. Mr.
De Peyster then ?lied for three cheer? for Presi?
dent McKinley and three more for Oovernor Roose?
velt, which were given with a will, as a health wa?
drunk, standing, to each of them, and the orche*?
?ra played "The Star Spangled Banner." Then
came the toast for the ?oclety'e patron ?alnt, St.
Nicholas, which wae responded to by the Rev.
Dr. J. Wests* Rrown. rector of St. Thornaa'e.
He wa? follow?d by James M. Reck. District
Attorney of Philadelphia, who ?poke to the toast
"Our ?Country." Mr. Buck ls a young man, and
?aid he was somewhat handicapped by the
splendor of the, subject he waa asked to handle.
He said be felt ?omewhat like the Irishman who
went to sleep in a hotel leaving word that he must
be called earlv In the morning. He had a long
beard, and aa he ?lept some -.radical Joker cut
It off. When the Irishman was called early next
morning, he arose, but when he ?aught sight of
his altered visage in the looking glass, he ex?
claimed: "Redad, they have called th* wrong
man." and went to bed again. Nevertheless. Mr.
Beck spoke of "Our Country" in a way which won
the hearty and prolonged applause of his hearers,
and brought from the president the remarkr
"There 1? only one thing I don't like about Mr.
Reck and that ls the fact that he doe? not llv? in
New-York."
When the laughter snd applauae which the presi?
dent's sally occaaloned had subsided Mr Ess Peyeter
lntrodu???,! the next ?peaktr. Recorder Goff, who
responded to the toast "Our City." He gave hi?
hearers a ?rood, old fashioned lecture on the manner
In which, h?- salati, they had abdicated the honor?
able placo which their forefathers took ?nd kept
In the m ana sentant and government of this city, a
position which he declared their descendants had
voluntarily abandoned in favor of persona not
nearly s?, ?ell fitted to fulfil those functions.
Ppeak'.na of the ra es which had gradually rhange.l
Dutch New-Amsterdam Into tho grent??t polyglot
: city of the world, h? declared that New-York now
ne.] more Italians than any city In Raly ex?
cept Milan and Naples, more Hungarian? than any
city In Austria-Hungary except Budapest, mure
Pole? than any cl'.y In Poland ?ave Warsaw, more
Qersasna than any city In Germany except Berlin,
more Irl?h than any city In Ireland except Dublin,
and more Hebrew? than any city on top of the
earth
In thl? mlxol population, Recorder Goff declared,
the Dutch "might easily have held the whip hand
In directing Its deetinle?, which they once held, had
th?)- devoted to It a tithe of the brains and energy
they had devoted to the pursuit of wealth and re?
finement. He reminded them that ettlBSns of their
?.?.?... prone to complain that the city gov
err ment wa? not what it ?hould be, and he agreed
with them heartily on that point, but he asserted
that the banker or the lawyer who went out of
town on Election Day in the pursuit of pleasure In?
stead of staying home to ea?t his vote wax not
nearly us much ??ntlt.led to the kind of government
h?- ,1^-lre.i us the coal heaver, who did tro to the
poll? and did vote, wa? entitled to the kind of
government that he de?!red.
ipaschss were also made by John A. Taylor, on
"The Founder? of New-Ameterdam." by Frederic
.1 de Peyster on "The Army and the Navy," and
by Carlisle Norwood on "Our Gueats."
