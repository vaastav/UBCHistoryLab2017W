{Corr- 5-.oiidenec o:' ths Kichraond Dispatch.]
Rtvehview, December 5, 1874.
Thi- neighborhood bas been in a terrible
Mate of excitement for tbe pust month, oc
Kisiatied by the burning of Captain Thomas
Walking's " granary, containing about tive
hundred bushels of wheat, his macbiuery,
:nd farming implements. At 11 o'clock on
tbe night of tbe 31st of October some vil
lains set tire to his stables, containing twelve
or litteeu bead of horses and mules, his
prize tobacco barn, granary, and straw
i'.ack-, all about the same time. Tbe fire
was discovered iu time to save the barn and
stabh-s, but the granary and contents, with
the straw-stacks, were a total loss. Captain
Watkin-, fearing this would be repeated,
wrote to your city for a good detective to fer
ret out the guilty parties. Detective R. B.
Craddock was sent up. unknown to anyone in
tbe neighborhood. He went diligently to
work to bunt them up. Yesterday he arrested
Erasmus Moore, Wyatt Pleasants, and Pre
fecilla Coleman (all colored). They were exam
ined before Justices Hurt and Snead, andsant j
on for indictment before tbe Circuit Court
which meets in March. Tbey were commit
ted to jail. There are several others impli- 1
cited, and Mr. Craddock says he will soon
get them. They have been a terror to this
community for a long time; but tbe negroes '
and ujtau white men, since Mr. Craddock'sj
arrival in thi* county, are completely terror
stricken. They are a vindictive set, and for
the slightest imaginary wrong apply the
torch; and but tor Captain Watkln9, to
whom tbe citizens of this county owe a
debt of gratitude for the action he has taken
iu ridding this community of so vile a gang J
of outlaws, there is no telling where it would
end, as no one was safe. Captain Watkins
has just completed his tine residence, front
ing on und near Staunton river, on which
we have a steamer running from Roanoke
Jtutioa to Brookneal, in Campbell couuty,
uihking three trips per week.

tended with great low oHife occurred on
the Washington City* Villain Midland and
Great Southern railroad about 4:20 yesterday
morning, at Orange Courthouse, Va.-~a point
seventy-four miles south of Alexandria.
The passenger train bound north, under
charge of Captain John Fossetfc, had been
detained some time near GordonavlHe on ac
count of an accident to ibe eccentric of the
engine. Huouing out of time, Orange Court
hou*e was reached, when the machinery
a?ain got out of fix, and another stop wtm
made to repair damages. Just at this time a
stock- train, which had been ordered
to follow in the wake of the passenger
train, made its appearance around a
sharp curve in the road, and despite
the efforts of the engineer his en
gine ran into the sleeping -coach of
the passenger train with great force,- detach
ing the coach from the ladies' car, and carry
ing terror to its occupants, who were nearly
all sleeping. Of the twenty-seven passen
gers in Uiis car only three escaped lojury,
though, fortunately, the wounds received
were generally of a slight character. One
passenger was knocked through the window
of the csr, and landed on ttrra firma some
ten feet off. The car was a complete wreck,
the windows being badly smashed, and the
scats torn from their places and badly broken.
The occupants of the car were principally
Knights Templar, from Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, and other northern citios, with
several from Baltimore. After the sleeping
coach had been detached the remainder of
the passenger train started down a grade
seventy feet to the mile towards Ripidan sta
tion, and the engineer, after having put on
steam, for some cause jumped from the
speeding train, followed closely by the fire
man.
At this juncture the situation became crit
ical, promising the destruction of the remain
ing sixty passengers, when two brave young
men, named Spears and Kemp, crawled
through the baggage-car and over the tender
to the engineer's cab, and shut off the steam,
by which means the train was brought to a
halt, after running six miles. It was found
that the laoie^ car had also been badly
wrecked and a large number of the occu
pants wounded. In all, some forty persons
.were more or less injured, and it seems a mi
racle that all escaped with their lives.
Amongst the travellers were a bride and
groom from Wisconsin, occupying berths in
the sleeping-car. The groom wa9 pitched
out of bed and badly cut about the bead and
face, while the bride escaped without a
scratch. The passengers unite in exon
erating Captain FoWtt from any dere
liction of duty, but are of opinion that
there was a want of proper precaution some
where. A train was speedily dispatched
from Alexandria to the scene of the disaster,
and the wounded reached that city yesterday
afternoon. Nearly all the male passengers
wounded were Knights Templar, returniBg
from the triennial convention at New Orleans.
Their injuries amounted chiefly to scratches
and bruises ; some had head and face-cuts
and bruises which will show rather budly
when they return home to their wives from
the great *' lodge meeting." Arriving in
Baltimore, the Knights Templar and other
passengers bound North went on through.
Several Knights injured rather painfully in
the general smash-up rested in Washington,
and others remained over in Baltimore. Mr.
George L. McCann, Past Grand High Priest
of Baltimore, was in the sleeping-car, and re
ceived slight injury.
A press telegram from Washington gives
the following concerning the accident :
About twenty of the Washington Tem
plars on their way home from New Orleans
were slightly bruised, none seriously. The
engineer of tbe freight train, when he first saw
the approaching train, jumped to his post
and opened the throttle-valve, but too late.
The train being in motion he was thrown
off, and on it sped. Knowing there must
have been such an accident, Mr. James
Kemp, an engineer of the Baltimore and
Ohio railroad, who was among the passen
gers, succeeded in reaching the engine, and.
stopping it, after it bad^ run about
miles.? Baltimore Sun, 8th,
History of the Vicksburg Troubles. ?
Yicksburg ; Miss., December 7. ? Tbere has
been for some time trouble brewing be
tween the Tax-Pay ers' Association and
the city and county officials. The she
riff is acting without a legal bond, and the
Board of Supervisors refused to order a new
one, although the time for paying taxes had
arrived. Two or three other officials were
under indictment for forgery and embezzle
ment, and tbe citizens, despairing of any re
lief from the partisan courts, held a meet
ing last Wednesday, and in a body pro
ceeded to the court-tiouse to demand the re
signation of the sheriff, chancery clerk, trea
surer, and coroner.
All fled except Sheriff Crosby (a negro),
and be signed his resignation. On Saturday
a card appeared in the streets signed " Cros
by," calling all citizens of Warren county,
Republicans, white and colored, to come to
his aid and support him in his position.
Crosby publicly and through the papers de
nied tbe authorship of the card ; yet this
morning armed bodies of negroes appeared
advancing on tbe city from six different
roads. An alarm was sounded about 9
o'clock, and the citizens gathered en masse,
armed, and immediately advanced to meet
the negroes on the Baldwin's Ferry road.
The negroes were met just outside the
city, near Grove street, about 200 strong.
Tbe commaDder of tbe citizens warned the
negroes to disperse, but they refused, and
immediately tiring commenced on both sides.
Tbe negroes retreated about a mile and again
made a stand in the old breastworks and a
bouse, but were soon routed. The loss in
this engagement was one citizen (Oliver
Brown) killed ; about twelve or fifteen ne
groes killed, several wounded, and about
twenty prisoners. On the Hill's Ferry road
about 250 negroes were met and routed after
a Bhort engagement, with several killed and
wounded. Andrew Owens, the negro who
commanded the negroes on tbe Baldwin's
Ferry road, was captured and committed to
jail.
In an interview with a reporter, Owens
says he was ordered by Sheriff Crosby to
come to the city to-day with all the armed
men be could get together. r Alexander
Stockbouse, from Newton, one of the cap
tured negroes, says an order for all negroes
to come to Yicksburg this morning was read
in cburcb on Sunday. Crosby, who is under
guard at the court-bouse, denies that he gave
such orders. It is reported this evening that
negroes are committing depredations in the
country. The intense excitement that pre
vailed this morning bas subsided to a great
degree; yet many citizens are under arms,
and all roads are picketed.
Latest.? Evidence just received renders
it absolutely certain that Governor Ames
and his Attorney-General (George E. Harris)
incited and advised the invasion of this city
by the negroes to-day. This evidence has
been laid before the ablest lawyers of the
city with views to arresting and bringing
these parties to this city for trial.

Washington, D. C., December 8.~ John
P. Brady, a member of the Virginia House
of Delegate?, from Nottoway county, ar
rived here to-day with a series of charges,
to prevent to the House of Representatives
against Congressman Stowell. They are in
substance, first, having appointed one school
craft to a naval cadetsblp while said school
craft resided put of his (Sto weirs) district f
and next, with having received one thou
sand dollars for said appointment* All of
which Brady s^8 will prove.
The charges are in- the shape of a petition
addressed to the Speaker, and recite in de
tail the improper conduct alleged to have
been committed by Stowell.
Mr. Brady found some difficulty in getting
the Radical members from Virginia to pre
sent his petition, having applied In vaia to
alL of them by turns. Each thought it a
delicate matter to handle, and begged to be
excused, while Piatt peremptorily refused to
present it on the ground that Stowell was
as well his personal friend as his political
colleague. Finally, Mr. Brady had an oppor
tunity of meeting the Speaker in Stowell'3
presence and handed the charges to that offi
cer in person, and the under standing now is
that Stowell himself will call it to the atten
Hon of the House during the present week.
Among the witnesses that Brady requests
to be summoned are Secretary Robeson,
Messrs. George W. Graham, A. P. Lathrop,
and S. F. Maddox, of the Virginia State
Senate; Godfrey May, David G. Carr, John
P. Brady, Charles H. Porter, Dr. Beatty Mcr

seems very earnest in prosecuting this affair.
He was introduced to the Speaker by Stowell
himself.

The New York Pre*.? on the President's
Message.
New York, December 8.? Tbe Herald
says: "Tbe message of President Grant is
a more creditable document, botb in point
of reasoning and literary execution, than its
predecessors from the same source. The
President makes it clear enough that in bis
view of tbe three principal causes which
have led to tbe disastrous defeat of his party
are tbe prostration of business, the condi
tion of tbe southern States, and tbe unsuc
cessful experiment of reforming the civil
service. This is not directly stated, but it is
necessarily implied in tbe texture of . bis
views on these subjects. The sum of the
message, so far as it has a party bearing, is
the committal of the President to the resto
ration of a sound currency, an implied pro
mise to treat the South with leniency and
justice, and abandon the civil-service reform
unless Congress supports it by legislation.
This is tbe programme of President Grant
for reinstatisg the Republican party.
"Tbe President has got tbe Spanish ques
tion into 6uch a state that it can be fanned
into a flame whenever be thinks it expe
dient. He relies on tbe country to support
him in a war in which tbe abolition of
slavery in Cuba and tbe breaking of the yoke
of colonial servitude will be the leading
ideas. But General Grant makes a stupend
ous mistake if be thinks be can play this des
perate game with success. If he has 'pi
geon-holed' our just complaint against Spain
with such a purpose be will have cause to
rue tbe day when be meditated such a trick.
"Tbe financial recommendations of the
message are sound in principle but defective
in detail."
The Times considers tbe President's
views on finances have undergone no
change, and bis proposition to repeal the
legal-tender clause as sound. The President
In stating that be will still sustain Kellogg
does not say what be will do about Packard
and Casey, which is a pity.. The Times
thinks the President's reference to southern
matters is plain advice given in kindness
and frankness.
In regard to tbe civil-service reform the
Times says: "We are sorry that be an
nounces bis intention of abandoning tbe
civil-service reform unless Congress dis
tinctly supports it by legislation. It was an
attempt that promised much, and might
have been made to yield great results. With
bis recommendations us to specie payment
and free banking we are in entire sympa
thy." >
The Tribune considers this the best mes
sage of the President, because probably
it was written under tbe chastening of tbe
late elections. It condemns hfs position to
wards Louisiana, but comments mainly on
nearly all the rest of tbe message.
The Sun says : 41 The President's message
is reasonably sound, theoretically, on hard
money and a return to specie payment, but
the President's arguments are not as urgent
as his theories are sound, while some of bis
plans for retiring our paper money and re
viving gold and silver as a circulating me
dium will provoke severe criticism not only
of tbe inflationist", but of tbe bard-money
men as well. With the exception of bis re
commendations of free banking, the views
he now expresses concerning tbe currency
are but a rtiteration of bis veto of the green
back bill of last session."
The World says : " President Grant and
Secretary Bristow are less in doubt than tbe
Republican press and politicians as to the
significance of the overthrow of their party
in tbe late elections. They have reached the
clear opiuion by wnat "means, if by any
means, tbe political revolution can be
stopped midway, and tbe Democratic party
hindered from taking possession of every de
partment of tbe Government in tbe elections
of 1876. They recommend immediate steps
towards specie payments, not promises of
execution which are perpetually postponed,
and a reform of tariff to the end of obtaining
a larger revenue by lower duties on fewer
articles. This, their concurrent advice, ex
hibits tbe President's and the Secretary's ap
preciation at last of tbe great evils from
which the country is suffering, and their ad
mission that those evils are of legislative ori
gin, and admit of legislative remedy. Add
to this the exorbitances and usurpations of
power on tbe part of the Jb'ederal Govern
ment, and General Grant and Secretary Bris
tow will have discovered precisely tbe vul
nerable points in the Republican policy upon
which tbe Democratic assaults have been
concentrated and irresistible. They advise
Congress to abandon tbe defence of what is
Indefensible, and to frustrate further Demo
cratic victories by themselves now doing
what a desparing people have elected the
next Democratic Congress to do."
