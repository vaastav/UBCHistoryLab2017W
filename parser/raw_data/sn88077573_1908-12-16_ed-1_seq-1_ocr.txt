If nny, U desirable to make."
As an inquiry addressed to the
secretary of state it went to the for
eign affairs commltee, which Ignored
It. Yesterday Gardner secured Its
consideration as a privileged resolu
tion and the discharge of the foreign
affairs .from consideration of It .be
cause the committee had held it for
seven days without action.
Then, having won this point, Gard
ner tred to urn tho absurdity Into
a resolution to Investigate the ruleu
ot the American house by amending
it to eliminate- all reference to tho
house of commons. At this point ho
spoke, denouncing tho nouse rules

contrary, mode three men autocrat)

ruled him out of order all along tho
line. Once ho overruled the speaker
on an appeal by a vote of 14G to 131.
Finally the spcakqr was sustained by
a vote of 149 to 13G.
At this point, however, Gardner
still had the floor and his resolution

After offering nny member the floor
who cared to talk Gardner, wltti a
laugh, moved to lay tho Jest on tho
