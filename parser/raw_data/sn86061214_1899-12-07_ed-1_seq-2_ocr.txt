CIRCULATION.
The Ottumwa Courier feafc a larger
circulation than any Ottumwa. news
paper ever had... .larger in the city
and larger outside.
SIXTEEN PAGES TODAY.
This issue of the Semi-Weekly, Cou
tier consists of sixteen pages, instead
of twelve, as usual. The extra lour
pages contain the president's message
In full, which should have careful read
ing by every intelligent citizen, what
ever may be his political affiliation.
The circulation of the Semi-Weekly
Courier is growing with phenomenal
rapidity. Whereas, but a few years
ago! the totai circulation was 1,500, it
is now over 5,000 each issue. The re-.
*ult has been. brought about by the
steadfast determination, on the part of
the publisher of the Courier, to fur
nish subscribers with the very best
semi-weekly newspaper that is, printed
jn the United States. The four-page
miscejlany supplement, added to our
regular' issue a few months ago, has
'been received with great favor. This
additional matter is an expensive feat
ure, costing the Courier over $1,000 a
year, but we believe it will pay. It, is
given- to our readers entirely in addi'
tion. to the regular amount of local,
,'vneighborhood, state and general tele
'graphic news. Those..of (Juri'eubscrib
el's who feel that .tbey are getting
'thfeir money's worljlfj.fand we: know
ythfrt^ thousand^ do this,
can,do' jis great,favor by recpiiprneiMS

ideal, which is to knake .the Ottumwa
Courier the best semi-weekly newspa
per in the United States.
Quite naturally the house adopted
the Heed rules, since they have in tlw
past received the endorsement of botrfj
parties. '-!.• ,...
A great, many papers over.th'e state
are saying that Chprlie Walsh has gone
,back to the Klondike. This is a mis
take Charlie is comfortably spending
the winter in Ottumwa. For 'Charlie's
sake we trust the erroneous statement
'going the rounds of the state'Was not
fathered by the wish that he would
leave the country.

of tie members of congress the repub

that the Dlngley tariff act was prepared

dispatch of the public business. At
their caucus Saturday evening Hender

the Beed rules adopted. It was expect

opposition to the latter, but his kicking
was weak and ineffectual. The demo

their leader. He is Bryan's man.
Whether this betokens any more demo

It was stated in the local column's of
Tuesday's Courier that the Iowa Fire
men's association desires to come to
Ottumwa for. its next annual meeting.
We do not blame the firemen for want
ing to come to Ottumwa, for this is a
good town to visit, and inasmuch as the
association wishes to hold its meeting
here, it should have a cordial invitation
to do so. Ottumwa people are always
glad to i}ave organizations visit the
city and ne^er fail to do all they can
to make their meetings pleasant. Let
'he firemen come. Ottumwa will main
tain her reputation for hospitality.
The owner of a steam carriage at
Providence, B. I., has been, sued for
damage for causing a team to run away
and injure the occupants of a private
vehicle. There is no claim that the
steam carriage was being driven at ex
cessive speed, or that the operator was
in any way negligent. Claimants
simply contend that the carriage is an
unaccustomed sight to horses and be
cause of its liability to frighten them
has no right on the public highway.
It will probably be decided that the
timidity of the horse cannot be allowed
to check the progress of civilization
and inventive genius. Otherwise the bi
cycle, baby carriage, and traction en
gines will all have to be abolished and
the steam railway and cable and elec
tric cars would be in danger. The
horse will soon be such a rare object
on a public highway that he will be the,
obiect of curiosity, if not the cause of
fright.

i'he official crop circular for Novem

agriculture, reveals the fact that there
is a shortage for 1899
an

other years in many of our staple pro
ductions. There was not only 1,500,00b
acres yiess of productive area for cotton
tliis.year tjiau last, but the smallest av
erage •'-leld per acre for many years.
The wield for the United States is esti
mated at less than nine million bale*.
The hay crop is Jess than for several
years, and the quality inferior. In a
a few states thji'ielef.and quality were
both good. It is estimated that the
crop of sugar cane will iSe a fourth less
than last year, In fruits there was a
shortage in apples, pears and grapes,
fipWpes bfcing given only on these. Corn
is 8J.7 .per cent of an average crop

the,estimate of llroomhall's Corn Trade

LIEUTENANT AIUNIWS BLUFF."*
Lieutenant Munro, who boldly bluff
ed a body of eight hundred insurgents
with a single company of cavalry and
captured the whole outfit, together
witji, their artillery and supplies, com
mands admiration not only for his
bravery but for his "cheek" and "gall"
as well. The lieutenaut's successful
venture may be said to be the most dis
tinctly American feat of the war. As
a people we very often gain .success by
taking chances.. We are not cowardly
and are willing to risk much upon a
single throw. Some people might say
we trusted to luck, and perhaps we do.
But it takes nerve—calm, cool-headed
nerve, to trust to luck—and that qual
ity the' American people, taken as a
Whole, have. Lieutenant Munro showed
this American quality in a high degret
tha. other day at Bayombong and this
is why his victory is so distinctly char
acteristic of his own nation. ,,v
THE MULCT TAXES.
An article in the local columns of to
day'^ Courier conveys the information
that the saloon keepers and wholesale
liquor dealers of this city are ,behii.d
in the payment, of their mulct taxes
to the amount of $4,250. The city
council at its meeting ^Monday evening
told the city solicitor to proceed at
once to take steps toward the collec
tion of these delinquent taxes. This is
•right.' City ordinances are pftssed to
be obeyed and not' to be disregarded.
The laws of this city and of'the state
of Iowa compel the payment of certain
taes by the saloonkeepers. To allpw
some,liquor dealers ta be remiss in the
payuient of the license is not fair to
thofe who pay up promptly, and is
certainly not just to the people at
large, for', whose benefit the
license
laws-were passed. -,
THE TRANSPACIFIC CABLE
One of the incidental benefits re
sulting from the acquisition ot our
Pacific islands will be the construction
by the government o'f & cablef from
some convenient.point in California to
Honolulu, ,and thence by -tray of the
Midway islands and-Guam to iUzon, to
be used for paval,, military .an^ postal'
purposes! This 'was recommended by'
the,president in a special message to'
congress late last February,too late for
action in the senate, hut the entire
route from Honolulu to Luzon has
since been surveyed and sounded the
soundings from San Francisco to Hon
olulu having been previously made.
The distance from Salinas Landing to
Honolulu is 2,120 miles from thence to
.Wake Island—an American possession
—is 2,044 thence to Guam, l,293.miles
thence to Jlanilp, 1,350 miles—in nil,
6,^07 miles. AJ1 these landing points
are in' Atrierican territory. Its esti
mated cost will be about $8,500,000, but
it should yield a revenue which 'will
amply compensate for the expendi
ture. For at the greatly reduced rates
proposed it will take all the business.
The present rate from Manila is $2.40
a' word, government messages being a
trifle less. The bill recommended by
the president will reduce these" rates
to 25 cents a word, and to a third of
this for press dispatches. The high
rates now charged are due to the fact
that the present cable runs eastward
from New York across the Atlantic,
the Mediterranean the Bed Sea, the In
dian Ocean and along the eastern
shores of Asia before reaching Hong
Kong and Manila. But this, the first
tr&ns-Pacific cable, will run direct
from our Pacific coast to Manila, and
from that point it will be extended to
Hong Kong, and, according to Secre
tary Long, from/Guam to Formosa,
from which there is a cable to Japan.
The ordinary .objections to the govern
ment going into tihe telegraph business
are disposed of by the consideration of
its military necessity. Communication
will not only be much cheaper over it,
but much' more satisfactory in every
way-
what has been done by the authority
and under the constitution of the sov
ereign commonwealth of Utah.
"I do not wish to discuss the unkind
comments, might say the savage at
tacks, which have been made oil my
father in every part of the countrv,
his own home he is revered and loved
by all who know him well. Every man
has his political enemies, and what
they say count for little. 1 am sure
you had a very impressive object lesson
here Washington only a few days
a?'o, when the populace, which before
had crowned Admiral Dewey as a hero,
so bitterly assailed him. The case, of
course, is not analogous and I do not
mean to imply that it is. 1
"It is easy to represent a man and
turn his purest motives into evil. Oil
general principles do not understand
why those who have incomplete data
and who'cannot understand our peo
ple, syould presume to criticise us."
It is the Liengue for Social Service
that has engaged the counsel to present
the case against Mr. Roberts. Miss
Helen Gould has supplied the league
with the sinews of war which has en
abled it to employ'such an array oi
high priced counsel as has been en
gaged. In addition to Mr. Carlisle and
Mr. Smith, ex-Senator Edmunds has
been retained and retainers have been
offered to ex-President Harrison and
ex-Speaker Reed. Mr. Hepburn has
given the case- of Roberts careful con
sideration and is of the opinion that
the question of proceedure should be
thoughtfully1 considered before any
thing is done, so as to avoid making a
dangerous precedent.
Mr. Hepburn thinks,there is no doubt
that jir. Roberts should not be per
mitted to sit as a member of the house,
and that the only question is to adopt
the most orderly and proper way of
(Protecting, the house, from, having his
presence imposed upon it.
There are several different views of
the case argued, all looking to Roberts
exclusion, and Mr. Hepburn is .not al
tocether certain as to what would be
best. He believes, however, that there
is no flaw in the legal proposition made
from one view of the case, that Utah
has, Bv violation, of the compact under
which she was admitted to Statehood,
forfeited her right to representation in
congress. In his judgment congress
should enforce this forfeiture to tB^
ful-'i
lest extent and deprive Utah of Iter
•statehood, and consequent representa
tion in both houses, of congress, or
the matter' might be carried only to
the extent'of the house declaring tbqt
Utah should be deprived of representa
tion in the ^house until such time as
she saw fit to send to the, house a rep
resentative whose election is not a vio
lation of, the compact made with the
United States government.
MR.. HANNA'S RETIR^MEflST." |.
The retirement of Mark Hanna frotp
pontics will not be seriously regretted
bv people of this country.' Hanna is
UI1 able mtin and an excellent- politi
cian, as politicians-go, but,he has been'
maoe the victim-of a-great hue and

as a monster and made the scapegoat

WM
MISS GOULD'S OPPONENT.
The case ot Roberts, the polygamous
congressman, takes on a feature of ad
ditional interest. On the one side Miss
Helen uould is supplying the sinews of
war to the "antis in paying the fees
of somewhat eminent counsel. On the
other, the Utah congressman has
champion in his daughter. The maid
of the millions and the maid of the
mountains are squarely at odds. Miss
Hoberts is 5 feet fi inches tall and
weighs about 160 pounds. Her com
plexion is clear and white, that of the
hardy mountain girl. Her face is oval,
and her hair is combed back without
the slightest effort at ornamentation.
Miss Boberts, although barely 20 years
of age, has been graduated with the
highest honors from the Utah State uni
versity at Salt Lake City. She also
taught for two years in the public
schools of her native city.
"I would rather not discuss my fath
er's case through the press," said this
young girl to a newspaper correspond
ent, as we are not trying to.gain in
dulgence through the form of public
opinion. It is only natural that I
should feel nrofoundly grieved at the
attacks which have been made upon my
father. I am bis eldest and favorite
child. Since I could walk I have been
his companion and chum. During the
lone and rancorous debates prior to and
after his nomination I acted as his sec
retary. I am here in Washington be
cause I have always been h}s confident
and counselor. I intend to stay here av
his side, no matter what happens. Wo
will not give up our case easily, and It
will not be the work of a day to undo
faqt that lie was too rich.
Americans: do not-like, to see a man of
inordinate wealth occupy high offices,
Hanna has done much for the republi
can party and much for'the people .in
the way of bringing prosperity to the
country, but he was not .. liked and
thought it 'better to leave politics. This
step, taken voluntarily on his,part,
shows Mm to be, in spite of as^ertipn4
to the contrary, a man, of sense .' and
feeling, lie was powerful, and ipighf
have forced Mm'self upon the people, as
Crofcer does, fie did riot ca're, hoWeveri
to continue to represent the people in
name unless he' could also, do so in
fact. When he fully realized that he
was unpopular he took steps to with
draw from public life.- There have
been many worse men than Hanija.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
Today we furnish our readers in ad
dition to the regular amount of'local
and telegraphic news, and miscellane
ous reading, four extra pages contain
ing- the president's message ib full.
The message is a.great state paper,
which ought to be read by every intel
ligent citizen. A cursory glance at fhe
topics discussed will give some idea of
the many and exceedingly important
questions to be dealt with by the con
gress, which has just assembled. A
careful reading of the message, in its
entirety, will, we think,, convince ev
ery one that ,no congress, since the
years of the civil war, has been called
upon to face greater responsibilities
than that- .now in session. President
McKinley has shown a wonderful
grasp of the situation in the manner
in which he has presented these'great
problems to congress. Nothing seems
to have been overlooked, or omitted,
and every question is met- fearlessly,
with a recommendation for positive
legislation. In it President McKinley
has demonstrated once more to the
American peojple, that he is a states
man of the highest rank. He'has ex
hibited a straightforwardness and
courage, in his recommendations, that
cannot fail to win a sincere admir
ation and respect, even from those
partisans who differ with him' as to
the best national policies. There is no
.uncertain sound in what President Mc
Kinley recommends and the new con
'gress, with its working republican ma
jority in both branches, is made up of
the right kind of timber to carry out
and enact into law the recommenda
tions of the president in a manner to
bring continued prosperity to this na
tion, and an example of happiness,
progress and development to our new
possessions. The fortunes of war
have placed & great responsibility up
on the American people. The presi
dent of the United States has shown a
superb courage in facing these respon
sibilities. He will have the support
and co-operation of congress, and the
endorsement of the people at large in
the grand work, of civilization, which
t*n over-ruling Providence has placed
in the hands of this 'nation.
"IMP?'
BAD COMPANIONS.
The old proverb which tells how evil
companions reflect seriously on one's
own character and good name, has
found a modern proof in an incident
which occurred at Columbus, Ohio, the
other day. It appears that a church
society of good colored Methodists ar
ranged for and gave ia boaer of the
THE OTTUMWA COURIER: THUKS DAY, DECEMBER 7. 1899.
national day Of Thanksgiving, a din
ner, of which the piece de resistance
was to .be 'possum. But when the
wliole-souled brethren gathered to par
take of the cheer, and when the fine
,*ld dish so loved in the days "befo' de
wah" was placed smoking hot upon the
tables, the olfactory nerves of the
diners were assailed by an odor the
like of which never before Tose from a
platter of roast 'possum. Some of
those -present- thought they remember
ed having smelled that smell in other
dnys, and fleeting recollections of in
nocent childhood days down on the
farm where they had guilelessly tried
to be friendly with a pretty, spotted
I cat in the old woods pasture, crossed
their minds". Others, whose senses
were blunted by the magic terni,
'possum, partook of the dish and were
made ill. In short, the boasted 'pos
sum smelted and tasted very like a
skunk.-
In their jextrcmity the church peo
ple sent thejnfanious roast 'possum to
Prof. Hines,.of the state university, for
examination, and the result showed
that it was "merely another case of a
good thing suffering from ill-chosen
associates. Prof. Hine said the atoimal
was beyond doubt an opossum, but he
detected the unmistakable odor of the
skunk, which he said was probably due
to the fact that the animal had been
associated in life with members of the
skunk family.
"The evil that men do lives after
them the good is oft Interred with
their bones." So it was with our opos
sum friend. Let this be thfe moral
which points the tale: A bad name is
often most innocently gained.

Dairy Inspection.
Des Moines News: In his annual re
port Secretary Wilson makes1 some
recommendations- which are of vital
interest to the dairy interests of the
country. -The secretary's suggestions
are of special importance to Iowa's
gre^t'dairying industry. Our export
trade in butter and* cheese has grown
into large proportions, and taking ad
vantage of this fact-unssrupulous ex
porters have sent large quantities of
inferior goods to England, where our
dairy products have gained a good rep
utation. Counterfeits and imitations
are freely-made. In one instance nam
ed by the secretary the style of pack
age used was the same used by the de
partment in its experimental depart
ment. Secretary Wilson says that this
fraudulent practioe is hurting the le
gitimate export trade, and more than
offsets the good work done by the de
partment in pushing the American
product.
He advises that the system of meat
inspection pow in operation be ex
pended to dairy products, and says
the national and state dairy associa
tions favor such inspection.
Iowa congressmen should be urged
by their constituents to favOr this nec
essary legislation.

the death at Iowa City, in September,
of Mrs. Sarah Newsome, at the age of
93 years. The letter which announced
to Mrs. Harland the death of the old
nurse of the famous Bronte children,
enclosed a letter written to Mrs. New
some by the father, 1'eter Bronte, in
18D5, telling of the changes wrought
in the family, including the death'Of
his daughter, Charlotte. Among Other
things, Mr. Bronte wrote: "You little
thought that the children you nursed
on your knee would be as much notic
ed by the world as they have been.
Emily and Annie wrote and published
clever books, and Charlotte's writings
and fame are known in all parts of the
world where genius and learning are

Discouraging for Democrats.
Davenport Times. Conditions in tho
Philippines are not such as will justify
the democrats in making any particu
lar ado over the .matter of imperialism
in the early stages of the .present ses

warrant them.in carrying obt any con
templated program having, in view a
demand for tbe withdrawal of the
troops. The latter are doing entirely
too good work to be discharged at a
time when they are furnishing an in

Bryan Will Stick.
Sioux City Tribune: Tlie New York
Times demands the withdrawal of Mr.
Bryan. His ruthless ambition to be
come a candidate for the presidency is
declared to threaten the destruction of
the democratic party therefore, he has
no right to expect the support, toil and
expense of a campaign doomed to such
a aismal ending. The gold standard, it
is pointed out, obtains in nearly every
state in the' union, and that for him
to run for the presidency would be an
act of political futility. How Hanna
and McKinley must chuckle over this
they know tbe man, they know he will
stick, and that- is all they care to
know—just now.

Marsballtown Times Republican
There will be two brothers in the next
house of representatives, one of them
being Henry D. Clayton from Alabama,
and the other T. D. Clayton from New

ews of ex-Senator Pugh, of Alabama.
This has not occurred since the Hoar
brothers, George Frisbie and Ebenezer
Jtockwood, sat together in the FoHy
third congress and, what 'was' tven
more remarkable, the husband of their
sister, whose name we cannot recall,
satin the house with them. Two Stev
