Temperance Lecture. The Methodist

on Temperance from Mr. A. M. Collins.
Those who hare beard JonN B. Gocsn, and

Death of Mr. Bamford. We regret to
learn throngh Thomas Gobrill, Esq. of the
death of Richard Bamford, which took place
at the Empire House at six o'clock on Tuesday
evening last. Mr. B. was about sixty-fire years
of sge, a native of England, and for many years
was in the employ of the Messrs. Wai.bkidoi
of Toledo. He was an industrious and hard
working"mao. For the past two or three years
he has been in charge of the Empire House in
Troy township.
Exciting Trial.- Some excitemect hss been
created over a trial in Justice Schwind's Court,
in which JonN Fbbcksb is plaintiff, and P.
Cbankbb A Sons, defendents. Two days were
occupied in the first trial and the Jury failed t
agree. One day was taken up in the second, and
the second Jury found a verdict in favor of plain
tiff forti 80. Mr.J. H. Rgio was the Attorney
for plaintiff, and Mr.J. R. Ttlib for delendent.
Owing to a difficulty between the Squirt and Mr.
Tvleb, the former has Issued a warrant for the
arrest of the Utter for contempt of Court.
It Will Pnyl aud How. We heard
recently of two farmers who each came to the
village with a load of grain. One accepted th
first offer of six cents bus:ie" over bis pieciotis
sal. The other having real io his local paper
of an advance of 15 to 20 ceuts per bushel, held
off until be obtained Mi cents advance, or tl
more than the other on 32 bushels of the same
quality of grain. The paper cost him 12 for s
whole year. The above instnnce was only one
of several of such gains (luring the year, in s ilea,
and purchases. Did th paper ptttt His fami

Any of our farmers may, .if they can find a
copy of the Bowling Green Stntiiul, turn to tba
county advertising and find it spread out and

The President's Message.
Congress assembled on Monday last, and the
President's Messago, with the reports of the De

o much pleasure to lay them before onr read

the Journal. Their Importance will seoure for
them an attentive and impartial perusal.
It I notable foot that the terseness of Oen.
Grant's speeches and writings have hitherto
oreated great favor with the publio. Tholr very
brevity made tkem appear a bordoring on the
neuter. Th message which h hss jnst de
livered to Congress, i an exception to that
rule, Th President hss amplified his View
therein, so thst his capacity aa a statesman at
th helm of tha ship of state m ay be fully ap
prehended. Th policy Indicated by it In onr foreign rela
tion in adjusting th Alabama and other claims
on foreign nation, are such as will command
th respeot of every eonslderat reader. Th
same may also be said of it in regard to much
that Is stated concerning th Internal affair of
the astion. Th other matters adverted to on
which, in th Republican party 'itself, a wide dif
ference of opinion exists, for th reconciling o f
which the President's message afford but little

sustain the Chief Magistrate, while he may use

Mrs. D. bad been a professor of religion for
over thirty-fire years, her connection with the
Presbyterian church of this place having begun
July 1835. Fur many years her church rela

Mr. Durr was pastor, but of late years she was
connected with the Presbyterian church of this
place. But her social relations were not boun
ded by any church, nor her sympathies hedged
in by any arbitrary distinctions. She had
heart for all and a place in all hearts.
tier last davs were u svs ol aneuish and suf

and suffering : but her offerings were borne
with a wonderful patience and ber death sntici
ated with rusiguauon, tier sutlerings, she
said, were nothing wben compared with those
of Him who sweat, as it were, great drops
blood, and on tlun she would lean while passing
through the darK valley.
When she felt that the end had come, with
prayer to her Saviour to receive her spirit, and
and a request to her attendants to be composed

she lay back from ber pillows aud peaceluliy

But to thy loan, my darling-,
I cannot be rosign d.
' Oh I I have lost thee, Lula,
In vain I try to sayi
"Thy will b don," oh ! Father,
Thy will ba don to-day.
I've searched among th flowers,
And'ln th pleasant grove,
I've wandered through tha woodland
la all the path we lor.
But, oh I t cannot find the,
Thon art lost forever mora,
And In vain I sadly listen
For thy step npoo the floor.
Lulu darling, when tha shadows.
Darken all th earth with gloom,
Then I coma with tondsr footstep
To tlii secret place, thy tomlr.
And I think beneath th daisies
Thon art lying cold and whito,
With thy sunny golden ringlets
Clustering round a fee of light
And thy snowy hands are folded,
All their work on earth is o'er
Oh I my heart is breaking, Lulu,
Thou art lost forever mora.
Oh I hsrk to tha beautiful voice from the skia,
Where sorrow ne'er enters, and friendship ne'r
die,
Sad mourner, look upward, thy Lulu Is near,
Mourn nut for the eaaket, the jewel is her.
