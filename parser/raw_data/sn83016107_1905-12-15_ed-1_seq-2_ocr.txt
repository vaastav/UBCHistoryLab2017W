INCENDIARISM.
The report of the Harford Mutual
Fire Insurance Company, which was
submitted to the nieml*rs on Mon
day by the board of directors, con
tains a statement that is most alarm
ing to the best interests of any civi
lized community. In making up their
list of causes for fire, the largest
single item is supposed incendiarism.
When we think of the many ci.cum
stances to which an origin can be
traced, and find that the one causing
most serious loss, is from this felony,
it would seem that the laws of our
state lack the proper enforcement.
In criminal circles, it is a well recog
nized fact that this felony is one of
the most difficult to punish as detec
tion is surrounded by so many circum
stances that allow the criminal to
escape. Anticipating the better en
forcement of the law. our state legis
lature created the office of Fire Mar
shal for the purpose of ferreting out
the incidents surmounting all sus
picious fires. This office has at its
command, a sum of money sufficient
to employ all modern methods of de
tecting criminals, yet so lar the re
sults do not seem to be very satisfac
tory.
This crime is one of the most severe
under the criminal code, being punish
able by death in the discretion of the
court. The seriousness of possible
consequences justifies a commensu
rate penalty, but it would seem from
experience that this branch of our
state government should employ
more effectual means of detecting
criminals, thereby lessening this
grave crime.
THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
The President's message, which
was read in Congress last week, and
made public immediately thereafter,
is a strong, able, but voluminous
document. The needs of oar country
are large, and it requires some
30,000 words for Mr. Roosevelt to in
telligently bring the same to the at
tention of our national law-making
body. His choice of words is excel
lent and their meaning unquestion
able.
As was to be expected, his chief
recommendation was government
control of railroad rates. In preceding
messages, Mr. Roosevelt's outlines
ate strong, but the present message
is clearer, and more forcible than any
former utterances. He not only ad
vocates that rates be inspected by a
department of the government, but
that there also be a national super
vision of the books and statements
of each of these corporations. He
also urges that this supervision be
extended to private car lines, indus
trial roads, refrigerator and elevator
charges.
Government by injunction, as re
lating to the settlement of differences
lietwcen capital and laborisalso dis
cussed. The president was in favor of
b'miting the power of Federal judges
to the extent of requiring them to
pass nisi orders, giving notice to the
other side, so as to allow an oppor
tunity for hearing both sides should
the circumstances of the case permit.
lie urges that all kinds of insur
ance companies be placed directly
under the government control. “The
great insurance companies offer
striking examples of corporations
whose business is extended so far be
yond the jurisdiction of the states
that created them, as to preclude
strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by parent states,”
The tariff question is somewhat
.shied at; about the only point being
a well-directed thrust at the states
that have made individual stands on
this important question.
fie recommends that a publication
be made of all campaign contribu
tions and that contributions be pro
hibited by corporations.
The subject of the navy is always
dear to the President’s heart, and
while he recommends no increase in
units, yet he thinks it would be
proper to each year replace some
ancient type of ship with a modern
sea-fighter. On the subject of army
regulations, he prefers promotion by
selection instead of seniority.
Reforms in the business methods of
the different bureaus and depart
ments are especially urged. This
would have the effect of abolishing a
great deal of useless red tape that
sometimes rentiers our public service
an absurdity.
Other recommendations made an;
That the entire code of the United
States criminal laws and land laws
be revised; the graves of the Con
federate dead be cared for by the
nation; the admission of Indian
Territory and Oklahoma as one
state, and Arizona and New Mexico
as another; that sufficient money be
at once appropriated tocarry on the
work of the Panama canal.
Outside of its length, the nation
should feet proud of the message as
a state document. The time will
probably come when presidents will
realize that their messages must be
shorter in order to get the average
citizen to read them. Until that
time most persons willc Mttcnt them
selves with abstracts ar.d ifflticisms,
which the press finds necessary in
order to make the tame Accepta
ble to the public.
A PROPER FINDING.
The court martial in the '-asc of
Midshipman Minor Meriwether, Jr.,
has rendered a verdict which has
been practically approved by Secre
tary Bonaparte, and will receive the
endorsement of every intelligent per
son who has closely followed the
case. It will be remembered that Mid
shipman Meriwether was charged
with causing the death of Midship
man Branch by blows inflicted in a
prize fight. Tnefindingsof the court
acquit the defendant of the charge
of manslaughter, but find him
technically guilty of engaging in a
fisticuff’ for which he is punished by
being publicly reprimanded and con
fined to the Naval Academy grounds
for one year, but is allowed to go
aboard ship for practise cruises.
The findings of the court are not
commended because we justify these
methods of settling disputes, but
under the circumstances, “the code
of honor” at the Naval Academy is
such that had young Meriwether re
fused to fight, he would have laid
himself open to the taunts of his
equals and the contempt of his supe
riors. So long as this brutal method
of settling disputes is tactically ap
■ proved by the officials of the Naval
Academy, we must expect events of
this nature just as brutal, though
not often ending with fatal results.
We would have more cordially en
dorsed the work of the court martial
had it properly censured, or even
punished those who are responsible
for the methods now in vogue.
WHAT IT COST TO ELECT MR.
ROOSEVELT.
One of the newspapers in Washing
ton, in a friendly manner, recently
published an article giving the fig
ures that it cost to elect Mr. Roose
velt president of the United States,
According to this statement, the
expenses of Chairman Cortelyou
were $1,800,000. When the cam
paign was over, he had about SIOO,-
1 000 in bank. It is said that Mr.
Cortelyou had $900,000 less than
Chairman Hanna had in 1900, and
■ nearly $2,000,000 less than in J 896,
’ It is also declared that President
Cleveland had over $4-,000,000 in
the campaign of 1892.
According to this statement, the
I sum of $"00,000 was turned over to
committees in New York, New Jersey,
’ West Virginia, Massachusetts, Con
i . 6 . . . ’
necticut, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin
and Nevada. For literature it is
stated that $530,000 was expended;
for speakers’ bureau, $175,000; for
lithographs, advertising, etc., $150,-
’ 000; for miscellaneous expenses,
$50,000, and for salaries and head
quarters expenses, $150,000.
from 10,000 different sources, about
4,000 being known, leaving 0,000
’ unknown to the chairman of the
national committee. The name of
the largest single contributor, who
gave upwards of SIOO,OOO is un
known either to the chairman or
Treasurer Bliss.
It will be very interesting reading
to have the Republicans show how
much of this sum came from life in
surance companies, but we presume
this information will never be ob
tained Irom any source save the
committee of investigation that is
now turning things upside down in
the insurance world in New York,
