LORD BYROX'S PROSE AXD POETRY
There lire two elaborate editions of
the works of Lord Byron appearing in
- England. Both editions are carefully
edited by literary men of distinction.
They have" been appearing for some
year or so. "We have seen neither edi
tion, but they are praised by cpmpe-
- . tent English critics. The one we would
be particularly glad "to have and to
hold," Is edited by Roland E. Prothero,
formerly a fellow of Oxford University,
and with sundry degrees conferred.
- The sixth volume is not yet the end.
We think six are required to contain
the "Letters and Journals" alone of
the eminent poet. There are two vol
umes of poetry yet to come. Byron
was one of the most interesting and
consummate masters of letter writing
who have lived in any age or country.
We recall that in the forties, while at
the University of Xorth Carolina, we
.r?ad with consuming interest the life
of the poet by Tom Moore, the gifted,
mellifluous Irish bard. He published a
goodly number of letters from the poet
and they were full of personal charm
and literary cleverness. The new vol-
- ume referred to contains, as we learn,
some hundred letters that have never
been printed before, 'ihis will prove to
be of genuine Interest to the true
' Byronic admirer. "We do not know who
"is the chief reviewer for the New York
Tribune, but he is scholarly, able, in
dependent, and gifted with mental
health and literary sincerity. He writes
as he thinks and he thinks well. His
insight ordinarily is excellent and his
taste admirable. Reviewing the last
of Byron's letters in the Murray edition
we are noticing, he begins in this wise:
"There could be no better testimony
to the enduring fascination of Byron's
correspondence than the feeling of fe
i.:et which arises on reaching the end
of It in the definitive edition of the
1 poet's writings. One would willingly
have the letters go on indefinitely. But
v'nee, even, with the substantial addi
tions made by Mr. Murray, we must be
content with six volumes of them, we
have at least one consolation; every
one of them can be read, and re-read,
and re-read again. That is one sign
of the Immortal quality in Byron. For
many Tears he suffered a neglect per
haps more apparent than real (he has
never, of course, been without a large
public), but of late it has seemed as if
he were being more widely read than
ver; and we believe that as this new
edition of him makes him bttter and
better known the prophecy or Matthew
Arnold will be more than fulfilled."
Mr. Arnold, a great English critic and
essayist equalled but by few prophe
sied that Byron would again be real
by lovere of high literature would1
come to his own again. The Tribune
critic thinks the letters so fine that
they "must be inevitably a great help
In making the verse better understood-"
If you will read Byron's letters his
prose you will see the accomplishments
of superb intellect, and that they com
pare well with the supposed writers of
greatest success in letter writing with
Cowper, Horace, Walpole. Fitzgerald,
- . and others in England, and with the
most famous letter writers in France.
V The effort to pooh-hooh Byron made by
a few prominent critics in the past has
failed. That great 1 critic in the first
quarter bf the last' century. William
Hazlitt, wrote most dispairingly of
Byron, and even abused and under
rated him scandalously. But the
Byronic candle was not to expire under
such hostile attacks. "Within a few
years a well known Victorian critic.
Professor George Saintsbury, in his use
ful work on the "Literature of the
Nineteenth Century" vigorously attacks
him, and seeks to reduce him if pos
. sible to a rather indifferent poet. But
.'all this fails. , Byron was indeed a
writer of splendid gifts, and his best
poetry has upon It the stamp of en
durance, and will be read when his
assailants are well nigh forgotten or
are remembered because of their vitu
perative, caustic criticism of one of the
most masculine poets in the great vol
ume of English literature.
Byron was a lover himself of great
literature. He had wide reading. The
Tribune writer says that "of the wide
scope and Interesting character of his
reading," that it "ranged from Plato to
Horace "Walpole. from Song of Solomen
to Voltaire. Judging from the number
Of quotations indicated. R would appear
that his three favorite authors, in the
order named, were Shakespeare, Scott
and Pope." Now little fellows who are
image breakers and character smash-
. ers deride Scott and think him but a
-"sounding brass and a tinkling cym
baL" A carefully prepared volume or two
qf selections from Byron's poetical
flrorks would furnish the fastidious and
moral reader with much of the noblest
and most splendid poetry in the rich
"literature of Great Britain. The -German
author who is placed above all the
poets of his country, right or wrong,
; and who is magnified into such extreme
greatness by admirers, placing - him
Trithv Homer Dante and above Mil
ton, Goethe, had great admiration for
Byron and wrote much concerning him.
He had 'acuter discernment and higher
appreciation, pt sreat poetry, than Haz
litt, Saintsbury, and the recent coterie
of disparagers who would reduce him
to the intellectual dimensions of Long
fellow and Bryant and Kipling:
Did you ever read that unique and
original little bock b- Andrew Lang,
he calls "Letters to Dead Authors." He
has a poetic epistle addressed to Lord
Byron. The volume first appeared in
1S86. It contains a keen rebuke to
Swinburne, a really very gifted poet,
but a soured and unequal critic, who
made a savage assauli on Byron mak
ing him a pretender and a fraud. Lang
has acuteness of understanding and
wields a facile and keen critical blade.
"We make an extract that Is brilliant
and engaging. Writing mind you, to
Byron, who died in 1824, sixty-two years
before Lang wrote his epistle, he says:
"I was saying
That half our English Bards are turned
Reviewers,
And Arnold was discussing and assay
ing The weight and value of that work
of yours.
Examining and testing it and weighing.
And vowed the gems are pure, the
gold endures.
While Swinburne cries with exceeding
joy
The stones are paste and half the gold
alloy.
In Byron Arnold finds the greatest
force.
Poetic in this later age of ours.
His song a torrent from a mountain
source.
Clear as crystal, singing with the
showers.
Sweeps to the sea -in unrestricted
course
Through banks o'erhung with rocks
and sweet with flowers ,
None of your brooks that modestly me
ander. But swift as Awe along the Pass of
Brander."
The gifted Scotsman himself a poet,
essayist, critic, historian, novelist and
biographer continues as he glances to
the close of this prolific century:
"And when our country has clomb
its crest,
And backward gazes o'er the plains
of Time
And counts its harvest, yours is still
the best' etc.
Lang pours a hot shot into Swin
burne and other foes, and say that "o'er
the Eagle thus the Bantam crows." He
refers to the appreciation of Byron in
Europe, and writes:
"The Germans, too. those men of blood
and iron.
Of all our poets chiefly swear by
Byron."
The epistle closes with touching lines:
"Farewell! thou Titan fairer than the
gods!
Farewell, farewell, thou swift and
lovely spirit.
Thou splendid warrior with the world
at odds,
Unpraised, unpraisable. beyond thy
merit;
Chased, like Orestes, by the furies' rods.
Like him at leneth thy peace dost
thou Inherit.
Beholding whom, men think how fairer
far
Than all the steadfast stars the wan
dering star-"
Some other time we will undertake to
show in what Byron's great gifts as a
poet consisted.
fiLBAMXU AXD COMMENT.
Representative Crumbacker, of Indi
ana, is very warm in the collar just
now. He is extremely anxious to re
duce southern representation in the
congress. He says two-thirds of the re
publicans already favor an action and
he expects enough will be found to deal
with the south. His aim is to punish
the whites in all southern states that
have dared to disfranchise Mose and
Josh. His heart warms toward them.
Although he knows his party committed
a great crime against sense, honesty,
decency, justice and right, when they
enfranchised 4.000.000 of ignorant, illit
erate, superstitious blacks, and that
but few of them after thirty-six years
are fitted to exercise tht right' to vote
with intelligence and safety to the
states, he Is vet anxious in the black
ness of his heart to punish the whites
who dare to apply tests to their quali
fications to vote. He Js a! bitter parti
san and negrophilist and an enemy to
the white race in the south. The south
will not be ruled by Ignorant negroes
and ten thousand Crumbackers cannot
bring it about.
Some of the best newspapers consid
er the president's message as excessive
ly long, as verbose. It fatigues the
mind to carry all the points and confus
ion may follow. There is a want of
definite recommendations say some. A
stirring point made is to compell the
trusts to give publicity to their opera
tions. He says: "What further reme
dies are needed in the way of govern
mental regulation- or (taxation can
onlv be determined after publicity has
been obtained by process of law and In
the course of administration." The
word "taxation" he uses is explained
by the New York Evening Post in this
way: "Mr. Roosevelt, as governor of
New York, caused the franchise-tax
law to be passed, and that he said in
one of his messages to the state legisla
ture that if all other remedies for trusts
and combines failed, that of taxation
remained There is no other word half
so dreadful to the promoters of trusts
as the word taxation, because that is
something which they cannot buy off.
When the public mind is once fixed upon
it, lobbyists and party bosses are pow
erless to divert the lawmakers from it."
A A A
While republican senators and re
publican representatives and. herhaps,
a republican president, wish the trusts
to continue in unrestrained sweep and
vigor, there is a sign in the political
heavens that the star-gazers in the old
wicked party might look fcipon. At Lew
iston. Me., a few days ago there met
the National Grange, as it is called. It
drove a few nails in the subsidy coffin.
It said in a resolution in denunciation of
the big scheme to rob the people: "We
have reasons founded on sound princi
ples of statesmanship to oppose a
scheme that contributes to the profits
of the few at the expense of the many,
without adequate return. The tolling
farmers of the land have . developed
American agriculture until Its products
constitute a majority of the exports,
without government aid, and we under
stand that American steamships are al
ready yielding their owners profits in
transporting these and other products
to all parts of the world, without gov
ernment subsidies. The farmers of the
country ask for no special - favors in
legislation, and oppose in the most vig
orous manner such special favors to
shipbuilders and owners, as are embod
ied In what is familiarly known as the
ship-subsidy bill."
That is sound, sensible, positive and
to the point. The paternal government
is too paternal. It should quit or go
out of that business. What hits the
subsidy scheme hits also the greater
trust robberies perpetrated under, im
proper, special, discriminating legisla
tion. Kill the trusts and smother the
subsidy game of plunder.
v
Divorce laws generally In all the
states are bad, unrighteous, vicious
laws. They demoralize and curse. In
Providence, Rhode Island, the land of
money and superior education, there are
6S7 cases, for divorce. In Washington
City there are 300 cases. This shows
how the curse widens. It is as infec
tious as scarlet fever or Yellow Jack.
The law of God is forgotten by legisla
tors who forget and ignore him.

When Americans have had an oppor
tunity, like the British, they have car
ried their "institutions" with them
cards, drinks, etc. But when they turn
ed up in the Philippines they found
that "drinks" were no where. The na
tive have a drink called, "vino," and it
is a long way ahead of American whis
key, even when drugged. The natives
imbibe, but it leads to insanity and
crime. Its use by the American soldiers
plays havoc and is now made a military
offence. General Bell, out there, has is
sued an order, from which we copy as
follows, showing the capability of Fili
pino vino in its results:
"Acute Insanity, frequently resulting
in death within a few days.
"Many cases of serious disability, ne
cessitating discharge on sargeorf's certi
ficte of disability.
Large numbers of grave crimes, in
cluding murder and rape, necessitating
frequent trials and punishments, thus
depriving the government of servjee due
it
"Many abusive outrages committed to
the discredit of the United States and
of Americans."
The ministers in Atlanta belonging to
the Evangelical Association, held their
monthly meeting and discussed the cig
arette question. It was the opinion of
several ministers that "the cigarette
was doing more harm than whiskey, as
it led to whiskey and everything else
that was low and degraring." A com
mittee was appointed to confer with the
committee from the senate.
AAA
Georgia like North dis
cussing the "greatest man" that state
has had. A well known lady of talents
says it was Robt.Toombs. Another wirt
er thinks it was George Michael Troup.
He says of his eminent and able man
of the past: "Governor Troup was the
essence of principle in everything he
did. He hated the word compromise
and policy when a principle was involv
ed. All of his letters and speeches
bristled with principle. He never went
on political crutches and prated about
what other men said or did. His mind
was far too original for that, and self
reliant."
AAA
That means very much and we like
it. It is not infrequent that public men
now hobble around on crutches, and
some carry two a republican populist
crutch, or a democratic-republican
crutch No man should be trusted for
an hour who cannot walk upright with
out any crutch and . no hobbling or
wobbling. Tombs was indeed a great
man. and we have been more impressed
as to his supreme abilities than any
other Georgian who has come under
our observing eye for a half century.
The evidence to showUhatrDr. Craw
ford Long, of Georgia, 'was the real,
first discoverer of surgical paresthesia
has-been published many, years to the
country. But the Yankees have got the
honor and thus robbed the south of an
important honor. Everybody ought to
know who Dr. Marion Sims Is a na
tive of South Carolina, and the great
est genius in surgery this country has
ever seeni .He wrote in 1S77, in a little
pamphlet, as follows: "The state of
Georgia will, at no distant day, erect
at the national and at its capitol or its
university a statue of Long, who was
unquestionably the discoverer of surgi
cal anesthesia." He stated "that Long
was the first man to intentionally pro
duce anesthesia for surgical operations,
and that this was done with sulphuric
ether In 1S42. That Long did not by
accident hit upon it, but that he rea
soned it out in a philosophical and log
ical manner, x "That Wells, without any
knowledge of Long's discovery, demon
strated, in the same philosophic way,
the principle of anesthesia by the use
of nitrous oxide gas in 1844." We get
the extracts from a recent communica
tion in the Atlanta Journal.

German is an important customer of
the United States. It Is known that it
is engaged in the constructing of a new
tariff that will operate to the disadvan
tage of this country, when we can not
comdain if it Is done. A high Chinese
wall arrangement called a high pro
tective tariff is just as proper for Ger
many as for the United States. In cne
vear this country exported 5134,000,000
to Germany. That is greater than is
shipped to any other country except
Great Britain. orv rather to embrace
more, the United Kingdom. What was
shipped is divided as follows: Bread
stuffs, $32,000,000; cotton, 564,000,000;
meats, 520,000,000; tobacco, 53. 000.000; oil
cake and oil cake meal. 54,000,000; fruits
and nuts. 52.000.000. It is supposed that
Germany will not tax cotton but the
cereals, etc.

CAUGHT IN A FIRE TliAP
Children Thrown From Window.
Mother Perishes lu Trylntr to Snrea
Daughter
Pittsburg, December 5. Two persons
we,re burned to death and seven injur
ed in a fire at Carnegie, Pa., this morn
ing. .The dead are: Mrs. Sarah Klee
and her 9-year-old daughter. Several
members of the Klee family were in
jured. The Klee residence is a two
story frame house on Broadway, the
ground floor front being devoted to a
grocery store kept by Klee. and the rest
of the house being occupied by the
family.
The fire was discovered about 4:40
o'clock this morning by the gocery
clerk, Morris Fizis. He immediately
gave the alarm, but the flames spread
so rapidly that the occupants of the up
per story were shut off from the stair
way and Klee and his wife realized that
there was but one way to save the chil
dren and that was to throw them from
the window, a distance of about twenty
feet. One by one the children were
brought to the front window and drop
ped to the ground by the father. All
of them were more or less seriously in
jured, but all escaped death from the
flames, except Mary. By the time Har
ry, the baby, was reached, not only was
the father exhausted with his exertions
and the terrible conditions under which
he worked, but the flames were fast
making his efforts impossible. When he
was able to get at Harry, it was found
that the fire had already reached him
and" that the little one's face and feet
and hands were blistered and burned.
He was snatched from the burning
building Just in time;: and it Is thought
that he will survive.: ' .:
After rescuing his baby; the father
looked around for his" wife, whom he
had missed from his side for some time,
unable to locate her he called to these
whom he had saved for the purpose of
ascertaining if she had joined them.
She had not, and the husband became
almost distracted with fear and panic.
It seems, however, that while the fa
ther, was rescuing the youngest and
most helpless child, she was making an
attempt to save the life of Mary, and"
in doing so gave up her own life.
