WHEELING, DECEMBER 4, 188U.
WKuruwt peace with the Begum of
Boojoo and chu rest of them, uud we are
thaukful^
National aid to education, says the
President; ami those who don't like it*
04ii tuke the lens of it.
Tub Presideut fuigot to say that West
Virginia is booming. Is it too late to
Utiud hack to the printer for correctiop?
Hbsi'kctbd AuarcUi&ts, read what the
President says and resolve to behave
yourselves or get out and blow up with
s Jiue other country,
It was unkind of Governor Wilson to
dub Judge Jackson "Twe," These
things stick to men, and are not handy
to have hi the House.
It Is solid Civil Service reform, not
the begun article, that wius the Presi
dent'* praise. Uoad what he says, pro
fessional reformers, and go to.
IIkvision of the tariif, (eduction of tht
surplus, all without reducing the meas
ure of protection given to uny iudiibtry,
This is the pure milk of the word.
Tub new Congressman firmly settled
in his seat uud clinched on the othei
Bide, can't understand how the other fel
low feela cooling his heels iu the ante
chamber.
Tub President is solid ou the pensiot
question. No deserving veteran in tin
almshouse, is a good'cry. Tho count!]
is not bo coldly meau that it will closi
its ears und its heart to that appeal.
Tub Message cuutuins 15,020 words
almirably handled by the Westeri
Union Telegraph Company. It requirei
sane approach to perfection to do tlm
along with the ordinary business of thi
day.
If you want to kuow what tho Presi
dont thinks, read his Message. Then
are no concealments, no mental reserva
lions, lie hits straight out from tin
shoulder. That's the kiud of u mat
your Uucle Ben is.
lr ]'resident Harrison has his way, ou:
flag will ouce more wave over a uier
chant marine, to tho protlt of tho coun
try iu peace and for its protection in war
Other nations foster their shipping, ant
ours is not too old to learn.
CAsr your eye over Wheeling and see
whether the old town is not going ahead
There is no margin fpr wild adventure,
but there is the solidity to make salt
investments. Wheeling has bueu very
slow iu her day, but she always iiaf
bueu sure.
Wbut Virginia elected three Repub
lican Congressmen, and nut onu ol ilium
it ullowed lo takoJiiH scat. This is tie
viay tho Democratic boasca run tiling
in West Virginia. If it Lad been kuuwn
tiiat tiio Republicans would haveu sure
majority without Vest Virginia, tiio
mischief might uot have beeu concocted.
_ Tim tuiuurity report (roui tboGuber
* natorlul contest co&iuilltco will bo tcady
ut any time It may bo wantod, and prub
ably soouer. 'l'bo majority nood not
further delay because ol it. And when
will the majority report bo ready? Or
are there to be no many majority reports
tbat it will take anutbci year to bring
thorn la out of the cold ?
National supervision of National
?lections, Is tho doctrine of the Mesjagc.
6o.it ought to be. Tho National Gov
ernment is uot an alien. If tho people
of auy State mean no wrong they will
? not object to Uncle Sam being tlioro to J
jirotoct tho rights of all the pooplo. The
suppression of votes in Muuisalppi
touches us closely In Wost Virginia.
Tim AlraMiye,
Ho far as tho President's Message Is u
reluniu ol eveula it can contain nothing
now to tho country. So far us it relates
to the l'resldent'aoplnlons ol events, his
view of auy peudiug question, and Ills
recomuienilatlono to Congress, it stands
vastly lint of the public utterances of tho
day.
Though addressed to Congress, and
Intended for the enlightenment of
that body, it is nono tho liss the com
munication of tho head ol tho greatest
ol governments to the most remarkable
o( peoples. Much that It is tho duty of
tho President to present formally to
Congress has already boon given In tho
newspapers and need not be given
again In tho published message.
So jnuch as lias real lifo In It every
body oilft.ht to read, This tho Ixmu
oascwi picaenta to day, not a lino more
than should bo read by every one who
desires to know (i>o President's uiln 1 on
the most Importune questions of the
time. President Harrison dodges no
public question. No topje Is omitted
which he might reasonably be expected
to treat. Ho discusses .each question
caluily, without passion but with Intense
earuestness whurfe the question ilp|teals
to hlui as a man and a cltlsun. Tim
.Message might have been delivered from
the bench ol the Supreme Court, so
judicial Is Its tone. Its eloquent appeals
for lair play might have cowo from the
most dlgulllcd uf orators. ,
It is n communication that will lro- I
pteis tho mind and Isy hold ol the
heart. Tliu country csnnot fall to ap
preciate and commend the entire frank
ness with which tha I'ressldsnt lakes all
the people Into Ills coulldenco. Tho
Mwssiie will set tho country to thinking
rndro seriously on some questions which
demand Its most n-rloim thought.

I waa told to-day by a gentleman iu u
position to speak the truth, that the be
giuumgof the antagonism between Gov
eruor Hall and Mr. CleveiamL-so far as
the Governor waa concerned, had its
origin in u circumstance very uiuch like
thut which caused the antagonism be
tween Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Hewitt.
;\h my informant learned it, Governor
Hill waa iutereatfd to the extent of $5,
000 in cartaiu mining or other property
somewhere in the remote Went for whicn
lrgialatiou waa needed at the hands of
Cougrc*8. A bill was introduced and
missed for a perfectly legitimate object,
it ia paid, tt.o mdirect result of which
would have beeu an appreciation of Mr.
Hilt's intern*', so that he would have
Men worth $75,000 at Ifaat. After the
hill was panned, information of this effect
of it waa conveyed to Mr. Cleveland and
lis at once vetoed the bill. Governor
tiill heard of this circumstance and the
lioe waa at once drawn betweeu theui.
The action of Mr. Cleveland indicated,
however, thut he had already himself
drawn it. _

Tito contention of the ailvermen has
always beeu that both metals must be in

consists iu tbo collection of the specifies
used by noted specialists of Europe und
America, and bringing tlieiu within the
reach of all. For instance tho treatment
pursued by special physiciaus who treut
indigestion, stomach and'fiver troubles
only, was*obtained and prepared. The
treatment of other physicians, celebrated

have experienced tho ill* clients, und
thoroughly realize the absurdity of the
