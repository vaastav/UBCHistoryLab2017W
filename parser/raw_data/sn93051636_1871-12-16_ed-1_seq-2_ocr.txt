DALLAS, SATURDAY, DEC. 1G.
W13 UISE TO EXPLAIN.
We have to ask our patrons to bo as
lenient with us as possible for the fail
ure of our last week's issue. One of
those unavoidable accidents which will
sometimes happen in a printing office
occurred to us, and the result was our
weekly visit was deferred. Wo hope
and trust that such a thing will not
happen to as again, but that all will go
well. The new year is - close upon us,
and we have made arrangements to
supply our friends with magazines and
other publications cheap. For clubbing
rates we refer to notices in another
column. Any publication wanted by
the public can bo obtained by leaving
the money with us, and we will insure
the forthcoming of the desired publica
tion. Wishing to extend the circula
tion of our own piper, and at the same
time accommodate the public, we oiler
these inducements. Having our paper
on a firm basis, wo propose to devote
our energies to its editorial columns,
and whatever of talent we may possess
shall be applied to that purpose. We
ask the continuance of patronage of our
citizens, and may tho time soon come
when the Republican shall be a wel
come visitor to every household 1u the
land.
PITY 'TIS 'TIS TRUR.
Another bright star has fallen from
the constellation of our unfortunate
Democratic friends. Much has been
said about the certainty of Ju.lc
Trumbull, of Illinois, becoming a enn
didate for the Presidency in 1S72
against Gen. Grant. Rut Trumbull
now conies forth and declines the
honor. The New. York Sun ami other
papers of that ilk have also advocated
the claims of Horace Greeley, and ex
pected to see Greeley come out in the
Tribune and abuse Grant, and severely
criticise his message. To thftir great
discomBturc, however, the message re
ceives a favorable comment from the
Tribune, and Mr. Greeley states his
intention to support the nominee, and
go on.
One by one their star aro fiKIug,
One by one their hopes decay.
And the adoption of the passive policy
is their only course. This is resdly a
safe and proper course. The people
will always be true to themselves ; and
when satisfied that any party organiza
tion is corrupt and unworthy of sup
port, they will always suppress it. The
Democracy have tried for years to re
sume control of national affairs, but
have signally failed. Now let them
rest until the party in power shall be
guilty of some act calculated to bring
the censure of the people, and entitle
it to defeat, then, under the name of
Democracy, or some other nomencla
ture, rise from its temporary obscurity,
and, based upon truth and justice, rid
to position and power. Rut now it is
hopeless; and the only plausible thing
to do is to bide their time, be it long or
short.
Dismissal from West Point.
Secretary Relknap has taken a step in
the right direction by dismissing cadet
Drewer for .interfering with another
cadet in the discharge of his duties.
The practice of these students of " dev
iling," -as they term it a new re
cruit, has been practiced in our Uni
versities time immemorial until it has
become almost unbearable; and many
young students have been compelled to
resign their situation, rather than sub
mit to indignities heaped upon them by
the older classes. The example set by
the Secretary will, we hope, be follow
ed by our Academies and Universities,
until a quietus be put to this nefarious
practice. It is time that this relic of
barbarism was eliminated from our edu
cational system altogether, as a disgrace
to the age, and an insult to common
sense. All efforts should be made to
render the acquisition of knowledge
hard enough at best ns pleasant as
possible,, and all petty annoyances
should be removed from the path of
the beginner-
The Farmer says that the proposi
tion to sell one half of Reed's Opera
House to Marion County for a Court
House for $35,000 is a Ross-Tweed
job. The present owners gave only
33,000 for the entire building a lew
months ago.
THli PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
We have not space to devote to this
document entire. After tho usual pre
liminaries the President refers to the
friendly relations existing between the
United States and other powers of the
world. Ho then recommends the ap
pointment of a forco for tho establish
ment of the boundary line between the
United States and British America ;
refers to tho withdrawal of protection to
German citizens in Franco, and the
policy which tho Government is main
taining toward European, South Amer
ican and Asiatic Governments. In
regard to the Catacazy affair he says :
" It was impossible, with selt respect,
or with n just, regard for the dignity of
the country, to permit Mr. Catacazy to
continue to hold interviews with this
Government. After his abwo of the
Government, the inexcusable course of
tho Russian Minister at Washington
rendered it necessary to ask his recall,
:?nd to decline to longer receive that
functionary as a diplomatic representa
tive. That there is no desire on the
part of this Government to diminish
the cordiality of these relations, the
hospitable reception which has been
given to the Grand Duke is a proof,
ami that on our side wo share the
wishes of the reasonable assuranco of a
permanent peace, and that the intimate,
friendly relations which have so long
existed between tho united btates and
Bussia may continue undisturbed, the
visit of the third son of the Kmpcror
is a proof."
Tho action taken by the Government
in stopping barbarities committed by
the Corcans is thus stated :
" Impelled by a desire to put an end
to the barbarous treatment of our ship
wrecked sailors on the Corcan coast, I
instructed our Minister at Pekin to en
dcavor to conclude a convention with
Corea for securing the safety and hu
mane treatment of such mariners. Ad
miral Rodgcrs was instructed to accom
pany him with a sufficient force to pro
tect him in case of need. A small sur
veying party sent out, on reaching tho
coast, was treacherously attacked at a
disadvantage. Ample opportunity was
given for explanation and apology for
the insult , neither came. A force was
then lauded. After a march of an hour
in a rugged and difficult country, the
forts from which the outrages had been
committed were gallantry assaulted and
were destroyed. Having thus punished
the criminals, and having vindi -a ted
the honor of the flag, the expedition
returned, finding it inij raniicable, under
the circumstances, to conclude the de
sired convention. I respectfully refer
to the correspondence relating thereto,
herewith submitted, and leave the sub
ject for such action as Congress may
sec fit to take."
Owing to the fact that our Ministers
in China and Japan have to depend on
interpreters who imperfectly under
stand our language, the President re
ef mi mends that at least four youths be
added to the official family there to
learn those languages and to act as in
terpreters ; also that measures be taken-
fur the susfentation of American ship,
ping. With reference to Cuban affairs,
it is stated that measures havo been
taken to fully protect the rights of
American citizens, and hopes are ex
pressed that the difficulties between the
United States and h'pain growing out
of Cuban affairs may be amicably set
tled. Upon the question of finance,
the President says :
" The national debt has been re
duced to the extent of 80,057,120
during the year, and by the negotiations
of national bonds at a low rate of inter
est, the interest of tho national debt
has been so far diminished that now
the sum to be raised for interest ac
count is nearly SI .7,000,000 less than it
was on the 1st of March. 1800. It was
highly desirable that this rapid dimi
nution should take, place both to
strengthen the" credit of the country,
and to convince its citizens of their
entire ability to meet every dollar of
liability without bankrupting them.
But in view of the accomplishment of
these desirable ends, of the rapid de
velopment of the resources of the coun
try, its increasing ability to meet large
demands, and the amount already paid,
it is not desirable that tho present re
sources of the country should continue
to be taxed in order to continue this
rapid payment."
The recommendations concerning the
tariff and Internal Revenues, are cer
tainly fair and logical, viz.: that tho
tariff should be lowered as much as
possible and protect home industries,
Io regard to articles that enter into
general use, and that cannot be pro
duced at home, should be placed upon
the free list, and such other deductions
made as can be without bringing our
own labor into cempetitioo with the
pauper labor of Europe.
Concerning public lands, it is recom
mended that they be reserved ior actual
settlers.
The matter of Civil Servico reform
having been submitted before, and re
ferred to a committee, does not now
receive marked attention.
Taken altogether, it is a fair state
ment of the status of Governmental
affairs without any attempt at literary
flourish, yet couched in such language
as to be plain, and easily comprehend
ed, making such recommendations as
the exigences of the caso seem to de
mand. Just such adecument will meet
the approval of the people, as it is
clear, sound and reliable.
IN MEMO It I AM,
At a regular meeting of La Creole
Lodge; No- 23, I. O. G. T., on the 2d
inst., tho following resolutions were

submission to the will of our Heavenlj
Father, and though we mourn, we
mourn not as those who have no hope,
but in confidence that our loss is her
eternal gain.
Resolved, That we deeply sympathize
with the bereaved family in this, their
great aflliction, aud we most pray that
the God of ail grace and consolation
will comfort and sustain them while
they live J and fiually reunite them in
that temple not made with hands, eter
nal in the Heavens.
Resolved, That this report be made
n permanent record on onr minutes, aud
that we will wear the usual badge for
thirty days, as a memorial of regard,
and that a copy of these Resolutions be
furnished tho Good Templar, P. C.
Advocate, and the : Oregon Republi
can, and that our Secretary be in
structed to furnish the bereaved family
a copy with the seal of this Lodge at
tached. ASA SHREVE,
