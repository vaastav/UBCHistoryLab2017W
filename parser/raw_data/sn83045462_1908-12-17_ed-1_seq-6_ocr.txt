The President's Special Message. 1
On the ltith of November last, in anticipation
of the President s annual message
to Congress in which it was reported District
affairs would be dealt with at length,
The Star said:
"Washington hopes that the President
will in the message make no recommendation
whatever in pursuance of those prop- 1
ositions of the Reynolds report which :
wander from sociology into politics and <
suggest local government by a single
commissioner, to be appointed by the r
President at his pleasure, without the
present statutory restriction of appoint- :
ment to three-year residents of the Dis- j
trlct. ,
"With the welfare of the city in view
the President will not make this recommendation:
(1) Because it is a slap in
the face to local public sentiment. Instead <
of desiring less representation in their
government, Washingtonians want more.
Many go so far as to demand not only
that the Commissioners or governor shall
be Washingtonians, but that they or he j
shall be elected by Washingtonians. The ,
proposition to deprive them of the last
vestige of guaranteed representation in
* * * 1 ? 1
tneir local gOVt'riiIIItSlll. aiiu auiiamuio
an imported carpet-bagger governor for
the local Commissioner? would be bitterly
resented by Washingtonians, If pushed by
the President for enactment. (21 Because
it proposes \he destruction and rebuilding :
of the structure of District government ,
and the exposure of the community to all
the dangers incident to this process,
merely for the purpose of making minor
changes in it of theoretical and dubious '
utility.
"The President should not employ his j
great influence to break dqwn in any respect
the government which exists unless
he will lead in a campaign to ob- 1
tain the most vital of American citizenship
rights for the people of the District;
not a sham local legislature, impotent .
except for the framing of petitions to j
Congress, and a voteless and futile ter- 1
ritorial delegate, but full representation
like that of other Americans in both i
houses of Congress and the electoral col- ,
l"ge. (3) Because it is untimely. The
same legislation which destroys the com- 1
missionership government must jubsti- 1
tute something in its place. The question ]
of the exact character of this substitute
will be a fruitful cause of bitter and irreconcilable
wrangling among citizens
and in Congress. The advocates of bu- 1
reaucratic despotism of the Reynolds ]
school and the champions of unlimited
popular suffrage will be at one another's
throats. Advocates of suffrage with a
property or educational qualification; advocates
of unlimited popular suffrage; ad- :
vocates of elections for national repre- ,
sentation. but not for municipal government,
and opponents of elections in any
form and for any purpose will engage in 1
S Donnybrook fair shindy. Progress in
practical local legislation will be impos- j
Bible. If the I?resident opens up the subject
of a change in the local government
at the approaching short session which
ends the Sixtieth Congress, the only effect
of this will be to waste the few
hours which the committees and the
houses will give to proposed District legislation,
and to block the way to enactment
of propositions for the city's bet
terment, like the President's own sociological
reform measures, for example, and
like the proposition for cheaper and better
gas."
The President has done what The Star
hoped he would not do, namely, submitted
to Congress In one message recommendations
for a change from a three-headed to
a one-headed government for the District
and for the institution of reform measures
for the amelioration of physical and
moral conditions in this community. The
institution of these reforms does not depend
upon the form of the District government.
It is now in the power of Congress
to enact, and of the Commissioners
to execute, the measures necessary for
the cure of the conditions which the
President mentions in his message, conditions
which undeniably tend to lower
the moral and social tone.
It is unfortunate that the recommendations
for these measures of betterment
should have been coupled with the proposition
to change the form of District gov.
ernment, which, as The Star said a month
ago, inevitably opens the idoor to a discussion
as to ways and means, the end of
which no man can foresee. On this question
the people of Washington are not of
one mind, and should the measure proposed
by the President be laid before the
two houses and pressed seriously as the
most vitally Important item of legislation
no other business could possibly be enacted
for the benefit of the District ot
Columbia.
Far better would it be to separate en- i
tirely the propositions for sociological
reform, which can be considered on their
merits, from that for a change of government,
the necessity and the wisdom of
which are seriously doubted by a large
proportion ot' the community. But submitted
together as they are in this message,
it is still within the power and
right of Congress to separate them and
consider them distinctly and lndepend
?nny, wun me sociological questions
given first place in discussion and legislative
action.
Debs must be given credit {or some accurate
statements. For instance, he predicted
his own defeat.
Parliament will take no notice of Carrie
Nation unless Bhe is so careless as to let
herself be mistaken for a suffragette.
Taft on the Tariff.
In his tariff speech in New York last
night Judge Taft said three things or
great interest at this time.
(1) He pronounced in favor of protection.
That was not new or necessary.
Had he not been a protectionist he could
not have been nominated for President.
In no speech he had made before that
time in favor of a revision of the tarift
had he failed to declare for protection as
a principle. But it was well for him to
emphasize the point last night, inasmuch
as he was treating of the subject In the
light of the November victory and the ob.
ligations it had Imposed. His audience
received his declaration with great ap- 1
plause.
(- In interpreting the tariff piank or >
nit' V.UH J uuj^f i all rjn/nr |
of the difference of cost in articles produced
abroad and in this country, andj
showed that the party wag pledged to
consider the matter in preparing the new
bill lie then said:
* ) state my sincere conlidence that
there is now being made In Washington
and will continue to lie made a sincere
effort to And the difference of cost and to
bx the tariff accordingly."
This expression of confidence by Judge
Taft in the work of the ways and means
committee should silence the talk that lias
beon going round t > the effect that he
na-arda the committee as maneuvering In
the Interests of the standpatters. "We see
that he entertains no such opinion, but
the contrary.
<3) But it is in this sentence that the
most is conveyed:
"Better to have no revision at all unless
we are going to honestly and favorably
revise the tariff on the basis promised
by our party."
We need not accept this as in the nature
of a threat. It is not to be read as
in effect saying: "There is reason to
fear that Congress is meditating a trick,
and I here and now give notice that if
a trick is attempted it will be defeated
by a veto. No 'perfidy and dishonor' business
for me. I'll stop any bill which
[iocs not square with the party's promises
and the power secured by t}iem."
The sentiment is so sound all may and
should echo it. Judge Taft, we may
safely assume, will decide upon the merits
of the bill after it has been laid before
him, and will have the sand to do his
iuty as he sees it. He is not the kind of
man to thunder in the index.
In ail the speculation about the coming
tariff revision there is express or implied
reference to the democratic fiasco of 1SU4.
But there is nothing to warrant it. The
democrats failed because of a fundamental
disagreement. Mr. Cleveland, as
far as he had puzzled his way into the
subject, was a free trader. Mr. Gorman
was an out-and-out protectionist. There
was no bond between them. There is no
such difficulty in the republican camp.
Standpatters and revisionists alike are
for protection. The question is one of
rates: one of how much protection this
article or that should carry at this time
of day.
It is evident from his speech that Judge
faft expects Congress to prepare the right
sort of bill. And at this stage of the
;ame it is far better for him to give his
ronfldence to Congress than it would be
for him to complicate the situation and
hearten the enemy by an expression of
iistrust.
The District's School Buildings.
"While the report of the commission
appointed by the District Commissioners
to investigate the physical conditions of
the local public school system is calculated
to allay any serious apprehension
regarding the safety of children, it nevertheless
discloses facts that call for remedy.
The investigators report the buildings
to be in the main fairly up to the
average of safety and convenience, but
Washington is not content to be merely
equal to that average. It wants to be
equal to the best.
As far as deficiencies are discovered
In the existing conditions they are in
the main due chiefly to the lack of adequate
means, and for this the responsibility
rests squarely with Congress. The
report should, and doubtless will, be laid
in full before Congress to acquaint that
body with the consequences of inadequate
appropriations, and meanwhile it is to
be hoped that it will effect a more harmonious
co-operation between the school
Dfflclals and the District government authorities
in the planning, construction, repair
and maintenance of the school buildings.
It is evident that there have been mistakes
in the past in the designing of
pubiic school buildings in this District,
but the responsibility for them is not a
matter for present consideration. They
may be attributed to the fact that the
science of schoolhouse designing has been
during the past twenty-five years in a
state of evolution, and that the model
school building has been developed only
within a decade or perhaps less. In the
past the doctrine appears to have prevailed
that any kind of shelter was good enough
for a school. The latter-day concept of
the public responsibility is totally different.
Such disasters as that at Collinwood,
near Cleveland, have destroyed all
remnants of this thought, and the distinct
proposition today before every community
is that above all other public
structures the schoolhouse should be a
model of safety, both in its materials and
in its design. Washington will never be
content until its school equipment conforms
to this principle.
For many years the District has lagged
behind its needs in this respect, as in
others. Schoolhouses that should long
since have been abandoned for lack of
suitable accommodations and safeguards
have been retained in service because
they were vitally essential to the maintenance
of the school system. The true
solution of the problems presented today
here in Washington is to appropriate for
a schoolhouse equipment which will be
in all respects a model as regards the
health and the safety of the children.
This will mean the replacement of many
buildings with new ones. It will involve
the expenditure of several million dollars.
But there will be no local demur
at so heavy an investment in security.
Judge Taft Goes South.
Judge Taft is on his way south to spend
part of the winter. He will be in a
pleasant section among pleasant people.
It will not be a period of rest. A good
deal of most important business will be
under consideration. Between golf games
a cabinet will be constructed and policies"
thought out. But it will be a period of
work under favorable conditions. The
President-elect will be far from the
madding politicians, constant interruptions,
life will not be accessible to Tom, Dick
and Harry. When he wants to see a man
he will fnvite him. And that man will take
the first train and be happy to make the
journey. The arrangement is excellent,
both for Judge Taft's health and comfort,
and the public welfare. Work done
in that way should be well done.
President Roosevelt has not had the
temerity to go up to the Capitol and ask
every member of Congress who is not personally
afraid of the secret service to hold
up his right hand.

street game is shown by the losses of
memory for which it is responsible.

Excise Legislation.
The Washington department of the
American Anti-Saloon Leairue has acted
n-ieoli' In r/icnlrlr?(r t n fftVAT nmctipfll TTIPJISI
ures of regulating and limiting the liquor
traffic. It has indorsed the essential
features of the Commissioners' bill, which
increases the zones of absolute prohibition
and grants the right of local option
to various neighborhoods by placing it
within the power of a majority of the
residents to prevent the issuance of
licenses'. Thus the league has adopted the
principle of gaining prohibition by piecemeal
instead of striving for everything at
once and gaining nothing. This is doubtless
the course most surely calculated]
to produce resu'ts for reform, and with
the league working vigorously for the
enactment of the measure of which It
has Just now expressed its approval. It
should be possible to obtain its passage
before the adjournment in March.
It would be merely looking for trouble
to assume that Lord Northcliffe's enthusiastic
praise of Charles Dickens is intended
as a slap at our current magazine novelists.
There is not much chance of Tom Johnson
getting over that broke feeling till

Possibly Mr. Carnegie thinks that the
tariff might encourage some infant industry
that might want to play in the

SHOOTING STARS.
BY PHILANDER JOHNSON.
Different Points of View.
"Of course," said the economist, "there
are good corporations and bad ones."
"Of course," answered Mr. Dustln Stax.
"Now, what is your idea of a bad corporation?"
"One that pays less than a 20 per cent
dividend."
"Now, chillun," said Uncle Eben, "I ain'
sayin' nuflln' 'bout whether dar is any
Santa Claus or not. But if I was Santa
Claus I'd shore be tempted to give It out
dat I'd gone out o' business so as to
throw dem footpads an' wicked corporations
an' train robbers an' other undesirable
citizens off'n de scent."
The Quest of Knowledge.
"You want your son to pursue the pathway
of knowledge?"
"Yep," answered Farmer Corntosscl. "I
want him to know more than anybody
else; to be looked up to as a reg'lar repository
of wonderful information. As
soon as he goes through college I'm goin'
to get him a job with the secret service."
The Christmas Candles.
T'nlcss with carp von lieht them all.
Amid the children's merry' shout,
Old Santa Claus may have to call
The fireman in to help him out.
Not a Contributor.
"Lady," said Meandering Mike, "de glorious
Yuletide approaches."
"So I read in the paper." said the woman
at the kitchen door.
"It's de season of generous cheer, when
de smile of gratitude is de highest reward
of a charitable nature."
"So it is. And now, I come to think of
it, this bull pup of ours never had a
Christmas gift, and if you'll just stand
still and let him bite you once or twice
you've no idea of how happy and grateiul
it will make him. You won't wait?
Well, of all the stingy men!"
Desolation.
The wintry raindrops patter
Where the "crowds were wont to cheer,
And the birds convene and chatter
In the grandstand, bleak and drear;
The grass lies brown and tangled.
And the cricket's note is heard.
Where of old the umpire wrangled
With the man who slid to third.
Oh, the ruined ancient city,
In its mute and cold distress,
Moves the soul to no such pity
For its gloom and loneliness;
"Tis the old and mournful story
Of the greatness that must fall,
That we read, midst shattered glory.
Where they used to play base ball.
Indian Unrest.
From the New York Tribune.
Unrest in India is obviously becoming
more ominous. That Is confessed by the
government in its enactment of a "summary
justice" bill for dealing with sedition.
For weeks the news from that
empire has been almost daily marked
with reports of dacoity, or of assassination
attempted or effected. Dynamite plots
have been discovered, bomb-throwing has
been Indulged in. and Incitements to
wholesale massacre and insurrection have
been and are numerous in the press. There
have been hints at a general uprising in
April next. Whether they are fulfilled or
not, there can be little question that the
government is now facing the most serious
problem which it has had before it
since the great mutiny of half a century
ago.
Scholar or Athlete.
From the Chicago Tribune.
The athlete or the scholar? Which type
of man does the world want? That is
the query suggested by President Hadley
of Y'ale in an address to the Harvard
winners of scholastic honors. "Two generations
ago the intellectual idol of the
graduates and students at most of our
colleges was the leading debater. Now
it is no longer the debater but the athlete
who occupies the center of the stage."
The fact thus stated is apparent everywhere.
The scholar has small place In
college life. The one who thinks of the
debater's platform as a field of endeavor
is counted amiably eccentric by the average
student. As for earnest work with
books in the quiet of the room or In the
library, that is laughable. The "midnight
oil" idea has a different meaning
nowadays.
The Finish of Castro.
From the Baltimore American.
It does not seem possible that the overthrow
of the Castro government can be
much longer delayed. It Is, of course, difficult
to form any intelligent conclusion
concerning the state of popular sentiment
in a country like Venezuela. In fact,
there is no such regulative force there In
i a. ii i a 4Ui_ .
Ilie sense wiai 11 Ciiaia in mis i-uuuir/.
But when in the capital city, which has
a population of nearly 100.000, an unhindered
mob surges through the streets,
gathering statues and pictures of Castro,
piling them in the public square, and
makes a bonfire of them amid rejoicing,
there is only one interpretation to be
placed upon the doings, and that is that
the populace of Caracas is anxious for
a change, and that the military and police
authorities are either indifferent or vacillating.
Emperor William.
From tbe Now York Run.
There is something rapt, mystic, wonderful
in the quiet that enwraps the German
emperor. Silence is a noise unto
him and a torchlight parade an abomination.
He bids fair to become as conspicuous
by studied inconspicuousness as
he has been for years on parade. It is
noticeable, too, that his embowered repose
comes at a time when another celebrated
character is in fullest blast. Is
there de'iberate intention in this contrast.
or Is the imperial hermit merely enjoying
a fresh role?
Incinerating Invective.
From the Baltimore Sun.
It looks very much as If President
Roosevelt intends to make the remaining
months of his rule at Washington a
veritable saturnalia of incinerating invective.
Pure News.
From the New York Mail.
Ry all means, the pasteurized newspaper.
Breaks Into Print.
From the Philadelphia Ledger.
Poultney Rigelow seems to have a queer
idea that he has something to do with
this Panama business.
Shoppers.
From the Itichmond Times-Dlspateh.
Time slips by fast. Well known Richmond
citizens who never do their early
shopping until late are beginning to
throng our magnilicent shops.
