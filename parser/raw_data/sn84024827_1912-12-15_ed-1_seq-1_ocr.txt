History of Case.
The life history of J. Frank Hickey
and the circumstances connected with
Irs arrest and indictment present
many peculiar features. Hickey is a
man of m.ddle age. of good address
and from his apearance nobodv
would suspect him of being a man
of abnormal or criminal character.
He received a good education, became
a pharmacist and then an expeii
chemist and filled various responsi
ble jiositions to the satisfaction of
"'- employers. In his normal con.
ditiou a roan of culture, kind and
pleasant in his ways, he became a
fiend fllleH -.fth th Inat of mnrilr
when the poison of alcohol benumbed
his better self and released from its
latent state the sinister part of his
personal'ty.
Two Selfi Shown.
When under the control or
his evil ego Hickey became filled
with the Insane impulses to kill boya,
an impulse which he could not re
sist. According to his own confes
sion Hickey tried to commit murder
twelve times, but only twice did he
succeed. One of his victims was
little Joseph Josephs, for whose mur
der he is to be tried next week, the
other was Michael R. Kruck, a news
boy In New York city, whom he lured
to an unfrequented part of Central

In both cases It was believed tbat

body of Michael R. Kruck was found

armistice. , After his arrest in Buffalo he made
Mania Is Displayed
It was his mania for writing postal
cards to the police authorities of dif
ferent cUIes. confessing to crimes and
giving information as to where the
todies of the victims would be found,
which led to the capture of Hickey
Facsimiles of the cards were repro
duced in the newspapers and some
person: who recognlied the similar
ity of the writing with Hickey 's cfcl
rogiapby. Informed the police. An
investigation was made which flilis
closed that Hickey had been under ar
test for the murder of the Kruclc
boy. and after some further se3rclt
Hickey was found in an institution
for inebriates at Whiting. N..J, ar
rested and charged with the murder
of the Josephs boy.
Hickey did not resist arrest and
declared his willingness to be taken
to Buffalo without formal extradition.
On the way from New York city to
Buffalo Hickey made a full confession
of his crimes, including the murders
of Joseph Josephs and Michael fl.
Kruck. He said that when under the
inlluence of liquor he could not re
sist the desire to kill boys, while he
deeply regretted his crimes -when in
a normal condition. It is believed
that Hickey will probably be round
insane and be committed to the Dan
nemora asylum for tho remainder of
his life.
