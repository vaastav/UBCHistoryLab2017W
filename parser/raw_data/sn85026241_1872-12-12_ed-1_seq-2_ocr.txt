The electors of all the States carried
bythe Bepublieans at the November
election met on the 4th inst at their
respective State capitols and cast their
ballots for Grant and Wilson for Presi
dent and Vice President of the United
8tates, for fonx years from. March 4th,

Charles M. Grovesaor of Athens, to
convey the result of the vote of the
Ohio College to Washington. ' -
About two- months since the County
Commissioners made report to the
Court la accordance with law In which
they stated that there was dLscrepen
des on the various : Turnpike roads
amounting to over $12,000; a short
time afterwards these same Commis
sioners met and entered into a minute
examination of the Auditor's books for
the purpose of ascertaining whether
the report they had made to the Court
was actually correct. - After a session
of a week, and endless figuring, they
arrived at the sanie point they were
when they began. The indisputable
fact that Twelve Thoubakd Dollaks
of the people's money was not account
ed for, stared them in the face.
In the meantime the Court appoint
ed a committee to certify as to the cor
rectness of the Commissioners' Report,
consisting of the Prosecuting Attorney
and Messrs. Campbell and Patterson. .
It has now been four weeks since this
committee was appointed, and they
have scarcely - began the examination
they contemplate, . We do not under
stand that it is the intent oi the law,
that this committee shall spend months
trying to ascertain that the Commis
sioners' Re Dart is incorrect, but it is
their duty to certify to the facts as
found udou the records. ' .' ' :: K
As vet their have not attempted to
compare the Report with the books,
but are digging 4ato and arranging
bonds and coupons' redeemed, a busi
ness for them, not contemplated in the
law;: . : ': . r
The fact is at the present rate of pro
gress it will take this committee a year
and more to make this examination,
.when they should do it in five days. It
is reasonable to suppose that they will
be allowed five dollars per day each for
their services, a total, .of fifteen dollars
per day making: foub xckdred dol
lars per; month spent to ascertain
what? How the eenUemen who had
charge of the collection and disburse
meat of the public monies did not make
a true and correct return of the same
or, how to exculpate themntirely ? or
do they wish to subserve the peoples'
interest? If they do, they will confine
themselves to their legitimate duties,
and report to the Court at an early day,
thereby - economizing the peoples'
means. '
.If It is found that the Report is correct,
let the Prosecuting Attorney
the County bring to the bar of justice
the men who are responsible for robbing

A certain society known rs the Ohio
Republican Association of Washington
city, by aome hook , or ; crook made
known their desires to President Grant
last week, of baying a conference with
biro, in order to arrange a slate for his
foreign appointments, and especially
urging the claims of Mr. Bingham. , w
are assured that this little arrangement
was a volantary exhibition of "cheek"
on the part of the managers of that
powerful . brigade not anticipated
the Hon. B. The President snubbed
and we think very properly these wou l
be Presidential Diretslori with the as
surance that he needed no recommend
ations of Mr. Bingham and he might
bave added very appropriately "from
such a source." We are aware that
the Ohio Association claims to direct
political affairs iahe-insiguificant State
of Ohio, but we were not prepared
learn of their taking control of national
Bolltloa. The President, no doubt, felt
' -
very grateful to this Ohio Associatioovice
for electing him
to the office of PresI-
dent for"" the next four yean, and
be will show . his appreciation , w he
the time comes, by promoting each
them from Cabinet Advitert to clerks.
The Ohio State Executive and Central
Committees compared with the astute
managers of that organisation dwindle
into insignificance. Really, we would
advise that the State Convention
disnensed With hereafter as a useless
gathering, and that the State and local
committees oe musierea omits cumoer
rs, and that, the political interests
OM be i handed over to this immacu
late body for direction and preservation.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7, 1872.
Editor Cheoxicle: The second
session of the forty-third Congress as
sembled Monday, December 2nd, with
crowded galleries. Prior ' to the
full of the gavel - there was
an exhibition of good nature 'on the
floor, with many warm greetings,
the which showed.- a - mag
nanimous and forgiving spirit among
the members. In the house the first
thing, after the new members were
sworn in. a resolution of respect to the
memory or sit. ureeiey was onerea oy
Mr. Dawes, which passed unanimously.
Then followed a- bombshell in the
shape of a request by General Banks, to
be relieved ot ms chairmanship 01 tne
Committee on r oreign Affairs, a mod
erate request, though he "was not, and
could not be in lull political accord
with the Administration, and especial
ly, wth its foreign policy, the magnan
imous nd forgiving spirit which over
ruled the better judgment ot a few re
publicans, caused them to ally them
selves with the Democrats, and thus re
tain him at the head of a Committee,
when it is a position that requires the
most cordial and confidential relations
with the Administration. But the
sensation of the day, however,. -was
when Speaker Blaine, after .having
called Mr. Cox to the chair, took a posi
tion on the floor near his former seat.
and with greaL-dignity demanded a
sp9ci.;I committee of five, to searching
ly investigate the grave charges, and
exculpate the eminent name;, of the
Credit Alobilier slanders, witn equal
positiveness, he asked his accidency,
Mr. Cox to 8OD0int on that committee
a majority of his political opponents.
The resolution was passed witn put one
feeble No. Sir. Archer, Democrat.
Mr. Cox appointed Judge Poland, tf
Vermont: General Banks, of Massachu-
seiif, iu.r. oet-K, 01 i.euiucis.y; rfuugv
JNioiacK. 01 Indiana, ana Mr. jvicureary
of Iowa. In consequence of the re -or
ganization of its committees which un
like the House, committees are re-or
ganized every session the Senate has
been unabie to do any Dusiness. in
the reorganization all the Liberals have
been ignored by tne Kepuoucans, ana
fill only such places as are given to
them by the Democratic Senators. On
thefitst day of thesession Mr. Sumner
found time to introduce a resolution to
strike from the army register and the
regimental colors the names of the bat
tles of the rebellion. This is supposed
to be the first of a series of propositions
agreed upon by the Liberals to effect
that much taiKea-o: reconciliation.
But this insult to our brave old flag
and the record of sleeping millions.
meets with no favor from any quarter,
North, South, East and West, alike
objecttoit.
.Not in the last twenty years nave
any of our Chief Magistrates been able
to review the condition of the country,
without touching questions calculated
to arouse political animosities.1' The
condition of our national affairs, 'at
home, and abroad, is such that a frank
avowal of opinion would notarouse the
opposition. The plain and business
like manner in wmcn nresiaeni urant
has performed the duty imposed upon
him by the Constitution, of frankly
recommending such measures as he
considers necessary, meets the appro
bation of nearly everybody. it pre
sents a very gratifying and satisfactory
statement of onr foreign affairs. No
difference of any magnitude with anyj
foreign nation, while our domestic ar
fairs are equal! lv clear of causes for dis
quietude ef any kind. ;The general
tone or comment indicates mat tne
message has made a good impression.

terrible murder perpetrated on the 4th
inst. in a neat little two story irame,
located . in -the centre of. the village,
lived John Allinghain rind his wife
Elizabeth. Alliuham kept a small
store, but was about qtitting business
He lived with his wife and her brother,
at the house where the de-?d was com
jmitted. He was about fifty-five "years
'of age, and a quiet, peaceful man-
The first alarm A-t the j muruer. w.as
given by Mrs. AUtnguaro; who wai in
bed with - her ' husband ' at "the" time.
She left the bed and ran up stales to her
brother's room,- crying, that ohn was
murdered, and that the house ,was on
fire. . George, the' brother, came down
stairs and saw deceased 'lying-in- bed
with about nine iache .iti diameter tt
his head blown off. -.The pillow was
saturated with blood and the bolster on
fire. ,Mrs. Allingham entered the room
and pulled the bolster from the Ded;
This turned the body over slightly.
Mrs. Alliugham and her brother roused
the neighbors and made a survey of the
premises, but obtained no clue of. the
perpetrator. "
The instrument used was of the most
murderous description. A piece of gaa
uiDe. four and a half feet long ana an
inch and a quarter in diameter, was
fastened on a strip of .wood two and a
half inches wide, . and seven feet six
inches long. - The pipe must have con
tained at least half a pound of powder
and over 's pound of Mugs, chopped off
a pig 01 leaa. ine oeu iu ,wmun tne
deceased ' wils lying was" two feet from
the window JooXing out on the porch
The stick, with the pipe tied to it with
broom cornwaa laid iroro- the railing
ol the porch to the window-sill The
end of the pipe' battered tight, save'a
smaU hole for fuse. - The latter was'at
least thirty feet long, and burned prob
ably, twenty minutes, peipre. .reacmng
the charge, The contents of the pipe
passed through the window oiiua, nead
board of the bead, and then took away
one side of the deceased's head. A more
devilish or effective weapon of death
was never seen before. , .
Two' men. named,, Briceland and
ListerjTiave been arrested , as the per
petrators of the dreadful deed.
