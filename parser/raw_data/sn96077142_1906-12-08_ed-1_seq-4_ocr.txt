SATURDAY, DECEMUER 8. 190G.
President Roosevelts s message
la published in this issue of The
Sentinel. The message discusses
tbe inheritance tax issue at some
length, touching on the race trouble
in the south,' also discussing the
Cuban problem, Philippine tariff
relations between capitoi and labor,
railroad matters, morality of the
nation, coal lands and many other
matters of national importance.
Tbe statement that the aggregate
maximum penalties that may be
collected from tbe Waters-Pierce
Oil Company, on the indictments
returned against that company at
jSt. Louis last week by a federal
rand jury, foot up to over a million
and a half dollars, will be noted with
more general satisfaction, perhaps,
when it is further explained that
the Waters-Pierce Oil Company is
an important branch of the Stand
ard Oil Company. Tbe long fol
lowed lane of peculiar success seems
to have a turning at last in the case
of the Standard Oil organization.
If the work of the closing session
of tbe fifty-ninth congress, which
opened at noon Monday of this week
shall correspond in importance and
value to the work' accomplished at
the first session of this congress, it
will have made a record of which
that body as a whole and each rnem-;
tcr can well be proud. It is not
probable that very much in the way
of new legislation will be taken up
at this session, but that tbe spirit
and purpose which controlled the
legislation of the farmer session
shall be continued is of far more im
portance than as to the mere items
of congressional accomplishment.
Governer Warner has chosen
much the better part in re
fusing to permit himself to be made
a candidate for United States sena
tor. His record as governor thus
far has made him deservedly popu
lar in all sections of the state and
it is not strange that any honor the
people of Michigan could possibly
.give hira should be suggested. But
tbe full completion of the term to
"which governor Warner was recent-
iy elected,' by a gain of fifty percent
over bis vote of two years ago, will
leave faim yet a very young man and
with the added acquaintance and an
increased popularity which will
make any future honor be may seek
of probable easy attainment.
The probability that one of tbe
matters to receive unusual consid
eration at the present session of
congress will be a bill prohibiting
child labor, so far as such an enact
meat can be made enectire by na
tional legislation, will be pleasing
to the great majority of the, people
in all sections of our country. It is
a blot upon tbe reputation of our
untry and a seeming denial of the
progress and prosperity we boast,
that thousands of children are not
only denied tbe necessary priveleges
of childhood but are being helplessly
sacrificed to tbe oeed and greed
parent and to the heartless
avarice of employers. No -state In
tbe union should be permitted to
vor or give its protection to tbe
n ploy men t of young children if
national legislation on that subject
can prevent it.

How to Smother a Chimney Fire.
Tbe quickest, 6urest, neatest,
easiest and most effective way to
stop a chimney fire, says an ex
change, is to take a large wet cloth
and wind it around the stove pipe
just above the stove. The moisture
from the wet cloth forms a cloud of
steam inside the pipe which raises
and smothers the fire in the chimney
almost at once. This method has
proven effective in tbe case of a
chimney fire so fierce that the stove
pipe all the way from tbe stove to
the chimney was red hot, and has
never been known to fail. The chief
beauty of the plan is its simplicity
and the ease with which it can be
used by anyone. Simply saturate a
large cloth with water, wind it
around tbe stove pipe at any point
where it is hot the hotter the bet
ter and the bteam generated inside
the pipe will do tbe rest.

Motor 'Butot Not Popular.
Motor 'buses have been tried In Syd
ney, Australia, as a solution of that
city's traction problem, but they lasted
only a very short time and now have
been withdrawn from the streets be
cause of a lack of patonage. The pub
lic preferred tbe horse-drawn buses,
which, If less speedy, are more com
fortable and less odoriferous. The
Sydney motor-'bus service was a gov
ernment enterprise, and by some crit
ics the failure 1b attributed to tactless
state management.
