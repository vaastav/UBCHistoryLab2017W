ELKTOX, DECEMBER T, 1813.
DEATH OF HORACE GREELEY.
On Friday evening, 28th of November,
Horace Greeley, the great model American
journalist, wearied with incessant brain
labor of forty years, chilled by the frost of
disappointment, crushed by the most stun
ning stroke of domestic sorrow, died! his
large sympathetic heart broke beneath these
thickly descending blows.
His fame was all gathered in the field of
journalism. He was an original type, a
commanding genius in this great work of
modern civilization. His greatest weak
ness, which shows all the more conspicuous
ly in contrast with his real greatness as
the philosopher, the statesman, the preach
er through the press, was the desire to
shine in some official position, which should
be the gift of the popular will. The pub
lic with its great good sense, its omniscient
judgment knew the great teacher better
than he knew himself. That public which
freely acknowledged him a giant as a pre
ceptor, knew he was the merest pigmy as
an executor, and sternly denied him the
opportunity he so long and constantly crav
ed; a position where his acts would inevit
ably dim the lustre of his great reputation
as a teacher. The great brain and heart
of the journalist teemed with truths to
make the world wiser and better, which
struggled for utterance. For this special
mission Greeley was created. In this de
partment of labor he stood forth among
the heroes and great men of the world, but
withdrawn from this field of his usefulness,
and transferred to those untried pursuits
he so ardently coveted to lay his hand to,
. it is evident he would have proved the
smallest of men. A stern fate denied him
and the nation this great calamity; for the
elevation of Horace Greeley to the Presi
dential chair surrounded hy the men who
sought his election for personal aims, would
have proved the direst calamity that could
have befallen the American people. But
that deprivation served as a final blow to
crush his great sensitive heart and over
worked brain. He was restrained by fate
and the better judgment of the American
people, from wrecking the great fame earn
ed through a busy life, a life of unremitting
toil, but a toil that inspiration converter,
into a pleasure. These blemishes of a vain
ambition to act a part Providence had
never designed, are scales which dim the
otherwise resplendent lustre of a deathless
fame, but which will drop away as the age
moves on, and history takes up the story
of his life to bear it on through coming
time. ,
Success in the late Presidential election
would doubtless have stimulated and born
up his life fo* a few months longer, but
over-work had well nigh worn out the
wonderful machine. After the stimulus of
a satisfied ambition had subsided, and the
inevitable vexations and toil inseperable
from the life of an American President
had set in, the result which disapppoint
mentand domestic sorrow hastened by a few
months at most, must have been inevitable.
It is scarcely within the bounds of probabil
ity that Horace Greeley as President could
have survived one year; and the calamity
that might have followed his successful el
evation to the Presidency, cannot be con
templated without a sigh of relief amid the
deep sorrow, with which humanity mourns
the death of one of its greatest and most
fearless heroes.
Great characters who seem raised up by
Providence specially for some important
work, often by their death advance, or es
tablish the cause to which their lives have
been dedicated, more firmly than if their
lives had been prolongued. Horace Gree
ley dedicated his last years to the re-estab
lishment of a more cordial peace than ever
existed between the North and the South.
What student of our political history, can
doubt that his death, —falling a martyr to
the love of his race—will contribute infi
nitely more to the fulfillment of his life’s
desire than his successful elevation to the
Presidency ?
A world mourns his death, but a gener
ous Providence called him home when he
had accomplished all of that work it was
possible for him to do.
Horace Greeley was the originator of a
style in journalism superior to any that had
been in use prior to his time; and the style
that most nearly approaches his is the one
moat popular with newspaper readers of
the present day. In this alone he has be
queathed a great legacy to the English
speaking race, and no greater boon could
be conferred by his historian on the gen
eration of journalists who are take up the
pen's that will think and speak for the
world the remainder of the nineteenth cen
tury, than the collection and publication
in a volume, the best of his articles on the
leading subjects he discussed through the
Tribune in the last thirty years.
CONGRESS.
Both Houses of Congress organized on
Monday, and the President's Message was
received and read. The House passed a
resolution ordering a record to be made on
the journals of Congress of the apprecia
tion of the eminent services and personal
purity of the late Horace Greeley. On
motion of speaker Blaine, a committee of
inquiry was ordered in the Credit Mobilier
scandal. A bill was reported in the House
for the construction of ten ships of war
which gave rise to considerable discussion
and wag laid over.
A bill was introduced in the House on
Wednesday for the speedy consrtuction of a
ship canal round Niagara Falls and another
for the repeal of the stamp tax on bank
checks.
—The Tribune advised that the Electoral
votes which were to have been cast for
Greeley for President, should be given to
Grant, as a sign of the era of peace and
good will which the Liberal candidate had
sacrificed his life to. But our Maryland
Bourbons blackslid, as the Methodist say,
and emulated the washed sow, by select
ing one of the old Bourbon stock,
Hendricks, to cast their votes for. Stick a
pin here ye deluded “ Liberals."’ They
will sorely need a new installment of Lib
eral grace next fall and will have no Gree
ley to baptize them. Their loud profes
sions through the campaign were all hypoc
racy.
Old Santa Clause.—Those enterpris
ing merchants, Adams & Brother, of 50(1
Market street, Wilmington, advertise a
splendid assortment of imported and do
mestic toy goods this week, very appropri
ately surmounted by St. Nicholas with his
reindeer team. We know of no better
place to buy toys in the country, either at
wholesale or retail.
The funeral of Horace Greeley took
place on Wednesday in New Y'ork. The
services were held in the Church of the
Diviue Paternity, and the funeral address
were delivered by Rev. Dr. Chapin and
Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. Among the
mourners were the President and Vice-
President of the United States, the Vice-
President elect, the Postmaster General
and Secretary of War, the Chief Justice of
the United States, the Governor and Gov
ernor elect of New York, the Governor of
New Jersey, Senators Trumbull, Schurz,
Conkling and Fenton, Generals Sheridan
and Babcock, and a host of other military
and civic officers, besides distinguished
citizens, associations, clubs, etc. Nearly
all the stores along the route of the proces
sion were closed, emblems of mourning
were numerous, the bells were tolled and
the flags half-masted. The interment was
in Greenwood Cemetery. 1
I THE TARIFF.
I [ The Democrat deals more cautiously but
: , still unfairly with the Tariff. A Tariff is
i a tax and every species of taxation is a
■ ■ legitimate subject of complaint and fault
finding. It is simply the best and most
economical mode of raising revenue to de
, fray the necessary expenses of the Federal
. Government. All Tariffs are protective that
f are laid on the class of articles manufac
tured in the country; they are invariably
j so. But on the other hand all domestic
j manufacturers are protectors of the consu
mers against the importer, or foreign man
f ufacturer who, if the home competition did
t not interpose between them and the people
f who buy, the amount of duty paid at the
Custom House would be added to the for
eign market price, freight, etc. And while
. the custom duties serve as a shield to pre
vent the foreign capitalist and manufac
, turer from bearing our markets till they
1 break our manufacturers down, and break
down the wages of our operatives, our own
; manufacturers also prevent the price of
. foreign products from being put up to fig
, ures that would cover the duty laid upon
foreign articles. So that the Free Trade
, theory that the Democrat makes use of,
. namely: that the amount of duty paid on
goods at the Custom House is added to the
foreign article, and collected in full from
, the consumer, is false in fact.
The home competition which the Tariff
, aids to build up, making it impossible for
foreign and wealthy monopolists to crush
before it is permanently established, has
proved one of the greatest benefits and
blessings to this country.
The Democrat very truly remarks:
“What American manufacturers really
require is not high protection, but uni
form incidental protection of a revenue tar
iff with the assurance of stability.”
This is good Republican and Adminis
tration doctrine. It is not proposed to tax
foreign goods out of the market for that
would defeat the very object and purpose
of a tariff, and leave the Government with
out revenue.
What The Democrat considers its strong
point is, that the Tariff on railroad iron
will prevent, the builders of the proposed
Elkton and Massey’s railroad from stock
ing it with miserable refuse British rails
at S4O a ton. This is an old subject of the
Free Traders. These S4O English rails
are the shoddy of the iron market and so
worthless that no British company could
be induced to use them, and it has been
abundantly proven in this country that
rails made of American iron are cheaper at
S7O a ton than the British rails at S4O. No
rails are manufactured in the United States
as poor as these British shoddy rails that
are got up expressly to sell to hard strapp
ed companies in this country, and prove to
be scarcely worth the laying down.
The argument that building materials
were allowed to be entered free of duty
for the re-building of Chicago, and the
same policy is proposed for Boston is not
relevant to the point at issue; and the ap
plication that is attempted docs not meet
the question. But before proceeding to
combat this argument, let us state that
the Mayor of Chicago has stated that the
remission of duties on building materials
brought from abroad for the use of that
city proved of little or no advantage. So
much for facts. The deduction of import
duties from building materials for Chicago,
was intended as a donation to the sufferers
by the great lire from the people generally
of the United States. But “the people of
America are building houses continually;
why not permit them to build them as
cheaply before as after the great fire?”
queries The Democrat, which is an argu
ment for Free Trade pure and simple, as
opposed to the argument above quoted
from the same article favoring “ incidental
protection and a revenue Tariff.” The
fact is a very plain one and can't be got
round or over, that all Tariffs are protec
tive to some extent, and it is a mere play
of words to pretend to favor a “ Revenue
Tariff and incidental protection” and at
the same time broadly denounce the Tariff
because it prevents the foreigner from
gaining a monopoly of our market. The
Government must raise revenue, and tax
ing imports is the cheapest, the least bur
thensomc and the most equitable mode of
taxation ever devised, and no political
party while in power will ever attempt to
run the Government on Free Trade princi
ples. The Free Traders opposed the re
peal of the tax on coffee and tea, which
would have continued this tax on every
poor man in the country to the full amount
of the duty collected; for these products
not being raised in this country the tax
was added by the importer and paid to the
last farthing by the consumer, because
there was no home produce of these arti
cles to keep it down. A Tariff" has a two
fold action for good. It presents an effec
tual bar to the wealthy foreign monopolist
“bearing” the market, while it fosters the
several branches of manufacturing indus
try at home which constantly extend and
become more stable; and a healthy compe
tition and rivalry serves to equalize the
price of both foreign and domestic fabrics,
by which means labor is diversified and
distributed among many pursuits.
The farmer must look for a remedy to
his troubles, both real and imaginary,
to other sources than the Tariff laws.—
Their rise or fall will not sell a single bush
el of grain more or less in the markets of
Europe. lie has competitors in the Old
World in the grain market who will gov
ern the price there.
The have been more cultivated thought
and utalizing of machinery called to the
aid of the other great iudustris of this
country, than to agriculture. A correction
of this neglect will be found to present the
true solution to the great farming difficulty.
That “Cute” Picture.
The Western Postal Record, pub
lished at Chicago, the most reliable postal
paper in the Union, says;
“How is it that the proprietors of Ocr
Fireside Friend can oive away to every
subscriber a beautiful chroino of 10x20
inches, and which retails everywhere at
$lO, is more than we can tell. But they
do it. And it is certainly an elegant pic
ture. The subject is most pleasing, and it
will be a beautiful ornament in any house
hold. Oor Fireside Friend has attained
a very large circulation, and is (irmly es
tablished as one of the leading family
weeklies of the Union.
—The Democrat Electors of this State
cast their votes on Wednesday last, for
Hendricks and Gratz Brown. The Georgia
Electors were divided; ti votes were cast
for Greeley and 2 for Charles J. Jenkins.
Tennessee threw all her electoral votes for
Hendricks for President, and B. Gratz
Brown for Vice President. In Arkansas
the Governor declares that Grant carried
the State, and the Liberal Electors claim
the election, and accordingly met and cast
their votes for Gratz Brown for President,
and Gen. Banks for Vice President.
— ——
—As there has lieen a good deal said of
the danger to health by using the sewing
machine, it is worth while to mention that ;
Dr. Parker recently read a paper on the
subject before the State Medical Society of 1
Virginia, in which he maintained that fa- !
tigue is not disease; that there is no reason
to conclude that the use of the musclcsem
ployed in machine work for a reasonable
time is injurious; that a machine may be
used by a woman for four or five hours
daily, if she be in ordinary health, without
injury; that the damage to health in the
I factory is due to the hygienic conditions
j under which the work is done. In conclu
' sion, it was affirmed that the sewing-ma
chine is a great boon to womankind, in
creasing compensation, protecting vigor,
| and lessening family labors. i
THE MESSAGE.
t *
g After an acknowledgement of thankful
ness to the Giver of all good for peace at
j home, peace abroad and general prosperity
t | as a nation, the President mentions the ca
-1 lamity by fire at Boston, in connection with
j the energy displayed by the people of that
city in extricating themselves from their
misfortune. The settlement of our long
pending disputes with Great Britain is the
c next topic, briefly reviewing the decisions
at Geneva and Berlin, and highly compli
■ menting Charles Francis Adams and the
- agents and the counsel employed by the
] United States, and also Mr. Bancroft, our
Minister at Berlin, for his agency and ser
vices in the settlement of the San Juan dis-
B pute. The marked compliment paid to Mr.
- Adams is responsive to a communication
b from the British Government expressing its
appreciation of the ability displayed by Mr.
Adams, as Arbitrator on the part of the
United States. Referring to the decisions
f at Geneva and Berlin, the President says,
c that the results under the treaty of Wash
j inglon leave the two governments without a
shadow upon their friendly relations, which
* condition he expresses the sincers hope may
■ forever remain. The award at Berlin
i leaves the United Slates, for the first time
5 in its history as a nation, without a ques
tion of disputed boundary with Great Brit
' ain. Referring to the fact that the $15,-
i 500,000 awarded to the United States, at
: Geneva, is not payable for one year, the
! President recommends the creation of a
Board of Commissioners, who may, in the
meantime, examine individual claims under
I" the award, so that no time may be lost in
■ making the distribution. Legislation sim
i ilar to that of Great Britain and Canada on
the question of the “fisheries,” under the
’ Treaty of Washington, is recommended.—
1 The cordial relations existing with France.
Russia and Germany arc mentioned; and
also the negotiation of certain treaties with
the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Sweden
' and Norway, generally with respect to
naturalization. A recommendation is made
to invite the International Statistical Con
gress to hold its next meeting in the Unit
ed States, at the time of the Centennial
Celebration, in 187(1; and following this, is
■ a reference to the International Exposition,
to be held next year in Vienna, with a rec
. ommendation that an adequate sum be ap
propriated to aid in the effort to have the
products and inventions of Americans fair
ly represented in that Exposition; and a
I further suggestion that the Secretary of the
i Navy be authorized to fit up two naval
I vessels to transport American articles in
tended for exhibition at Vienna.
Regret is expressed in view of the many
> lawless acts which disturbed the quiet of
■ our Mexican border during the recent rev
. olutionary condition of Mexico, accompan
ied by an expression of the hope that with
’ more settled rule and order under the ex
isting Mexican Government, chosen with
i such unanimity, these disturbances and
depredation may cease. Nothing should
be left undone to strengthen the relations
between the two governments, as neighbors
' and friends. The President also regrets
; that he has again to announce a continu
ance of the disturbed condition of Cuba, no
advance having been made towards the
pacification of the discontented part of the
1 people. This contest has lasted now for
more than four years, and is at our door.
The President docs not doubt that the con
tinued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is
among the strongest inducements to the
i continuance of the strife, and he holds the
opinion that its abolition and the introduc
tion of other reforms in the government
of Cuba could not fail to advance the re
turn of peace and order. He hopes the
i present liberal Government of Spain may
take the same view. After further obser
vations in relation to the emancipation of
the slaves in that island, the President ex
-1 presses his regret in having to believe that
citizens of the United States, or those
i claiming to be such, are large holders of
slaves iu Cuba. This is in defiance of the
spirit of our own laws, and, in view of the
fact, he again recommends such legislation
by Congress as may be proper to discour
age, if not to prevent, American citizens
• from holding or dealing iu slaves in that
island or elsewhere.
The armistic concluded under the aus
pices of the United States, between Spain
and the allied South American Republics
on the Pacific, is mentioned with the hope
that it may be followed by a permanent
1 peace. With these States, and with the
other republics of Southern and Central
America, and with Brazil, our Government
maintains most friendly relations.
Venezuela, however, has made no furth
er payments on the awards in our favor
under the convention of 184(1. The atten
tion of our Congress is invited to the mat
ter. The President renews the recommen
dation that a sum be appropriated for the
education and support of at least four
American youths iu each of the empires of
China and Japan, so that when educated,
our ministers and consuls there may have
interpeters and translators belonging to
our own country; ha also suggests that pro
visions be made to enable our consuls in
' foreign countries to relieve cases of distress
occurring to our seamen and other citizens.
Then follows a summation of the receipts
and expenditures of the United States, andi
the condition of the public debt, from which
it appears that the total reduction of the
debt since Ist of March, 18(19, to the Ist of
November. 1872, was $3(53,69(1,099.87. On
the subject of taxation, the President says
it is very doubtful whether any further
reduction can be made in addition to that
provided for by recent acta of Congress.—
As a measure of justice to the holders of
the national debt certificates, he recom
mends that no more legislation to reduce
the taxes be had, unless to correct errors
, in the present laws, until time shall prove
(hat further reduction ought to be made.—
The preservation of our national credit is
of the highest importance, and next in
importance is the duty to provide a note
currency, which at as early a period as is
practicable will bo converted into gold at
par.
Following this important subject is the
usual reference to the reports of the De
partments. There is a necessity for a full
■ medical corps for the army, there being
now fifty nine vacancies in that corps.—
River and harbor improvements are en
i dorsed as returning more than their cost to
the country in the losses thereby prevent
ed. The attention of Congress is invited
to the desirability of better facilities for
■ the transportation of the surplus products
f of the West to the Atlantic seaboard, and
I in this connection certain interior water
routes arc mentioned, such as the Chesa
peake and Ohio canal, although no recom
mendation for National aid is made at
present. The Message suggests a Commis
. sion to examine the whole subject. A Com
mission is also recommended to inquire in
’ to the best method for acquiring for the
1 Government the title to all telegraph lines
i in operation, so as to connect them with
the postal service. Liberal contracts to
certain mail steamship lines are recom
mended, with a view to benefitting trade
and commerce. Lawless acts have become
less frequent in the Southern States, and
. at the close of a conciliatory passage under
this head, the President expresses his hope
that there may never be any further cause
; for the execution of the Enforcement Acts.
The present Indian policy of the Adminis
l tration, which continues to work well, will
be maintained without material change.
Referring to Territorial affairs, the Presi
dent recommends the passage of a law for
Utah, to secure peaca and equality among
all its citizens before the law, and the ulti
mate extinguishment of polygamy. A ex
pression of the President’s determination
to enforce the reform regulations in the
“ Civil Service ” closes the comprehensive
exhibit of our national affairs embraced in
the message.

Death of Horace Greeley.
From the Germantown Telegraph.
. On Friday evening last, the 29tb inst.,
near seven o’clock, Horace Greeley, late
Y candidate of the high and responsible of
- lice of President of the United States, died
j of an attack of acute mania at a private in
. sane asylum near the city of New-York, to
which he had been conveyed by his busi
r ness-partners. The story of the close of
- the career of this distinguished journalist
B is one of the saddest on record. It seems
that for two years prior to his death he had
been a sufferer from insomnia or wakeful
” ness, and was unable to get more than an
" hour’s sleep at a time. This resulted from
“ excessive and long-continued mental exer
tion. Mr. Greeley, although generally a
patient and laborious man, was liable to
become nervous, excitable and unnaturally
j absorbed in a given subject. Upon such a
temperament the tremendous canvass
through which ho had just passed was a
' terrible ordeal. Through most of it he
really believed that he was going to be
’ elected, and that he had a great mission to
' fulfill for the good of his country. But the
' warfare of the campaign told upon him
l fearfully, as the severe overhauling of every
part of his record by journals formerly
' friendly to him irritated, annoyed, and
, humiliated him. But the final crash of de
feat produced such a depth of depression
as no one could have foreseen, and it un
hinged his reason and finally caused his
death. He had been insane since the 20th
' of November, but the fact was suppressed.
The N. Y. Times intimates that his mind
was not altogether sound even before the
. Presidential election.

OFFICE OF CHAS. A. WALKER, J
Attorney and Counselor at Law, v
Carlinyille, 111., Sept. 10, 1871. J
Messrs. Parker Brothers, West Meriden, Conn:
Gentlemen: —To say that 1 am pleased
with the gun, but poorly expresses ray sat
isfaction. It is the handsomest gun that I
have ever handled. From boyhood I have
taken great delight in field sports, have
used all kinds of guns, and can truly say
that seldom docs any one bag more game
than I, when out for an evening, day, or
week’s hunt. When I received the guu, I
had on trial one of Scott’s best, a splendid
looking and fine shooting gun and had
made up my mind to keep it, but on open
ing the case in which the gun you sent me
was, I was staggered. I put it together,
after a close inspection of the workman
ship, put it up to my face and found that
it fitted so perfectly that I turned to a
friend and said: “What shall I do? I
had set my heart on the Scott, but here is
a gun that excels it in every way.” I then
■ went out to shoot them, taking as a target,
a bound volume of a newspaper, with
thick paste-board back. Shot Scott first,
with No. 7 shot; put in 118 pellets, with
penetration of 14 sheets, besides back of
volume, I then turned the other side of
the volume, and, from same place to same
place, with same load-the cartridges being
loaded out of same powder and shot, the
guns being each No. 10, 30 inch barrels,
and weighing 8 pounds and 2 ounces, shot
the Parker; put in 123 pellets, with pene
tration of 36 sheets, besides back of vol
ume. Then, loaded with No. 4 shot, Scott
put in 78 pellets, penetration of 28 sheets,
besides back of volume; Parker, 110, with
penetration of 58 sheet, besides back of
volume. I had used Scott in the field, and
to simply say that it shot well would be do
ing the guu injustice. It shot elegantly.
Before I fairly made up my mind to sur
render the Scott, I took the Parker in the
field (the only true place to test a gum,
and here is where your gun excels all
others. It kills cleaner and handsomer
than any gun that I have ever shot. I
have been out with it a number of times,
and the more I use it the more do I be
come convinced that there is no gun in the !
world that will out shoot it. I have sent
the Scott home and will surely keep the
Parker until I am convinced, by actual
trial, that somebody is manufacturing a
better gun than the one you sent me. Am
obliged to you for the exactness with which
you filled ray order. Yours Iruly,
C. A. Walker.
With such testimony as this together
with the fact that the Parker guu is in the
hands of such men as Bogardus, Tinker,
Newell, Taylay, Witmer etc., etc. —the
best shots in the country, we think no
sportsman who desires the best weapon
will fail to secure a Parker guu.— Xiagara

HOW TO GO WEST.
This is an enquiry which every one
should have truthfully answered before he
starts on his journey, and a little care tak
en in examination of Routes will in many
cases save much trouble, time and money.
The “ C., B. & Q. R. R.,” running from
Chicago, through Galesburg to Burlington,
and the “1., B. & W. Route,” running
from Indianapolis, through Bloomington
to Burlington, have achieved a splendid
reputation in the last two years as the
leading Passenger Routes to the West. At
Burlington they connect with the B, & M.
R. R. and from the great Burlington
Route, which runs direct through South
ern lowa to Nebraska and Kansas, with
close connections to California and the
Territories; and passengers starting from
Cecil County, on their way westward, can
not do better than to take the Burlington
Route.
This Line has published a pamphlet call
ed “How to go West,” which contains
much valuable information; a large conect
map of the Great West, which can be
obtained free of charge by addressing the
General Passenger Agent B. A' M. R. R.

A boy with microscopic eyes is the
latest scientific wonder in England. He
possesses the faculty of seeing minute ob
jects magnified to a marvelous degree. His
eyes were diseased when he was young,
and he came near losing his sight, which,
however, he gradually recovered. It was
found, however, that the internal struc
ture of the eye had been changed, the
cornea being greatly enlarged, the crysta
line lens being divided into three different
parts, each part surrounded with a light
blue circle; and in the center of each
appears the iris, diminished to the size of
a pin’s head. The patient cannot distin
guish objects at a distance, they appearing
blurred and misshapen. The magnifying
power of his vision is stated at 5,000 diam
eters. A curious fact is that he will never
examine water, having once discovered the
! vast number of infusoria contained in some
which ho was drinking, and the sight of
which thoroughly frightened him. The
lad, it should be mentioned, has a wonder
ful talent for drawing and coloring with
great accuracy the objects which come be
neath his inspection. The case is under
the particular attention of Sir Charles
Madden, F. R. S., and of Ur. Crowder, the
eminent oculist.
