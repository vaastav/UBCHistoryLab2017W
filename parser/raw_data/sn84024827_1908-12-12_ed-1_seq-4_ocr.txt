THE PROCLIVITIES
OF GENIUS.
When air. HooseTelt Issued notice
that tho people need not concern
themselves about his future, that he
was perfectly able to tako card of
himself, ho doubtless thought, as ho
doubtless thinks, it Is perfectly prop
er that go distinguished a' scientist as
himself -should have the expenses of
his African junket paid out of the
iunda of tho Smithsonian Institution,
says the St Louis Republican.
'Mr. Roosevelt, the universality- ot
whoso genius is cheerfully acknowl
edged, has never appeared before the
people as a scientist, except negative
ly as a critic In the field of nature
"writing. The report of his engagement
by the Smithsonian Institution, ot
which be will be ex-offlcio tho presld-,
ing officer until Marca 4 next, has the
smell of that class or deals loved of
Standard Oil and Peraker; that is to
ay, a superficial stirring will send the
umes heavenward. To understand
ho situation properly, however, it is
necessary to consider Mr. Roosevelt
and his ways.' TVhen this Is done, his
integrity remains untarnished and his
honesty unimpugned.
Mr. Roosevelt can do no wrong. Mr.
J Roosevelt always tells the truth.
'These things", are plain. .First, he can
do no wrong because be never has
uoue wrong. He hi3 said so himself.
Second, in case of a question of ve-
. racily or accuracy between him and
another, or between him and ail oth
ers, the result is always foreseeable.
He wins. With a .majestic sweep ot
his ren ho can overturn courts ana
'their decisions, evidence and its fal
sities, men and their weary laaccur
acies and fallacies, and sweep all into
' that heap of pulsating carrion known
as the Ananias club.
.It would be immoral, if not illegal.
for any other to accept from the
Smithsonian Institution an engage
ment of tho kind. But it is not lor
Ir. 'Roosevelt. His ways are not our
rays." Sis rules arc not our rules,
aid for what anothet is condemned
ne Is crowned. Of his peculiar actions'
and his -moral tone there can be no
appreciative criticism, no valued estl
j mate-and no worthy rotice, unless the
critical commentator first makes obei
sance to the 'unconventional and un
trammeled proclivities ot true genius.
Tho Phoenix Gazette Is still Indus
triously .hunting excuses for the re
publican party to offer the people' of
Arizona for the republican majority
ln-iongrese" during the. last ten years
rirfaslng to admit Arizona as a state.
"Now the Gazette has found & Hew
caasc; this paper las discovered that
the statehood bill Introduced by Mark
Seslth only provides a salary of $5000
for the Arizona federal judge, who will
,of coarse bo a republican. The Gs

and that Marie Smith ought to t
ashamed of himself for attempting' to
provide a Bmaller salary for tho Ari-

trict: ""Now that conditions for general
resumption ot activity in the Copper
mining wprld aro tradually becom.
Ing mortfanjd.moro favorable, and will
probably bo as inviting as ever dur
ing tho coming year, copper Invest
ment seekers aro beginning to turn
their attention to promising mining
districts of the southwest.
"To all such seeUors, and especially
to capitalists and influential mining
men of Douglas, Bisbee, and the Mich
igan copper country, we say: Inves
tigate the merits of the Paradiso dls-
tricL Tako no mans word for an
opinion of the district but como and
see for yourself. There are those who
exaggerate and those who disparage
for reasons of their own. "We do not
ask you to take our word for It,
though tho Record has, wo believe,
the reputation of being conservative
and truthful In describing the district
and Its properties. The editor
(though not a mining man, has with
out doubt visited moro mining prop
erties in this district than any other
one man, these visits covering a per
iod ot three years; and his opinion
of the district might therefore bo en
titled to some consideration. Wo think
highly of the district, but we do not
ask you to accept our opinion. Corns
and seo for yourself, at any rate, have
the courtesy to do so before you ex
press an opinion. '
"And 'when yoa come; remember
that tho district is a "very large one.
Generally speaking. It Is probably
best to divide the district Into two
entirely different parts-tho foothill
belt and the mountain belt, and we
want to say right here and now that
no one who has cot seen both belts
has 'seen the Paradise district.'
"From personal observation and In
formation, wo are convinced that'thla
district has the rigut copper Indica
tions and croppings, that ore In quan
tity has been demoastrated In severe
al different places at a vertical depth
ot S00 feet or less, and that this min
eralized belt covers an unusually
large area.
"Come and see If these statements
are not true. Learn what companies
are represented and annually do as
sessment work here at great expense,
and why. Investigate thoroughly and
honestly and we do not fear your
verdict."

so that there may be no question re

boards of education- to provide for
tlic segregation of the white and col

this territory. There seems to be
some doubt now as to whether such
authority Is given to scnool trustees.
If there -is such doubt it should bo
removed.
Tho negro population in Arizona is
not largo it is true, but In some com
munities it is large cause for undesir

The local school toard of Douglas
has taken the step of seggregating
the white and colored children and in
doing so we believe the act has been
sanctioned by a -very heavy majority
of the people ot the- city, both wbRe
and colored. There was objections
raised and doubt as to the propriety.

this sentiment' was cenerat.
We want to see overx child In Ari

How Alexander Untied
the Knot.
By Herbert Kaufman.
. Alexander the Great was being shown the Gordian
Knot. "It can't be untied," they told him; "every
man who tried to do it fell down."
But Alexander was not discouraged because 'the
rest had flunked. lie simply realized that he would
have to go at it in a different way. And instead of
"wasting, time with his fingers he drew his sword and
slashed it apart. ,
. Every day a great business.general is.shown some
knot which has proven too much for his competitors,
and he succeeds because he finds a way to cut it. The
fumbler has no show so long as there is a brother mer
chant who doesn't waste time trying to accomplish
the impossible who takes lessons from the failures
about him and avoids the methods which were their
downfall.
The knottiest problems in trade are:
The problem of location.
2 The problem of getting the crowds.
3 The problem of keeping the crowds.
4 The problem of minimizing fixed expenses.
S The problem of creating a valuable good will.
None of these knots is going to be untied by fum
bling fingers. They are too complicated. They're all
involved together twisted and entangled over and
about each other so intertwined that they can't be
solved singly like the Gordian Knot they must be cut
through at one stroke. And you can't cut the knot
with any sword except the newspaper because:
1 A store that is constantly before the people
makes its own neighborhood.
2 Crowds can be brought from anywhere by
daily advertising.
3 Customers can always be held by induce
ments. 4 Fixed expenses can only be reduced by in
creasing the volume of sales.
S Good will can only be created through pub
licity. Advertising is breeding new giants every year and
making them more powerful every hour. Publicity is
the sustaining food of a powerful store and the only
strengthening nourishment for a weak one. The re
tailer who delays his entry into advertising must pay
the penalty of his procrastination by facing more giant
competitors as every month of opportunity slips by.
Personal abilityas a.closffpurchaser'a'hd as-a clever
seller doesn't count for a hang so long as -other men are
equally well posted and wear the sword of publicity to
boot. They are able to tie your business into constantly
closer knots, while you cannot retaliate because there is
no knot which their advertising cannot cut for them.
Yesterday you lost a customer today they look
one tomorrow they'll get another. You cannot cope
with their competition because you haven't the weapon
with which to oppose it. You can't untiePyour Gordian
Knot because it can't be untied you've got to cut it.
You must become an advertiser or you must pay
the penalty of incompetence.
You not only require the newspaper to fight for a
more Iwpcful tomorrow, but to keep today's situation
from becoming hopeless.

THE ISSUES OF
THE SHORT SESSION.
Tfow that there has been nothing
of special interest in the message of
President RoosevelL other than the
reiteration of former recommendations
made by him. It mar be expected that
the two most prominent Issues dur
ing tho remaining days of tho sixtieth
congress will be th? consideraUon of
.the necessity for tho Improvement of
water transportation and tho expendi
tures, revenues and taxation by tho
federal government
The advocates of Internal waterway
Improvement must fight hard and in
telllgcnUy if they overcome Use stub
born opposition that will bo offered
to anything more than river work by
driblets.
Though thero have been many inti
mations that tho report of the engin
eers, duo about tho 1st of February,
will bo highly favorable to the Lakes-

session the word Is that this year's
appropriations are likely to exceed
those of last year.
This means, of course, new taxes,
or great bond issues for current ex
penses of the government It Is this
program , which tho democrats of the
senate - have announced their intention
to fight under the leadership of Sen
ator Culberson of Texas. The demo
cratic senators will resist with all
their might the Imposition ot new
taxes and insist upon economy as the
only proper remedy for the straits in-
to which tho treasury Is falling. For
ono thing, they will contend for
changes in the tariff to make it more
productive of revenue.
Tho republican papers which are
booming KIbbey for United States sen
ator, had better take a political snap
shot at tho complexion of tho present
legislature In Arizona.
