ME. GAGE'S PLAN.
The revision of the currency promised
in the St. Louis platform has been giv
en a start. The plan of the adminis
tration has been embodied in a bill by
Secretary Gage and is now before con
gress and before the people.
The title of the bill says that it is
Intended to provide for the refunding
of the national debt, for the establish
ment of a redemption fund and a di
vision of issue and redemption in the
treasury of the I'nited States and to
modify existing laws respecting na
tional banks and for other purposes.
The "other purposes" were explained
by the secretary to the committee on
banking and currency. He said: "The
objects I have in mind in the series of
provisions offered by me are four In
number:
"First To commit the country more
thoroughly to the gold standard: re
move so far as possible doubts and
fears on that point and thus strengthen
the credit of the United States both at
h'ime and abroad.
"Second To strengthen the treasury
in relation to its demand liabilities in
which are included sreenbacks. treas
uiy notes, the incidental obligation to
r? aintain .on a parity, through inter-f-'ia::geability
with gold, so far as may
be necessary, the present large volume
of silver certificates and silver dollars.
"Third To do this in such a way as
rt'it to contract the volume of circula
tion in the hands of the people.
"Fourth To take an initial- step to
ward a system of bank notes issues
without the conditional deposit of pub
lic bonds as security therefor."
This statement may be fairly taken
as an embodiment of the views of the
president. It is plain and easily under
stood. First of all in importance in the new
currency plan is to "commit the coun
try more thoroughly to the gold stand
ard." This may reasonably be con
strued to mean, fixing the gold stand
ard so firmly that there can never be
any escape from it. The first step in
this direction is the proposition for
redeeming the silver currency and the
silver certificates in gold. The desire
is expressed that this shall be done in
some way. not very clearly set forth,
which shall not result in any contrac
tion of the volume of circulation.
It is proposed by the secretary that
the whole business of issuing money
and control of the volume of currency
be turned over to the banks, and they
are offered certain inducements to
maintain an issue adequate to the
needs of the people. These conditions
the secretary seems to have no doubt
they will accept.
AVhile the bill provides for the re
tirement of the greenbacks, Mr. Gage
does not refer to that feature either in
the title of the measure or in his re
marks before the committee. - He has
kept that part of the matter in the
background as effectually as did the
president in his message. There can be
little doubt, however, that it will re
ceive an ample airing in the halls of
congress.
That section of the bill which pro
vides that outstanding coin bonds be
redeemed in bonds payable specifically
in gold, is likely to defeat the measure,
as it stands, unless the temper of con
gress has changed greatly since Mr.
Cleveland's incumbency.

The gold watch of E'lgar Allen Poe
is now in the possession of R. W. Al
bright of Fort Madison. Iowa, and its
history is characteristic of the check
ered career of the poet. He had been
in debt to Mr. Albright's brother, a
merchant tailor, and gave several notes
in settlement, together with the watch
in trust. "Edgar A. Poe" is engraved
on the gold cap inside.
"When a child of 5 years John Wana
Tnaker assisted in making- brinks, get
ting a few cents a day. His first step
toward fortune was in the days when,
(us office boy, he saved money enough to
start in business for himself. He
worked as assistant in the office until
he had climbed up to $9 per week, and
then, seeing that he could get no more,
he bought a little stock of cheap furni
ture and started to be a merchant.
The supreme court of the German em
pire in Leipzig has just spoken the last
word in the lawsuit over the inheri
tance of Emin Pasha's property. The
claims of the widow of the Turkish
general, Hakki Pasha (who had mar
ried in the meantime), to have been the
wife of Emin, and who, therefore,
claimed a portion of his property, are
declared to be unfounded. Therefore,
Frida Schmitzer, the explorer's daugh
ter, has come into possession of all that
he left. As another consequence of
this decision, the papers and letters of
Emin Pasha, announced some time ago
for publication, will soon appear.

We fail to see why a man should be

You hear men speak of certain things

PENNY CAPITALISTS.
New York Children of tho Poor En
couraged to Save by Provi
dant Funds.
New York, Dec. IT. The Penny Provi
dent system inaugurated in this city
about nine years ago has grown to enorm
ous proportions, and good results are ap
parent, especially on the poverty-stricken
East side.
A casual visitor to the neighborhood
Guild, on Delancey street, one evening last
week found the room crowded with eager
children, each carrying a small book, and
all impatiently waiting for the striking of
a gong that was to be the signal for
them to form in line and make their de
posits. It happened to be the banking
hour. Each little depositor expected to
increase his or her bank account by a
sum that might range from 5 cents up to
possibly 2j or 50 cents. Each was a cap
italist on a very small scale, to be sure,
but still a capitalist and a bank depositor,
with a real bank book to show for it. All
the component concerns are known as
stamp stations and are nearly 350 in num
ber. There are now nearly 65,000 depositors,
of whom more than two-thirds are bright
eyed and thoughtful boys and girls, many
of them the offspring of poor immigrants.
The Penny Provident folk do not conduct
a banking business, but merely a school
to teach the young the benefit to be de
rived from harmless self-denial.
According to its last report the Penny
Provident fund htis $3l,3U5.44 in net de
posits. In IMA) the deposits aggregated
less than $6,000.
PLACE FOR GORMAN.
To be President of a Business Corpor
ation Formed by Croker.
Lakewood. N. J., Dec. 17. Richard Cro
ker returned from Washington today and
the nature of his conference with Senator
Gorman is known. Mr. Croker has de
termined to launch a giant business cor
poration of the fidelity-surety sort, with
headquarters in New Y'ork. It will begin
operations about January 1. and there will
be a pipe line of perfect sympathy be
tween this new company and Tammany
Hall. Senator Gorman is cast for the
presidency of this company and will, it is
believed, accept the role, which will carry
with it a position of prominence in Tam
many politics. Gorman will, in the event
of his acceptance, move to New York at
the close of his term in the senate. In
1900 he will be the New Y'ork candidate
for the presidency.
It is understood that former Ambassa
dor Eustis.who is mentioned for the chair
manship of the Tammany general com
mittee, will be general solicitor of the
surety company. Others interested are
Senators Murphy and Quay. Hugh J.
Grant, William C. Whitney. Perry Bel
mont, the Wiedner-Elkins-Y'erkes traction
syndicate of Philadelphia, Emerson Mc
Millan of the Iaclede Gas company of St.
Louis. Brent Good. Theodore W. Price and
a host of others. The capital of the new
company will be enormous, but the ex
act figure has not been agreed upon. It
is said that a salary of $25,000 a year waa
offered to Senator Gorman.
HOMELESS CHILDREN.

Chicago, Dec. 17. The National Chil
dren's Home society held its tenth annual

George B. Harrison has received re
plies from all of the members of the
Kansas delegation in congress with the
exception of Senator Baker, as to their
plans tor the session. The replies are
i as ioilows:
I "My plans for the future are in brief
! as follows: I shall use every effort to
obtain full payment trom the Kansas
j Pacific and Central Paciific railroaas-or
j e.se to secure the purchase of the roads by
; the government. 1 shall oppose all cur
rency legislation seeking to retire the
I greenbacks, to enlarge bank power or
to strengthen the gold standard. I shall
oppose the proposed annexation of Ha
waii and the pooling and anti-ticket
brokerage pills. 1 am in favor of bel
ligerent rights for Cuba, the postal sav
ings bank bill, the Lodge immigration
bill and the Nelson bankruptcy bill; I
shall work to obtain the Fort Hays res
ervation for the state; tor the state un
iversity's claim for the burning of the
Free State hotel, and to secure the pass
age of a number of private bills.
"W. A. HAKKIS."
"I shall oppose all efforts to contract
the currency by the retirement of the
greenbacks or by their conversion into
gold certificates, as well as the efforts
of banks to secure the entire control of
our monetary system and all other i
gold standard schemes; I shall contend
for bimetallism, for a postal savings
bank system, for just prison legislation,
for Cuban independence, for tne over- ;
throw of trusts and combines to tne
end that American producers and la- '
borers may be independent and for the
restoration of this government to the
people. 1 shall affiliate with all like
minded men and tight only the common
enemy. J. D. BOTK1N."
"I hope to help in formulating and
passing during this session of congress
a good bankruptcy law, lair to all sec-
: tions of the country. I also wish to as
. sist in devising and putting into opera
i tion a postal savings bank system. I
shall endeavor to have Kansas divided
into two federal court districts. 1 shall
I urge that provision be made for the
! sale of the surplus lands belonging to
I Pottawatomie and Kickapoo Indian
reservation in Kansas. I will aid in se
curing appropriations for puolic build
ings, and for other legitimate purposes
in our state.
"CASE BRODEKICIv."
"My individual plans in part are: To
reduce postage one-half on point print
letters written by the blind; to secure
a building for Kansas City, Kan., by
appropriation or donation of the old
government building in Kansas City,
Mo. ; to obtain for the state university
a claim for $20,000, and to give special
i attention to the claims of individuals in
: my district. In a general way I shall
oppose the annexation of Hawaii, the
constraction of the currency, civil ser
vice as administered and I shall work
' for postal savings banks, restriction of
i immigration and forCuban bellirerency.
j "MASON S. PE'liiiRS."
' "I shall oppose the bankers' scheme
' as recommended by President McKin
ley, to retire the greenbacks. I will
work for bimetallism and the expansion
of government legal tender, paper
money with which to retire all bonds
and bank money forever: for public
ownership and control of the means of
production and distribution, so that
every industrious citizen may get ready
employment, own and enjoy a free home
with plenty. I shall support the Initia
tive and referendum, the establishmeut of
a postal savings bank system without
interest: a service pension law, and will
work with my best endeavors for the un
ion of the people to vote this government
out of the control of the trusts and
monopolies. E. P. R1DGELY."
"I hope during this session to procure
I $100,000 to enlarge the government
! building at Topeka, $10,000 for the erec-
tion of a new Indian school building in
Brown county and the passage of some
meritorious private pension hills. I
shall assist in securing the passage of
a bankruptcy bill, some general pension
legislation, a bill for the relief of state ;
n,,i;t.,r ,wl o sj.,ttlc tho Indian
Territory questions.
"CHARLES CURTIS."
"With such a Republican majority in
the house. Populists can hope to ac
complish but little. We will try to pre
vent the opposition from doing harm. I
will help every good measure, regard
less of its author, and oppose all that
is bad. I shall do all in my power
against retiring the greenbacks and the
issuing of more bonded bank notes. I
am in favor of a bankruptcy bill, and
the recognition of Cuba. I intend to in
troduce a bill to relieve pension appli
cants from the necessity of proving
that they were abled-bouied meu when
they entered the service and from the
necessity of proving the condition of
their health ever since they were mus
tered out.
"W. D. VINCENT."
"It will lie difficult to adopt and carry
out any policy this congress, owing to
the great Republican majority in the
house. I am opposed to the retirement
of the greenbacks, and I am opposed to
the Sherman-Cullom anti-scalping bill.
I am in favor of financial legislation,
such as free coinage of silver at the
ratio of 16 to 1, legal tender for any
sum. 1 favor the government issue of
full legal tender paper money. I am in
favor of a just and equitable bank
ruptcy bill. I am in favor of postal
savings banks.
"N. b. Mccormick."
"I have no settled policy in this con
gress, except to fight the Kepulilicana
whenever I think them in the wrong.

FOLDING BED.
Nearly Causes th? Daath of Dr S. O
Gant at Cowgill, Mo.
Kansas City, Dec. 17. Dr. S. G. Gant,
Manager of the University Medical col
lege football team, had a narrow escape
from a serious injury and per.iaps death
while visiting his old home in Cow'gill.
Mo., Sunday. The cause of the acci
dent was a massive, old-fashioned fold
ing bed.
The doctor had been in the bed but a
few moments when the heavy top
lurched forward drawing" the occupant
toward the wall.
The doctor's sister heard the heavy
scraping sound and ran to the room to
assist her brother. She arrived in time
to save his life, but not to prevent him
from being severely bruised. The top
of the bed caught him by the neck and
nearly strangled him. Members of the
family hastened to the room and pried
the t ed apart. Dr. Gant is being at
tended by Dr. Jabez Jackson.
TO HAVE THE TROLLEY.
Rich Cottagers of Newport Unable to
Stem the Demand for Public
Transportation Facilities,
Newport, R. I., Dec. 17. The cottagers
of Newport object to street railroads, but
the residents, despite the fact that the
summer residents support the place, have
thus far ignored their wishes.
It is now proposed to run a trolley line
from Fall River to Newport. Three towns
in Rhode Island connecting Newport with
Fall River viz., Tiverton. Portsmouth and
Middletown held the key to the situ
ation, and their officials were appealed to
by Newport's millionaire summer resi
dents to prevent Newport from being in
vaded by excursionists.
Their appeals, however, were unheeded,
and today the town of Portsmouth, where
Cornelius Vanderbilt owns one of the
finest farms in this section of the country,
granted a franchise to the road. The
principal objectors were Mr. Vanderbilt
and his friend, Henry A. C. Taylor, a
New York millionaire.
By a singular coincidence the announce
ment was made after the vote of the town
council of Portsmouth today that Mr.
Vanderbilt had given $500 and Mr. Taylor
$150 toward the building fund for a par
sonage for the Christian church of that
town.
GREEN ATCHISON" MAN.
Falls a Victim to Iwo Faise St. Louis
Detectives.
St. Louis, Dec. 17. Fred Salgabel, a res
ident of Atchisbn, Kan., was the victim
of robbers late Tuesday night. Salgabel
arrived here Tuesday evening on his way
to New Y'ork, and stopped off to see the
sights.
Before he had gone a block from Union
station he was met by two well dressed
strangers, who placed him under arrest,
representing themselves as police officers,
and claiming that they had evidence that
he was a counterfeiter. They led him
through the streets, and when the two
reached Seventeenth and Olis-e streets the
supposed detectives accused Salgabel of
having counterfeit money in his posses
sion. They took him into a wineroom
and searched him. They took a roll of
money aggregating $110. and said they
would have to test it to prove whether it
was spurious or not. They told Salgabel
to wait at Union station and they would
meet him there after they had completed
their investigation. Salgabel did as di
rected, but when the two strangers failed
to appear Wednesday morning, he noti
fied a police officer.
ALABAMA IRON FOR JAPAN".
Extensive Shipments Are Now Being
Made by Way of Pensacola.
Birmingham. Ala., Dec. 17. The Ten
nessee Coal, Iron and Railroad company
and the Sloss Iron and Steel company to
day shipped 5.000 tons of Alabama pig iron
to Pensacola, from where it will be for
warded to Kobo and Yokohama, Japan.
A trial shipment of Alabama iron made
to Japan several months ago gave such
satisfaction that extensive orders are re
sulting, today's shipment being the first
of a series. . -
Japan neretofore was supplied by Eu
ropean furnaces, but labaroa has under
bid these. :'
WITH A SLOW FUSE,
Caused Dynamite to Explode Under
Hirn After Hanging Himself.
South Bend, Ind., Dec. 17. John Kelly,
who was but lately released from the Lo
gansport insane asylum, committed sui
cide today by hanging. To make success
doubly sure, Kelly hanged himself from
a rafter in the barn and exploded a stick
of dynamite by means of a slow fuse. His
arms and legs were blown off.
Kelly lived near Woodland, 16 miles from
here. He was 42 years old, and leaves a
wife and large family, and was once quite
prosperous.
BUSINESS REASON'S ONLY.
Frorupt the Union Pacific to Make a
Reduction in Bate3.
E. E. Dickinson, general manager of the
Union Pacific, in a letter received by the
state board of railroad commissioners, in
timates that he cares little for the rulings
and orders of the board, but does say that
competition is a feature of business which
must be recognized.
Mr. Dickinson takes this position with
reference to the reduction of rates from
the Missouri river west, in accordance
with the order of the former board of
commissioners.
"In view of the severe competition whic h
we are compelled to meet, the Union Pa
cific will make the reduction, but for no
other reason," says Mr. Dickinson.

WAR WITH JAPAN.
Gen. Lew Wallace Sees Trouble
Ahead Between the U. S. and
That Nation.
Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 17. "I firmly
believe." said Gen. Lew Wallace, "that
the next war we shall engage in will
be with Japan. There is a country with
a fine naval equipment and a good
army, flushed with recent victories and
a country spoiling for fight. They need
a good th thrashing, and we are abie
to give it. They have been landing
troops on the Hawaiian islands for a
long time under the guise of emigrants
and there is now a Japanese army of
40,000 on the islands.
"Dole discovered the scheme, and has
tried to put a stop to the secret land
ing of this army, but the Japanese are
already landed there."
"Do you mean to say. general, that
Japan will declare war if we annex
Hawaii?"
"We won't annex it. I am in favor of
the annexation of the islands, but you
will see that this administration will
not annex them. What we should do
right away is to take these islands
when they are being offered to us for
nothing. In 15 years we shall be en
gaged in a war to get them if we do
not annex them now. Y'ou will live
to see that war. I may not, but you
mark my words, when I say that you
will see it. Those islands which we
can now get for nothing, will cost us
untold money, for there is nothing so
expensive as war.
"Speaking about our engaging in
war," continued (Sen. Wallace. "I nn-
: ticed in the papers the other day that
i Congressman Hillborn of California
had, before some class in Chicago the
day before, lectured upon our military
equipment, and, although he is a mem
ber of the house committee on naval
affairs, he made the statement that
while we had some vessels, we did not
have in this country enough powder to
fire the ordinary salute. He made this
statement to express the absurdity in
his opinion of this country engaging in
war.
"That fellow should be disciplined
for that kind of talk. He ought to know
that this country has concealed some
place in the Allegheny mountains
enough saltpetre to make all the pow
der we would need in a long war. That
statement was highly injudicious, and
I believe not true. Even though true,
however, It but advertises our weak-
f ness to the world and invites trouble,
j Congress should appoint a committee
i to have that utterance invest'' gated, and
i if proved to be accurately reported, he
should be censured, yes, even expelled
from the house. He is not fit to repre
sent anyone."
OFF IN A CLOUD OF S3I0KE.
German Crui3er With Princs Henry
Aboard, Saiis for China.
Kiel, Dec. 17. The German cruisers
Geficn and Deutschland sailed for Chi
nese waters yesterday. The harbor
presented a most animated picture.The
shores were thronged with people and
a number of naval officers occupied the
Barbarossa bridge. Prince Henry en
tered his launch and was cheered as
the boat left the shore.
Emperor William, in an admiral's
uniform, appeared alone at the castle
gate, saluted the officers and boarded
: the launch. He received an ovation.
' The Deutschland, which was anchored
i opposite the castle, hoisted the imper
ial standard as his majesty stepped on
board and then hoisted the war flag.
The Deutschland slowly got under way
with the emperor. Prince Henry and
the other princes on her bridge. As she
passed the other vessels, which were
drawn up in line, extending as far as
Bellevue, hurrahs were exchanged, the
crews manned yards and guns thunder
ed forth salutes until the Deutschland
disappeared in clouds of smoke and
powder from the gaze of the specta
tors. Princess Henry of Prussia and her
children witnessed the departure from
the castle windows.

Is being removed, and only the chimney
Is left standing. The gate is believed to
be more than 140 years old. It was es

wagon and one horse. 10 cents: a wagon
and two horses. 1 shilling, and for the
post coach, with its six fiery steeds,
guards and postillions. 2 shillings.
It is said that the only body of men
who ever dared to march through the

Cleveland bankers begun a long confer
ence today looking1 toward a reorganiza
tion of the Fort Wayne. Ind.. street rail
roads, in whit h they are interested

declared illegal the street railway fran
chises obtained in Columbus. O., by Mr.
Shipherd. and in which they are interest
ed through the sale or pledge by him to
them of stocks and bonds.
In fact, the bankers have on their hnn;1;
the entire complicated mass of Mr. Ship
herd's operations, involving the use by
him of about $2.000,0Xi of stocks and bonds
