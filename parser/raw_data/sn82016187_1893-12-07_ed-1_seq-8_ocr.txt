THE NATIONAL TEIBUNE:' "WASHINGTON, DL ft," THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1S93.
TTJE " IfESSAGE
President Cleveland's Views on Mat
ters of National Importance.
President Cleveland opened his annual Mes
tgo to Congress, which assembled duly on
Mondstv, Dec 4, by contmendiiip to that body a
careful examination of the detailed statements
and well-supported recommendations contained
in iho reports of tho lioads of Departments.
FOREIGN KELATIONS.
Tho President declares that while during
tho past year our foreign relations have not
always been frco from complexity, uo embar-ras-inp
situation at present remains that will
not yield to the spirit of fairness and love of
justirc. Ho declares that there is ample pro
tection for American interests in Brazil. He
fails to fco any reasonable grounds for recogni
tion. as belligerents, of tho insurgents.
The Convention between our Government
and Chile, having for its object the settlement
and adjiistnirnt of tho demands of tho two
countries against each oilier, has been made
cfl'cctivo by tho organization of tho Claims
Commission provided for.
Jt is believed that under tho recent amend
ment of tho Chinese act, extending tho time
for registration, tho Chinese laborers thereto
entitled, who desire to reside in this country,
will now avail themselves of tho rcuewed privi
lege thus nfliiidcd of establishing by lawful pro
cedure their light to remain, and that thereby
tho necessity of enforced deportation may be
to a great degree avoided.
Ntgdtiations are now in progress botween
Great Britain and the United States with a
view to Mich concurrent action as will make
theawaid and reflations agreed upon by tho
Benin: Sea Tribunal of Arbitration practically
effective; ind it is not doubted that Great
Britain will co-operate freely with this country
for tho accomplishment of that purpose.
The dispute growing out of the discriminat
ing tolls imposed in the Welland Canal upon
cargoes of cereals bound to and from tho lake
ports of the United States was adjusted by tho
substitution of a more equitable schedule of
charges.
NICARAGUA AND THE CANAI
Nicaragua has recently passed through two
revolutions, the party at first successful having
in turn been displaced by ano' her. Our newl
appointed Minister, by his timely good olliees,
aided in a peaceful adjustment of the contro
versy iuvolved in the first conflict. Tho large
American interests established in that couutry
in connection with tho Nicaragua Canal were
not molested. The canal company lias, unfor
tunaloly. become financially seriously embar
rassed, but a generous ticatmeut has been ex
tended to it by the Government of Nicaragua.
Information received of maltreatment suf
fered by an inoffensive Amcrcan woman eu
gaged in missionary work in Turkish Koorlis
tan was followed bj-6Uch representations to the
Porte as resulted in the issuance of orders for
the punishment of her assailants, the removal
of a delinquent official, and the adoption of
measures for the protection of our citizens en
gaged in mission and other lawful work.
THE HAWAIIAN MUDDLE.
Of the Hawaiian dillicully the President
ays:
It is hardly necessary for me to state that the
quc-tions arising from our relations with Hawaii
have caiieil "t-rioiis embarrassment. Jtiit prior to
the installation of the promt Administration the
exiMiii" Government oflluwnii hud been suddenly
ot rthrnu ti, mid a tn-ntv of annexation had been J
negotiated between the l'lovisionnl Government of
tlt'i Iblands mid the UuiledSlHle-, nnd submitted to
the Senate for ratificitirti. This tienty I withdre w
for examination, and di-pateiied Hon. James II.
Biount, of Gtorg-n. to Honolulu as n Special Com
missioner to mke an impartial investigation of
the circumMnures attending the change of Gov
eminent, and of alt tlio conditions bearing upon
the subject of the tfHiy. After it thorough and
exhaustive cxnmiiiiilioli Sir. Hlhuut submitted to
nie his report, -h-wiilg beyond nil question that
the Constitutional Government of Hawaii bud been
subverted with the nctivc aid of our representative
to that Government and through the intimidation
eaused by the pre-ence of an armed liavnl force of
UietJiiited StHte which was lnhded for that purpose
at (ho instance of our Minister. Upon the facti de
Teloped it fct-enied to me the only honorable course
for our Govern:ncnt to pursue was to undo the
wrong that bnd leeii done by thoe representing us
and to restore ns fur at practicable tbe ntntus. ex
ist In i; at the lime of our forcible intervention.

of tberccotiiidialiiueut of any definite re

Additional ndviee are oon expected. When

accomp.inieil by n special lixecuiive message; fully
detailing all the facts mccvulry to a complete un
derstanding of the. ca-e. and presenting a hUtory
of all the nia'erial events leading up to the present
situation.
In arcoidauce with the spirit of tho resolution
adopted by Congress in the Spring of lb'JO, tho
International 'American Conference of Wash
ington by resolution expressed the wish that all
controversies between the Republics of America
and the Nations of Europe might be settled by
arbitration, and that the Governments repre
sented in the Conference might communicate
this desire to all other friendly powers. Tho
President takes signal pleasure in layine be
fore Congress a Parliamentary resolution cor
dially sympathizing with tho purpose in view.
THE TIJEAfcUKY.
Of the condition of the Treasury tbe Presi
dent says:
Tiie Secretary of tho Treasury reports that tho
receipts of the Government from nil source-during
the li-cnl year ended June 30, 1S1J3, amounted to

FINANCIAL 6IIUATI0.V.
Of the financial situation tho President says:
The recent repeal of tbe provision of law requir
ing the purchase of silver bullion by the Govern
ment us a feature of our monetary ccbeuiu iias
siauean cnllre change in tbe complexion of our
currency affairs. I do not doubt that tiie ultimate
result of tins hctiou will be most nululary mid fur
reaching. Of course, after the recent financial perturbation,
time Is necessary for the re-cntnblisliment of busi
Bcm conti Jence. When, however, through this
restored confidence tbe money which has been
frightened into hoarding-places Is returned to
trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation will
probably disclose a safe path leading to u perma
nently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to
Beet every requirement of our increasing popula
tion and business.
The Superintendent of Immigration, through
the Secretary of tho Treasury, reports that
daring the last fiscal year there arrived at our
orts 440,793 immigrants. Of these 1.0G3 were
.sot permitted to land under tho limitations of
tbe law, and 577 were returned to the countries
from whence they camo by reason of their
having become public charges. The total ar
rivals were 141,034 less than for tho previous
year.
In his references to tho Army and Navy tho
President goes over the ground coveted by tho
statements and recommendations of his Secre
taries. Tho President condemns tho fco system as
applicable to tho compensation of United States
attorneys, marshals, clerks of Federal courts
and United States commissioners.
The President heartily joins tho Attorney
Gcueral in recommending legislation fixing
degrees of the crime of murder within Federal
jurisdiction, as has been done in many of tho
States; authorizing writs of error on behalf of
tbe Government in cases where filial judgment
1 is rendered aiuiiust the sulliciency of an iudict
socut or against tho Government upon any
j atber question arising before actual trial; lim
iting tho right of review in cases of felony
punishable only by fine and imprisonment to
the Circuit Court of Appeals, and making
speedy provision for tho construction of such
prisons and reformatories as may bo necessary
for tho confinement of United States convicts.
Tho business of tho United States mails indi
cates with absolute certainty tho condition of
tho business of the country, and depression in
financial affairs inevitably and quickly reduces
the postal revenues. Therefore a largor dis
crepancy than usual betweon the Postofiice
receipts and expenditures is-tho expected and
unavoidable result.
PENSIONS.
Of pensions the President saya:
The Secretary of the Interior has the supervision
of so many important subjects that his report ia of
especial value and interest.
On tho 30ib day of June, 1893. there woro on tho
pension-rolls 96C.012 names, an Increase of 89.914
over tho number on the rolls Juno 30, 1892. Of
these there were 17 widows and daughters of Revo
lutionary soldierx. 8G survivors of tho war of 1812,
5.425 widow s of soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors
nnd widows of the Mexican war, 3,882survivorsand
wuloMsof Indians wins. 284 Army Nurses, nnd 475,-
G15survivois. and widows and children of deceased
soldieisaud tailors oftbe war of the rebellion. Tho
latter number represent those pensioned on nc
eount of disabilities or dentil resulting from army
and iiiivv Huivict. The number of neraons remain
ing on tho rolls June 30. IS93. who were pensioned
under the act of June 27, 1890, which allows pen
sions on account of death and disability not charge
able to army ervice, was 439,155.
Tho number added to the rolls during tho year
was 123.G31, and the number dropped was 33.G90.
Tbe first payment on pensions allowed during tho
year amounted to S33.75C.519.9S. This includes ar
rears, or tbe accumulation between tho titno from
u.iich the allowance of pension dates and the time
of actually granting the certificate.
Although the law of 1S90 permits pensions for
disibdities not related to military service, yet ns a
reqiii-iile to its benefits a disability must exit in
cap.icilnting applicants "from the performance of
manual labor to such a degree as to rentier them
unable to earn a support." The execution of this
law in ite early stages doc? not seem to have been
in accord with its true intention; but toward tbe
close of the last Admnustialioii an authoritative
construction was given to the statute, and since
that tunc lids cou-triietion tins been followed.
This bits bad the effect of limiting tbe operation of
tho Inw to its intended purpose. The diieovery
having been made that in my names had been put
upon ihe pension-roll by means of wholesale nnd
gigantic frauds, the Commi-sioner suspended pay
ments upon a number of pensions which seemed
to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending a com
plete examination, giving notice to tho pensioners,
in order that they might have an opportunity to
establish, if possible, the justice of their claims
notwithstanding apparent invalidity.
Tiii", I uudei.-tand, is the practice which has for
along time prevailed in the Pension Bureau; but
after entering upon these iccciit investigations, tbe
Commissioner modified this rule so as not to allow,
until after u complete examination, interference.
w ith the payment of a pension apparently not alto
gether void, but which merely had been fixed at a
rate higher than that authorized by law.
I am unable to undeisland why frauds in the
pension-rolls should not be exposed and corrected
with thoroughness anil vigor. Uvcry name fraud
ulently put upon thoe rolls is n wicked imposition
upon the kindly sentiment in -which pensions bnve
their origin; every fraudulent pensioner has be
come a bad citizen; every false oath in support of
a pension has made pcijury more common, and
(alse and undeserving pensioners rob the pcop'o
not only of their money, but of the patriotic senti
ment which the survivors of n war, fought for the
preservation of the Union, ought to inspire. Thou
sands of neighborhoods have their well-known
fraudulent pensioner", nnd recent developments
by tho Unrcaii establish appalling conspiracies lo
nccomplish pension frauds. By uo means the least
wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners,
who certainly ought not to bo condemned lo such
association.
Those who attempt in the line of duty to rectify
the- wrongs should not be accused of enmity or
indifference to tho claims of honest veterans.
The sum expended on account of pensions for
the year ended June 30. 1893, was 8l3C.710.4ii7.14.
The Commissioner estimates that S1C5.000.000 will
be required to pay pensions during the yeur end
ing June 30, 1894.
THE INDIANS.
The solution of tho Indian problem depends
very largely upon good administration. The
personal fitness of agents. and their adaptability
to tho peculiar duty of caring for their wards
is of tho utmost importance.
Secular education and moral and religions
teaching must bo important factors in any
effort to save the Indian and lead him to civil
ization. Tho relinquishment of tribal rela
tions and the holding of land in severalty may,
in favorable conditions, aid this consummation.
The vast area of land which, but a shorty
time ago, constituted tho public domain is'
rapidly falling into privato hands. 15ut it is
certain that in the transfer tho beneficent in
tention of tho Government to supply from its
domain homes to tho industrious and worthy
home-Seekers is often frustrated. The Presi
dent deplores this, and calls attention to the
Secretary of Interior's recommendations.
The time has conio when efficient measures
should be taken for the preservation of our
forests from indiscriminate and remediless de
struction. AomcnLTunE.
Tho President reviews the report of the Sec
retary of Agricultuie. The exports of agri
cultural products from the United Statos for
the fiscal year ending' June 3. 1892, attained
the enormous figure of $SOO,000.000 in round
numbers, being 7ri.7 per cent, of our total ex
ports. In the last fiscal year this aggregate
was greatly reduced, hut nevertheless readied
$015,000,000, being 75.1 per cent, of all American
commodities exported.
In each State and Territory an Agricultural
ExperiiucutStation has been established. Theso
stations, by their very character aud name, are
the proper agencies to experiment with and
test new varieties of seeds; aud yet there i.sau
indiscriminate! aud wasteful distribution by
legislation and legislators, answering no pur
pose unless it ho to remind constituents that
their representatives are willing to remember
them with gratuities at public cost. So he ad
vices tho stoppage of promiscuous free-seed dis
tribution. CIVIL SERVICE.
As to civil s'rvico the President says:
The continued intelligent execution of the Civil
Service law ami tbe increa-ing approval by the
people of its operation are nio-t gratifying. The
recent extension of its limiiatious and regulations
lo tha employes at free-delivery po-toflices. which
lias been honestly and promptly accomplished by
tbe Commission, whi the hearty co-operation of
the I'o-tmantcr-Gcnernl, is an immensely import
nut advance in the usefulne-s of the system.
I Hiu, if po-iihle, more than ever convinced of the
incalculable benefits conferred by the Civil Service
law. not only in its i fleet upon tbe public erviec,
but uImi, what is even more important, in its eil'ect
in elevating tho tone of political life generally.
THE TARIFF.
On the subject of tariff reform tho President
says :
After a hard struggle larllT reform is directly be
fore us. Nothing ro important claims our attention
mid nothing so clearly presents itself as both an
oppoittiuity and a dutj an opportunity todeservo
the gratitude of our fellow citizens and a duty im
posed upon us by our oft-repealed professions ami
by the emphatic mandate of the people. After full
dlcu-hion our countrymen have Mpokeu in favor
of this leform, and they have confided the work of
its accomplishment lo the hands of those who arc
HolfMiiuy pledged to it.
If there is anything In the theory of a represen
tation in public places of the jieople aud their de
Mies, if public oilieurs arc really the servants of
the peopif, and If political promiies and profes
fious have any binding force, our failure to give
the relief no long awaited will be sheer recreancy.
Nothing should intervene to dinlract our attention
or disturb our ff rt until this reform is accomplish
ed by wise and careful legislation.
While wo should .stancbly adhere lo the princl-
file that only the necessity of revenue ju-tllles tho
mpoBition of luritr duties and other Federal tax
ation, and that they should be limited by strict
economy, we cannot close our eyes lo the fact thhl
conditions have grown up among ui which in
justice and fairnes call for discriminating care In
the distribution of such duties and taxation as tho
emergencies of our Government actually demand.

(l tlr
fiffc lis- Is
Manifestly, if wo are to aid tho people directly
through tariff reform, ono of its most obvious fea
tures should be a reduction in present tariff charges
upon the necessities of life. The benefits of such a
reduction would be pilpable and substantial, seen
aud felt by thousands who would be better fed and
better clothed and better sheltered. Theso gifts
should be the willing benefactions of n Govern
ment whose highest function ia the promotion of
the welfare of the people.
Not less closely related to our pooplc's prosper-
ity aud well-being is the removal of restrictions
upon tho importation of tho raw materials neces
sary to our manufactures. Tho world should bo
open to our National ingenuity nnd enterprise.
This cannot be while Federal legislation, through
the iinpoMition of high tariff, forbids to American
manufacturers ns cheap materials n thoio nued.by
their competitors. It is quite obvious thnt, tho
enhancement of the price of our manufactured
products resulting from this policy not only coif
fines tho market for these products within our own
borders to the dircet disadvantage of our manu
facturers, but also increases their cost to our
citizens.
The interests of labor are certainly, though in
directly, involved in this feature of our tariff sys
tem. Tho sharp competition nnd nctivo struggle
among our manufacturers to supply tho limhed
demand for their good", soon fill the narrow mar
ket to which they nro confined. Then follows a
suspension of work in mills nnd factories, a dis
charge of employes, and distress in tho homes of
our workingmeu.
Even if the often disproved nsscrtion could bo
made good that a lower rato of wnges would re
sult from fiee raw materials nnd low tnriff dutie,
tho intelligence of our workiugiMen leads them
quickly to di.--covcr that their steady employment,
permitted by free raw materials, is the mo-d im
portant factor in their relation to tariff legislation.
A mc'iMirc lias been prepared by the appropriate
Congressional committee embodying tariff reform
on the lines lieiein suggested, which will bo
promptly submitted for legislative action. It is
the result of much patriotic and unselfish woik,
ami I bclicvo it deals with its subject consistently
nml as thoroughly ns existing conditions permit.
1 am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties pro
vided for in tho proposed legislation, added to ex
isting internal revenue taxation, will, in tbo near
future, though perhaps not immediately, produce
sufficient revenue lo meet the needs of tho Govern
ment. Tho committee, after full consideration, nnd to
provide against n temporary deficiency which may
exwt before the biisine-s of the country adjusts
itself lo the new tariff schedules, have wisely em
braced in their plan a few additional internal-revenue
taxes, including a small tnx upon incomes
derived from certain corporate investmenlH.
These new assessments nro not only absolutely
just and easily borne, but they bnve the further
merit of being such as can be remitted without un
favorable business disturbance whenever the neces
sity of their imposition uo longer exists.
In my great desire for tho success of this moastiro
I cannot restrain the suggestion thnt its succcs can
only be atlniued by means of unselfish counsel on
the part of the friends of tariff reform aud as n
result of their willingness to subordinate personal
desires and ambitious to the general good. Tho
local interests affected by the proposed reform nro
so numerous and so varied that if all are Insisted
upon the legislation embodying the reform must
inevitably fail.
In conclusion, my intense, feeling of responsi
bility impells me to invoke for tho manifold inter
ests of n generous and confiding people the most
scrupulous care and to pledge my willing support
lo every legislative effort forlliondvaiiccme.nl of
tho greatness nnd prosperity of our beloved coun
try. NEW TARIFF BILL.
Characterized ly Sweeping: Reductions and
Extensive Free Idst.
The now tariff bill was mado public last
week. As has been anticipated, it is a radical
measure. Sweeping reductions aro mado in
the duty on manufactured articles, aud upon
the frco list arc articles that have always been
protected from importation by moro or less
prohibitive tariffs. The importance of the hill
lies in the fact, also, that with House aud Sen
ate and President Democratic, the changes
which aro proposed stand an excellent chattco
of being enacted into laws.
The minority have had neitherlot nor parcel
in tho framing of tho measure, but they have
been allowed 10 days in which to prepare a
minority report, and it can now bo predicted
that this document will wave aloft, with un
diminished enthusiasm, tho Hag of protection.
The Democrat aro now wrestling with the
internal revenue features of the bill, which
arc important, because, in some way, tho deficit
caused by tho enlargement of tho free list and
tho reduction of duties will have to bo mado
good.
Thero is absolutely no protection per seo in tho
bill. Asa matter of fact, the Committee seems to
havo go no even beyond tho letter of its instruc
tions in the National Democratic platform. If
tho proposed measure wero to ho enacted into
law as it at the present stands, without some in
ternal revenue feature, such as an incomo tax,
added, it would fail to meet the current
expenses of the Treasury by at least $50,000,000,
and, perhaps, $00,000,000. It is asserted by
Some of tho members of the committee that,
tho incomo tax will meet this eutiro defici
ency. It is claimed by tho Republicans that every
Secretary of tho Troasuary, from Aloxander
Hamilton down to Mr. Manning, with thesingle
exception of Secretary Walker, has advocated
tho adoption of specific duties as the best
method of protecting tho Government against
fraud. Representative Uurrows pointed ont
that when times nro hard and prices low, the
ad valorem duty is also low, and thus tho im
portation of foreign products is rendered easiest
at tho very timo when the mills and foundries
ought to bo giving labor to our own people.
Chairman Wilson declares that specific duties
lead to great frauds in administration, for count
ing and weighing at the custom-house are done
by the cheapest nnd most easily-corrupted labor,
while ad valorem rates are assessed by the best
paid and most responsible appraisers; that the
ad valorem system has worked well in practice
and is essentially the fair system, becauso it is
a tax upon tho actual value of an article
. Among tho heavy reductions wearing apparel
is reduced from 82 per cent, to 40 per cent.;
blankets, which also pay 82 per cent., are now
brought down to 23, 30, and 35 per cent., and
woolen cloths, which averaged 125 per cent, in
the McKinley bill, aro placed at 40 per cent, in
the now bill. Women's dress goodsaud carpets
arc also relieved from tho heavy duty which
has been imposed upon them; Brussels carpets
being cut from SO to 30 per cent. Cotton goods
show a reduction equally great, while iron and
steel aro cut down to tho lowest possible margin.
Steel rails aro now to come in at about $6 per tun
instead of $13.41. Tin plate, which now pays a
duty of 2 2 10 cents per pound, equivalent to
an ad valorem duty of 73 per cent., is cut to 40
cents. Hay is reduced from $1 to $2 a ton. Po
tatoes aro cut from 25 cents a bushel to 10 cents.
Tho free list is very long. All the free articles
in the McKinloy bill havo been lot alone. Wo
give below tho most important of tho added
list, with the duty under the existing law:
Articles for the use of tho United States, coal,
iron, and other ores, coke, ilax, hemp, clay,
salt, binding twine, lumber, cotton ties, salt,
mica, bacon, and hams (now five cents a pound),
beef, mutton, and pork (each two cents a
pound), bristles (10 cents a pound), cabbages
(three cents each), cotton oil (30 cents a pound),
cotton tics of iron or steel cut to lengths,
punched or not punched, with or without
buckles, for bailing cotton; cotton-seed oil (10
cents a gallon), egg (five cents perdozen), lard
(two cents a pound), milk, fresh (live centH a
gallon), plants, trees, shrubs, aud vines of all
kinds commonly known as nursery stock, not
specially provided for in this act (20 per cent,
ud valorem) ; plows, tooth and disc harrows,
harveatets, reapers, drills, mowers, horsemkos,
cultivators, thrashing-machines, and cotton
gins; soap, nil not otherwise specially pro
vided for in this act (20 per cent, ad valorem);
seeds of all kinds not specially provided for in
this act (20 per cent, ad valorem); straw (30
per cent, ad valorem); tin ore, cassitcrito or
black oxide of tin. and tin in bars, blocks, pigs,
or grain or granulated (under the McKinloy
law tin oro was on tho free list until tho 1st of
last July); all wool of tho sheep, hair of tho
camel, goat, alpaca, and other like animals, and
all wool and hair on tho skin, noils, yarn waste,
card waste, bur wasto. rags and Hocks, includ
ing all wasto, or rags, composed wholly or in
part of wool (11, 12, and 13 cents per pound,
according to grado).
Gen. Idlly Bead.
Tho news of tho death of Gen. William Lilly,
Pennsylvania's Ropresontativo-at-Largo, at his
homo in Mauch Chunk, was received in Wash
ington with much regret, for ho was well
known and gouorally admired here.
Gen. Lilly was born at Penn Yau, N, Y
Juno 3, 1821. his father, Col. William Lilly,
being a well-known citizen of western New
York, who removed to Mauch Chunk in April,'
1838. t
Ho became engaged in railroading and min
ing, and took great intorest in military mat
tors.
Until tho Autumn of 18G2 Gen. Lilly was an
l active Democrat. Sinco then ho had been a
delegate to six National Republican Conven
tions and to every Republican State Conven
tion sinco 1803. Ho was a strong protective
tariff man, and was chairman of tho New York
Tariff Convention in 1881. Ho had been en
gaged in tho mining of anthracite coal sinco
1859, was a life member of tho Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Ameri

OPENING ofogd:ngress.
Scones Attending- tho 'OStavenlng- of Our
National 3Bsta&B.
Thcro were no nnusuihBranos attending tho
jogulur opening of Cotcrrexn Since tho ad
journment of the extrardifeBry session both
Houses wore thoroughlysqpsired, now carpots
putdown, the furnituroa'opnJishcd, and every
thtntr madoto look frcsbjjVNBmcrous wero tho.
, greet iugs exchanged in fcha.fionato before tho
gavel of tho Vico-PrcsidsnttxiahQ uouy caitca
tho members to order.
Tho message reached, fjfchfe-?ISonate at 1:30
o'clock. The reading of Jthotiacssage was list
ened to with tho closest vttea tion by tho Sena
tors present, but scarcely a movement or a
facial expression from ono of them indicated at
any timo what impression it was making.
Tho conclusion of tho reading, howovor, wa3
tho signal for a demonstration of hostility on
tho part of the Republicans.
Senator Gorman roscwhou the Reading Clork
finished and moved tho printing of tho docu
ment. Senator Cock roll followed with a formal
motion, tho effect of which was merely to de
fer for a brief time consideration of tho Presi
dent's rccommcudntious The Republicans,
howovor, at onco assumed that this was an
attempt to shut them off from all opportunity
to attack tho message.
A heated discussion between Senator Cock
rell and the Republican leaders was threatened,
when Senator Gorman set matters straight by
explaining that ho had uo intention of pre
venting a discussion of the mossag'o, and would
move to-morrow that an additional number of
copies bo printed. This, he said, would give
everyono an opportunity to mako speeches.
There wero not nearly so many desks in tho
Houso adorned with flowor3 as is usually tho
case on tho opening of tho annual session of
Congress. Messrs. Rusk and McKaig each re
ceived a largo bunch of roses. Tho floor was
less crowded nlso, but perhaps this was duo to
the extra vigilance of tho doorkeepers in ex
cluding unprivileged persons.
Tho President's messago was listened to with
much moro than ordinary attontion, caused
doubtless by tho fact that so many topics of
surpassing intorest wero discussed. A larger
space than has heretofore been tho case in simi
lar documents is devoted to foreign affairs.
At the conclusion of this tho deaths of Rep
resentatives Lilly and O'Neill wero announced,
aud out of respect both Houses adjourned.
THOSE SPOONS.
Tho Vruth Ahout Thorn as Told by Gen.
IJutler Himself.
" Almost cvorybody knows something of tho
famous war story of tho lato Gen. IJutler and
the Bpoons," said Mr. J. W. Doifffvan, of Detroit,
in a recent conversation; "but I heard the
story direct from tho General himself, when
ho was on thc"stump in tho campaign of 1872.
It was at Indianapolis.
"A crowd of fully 10,000 porsons wero gath
ered undor a canvas tent. IJutler was in full
dress his usnnl habit when before tho public
and was as smiling as a brido. He wa3 at
his best, a condition which meant a great deal
in a man liko IJutler. As he stepped to the
front of tho platform and bowed, ho was given
an ovation.
"Holding a newspaper closo to his eyes, he
said :
"'Tho papor I hold is tho Mount Vernon
Times. Tho item I am aboacto read ia slightly
personal. I'll read it.'
"Then ho road as follows:
"'The citizens of Mount "Tcrnon will bo
treated on Tuesday forenoon to tho sight of
tho most hideous-looking man in America,
when Ron IJutler will speak 'for tho Republi
cans.' "Here Gen. IJutler paused for a moment im
pressively, then finished the 'paragraph with
ringing emphasis.
" ' Citizens, tako care df your spoons.'
"A wild burst of applause 'followed, which
Gen. IJutler stilled with a wave of his right
hand. Then ho turned Uho profilo of his faco
to his audience and said:
" 'Now, I am on exhibitio'ivon that point.'
"A powerful speech of an hour and a half,
urging tho election of Gen. Grant, followed,
after which Gen. Butler mapped his heated
face and tackled the spoon question.
"'I have-never before attourpted to answer tho.
slanders and calumnies that follow-the career
of mon who become the marks of their enemies,'
ho said, 'but I will pay my respects to this
littlo editor and his companion on a local paper.'
"Gen. IJutler then burst forth in a philippic
fun, severity sarcasm, and eloquence alter
nating. Ho swayed that vast nudienco as few
such audiences had over been swayed boforo.
Hundreds jumped upon their seats and yelled:
"'Give it to him! Give it to him! D n
him ! Hit him again ! '
"This excitement continued for fully half an
hoar, when tho speaker suddenly wound up
with tho story of how he had been placod in
command when Now Orleans was in open re
bellion; how he had cleaned the streets, re
claimed a million dollars worth of wasto lands,
brought order out of chaos by proclaiming that
if the women ot tho city did not ceaso from
throwing slops down tho necks of his soldiers
while they were on guard duty, from their win
dows, they would bo classed as 'women of tho
town' and treatod accordingly a threat which
stopped the method of insult, nnd led to thuir
saying, in thoir anger, that such a man would
steal spoons.
'"With a half million men under my com
mand,' tho General thundered, 'with millions
of money under my control, with all this vast
responsibility, with life and death at my finger
ends, how much timo do you think how much
timo do you really think old Ren IJutler had
to crawl into back yards and steal spoons? '
"That," concluded Mr. Donovan, '" was a
speech and a climax that I havo never been
able to forget."
e
Van Alun Declines.
Mr. J. J. Van Alen, of Rhodo Island, whoso
nomination to bo Ambassador to Italy caused
widespread comment and criticism, and met
with considerable opposition in tho Senate, will
not represent this Government at Romo after
all. His failure to qualify has been tho occa
sion of some remark, hut the fact of his declina
tion of tho high post of honor was a State De
partment secret, known only in Administration
circles, until last Monday, when Mr. Van Alen
himself gavo out tho correspondence relating
to his declination.
m
No Ilooth for Them.
Russia is evidently determined that tho
Salvation Army shall not bo added to tho list
of religious bodies that disturb tho serenity of
tho orthodox church. No member of tho army
is permitted to enter tho territories of tho Czar,
aud tho pioscription seems to bo carried even
to tho name of tho chiof of tho army.
This was curiously illustrated recently by
tho experience of an English lumber merchant
named Booth, who started for Russia on a busi
ness trip, with a passport duly issued aud
vised. Ho reached tho Russian frontier at
Eydtkuhneu, aud presented his papers, but was
jn formed that special instructions from St.
Petersburg prevented hi3 entering tho country.
Ho went to soveral other frontier towns aud
met tho same reception.
It was onlyaftor his return home that ho
discovered that his name was tho barrier that
kept him out of Russia. It was nssumod that,
being a Booth, he was soma relation to or dis
ciple of "General" Booth.
