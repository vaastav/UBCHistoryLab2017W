THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
On the first page of this issue
we give the presidents mes
sage in full It is short and plain
ly worded aitd deals exclusively
wkh tariff revision and the 140
000000 surplus that will have
accumulated in the national treas
ury by next June The Itepubli
lieane say it is a free trade docu
ment complimentary since they
can find o other fault with it
The high tariff Democrats do not
like tlie sentiment of the message
yet they are compelled to admire
tlie courage of its author But
the low tariff people read it with
a relish and their name is legion
i iirciicsiuciit j Bimmseu ill ins
It views by all classes except the
If manufacturers and producers of
wool sugar aitd rice and many of
tLem are with him
TAULBEE
Tlie Congressman from our
neighboring district over the way
the Hon Preston Taulbee is
charged at Washington with de
cidedly improper conduct in con
nection with a pretty young fe
male in tlie Patent Office Depart
ment Mr Taulbee secured her a
clerkship last February and she
was registered as from Kentucky
but she claims to be from else
where Taulbee spent the sum
mer in Washington and bought a
Itotise He and the pretty clerk
were shadowed to an unfrequent
ed nook in the upper story of the
Patent Office and a sensation fol
lowed Mr Taulbees first effort
will be to make his wife believe
that lie is a persecuted and black
mailed man and then will come
an angry constituency to know
why he appointed a woman from
another State when there are so
many persons in Kentucky yea
in hk own district who want of
fice Those two elements appeas
ed he will have the greater part
of the victory won for the public
will most likely treat him as were
Beeoher Blaine and Cleveland
DLACKBUEX OX TARIFF
Concerning tariff legislation
Senator Blackburn say 6
UI regard Randall as the pivot
upon which the whole situation is
swung and express great fears as
to what he may do But
Mr Randall is reading the hand
writing on the wall and it is too
plain for him to need an Inter
preter like Belshazzer did I
hope he is too sensible a man to
stand in the way now If he
does he must be regarded as
a marplot as a man who stands
in the way of righting the coun
trys wrongs The situation is a
graygjne
Representative Stone from the
First district says The House
must without failure pas a bills
Teduoing taxes this session or our
aajoriV jtfU be reserved The
country demands it My
vate preference would be to make
all the reduction from the rotten
tariff list I would vote for the
repeal of the tax on tobacco if
that is sure to pass Our state is
in favor of that Then I am lor
taking the tariff from the prime
necessaries of life We must
show something tangible by next
fall
THE TWIN CITIES
TIP
Two cities equal iu magnitude to
St Paul and Minneapolis do not often
prow so olosn lnrpthpr A urmno n
only twelve miles separates litem and
tlie half way point is marked bv the
State Fair grounds and bouses of vari
ous kinds are springing up along tiie
way between The Fair grounds are
not erected on any diminutive scale
They extend over a hundred acres and
permanent buildings of wide dimensions
dot the space in every direction Tlie
Fair was in progress when I was there
in September and I found horses and
cattle from many different states The
race track is not among the least of the
attractions The art gallery contained
some of tlie rarest paintings in the
United States ranging in price from
5000 to 510000 and this too while tlie
Minneapolis exposition was in progress
with Us wonderfully fine collection of
paintings Finer vegetables were
probably never seen any where One
pumpkin weighed 135 pounds I saw
a man draw in three dozen ears of corn
and he hadnt any muscular energy to
spare Southern Minnesota produces
excellent corn while in tlie northern
part it does not grow at all but those
two parts of the State are a long way
removed from each other I remarked
to the man with the big corn that a
poor cow or horse that might chance to
come along would have a picnic at
his place if he would only leave the
gate open Not much picnic
wearily replied the man except
around the edges corn stands so thick
on tlie ground that a cow cant walk
through it stranger All the North
west had sent its choicest specimeus of
produce The thrift and general pros
perity of those live people were abund
antly set forth The factories were
well represented Drake Co of St
Paul stone works who have their fac
tor at Sioux Falls where they do all
their tawing aud cutting by water
power had on exhibition a section of
auagatiued tree taken from Agate Park
Arizona aud sawed at Sioux Falls It
was twenty six inches in diamater aud
near three feet long One piece was
sawed off to form tlie top of a small
table It was the finest specimen of
agate I ever saw and as a matter of
curiosity I asked the price Mr Drake
replied that it was sold to a Masonic
Lodge in Philadelphia for their altar
top aud the price was twelve hundred
dollars
St Paul is a great aud growing city
It is ierhaps most noted for its winter
carnivals A gorgeous palace is con
structed entirely of ice at an expense of
thousands of dollars having towers
and spires and domes and the weather
being uniformly cold it stands until
spring time People visit it by hun
dreds aud at night it is brilliantly illumi
nated witli electricity The ice palace
carnival is to St Paul what Mardi Gras
is to New OrIeau8and people from long
distances visit it
St Paul is the parent ot that colossal
railroad system the St Paul Minneap
olis aud Manitoba Railway that pene
trates every portion of Minnesota aud
the ramifications of which extend into
Manitoba Assiuiboia Dakota and
Montana The past summer eight
hundred miles were added to the sys
tem by construction
I saw a business house in St Paul that
filled my idea of perfection in tlie way
of exhibiting goods It stood on a
corner and the end aud entire side of
the first story were plate glass 1 saw
one iu Chicago like it
But Minneapolis is a second Chicago
It is a marvelous city and growing
day by day Its buildiugs possess a
noticeable magnitude It is clean and
bright aud beautiful Proceeding from
St Paul you are awe inspired by the
gigantic stone viaduct of twenty four
arches that conveys the train obliquely
across aud up the river into that splen
did structure known as the union
depot You are overpowered by objects
of interest as you glide over thai
mar vel of engineering skill t lie viaduct
There is St Antuonys Falls of which
you have read in your school days
above it a snow white suspension
bridge and to the rigtil is the Pills
bury A Millthe largest flouring mill in
the world having a capacity of seven
thousand barrels of flour a day con
suming thirty five thousand bushels
of wheat Near it are five saw mills
that cost 50000 apiece and overlook
ing them is the expansive and lower
ing exposition building On the left
are the famous Washburne mills aod
under you is the raging Mississippi
while all around is a great city From
what bridge fave famous old Loudon
can one see so much
But the wonders do not cease upon
leaving the train Walk up Nicolet
street say at night aud you are struck
with the display of gas Six squares
area solid blaze of light The gas
posts are only twelve feet apart and
an arch reaches from one to another
along tlie street every arch having
five jets aud every post 4iiteen At
the intersection of other streets there is
a vast pyramid of jets and half way
the squares are arches extending across
Nicolet street each haviug eighty jets
There are one thousand jets to the
square for six squares or six thousand
lets before you at one glance all in
closed in globes of red white and blue
street is broad and well paved and the
houses are from three to seyeu and
eight stories high I think the Lumber
Exchange is teuand the West hotel
would do credit to Chicago or New
York Wheu the exposition is in
progress or the State Fair or tlie Ice
Palace is on at St Paul the gas lets
of Nicolet street are turned on in all
their magnificence aud the people
come in their carriages and form a
procession driving up one side of the
street aud down the other They con
tinue to drive for an hour or two with
noted regularity By taking a position
at any point along the line one can
soon see the people of importance about
the city
It is the water power that has made
Minneapolis St Anthonys Falls
were not made in vain The water is
diverted from the river iuto the numer
ous aud gigantic mills and Minnesota
and Dakota wheal pour Into them by
the St P M M road in as great
abundance as the water does by the
Mississippi Barrel after barrel car
after car aud train after train load of
flour leaves the Flour City daily for
all parts of the universe
Among the countless attractions I
taw Ju the Exposition was HarneUa
painting of the old violin which Is val
ued at 3300 A faithful copy of It
hangs Iu the Madison Club aud is a
present from Mr J K Hurd the
pharmacist and druggist corner
Fourth and Elm streets Cincinnati
Liberatli and hb captlvatlug band
from New York attracted multitudes
to the Exposition It would require a
large volume to describe the Expo
alt ion and I could fill a eerlea of vol
umes on the Minneapolis Milwaukee
aud Chicago expositions aud the Min
nesota Fair
Among the residents of Minneapolis
is Mr Tom Hawkins a nativeof Owen
county Ky and who visited Rich
mond last summer He is a horse
dealer and has a large stable in a promi
nent partfof the city
Near Minneapolis is the widely
known summer resort Lake Miune
touka Tlie two largest hotels are the
Hotel St Louis aud the Hotel La Fay
ette the former of which was owned
by Mrs Eglnton of Winchester Ky
The lake is a beautiful body of water
and has upon it two large steamers
and numerous smaller craft
Numbers ot persons have thought
from several pieces similar to the above
thatl was away from home at the
time they were written in fact away
up in the fir North west among the
scenes about which I wrote but I must
say for the information of those persons
that I am not there noir nor was I
when those articles were wrltteu I
was there in September but I am at
home now and if you doubt it call and

Misouri Clerk re elected J B
Leedom of Ohio Sergeant at Arms
re elected A B Hurt of Mississippi
Doorkeeper instead of Mr Donelson
Lycurgus Daltou Postmaster and the
blind preacher W Milburn Chaplain
The next business was the assignment
to seats and tlie drawing began by
a blind folded Page drawing slips of
paper having numbers of the seats
thereon from a bat as the names of the
members were called in alphabetical
order Very few of the members re
elected got back their old seats and
many of tiie best seats went to new
members No member in the House
shows up to greater advantage than
Governor McCreacy He is a fine type
of the southern statesman long
straight hair rotund figure and beam
ing face The only thing that caused
any excitement was the singing of the
long meter doxology by a member of
the Salvation Army who arose iu the
gallery and after calling aloud to the
members to join in with hiiu proceeded
to sing it himself and finished it before
beiug arrestei under orders from the
Clerk of the House It was Immedi
ately after roll call and before the elec
tion of Speaker The members were
at first dumbfounded but iu a moment
appreciated the situation and made
the halls ring witii peals of laughter
After the allotment of seats the House
adjourned
The Senate was called to order by
President pro tempore Inglls and
after prayer by the Chaplain tlie fol
lowing newly elected Senators were

L Q C Lamar to be Associate Justice
of the U 8 Supreme Court Wm F
Vilas to be Secretary of the Interior
and Don M Dickinson of Michigan
to be Post Master General and to hear
read the Presidents message after
which tlie Senate adjourned
The Democrats with very few ex
ceptions are delighted with the mes
sage which is devoted exclusively to
the question of tariff reform so as to
render action thereon imperative
while the Republicans say that it will
be the key note of the next Campaign
and the death of tlie Democratic party
Speaker Carlisle says that lie expects
to announce the Committees before
the Christmas holidays
The U 8 Supreme Court on Monday
in tiie Virginia Habeas Corpus cases

was acting without Constitutional
authority in making his order The

declare that the State as a political
