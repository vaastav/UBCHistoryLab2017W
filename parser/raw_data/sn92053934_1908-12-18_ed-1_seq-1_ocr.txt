The Hague, Dec. 18. The foreign
office here places no credence in the
report Venezuela has declared war
against the Netherlands. It is belfev
ed the only basis for the report is the
recent declaration by-Vice President
Gomez of Venezuela that his country
was in a "state of defense" because of
Holland's seizure of the coast guard'
ship Alexfs.
Caxtro Han Ronbtx.
Berlin, Dec. 18. Both the German
foreign office and President Castro dis
credit the report Venezuela has de
ar against the Netherlands.
Merely "Stale of Defeime."
Washington, Dec. IS. Something of
a flurry was caused in. diplomatic cir-
oles yesterday over the report which
generally-obtained that Venezuela had
declared war against Holland. These
reports had their foundation in the
dispatch which came to the state de
partment from Bogota, transmitting a
telegram from Caracas, saying that the
government hadx declared a state of
war. It was soon pointed out, . how
ever, that this announcement was bas
ed on Vice President Gomez's declara
tion that the country is in a state of
defense because of Holland's act in
seizing the coast guardship 'Alexis.
See Little Difference.
Officials interested in the situation
profess to see no actual difference be
tween a "state of war" and a "state
of defense," taking the position that it
is a case of "distinction without a dif
ference." A renewal of the demonstra
tions against the administration ofj
President Castro would not be surpris
ing to the state department.
While It is premature to speculate,
should the feeling against the presi--dent
develop to the extent of an open
revolution and consequent overthrow
of his government, the state depart
ment, it is understood, would lose no
time in resuming diplomatic inter
course with the new administration to
the end that some action might be
taken on the unsettled claims against
Venezuela and the resumption of
friendly relations.
Avoid Making; Castro Hero.
It has been the common belief in
Washington that had the United
States taken any forceful steps against
Venezuela Castro would have become
a veritable hero in the eyes of the
people there. Now that Castro has

Flushing, N. Y., Dec. 18. The most
dramatic story yet told of the slaying
of William E. Annis was recounted to
day in the trial of Thornton J. Hains,
charged with being the principal with

Washington, Dec. 18. Philander C.
Knox, now serving as United States
senator from Pennsylvania, will be

inet. The direct request has been
made by Mr. Taft. and Senator Knox
has consented to serve; -
His consent was given with some re
luctance, as he practically had chosen
the national legislature as the field
where his abilities could be utilized to
much better advantage than in the
executive department of the govern
ment. It is realized by those who are ac
quainted with the circumstances in the
matter that Mr. Knox, in agreeing to
take the foreign affairs portfolio, is
making a great sacrifice of his person

Washington, D. C, Dec. 18. A story ,
which connects President Roosevelt
with the discbmforture of several
young women from Forest Glen Semi
nary for Girls, near Washington, and
charges him with "hogging" the road
while out horseback riding Thanks
giving morning, is current in Washing
ton. Miss E. I. Sisson, one of the instruc
tors , at the exclusive school, allows
herself to be freely quoted to the ef
fect that President Roosevelt, an
gered at being passed on the road by
a horseback party of seminary girls,
1 spurred his steed to a gallop and over
took the young women at a narrow
: point in the road.
She asserts that one of the girls

lision between her stirrup.&nd part or

' further believes that Mr. Roosevelt
struck the young woman's horse with
l his riding crop as he went by, for the
animal plunged with fright and pain
Once past the seminary riding party
the-preeident is alleged to have turned
squarely about in his saddle and dellv
ered a short but savage lecture to the
young women for daring to pass him
on the road
The fact that President Roosevelt,
accompanied by Mrs. Roosevelt, went
riding on Thanksgiving day is easily
recollected here.
Miss Sisson, the seminary instruc
tor, says the president rode by herself
and three of the young, women., for
whom she was acting as chaperon at
a fierce gallop, and as he passed he
turned and said:
"You know. that you should not go
ahead of -jur party.'
Miss Sisson would not divulge the
names of the young , women, but said
that two ol them were daughters of
wealthy and.' influential men of Chi
cago and Texas. She asserted that
the president's action was Intended as
a rebuke for the young women an
herself because they had ridden past
