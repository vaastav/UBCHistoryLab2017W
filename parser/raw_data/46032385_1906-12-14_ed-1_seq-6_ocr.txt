'Hew to the Line, Let the Chips Fall Where They May"
No man who is financially connected with a corporation that is seeking privileges ought
act as a member of a political organization, because he can not represent his corporation and th
people at the same time. He can not serve the party while he is seeking to promote the financi
interests of the corporation with which he is connected.

River improvement will be a costly experi
ment as long as the money is spent by politi
cians on favorites instead of by skilled men on
the rivers.
Beware of false prophets," warns President
Baer of the coal trust, That's all very well,
but what hurts this country is the extortionate
profit demanded by Mr. Baer.
While pondering on what to buy for a
Christmas present do not forget the fact that a
year's subscription to The Commoner would be
appreciated by a lot of men and women.
There are enough bankers in the Ohio peni
tentiary to finance a prison newspaper, but unfor
tunately for the scheme there are no printers in
the penitentiary to do the mechanical work.
Some of the gentlemen who are applauding
President Roosevelt's income tax idea are the
same gentlemen who were fierce in their denuncia
tions of the "income taxers" a few years ago.
Despite the experience of Anna Gould the
chances are that the supply of titled scoundrels
will hold out just as long as there are heiresses
willing to exchange their millions for the tainted
titles.
"The condition of the finances of Pennsyl
vania is unprecedented!'1 -shouts the Harrisburg
Telegraph. We should think that a state able
to condone a graft of $9,000,000 must be in a
good way financially.
That portion of the president's message re
lating to labor may mean much or it may mean
little. No one knows just which, unless it be the
president, and he was careful to conceal the
meaning in a lot of words.
A French paper is discussing the duration of
a lightning flash. It lasts about as long as the
republican party's position on every question save
that of preserving the tariff for the benefit of the
men who pay the campaign expenses.
The statisticians of the government are able
to prove by figures that the cost of living has
not increased faster than the increase in wages,
but the average housewife is prepared to prove
the controversy by receipted bills and salary en
velopes. The statisticians will have to try another
tack.

THE PRIMARY PLEDGE
As this copy of The Commoner may bo read
by some one not familiar with the details of the
primary pledge plan, it is necessary to say that
according to the terms of this plan every demo
crat is asked to pledge himself to attend all of
the primaries of his party to be held between
now and the next democratic national convention
unless unavoidably prevented, and to secure a
clear, honest and straightforward declaration of
the party s position on every question upon which
the voters of the party desire to speak. Those
desiring to be enrolled can either write to The
Commoner approving the object of the organiza
tion and asking to have their names entered on
