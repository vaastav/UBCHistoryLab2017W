Washington, Dec. 14.—In the
eenate today the Postal Savings
Bank Bill was taken up as a special
order, with every indication that it
will receive favorable consideration
from a majority of the lawmakers
of the upper house. Senator Thom
as H. Carter, of Montana, who is in
charge of the measure, gives it as
his opinion that the bill will pass
the senate without opposition of any
serious kind. Both the president
and the postmaster general favor
the passage of the bill. The fate of
the measure in the house is prob
lematical, as Speaker Cannon is op
posed to it but it is believed that
the influence of President-elect
Taft will be sufficient to overcome
•the opposition of the speaker.
In regard to the chances of the
'bill passing the House, the Montana
senator said:
"During last session of congress
there were a good many republican
House members who were "either op
posed to the •bill or lukewarm in its
support. For the most. part these
men come from sections of the mid
dle west, where the bank guarantee
idea had taken hold.
"The republican national conven
tion at Chicago subsequently de
clared In favor of the Postal Savings
Bank, and the republican party went
to the country with that ns rne of
its Issues, defeating the democrats
who stood squarely for the guaran
tee of deposits. I have been relia
bly informed that many of the Mid
dle West (Republicans to whom I
lave referred, are now strongly in
favor of the postal savings banks.
They tell men that they want now
to put themselves in harmony witt
the party platform. I am sure that
a majority of House repuMirans arc
•now in favor of the bill and that it
will pass that body, once it is per
mitted to come up.
"Speaker Cannon hps been op
posed to postal savir^s banks, and
I assume, has not chsnged his po
sition. But I have obkling faith
his
desire to be fail and to reflect
I the will of the majority of the 1M:"
ing
members of the- Hous?. If it
can be shown him that a majority of
those members want to pass a pos
tal
savings bank bill, I believe that
be will .yield. At any rate, he will
proceed to put the bill through the
senate on that theory."
Senator Carter calls attention to
the fact
that there is a strong po­
litical rea»oa whittle ^oatal savings
*H'
'bank bill should be enacted into
law.
The republican paity is now com
mitted to it, as is the president-elect
William H. Taft, who spoke in de
fense of it many times during the
campaign. If the principle of postal
savings banks can be put into the
federal statutes, Senator Carter be
lieves that it will forever stop the
democratic demand for the guaranty
of bank deposits, and thus take away
from that party the strongest issue
it had in the so-called doubtful or
close states in the Middle West. In
those states William J. Bryan made
his campaign chiefly on the bank
guarantee issue, and if it should be
taken away from tirem by act of
congress, the democratic party would
have to turn to some other issue
four years hence. By taking deci
sive action at this session of congress
Senator Carter believes that the e
publican party would be playing
good politics, for the new law would
be in operation almost four years
before another presidential campaign
and the country would have ample
time to make a careful study and
adapt itself to it. Senator Carter
says there are already indications
that this is the view which the great
majority of members of both houses
will take of the matter during the
present session.
Theodore Junior Gets a Job.
Waterbury, Conn. Dec. 16.—Gov

RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION.
Aroused When Defamatory Remarks
About McKinley Were Made.
Macomb, 111., Dec. 1G.—Declaring
3't a meeting here last night, that
the late President McKinley was an
anarchist, that he turned more peo
ple loose to pray on society than any
other man in the world and that
•the assassination of McKinley was
all right, excepting that it did not
happen soon enough, the self-styled
"Divine Healer" Schlatter only es
caped personal violence from a mob
here last night. Through the inter
vention of police officers, Schlatter
was escorted to the first train out
of town and was followed by a mob
of citizens threatening violence if he
did not leave at once.
Out of Receiver's Hands.
Slonx Falls, S. D., Dec. 14.—The
Westinghouse Electric and Manu
facturing Company in the district of
South Dakota has been taken from
the hands of receivers in federal
court. The company went into the
receivers' hands last fall during the
panic, and returning prosperity has
placed it beyond danger. The well

mica mines, mills and machinery
in Custer county, S. D., which ac
counts for the action in this dis
trict.
BYRAN WILL NOT DICTATE.
Satisfied to Act in Advisory Capacity
in Nebraska.
Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 14.—That
William J. Bryan will not attempt
to dictate the action of the Nebras
ka legislature this winter but will
act only in an advisory capacity is
indicated by a statement made pub
lic here today.
"I have only one interest in the
legislature," said Mr. Bryan, "and
that is to see that every pledge in
our platform is carried out." He
said that he would spend a part of
his winters in Texas hereafter, but
that he had no intention of chang
ing his residence.

A SPECIAL
MESSAGE
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT TAKES
ANOTHER SHOT AT THE
BROWNSVILLE AFFAIR.
STANDS FIRM ON THE POSITION
HE HAS IXJRMERLY TAKEN
IN THE MATTER.
Washington, Dec. 14.—The presi
dent today sent a special message
to congress, inclosing a letter from
the secretary of war transmitting a
report of the investigation made by
Herbert J. Browne, employed by the
department in conjunction with Capt.
W. G. Baldwin to investigate the
Brownsville shooting affair of Aug
ust 13 and 14, 1906. Browne's re
port says "Ex-private Boyd Conyors,
of Co, B., 25th Inf., now of Monroe,
Ga, told William Lawson, detective,
that he and three or four others were
leaders in the Brownsville raid."
The president says in part, "This re
port enables us to fix with tolerable
definiteness at least some of the
criminals who took the lead in the
murderous shooting of private citi
zens of Brownsville and establishes
clearly the fact that colored soldiers
did the shooting The investigation
has gone far enough to enable us to
detail all the facts and we will pro
ved with it I believe we can af
'nrd to reinstate any of these men
who now truthfully tell what hap
pened, giving all the aid they can to
1x the responsibility upon those who
ire really guilty, show that they
themselves had no guilty knowledge
beforehand and were in no way Im
plicated in the affair, save by hav
ing knowledge of it afterwards and
failing and refusing to divulge it."
In addressing the senate, Senator
Foraker said that during the sum
mer letters had oeen coming to him
from discharged soldiers of the 25th
Inf, declaring that detectives were
constantly engaging them in con
versation The senator spoke of
the activities of the detectives as out
lined by his correspondents, saying
that in many cases they went so far
as to take up their dwelling with
discharged soldiers for the purpose
of securing their confidence and spie
ing upon their movements. He ap
proved the ferreting out of the facts
but declared there was a right way
to do it The senator took the floor
as soon as the president's message
and accompanying documents had
been read. He read a letter from
Boyd Conyors, a discharged soldier,
who is alleged to have made a con
fession to detective Lawson In his
letter he speaks of the visit of Law
son to Monroe, Ga., where Conyors
was living, and said that he had no
private talk with Lawson. Senator
Foraker closed his address by say
ing that the president's statement
that this espoinage against soldiers
of the 25th regiment was to be con
tinued_ was additional reason for
some prompt action by the senate.
TOPOGRAPHIC WORK.
Of the United States Geological
Survey in South Dakota.
The United States Geological Sur
vey has been engaged since its or
ganization in making a topographic
map of the United States, and the
systematic examination of the geol
ogy and waters of South Dakota
have been begun and are being ex
tended under Federal appropriations.
The purpose of these investigations
is to promote a knowledge of the
state and to aid in the development
of its resources.
A topographic map is essential as
a basis for the representation of the
nature and resources of the state,
and it is alrfiost essential to the de
velopment of the country.
South Dakota has thousands of
acres of arid land, now bdaring crops
of sage brush that only need water
to transform them into productive
agricultural lands it also has thous
ands of acres of timber land that
need intelligent administration to
protect them for future generations,
•but in order to accomplish these
ends topographic maps are abso
lutely necessary to show the location
of such areas.
For the development of the min
ing interests of the state it is es
sential to have good maps of the
mountain regions on which the pros
pector may locate his claim and
fearn the distance of the same from
railroads, and where power may be
developed for the treatment of ore.
The question of the storage of
the water supply of South Dakota is
becoming a more Important one ev
ery year, and in order to study this
problem to the best advantage topo
graphic maps of large areas should
be made in order to determine the
fall of streams, show where reser
voires may be constructed, and to
indicate points where power may be
developed and their distance from
points of utilization.
In this connection, for the devel
opment of power, as well as for ir
rigation purposes, it is necessary
that all streams be gauged in order
'o find out the amount of water
that can. be depended upon and
secure reliable data it is necessary
that these gating# .be extended over

a series of years. This part of the
work is in charge of the Water Re
sources Branch of the U. S. Geolog
ical Survey, and is prosecuted as
rapidly as small appropriations will
permit.
A topographic map also shows,
without the necessity of prelimin
ary surveys, the most feasible
grades and routes for projecting now
railroads. New Roads may be laid
out accurately with a small amount
of work. The traveling men and the
automobilists are glad to have these
maps, as they show the most direct
and safest routes from town to town
without inquiry.
In fact, today the first essential
of any enterprise is a topographic
map, whether it bo the construction
of railroads, the irrigation of arid
lands, the building of highways, the
storage of water, lumbering or min
ing.
In order to make clear the scope
of the topographic maps of the I). S.
Geological Survey the various items
that enter into their composition are
enumerated. They are printed in
three colors. In black is shown the
culture, which Includes buildings,
trails, maps, railroads, county and
state boundaries, section and town
ship lines where they exist, bench
marks, triangulation stations and
mines, as well as all lettering. In
blue are shown the drainage feat
ures, such as streams, lakes, rivers,
canals and glaciers. The hill and
mountain features, or elevations,
are shown by means of contour lines
in brown. The contour intervals
varies with the scale of the map and
the relief of thie country—where
they are close together the country
is steep where further apart, gently
rolling, etc. and where none exists
the country is practically flat.
The areas selected for survey are
defined by lines of longitude and
latitude and are called quadrangles,
which are named after the most
prominent city or natural feature on
the same.
As permanent monuments copper
bolts or brass tablets, marking the
exact geodetic positions, of primary
triangulation points, are left at the
most conspicuous points throughout
the state where surveys are in pro
gress. These monuments serve as a
base for all other government, pri
vate and •cadeslral surveys. There
are also established permanent
bench marks bearing on tliem in
figures the elevation above the mean
sea level. These serve
as
a datum
for future spirit level work, for en
gineering investigations and for
such public works as canals, rail
roads and other public and private
surveys.
The making of a complete topo
graphic map of South Dakota was
begun by the U. S. Geological Sur
vey in 1S91, and since that time
about 17,SI 4 square miles have
been surveyed, or approximately 23
per cent of the area of the state,
which is 77,050 square miles. The
quadrangles covering this area
which have Wen or are in the course
of publication are the Ellendale,
Columbia, Nortliville, Alierdeen,
'Redfield, Byron. Huron, DeSmet,
Mitchell, Alexandria, Olivet, Parker,
Canton, Elk Point, Belle Fourche,
Redwator, St. Onge, Willow Creek,
Vale, Deadwood, Speariish, Sturgis,
Rapid, Harney Peak, llermosa, Edge
mont and Oelrichs.
These maps may be obtained from
the U. S. Geological Survey at Wash
ington, D. C., at tire nominal price of
five cents per copy, or $3.00 per
hundred

THE PANAMA
CANAL DEAL
CAME IN FOR SPECIAL MESSAGE
1ROM PRESIDENT ltOOSE-
VELT TO CONGRESS.
READING OF MESSAGE CALLED
FORTH LAUGHTER AND
MERRIMENT IN SENATE.
Washington Dec. 15.—President
Roosevelt today sent to the senate
a statement concerning the purchase
ef the Panama canal property by
the United States government, de
nouncing in strong language the
charges that there was anything
wrong in the acquisition of the
property. Alter pointing out the
mistakes and alleged misrepresenta
tions on the part of the authors of
the canal stories, the president con
tinues: "The real offender is Jos.
Pulitzer, editor and proprietor of
the New York World. While the
criminal offense which Pulitzer has
been guilty of is in the form of libel
upon individuals yet great injury
has been done in the blackening of
the good name of the Amarican peo
ple. It should not be left for pri
vate citizens to sue Pulitzer for libel
but lie should be prosecuted for libel
by the government, authorities. It
is therefore a high national duty to
bring to justice as the villilier of
the American people, this man who
wantonly, wickedly and without the
shadow of justification seeks to
blacken the character of reputable
private citizens and to convict his
government in the eyes of the civil
ized world of wrong doing of the
basest nnd foulest kind. He has
not one shadow of justification of
any sort for the charges he has
made.
The attorney general lias under
consideration a form in which pro
ceedings against Pulitzer shall be
brought."
The president refers to various
papers which he transmits with ills
message. In explaining the method
of concluding the purchase of the
Panama canal property the presi
dent takes upon himself the respon
sibility for all that was done to
carry out the will of congress. The
action of the government, he says,
was wholly uninfluenced by any
question of who were or were not
stockholders either in the new or
the old company.
Repeated peals of laughter greet
ed the reading of the opening para
graph of the message in the senate.
As the secretary read the state
ment that the charges were false in
every particular Senator Bailey
laughed outright and other senators
on both sides of the chamber joined
him. When the reader reached the
statement that the statements in the
newspapers, which ho mentioned,
would not be believed, there was
general merriment. There was only
a small number of senators present
when the reading was begun and
it was hurried through. The papers
accompanying the message were not
read. The message received greater
attention in the house.
In the senate. Senator Foraker
endeavored to have a resolution
adopted calling on the secretary of
war for detailed information con
cerning men empoyed,, instructions
given and expenses incurred by de
fectives in the Brownsville affair.
Senator Warren objected to Imme
diate consideration of the resolution
and it will come up for consideration
tomorrow.
The postal savings bank was the
subject of speeches by Senators Car
ter and Depew, both of whom ad
vocated the measure. The bill was
made an order of unfinished busi
ness.
Upon motion of Senator Fulton,
the 'omnibus bill will be taken up
for consideration by the senate on
January sixth.
Washington, Dec. 15.—The hopes
of the so-called insnrgents in the
house for revision of the rules of
that body were dispelled for the
time being at least when Congress
man Gardner, of Mass., today failed
to obtain the adoption of an amend
ed resolution calling for the appoint
ment of a committee with the right
to consider the subject and report
to congress whatever they deem
necessary. A substantial majority
of tire house voted t.o take away
from the committee on foreign af
fairs the consideration of a resolu
tion which in its original form sim
ply called for information from the
secretary of state regarding what
the British house of commons has
done in that regard. The ruling of
the speaker was that the amend
ment of Mr. Gardner's changed the
character of the resolution in such
a way as to not make it privileged.
The speaker was sustained and the
resolution laid upon the table.
After passing some bills relatlns
to the district of Columbia the re
mainder of the day was taken up
with the bill to revise the penal
laws of the United States, which was
considered at some length at the
last session.

New York, Dec. 16.—The World
in the course of Its answer to Presl-
ftVi
A1-:S.
aaafe-
dent Roosevelt's reference to thit
paper In his special message to con
grofs. this morning says:
"Mr. Roosevelt is mistaken. He
cannot muzzle the World. While no
amount ct 'billingsgate' on his part
can alter ou' determination to treat
him with judicial impartiality wt
lepeat viift we have already said
that congress unhesitatingly should
make a thorough Investigation of
the whole Panama transaction in
order thai the full trath may be
known to the American people. In
his message he does not state cor
rectly von so simple a matter as the
pretended causes of his grievance.
"The World has never said or
charged that Charles P. Piatt or
Douglas Robinson made any profits
whatever. Taft denied that he was
concerned in the transaction in any
way. which denial the World pub
lished and accepted. It would be
entirely glad to print Robinson's
denial had it succedded in obtain
ing one from him as it frequently
attempted to do. No other living
man ever so grossly libeled the
United Stales, as the presi
dent, who besmirches congress,
bulldozes judges, assails the
integrity of the courts, slanders pri
vate citizens and who lias shown
himself the most reckless and un
scrupulous demagogue whom the
American people have ever trusted
with great power and authority."

HONOR NEW LEGISLATORS.
Banquet. Will be Tendered Hills
Representatives Thiis Evening.
Deadwood, S. D., Dec. 15.—The
banquet to be held In honor of tne
Black Hills members of the state
legislature, tendered under the aus
pices of the Young Men's Republi
can Club, of Deadwood, is meeting
with much enthusiasm and probably
more than one hundred will sit down
to the eleborate spread in the Frank
lin hotel at 7 o'clock Wednesday
even:!
ilg.
The occasion will be a forum for
the discussion of the legislative
needs of the Black Hills, and will
furnish the newly elected senators
and representatives an excellent op
portunity for having a heart-to
heart talk with a representative
groupe of their constituents. For
although the junior republicans
have undertaken the project, they
are asking and receiving the at
tendance and co-operation of the
older men of the party, and the law
makers have been invited without
regard to party lines. Those heard
from, indicate that these will be
present almost to a man, and the
ready acceptance of invitations 'by
the public, accompanied by the nec
essary dollar show that the idea is
well received. IL is a new idea here,
'but its benefits are manifold. It
will furnish the opportunity for leg
islators and constituents to become
better acquainted, will afford an
evening of much social and gastro
nomic pleasure and last but not
least, permit the solons to act with
greater confidence on many meas
ures that will demand their action
the coming months.
Among subjects likely to be dis
cussed will be the question of In
creasing the in umber of judges of
the supreme court, game laws, the
herd law, changes in the primary
law, and any others which anyone
present cares to call up.
Jury Disagreed in Bank Case.
Waynesburg, Pa., Dec. 14.—The

to the discussion of the president's
course in placing strictures on con

thing to help him out. One mes
sage is from Mike Geary, a promU
nent Denver political leader, who
says he is surprised to hear of the
predicament into which Johnson has
gotten himself and believes there
must be some mistake as the sus
pected man always bore a good rep
utation iim Denver. Another tele
gram is from Thomas W. Hyder, al
derman of the third ward In Den
ver, who says that any courtesies
which the sheriff may foe able to ex
tend to Jerry Johnson, will be ap
preciated.

as J. H. Lange and wife, but per
sistently refuses to give any Infor
mation about herself. When the
