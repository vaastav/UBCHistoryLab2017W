BROWNVILLE UNION SCHOOL.
We have been promising ourself the
honor for months, of making a visit
through the Brownville Union School
but have been prevented by some
cause or other, from time to time.
This week we briefly visited each
room in the building, and acknowl
edge to great surprise and entire satis
faction. The High School Department is in
charge of Prof. Rich, assisted by Miss
Pauline Davidson. In this Depart
ment are taught Algebra, Geometry,
Trigonometry, Philosophy, History,
and other ordinary branches. Forty
seven scholars are in attendance in
tbe High School.
The Grammar Department Is in
charge of Miss Decia Johnson, where
there are forty-eight scholars in attend
ance. The ordinary branches of this
grade are taught in this department.
The Intermediate Department is
taught by Miss Emma Hales, having
an attendance of forty-five scholars.
Miss Lillie MeXaughton is teacher
of the Second Primary Department,
where sixty-three scholars are in at
tendance. Tiierirw rranar, -I--- " I
presided over by Mrs. tannie F-bnght,
whose family

We cannot, in justice, particularize

to say, we found each Teacher in each
mony ami perfect accord can be found i

teachers. The .ehoiar, too, are mod-!

The 'advancements made and being
made in the art of teaching is truiv
wonderful. We well remember when :
in boyhood days we attended school, y
and how different from now. Then
the bcbolar entered the school room
acting and feeling more like a crimin
al thau a "happy school child."
Frowns, scolds and thumps were look
ed for from every direction ; birch
rods were suspended by the dozen
from the walls, as a "terror to evil do
ers." Not a kind word from the
"school masters." He never put him
self on a footing with his scholars ;
not a bit of it. Children dreaded him ;
would as soon spend the school hours
in prison as with him. It was a mys
tery how they learned anything un
der the circumstances. How differ-
ent now. Children are eager for
school; are on hand at the ringing of
the first bell; anxious to see and greet
the teacher; all smiles and bows. Tbe
school room is a pleasant resort; all
like to be there. When the bell taps
for recess the Teacher is "one among
the children." During school hours
all is calm and pleasant. The schol
ars are not afraid to ak a question,
and the teacher show delight in an
swering. The mode of teaching is
different. For instance, in the juven
ile department of our school, from
twenty to thirty children are taught
from the large cards and black boards
at the same time, and by object less
ons, so impressively as never to be
lost.
Years gone by, the scholar dare not
move a limb or change position with
out looking for a dreaded ruler hurled
from the "master's" seat. Now it is
a rule to change positions frequently ;
aiTord relief. Books are laid aside and
by military evolutions the whole
fechool is arranged in sections and cal
isthentic exercises indulged in, until
benumbed limbs are revived, and the
blood sent tingling throughout the
whole system. This now is a portion
of the regular and iudispensible ex
ercises of every well governed school
room.
Browuville has great reason to feel
proud of her school building ; of her
teachers, and her scholars.
The teachers are pleased to have
visitors. It does both teacher and
scholar good to visit the school. It
ehows that interest is felt in their be
half. Let us all visit the school of
teuer. "VV e understand that John Fitzger

B. FT. K. & P. It. R. WORK.
Not one in fifty of our citizens have
an idea of the extent of the work
done and in progress on the B. Ft. K.
& P. R. R. It will astonish any one
to take a drive out on the first ten
miles. About two hundred hands
and teams are making the "dirt fly"
in a style that will gratify the most
ardent and enthusiastic railroad man
in the land. At the mouth of Honey
Creek, near Thos. Heady's,.is quite a
village of good board shanties and
large wall-tents, that being headquar
ters. The grading on the first ten
miles is just now being finished up,
and in number one style. No slight
ed work passes Capt. Bedford's in
spection. This road will be first class
in all respects. The public may rest
assured of this. Thousands of ties
are being delivered along the .track,
gotten out from the timber along the
line through which the road passes.
No Cottonwood; all burr-oak, honey
locust, and other first class hard wood.
Work is also progressing on the first
of the second ten miles.
OUR NATIONAL DEBT FINANCES.

mire the Grant Administration, for
its efficiency in collecting reveue, and
paying off the national debt, they
who arc paying, are enquiring why

The country would be
none the worse, if the National debt
was never paid. The great object of
Legislatures, National and State,
should be to reduce taxation as much

as possible. Iteduce, or remove all
come tax ; avoid high tariffs; let
tariffs be barely sufhcient to pay the
expense of the government-tar
jor revenue only. 'Hie totates sinter
ing from the effects of the war, should
be relieved, and enabled to enter upon
a course of prosperity, that they may
be the better enabled to aid in carry
ing on the government, and thereby
the burthens of the masses be light
ened. The West requires the remov
al of restrictions on trade make buy
ing and selling as free as possible.

We notice that some of the Omaha
papers seem to think that those of us
who have had leason to complain of
the census returns, are disposed to
censure U. S. Marshal Hoile. We
speak for ourself; we have no such
' intention, we believe Mr. Moile to oe
i a careful and faithful officer. We felt
'that the returns as made for this
i . .. ,
county, were doing us a great wrong,
and as a journalist believed it our
duty to speak of it.
In an article on Chinamen, the
Corinne Jicporter says.- "John is per
haps the most useful of all animated
nuisances. He works for a song, and
starts the star of empire eastward to
push labor over the precipice of pov
erty." The population of Gage county by
the census retuihs is 1754. By an ef
fort of the people in that county, and
taking their own census, the popula
tion is found to be 2714. Can't we get
a new census of this county ?
What do our eastern folks who have
been told that Nebraska was a cold,
bleak hyperborian region, think of
farmers plowing right along until
December first; or musquitoes buz
zing around of nights up to that date.
Such are facts.

CIATION.
The Literary Association of this
city held its first meeting at a private
residence last evening, and with per
fect success. The attendance was
large, the number of ladies predomin
ating. The exercises consisted of
Headings, Essays, Kecitations, Ad
dresses, Vocal and Instrumental Mus
ic. The exercises were opened with
music on the Instrument, accompa
nied by the voices of Mrs. Graham,
Miss Johnson, Mr. Sykes and Capt.
Darrow.
The address of J. D. Calhoun, of
the Democrat, subject "Social Discip
line," was well written, pithy and to
the point, and was well received.
Miss Davidson read from the "Spec
tator" Addison's "Dissection of a
Beaux' Head," in line style and with
admirable e.fl'eel number one.
Dr. Kimberlin recited "Attitude,
Emotions and Expressions in Public
Speaking," with entire satisfaction to
his hearers.
The Essay of Mrs. Ebright, "Want
ed : a Million More," was the feature
of the evening. As a literary produc
tion, an essay or a lecture, It was a de
cided success, and was most admira
bly delivered. In fact it will rank
with the best efforts of the day. Such
was the admiration of the company
who listened to it, that a resolution
was unanimously adopted requesting
the author to deliver it in the regular
course of lectures before the Associa
tion this winter.
Capt. Darrow recited Saxe's "Cold
Water Man," delivering itiu most ex
cellent style.
Mr. Davis, in a very happy manner,
delivered his "Valedictorj," and es
corted the newly elected President to
the Chair.
After an agreeable social chat of a
half hour the company dispersed. The
Executive Committee will arrange
and announce a programme for tbe
next meeting.
The newly elected officers are :
De Forest Porter, President.
Mrs. Capt. Bedford, Vice Presi
dent. J. H. Bito.VDY, Secretary and Treas
urer. Mrs. Ebright, Capt. Darrow, Mr.
Wilcox, Executive Committee.
The area of our organized territo
ries in the United States, including
Alaska, is greater than all the States
which have been admitted into the
Union before. There are nearly 1,
000,000,000 acres of land in these ter
ritories, and not over 500,000 of white
inhabitants. In natural resources
this territorial domain is .richer than
the area included in the States. The
latter contain say 40,000,000 inhabi
tants. But here is a country waiting
for 40,0CO,000 settlers, and even these
would hardly be near enough for
neighborhood purposes. Railroads
will open up the country and bring in
population.
The Postmaster General though
favorable to the Postal Telegraph sys
tem does not consider it judicious to
adopt the experiment at present, and
will not recommend, as it has been
rumored he would, the purchase of
any of the telegraph lines for the pur
pose of establishing a telegraph sys
tem under Government control.
Bismarck has again been inter

BROWNVIIi&E 1ITERARY
THE CENSUS OF NEBRASKA LET
TER FROM MARSHAL HOILE'
Editor State Journal. Some
time since the following article ap
peared in the Journal, to-wit :
The article referred to is one from
the State Journal, headed "Revision
of the Census," and published in the
Advertiser a few days ago.
"Let me inform you, and the read
ers of the Journal, that I have never
furnished, for publication, a state
ment of the census returns of any
county, except Douglas county. Nor
has there ever been an authorized or
official statement published showing
a complete return of the census exhib
its of any county in the State.
Through the anxiety of newspaper
men to obtain and publish news, un
authorized statements, how obtained
I know not, have been made pretend
ing to show the population of several
of the counties. For instance, a.pub
lished statement gives to Gage coun
ty a population of 1,745, when the cen
sus returns in my office, show a.pppu
lation in Gage county of 8,396. And
so Dakota, in a published statement,
is reported to have a population of
but 1,815, when the returns show a
population in that county of 2,040.
Another instance is the one of Jeffer-
son county. A published statement
shows a population of but 73S, when
the records show a population of 2,-
441. I am not responsible for a single
one of the above errors.
Similar statements have been made
and in a similar manner, in regard to
the numberof farms, and the amount
of farm products.
I could easily occupy a large por
tion of my time, in correcting these
mis-statements, did I care to do so.
But I choose rather to wait till I can
make a full and complete report,
which report I .am endeavoring to
have as near correct as possible; and
to this end I have not relied upon
newspaper reports, nor hearsay state
ments. I have called to my aid those
whom I supposed to be the best men
I could find to do the work, usually
selecting them from the locality where
the work was -to be done, believing
that by so doing; in addition to the
oath of office which they had taken,
they would be stimulated by a desire
to advance the interests of such local
ity, and do their work faithfully.
Neither have I relied upon their oath
of office, and interest, but when not
personally acquainted with the men
to be employed, before I would en
trust them with the business, I have
required and obtained their endorse
ment by the leading, reliable citizens
in the county where they reside.
It was impossible that I should do
the entire amount of work myself,
without entirely neglecting all the
other duties of my otlice. I have giv
en the supervision of the whole mat
ter my personal attention. If errors
there are, and I doubt not there be
many, I can assure you they do not
occur through any fault of mine that
I could possibly avoid.
The towns, cities and country every
where are disappointed with -results,
and this clamor against my official
acts, that you seek to give form b' en
dorsement and publication, is not un
like that which is heard from every
part of the United States. Be assur
ed, however, that when the work is
done, and that will be within the
time directed by the Department at
Washington, that my report will be
based upon the sworn statements of
the officers appointed to do the work,
and until contradicted and sworn to
be in fault, by similar proof, I shall
regard such report as very nearly cor
rect. Very Respectfully,
J. T. Hoile,
U. S. Marshal.
We cheerfully give place to the
above, whiclrwe clip from the State
Journal. As to the reports obtained
by newspaper men, we have only to
say for ourself that we obtained our
information from a clerk in Marshal
Hoile's office, and supposed it correct,
and authorized.
GOVERNMENT RECEIPTS.
It is estimated that the receipts in
each Stale and Territory from inter
nal taxation after the act of July 14,
1870, goes into efU'tc, will be as fol

4,255; total, $111. 41S.034. The fore
going table exhibits tho amount
which it is estimated will be annual
ly realized from all sources of internal
revenue except stamps.
The total amount is $111,418,034,
Estimating additional receipts from
stamps at $15,000,000, there will be o
total of $120,41S,000. The table is ar
ranged according to the revenue val
ue of the States rspectively. The
tolal of this estimate may be increas
ed yearly in proportion to the increase
of population, business and wealth,
but probably not to exceed five per
cent.
From September 1867, to February
2S, 1S69, eighteen months, the re
ceipts from the several general
sources of revenue, were $241,S20,765,
and from March 1st 1869, to August
31, 1S70, eighteen months, $291,492,
S27. The gross receipts from all
sources of internal revenue for the
first eighteen months of the late ad
ministration, were increased to the
amount of $49,072,061,09, and taking
the same sources of revenue.
the excess during the same period of
comparison in favor of the present
administration amounts to the sum
of $101 ,888,077,13. St. Joseph Union.

THE "AGER."
Once upon an evening bleary,
While I Bat me dreaming dreary.
In the sunshine, thinking o'er
Tilings that passed in days of yore;
While I nodded, nearly sleeping.
Gently came In something creeping,
Creeping upward from tho floor.
" 'TIS a cooling breeze," I muttered,
"From the regions 'neoth the floor ;
Only this, and nothing more."
Ah ! distinctly I rememberj
It was In that wet September,
When the earth and every member
Of creation that I bore.
Had for weeks and months been soaking
In the meanest, most provoking
Foggy rain that, without joking.
We had ever seen before.
So I knew it must be very
Cold and damp beneath the floor
Very cold beneath the floor.
So I sat mo, nearly napping,
In the sunshine, stretching, gaping.
And a feeling quite delighted
With tho breeze from 'neath tho floor,
Till I felt me growing colder.
And thestretching waxing bolder, -'
And myself now iccllng older.
Older than I felt before.
Feeling that my joints were stiffer
. Than they were In days of yore
Stiffer than they'd been before. "
All along my back the creeping
Soon gave place to rushing, leaping,
As if countless frozen demons
Had concluded to explore
All the cavities tho varmints
'Twixt me and my nether garments.
Through my boots into tho floor;
Then I found myself a-Bhaking
Gently shaking more and more
Every moment more and more.
'Twos the Ague, and It shook me
Into heavy clothes, and took mo
Shaking to the kitchen every
Tlace where there was waimth In store.
Shaking till the China rattled.
Shaking till my molars chattered ;
Shaking, and with all my warming,
Feeling colder than befoce;
Shaking till It had exhausted
All its powers to shake mo more
Till it could not sha'xe me more.
Then It rested till the morrow,
When it came with all tho horror
That it had the face to borrow,
Shaking, shaking as before,
And from that day in September
Day which I shall long remember
It has mndcdlurnnl visits;
Shaking, shaking, oil ! so sore!
Shaking off my boots, and shaking
Me to bed, if nothing more;
Fully this, If nothing more.
And to-day the swallows flitting
Round my cottage see me sitting
Moodily within in the sunshine
Just inside my silent door.
Waiting for the Ague, seeming
Like a man forever dreaming,
And the sunlight on me streaming,
Sheds no shaddows on the floor.
For 1 am too thin and sallow
To ma ks shadows on the floor.
Nary shadow any more!

COMPLIMENTARY.
As we noticed a week ago, our Te
cumseh neighbor. G. W. Fairbrother,
of the Chieftain, spent a day or two
in visiting our city. On his return to
his sanctum, he writes the following
complimeiuary notice of Brownville
and surroundings ,v and also of our
near neighbor, Nemaha City:
"On our recent visit to Nemaha
county we took some pains to notice
what the city of Brownville is doing
ty way of improvements, and were
very agreeably surprised to wituess
the rapidity of the growth of that
young cit3'. The buildings residen
ces and business Houses which are
being put up, and have been put up
during the season now closinc:, are. as
a general thing, of a permanent char
acter, and display more than usual
taste. Business men of all cmsses
seem to have settled upon the conclu
sion that they are well satisfied with
Brownville, and that her prospects for
prosperity are well denned, and that
she is destined to count a population
and wealth second to no city in Ne
braska. We believe there hope is
well founded. We cannot enumerate
the many fine buildingsand necessary
and valuable public improvements
which we noticed in our perambula
tions through the city, and shall only
make special remark in regard to the
splendid building now being finished
up by the State Bank company, and
with special regard to fitness for their
business house. It is a two story
brick building, about22x60 feet, square
front glass below and solid stoneand
brick finish above, and shows as well
as any business bouse front in the
State. The inside on the lower floor
will be the business room, a private
room, and vault. The counter will be
circular, with a crowning of Italian
marble. Asa building for the purpose
for which it is designed, there is not a
better or more neatly finished one in
the State, and is a credit to Brown
ville, to the architects who made it,
and to theenterprisinggentlemen who
designed itand own it. Oflicersof the
State Bank of Nebraska are David
Reinick, President; Theodore Hill,
Vice-President; Geo. P. Eaton, Cash
ier. "We took a walk on the B. Ft. K.
& P. Railroad, and walked beyond the
first mile. We did not see the "iron
horse," but we saw where there has
been a vast deal of work done by way
of getting ready for his reception, and
if the weather should not be too se
vere this winter, those who visit
Brownville next spring, may see him
and hear the clatter of his iron hoofs
over the first eleven miles on his way
to Tecumseh and on, on westward.
"In company with our respected,
friend, S. M. Rich, Esq., we visited
the nourishing town of Nemaha City,
and spent a few hours with our old
friends of that place, whom we are
always pleased to meet. We found
one valuable improvement made this
fall, which speaks well for the people
of that town and precinct, and that
was a large brick school house. It is
a two story building, about 30x00 feet;
it will be well finished and furnished,
and calculated for a graded school.
"The people of Nemaha say that if
they cannot get a railroad, they can
have a good institution of learning;
and they are right, for there is not a
more naturally favored or beautiful
location in the State for such an in
stitution. But, though they have
missed getting the B. Ft. K. & P.
road, they do not give up the idea of
soon getting a railroad to carry away
the great grain crop3 of that rich ag
ricultural region. They still have
strong hope that ere long the Trunk
road will be built. We do not only
hope that this will be the case, but
we are confident it will be so. That
road is needed and it will pay, and
will therefore be built. If Joy does
not build it, some one else will y for
whenever and wherever railroads will
pay, railroads will be built."

An Esthetic View of Swearing.
One of the young ladies in a Brook
Farm story in the Overland Montlily
Bays; "There is profane swearing,,
where the heart is filled with vindic-i
tive passion with malice; but most
of the swearing indulged in by young
people and uncultivated people is only
so much emphasis to back up their
sentences with. It shows that those
who indulge in it are wanting in, in
telligent respect for their own state
ments; or are doubtful if they will be
accepted as true by those they ad
dress. I do not deny that it is ex
tremely bad taste; that it is vulgar
and disagreeable; and yeta great deal
of informal swearing is indulged in
by the reverent and kind hearted."
To which a sailor present responds :
"I am sure, Miss, it's not language,
that's so wicked ; it's tho way one
feels in the heart. I was thinking,,
all the time you were talking, of once
when I was at sea, leagues from land,
in the Pacific : and wo fell in with a
water-logged ship, with, nine starv
ing men on her, They hailed us, and
we hove to. Now, our captain was
one of your pious sort. Well, when
the mate with his hands on the ropes,
ready to lover the boat, heard the
captain's cold-blooded decision, 'Tell
them we can't take them ; we have
only provisions enough to take our
selves to port;' why, the mate swore
an oath I should not dare to repeat it
to you, Miss ; in a had cause, it were
enough to sink a ship and wishing
that he might be hung, beside, at the
yard arm, if he did not fetch those
poor souls on board. And down went
the boat, in spite of the saptain, and
on board they came ; and we all ar
rived safe and sound in port. Now.
Miss, I ask you, who swore the mate
or the captain ?"
Strange Phenomenon Three Acres of
Timber Land Suddenly Disappear
Below the Surface.
From the Port Jcrvls (N. Y. Gazette.
The inhabitants of the Basket Sta
tion, on the Delaware division of the
Erie Railway, were treated to a first
class sensation. About two miles
north of the place, three acres of land,
heavilytimbered with hemlock, sud
denly sank below the surface, disap
pearing in a manner similar to a load
of dirt when the bottom is let out of
the wagon. There was no apparent
cause, but it certainl3' has sunk to the
dept of about forty feet, leaving the
tops of the trees just visible above the
surface. The sinking was accompa
nied by a loud crash, which died away
in a dull rumble, heard at a consider
able distance. The trees are standing
in their natural positions, having ev
idently experienced no particular in
jury in their descent.
It is usual, when such freaks of na
ture occur, for the sunken earth to be
immediately submerged by volumes
of water, but in this instance no such
phenomenon attends. The soil is of
a clayey nature, and the sides of the
chasm formed by the sinking present
a smooth and even appearance, as if a
huge spade had been thrust down, and
the earth thrown out.
The people at the Basket, and from
the surrounding country for miles,
visited the.scene of the phenomenon,
on Sunday, and viewed it with awe
and consternation. They don't like
to be close to where the bottom seems
to be dropping out of terrestrial
things.
Suit Against Hannibal and St. Joe
IXallronil Company.
A suit has been commenced in the
United States Circuit Court for tins'
district against the, Hannibal & St.
Joseph railroad company, and an in
junction, after argument, granted
thereon by Judge Treat in accordance
with an agreement upon which the
preferred stock was issued viz: That
in declaring dividends the comjianj'
are to divide, first, seven per cent to
the preferred, then the surplus re
maining, if any, equally between the
preferred and common stock. The
preferred stock amounts to $5,044,400,
and the common to $4,119,700. The
gross earnings of the road during the
past year were $3,340,254, and the
gross expenses to $3,071 ,S2G,8S. Not
a very good show for either class of
stockholders, especially for the com
mon. St. Louis Democrat.
How to Kill c. Town.
The Dubuque (Iowa), Herald, gives
the following receipe for knocking a
town stiff and dead : "If you wish
to kill a town, put up no more build
ings than you nre obliged to occupy
yourself. If you should accidently
have an empty building, and any one
should want to rent it, ask about
three or four times its value. Look at
every new comer with a scowl, and
start reports about them. Turn a cold
shoulder to every business man or
mechanic seeking a home with you.
Go abroad for your wares rather than
to purchase of j'our own merchants
and manufacturers at the same price.
Refuse to advertise, so that persons
abroad will not suppose that any bus
iness is being done in your place. A
prompt and close observation of these
rules will ruin any town in two years."
The" following advertisement

pear3 in a Cincinnati paper:

and dealer in furs, I am prepared to

tifications. The entire Prussian loss
in these actions was only seven offi
cers and a few hundred men, while

the steamer Robert Lowe, now en
gaged in repairing the cables. The
latter steamer was sent out to repair
the Atlantic cable of 1806, and the

A balloon, probably from Paris, was
seen late last evening over the Eng

to make a landing on oneof the Scilly
Islatids. A violent East wind .pre
vailed, and it was carried out to sea
and unquestionably lost in the Atlan
tic. About one-third of the town of Thi
onville was burned during the bom
bardment by the Prussians.
Advices are received of a battle be
tween the French, under Briand, and
the Prussians; at Etrepagay, in which
the Prussians were beaten with a se-'
vere loss. The French captured three
officers, a number of cannon and
horses, and a large quantity of small
arms.
