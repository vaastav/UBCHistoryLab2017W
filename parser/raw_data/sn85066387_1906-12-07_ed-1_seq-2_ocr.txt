Gila Passes All High Water Records
through train that crosses the river on
the Mar'copa and Phoenixybrtdge.
GOVERNMENT WORKS SAVED
Locally the greatest interest lies In
the RooseVelt storage dam being built
by the Government seventy miles above
Phoenix on Salt River to create the
largest artificial lake in the world. A
terrific flood came down Tuesday, but
fortunately the contractors were
warned and had their work in good
condition "to .withstand the strain. They
removed their machinery from the
canyon and damage will be confined
to less of time and injury to colter
dams which it will take some time to
repair. A big volume of water Is still
running today, but Is falling slowly.
. The work of beginning repairs to cof
ferdam wlttbe attempted tomorrow, it
is said, but* hey and the rock dam site,
according to telephone message this
evening, are still under water.
T7lth appalling- suddenness the Gila
River rose yesterday and swept down
from the mountains in which it takes
It rise in a turgid flood. The swift
melting of the snows in the ranges
of Southeastern Arizona combined with,
the numerous cloudbursts that have as
sailed the territory is given as the
reasons for the raise In the water.
It carried away a bridge on the Mari
<*opa and Phoenix and Salt River Val
ley Railway as if it had been made of
straw, flooding the low lying lands and
damaging the orchards and vineyards
that have been planted In the valley.
By the destruction of the bridge Phoe
nix is cut off from communication with
the Southern Pacific Railroad, though
the officials said yesterday that it
would take only a few days to restore
the railroad.
The greatest harm that the Gila does
when in flood Is when It joins the Colo
rado a little north of Tuma. The land
on both the Arizona and California
sides Is low and ;the Gila and the Colo
rado backwater fill the .depressions
and convert the country north of
Tuma into a huge lake.
To the north of Tuma and subject to
the overflow of the two streams is the
land on which the Government is build
ing its dam at a point called the La
guna Dam. and the question arises
whether this work will be damaged by
the Gila River joining the Colorado.
There are a sr-rles of elaborate levees
along the Gila to protect Tuma, and
whenever the river is In turbulent
mood large gangs are employed to
strengthen- the banks.
The railroad people are anxiously
\u25a0watching the progress of the Gila. In
past years It has swelled the volume In
the Colorado to dangerous proportions,
and - the effect this increased tide
may have on the protective works the
Southern Pacific has recently built
south of Tuma to restrain the Colorado
within Its proper channel is naturally
awaited with 111-coneealed fear.
The December and January floods
are among the w<Jrst on the Colorado
River, and though the railroad people
say they feel confident that the intake
where the water is taken to irrigate
Imperial Valley Is sufficiently strong
to withstand the onslaughts of the river
there is. of course, some anxiety.-
Both RandclrtKsatid Cory insisted that
the railroad should be left on f!ie
banks of the levee so that mater'iil
could be promptly rushed to any break I
and with such a vigilant man on hand j
as Engineer Cory the Southern Pacific j
Is inclined to the belief that should !
there be any accident to the newly
made levees they would be mended In
short. order and no great damage re r

whisper and the next one louder than any one with their fingers. Tou can
shade every note, you can play your accompaniments as they should be
played— soft and with a legato style, no matter whether In the bass o.r treble.
