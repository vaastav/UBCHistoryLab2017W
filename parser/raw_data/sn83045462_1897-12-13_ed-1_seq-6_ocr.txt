(examples to Re Avoided.
In some of the comment on the Haitian
episodic the action of Germany is held up
as worthy of American imitation. Every
government, it is urged, should be prompt
and encrge^c in looking after the welfare
of its citizens when appealed to from any
quarter of the globe where they may hap
pen to be. That policy, it is asserted, ad
hered to from an early day, is at the bot
tom of En*land's prestige among the pow
ers. Germany is copying England, and the
United States should copy Germany.
The proposition itself is eminently sound.
It affords no grounds for dispute. But it
cannot !>e said that the English record
which is founded on it is praiseworthy
without exception. England's sensitiveness
on the subject of abuse of her citizens is
much more easily aroused by a iittle than
by a great power. She does not bristle
with indignation every time one of her
citizens gets into trouble in a foreign
country. It depends very much upon the
particular country. And so it is proving
to be with Germany. Her course in such
matters seems to be regulated by the con
dition of the country where the complaint
is made. Helpless China is brought to
book with a vengeance, and little Haiti
is pushed up against the wall and forced
to apologize and pay smart money in a
jiffy. But Joes anybody believe that il
two German missionaries had been mur
dered by wil l tribes in Russia Germany
would have moved as she has done in the
case oi China, or that the arrest of a
German citizen in England would have
caused the appearance of German war
ships in the Thames?
The United States cannot afford to copy4
a bad example. She cannot afford to
adopt one policy for the weak and another
for the strong. She should not appear in
blustering mood in any part of the world.
Her citizens are entitled to her interest
and protection everywhere, and that may
be accorded them without undue haste or
violent assumptions thai they can never
in any circumstances be in the wrong.
American citizenship should stand abroad
fcr the best behavior; for the observance
of the laws applying wherever the citi
zen may be. When the citizen has met
that requirement and then has abuses to
complain or he need not fear that his
case will not be championed by his home
government. But the United States could
not commit a greater mistake than by
eml^rking on a policy of bullying small
or defenseless pov%*ers.
Mexican Kniliusia^m for >Ir, Bryan.
The enthusiasm with which the Mexican
people are greeting Mr. Bryan is well de
served. Mexico is not only a silver produc
ing country, but In actual practice con
ducts its business on the basis of silver
money, and Mr. Bryan just now is the
most eminent champion of silver as a
money metal in the world. He is well en
titled therefore to the consideration that is
being shown him by those whose interests j
he so conspicuously represents. This en
thusiasm. there is every reason to believe,
will continue during Mr. Bryan's stay in
the country. Wherever he may go the peo
ple will desire to give expression to their
appreciation of his services to the silver
cause.
But so far as Mr. Bryan is concerned, will
his journey yield much more than personal
gratification at a series of hearty personal
greetings? Receptions and hurried visits
here and there will fill up his time. Every
thing will be on dress-parade arrange
ments. and everybody in dress-parade hu
mor, in his honor. He will see the country
and the people In holiday attire, so to
speak, and if he returns home with a com
paratively rosy picture impressed upon his
mind it will be no wonder. When he left
the northwest after his stumping tour last
year he was persuaded that the entire sec
tion was aflame for him. The votes on
election day went by large majorities to
Mr. McKinley. Mr. Bryan had formed a
stumper's hurried and misleading estimate
of local sentiment. He is quite as likely
now to form a stumper's hurried and mis
leading estimate of conditions in Mexico.
A stumper sees everything through a dis
turbed medium.
The fact is that Mr. Bryan is not likely
to grow as a man of thought until after
public interest in his personal presence has
somewhat spent Itself. He has had no time
for rest or reflection since his nomination
for the Presidency eighteen months ago.
His campaign for that office was in every
Way so unusual that the liveliest interest in
ihe man was everywhere excited. His fol
lowers iH'came more attached to him in de
feat than they had shown themselves to be
when counting upon success, and he has
been trotting about in response to their
imitations pretty much ever since. How
much longer this will continue is a ques
tion. Mr. Bryan himself seems to enjoy
the experience. But while it continues the
conditions will not be favorable for either
investigation of problems or assimilation of
conclusions, and the country may expect
cnly entertaining variations on the theme
with which Mr. Bryan first attracted na
tional attention.
According to Mr. Bryan's financial the
ory. its realization tnrough his election
Is President would instantly double the
value of the millions of Mexico's silver
in th** markets of the world. Xo wonder
Mexico is glad to see him and makes
much of 11 im.
There is a threatening possibility that
Mr. Bt>an may capture the silver-pro
ducing vote of Mexico.
Six-Hay Bicycle Races.
New York has just passed through
aroth?r six-day bicycle race, has exper
ier.ced agonies of sympathy for the suffer
ers on the track and has hailed the winner
of the test of endurance with loud plaudits.
Now follows the inevitable outcry against
the brutality of these exhibitions. There
seems to be a particularly bitter feeling
among the people in the immediate vicinity
because of the large numixr of men who
w*re forced out of the race by the lively
pace, and l>ecause, too. of the extraordi
nary performance of the leaders. These
races are disgraceful and should be pro
hibited by law. They serve no useful pur
pose and accomplish many harmful results.
It is significant that the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen, the central organization of j
bicyclists in this country, is said to be con
templating action that u:ll prevent such ]
tcntests in the future, save without the
sanction of the league, which means a
practical black-list Irg of every participant. I
This step should be taken in the interest
of wheeling as a sport and a recreation.
Six-day matches of all kinds have been in
vrgue for many years. That period, from
Sunday to Sunday, has been chosen doubt
less because of its avoidance upon the day
generally recognized as a day of rest. Were
It not for the intervention of Sunday, and j
the danger that the element In the popula
tion that demands a measure of respect for
the day might enter a successful protest. It
Is safe to assume that In time the walking
matches, running matches, eating, fasting,
bicycling contests, or what not, would ere
new have been extended Into fortnight af
fairs. and Indeed there is no probable limit
to be placed upon the cupidity of-the mana
gers and the folly of the victims and the
patrons. In the case of the latter-day bi
cycling contests, the racers are sustained
during the long stretches of their extraordi
nary efTorts 4?y drugs. Cocaine, with its
wonderfully stimulating effect upon the
nerves and Its ultimately poisonous efTect
upon the muscles, is administered in large
Quantities and serves to keep the men at
work at a tremendous cost. If the matter
only affected the participants the public
would have little concern, for the men go
into these competitions well aware of their
tremendous requirements. But the moral
effect upon the people Is not safely to be
estimated. The argument of public demor
alization logically urged against prize-fight
ing. buil-flghting, chicken-fighting, rat-kill
ing. bear-baiting and other so-called "en
tertainmerts" for the delectation of the
public applies equally to a spectacle In
which human beings are tortured or are
permitted to torture themselves for a pal
try money prize. The entertainment af
forded by such a contest as that which has
just closed is meager save to those who
crave the sight of human suffering or en
durance. The element of racing is absent
for the casual spectator. The Interest Is
maintained only by virtue of the fact that
some one of the contestants may at any
time succumb to his sufferings, or may be
disabled by an accident. The whole affair
is a huge money-maker for the benefit of a
very few men. and the public pays the
price simply because It is thought to be
smart and up-to-date to patronize these
disgraceful spectacles. New York, how
ever, deserves little sympathy in her pres
ent spasm of virtue, for she neglected the
opportunity last year to put an end to the
six-day races. Nevertheless, It Is to be
hoped that the present effort to suppress
such races will succeed.

Xatlonail lloartl of Trade.
The National Hoard of Trade, which
meets today In this city for its annual ses
sion, receives its customary hearty wel
come from the citizens of Washington. The
board's excellent habit of coming to the
capital city for its deliberations has done
much to bring ether national organizations
to Washington for annual meeting pur
poses, and there are now several that never
consider the possibility of assembling else
where. There are good reasons for this
course. The presence here of Congress In
session is a material attraction for such a
body as the National Board of Trade,
which is formed to consider topics bearing
upon items of national legislation, and
whatever Influence it brings to bear upon
a question of public consequence must be
exerted mainly through the two legislative
houses. This body has a long and honor
able record. It is composed of representa
tives of trade organizations and commer
cial associations in every section of the
country, anil includes in its membership
the Washington Board of Trade. It is an
agency for active endeavor in behalf of
projects of national importance, a factor
of high potentiality for commercial de
velopment.
>? VlolntioiiM nf the Organic Act.
All propositions, of whatever nature, that
tend to infringe upon the basic principle of
the law of 187s establishing the relations
between the District of Columbia and the
geifc ral government, are to be discouraged
and disapproved. The "organic act" must
be maintained in its entirety, and the Dis
trict cannot afford at any time to yield in
the least in its insistence upon a full en
forcement of the statute In spirit and let
ter. There may be temptaliuns now and
then, when Congress halts before making
needful appropriations on the customary
half-and-half basis, for District officials
and citizens to urge that in order to secure
the objects in view the District assume all
the burden, notwithstanding the equities
that demand an equal division of the ex
pense. But not even the most vital necessi
ties should operate to the approval of these
suggestions by the Commissioners. There
is danger in yielding on little things. Keep
the law of 1S7H constantly In mind In every
department of the local government,
whether the police pension fund or any
other appropriation is in question.
Cats In the Appropriation!!.
The legislative appropriation bill, as first
framed and laid before the House, con
tains 0 material cut from the estimates
submitted, amounting to about $7<*i,u?JO,
and at the same time makes a reduction
of from the amounts appropriated
for the current fiscal year. Thus is indi
cated a policy of close calculation that is
intended to enable- the treasury to feel
bottom once more.' It ia now to be ex
pected that similar cuts will he made in
al! the bills that are amenable to this
process. The President sounded a note of
wtrnlng against extravagance in his mes
sage and the leaders of the republican side
cf the House have since joined with him
in an effort to restore the balance on the
treasury books to the right side of Che
account. The hope is that no material in
terest will suffer m this reduction of ex
penses. It i3 fortunate that the cheering
prospects of a prosperous year, both for
the country and the government, do not
tempt the framers of the budgets in the
lower house to flights of extravagance.
The manner in which New Yorkers be
come virtuously indignant concerning the
six-day bicycle race after it is all over
cannot fail to remind many people of the
sentiment created t<y the recent election In
that city.
One of the mcst uncomfortable things
that could happen to General Weyier would
be to find himself in a. position to personally
conduct the active antagonism to the United
States which he recommends.
? I ? ?
The attention which some of our poli
ticians devote to docks is calculated to give
the American eagle an occasional much
needed rest.
? ?
There- is very little discouragement in the
fact that the most vigorous objections to
the President's message come from abroad.
It is a scant but Just compliment to say
i that ex-<iueen Lllluokalanl's poetry is bet
ter than her politics.

A Rraaonaklr Delay.
Correspondent Pepper, in his latest letter
to The Star from Havana, seeks an answer
to the question that was propounded in
these columns last week, as to how long a
trial should be given to tne reform Program
of the Spanish government in Cuba. Mr.
Pepper seeks the solution by Interviewing
representatives of the various classes who
new combine to create what might be
termed the "situation" In the Island. He
shows that the planters and merchants of
Havana province have agreed generally
that the United States will not wait longer
than next May before taking active steps
toward Intervention. The rainy season
wlli come In May. and that month will
probably witness the close of the campaign
in the field. By that time, also, the auton
omy scheme will have demonstrated Its
failure, according to these people, who
have little faith In the reform program.
On the other hand, the official class, the
Spaniards now attempting to uphold the
propositions that come from Madrid, com
placently believe, or profess to believe, that
this country will do nothing for another
year, arguing that the same chain of cir
cumstances that enabled 8paln to prevent
Intervention last year will operate now to
keep the President and Congress from pre
cipitating a crisis. The ulta-Spaniah resi
dents of the capital refuse to believe that
the time for Intervention will ever come,
yet they denounce the United States bit
terly, and declare their readiness to go to
war, if need be, to protect the rights of
Spain. This attitude indicates their fear
that the day of international judgment Is
relatively near. The Insurgents themselves
and their ardent sympathizers seem to have
agreed upon February as the time when
action will be taken by this government In
default of genuine performances by Spain
in the line of reform. The American resi
dents hold diverse view?. From all these
estimates it is to be seen that Cuba and
even Spain looks for some action in the
way of intervention to stop the war. It Is
significant that there is little mention of
late of such action taking the form of a
recognition of tne belligerency of the insur
gents. The Cubans look forward confi
dently to an actual recognition of their in
dependence. In the light of this letter It
is apparent that while the "reasonable
time" of trial may be an indefinite ttrm,
and while the day of intervention may still
be a movable feast In the international
calendar, yet there are signs that this day
cannot forever be postponed and that even
the Spaniards look forward to the time
when, the patience of the United States
having been utterly exhausted, this govern
ment will take decisive action looking to
the settlement of the strife.
Mr. Grosvenor, in drawing civil service
distinctions, shows that his statesmanship
Is as finely adjustable as his mathematics.
Richard Croker seems disposed to remind
David B. Hill forcibly of the old motto, "to
the victors belong the spoils."
In viewing Germany's performance,
Spain's great regret is that President Sam
is not Cncle Sam.
Some of the news which comes from
Cuba appears to be not only "boiled down"
but sweetened.

SHOOTING STARS.
Art.
"I have heard," said the young woman

"It does," replied Senator Sorghum, "un

"I thought you said I would meet a great
traveler?" said the athletic young man who
had attended the explorer's reception.
"Isn't he here?" inquired the late-comer.
"I don't think so. I haven't seen any
century medals on anybody."
SsiKix-ity.
"Did jou do anything about that lettor

"Of course," replied the detective. "You
didn't think we would neglect an important

"What steps did you take?"
"We ran no risks of letting that fellow
fool us again. We sent the letter to an
expert to make sure that the handwriting
is his."
A Principle Deinoimtrated.
"I suppose that a six-day bicycle race
exemplifies the survival of the fittest," re
marked the oil-hand philosopher.
"Unquestionably," replied the practical
friend. "Those who have intelligence
enough to keep out of it are most likely to
live to an advanced age."
A Vindication.
When Uncle Jim was runnln', he promised
good an' strong
That it he got to Congress he would push
reform along.
He told us 'mid the cheerin' an' the tossin'
of our hats
How he'd make the poor man wealthy an'
denounce the plutocrats.
So we voted fur 'im early an' we voted fur
'im late,
'Cause we knowed that he was needed in
the councils of the great.
We reco'ulzed his talents, though the scof
fers stood an' sneered;
We waited fur results which re'ly tells, an'
never keered.
We saw as plain as day that jes' the turn
in' of his hand
Would count fur more than speeches in
a-runnin' of the land.
He took things calm an' easy, but the tide

As soon as he rlz up and made a motion to

An' now behold the dlffer'nce! All the mills

An' gold is comin' over in a ieapin", spark

We've wheat in superabundance an' a call

An' no one is denyin' that the praise is due

It's all because we went ahead an' 'lected

A Good Kxample fur America.
From the New i'ork Kvculng Post.
The following notice appears upon the
pla> bills of the St. James' Theater in Lon
don; "Mr. George Alexander would respect
fully request those ladles *ho frequent the
St. James' Theater intent on viewing the
performance to recollect the similar pur
pose in those who sit behind them. If,
therefore, every large hat were removed,
the lady ko doing would confer a great
benefit on her immediate nfelghbors." This
would be a good example for New York
managers to follow. Nothing Is more as
tonishing than the selfish indifference to
the rights of others constantly exhibited
in the best theaters here by women of good
social station, in outward seeming, in the
matter of their headgear. It is not only
the big hat that Is a nuisance, but all lofty
arrangements In ribbons and feathers.
Some of the most conspicuous offenders in
this respect are actresses, who, apparently,
cannot tear the idea of being less conspicu
cus on one side of the footlights than the
ether. At the same time, it should be ac
knowledged gratefully that many of the
fair sex now set a civilized example by
wearing low head-dresses or none at all.
The AricumentH Have Been Heard.
From the Chicago Tinies-IIei-ald.
The Senate should confirm the Hawaiian
annexation treaty at once. As the Presi
dent says, every consideration of dignity
and honor requires that action be taken.
The Senate should make haste to ratify
the treaty, thus insuring early attention to
such modification in the domestic laws of
Hawaii as may seem necessary. All the
arguments for and against annexation have
been heard,.Hjnd there Is no reason in keep
ing the matter longer In suspense.
A Repetition.
From the Hartford Courant.
Bonaparte and Wellington are again
matched against one another. Mr. Charles
J. Bonaparte is counsel for the "Baltimore.
American" in the libel suit which United
States Senator Wellington has brought
against the paper.
