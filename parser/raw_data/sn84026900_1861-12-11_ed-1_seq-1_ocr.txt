the State of South Caroline, as a teatiino'
nial of the high appreciation by his na,
tive State of his gallant conduct and distinguished
services on that memorable
occasion,
Mr. Buist offered the following :
Resolved, unanimously, That the Leg'
islature of South Carolina has learned
witti the deepest regret the annunciation
of the death of Gefi. B. E. Bee, who fell
on the 21st July, 18G1, at the battle of
Manassas; but that their sorrow for his
loss is tempered with their gratulation
that ho fell after the display of heroism
and daring almost unexampled, as showed
a noble spirit and brave soldier in the
service of his country on the field of battle
and in the hour of victory.
Resolved, unanimously. That a copy
of the foregoing preamble nnd resolution
be|(ransmited by the Clerks of the respective
Houses to tlio widow of the deceased,
as evidence of the deep regard
ami admiration of the Slate of South I
Carolina for (lie lamented and distinguish*
ed dead.
The resolutions were unanimously
adopted.
A message was received from the Sen.
ate, proposing to go into a ballot for one
Senator, on Tuesday next, at 1 o'clock.
A message of concurrence was sent.
Mr. Aldricb proposed a message to the

SPECIAL OUI)EH.
Resolutions in regard to the salt in the
Slate.
Mr. Ulack stated fully and explicitly his
reasons for the resolution, its expediency |
and its necessity. The planters were |
needing salt for their winter provisions. |
Other States had adopted this resolution, 1
and it did not become South Carolina to '
)e backward on this occasion. Georgia s
and North Carolina have bothjidopted f
.his resolution. The agent of a railroad f
n Georgia went to Chester and bought ?
alt at $12 a sack, and then ho went over '
0 North Carolina and bought it at #5 a
acTf, and the reason for this difference c
onsists in the resolution of the North si
* a i r\ a T orrielul nrn It in
r.nviMii* Mv^ioinuiiu IV id nilllUtb BU1UI
utely necessary thai the salt should he
eized, for the planters can get none for n
heir next crops, and for that reason can c
>ut up no meat. c
Mr. Yeadon said that the Constitution
,vna against this, for it forbade confisca [
ion of property. i
Mr. Black said that the Constitution (
did not mention salt; tliat, in 1830, tiie
Legislature caused the impressment of all
kinds of property into the public service.
But he was opposed at this time to seize
anything hut salt ; for there was no necessity
for this now, nor did he desire to
inaugurate such a policy.
Mr. Thompson said that this resolution
would not meet the difliculiy. I
Mr. Duryoa said that he held that this 1
resolution was not against the Constitution,
but lie w-as opposed to hasty legis
lation, and he therefore proposed the re- (
Terence of the resolution to the Commit. (
Lee on Commerce and Manufactures, so <
that they might be presented in a more I
satisfactory form. 1
Mr. Macfarlan stated that he would '
rote against the whole affair, because it
was unconstitutional.
The resolution was referred.

The Federal Department Reports.
Manassas, Nov. 29.?The New York
Tribune say a that tl.e reports of the Secretaries
rapidly approach completion.?
The great interest which the war will
give to that of the Secretary of War
will be heightened by Cameron's distinct
avowal of bis nolicv of nlacinrr arms in
the hands of slaves who are willing to
use them for the cause of the Union.?
lie will support this by argument and
historical references ; ntid to show that
his leading position upon this vital question
has been deliberately and strongly
taken, and ns a foretaste of the administration
hereafter of the War Department
until the close of the rebellion, the
public will learn with interest that Mr.
Cameron will appeal to Congress and to
the Governors of tho States for authority
to hind the Government to practice the
closest economy, and to demand accountability
from every subordinate in tho
War Hureau and the army in the tield.
Knormout as the war is and will be, it
will not be pcimitted to bankrupt the
Government or the people. Mr Cameron's
report will also probably contain recommendations
that will go far to abolish
the distil ction between the militia and
the volunteers. Among these will be the
repeal of the regulation which confers
rank on the regular officer over the vol
unteer of the same grade, leaving it to
be determined by seniority, according to
late of commission.
f*?cretary Chase will recommend a
leeesnarilv large increase of the revenue
luties. The necessities of the Treasury
luring the war will require the tariff to
>e ho shaped as to produce the greatest
)o?sible amount of income. A largo inci
hntul protection to American manufac
urea will of course he the consequence.
Upon the vital question of war, Secretary
Jhase will fully develop the theory that
davea in rehul Slates should be employed
to raise cotton, sugar, rice, ami tobacco,
for Government account. This policy has
already been established by Cameron in
regard to ungathered and ungiuned Sea
Island cotton iu Beaufort. The nation
will heartily approve the commendation
of Chase to Congress an a wiser disposilion
of slaves than to leave them in the
rear of the army, roaming at large, pillaging
and marauding. It is a new form of
emancipation, hut an effective one.
Of the other reports nothing positive
is known, nor of the President's message.
The statistical portions of the reports are
now in the hands of the printers.

Vi hat Secretary Chase says.
Washington, Nuv. 18.
Secretary Chase returned yesterday.?
In addressing (lie bankers at New York
on Saturday, be said that the Govern*
mei.t saw their way clearly to quell the
rebellion ; that they had information
which warrants them in saying that the
public would soon hear glad tidings of
success, more startling and more effective
in their results than that from Port Royal
and the West ; that neither the Government
nor Gen. McClollan ever had (he
least idea of placing the army in winter
quarters, but, on the contrary, the military
plana all contemplate regular, systematic,
and energetic activity in pushing
forward upon the rebels as prudence aud
judgment dictate ; that the Government
bad ample funds to supply every liability
until the 1st of February.
Rev. C. 11. Betta, Chaplain, writes from
Pocolaligo :

I do not regret it now except 011 their

clever. I stood against the tide and had
the management the better in consequence.
Their confidence was extreme that they
could drive us away. They fought bravely,
and the rifle guns never missed. An
80-pound rifle shot wer.t through our
mainmast in the very centre, making an
awful hole. They aimed at our bridge,

Ry the arrival of the steamer City of

how the late correspondence between
Secretary Seward and Lord Lyons, rela*
tive to the arrest of Rritiah subjects in

Jehossee Island and neighborhood. The
L:ncolnites had uot got beyond Pen wick's

and removed their negro*. These places
are located in St. Helena Sound near the
Athepoo K'ver, and are easily approached
by the enemy's gunboats. ]
Letter.? A private letterdated the29th
1 ull., has been received from Hutchinson's
Island, staling that on that day one of (
the enemy's steamer* had approached *
and landed a force of two hundred men,
who bioke into the overs er's h >u e and I
plundered and carried off everything valuable
about the premise*. They then
proceeded to th* residence of the proprio* j
tor, the door of which they forced open,
and demanded from th* servants the
keys of the wine cellar. The wines, how- 1
ever, had previously been removed. The
marauders, after committing some fur- '
ther petty depredations, skulked off to
their l-oats, fearing, probably, a surprise.
Immediately upon their departure, the
torch was applied to the buildings coir
taming the crops, and soon little was left
upon the rich plantation except heaps of
smoking ashes.? Charleston Mercury, 3J

The Fires of Patriotism. ? At 11 o*
c ock, last nigh, the heavens to the South*
west were brilliantly illuminated with the
patriotic flames ascending from burning
cotton. As the spectators witnessed it,
they involuntarily burst forth with cheer
nflnr rhpcr nti.l mrli Imnrl tx-aa ........^.1
as wilh r new pulse. Our people ere in
unrncst. The patriotic planters on tlio
soa l.oard are hourly applying the torch
to their cotton and other produce and
effects. Tho?-e who have not had the
heart to enter upon this work of praiseworthy
patriotism and destruction therm
reives, have authorized the military ,ui?
thorilies, before yielding anything that
:an in the least minister to Yankee greed
snd lust, to fanke the destruction complete
before them. Parties froin North
Edisto and the neighborhood unite in as:
lerting that cotton and valuables on the plantations
which could not he readilv
ernoved were involved in one common
lame and ruin.- Charles ton Courier, CO th.
