limied.
The anti-expansionists, through their
Massachusetts disciple. Senator Hoar,
made things Interesting In the Senate for
nearij- two hours, during executive ses
sion, J estcrd ly afternoon. The achate
arose oer the confirmation of Senators
Cullom .ind Morgan and Representative
Hitt. as members of the Hawaiian Com
mission. AVhcn the names came up for confirma
tion. Senator Hoar arose and made a
vigorous protest against the practice of
appointing members of Congress upon
such commissions. His point was that it
was lioth unconstitutional and unwise for
members of Congress to be appointed
upon a commission to make recommenda
tions upon which they would be called
upon Inter to act as legislators.
As commissioners, he said, such mem
bers of Congress were acting as author
ized agents of the President and were
under his direction. When their report,
as in the case of the Hawaiian Commis
sioners, came before Congress, they ex
ercised an entirely different function.
He referred to the Joint High Commis
sioners, now in session for the purpose of
negotiating a treaty with Great Britain,
and the Peace Commissioners In Paris,
sajing that the same objection applied
to them with cen greater force. Sena
tor Hoar was very emphatic In his re
marks and declared Jhat a stop must be
put to the practice.
f-enators Vest, Chandler, and Bacon
sided with Senator Hoar In ids view cf
the cae. They, too, objected to the prac
tice of the President of apixiiiitlng num
bers of Congress to other jmltions. Tlicv
hejrt that such a practice was contrary
to the spirit of Amerlcm Institutions
The deb ilc became general and Sena
tors Piatt of Connecticut and Adri-h
tcolc Issue with Senator Hoar and in
tended the legal status of the commission
and the right of the President to call
the talents of members of Congress into
the country's service whenever he deem
ed It advantageous and dcslrab e. Thej
contended that the practice was an o d
one and cited a Supreme Court dec's oa
to show that, so far as the coitItutIcn
ality or legality of the question was con
cerned, two oflices may be held by the
same person where the one does not con
flict with the other.
At the conclusion of the debate the
matter was referred tn the Committee on
Judiciary, of which Senator Hear is
chairman. The matter was the subject
of considerable comment after the ses
sion jesterda. So far as It relates to
Hawaii, It is thought, it comes too late,
as the report Is made and the bill to
provide a territorial government has bee 1
introduced in both houses The work
of the commission has been accompl!heJ
and cannot be affected by an action of
the' Senate as to the conllmatlon of tl.e
appointments
It is thought, howeier, to have a future
significant and to have leen brought up
with that In view. In all probabilitj sim
ilar commissions will be created b the
President for the purpose of making rec
ommendations for the permanent govern
ments of Porto Rico and the Philippines,
and this sudden opposition to the practice
of placing senators and representatives on
such commissions is looked upon as an an
tagonistic move on the part of the anti
ex panslonlsts.
Previous to this debate and immediate
after nolng Into executive session the
nomination of Hon. John Hay as Secre
tarj of State was taken up and promptlv
confirmed No action was taken on the
list of names remaining. The President
jesterday added to that list the following
selections and pi emotions:

Senator Perkins of California visited the
President jesterday for the purpose of ex
pressing his views on the subject of the
propo-ed reclprocitj treatj- with Greece.
The object of Greece in opening the ne
gotiations for a reclprocitj agreement is
to secure a greater advantage for her ex
ports of currants and raisins to this coun
try. Senator Perkins sajs that the ra'slng
of currants and the production of raisins
In California are growing Industries, and
that the conclusion of a reclprocitj treatv
with Greece would Impose great hardships
on the citizens of his State. Mr. Perkins
has also made a protest to Secretary Haj
against the proposed trade arrangements.
THINKS HIS OiLLUTlON CERTAIN
sjc-mitor Stewart RxpcvtM "No OppoNl
tlon From -Mr. NpnInniiK.
Senator WHIhm M. Stewart of Nevada
gave borne interesting information to a
Times reporter last night in reference to
his light for re-election to the United
States Senate and the position of Repre
sentative Tiancls G. New lands, of that
State, who Is reported to be In the held
agiinst the veteran silver leader. Senator
Stewart declared that he thought the re
port Improbable.
"Mr. Newlands vvtis p'edged publicly
and privatelj to support me for the
United States Senate," said the senator,
"and it was necessarj" for him to mike
that pledge in order to get the noirlmtlon
for Congress. The pledge Imposed upon
him in the platform of the silver partj,
which was presented to and approved bv
him before it was presented to the con
vention, was:
"'We tarnestlj recommend th re- lec
tion of William M Stewart to the ben He
of the United States and pledge the sliver
paitj of Nevada and. the nominee of this
convention to his support fur that office.'
"In his speech before the eonvention,
cortlnucd Senator Stewart. "Mr. New
lands not only publiclv- Indorsed th's
pledge, but d eel i red that it would be a
calamltj to the siher cause to defeat me
for the United States Senate
"It is true that his friends, who are
representing him to be a candidate, can
vassed the State and declared that their
onlj object was to defeat me. Their
motto was 'anj thing to defeat Stewart
I cannot believe, however, that Mr. New
lands has declared, or will declare, that
he is a candidate against me. Such
trcaeherj could onlj- emanate from the
bisest of the human race and 1 am not
prepared to believe that Mr. Ncwlands
Is willing to put himself in that class."
Senator Stewart was informed of the
rejiort that Mr. New lands had asserte-d
that he and the senator had an under
standing that if the latter did not ole-t
his legislative ticket he (Ncwlands) would
then be free to enter the field as a can
didate. Senator Stewart declared that
such an understanding on his pirt would
have been the work of an Idiot.
"It assumes that I agree to support lilm
for Congress," he said, "and allow him
to fight my legislative ticket so as to
create conditions which would enable him
to become a candidate for the Senate
against me when It Is absolutel- neces
sarj for him to pledge hU support to me
In order to secure his own nomination
for Congress. Mr. Newlards knows we
had no such understanding and he will
not undertake to convince the people of
this countrj, who have known me for
the Lost fortj jears. that I would make
anj sucn agreement.
The sliver party of Nevada was suc
cessful In the election. It elected cverv
candidate on the State ticket, except the
superintendent of public instruction, and
more than two-thirds of the legislature.
The members of the legislature are men
of honor and mj re-election Is assured."

Santiago de Cuba, Dec. 7 The death of
Gen. Antonio Macco was commemorated
bj the Cubans todaj- with elaborate cere
monj. There was a4 big parade in the
morning, and a requiem mass was cele
brated In the cathedral. In the afternoon
there was a meeting in the theater at
which tho dead soldier was eulogized.
The mass was said bj the same priests
who, two jears ago, under the diiectlon
of the Spanish military authorities, chant
ed Te Dennis on the receipt of the news
of Gen. Maceo's death.
The big crowd that assembled In the
morning was not orderly-. Carlos Garcia,
who managed the affair, failed to notiry
Col. Beacom, tho adjutant general, who
Is In command of the city during the ab
sence of Gen Wood,and the Americans
knew nothing of the contemplated pro
cession until a hundied Cubans, armed
with Remington rities, were marching
past the palace. These were followed by
twice as manj more, bearing machetes
and pistols and Cuban Hags The Amer
ican Hug had no place In the procession.
At S o'clock nearly all the crowd en
tered the cathedral to listen to the reli
gious services. Tho armed Cubans out
side llred two salutes with ball cartridges
and two of the bullets chipped pieces of
masonrj- from the cathedral cupola.
A man who was ringing the chimes was
so badly frightened bj the close approach
of the bullets to him that he came down
and no persuasion could induce him to go
Into the cupola ngaln.
A number of bullets fell Into the camp
of the Fifth Immunes In Las Cruces
Hills, south of the city.
When Col. Beacom heard the volle-js.
he summoned Garcia before him and de
manded bj- what authority he brought
armed men Into the cltj. Garcia said he
thought that the Cubans' plan to com
memorate the death of JIaceo was knoivn
to the American authorities. He was or
dered bj Col. Beacom to lmmedlatelj dis
arm the men, which he did
In the afternoon theie was another pro
cession to the theater, but this was more
orderlj. A half dozen sPeech;s were made,
the specchmakers confining themsjlves to
uttering panegjrlcs on Gen. Mateo and de
nouncing the Spaniards No reference was
made to the Americans. This Is the tlr?t
public meeting held in six weeks at which
the American Administration was not crit
icised and demands made for Information
as to when the government was to be
turned over to the Cubans.
Towards night the crowd became drunk
and very boisterous. Thes thronged the
saloons and cafes aud the plaza, making
threats against the Spaniards and Ameri
cans At C o'clock three horsjmen, led bj
a white man wearing the insignia of a
captain In the Cuban armj", rode to the
entrance of the Clrcuio Espanol and
knocked over three policemen who were
guarding the door. Thej then rode Into
the reception room, where thej smashed
two chandeliers and a lot of furniture,
after which thej rode out, with the white
man still at their head. He waved his
machete over bis head and shouted In
Spanish:
T am Juan Castillo, a captain of In-faiitrj-
In the army of liberation of Cuba,
I did this act on account of mj man
hood "
Then, with his three companions, he
galloped down the street, followed bj- a
cheering crowd
After the horsemen had disappeared,
another crowd attempted to break into
the club, but the entrance was blocked
by Capt. Ramon Mendnza, of Gen. Wood's
staffs When the matter was reported to
the American mllitarj" authorities, Lieut.
Matthews brought a detail of troops from
the Fifth Regulars and placed them as
guards at the Spanish Club and the Span
ish bank, with orders to bajonet anj one
who attempted further disorder. Lieut.
Hanna promptlj- dismissed the three
policemen, who allowed themselves to be
run over without reslstence, and also si,
others who failed to prevent the trouble
Secret service men are after Castillo nnd
his companions, with orders to bring
them in, dead or alive.

THE WAR TAX ON BEER.
ilrenen Declare lis Continuance'
nn finiioiiltlon.
New York, Dec. 7. Two hundred nnd
ilfty lager beer brewers, representing
S5 per cent of the brewing Interests oi
this country, and nearly JMOOOOO'V) of cap.
ltal Invested in this lnduntry, met in this
citj todaj to formulate some plan to se
cure the removal of the extrt war fjv
on beer.
C. W. Bergner, of Philadelphia, opened
the meeting with a. brief' speech. "The
heavy burden placed upon brewers ha-
affected the brewings-Industry most se-rlouslj.-"'he
said "The consumption of
malt liquors since June 11, 1S9S, has ma
terially decreased The totjii number of
barrels of beer on which tax vas pild
during the lirst four months of the fiscal
j ear 1Ss7 was 15.428,463.' The total number
on which tax was paid (luring the same
period in 1S98 was 13,527,479. a decrease of
1,600,984 "
Secretarj Thomann followed with a
statement from the board of trus.ec3. He
kald that the war tax was imposed on
the brewers at a time when thej were
staggering under an almost unbearable
burden of Tederal, State, and mun cipal
taxes, yielding the field to tintaxed do
mestic wines. Untaxed alcoholic elder and
to lightly taxed splits. Instead of an
average annual increase 1n the total pro
duction of beer, as In former times, he
said, tho official records showed a consIJ
erable decrease during the past five years
IK then went on to show what, he sa d,
was liie Inequality of the war tax, sajing
that beer had been singled out as the
commodity to tax, while other products
had been let alone, or so slightly taxed
that they did not feel It, The Inevitable
result of this, he said, was disaster for
the many trades dependent on brewing
and the brewing Industries as well.
This statement from the trustee wai
adopted amid great applause.
A number of the delegates fol'owed the
reading of tho trustees' reports with
speech's. i, ji, Ruller, of Boston, de
nounced the entire war, sajing that It
was unnecessary, and had been bgun
without the approval of the people. 1C
was founded, he said, tin a mistaken Idea
of humanltj' and for purposes that turned
out to be false. Mr. Ruller said a lot cf
other things which made It quite aorar
ent that his chief objection was because
I put a fax on beer and "set down with
out as mueh as a hanqclap for his senti
ments H. B Scharimnn, repreientlng New
York and New Jersey brewers, said:
"This additional wnr tax has brought us
down further than competition eer did
or could When it was first Imposed the
statement was made tint the consumer
and not the producer w.ou!d have to bear
it. So the brewer charged It to the re
tailer, telling him to charge It to the con
sumer, either by an increase In the price
or a decrease In the measure. The retailer
has never been ab'e to get tha tax out of
the public. He Is bearing It today. He
cannot stand It, and we must help him.
Ills sucee-ss is our succe--; his failure our
failure The liquor dealer is entitled to
our care and guardianship."
A. G. Ricks, of New Orleans, submitted
some figures that caused consternation
among the brewers. Hp took the five
months from .July to November, 1&97, ln
elusive. and shnwe.1 ThRt tht- ' nf Ttui
In that time in. his State. were 111.C75 bar
rels, while during .the same months this
year they have been but 81,735 barrels.
After several other speakers had ad
dressed the meeting some one called for
adjournment. This brought- Theodore
Oehne, of Chicago, to his feet with a de
mand to know what the meeting was
called for If not to do anvthlng but talk.
A lot of other Westerners objected to con
versatlon and called for action, o two
resolutions were moved and adopted, one
that a committee of eleven be appointed
by the pres'dent to draft a petition to
Congress embodjing all the objections
urged at the meeting against the contin
uation of the war tax on beer, and one
that the president appoint a committee of
five to take charge of all matters pertain
ing to the repeal of the tax;
About forty amendments were offered to
these resolutions and the Westerners kept
howling out that their passage "did not
amount to shucks," and demanding some
thing aggressive. When the hall was
quiet. Congressman Richard Bartholdt. of
Last St. Louis, was introduced. He said:
"I am in favor of the repeal of this ex
tra dollar of tax on beer as the represent
atlve of the largest beer brewing district
In the countrj'- Every fair means should
be used to make Congress repeal this tax.
I suggest that jou get at the congressmen
through their home Influences, through
the people that elect them. 1 am here to
diy because I have more friends Interest
ed in the brewing business than. I have
In the chewing gum Industry' or the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union
You can count on me to work for a repeal
of this law."

12 ii?m J.
Paris, Dec. 7. Considering the sensa
tional nature of the plunge of Sir Edmund
Monson, the British ambassador. Into "the
new dlplomacj," the effect produced Is
less distuibing than might have been ex
pected. Nevertheless, his speech Is under
stood to have caused unbounded surprise
and a disquieting shock In official quar
ters. As jet, however, no prominent man
has Indulged in criticism or lirotett. The
newspapers cqmment lengtiillj ami some
times severelj on the matter, but none
goes so far as to suggest that Sir Ed
mund's recall Is desirable.
The Journal des Debats, In a long but
moderate article crediting the ambassador
with good Intentions, says it believes that
he aimed at maintaining good relations,
as he has done courtcouslj- throughout
the crisis; but it does not admire his
method. The writer of tho article falls
foul of the complaint regarding "the pol
icy of pin pricks," and .says that when
ever England encounters a rival Interest
she cries out that she feels a pin prick
and retaliates with a blow- of a stick.
The paper makes light of the Trench
educational scheme for the Soudan, by
which it believes Sir Edmund was specially-
Irritated, and sajs that the ambassa
dor ought to know better than to attach
Importance to that subject. It adds thai
the speech proves that the misunder
standing between the two nations has not
been cleared, but nothing Is easier than
to come to an arrangement If England Is
willing. The recent speeches of British
statesmen seem to show that they do not
think the time Ins come for settling the
matters in controversj-.
There Is some reason for thinking, that
the waiter of the foregoing Is qualified to
speak on liehalf of M. Delcasse, tho for
eign minister.
The Temps finds It hard to belle e that
Sir Edmund's language did not go leyond
what he meant to saj-. It asks how his
protest against Trench colleges in the
Soudan Is reconcilable with the British
advocacy of an "open door."
Tha Ulierto declares that the speech

Paris, Dec. 7. At the request of the
Spanish Commissioners the session of
the Joint Peace Commission, which was
to have been held today, has been post
poned until tomorrow.
The proceedings cf yesterday's meeting-
of the Joint Peace Commission were
not so harmonious as the press was
made to understand. Only two of the
Spanish proposals met with acceptance
by the Americans.
A man in high authority informed
your correspondent that It was highly
probable that the treaty would consist
of only ten articles.
The proposal of the Spaniards that
an International commission, composed
of two Englishmen, two Frenchmen,
one American, and one Spaniard, half
of the commission to be chosen by
i either nation, with zi Rpmwn arbitrator
In case of non-agreement, be appointed
to Investigate the Maine disaster, as ab
solutely refused.
The Spaniards are sore o er President
McKinley's references tn the Maine In
his message, considering' them Inoppor
tune and discourteous.
At a late hour jesterday afternoon
Secretary Hay said no word had been
received from Paris It i stated that the
President snt to Chairman Day on

the conclusion of the treatj- of peace.

between Spain and the United States,
until which time it will make no move
