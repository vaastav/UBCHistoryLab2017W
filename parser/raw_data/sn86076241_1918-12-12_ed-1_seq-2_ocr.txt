THE NEW WATCH ON THE RHINE
(Written for the United Press by Charles B. Driscoll)
There sounds a voice, like trumpet call, .
Above the noise of thrones that fall,
"The Rhine, the Rhine, the noble Rhine!
Who guards today that silver line?
CHORUS '
Humanity, no danger thine,
Humanity, no danger thine,
The Yanks now keep the watch, the watch on Rhine !
The Yanks now keep the watch, the watch on Rhine 1
The tyranny that used to dwell
Beside the Rhine has gone to hell;
Now "Yankee hands, so firm and true,
Plant there the old Red, White and Blue.
The Yankee soldier, head held high,
Swears here an oath that will not die;
While flow thy waters to the sea
Thy banks of tyrants shall be freel
There flows no more brave Belgian blood
To stain with shame thy rushing flood;
Along the Rhine the world now sees
The Starry Flag flung to the breeze.
Bright emblem of a .world redeemed,
Emblem of dreams our fathers dreamed,
Thy stars of hope in triumph shine
Along the Rhine, the noble Rhine !
SECRETARY LANE ON ILLITERACY
Secretary of the Interior Lane is one of the strongest advocates
of education in the United States and he recognizes that a big nation
cannot lead and hold its respect in world culture if it does not bring
its people above the stage of illiteracy or near-illiteracy.
The secretary's last annual report devotes considerable space to
this subject and it should be obtained and read and digested by edu
cators and statesmen everywhere.
Concluding his report is a letter on the subject addressed to the
president and it is so rich in advice and widsom that it is herewith:
reproduced in full and readers are urged to give it more than a
casual perusal :
March 14, 1918.
I believe that the time has come when we should give serious
consideration to the education of those who can not read or write in(
the United States. The war has brought facts to our attention that
are almost unbelievable and-that are in themselves accusatory. There
are in the United States (or were when the census was taken in
1910) 5,516,163 persons over 10 years of age who were unable to read
or write in any language. There are now nearly 700,000 men of
draft age in the United States who are, I presume, registered who j
cannot read or write in English or in any language.
Over 4,600,000 of the illiterates in this country were 20 years of
m f 1 i 1 j j 1 J 1 a a .
age or more, mis ngure equals me toiai population oi me siaies
of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colo
rado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Delaware. The per
centage of illiterates varies in the several states from 1.7 per cent in
Iowa to 29 per cent in Louisiana. More than 10 per cent of it was in
thirteen states. Half of the illiterates were between 20 and 45 years
of age. It has been estimated by one of those concerned with this
problem that if these 5,516,163 illiterate persons were stretched in a
double line of march at intervals of three feet and were to march
past the White House at the rate of twenty-five miles a day it would
require more than two months for them to pass. Over 58 per cent are
white persons, and of these 1,500,000 are native-born whites.
I beg you to consider the economic loss arising out of this condi
tion. If the productive labor value or an illiterate is less by only 50
cents a day than that of an educated man or woman, the country is
losing $825,000,000 a year through illiteracy. This estimate is no
doubt under rather than over the r.eal loss. The federal government
and the states spend millions of dollars in trying to give information
to the people in rural districts about farming and home making.
Yet 3,700,000 or 10 per cent, of our country folk can not read or
write a word. They can not read a bulletin on agriculture, a farm
paper, a food-pledge card, a Liberty Loan appeal, a newspaper, the
constitution of the United States or their Bibles, nor can they keep
personal or business accounts. An uninformed democracy is not a
democracy. A people who can not have means of access to the
mediums of public opinion and to the messages of the president and
the acts of congress can hardly be expected to understand the- full
meaning of this war, to which they all must contribute in life, or
property, or labor.
It would seem to be almost axiomatic that an illiterate man can
regular army would not enlist illiterates, yet in the first draft be
tween 30,000 and 40,000 illiterates were brought into the army and
approximately as many near illiterates.
They can not sign their names.
They cannot read their orders posted daily on bulletin boards in
camp.
They can not read their manual of arms.
They can not read their letters or write home.
They can not understand the signals or follow the Signal Corps
in time of battle.
There are 700,000 men who can not read or write who may be
drafted within our army within the next year or two. Training
camps for soldiers are not equipped for school work, and the burden
of teaching men to read the simplest English should not be cast
upon the officers or others in fhe camps. We should give some
education to all our men before they enter the army
There is even a larger problem than this that challenges our at
tention, and that is the teaching of the English tongue to millions of
our population. Dr. John II. Finley, president of the University of
the State of New York, in a recent speech presented this picture
which he found in one of the eantonments:
How practical is the need of a language in this country common to
all tongues is illustrated by what I saw in one of the great canton
ments a few nights ago. In the mess hall, where I had sat an hour be
fore with a company of the men of the national army, a few small groups
were gathered along the tables learning English under the tuition of
some of their comrades, one of whom had been a district supervisor in
a neighboring state and another a theological student. In one of those
groups one of the exercises for the evening consisted in practicing the
challenge when on sentry duty. Each pupil of the group (there were
four of Italian and two of Slavic birth) shouldered in turn the long
handled stove shovel and aimed it at the teacher, who ran along the
ui me mum, us u iu ciuc me guaru. ine pupu caned out in
broken speech, "Halt! who goes there?" The answer came from the
teacher, "Friend." And then, in as yet unintelligible English (the voices
of innumerable ancestors struggling in their throats to pronounce it), the
words, "Advance and give the countersign." So are those of confused
tongues learning to speak the language of the land they have been sum
moned to defend. What a commentary upon our educational short
comings that in the days of peace we had not taught these men, who
have been here long enough to be citizens (and tens of thousands of
their brothers with them), to know the language in which our history
and laws are written and in which the commands of defense must now
he given ! May the end of this decade, though so near, find every citizen
of our state prepared to challenge, in one tongue and heart, the purposes
of all who come, with the cry, "Who goes there?"
What I have said here leads to a respectful request that you give
an early consideration to House Bill 6490, which provides for a mod
est appropriation for the bureau of education to begin and conduct a
not make a good soldier in modern warfare. Until last April the systematic campaign for the eradication of adult illiteracy.

V7AR SAVINGS STAMPS
ISSUED DY THE
UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT
RENO, Nev., Nov. 20.
FELLOW NEVADANS December is Nevada's "Honor
Month" and it is up to us to make good our quota of War
Savings stamps.
Last June we made a pledge campaign and signed up a
total of about $1,300,000 cash sales and pledges. We must
now cover the state with an intensive man-to-man canvass dur
ing December to see that these pledges are kept and that suf
ficient additional cash sales are made to bring our state total
above the original quota of $2,225,680. And we will go over
the top here, as we have done in every drive that has been,
made since our nation entered the war.
The $2,000,000,000 of War Savings stamps constituted an
important part of the nation's war finance. It was the sum
set aside to be raised from the small savings, the self-denial,
and the patriotic sacrifice of our children and our adults of
small means who were unable to buy Liberty bonds.
The man, woman or child of Nevada who gives expensive
Christmas presents this year is false to the very spirit of
Christmas. The beautiful story of the Christ child born in a
manger must not be remembered this year by the giving of
useless trinkets when half the world is starving and dependent
upon us for clothes and warmth. A gift of War Savings
stamps observes all the traditional spirit. It instills a lesson
of patriotism and thrift; it brings the same warm responsive
glow without the feeling of selfish gratification that comes
from useless gifts.
Let us spread this message through every possible agency.
Let us end our "Honor Month" by an oversubscription. To
do so we must reach every citizen of Nevada again next month
with an appeal that they buy the limit in War Savings stamps
not Thrift stamps, as is is too late for them now.
FRED L. WHITE,
Nevada Director War Savings.
