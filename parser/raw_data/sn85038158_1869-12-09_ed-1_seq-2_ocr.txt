INTERVIEW WITH JUDOE JEWETT.
At the meeting in th' evening Judge
Jewett wan introduced by a committee
that bad been sent to wait on him, and
desire from him any communication he
might have to make, of his willingness to
aid the new enterprise. '
Fresh from the purchase of iron works
at 1000,000, and a railiHtad ai a million, the
broad shouldered, ratlr r corpulent, full
f.iced and massive bended President of the
Pan-handle breathed rather heavily,
and rubl'ed his head wearily, as he took
the chair set for him; and, in response to
some kindly inquiries, confessed that he
was growing old and fleshy.
The subject that had' brought them to
gether was then introduced by the gentle
men pres lit, and Judge Jewett listened to
their statements as to the prospects of the
enterprise, and the hope they bad that he
would foster it for a feeder -of the roads in
which he is interested. The interview j

THE PROPOSED NEW ROAD.
This enterprise was tirst projected six
teen years since, by the New York and
Krie -Rath-ond, for a Southern connection.
They made a survey throiiftli the eastern
counties to Maysviilc, and lingered over
it about a year, but that was the end of
that. The matter was dropped, and was
not Ruitated until last spring, when a few
persons, listening to the suggestion of the
Pan-handle (Pennsylvania.) C'oiup my,
that, if the people would build the road- j
bed from, say Dresden to Maysville, they j
would lay the iion, equip the road, build .
the bridge over the Ohio at Maysville, and 1
thus sceure the northern connection. :Tliis j
company now owns west to Newark from
Philadi lphia; tiiey nlso have control from
llllllllll'IW IO ' UllflllllBll, HIM HIP USB Ol
Hie gap from Newark to Columbas. j
111 accordance with the suggestions above
mentioned, meetings were held of people I
of Brown, Highland mid Fayelte Counties,
at Circleville, in July lust, the result of
which was the appointment of committees '
of those counties ! to have a survey made, j
Mr. J. (Jore, of Adams County, was ap-
pointed to make the survey, which work
lie commenced on the lllth of August, at
Aberdeen, opposite XIa3-ville, on the Ohio
River, sixty-four miles ahove this city.
Mr. Gore carried the survey from Aber
deen;0 west of north to liipley eijrht
miles; thence via Rusliville, Fincastle and
New Market lo Hillwboro, about thirty
five miles 18 enst of north; thence by
Ieesburo; to Washincton, the capital of
Fayette Comity, twenty-four miles, in
about the same course, or. perhaps. 2 or
more of a deflection from due north. j
As our readers know. Washington is on
the Cincinnati, Y ilminuton and Zanes-
vilie Hailrnad, which fact is siKniricant,
and accounts for.the inemion of another
interest in this article. From Washing-

Mount Sterling, Palestine and Harrisburg
to Columbus, .-thirty-seven and a half
miles, making a total of one hundred and
seven mi:es from Aberdeen to Columbus
The alignment of the road has the merit
of great directness, almost an air-liue,as fol
lows ;
The maximum grade is fifty feet to the
mile, which is necessary in order to reach
the table bind. From Aberdeen to Ripley
it is very direct; from Ripley, through the
Ripley basin to the table-land, about eight
miles, seven miles of which has a grade of
fifty feet to the mile, overcoming an alti
tilde of three hundred and fifty feet, it is
quite circuitous. . Thence, four - miles to
Kussellsville, on an air line; thence to Fiu
castle, nine and a half miles, is an air line,
through a generally even, though slightly
undulating country, encountering a Ringle
instance of extraordinary expense, say one
mile, at Eagle Creek; thence, to within
two and a half miles of New Market, is an
airline of sevcu miles, with only surface
grading; thence to the crossing of the
Hillsboro Railroad, n mile and a quarter
west of Hillsboro, the graduation will be
rather expensive, with rather heavy cuts
and fills. Thence to Hillsboro one and a
quarter miles alongside of the Hillsboro
and Cincinnati road, the cost will be
slight. From Hill -.boro to the table-land
north of Clear Creek, about four aodl a
half miles, the road will be expensive
with its graduation and masonry. These
table-binds reached, there is an air line ol
rive miles to lesburg. with only surface
grading. From Leesburg, crossing Lee's
Creek, and for a distance of a mile and a
half, heavy expense will be required. The
creek lies one hundred feet below the table-land.
Tii'e table-land ' having been
reached ae-afh, there is an air line of thir
teen miles to Washington, . with surface
griding throughout save at the crossings
of Rattlesnake and Sugar Creeks, where
there will bo additional expense, but not
very heavy. At Washington, the road
will connect with, and crass the Circinna
ti. Wilmington and Zanesville Railroad,
sixty-nine and one half miles fiom Aber
deen. Thence is continued the airline
to Blooininglinrg, live and one half miles,
through a level, even country, with sim
ply snrfiice gra-dimr. crossing Paint Creek,
say a. milesouth of Bloomingburg. Thence
by an air line the. road will run, deflecting
20 to the east, by Mount Sterling and
Palestine, to Harrisburg, ' a distance ol
nineteen miles. Thence the d"flection Is
seveii degrees west for 6,000 feet across
Darby Creek. : For three miles here the
cost of the road will be heavy. Having
crossed Darby Creek and reached the table-land
there is an air line of . fourteen
miles to Columbus, in the same course as
that to Harrisburg, connecting with the
Hocking Valley road. 1.300 leet north of
Ihelr eastern bridge over the Scioto.
GENERAL IDEAS.
A portion of the general plan Is to con
nect with the Hocking Valley Railroad.
of the best coal-liulds in Ohio; and to con
tinue, by an arrangement with them, if
possible, around to the Columbus and
Cleveland depot.
The iiMst prominent local advantage to
be derived from this enterprise, is to ac
commodate the grain and stock" business
of these counties. There will thus be af
forded a new' opening to the Eastern mar
ket. It is a rich "country, and it wants a
market to develope its resources. All of
these counties are very productive of
grain, and feed a large amount of cattle
and hogs. It is as good a corn country as
can be found in the State.
This also gives these counties access to
coal, of which they have been in need.
They pay to-day, live cents more per bush
el than is charged in the Cincinnati mar
ket. Should this road be built it will stand
as a'norlh and south line lor connection by
way bf Maysville and Lexington, with the
Soul hern States.

W. R. Smith, Sec'y. !
Chilltcothe & Maysville R.R.
The prospects of this enterprise are
not particularly brilliant just now,
judging from the tone of the Chilli-
cothe papers. The old fogies of the
... . ,. r
Ancient metropolis, it appears, reruse
to come down with the needful.
Hear
the Advertiser pitch into them:
A Mistake.
The Portsmouth Trih'ine imagines
that the reason the old Fus.-tilizcd Cap
italists of Chill icot he refuse to assist
the O &. S. Railroad is that they pre
fer the route down the valley. All a
mistake. With them, it is simply a
matter of squeezing their funds and
making .them produce a certain per
cent. They don't take, risks. They
have enough for themselves and chil
dren, and don't care a curse for the
struggling barbarians. They would
not take stock in a railroad to Heaven,
with the tender of a free pass and wel
come admission when they get there,
if you couldn't insure them twenty
per cl-nt. cash on the capital invested.
With aslight alteration Watts' hymn
is our only consolation: .
- "Tlmy ennaot live alwayf
Ak ut tliHt they nay."
Perhaps the true reason why your
"old fossils" hang back, brother Put
nam, is because they have discovered
the fact, which is :iiow apparent to
everybody else, that there is no chance
for your road, since our Maysville &
Columbus short line has been started.
You may as well give up the contest
and save further trouble.
The Bright Side for December is
received and is brighter than ever. It
is thoroughly imbued with- a childish
Cheerfulness, which makes it very
pleasant as well as profitable to look at.
We do not wonder it is attaining such
popularity. Its merits, as well as its
price, ought to niakeit popular.
