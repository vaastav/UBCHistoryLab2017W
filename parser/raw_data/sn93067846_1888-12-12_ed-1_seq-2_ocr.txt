TUM GEB EBAL ASSEMBLY*
A healthy tone seems to pervade thc
General Assembly this session. They
vast to do right and are trying to pro?
tect the people's interest. Oar repre?
sentatives are thoroughly impressed
1 that oar people are taxed almost to
death. They know that something is
wrong somewhere, and they are infused
with the spirit to set things to rights,
and the economists, as they are con?
temptuously called, are biasing the way
for easier traveling for the people.
That is all right. Taxes mast come
down Bat the Legislature began at
the wrong end the other day when it
commenced to prune the judges salaries.
The majority of oar judges earn every
cent of their salaries, and, besides, to
commence economy here is poor econ?
omy, indeed, as the importance and
dignity of the position demands the
best legal talent the State can afford,
and rt stands to reason that a man
learned in the law cannot be had for a
small salary. Bat the General Assem?
bly ts on the right track, and ia this
desire to reduce the taxes will be sus?
tained by the people of this State.
The Greenville News talks plainly
and to the point when it said the other
day that "everything is cheaper now
than it was ten or twelve years ago ex?
cept salaries and other government ex?
penses. Thc taxes paid in this State
to-day represent more bales of cotton
than did the taxes of Radical times,
waile the land on which the cotton is
ramed will produce co more than it did
thea, and most of the taxation is paid
with cotton money ; they represent
more pounds of wheat and seeks of flour
than they did. The farmer's land will
yield no more, bat a greater part is
taken by the tax gatherer; his money j
represents more cotton, provisions and 1
clothing than it did bat its power in
dearing off tax bills is not increased."
Every word of the above is trae, and
it is the solemn duty of every maa ia
tte House and Senate to work for eooo
emy and let oar tax-hardened people
hare a living chance io this life.
AM IMPORTANT MATTER.
Representative Walter Hazard, of
Georgetown County, has paved the way
for an honest vote k bis joint resolu?
tion offered on last Saturday to amend
the Constitutional provisions in relation
to the qualification of electors. This
educational provision requires that
every male citizen "who shall be able
to read the Constitution of the United
States and the Constitution of this State,
in the English laagaage, ead to write his
same legibly*' shall be entitled to vote.
The reseiutfco lays the foundation for
intelligent voting and places white and ,
black apee thc only fair and jost foot?
ing in the exercise of sovereignty.
An hosest expression of the people's
will caa only be arrived at through in?
telligent votes, and no vote b an honest
vote unless it is aa intelligent one, and
aa ed ?cation rd qualification is absolutely
Piesau ry to insure the country'a peace
and prosperity where ignorance pre?
vails to say extent. The man, be be
white or black, wbo cannot comply
with the requirements of Mr. Hazard's
resolution eaght to be regarded by his
coan try as a dangerous voter, and
therefore should not be allowed to jeop?
ardise her trae interest by casting an
ignorant vote.
The eight-box law bas proved a biers- j
lng to South Carolina, and has been in
effect an educational qualification of
electors. Bat what is pre-eminently
j oat and proper at one period of time
may not be so at another. This is a
very grave and important question for
ns to consider, sod evidently represen?
tative Hazard realizes the situation as
hts proposed amendment plaioly indi?
cates. _
HE I>ID HIS DUTY
Birmingham, Ala., is in a terrible
State of excitement and the citizens of
that city are almost rabid over the
wholesale killing brought about by a
nob gathered for the express purpose
to force che jail and take out and hang
one Hawley accused of the murder of
his wife and children. This man as?
serts most positively his innocence, bot
tbe greater part of the citizens of Birm?
ingham believed him guilty and at?
tempted to lynch him the other night.
Tbe mob were wild with rage and ex?
citement and they made an attack upon
tbe jail. The Sheriff with his armed
men warned the mob that he wonld fire
upon them if they attacked the jail.
Some of the would-be lynchers opened
fire and the Sheriff ordered his posse to
fire upon them. Ten persons were
killed and quite a number wounded.
The excite m tat that followed was so
great thal thc cry for the Sheriff's blood
riocrld bc beard on every side. The
Governor ot the State bad to send
troops down to protect the Sheriff and
the accused mao.
Thc Sheriff did his duty bravely and
promptly and deserves the commenda?
tion of every law abiding citizen not
only in Birmingham but in the
United States. It was not for the
Sheriff to consider whether Hawley was
guilty or innocent. He was his pris?
oner and ta jail. It was bis sworn
duty and business to protect him, and
let the jury of his country pass upot
bis guilt or ionocenoe.
We are satisfied that after the excite
meat subsides the people of Binning*
ham will see that they were wrong it
crying for the blood of the Sheriff wh<
ought to be held up as aa example tc
all of the Sheriffs in America.
POOR CHARLESTON.
We are sorry for Charleston. A
few politicians mn the machine all theil
own way and the people of that citj
have no more to do with the manage?
ment of their political affairs than thc
man in the moon. This, fact was
forcibly illustrated on last Friday even?
ing at the special meeting of the Char?
leston County Democratic Convention
called by the Executive Committee to
consider the nuanimoos aotion of the
committee in recommending that th?
primary plan of nominating democratic
candidates be substituted for the con?
vention.
The Charleston papers were fall ot
the proceedings of the meeting, and
there was not one single argument that
would bold good against the proposed
change, and yet there was no change.
It stayed Convention. The politicians
were on hand and said it must be Con?
vention and Convention it is.
Capt. F. W. Dawson worked hard
for the primary plan, but all of his
forcible arguments aod eloquence for
the change were is vain with the politi?
cians ; but he has won the unbounded
admiration of the people of South
Carolina by the stand be took in this
matter.
A SC?LLAW?G DEFINED.
Now, what is a scallawag ? A seal
la wag is an ex-Confederate soldier, who
after the war in which be was physically
crushed by force of arms, came home to
crawl tod fawo before the dominant
faction of his conquerors, recanting the
principles which, residing in the soul
of every native Southerner, are as im?
mortal as the soul itself, of constitu?
tional liberty and the supremacy of the
white race.-Bessemer (Ala,') Journal.
The origin of this expressive word is
said to be as follows : Around Rich?
mond, during the war, the drovers who
supplied the army with beef were ac?
customed to speak of scabby, mangy,
diseased cattle is "scallawags," and
the word fitted so well the type of per?
son above described, th* it was adopt?
ed by a unanimous vote. This result
?tay have been aided by th? lively ree?
lections left in the minds of many a
Confederate soldier of having such beef
served oat to him as rations, along with
the "salt horse** and other such tooth?
some delicacies so familiar in camp.
Senator Marion Moise is recognized
as a conspicuous figure ia the State Sen?
ate and his arguments on the various
j questions before that body are always
i lucid and logical.
Representative Altamont Moses
fought manly against the bill to reduce
the judges* salaries and bis speech
against the arguments of the eoono
? mists has been the theme of praise by
many.
The correspondent for the News and
j Courier says Mr. Wilson, of Sumter, is
[ working for re-apportionment, but that
' the bill is likely to go over as well as
! tts author. We will wager a bet that
our representative will always be able
to bold his own.
Senator M. C. Butler was elected his
own successor yesterday to the United
States Senate by the General Assembly.
He and Senator Hampton are likely to
represent us in that august body until
their death, as South Carolina never
forgets her war heroes.
On our first page will be fouod the
report of the Committee of the Farmers*
Association appointed to visit tho Mis?
sissippi Agrien lt aral College. It isa
plain statement, covering the points
upon which reliable information is de?
sired by our people at this time, and
the high character of the gentlemen
who composed the committee should
satisfy all that their report is reliable.
The New York llerald, of Monday,
states that the cause which led to the
j duel at Sand Bar Ferry the other day
j between a gentleman from Lancaster
j whose name cannot be ascertained and
j Dr. Du lio, of Baltimore, was an insult
I ing remark made by the latter about
j Senator M C.Butler. The unknown
j South Carolinian who was true-blue to
j Senator Butler is thought to be badly
j wounded. Dr. Duliu has been arrested
> and is in jail in Augusta.

WASHINGTON LETTER.
WASHIXOTO*. D. C., Dec. ?, 1888.
'Senator Blackburn, owiog to the
! wide advertisement of bis recent mis
I understanding with Judge Bucker, has
j been the center of attraction to the
! visitors io the Senate gallery this week,
j He positively refuses to talk about the
i matter, but his friends regard it as
j ended-at least that is what they say.
j Senator Harris, by a motion to lay
! the Senate tariff bill ou the table,
j brought out the fact that tb? republi
; eau Senators will vote solidly in favor
of that measure, notwithstanding the
fact that several of them are known to
be bitterly opposed to certain sections of
the bill. Several explanations are
given for this action by parties who
profess to know. One is that Harrison
j bas stated that he wants the bill pa*sed
?at this session, aud that those republi
I cans that are opposed to it are afraid to
vote against it, lest they thereby lose
their share of patronage under the new
! administration ; another is, that they |
! know the bill will not pass the Hou?e
! aod only vote for it to keep np an ap?
pearance of harmony tn the republican
ranks until after Harrison is inaugura?
ted, leaving the quarrel that is believed
by many people to be ioevitablo over
the tariff, until the next session, when
! they will control both House and
j Senate.
i The President's message was an able
statement of the position of the detr
eratic party on the tariff and other mi
ters of importance ; the ideas express
therein could not have been improve
Statements like the following from tl
message are ponderous with statesma
like wisdom : 'He mocks the peor,
who proposes that the Government sb;
protect the rich, and that they io ta
will care for the laboring poor. Ai
intermediary between the people ai
their government, or the least deleg
tioo of tba care and protection ti
Government owes to the humblest cit
zen in the land, makes the boast of fr
institutions a glittering delusion, ai
the pretended boon of American citize
ship a shameless imposition.' * *
'Extravagant appropriations of publ
money with all their demoralizing co:
sequences should not be tolerate
either as a means of relieving the tre
sury of its present surplus, or i
furnishing pretext for resisting a prop?
reduction in tariff rates.' * * *
'It cannot be denied that the seifu
and private interests which are i
persistently heard when efforts are mac
to deal in a just and comprehens?
manner with our tariff laws, are relate
to if they are not largely responsib
for, the sentiment largely prevailio
among the people, that the genon
Government is the fountain of iudivic
ual and private aid ; that it may t
expected to relieve with paternal cai
the distress of citizens and commun
ties, and that from the fullness of ii
Treasury it should upon the slight]
possible pretext of promoting the genen
good, apply public funds to the benet
of localities and individuals. Nor ca
it be denied that there is a growin
assumption that as against the Govern
ment and in favor of private claims an
interests, the usual rules and limitation
of business principles and just dealing
should be waived. These ideas hav
been unhappily muoh encouraged b
legislative acquiescence. Relief froi
COD trac ts made with the Government i
too easily accorded in favor of the citi
zen; the failure to support claim
against the Government by proof i
often supplied by no better considerado
than the wealth of the Government an
the poverty of the claimant ; gratnitie
in the form of pensions are grantee
upon DO other real ground than th
needy condition of the applicant, or fo
reasons less valid ; and large sums ar
expended for public buildings and othe
improvements upon representation
scarcely claimed to be related to publi
needs and necessities.'
The House yesterday by unanimou
consent took up the direct tax bill
which caused the long deadlock las
spring. It is expected that it will bi
passed, but hopes are expressed by it
opponents that Mr. Cleveland will vet<
it.
Mr. Harrison's backbone ie likely t<
suffer a severe strain between now ant
the fourth of March. The repa bli
caa leaders here have determined npoi
having an extra session of the Fifty
first Congress called to meet late ii
March or early in April. There is no
the slightest necessity of au extra scs?
sion ; the republicans acknowledge
that their only object in having it callee
is to gain the six Senators and as man)
Repr?sentatives as South Dakota.
Montana and Washington, when admit
ted as states, shall be entitled to, Thej
have decided thai owing to their ver)
narrow margin in both Houses, this
action is necessary in order to enable
the new states to organize and send
their Senators and Representatives in
time for the beginning of the regular
December session. It remains for Mr.
Harrison to decide if he will allow his
party leaders to compel him to call a
needless session for the sake of a few
more votes.
Death of Col. H. B Bridgers.
Special Dispatch to Charle$ton World.
COLUMBIA, Dec 10.- Col. R. R.
Bridgers, president of the Wilmington,
Columbia and Augusta Railroad, and
one of the most prominent and well
known railroad men in the Southern
States, died in this city this evening at
6 o'clock. He was addressing tbe
Senate railroad committee on the bills
to extend the time of the Wilmington,
Columbia and Augusta Railroad to
construct a drawbridge ever the Wateree
river, when he was suddenly overcome
by a rush of blood to- bis bead. He
staggered, and was caught and placed
on a sofa. He asked for his nephew,
Capt. J. T. Barron, to speak to the
committee for him in behalf of the road.
Not reviving, be was placed in a covered
wagon and carried to Captain Barron's
residence on Plain street, where a
physician was called in, but to no avail,
as be died after lingering' in a semi
unconscious condition until 7 30.
Colonel Bridgers was in perfect health
apparently wheo be went to the com?
mittee meeting, and his sudden taking
off was a great shock to his relatives
and friends in this city. He was 72
years old, and had been for many years
identified with the railroad interests of
this state, as well as of the entire South.
He was one of the chief magnates of
the Atlantic Coast Line, and always
enjoyed the reputation of being a
generous and liberal capitalist.
A special train was made up at mid?
night, and the remains were conveyed
to bis home in Wilmington. A num?
ber of his friends will meet the body
at Florence, and accompany it on the
rest of the journey.

Two Bottles Cure Rheumatism.
BOUGHTON, ARK.. Jone 4, 1887.
I cheerfully state the following facts in re?
gard to the use of your medicine in my fami?
ly. My little soo, 14 years of age, suffered
from an acute attack of rheumatism, caused
by undue exposure and chilling of the blood.
I heard your remedy highly recommended,
and purchased one bottle of Moncrief k Bro.,
Prescott, Ark. In about one month, after
using this bottle, he became so much better
that I got the second bottle which is now
being used, and my son is nearly well, and I
think by removing him to a cooler summer
climate (which I will do) and continuing its
use, a perfect cure will be effected. I consider
B. B. B., a most excellent blood po ri her.
