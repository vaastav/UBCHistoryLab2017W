The Mohave Miner
C M FUNSTON Editor
KINGMAN DECEMBER 8 1888
Tho preachers and moral cttizons of
Phcrnix luvve been holding meetings to
devise ways and means to redeem that
city from its wickedness
Mohave count liaB no aspirants for
the position of Governor of Arizona but
she may be heard from in reaped to one
or two of the other territorial offices be
tween now and tho 4th of March next
Only two Presidents of tho United
States hae received a larger electoral
vote than Benjamin Harrison vl re
ceive They were Franklin Pierce and
U S Grant In 1852 Pierce had 25 1 votes
in tho electoral collcgo and in 1872 Grant
had 2SG
Up in Montana a boy was explaining
to other boys the process of casting a vote
at election When asked what was ne
cessary in case of a challenge the experi
enced jouth said Then you have to
gwear that you have been thirty days in
tho Territory and six monthd in the pon
itentiary
The Governor of Alaska in his report
gays that tho stamp mills on Douglass
Island are the largest in tho world and
have an estimated output of 150000 per
month in gold Other gold mines are
being developed on tho same island and
the report noUia tho sale of four claims for
1500000 Promising silver discoveries
havo also been made The Goernor
thinks there ti enough coal in the Terri
tory to supply the wholo of tho United
States for centuries
A wagon loaded with supplies for the
Vulture mine was stuck in the mud near
Nigger Wells Arizona recently and the
tearnnter unloaded 1750 pounds of giant
powder by the roadside After the team
ster had gone with tho balance of his load
another came in sight and seeing a
coyote curiously examining tho boxes
piled by the roadside took a shot at the
animal Jlin shot struck the giant powder
and people for ton miles around thought
thre was a fearful earthquake The
coyotchas not been seen since neither
lias the powder
Heretofore savs the Examiner pro
posals for admission havo been limited to
Dakota 3Iontana Washington and New
Mexico But it adds it is timo to con
aider whether wo may not get rid at once
of almost our wholo Territorial system
Arizona Wyoming and Idaho hae at
least 100000 inhabitants each and they
liave resources which will make it certain
that they will not be rotten boughs If
all seven should bo admitted there would
be no disfranchised communities left in
oar wholo country except Utah Alaska
the Indian Territory and the District of
Columbia
Tho Presidents message contains nearly
twenty thousand word5 It is mainly
devoted to the tariff and affirms the Presi
dents iews as expressed in his message
of a year ago The message reviews the
raost important qnestions with which the
administration has had to deal A num
ber of suggestions are submitted looking
to a fcettlcment of tho questions htillopen
A considerable portion of the message is
devoted to our foreign relations and es
pecially to the efforts made tobringabout
a settlement of tho fisheries dispute The
message suggests that adequate power of
retaliation be given to tho executive
Tho Secretary of War in his annual re
port giv a brief review of tho trouble
with tho Chiricahua Apache Indians from
the Mexican war to the present time and
discussing the various plans suggested for
their future treatment The Indians are
now confined at Mount Vernon Barracks
and many appeals have been made for
their release In regard to their disposi
tion the Secretary saa that various
plans have been suggested tho raost
promising one by Geneial Armstrong
which is to place them on a farm near
Jortresj Mnnroe but there were serious
abjections to this urged from many quar
ters and it was deemed impracticable It
iavery desireablo to fveure some place
where tho climate is suitable and oppor
tunity to instruct and emplov them in
agriculture Meantime the work if not
one of reformation Is certainly one of
amelioration and tend3 toward the soften
ing of their pavage qualities The work
is progressing and they are as contented
aud happy as they can bo anywhere out
Bide of Arizona For it i3 to be remarked
that they cling to that ppot and would
Tcsolntelv rapist and would be very un
happy if moved to ay otner permanent
homo
The action of tho Santa Ve employes at
a meeting recently held at Topeka at
which resolutions were pased acquiescing
in the action taken by the company in
reducing all salaries over K per month
10 per cent will bo highly appreciated by
that railroad comptny The Santa Fp
has been forced to reduction in order to
meet tho decrease in business over its
lines It is understood that this is a
temporary measure and that all the em
ployes affected by it will bo restored to
former salaries a3 toon as business will
justify it Tho Hanta Fe has been forced
to reduce jalarieJ several times in the
Hast and in every instance it has restored
that reduction as soon as its business
justified it By reason of its fair and just
treatment to tho great army of men in Its
employ in all departments from the
highest to the loweit position the Mnta
Fe has won the confidence and high re
gard not only of them but of the public in
general The ollltcra and management
will deeply appreciate thy action of its
cmployo3 and while it may U a present
hardship wc feel safe in predicting that
not ono of the men from tho highest to
the lowest position thus affected will lose
jiriv thing tu the long run

Washington Nov 27th 1888
Mrs Cleveland is not iiermitling tho
worm in tho bud to prey upon her damask
cheek I for round of social duties is still
observed On Tuesday she called upon
Mrs Laraont to sco tho eight pound girf
that arrived on Saturday On Wednesday
andFriday evenings sho occupied Secre
tary Whitneys box at tho performance of
tho French comedians Tho President
was not present having announced his
intention to tako no relaxation until ho
shall havo finished his message to Con
gress
Mr Lovi P Morton was in town this
week to look after his nearly completed
apartment building No man over looked
happier Ho chatted with old friends
and seemed delighted to find any
associates of his former Washington life
His handbomo wifo accompanied hnn
Tho Mortons havo not jet decided as to
their residenco in Washington Mr Mor
ton will only bo here a few days in March
and will not bring his family hero before
tho ojwning of tho Fifty first Congress
E W Halford of tho Indianapolis
Journal who will success Daniel Laxnont
as the Private fce retary to the President
seems a wise selection He is a man of
wider experience than most private secre
taries and wields no slight personal influ
ence in politics So far as tho salary is
concerned tin position is ungrateful
The private setretary receiv cs only 3250
per year President Cleveland it is said
pays Lamon an additional 1000 out of
his own salary Of course tho position
is coveted mainly on account of tho pat
ronage With Departmental and bureau
officers the private secretary is often as
powerful as the Preddent and the per
sonal friends of Editor Halford will be
tenderly cared for in tho political nursery
Senator Quay seems very little con
cerned over the announcement that the
Bepublicans would hold with a mailed
hand the results of the November elec
tion Ho says that his party bcntitlcd to
a working majority in the next House
and no ono appearing to earnestly con
tradict him his decision will probably bo
sustained Matt Quay is a cry heavy
man weighed in the scales of tho present
Don Piatt author savant journalist
gentleman ii at Chamberlains and ap
pears in a card in the Post as to his opin
ion of the Kuckcr Blackburn duel Ho
holds that while Kucker is probably mis
taken with reference to what tho Prci
dent old him the condition of all tho
participants when they visited Mr Cleve
land was such that Mr Cleveland would
bo unable to recall tho episode w itli cer
tainty as to its details Donn revonge
fully concludes by attacking Barnum for
his inadequate conduct of the New York
campaign though what connection there
Hbetweeu tho two subjects doth not ap
pear
The Inaugural Committee held a secret
session on Saturday and tho Chairman of
linanco reported subscriptions received
to the amount of 30000 Tho number
of persons who exiect to make a fortune
by supplying tho thousands who will lx
present on March 4th with food and drink
is on the increase They eem to spring
from the ground
Hon Joseph Chamberhiu and his
bride nee Endicott and ord Sackvillo
and his two daughters started for homo
on tho Bourcone on Saturday Society
will not be comforted for such a loss
Noflooncr did the excitement over the
auction sale of tho British Ministers
effects subside than society wept for the
loss of his Lordships daughters Strange
to say tho atmosphere together with the
direction and velocity of tho wind re
main tho Bimo as if MJss Victoria and
Mte Amelia andtheerstwhjle Mis Mary
were still among U9
The success of tho Republican party Z
the polls has stimulated the faithful in
the District of Columbia The National
Republican for some time suffering a
partial eclipse being only permitted to
appear as a weekly will bo rejuvinatcd as
a daily Tho capital has been fully sub
scribed D W Fox will be editor
Whether or not the japcr will be suc
cessful remains to bo teen If it does
succeed its triumph will be entirely due
to Republican Government employes
The geographical position of Washington
makes the city Democratic and so far as
advertising and suburban circulation go
a Republican dally will alwavs have a
poor field to plow
The bill to place a bust of Chief Justice
Waite in tho row of marble busts of de
ceased Chief Justices in tho Supreme
Court room passed the Senate but was
hung up in the House An appropriation
of f5000 was allowed by the last Congress
for an oil jxjrlrait of Mr Waito to be
hung in the robing room It Is vaguely
hoped that the artist will bo more success
ful than the majority of those who have
painted portraits for the Gov crnment
A Heal IVecewddij
We presume there is hardly a lady to
Imj found in our broad land who if she
does not already possess a sewing ma
chine expects somc day to income the
owner of one
But after tho mind has been fully made
up to purchase ono of these indispensable
articles the question arises as to what
kind of a machine to buy
it should bo so simply constructed that
tho most inexperienced can successfully
operate it Tho other jwints mainly to
be considered and which are the most
desirable are durability rapidity capac
ity for work ease of operation regularity
of motion uniformity of tension and
dluncu w hije in ojeratiori
Tho Bight Running flow Home fills
tho above requirements and Is said to
combine the good points of all sewing
machines with the addition of many new
improvements and labor siving devices
The price is no higher than that of
other machines and every lady who is
the happy peweseor of ono may rest as
sured she has secured indeed a treasure
