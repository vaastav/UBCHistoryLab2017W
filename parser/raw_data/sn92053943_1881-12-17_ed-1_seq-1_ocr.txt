ENGLISH IDEAS.
London, Dec. 17. The Times in a lead
ing article on Blaine's dispatch concerning
the Clajton-Bulwer , treaty, says: "If in
ternational good faith Is to count for noth
ing, wifh what show of reason can '. "Eng
land be required to alloW the highway be
tween the two oceans to "be placed under
American control, and -ia war and peace
alike to be commanded by American guns?
Blainemust remember that freedom of
passage between two oceans can, in no
possible event, become . an . exclusively
American right. The whole world has an
interest in the maintenance of the free use
of a great highway."
HOTEL BUBNED.
SlEMPnia, Dec. 17. Peabody hotel took
fire this morning. The fire originated in
the kitchen during the breakfast hour.
The soot in a pipe over the boiler catching
fire sent a sheet of flame up the flue which
runs from the kitchen to the roof of the
house. The wall of the flue must have
been defective, for the flames -were soon
seen issuing from the roof, and in a very
short time, the western portion of the
building was. on fire: The prompt atten
dance of the fire department had its effect,
and after an hours' hard fight the fire was
gotten under control. The principal dam
age to the hotel will be from the water, al
though the kitchen, ..pantry and servants
quarters are ' badly : wrecked. 'The hotel
was filled with" guests! and ' the sounding
of the alarm was followed bya general
rush from the building.
The damage to the hotel will amount to
about $20,000; fully insured.
The business of the hotel will be con
tinued without stoppage.

OFFICIAL REPORT.
Vienna, Dec. 17. Official report on the
"m2 Theatre disaster says the chief engirt'
er asked two policemen at the main en
trance of the theatre whether " there was
anybody within and received a reply that
the whole audience left in safety. ' This
statement was apparently confirmed by
the fact that no persons were seen at the
entrance of the building. :i Men of the fire
brigade . subsequently made their way to
the galleries but air was suffocating and
it was impossible to penetrate the passages
as their torches went out for want of
oxygen, and the firemen were unable to
breathe. Report expresses conviction that
the audience died speedily from suffica
tion. ' ' ' " v- -:' "

"CONTINUED FROM TESTERDAf.
. "Washington, Dec. 16. General Rey
nolds read from notes he had taken on his
first interview with Guiteau. Quoting ' the
prisoner's words, he read : "If there is a
stalwart in the land I am he. Grant,
Conkling, Logan. and Governor Cornell are
big guns among the stalwarts, and I rank
with them."
Guiteau retorted: "I never said I could
rank with them, but as a matter of fact I
think I can."
A number of newspaper slips which wit
ness had read to the prisoner at this inter
view to show him what were the senti
ments of Grant, Conkling and others in
regard to his (prisoner's) crime, were
then read by District Attorney.
When the letter of General Grant's was
read, in which the writer, speaking of Gui
teau, said: "My son tells me he is a dead
beat" . . ,
Guiteau became very indignant andf
shouted: This is what Fred Gant says, 'he
is a nice pill, isn't he, hanging around his
father. I should say he is a bigger dead
beat than I am."
Another passage was read, which spoke
qf Guiteau's crime as a most audacious act.
Guiteau interrupted: "And so it was to
enter that depot and to shoot ' down the
President of the United States, surrounded
as he was by all his friends. I have won
dered at it a good many times how I ever
did it. I thought this morning I would
not undertake it again for a million of dol
lars; but I was in such a desperate state
of mind I could not resist it. I was impel
led by a pressure which I could not resist."
Ellen C. Grant was called, and Guiteau
shouteu: "Mrs. Grant is a lady. I boarded
with her prior to the 1st of July. She Is
a very fine lady and I owe her $47. I trust
I shall pay you soon Mrs. Grant; as soon
as these fellows holding fat offices shall
respond to my call (striking the table ex
citedly) I made them. If they don't soon
contribute I shall call out their names m
meeting."
"Witness never suspected the prisoner
was insane. -
Mrs. Anna J. Dunmire. Guiteau's divorc
ed wife, was then called. Several ladies
arose to leave the court room. Guiteau
"moved uneasily in his seat,, and looking
angrily at the audience cried out; "There
won't be any smut " in ; this examination',
ladies need not go out. They have no
business to put this woman on the stand.
unless Corkhill wants to stir un filth, i
say it is an outrage off decency for Cork
hill to rag this lady in here and have her
character ripped up as it will be. , Cork
hill ought to be" ashamed of himself . He
is worse than an old hag. I appeal to the
court to intercept this infamous action of
Corklull's- V, Arthur .ouyht to kick him out.
I made Arthur President, and - I -have a
right fo demand that he shall put some
reputable lawyer in place of this infamous
Corkhill."
Very much to the surprise of every one
but two or three questions were asked the
witness, and her statement in reply to the
last question, "I never saw any signs of
insanity in the prisoner while I liyed with
him as his wife," closed the examination
by the prosecution.
Guiteau, with a sigh of relief, said to
LCiarkhai:-"Thank you, Mr. Corkhill, for
the sake of her children. This is the most
decent thing you have done . in this trial.
I expect, however, that Judge Porter and
Davidge insisted on it, and they are -both'
supposed to be decent men." Then turn
ing impatiently to Scoville, "now cut this
short and let's have something else."
The cross examination of Mrs. Dunmire
was ttdioua and wholly fruitless "As be
left the stand Guiteau shouted after herr
"I havemot seen this lady for eight years.
So far as I 'know, she is a high-toned,
Christian lady, and I have nothing against
heiw.I wish her well ia whatever station
she must be.. 1 " " ; ,; ;.
Recess. " " y . J ,,.
Dr. Francis B. Loring, manager of the
Eye and Ear Infirmary at Washington, ex
amined Guiteau's eyes soon after lus arrest.
He did not find any indication jof a dis
cased brain. .
Mr. A. McLean Hamilton, of New Xork,
who had made diseases of the mind and
nerves a study for the past nine years,
made three examinations of the prisoner
attho jail; had closely scrutinized him in
court since the-28th of November; found
no defects in the physical conformation of
the prisoner's head or face, nor any physi
cal peculiarities or symptoms or congeni
tal disease of the brain. On the contrary,
he found from accurate measurements that
the prisoner had a symmetrical andexceed
ly well shaped head; found no external
evidence of anyfl mental or . physical dis
ease. Considered the" prisoner an" eccen
trie man. , : ';.
1 v; Guiteau ''Exceedrngly eoceatrifi when I
am abused. I've had to take more abusa
since this trial began than, during ' my I
whole life before. I don't take much
stock in this head business (striking the
table and flashing his eyes upon witness).
You study upon spirituology instead of
crancelogy, and you will learn something
of its spirit that gets into the brain, and
behind it that actuates man.
Witness , was asked: "What is your
opinion of the prisoner's sanity"
,,I believe the man sane, though eccen
tric and fully able to distinguish between
right and wrong, and realize the conse
quences. Scoville noted the exception and Gui
teau with an air of solemnity, added:
"With all respect to this court and jury,
this kind of examination does not amount
to a snap. Was my free agency destroyed,
that is the questioa for, this jury to de
cide. I swear my moral agency was de
stroyed;, hpw is this, prosecution going to
prove it was not. . That is all there ia in
this case. .: ;
Pending cross-examination the court ad
journed until Monday. ; ;.
CONGRESS YESTERDAY. ' ' ' " '
8ENAT.
Washington, Dec 16. Senator Hoar's
resolution for a special committee on wo
men's rights was opposed by Senator Vest
in the interest of economy. The Senate
had forty-one committees with idle mes
sengers and clerks. This committee would
necessitate six more messengers. The
Committees on Territories and Elections
were open to inquiry, and the Revolution
ary Claims Committee would do ample
justice to the subject.
Senator Vest proceeded to make a nu
merous speech on the appropriateness of
referring the woman suffrage to the Com
mittee on Revolutionary Claims, which had
only considered one bill in thirty years.
The committee was typical of the verse in
Watt's hymn:
"There shall I bathe my weary soul,
In seas of heavenly rest,
. And not a wave ol trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast." "
However, if a woman could get this com
mittee stirred up and get a report from
them, it would end the question forever,
because the public at large, himself includ
ed, would consider that such a proof of
female blandishment and influence, that
it would surrender at once, and female
suffrage would become constitutional and
legal. He moved to refer it to thf.t com
mittee. Lost 31 to 21.
Senator Bayard moved to refer it to the
Judiciary Committee, as being a subject
for grave legal consideration and present
ing questions not fit for discussion here.
Senator Logan, getting unanimous con
sent, urged that a special committee be ap
pointed, and although the morning hour
had expired. Senator Morrell asked that
the resolution be disposed of. '
Senator Voorhees objected.
Senator Jones, who had the floor on the
regular order of the Presidential succes
sion bill, yielded to Senator Voorhees, who
spoke on his resolution, referring to the
finance committee the recommendations in
the President's message on the silver ques
tion. He held that demonetization was a
potent factor in the depression of 1873.
He traversed the whole ground of panics,
tight money markets, greenbackism and
gold standard. By democratic measures
the currency had been expanded, rendered
stable and uniform, and the country was
prosperous. He characterized the recom
mendations of Secretary Folger for the
retirement of silver certificates, as a wan
ton and criminal, assault on the finan
cial stability and business , prosperity of
the whole country. It was proposed
to dcatroy S6C,0C0,000 of money,
and ti bare proportion would create a
paniqfr But Congress is wiser than the
President. It will pay no heed to the
recommendmuH!-- The Secretary evidently
wants to drive siivr entirejy out of circu
lation. He claims that he cannot circulate
the silyer in the vaults, yet he shows that
$60,000,000 of paper, based on this very
coin, is circulating freely. There are
$100,000,000 silver circulating, according
to his uncandid report, and yet he alleges
that silver is a drug and people do not
want it. The Secretary, with ignorant
complacency, says the national baaks,
those pitiless usurpers, can regulate the
currency of the country according to its
nmls; i;y issuing their notes. Senator
Voorhee ehsniently attacked the national
bank system.
l The resolution was agreed to.
On motion of : Senator Garland, the bill
legalizing the election of the Legislature of
New Jlexico, December 2d, 1880, was
passed. , ...
