The Senate, or General legislative Directory of Amer
ican Fenian ism, have again come on to New York to re
view the conduct of aflairs here by the occupants of the
central offices The session commenced yesterday at ten
o'clock, at 730 Broadway. There appears to be a general
opinion that the Senate will now thoroughly oxumine
into itio inattor of economy and faithfulness in the
executive departmental and the organization, demand
lug unusual probity and promptness at this time, seems
to be anxiously watching for t ho report of these general
representative stewards. Unusual interest attaches to
the meeting. It wHI, it is supposed, continue for several
days.
A tire, the origin of which is unknown, broke out be
tweon four and live o'clock yosterday morning among
some cotton on board the steamship Weyb.wsct, lying at
pier 13 North river, doing considerable damage to the
vessel and her cargo.
The stock market was firm yesterday. Governments
were steady. Gold closed at 148??.
Business was emphatically dull yesterday, the dis
turbing Influences of tho election, together with the
anx'nty about the tariff and currency questions, acting
as a hindrance to commercial transactions. Groceries
were dull. Cotton was quiet. Petroleum was steady.
On 'Change Hour was decidedly lower. Wheat was also
lower. Corn wm la good demand aud quite steady.
Pork Was irregular, closing lower. Beef was steady.
Lard was dull, nominal and a shade lower. Whiskey was
entirely nominal, with scarcely any demand.
Tho market for beef cattle was flrmer this week lor
prim" steers, and some of the choicest offerings brought
as high as 19c. per pound. Other kinds varied from 10c.
to 17c., generally 13e. a 17c. Milch cows were steady at
from $40 to $100 a $150, the latter rate for One thorough
bred cows, with calves at their side. Veals were steady at
10c a 14c. Sheep and lambs were dull and lower, vary
ing from $3 75 to $8 50. Bogs sold at from 10c. to
lOJ^C. The total receipts were 6,133 beeves, H9 cows,
G6'> veals. 24,546 sheep and lambs, and about 30,000 hogs.
The Prralclt-nt'a Menace- The State ol
Iht Country.
The President's Message, which we publish
this morning, with other important public doc
uments will commend itself to the special at
tention of the render and to the general appro
val of the American people. It is a smoothly
written State paper. It embodies a clear,
frank and unreserved exposition of the views
and purposes by which he has been guided in
his policy of Southern restoration, an encour
aging exhibit of the state of the country and
various recommendations to Congress upon
the leading questions of the day which mark
the earnest patriot, the sagacious and experi
enced statesman, and the steadfast and con
sistent man of the people.
He reverses the usual order of these mes
sages, and very properly, by beginning
with our domestic affairs and giving
our foreign relations a secondary po
sition. His statement of the constitutional
considerations which have shaped his proceed
ing3 in the way of Southern reconstruction we
regard us a conclusive vindication of his
course. Resting his line of action and his
justification upon the solid ground that the
States involved in the late rebellion have not
been destroyed by it, though their vitality has
been impaired, and their functions suspended,
he could hardly go astray. He presents very
satisfactorily the nice distinctions between I
State rights and State heresies, the sovereignly
of the Uuion, the relations of the States and
the supreme powers and rights of the people
of the United States; and thus shows that in
i what he has done towards Southern restoration,
and in what be has declined to do, be ia sus
tained by the federal constitution. Upon the
vexed question of negro suffrage, especially,
his justification is complete and overwhelming;
and so in regard to the earliest possible ratifi
cation by the required three-fourths of the
States of the great constitutional amendment
for the permanent abolition of slavery through
out the Union.
The Message furnishes ns tbe desired expla
nation of the detention of Jeff. Davis as a pris
oner at Fortress Monroe. There are difficulties
in the way to his trial in Virginia, and it has
"been ascertained on inquiry that the Circuit
Court of the United States would not be held
within the district of Virginia during the
autumn or early winter, nor until Congress
should have an opportunity to considor^and act j
on the whole subject" President Johnson, how
ever, adheres to his opinion that "traitor'
should be punished and the crime made
infamous," and that, through a fair trial, the
question should be judicially settled, finally
and forever, that no State, of its own will, has
the right to renounce its place in the Union."
Jeff. Davis, therefore, is held over lor this pur
pose, and he must be content in regard to his
trial to await the action of Congress.
Tbe operations of the Interior and Post Office
Departments exhibit gratifying prosperity; in j
tbe Navy and War Departments we have
a very gratifying retrenchment of expendi- J
tures? in tbe War Department alone, from
the mustering out of eight hundred thousand 1
soldiers, a retrenchment from over five bun- '
dred millions to lesa than forty millions a year
expenses. Tbe views of the Message in refer
ence to the national finances, debt and cur
rency are those of safety and solvency, and
cannot be too carefully adhered to in tbe leg
islation of Congress, especially aa to the pre
cau ions necessary to avoid any sudden and
damaging financial disturbances.
Our relations with England, as presented by
tbe President, are anything bnt satisfactory,
wblle hia opinions in regard to ths flagitious
character of those Anglo-rebel depredations on
American commerce during tbe late war are
all that could be deaired. Great Britain hav
ing refaaed the arbitration proposed, and onr
government having declined Karl Russell's
proposed de-nothing commission, the matter
thus rests. We presume, however, that it will 1
not rest very long in this position.
With regard to Mexico, af|->r a general {
reaffirmation of the Monroe doctrine, all that
we have from tbe Message ia that "tbe corre
spondence between the United States and
France will at a proper time be laid before
Congress."' With that correspondence we ex
pect, too. that President Johnson will have
something more to say. Assured that be is
fixed in the faith of the Monroe doctrine, we
in'er that if he delays action it is from tbe per- j
suasion that Louis Napoleon, with the conces
sion ol a little time, will gracefally retire.
He have touched upon tbe leading business
features of the Mewage. Its general observa
tions on the beauty and strength of onr popular
institutions, and the manifest destiny of the
country, mark the patriotic spirit and con
fidence of President Johnson in the great dutiea
of his office. We see nothing in the Messngc j
calculated to lead to a conflict with Congress,
excepting tbe question of negro suflrsRe, and
upon this an issue will probably be avoided,
as it is an Issue upon which the Kxecutive holds
the power of tbv pcoolc. florth and South.
Tfc? CUy BlMtlM.
The facta and figures in couneotton with the
charter election yesterday will be found in our
newa columns. Mr. John T. Hoffman is elected
Mayor of New York by orer thirteen hundred
majority over Mr. Marshall O. Roberts, the re
publican candidate. This majority is surpris
ingly small, and Mr. Roberts has polled an
astonishingly large vote. As we predicted,
both Hecker and Gunther are nowhere. When
the Mo ear to re iound that Hecker had no chance,
they bolted him and his flour, and went orer
in a body to Hoffman. Gunther musters mere
ly a corporal's guard of six thousand, composed
of personal friends, genuine Germans and un
mitigated copperheads in about equal propor
tions. Had It not bocn for the sell-out of the,
Mocarters Mr. Roberts would hare been elected
and at* it is he has shown more strength than any
previous republican candidate. Greeley and
Fernando Wood hare completely crushed
Hocker, the so-called "reform" candidate, be
tween them. Their unholy alliance did hiro
more harm than good. From the returns ho
must have received very little of the Mozart
vote, and still less of the republican. Un
doubtedly he was put into the market by his
supporters to be knocked down to the highest
bidder. It only remains to be added that out of
one hundred and five thousand votes registered
only about eighty thousand were polled, and
that an immense amount of money changed
hands on the election, the republicans being
heavy losers, as they offered large odds. We
may congratulate our citizens upon having
secured a Mayor of great experience and un
blemished character, and can now patiently
await that action of the Legislature which will
give us the reform in the departments of the
city government so imperatively demanded by j
the majority of our voting and taxpaying popu
lation.
The Condition of (he National Paper?
deport of the Comptroller of the Cur
rency.
The facts presented in the report of the
Comptroller of the Currency will surprise the
country and damage a great many theories
and propositions for the reduction of the
amount of paper money afloat The theories
have all assumed that the amount of paper in
circulation was a thousand millions, and their
calculations are based on that sum. But it id
now shown that while the whole available cur
rency of the country, State and national bank
notes, and Treasury notes of all grades, is nine
hundred and sixty millions, the amount actually
in circulation on the first of last October was
less than four hundred and sixty-one millions.
This fact will be a serious blow to the financial
theories of those learned fellows who have so
persistently urged an immediate reduction of
the currency as the grand cure for the evil of
high prices. It is also shown that the amount
of national bank notes in circulaiion is smaller
than any estimates have made it It has been
thought that there were afloat ten millions in
excess of the three hundred millions authorized
by law. But instead of this there are hardly
bonds enough deposited to cntitlr those insti
tutions to iasun two hundred aud forty -five m'!
lions, thus leaving a large balance in their
favor.
The Comptroller enters extensively into the
discussion of the several questions which boar
upon the condition of the currency. Like the
Secretary of the Treasury, he has a great deal
to say about contraction. He recommends that
tho National Banking law be so amended that
the banks shall be required to redeem their
notes at par at the three great business centres ?
New York, Boston and Philadelphia. This
question has already been very extensively
advocated in some financial circles, and opposed
in others, and now goes before Congress
with the official endorsement of the govern
ment banking officer. He also urges the
reduction of the government issues of paper,
nnd proposes to commence it by the conver
sion of all the interest-bearing legal tender
notes into fivo-twenty six per cent bonds.
This, he argues, can be done without affecting
the money market, inasmuch as there is not
more than five per cent of (hit issue now in
active circulation. The great bulk being held
as an investment, it would be simply exchang
ing one class of securities for another. While
be favors this induction in the government
' issues, he also recommends an increase of the
amount of the national bank notes to tour
hundred millions. In effecting this he would
require a reduction of the regular legal tender
j notes to an amount more than equivalent to
the increase in bank currency. Tbe policy of
the financial officers of the government evi
dently is to leave the question of supplying
paper currency to the banks exolnalvely at as
early a period as possible. This recommenda
tion of tbe Comptroller is no doubt the initia
tory step in this policy. If It receives the
i endorsement of Congress it will be gradnally
' put into operation; but all must admit that tbe
legal tenders cannot be withdrawn until we
again approach apecie payments, which must,
by the very nature of things, necessarily be at
some distant day in tbe future.
There is one other proposition in this report
that will no doubt attract considerable atten
tiou and be the subject of diacuaaion. That is
a plan for tbe payment of the national debt
Mr. Clarke givaa it as his belief that there can
be raised from a fow sources of revenue suffi
cient to meet the interest on the public debt,
pay the ordinary expenses of tbe government,
and contribute an amount annually towards
a sinking fond which will pay our entire
national debt In thirty-two year*, and at the
same time aboliah tbe Incone tax. This will
no doubt astonish those growlers who have
been claiming that we can never pay our debt
and that repudiation ia inevitable. But be pur
; poses to do this by adjusting our tariff, taxing
! cotton, whiskey, malt liquors, domestic wines,
tobacco, stamps snd licenses, and abolishing
all others. As this mode would be lew felt by
the taxpayer than the present system we pre
sume that it will be popular among a large
class of the Northern people. But it will at
the same time abolish a large army of officials,
in the shape of assessors and collectors, and
| there may be some question as to which clnss,
the taxpayers or the taxgatberera, will have
the greatest influence in Congress.
Tbe question which has already been raised
in many of the Northern Legislatures in regard
to taxing United States securities, and that has
entered to a greater or leas extent into the
political canvass of soma of the States, is dwelt
npon quite extensively, and a mode pointed
out by which the whole difficulty can be ad
justed in a few years without danger to the
i public faith. Taken altogether this is an en
I couraging exhibit, and baa manv fcatuiM U>
commend it to the people ind to Congre* It
?bows that the Department h" been adminis
tered with a view to protect the public inter
eats rather than for the special benefit of bank
speculators.
The Tnatarj Report.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
is a comprehensive review of the financial
situation, in which be freely expresses his views
and makes such suggestions to Congress as he
considers best calculated to gradually eman
cipate the country from the evils inseparable
from an enormous national debt and an in
flated and depreciated currency. He moralises
like one who, disliking his surroundings, sighs
for some Utopia which he knows to be beyond
bin reach. He regrets the plethora of p:iper
money, and sees that it is undermining the
morals of the people by encouraging waste
and extravagance, and the only remedy, in bis
opinion, is a reduction of the currency. But
elsewhere he qualifies his opinion by saying that
a very rapid reduction of it would be disastrous,
though there is no reason to apprehend that
any policy which Congress may adopt will
cause such a rapid reduction of prices as to
produce very serious embarrassments to trade,
and that the influences of funding upon the
monoy markot will sufficiently prevent the too |
rapid withdrawal of legal tenders.
He estimates that the public debt will
amount on the 1st of July next to three thou
sand millions, but the unsettled and accruing
claims against the government cannot now be
computed. Meanwhile he observes that if the
expenditures for the remaining three-quarters
of the present fiscal year prove equal to the
estimates there will be a deficiency to be
provided for by loans of $112,194,947, ex
clusive of $32,536,901 of five per cent notes,
a portion of which is now in process of
redemption. Hence ho asks for power to
sell six per cent bonds to provido the
means of meeting this deficiency, as well
as to retire compound interest notes, as thoy
mature, and plain legal tenders. He cannot
understand bow the funding of currency can
fail to reduce prices; but the example of it
which be has already furnished haw shown that
at least it does not affect the price of gold,
while, without lowering the price of the neces
saries of life, it exerts a depressing influence
upon government securities. This is because
there is a public distrust of the worth of the
remainder of the currency as compared with
gold. Ho does not formally endorse the re
commendation of the Comptroller of the
Currency for a further issue of national
bank currency; but he admits that
the South is in* great want of bank
circulation, and regrets that the North re
ceived the whole of the authorized three hun
dred millions. He recognises his own power
lei&ness, beyond a very narrow limit, when he
r marks that there is more danger to be appro
honde 1 from the inability of the government to
reduce its circulation rapidly enough than from
a too rapid reduction of it; and it is in part to
prevent a financial crisis that is certain to come
without it that the Secretary recommends oon
t<ncti'>u- He places great reliance upon the
revenue, and suggests the propiicty of funding
the entire indebtedness of the nation into five
per cont perpetual annuities, tho interest of
which, supposing tho debt to be throe thousand
millions, would be one hundred and fifty mil
lions per annum. By the application of one
hundred millions to the payment of the prin
cipal, he shows that the debt would bo extin
guished in a little over twenty-eight years.
Without entering into further details, how
ever, we may say that the report is, on the
whole, conservative, and calculated to soothe
rather than excite apprehensions of the adop
tion of radical measures.
Report of the CommlMtoMr of Internal
RtTtane.
The report ot the Comminsioner of Internal
Revenue is an interesting and important docu
ment The Commissioner speaks in favorable
terms of the patience ot the people under the
burdens ot taxation, and show:) from statistics
that the aggregate receipts have for the past
fiscal year been largely above those of the pre
vious year. The following statement exhibits
the amount of receipts from internal revenue
for the past three years:? Receipts for 1863
(ten months), $41,003,192; 1864, $1 16,850,672;
1865, $211,129,528. The Commissioner uiys
the actual cost of assessing and collecting the
internal revenue will amount to two and three
quarters per cent ot the receipts. The actual
annual cost for the collection of the customs
amounts to throe and one-half per cent of the
receipts, which is much below the cost of col
lecting the customs in Great Britain. Among
the articles from which the internal revenue of
the United States is derived it may be interest
ing to enumerate the following:? Bank divi
dends, $3,987,200; railroad dividends and
interest on bonds, $3,258,404; insurance com
panies, $1,726,160; salaries of persons em
ployed by the government, $2,836,333;
revenue stamps, $11,162,302 ? being more
than double that of the previous year;
licenses, $12,595,691; incomes, $20,567,340, or
about six millions more than in 1864. Of
the amount collected from incomes in 1863
$279,333 were returned at five per cent upon
incomes above ten thousand dollars, $172,770
at three per rent upon Incomes of less than ten
thousand dollars, and $3,637 upon incomes
from United States securities. Of that collected
in 1864 $6,913,834 were returned at five per
cent, $7 ,930,070 at three per cent, and $75,373
at one and one-half per cent Of that col
lected in 1866 $801,941 were returned at ten
per cent $9,934,748 at five per cent, $9,697,246
at three per cent sod $133,402 at one and one
half per cent The receipts from iron and
steel, in the various forms specifically named,
were $9,219,713, or nearly six millions more
than the previous year; from refined petroleum
and coal oil. $3,047,212, being an increase of
about $800,000 ovur 1864; cigars, $3,069,448
tobacco, $8,016,119; fermented liquors, $3,657,
091; distilled spirits, $15,995,633. or nearly
thirteen millions loss than the previous year.
The Commissioner devotes a considerable por
tion of his report to explaining why the re
ceipts from distilled spirits, with a tax of two
dollars per gallon, &re so much less than they
were when the tax was but sixty cents per
gallon. The receipts for the current fiscal year
are estimated to reach $272,000,000, or about
sixty millions more than last year. The Com
missioner wggests an alteration in the mode
of appointing assistant assessors, urgos an
increase in their compensation, as well as in
that of the clerks employed in the Internal
Revenue Bureau. An additional allowance for
oiftce rent if also recommended. The Gommis
?toner suggests several amendments in relation
to stamp duties, the duties of the Tax Commie
lionera, and other changes in the lair, whereby
doubtful points can be definitely settled.
The Report of the Secret mrj mt War.
Secretary Stanton's report is important in
two points of view? Unit, as it relates the his
tory of the final events of the war, and pre
sents some remarkable facts in relation to that
history; and, second, as it showa the wonderful
capabilities of the country for war, and Indi
cates what we can do if suddenly called upon
to defend our rights or assert the national dig
nity. In the latter view it glances quite, directly
at the Mcxican question, and will reassure all
thoso who regret that our army has been so far
disbanded while that question has not yet been
brought to a definite issue.
The military history of the great campaigns
that gave us the victory is left to General
Grant; the Secretary is satisfied to state results
in that respect; but he bears with natural em
phasis on the rapid change brought about
through his department from war to peace ? on
the noiseless, effective, almost immediate oblit
eration of a vast army which the theorists of
the Old World had declared would in the hour
of victory prove more dangerous to our liber
ties than the rebellion It had been required to
put down. " The national military force," says
the report " on the first of May, 1865, numbered
one million five hundred and sixteen men.
It is proposed to reduce tho military
establishment to fifty thousand troops, and
over eight hundred thousand have already
been mustered out of service." The mili
tary appropriations of the last session
of Congress were over five hundred millions of
dollar*. The military estimates for the next
year are loss than thirty-four millions. This is
a result of victories that tho taxpayer can ap
preciate. Some of the figures given enable us
to realize tho enormous expenditures incident
to an army of a million men. Thus a large
slice of the national debt is well accounted for
when we learn that more than a thousand mil
lion dollars have been paid to the soldiers.
Two hundred and seventy millions were taken
home by the eight hundred thousand men lately
mustered out Some of the draft figures have I
also considerable interest Tho number of
men asked for by government te pat down the
rebellion was, 011 all calls together, 2,759,049,
and the number of men actually brought out
was only 102,496 short of this. This deficiency
was not from failure, but occurred because the
recruiting was stopped by the end of the war.
What the Secretary says as to our ability to
organize another army, if circumstances should
require it, has a national interest at the present
time. He states that the estimate for tLe army,
ns given above, "is believed to be adequate for
any national exigency, it the country should be
blessed with poaco. The reduction of the na
tional military force, in its rapidity and num
bers, is without example, and if there
be any alarm in the public mind be
oause this redaction is made while grave
questions at home and abroad are unset
tled, a brief consideration of the subject
will show that there is no oauae for apprehen
sion." The Secretary then runs over the facta
that the troops disbanded were volunteers, who
came out originally to support the govern
ment; that their struggles in its cause have
not lessened their love for it, and that " a for
eign war would intensify the national feeling,
and thousands, once misled, would rejoice to
atone their error by rallying to the national
flag." The only question relating to troops is
one with respect to how soon we could raise
them. "Our experience on this point," says
the report "is significant When Lee's army
surrendered thousands of recruits were
pouring in, and men were discharged from
stations in every State. On several occasions,
when troops were promptly needed to avert
impending disaster, vigorous exertion brought
them Into the field from remote States with in
credible speed. Official reports show that after
the disasters on the Peninsula, in 18G2, over
eighty thousand troops were enlisted, organ
ized, armed, equipped and sent into the field
in less than a month. Sixty thousand troops
have repeatedly gone to the field within four
weeks. Ninety thousand infantry were sent to
the armies from the five Stales of Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, Iowa and Wiggoqain within twenty
days.' And it is shownthat in all other re
spect we are as ready for war as we were be
fore our vast army went home.
These facta will make the report very inter
esting to Maxlntillian and to hi* friends in
France. In all respecta it ia an important
document, and will especially be recognised in
its groupings of facta as a valuable contribu
tion towards the history of the war.

The Senate o t i he American Fenian Brotbertiood met
yesterday At ten A. M. , at 730 Broadway, to take so
other survey of bow the executive matters of the or^sa
iZHiion have been going sod of what is best to bo dooo

These men were selocted from the body of tbe organi
zation. They come from the severs! State*, aro practice
business men, of character and capacity ; and, with few of
the drawbacks ol the professional patriots, thoy possosn
tiie positive straightforwardness of the working yeo
manry, whence tbe financial sinews proceed. Coming
from the several portions of tbe country, with the viown
of their sections and of the representative congress friwh
with them, thoy experienced many difficulties in giving
practical operation in this city to the views of the distant
workers. From an article on the Congress in m
weekly paper, it seems that the representative men
from the body of the organisation did not easily fail iu
rapport with the views of their officials, who, it was
argued, having passed years within the walla of the Now
York offices, could scarcely form as good on idea of the
wants and opinions of the local circlos as the mon whom
they had just selocted from their own immediate con
tact.
PROBABLE OBJECTS Or THB MEETING ? THB
FINANCES ? ECONOMY, ETC.
The meeting of this Fenian Directory at this time
seems in every way remarkable and significant The
space of time transpiring between the adjournment and
this assembling is unprecedentodly abort Some gravo
matters must be on the tapis. Tbe assembling of tba
Fenian Legislature Is of aa much importance
to the hundreds of thousands who toil and swat to work
out a good oiyect through a prompt and economic appli
cation of the hard earnings they contrioute as is that of
tbo American Congress to our people.
The appointments under the new constitution have
never be. n officially announced. The appointing power
rests in the President (Mr. O'Mahony); the Henata
confirms. The public have bad no intimation of
the new financial management, if we may oxcopt
the information conveyed by the hostile correspon
dence with the oditer of the New York Timrt ?
namely, that next to Mr. O'Mahony in U?e management
stood H. D. KilHan, a member of the organization from
Kentucky, we believe, who took part in the application
for John Mitchell's release, and soon after raine to this
city, where, it apiiears, he was appointed to a financial
position in tho headquarters.
In connection with the matters of finances and econ
omy, Ac., the Fenians express more or less distinctly
an astonishment at the reportod splendor of tho new
establishment on Union square, assuming that such mag
nilicence must necessarily Impose a heavy draft on tha
more hard-fisted revolutionary departments.
TIIR BONDS, ETC.? THB EAGER WORKERS IN TBI
DISTANCE.
The bonds of the Irish republic, whose sale was ex
r-ted to be a rushing excitement by this timo, seem to
making no stir whatever. We have not seeu the addrean
of tho Dublin authorities regarding the bond loan which
the New York Head Centre in his Philadelphia address^
published In the Hmuu>, announced as being under re
vision and about to issue. The tlmos In Ireland, too, seem
to be getting too hot for tho loaders there; and it soema,
under the circumstances, that matters at tbe central poet
should bo very brisk at this precise time.
It may be to see about one or all of these matters that
the men composing the 8enato have oorae on to New
York. At all events the session is most undoubtedly Ula
crisis of the organization, and many an eager eye will
cast its glance over a thousand miles of soa and land
toward this Senate meeting for some bright and promisj
ing light
THB SESSION YS8TKUDAV.
Tlie session Is not held in the Union square building,
nor in the hall which tbo city circles occupy, at <TM
Broadway, whero the Senato last met. The oontignitf to
the offices of the President and finanoe mon, however,
seems to be sufficient to onable the senators to cotnmu
nicate with tboee parties whenever books, vouchers 01
other exhibits are required in the examination which itit
expected will be instituted into aflkirs. Yesterday's ses
sion did not result in any business which is, as yet, to b?
given to tbe press. As the body will probably be nl
work for several days it is expocted that regular instal
ments will be given when publicity seams not injurious.
