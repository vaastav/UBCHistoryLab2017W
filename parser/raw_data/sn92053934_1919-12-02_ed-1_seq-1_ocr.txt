for the . unrest "are eupernciai

they "arise from or are connected
with the failure on the part of your
government to arrive speedily at a
juat, and permanent peace permit
ting return to normal conditions,
from the transfusion of radical the
orise from seething European cen
ters pending such delay, from
heartless proflteerng resulting
from the increase of the cost of
living,' and lastly, from the machi
nation of passionate and malev
olent agitators. iWth the return
to normal conditions this unrest
will rapidly disappear."
The president renewed his rec

Several recommendations, some
renewals of previous ones, were

them were extension of ,the food
control law to peace times for the
emergency; regulations for trans
ports ton of foods in Interstate
commerce, m cold storage law
modeled after the law in New Jer

: Better labor's Lot ;;
A long porpon or the message
waa devoted to a discussion of the
condition and rights of labor. "A
definite program to bring about an

recommended.

INTO DANGERS
ON ALL SIDES
Should Impress Congress
With Need for Getting
Down to Work.
' BT DATID LAWRENCE.
' Special to The Argus.) i
Washington. D. C, Dec. 2. There
is no exaggerating the seriousness
of the picture that presents itself
as congress comes back into ses
sion. Helpless in some respects.
hopeless in others, the government
is divided by party strife and po
litical ambition, while the economic
factors that are keeping the cost of
living high and may send it even
higher are uncontrolled. President
Wilson has written his message
and. though greatly Improved in
health he la still, unable to leave
the White house. He still believes
that at the bottom of America's ills
is that unratified peace treaty. '
Reports from Europe, are dis
quieting. European governments
are telling the United States gov
ernment that the future looks dark,
that industrial and maaa unrest is
spreading and that America, upon
whom they had relied to help them
to their feet after the moat terrible
war In history, was now apparently
going back on them. Congress it
self la deaf to the pleas of foreign
governments. Already a sentiment
la rieing to Ignore Europe and at
tend to domestic affairs.
Approach Labor War. '
Inside the United State the coal
situation is menacmn. Congress is
looking on while , the, executive

ing union labor Is making such a
big fight against the miners as to
hearten those who think now Is the
time and America is the place to
stop a rising tide of socialism.
There are those who go so far as
to believe that America ought to
use the opportunity presented by
the Jenkins case to have war with
Mexico in order" to solidify the
country and revive the war time
restrictions on prices and suddIIos.
There is no reason to believe the
president himself has changed his
mind about Intervening In Mexico
but congress Is represented as

remove the grievances," said the
president's message.
At another point it declared "the
seed of revolution is repression."
- "The establishment of the orin-
ciplea regarding labor, laid down
in the League of Nations," said the
message, "offers us the way to in
dustrial peace and conciliation. No
other road lies open to us. Gov
ernments must recognize the rights
of men to bargain collectively for
humane oblecta. . i.hnr no
longer must be treated aa a com- ;
modify. . - .
"The right of Individuals to
strike la inviolate," continued the
message, "and ought not to be In
terfered with by any process of
government, but there la a predom
inant right, and that la the right of
the government to protect all of
its people, and to assert its' power:
and majesty against the challenge
of any class."
The president waa referring to
the government's recent Injunction
against the coal strike.
Russia as Object Lessen. .
The message closed with a point
ed reference to radicalism and red
doctrines and referred to "Russia
today 'with its blood and terror" aa
a "painrui ooject lesson oi me pow
er of minorities."
"There are those in this coun
try," said the' message, "who
threaten direct action to force their
will upon America. It makes
little difference what minority it
is; whether capital or labor, or
any -other class; no sort of priv
ilege will ever be permitted to
dominate this country." --
Mast Keep Order.
Orderly processes, the message
declared, were the only ones by
which relief and reform could be
obtained. ' ' ; - . -
"Those who would propose any
other methods of reform are ene
mies of this country," the message
said. " let those beware who
take the shorter road of disorder
and revolution." ';, V .
