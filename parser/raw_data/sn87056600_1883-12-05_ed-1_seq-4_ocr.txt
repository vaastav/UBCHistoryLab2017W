How the Republicans do squirm over Mr.
KandaU's defeat
V have kept our Weekly back one day
in order to furnish our subscribers with toe
President's Message.
The organs, some of them at least, see
"business" ahead for the Republican party
next vear in Mr. Carlisle's nomination.
MUST UANO.
According to reports, O'Donnell, who re
quired Carey, the infamous informer,
to hand in his checks, will have to
yield up his own life. The British Gov
ernment has concluded to hang him.
No one is disappointed. The trial
was a farce. In a right, O'Donnell killed a
human monster deserving universal execra
tion a murderer, a coward and a liar, but
fctill a creature receiving the fostering care of
the British Government, because, to his
other crimes, he added that of informer.
Carey was the enemy of Ireland; O'Donnell
t'io friend of tbat distressed country;
hence England loves the one and
murders the other. It is not stir
pricing that under such circumstances
urrsiuite is found hidden away in various
places in England or that explosions occa
sionally occur, but it is a matter of amaze
ment that dynamite explosions are not more
frequent in England. The English Govern
ment long ago determined to crush all as
pirations for liberty out of Ireland. Rob
bery, murder, imprisonment, poverty, fam
ine and exile have 11 played conspicuous
parts ia England's rule In Ireland. At last
that sort of domination has reached .the
dynamite level. It seems to be natoral, and
now that O'Donnell Is to suffer death the
probabilities are that more dynamite will be
brought into requisition. England invites
that sort of a contest and Ireland seems dis
posed to accept the challenge.
THE POSITION OP THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
Republican organs are not happy when
contemplating the position occupied by the
Democratic party, but they do rejoice ex
ceedingly when they discover, or think they
hare espied, a rock upon which the Demo
cratic ship may be wrecked, and they work
like leavers when building a dam, for the
purpose of swerving the Democratic party
from, a course which promises supremacy.
The campaign of 1832, which brought the
Democratic party into power, was fought dis
tinctively on a platform of reform, and
prominently tariff reform; not free trade,
but ratr.a trade. The Republican party,
then in control of both House
of Congress, heard the bugle blast for re
form and attacked the tariff iniquity, and
when they got through with their work not
oae siale abomination had been removed,
and, in many instances, the tariff was more
objectionable than when their tampering
was begun. The Republican managers went
at the tariff reform enterprise for the pur
pose of heading off the Democratic party
when it should take possession of the House,
and now they are engaged in proclaiming
that further tariff reform is not required.
and Mr. Hin dal 1, of Pennsylvania, sires
them to understand that the Democratic
party is in sympathy with them. But the
Forty-eighth Congress was elected to
inaugurate tariff reform, to revise torifT
taxation, and to deal honestly with the peo
ple. A large surplus revenue is to be gotten
rid of by reducing the taxation. The people
demand that they shall not be burdened
with taxation to create a surplus revenue to
be squandered or stolen. They demand
economy, and the Democratic party Is
pledged to bring forward measures that will
result ia far reaching reforms. The position
Two Weekly Kevspapers
of the Democratic party before the country
could scarcely b improved. It haa made
no pledges that are not eminently in keep
ing with tie public wcilare. Having mad
s the pledges, the whole matter is reduced to
the, proposition. V .Keep': them inviolate.,
this done, the party wins in 1S31 with
scarcely a doubt.' The first more 'in' that
direction will be tie election of Sjaker
about whose purposes in the line of reform
there can be no doubt Mr. Randall is not
that man, and because lie ia not, the Repub
licans favor bia election. It now appears
tbat Mr. Carlisle lias ajarger following than
any other roan whose name Iis been seri
ously associated with the Speakership. He
fills the bill. .With him for Speaker, the
Democratic party attests its devotion to
principle and grandly advances towards vic
tory iu 1884.
THH PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The State paper, to be known a Chester
A. Arthur's message to th? rourtv-eishth
Congress, we lay before oar readers this
morning, and ask for it" respectful consider
ation. There is nothing in it startling. Its
statements are doubtless well enough, but
they are commonplace, and the reproduction
of ideas and arguments which bare been
hashed and rehashed by the press of the
country during the iast six months or
more. All that pertains to -the
foreign policy of the Republic wilt create
little interest, except in &o far as our com
mercial relations with Mexico are mentioned
and more favorable reflations urged. The
President devotes considerable space to the
subject of finance, and expresses the opinion
that at the present rate of taxation a surplus
of $00,000,000 will be annually created. To
get rid of this surplus, in part, he recom
mends the abolition of all
internal revenue taxes, except on the
one article of distilled spirits.
that is to say, the tax on tobacco and malt !
linnnra hnnlr rirriildtinn etr ImiI there ia nn '
word urging a reduction of the tax on the
necessities of life. Deep solicitude is express
ed for the National Banks, and an intima
tion is made that the public debt should be
perpetuated for their convenience and profit.
Reference is made to the decision of the He-
i publican Supreme Coui ton Civil Rights, and
I an avowal is made of a willingness to aid
Congress in perfecting legislation
to secure the Mlitical rights of all the peo
ple. The President is very robust in his
views relating to polygamy, and favors the
idea of abolishing the Territorial Govern
ment of Utah. The message lacks breadth
and depth, but In the.se regards no one will
be disappointed. Arthur is eiinply a ma
chine politician. His intimate associations
have hitherto been with men ot the Dorsey
stripe, and the simple word "soap" illuv
trates his statesmanship. We shall refer to
the subject again.
THE SPEAKERSHIP.
To-day Hon. John G." Carlisle, of Ken
tucky, by the unanimous voice of the Demo
cratic majority in the popular branch of Con
gress, takes the place of Speaker. A better
choice could not bare been made. It is the
first gun for the Democratic victory in 1MI.
The election of Mr. Carlisle has wonderful
significance. To discuss it from a personal
standpoint would be not only discourteous,
but degrading. If Mr. Carlisle's triumph
were simply a victory over Messrs. Randall
and Cox it woo Id be devoid of interest, ex
cept to the immediate friends of the pnrties
concerned. Such considerations we dismiss.
The election of Mr. Carlisle is, in so
far as it voices I-ernocratic ideas, a
bugle blast for tariff reform. It means
a reduction of taxation It means an
economical administration of the Govern
ment. It means getting rid of an excessive
surplus in the Treasury to be squandered or
stolen. It means that the people shall not
he hardened with unnecessary taxation. It
means that monopolies shall no longer thrive
by extorting tribute money from the maws
of the people, and it means that the Demo
cratic party has determined to redeem its
pledges to the people. The old Democratic
battle cry was, "measures not men," and the
election of Mr. Carlisle is a guarantee that
in so far as lie can sliaj-e legislation, meas
ures will be brought forward calculated toad
vance the general welfare of the country.
Mr. Carlisle I credited with possessing
every requisite for the important position of
Speaker. He is a man of lowering abilities
a statesman of broad views, and as a preside
ing officer intimately familiar not only with
its dnties, but of such wonderful mental
equipoise that a paliarnentary beJlam can
not disturb him. The gavel in the hands of
Carlisle will be respected, and the rights (
members without regard to party will be re
spected. The Democratic party and the
whole country are to be congratulated upon
the election of Mr. Carlisle Indiana had
n'me Totes to cast, and it is eminently satis
factory to know that the distinguished Ken
tuckian received seven of them. That is
well done for Indiana.

"TIOXAL Bigs'
In regard to the recommeodattons I bare to
make of n looile of keeping National Hank uotna in
circulation without loss to tbe banks thereby, and
with isifetr to the Cuveruiut-ot, I assume that the
National 11 nk system la now adjudged to be a
Conrtitutlonal creation of the Leerialative power,
and that the country has acquiesced In It as such ;
that It Is looked upon with favor by the greater
part of tbe people! ami that there la almoat a uni
versal desire to continue the circulation of these
notea. as a couvenlenre aud a benefit which It
vnuld Irk us to be without. -
I am not iu favjv ot anything but the intereit
bi arlng obligations of tbe l ulled States Govern
mrnl. .
Du re aro proportions, the vertebral Idea of
which la the creation of a new form of pnbllc
debt. A plausible one la. for the government to
otter a new bond, of its own Inane, at a low rate of
Innrem, to run for a tons period, in exchange for
its 4 torrents aiidt per rent',' allowing such a
rste of premlnu on tne latter, but lower than that
at present rutin, a would induce tue holders le
surrender thou aal take the osw ; and to make
thia a security for bank circulation. I doubt not
this ia lettable In that way a boldnr of ttaa l
jt could capitalize tbe premium allowed on hi
bond, and draw interest at the near rate on tbat as
well as on the priocipl, whereby lüere will be an
inducemer.t to excaniijre. rather tliaa to hold, or,
in the present difticulty of desirable reluvestment,
toaelL
Yel I am set averae to recommending the creation
Of another or a different public debt, that as treat
as are, in my Judgment, the edvaulages of the
National Bank circulation in safety, in uulformitv
of value everywhere, andlnotner matters of con
venience and confidence, I look upon such project
at a Certier resort. I recommend tbat the inter
nal revenue tax upon circulation be Ukn ofT in
whole or in paut. 7'bts is 1 per owl per annum,
aud amounts to about SJ.225.Ooo eaitb year
The privilege of furnishing a circululou hsi
been, in the past, a profit to the batiks: It Las been,
and is aa expense to tbe Government to si pervlse
the issue of it, and generally to Uke care of the
National Pank system. Tbe workings or .he sys
tem, and the relations of it to the business of the
country, have changed. It ia now dt-sirable for
the community that the privilege abould be con
tinned and exercised.
1 am aware tbat this la a redaction of taxation in
favor Of organized capital; what ia taken oft here
must sooner or later be in some degree taken ia
elsewhere for means to pay off the public dbt.
Still I would not make this recommend Ion here,
did I not. In another place herein, call atteutlou
to tbe need of a reduction of the taxation resting
upon the community in venera!. 1 further recom
mend that this Department bo authorized to allow
to the banks, circulation to the amouut of W per
rent., upon the average market value for toe
twelve months prior to the deposit, of the United
States bonds deposited on security. Thus a baak
would be enabled to obtain circulation upon the
premium it paid for bonds, as well aa upon the par
value of tbcaa.
The Maicnieuts above ma te alsow that there is
little danger ot uliimatc loss to the Government or
note bolder, upon a circulation based upon the in-tt-rett-bearing
tKiudsof the I nked Stales, though
taken as security at a margiu coming near to tbe
current market vsme therco'.
Other details may be suggested If Congress shall
determine to give relief to the baukers, aud
tfirougb them to the people, tu tuis matter, in tbe
method proposed herein.
The further leclsiaiiou by Congress at its htU
eJon. to stop the over-certiticition by the Na
tMiual Bank, of checks drawn upon thru. has not
Ucn kindly acquiesced in and observed. Directly
or indirectly, it has been disobeyed, or evasion of
it sought.

It often happens that counterfeiu of, or altere

has been Ingeniously argued, lias wot so approved
Itself to the common enc of the people, aa now
to call for elaborate statement of reasons why it
should not be adopted. the public sense i
shrewd enough to tc. that a debtor owing
a large sum upon interest, which it must pay at
hört Interval, and some of the principal of whict
he may pay oC whenever he pleases and thux
fave iutercst, would uot be deemed n
good manager of aflalrs, if be should give away, or
loan on terms yielding no . Income and uot
likely to insure punctual repayment, the means
which good luck or prudent conduct had put tu
his hands; and that it would be wiser for him.
with the cash he had. lo extinguish so much as be
could of tiie debt agalust him. And the United
Mates baa auch means, and owes such debts, it
owes over a billion and quarter of dollars, which Is
runulng upou interest. It haa the option to pay
over three millions of the debt whenever it please.
Il must ay tbe iDtereai on the prioeipml unpaid,
at tdiort iutervala. it is uot good sense, nor U ti
common prudence, to give away or loan its means,
instead of usiug them lo pay the debts aalust it,
while, because of ita abundant prosperity, it I
& j to do ho.
In the Judgment of this Department, It is not a
1 ultimate luuutiou of the Federal Government to
raise money by taxation lo be donated te the
Hiaie', or to thus use money already raised in that
way.
Ills perhaps enough for tho present that the
Iyableilcliyf the Union can lulo up all surplus
now exist lug, or likely to arise for four Jfars to
come.
Another proposition is, o'j, beymeQt from the
surplus to 'Certain of t,h States which have not
bad their full trtn.on of money, uuder thedis
UlbuUr'ii ftt-t ot iSuo. Call it a contract. Yet there
wi kuothcraud a vital part of that contract that
thebinfea should repay, whenever the wants of
the Treasury force t It to call for repayment.
if the United Stale We under contract, as ts con
tended In behalf cf thoae Suite, to make losu lo
them whenever a surplus arises, theu are those
States as well under couiruct to reiy witeti called
upon so to da It is uot too mucii to say tiial it is
sncb a fair and reasonable use of the means of the
Treasury to apply them to curreut expenses and
the payment of payable obligations, as that
within the spirit and intontion of the act of lJi,
the wants of the Treasury now requ lie iha use and
application of this surplus to the purposes of thw
Lulled Statea.
'Ihe recretary of the Treasury. In 137, In his re
port to Congress, recommended the withholding of
tho fourth instalment, asserting thai it waa net a
debt, but a mere temporary di:qx.sl of a surplus.
For tbcte reason, and following in the practice ot
this tei'srtment. j-aywent to those States from the

That lor the last fiscal year was... ult,7tki,lN 9 ;

al am convinced, upon a careful consideration of
the subject, that districts should be consolidated,
aud tbe number thereof reduced. Tue matter la
of importance, as bearing upon an economical
conduct ol public aflalrs Consolidation is, in ex
prnte, lets than this bv near $700,0)0.
The plan outlined ia the result of much thought
and (artful inquiry. The power could be given to
ihe President, to after distrlcta and designate or
apiolut oftioers thereto, aa is his power with In
tel nsl revenue collection districts.
Jn conclusion of this subject I remark, that
there are some considerations which appear to
militate with the feasibility and good results of a
courolidallon. There ia a possibility that in some
of the districts where little revenue la taken, there
might be niuclismugcling but for lbe uudemuu
strstlve preventive etfect of the kuowu existence
of officer, and the wboleaeme fear of detection
threeby excited. It is believed, however, tbat
even if thla ia of potency, it la not needful that
oflicers of other tuan lesser degree and wagea lie
retained, who may be subordinate to a central an
potior couvenlently placed; and I think tbat tbe
ulll proposed fully provides for these coutlagencles.
lbe tariff enacted March S, 1M3. while it haa
given rbeto some troublesome ouestloos of ad
ministration, but fewer than were expected from
anew law of thla kind, has simplified official
work. The mods adopted for collecting duties on
supar according to its saccharine strength seems to
have given general satisfaction, and has removed
the opportunity formerly eiiatlug for evading the
revenue by artificial coloring.
In connection herewith it should be said tbat
change, in the modes of business have insde un
dervaluations inore freqnenl auddifhcult of pre
vention. It Is found that foreign uiauufatturcsof
or wholeaaid dealers in many classes of merchan
dise, decline to Mil or to furnish price-lists to
American merchants, it turns out that those
manufiictnrera or dealers have established busi
ness nousce. or agencies, or special consignees in
thla country, to whom tby make aulpuienta ex
clusively. It Is auspected it might be said that it
ia fouud out tbat In manv cases tbe goods sent
over to these representatives sre invoiced below
their actual value abroad. There ia an risk iu this

in.' That which seema the beet ' ts to subject tbe
manufacturers to the same regulations which are
made by law for the distillers of spirits, so far as
tbey may be applied. It ia worthy, too. of con
sideration whether amnesty should not be given
to a claaa of ofTenders azainst the internal revenue
laws, which will be Intelligibly indicated by the
rnrase -'moonshiners." excepting, however, all
raes in which disobedience of the law bas run to
violc; opposition to tbe enforcement of it.
Rrnvcnoji or taxation.
The only United States bodns whleh are now
payable at tbe pleasure of tbe Government are the
time per cents, eing S.)O.5f.000: thoae which
iu xt become redeemable are the t200.000.OUO of
four-and a half per cento, on September 1. 1891.
The S77,f 20.700 of four per cents and theS:2i,söO of
refnuding certiti rates are redeemable July 1, iv07.
The estimates for trie fiscal year ending Jnne 39,
1&4. ahow a surplus revenue of r.tXXMXX) per
annum. This is cnoaeh to pay all tbe three per
cents in about three and one-half years, and before
the cloi-e of tbe fiscal year ending June 30, 1837.
This surplus kept up lor the fonranoceeding years,
to September 1. IS'.'l. would be more than SU"0,000,
(0 , or SlOO.eou.OOOmore than enough to pay all the
bonds then falling due The same annual surplua
until July 1, 1907, would amount, with the S100.
OlO.UO left after paying the four-and-a-half per
cents, to about Sl.4G0.CO0.iiO0, while the whole
amount of the debt then redeemable is le than
740,OUO.OOO. 1 he estimated s .rpf us of WvOW.tXX) a
year would pay the whole amount of interest bear
ing debt iu about fifteen years.
As a general principle, the good ot the people
require that a public debt should be paid as so n
s it may be without greatly onerous taxation, or
disturbance of busine lutoaeats which have teen
fostered, perhaps simulated, by provisions of law
once expedient. Jtutasour interest-hearing pub
lic debt is over one billion end a quarter Öldollars

chase, sve at heavy ralea ot premium, even if it
csn by paying those rate, thrr is forced upon our
attention tne question, bow shall a heeped-npanr-plus
of public mouey be avoided? Tne
eo the question atill presse, what legislation la
necessary to reliave the people of uuiieasary faxest
In the recommendations of the l'reidh'ui and
those of this Ifpartmcut. and the action of Con
gress, and in the expression of public opinion,,
there has beeu substantial concord as to bisw the
needed reduction of the revenue should t?
brought about It bas been generally conceded
that the Internal revenue taxes, except those upou
spirits, fermented liquors, and noon the circula
tion of batiks, might welt be abolished. There has
been diflen-nce whether the tax upon tobaoco
should be abolished or modified. There were but
few adviaates of the Immediate abolition of taxes
upon spirits of fermented liquors.
To make a start in the proposed reductloo of
revenue front imports, tbe 'l ana Commission has
lieen created.
The Chairman of the Feuate (Virnmittee- on
Finance, iu explanation of the bill bvfore the
Senate last year, wuich alter various amendments
became a law. estimated at SUOuO.OOO.
The leduction from all source of internal
revenue for the current year appears lob; about
S J O.OOO.oiK) leas than the rtsluctioo expected by tne
r-enste Cora mitte. We have, then, a redaction of
fciO.OMMM) less than was nought for and expected.
The question recurs: Shall we now seek again
for tbat reduction which waa not attained, aud ia
it now advisable to attempt a redtiutotiof the
revenues for Inline years le arise from duties on
imports? There waa general agreement thst a aub
atantial reduction of the tariff should be made.
Tne estimates of the Tariff Commission and ot the
Senate Committee show wnat was the contem
plated reduction. The actual results so far
obtained Indicate that the reduction labored for
baa uot been e flee led by the new tariff act. It ia to
be tonaidercd. too, that the failure is not to be
cbarked to the increase ot Importations kecpiug
up the amount of customs revenue.
And there are consideiataons which are apt upon
thia head. Tbe new tariff act went into operation,
tn aH 11 parts, on the lt day of July I8S3. There
bas gone by since then but Hille over one-tnird
fiscal year. It is a short time in which to learn
with accuracy how so important and wide
reaching a law as that touching all the business
and industrial Interest of tbe country, will per
manently a fleet the revenues of the duties on
iu ports.
Iu my report of last year k wss suggested, tbat
f bould il be deemed expedieut to reduce the rate
of taxes on spirits, tobacco, or fermented liquors
to lessen tbe inducement io frauds, or to make
tbem more equal, the objection is not so strong
utainst moderate modification aa against a total
repeal of all taxes thereon. As bas been seen, a
reduction of the tax upon tobacco and its manu
factured producta baa resulted, in a decrease of
revenue therefrom, fully as large as was expected
by the Committee which submitted the bill, and
there is left aUut SJ1.490.000 of revenue from that
source. Tbe estimated receipt from spirit, how
ever, aa bas beeu seen, for the current y eir exceed
the receipts for former years. The reason ot the
opposition to the redaction of the tax on distilled
spirits Is that they are not necessaries of life. Tbat
principle may be anil upheld, and yet tbe lax, in
whole or in part, be taken from alcohol or spirits
used lu the manufactures and the arts
Propositions are msde to repeal the whole sys
tem of Internal revenue. Aa to this. I repest ray
remark of Isst year: "1 see no public sentiment
or political action, indicating a desire on the part
of taxpayio,' I'ilUeus to strike out this claa of
taxe"
-He forciert commerce of the Uuiiel Stales dur-
ing the last fiscal year, including import and ex
I port of merchandise and specie, was as follows:

IVMICSATIO.".
The administration Of die "net to regulate im
migration." approved August 3. lis.:, witii the
general supervision of winds thla Department is
charged, haa been attended with a reasonable
measure ot sutees.
There are certain restrictive features of tne law
which binder tbe full accomplishment of its pur
pose. Force of these were noted In my last report,
ecoropanied by recommendations of legislation
for their removal. Trie experience ot another
year has conlirmed lbe views then exprewied.
Ihe provisions of the law which forbid the land
ing of alieu convicts, lunatic, idiots, or persons
puable to take care of themselves without becom
ing 8 public rharcc; can not be r.ropsrly enforced
without penalties for their violation which the'
law does not inflict, come of the super
vising Hoards or Commissioners bare foand it
nccifaiy to provide, temporarily. or tbe care ot
persona landed In violation of law They have re
turned most of them to the respective countries
whence they came. Were owners of vesaels sub
jected to a penalty, to be. a lisjB upon the vessel, la
a sum large enough to defray the ex pease of care
and deportation, it would to far to prevent these
violations of the law. The penalties thus col
lected should create a special fund to defray tbe
expense of care and deportation.
It ccturs that alien paupers and Others In in
digent circumstances have a. rived from Kurooe,
whose passae-inoney and other expenses incident
to the voyage, and but little more, were paid by
the respective Governments or rauntcipilittes from
which they came, or by voluntary Aasociallons
abroad. They are liable to become a public char j
upon the communities In which they land, uulesa
cared for awhile by the Commissioners, and as soon
as may be aent back where they belong. Such of
theae as wereionud Incapable of self-support have,
sa far as practicable, been returned.
The act is detective, in that iu execution de
pends euiit ely upou State offietrs. Naturally they
care for local interests, and act to protect them.
The execution of the law should be by Federal
oflicers, nnder rules and regulations uniform
througnoat the country. The well-being ot the
immigrant and the protection of the whole public
would be the end sought iu all Iocs lilies. At pres
ent there rs lack of uniformity in the inauageiactit
aud care of the Immigrant, anl the protection ot
the Immediate public ia first iu cou templet Ion.

Matuu-a ot limitations are not in the nature of a

The severe chemical tests to which the

the comparative strength as follows:

The Itoyal Baking Powder was found, be
sides being of absolute purity, to evolve the
highest amountof leavening gas of any of the
powders tested, and hence it was placed at
the head of the list and recommended for
Government use.
Hut the crucial test of the kitchen is, after
all, the most satisfactory to tbe housekeeper.
A baking powder that never fails to make
light, sweet, wholesome and palatable bread,
biscuit, cake. etc.. upon all occasions, is the
one that will be placed at the head of the
list by the practical housewife, aud received
into her kitchen for continuous use. This
test the Royal Baking Powder has stood for
over twenty years without a single failure,
and hence its reputation as the best baking
powder mad has spread from bouse to
house, unti! its use has become as universal
as its merits are unrivaled.
