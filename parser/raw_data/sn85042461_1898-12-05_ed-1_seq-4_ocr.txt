We lately gave one day to Thanksgiving, and we expect soon i

ought to feel proud of the privilege of de
voting this day to the laudable purpu'e of
ONE DAY FOB
LOS ANGELES
lifting the government of our beautiful city
out of the baneful environment of politics, so far as that is possi
ble. Our present system of municipal management is the only
future wherein Loe Angeles laps behind in the progress of Amer
ican cities, That system is not adapted to the Los Anpeles of to
day, much less the greater LO9 Angeles that is looming up in
the near future. Our city is abreast of the foremost American
cities in all other respects. It is hampered by an obsolete plan of
government, ajid the time has come to adopt a progressive and
enlightened plan, after the manner of up-to-date cities elsewhere.
It la well worth a day's time, and a day's hard
•work, for every lover of this city to bend his energies the
present day in the direction of seeming the larg
est possible for the the now charter.. We should be satis
fied with nothing but a great majority in favor 01. the measure.
The vote will necessarily indirate the proportion of progressive
voters as compared with the element that opposes progress from
base personal motives. It cannot be doubted that n vo«t majority
of our people are reall in favor of belter municipal government,
but that can uvuil nothing without material backing at the poll
ing places.
Lus Angeles today appeals to her citizens to rescue her from
the mesh of ward politics. She appeal.? for the rescue of her schools
from their dangerous enthral I men t, and for v system of pure educu
tionul management. She begs for an enlightened system of cily
government that would be in keeping with theproud position she
occupies, in every other respect, among American cities,
A full muster Bt tlic polls this morning, and an earnest day's
work in behalf of the charier is o duty, not v privilege. Xo true
friend of Lus Angeles ran escape the ujilnaiding of his conscience
unless he enn fed at the dosing of the poll*, that he bus "fought
the good tight."

CONGRESS
TODAY
compressed in order to avoid the necessity
of n special session of the Fifty-fifth congress. Tbe annual mes
sage which the president will communicate immediately after the
organization will be of absorbing interest, lt hns been given out.
in a general way, that the president hns satisfactorily solved the
Philippine enigma, but thus far the secret has been carefully
guarded. If he succeeds in pointing out a clear path for congress
to pursue, in all the phases of legislation incident to the late war
he will deserve credit for phenomenal acumen.
Peculiar interest attaches to Hip message because it will have
an important bearing on the attitude of men who may bold the
balance of power in tbe senate when the ratification of tbe peace
treaty comes up. Several Republican members have intimated
n decided aversion for the expansion policy, and tbe president
will have need of all his skill as a political tactician to hold them
in check.
The matter of most concern to our people in California is tbe
action the presidifit may take concerning tne Nicaragua canal. It
lias been stated, by persons personally in the president's confi
dence, that the message will favor the building of the canal di
rccetly by the government or else under a government guarantee.
The Pacific coast wants no influence but the government in con
trol of the enterprise, in any manner whatever. We shall know
very soon, however, w hat plan the president has to oiler.
Two trails in the character of candidate Eaton were conspic
uously developed during the campaign. The lirst was in his eager
clutch at the opportunity to secure from the city a most exorbi
tant fee for an opinion. The second, bis duplicity, on the stump,
in making promises concerning what he would do if elected, when
be knew tbatas mayor be couldhave no power to fulfill them. Mr.
Eaton knows, or at least ought to know, that the mayor has very
limited power under the present system of city government. His
promises' to keep in stock a lot of new school buildings, and tbe
like, were made with the full knowledge that it would be impos
sible for him to redeem those promises. His speeches throughout
the canvass, in fact, bore tbe stamp of the political trickster and
demagogue. Mr. Eaton would better serve tbe city on tbe out
side of tbe mayor's office.
Mr. Eaton makes a personal explanation of bis bill against the
city for services in giving an opinion to the water committee.
He says: "I consider that the services rendered in preparing tbis
opinion and the responsibility that we assumed w ere worth a great
deal more than the amount that was charged, and if t be city could
not afford to pay me9loo, it was welcome to his services for
nothing." Mr. Eaton says he declined the proffer of .§SO, and the
warrant remains in the city auditor's office. The only new
phase of the matter that we discover in Mr. Eaton's explanation
is the idea that he ought to have attempted to get more than $100
out of the public pocket for his brief service. He personally con
firms the opinion that he "conies too high."
In the original account of the time devoted by Mr. Eaton to
that water opinion tlie duration of the labor was put at one hour
and a half. Mr. Eaton's friends contend that tbe time was more
than ninety minutes. Perhaps it would approximate tbe truth
to call it three hours. Tbe candidate says his labor was worth
more than $100. Now, although Mr. Eaton is worried about the
"proper teaching of the children" in our public schools, we venture
the guess that some thousands of little fingers would go up, in
elcmentry arithmetic classes, if the question were asked whether
they could solve this sum in proportion: If three hours'service
is worth $100, what won! 1 one year's service be worth?"
If there are any voters this morning of doubtful mind about
the charter because of lack of knowledge concerning its provis
ions, they should bear in mind that it is the product of weeks of
labor, contributed gratuitously by fifteen of our best and most
favorably known citizens. That should count for a good deal.
The board of freeholders ransacked every source of knowledge
about advanced municipal government, and the charter now pre
sented is the wheat threshed from patient and laborious glean
ings. The judgment of those fifteen representative citizens may
be safely trusted.
In alluding to tbe Union candidate for treasurer, ns a member
of tbe Seventh regiment, the Express says: "It is just as well to
remember that. W. A. Hart well, the Republican candidate, was
serving gallantly in the field during the civil war before Winans
was born." Further, we are told that Mr. Hartwell has made an
excellent treasurer, and the query follows: "What is the matter
with a veteran like Hartwell ." Nothing. He has evidently
earned and is entitled to a rest.
We sec no cause for alarm in! the legal quibble that the char
ter might fail of adoption even though a majority of votes on it
should be affirmative. The point raised is that the phraseology ol
the const itution requires a majority of votes cast generally in the
election. A very good way to avoid any such quibble, however,
is to put the charter through by so large a majority that it will
be landed high and dry out of danger of any kind.
Nothing since the lamentations of Jeremiah has equaled the
sad wail of our Berlin contemporary, the Deutsche Zeitung, in
considering how Germany has been "left." It plaintively ex
claims: "Can we obtain nothing from tbe Spanish colonial os
tatewhich is visibly, piece by piece, being sold at auction!" Why
not bid on the Maria Teresa or the Cristobal Colon?
A specially good feature of the new charter is its provision
for adequate school buildings, without borrowing money for the
purpose. It provides for a, school building fund, secured by a tax
provision of three cents on tbe hundred dollars. This > lan would
insure ample school room for all emergencies, and would save
the city from incurring additional indebtedness for that purpose.
C. E. Huber, Democratic nominee for councilman from the
Fourth ward, is an old timer, and a man who helped lay tho
foundations of the magnificent success that Los Angeles now
enjoys. Mr. Huber was a member of the city council twenty
years ago, and he left a record without a blemish. It is certain
that the old residents of bis ward will vote for Huber today.
The federation of Central American republics died in very
early infancy. Ii was barely a month old. The ob ject was to
strengthen the three republics by a tripartite alliance, hut the
scheme failed to mature. The little republics in Central ami
South America are all in a formative stage now, and it w ill be
years before they simmer down to the staid and dignified level
oi the great republic of tbe north.
Dawson City, in the act of retiring for its long w inter nap,
must be an interesting spectacle. "Large quantities of logs are
brim: piled in front of business and other houses to serve as fuel."
ii Dawson could en joy elect ions as often as Los Angeles does it
might keep warm without hibernating.
The Express says Mr. Eaton is "a man of broad views." Wo
should think so. His ideas of financial expansion are so broad now
that it startle- one lo think of the possibilities if he should get. full
swing in the mayor's office.
The present charter, like the Irishman's blanket, is "short at
iintii ends." It fits the present city no better than ten-year trous
ers lit a fifteen-year-old boy. And every day of flic city's growth
makes the mistit more apparent.

The Negro Wants an Opportunity
To the Editor of The Los Angeles Herald:
An opportunity nipped in tin' t>ud is some
thing saved, but when lost it is as a spoken
word, or a spent arrow, gone, never to re
turn. The past life of tbe old negro is
such, but tbe latter-day negro wanls an op
portunity, which is the stepping; stone to a
treasure-house of wealth and knowledge.
Is the negro a politician? Just to an extent
but not an intelligent one. Why? Because
he has been deprived of a political growth
in his early age on account of slavery. Vet
his ambition is higher, if he can get an op
portunity to improve himself. The negro
is not inferior intellectually. He is as ca
pable as others, which lihs been proven.
Then open the doors—let him in, and he will
take care of himself.
The negro wants freedom of brain as well
as of body. You can educate your sons
and daughters to the highest. Give them
uo occupation to cultivate the brain, and it
will be of no use to them. So the disad
vantage of tbe ballot has been to the negro
in this land of bis nativity, since eigbteeu
hundred anel sixty-live.
The negro should and must learn lo vote
and sustnin the interest of those who will
help bim and give bim an opportunity to
improve, regardless of party. Vote, but
for the man that will help your race. It is
not the curbstone or night owl politician
that intends good or does us good. He only
wants some interest in the campaign hinds,
which is the height of bis ambition. We
as a race, should use discretion at the bal
lot box. Vote for the educated, the hon
est and most competent men who are able
to look out to the be*t of tbeir ability for
the welfare of the people, regardless of race
or color.
The negro will never be a politician until
he learns to use policy in his politics. Pol
icy is everything. Give tbe negro an op
portunity and be will work and prove him
self in casting his vote. Be wise; it is not
the mayor alone: but choose good coun
cilmen, who govern the city. Whether he
be a Democrat or Republican, let him he
competent. C. F. ADAMS.
Vote For The Charter
To the Editor of the Los Angeles Herald:
Ihe new charter, which the voters of Los
Angeles are about to either adopt or reject,
may not be a perfect organic law. It would
be a most remarkable instrument if it were
entirely free from imperfections. But. as
1 understand it, the new charter as a whole
is so much superior to the present one that
it ought to be adopted without any hesita
tion.
Among the numerous objections urged
against the proposed new charter, those
most frequently used, 1 believe, are the in
creased powers with which the mayor will
be clothed, and the absence of any provision
generally called the "imperative mandate."
As to the lirst objection, it may be said that
the mayor will be all the more likely to
prove the "right man in the right place" if
it is known before his election that he will
be something more than a flgurehead in
the city government and be compelled to
face grave responsibilities as the city's
chief executive. That fact will put all
classes of voters on their good behavior, so
to speak, and they will be likely to select
tbe best man obtainable tor the position, re
gardless oi partisan politics, for municipal
government is really business, not politics.
As to the "imperative mandate," it is
comparatively easy for a community like
this to let its officials know what is wanted
and what is not wanted, without any special
provisions other than what the new charter
provides. That objection is certainly not
a vital one, nor are all the objections raised
sufficient to justify the rejection of the pro
posed organic law, which has been carefully
prepared by thirteen of our most competent
citizens irrespective of party.
1 believe the state of California has out
grown its present constitution and should
have a new one. I am very sure that the
city of Los Angeles needs a new chat ter. and
now is the time to adopt as good a charter
BS the city is likely to have offered it within
the ensuing twenty years. Let us adopt it
by an overwhelming vote.

Before civil government in our dependen

civil service in them almost as attractive as
naval and military service. There is noth

the Philippines or Porto Rico a career which
will attract many able men. To do tbis we
must make the service permanent, we must
guarantee that ability and integrity will
never be disregarded in favor of the man

Authorities differ as to the rate of growth

dissimilar in different individual.-. The

rarely exceeds twelve or fourteen inches,

THE EXPANSION ISSUE
THREATENS TO SPLIT THE OLD
PARTIES
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Will Propose the Annexation of the
Philippines as Colonies—Would
It Be Constitutional?
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.—(Special Cor
respondence to Tlie Herald.) As the vari
ous congressmen return to this city and
place themselves on record in regard to the
manifold problems that arise, directly or
indirectly, out of "expansion," it becomes
steadily more and more apparent that an
issue has been precipitated that is likely to
split the old panics into fragments.
The Democratic party, as a free trade,
free silver parly which has been responsible
for all the earlier annexations of territory
by the United States, might be expected
to favor expansion. The annexation of the
Philippines and their becoming part of this
country would naturally be a long step to
wards generalrfree trade, and as the Philip
pines use silver, would unquestionably help
the white metal. Vet the Democrats gen
erally oppose annexation, tbe sugar-raising
states being especially bitter against it.
The Republicans, on the other band,
would be expected to oppose it, for the very
reasons that the Democrats should favor it.
Vet. it is notorious lhat though western Re
publicans favor it, New England is bitterly
opposed to it.
Meanwhile President McKinley sticks to
his old policy ef conciliating everybody. It
is generally understood that his message
to congress will propose that the Philip
pines, and perhaps Porto Rico as well, shall
be annexed, not as territories, but as colo
nies, and that a taritf belaid against them
and that their citizens be excluded.
On the power to do tbis parties are again
divided against themselves. Most of the
Democrats who have expressed themselves
on the subject think that the United Slates
has no power to hold colonies; they main
tain that tbe moment annexation is accom
plished, the territory annexed will become
part of the United States and its citizens
and its products will be entitled to free ad
mission. It is understood that certain Chi
nese from Manila are already trying to en
ter the I'nited States on this plea. On the
other hand, the Republicans {generally have
maintained thai it is possible for the United
States to hold colonies iv the European
sense of the term.
To show bow party lines are broken, it is
only necessary to cite such distinguished
men as ex-Senator Edmunds, Senator Hoar,
and Andrew Carnegie, who are understood
to maintain that tbe United States has no
such (lower; while such Democrats as Sen
ator Morgan maintain that it has. Senator
Morgan, indeed, asserted today that the
United States could deal with the Philip
pines just as it had dealt with the Indians.
It can confine them to their reservations,
forbid tbeir buying whisky and firearms
and do anything else that any European
power might do under similar circumstances.
Thus, he thinks we can exclude the Chinese
cf the Philippines and of Hawaii and can
put a duty on sugar from Porto Rico and
Hawaii. In fact, he asks pertinently, how
it is that duties are now collected against
the latter place unless we have power to
levy duties against our colonial possessions.
Military control is not involved here.
Thi constitution, Senator Morgan says,
is entirely an internal agreement for the
protection of tbe individual slates, and has
nothing to do with outside matters. Neither
the Philippines nor i'orto Rico will neces
sarily be parts of the union, but will merely
be possessions of the I'nited States, which
it can govern as it may see fit.
Hut. though maintaining the right of the
United States to exercise sovereign rights
in matters outside of the country, Senator
Morgan is opposed to placing all ot her coun
tries on an equal footing with us in tbe
Hade of these colonies. No one, he says,
has asked or expected England to decree
the "open door" in her crown colonies. That
term has been understood, iv the past, to
apply only to leased territory, such as Kaio
Chan, bay, leased by Germany, and not to
territory owned by a country, as we shall
own the Philippini s.
Thus if appears, that party lines arc
broken, not only on the powers of the
Lnited States government but also on its
policy in dealing with the new possessions,
it would be rather amusing if the Edmunds
ami Carnegies should prove to be right, and
if free trade received its greatest extension
by the act of William McKinley, high priest
of protection.

Forest Preservation in Bohemia
After the many centuries during which the
forests of Bohemia have furnished fuel and
building material for a dense population, it
is said that they retain nearly their primeval
area. This is due to tbe forethought of the
government in ordaining that as trees are
cut down others shall be planted to lill tbe
vacancies. Tho wood is mostly pine. Trees
are constantly being cut, but wherever a
clearing is made small trees are planted the
next spring. These new trees are raised
from the seed in small inclosures scattered
in the mountains and are thence trans
planted.
New Peach Pest in Michigan
Michigan has developed a new peach pest,
which arrests the growth of the fruit when
it is about the size of a hazelnut, thus pro
ducing a crop locally known as "little
peaches." it was first noticed about two
years ago, and tbis year its ravages were
alarmingly extensive. So far no remedy has
been found lor it, though expert investiga
tion and experiment are not wanting, in
Saugatuck township during tbe present sea
sou more than 400 trees were affected.

NEW EMPIRE ACQUIRED
BY THE UNITED STATES
W VSHINGTON, Nov. Ths new em
pire scquired by the American republic in
the war with Spain is va.-t in area, rich in
n-sources and teems with populations oi
many kinds. Of this empire there is one
put very important to the United States
in tnany ways. That is the Philippine
.-lands.' Today Spam surrendered to tbe
i'nited States all her possessions in Amer
ica and all but an insignificant fraction of
her possessions in the east. By this sur
render the kingdom has been practically
bereft of colonies. And these colonies, with
all their tropical wealth and splendor, have
been added to tbe national wealth of the
United States, or, to speak more accurately,
serve to establish the first colonies of Amer
ica. In the opinion of most wise men now
in the capital the people of the United
States arc now entering upon a new exper
iment. Their first experiment was that ot
a modefn republic; their second and last
is that of American colonies. If they suc
ceed, &s the wise ones think they will, in
the last as brilliantly as they have suc
ceeded in the first there will be no cause
for complaint from any quarter. What fol
lows is a tablo of important statistics con
cerning our now assured new possessions
(including Cuba, which, so far as Spain is
concerned, belongs to us as much as any
body):
Name. Area ln sq. m. Population.
I'hilii.olne iFlands 114.650 J.« 0,000
C'uhu. 41.665 1.681,85]
Porto RICO 3,670 813,9*7
Sulu Islands jj» W.JOO
Caroline Islands 500 30,000
Total 161.485 10,220,624
j
The revenues of the Philippines for 1805,
the last available statistics, arc said to have
been $13,570,900; those of Cuba to have been
(in IHH4) 924,440,750, and those of Porto Rioo
for the same year $5,454,958. Of the Phil
ippines the largest island is Luzon. It is
the island on which the city of Manila (near
ly 2U0,(H)() population) is situated, and is very
productive. The chief exports of the Phil
ippines are sugar, hemp, ieaf tobacco, cjgars,
and copra, and their chief imports are rice,
Hour, wines, dress, petroleum and coal.
There are only 720 miles of telegraph in the
islands and seventy miles of railway. The
Carolines and Sulu islands are unimportant
except for small trade and naval stations.
Porto Kico, another of the new absolute
possessions of the United States, is a most
prosperous country. Its chief products are
coffee, sugar, molasses and tobacco. Ot
Cuba little can be Faid that is not now
known by the people of the United tSates.—
Chicago Times-Herald.
Bulgaria a Naval Power
The successful launching of the cruiser
Nadiejda, at Bordeaux, which will soon be
ready for sea, marks the beginning of Bu7
garia as a naval power. She is really a tor
pedo boat destroyer, being of but 750 tons
displacement. She is an exceedingly dimin
utive copy of the Russian ironclad gunboat
Khravy.
To Make Berlin a Seaport Town
It is announced that the German govern
ment expects to be able to introduce a bill
in the next session of the Prussian diet for
tbe construction of a canal suitable for large
steamships between Berlin and Stettin,
practically making Berlin a seaport town.

SPIRIT OF THE PRESS
Monopoly Ever on the Alert
Those good-, innocent souls who are c*
pecting the ordinary American citizen or the
individual capitalist to enjoy special oppor
tunities for investment and active business
in our "new possessions" will in all proba
bility be doomed to disappointment. Al
ready the "development syndicate" has
been formed and chartered and has its agents
ready to get options on all things worth hav
ing. The syndicates in this country never
sleep on opportunities. If there is anything
in sight they rarely overlook it and thej
propose to have every avenue to wealth in
the "new possessions" practically monopo
lized before any weaker companies or indi
vidual investors can get in on the ground
floor.—Houston, Tex., Post.
Even Royalty Feels Mai del Mer
The real nnd unromantic reason for Em
peror William's abandonment of his plan
to return home by way of the Bay of Biscay
is said to have been a fear of sea sickness,
and this fear may be the beginning of wis
dom. Since according to those who have
never tried it—and. probably also the Chris
tian Scientists^—the avoidance of the malady
is merely a matter of will power, the kaiset
may be excused for having qualms about
risking a position where.be would be forced,
in the presence of his suite, to throw up alt
claim to that imperial will which is still so
large a part of the stock in trade of the mod
ern monarch. —Philadelphia Times.
Buying Conquered Territory
The proposition to pay money to Spain ia
a disgraceful one. It is suggestive of some
thing worse than a mistake. To buy assets
that we have conquered is a proceeding man
ifestly absurd. No pettifogging about the
legal aspects of the case can justify it. Tha
purpose to pay $20,000,000— a sum, by the
way, which the Spanish negotiators seem to
regard with contempt—stimuates those who
are opposed to annexation on any terms,
Citizens who might yield their opposition
if the islands came to u» purely as conquered
territory will assemble all the reasons for op
position in view of the proposed indemnity.
