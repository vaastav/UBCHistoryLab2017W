■ 11l- MESSAGE.
We lay before our readers to day the
full text of the President's Message, which
ought to have been transmitted by the
Associated Press in time for our afternoon
edition yesterday. The message was in
their hands, ready for transmission, at a
low minutes past one o'clock, and three
hours' limo whs amply sufficient, with the
number of wires at their command, in
which t. have forwarded it for the evening
[Man of the South. But no part of it came
except as a "special," and we obtained
iho best we could of that.
The message is a clear, comprehensive,
and'straightforward document. The con
dition of tho Government in its several de- I
partmeut- is succinctly, yet fully stated,
while our relations with foreign govern
ments are touched upon at sufficient
length, and with sufficient accuracy of
..tatement, to enable any person of ordinary
intelligence to thoroughly understand what
has been done in the way of diplomacy
during the pft3t year, and what i. likely to
be our foreign policy for the ensuing year.
The President congratulate- the country !
upon lhe happy settlement by arbitration
of our recent unpleasant and very grave
differences with the government of Great
Britain, which had been submitted to the
OWN Conference by the Treaty of Wash
ington, and recommends, in this connection,
the appointment of a Board of Commision
c-m to make examination of tho several
-laim. for indemnity, so that iudividual
losses may be satisfactorily adjusted by
tho time the Geneva award is due and pay
able to the government. He refers, also,
in gratulatory terms, to the settlement of
tho vexed question of boundary between
the two governments, which had been re
ferred to the arbitration and award ot
the Emperor of Germany, to decide upon
t*ie construction and true interpretation of
t.ie treaty of _B_G. In thi- award tho
'laim of the American government had
been fully recognized by hi« Majesty the
Emperor, and Great Britain had graciously
acquiesced in giving effect to the decision.
By this determination of tho Emperor of
Germany, we secure the important archipe
lago of islands, lying between tho continent
tind Vancouver's Island, which Great Brit
ain has persistently claimed and occupied
ever since the ratification of tho treaty of
1340. It also leaves us, for the first time
in the history of the country, without a
disputed boundary question upon our
hands.
Our relations with the other powers of
Europe, are referred to in grateful and
graceful terras as being of the most cordial
and friendly character, satisfactory treaties
having been concluded during the past year
with several of tbem in reference to natu
ralization and other questions of material
interest to our people. References are made
io tho part our government has taken in
the International Statistical Congress which
L-tetjr assembled at St. Petersburg!), and:
the pi'tpa rat ions making for the Interna
lionftl Exp-sitii.n to be held during the I
nc-t year i>i Vienna, at which adequate ;
arrangenents will be made for the __-om-;
modali'Hi of AlMTkell exhibitors. These I
international projects are highly commended !
for tl.r-if t-ti-tenej- in tha direction of ad-1
■ancedi-lviii*." i.i-ii, tbe elevation of indu.*
try ami lab,., the met ease of human hap- ;
pintaa, and the graatai mtercnirrM and j
good-will between nation..
The President expresses bw regret that I
lb-.e bi_. b.cti ii. advance since his Ins-1 !
.i..!iil_! message in (be parilication of the j
liisootiU'iited portion of the people of Cuba.
Ho refer.', to the insurrection an havirg
;:.ine<! no advantages iv the last year,
vvbi'.i- il,:; .Spanish t'oveiiiiueiit has failed to j
repress ihe rcsoltitionary demonstrations l
of her people. The contest has now lasted
For four year., and the President regards
ihe continued maintenance of slavery in that
ilk-id as the chief obstacle in the way of a
restoration oi peace. He expresses the hope
that the present liberal government of Spain
v.ill voluntarily adopt the views which have
been uniformly urged upon itn consideration
by the American government. Our rela
tions with the Central and South Ameri
can government- continue to bo of tho
-tout friendly character, a. well as (hose
with Japan and China.
Onr relations with the Mexican Ilepub- j
lie aro referred to in connection with tho '
death of the late President and the election
of hid tt tnporary successor, and while the
many lawless act. that have distutbed the
quiet of the border settlements, in conse
■ ;»-ne. of the late revolutionary condition
•'f that republic, arc reftired to as subjects
of just complaint on tlio part, of our
government, it is believed that
the cause, of grievance will cease
uader the more satisfactory condi
tion of atlairs iv that government. The !
commissioner, appointed to inquire into tho
depredations committed on the Texan fron
tier have not yet fully completed their la
bor., and an additional appropriation is
(•commended to enable them to perform
their duties agreeably l# the resolution un
der which they wero appointed in May laat.
The financial exhibit of the government
ia in the highest degree satisfactory. The
condition of the War and Naval depart*
mmta are referred to at length, with Bug
ge.tiona ar.d recommendations which we
shall more particularly consider hereafter.
Tho condition of the Indian tribes, the
affairs of tho territories, our public land.,
their sale for educational purposes, the
question of pensions, tho centennial cele
bration, the decennial census, education,
agriculture, patents, and the civil service,
: all corao in for their share of appropriate j
] consideration in the message. Tho depart- j
; ment of the Postofflce makes a most favor
able showing for the past fiscal year. And
the President warmly endorses the proposi
tion of tho Postmaster-General to acquire
the title of all the telegraph lines in the
United States and connoct them with tlio
postal sorvice of the government.
But the most important suggestion con
tained iv the message, so far as our own
State is concerned, is that in regard to the
Water Lines of the Republic. Tho Presi
dent happily recognizes these lines as of tho
highest important-) to the agricultural and
commercial interests of tho country, and
urge., their consideration, at the earliest
practical moment, upon tho legislative
branch of the government. Tho extension
of tho James River and Kanawha Canal to
the Ohio, is among theso recommendations,
and it behooves our people, and especially
the General Assembly of tho Stato,
to take such action in this matter
as will most poworfully commend this
great work to the consideration of
the national Congress. It can be shown to
be the most important nnd desirable of
all the water-lines named, and, with ener
getic pushing on our part, it can be the
first coiiiplett.il. What is now required at
the hands of Virginia statesmanship is
i a heartier co-operation than ever with the
I Federal Government in all that concerns
j the material prosperity and growth of our
| State. Send all past political feuds and
prejudices, with old fogyism, to the wall,
and a brighter and more glorious era than
Virgina has yet seen, may speedily dawn
upon our future.
The President, according to all reports
from Washington, stands firm and openly
declares his purpose to enforce reform in
tho Civil Service by the promotion in every
instance of the subordinate who is the most
! competent to fill tha duties. While he does
not propose to open the doors of competi
tion to the friends and opponents of the
Administration alike, he proposes to insist
that competency shall be the rule, even if
it exclude Republican aspirants, and that
the efficiency of the service shall be pro
moted by filling all vacancies from the
ranks of subordinates.
The money-order business of tho Post-
Office Department has rapidly grown to
great magnitude. During the year ending
June 30, 1872, it exceeded $93,000,000.
Of this vast sum, sent in small remittances,
none exceeding ijMO, and the average not
exceeding $20, little or none was lost. It
is possible that the science might be
extended, so as to enable persons to send
8100, with great convenience and safety to
the public.
