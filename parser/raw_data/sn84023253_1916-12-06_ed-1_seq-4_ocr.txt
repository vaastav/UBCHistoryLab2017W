Declares That Their Opera
tion Should Not Be Stopped
6r Interrupted by the Con
certed Action of Organized
Bodies of Men Until a Pub
lic Investigation Shall Have
Been Instituted.
IX one of the shortest messages
ever sent to congress President
Wilson urges that early action
be taken to complete his pro
gram of "settlement and. regulation"
recommended at the last session. The
message In full is as follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty
laid upon me by the constitution of
communicating to you from time to
time information of the state of the
Union and recommending to your con
sideration such legislative measures as
may be judged necessary and expedi
ent I shall continue the practice, which
1 hope has been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments
the elaboration of the detailed needs
of the public service and confine my
self to those matters of more general
public policy with which It seems nec
essary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible. But there
were some things left tindone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary in the Interest of the public
to do at once.
The Railroad Problem.
In the first place', it seems to me Im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
should be accorded the remaining
measures of the program of settlement
and regulation which I had occasion to
recommend to you at the close of your
last session in. view of the public dan
gers disclosed by- the unaccommodated
difficulties which then existed and
which still unhappily continue to ex
ist between the railroads of the coun
try and their locomotive engineers,
conductors and trainmen.
I then recommended:
First, immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
in the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by. the senate in order that the
commission may be enabled to deal
with the many great and various du
ties now devolving upon it with a
promptness and" thoroughness which
are,vith its present constitution and
means of action, practically impossible.
Second, the establishment of an )eight
hour day as the legal- basis alike of
work and of wages in the employment
of all railway employees who are ac
tually engaged in the work of operat
ing trains in interstate transportation.
Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults in experience of the adoption of
the eight hour day in railway transpor
tation alike for the men and for the
railroads. . -
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by the In
terstate commerce commission of an
increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of the eight
hour day and which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed justify the increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation and arbitration
of -such controversies as the present by
adding to it a provision that, In case
the .methods of accommodation now
provided for should fail, a full public
Investigation of the merits of every
6ucli dispute shall be instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
Control by tho Executive.
And, sixth, the lodgment In the
hands of the executive of the power,
la case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railways of the coun
try as may be required, for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
the military service of the United
States such train crews and adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use.
The second and third of these rec
ommendations the congress immediate
ly acted on: It established the eight
hour day as the legal basis of work
and wages in train service and it au
thorized the appointment of a commis
sion to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most immediately needed, but
it postponed action upon the other sug
gestions until an opportunity should be
offered for a more deliberate consider
ation of them. y.
The fourth recommendation I do not
deem it necessary to renew. The pow-
on i in hi
I llf
OPERATION OF RAILWAYS
SHALL NOT BE STOPPED
To pass a law which forbade or
prevented the individual work
man to leave his work before re
ceiving the approval of society
in doing so would be to adopt a
new principle into our jurispru
dence which I take it for grant
ed we are not prepared to intro
duce. But the proposal that the
operation of the railways of the
country shall not be stopped or
interrupted by the concerted ac
tion of organized bodies of men
until a public investigation shall
have been instituted which shall
make the whole question at is
sue plain for the judgment of the
opinion of the nation is not to
propose any such principle. It is
based upon the very different
principle that the concerted ac
tion of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop the
industrial processes of the na
tion. er of the interstate commerce commis
sion to grant an increase of -rates on
the ground referred to is indisputably
clear, and a recommendation by the
congress with regard to such a matter
might seem to draw in question the
scope of the commission's authority or
its inclination to do justice when there
is no reason to doubt either.
The other suggestions the Increase
in the interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and in its facilities
for performing its manifold duties, the
provision for full public investigation
and assessment of industrial disputes,
and the grant to the executive of the
power to control and operate the rail
ways when necessary in time of war or
other like public necessity I now very
earnestly renew.
New Legislation Necessary.
The necessity for such legislation is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty of serving and safeguarding
them in such matters would find it
hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these, grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action.
Not only does the interstate com
merce commission now find it practical
ly impossible, with its present member
ship and organization, to perform its
great functions promptly and thorough
ly, but it is not unlikely that it may
presently be found advisable to add to
its duties still others equally heavy and
exacting. It must first be perfected as
an administrative instrument.
The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound industrial disturbances
for lack of additional means of arbi
tration and conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of the execu
tive to make immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
nation wherever they, are needed and
whenever they are needed.
This is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative efficiency
which argues its own case in the mere
statement of it. With regard to one of
its items, the increase in the efficiency
of the interstate commerce commission,
the house of representatives has al
ready acted. Its action needs only the
concurrence of the senate.
To Safeguard Industrial Processes.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should I
make it, that any man in any occupa
tion should be obliged by law to con
tinue in an employment which he de
sired to leave. j
To pass a law which forbade or pre
vented the individual workman to leave
his work before receiving the approval
of society in doing so would be to
adopt a new principle into our juris
prudence which I take it for granted
we are not prepared to introduce. But
the proposal that the operation of the
railways of the country shall not be
stopped or interrupted by the concert
ed action of organized bodies of men
until a public investigation shall have
been instituted which shall make the
whole question at issue plain for the
judgment of the opinion of the nation
is not to propose any such principle.
It is based upon the very different
principle that the concerted action of
powerful bodies of men shall not be
permitted to stop the industrial pro
cesses of the nation, at any rate before
the nation shall have had an opportu
nity to acquaint itself with the merits
of the case as between employee and
employer, time to form its opinion upon
an impartial statement of the merits,
and opportunity to consider all practi
cable means of conciliation or arbitra
tion. I can see nothing in that proposition
but the justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessary processes of its
very life. There is nothing arbitrary
or unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily
and unjustly done. It can and should
be done with a full and scrupulous re
gard for the interests and liberties of
all concerned as well as for the per
manent interests of society itself.
Three matters of capital importance
await the action of the senate which
have already been acted upon by the
house of representatives the bill which
seeks to extend greater freedom of
combination to those engaged in pro-

Urges the Passage of the
Corrupt Practices Act Reg
ulating the Expenditure of
- Money In Elections and Fa-
v vors More Freedom of Com

In Foreign Commerce.
motlng the foreign commerce of the
country than is now thought by some
to be legal under the-terms of the
laws against monopoly, the bill amend
ing the present organic law of Porto
Rico and the bill proponing a mole
thorough and systematic regulation of
the expenditure of money In elections,
commonly called the corrupt practices
act. I need not labor my advice that
these measures be enacted into law.
Their urgency lies in the manifest cir
cumstances wliich render their adop
tion at this time not only opportune
but necessary. Even delay would se
riously jeopard the interests of. the
country and of the government.
Immediate passage of the bill to reg
ulate the expenditure of money in
elections may seem to be less neces
sary than the immediate enactment of
the other measures to which I refer,
because at least two years will elapse
before another election in which fed
eral offices are to be filled, but it would
greatly relieve the public mind if this
important matter were dealt with
while the circumstances and the dan
gers to the public morals of the pres
ent method of obtaining and spending
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent observation and the methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied in
the light of present experience. And a
delay would have the further serious
disadvantage of postponing action un
til another election was at hand and
some special object connected with It
might be thought to be in the mind of
those who urged it. Action can be
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
Enlarging Our Export Trade.
I shall not argue at length the de
sirability of giving a freer hand in the
matter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those who shall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade. That enterprise will
presently, will Immediately assume,

REGULATE EXPENDITURE
OF ELECTION MONEY
Immediate passage of the bill
to regulate the expenditure of
money in elections may seem to
be less necessary than the imme
diate enactment of the other
measures to which I refer, be
cause at feast two years will
elapse before another election in
which federal offices are to be
filled, but it would greatly relieve
the public mind if this important
matter were dealt with while the .
circumstances and the dangers to
the public morals of the present
method of obtaining and spend- '
ing campaign funds stand clear
under recent observation and the
methods of expenditure can be
frankly studied in the light of
present experience.
-O
lias indeed already assumed, a magni
tude unprecedented in our experience.
We have not the necessary instrumen
talities for its prosecution. It is deem
ed to be donbtful whether they could
be created upon an adequate scale un
der our present laws. We should clear
away all legal obstacles and create a
basis of undoubted law for it which
will give freedom without permitting
unregulated license. The thing must
be done now, because the opportunity
is here and may escape us if we hesi
tate or delay.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of
Porto Rico Is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
its people are not just. We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There is uneasiness among the people
of the island and even a suspicious
doubt with "regard to our Intentions
concerning them which the adoption
5f the pending measure would happily
remove. We do not doubt what we
wish to do In any essential particular.
We ought to do it at once.
Legislative Annals Enriched.
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the two houses of which it is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be
found aod action taken upon them.
Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion I shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth congress, I
hope that you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure and satis
faction I have co-operated with you in
the many measures of constructive
policy with which you have enriched
the legislative annals of the country.
It has been a privilege to "labor in suc h
company. I take the liberty of con
gratulating you upon the completion
f afeeord of rare ervleeablenesa and
distinction.

In fact all of the best grades of Furs for this market at as low
prices as we have ever sold them. Most of the Muffs have
Scatfs to match. Don't you think that it will be best to buy
those sort of goods from someone who knows all about them
and will see that you get what you pay for.
We have about 25 NEW COATS that we shall make a
Special. Prices $9.98, 12.00 to 13.50 goods
25 NEW SUITS to close out, 25 discount.
We will do a little better than the other fellow as we are
bound to get our stock down to a lower level.
