Nl.w YoitK. Dec 7. The follow inc ed
itorials from some of the leading Journals
in the south are of interest as showing lio
that section iews the president's plan for
reducinc the revenue:
The Charleston (S. C ) -Voir md Cou
rier sajs: "The pnsident exposes with
cruel courtesy every fallacy of the protec
tion argument. Indeed, a stronger or more
comprehensive exposition of the weakness
ami inherent Inequality of the protec
tective system hasn't been pit en to the pub
lic. ThroiiRh It all. moreover, there runs a
vein of kindly sjmpathy and patriotic con
sideration. The manufacturer or work
man who reads this message
must be callous and suspicious, indeed,
it he Is not Impressed by It with an abiding
conviction that a readjustment of the tariff,
which should be committed to the president.
If that were practicable, would leave the
wotkingman in a better position than that
which he now holds."
The Xew Orleans Tiinc-I)rmrrit s-ivs:
"The president declares himself In no un
certain terms a revenue reformer and op
posed to protection, pure and simple, lie
would have the congress leave the internal
revenue alone and concentrate itself on the
work of reducing the tariff. We do not
agiee, with the president In re;ard to the
non-reduction of the tobacco tax. It is true
tobacco is not a necessity, but the tax is
troublesome ami burdensome to the agricul
tural producer and the cost of its collec
tion considerable."
The Atlanta Conrtltiiffim says: "The
message of the President concerns itself
s lel with the tariff question, and he dis
cusses It, ninosi exclusivity, irom hip
tmdpouit of Hrer Hill Morrison, of Illi
nois who was left at home by his esteemed
constituents on account of bis extreme
views. At the same time the President
doen't go as far as Brer Hill Morrison. He
pauses in the lesson which he gives to Con
gress to refer to the fact that the demo
crat c platform suggests protection for
American industries and American labor.
Ilurr is one fact, however, to which Mr.
Clew land fail to call attention, namely:
that the promises of the democratic plat
form can be carried out by the repeal of
the Internal revenue law, which
was .framed to suit an emer
gency long since passed and
which in its operation is odious and unjust.
That a man of practical common s nse.
like Cleveland, should walk into such
trap is surprising: but he ha not walked in
without protest, as his reference to the Chi
cago platfoi Hi hliowk."

ScsrceH Is one political campaign con
cluded before another is liegun.
This Is one of those self-evident truths
that needs no diagram or complicated ex
planation. It was sincerely hoped by the general
public that, at the close of the repent lively
campaign, we would be given a rest on pol
itics, at least until after the hoiSdajs, but
that Impe was a vain one. The Yechoes ol
the late stnnrcrle have hardlv dicdavvav. and
l)et we hnd ourselves right in the midst of
a campaign that bears all the impetuous ot
becoming not merelj hot but red-hot.
Tuis act i a good illustration of the
trite saving that there is no rest for the
w icked. There Is no rest for tl politician
who is ambitious to serve the good people
for a fat salary.
Ambitious politicians can do aj tliej
please, about appl)iug to themselves the in
ference to be drawn from the above that
they are "wicked."
Notwithstanding the fact tint it is al
most a )ear before we shall liave another
election which will ptrticuiary affect the
Inteiests of Clark county, candidates for
county otTices have already made them
selves known and are beginning to snaKe
hands with the festivevoter In a delic.onsly
fraternal wav. Inquiries, about the wives
and babies are not infrequent ami the
voter is again waklug up to I tie fact that he
is a most interesting personage.
The April election next jear will not cut

Xot long, prob-vhlj, after the April elec

of delegates to the state oonv ention will be
held. About the time of holding the county
convention there Is a will.; difference of
opinion, but the general sentiment seems to
favor as late a (omentum as is practicable.
The time and place of holding
the republican national convention will
probably be determined tomorrow, ( Thurs
day, and in the course of a mouth the
state committee will hold a meeting to hv
the time of holding the state convention
Juditliig from what members of the state
committee have eald through the press
about the convention, the fe. ling ivldently
is that it ought not to be held until a week
or ten d)s before the national convention.
thus preventing the verj common practice
of badgering half to death the delegates to
the national convention, which Is resorted

At what time, then fore, the new count)

go wide of the mark by naming for any of
the offices any one of the candidates for the
iespet ve pacts now mentioned.
It seems now that the contest for the
nomination for sheriff will beaprett) one,
as all the men who have been mentioned in
connection with that ofhee are wide-awake,
hustling republicans, wlio have always
been found in the fmqt of eery political
tray aud who have strong claims on the
party.
Slierln.
Mr. A. J. Ilaker.son of Mr.W. B. Bater,
the present sheriff, was probably the first
to announce himself as a candidate for the
office. He was tor three ) ears and half
one of Sheriff Fole) s deputies aud has been
hrst deputy during his father's administra
tion. Ijeulal, hearty . J. Iaker i)eeds no
introduction to the readers qf the M'!HI IC.
as he is one of the beat knon uet in the
county. The Clark county man (orwonun,
either) who has not met -.J Biker has
had a part of the pleasure of his life left
out He is a htjstlitg republican
and is thor lughly competent to pertorm the
duties of the nftlce.
Mr. If F. Hay ward having been men
tioned 111 connection with the nomination
for sheriff, a KEi'L'ut.ic representative
called upjn him and asked him whether or
not he was a candidate.
"Yes, sir. f an," he promptly and em
phatically replied. "J considered the ques
tion of becoming acmdldatefor some time,
tnd finally decided to go before tld people
and the convention, and I am in the race to
ttay."
Mr. IU) ward is quite as vvell known as
Mr. liaki-r. and as a political worker his
fame has gone far abroad. He Is a member
of the state central committee, aud his
counsel Is alwa)s heeded, as
be is recognized as one of the
sbrewdert and moat careful men en the
committee. Here at home he has been
known for ) ears as an active and aggres
sive republican, and his brilliant conduct
of the recent campaign is too well know 11
to need more than mere mentiun. His
work for the republican party has alwa) s
been effective and Ins friends claim that he
Is entltltd to the usufruct. He i thoroughly
competent and would nuke an excellent
oflicer.
Another candidate who has a strong fol
lowing for sheriff is Mr. Thomas E I.ott,
of 415 Clifton street, this city. He Is a
Clark county man, having been born and
brought up out in Greene township, aud he
resided there until two or three ear ago.
when he removed to Sornnjlleld. He is an
excellent mill in a'l respects an 1 a sterling
republican who lias done much effective
work for the party, lie has begun an ac
tivecampiign for the nomination and pro
poses to make it interesting for h s oppon
ents. Two other candidates are mentioned for
Ihe office of slierff, aud both are men who
will make a strong and determined fight
T) are Mr. Thomas K Stewart of Greene
township, and Mr John Waddle, of Madi
son township It th are earnest and em
tbusiastlo republicans, and as they have al
ways worked faithfully for the triumph of
republican principles, their claims 011 the
part) are made with th best possible rea
sons. Either one of them would make an
excellent sheriff, aud fie chances that one
of them wII secure the nomination, are not
small. ,
Treaaurrr.
It is seldom, indeed, thit better quilitied
candidates fur an nft -c ire announced than
those who have thus far signified their in
tention of mikilK the route. t for the nom
ination of count) treasurer. It is an im
portant ofli aud ought to lie filled by a
man thoroughly equipped iu every way for
the position.
Mr. George W. Collett who has been
deputy treasurer for many ) ears, has deter
mined this time to make a contest for the
nomination himself. He is widely known
among the residents of Clark county and Is
well liked by all. He is one of the truest
republican! . that walks the streets of
Springfield, and is alwajs work
ing to advance the interests of
the party. He Is thoroughly
wall fitted for the offloe by nature, by edu
cation and by experience and he would. If
elected, care well fur thecountv's pocket
book. Sir. J W. K Ohio has announced him
self, nt the solicit itlmi of a I irgo number of
his fronds as a candidate for the nomina

THE 8Ee LINE COLLISION.
liitt Conituetor Kearus Ought to Have
Dune in ttie Kliirrgeucy eterday.
The collision on the U;e Line at Shaffer
street yesterday morning, is still the pre.
vailing topic of conversation In railroad
circles. Said a prominent 11 ee Line offi
cial this morning;
"I am verv glad that if the aooldent hap
pened at all it occurred Just where it did. In
full sight, bo to kpeak, of the town It will
teaoh the railroad men the necessary lesson
of care, ana Mere no lass or life or
great dimaje incidental to it We are all
sorry for Kearns, the freight conductor, who
will eithir have his head cut off or
eNe te snpeuded and take a lower
position at th" end of it But lie certainly
acted nitli the most lamentably bid judg
ment. v Hat he ought to have done, when
his triin started, wis to have sent a brake
man tint ah-ad to t t the pxssenger train,
and then follow -it with his freight He
must have known it vvasrisk) to have come
on w ith a cut of cars and tried tn beat Xo. 1
tu tiie siding. You might do it with some
trains, hut with the fljinit fljcke)e'
whoop! It goes out of town as fast as an
Associated Press dlspitch."
The railroad people are sorely indignant
at the statement inadeb) onuof the Times'
kindergarten reporters li-t night, that the
accident was due to the fault of the opera
tor at Oiborn. The operator was perfectly
blameless.
THE STATION HOUSE,
The Condition of the tnstitntlon Udder
the almiacetiirtit or Col. Dotge.
The complaint made by Mr. Flavel l)an
forth, that persons who were merely unfor
tunate but not criminal, who were lodged
at the station house, were put lu among
persons of the vicious class, led a Kfi-ub-i.ic
representative to make a personal in
vestigition of the facts pertaining tn the
management of the instition. So far as
our representative could discover, persous
who appear to l merelj out of work, sick
or iu other ways unfortunate, are given
especial accommocations apart from the
other inmates. Colonel Dotze showed the
Hri'i'lli if man an upper room, where the
class alluded to were provided with space
on the llooi, a tire, blankets and soap and
water. Of course he cannot provide reg
ular hotel accommodations, but he is a
humane m vn. and allows no one, who is
merel) unfortiiiiite or even those who are
vicious or criminal, to suiter. Plenty of
wholesome food and blankets are given to
all, and the unfortunates need have no
further communication with other inmates
than the) desire.
