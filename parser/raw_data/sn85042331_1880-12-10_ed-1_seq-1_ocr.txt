A MASTERLY MESSAGE
PRESIDENT HAYES' LAST OF­
FICIAL DOCUMENT.
The Conclusions Reached After Four
Yean Service—'The Comntry in
a Prosperous Condition—
A General Review.
THE DOCUMENT.
In one respect the President's message
is exceptional, and that is the fact that it
is one of the few messages delivered to
Congress without first having been pub­
lished to the world. For years past the
annual message of the executive has been
the annual anxiety of newspaper row in
Washington. To obtain surreptitiously,
or otherwise, and publish the documeut
in advance of the convening of Congress,
has been considered a piece of newspaper
enterprise. Notwithstanding the extra
caution taken to prevent its being prema­
turely disclosed, in most cases it has been
captured bodily by the bohemians of the
press.
THE NEGRO QUESTION.
This year, in a somewhat lengthy dis­
course, the President first recapitulates
the position of the negro in the south, and
shoulders the responsibility of the virtual
disfranchisement of the colored popula­
tion upon the southern people, who by a
disregard of the constitutional amend­
ments regarding the rights of their sable
brethren, have prevented the betterment
of their condition, socially and politically,
for the past sixteen years. He states that
as long as the south shall disregard the
statutes on the negro question so longwill
the north be firm in their determination
to have them respected. To give the col­
ored race their proper position among
humanity, the free school system must
educate the masses of them and the peo
pie oi the south must show a disposition
to encourage the improvement, rather
than discourage it.
CITIL SEEYICE REFORM.
The first executive order issued during
Mr. Hayes' administration has obtained a
place in history and will ever be famous
for the total disregard paid it. "Execu­
tive order No. 1" was intended to place
the government officials above the plane
of political -wire pulling and to pYevent
the subverting of their positions to their
political advancement and tenure of of­
fice. Government clerks were warned
against political organizations, it being
the president's endeavor to make merit
the guarantee of continued service under
the administration. In this the president
was alone, not even having the support
of his own cabinet, it was so much a
part of the "red tape" system that it could
not be disentangled, and the order itself
stands only as a record of good inten­
tions. Mr. Hayes in other ways endeav­
ored to reform the civil service. In his
message he recommends the appointment
of a commission Avho shall establish a
uniform system of examinations for those
who may be applicants for positions,
and which commission shall beheld res­
ponsible for the just application of the
system. Twenty-five thousand dollars is
suggested for tlils purpose.
POLYGAMY.
Since the unfortunate birth of Mor
monism in this country, it has ever been
the subject of presidential messages, and
year after year, as little legislation has
been had upon the p«ljrgamous subject
as the national congress could have and
prevent criticism. Nothing but forcible
execution of the criminal laws agains
bigamy on the part of the department of
justice will meet the requirements of the
case. The president's visit to Utah this
last fall has firmly convinced him that
the obliteration "of this crime against
God and man is a national necessity, and
recommends that an entire new system of
government be organized for Utah, its
judges, governor or commissioners to OG
appointed by the president that laws be
passed disfranchising polygamists, con­
sidering them in the light of social out­
laws, rather than as citizens. Such vig­
orous and effective remedies for this dis­
graceful evil is recommended tlfht will
wipe this disgraceful fester from the his­
tory of the country. It certainly will
rendet famous the administration that
carries out the president's suggestions,
should congress stop "dilly-dallying"
with the important topic and subject it to
some healthy legislation such as recom
mended
111
Mr. Hayes' message.
INTERNATIONAL QUIETUDE.
The accustomed slice of
,fpeace
with all
the world" and its conventional etceteras
is given its stereotyped position in the
messa'ge. The placid relations of the
country with foreign powers is always an
appropriate subject for executive mess­
ages, and as a' mailer of international
courtesy is always dvvealt upon by for­
eign powers as well as the United States
in their address to their several legisla­
tive bodies. Aside from a few minor ef­
fronteries to the American eagle perpe­
trated upon the merchant marine by
Spanish offshoots in Peruvian and Cliil
an waters, little has transpired to affect
the world's tranquility as far as the Uni­
ted States are interested. International
expositions are having a congenial effect
in bringing the different nations of tha
earth into closer relations, moie firmly
establishing "peace on earth and good
will toward men," and steadily advan­
cing the spirit of a higher civilization
that notably characterizes the nineteenth
century. The country's trade and busi­
ness relations with all nations is gener­
ously dealt with in a manner commend­
able to the liberal minded views of the
executive chief.

Hayes after an administration of four
yeais, juarked by unusual progross and

SOCIETY.
prosperity throughout the land, it carries
with it greater interest than is usually
accorded in messages. As a resume of
the four years experience in his executive
capacity it is a valuable document. One
that contains many suggestions, the prac­
tical enactment of which will be of great
benefit. Mr Hayes retires from his po­
sition beloved by the people generally,
and-leaves behind him the records of ah.
administration that is a peer of any in
the history of the country.
GLEXMYE.
The Future Metropolis of the Yel­
lowstone Valley.
Much has been said pro and con about
the country in the vicinity of Glendive,
the point where the North Pacific strikes
the Yellowstone river, but one thing is
certain the valley, over twenty miles wide
extending down to Fort Buford, is one of
the prettiest and most fertile in the west.
Of course there are some bare buttes in
the vicinity of Glendive towsite, but a per­
son visiting Bismarck ten years ago
would have pronounced the country as
worthless, whereas time has demonstrated
the fact that it is one of the best wheat
districts in the world. This will probab­
ly be the experience of the new town, two
hundred miles west. Col. Merrill has just
received the plat of the new townsite arid
from it some interesting facts are' ob­
tained. The town is laid off in good
shape, the streets are all wide and in the
main run at right angles. It being an
army town many of the officers have been
immortalized, so to speak, in the naming
of the streets. There are twenty-four
blocks platted and the length of the long­
est streets north and south is twenty four
blocks, or about two miles. There are
eleven' avenues, running east and west, as
follows: Merrill, Anderson, Pierson,
Meade, Sargent, Nowlan, Taylor, Rosser,
Cunningham and River. The streets
nearly all run north and south and are
named as follows: McDougall, Gresham,
Gibson, Dilworth, Wright, Cook, Sig
mund, St. Clair, Kurtz, Winston, Scott,
Huston, Defrees, Keath, Churchill, Grant,
Hargous, Allard, Slocum, Relf Brennan,
Dodge, Borden, Clement, Penliam, Towne.
Bell, Valentine, Power, Mann, Clough,
and Douglass. There are several public
squares provided. Among them Floyd,
Belknap. Newport, Otis and Burns, and a
grand esplanade. Good judgment lias
been displayed in the platting of the town
and as to its future commercial standing
there can be no doubt. Several brick
blocks and many other business houses
are to be built next spring, and as soon
as the road strikes this point, which will
be about next may, Glendive will bo»^
Par Excellence. .•
No better bill lias ever been put on the
boards, than that nightly exhibited at
Whitney's Opera House. Six new people
have opened this weeK, which in connec­
tion with the splendid company on tyind,
forms a combination, that for versatility
and genuine talent, can't be beat. James
McBride, tlie champion drum soloist and
comedian, is matchless, and Tom Martin,
the sketch and burlesque artist, ditto.
Miss Georgie Unsworth and Annie
Rusliton area double team of character
and clog performers. Chas. Roach and
Adah Caslleton, just from the Hills, make
a big hit. Misses May and LeMoine are
always good, while it is idle to exalt the
virtues of "Davey the Bosting dandy".
The Weather.
At Bismarck the weather has been fine
with the exception of nine days during
the past thirty days. Yesterday the tlier
mometer registered forty above and to-day
it is 60 above. There has been about two
inches of snow but it is melting away,
and if the present weather continues the
holidays will not be celebrated by sleigli
rides. At Miles City there is considera
ble snow and Mr. Crump states that the
weather is very cold. Several of the
.Keogh stage line slock have died with
the epizootic and he was obliged to pur
chase more in Miles City.
Tlie Famous Trio.
Henry T. Crump arrived from Milc^i
Citjr Tuesday. He is oifle of the famous
trio, Bell, Williamson and Crump, who
started out a short time since for a grand
buffalo hunt. Mr. Crump left his part­
ners at Lake station, where they remain
for a few days hunting antelope. The
party killed two buffalo and several
deer, antelope, etc., had a good time, but
would have had still more sport, could
they have spared lime to go about forty
miles north of Miles City, where buffalo
are reported as very numerous.
Count of Mail.
Tlie government has ordered a count of
all the mini matter depositecf tor mailing
in the post offices throughout the country
the first week in December of each year.
Tlie count at the Bismarck office gives
the following result: Letters, other than
official, 3838 official letters mailed by of­
ficers of the government,
209 postal cards,
304 newspapers by publishers, 2l4i
transient newspapers, 202 packages of
merchandise, 23.
Iluftortl Kickers.
One hundred mules arrived this week,
bound for Fort Buford. Major Kirk is
now .negotiating for bids to take the ani­
mals to their destination. Mr. Bly will
take them for every other mule, the gov­
ernment to stand all loss, if any, by cold
weather. Later—Mr. Bly has received
the contract afa. -reasonable figure, and
siartedrlliem off Wednesday.
Northern Pacific Wheat.
There is at present stored in the various
elevators along the line of the Northern
Pacific about 1,200,000 bushels of wheat.
Duluih received 52o,513 bushels last
month and Minneapolis 120,000 bushels.
These shipments averaged eighty-seven,
per cent No. 1 hard. No country in the
woiId ever produced, such wheat. The
THIS AND THAT,
Put them Together and Draw Your
•wn Conclusions.
Some two months ago it will be remem­
bered two gentlemen from Chicago, rep­
resenting themselves' as connected with
the Chicago Tribune and Inter-Ocean, can­
vassed this and other cities on the line
with a view of publishing a letter in the
Inter-Ocean, as soon as the canvass was
completed. Those who paid money into
the hands of these gentlemen dobbtless
wonder why the letter has not appeared.
THE TRIBUNE about a month ago re­
ceived the subjoined letter from Mr. Ed
liolm but refrained from publishing it,
deeming it proper to await developments.
This week another statement, was received
for publication. The two are as follows:
FERGUS FALLS, MINW., NOV. 14,1880.
Editor Tribune:

of Bismarck, and 1 trust you will da it for me,
UMt through your paper, but to all enquirers.
Pagett is a villain, and I will tell y«u all about
him in a few wordB. We finished the canvass as
far as Casseltcn, when he became sick. I then
took him to St. Paul where I left him under
medical care. Awaiting his recovery that we
might conclude the canvass. I went down to see
my family, during which time that storm came
up and I must perforce remain a prisoner ten
days. Whea I arrived in St. Paul Mr. Pagett
had skipped out, and taken with him $250 00 of
Inter-Ocean and my money. This, of course,
made it impossible for me to publish,, and I
have been at work ever since completing lhe
canvass. The papers will be out shortly"n«w,
and onlv I shall be loser in the affair. Please
tell this to thoee who may ask about the matter.
I shall publish the details in full in the Inter
Ocean with the letter. I am your obedient

vant, K. O. L. KDHOLM.
Successful Season.
The Northern Pacific transfer, after a
most successful season, laid up for the
winter Saturday, the 4th. This is the
latest ever a boat run at this city and
there is still a clear channel but the build­
ing of the winter bridge on the ice des­
troyed the boat's usefulness. She is tied
up at the ways and will be protected by
numerous spiles which will be driven
around her before the spring break-up.
Capt. Wolfolk has gone to Mound City to
superintend the building of the new boat.
Mclican-Falconer.
On Friday evening last, at the residence
of Mr. Robt. Macnider, Hon. John A. Mc­
Lean, of the firm of McLean & Macnider,
was married to Miss Mary Falconer, of
this city. Ilev. I. O. Sloan performed the
ceremony. Mr. McLean is one of the
leading buriuess men and the marriage
takes fioiii society one of its leading spir­
its. The happy couple leceived the con­
gratulations of their many friends at the
Sheridan House. Friday night, and left on
Saturday's train for Chicago.
Open all Winter.
Efforts will be made to keep the Mis­
souri division open all winter. Snow
fences have been placed in position and
it is thought that little trouble from snow
will be encountered There are now sev­
en miles of ties and twelve miles of iron
at the find of the track. If the road is
kept open all winter enough material will
be shipped to the front to" build at least
fifty miles of road. Grading will contin­
ue all winter in the vicinity of the Yellw
stone.

To my Patrms and Friend*:
Owing to the fact that Mr. W. F. Pagett, who
was with me on my last trip along the North
Pacifie Railroad, aud whom I foolishly entrus­
ted with the lande which were to have paid
for the article and papers, saw fit to decamp
with said funds, 1 find myself at present, utterly
unable to get out the review as promised. But
take this method of informing those who have
invested, that the letter will be forthcoming at
as carly a day as possible. The winter has now
set in in earnest, and consequently noihing can
be done. Neither would it be of much value at
the present time. Under these circumstances I
crave the indulgence of my patrons, assuring
them that no matter what the cost or amount
of privation I personally shall be compelled to
undergo, the Review will be published as pro­
mised, and paid for. Had it not been for the
perfidy of Mr. Pagett the letter would have been
out more than a month qgo. Truly,

Perhaps the guilty party connected
"wfth the^Qtandtng Rook ''borecV weigirt''
affair will soon be found out. THE TRI­
BUNE still holds to the belief that neither
Gen. Carlin or Father Stephan knew
anything about the fraudulent weights,
but that since the discovery was made,
each department is anxious to saddle it
on to the other. Sheriff McKenzie went
down to the agency this week and sub­
poenaed about twenty to testify in the
matter before the Fargo court, and it is
probable that it will be deducted from
the testimony that the weights were
bored in the interest of neither the inter­
ior or war departments.

TELEGRAPH TO TRIBUNE
INTERESTING ITEMS
WASHINGTON.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9,—Senator Pad­
dock, of Nebraska, yesterday introduced
a bill in the senate, to enable the people
of Dakota to form a state government,
and for the admission of Dakota to the
Union on an equality with the original
stages.
SUPREME JUDGES.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—It is stated that
Devins and Stanley Mathews will be ap­
pointed supreme judges.
WILL FIGHT TO THE END.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—The republican
caucus last night resolved to fight to the
end the electoral count resolution now
pending in the house on the ground of
its unconstitutionality. It was the gener­
al opinion that the democrats did not
mean to use their resolution in any way
to jeopardize the results of the last elec­
tion but on principle the resolution was
unconstitutional.
POWDER EXPLOSION.
CHICAGO, Dec. 10.—The powder house
of Union Lime works, Chicago, blew up
yesterday killing two men.
PAGE-RILEY.
ST. PAUL, Dec. 10.—In the Page-Riley
case Austin Riley was held in $6,000 bail
for trial for attempted murder.
THEY WANT PROMOTION.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—It is believed
in Washington that the army officers who
are working for promotion are largely
responsible for the rumors of various re­
tirements to about'take place. The sec­
retary of Avar does not think McDonald
will-be retired nor Howard appointed to
West Point.
ANTI-CONKLIN.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.—The New York
senatorship is attracting considerable at­
tention- It is likely that D^pew. ^ill be
withdrawn oil account of iiis-connecfcione
with railroads and some other anti-Conk
ling candidate be brought out. There will
be a strong fight against the dictatorship
of Conkling.
SOLID GRIP.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.—It is rumored
that Vanderbilt and his friends have got
hold of enough Uunion Pacific stock to
control the next election and the stock the
last few days has risen from par to 107%.
CARELESS ACCIDENT.
CHICAGO, Dec. 10.—A train on the Mich­
igan Southern road ran into an Archer
avenue street car full of passengers night
before last. It threw it thirty feet, injur­
ing all the passengers more or less but
killing none.
IT WONT WORK.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10—It is doubtful if
the majority House committee will re­
port on McCook's bill to place Gen.
Grant on*the retired list with pay of Gen­
eral.
RICHARD DENIES.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.— A cable des­
patch saying that Secretary Thompson
had occupied the chairmanship of the Del
esseps Canal Company, is denied by Rich­
ard himself.
TROUBLE IN IRELAND.
LONDON, Dec. 10th.—The Irish land
leaguers propose to hold a meeting at
Monaghan to-day, and the anti-land
leaguers have called a meeting at the
same place and same time. The town is
full of excitement and the anti-land
league party, which is likely to be the
largest, will probably over-awe others.
GARFIELD'S PLURALITY.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—A complete
•table of the popular vote of the last elec­
tion shows that Garfield has a plurality
of 708 overall and 33,000 over Hancock.
The total vote was over nine millions,
and 772,073 over the vote of 1876.
