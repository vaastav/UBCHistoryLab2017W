HAGOOD.
Hagood, Dec. 2.-Everything that
Sumter touches turns to gold, whether
or no she puts forth an effort. Folks
were saying it? gala week would be a
tame affair; if they go they will see
how badly mistaken they were. Mr.
"Weeks made the impression on the
"writer once that the court house
square was a i sacred place when he
rode his horse over there and was
arrested. But the "holy place" (?)
has witnessed wholesale desecration
during the carnival. After now I can
ride my horse over and tieT^him to
the court house steps, yes I can and
yon shall see me when I do it.
It is a brave woman with great hu?
mor and much patience, endurance,
?and all that sort of thing who will
'.allow a buxom matron of near two
hundred, a comparative stranger, to
rush upon, fall and wallow on, and
3*ng her publicly. I repeat all that I
have said and much more when she
likes Gibraltar stands unmoved and
endures it all without the slightest
show of fear, impatience or excite?
ment. She is cultured, well bred and
endures the toading with perfect sang?
froid. 'Tn the soup?" A fly. Close
^akin in some respects to the toadie is
tte coat tail swinger, male or female,
"Imt I will not say nobler, or one can?
not so think of either, but not so base
as the former who never read that all
men are created equal while the latter
?are little whether it be true so long
as thy get the cash. Poor Verisoft
3knew both, the latter to his sorrow.
These last are busy folks, hunting suc?
cess, exceedingly polite, resenting the
presence of one poor ?apvwh?e they
are milking, but when the cow is dry
"the devil may take her. Of all people
the good Lord deliver me from the
coat tail swinger, who in the pursuit
of his -business is oblivious to every
-consideration that does not contribu?e
to his success. (
Jn a former article I said something
about our roads. I like a spotted
road when that is the best we can
have, like the one from the peninsula
--"to the city, but how much I would
prefer a good clay road all the way
iWhy can't we have that. There are
~?ew points on it where the clay is not
easily accessible. I am not quarrel?
ing with Mr. Seale, the major, as
some of the newspapers call him,
"though I think unnecessary work is
done in some places. What I would
asnggest is that the public turn out
generally, working the roads carefully,
letting tfce chaigang supplement that
work. That is what we ought, what
we can, I would be glad to write, what
are will do.
Pat said to the priest who berated
Inim for his sins, "Meenister, how are
the strates of Jarusalem kept so
well?" "I do not know, Pat, how?"
Tvery man kapes before his own door
elane." We can have good roads if
we will. Will we?
Mrs. Mary H. Kaile had a small
Ikouse, 15,000 pounds cotton seed and
^a large quantity of hay burned last
night, the 30th, together with carriage
ar>d buggy, barely saving her barn^.
stables and dwelling. It was evident?
ly the work of an incendiary, the fire
.creaking out about 3 o'clock in the
morning. For some days her : woods
have been on fire and when put out
wou'd in some way catch up again.
Spent Thanksgiving on DesSau~sure
State farm. All the convicts were
resting up. shut in. all saw the
trusties. One fellow tn there for rap:
asked io bo allowed to stay out. but
was refused, in the stockade which
is very comfortable, they gamble,
play cards, sing, dance and do what?
ever pleases them. Every one is an
innocent.
The corn, the corn, the corn! Xever
la all my life did I see such quantities.
The crop of last year was considered
fine, but Mr. Gardner said this year s
crop was fully twice as good. Nearly
^alf available room was full with a
hundred acres yet to be gathered, if
I could make corn that way I feel like
I would quit cotton.
Hog killing has already begun there.
They have forty or fifty in the penb j
with seventy-five or more at large toi
.Idll. They have a large !oc ot fine
cows, no sheep but a lot of beautiful
mule colts. They nev^er sel i them but
xalse for the farm, ?saw those ter
xible blood hounds andVecalied hew I
felt standing by their kennel teasing
-them one year ago when I felt some?
thing grab my thigh. Was I not glad
That it was only that mischievous W.
S. Thompson.
Mrs. Gardner served a most^umpt
iious dinner, to which Messrs. Jen?
kins, Burket and myself did ample
Justice. These young gents were well
satisfied with their su rou ridings whom
1 left in the merciful hands of Mr.
gardner's charming daughters.
I had nearly forgot to say this farm
will produce one bale per acre of cot?
ton. Everything, as you might expect,
?was in fine order.
PISGAH.
Pisgah, Nov. 29.-Oat planting ls

BROGDON.
Brogdon, November 30.-For the
past two weeks we have been having
ideal autumn weather, but this morn?
ing the temperature has fallen and
wraps are again in demand. Disman?
tling vegetation and showers of brown
leaves xell us that winter has come.
The gleanings of the fields are
about over. The monotonous sound
of the gin has ceased, for today is
Thanksgiving. Schools have closed
and teachers ,children and everybody
have gone to take part in the pleasures
of the carnival.
The fair price of . cotton this year
has done much for these parts, neariy
? everyone has paid his debts and yet
has something left. There is an air of
prosperity, which has not been visible
for some years past.
Large and well fertilized crops of
oats have already been put in and
farmers are now beginning to cast
about and arrange for another year.
Our new telephone line affords us
much pleasure. Tv*e are now in touch
with the surrounding towns and vil?
lages and the monotony of country
life is much relieved. Too much can?
not be said for the telephone.

DARK CORNER.
Dark Corner, Dec. 2.-We are hav- j
ing some cold, cloudy weather this ?
[evening, and I hoped it will rain soon
j and put out the fires that are burning
up the forests.
."While I was in your city last Wed?
nesday some one put or let out fire
in Greenland Savannah, about a mile
and a half northeast of where I live,
which burned until Thursday evening
when it came down on iny place, and
had it not been for relatives and kind
Iriendi it would have burnt me out
entirely. As it is I suppose I lost in
timber wood end litter not less than
$150, but thanks be to God that it was
no w^rse for it is alone through his
mercy that I have a house or ear of
corn on my place. This fire passed on
the west of my house, and yesterday
there was another fire east of me
that burned up Cap Witherspoon's
(a colored man that lives on Mr. Ezra
Geddings' place) hay stack in about
a half of mile of me. And I heard
last night that the old Broughton
house, in Fulton, Clarendon county
was burned Thursday (the 30th) eve?
ning, together wdth all the out build?
ings in the yard which makes two bad
burnings Fulton has had in less than
three weeks. Mr. James P. Law?
rence's fine, though old house, was
burned on the 16th of November with
all of its contents. Those were two
substantial buildings, though they had
been standing 50 years or over. If j
there was any insurance I am not
aware of it.
I had the pleasure of meeting many
of my friends while in your city Wed?
nesday and Thursday. x Had the pleas?
ure of meeting Congressman Lever
for the first time. I have formel a
fine opinion of him. I did not see
much of the carnival, as I expected to
reach your city at 9.15 a. m. and got
there at 12.40 pi m. Then walked
out to my brother's at Rocky Bluff,
and did not get back until nearly ll
o'clock Thursday morning, then I was
sick, and did not move around much
I saw the high dive Wednesday after?
noon. ?
Mr. Blanding Ardis has had some
nice buildings put up here on the
place he bought and will soon move
back here from Paxville.
Mrs. Annie Christmas and daugh?
ter. Miss Agnes, of near Manning
visited relatives and friends here last
week and the first of this, returning
home on Thursday.
Have no sickness to report and I
believe everything, except fire, is calm
and serene ir. these coasts.

right I hope. Come out Bro. Guv. un?

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
(Continued From Page One.)
As a people we have talked much
of the open door in China, and we ex?
pect, and quite rightly ,intend to in?
sist upon, justice teing shown u=; by
the Chinese. But we cannot expect
to receive equity unless we do equity.
We cannot ask the Chinese to do to us
what we are unwilling to do to them.
They would have a perfect right t)
exclude our laboting men if our la?
boring men threateneJ t> come into
their country in such numbers rs to
jeopordize the well-being of the Chi?
nese population.
This government has the friendliest
feeling for China end d sires China's
well being. We co?di l y syrnpath z3
with the announced purpose o? .iapart
to stand for the integrity of China.
Such an attitude tends lo the peace
of the world.
The civil service law has been on
the statute books for twenty-two
years. Every president and a vast
majority of heads of departments who
have been in office during that period
have favored a gradual extension of
the merit system. The more thor?
oughly its principles have been un?
derstood, the greater has been the
favor with which the law has been
regarded by administrative officers.
Our copyright laws urgently need
revision. They are imperfect in defin?
ition, confused and inconsistent in ex\
pression.
I recommend that a law be enacted
to regulate interstate commerce in
misbranded and adulterated foods,
drinks, and drugs. ASuch law would
protect legitimate manufacture and
commerce, and would tend to secure
the health and welfare of the con?
suming public. Traffic in foodstuffs
which have been debased or adulter?
ated so as to injure health or to de?
ceive purchasers should be forbidden.
During the last year the Philippine
Islands have been slowly recovering
from the series of disasters which,
since American occupation, have
greatly reduced the amount of agri?
cultural products below what was
produced in Spanish times. The war,
the rinderpest, the locust, the drought
and the cholera have been united as
causes to prevent a return of the pros?
perity much needed in the islands.
The income of the Philippine gov?
ernment has necessarily been reduced
by reason of the business and agricul?
tural depression in the islands, and
the government has been obliged to
exercise great economy to cut down
its expense, to reduce salaries, and in
every way to avoid a deficit.
There has been a marked increase
in the number of Filipinos employed
in the civil service and a corresponding
decrease in the number of Americans.
Improvements of harbors, roads and
bridges continue, although the cutting
down of the revenue forbids the ex?
penditure of any great amount from
current income for these purposes.
Tranquility has existed during the
past year throughout the Archipela?
go, except in the province of Cavite.
the province of Batangas. and the
province of Samar, and in the island
of Jolo among the Moros. The Jolo
disturbance was put an end to by
several sharp and short engagements,
and now peace prevails in the Moro
province. Cavite, the mother of la
drones in the Spanish times, is so per?
meated with the traditional sympa?
thy of the people for ladronism as to
make it difficult to stamp out the dis?
ease. Batangas was only disturbed by
reason of the fugitive ladrones from
Cavile. A year from next April the
first legislative assembly for the i.-i
ands will be hold. On the sanity and
self-restraint <>f this body much will
depend so far as Lin- future self gov?
ernment of the islands is concerned.
The most encouraging feature ?f
the whole situation has been th.- very
great interest taken by the common
people in education and nie greet in?
crease in the number <>f enrolled stu?
dents in the public soho*-?y. The in?
crease was from 300.000 to haifa mil?
lion pupils.
The agricultural conditions of the
islands enforce more strongly than
ever the argument in favor of reduc?
ing the tariff on th* products of the
Philippine Islands entering thetJnitcd
States. I earnestly recommend thar,
the tariff now imposed by the Dingley
hill upon the products of thc Pi??lip
pine Islands be entirely removed, ex?
cept the tariff on sugar and tobacco,
and that that tariff be reduced to 2?
per cent, of the present rates under
the Dingley act: that after Jury 1,
1909. the tariff upon tobacco and su?
gar produced between jthe islands anil
the United States in the products <>f
each country then be provided for by
law.
I do not anticipate that free trade
between the islands and the United
States will product' a revolution in the
sugar and tobacco production of the
Philippine Islands. So primitive are
the methods of agriculture in the
Philippine islands, so slow is capital
in going to tho islands, so many dif?
ficulties surround a large agricultural
enterprise in the islands, fa.it it will
!>o many, many years before the pro?
ducts of those islands viii have any
.-licet whatever upon the markets OJ
ile- United States. !
In my judgement immediate steps
should bc tak> :i for the fortification of
Hawaii. This is the most important
GOOD, big "mealy" potatoes
_I can not be produced with?
out a liberal amount of POTASH
in the fertilizer-not less than
ten per cent. It must be in the
form of Sulphate of POTASH of
highest quality.
"Kant Food" and "Truck Farming" are two practical
books which tell of the successful growing of potatoes and the
other carden truck-sent free to those who write us for them.

point in the Pacific to fortify in ord
to conserve the interests of this cou
try. It would be hard to overstate t
importance of this need. Hawaii
too heavily taxed. Laws should
enacted setting aside for a period (
say, twenty years 75 per cent of t]
internal revenue and customs receip
from Hawaii as a special fund to 1
expended in the islands for educath
and public buildings, and for harb
improvements and military and nav
defenses.
I earnestly advocate the adoptic
of legislation which will explici
confer American citizenship on all c
tizens of Porto Rico. There is. in n
judgment, no excuse for failure to c
this. The expense of the Feder
court of Porto Rico should be m
from the Porto Rican treasury. Ti
elections in Porto Rico should tal
place every four years, and the legi
lature should meet in session evei
two 'years. The present form, of go1
ernment in Porto Rico, which provid?
for the appointment by the presidei
cf the members of the executive cour
eil or upper house of the legislatur
has proved satisfactory and has ir
spired confidence in property, ownei
and investors.
I earnestly ask that Alaska be gi\
en an elective delegate. Some perso
should be chosen who can speak wit
authority of the needs of the Terr:
tory. The government should aid i
the construction of a railroad froi
the gulf of Alaska to the Yukon rive:
in American territory.
I recommend that Indian Territor
and Oklahoma be admitted as on
State and that Xew Mexico and Ari
zona be admitted as one State. Ther
is no obligation upon us to treat tei
ritorial subdivisions, which are mat
ters of convenience only, as bindin
-us on the ? question of admission t
statehood. There is no justificado
for further delay: and che advisabilit
of making the four Territories int
two States has been clearly establish
ed.
The treaty between the Unite?
States and the Republic of Panama
under which the construction of thi
Panama Canal was made possible
went into effect with its ratificatioi
by the United States Senate on Feb
ruary 22, 1904. Active work in cana
construction, manly preparatory, ha;
been in progress for less than a yea;
and a half. During that period twe
points about the canal have ceased tc
be open to debate. First, the ques?
tion of route; the canal will be bun
on the'Isthmus of Panama. Second
the cuesti?n of feasibility; there art
no physical obstacles on this route
that American engineering skill will
not be abb"* to overcome without st?
rions difficulty, or that will prevent
the completion of the canal within a
reasonable time and at a reas.?nable
cost. Tins is virtually the unanimous
testimony of the engineers who have
investigated the matter for the gov
NC-/ "
ernment.
The point which remains unsettled
is the question of type, whether the
cane.! shall be on . .??? several lo.-ks
above si-a U vol, <>r at sea level with a.
single ii ie mck. On this point 1 hope
to lay before the congress at an early
day chi findings of the Advisory board
of American and European engineer?,
that at my invitation have been con?
sidering the subject, together with
the report of the comm ss; >n thereon;
and such comments ther n or recom?
mendations in referen e thereto as
may seem necessary.
The American people is pledged to
the speediest possible construction of
a canal adequate to moot the demands
which the commerce of the world will
make upon it. and I appeal most ear?
nestly to the congress to aid in the
fulfillment of the pledge.
What is needed now and without
delay is an appropriation by the con.
gress te meet the current and accru?
ing expenses of the commission. The
first appropriation of $10.000,000, out
of the $13;").000.000 authorized by the
Spooner act. was made three y ers
ago. it is nearly exhausted. There
is barely enough of it remaining to j
carry the commission to the end of
the year. Unless the c ?ngress shall
appropriate before that time all work
must ciase. Ti> arrest progress for
any length of time now, when mattera
art- advancing s > satisfactorily, woul 1
be depdoable.
