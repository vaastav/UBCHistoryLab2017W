THE DYING AUTUMN DAYS.
The beautiful Autumn days are dying,
nearly dead. How gently, softly into the
silence of the night, steals her song of sor
row. It trembles with a hushed tenderness
of tone through the aisles and bowers of the
forest where it seems to whisper a prophecy
of coming nakedness and desolation. It
flows with mournful cadence along the
meadows where the streams will soon be
chilled into silence and loose their babbling
merriment, and all the flowers will fade into
dust and ashes, whilst the twinkling rays
of the far off stars gather into tear-drops
as they touch the current of its low, sad
melody, Beautiful exceedingly they are,
with that touching tinge of sadness about
them, which is ever beauty's most impres
sive charm.
Yes, the beautiful days of Autum have
nearly fled. Alone upon the hills the
shades of evening slowly creep like death
shades o'er an old man's soul. The sun
sheds but a faint and glimmering light
through the thick haze that gathers around
him as he sinks to rest upon the ocean bed.
All nature is hushed and still, bird and
beast and breeze, the voice of man, the
murmur of the streams come not to disturb
the sacred silence of the hour in which all
things seemed wrapped in silent grief—
mourning the departed glory of the bright
and beautiful Summer time. What an hour
for thought, wandering alone far from the
busy haunts of men, their cares and their
pleasures—amid the undisturbed solitude
of the woods.
"The Summer is gone, the harvest is
past." Since last we wandered along our
favorite path what a change has passed
over the scene! The sweet flowers that
bloomed all around, filling the airwith their
rich perfume, the blue violets raising their
heads to be kissed by the passing breeze,
the wild honeysuckle, and all the beauteous
sisterhood have yielded to the blighting
influence of Autumn and have gone down
to the dust from which they spruug.
" Heaped in the hollows of the grove, the withered
leaves lie dead;
They rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit's
tread."
But no more, in the green glory of the
Summer, to the merry piping of the even
ing's winds as they joyously roam through
the shady forest aisles. It brings a feeling
of keen regret, almost as if we were com
mitting sacrilege, when we crush them be
neath our feet. Yes, the beauty from the
forest has departed. The gay festoons of
green which Spring, in her benificence, had
hung so gracefully upon the proudly tower
ing branches of its trees have been swept
away by the pitiless winds, and they are
now traced in dull, dark nakenness upon
the cold and misty sky.
No verdure is left save upon the pine
and scattering holly and cedar trees, which
present to the eye the same lifeless green
in Spring, in Summer, in Autumn, and in
Winter—never varying—never changing,
like the heart of stoics over which sweep
with like effect the songs of mirth or the
lamentations of sorrow. Amid the naked
ness and desolation around, they stand out
like those green spots in the waste, which
memory spreads out before the vision of
the breaking heart, on which though it may
repose for awhile, it brings no soothing
influence to heal its sorrows.
Although the Autumn days are dying, a
few royal tints still linger, as it were, to
shake off the floating vapors. There are no
tears in their eyes, but the mists are gather
ing there, which tell of tears to come. For
whilst the year, as it has passed, has poured
her bounteous yield into the garners of the
husbandmen, poverty, want, suffering, hun
ger and cold, will follow in their footsteps
for the desolate children of humanity. The
surly blasts of December will find their way
into many a stricken homestead upon
whose hearthstone no fire will be kindled,
where poverty sits croakingits dismal mon
otone upon household altars, around which
are gathered helpless ones, who cry for
bread, and for the poor pittance which
should shield them from the pinching cold—
hunger in this land of plenty, cold in the
midst of warmth, denied the common com
forts of life, whilst so many are burdened
with luxuries.
No wonder that this beautiful season
leaves us with her heart throbbing with
tenderness and pity—well may it sigh and
weep as it looks behind and sees who and
what are following so closely—the lean,
lank, wild-eyed, pale and ghostly crew of
human miseries.

Louisville Courier-Journal: Never put

New York Tribune: What would the

fools?
Washington Post: Come to think of it,
we can't recall any former Presidents who

Memphis Commercial Appeal: Did you

New Orleans Picayune: It is mighty
easy to trade your reputation for money,
but you are up against it when you try to

considered one of the finest food produc

Lake Charles Times: One great reason
we find so many tramps in such prosperous

that if he loses one job for getting on

another one. He feels that he no longer
has to preserve the respect of his employer

$20,000 for 1912 Pecans.
Rich Hill (Mo.) Review. !
Now that the pecan season is practically
over in this section of the country, it might
be interesting to note that the Hich Hill
buyers alone paid out a little over $20,000
for pecans during the past two months.
These nuts were all delivered to the local
dealers and then shipped out to the city
markets. The above figures are absolutely
correct, as they were taken from the deal
er's returned checks. The highest price
paid was 1SH cents per pound and the
lowest 5 cents per pound. Besides the
above, there were probably $5,006 worth
shipped out by individuals, and hundreds
of ponuds, no doubt held over for future!

Levee Board Proceedings.
A meeting of the Board of Commission
ers of the Bossier Levee District was held
this day, Friday, at the office of the board,
in the First National Bank Building,
Shreveport, La., with the following named
members present: Mr. H. N. Carlton,
President; and Messrs. W.C. Raines, W. H.
Hodges, jr., J. H. Mercer, A. Curtis and
E. B. Herndon. Absent: T. W. W. Stin
son.
The minutes of the meeting of August
22, 19i2, were read and approved.
Mr. W. B. McCormick appeared before
the board for himself and for the council
of the Village of Bossier and requested
that the work of building the Bossier levee,
opposite the City of Shreveport, recently
let to Mr. Montgomery, be postponed for
the present. Mr. Lombard, Assistant State
Engineer, was of the opinion that there
was no urgent necessity for the proposed
work; and that unless the caving contin
ued opposite Texas Street on the Bossier
side, the proposed new levee might not be
necessary.
He stated further, that the line of levee
as proposed would confiscate a number of
lots entirely; and that as he and Mr. S. S.
Hunter were largely interested in property
in Busier City, they, together with the
council of Bossier, would obligate and
agree in writing that if the work of build
ing this levee can be postponed, they will
make satisfactory settlement with Mr.
Montgomery; and at any time that this
board thinks it is necessary, they will at
their own expense build a run around to
protect the present levee until the line of
levee, as recently laid off, can be built.
After a full discussion of the matter, it
as the sense of the meeting that the work
of building a new levee should be post
poned for the present on the condition pro
posed by Mr. McCormick; and on motion
of Mr. Herndon, seconded by Mr. Hodges,
the President of the Board was authorized
to enter into an agreement with Mr. Mc
Cormick, Mr. Hunter and the Town Coun
cil of Bossier, agreeing to the postponement
of this work, on condition that they will,
whenever called upon by the board, do
such protection work as may be necessary
until a new contract ean be let and a new
levee completed.
Mr. Simms, President of the Shreveport
Cottonwood Company, appeared before the
board and asked the Secretary to read a
letter recently received by him from the
Board of State Engineers relative to his
emoving improvements off the levee. He
requested that the board give him a little
time to take off the improvements, which
have been complained of for several
months.
On motion of Mr. Herndon, duly second
ed, Mr. Simms was advised that unless he
could secure the consent of the Board of
State Engineers that the improvements
remain for the time as desired by him, this
board would insist that they be removed at
once.
Following a general discussion as to the
need of a regular paid inspector for the
levees, the President was, on motion, au
thorized to employ an inspector at such
salary as he sees proper, and also such
labor as may be necessary to thoroughly
remove all stumps and weeds from the
levees, and to keep the levees in good
condition. The President was authorized
to purchase two mules and a wagon and
from time to time such necessary feed,
gear, etc., as in his judgment he may see
proper.
Following a general discussion of the
flooding of the back lands in the lower end
of the district, the President was author
ized to arrange for a preliminary survey,
with a view of determining what would be
necessary, to relieve these lands from over
flow; the President being authorized, if
necessary, to employ J. Y. Snyder to run
levels and make a survey.
On motion, duly seconded, a committee
was appointed, consisting of Messrs. Hern
don, Hodges and Curtis, with authority to
let contracts for removing the rafts in Red
Chute from the John A. Skannal place
north at a cost not to exceed $2,500.
The Secretary and the President were
authorized to honor all orders from this
committee on account of such work to the
extent of $2,500, the amount appropriated
to cover same.
On motion, the Secretary was directed
to transfer $781.24 deposted at Continental
Bank and Trust Company, and $48.44 de
posited at the Commercial National Bank
of Shreveport, to the credit of the Bossier
Levee Board, with the State Treasurer.
There being no further business, the
meeting then adjourned.

Corn Growing in the South.
Baltimore Manufacturers' Record.]
The records in corn-growing that have
been made in the Southern States in the
past few ye^rs directing attention to the
vast possibilities of the South in corn
growing should emphasize the importance
to the South of the Fifth National Corn
Exposition, which will open at Columbia,
S. C., on January 27th. In 1889 in a world
contest in corn-growing Capt. Zachariah J.
Drake of Marlboro County, South Carolina,
won the first prize, with a record of 255
bushels of shelled corn, or 239 bushels of
crib-cured corn, on one acre of land. The
corn exposition will revive interest in that
South Carolina record, and will give an
impetus to improve methods of agriculture
all over the South. It will also bring from
all parts of the country expert agricultur
alists, with their minds open to new con
ditions and opportunities, and it can be
made an effective agency in developing
the agricultural interests of that section.
