Washington, Dec. 4—Following is the
fall text of the president's message,
which was sent to congress today:
To The Congress ol the United States:
The constitntional duty which re
quires the president from time to time,
to give to the congess information of the
state of the union, and recommend to
their consideration such legislation aa
be shall judge necessary, is fittingly
entered npon by commending to the
congreee a careful recommendation of
the detailed statements and well sup
ported recommendations contained in
the reports of tbe heads of the depart
ments, who are chiefly engaged with
the executive work of tbe government.
In an effort to abridge tbis communica
tion as much as ia consistent with ita
purpoae, I ahall aupplement a brief
reference to the contents of the depart
mental reporta, by the mention of auch
executive business and incidents aa are
not embraced therein, and by auch
recommendations aa appear to be at
this par'ieular time appropriate.
008 FOREIGN RELATIONS.
While our foreign relatione have not
not at all times during the past year
been entirely free from perplexing and
embarrassing situations, nothing re

fairness and love of justice,which joined

missions boundary dispute, tendered to
the president by tbe Argentine republic
and Brazil, it has been my agreeable
duty to receive tbe apecial envoye com
missioned by the c atatee to lay before
me tbe evidence and arguments ia be
half of their reapective governmenta.
THE BRAZILIAN REBELLION.
The outbreak of domeatic hostilities
in the republic of Brazil found tbe
United Statea alert to watch the inter
ests of our citizens in that country, with
which we carry on an important com
merce. Several veeaele of our new navy
are now, and for aome time have been,
stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The strug
gle being between the established gov
ernment, which controla the machinery
of adminiatration, and with which we
maintain friendly relatione, and certain
officers of thi navy, employing the vee
aele of their command in an attack upou
the national capital and chief seaport,
and lacking as it does the ele
ments of a divided adminiatration,
I have failed to fee tbat tbe
ineurgenta can reaaonably claim recog
nition as beltigerente. thus the posi
tion of our government haa been tbat
of an attentive, but impartial observer
of the unfortunate conflict. Emphasizing
our fixed policy of impartial neutrality
in aucb a condition of affaire as now
exiata, I deemed it necessary to disavow
in a manner to be misunderstood the
unauthorized action of the late naval
commander of these waters in saluting
the revolted Brazilian admiral, being
indiapoeed to countenance an act calcu
lated to give gratuitoua aanction to a
local insurrection.
CHILEAN CLAIMS.
The convention between our govern
ment and Obile, having for ita object
tbe aettlement and adjustment of tbe
demands of tbe two countriea against
each other haa been made effective by
tbe organization of tbe claims commis
sion provided for. The two govern
ments failing to agree upon tbe third
member of tbe commission, the good
offices of the preeident of the Swiaa re
public were invoked aa provided in the
treaty, and the aelection of the Swiaa
repreaentative in thia country to com
plete the organization waa gratifying to
tbe United Statea and Obile.
MINIBTER KAGAN RBRUKBD.
The vexatioua queation of the no
called legation aaylum for offenders
againat the atate and ita lawa, wae pre
sented anew in Chile, by the unauthor
ised action of the late United Statea
minister in receiving in hia official resi
dence two persons who had failed in an
attempt at revolution, and againat
whom criminal chargea were pending
-wing out of a former abortive dia
9. Tbe doctrine of aaylum as
to thia caae ia not sanctioned by
precedent, and wben allowed
encourage sedition and atrife.
o circumatancoa can the repre
ss t»f thia government be per
inder the ill-defined fiction of
extra territory to interrupt the adminia
tration of criminal justice in the coun
triea to which they are accredited, A
temperate demand having been made
by the Chilean government for the cor
rection of thia conduct, in the inatam a
mentioned, the minister waa instructed
no longer to harbor the offenders.
CHINESE REGISTRATION.
The legislation of laat year known aa
The Herald
Satisfactory.
Matter-of-Fact Manner.
the Geary law, requiring the registra
tion of all Chinese laborers entitled tc
reaide in the United Statea, and tbe de
portation of all not complying with the
provisions of tbe act within tbe time
prescribed, met with mnoh opposition
from the Chinamen in this country.
Acting upon the advice of eminent coun
sel that the law was unconstitutional,
the great mass of Chinese laborers, pend
ing a judicial decision ac to ita validity,
In good faith declined to apply for thair
certificates, required by ita provisions.
A teat, upon proceeding by habeas cor
pus, wae brought before the supreme
court, and on May 15, 1893, a decision
waa made by that tribunal sustaining
the law.
It ia believed under the recent amend -
ment of tbe act extending tbe time for
registration tbo Chinese laborers there
to entitled who desire to reside in thia
country will novt avail themselves of
the renewed privilege thus afforded of
establishing by lawful procedure tbeir
right to remain, and that thereby the
necessity of enforced deportation may
be to a great degree avoided.
MURDERED MISSIONARIES.
It haa devolved upon the United
Statea minieter at Pekin, aa dean of the
diplomatic body, in the absence of a
repreaentative of Sweden and Norway,
to press npon tbe Chinese envariimaiil
pwfeaian nnasiohories it Sung Pn. Thie
queation is of vital intereet to all coun
triea whoso citizens are engaged in mis
sionary work in the interior.
THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE.
By article XII of tbe general act of
the Bruesela congress, signed July 2,
1890, for the suppression of tho slave
trade and the restriction of certain in
juries to commerce in the independent
atate of tbe Congo and in the adjacent
States of central Africa, tbe United
Statea and other signatory powers
agreed to adopt appropriate means for
the punishment of persona selling arms
and ammunition to the nativea, and for
the confiscation of the inhibited arti
cles. Jt being the plain duty of this
government to aid in suppressing the
nefarious traffic, impairing as it doea
the praiseworthy and civilizing efforts
now in that region, I recommend that
an act be passed prohibiting the Bale of
arms and intoxicants to the nativea in
the regulated zone, by our citizena.
EXTRADITION CONVENTIONS.
Costa Rica haa lately testified its
friendlineaa by aurrenderlng to the
United Statea, in the absence of a con
vention of extradition, but upon duly
eubmitted evidence of criminality, a
noted fugitive from justice. It ia
trusted that the negotiations of a treaty
with that country, to meet recurring
cases of this kind, will aoon be accom
plished. In my opinion, treaties for re
ciprocal relatione should be concluded
with all those countries with which the
United States haa not already conven
tional arrangementa of that character.
I have deemed it fitting to expreea to
the governments of Costa Rica aud
Colombia tne kindly desire of the
United Statea to ace their pending
boundary dispute finally concluded by
arbitration to conformity with the spirit
of the treaty concluded between tbem
some yeara ago.
FRANCE AND GERMANY.
Our relatione with the French repub
lic continue to be intimate and cordial.
I sincerely hope that the extradition
treaty with tbat country, aa .amended by
the eenate, will be operated. While
occasional queationa affecting our natur
alized citizena returning to the land of
their birth have arisen in our intercourse
with Germany, our relations with tbat
country continue aatisfactory.
RELATIONS WITII GREAT BRITAIN.
The queationa affecting our relatione
with Great Britain have been treated
inaapiritof friendliness. Negotiationa
are in progress between the two govern
menta with a view to auch concurrent
action aa will make the award and regu
lations agreed upon by tbe Behring sea
tribunal of arbitration, practically ef
fective, and it ia not doubtful that Great
Britain will co-operate freely with thia
country for the accomplishment of that
purpose. '
The dispute growing out of the dis
criminating toll imposed on the Wel
land canal upon cargoes of cereals bound
to and from tbe lake ports of the United
States, waa adjusted by tbe substitution
of a more equitable achedule of chargea,
and my predeceaeor thereupon sus
pended hia proclamation imposing dis
criminating tolls upon British transit
through our canals.
The requeet for additiona to the Hat of
extraditable offenses covered by tbe
existing treaty between tbe two coun
tries ia under conaideration.
TROUBLE WITH HAYTI.
During the pact year an American
LOS ANGELES: MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 4, 1893.
citizen, employed in a inbordinate com
mercial position in I lay ti, after suffer
ing protracted imprisonment on an un
founded charge of smuggling, was
finally liberated on a justice examina
tion. Upon urgent representation to
the Haytian government suitable in
demnity was paid to tbe sufferer. By a
law of Hayti • sailing vessel having dis
charged her cargo, ia refused clearance
until the duties on inch cargo have
been made. Tbe hardship of tbis
measure upon American shipowners,
who conduct tbe bulk of the carrying
trade of that country, ha* been insisted
on, with a view of securing a removal of
thia cause of complaint.
THE AMAPALA AFFAIR.
Upon receiving authentic information
of the firing upon an American mail
eteamer touching at tbe port of Amapala
because her captain refused to deliver
up a passenger in transit from Nicaragua
to Guatemala, upon demand of the mil
itary authorities of Honduras, onr min
ister to that country, under instructions,
protested against the wanton act and
demanded satisfaction. The government
of Honduras, actuated by a sense of jus
tice and in a spirit of the utmost friend
ship, promptly disavowed the illegal
conduct of its officers and expressed sin
cere regret for the occurrence.
It is confidently anticipated that a
satisfactory adjustment will soon be
reached of the questions arising out of
tbe seizure and use of American vessels
by insurgents in Honduras, and tbe
subsequent denial by the successful
government of commercial privileges to
these vessels on that account. .
SOLICITUDE FOR LIBKRIA.
A noiabie port ot tile southeasterly
coast of Liberia, between the Oavally
and San Pedro rivera, which for nearly
half a century baa been generally rocog
nized aa belonging to that republic by
accession and purchase, haa been
claimed to be under tbe protectorate of
France, in virtue of agreements entered
into by the native tribea, over whom
Liberia's control baa not been well
maintained. More recently negotiations
between the Liberian repreaentative
and the French government resulted in
tbe signature at Paris of a treaty
whereby, as an adjustment, oertain
Liberian territory ia ceded to
France, thia convention, at laat ad
vices, had not been ratified by the Li
berian legislature, and tbe executive
feeleng a sympathetic intereet in the
fortune of the little commonwealth, the
establishment and development of
which were largely aided by the benev
olence of our countrymen and which
conetltutee the only independent sov
ereign state on tbe west coast of Africa,
thia government has suggested to tbe
French government ita earnest concern
ieat territorial impairment in Liberia
should take place without her uncon
strained consent.
FRIENDSHIP FOR MEXICO.
,/ogtinmj
which abould alwaya characterize the
intercourse of two neighboring repub
lics. Tbe work of relocating the monu
ments marking tbe boundary between
the countriea from Paßo del Norte to the
Pacific, ia now nearly completed. Tbe
commission organized under the con
ventions of 1884 and 1889, it ia expected,
will aneadily aettle the diaputee growing
out of tbe shifting currents of the Rio
Grande river, east of El Paso.
AFFAIRS IN NICARAGUA.
Nicaragua haa recently passed through
two revolutions, the party at firat suc
cessful having in turn been diaplacad by
another. Our newly appointed minister
by hia timely good effortß aided in a
peaceful adjustment of the controversy
involved in the first conflict. The large
American interests established in tbat
country in connection with the Nicara
gua canal were not molested.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
The canal company haa unfortunately
become financially seriously embar
rassed, but a generoua treatment baa
been extended to it by the government
of Nicaragua, and the United Statea are
especially interested in tbe successful
achievement of the vaat undertaking
thia company baa in charge. That it
should be accomplished under diatinc
tively American auapiceaand ita enjoy
ment assured not only to tbe vessels of
thia country, aa a channel ,of commer
cial communication between out Atlan
tic and Pacific seaboards, but the ships
of the world in the intereeta of civiliza
tion, ia a propoaition which in my judg
ment doea not admit of queation.
Guatemala's trials.
Guatemala haa alao been visited by
tbe political viciaeitudes which have
afflicted her Central American neigh
bora, but tbediaaolutionof its legislature
and the proclamation of tbe dictatorship
have been unattended by civil war.
new extradition treaties.
An extradition treaty with Norway
has recently been exchanged and pro
claimed. The extradition treaty with
Kusaia eigned in March, 1887, and
amended and confirmed by the aenate in
February laat, waa duly proclaimed laat
June.
the samoan settlement.
Led by a deaire to compoae tbe differ
ence and contribute to the restoration of
order in Samoa, which for aome yeara
previoua had been tbe scene of conflict
ing foreign pretensions and native
atrife, the United Statea, departing from
ita policy conaeoiated by a century of
observance, entered four yeara ago into
tbe treaty of Berlin, thereby becoming
jointly bound with England and Ger
many to establish and maintain
Malietoa Laupepa aa king of Samoa.
The tieaty provided for a for
eign court ol justice, a municipal council
for the dietrict of Apia, with a foreign
preeident thereof, authorized to advise
the king a tribunal for the aettlement
of native and foreign land titlea, and a
revenue ayatem for tbe kingdom. It
entailed upon the three powers tbat
part of the coat of the new government
not met by the revenue of tbe islands.
Early in tbe life of thia triple protector
ate, the native dissensions, it waa de
signed to quell, wero revived. The re
vivers defied the authority of the new
king, refusing to pay taxes and
demanding tbe election of a ruler by
native suffrage. Mataafa, an aspirant
to tbe throne, and a large number of hit
native adharenta were in open rebellion
on one of tbe islands. Qaite lately, at
tbe request of tbe other powers, and in
fulfillment of its treaty obligation, this
government agreed to unite in a joint
military movement of such dimensions
as would probably secure the surrender
of the insurgents without bloodshed.
The warship Philadelphia was accord
ingly pnt under orders for Sa
moa, but before she arrived
tbe threatened conflict was pre
cipitated by King Mataafa's attack
upon tbe insurgent camp. Mataafa
was defeated and a number of men
killed. Tbe British and German vessels
present subsequently secured the sur
render of Mataafa and bis adherents.
Tbe defeated chief and ten of bis prin
cipal supporters were deported to a
German island of tbe Marshall group,
where tbey are held as prisoners under
the joint responsibility and cost of the
three powers. This incident and the
events leading up to it signally illus
trate the impolicy of entangling alli
ances with foreign powers.
bpain'b delinquency.
More tban 15 years ago this govern
ment preferred a claim against Spain, in
behest of one of our citizens for pro
perty seized and confiscated in Cuba.
In 1886 tbe claim was adjusted, Spain
agreeing to pay unconditionally as a
fair indemnity, $1,500,000. A respect
ful, but earnest note was recently ad
dressed to the Spanish government in
sisting upon tbe prompt fulfillment of
its long neglected obligation.
Other claima preferred by tbe United
States against Spain in behalf of Ameri
can citizens for property confiscated in
Cuba have been pending fnr many years.
At tbe time of Spain's title to tbe Caro
line islands was confirmed by arbitra
tion, tbat government agreed that the
rights which had been acquired there by
American missionairies should be recog
nized and respected. It is sincerely
hoped that tbis plan will be observed
by allowing our missionariea who were
removed from Ponape to a place of
safety by a United Slates warship dur
ing tbe late trouble between the Span
ish garrison and the natives, to return
to their field of usefulness.
A TOKEN OK AMITY.
The reproduced caravel Santa Maria,
built by Spain and sent to the Colum
bian exposition, has been presented to
tbe United States in token of amity and
in commenoration oi the event it wa9
designed to celebrate. I recommend
that, in accepting this gift, congreee
make a grateful recognition of the sin
cere friendship which prompted it.
RELATIONS WITH THE PORTE.
Important matters have demanded
attention in our relatione with the Ot
toman porte. Tbe firing and partial
destruction by an unrestrained mob ol
one of the school buildings of the An
atolv college, established by citizens of
the United St»t,SJi at Marsovau, and the
government to tbe""outra'ge, f notwith
standing tbe complicity of soma of its
officials, called for an earnest remon
stration, which was followed by prom
fsra of reparation and punishment of
tbe offenders. Indemnity for tbe
injury to the buildings and permission
to rebuild was given. Tbe registration
of the school property in the name o(
tbe American owners was secured
and etticioient protection guaranteed.
Information received of maltreatment
suffered by an inoffensive American
woman, engaged in missionary work in
Turkish Kordistan, was followed by such
representations to tbe Porte as resulted
in th* assurance of orders for the pun
ishmentof ber assailants, tbe discharge
of a delinquent officer and the issuance
of orders for tbe proieCon of
our citizens engaged tn m -:jionary
and other lawful work in that quarter.
Turkey complains that her Armenian
eubjecte obtain citizenship in thia coun
try, not to identify themselves in good
faith witb our people, but with the in
tention of returning to tbe land of their
birth and their engaging in sedition.
This complaint is not wholly without
foundation. A journal published in thia
country in the Armenian language openly
counsela ita readera to arm, organize and
participate in tbe movement for the
subversion of Turkish authority in tbe
Asiatic provinces. Tbe Ottoman gov
ernment has announced ita intentions to
expel from its dominion Armenians who
have obtained naturalization in tbe
United Statea since 1808. The right to
exclude any or all clauses of aliana ia an
attribute of sovereignty. It ia a right
asaerted and to a limited extent enforced
by the United Statea with the eanction
of our highest courts.
There being no naturalization treaty
between tbe United Statea and Turkey,
our minister at Constantinople haa been
instructed tbat, while recognizing the
right of the government to enforce its
declared policy againat naturalized
American-Armenians, be is expected to
protect tbem from unnecesaary harsh
ness of treatment.
VENEZUELAN AFFAIRS.
The boundary dispute between Vene
zuela and British Guiana ia aa yet un
adjusted. Tbe reatoration of diplomatic
intercourse between that republic and
Great Britain and reference of tbe quea- !
tion to impartial arbitration would be a
moat gratifying consummation. The
ratification by Venezuela of tbe conven
tion for tbe arbitration of the long de
ferred claim of the Venezuelan trans
portation company, ie awaited.
In view of the impaired financial re
sources of Venezuela, consequent npon
tbe recent revolution there a modified
arrangement for the aatiafaction of the
awards of the late advisory claims com
mission, in progressive installments,
has been assented to and payments are
being regularly made thereunder.
THE HAWAIIAN DIFFICULTY.
It ia bardly necessary for me to Btate
tbat the questions arising from our re
lations with Hawaii have caueed serious
embarrassment. Just prior to tbe in
stallation of the present administration
tbe existing government of Hawaii bad
been suddenly overthrown and a treaty
of annexation had been negotiated be
tween the provisional government of tbe
ialanda and tbe United Statea
and submitted to tbe senate for
ratification. This treaty I with
drew for examination and diapatcbed
Hon. James F. Blount of Georgia to
Honolulu aa a special commissioner to
make impartial investigation of the
circumstances attending tbe change of
government, and of all tbe conditions
bearing upon the subject of the treaty.
After a thorough and exhauative exam
ination Mr. Blount aubmitted to me hia
report, ehowing beyond all ques
tion that tbe conatitutional gov
ernment of Hawaii had been
aubverted with the active aid of
our representative to that government
and throngh tbe intimidation caused by
the presence of an armed naval force of
the United Statea, which waa landed for
that purpoae at the instance of our min
ister. Upon the facts developed it
seemed to me the only honorable course
for our government to pursue waa to
undo tbe wrong that had been done by
tboae representing us, and to restore as
far aa practicable tbe atatus existing at
the time of our forcible intervention.
With a view of accompliehing tbia
reault within the conatitutional limits
of executive power, and rocognizing
all our obligatione growing out of any
changed conditions brought about by
our unjustifiable interference, our pres
ent minister to Honolulu baa received
appropriate inatructiona to tbat end.
Tbua far no information of tbe accom
pliahment of any definite reaulte bas
been received irom him. Addi
tional advices are soon expected.
When received they will be
promptly cent to the _ congreas,
together-with all other information at
band, accompanied by a special execu
tive message fully detailing ' the acts
necessary to a complete underatanding
of the case and presenting a history of
all the material eventa lead
ing up to the present eituation.
INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.
By a current resolution paeeed by the
senate February 14, 1890, and by the
house of representatives tbe 3rd of April
following, the preeident waa requested
to invite from time to time, as fit occa
sion may arise, negotiationa with any
government with which the United
Statea haa or may have diplomatic rela
tione, to the end tbat any dif
ference or diapute arising between the
two governmente, which cannot be ad
justed by diplomatic agency, may be
referred to arbitration and be peaceably
adjusted by euch means. April 15,
1890, the International American con
ference of Washington, by a resolution,
expressed the wish that all contrUver
aies between the republic of America
and tbe nations of Kurope might
be settled by arbitration, and
recommended tbat the govern
ment of each nation represented in that
I conference ehould communicate thia
wieh t ah friendly powers. A favora
ble response haa been received from
Great Britain in the shape of a resolu
tion adopted by parlinment .fuly 15 last,
cordially sympathizing with the pur
poae in view and expreseing the hope
that her majeßty'a government will
lend hearty co-operation to tbe govern
ment of the United States, to legielation
on the current resolution above quoted.

sentiment of the two great, and kindred

by honorable resort to arbitration.
RAISED ENVOYS.
Since the passage of the act of March
3, 1893, authorizing the president to
raise the grade of our envoys to corre
spond witb the rank in whicb foreign
countries accredit their agente here,
Great Britain, France, Italy and Ger
many have conferred upon tbeir re
spective representatives at this capital
the title of ambassador, and I have re
sponded by accrediting the agenta of
the United Statea in those countriea
with the same title.
A like elevation of the mission ia an
nounced by Russia, and when made
will be similarly met. This step fit
tingly compares with the poeition the
United Statea holds in tbe family of
nations.
THE CONSULAR SERVICE.
During my former adminiatration I
took occasion to reccmmend a recaat of
tbe lawa relating to tbe conaular eervice
in order that it might become a
more efficient agency in the
promotion of the intereeta it waa
intended to aubaerve. The dutiea and
powers of consuls have been expanded
witb tbe growing requiremente of our
foreign trade, discharging important
dutiea affecting our commerce and
and American citizena abroad, and in
certain countriea exercises judicial func
tions These officers ehould be men of
character, intelligence and ability.

aiiver of the bullion or market value of
$50,750,000, and of tbe coinage value of

NATIONAL RANKS.
One hundred and nineteen national
banka were organized during tbe year
ending October 31, 1893, with a capital
of $11,230,000. Forty-six went into
voluntary liquidation and 158 suspend
ed. Sixty-five of the suspended banka
were insolvent, 86 resumed business
and eeven remained in the hands
of bank examiners with pros
pects of epeedy resumption. Of
the new banke organized, 44 were
located in the ecatern states, 41 west of
the Mississippi river and 34 in the
central and aoutbern states. The total
number of national banks in existence

having an aggregate capital of $695,

The recent repeal of the provision of
the law requiring the purchase of bul
lion by the government, aa a feature of
our monetary scheme, made an entire
change in the complexion of our cur
rency affaire. I do' not doubt that
the ultimate reeult of thia action
will be moat salutary and far-reaching.
In tbe nature of things, however, it ia
impossible to know at thia time pre
cisely what conditiona will be brought
about by the change, or what, if any,
anpplementary legislation may in the
light of such conditions appear to be es
sential or expedient. Of course,
after the recent financial per
turbation time ia neceeeary for
tbe re- establishment of buainess
confidence. Wben, however, through
this restored confidence the money
which has been frightened into hoard
ing placea ia returned to trade and enter
prise, a survey of theaituation will prob
ably disclose a safe path leading to a
permanently sound currency,abundantly
sufficient to meet every requirement of
our increaaing population and business.
In the pursuit of thia object we ehould
resolutely turn away from alluring and
temporary expedients, determined to be
content with nothing leaa tban a lasting
and comprehensive financial plan. In
these circumstances I am convinced that
a reasonable delay in dealing with tbis
subject instead of being injurious will
increaee tbe probability of wise action.
MONETARY CONFERENCE.
Tbe monetary conference wbicb aa
eembledat Brueaele npon our invitation
waa adjourned to tbe 30th day of No
vember in the preaent year. The con
aiderationa juat atated, and the fact
that a definite proposition from us
aeemed to be expected upon the reas-
I eembling of the conference, led me to
expreee a willingneaa to have the meet
ing Btill further poetponed. It aeema to
me that it would be wise to give general
authority to the preeident to invite
other nationa to auch a conference at
any time when there ehould be a fair
proapect of accomplishing an interna
tional agreement on the subject of
coinage.
GOVERNMENT BONDS.
I desire also to earnestly suggest the
wiadom of amending the existing stat
utes in regard to tbe issuance of govern
ment bonda. Tbe authority now vested
in tbe aecretary of the treasury to issue
bonds ia not aa clear aa it should be, and
tbe bonda authorized are dissdvan
tageoua to tbe government, botb aa to
the time of their maturity and rate of
interest.
> IMMIGRATION.
The superintendent of immigration,
through the aecretary of the treasury,
reports that during tbe last fiscal year
there arrived at our porta 440,793 irnmi
granta. Of these 1003 were not permit
ted to land under the limitation of tlie
law, and 577 were returned to the coun
triea from whence tbey came by reaeuv
of their having become public charge .
The total arrivala were 140,034 leas tban
for tbe previous year.
NATIONAL QUARANTINE.

hospital aervice and of tbe good work

THE WAR DEPARTMENT.

strength of the army on the 30th t
September laat was 25,778 enlistee
and 2144 officers. Tbe total expei

MILITARY ACADEMIES.
The reports of tbe Military academy at
Weat Point and tba several schools for
special instructions of officers showed
marked advance in education of tbe
army and commendable ambition among
its officers to excel in tbe military pro
fession, and to fit tbemaelves
