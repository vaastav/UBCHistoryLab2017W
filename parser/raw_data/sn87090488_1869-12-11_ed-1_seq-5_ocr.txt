day in Texas. The elections Lave
taken place, but the result ii not
knowu. It it hoped that act of
the Legislature! of these States,
when they meet, will be inch m to
receive your approval and tbui
clcie the work of reconstruction.
Among the evlli growiug out of
the rebellion, and not yet referred
to, ii that of an unredeemable
currency. It n an evil which
( hope will receive your
moit earnest attention. It is
a duty, and one of the highest du
ties of the Government to secure to
iu citizens a medium of exchange
of fixed and unvarying value, This
implies a return to a specie bssis,
and no substitute for it can be de
vised; it should be commenced
now, and reached at the earliest
practicable moment consistent with
a fair regard to the interests of the
debtor class. Immediate resump
tion, if practicable, would not be
desirable ; it would compel debtor
clams to pay.bcyoud their contract,
premium of gold at date of their
purchase, and would bring bank
ruptcy and ruin thousands fluctu
ations of the paper value, of
gold is detrimental to the
interests of trade. It makes the
men of business au involuntary
gambler, for iu all sales, where fu-
turo payment is to bo made, both
parties speculate as to what will
bo the value of currency, be
it paid or received. 1 earn
nestly recommend to' you, then,
such legislation as will insure
a gradual return to specie paymonts,
and put an immediate stop to fluc
tuation in the valuo of currency.
Tho method to secure forever these
results are as numerous as specula
tors on political economy. To se
cure the latter, I see but
one way, and that is to au
thorite the Treasury to redeem iu
oM paper at fixed prices when
ever presented, and to withhold
from circulation all currency so
redeemed until sold again for gold.
The vast resources of the nation,
both developed and undeveloped,
ought to make our credit the nest
on earth, with loss burden. With
the taxation that the citizen has en
dured, for six years past, the entire
public debt could be paid in ten

. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
FeUow-cilitent of Ike Senate and
Ilotut of lleprutnlativti :
Iu coming before you for the first
time as Chief Magistrate of this
' great nation, it is with gratitude to
the Giver of all good for the raauy
benefits that we enjoy, that we are
blessed with pence at home, with
out entangling alliances abroad to
forbode trouble, with territory un
surpassed in fertility and area,
equal to the abuudaut support of
live nundrea minions or people,
abounding in every variety of use
ful mineral in quuutity sufficient to
supply the world for generations
yet to come, an exhuberant crop,
a variety of climate adapted to the
production of every species of the
riches of this earth, suited to the
Tastes, and habits, aud requirements
of every living thing, a population
of 40,000,000 of free people, speak
ing one languago ; with facilities for
every mortal to acquire education
in institutions second to none in the
avennes of fame ; freedom of pulpit,
firess and school ; a revenue flow
ng into the National treasury be
yond the requiremouts of tho Gov
ernment. Happily harmony is being
restored within our borders ; manu
factures hitherto unkuown in our
country art springing up in all sec
tions, producing s degree of nation
al independence unequalled by auy
other power. These blessings and
countless others are entrusted to
vonr cars and mine for their safe
keeping for the brief period of our
tenure of office. In short lime
we muat cacti ot us return to the
ranks of a people who-have eon-ijea but it is not desirable that the
Cured these honors upon ns,Fpeople should be taxed to pay it in
'ana sacoans iv mhhu iur vur
stewardship. 1 earnestly desire
that neither you nor fmay be con-
L demned by s free and enlightened
constituency ; nor by our own con
sciences. Eleven States of the Ubion were,
four years ago, left without legal
tilate Governments. A NatiouaJ
debt had been oontraoted ; Ameri
can commerce was almost driven
from the seas. The industry of oue
' half the country bad been taken
from the control of capitalists aud
placed where all labvr rightfully
belonss in the keeuin. of the la
borers. Work of restoring btate
governments, disloyal to the Union,
of Drotectiuir aud lostering tree la
bor, aud providing means for pay
ing the interest on the public debt,
. has received ample- attention from
Congress. Although your efforts
have not met with that success iu
all particulars that might have beeu
desired, yet ou the whole they have
been more tucccsxiui man coum
have reasonably been anticipated
Of eleven btates which passed
ordinances of secession, seven have
been fully restored to their former
places iu the Union. The 8th,
Georgia, held an election, at which
she ratified a constitution Hcpubll-
cau in form, elected a Govirnor,
members of Congress, a btate Leg.
islamic, and other officers required
Tho Governor was itiMulleil, tho
Legislature met and passed nil tho
acts required of them by I lie recon
struction acts, and biiIim qiiuntly,
however, in violation of tho consti
tution which tbey had jtut ratified,
as since decided by the Supreme
Court of the Sttto of Georgia, they
unseated the colored members of
tho Legislature, and admitted to
scats some members who are dis
qualified by Uiu ild clause of the
14th Amendment, an article which
tbey themselves had contributed to
ratify. Under those circumstances
I would submit to you whether it
would not be wic, without tHay,
to enact a law authorizing the Gov
ernor of Georgia to conveno the
members originally elected to the
Legislature, requiring ench to take
tbeouth prescribed by I ho
i
Yourattention is respectfully in
vited to the recommendation of the
Secretary of tho Treasury for the
crtation of the office of Commis
sioner of Customs. The Rcvenuo
for the Increased salary of certain
classes of officials, and substitution
of the increased National bank cir
culation to replace outstanding
three per cent certificates and most
especially to his recommendation
for the repeal of laws allowiug s
share of flues, penalties, for'jitures,
Ac. to the officers of the Govern
ment or to Informers. The office of
Commissioner of Internal Revenue
Is one of the most ard uousand. res
ponsible under the Government;
It falls little short'of'a Cabinet po
sition In its importance and res
ponsibility. I would ask for It
therefore, sorb legislation as in
your judgment will place such
office upou a footingof dignity com
mensurate with its importance aud
with a charactor aud qualification
of a class of men required to fill it
properly.
As the United States Is the freest
of all nations, so too, do its people
sympathize with all peoplo strug
gling for free liberty and solf gov
erniuout; but whilo so sympathiz
ing, it is due to our honor that we
should abstain from enforcing our
views upon unwilling nations, and
from taking an interested part,
without Invitation, in quarrels be
tween different nations, or between
governments aud their subjccU.Otir
course should always be iu confor
mity with strict justice and law,
international and local. 'Such has
beeu the policy of the (Administra
tion in doallng with these questions
for more than a year. A valuable
province of Spain, and a near
neighbor of ours, in whom all our
neonle cannot out reel interested,
has beon struggling for Independ
ence and freedom. The people and
the government of the United
States enterlalu some warm feel
ing and sympathies for the people
of Spain in their pending struggle.
That they manifested throughout
the previous : struettle between
her and formercolouics, in behalf
of the latter, but the contest at no
time assumed conditions which
amounted to war in the sense of
international law, or which would
show the existence of dufacto po
iitical organizations. The insurrec
tion is sufficient to justify a recog
nition of belligerency. The princl
pie is maintained, however, that
this nation is its own Judge when to
accord the rights ot belligerency,
either to a people struggling to free
themselves from a government tncy
believe to be oppressive, or to In
deuendeiit unions at war with
each other, rue uuited states
havo no disposition to interfere
with Spain to deprive her of her
colouial possession on this conti
nent. They uoiieve mat iu due
time, Spaiu and other European
nowers will find their lutorest in
terininatlnz those relations aud es
tablishing their present dependen
cies as Independent powers. These
dependencies are no longer regard
ed as subject to transfer rrom one
European power to another. Wheu
the preseut relation of colunies
ceases, they are to become iude
pendent powers, exercising the
right of choice uud of self control
in determination of their future
condition aud rotations with other
powers. Tho Uuited States, in or
der to puts stop to bloodshed in
Cubu, ai.d In tho interest of tho
neighboring people, prepared, In
good offices, to bring tho existing
contest to a termination. Tho offer
not being accepted by Spain, the
basin which we believed could be
received by Culm was withdrawn.
It is hoped tho tfood offices of the
that time ; year by year the ability
to pay increases lu rapid ratio. But
the burden of interest ought to be
reduced ss rapidly as csn be with
out violation of the contract. The
public debt is represeuted In a great
pan oy oonus naving iron, nvi 10
twenty and from ten to forty years
to run. beariug interest at the rate
of 0 aud 6 per cent, respectively.
It isoptioual with the Government
to pay those bauds at any period af
ter the expiration of the least time
mentioned upon their face. Time
bas already expired, when a great
part may be taken up, and rapidly
approaching whonall may be; it is
believed that all of which are now
due may be replaced by bonds bear
ing a rate of interest uot exceeding
4; per cent, and as rapidly as the
remainder becomes due, that they
may be reduced iu eanio way. To
accomplish this it may be necessary
to authorize interest to bo paid at
either of three or four of the money
centres of Europe, or by any As
sistant Treasurer of the Uuited
States, at the option of .the holder
of bonds. I suggest this subject
for thu consideration of Cungress,
and also simultaneously with this,
the propriety of redeeming our
currency, as before suggested, at its
market value, at tho tiruo the
law goes into effect increasing tho
rate at which currency will be
bought and sold, from day to day,
m- week to week, aud at tho sainu
rate of interest as the Government United States may yet prove advan
res of the Uuited States to briug
about peace between Spain and
South American Republics having
been accepted by Spain, Peru
and Chill, Congress has
been invited to be held in
Washington during the present
wntcr. A grant has been given to
Europeans of an exclosive right of
transit over the territory of Nica
ragua to which Costa Rica bas giv
en its assent, which it is slledgod
conflicts with the vested rights of
the citizens of the United States.
The Department of State has now
this subject under consideration.

Spain, and that Spain was oou-

Spain to ml love the naval force at

of the war between the allies and

quired of them by this resolution,

that her Senators and Representa

rqd in tho propriety of using all
silrplus currency in the Treasury
in purchase of Government bonds
thus reducing the interest bearing

of the bonds so purchased. Bonds
now beld by the Treasury amouut
