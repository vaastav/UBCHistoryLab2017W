and many thousands of dollars were

land toward the monument fund.
j La Fayette's' career was, leaving aside
kll prejudices 'and political considera
tion, an interesting one. Let us sum
St up briefly: . Born at the Chateau do
jChavagnac, in Auvergne, September 6,
1757, the scion of one of the oldest
houses of the French noblesse, he was
left an orphan at a very early age.. He
was educated at the College de Plessis,
Paris, and at the age of 16 married, and
entered the French army. Soon after-
iward he became acquainted with Frank-
lin, Deane and Lee, tie Parisian agents
(of the American revolutionists, im-
ibibed their independent spirit and re
solved to draw his sword for the strug- '
Igling colonies. He accordingly fitted
(out a vessel at Bordeaux, and narrowly t
I escaped arrest, sailed from a Span
Ush port, ( accompanied by several
French officers, among them the fa
mous Baron de Ealb. I
On April 25, 1777, the marquis landed
at Charleston, S. C, and, proceeding to
' WHERE LAFAYETTE IS BURIED.
tPhiladelphiaf'where the congress was
fthen in session, made an offer to that
body to serve as a volunteer in the revo
Outionary Varmy. This offer was ac
cepted, and La Fayette, out of respect
to hla high rank, was commissioned a
mejor general, July 31, 1777. He soon
iron the favor and friendship of George
Washington, and rendered really dis
tinguished cervices to the cause of the
patriots at the battles of Erandywinc
maA Monmouth. At the end of 1778,
.-war having been declared between his
town country and Great Britain, the
gnarquis, who still retained his com
mission in the French army, obtained
leave of absence and sailed for home
Jn January, 1779. He was received
with unbounded enthusiasm by the
trench people, who at the time were
rfnll of revolutionary ideas and breamed.
wt tvaai xlrfiti and succeeded la obr
tainlng from tie government assist
ance, both in men and money, for the
American cause. Thereupon La, Fayette
recrossed the Atlantic and rejoined
Washington in May, 1780. Shortly
after his arrival the French auxiliary
force, under the command of Kochani
beau, arrived. After obliging the well
equipped army of Lord Cornwallis to
surrender at Yorktown, the marquis
again returned to France, and in 1784,
after the independence of the United
States had been recognized, again re
visited our country.
Returning to Paris, after a brief stay,
La Fayette assumed his public duties
as a member of the assembly of nota
bles, and at once became the champion
of radicalism. After bringing about
the convocation of the states-general,
in 1789, he was appointed commander
in chief of the national guard of Paris,
in which capacity he succeeded In sav
ing the lives of Louis XVI. and Marie
Antoinette from the rabble which had
taken possession of the palace of Ver
sailles, on October 5 and 6. When,
soon afterward, the national assembly
passed a decree for the abolition of
nereditary titles, La Fayette was the
first to relinquish his rank of marquis.
In March, 1792, war being declared
against Austria, lie was made com- !
mander of the frontier army corps, and
won the battles of Philippeville, Mau
berge and Florennes. On August 8 he J
was openly denounced by the Jacobins ;
as a traitor to his country; and, after i
escaping arrest at the bands of their
emissaries, fled 'into" Germany, where j
he was- captured by the Austrian s and
imprisoned in the fortress of Olmnetz.
In 1824 tne congress ol tne United
States passed a resolution requesting
President Monroe to extend an invita
tion to La Fayette to visit this country
once more. He complied, and landed
at New York on the 15th of August.
His tour partook of the character of a
triumphal progress, and congresaj in
December, voted him a grant of $200,
000 and a township, in recognition of
his services during the revolution. In
September, 1825, he returned to France.
The unconstitutional ordinances of
Charles X., in June, 1830, which caused
his own expulsion, brought La Fayette
before the people once more; and it
'was to him, intrusted with the power
of dictator, in his character as com
mander of the national guard, that
Louis Philippe owed his elevation to
the throne. La Fayette died in 1834,
and received the greatest public fu
reral of which modern French annals
! possess any record. '. nis remains still
rest in the burial grounds of the con
vent of- Petit Picpus, together with
those of nearly 1,500 victims of the
guillotine and the revolution. His
grave is generally unknown and for
gotten, and is marked only by a plain
granite slab.
Whatever may have been La Fayette s
shortcomings, toward the lawfully es-
tf.blished authorities of the continental
army he never failed to show scrupu
lous loyalty. When sorely tempted, by
Washington's dissatisfied generals to
lead an army into Canada, and to stir
up a revolution among the French set
tlers in that country, in opposition to
the chief commander's wishes, he put
the temptation from him, and re
mained true to the man to whom he
owed his elevation to rank and power in
the American service. And as La Fay
ette remained true to Washington, so
the great commander remained faithful
to the young Frenchman.
Carlyle, that harshest of English
writing judges, places a low estimate on
La Fayette's character. He calls him
fickle and a demagogue. Perhaps he
was both, to a certain extent. Political
greatness, in all ages, has depended
upon a man's ability to adapt himself
to circumstances. La Fayette preached
radicalism when the mob was about
ready to wreak vengeance on its oppres
sors; and that his arguments hastened
the beginning of the French revolution
and the inauguration of the reign of
terror cannot be logically disputed.
But the motives which actuated him
were pure. He sympathized with the
starving, oppressed multitudes and was
honestly anxious to ameliorate their
condition. The excesses which fol
lowed whenr the Jacobins secured con
trol of the government were as dis
heartening to La Fayette as to every
other lover of humanity. He learned
the great lesson that freedom is not the
growth of a day, but of generations, too
late. He had become so familiar with
Anglo-Saxon conservatism while serv
ing in the American army that when
the time came he failed to make allow
ance for Gallic instability and intrigue.
While helping to give freedom to Amer
icans, he let loose in his own land the
demons of license.-

the Main Features The President's
Message.
Washington, Dec 5. The curtain
was rung up to-day upon the closing
session of the Fifty-fifth congress. The
war and the fruits of the American vic
tory carry in their wake many problems
which the national legislature must
solve. But, though many' questions may
press for solution, the brief space cov
ered by this session, which expires by
limitation March 4, precludes the possi
bility of .much betng accomplished be
tKnd the passage of the regular money
budgets, the legislation for the increase
of the regular army which the admin
istration deems necessary to meet the
obligations Imposed upon the country
by the result of th war and probably
the enactment of a law to give a per
manent territorial government to the
Hawaiian Islands. This covers all the
important legislation which the con
gressional leaders expect to see enacted
at this session. It is almost the unan
imous sentiment of the leaders that no
attempt should be made to legislate
concerning the possessions acquired by
the war with Spain at this session.
There are earnest advocates of the Nic
araguan canal bill who will strive to
secure its passage now, and they may
possibly be successful, but neither it
nor any one of the measures like the
pooling bill, antiscalpers' . bill, etc.,
which have strong friends, will be al
lowed to Interfere with- the bills the
passage of which is deemed absolutely
necessary to prevent an extra session.
The leaders at both ends of the capltol
have put their heads together, and the
work of the session is to be entered
upon with the idea of avoiding an extra
session. With this purpose In view, the
appropriation bills are to be given the
road and pressed through with all pos
sible haste. .
Two subcommittees of the appropria
tion committee of the house have been
at work for a week. The deficiency bill
to meet the extraordinary expenses of
the army and navy during the six
months from Jan.- 1, 1898, to July 1 is
ready to submit to the full committee,
and the regular District of Columbia
appropriation bill will be ready by the
end of the week. It is necessary that
the former should become a law before
the holiday recess, which this year is to
be shorter than usual, and Chairman
Cannon hopes to see 1t through the
house and Into the senate before the
end of the present week. The Demo
crats of the house have not disclosed
their position, but it is not believed
they will seek to obstruct an appro
priation bill necessary for the mainte
nance of the army now ,in the field.
Should there be a disposition to open up
and prolong a debate upon the conduct
of the war upon this bill it is safe to as
sume that the committee on rules will
be Invoked to bring in an order to close
debate.
The senators express a determination
to take up the work of the session vig
orously In the beginning with the hope
of having it well , advanced before the
holidays, and they are counting upon
taking up the appropriation bills at a
Very early date for the purpose of pre
venting an extra session due to any
failure on the part of the national
budget.
It is expected that the army deficien
cy bill will reach the senate during the
present week, the understanding at the
north end of the capitol being that the
house will dispose of it within a very
few days after assembling. The com
mittee on appropriations will bring It
in early for the double purpose of hav
ing it passed quickly and of testing the
feeling of senators on questions con
nected with the war.
It is impossible to say what matters
will occupy the week after the disposal
of the president's message, but it is
probable that some speeches may be de
livered upon the policy indicated by
the message and also that the calendar
may be taken up. There are many
measures which have been reported and
there will be no difficulty to find em
ployment if the senate is disposed to
settle to routine so early in the ses
sion. During the closing days of the last
session Senator Morgan gave notice of
hl3 intention to call up the Nicaragua
canal bill at the beginning of the pres
ent session. He unquestionably will re
deem this promise and would doubtless
seek the first opportunity but for the
possibility of change of sentiment In
favor of having the government under
take the entire responsibility of build
ing the canal. All the indications are
that this question will be one of the
most prominent subjects under consid
eration during the session.
Opposition is developing to the bill
which the Hawaiian commission will
bring in and for which early considera
tion will be asked. There is a consider
able contingent in the senate opposed
to constituting the islands into a terri
tory because of the apprehension that
they may be converted into a state, and
deliberate consideration of the subject
will be asked.
While it is quite too early to reach a
definite conclusion there are decided in
dications of a disposition on the part
of the senate to confine -the session's
work to routine measures and the ap
propriation bills, and it need surprise
no one if the close of the session would
demonstrate that this general polio
had been pursued.
Washington, December 5. At 1:25 p.
m. the committee appointed to wait
upon the president reported the 'per
formance cf Its duty and announced
that the president would immediately
communicate with the senate in 'writ
ing. Scarcely had the report been
'mad when Major Truden, executive
clerk cf the president, entered 'the
chamber and presented th'e message.
Vice President Hobart laid it before
the senate at once and the reading was
begun at 1:28 p. m.
At the house, after the assembling
and the chaplain's prayer, the roll was
called, . Which . developed the presentee
of 267 members, sufficient for a quor
um. Alter the usual resolutions were
adopted, a recess iwas taken until 1:30
to await the arrival of the president's
message.
President (MeKinleys second annual
message, submitted to congress to
day, contains about twenty thousand
words. Following is a brief synapsis,
including some direct; excerpts of the
more important features of the mes
sage. To the Senate and House o Repre
sentatives:
"Notwithstanding the added' bur
dens rendered necessary by the war,
cur people rejoice in a very satisfac
tory and steadily increasing degree of
prosperity evidenced Iby the largest
volume of business ever recorded.
Manufacture has Ibeen productive, agri
cultural pursuits have yielded abund
ant returns, labor in all fields of in-
dus'try is better rewarded, revenue
legislation passed by the "present con
gress 'has increased the treasury re
ceipts to the amount estimated by its
authors; the finances of the govern
ment have been successfully adminis
'tered and its credit advanced to the
first rank; rwhile its currency ihas "been
maintained at the world's 'highest
standard. Military servicie under a
common flag and for a Tighteous cause
has strengthened tlhe national spirit
and served to cement more closely
than ever the fraternal Tbonds between
every section of the country."
In reviewing the controversy which
led up to the war with pain the pres
ident takes up the thread of narrative
where terminated in his last -message.
He concluded: "It was 'honest
ly due to our friendly relations with
Spain that she slhouM foe given a Tea
sonaible chance to realize her expec
tations of reform to which she had be
come irrevocably associated."
"It became evident, hoiwever, that
the proposed plans were 'barren of
good results. No tangible relief iwas
afforded the reeoncentrados, among
whom the rate Of mortality frightfully
incerased; the proffered expedient of
cultivation proved illusory and it was
apparent that nothing save the physi
cal exhaustion of Sipain or the Cubans
and the practical ruin of the island' of
Cuba could result from the struggle
then in progress. At this critical
juncture,' the desecration of the battle
ship Maine occurred. Concerning it
the president says: "It is a striking
evidence of the poise and sturdy good
sense distinguishing our national
dharacter that this Shocking blow fall
ing on a generous people, already-deeply
touched by preceding events, in Cu
ba, did not move then to am instant.
desperate Tesolve to tolerate no longer
cne existence of a dondition of danger
and disorder .at our doors that made
possible such a deed, by whomsoever
wrought." - .
Resuming the war narrative, the
president directs attention to - the
measures increasing the $20,000,000
appropriation for national defense, ta
ken to place the country on a war foot
ing and adds: "It is sufficient to say
that the outbreak of tlhe war, when it
did co'me, found our nation -not un
prepared to enter the conflict."
Negotiations with the Madrid 'gov
crnimen proved futile, so far as prac
tical results were concerned and then
it was the president presented the
uestlon to congress, saying "In the
name cf humanity; in the name of
civilization; in behalf of endangered
American interests which give us the
r'aiht to speak and to act, the war in
Cuba must stop."
The result of this statement of the
case was the adoption of the taeimo
ralble joint resotution by congress, de
claring the purpose of the United
States to intervene between the Span
iards and the Cubans. 'Following
swiftly upon this calme the severance
cif diplomatic relations Ibetiween the
two countries, the proclamation tit a
blockade of Cuban ports, the call for
volunteers and the formal declaration
cf the existence of a state of war. It
is not among the feast gratifying in
cidents of the struggle that the obli
gations of neutrality were Impartiaflly
discharged by all often under difficult
cireum trances.
The president reviews at length the
wark of preparation for war, referring
particularly to the erpl'lstment cf the
volunteers, to the material increase of
Mie navy in both men and ships and
to the precautionary measures taken
"cr 'I'ie prelection cf the seaboard
oc-ast -and cities. The aggregate num
ber of mines pla-oed ttss 1.535, at the
Principal harbors from Maine to Cali
'ornia. Referring to the "difficult and im-wefl-tant
character" of the work per
"ormed by the si'gnaH corps, the presi
dsnt says: "This service was inval
u'a.ble to the executive in directing the
erations of the army and navy.
With a tc'tal force of over 1,300 the
less was by disease, inc amp and field,
officers and men incfluded, only five.
As to the authorized loan of $200,
000,000 which was taken entirely by
small holders, the president says:
"This was a most encouraiging and
significant result, showing the vast
resources of the nation and the de
termination of the people to uphold
their country's honor."
Taking up chronoiogically : the
events of the war. the president re
views them carefully. The first en
counter was th-9 shelling of Matanzas
on April 27. This was folowed by an
engagement which was "destined to
mark a memorable epoch in maritime
warfare." This was Commodore
Dewey's wonderful victory at Manila
on May 1. "The effect cf this re
nrark'aible victory," says the president
"upon the spirit of our people and up
on the fortunes of the war, was in
stant. The prestige of invincibility
thereby attached to our arms con
tinued throughout the struggle." The
president Says that "only reluctance
to cause needless 'loss of life and prop
erty prevented the early storming and
capture of the city (M'anila) , and
therewith the aibsolut9 military occu
pancy of the whole group."
Following the memorable trin of the
baftlesbiT) Oregon from San Francisco
to Key West and the bombardment of
San Juan and the "forts of Santiago,
to which special reference is made, the
president says: "The next act in the
war thrilled not atone the hearts of
our countrymen, but the world, by its
exceptional 'heroism On the night of
June 3 Lieutenant Hobson, aided by
seven devoted volunteers, blocked the
narrow outlet from Santiago harbor
by sinking the collier Merriimao in the
Channel, under a fierce fire from the
shore batteries, escaping with their
lives as by a miracle but falling into
the hands of the Spanlrads, It is a
most gratifying incident of the war
that the bravery of this little band of
heroes was cordiailly appreciated by
the Spanish admiral.
The campaign of Santiago, resulting
in the investment and capture of that
city, is referred to as a brilliant
achievemen't. A brief review is then
presented of the decisive naval com
bat of the war on July 3rd, resulting
in the complete destruction of Admiral
Oerveras fleet. Concerning it the
president says: "Where all so conspic
uously distinguished themselves, from
the commanders to the gunners and
the seamen heroes in the boiler rooms,
each, and all contributing toward the
achievement of this astounding vic
tory, for which neither ancient or
modern history affords a parallel in
the completeness of the event and the
marvelous disproportion of casuali
ties, it would be invidious to single
out any for a special 'honor." In this
connection the president says "nor can
we be unmindful of achievements of
our builders, mechanics and artisans
for their skill in the construction of
our warships."
As to the success gained by the arms
of the United States the presiednt says
that the earnest and lasting gratitude
of the nation is unsparingly due. "Nor
Should we alone remember the gal
lantry of the living, the dead claim
our tears, and our losses by the bat
tle and disease must cloud any exul
tation at the result and teach us the
cost of war, however rightful the
cause or signal 'the victory.
"The total casualties in killed and
wounded in the army during the war
with Spain were: Officers killed, 25;
enlisted men killed, 2S7; total, 280.
Officers wounded, 113; enlisted men,
1,464; total, 1,577. Of the navy:
Killed, 17; wounded, 67; died as re

FRENCH REPUBLIC TREMBLING
There is a Growing Fear of a Coup
. ,. , . D'Ktat :
LONDON, Dec. 5. A situation full of
turmoil is often seen in truer perspec
tive from a little distance than in the
midst, of its confusion. A correspondent
returning to London after a stay of sev
eral weeks in Paris says that such is
thafcase with the pending French crisis.
Events and " their meaning aavume a
Clearer relationship than when viewed
frOm the Avenue de l'Opera. It cannot
be said, however,! that the situation is
any less- serious when examined from
the better vantage ground. - -
If one were foolish ' enough to enter
the dangerous field of prophecy, he
would be almost inclined to indorse the
startling declaration in The Spectator,
which says boldly: "It is our sincere be
lief, that a great event is immediately
at hand in France."
The reason for this ominous opinion
is the fact that the French military au
thorities have openly challenged the
civil and judicial powers, and the only
logical outcome of this policy is a mili
tary coup d'etat, of which Premier Du
puy, in scarcely veiled language, de
clares he stands in fear.
It is impossible to avoid some suspi
cion of M. Dupuys good faith as well
as his courage, for it must be borne in
mind that he was premier when the
Dreyfus infamy took place in 1894. It
would be more charitable toi ascribe the
government's attempt to shift the duty
of postponing the Picquart court mar
tial upon the court of cassation to cow
ardice. There can be no doubt, however, that
both Premier Dupuy and M. de Frey
cinet, the minister of war, have not
dared to postpone the Picquart trial, be
cause they had reason to know that
such an order would be resisted by Gen
eral Zurlinden, and a crisis, which the
present cabinet is afraid to face, would
thus be precipitated.

New Tork, Dec 5. All through the
night two thousand or more persons re
mained in Madison square waraen watcn
ing the six days' bicycle race, which was
begun at midnight. Cistac, the Aus
tralian, got an ugly cut under his left
eye through falling with several others,
before 2 o'clock. Leslie also fell and
hurt his wrist.
Just before 4 o'clock Cistac took an
other header, and Forster, the German,
who was close behind, ran into him and
fell over him. Forster jumped up and
shook his fist at Cistac. Forster, how
ever, was unhurt, and he remounted. In
five minutes the plucky Cistac was also
back again, riding at a fast pace.
: Rice, who was in poor condition, re
tired from the race at 4:56 o'clock with
89 miles and 7 laps to his credit. ' Burke
was off the track a great deal and Leslie
and Beacom were away in the rear.
Between 5 and 6 o'clock there was the
liveliest kind of a race between Miller
and- Schineer. Miller's hard riding
brought him into the lead at 6 o'clock
with 122 miles even. The other leaders
were close - behind. Cistac - met with
more trouble shortly after 6 o'clock.His
tire burst and he had to quit riding for

WALLEDA SIGHTS A WRECK.
Storm
Made It Impossible to
Save
the Schooner's Crew.
NEW TORK, Dec. 5. The Nova Sco
tlan schooner Walleda, Captain Kemp,
arrived yesterday from Gonaives and
reports terrible experiences encountered
during the recent hurricane.
"We have had a hard time," said Cap
tain Kemp, "and I do not recollect that
I have ever seen such weather on the
north Atlantic since I first went to sea.
During the height of the hurricane, on
Nov. 28, in latitude 36.22, longitude 72.30,
we sighted a dismantled schooner of
about 760 tons flying signals of distress.
It was nearly dark at the time, and her
crew could be seen on the decks gestic
ulating frantically for assistance. We
bore down to her and got close under
her lee and hailed her. They shouted
that the vessel was sinking and asked
to be taken oft. I told them that my
boats were stove and useless. They
said they would come to us in their
own boats. During1 this time we laid
to, but found ' that we were drifting
rapidly to the leeward, then went about
on the other tack and after several
tacks managed to cross the bow of the
wreck and again drifted to a leeward
position. We hailed again, but got no
answer. In the meantime another three
toasted schooner came to our assistance
and assumed a position to the wind
ward of the wreck. Both of us stood
by until daylight we to the leeward,
the other schooner to the windward.
When morning broke the wreck was
seen to be deserted and the boat3 gone.
It Is supposed that the unfortunate men
had attempted to launch their boat
during the night, which capsized, and
all hands were lost. It was impossible
for them to get to the other schooner
to windward owing to the terrible seas
and squally wind. The wreck was very
low in the water, and we were unable
to distinguish her name. Finding that
we could do nothing further we put our
vessel on her course. The gale contin
ued throughout the 2Sth and moderated

A Gang; of Them Caught Gam
bling; Last Night.
All Marched to the Station House in
the Pouring Rain Several Minor .
Oases in the Police Court This Mora- ,
1 ing.
The police made one of the largest
raids ever heard of in this city last -night,
and as a result nineteen swarthy
Chinamen were landed behind the
bars. For some time the Chinese store
at 7 Brown street has been under sus
picion by the police. The store was
run under the guise of a tea store, al-'
though there was probably not threw
dollar's worth of that stock in tlhe
place last night when " the oflicers
swooped down upon it. . .
About 8 o'clock : last night Chief
Egan and Detective Oahey found the
desired opportunity, and, with the aid
of several officers swooped down upon .
the place. It was a totaH surprise and
the yellow eons of China were thun
derstruck. The police officers trail-.
died the fellows, off to the station
house, taking ten on the first trip and
nine on the second. It was a strange
sight to see the single file of China
men tramping through the rain, like a
flock of ducks. The police thought ttie
sight a pretty good argument In favor
of a patrol wagon. In the station
house, the men huddled together in
bunches and' chattered incessantly.
Then they 'began calling for attorney
and cigarettes. . They got the . tatter
first, and before midnight, through
the aid of messenger "boys, had pro
cured and smoked fifteen packs at
cigarettes and the odor of smoke In
the cells would choke an ordinary
mortal. The police made a thorough
search of the premises after landinjf
all of the gamblers and Bmnikers and
found a complete gambling and opium
layout. They brought all of the testi
mony thus-found ito the police station.
One of the prisoners was just about to
sink in the arms of Morpheus f rom the
effects of smoking the opium when tb
police entered. He -had to be almost
carried to the station' . house and -tin
mediately fell asleep when he .-was
landed taiere. ' . . .J . v:
This7- morning the city court ms
crowded to suffocation by a crowd that
seemed over-anxious to see what dtar
position would be made of the China
men. The latter presented a fanny
pearanee as they, sat in the pen, p'
pearing to be. scared almost to death.
They seemed easier when , Attorney
Russell appeared, and all tried to
speak to him at once. , The attorney
remained undisturbed under t!he bom
bardment and gradually settled them
all with a few words which they seem
ed to understand. He asked to have
the case ' continued: until to-morrow,
but the court refused on the sbrentfsX
of the objections : of Prosecuting At
torney Durant.
' In the city court this morning, An
thony Pecunks, a Lithuanian, wm
charged with assaulting a fellow
countryman on Thanksgiving day byv
throwing him down a flight of etalm
and jumping on him. He was fined $&
and costs and a fellow countryman
who assisted (him in the assault "was
also fined $5 and costs. : .
Frank Warner, charged with. dnmk
enness, was sent to jail for thirty days.
James Devoy was charged with
drunkenness and resistance. He was
fined $7 without oasts for resistance
and sentence was suspended for drunk
enness. - ". : -r - - i
The case agaSnst Thomas F.. Foley,
for 'alleged liquor violation, was- eon
tinued again un'Hl Friday. Judge
Bradstreet reserved his decision In the
caise against P. J. Ooogan, for alleged
Violation of the liquor laws, untH to
morrow morning.
Celius (Moore, a milkman, , waa.
charged with the theft of a lantern
which was taken from in front of a
sewer excavation on Mattatuck street. '
Moore said that the morning before -he
left a lantern near the excavation
fr guard against accidents, as the
place was poorly protected, and his -horses
(had floundered into the oowora
on that account. He claimed, there
fore, that in taking the lantern he was
only taking -his own property. ; He
was discharged. ,
It was almost three o'clock this after
noon before the cases against the China
men were gotten into proper shape for
trials. All but one ot them were charg
ed with frequenting a place reputed to be
a gambling house. That one, Charley
Wong, was charged with being proprietor
of an alleged gambling house. All of
the cases against the Chinamen were '
tried together. An interpreter named
Wong Git, who had been telegraphed for
last night, arrived here at 1:28, and at S
o'clock he was sworn- in and the case
formally lejan. . . . -
