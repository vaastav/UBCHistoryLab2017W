WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. President
Wilson laid before congress today tho
legislative ambition of the Democratic
administration.
Por osaotly twenty-eight minutes tho
president stood before tho assomblod
senate and house in the chnmbor of the
latter and read his first annual mos
sago. Applause punctuatod important
utterances, and when lio had finishod
there was an enthusiastic demonstra
tion, with handclapping and chcors.
Briofly tho president outlined a pro
gramme for social justico and tho gen
eral wolfaro of tho nation and pro
claimed the aspirations of tho United
States for international amity and tho
maintenance of constitutional govern
ment in all America.
Close Attention Given.
With close, almost oagor attention,
members of tho two houses listened, and
timo and again tho legislators thom
selvos gavo vent to their onthusiasni
along with tho crowded gallorios.
Less than 3000 words long, tho inos
sago was ono of tho briefest and most
novel of American Btnto papers a
marked contrast as prosontod by its
author today to tho hitherto lengthy
documents nvorngiiig 20,000 words or
moro droned through by a reading
clerk to an inattdntivo congress.
Thoro wns another contrast conspic
uously apparout. President Wilson had
road three messages boforo on tho
tariff, tho currency and Mexican af
fairs. Tho first timo ho addressed a
joint session in person, early in his
term, thero was an atmosphere of stiff
formality, applauso was liberal, but por
functory and there was an indefinable
air of proccdont being broken or n
century-old custom being rovivod. Also
thoro was an oxpoctant curiosity as to
how tho presidont would bo roceived.
Today, the president's reception was
warm, almost uproarious, as ho con
cluded his reading.
Much Praise Given.
Later Hopublicaus and Democrats
aliko pronounced tho message ns tho
uttornnco of a statesman.
"I liko the idea of tho prosidont
coming boforo congress," said Repre
sentative M"nun. Republican houso lead
er, "aud reading a short message, pithy
and to tho point. In tho main I liked
tho monsago today. I think everybody
will recognize it as the utteranco of a
statesman, regnrdloss of whether he
grces with its details."
Of particular significance was ono
demonstration of applnuBo regarded in
tho Tiationnl capital tonight tho un
miatakcablc approval that, groat od the
president's remark:
"There can bo no certain prospect of
peace in America until General Huortn

A twenty-four-inch watermaln burst
about ton feot below the pavement, but
whether that was tho causo of the accl

BINGHAM, Dec. 3. Tho Apex mine,
which for tho past thirty-six hours ba-
boon the tomb of Raphael Lopez, w .
be opened tomorrow morning and the
search will bo mndo for the outlaw's
body. On account of the fact that the
niino is completely shut down and LJj
miners aro idle, tho opening will not
be delayed longer. Furthermore, it is
not believed that Lopez, if he is still
alive, can withstand tho deadly blacl
damp that is now being sent up the
hoist from tho 700-foot lovel.
Tho latest report from tho banda
was that which camo last night from
the Phoenix tunnol No. 2, the 075-foot
level. Guards stationed thero reported
that thoy had heard Lopez working his
way out at tho innor bulkhead. Thoro
aro two bulkheads in this tunnel, tho
innermost ono being about 250 feet
from the portal and tho outer ono about
fifty feet in. According to the guards,
Lopez was hoard moving timbers at tho
inner bulkhead. J
Draft Noticed. H
It was noticed that thoro was an in
wnrd draft at this point. The draft
upward has been so great that it drew JM
air in through this entrance. If LopoK
got thoro he would bo in fresh air.
Dr. Straup oxproesod tho belief, how
over, that tho guards had hoard tho
timbers warping, duo to tho water in
the tunnel.
Shortly before tho smoko started Lo- JM
pcz was hoard at the Andy bulkhead.
Lnter he was heard in the 700 levol
far below. Last night ho was heard
at tho Phoonir No. 2. If he made all
thoso travels, part of the distance
would inevitably have been through
tho Bulphur fumos. For this reason it
is believed that other noises haro been
hoard by ut least some of tho guards.
Tho only other theory is that another H
man is in tho mine. It is not believed
now that Cranovich is in tho mine. jH
Cranovich Out. JM
Persistent rumor had it horo tonight
that Mike Cranovich, tho Austrian
who is a fugitive on a charge of wifo
beating, hnd been in tho "Utah-Apex jH
mine, but had escaped prior to placing
tho bulkheads in tho tunnels of the
mine. Tt was roportod frequently dur
ing the day that friends of Cranovich
had smuggled him out of the mino ou IH
Saturday or Sunday and had hira hid- IH
den in a cabin. The 'mino operators jH
say that such an oscape might .have
been made prior to the bulkheading JH
but that thero was uo possible way oY JH
escapo suhsoquent to the bulkheading.
On tho othor hand, there are a num- jH
bor of friends of Cranovich who say
that the fugitive has novor been in the
mino and that he is now working in a
coal camp in Carbon county. Mrs,
Cranovich. Shoriff Smith said laBt JM
night, is recovering from her injuries
