MESSAGE OF
THE PRESIDENT
Mr. Taft Champions the Antl
i trust Statute.
MEW REMEDIES SU66ESTED.
Not Repeal or Amendment, but Sup
plemental Legislation Needed—The
Tobacco Truct Decision an Effective
One—Federal Incorporation Recom
mended and a Federal Corporation
Commission Proposed—The Test of
"Reasonableness."
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
This message is the first of several
which 1 shall send to congress during
the interval between the opening of
*ts regular session and its adjourn
ment for the Christmas holidays. The
amount of information to be commu
nicated as to the operations of the
government, the number of important
subjects calling for comment by the
executive and the transmission to con
gress of exhaustive reports of special
commissions make it impossible to in
clude in one message of a reasonable
length a discussion of the topics that
ought to be brought to the attention
of the national legislature at its first
regular session.
The Anti-trust Law—The Supreme
Court Decisions.
In May last the supreme court hand
ed down decisions In the suits In equi
ty brought by the United States to en
join the further maintenance of the
Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri
can Tobacco trust and to secure their
dissolution. The decisions are epoch
making and serve to advise the busi
ness world authoritatively of the
scope and operation of the anti-trust
act of 1890. The decisions do not de
part In any substantial way from the
previous decisions of the court in con
struing and applying this important
statute, but tbey clarify those deci
sions by further defining the already
admitted exceptions to the literal con
struction of the act. By the decrees
tbey furnish a useful precedent as to
the proper method of dealing with the
capital and property of illegal trusts.
These decisions suggest the need and
wisdom of additional or supplemental
legislation to make it easier for the
entire business community to square
with the rule of action and legality
thus finally established and to pre
serve the benefit, freedom and spur of
reasonable competition without loss of
real efficiency or progress.
No Change In the Rule of Decision,
Merely In Its Form of Expression.
The statute in its first section de
clares to be illegal "every contract,
combination in the form of trust or
otherwise or conspiracy in restraint
of trade or commerce among the sev
eral states or with foreign nations"
and In the second declares guilty of a
misdemeanor "every person who shall
monopolize or attempt to monopolize
or combine or conspire with any other
person to monopolize any part of the
trade or commerce of the several states
or with foreign nations."
In two early cases, where the statute
was Invoked to enjoin a transporta
tion rate agreement between inter
state railroad companies, It was held
that it was no defense to show that
the agreement as to rates complained
of was reasonable at common law, be
cause It was said that the statute was
directed against all contracts and com
binations In restraint of trade, whether
reasonable at common law or not It
was plain from the record, however,
that the contracts complained of In
those cases would not have been deem
ed reasonable at common law. In sub
sequent cases the court said that the
•tatnte should be given a reasonable
construction and refused to Include
within its inhibition certain contrac
tual restraints of trade which it de
nominated as Incidental or as indirect
These cases of restrant of trade that
the court excepted from the operation
of the statute were Instances which
«t common law would have been call
ed reasonable. In the Standard Oil
and tobacco cases, therefore, the court
merely adopted the tests of the com
mon law and In defining exceptions to
the literal application of the statute
only substituted for the test of being
Incidental or Indirect that of being
reasonable, and this without varying
lit the slightest the actual scope and
effect of the statute. In other words,
oil the cases under the statute which
have now been decided would have
been decided the name way If the
eourt had originally accepted in its
•construction the rule at common law.
It has been said that the court by in
troducing into the construction of the
statute common law distinctions has
eniasculated it This 1b obviously un
true. By its Judgment every contract
and combination In restraint of inter
state trade made with the purpose or
necessary effect of controlling prices
pj. stifling competition or of. establish
ingjia whole jor in .part n monopoly of
jnejl' trade Is condemned by^/he Vtnt

'Instance'a case that 6ught to be* con
demned under tbeitatotewbich ls not

The suggestion Js also made ttiat the
supreme court by Its decision In the
ft* two ea— haw coromlftud the
1
1
cretlon to determine whether a case of
restraint of trade is within the terms
of the statute. This is wholly untrue.
reasonable restraint of trade at com
mon law is well understood and is
clearly defined, (t does not rest in the
discretion of the court. It must be
limited to accomplish the purpose of a
lawful main contract to which In order
i that It shall be enforceable at all it
must be Incidental. If it exceed the
needs of that contract it is void.
The test of reasonableness was never
applied by the court at comman law
to Contracts or combinations or con
spiracies in restraint of trade whose
purpose was or whose necessary effect
would be to stifle competition, to con
trol prices or establish monopolies.
The courts never assumed power to
say that such contracts or combina
tions or conspiracies might be lawful
If the parties to them were only mod
erate in the use of the power thus se
cured and did not exact from the pub
lic too great and exorbitant prices. It
Is true that many theorists and others
engaged In business violating the stat
ute have hoped that some such line
could be drawn by courts, but no court
of authority has ever attempted it.
sions of the latest two cases from
which such a dangerous theory of Ju
dicial discretion in enforcing this stat
ute can derive the slightest sanction.
Force and Effectiveness of Statute a
Matter of Growth.
We have been twenty-one years mak
ing this statute effective for the pur
poses for which it was enacted. The
Knight case was discouraging and
Beemed to remit to the states the whole
available power to attack and suppress
the evils of the trusts. Slowly, howev
er, the error of that judgment was cor
rected, and only in the last three .or
four years has the heavy hand of the
law been laid upon the great illegal
combinations that bave exercised such
an absolute dominion over many of our
Industries. Criminal prosecutions have
been brought, and a number are pend
ing. but juries bave felt averse to con
victing for jail sentences and judges
have been most reluctant to impose
such sentences on men of respectable
standing in society whose offense has
been regarded as merely statutory.
Still, as the offense becomes better un
derstood and the committing of it par
takes more of studied and deliberate
i defiance of the law we can be confi
dent that juries will convict individu
als and that Jail sentences will be im
posed.
The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution.
In the Standard Oil case the supreme
and circuit courts found the combina
tion to be a monopoly of the interstate
business of refining, transporting and
I marketing petroleum and its products,
effected and maintained through thir
ty-seven different corporations, the
stock of which was held by a New Jer
sey company. It in effect commanded
the dissolution of this combination, di
rected the transfer and pro rata distri
bution by the New Jersey company of
the stock held by it in the thirty-seven
corporations to and among its stock
holders. and the corporations and indi
vidual defendants were enjoined from
conspiring or combining to restore
such monopoly, and all agreements be
tween the subsidiary corporations tend
ing to produce or bring about further
i violations of the act were enjoined,
In the tobacco case the court found
that the individual defendants, twen
ty-nine in number, had been engaged
I in a successful effort to acquire com
plete dominion over the manufacture,
i sale and distribution of tobacco in this
country and abroad and that this had
been done by combinations made with
a purpose and effect to stifle competi
tion, coutrol prices and establish a
i monopoly, not only in the manufacture
of tobacco, but also of tin foil and 11c
orice used in Its manufacture and of
its products of cigars, cigarettes and
snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a
far more complicated and difficult case
than the Standard Oil suit for a decree
I which would effectuate the will of the
court and end the violation of the stat
ute. There was here no single hold
ing company, as in the case of the
Standard Oil trust The main company
was the American Tobacco company,
a manufacturing, selling and holding
company. The plan adopted to de
stroy the combination and restore com
petition Involved the redivlsion of the
capital and plants of the whole trust
between some of, the companies con
stituting the trust and new companies
organized for the purposes of the de
cree and made parties to it and num
bering, new and old. fourteen.
Situation After Readjustment.
The American Tobacco company
(old), readjusted capital $94000.000:
the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company
(new), capital $67,000,000: the P. Lorii
lard company (new), capital $47,000,
000, and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
company (old), capital $7,525,000. are
chiefly engaged in the manufacture
and sale of chewing and smoking to
bacco and cigars. The former one tin
I foil company is divided Into two. one
of $825,000 capital and the other of
$400,000. The one snuff company Is
divided into three companies, one with
a capital of $15,000,000. another with a
I capital of $8,0Q0.0qa and a third with
a capital of lf8.pqo.000. The licorice
companies are two. one with a capital
of $5,758,300 and another with a capl
tal ,of $2,000.000. There Is also the
British-American Tobacco company^ a
British1 wirpoitttioii. doing business
nbwtod With' a cHpltal of $26,0ti0.000.

eqrporatlpn
with acapltal of,
court the undefined and^nnlfmited dff Abated between two or more compa-
Certainly there la nothing in the deci- i whom the illegal combination acquired
and exercised its unlawful dominion.
Under tbe decree these defendants will
hold amounts of stock in tbe various
distributee companies ranging from 41
per cent as a maximum to 28% per
cent as a minimum, except in tbe case
of one small company, the Porto Rican
JUMJ
the
cgf:: £Io*tei
„Cte*r Stores,
JAMB8TC*H WKEKLT ALZKT
nies with a division of the prominent
brands In the same tobacco products,
so as to make competition not only
possible, but necessary. Thus the
smoking tobacco business of the coun
try is divided so that the present in
dependent companies bave 21.39 per
cent, while the American Tobacco com
pany will have 83.08 per cent, the Lig
gett & Meyers 20.05 per cent, the Loril
lard company 22.82 per cent and the
Reynolds company 2.60 per cent. The
stock of the other thirteen companies,
both preferred and common, has been
taken from the defendant American
Tobacco company and has been dis
tributed among its stockholders. All
covenants restricting competition have
been declared null and further per
formance of them has been enjoined.
The preferred stock of the different
companies has now been given voting
power which was denied it under the
old organization. The ratio of the pre
ferred stock to the common was as 78
to 40. This constitutes a very decided
change in the character of the owner
ship and control of each company.
In the original suit t'bere were twen
ty-nine defendants, who were charged
with being the conspirators through
Tobacco company, in which tbey will
hold 45 per cent. The twenty-nine in
dividual defendants are enjoined for
three years from buying any stock ex
cept from each other, and the group is
thus prevented from extending its con
trol during that period. All parties to
the suit and tbe new companies who
are made parties are enjoined perpet
uftlly from in any way effecting any
combination between any of the com
panies in violation of tbe statute by
way of resumption of the old trust
Each of tbe fourteen companies is en
joined from acquiring stock in any of
the others. All these companies are
enjoined from having common direc
tors or officers, or common buying or
selling agents, or common offices, or
lending money to each other.
8ize of New Companies.
Objection was made by certain in
dependent tobacco companies that this
settlement was unjust because it left
companies with very large capital in
active business and that the settle
ment that would be effective to put all
on an equality would be a division of
tbe capital and plant of the trust into
small fractions in amount more near
ly equal to that of each of the inde
pendent companies. This, contention
results from a misunderstanding of
the anti-trust law and its purpose. It
is not Intended thereby to prevent the
accumulation of large capital in busi
ness enterprises In which such a com
bination can secure reduced cost of
production, sale and distribution. It
is directed against such an aggrega
tion of capital only when its purpose
Is that of stifling competition, enhanc
ing or controlling prices and establish
inga monopoly. If we shall have by
the decree defeated these purposes
and restored competition between the
large units into which the capital and
plant have been divided we shall have
accomplished the useful purpose of
the statute.
Effectiveness of Decree.
I venture to say that not in the his
tory of American law has a decree
more effective Tor such a purposei)een
entered by a court than that against
the tobacco trust As Circuit Judge
Noyes said in his Judgment approving
the decree:
"The extent to which It has been
necessary to tear apart this combina
tion and force It into new forms with
the attendant burdens ought to demon-,
strate that the federal anti-trust statute
Is a drastic statute which accomplishes
effective results, which so long as it
stands on the statute books must be
obeyed and which cannot be disobey
ed without Incurring farreaching pen
alties. And, on the other hand, the
successful reconstruction of this or
ganisation should teach that the effect
of enforcing this statute Is not to de
stroy, but to reconstruct not to de
molish, but to recreate in accordance
with the conditions which the congress
has declared shall exist among, tbe
people'of tbe United States!"
Common 8toek Ownership.
It has been assumed that the pres
ent pro rata and common ownership In
all these companies by former stock
holders of the trust would Insures
continuance of the same old sihgle con
trol .of all the companies Into which
the trust has by decree been disinte
grated. This is erroneous and is based
upon the assumed lnefflcacy and irinoc
uousness of Judicial Injunctions.' The
companies are enjoined from co-opera
tion or combination: they have differ
ent managers, directors, purchasing
and sales agents. If all or many of
the numerous stockholders, reaching
Into the thousands, attempt to secure
concerted action of the companies with
a view to the control of the- market
their number Is-so large that such tin
attempt could not well be concealed,
and Its prlmeJ movers atod all Its partic
ipants would be at once subject to con
tempt proceedings and Imprisonment
of a summary character. The immedi
ate result of the present situation, will
necessarily be activity by all the com
1
panles under different managers."-and
then competition'muM follow or there
trill be activity by one company ahd
stagnation: by another. Only a short
flyneowil! Inevitably lead to a change
Under this arrangement each of the in ownership Of the tftoCk, as all op*
different kinds of bukiitasa will be din portunity for continued co-operation
must disappear. Those critics who

-mi
U fr
1
&
as a mere change of garments have noi
given consideration to the Inevitable
working of the decree and understand
little the personal danger of attempt
ing to evade or set at naught the sol
emn Injunction of a court whose object
Is made plain by the decree and whose
Inhibitions are set forth with a detail
and comprehensiveness unexampled in
tbe history of equity Jurisprudence.
Voluntary Reorganizations of Other
Trusts at Hand.
The effect of these two decisions has
led to decrees dissolving tbe combina
tion of manufacturers of electric
lamps, a southern wholesale grocers'
association, an interlocutory decree
against the powder trust, with direc
tions by tbe circuit court compelling
dissolution, and other combinations of
a similar history are now negotiating
with the department of justice looking
to a disintegration by decree and re
organization in accordance with law.
It seems possible to bring about these
reorganizations without general busi
ness disturbance.
Movement For Repeal of the Anti
trust Law,
But now that the anti-trust act is
seen to be effective for the accomplish
ment of tbe purpose of its enactment
we are met by a cry from many differ
ent quarters for its repeal. It is said
to be obstructive of business progress,
to be an attempt to restore old fash
ioned methods of destructive competi
tion between small units and to make
impossible those useful combinations
of capital and the reduction of tbe cost
of production that are essential to con
tinued prosperity and normal growth.
In the recent decisions tbe supreme
court makes clear that there is noth
ing in the statute which condemns
combinations of capital or mere big
ness of plant organized to secure econ
omy in production and a reduction of
its cost It is only when the purpose
or necessary effect of tbe organization
and maintenance of tbe combination
or tbe aggregation of Immense size are
the stifling of competition, actual and
potential, and tbe enhancing of prices
and establishing a monopoly that the
statute is violated. Mere size is no
sin against the law. Tbe merging of
two or more business plants necessari
ly eliminates competition between the
units thus combined, but this elimina
tion is in contravention of the statute
only when the combination is made for
purpose of ending this particular com
petition in order to secure control of
and enhance prices and create a mo
nopoly.
Lack of Definiteness In the Statute.
The complaint is made of the stat
ute that it is not sufficiently definite
In its description of that which is for
bidden to enable business men to avoid
its violation. The suggestion is that
we may bave a combination of two
corporations which may run on for
years and that subsequently the at
torney general may conclude that It
was a violation of the statute and that
which was supposed b.v the combiners
to be innocent then turns out to be a
combination in violation of tbe statute.
The answer to this hypothetical case
is that when men attempt to amass
such stupendous capital as will enable
them to suppress competition, control
prices and establish a monopoly they
know the purpose of their acts. Men
do not do such a thing without having
It clearly in mind. If what they do Is
merely for the purpose of reducing the
cost of production, without the thought
of suppressing competition by use of tbe
bigness of the plant they are creating,
then tbey cannot be convicted at tbe
time tbe union is made, nor can they
be convicted later unless it happen
that later on they conclude to sup
press competition and take the usual
methods for doing so and thus estab
lish for tbemselv.es a monopoly. They
can In such a case hardly complain if
the motive which subsequently is dis
closed Is attributed by tbe court to the
original combination.
New Remedies Suggested.
Much is said of the repeal of this
statute and of constructive legislation
intended to accomplish the purpose
and blaze a clear path for honest mer
chants and business- men to follow. It
may be that such a plan will be
evolved, but I submit that the discus
sions which have been brought out in
recent days by the fear of the con
tinued execution of the anti-trust law
.have produced nothing but glittering
generalities, and bave' offered no line
of distinction or rule of action as defi
nite and as clear as that which the su
preme court Itself lays down in en
forcing tbe statute.
Supplemental Legislation Needed, Not
Repeal
OP.
the disturbance to business that would
probably attend the dissolution of these
offending trusts. 1 said:
"But such an Investigation and pos
sible prosecution of corporations whose
prosperity or destruction affects tbe
comfort not only of stockholders, but
of millions of wage earners, employees
and associated tradesmen, must neces
sarily fend to disturb tbe confidence
of the business community, to dry up
the now flowing sources of capital
from its places of boarding and pro
duce a halt in our present prosperity
that will cause suffering and strained
circumstances among the Innocent
many for the faults of the guilty few.
The question which I wish In this
message to bring clearly to the con
sideration and discussion of congress
is whether, in order to avoid such a
possible business danger, something
cannot be done by which these busi
ness combinations may be offered a
means, without great financial dis
turbance, of changing tbe character,
organization and extent of their busi
ness Into one within the lines of the
law under federal control and super
vision. securing compliance with the
anti-trust statute.
"Generally in the Industrial combina
tions called trusts' tbe principal busi
ness is the sale of goods in many states
and In foreign markets—In other word«
the Interstate and foreign busln'
exceeds the business done In
state. This fact will justify xed
era! government in granting a federal
charter to such a combination to make
and sell in interstate and foreign com-,
merce the products of useful manufac
ture under such limitations as will se
cure a compliance with the anti-trust
law. It is possible so to frame a stat
ute that, while It offers protection to a
federal company against harmful, vex
atious and unnecessary invasion by tbe
states. It shall subject it to reasona
ble taxation and control by the states
with respect to its purely local busi
ness.
"Corporations organized under this
act should be prohibited from acquir
ing and holding stock in other corpo
rations (except for special reasons,
upon approval by the proper federal
authority), thus avoiding the creation
under national auspices of the holding
company with subordinate corporations
In different states, which has been
such an effective agency in tbe crea
tion of tbe great trusts and monopo
lies.
"If the prohibition of the anti-trust
act against combinations in restraint
of trade is to be effectively enforced
It is essential that the national govern
ment shall provide for the creation of
national corporations to carry on a le
gitimate business throughout the Unit
ed States. The conflicting laws of the
different states of the Union with re
spect to foreign corporations make it
difficult. If not impossible, for one cor
poration to comply with their require
ments so as to carry on business In a
number of different states."
I renew the recommendation of the
enactment of a general law providing
for the voluntary formation of cor
porations to engage In trade and com
merce among the states and with for
eign nations. Every argument which
was then advanced for such a law and
every explanation which was at that
time offered to possible objections has
been confirmed by our experience since
the enforcement of the anti-trust stat
ute has resulted in the actual dissolu
tion of active commercial organiza
tions.
It Is even more manifest now than
it was then that the denunciation of
conspiracies in restraint of trade
should not and does not mean the de
nial of organizations large enough to
be intrusted with our interstate and
foreign trade. It has been made more
clear now than it was then that a
purely negative statute like tbe anti
trust law may well be supplemented
by
Amendment.
I see no objection,^abd Indeed I can
see decided advantages. Jn the enact
ment of a law which shall describe
and denounce methods of competition
which are unfair and are badges of the
unlawful purpose denounced In the
anti-truat law. The attempt and pur

Such a bureau or commission might

executive tribunal of tbe dignity and I
power of the comptroller of the cur-j

mission, which now exercises supervls-i
ery power over important classes of|.
corporations under federal regulation.
The drafting of such a federal in
corporation law would offer ample op-i
portunity to prevent many manifest
evils in corporate management todaf,,
including irresponsibility of control ln!
the hands of the few who are not tbe
real owners.
Incorporation Voluntary.
I recommend that the federal char
ters thus to be granted shall be volun
tary, at least until experience Justifies
mandatory provisions. The benefit to
be derived from the operation of great
businesses under the protection of such
a charter would attract all who are
anxious to keep within the lines of the
law. Other large combinations that
fail to take advantage of tbe federal
incorporation will not have a right to
complain If their failure is ascribed to
unwillingness to submit their transac
tions" to the careful official scrutiny,
competent supervision and publicity
.attendant upon the enjoyment ot such
a charter.
Only Supplemental Legislation Needed.
The opportunity thus suggested for
federal Incorporation, it seems to me,
is suitable constructive legislation
needed to facilitate the squaring of
great Industrial enterprises to the rule
of action laid down by tbe anti-trust
law. This statute as construed by the
supreme court must continue to be the
line of distinction for legitimate busi
ness. It must be enforced unless we
are to banish individualism from all'
business and reduce it to one common
system of regulation or control of
prices like that which now prevails
with respect to public utilities and
which when applied to all business
would be a long step toward state so
cialism.
Importance of the Anti-trust Act.
The anti-trust act is the expression'
of the effort of a freedom loving peo
ple to preserve equality of opportunity.
It is the result of the confident deter
mination of such a people to maintain'
their future growth by preserving un
controlled and unrestricted the enter
prise of the individual, his industry,,
his ingenuity, his Intelligence and his
Independent courage.
For twenty years or more this stat
ute has been upon tbe statute book.
All knew its general purpose and ap-'
proved. Many of Its violators were
cynical over Its assumed impotence.
It seemed Impossible of enforcement.
Slowly the mills of the courts ground,
and only gradually did the majesty of
the law assert itself. Many of its
statesmen-authors died before It be
came a living force, and they and oth-'
ers saw the evil grow which they had
hoped to destroy. Now Its efficacy Is
seen now Its power Is heavy: now Its
object Is near achievement Now we
hear the call for Its repeal on tbe plea
that it interferes with business pros
perity, and we are advised In most
general terms how by some other stat
ute and In some other way the evil
we are just stamping out can be cured
If we only abandon this work of twen
ty years and try another experiment
for another term of years.
It Is said that the act has not done
good. Can this be said in tbe face of
the effect.of the Northern Securities
decree? That decree was in no way
so drastic or inhlbltlve in detail as ei
ther the Standard Oil decree or the
tobacco .decree. But. did It not stop
ment toward the control of all the
railroads of the country in a sihgle
hand? Such a one man power could
not have been a healthful Influence In
the republic, even though exercised
fitfder the general supervision of an
interstate commission.
Do we desire to make such ruthless
combinations and monopolies lawful?
