Federal Surgeons to Travel on A.-H. Steam
ships-War Talk Agitates Washington-Ship
Subsidy and Philippine Bills Will Pass.
(Mail Special to the Advertiser.)
WASHINGTON, D. C, December 2. The Marine Hospital authorities have
been ia communication much of late with the officers of the new American
Hawaiian line about precautions against yellow fever. Coatzaeoalcos, the
Pa -itic port of the new Tehuantepec railway, is a yellow fever nest of the
worst ebaraeiej-. With the starting of the new line of steamers the danger
of iareetiBg ports like Honolulu is fully realized. Dr. Walter AVvman, the
MjrwH general of the Marine Hospital Service, said today, however, that
precautious would be taken, certain to protect the Hawaiian Islands.
"Dr. Cofer, our officer at Honolulu, has been conferring over the matter,"
added Dr. Wjmau. "Capt. Burnham, the manager of the steamship company
is willing to co-operate with us to the fullest degree."
It is understood here that a surgeon of the Marine Hospital service will
travel eta the boats of the American-Hawaiian line, so as to keep the passengers
under surveillance. The steamship company will be glad to have the doctor
on board. His salary will be paid by the government but the steamship
company will allow him free transportation as it does its own employes. As
it requires only five days for yellow fever to develop, the Marine Hospital
service believes its doctors will detect all cases before the boats sailing from
'oatzaeoaieos reaeh Honolulu. The medical authorities will pay special atten
tion to toe destruction of mosquitoes en route and will see to it that none go
into Honolulu.
President Diaz of Mexico is known to be in accord with plans to fight
-the fever, aad so is the head of the Mexican health department. Some months
ago when there was an outbreak of yellow fever on the Texan border, the
Mfexiean authorities co-operated effectively with the United States authorities.
JDr. Wyraan will probably have a conference with President Diaz sometime
during the winter, as he purposes to visit Mexico to attend a medical Congress.
THE MOLOKAI CONTRACTS.
The Supervising architect 's office of the Treasury Department received
a request yesterday by cable to postpone the bids for construction of the
buildings for the leper sanitarium. It was then too late to grant the request
and tipervising Architect Taylor so cabled in reply. The Department was
much disappointed that there were no bids for the construction of the new
landing and roadway some weeks ago, as it was thought the completion of
rhat wark would reduce the cost of the buildings. Nothing is known here yet
abur the bids that have been filed, but they will be made public tomorrow.
THE WAR ALARM.
The alarnm bells have been ringing. "War, war, war," they have been
saying tiH there has come to be a very bellicose atmosphere in Washington.
It smstied a little like the warlike days of the Fifty-fifth Congress the War
Congress us many are still fond of calling it.
AH this was a second instalment of the Japanese war scare. It first
tarted some weeks ago when President Roosevelt sent Secretary of Com
merce am; Labor Metcalf to San Francisco to probe the troubles over the
-.larttinese school children. But that quieted down in a few days and the man
in the Street supposed that the Japanese question had become a secondary one.
It eonld be adjusted in due season without disturbing the amicable relations
between the Yankees of North America and the Yankees of the Orient.
SCARE RENEWED.
But 3 few days ago the scare was again abroad and the Japanese question
1-as loomed as the largest and most interesting at the threshold of the session
of Congress. Probably the Japanese exclusionists have been responsible for
tfcis. The California representatives started east with redhot resolutions in
their inside pockets. These resolutions were to be dumped into the House
and Senate. The Pacific coast statesmen were going to have a hot time.
Some impetus was also given to the opposition talk by the knowledge that
leaked out that the President was going to take the side of the Japanese.
The administration was grave over this turn of affairs. And for pretty
good reason. The President is confident that he can take care of the Japa
nese question but the newspapers began to print live war talk. Lurid inter
views from overheated lawmakers and officials were getting into print. Cable
tolls to Japan are over 50 cents a word for press matter, but there was danger
that wmv of this lurid talk might be cabled across, even at 50 cents a word
and inflame the Japanese. They are quite as excitable as are the people of
the Foiled States. While their government is a monarchy the Mikado and
his ministers at Tokio are quite as responsive to public sentiment as are the
President and members of his cabinet.

MAKAPUU
LIGHTHOUSE
Plans Are Completed
Honolulu Harbor
Lights.
TO TEACH
MAINLAND
The Makapuu lighthouse will be
erected on the promontory known as
the Makapuu Point, the structure to be
but thirty feet in height. The final
plans were completed yesterday by
Captain Slattery and will be forward
ed to Washington at once. Owing to
the height of the promontory and the
excellence of that site for the light
house it was finally decided to erect
the light there. As the light will be of
sufficient height above sea level al
most at the extremity of the point the
lighthouse will be only thirty feet high,
just enough to clear the light and lens
well above the ground and out of reach
of any chance of pebbles being wind
swept against them.
Captain Slattery expects to have the
controversy over the site of the Ho
nolulu rear range light settled soon.
He still hopes to have the light erected
at the intersection of Fort street and
the Esplanade, an ornament to the
waterfront as he claims.
Work on the new front light for Ho
nolulu harbor will be commenced
shortly. This will be to seaward of the
present harbor light and will be erect
ed on the new made island on the Ewa
side of the channel.

JUSTICE BBQWN
PBOBABLY DEAD
WASHINGTON,
Brown dead.
December 13.
The foregoing laconic cablegram
came in the Associated Press service
to
m-
the Advertiser, and for its
definiteness was withheld from print by
the night editor.
Probably the dead man is Justice
Henry B. Brown, of the United States
Supreme Court, who was lately an
nounced as retiring on account of the
infirmities of age. President Roose
velt nominated Attorney General
Moody to succeed him.
Justice Brown reached seventy years
of age this vear. He was from Michi
gan and was appointed to the Federal
supreme bench by President Harrison
in 1890.
There is also a probability that the
above despatch is duplicated with the
explaining word "General" in the
Washington news received last night.
AFTERNOON
CABLE REPORT
Secretary Wood and A. Gartley of
the Hawaii Promotion Committee talk
ed last evening at the meeting of thft
Territorial Teachers' Association held
at the High School. Mr. Wood's prin
cipal plan was to have stereopticon
slides prepared of scenes about the is
lands, together with a descriptive lec
ture concerning them, to be sent by the
schools to some state, as Nebraska, for
instance. The slides and lecture to be
started in the High School in Lincoln,
then passed along to various othet
schools in that city and then sent to
all cities and towns for ue in each
school.
Mr. Gartley spoke generally about
the help that schools might give and
dwelt suiiiewiiat on the school-letter
jjlHn. ''jh.it is ior pupils to write let
ters to pupils in schools on the main
land in exchange for others from there.
This would not only help Hawaii and
the pupils on the mainland receiving
the letters, but would give the local
school children an opportunity to learn
me art of descriptive letter-writing at
first hand.
Mr. Wood thought that Superintend
ent Babbitt of the Department of Pub
lic Instruction could readily prepare
the lecture to accompany the slides.
He went on further to say that a
list of all school teachers, in whatever
state is selected, could be obtained
from the State Superintendent. To
them the Promotion Committee could
send a folder concerning the plans of
the local schools for such an illus
trated lecture and follow it up with
folders concerning the islands. In this
way information about Hawaii could
be imparted to thousands of teachers
and scores of thousands of pupils. He
believed that such a plan would meet
with the hearty approval of teachers
in mainland states. The State Super,
intendent could readily give the press
statements concerning the lecture and
the local school system would be given
credit for what he considered a splen
did educational plan.
Mr. Wood thought that if the teach
ers fell in with this plan they might
devise ways and means to defray some
of the expense attached in a way
which would not be much to any of
them, sav ten cents a month from
teachers and five to ten cents a year J
from pupils. He believed that this
would appeal to the patriotism of
heads of families.
As to letter-writing. Mr. Wood said
that there was abundance of subjects
that could be utilized and would be of
the greatest interest to pupils else
where. There were topics such as su
gar cane. rice, flowering shrubs, his
torical events, legends, island history,
parly engineering works of the Hawai
lans. etc. These would be of the
greatest interest to people on the main,
land.
Mr. Wood personally offered a prize
of $5 to be made on his behalf by

(Associated Press Cablegrams.)
WASHINGTON, December 15. President Roosevelt will send
special messages to Congress next week dealing with the report of
Metcalf on the San Francisco school situation and Secretary Taft's
reports on the Cuban settlement and the matter of the disbanding
of the Twenty-Fifth Infantry, the regiment of negroes.
A special message will also be presented dealing with the condi
tions on the Panama canal zone as seen by the President.
FUEL FAMINE IS
GROWING SERIOUS
MINNEAPOLIS, December 15. Conditions throughout the Northwest
owing to the fuel famine have grown desperate. The farmers are tearing down
their outbuildings and burning the lumber. In some states appeals have been
made for the Governors to order out the militia to move the coal trains.
SEATTLE. December 15. The state university has been forced to close
because of the impossibility of securing coal for heating purposes.
At this season of the year throughout the Northwest a coal famine is a
most serious thing. Throughout several of the affected states there is certain
to be a vast amount of suffering and serious loss of life from the colJ. The
state of affairs two, weeks ago is shown in the following associated press report:
SEATTLE (Wash.), December 2. As high as $14 per ton is being paid by
householders for coal and a premium is being offered delivery men if they
can secure prompt supplies of fuel. Many dealers can now only provide
coal by the sack, and at that rate some consumers are paying as high
as $21 , ton, but these are isolated instances of the effect of the most serious
coal famine the Northwest has known.
Operators are absolutely unable to supply the markets, and coal which sold
last summer atN from $3.25 to $5 a ton commands the highest premium known.
Steamships can only get the coal absolutely needed to keep up steam, and all
factories are embarrassed. Seattle, though, is in far better condition than
Eastern Washington, where coal riots have occurred at North Yakima, and
where, in Colfax, wood has been sold as high as $70 a cord. The Pacific Coast
Steamship Company still refuses to increase its California shipments to take
care of the northern famine.
