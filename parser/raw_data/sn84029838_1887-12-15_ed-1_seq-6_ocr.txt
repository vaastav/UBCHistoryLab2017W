Bead With Interest.
"WAcnixoTOX, Dec. G. The President's
message was ready for both houses of
Congress as soon as business commenced
this morning. The document is unique in
that it deals with oniy one subject the
necessity or a reduction of taxation. The
President felt that th:s necessity was so
urgent that he departed from the ordinary
custom and devoted his whole message to
impress upon Congress the danger ol de
luy. The address plunges into the ques
tion at tho si art as follows:
To the Congr.'ts of the Unifcd Stctf:
You are confronted at the threshold of your
legislative duties with a condition of the na
tional finance which imperatively demands im
mediate and careful consideration. The amount
of money annually exacted, through the opera
tion of picsent laws, from the industries and
necessities of the people, largely exceeds the
sum necessary 1 meet the expenses of the
Government. When we consider that the
theory of our institutions guarantees to every
citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of
his Industry and enterprise, with only such de
duction as may be his share toward the careful
and economical maintenance of the Govern
ment which protects hint, it is plain that the
exaction of more than this is indefensible ex
tortion and a culpable betrayal of American
fairness and justice.
This wrong inflicted upon those who bear the
burden of National taxation, like other wrongs,
multiplies a brood of evil consequences. The
public treasury, which should only exist as a
conduit conveying the people's tribute to its
legitimate objects of expenditure, becomes a
hoarding-place for money needlessly withdrawn
from trade and the people's use, thus crippling
our National energies, suspending oar country's
development, preventing Investment in pro
ductive enterprises, threatening financial dis
turbance, and inviting schemes of public plun
der. Tli is condition ofourtreasury is not altogether
new; and it has more than once of late been
submitted to tho people's representatives in
the Congress, who alono can apply a remedy.
And yet the situation still continues, with ag
gravated incidents, more than ever presaging
linancial convulsion and widespread disaster.
It will not do to neglect this situation because
its dangers arc not now palpably imminent and
apparent. They exist none the less certainly,
and await the unforeseen and unexpected occa
sion when suddenly they will be precipitated
upon us.
Oa tho 80th day of June, 185, the excess of
revenues over public expenditures, after com
plying with the an.ual requirements of tho
Sinking Fund act, was l,S.W,?35.8t; during the
year ended June 30, lSSO, such excess amounted
to $19 4U3,ri5A'0; and during the year ended June
30. 18S7, it reached the sura of $Tm,567,&49.50. The
annual contributions to the sinking fund during
tho three years above specified, amounting in
the aggregate to ii:W,().8,3.'0.01, and deducted
from the surplus as stuted, were made by call
ing in for that purposi: outstanding three per
ceut. bonds of the Government.
1-jr.ng the six months prior to June .TO, 1837,
the surplus revenue had grown so large by re
veated accumulations, and it was feared the
withdrawal of this great sum of money needed
by the people would so affect the business of
the country, that tho sum of 79,Sil,lGO of
buch surplus was anpliod to the payment of the
principal and interest of the three per cent
bonds still outstanding, an'l which wliere then
payable at the option of the Government. The
precarious condition of financial affairs among
the people still needing relief, immediately after
the :i)th day of Juue. 1Ss7. the remainder of tho
three per cent, bonds then outstanding, amount
ing with principjl and interest to the sum of
?1 8,377,.' !!:i, were called in and applied to the
sinking fund contribution for the current fiscal
year.
Notwithstanding theso operations of the
Treasury Department the representations of
distress in business circle) not only continued
but increased, and absolute peril seemed at
hand. In these circumstances the contribution
to the sinking fund for the current fiscal
year was at once comploted by the ex
penditure of vJ7,05t,.tJ..-M in tho purchase of
Government bunds not due bearing 454
per cent, interest, the premium p:id thereon
averaging about twenty-four per cent, for the
former and eight per cent, for the latter. In ad
dition to this tho interest accruing during the
current year upon the outstanding bonded in
debtedness of the Govcruincnt wus to some
extent anticipated, and banks selected as
depositories of public money were permitted
to somewhat increase their deposits.
While the expedients thus employed to re
lo ise to the people the money lying idle in the
treasury served to avert immediate danger,
our surplus revenues have continued to accu
mulate, the excess for the present year amount
ing on the flr.t day ot December to ?.".Vi8,
701.19, and is estimated to reach the sum or
8'113,(XX),OJO on the 0-)lh of Juue next, at which
date it is expected that this sum. added to prior
accumulations, will swell the surplus in the
treasury to $140,000,000.
There seems to bo no assurance, that, with
such a withdrawal from use of the people's cir
culating medium, our business community may
not in the near future be subjected to the same
distress which was quite lately produced from
the same cause. And while the functions of our
National treasurv should be few aud simple, and
vhile its best condition would bo reachod, I be
lieve, by its entire disconnection with private
business interests, yet, when, by a perversion of
its purposes, it idly holds money uselessly sub
tracted from the channels of trade, there seems
to bo reason for tho claim that some legitimate
means should be devised by the Government to
restore in an emergency, without waste or ex
travagance, such money to its place among the
people. If such an emergency arises, there
now exists no clear aud undoubted executive
power of relief.
Heretofore the redemption of three per cent,
bonds, which were payable at the option or the
Government, has afforded a means for the dis
burscment or tho excess or our revenues: but
these bonds have all been retired, and there are
no bonds outstanding the payment or which we
have the right to insist upon. The contribution
to the sinking fund, which furnishes the occa
sion for expenditure in the purchase of bonus,
has been already made Tor the current year, so
that there is no outlet in that direction.
In the present state or legislation, tho only
pretense of any existing executive power to re
store, at this time, any part or our surplus rev
enues to the people by its expenditure, consists
in the supposition that the Secretary ot the
Treasury may enter the market and purchase
the bonds of the Government not yet due at a
rate of premium to be agreed upon. The only
provision of law from which such a power could
be derived is found in the appropriation bill
passed a number of years ago, and it is subject
to the suspicion that it was intended as tem
porary and limited in its application, instead
of conferring a continuing discretion and
authority.
No condition ought to exist which would
justify the grant of power to a single offloial,
upon his judgment of its necessity, to withhold
from or release to the business of the people, in
an unusual manner, money held in the treas
ury, and thus affect, at his will, the linancial
situation of the country: and if it is deemed
wise to lodge in the Secretary of the Treasury
the authority in the present juncture to pur
chase bonds, it should be plainly vested and
provided as far as possible with such checks
and limitations as will define thts official's right
and discretion, and at the samo time relieve
him from undue responsibility.
In considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a means or restoring to circulation the
surplus money accumulating in the treasury it
should be borne in mind that premiums must be
paid on a large part of these bonds held as in
vestments which can not be purchased at any
price, and that combinations among holders
who are willing to sell may unreasonably en
hance tho cost of such bonds to the Govern
ment. It has been suggested that the present bond
ed debt might be refunded at a loss rate of in
terest, and the difference between the old and
new security paid in cash, thus finding use for
the surplus in the treasury. The success of
this plan, it is apparent, must depend upon the
volition ot the holders or the present bonds;
and it is cot entirely certain that the induce
ment which must be offered them would result
in more financial benefit to tho Government
than the purchaso of bonds, while the latter
proposition would reduce the principal of the
debt by actual payment, instead of extending it.
The proposition totleposit the money held by
the Government in banks throughout the coun
try for use by the people is, it seems to me, ex
ceedingly objectionable in principle, as tat
lishlng too close a relationship between the
operations of the Government treasury and the
business cf the country, and too extensive a
commingling of their money thus fostering an
unnatural reliance in private business upon
public funds. If this scheme should be adopted
it should only be rtone as a temporary expedient
to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and
executive effort should generally be in the op
posite direction and should have a tendency to
divorce, as much and as fast as can safely be
done, the Treasury Department from private
enterprise.
Of course it is not expected that unnecessary
and extra vagant appropriations will be made for
the purpose of avoiding the accumulation or an
excess or revenue. Such expenditure, besides
the demoralization or all just conceptions or
public duty which it entails, stimulates a habit
ot reckless improvidence not in the least con
sistent with the missionr our people or the
high and beneficent ideas of our Government.
I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the
knowledge or my countrymen as well as to the
attention ot their representatives charged with
the responsibility or legislative relicr the grav
ity of our financial situation. The failure or
Congress "heretofore to provide against the
dangers which it was quite evident the very
nature or the difficulty must necessarily pro
duce, caused a condition of financial distress
and apprehension since your last adjournment
which taxed to the utmost all the authority
and expedients within executive control; and
these appear now to be exhausted.
ir disaster results rrom the continued inac
tion or Congress, the responsibility must rest
whore it belongs.
Though the situation thus rar considered is
fraught with danger which should be fully real
ized, and though it presents a feature of wrong
to tho people as well as peril to the country, it
is but a result growing out of a perfect and ap
parent cause, constantly reproducing the sae
alarming circumstances a congested National
treasury and depicted monetary condition in
the business of the country. It need hardly be
stated that while the present situation demands
a remedy, we can only be saved from a like pre
dicament in the future by the removal of its
cause.
Our scheme of taxation, by means or which
this needless surplus is taken from the people
and put into the public treasury, consists of a
tiriff or duty levied upon importations from
abroad and internal revenue taxes levied upon
the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and
malt liquors. It must be conceded that none
of the things subjected to internal revenue tax
ation arc, strictly speaking, necessaries. There
appears to be no just complaint of this taxation
by tho consumers or these articles, and there
seems to be nothing so well able to bear the
burden without hardship to any portion or the
people.
But our present tariff laws, the vicious, in
equitable and illogical source of unnecessary
taxation, ought to b3 at once revised and
amended. These laws as thoir primary 'and
plain effort raiso the price to consumers of all
articles imported aud subject to duty by pre
cisely the snm paid for such duties. Thus the
amount or the duties measures tho tax paid by
those who purchase for use theso imported
articles.
Many of these things, however, are raised or
manufactured in our own country, and the du
ties now levied upon foreign goods and products
are called protection to theso home manufac
tures, because they render it possible for those
or our people who are manufacturers to make
these taxed nrticlcs and sell them for a price
equal to that demanded for the imported goods
that have paid customs duty. So it happens
that while comparatively a few use the import
ed articles, millions of our people, who never
use and never saw any of the foreign products,
purchase and use things of the same kind made
in this country and pay therefor nearly or quite
the same enhanced price which the duty adds
to the imported articles.
Those who buy imports pay the duty charged
thereon into the public treasury, but the great
majority of our citizens, who buy domestic ar
ticles of the same class, pay a cum at least ap
proximately equal to this duty to the home
manufacturer. This reference to the operation
of our tariff lasvs is not made by way of instruc
tion, but in order that we may be constantly
reminded of the manner in which they impose a
burden upon those who consume domestic prod
ucts as well as those who consume imported
articles, and thus create a tax upon all our
people.
It is not proposed to entirely relieve the coun
try or this taxation. It must be extensively
continued as the source or the Government's
income, and in a readjustment ot our tariil the
interests or American labor engaged in manu
facture should bo carefully considered, as well
as the preservation of our manufacturers. It
may be called protection, or by any other name,
but relief from the hardships and dangers of
our present tariff law should be devised with
especial precaution against imperiling the ex
istence of our manufacturing interests. But
this existence should not mean a condition
which, without regard to the public welfare or
a National exigency, must always insure the
realization of immense profits instead of mode
rately profitable returns.
As the volume aud diversity of our National
activities increase, new recruits are added to
those who desire a continuance of the advan
tages which thoy conceive the.prcscntsystem of
tariff taxation directly effects. So stubbornly
have all efforts to reduce tho present condition
been resisted by those of our fellow-citizens
thus engaged, that they can hardly complain of
the suspicion, entertained to a certain extent,
that there existed an organized combination all
along the line to maintain their advantage.
We are in the middle of centennial celebra
tions, and with Incoming pride we rejoice in
American skill and ingenuity, in American en
ergy and enterprise, and in the wonderful
natural advantages and resources developed by
a century's National growth. Yet when an at
tempt is made to justify a scheme which per
mits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in the
land for the benefit of our manufacturers quite
beyond a reasonable demand for Government
regard, it suits the purposes of advocacy to call
our manufactures infant industries, still need
ing tho highest degree of favor and fostering
care that can be wrung from Federal legisla
tion. It is also said that tho increase in the price
of domestic manufactures resulting from the
present tariff is necessary in order that higher
wages may be paid to our worKingmcn em
ployed in manufactures than are paid for what
is called tho pauper labor of Europe. All will
acknowledge the force of an argument which
involves the welfare and liberal compensation
of our workingmen. Labor is honorable in the
eyes of every American citizen; and as it lies
at the foundation ot our development
and progress, it is entitled, without
affectation or hypocrisy. to the ut
most regard. The standard of our laborers'
life should not be measured by that of any other
country less favored, and they are entitled to
their full share of our advantages.
By the last census it is made to appear that
of the lT.SO.'.Uffl of our population is engaged in
all kinds of industries, 7,670.493 are employed
in agriculture, 4,074,23$ in professional and
personal service, (2,9'f4,87o or whom are do
mestic servants and laborers.) while 1,810,26
are 'employed in trade and transportation, and
3,837,11" arc classed as employed in manufac
turing and mining.
For present purposes, however, the last num
ber giveu should be considerably reduced.
Without attempting to enumerate all. it will be
conceded that there should be deducted rrom
those which it includes, 373. 143 carpenters and
joiners, 235,401 milliners, dressmakers and
seamstresses, lTii.T&j blacksmiths, 131,750 tail
ors and tailoresses, 103.473 masons, 70.341 butch
ers. 41,309 bakers. 23,033 plasterers, 4,831 en
gaged in manufacturing agricultural imple
ments, amountkg in the aggregate to 1,314.
033, leaving 2.023,089 persons employed in
such manufacturing industries as are claimed to
be benefited by a high tariff. To these the ap
peal is made to save their employment and
maintain their wages by resisting a change.
There should be no disposition to answer such
suggestions by tho allegation that they are in a
minority among those who labor, and there
fore shorn forego an advantage in the in
terest or low prices for the majority. Their
compensation, as it may be affected by the
operation of tariff laws, should at all times be
scrupulously kept in view; and yet with slight
reflection they will not overlook iw fact that
they arc consumers with tho rest; that they,
too, have their owa wants and those of their
families to supply from their earnings, and that
the prices of the necessaries of life, as well as
the amount of their wages, will regulate tho
measure of their welfare and comfort.
But the reduction of taxation demanded
should be measured as not to necessitate or
justiry either the loss or employment by the
workingman or the lessening or his wages; and
the profits still remaining to the manufacturer,
after a necessary readjustment, should fur
nish no excuse for the sacrifice or the inter
ests of his employes either in their opportunity
to work or in the diminution of their compensa
tion. Nor can the worker in manufactures fail
to understand that while a high tariff is claimed I
to be necessary to allow the payment of remun
erative wages, it certainly results in a very large
increase in the price of nearly all sorts of manu
factures, which, in almost countless forms, be
needs for the u-e or himself and his family. He
receive at the desk of his employer his wages,
and perhaps before he reaches his home is
obliged, in a purchase for family use ot an
article which embraces his own labor, to return
in the payment of the increase In price which
the tariff permits, the hard-earned compensa
tion ot many days of toil.
The farmer or the agriculturist who manu
factures nothing, but who pays the increased
price which' the tariff imposes upon every agri
cultural implement, upon all he wears and upon
all ha uses and owns, except the increase or his
flocks and herds and such things as in his hus
bandry he produces from the soil, is invited to
aid in maintaining tho present situation; and he
is told that a high duty on Imported wool is nec
essary for the benefit of those who have sheep
to shear, in order that the price or their wool
may be increasod. They, or course, are not re
minded that the farmer who has no sheep is by
this scheme obliged, in his purchases or cloth
ing aid woolen goods, to pay a tribute to
his fallow farmer as well as to the manufactur
er and merchant; nor is any mention made or
the fact that the sheep owners themselves and
their households must wear clothing and use
other articles manufactured from "he wool they
sell at tariff prices, and thus as consumers must
return their share ot this increased price to the
tradesman. I think it may be fairly assumed
that a large proportion or the sheep owned by
the farmers throughout the country are found
in small Mocks numbering rrom twenty-five to
fiy. Tho duty on the grade of imported wool
which those sheep yield is ten cents for each
pound if or the value or thirty cents, and twelve
cents ir or the value or more than thirty cents,
ir the liberal estimate or six pounds be allowed
for each fleece, the duty thereon would be sixty
or seventy-two cents, and this may be taken as
the utmost enhancement of the price to the
farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dol
lars would thus represent the increased price of
the wool from twenty-five sheep and thirty-six
dollars that from the wool of fifty sheep; aud at
present values this addition would amount to,
about one-third of its prii-e. If upon its sale
the farmer receives this or a less tariff profit,
the wool leaves his hands charged with precise
ly that sum, which in all its changes will ad
here to it, until it reaches the consumer. When
manufactured into cloth and other goods and
material for use its co3t is not only increased
to tho extent of the farmers' tariff profit but a
further sum has been added for the benefit of
the manufacturer under the operation of other
tariff laws In tho meantime the day arrives
when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase
woolen goods and material to clothe himseir
and family for the winter. When he faces the
tradesman for that purpose he discovers
that he is obliged not only to return in the
way or increased prices his tariff profit oa
the wool he sold, and which then perhaps lies
before him in manufactured form, but that he
must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a
further increase in cost caused by a tariff duty
on the manufacture. Thus in the end he is
aroused to tho fact that he has paid upon a
moderate purchase, as a result of the tariff
scheme, which, when he sold his wool, seemed
so profitable an increase in price, more than
sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he
received upon the wool he produced and sold.
When the number of farmers engaged in
wool-raising is compared with all the farmers in
the country, and the small proportion they bear
to our population is considered: when it is
made apparent that, in case or n large part of
those who own sheep, the benefit of the present
taritf on wool is illusory: and, above all, when
it must be conceded that the increase of the
cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a
burden upon those with moderate means and
the poor, the employed and unemployed, the
sick and well, and the young and old, and that
it constitutes a tax, which, with relentless
grasp, is fastened upon the clothing of every
man, woman and child in the land, reasons arc
suggested why the removal or reduction of this
duty should be included in a revision or our
tariff laws.
In speaking of the increased cost to the con
sumer of our home manufacture, resulting from
a duty laid upon imported articles of the same
description, the fact is not overlooked that com
petition among our domestic producers some
times has the effect of keeping the price ol their
products below the highest limit allowed by
such duty. But it is notorious that this compe
tition is too often strjngled by combinations
quite prevalent at this time, and frequently
called trusts, which have for their object the
regulation or the supply and price or commodi
ties made and sold by members or the combina
tion. The people can hardly hope for any con
sideration in the operation ot these selfish
schemes, ir, however, in the absence of such
combination, a healthy and free competition
roduces tho price of any particular dutiable
article or home production below the limit
which it might otherwise reach under our tariff
laws, and if, with such reduced price, its manu
facture continues to thrive, it is entirely evi
dent that one thing has been discovered which
should be carefully scrutinized in an effort to
reduce taxation. The necessity of combina
tion to maintain the price of any commodity to
the tariff point furnishes proof that some one
is willing to accept 1 wer prices for such com
modity, and that such prices are remunerative
and lower prices produced by competition prove
tho same thing. Thus where either of these
conditions exists, a caso would seem to bo pre
sented for an easy reduction of taxation.
The considerations which have been presented
touching our tariff laws are intended only to
enforce an earnest recommendation that the
surplus revenues ot the Government be pre
vented by the reduction of our customs duties,
and, at the same time, to emphasizu a sugges
tion that in accomplishing this purpose we may
discharge a double duty to our people by grant
ing to them a measure of relief from tariff taxa
tion where it is most needed and from sources
which it can bo most fairly and justly accorded.
Nor can the presentation made or such consid
erations be, with any degree or fairness, re
garded as evidence of unfriendliness toward our
manufacturing interests, or of any lack of ap
preciation of the value.
These interests constitute a leading and most
substantial element of our Nutional greatness
and furnish the proud proof or our country's
proarcss. Butir. in the emergency that presses
on us, our manufacturers are asked to surrender
something for the public good and to avert dis
aster, their patriotism, as well us a grateful re
cognition of advantages already afforded,
should lead them to willingly co-operate.
No demand is made that they shall
forego all the benefits of governmental
regard, but they can not fail to be ad
monished of their duty, as well as their
enlightened selMntcrcst and safoty, when
they arc reminded or tho fact that financial
panic and collapse, to which tho present condi
tion tends, afford no greater shelter or pro
tection to our manufactures than to our other
important enterprises. Opportunity for safe,
careful and deliberate reform is now offered,
and none of us should be unmindful of the time
when abused and irritated people, heedless or
those who have been resisted timely and
reasonable relicr, may insist upon a radical and
sweeping rectification ot their wrongs.
Tho difficulty attending a wise and fair revis
ion of our tariff laws is not underestimated. It
will require on the part of tho Congress great
labor and care, and especially a broad and na
tional contemplation or the subject, and a patri
otic disregard of such local and selfish ciaims as
aie unreasonable and reckless of the welfare or
the entire country.
Under our present laws more than four thous
and articles arc subject to duty. Many or these
do not in any way compete with our own manu
factures, and many are hardly worth attention
as subjects or revenue. A considerable reduc
tion can be made in the aggregate by adding
them to the free list. The taxation of luxuries
presents no features of hardship, but the neces
saries of life, used and consumed by all the
people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of
living in every home, should be greatly cheap
ened. The radical reduction of the duties imposed
upon raw material used in manufactures, or its
free importation, is of course an important fac
tor in any effort to reduce the price of these
necessaries. It would not only relieve them
trom the iucrcased cost caused by the tariff on
such material, but the manufactured product
being thus cheapened, that part of the tariff
now laid upon such product, as a compensation
to our manufacturers for the present price of
raw material, could be accordingly modified.
Such reduction, or free importation,
would servo beside to largely reduce
the revenue. It is not apparent how
such a change can have any injurious effect up
on our manufacturers. On the contrary, it
would appear to give them a better chance in
foreign markets with the manufacturers of
other countries, who cheapen their wares by
free material. Thus our people might have the
opportunity of extending their sales beyond the
limits -.f home consumption saving them from
the depression, interruption in business, and
loss caused by a glutted domestic market, and
affording their employes more certain and steady
labor, with its resulting quiet and contentment.
The question thus imperatively presented for
solution should be approached in a spirit higher
than partisanship and considered in the light of
that regard for patriotic duty which should
characterize the action of those intrusted with
the weal of a .confiding people. But the obliga
tion to declared party policy and principle is
not wanted to urge prompt and effective action.
Both of the great political patties now repre
sented In the Government have, by repeated
ana authoritative declarations, condemned the
condition of our laws which permit the collec
tion from the oeoole of unnecessary revenue, and
have, in the most solemn manner, promised IU
correction; and neither as citizens or partisans
are our countrymen in a mood to condone the
deliberate violations or these pledges.
Our progress toward a wise conclusion will
not be improved by dwelling upon the theories
of protection and rree trade. This savors too
much of bandying epithets. It is a condition
which conrronis us not a theory- Relief fom
this conpition may involve a slight reduction of
the advantages which we aw.ird our home pro
ductions, but the entire withdrawal of such ad
vantages should not be contemplated. The
question or free trade is absolutely irrelevant;
and the persistent claim made in certain quar
ters, that all efforts to relieve the people from
unjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes of
so-called free traders, is mischievous and far
removed from any consideration for the publio
good.
The simple and plain duty which we owe the
people is to reduce taxation to the necessary ex
penses of an economical operation or the Gov
ernment, and to restore to the business or the
country the money which we hold in the treas
ury through the perversion or governmental
powers. These things can and should be done
with safety to all our industries without danger
to the opportunity for remunerative labor
which our workingmen need and with benefit to
them and all our people by cheapening their
means of subsistence and increasing the meas
ure of their comforts.
The Constitution provides that the President
shall from time to time give to the Congress in
formation or the state or the Union." It has
been the custom or the executive in compliance
with this provision, to annually exhibit to the
Congress, at the opening or its session, the
general condition or the country, and to de
tail, with some particularity, the operations
or the different executive department. It
would be especially agreeable to follow
this course at the present time, and
to call attention to the valuable accom
plishments of these departments during the
last fiscal year, but I am so much impressed
with the paramount importance of the subject
to which this communication has thus far
been devoted that I shall forego the addition of
any other topic, and only urge upon your im
mediate consideration the "State or the Union"
as shown in the present condition or our treas
ury and our general fiscal situation, upon which
every clement of our safety and prosperity de
pends. The reports of tho heads of departments,
which will be submitted, contain full and ex
plicit information touching the transaction of
business intrusted to them, and such recom
mendations relating to legislation in the publio
interest as they deem advisable. I ask for
these reports and recommendations the delib
erate examination and action or the legislative
branch or tho Government.
There are other subjects not embraced in tho
departmental report demanding -legi-lativo
consideration, and which I should be glad to
submit. Some ot them, however, have been
earnestly presented in previous messages, and
as to them I beg leave to repeat prior recom
mendations. As the law makes no provision for any report
from the Department or Slate, a brier history of
tho transactions or that important department,
together with other matters which it may here
after be deemed essential to commend to the
attention of the Congruss, may furnish the occa
sion for a future communication.

short caucus upon tho question of filling
committee vacancies, but nothing was done
beyond supointing a Caucus Committee of.
seven, of which Senator Hoar is chairman,
to arrange the matter. Senators Blair, Al
lison, Evarts, Riddteberger, Dolph and
Sherman are tho other members of tho
committee. It will have its first meeting
this morning.
The Democratic Committee, having the
same subject in charge, also held a short
meeting, but a quorum was not present.
It is not proposed to make any demand for
a division of committee chairmanships, ac
cording to party strength, the Democrats
holding that the chairmanships belong to
the majority. The Democrats will take no
positive action in arranging minorities on
the Senate committees uutil they get the
Republican lists.
The tendency of events upon both sides
points to a harmonious arrangement of all
party matters iu connection with the or
ganization of the Senate and its commit
tees. The seating of Senator Tutpie and the
objection to Senator Faulkner were the re
sults of an understanding to which both
sides assented.

Two Chinese Faction Carrying- On I.Ike
White Folk.
San Fhacisco, Dec. 6. The San Jup
Company, a powerful Chinese organization
here, split some time ago into two factions,
called tho Bo Sin Seer and the Kie Sin
Seer. Some highbinders of the Kie Sin
Seer faction killed two men of tlio Bo Sin
Seer, and the latter commissioned a trusty
cutthroat named Long Ah Tick to avenge
the slaughter of its members. Long Ah
Tick accordingly killed Lee Yy, who hap
pened to be the first Kie Sin Seer man who
came iu range of his pistol. A party from
the Kie Sin Seer then went to the head
quarters of tho Bo Sin Seer faction and
tearing down the sign over the door
chopped it into pieces. This is considered
the highest indignity that can be offered a
highbinders' organization and can oniy bo
wiped out by bIo.nl.

A Ferocious Feline.
Raleigh, N. C. Dee. 0. Yesterday, near
Charlotte, Mrs. Sidney Armstrong was at
tacked by a mad cat as sho was passing
through a door in her house. The cat
sprang at her in the most ferocious man- I
tier, and fastened its teeth in her arm. bho
attempted to beat it off but failed. It made
desperate efforts to reach her throat, and
she screamed for aid. Her husbund came,
but the cat never relaxed its hold upon the
woman. Armstrong attempted to choke
the animal, but tn no purpose, and then
drew a knife and cut the cat's throat. Not
until then did it release the grasp of its
teeth upon the terrified woman. The lacera
tion of her flesh is serious, and it is feared
that the worst results may follow, as tho
cat was clearly mad.

A FATAL FALLACY.
I Can Drink, or I Can Let It Alone"
The Enslavement of the Human Will.
Among the fallacies of inteniper
rtnee, none is more fatal than the tip
pler's favorite saj'ing: "I can drink, or
1 1 can let it alone." It sounds manly
and masterful. It tickles the vanity of
the speaker. It implies on his part a
great reserve of will power, which
makes it perfectly safe for him to in
dulge in the pleasure of alcoholic stim
ulation, because, at an)- moment, he
can put the indulgence from him by an
effort of his will.
Part of the above quotation is unde
niably true, but part of it is on a par
with that serpentine "whisper so false
and so fatal: "Ye shall not surely die!"
"lean drink," needs no demonstra
tion; or, if it does, the enormous foot
ings of our annual liquor bill will fur
nish ample proof. "I can let it alone,"
I coming from the lips of :i total :i1
staincr, expresses the exact truth; but
in the mouth of a drinker, it is like the
empty boast of Samson, when he wist
not that his strength had departed
from him. "Or," is a little word, but
in the familiar quotation at the head of
this article, it interposes a barrier
which few in their own strength are
j able to pass. "I can drink, or I can
drink, or I can drink" is usually the
way that the series runs down to life's
'sad close.
I Three reasons may be given to show
. that the use of intoxicating liquors as a
. beverage is likely to lead to the entire
, enslavement of the will. One import
ant office of the will is to rule the pas
sions and appetites. These are not self
regulating, but their tendency is to
wards excess. The will was given to di
rect and hold in check these necessary
but dangerous powers of man's nature.
Like meddlesome horses properly har
nessed and skillfully guided, they arc
noble servants as long as the strong
hand of volition is on the reins. Now
real life proves conclusively that, even
under ordinary circumstances, the pas
sions and appetites are not easily con
trolled. But add tho powerful stimu
lation of alcohol, and the task becomes
doubly difficult; because it in Humes
tho passions and strengthens the ap
petites. This is especially true of the
entire lower range of man's nature.
Anger, hate, revenge, lust, leap up
iierce and strong, as though some de
mon had been adding fuel to their tires.
Now, even if the strength of Avill were
not impaired in tho meanwhile, alco
holized passions go beyond its strength.
If a driver is barely able to restrain
one prancing pair of horses, it will not
do to double the team, and ask him to
drive four-in-hand. If the will has
enough to do yes, sometimes more
than enough to hold in check man's
unruly passions when they are at their
ordinary pitch, it is easy to predict
what will be tho result when alcohol
doubles their strength. If one desires
particulars, let him turn to'the records
of police and criminal courts.
A second significant fact is that in
temperance raises tip a Judas among
tho habits, who will seek occasion to
bctra- the will, anil deliver it into the
hands of its enemies. Ever)' good
habit is the friend and helper of the
will. It is, we may say, conserved
volition; for habits arc formed by un
numbered acts of the will turned in
the direction of some line of conduct,
making action in that line easy. When
a good habit is once established, the
will is relieved from the necessity of
constant and minute supervision, and
may safely turn its activity in other
directions. Without tho power of
forming habits there could be no such
thing as confirmed character. All vo
lition would be tentative, and would
apply to the act of the moment. Man
would be represented by his passing
volition, rather than by the sum of all
his past volitions. His conduct would
be fickle; his character would not in
crease in mass and momentum.
But, unfortunately, bad habits as
well as good can be formed; and of all
bad habits, intemperance sets itself
most powerfully against the will. The
will helps to form it, but when it gains
a certain degree of strength, it be
comes :i rebel, and defies the will. It
seats itself in the ficsh; lays hold on
even' fiber of the body; makes the
passions its allies; diligently feeds the
fires of thirst; laughs at reason and
conscience, aud breaks through the
mandates of the will as though they
were of little worth. When it arises in
its strength the most solemn resolu
tions are swept before it, as autumn
leaves are carried by a November
storm.
But the third fact shows the fatal
power of intemperance in the clearest
light. Not only does the use of alco
hol in any form tend to establish a
habit with which the will may not be
able to cope, bnt it also weakens the
trill. A few illustrative examples,
will be more forcible than formal ar
guments. Iu Robert Burns, one of the bright
est geniuses that Scotland ever knew,
the balance between volition and pas
sion was uncertain, even when he was
at his best. When his father was near
his end, he said that there was one of
his children whose future tilled him
with painful anxiety. Robert heard
the remark, and coming to tho bed
side, he said: "Oh, father! is it me
that you mean?" The dying man said
that it was so, and Robert turned away
with tears streaming down his cheeks.
The father had noted with pride the
genius of his boy; but ho had also
noted the strong passions with the
weak will, which might drive him on
the shoals of life.
But the poet might have lived to a
happy and honored old age, had ha not
fallen a victim tolhe conviviality of his
times. Deep drinking weakened his
will and constitution. A bottle and a
friend could easily win him from duty
io drunkenness. He knew his own
weakness, and prophesied what the
end would be years before it came; yet
he j'ieldcd his will more and more to
the fatal habit which enslaved him.
How sadly true is tho following stanza
of "A Bird's Epitaph" descriptive of
himself written while he yet seemed
to hrve the disposal of his life in his
own hands.
The poor inhabitant below
Was quick to learn and wise to know.
And keenly felt the friendly slow,
And sotter flame:
But thoughtless follies laiil him low.
And stam'd his name."
The record of his closing years is
very painful reading, because the in
firmities of his will becomes more and
more evident.
And one of America's sweetest sing
ers, Edgar Allen Poe. was a man
whose will was so sadly weakened by
alcohol, that there was no safety for
him except in total abstinence. N. P.
Willis thus speaks of him:
"Poe was usually the most quiet,
regular and gentlemanlike of men, re
markably neat in his person, elegant
and orderly about his work, and whol
ly unexceptionable in conduct and de
meanor. But in a weak moment,
tempted, perhaps lw a friend, or by tlio
devil, Opportunity, he would take
one glass of wine or liquor. From that
moment he was another being. His
self-control was gone. An irresistible
thirst for strong drink possessed him,
and he would drink and drink and
drink, as long as he could lift a glass
to his lips. If he could not get good
liquor, lie would drink bad; all he de
sired was something fiercely stimulat
ing. Ho would frequently keep this
up for several days and nights, until,
in fact, his system was perfectly ex
hausted, and he had been taken help
less and unresisting to bed."
Poets should never touch alcholic
stimulants or seductive drugs. God
has keyed their souls to a suf
ficiently high pitch without the
aid of such dangerous excit
ants. The opium habit of the poet
Coleridge, furnishes another pathetic
example of impaired will. ' He hated
the vice which had entangled itself
about his will, like the serpents about
the struggling laocoon. When his
friend Cottle begged him to break the
opium habit, and tried to encourage
him to the endeavor, he replied: "You
have poured oil into the raw and fest
ering wounds of an old friend's con
science, Cottle; but it is oil of vitriol.
For ten years the anguish of my spirit
has been indescribable, 1 have prayed,
with drops of agony on my brow
But there is no hope"
Conceive a spirit in hell, emplo3-cd in
tracing out for others the road to that
Heaven from which his crimes exclude
him! Coleridge had simply lost will
power. His perception of virtue, his
passion for it remained, indeed was in
tensified by the evil of vice. Yet he
could not will for virtue!
Now it would be easy to add a score
of cases to those already given all of
them men of mark to show that in
temperance steadily and fatally
weakens the will.
To sum up the case: Intemperance
inflames the passions and appetites; it
forms a habit which may become
stronger than the will; and at the
same time it steadily impairs the
strength of the will.
These are facts which no one can
reasonably deny; and they show what
dangers lurk in the saying: "1 can
drink, or I can let it alone." It is
sometimes true; but most of the men
who boastingly utter it, drink until
the' can not let it alone.
Let us all turn this fallacy of intem
perance into a Temperance motto.
Do you drink? Then "let it alone;" for
only thus can you demonstrate your
power. Have you never used alcohol?
Then "let it alone," and it will let you
alone. Rev. A. 11. Train, in Union
Signal.

Home-Made Wine and Cider.
A pet tlicorj- of those who are un
willing to accept total abstinence as
the truest Temperance, in the line of
liquor-drinking, is that pure wines and
ciders are comparatively harmless, in
contrast with adulterated liquors. Yet
there is no form of drunkenness which
has more of brutality in it than that
which is a result of cider-drinking;
and from the days of Noah to the pres
ent da, a man who h:is been made
drunken by home-made wine is likely
to be as disgracefully drunken as if it
were strychnine whisky which had
brought him down. Only a few day
ago a silk-weaver in Hebron, Conn.,
murdered his wife and two children,
and then set fire to the house. He was
a Swiss immigrant, and believed in
home-made liquors. The telegraph
report reads: "He had half a dozen
barrels of home-made wine and cider
in his cellar, and drinking from these
made him crazy, and promoted the
murder." If the blood-stained ashes
of his household show the sort of homo
made by home-made wine and cider,
total abstinence from these liquors
would seem to be the truest Temper

CARE OF HORSES.
Why T liey Must Not lie Exposed in Cold
nuil Stormy Weather.
It is not generally realized to what
an cutout loss in horsellcsh is suffered
on account of exposure in stormy and
cold weather, not only in cities, but
also on farms. When the horse is
driven rapidly or required to draw
heavy loads, the action of tlio heart i-r
increased, the blood circulates mora
freely and rapidly to the lung, and
the surface of the body, and he become?
heated. Then the horse sweats more
or less, and when iu this condition is
more sensitive and mora liable to be
injured by currents of cold air or by
exposure to rain. This is not
sufficiently considered, and it is a
very common occurrence to sec
such a horse left by his driver
to stand on the street without any pro
tection whatever until ho is chilled
through. Even where there is some
appearance of care, in tho way of pro
viding a blanket for uso on such occa
sions, this is frequently put on in such
a way as to lor.vo tho most sensitive
portions of ihe body exposed. When
a horse is allowed to stand so that cur
rents of cold air strike tho breast, the
result is likely to be more or less se
rious lung trouble, and this mav be
brought about in much less time than
many suppose. The horse is less liable
to be injured by extreme cold when ho
h kept moving, than by a mod
erately cool currenc of air when
he is tied and compelcd to stand for
even a short time exposed to it Par
ticularly is this so when a horse, hav
ing been fed liberally, ha3 laid on
flesh rapidly, and having had little ex
ercise, is soft, so ho sweats easily and
is susceptible to even moderate
changes of temperature, which aro
liable to prodnce inflammation of the
Inng tissues. Such a horse needs to lx
driven or worked moderately, and
should be well protected when it is
necessary to leave him standing in
harness. This subject should have,
iuo consideration by owners and driv
ers of both roadster and work, horacs.
