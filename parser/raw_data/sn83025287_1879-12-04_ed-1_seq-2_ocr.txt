ST. PAUL, THURSDAY, DEC. 4, 1879.
THE Republican party in Massachusetts,
which gave Grant a majority of nearly
ninety thousand over Seymour, finds hard
work, now-a-daya, to aLow two thousand
At the last State eleotion in November
Long's majority was only eighteen hundred
votes.
MB. BUOKNEB has introduced a bill for a
tax on the consumption of whisky instead
of on its manufacture. The thing won't
work. If men were obliged to make returns
on the amount of liquor consumed by them
daring the year, there would be a rich har
vest for the father of lies.
IT must be a pleasant thing to be a repre

During his recent tour through the country
Minister Foster was accompanied by a guard
of two hundred armed men to protect his
precious carcass from any who might wish to
indulge in rifle practice with his body for a

THE Grant boom is swelling. Robeson
has just declared for him, following the ex
ample of Belknap, Williams, Fomeroy, Mo
Donald, McKee and the rest of the unsavory
gang. If there are any of the thieves of the
Grant regime who have not pronounced in
favor of their old chieftan, they had better
fctep forward and record themselves.
SHERMAN VOWS vengeance upon the man
who purloined his report from the govern
ment printing office. It is not at all prob
able that he will ever be able to discover the
culprit. Yet we would suggest that it may
be the Rev. Dr. Lorimer, of Chicago, whose
"unconscious memorization," and "satura-
tion," may have enabled him to give it to
the ungodly press.
THK Representative from Colorado pro
poses that the Ute reservation in Colorado
be confiscated by the government and the
Indians removed from the State. This will
no doubt be doue ultimately, so that those
who have cast covetous eyes upon the rioh
mineral deposits with which that section
abounds may have the opportunity to grat
ify their cupidity.
FOR several months past the Republicans
have been claiming that Louisiana was a Re
publican State, and if permitted to hold a
free eleotion would so declare herself. An
eleotion was held on Tuesday at which there
was no violence of any kind. The State
had been imperfectly canvassed by both par
ties, but nevertheless a fall vote was out, and
the Demooratie tioket was elected by an
overwhelming majority. Large numbers of
the negroes cast their votes for the Demo
cratic candidates, and appear to be as well
pleased with the result as are their white
brethren.

ROTATION IN OFFICE,
The usual contention about the distribu
tion of offices has been resumed at Washing
ton. At the extra session the Republicans
in the Senate asked the privilege of retain
ing sosae of the employes of that body who
had served honorably in the war and were
incapacitated by reason of wounds from
other work. This request was granted, but
it has been ascertained that with but three
exceptions none of the Republicans re
tained had ever served a day in the army.
This discovery has led some of the Demo
crats to insist that the programme inaugu
rated by the Republicans of giving office to
none bnt men of undoubted party fealty be
carried out by the Democrats, and that all
Republicans be made to walk the plank.
The Republicans, however, talk a good deal
about the rights of minorities, just as if,
when they were in power, they recognized
those rights.
Mr. Hayes, in his annual message, de
voted several columns to a sermon on the
subjeot of civil service reform, and advo
cated a search for the fittest men to occupy
official positions, and, when they are found,
their perpetual retention in office. His the
ory is a very beautiful one, no doubt. Yet
it is somewhat surprising that it was not
discovered during the nineteen years in
which the Republican party has held the
reins of power. It is only when it is abso
lutely certain Jhat the party must step down
and out that the beauties ot the new system
are discovered, a faot that leads to the pre
sumption that it was invented only in the
hope that it would avail to keep some Re
publicans in office after the tenure of office
of the party .has expired. Had the party
practiced suoh a theory in the days when it
had absolute sway, its present protestations
would not be open to so much ridicule. As
it is, the Republicans must expect to be
dealt by as they have dealt with others.
lhis question of the distribution of offices
is not of vital importance to the welfare of
the country. W presume that men can be
found in both parties who are fitted to per
form the duties of any office in the gift of
the people or of the heads of the several de
partments. It has happened thus far in our
history that each party has retained power
for along enough period to keep its chosen
employes as long as men should be permit
ted to live at the publio expense, and there
has been no necessity for changes of such
frequenoy as to in any way impair the pub
lic service. Occasional changes are bene
ficial. They promote increased activity,
greater diligence and more faithfulness. It
does any department of the government a
great deal of good to have a new broom oc
casionally, that will sweep out the rubbish
and oobwebs that have accumulated through
long years of indolence and half hearted
work.
It may not be good policy to change of
flcials because of their political views. It is
certainly bad policy to dismiss a good Re
publican to make room for a bad Democrat
or vice versa, but all things being equal we
see no impropriety in the Democrats claim
ing the fruits of success. If they were un
able to do so, the chief incentive to exertion
would be removed. As long as the privi
lege is not abused there is no valid objection
to its exercise, and though the Republicans
may squirm at being obliged to surrender
their fat offices, they have no other alterna
tive.

TO HER HUSBAND'S ANSWER,
A Tale of Marital] UnhappluessHoiv (He
Got Angry ^.and WhyChohlng. Pound
ing, Kicking Out of Bed, Etc.Afrald^of
Her L'fe, She Flees from Her .Husband.
Mrs. Huddleston pur* in a rejoinder to her
husband's answer, in her suit for divorce. It
opens with a raking fire and poutB hot shot all
the way through. It ia as follows:
The State of Minnesota, County of Ramsey
District Conrt.
Helen M. Huddleston vs. Thomas A. Huddles
ton. The plaintiff, for reply to the answer of de
fendant in this actien, shows to the court.
The plaintiff avers that at the time she mar
ried the defendant she wan devotedly attached
to him and she had no reason to doubt that her
attachment was as warmly reciprocated.
That the oruelty and inhumanity of the de
fendant to her gradually destroyed her confi
dence in and respect for him, and she was at
last compelled to regard the defendant only
with fear and dread.
That when Harmon, the oldest child of the
plaintiff, was about five weeks old, and when
she was without servants to do the housework
or cooking, the plaintiff came home and order
ed that some game be prepared and cooked
for his dinner. A sister of plaintiff who had
been with her and taken care of her from the
time of the birth of the said child of plaintiff,
undertook to fill theorders of the defendant,
and about the time she had the game ready for
him to eat he became illnatnred and angry and
in that mood sulkily left the house.
That the plaintiff and her said sister kept the
defendant's cooked game warm for him till
evening, at which time he returned and insist
ed that the game cooked for dinner would not
suit him, and that fresh game must at once be
prepared and cooked for him. The condition
of plaintiff was such-that she conld not well do
this and the sister of plaintiff refused to do so,
and this made the defendant madder than
ever, and he grew fnnous and desperately
abusive to both plaintiff and her sister.
That the said acts of the defendant took place
at the time referred to in the answer relative to
the alleged interference by the Bister of plain
tiff with the defendant's household affairs, but
plaintiff denies that then or any time prior to
her final leaving him, she left him for any pur
pose of desertion, or for any other purpose than
visiting her relatives, with the full knowledge
and consent of defendant.
At the time mentioned in the complaint,
when defendant kicked plaintiff out of bed, the
defendant had. onthe Raid night before said oc
currence, been fretting and soolding her until
after midnight, and the plaintiff was greatly
agitated and wearied by his said conduct, and
begged him to allow her to go to sleep. This
request '"iriitated" the defendant to despera
tion, and he at once with great anger and vio
lence kicked plaintiff out of bed but plaintiff
admits that her fall from the bed was only
about fourteen inches. That as soon as plain
tiff rose to her feet defendant, who bad got out
of bed, again thrust her upon the floor
and when she again arose, defendant
threw her upon the bed and com
menced pounding her, and was finally
"interfered with in his family affairs," by the
sister of plaintiff and the daughter of defend
ant, and by them pulled away from plaintiff
and held by them while plaintiff escaped from
the room. The defendant then pulled down
the plaintiff's clothes which were hanging in a
closet and in a great rage ordered her to leave.
That the plaintiff was greatly injured on said
occasion by the defendant and on account of
the same was confined lo her couch some three
days.
The plaintiff avers that she has always tried,
while she lived with the defendant, to make
his home a happy and prosperous one, but that
all her efforts failed, by reason of the manner
and oonduct of the defendant, which seldom
failed to become shadowed with gloomy appre
hensions of a storm of wrath and abuse when
he entered his dwelling, and as a rale his de
portment, while at home, was abusive to suoh
a degree that all dreaded hiscoming and fear
predominated over every other sentiment.
That it was a constant and painful study of
the plaintiff to devise means to keep the de
fendant good-natured when he came home.
That it was the habit of defendant to remain
out nearly all night and come home at late
hours and often in a state of intoxication that
if not under the influence of liquor he would
oorae home feeling ugly and ill natured, and
keep plaintiff awake till morning,''scolding,
threatening and abusing her. That plaintiff,
on account of her children andhousehold du
ties, was obliged to be up in the morning at an
early hour, while defendant usually remained
in bed till nine or ten o'clock, or later, and re
quired a separate meal when he was ready for
it. That when plaintiff got up in the morning
defendant would often require her to leave his
room and dress in another, so as not to disturb
him. On some oooasions, when the abuse of
defendant became unendurable and she became
fearful of personal injury, she would escape
from his bed and seek refuge in the bed of
Minniethe daughter of defendant.
On one occasion, about four months before
her daughter Mary was born, while plaintiff
was in bed with defendant, he scolded, threat
ened and abused her to suoh an extent that she
attempted to get out of hit bed and leave the
room, but defendant caught her and locked her
in theroom, where she Bpent the remainder of
the night on the floor. The next daythe arms
of plaintiff were black and blue from injuries
received at the hands of the defendant.
The defendant never had any patience with
the babies. Instead of assisting plaintiff in
the care of them, he would become very much
enraged if they disturbed him in the least.
When they cried it made him angry. One
night, some time after the birth of the young
est child, the defendant had been scolding and
abusing the plaintiff, who was in bed with the
defendant and her said babe, rendering sleep
impossible, thesaid child became restless and
fretful and the Dlaintiff in the morning arose
from the bed and commenced bathing and
dressing the child. At this the defendant com
menced talking very abusively and angrily to
plaintiff andordered her to take the child and
leave the room. Plaintiff replied that she
would as soon as she finished dressing him at
that defendant jumped out of bed and began
swearing in the most frantic manner and said,
"I ought to kill you for not obeying at once.
Leave the room immediately." Thereupon
the plaintiff did leave the room of the defend
ant, andmade np her mind that thereafter she
would occupy a separate room, where she
could spend her nights in peace and have a
place to dress herself and children in safety.
That on account of the cruelty of defend
ant, the plaintiff was thus driven to a separate
room and bed. That sheleft the bed of the
defendant only when shewas peremptorily or
dered to do so by the defendant. That for
months and even years before doing so, she
was in nightly fear that the defendant would
do her great personal injury and possibly take
her life.
Plaintiff denies that at any time there were sus
picions circumstances as averred in the answer
or otherwise, relative to her character or eon
duct.
That at the time mentioned in the com
plaint, when he choked her, she with empha
sis denied to him that she at any time or in any
manner had been guilty of any impropriety, and
on account of the said denial, the defendant
grew furious and seized her as stated in the
complaint.
At the time mentioned in the complaint and answer
when the occurrence took place relative to a glass of
ale thrown in the face of plaintiff, the defendant
avers that the family, with defendant, were at the ta
ble, and the defendant was mad because the meal did
not suit him, and was scolding and complaining of
the plaintiff on account of the same in a manner so
usual that no one paid any attention, and none but
defendant said anything that the little son of the
parties made some remark which was not noticed by
defendant, and to which plaintiff replied In a laugh
ing manner. This "irritated" the defendant beyond
endurance, and he at once dashednot the remnants
but a glass of ale into the face of plaintiff, and im
mediately rushed upon her and knocked her to the
floor, and kicked the chair onto her. Defendant's
daughter then assisted her to get up, and he then
drove plaintiff into a corner and commenced choking
and kicking plaintiff, defendant's daughter all the
time trying to pu 1 him away. Her brother, the de
fendant's son, ateo attempted to assist, but was or
dered to let him alone, which he did, on the threat
by defendant that he would turn him out and never
do anything

of defendant'sydaughtert
plaintiff reached the haD door to leave the room
where defendant kicked her into said hall.
That at the time when defendant alleges In his an
swer he took a scanty breakfast, and as he was start
ing down town the morning, the plaintiff informed
him that as she was without sufficient help and it was
verywarm, and they were tired, she would like to have
Mm, for that day, take his dinner down town, and
the family would lunch at dinner time, and she
would have supper at six. Defendant did not an
swer, but as he did not come home at noon, she took
it for granted he had his dinner down
town, and at the time appointed the plaintiff pre
pared supper. When defendant came home he en
tered the dining room, and seeing the table spread
and every thing on it for supper, without saying a
word, made a rush at plaintiff, seized her by the hair
and commenced shaking her by it, and exclaimed,
'I'll see whether you can cook a dinner or not." 'The
daughter of defendant then told him she would call
some one In, and starting to do so, the defendant as
saulted her and kicked her out of the front door and
told her to leave. He then went up stairs and out
the fancy work of his said daughter's Into shreds, as
mentioned In the complaint.
About one month previous to this last mentioned
occurence, the defendant came home at 8 o'clock at
night, and not finding a hot dinner, which had been
ready and served at noon, but finding Instead the
usual supper spread on the table, in a great rage he
kloked the table over, smashing crockery, glassware
and nearly every thing on the table.
The plaintiff avers that she has ever been economi
cal, industrious and faithful In the discharge of her
domeatio duties that on the contrary the defendant
has been extravagant, exacting, Improvident and
reckless iu the expenditure of money to gratify him
self and for himself, pud cbld, calculating and pe
nurious in the expenditure of money for his fam
ily.
That as to what is the actual Income of the defend
ant, plaintiff is uninformed aud has no means ot
proving definitely, but plaintiff avers on Information
and belief the the same exceeds the sum of one
thousand dollars per year.
The plaintiff denies that the defendant has made
expenditures beyond his income to gratify or pro
vide for her or his family, and avers that the ex
penses have been chiefly for and upon himself.
The plaintiff denies that the defendant is a fit per
son to have the care or custody of the said children
She avers that bis manner of life at home is Inimical
to their morals and their happiness That during
the latter years that plaintiff lived with him, the de
fendant would invite his boon and convivial compan
ions to his home, semetimes six or eight at a time,
and with them drink, carouse and play at cardsOil
midnight, when the plaintiff would be required to
oook and prepare for those gentlemen, to some of
whom she had not even been introduced, a warm
supper, In doing which she had no other aid than
that of a nurse girl, and when at the hour of mid
night they had partaken of supper, these worthy
companions and guests of the defendant would re
sume their wine and their cards, where they would
remain playing and, as plaintiff believes, gambling
fall daylight, when the defendant would go to bed.
That on the occasion of these orgies the son ofde
fendant was required to act as waiter in bringing
wine and such other drinks as were adapted to the
hifcts of these guests, and would witnesstheir trans
actions, while at times he would drink the wine from
the glass they had leftunemptied.
The plaintiff admits the averments in the answer
that the defendant is "possessed of an impulsive na
ture and a hasty temper," and she aversthat in addf
tl to those qualities, he is inordinately selfish and
domineering, and to gratify his appetite and desires
would utterly disregard the feelings and comfort of
the plaintiff, and require of her the submission of a
slave rather than the devotion and love of a wife.
The plaintiff denies that she is calculating, secretive
orscheming, but she admits that in all her sufferings
at the bands of the defendant, she has tried to over
come hei sense of resentment to keep cool and make
use of that intelligence Bhe had to so conduct her
self that her domestio griefs and personal fears
would not break np the family and consign her chil
dren to the possibility of a separation from her in
case of a separation from her husband.
Plaintiff admits that she abandoned defend nt's
home during his absence, andavers that her personal
fear of defendant led her to do so, as she would no.
dared to have left hadhe been at home.
he defendant admits that her brother Milford
Harmon is indebted to her, but she avers that her
cause of action against him accrued more than six
years ago, and that the said Harmon is insolvent and
the said demand cannot be collected.
The plaintiff denies each and every allegation in
the answer that is not contained in the complaint nor
herein admitted or specifically queened in this re
ply

THE WELLER DIVORCE.
Mrs. Welter Falls to Make Out a Case
Against Her Husband.
A decision was rendered by Judge Brill yes
terday, denying the application for dissolution
of the marriage vows, or other relief, in the
divorce case of Emeline Darling WeHer against
her husband, Emery A. Weller. The history of
this disgustingly unique case, and the sensa
tional developments of the recent trial are al
ready so well known to the public as to not re
quire repetition, as by reference to the decis
ion it will be seen that the allegations of the
plaintiff respecting the unheard of conduct of
defendant are denied as beyond the range of
probability, and he stands vindicated before
the public.
Following is the full text of the decision:
This cause was tried at the general Septem
ber term of the court for the year 1879.
The decision of the court is as follows: That
the allegations of the complaint respecting the
marriage of the parties, their age, residence,
and the issue of the marriage are trne.
Fr om the time of their marriage to the day
before the commencement of this action plain
tiff and defendant virtually cohabited as bus
band and wife, and defendant, during said
period, supported plaintiff andtheir child and
furnished them with the necessaries and com
forts of life according to his means.
The allegations of the complaint relative to
the conduct of thedefendant and the cruel and
inbaman treatment of plaintiff by defendant,
contained in the fourth, fifth and sixth folios
of the complaint, are not proven to the satis
faction of the court, and are severally found
to be untrue. The remaining allegations of
the pleadings are not material and are not
passed upon. As a conclusion of law it fol
lows that plaintiff is not entitled to any relief.
Let judgment be entered accordingly, without
costs or disbursements to either party.

ROCHESTER.
Mr. H. Helverson, who owns a farm in the town of
Vernon, Dodge county, while seated at the supper
table bad his door thrown open and a tab, red whis
kered man In Irish brogue demanded his money or
his life at the point of a revolver. Mr. thinking
that discretion was the best way out of the scrape,
handed him bis wallet, which the robber opened and
counted out the money, throwing down the pocket
book, (he did Lotbythe way get a large sum.) He
then ran eft* in the darkness. Later in the evening,
at about o'clock, at a point four miles west, the
same man entered a farm house of a Norwegian
woman and demanded money. She pretended not to
understand him. He began ranssokhw the house.
After a familiar search of twenty minutes, he went
to the stable for a horse, but from some cause was
frightened and tooktothefields.Saturday night as S.
Strangerland and K. Newson were returning home,
whennear the farm of J. Neville, in the town ofBo
cheater, two men approached them, one stopping the
horses, the other came to the left side of the wagon,
and pointing a pistol at Newson fired. Btangeland,
who carried a small revolver inside his mitten, fired
through it at the robber, and It Is thought he hit
him in the arm, as itdropped to his side. The one
at the hones' heads hearing the cry of his confeder
ate, came to his aid, and three shots were exchanged
in rapid succession. Thisall happened In about two
minutes, and in a turn in the road. As the last
shot was fired, the would-be robbers took to the
woods. The horses started off, and were soon away
from tbe scene of so much reckless shooting. This
highway robbery Is making business for our hard
ware merchants, as no one feels safe without carry
ing a revolver if happening to be in the country late
at night.

StocksThe market was strong and buoyant dur
ing the greater portion of the day, and the tone of
speculation was much steadier than for some time
past. A very firm feeling prevailed throughout the
morning, and during the early part of the after
noon, under heavy purchases, in which ooal shares
werethe most conspicuous, prices advanced steadily
until an Improvement of %lft per cent was es
tablished, the latter In Nashville, Chattanooga ac St.
Louis, which sold up from 69ft to 74. Shortly be
fore the close the bears made a raid and put prices
down K@2 per cent, in the general list and 3H per
cent. In Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific, but in final
dealings the market recovered its firmness and the
dosing quotations showed a recovery of H1% per

of leading operators, and interviewing seems to be

SUGAR CANE.
The Deliberat'ons of the -Convention of
Cane GrowersThe Early Amber Recom
mended for Northern GrowthElection
of Officers.
ST. LOOTS, Deo. 3.The first annual conven
tion of theMississippi valley cane growers as
sociation met here at the Polytechnic building
this morning with a very fair attendance from
the Western States. In the absence of John
Walker, of Missouri, the president of the asso
ciation, F. Miller, of Minnesota, was
called to tbe chair. Isaac Hodges, corres
ponding secretary, read a lengthy report in
which he stated that since tbe organization of
the association last spring he has been in corre
spondence with persons in twenty
five States and Territories, regarding the cul
ture of sorghum cane and the manufacture of
sugar therefrom. He finds very great interest
being taken in this matter throughout the
countiy, especially in the North, and much at
tention is being given to tbemanufacture of
sugar. The report is quite interesting, and
contains many suggestions and much informa
tion of value to those interested in the pro
motion and growth of this new industry.
A. report from Prof. Stewart, of MurphyB
ville, la., was read, which cited successful cases
of crystallizing sugar from sorghum and Indian
corn by tbe use of his process. He said the
Chinese or Asiatic cane was the best sngar pro
ducing variety in the country. It can be
grown wherever corn is raised. We had ob
tained from Indian corn from 1,630 to 2,400
pounds of sugar to the acre. A discussion of
the paper revealed the faot that several mem
bers had obtained very different results from
the use of Prof. Stewart's process, and that this
process is by no means the only one by which
sugar can be produced from sorghum cane.
At tbe afternoon session the following of
ficers were elected: President, Isaac N. Hodges,
St. Louis vice presidents, M. G. Leonard, Illi
nois O. T. Miller, Minnesota Thos. McLinston,
Ohio Jas. Colgate, Indiana Norman Oohmer,
Missouri E. 8. Jones, Tennessee secretary,
E. S. Jones, Pulaski, Tennessee treasurer, E.
W. Douglass, St. Louis corresponding secre
tary and expert, Geo. O. W. Belcher, St. Louis.
Several letters from members unable to attend
the convention, giving their experience in grow
ing cane and making sngar and syrup, were
read. Tbe discussion of seeds, variety and
culture, then came up in the regular order of
business, and a number of members gave their
experience. 0. F. Miller, of Tennessee, thought
tbe Minnesota grown seed preferable to that
climate, the cane from it being earlier than
cane raised in more southern sections. South
ern-grown seed produces a large cane and more
syrnp, but tbe cane does not, as a rule, ma
ture early enough for the extreme Northern
