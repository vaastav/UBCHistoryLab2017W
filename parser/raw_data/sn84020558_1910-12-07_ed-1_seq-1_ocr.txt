It was addressed, the governments of
Russia and Japan apprehended practi

larger plan, which prevented their
ready adherence. The question of con

by means of an international loan to
China is, however, still the subject of
friendly discussion by the interested
parties.
The policy of this government in
these matters has been directed by a
desire to make the use of American

China's welfare and material prosper

Washington, Dec C. The following
Is the text of the president's message
, transmitted to congress today:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: During the past year the
foreign relations of the United States
have continued upon a basis of friend
ship ana good understanding.
ARBITRATION.
The year has been notable as wit
nessing the pacific settlement of two
important international controversies
before the Permanent Court of The
Hague.
The arbitration of fisheries dispute
between the United States and Great
Britain, which has been the source of
nearly continuous diplomatic corres
pondence since the first convention of
ISIS, has given award which is satis
factory to both parties. This arbitra
tion Is particularly noteworthy in only
because of the eminently just results
secured, but also because it is the
first arbitration held under the gen
eral arbitration treaty of April 4, 1S9S.
by the United States and Great Britain
and disposes of a controversy, the set
tlement of which has resisted every
other resource of diplomacy, and which
for nearly ninety years has been the
cause of friction tetwcen two countries
whose common Interest lies in main
taining the most friendly and cordial
relations with each other. The United
States was ably represented before the
council and I should be wanting in
proper recognition In a great patriotic
service if I did not refer to the lucid
historical analysis of the facts and
the signal ability and force of argu
ment six days in length presented
to the court in support of our case
by Mr. Elihu Root.
The tribunal constituted at The
Hague by the governments of the
United States and Venezuela lias com
pleted its deliberations and has ren
dered an award in the case of the
Orinoco Steamship company against
Venezuela. The award may lie re
garded a3 satisfactory since it has,
pursuant to the contentions of the
United States, recognized a number of
imjiortant principles making for a
judicial attitude in the determining
of international disputes. In view of
grave doubts which had been raised
as to the constitutionality of The
Hague convention for the establish
ment of an International prize court,
now before the senate for ratification,
because of that provision of the con
vention which provides that there may
be an appeal to the proposed court
from the decisions of national courts
this government proposed in an Iden
tical circular note addressed to those
powers which had taken part In the
London maritime conference that the
powers signatory to the convention it
confronted with such difficulty, might
insert a reservation to the effect that
appeals to tha. International prize court
in respect todecisions of its national
tribunals should take the form of a
direct claim for compensation; that
the proceedings thereupon to be taken
should be In the form of a trial de
novo, and that judgment of the court
should consist of compensation for the
illegal capture, irrespective of the de
cision of the national courts whose
Judgment had thus been internation
ally involved. As the result of an
informal discussion it was decided to
provide such procedure by means of a
separate protocol which should be rat
ified at the same time as the prize
court convention itself.
Accordingly, the government of the
Netherlands, at the request of this
government, proposed under date of
May 24. 1910, to the powers signatory
to The Hague convention, the negotia
tion of a supplemental protocol em
bodying stipulations providing for this
alternative procedure. It is gratify
ing to observe that this additional pro
tocol is being signed without objec
tion by the powers signatory to the
original contention, and that there is
every reason to believe that the In
ternational prize court will lie soon
established.
The identical circular note also
proposed that the international prize
court when established should be en
dowed with the functions of an ar
bitral court of Justice under and pur
suant to the recommendation adopted
by the last Hague conference. The
replies received from the various pow
ers to this proposal inspire the hope
that this also may be accomplished
within the reasonably near future.
It Is believed that the establishment
of these two tribunals will go a long
way toward securing the arbitration of
many question which have heretofore
threatened and. at times, destroyed
the peace of nations.
PEACE COMMISSION.
Appreciating these enlightened ten
dencies of modern times tiie congress,
at its last session, passed a law pro
viding for tlie appointment of a com
mission of five members "to be ap
pointed by the president of the United
States to consider the expediency of
utilizing existing international agencies
for the purpose of limiting the arma
ments of the nations of the world by
international agreement and of con
stituting the conibined navies of tlie
world an international force for the
preservation of universal peace, and
to consider and report upon any other
means to diminish the expenditures
of the government for military pur
poses and to lessen the probability of
war."
I have not as yet made appointments
to this commission because I have In
vited and am awaiting the expressions
of foreign governments as to their
willingness to co-operate with us in
the appointment of similar commis
sions or representatives who would
meet with our commissioners and by
joint action seek to make their work
effective.
EUROPE, CANADA, ETC.
Several important treaties have been
negotiated with Great Britain in the
past twelve months. A preliminary
diplomatic agreement has been reached
regarding the arbitration of pecuniary
claims which each government has
against the other. This agreement,
with the schedules of claims annexed,
will, as soon as the schedules are ar
ranged, be submitted to the senate for
approval.
JPne convention concluded January
If. 1909, between the United States
and Great Britain, providing at settle
ment of international differences be
tween the United States and Canada,
including the apportionment between
the two countries of certain of the
boundary waters and the appointment
of commissioners to adjust certain
other questions, has been ratified by
both governments and proclaimed.
The work of the international fish
eries commission in adopting regula
tions governing me iisneries or tne
boundary waters of Canada and the
United States is also referred to.
PORTUGAL.
In October last the monarchy In
Portugal was overthrown, a provis
ional republic was proclaimed and
there was set up a de facto govern
ment, which was promptly recognized
by the government of the United
States for purposes of ordinary inter
course, pending formal recognition by
this and other powers of the govern
mental entity to be duly established
by the national sovereignty.
LIBERIA.
The negotiations which have been
undertaken for the amelioration of the
conditions found in Liberia by the
American commission whose report I
transmitted to congress on March 25th
last, are being brought to conclusion
and it is thought that within a short
time practical measures of relief may
be put into effect through the good
offices of this government and the cor
dial co-operation of other governments
interested in Liberia's welfare.
THE NEAR EAST.
Turkey: Reference is made by the
president to the accession of his ma
jesty, Mehemet V, emperor of the Ot
tomans, and the desire of the United
States to contribute to the larger
economic and commercial development
due to the new regime in Turkey.
The rapid development now begin
ning in that ancient empire and tlie
marked progress and increased com
mercial importance of Bulgaria, Rou
mania and Servia, make it particularly
opportune that the possibilities of
American commerce in the near east
should receive due attention.
Montenegro: The president ex
presses pleasure in having accorded
recognition of tlie United States to
the new kingdom of Mentenegro.
THE FAR EAST.
The center of interest in far east
ern affairs during the past year has
been in China. It is gratifying to note
the negotiations for a new loan to the
Chinese government for the construc
tion of the trunk line railway lines
from Hankow southward to Canton
and westward through the Yangtse
valley, known as the Hukaung loan,
were concluded by the representatives
of the various financial groups In May
last, and the results approved by their
respective governments. The agree
ment already initiated by the Chineso
government in now awaiting ratifica
tion. The basis of the settlement of
the terms of the loan was one of ex
act equality between America, Eng
land. France and Germany in respect
to financing the loan and supplying
materials for the proposed railways
and their future branches.
flf SENATORS
Three New Men Began Ser
vice Yesterday
LISTENED TO MESSAGE
will immediately be submitted to both
houses of congress. There Is some
question as to the method that will Iks
followed after the reports are re
ceived. The democrats say they will
insist that the reports be taken up
for consideration and Immediate at

SCENE SHIFTS IN
ANTI-TRUST CASES
Its .Reading Required Most
of the Session Supreme
dourt Appointments Fur
nish Political Gossip of
Hour in Washington.
Washington, Dec. C. Practically all
the time of both houses of congress
today was occupied by the reading of
President Taft's message. In tlie
senate three new senators were sworn
in. Claude A. Swanson of Virginia
succeeds tiie late John W. Daniel; Jo
seph M. Terrell of Georgia is the suc
cessor of the late Senator A. S. Clay,
and LuFayette Young of Iowa suc
ceeds the late Senator Dolllver.
THE TARIFF.
Washington, Dec. ti. Senator Cum
mins of Iowa will Introduce a resolu
tion in the senate tomorrow, designed
to help In the revision of certain
schedules of the tariff law. The rule
will permit the taking up of a single
schedule for revision without render
ing the balance of the law open for
amendment.
Senator Cummins also will Intro
duce a resolution limiting to sixty
days tlie time that a bill may le held
In a senate committee. Th resolu
tion provides that after that time the
bill may be called upon tlie floor of
the senate, as though the committee
had reported it back.
SUPREME COURT TALK.
Washington, Dec. C Senator Cum
mins of Iowa, the insurgent Ieader-of
the upper house of congress, culled at
the White House today. Mr. Cum
mins spent an hour or more with
President Taft. He waited until tlie
end of a busy afternoon in order to
see the president alone.
It is said the senator again talked
to the president regarding the su
preme court appointments and made
a report on several suggested candi
dates. Iowa is In the eighth circuit,
which he represented', and in supreme
court appointments President Taft is
anxious to consult as many senators
and congressmen from the circuit as
possible.
Senators Bacon and Terrell and
Representative Bartlett of Georgia
were at the White House to urge the
appointment of Judge R. Lamar of
Augusta, Ga., a democrat.
Senators Penrose of Pennsylvania,
Dick of Ohio and former Senator
Spooner of Wisconsin all talked su
preme court to the president late
today.
It may be said authoritatively that
while the president's list of ellgibles
Is daily narrowing, he will not be in
a position to announce the new jus
tices until next week. Political con
siderations, it is declared, are not en
tering into the deliberations.
BIG BATCH OF INDICTMENTS RE
TURNED BY GRAND JURY.
Sixteen Firms and Thirty-Two Indi
viduals Each With Two Bills of
Six and Four Counts.
BALLINGER-PINCHOT REPORT.
Washington, Dec. C. The report of
the republican members of the Bal-linger-Pinchot
Investigating commit
tee has been completed and will be
submitted to the full meeting to be
called by Senator Nelson tomorrow
or Thursday. It Is expected the ma
jority report, together with the re
port made by the democratic mem
bers and the Independent report of
Representative Madison of Kansas
Detroit, Dec. 6. Tlie anti-trust
campaign of Attorney General Wick
ersham shifted to Detroit this week
with the result that Indictments were
returned by the federal grand jury to
day against sixteen firms and thirty
two individuals alleged to have secured
control of 85 per cent of the annual
output of the enamel Ironware of bath
tubs, sinks, lavatories, etc.. In the
United States. Criminal proceedings
grew out of the action to disclose the
alleged combination, begun by the gov
ernment in the federal court at Balti
more. Hearings have been held In
Chicago, Pittsburg and New York dur
ing the last forty days.
The two indictments agninst each de
fendant contain six and four counts
respectively and charge the defendants
with controlling 85 per cent of the an
nual output, combination to restrain
the trade of manufacturers and of
jobbers' In plumbing supplies In refus
ing to sell jobbers handling goods of
so-called Independents, the fixing of
re-sale prices, the dividing of the
United States into eleven zones and re
fusing to sell to Jobbers who do not
maintain re-sale prices. It is charged
that the effect of the re-sale process
was to make the price the same
throughout the United States and to
eliminate the competition of jobbers
as well as manufacturers.
The Indictments also charge that the
defendants compelled jobbers to enter
uniform contracts and that all defend
anst refused" to sell any Jobber unless
he would sign a contract.
The government officials took the
ground that the evidence in the civil
suit established the fact that the de
fendants attempted to disguise the
combination by the subterfuge of pur
chasing patents to certain tools and
licensing certain firms to use these
tools.
The government places great weight
on the testimony of Edwin L. Wayman,
of Pittsburg, who is described as a
licenser of the alleged combine, and
whose testimony In the civil suit had
given him immunity from criminal
proceedings.
The government charges that Way
man obtained $7,000 from the People's
State bank of Detroit, giving 100
shares of the Standard Sanitary Manu
facturing company as security, that
using this fund to purchase several
patents. $5,000 went back to the Stand
ard company for patents that It Is al
leged were turned over to the combina
tion. Wayman Is not a oluntary wit
ness. The government charges Wayman
with the collection of $5 a furnace a
day from each of the sixteen defend
ant firms, some of which had -as many
as eighty furnaces, and that after two
months those firms that did not vio
late the agreement received a rebate
of SO per cent of this contribution.
Wayman's collections. It Is scid. ran
as high as $700 a day. The defendant's
against whom indictments were found
will be required to appear at once 'in
the federal court and give bonds for
their apparance.

Seattle. Dec. 6. Customs officers
searching the Great Northern steam
ship Minnesota today found twenty
five tins of smoking opium wrapped
in a gunny sack ,hidden under
a crank shaft of the ship. Today the

THE RISING
STRUCTURE
Making of the Constitution
Going on Apace
RECALL QUESTION AGAIN
Democrats, Who "Would
Strike It Out in Spite of
Gloomy Outlook and Lim
ited Time, Have Not Yet
Given Up All Hope.
There were no developments In the
constitutional convention yesterday in
respect to the-recall; that it, no such
developments as theme who have been
trying to have it eliminated thought
might take place and there is not
a flnhering prospect that there will
be any though those democrats who
have been moving in that direction,
last night hud not given up hope
and were working more feverishly
than ever.
They have not received much en
couragement from any source. It is
practically certain that there can be
no modification of the recall article
and it is entirely certain that there
can be no separate submission. The
republican members would oppose
that and though they would prob
ably join in a movement for the
total elimination of the article, they
would prefer not to have the sub
ject brought up again in any form.
Therefore, -as to the recall, it must
be a clear back down or nothing.
When that article was reached In
the course of the consideration by
the committee of the whole, of such
articles as had come from the print
er. Dr. Tuthill moved an amendment,
relieving the Judloiary from the oper
ation of the -recall. He quoted an
address by President Taft In which
the latter advocated an untramxneled
judiciary and he took it from that
that the president would not appro-e
a constitution thnt disgracefully
trammeled the judges. He did not
believe that congress would approve
such a constitution.
Tiiere were no other remarks in
favor of the amendment but Mr.
Feeney offered a unique argument
against it. He believed that on ac
count of the meager salaries which
had been provided by the constitu
tion for the judges, a class of men
would be secured which would make
the recall very desirable.
The motion was defeated by the
following vote:
Ayes, 14 Baker. Cassidy. Cooper.
Curtis. Franklin, Hutchinson, Kingnn.
Langdon. Orme, Puscli, Scott. Stan
dage. Tuthill. Wells.
Nays, 32 Bolnn. Brndner, Cobb,
Coker, Colter. Connelly, Crutchfield.
Cunnlff. Cunningham. Keeney, Gold
water. Ingraham. Jones of Yavapai.
Jones of Maricoim. Keegnn. Kinney.
Lovin, Lynch. Moeur, Moore, Morgan.
Osborn. Roberts. Short. Sims, SImms,
Tovrea. Weinberger. Wills, Winsor,
Wood. Mr. President.
Messrs Doe. Jacome and White of
the republicans were absent. Prob
ably two democrats who were not In
the chamber would have voter for
the motion and no doubt several who
voted against it would hnve cast
their votes Tor it if there had been
a probability of its success.
This article will be before the con
vention today on the report of the
committee of the whole when prob
ably the final effort will be made to
secure its amendment or elimination.
The convention spent a considerable
part of tlie time in a waiting attitude.
There was a limit to what the printer
could do. According to the rules which
required that the constitution should
be brought before the convention in its
entirety, there was nothing on hand
and would not likely be for some days.
Mr. Goldwater suggested that the
convention take up such parts of It
as had been acted upon In the whole
committee. Tlie committee the night
before had gone over the preamble, the
declaration of rights, state boundaries,
distribution of powers, the legislative
proposition, the Initiative and referend
um, and a part of "legislature."
Accordingly final consideration of
these articles was begun. Notwith
standing they had been threshed over
time and again, other efforts at amend
ment were made and now and then the
need of it was seen. But there were
no attempts at essential change and
before 11 o'clock all of the articles had
been passed, presumably for the last
time, though there will be more time
until tlie convention has finally nd
ourned. The republicans voted generally
against every article. Messrs. Ellin
wood and Webb voted with them
against the declaration of rights, the
latter stating that he did so because
the matter contained therein was quite
superfluous. Everything, to which the
declaration related was fully trcaied of
elsewhere.
An ordinance relating to the election
on the ratification of the constitution
was brought in by a spechil commit
tee. It prescribed the duties of all of
ficers who are supposed to have any
thing to do with the election ma
chinery. Mr. Ellinwood sought to
amend that part of the ordinance con
cerning the duties of boards of super
visors. His amendment was of a pre
cautionary nature and provided that in
case any board of supervisors should
fail for a period of five days to per
form tho duties imposed upon it by this
ordinance, those duties should devolve
upon' George W. P. Hunt, the president
of this convention.
It was the consensus of opinion that
this amendment had not been offered
In solemnity of spirit, but that it had
been inspired by the frequency with
which the name of Mr. Hunt appears
in the ordinance relating to the first
state election.
Mr. Ashurst's Approval.
A long communication to the presi
dent from Henry F. Ashurst was read.
It was eulogistic of the action of the
convention and it recited among the
achievements of the convention all
those more "progressive" measures
which their oppenents call populistic.
In the opinion of Mr. Ashurst, the con
vention had immortalized itself in lay
ing broad and deep the foundation of
the democratic party in this territory.
The convention could have asked
nothing more flattering than this. But
Mr. Ashurst is, or has beengh-en to
extravagant encomium. It is recalled
that not so long ago. when the Hearst
craze was at its height in this terri
tory and when many of the men who
are now back of the more extreme
measures which have been adopted by
the -constitution were of the Hearst
party, Mr. Ashurst in the course of a
speech delivered at Flagstaff instituted
a comparison between William Ran
dolph Hearst and Jesus Christ. In this
comparison Mr. Hearst was not given
the worst of it. Mr. Ashurst Is more
over looked upon as an aspirant for
the office of United States senator in
the improbable event of statehood.
Respect for the People:
Some time after the usual hour for
convening In the afternoon another In
stallment had been received from the
printer, including executive department,
judicial department, the irrevocable
ordinances, the recall and impeach
ment. These along with "legislature."
which had not been finished the night
before were taken up in the whole com
mittee and were disposed of.
No important amendments were of
fered or proposed in the proposition
relating to the legislature; but there
was one incident which illustrated in
an amusing manner the peculiar atti
tude of the convention toward the
"people." Now and then the convention
gets out of that attitude, but once its
attention is called to it it hurriedly re
sumes it.
Section 19 of the proposition is, or
was: "The legislature shall not pass
local or special laws In the following
cases:" which were the-i enumerated.
There was no difference of opinion as
to the propriety of the provision, but
on second thought it appeared to be an
insult to the "people" in that they had
not been mentioned In connection with
the legislative power. In order to show
proper deference to the "people" It was
proposed to amend as follows: "The
legislature or the people under the Ini
tiative shall not," etc. But on third
thought this show of deference might
be a more stinging insult, for was not
the provision a restrictive one? Would
it be proper to prevent the "people"
from doing anything? Finally a happy
way was found out of it. "Legislature"
was cut out and "people" was not put
in. The problem was sidestepped in
this wise: "No local or special laws
shall be enacted," etc.
No More Packet Veto.
The consideration proceeded with
minor amendments. Messrs. Kingan
and Ellinwood in the course of the ju
dicial proposition rose frequently for
purposes of inquiry to ask if this or
that proposition did not conflict with
one elsewhere or to inquire what this
or that section meant. The reply was
not always enlightening and frequently
no reply was deigned'.'
It was made plain that the evil of
the pocket veto by the governor had
been abolished. So if a legislature
has in mind a particularly vicious
measure which it fears will not pass
the governor, all it need do is to wait
until a few days before adjournment
and pass it. The governor is then
robbed of his veto power.
Dr. Tuthill secured one amendment.
In fixing the salaries of the superior
Judges, Greenlee county was classed
with several of the smaller counties
for which the salriry of the judges was
fixed at $3,000. Dr. Tuthill moved
that Greenlee be put Into a class by
Itself and that Its judge be allowed a
salary of $3,500. That was carried.
Previous to that an effort was made to
increase the salaries of the supreme
court justices to $6,000. That failed, as
did another proposition to reduce the
sa'ary to $4,000.
Then' the recall and Impeachment ar
ticle was disposed of after which the
report of the committee was made to
the convention which took up the work
and put the finishing touch on It.
In the morning session Chairman
Short of the printing committee pre
sented a resolution -which was adopted
providing for the printing of a large
number of copies of the constitution
for distribution to all voters in the ter
ritory whose names can be found on
the great registers. Copies are to be
sent to all senators and lepresentatlves
and to the secretaries of the various
states. There shall be printed for the
use of members of the convention, one
copy each bound in leather, with the
name of the member stamped on It.
For the newspapers of the territory
there will be one copy each bound in
calf.
Chairman Wood of the finance com
mittee made a statement of the ex
penditures from the $100,000 appropria
tion to date and covering an estimate
of the expenses to be Incurred at the
close of the convention. According to
this statement there will be left after
the adjournment of the convention,
$46,949.03.
SENSATIONAL
STATEMENT
Stewart Tells ot Double Mur
der of Kibbe & Hiloot
LIFE SERVICE IS DEMANDED
Story Not Admitted as Evi
dence and Prisoner Was
Found Guilty Change of
Venue Is Wanted for the"
Trials to Follow.
Globe, Dec. 6. Murder In the first
degree and a sentence of life impris
onment was the verdict rendered by the
jury tonight in the case of Willfam
Stewart for the killing of Fred Kibbe.
John B. Goodwin, alias Steele, who
was convicted last week for the mur
der of Kibbe, will now be tried for kill
ing Alfred Hllpot, the prosecution hop
ing for the death penalty. The defense
will in the morning move for a change
of venue on the grounds that news
paper stories have worked up senti
ment against the indicted men.
The sensational development of the
closing day of the trial of William
Stewart, charged with the murder of
Fred Kibbe, was the makin? public
of a statement of Stewart concerning
the crime, which proved to be self
serving and was therefore not intro
duced into evidence by either the
prosecution or defense.
Stewart in his statement lays the
killing of both Kibbe and Hilpot on
John B. Goodwin, alias Steele, but con
fesses that Steele talked to him about
"plucking those two fellows off on the
evening before the murder at Tuttle's
station. Stewart claims, however, that
when the killing was done it paralyzed
him. He also confesses that Steele
planned several other murders
Stewart said in part: "Of course this
man Steele had spoken to me several
times about plucking off other parties
coming here (Tuttle's station) and
when he sprung this stunt on me Kibbe
and Hilpot were out hunting quail. I
itold him it was foolish. That
night we had supper and ate
together and were cooking and
talking like a family. It was very late
when this thing happened. We were
laughing and talking about happenings
in the grocery business. Steele was on
a bed. Then he got up suddenly and
went into the kitchen and there was a
shot fired from about the middle of
the door. I yas paralyzed. Hllpot
was in about the same fix. Kibbe was
shot first with a six-shooter. He never
moved or said a word, and I heard the
blood dripping down off the table.
Steele jumped past me (I was sitting
on a box) and commenced on Hilpot
with a rifle.
"Kibbe never fell off the chair; he
was braced, but Steele took him by
the legs and pulled him down. Hilpot
did not get up after the first, shot, but
I heard him say something. Hilpot
was shot four times once with a six
shooter and three times with a rifle,
and after he shot Hilpot Steele broke
the gun over his head and then turned
around and asked me what I was go
ing to do about it. He said people that
killed people would always be both
ered, but that It was like killing
animals to him.
As to Steele's reason for killing the
men. he said, according to Stewart's
story, that "we would kill those fel
lows, get away to Yellowstone park,
rob some conch, go to a big town and
have a big time."
Previous to the killing of Hilpot and
Kibbe. Stewart says that Steele wanted
him to help kill a party of Globe bank
ers. Stewart was to take the six-shooter
and shoot one and Steele was to
shoot the pther with a rifle. He also
wanted to kill Tuttle's boy. and M. A.
Conboy and wife, a druggist of Globe,
who were encamped about 300 yards
from Tuttle's station.
Stewart admits that he could hnve
given Steele the slip on their InO-mlle
fligh't but was afraid as Steele said the
circumstantial evidence of the fact that
the two men were killed with two dif
ferent guns would hang him (Stewart).
Stewart was once arrested in River
side. The two alleged murderers poldiered
at Fort Apache and Fort Tellowstone.
and Steele was in the Philippines two
years.
