DEVILS LAKE INTER-OCEAN, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15,1899
Brown & Co. a section of unim
proved land situate in township
156-62. Mr. Parry has been a
resident of Ramsey county for six
teen years, and his faith in the
fertility of our soil is shown in the
purchase he made this week. His
900-acre farm in DeGroat town
ship is one of the best in the
county. He has made a fortune
out of it, and he richly deserves all
the blessings that have been show
ered upon him. He is very enthu
siastic over the establishment of
the Gorder iron foundry and
machine shops at Devils Lake, and
thinks that the enterprise will be
of greater benefit to the city than
anything else it could have secured.
He thinks that with a flax fibre mill
located here Devils Lake will catch
the patronage of all the farmers for
many miles in every direction.
After the flour mill is again in run
ning order and the iron foundry
established, the business men
should make a strong effort to
secure a flax mill.

President McKinley's Message.
Following are the pertinent
points of President McKinley's
message to congress on Tuesday
last.
POWER TO SELL BONDS.
I urgently recommend that to
support the existing gold standard,
and to maintain "the parity in
value of the coins of the two metals
(gold and silver), and the equal
power of every dollar at all times
in the market and in the payment
of debts," the secretary of the
treasury be given additional power
and charged with the duty to sell
United States bonds, and to em
ploy such other effective means as
may be necessary to these ends.
COMBINES ARE TRUSTS.
It is universally conceded that
combinations which engross or
control the market of any parti
cular kind of merchandise or com
modity necessary to the general
community, by suppressing natural
and ordinary competition whereby
prices are unduly enhanced to the
general consumer, are obnoxious
not only to the common law but
also to the public welfare. There
must be a remedy for the evils in
volved in such organizations. If
the present law can be extended
more certainly to control or check
these monopolies or trusts, it
should be done without delay.
Whatever power the congress pos
sesses over this most important
subject should be promptly a
tained and asserted.
FUTURE OF CUBA.
New Cuba, yet to arise from the
ashes of the past, must need be
bound to us by ties of singular in
timacy and strength if its endur
ing welfare is to be assured.
Whether these ties shall be or
ganic or conventional, the des
tinies of Cuba are in some right
ful form and manner irrevocably
linked with our own but how and
how far is for the future to deter
mine in the ripeness of events.
Whatever be the outcome, we must
see to it that free Cuba be a reality,
not a hasty experiment bearing
within itself the elements of
failure.
PROMISE OF INDEPENDENCE.
It is enough to say that the
claim of the rebel leader—that he
was promised independence by
any officer of the United States in
return for his assistance—has no
foundation in fact, and is cata
gorically denied by the very wit
nesses who were called to prove it.
The most *the insurgent leader
hoped for when he came back to
Manila was the liberation of the
islands from Spanish control,
which they had been laboring for
years without success, to throw off.
FUTURE OF THE PHILIPPINES.
It does not seem desirable that I
should recommend, at this time, a
specific and final form of govern
ment for these islands. I have be
lieved that reconstruction should
not begin by the establishment of
one central civil government for
the islands, with its seat at Manila,
but rather that the work should be
commenced by building from the
bottom municipal governments,
and then provincial governments,
a central government to follow last.
FREE TRADE FOR PORTO RICO.
The markets of the United States
should be opened to her (Porto
Rico) products. Our plain duty is
to abolish all customs tariffs be
tween the United States and Porto
Rico, and give her products free
access to our markets.
He Fooled the Surgeons.

gist.

THE BLUFF AT BAYOMBONU.
We have hoard of bluffs at poker when whole
fortunes were at stake.
Where the object of the blutfor was to make a
stake or break:
Of the man who made two deuces win against a
royal flush,
Of how old "Majo" flxod "Spooiwnilyko" and
never felt to blush
We've heard stories told of Deadwood bluffs
that paralyzed the crowd
That played the #?amo at Bismarck when uo
limit was allowed
We have stood a^ast at hearing of the nerve
possessed by cracks
Who could make a bobtail Hush look like three
ares full on jacks
But the tales that deal with poker bluffs no
longer sound so strong*
Since we heard what Muuro did to them in
taking Hayon bong.
They will tell you out in Boise of the night.
when old Jack Hays
Won the mine called "Lovely Mary" by the
makingof a raise
Of six thousand on a pair of fours, against a
king iuartetto—
And content that never human made such wild
and wnoly bet
Down the rivor there's a yarn about a man from
New Orleaus.
Who won a fortune standing pat on an ace
against four queens
Of how a Fargo banker won ton thousand—in
the days
When the lied washed out all records made iu
queer old-fashioned ways—
But those yarns of high class blutllng are no
longer worth a song—
We have heard how Munro bluff'odand won the
town of Bayotn bong.
He had no standiug record of a knowledge of
the game
As a bet its almost even that he never played
the same
But he hot a pile of Yankee nerve and he acted
like a man
Who had to make a winning, and he banked 011
Uncle Sam:
He made his stack of rookies look like thirty
thousand men.
His deuces loomed like aces and he bet them
there and then
He took the limit of the game and he set a
faster pace
Than is quite within the power of the Filippino
rare
Now all other featsof blutling in another class
heloiii
Since we heard how Munro bluffed and won the
town of Uayomhong.

Little
Pimples Turn
to Cancer.
Cancer often results from an im
purity in the blood, inherited from
generations back. Few people are en
tirely free from some taint in the blood,
and it is impossible to tell when it will
break out in the form of dreaded Can
cer. What has appeared to be a mere
pimple or scratch has developed into
the most malignant Cancer.
"I had a severe Cancer which was at first
only a few blotches, that I thought would
soon pass away. I wag
treated by several able
physicians, but In spite
of their efforts the Can
cer spread until my con
dition became alarming.
After many months ol
treatment and
growing
steadily worse. I de
cided to try S. 8. 8.
which was so strongly
recommended. The first
bottle produced an Im
provement. I continued
the medicine, and In
four months the last llt
tle scab dropped off.
Ten years have elapsed,
and not a siga of the disease has returned."
B. F. WILLIAMS,
Gillsburg, Miss.
It is dangerous to experiment with
Cancer. Tne disease is beyond the skill
of physicians. 8. S. S. is the only cure,
because it is the only remedy which
goes deep enough to reach Cancer.
Blood
(Swift's Specific) is the only blood
remedy guaranteed Purely Vegetable.
All others contain potash and mer
cury, the most dangerous of minerals.
