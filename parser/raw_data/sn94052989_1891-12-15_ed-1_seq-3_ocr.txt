FAIR SAN LEANDRO.
"Where the llonie-Seekers Go for
Comfort and Quiet.
A Prosy Little Town Built Up in the Kidst
of Fruit-Orchards -Garden Sass-Some of
Its Good Things Talked About.
Bill Nye, the humorist, was very much
Impressed with San Francisco Bay. One
day whiln crossing it he suddenly inter
rupted a long dreamy silence by remarking
dryly to bis companion, "There's one thing
like about this bay; there ain't no flies
on it." ■
This little incident- recalled a day or
two ago during a visit to San Leandrn, an
enchanting little hamlet on the other side of
tho bay, where, so it is fabled, the Olym
pian gods gathered ambrosial nectar to re
fresh their immortal steeds. A newspaper
man was strolling up and down Its beau
tiful avenues, taking in the sights. Every
few rods he noted small gatherings of
natives (not N. S. G. W.) lounging lazily
around, discussing, perhaps, the President's
message, or, more likely, Mr. Blame's cor
respondence wit'i Crispi. Much to his sur
prise he could not understand a word that
was said, except occasionally something
that sounded like "lauialt1," and lie mar
veled thereat. It was deemed the proper
tiling to engage some of these ruddy sous
iv conversation. They might impart some
valuable ii'eas and assist the man of news
in obtaining the right sort of information to
write up the town. What appeared the
most approachable group was approached.
The leader of the conversation, or more
properly the autocrat, was standing, and,
as the intruder drew near, gave him a some
what Indifferent but attentive ear.
" This is a nice little town you've got
here," remarked the man of write-ups, with
a copyrighted smile.
" Hell ida boot I" was the prompt and
confidfbt reply. "No flies onna dthese
town."
San Leandro Is certainly a most beautiful
spot, and fully merits the pride of her in
habitants. People in search of
riKSIUABLE I! M: 9
Will travel much further and fare much
worse. It is not a place that must be made;
it is already made. The pioneer's work is
done, and has been well done. It simply re
mains for the home-seeker to take posses
sion. Additional beautifying, of course,
will not be forbidden, but if another flower
or shrub were never planted, still the place
would be a fit übude fur the most romantic
fancy.
The plr.ee has It; objections; if it had not,
it would hava no place in this troublous
world. Bat beside its many virtues the
objections fade into comparative Insignifi
cance. San Leaudro has a future, That
also can be said of other places, no doubt.
But San Leandro has something more than
a future, which, if pictured now, would
read like a fairy tale, or an improbable ro
mance.
One has only to familiarize himself with
San Francisco and surroundings to appre
ciate the possibilities of San Leandro. The
gieat metropolis is bounding, ahead with
gigantic strides. Each successive year her
industrial marts ore swelled by thousands
and thousands more. While her domains
are abundantly ample for the increase, the
. rigors of her climate drive a very large per
centage to seek shelter under a more con
genial sun. The law trade winds that sweep
the great peninsula may inspire no fear or
dread in the man of business who is min
tiling dally in thu activities of commer
cial life, but when the bustle is
. put aside for the peace and quiet
■of home life, then he desires above
all other things to be comfortable.
He likes to feel that he can sit down in the
summer sunshine, without an overcoat on,
or eat his evening meal without th« ac
companiment of n roaring fire. Again,
thousands of the surging multitude desire
cheap houses. Title, they can skirt the
outer districts of San Francisco and find
■ plenty of lots
FOR $25 A FIIOXT FOOT,
And they will rind also that it is just as
completely in Nature's embrace as the sum
mit of Mount Shasta, and almost as un
available for any purpose, so far as accessi
bility and communication are concerned.
And, still again, a Very large proportion of
city people desire the quiet ai:d retirement
of subui ban life for the sake of their fami
lies. A large city is nut a desirable place In
which to rear and educate the young. Not
only is the social atmosphere bad, but the
physical atmosphere is even worst).
These are the chief reasons for the popu
larity of subuiban homes in the vicinity of
San Francisco. The first thing to be con
sidered is ease and readiness of communi
cation; next, the attractiveness and ad
vantages possessed by the locality. Both
of these questions satisfactorily answered,
the success of the future is assured. l£
those and other much more trying ques
tions can be answered mote satisfactorily
than by San Leauilro, that place-should
step quickly to the front and demand the
palm.
San Leandro Is located about eight miles
south of the center of Oakland, and is
reached by the same line of railroad that
penetrates that entire district between the
Pay and the high ridge of hills to ttie east.
It lies on what to the eye is apparently li>w
and level ground, but, as a physical fact, is
fuity-nve feet above the tides, and a part
of the almost imperceptible slope from the
bay to the base ot the lulls. The. slightest
undulation is hardly discernible in any di
rection for miles around, and the vision is
almost unobstructed along the avenue) till
the view is lost in the distance.
The incorporated portion of ths town is
about a mile and a half square, and when
THE LAST CENSUS
Was taken contained a population of 2014.
II has, of course, very considerably in
creased since then, and besides a goodly
portion of the town has settled outside tbs
corporate limits. So it will not be enlarg
ing upon the trutu to put the entire popula
tion at 2500, or possibly 2800.
Although the t inn is old it seems to pos
sess surprislnely few of the objectionable
features of old towns. Its original geog
raphers must nave bad an eye far into the
future when they laid it out. Its avenues,
instead of being narrow, stingy and irregu
lar, are broad And even, and do matter
where one stands the same impression pre
vails. It was not an attempt to make
streets aud save laud; it was a very success
ful attempt to make a beautiful town with
broad and majestic avenues regardless of
laud.
Too often it is the case In country towns
that the streets are neglected—have a gen
eral uncomely and untidy appearance—and
the first impression the visitor cets is that
the inhabitants are sluggards. Ramshackle
fences lop and stagger on both sides, side
walks are nothing but cowpaths through
weeds, sand or mud ; streets left exactly as
nature made them—ungraded, irregular, full
of ruts and hummocks, and a conslaut men
ace to passing vehicle).
How different in San Leanlro. Every
street and avenue in that delectable little
hamlet 1* as smooth and even as a race
course. The roadways are all graded and
macadamized with as much care and skill as
an exajtiug
CITT GOVERNMENT
Would require. The sidewalks nre from
twelve to intern feet in width and equally
well graded, Both sides of nearly ail the
avenues are lined with stately gum trees or
poplars. There is hardly a &nabby fence
in the town, and the class of dwellings is a
long way above the country average.
A great many of the little homes planted
there are positively elegant, They are in
most cases the residences of San Francisco
business men, who found there all that
could be desired In a suburban home, and
have expended all their energies in making
them pleasant and attractive. Many of the
extensive fruit-growers of the surrounding
country have also built charming homes
here and there, all giving to the town the
general air of comfort and luxury.
It cannot be said that San Leandro is a
madly enterprising place. Indeed, the very
reverse is more nearly the truth, and the
neighboring towns are much given to mak
ing uncomplimentary remarks about their
fair but indolent sister on that account.
After all, such a state of things is not to be
wondered at, and is nothing unusual. A
suburban town that really has no other pur
pose but to provide homes is very rarely a
place for business. People don't go there
for business, and would rather have the
business transacted elsewhere. The fact
that the place has pride enough to keep her
self looking so neat and trim all the time Is
almost enough said in her favor.
Society is of the very best. Besides the
better class of residents, who have all their
Interests there, are a great many thrifty
fruit-growers, who have extensive interests
In the surrounding country, and about USO
families, the heads of which do
BUSINESS
In San Francisco. This fools up something
like 300 families, and a "better quality could
not be desired. The school is large and
well patronized, having eight teachers ami
accommodating between 300 and 400 pupils.
The urgent need of greater facilities has
already been mot by voting $5000 to build
a roomy addition. Three churches also
iidorn the town, and their pastor* do not.
teach morals to empty benches. Better evi
dences of a healthy toue of society could
hardly be desire I.
It has been said in more or less derision
that San Leandro Is a Portuguese colony.
The fact Is the great bulk of extensive gar
dening uod much of the email fruit industry
in and surrounding the place is carried on
by Italians and Portuguese who have set
tled in the place. They are a thrifty lot,
• much more peaceable than the tough
native element, aid very largely in
keeping up the neat appearance of
town, and, as a general thing, are all pro
ducers of some kind or other. During the
dull seasons they lounge around the town
more or less, and as they are about the only
purely gtay-at-home|. ilass this accounts for
the fact that a stranger may go from end to
end in the daytime aud not hear a dozen
words in English. The time to see San
Leaudro at her best Is in the evening, when
all her people are at home and there issume
interesting social event on hand. The day
may have reminded one of Sunday in a
country church-yard, but the scene will
have been greatly transformed louz before
midnight
There are no hygienic objections to San
Leandro. A healthier place would be
HAItl) TO FIND.
Whenever it shall become necessary to
drain the town the best opportunities are
afforded. The elevation is sufficient to give
a good fall, and no engineering difficulties
whatever stand in the way. The water
supply could not be more perfect and com
plete. San Leandro is located at the base
of the hills in which Lake Chabnt nestles,
and its jure crystal water flows in iron
arteries all over the town with a pressure
of 300 feet elevation. Fire, hydrants aro set
at sate distances and a weil-organizcd hose
company gives the town absolute protection
against lire. A fire engine, indeed, Would
be a hindrance. The pressure is naturally
greater than an engine could give, and by
simply attaching the hose to the hydrant a
force is obtained that puffs out a lire in
no time. Generous use of this line water
supply accounts, too, lor the large number
of beautiful yards and lawns. I
The country surrounding San Leandro,
and of which she originally formed a part,
has been noted since the early days of Cali
fornia for Its wonderful truit-producing
qualities. There is no better soil. It will
grow anything luxuriantly that can be pro
duced In tho semi-tropics. It has become
actually famous for us garden "truck," the
abundance and excellence of which has
been for many years the boast of the San
Francisco and Oakland markets. Cherries,
apricots, pi tines, pears, peaches, almonds,
raisins and grapes are rais-d in wonderful
abundance, and even inside the town limits
are still a great many beautiful orchards.
The chief industry all summer long is of
course the fruit harvest, triul no one can
realize
ITS MAGNITUDE
Without having witnessed it. Car-load after
car-luad leaves the station daily forEaßtern
markets. New York, Chicago and New Or
leans, and so well established is the reputa
tion of San Leandro fruit in those markets
that the supply is never equal to the de
mand. San Francisco gets but very little
of the best products ot this fertile country.
The one question of great importance to
San Leandro is that of communication.
When it is assured equal privileges with
Oakland. Alameda and Berkeley the race
will be no uncertain one. At present but
seven trains connect the town daily with
San Francisco. This affords all perhaps that
is needed for a certain class, but it does not
begin to meet the general wish. When the
number has been doubled, from 500 to 800
will take advantage of them instead of 200,
and a still greater number will increase the
traffic In like proportion. For every addi
tional train the value of property increases
10 per cent, and in some cases the mere pros
pect of increased traveling conveniences
puts new "tiffenina in the prices. A short
time ago 11. W. Meek, a wealthy resident of
Hay wards, obtained a franchise to build an
electric railroad from Brooklyn Station,
East Oakland, to Haywards, a distance of
sixteen miles, and running ri^ht through
San Liandro. At a single bound
property in that town went Dp 33% percent.
it is believed the road will be running iv
less than a year, ami then values will take,
another jump, for it will bring Oakland
right into the town, and, to a certain extent,
overcome the drawbacks of the seven-train
limit. The power-house of th's system will
be erected on the Warner tract, just north
Of the town,.
Two fairly good-sized manufacturing es
tablishments are already located iv San
Leandro, and others are promised when the
season is ripe. The Bis: Agricultural
Works give employment to 100 men, and
the Hopper Agricultural Works employ
about forty men.
One of the excellent features of San Lean
dro industry is the farming of small tracts.
Many a family is well supported on the
profits of five and ten acre tracts, all turned
to fruit and vegetable raising.
The town boasts of a fairly good town
hall, a weekly paper, two public plazas and
two or three hotels.
PROVING CP TOO HIGH.
Vnclo Sam May Drop the City Cemetery
Suit.
The suit of the United States against the
city and county for the condemnation of
fifty-four acres of the City Cemetery will be
called to-day in the United States Circuit
Court, but t.'ie Government will likely ask a
continuance. District Attorney Garter
thinks there is a movement cv foot to prove
the value of the land to a much higher
figure than it is worth.
He said yesterday lie heard that the city
would try to realize $0000 nn acre, which he
claims is a price bo exorbitant that it is
absurd. Iv view of this movement he may
ask a continuance that he may fortify him
self with the figures of the ex..ct value of
that and contiguous lands;.
"There am uo graves on the land to be
condemned," he Bald, "and I do Dot see why
the cily and county should bo alter double
the amount the land is really worth. I be
lieve in the payment of a just price. Be
sides, it will be of advantage to this com
munity to have the land condemned, as it
will mean the expenditure of thousands of
dollars to built the fortifications to be
erected and thousands more periodically to
keep them equipped. If they prove up the
land too high, the amount at the disposition
of the Government will prove inadequate
and I will have to move a dismissal of the
case."
DESPONDENCY AND DEATH.

About 1:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Mrs. Menie!z, the proprietor of a 1 .dging
home at 331% Bush 6treot, went into ona of
the rooms fur the purpose of cleaning it, but
was horrified to find the inmate, Julius
Strutz, fully dressed and dead upon the bed.
She summoned tho Coroner and the body
was taken to the Mnrgue.
It was le.irned thai the deceased was 50
year* of age, a native of Germany and had
been connected with the liquor tradr. nut
for two months had not been employed. It
w;vs also learned that a friend, Captain SJar

been helping .Strutz financially foi some time.
He wna despondent on account of bt-iu^

an end of his existence. In the watcr
bucket in tne room was found a pharmacy

Heary Output of Sugar In California.
Bounty l p ii.
The entire siu.«r output for California for
this year amounts, according to the com
piled figures of the Internal K-veoue De
partment, to 6,670,138 pounds. Tills is con
siderably larger than any previous year's
Sroiluct and under the bounty clause ot the
[cKinley bill, which proviaos for the pnv
ment of two cents n pound, ths producers
will realize $161,402 70.
This is quue >n item in the way of liqui

above figures show the actual amount of
suzar claiified nnd the bounty to be paid,
they do not include the syrups and molas

bo kept over until next year to give them
time to precipitate their sugar. This will
be a vast saving and will increase the fig

SEA AND SHORE.
Loss of the K. M. S. Moselle Near
Colon.
Attempt at Suicide—Fast Steam Service—No
tice to Mariners—A Law point for
Shipping Men.
The loss of the R. M. S. Moselle, near
Colon, in the early part of November was
reported at the time in The Call, together
with the fact th.it every one oil board
except the captain was saved. By the
steamer San Juan from Panama some ad
ditional facts regarding the wreck of this
fine steamer have been learned. The Mo
selle was on her way from Port Simon to
Colon and struck on the rocky coast during
a dark and stormy night. All efforts to
keep her off the rocks proved futile because
the heavy sea lifted the (loomed ship higher
and blither on the rocks every minute.
When daylight came, Captain Howsell cave (
orders to lower tho boats and saw his pas
sengers safely in them.
lie then ordered the officers and crew to
follow, but he himself refused to leavo the
vessel. Tho heavy laden boats reached the
wharves at Colon without an accident, and
then the crew turned their attention to save
the captain if possible. The steamer Avon
arrived in Colon durum the day aud pro
ceeded to the scone of the wreck. She re
mained by the stranded vessel for some
time, but as no sigu of the captain could be
seen she returned to Colon. The crew kept
up a close watch along the shore, and held
themselves in readiness to assist Captain
Kowsell should he attempt to reach the shore
by swimming, as the sea nnsfartoo heavy to
attempt to reach the vessel with a boat.
.Late in the evening, however. Captain
Ki'wsell was leen standing on the rail with
a life-preserver around him.
He waved his hand to the watchers nn
shore and then sprang into the sea. He
made little headway toward the shore, how
ever, on account of the strong undertow,
and at last P. Miller, fifth officer of the ill
fated steamer, lastnued a rope to his waist
and boldly sprang into the sea. Miller was
a fine swimmer and rapidly nude his way
towaid the struggling man, and would have
reached him, but Captain ltowsell was seen
to throw up his hands and disappear be
neath the naves. Miller was hauled back
to shore more dead than alive. He was
badly cut and bruised by Contact with the
sharp rock*, and it is thought that Bowsell
was fatally injured by being dashed against
the uuseeu rocks.
AX INSANE PASSENGER.
Among the passengers from Eureka yes
terday on the steamer Los Angeles was J.
C. Holtz of Eureka. No one noticed any
thing strange in his actions until trie steam
pr had been several hours at sea and was off
Fort Bragg, Then without warning he
walked to the rail and leaped Into the sea.
The cry of "Man overboard 1" was raised
and the vessel stopped. A lifeboat was low
ered and rowed toward the struggling man,
who was a first-class swimmer ami whs using
all his skill to koep on the surface of the
water. To the credit ot the crew Holtz was
picked up within nine minutes from tho time
he sprang over the rail. lie was returned
to the steamer, and after he had been fur
nished with a change of clothing waslocked
up in one of the state-rooms and kept there
until the vessel reached this city. A search
of his clothes brought to light a biuli-book.
Showing that he had S3OO to his credit.
After being locked up he became very vio
lent, and as soon as the steamer reached her
dock be was turned over to a police officer
and taken to the Home for Inebriates.
Holtz is a painter by trade and lias lived in
Eureka for a number of years.
Outside the heads the weather yesterday
was hazy with a northeast wind, sixteen
miles an hour. The barometer stood 30.22.
NEW AND GRAPHIC.
The Hydographic Om'ce in this city has
received a new and graphic method of work
ing out azimuths and hour angles, by which
all use of tallies of logarithms and calcula
tion is rendered unnecessary—.1 pencil aud
parallel rule being all that is required,
tiding the latitude, declination and altitude
the azimuth Is promptly found, and by the
use of the same functions nn other lines the
hour angle. G. \V. Litllebales, the author,
who is the assistant in charge of the
Division of Chart Construction, has spent
much time in the production of this chart,
ami vouches for its accuracy within the
necessary limits of exactness requiied and
possible at sea. It will certainly be appre
ciated by the uavieator us a si.uple method.
It is unofficially reported that after the
first of the year the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company will establish a fast steam service
between tills port and Panama, touching
only at the principal ports en route, dis
patching a steamer from San Francisco on
the sth, 15th and 25th of each month. On
the 15th ii steamer touching at all ports will
also b« dispatched.
It is expected that the steamer Sunol will
bo Ei\en the berth at Washington-street
Wharf heretofore occupied by the steamer
Donahue. The change will be appreciated
by those who patronize th« Stinol, and will
result in an increase of business for that
steamer. It is also reported that the Donahue
will receive a thorough overhauling, and be
again Used as a passenger boat.

WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME?
Ship-owners and captains are very anx
ious regarding the outcome of the effort to
make the ship Undaunted liable for waves
of the three seamen who died while the ves
sel was in Itio Janeiro. Captain (Lewis
claims that the contract ended with death,
and ho Is willing to pay the amount due up
to th it time, as has been the custom at this
port In such case. The law relating to the
subject is nut very clearly defined, and the
Federal courts in Massachusetts and also In
North Carolina many years ago decided that
the death of the man ended the contract,
while a court in Pennsylvania decided
that the heirs of the dead seaman are enti
tled to receive full pay to the end of the voy
age, as if the man had lived to be paid off.
As the amount in this case ii quite a large
one, the case will have to be decided by the
Circuit Court, and clearance papers cannot
be issued to Captain Lewis until the decis
ion is rendered, in spite of the fact that his
ship will be ready for sea on Thursday.
The Noonday Ri.ck bell buoy has gone
adrift, but will be replaced at the earliest
date practicable, when due notice will be
published of the fact. In the meantime
navigators should be extremely cautious in
approaching the vicinity of this rock, which
lies hidden, with nothing to indicate its
position.
Captain Minor, formerly of the ship Olym
pla, has been appointed to command the
bark Wakofield, vice Captain Howes, who
was severely injured by a cable-car a few
days ago.

The British ship Ii -nlarig has accepted a
charter to load lumber from this port to
Callao. She arrived here from Dunkirk,
France, under charter to l>ad wheat back at

" When the election is over next month.
Baril!:i9 will make an extended tour abroad,
feaiing personal consequences should hs re
main at home. His solo desire now is to see
a man elected as his successor who will pro
tect his. interests and save, his ill-gotten
gains from reconfiseation. Barrios is op
posed to the present system of official rob-
Dery in Guatemala, and will hold every
man's propel ty Inviolate, aud so Barillas in
dorses him.
"The election will bo a farce-comedy. The
only votes ca--t will be by the soldiers, who
will be largely Inlluenenced by their officers,
with whom they are 00 the most intimate
terms. Few of the civilians pay any atten
tion to the contest, but the alcalde of each
district will gravely prepare a bogus le
port, giving the number of votes which he
is pleased to declare have been cast for the
enndidatp he favors.
"liarilhis has the revision of this list, and
will doubtless remedy any defects in the
election returns, even supplying nnssinc
votes, should they be necessary for an elec
tion. The choice of a President by topular
vote in Guatemala is rather a hollow
honor."
MINISTERIAL UNIONS.
Kirn, 11 Ira I. ICanltin ou Individual
Responsibility.
Tho Congregational ministers yesterday
a'ternoon listened to a lay sermon by
Deacon Ira P. liaukin ol tho First Congre
gational Church on tho subject of "The In
dividual Responsibilities of Church Mem
bers," in which he held that greater cau
tion should be exercised in the admission
of members to the congregation*, and when
once iv they should bo impressed with the
fact that they were individual workers in
the iuterests of the church.
The President reported that tlie commit
tee which was appointed to confer with
similar committees from other ministerial
bodies in regard to a mass-meeting on be
half of the sufferers frMn the recent earth
quake, in Japan had been unaMe to secure
the protiosed conference, lie said it was
probable the idea of the proposed luass
uieeting nnuld be abandoned.
A communication was received from the
Chicago Congregational Clul) asking that
the San Francisco soctety join it iv a me
morial to Congress on behalf of the Euro
pean convention for the repression of slav
ery in Africa, the United States nnd France
being tho only nations which havo refused
to join the convention. Their refusal is
based on the ground that th ■ leading coun
tries «f Kurope desire to parcel out Africa
among themselves. The communication
was referred to the officers of the society
with power to act.
At a meeting of the Methodist ministers,
the President, Upv. G. W. lieaUy, read n
paper on the subject of psychology, in which
he considered the question of the relation of
hypnotism to the operation of the Holy
Spirit, and held that all who possessed such
influence should use it iv tho interests of
religion. The contents of tbe paper
were discussed by Key. Messr*. Slmonds,
Buck, Hammond. Wylhe and liovanl. U«v.

KECKLE.SS DRIVING.
Justice Cook Champions the redestri
»llh' Uißllts.
On the sth of November a coal-dealer
named Giovanni drove atom; East street,
near the Clay-street Wharf, but handled his
horses so negligently that they knocked
down a ship-builder named John Krlckson.
The latter was badly hurt and brought
suit In the Justices' Couit to recover $299
damages and costs. He claimed that !>y rea
son of his injuries he was unable to work
and that his wages amounts! to $30 per
week when be w;is employed. The eas«
was trleii before Justice Cook, who decided
that the coal-dealer should pay 9250 for his
carelessness.
In announcing his decision he sail:
"There appears 10 liea large ciuss of drivers
in this city who think the great thorough
fares ate speed tracks. They drive rapidly
and heedlessly hloiik the streets and if they
strike a pedestr lan that is his fault. It has
come to pats that a man takes his life in his
hand whenever he attempts to cross tlio
streets on which traffic is brisk."

PEACH JiOOT BOKEKS.
They Are Found In an Imported Lot of
Kansas Trees.
Alexander Craw, the quarantine officer of
the State Board of Horticulture, has re
turned from an important mission in the
interests of the peach-growers. Lately there
were received two car-loads of peach trees
at Auburn, Placer County, from Kansas.
They hnd a peculiar appearance, »nd an in
vestigation showed them to be infected with
"peach root borers," a pest that is unknown
here. Mr. Craw ordered the trees in quar
antine until they could be returned to Kan
sas. In speaking of the affair Mr. Craw
said: "Nearly all the pests now in the or
chards in California have been imported. If
the system of quarantining and returning
ha 1 been adopted from the first they would
not now be ravaged by so many kinds of
pests." >
A Friendly Tight.
Henry Wohlken, a saloon-keeper at Ninth
and lirannan streets, and Christopher ilnff
nian, a small grocery kecpur at Fourth and
liinnnnn streets, were before Judge Joach
-1 ins. :i on the charge of battery. They had
battered eacli other because Wohlken would
not accept money for drinki ordered by
Hoffman. Thoy said to the Court that they
were the best of friend's, but tho court's
disapproval of their method of showing
friendship wa* so atrong that only the regu
lar sentence was ueedi'd to cement it.

COUNTY INQUISITORS.
The Lii<e Gnnid Jury Will Meet
To-D;iy ;tml Report.
Presiding Judie Wallace of tlie Superior
Court says he will not urm-a relie:iri»^ of
the case of Elwm <1 Brnner, in which the
Supreme Court decided tlie Graud Jury in
valid, lie states that as his lerm as Presid
ing Judge will close tl.is month, another
Grand Jury will nut be drawn until after the
first of the year, wheu his successor will be
elected. Speaking of the Supreme Court
decision be Mid:
"I notice th;it some nf the authorities
quoted by the Supreme Court were written
by Justice Khodea and myself, but evidently
the Supreme Court h;is not Interpreted them
as wo understood tliPin, but that of course
inui.r- no uilTerence now.
"in this whole matter I have not been
animated by any partisan spirit or motive.
Isimpiy wished to carry out the law as I
thought it to be and »till think. I have bean
subjected t> attack for what I have done,
but I presume that was to have beeu ex
pected.
"I have no hesitancy in telling you that i
certainly shall uot ask for a rehearing.
Ihii m itter lias b"Pn heard so much in nne
form and another that a rehearing would
not, in all likelihood, alter the conclusion
that I believe the Supreme Court has hon
estly reached. If it wen 1 a private matter of
my own 1 should probably ask for a rehear
ing."
The Grand Jury—those men who composed
the invalid body—will meet at 3 o'clock this
afternoon, fcum a brief report for presenta
tion to Judge Wallace and disband as soon
as possible thereafter.
A Vigorous Lodger.
Mrs. Marie Guichiirneaud, a lodging
house keeper at 513 Howard street, entered
Warrant Clerk l'aucliosi's office yesterday
with her eye full of ire and her mouth full
of lamentation;, due to the treatment she
claimed to have received at the hands of one
ol her lodgers, a Mrs. Britton. She said
that the lodger mentioned is delinquent in
her room-rent, and on being requested to
vacate, smashed her in the face, threw a
bucket of slops over her, threatened to
throw her over the banisters, and otherwise
maltreated her.

Acme Blacking retails at 20c.
