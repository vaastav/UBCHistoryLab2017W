OUR HPADSTRONCi FRF.SIDFNT
ln the election campaign of 1904 th»
Republican* ridiculed the Democratic
ldea that Theodore Roosevelt's head
strong character would make him I
dangerous chief executive. Now there
is .-i commotion In tho Republican camp
because the dangeroiis characteristic",
pointed out liv the Democrats, are
rapidly developing.
AA A speech delivered 'ln New Tort last
Wednesday night by Ellhu Root, sec
retary of state, I* regifrded as a pre
arranged outline of a position that the
president will take In » special message
to congress which will be submitted
next Tuesday. Mr. Root Is recognized
as the personal exponent Of the presi
dent in matters of public concern.' In
tho New York speech Mr. Root took
i n, Minced, Minced ground In favor of federal
centralization, directly antagonising
both the letter and spirit of the federal
constitution In regard to reserved rights
of the. states.
Now the report Is allowed to leak out
ln Washington, evidently with the ob
ject of further paving the way for the
president's purpose, thai most decided
ground in favor of centralization will
bc taken In the message to be sent to
congress next Tuesday. It Is given out,
as a foretaste of what Is coming, that
"the president will no longer occupy any
middle ground as to the right of the
federal government to be supreme In
all matters In which the affairs of
foreign countries or the welfare of the
American people are concerned."
The stand thus to be formally taken
by the president Is In line with the
a."tonii-liiii^ intlmaion In his annual
message concerning the Japanese
school question at San Francisco.
Therein he declared, substantially, that
he would use the whole power of the
army and navy, If necessary, to over
come state opposition to the policy of
the federal government.
How far the president may go In
maintaining the position now ascribed
to him is a question yet to be de
veloped. It Is evident, however, that
he is firmly committed to a policy
directly In opposition to article 10 of
the constitutional amendments and to
all the early traditions of the republic.
The underlying idea of the president,
in his conclusion that the federal con
stitution is obsolete in respect to the
abridgement of federal authority, is
that the very foundation of the repub
lic Is a misfit in this progressive age.
In this respect our impulsive chief
executive differs radically from the
sentiment in Webster's impressive ad
monition: "Cling to the constitution as
the shipwrecked mariner clings to the
last plank when night and the tempest
close around him."
In a general sense, perhaps no on a
will question the declaration by Sec
retary Root that "no state has a right
to exist unto itself alone," even as no
individual has a right to live unto him
self alone. But these are questions of
moral obligation, rather than of legal
cognizance. To aay, at this late day,
that the federal government must have
the power to regulate the school sys
tem of San Francisco or of South Caro
lina; that the federal government may
go into the different states and see that
similar laws are enacted to meet dis
similar conditions and dissimilar peo
ple, is to uproot the genius of American
Institutions. What Massachusetts may
determine to be right and proper with
respect to her philanthropies and char
ities, for instance, may not be forced
upon Illinois or Louisiana at the dic
tum of any power— short of "the man
on horseback," and when he shall come
the trouble will be of an all-pervading
nature.
It is true that the American people
have, since 1861, been pushed, shoved,
persuaded and cajoled very far away
from the old and exacting doctrine of
Btate's rights. Much has been con
ceded in that direction, but the people
generally— north, south, east and west
—will rise en masse against the Roose
veltlan idea that states have no rights
not concsded to them by the federal
government.
California Republicans, particularly,
are not. in present mood to ridicule
Democrats for pointing out the danger
incident to the headstrong and self
sufficient character of Theodore Roose
velt.
•CROWNER'S QUEST"
At the conference of county officials
ami members of the county delegation
in the next legislature the district at
torney paid this compliment to the
coroner's office: "A coroner's verdict
bind* id cue; it cannot be used in
court and might just us well be written
In mud." Hence the district attorney
thinks "the jury should be abolished
and upon the ooroner alone Hhould rest
all the responsibility for his findings. "
And in relation to the functions of the
coroner we are told that "there is no
more need that he should be a doctor
than that he should be a carpenter."
The "crowner's quest," as an inquest
by the coroner was originally called,
has long been a butt of ridicule In Log
Angeles. The extra-Judicial character
of U>« "quest," which has brought it
Into disrepute here und elsewhere, leads
the lexicographer to say that the
pluasc "crowner's quest law Is often
umil bumoroiwly, implying irregular
pro< . ,liuv, or disregard of the settled
Cormi of law."
The procedure of the coroner and
his Juries In this county has often been
in disregard of law and everything else
except i he whim of the boss of the
quest. In the methods employed there
appears to have been no material
change since the office originated in
the musty past of English official pro
cedure. The office seems to have been
ridiculed even in England, hundreds of
years . ago, , as . Shakespeare gays in
Hamlet: "The crowner hath sate on
her, ami finds it Christian burial."
The Los Angeles county coroner
elect, who makes an early showing of
. l.uiu.le for conducting his office on
machine principles strictly, says that
extra help I* needed to operate the
■ runnel's bunlnegs and accordingly he
"would like another clerk and a detec

tlve to gather evidence in certain
ceases."c cases."
The district attorney's suggestion Is
well so far as It goes, to the effect
that tho "coroner's Jury should bo
abolished." To that should.be added,
"and also the coroner." If the crown
er's quest la only a Judicial farce, why
not give to the county health officer,
or some other functionary the Job of
looking into questionable causes of
death? •

MAKING A PRECEDPNT
ln considering the present applica
tion for subway privileges the fact
should bo kept In mind that the basic
lssues Involved are of much broader
•COPS than the schemes in hand. De
cisions arrived nt In the present case
will establish precedents for future
guidance. it. Is of the highest Import
ance, therefore, that the Initial points
which are now bones of contention shall
bo settled once for nil.
Tho Hnrrlman BUbway proposition
hns opened the ayes of the whole com
munity to n situation timt discerning
Individuals, had already considered,
That is. the cprtajnty that the city's
expansive pressure northward and
westward would necessitate the use of
a subway system of transit. What We
call the hill districts are a barrier to
communication between tho central
portions of the tity an.l the suburbs
beyond the hills. Tho logical remedy
for a metropolitan city, as demonstrat
ed elsewhere, is to penetrate the hills
by tunnels for subway transit.
The Harrlman project now outlined
will prove to be the leader of other
projects Intended for other lines of
transit. There are no engineering diffi
culties to deter promoters of similar
enterprises, and it Is only a wonder
that the subway Idea was not reduced
to practice at an earlier date.
In fact, the system of subways now
proposed by Mr. Harriman Is not a
matter of great magnitude as viewed
from his standpoint of a railway
builder. The tunneling- involved In the
plans now under consideration Is
trivial In comparison with some of the
stupendous undertakings in steam rail
way construction.
It is well to remember, aIRO. that the
time may not be far distant when the
subway plan will be necessary for rapid
transit through the city in sections out
side of the hill districts. Surface tran
sit has reached the limit of speed, as
the frequent accidents resulting from
comparatively fast schedules clearly
prove. Even In many of the prosent
outskirts of the City the time required
for passage to and from the central
part Is a barrier to improvement. That
drawback is aggravated by every addi
tional step farther from the center.
New York has solved the problem of
rapid transit by the use of subways,
and other leading American cities are
following the lead of the metropolis.
Loa Angeles Is making a start in solv
ing its problem similarly. The elevated
railway plan, which New York and
Chicago have tried thoroughly, proves
to be inadequate to the requirements of
a great and rapidly growing city.
It would be safe to predict that when
the Peace and Commerce exposition oc
curs In this city in 1915 there will be
systems of subway transit not only
through the hill district but under the
river to the rapidly populating sections
of Boyle Heights and also to the dis
tant suburbs of western and south
western Los Angeles.
Now thnt Ryan, Guggenheim and
Rockefeller are making demands for
concessions in the Congo country, we
are becoming aroused to the horrors
existing by virtue of King Leopold. It
takes lots of money to wake us up, but
when we are thoroughly awakened it re
quires a lot more to head us off.
THE DIVORCE HABIT STRONG
If Mrs. Herbert Parsons wants any
further argument to sustain her ad
vocacy of rotation in marriage the
Timni family of this city will furnish
abundant material. George, Albeit,
Frederick, Hans, Katie and Lena
Timm, brothers and sisters, all have
been married and In the divorce courts
within the last five yearß.
To cap the climax George Timin,
who obtained his decree last May, was
married last night to Uertha Timm,
the divorced wife of his brother Al
bert, who lives In lowa, and was di
vorced In June.
The marriage of George to the di
vorced wife of his brother, Albert, was
an event In which all the Timms took
interest. There was no rancor and no
ill feeling. Everybody congratulated
everybody else, and the bride kissed
her hand to her former husbund, who,
by the second marriage, became her
brother-in-law.
Hans Timm was married in 1902. lie

wife, Rose, and as soon as he obtains
his freedom, it in reported, he will

RACING PERCENTAGE
IS AGAINST THE PLAYER
Careful Calculation Demonstrates That Where the
Rookies Stick to the Block They Have
I very Advantage Over Public
From tho Mew Tor It Telegraph
"A little learning Is a dangerous
thing" applies particularly well to the
man who would attempt to overcome
the strength of betting percentages.
Behind this mathematical trick the
book maker or banker In any game may
sit for all time, asking nothing from
the public but its play. When book
makers fall the trouble often Is that
the] have left the block too much to
back their own opinion, thus confus
ing their book making with their bet
ting operations until they have no bet
ter chance than the piker whom they
would devour. Of the great army of
players few can tell what the percent
age against, them In the betting means
or how It works to defeat them. The
dictionaries do not define the word In
lts gambling sense, but a good syno
nym for It would be advantage, in ef
fect It amounts to whatever the banker
may remove from the player's stake
before paying It over. In professional
poker games it may vary according to
whatever may be taken out for the
kitty, but In mechanical games, of
Which roulette Is perhaps tile most mi
table example. it is constant, being
five and five-nineteenths. It Is Interest
lng to note here the clever and consist
centeent way in which the advantage Is
taken and then observe how the prin
ciple Is carried Into tho betting ring
to do Its work for higher stakes.
In roulette there are always thirty
seven numbers. Including "0" and "00"
ngalnst any one number that may be
played. Hence the true odds are ::T to
1. or a total of 38 units if the player
wins. Instead of removing two units,
the panker pays only 35 units for 1, or
a total of 36. nnd in this way withholds
2-3Sths, equal to five and five-nine
teenths per cent of the player's due.
In another way: If an Individual
player, or JSS different players, should
play all of the 38 numbers with the
same amount, the winning number
would surely bp covered at every turn
of the wheel, but the hanker would re
turn 36 chips or units for the total of
.18 stnked, and again 2-38ths of the
playem' Investment would be lost. In
still another way It may be shown that
the player Is actually compelled to pay
just five and five-nineteenths per oent
more than his chance Is worth. By
staking, say, $1 on a number at the
banker's odds of 35 to 1, the player hus
one chance in 38 to receive a total of
$36. The actual value of such a chance,
if offered for sale, would be one-thirty
eighth of $36. which is 94 and 14-19 th
cents. The player, therefore, always
pays at the rate of ," and r>-19ths cents
on the dollar more than the value of
his possibility— a condition that he can
not avoid. This amply safeguards the
banker and works, as analysis of many
kinds has shown, to defeat every sys
tem that has ever been devised. No
method of play In this or any other
game can ever succeed for any length
of time without receiving all that it
actually wins, and nothing can over
come the condition that the bank pays
short of what it owes.
To carry this principle into the bet
ting ring and apply It with telling ef
fect constitutes tho main thing in the
science of percentage book making.
So cleverly is it done, however, that-as
much as 40 and 50 per cent may be con
cealed in the figures without arousing
the slightest suspicion. Taking for
analysis any price commonly laid, say
3 to 1, it will not matter how much
or how little the public may wager at
the price, 25 per cent will always be
the public's share in the money at
stake. The book maker will lay "$3 to
*1, $G0 to $20, $300 to $100, $3000 to $1000,
and so on, the public's share in the total
amount Involved being always 25 per
cent, and In a like manner the per
centage of public money involved may
be calculated for every conceivable
price that can be laid.
Suppose, then, that the public puts
up 50 per cent of all the money Involved
about one horse, 33 1-3 per cent of all is
involved about another, and 20 per cent
of all Involved about a third. The total
staked by the public will then be 3 1-3
per cent more than they can possibly
get back, no matter which horse wins.
By calculating tho proportion of pub
lic money involved at all the different
prices, and then arranging them in
the form of a table, the book maker Is
at onco able to determine his advan
tage. If the percentage of the prices
laid add to just 100 odds will be fair to
layer and player alike. This would be
called a "flat" book. If the percentages
add to less than 100 the public will have
an advantage over the book maker, but
the book maker will see to it that they

his percentage,
The first requisite In making nny fur
ther Analysis Of tlil« kind of liottlng Is
a thorough uiin>rstandlng of the rola-|
tion between odds and chances, No de
viation from this Invariable relation
can tie made without working aii Injus
tice to one of the parties to tho bet. '
Knowing tho chances for or against tho
occurrence of any event, it is. of
course, possible to determine tin- true
odds, or, In a like manner, tho odds
being known, it Is always possible to
determine the exact chance implied.
Confusion may result from assuming
that the chances against n horse are
equal to the number of other horses
In the race. It Is. of course, line thai
the work of the handlcapper Is an ef
fort to bring horses together on some
thing like equal terms, but It has never
reached a degree of perfection thnt
would warrant the layer in dealing
with the horses rs though they were
I numbered ohnnoes In n hnt. N<> system
of assigning weights could ever result
in such ii universal dead bent. It may
ho 40 or even 400 to one that n horse
will not win, oven though there may
bo btit two OT three other horses com
peting with him, and In another race
the same horse inny be quoted at even
money against a Held .if Ifl. It may be
paid, however; that every horse' In a
race has some sort of a chance to win.
hut as there is no Itnown way of de
termining by mathematics exactly whnt
it is, an estimate, based on judgment
of the weights and other conditions,
must be made. In order to assign the
chances With any degree of consistency
10(1 or any other round number may be
taken us a unit.
The odds in each case must then be
laid In exact relation to the number of
chances assigned. Following this
method It is obvious that the s;nn of
the respective chances cannot consist
ently exceed 100. or whatever unit may
he taken. The odds actually laid in the
betting ring, however, show that the
public is often compelled to play, or,
rather, depend upon chances that do i
not exist. For an example, to prove the j
case, take any race at random, say,
the third at Aqueduct on November 10.
This Is how the odds were laid:
Veil Even !
Adoration 3 to 1 :
I.orlng S to 1
Barbary Belle 8 to 5
Veil, accord to the odds, had an even !
money chance to win. Even money is
the price laid when there Is as much
chance to win as there Is to lose. This
is the same as one chance In a total of
two. or 50 in 100. Three to one implies
that Adoration had one chance in four, .
tho same as 25 in 100. Eight to one
implies that Lorlng had one chance in !
a total of nine, the same as 11.1 in 100, [
while 8 to 5 against Barbary Belle ,
shows that the filly must have had a ]
chance just equal to five in a total of .
13, or about 38% in 100. As the total ,
of all these chances is a little over 124 <
it follows that between 24 and 25 ,
chances have been allotted somewhere i
that do not exist. At the odds the pub- '
lie will have to put up 50 per cent, of :
all the money involved about Adora- 1
tion, 11.1 per cent, of all involved about i
Lorlng, and SS l^ per cent, of all in- '.
volved about Barbary Belle. By thus
interpreting the odds Into chances over .
24 per cent, is found to exist against I
the player. With a like amount In- '
volved about each horse the bookmaker
Is bound to keep 24.6 per cent., to be i
exact. I
Since the chances of the horses are '
necessarily based on an estimate, the ]
proportion of chance allotted to any
particular one might be forever in dis
pute, but after the chances of a por
tion of them have been assigned the
consistent chances actually allotted by |
the odrls to Adoration, Lorlng and Bar- ]
bary Uelle. respectively, was 74.6 out ■
|of the total of 100. There were then ,
25.4 remaining to go to Veil, making
her chances approximately 25 in 100.
She could not have had 50 chances, as ,
the price of even money would make i
it appear, because there were not 60 |
chances left that could be assigned.
According to the odds against the oth- :
ers it was actually 3 to 1 that Veil
would not win, but Veil did win and I
her backers took even money.
* * * .
The shortage In the odds placo and '
third is even greater than the odds to
win. In fact, here is where the heavi
est percentages of all arc made. Ask

i The rule, though Inconsistent, Is
| used because It guarantees an ample
percentage In the prices for lie layer,
but It makes the odds fall far short
of the fair odds for the player. With
this rule more or less In mind, the
1 bookmaker lays In the place prices so
that the, total of their percentages will
I exceed 200 ami the show prices so that
! their total will exceed 800. The excess
lof 200 and 800 In the place and show
betting, respectively, will show the per
centage for the layer, Just as (ho ex
cess of 100 will show It In the straight
: betting.
I Hut the odds that are Just to layer
and player alike can only be found by
\ resorting to a diligent comparison be
tween odds and chances. The straight
' odds against a horse Will show the
estimated chance to win. Twice this
chance will show his chance to get the
place, while three times this winning
chance will show his probability of
running third.
By this principle, then, a horie that
ls 10 to I lii the straight' betting may be
said to have a chance to win the same
as one In a total of 11, because where
one chance Is selected out of a total of
ii the true odds are 10 to 1 against It.

half of 11, or 1 in :>',{. to get the place.
Against such a chance the true odds
are 4V& to 1, or 9 to 2, not 4 to 1, as laid
in practice. Three times the winning
chance Is Just equal to 3 In 11, or i in
3 2-3, it nst which the odds are 2 2-3
to i, or Bto 3, not 2tol, as laid. There
fore the full price across the board for
a horse that Is 10 to 1 straight Is 10,
9 to 2 and 8 to 3, and not 10, 4 and 2.
Following this method, the consistent
place and show odds may be calcu
lated for any price that may be laid
straight. As proof of the accuracy of
the odds calculated In this way, let the
bookmaker lay 10 to 1 (9.09 plus per
cent.) 11 times straight. Then lay 9 to
2 v(18.v (18. plus per cent.) 11 times place,
and 8 to 3 (27.27 plus per cent.) 11 times
third. The result Is 100, 200 and 300
"flat" all three ways, showing no ad
vantage.
Accurate odds for fourth or even fifth
place could be determined, but as there
ls no official placing of the horses In
these positions it would not, of course,
bc practical to carry the betting that
I far. '
HUGE BANK DIVIDENDS
Payment this week of a 400 per cent
dividend by the Chase National bank
gives Interest to the manner of paying
huge dividends by banks whose stock
Is closely held. Under the law a na
tional bank can only declare a cash
dividend. In cases where a large div
idend is declared, therefore, with the
idea that most, If not all, of the ad
ditional amount shall be taken In new
stock, the stockholders have virtually
to subscribe for a large portion. If not
all, the proposed issue in. advance.
With a closely held bank this affair
is an easy matter.
AVhPn the First National increased
its capitalization six years ago from
IMoO.OOO to $10,000,000 and declared its
famous 1950 per cent dividend the In
stitution had scarcely twenty-five
shareholders. They were eager to
subscribe for the additional stock and
Invested a large share of their divi
dend that way, although an actual
cash distribution had to be made. The
tame process was followed in the case
of the Chase National, which has
scarcely more than fifty shareholders.
That institution is also controlled by
First National interests. Both these
bank" are controlled by a small group
of very rich men, of which George F.
Baker and James J. Hill are the cen
tra! figures. The Chase has only eight
directors, three of whom are officers,
and the First National twelve direc
tor?, of whom four are officers. Vir
tually all of the $900,000 new stock
authorized a fortnight ago by the
State Bank of this city, when It de
clared a 900 per cent dividend, went
to itfe forty or fifty shareholders.— New
York Evening Post.
THE DAILY DIME NOVELS
It was a mere matter of fact to state
that a certain order of newspapers
have literally become daily dime novels.
They distort the great honest life of'the
nation in a way to give the Impression
to a growing army of comparatively
Ignorant readers that falseness and
crime are almost dominant In the life of
the American people. This is a situa
tion wherein are wrapped great possi
bilities for evil. It becomes all the
more Important that decent men in
Journalism remain true to the truth,
and give full place to that honesty and
righteousness which are always pres
ent and which will exalt a nation. —

Life's a game at whose beginning all
the world is net a-apinnlng,
That the very thought of winning is
itself a splendid spur.
Life's a thing of rough-and-tumble,
life's a thing of laugh, and gruin-
Life's li thing of grab and fumble,
life's a thing of Jolt and Jar;
Life's a stretch of daisied meadows,
life's a place of glints and shad-
Life's a' thing of maids mid widows,
smiles and tears, and there you
are.
Life's a thing of self-styled winners,
millionaires and saints and sln-
Mcn"whb have and haven't dinners,
thing of riff-raff steal and toll;
Men who go their ways a-laughlng, men
who go their ways a-chaffing,
Men who go their ways a-quaffing.
men whose only thought Is spoil.
Maidens wise and maidens witty,
Ma maidens beautiful and pretty,
Painted women — O the pity! always
