be sure to look over the
NORTH SIDE
and buy a lot there. Prices
vary from
$100.00 TO $150-00
ON MONTLY PAYMENT PLAN.
For any one working in any
of the mines these Lots
should surely be interest­
ing as north of the NORTH
SIDE ADDITION, one of
the biggest mines will be
opened. The Sauntry,Sliver,
Enterprise and the Alpena
mines are nearer to this ad­
dition than to any other
part of the city. This fact
should be looked into be­
fore you purchase Lots
elsewhere. Come in and
let us talk this over with
you, as it surely should be
worth that much to you.

Is a wet proposition, and more than half the time
both you and the plumber are to blame. You have no
business hiring a blacksmith to do your plumbing.
If you let us, you are sure it's right. GOOD PLUMB­

Friday, December 11,1908.
Entered at tbe Poet-Office at Virginia, Minn.,
as second class mail matter.
Terms. $2 Per Year, in Advance
GEN. J. H. BAKER, of Red Wing,
has written a book on the governors
of Minnesota, from Ramsey to John­
son. Fail to find an autobiography
of either Dunn or Jacobson i.i the
work.
THE second session of the sixtieth
congress convened on Monday. One
law that ought to be passed should
make it a misdemeanor tor a Minne­
sota voter to split his ballot in a
presidential year.
THE first annual meeting of the
Minnesota Roadmakers' Associa­
tion will be held at St. Paul, under
the auspices of the state highway
commission, on December 15,16 and
17. Such an organization can find
plenty of work in this new northern
section of the state.
IN connection with the
discussion
which has been brought up by the
range press relative a more equit­
able distribution of the county road
fund, what would be the matter with
a rule to have such fund divided
prorata according to the size of the
commissioner districts. This might
keep a few dollars of the taxes paid
by the ranges in the range districts,
where they rightly belong.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has brand­
ed the editors of the New York Sun
and the Indianapolis News as"liars"
and the scribes do not take kindly
to the President's plain manner of
stating things. And it is more than
likely that the President of this
great republic will find that he is
not fighting bears before the irate
quill pushers get through talking
to him and of him.
IN his last message to Congress,
President Roosevelt voices one
sentiment that will meet with the
unqualified approval of Judge
Carey, of the local municipal court.
The President asserts that, "Begin­
ning with the supreme court, the
judges should have their salaries
doubled." Such a course would
make of the local mill of justice a
fair job, considering the fact that
the city now pays the incumbent a
salary of $2400 per annum.
THE range organization of civic
leagues will ask the State Anti
Saloon League to assist in the work
of cleansing the ranges by sending
a representative to this section for
the purpose of organizing branches
in the various range municipalities.
Many there are on the ranges who
do not object to the saloon but who
do object to the idea of having
the saloon run without regard to
law and run the political policies of
the communities, or try to do so, as
well.
THE BIWABIK TIMES, in reference
to the tonnage tax on ore, says that
"nothing was heard of this mode of
taxation until J. J. Hill had disposed
of his ore land holdings to the steel
trust." The Times man, if he will
get the "dope" out of his system
and study the question for about
thirty seconds will find that the
tonnage tax was tirst introduced in
the Minnesota legislature in 1897,
while the Hill ore lands were not
disposed of to the steel company
for several years thereafter.
THE DULUTH HERALD would be
the Bponsor for a law requiring the
actual ownership of newspapers to
be made public. Such a law would
meat with the approval ot readers
in general, as they would then know
whether they were devouring the
boiled down meat of the corporate
interests who presumably control
most of the big dailies or are feed­
ing from the honest ideas of one
whose welfare in life depends upon
preaching what he considers is for
the best interests of the people as a
whole.
JACOB K. JACOBSON, who ran for
governor as the special protege of
the former employe of Mabel Evans
at the time of the famous "Virginia
Sliver" state lease was given, has
been cited to appear before Public
Examiner Anton Schaefer to explain
irregularities in connection with
the purchase of board of control
supplies taking place during the
time of Mr. Jacobson's service on
the board. Amounts involved are
said to run into the thousands of
dollars, although the public exam­
iner has refused to give any detailed
statement of his findings until Mr.
Jacobson has been given an oppor
tunity to explain.
UNDER recent instructions from
the general land office timber and
stone filings will be temporarily
abandoned, although for what pur­
pose is not definitely stated, the in­
structions coming by wire. It is
thought likely, however, that the
act means the future sale of govern
ment lands sought under the stone
and timber act by appraised valua­
tion, a new regulation promulgated
by the general land office so amend­
ing the stone and timber act of June
3, 1878, as to provide that timber and
atone lands shall be sold at a mini­
mum of $2.50 pet acre, necessitating
an appraisal of value in future be­
fore lands are proven and patented.
Heretofore a flat rate of $2.50 per
acre has been maintained, but under
the new ruling the remaining lands
will likely bring much higher
figures, although the choice lota are
gone.
FKANK PINTO IS the name given
by a Hibbing unfortunate who was
shipped by the west end authorities
to Duluth (or treatment after having
been held up and filled full of lead,
Pinto presenting an appearance
upon his arrival in Duluth that
elicited the sympathy ot the police
of the head of the lakes. He was
nearly dead upon his arrival in Du­
luth, unattended and unannounced,
and as he staggered into the depot
covered with blood and suffering
from three bullet wounds he was
taken in charge by the police and
sent to a hospital. Perhaps the Hib­
bing authorities have the right line
on getting rid of those who are
wounded in hold-up games, but the
method is not one which, when fully
realized, is destined to appeal to the
merciful.
