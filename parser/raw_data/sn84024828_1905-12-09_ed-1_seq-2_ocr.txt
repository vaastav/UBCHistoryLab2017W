of departed brothers by appropriate
ceremonies in the spacious Elk Hall

with smilax ivy violets calla lilies
and other rare flowers A large au

add their tribute of respect and about
fifty Elks of the local and outside
lodges paid the ritualistic tribute to
the dead The music was excellent
Mrs Fred W Morrison presiding at
the piano The solos by R Nickel
of Aspen lodge were highly appre
ciated by the large audience Judge
Blakely in eloquent and eulogistic
terms spoke of the worth of the depart
ed brothers and Hon T G Norris of
Prescott lodge reviewed the good
work of the order and paid a tribute
to the beautiful custom of meeting
yearly to freshen the graves and make
green the memories of the throng of
brothers who have gone to the other
side The singing of Mrs Fred W
Morrison was one of the most delight
ful of the memorial ceremonies Rev
Farr pronounced the benediction and
the ritualistic observance of the day
was over This custom of reviving
memories of brothers that had been
bound together in ties of Elkian friend
ship and whose souls had joined the
happy throng on the other shore is
one to be commended and other be
nevolent orders ought to follow the
example of the local lodge of Elks in
its observance
The President and Statehood
In his message to congress Pres
ident Roosevelt recommends that Ari
zona and New Mexico be admitted to
the Union as one state This recom
mendation is a gross injustice to both
territories and ought to be resisted to
the last by all right thinking men
Should the bill pass congress the peo
ple should reject a constitution under
it by a large majority New Mexico
is large enough to support a single
state government and is sure to com
mand justice at the hands of the gov
ernment if it refuses jto accept a join
ture with Arizona and our own terri
tory will come in with population and
wealth within a few years Let New
Mexico go in as -a state at this time
and Arizonas way is clear for future
action Let us reject the Presidents
recommendation andgive him another
