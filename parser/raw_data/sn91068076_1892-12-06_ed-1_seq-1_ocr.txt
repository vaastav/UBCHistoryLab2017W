Washinoton, Dec. G, Followinc is
the President's, message in part :
The Secate and House of Representa
tives'. "In submitting my annual im'ssn;c to
Congrtga I have great satisfaction in be
ing able to say that the general condi
tions affecting the commercial and in
dustrial interest of the the United States
are in the mo:-t agreeable state. I be
lieve that so high a degree of prosperity
and so general a diffusion of the com
forts of life were never before cnjoi (', by
our people. The total wealth of the
country iu 1860 was $16,159,010,058;
ia 1800 itamounted to $62,610,000,000.
an increase of 287 per cent. The total
mileage of railways in the 0uited States
in 1800 was 30,020; in 1890 it was
107,74-1, an increase of 448 per cent., and
it is estimated that there will be about
.000 mile of track added by the close
of the year 1802. The official returns of
the eleventh census and those of the
tenth census for 75 leading citlesT furnish
a basis for the following comparison :
In 1880 the capital invested in manu
facturing was $1,232,839,070; in 1890
the capital invested in manufacturing
was $2,900.7.'H,884.. In 1880 the mint
ber of emploves was 1,301,388; in 1890
the number of employes was 2,251,134.
In 1880 the wages aimed were $501,
965,778; in 1890 the wages earned were
$1,221,170,454. In 1880 the value ol
the product was $2,771,579,899. In
1890 the value of the product was $4,
860,280,837. Mew Industries
"I am informed by the superintendent
of the census that thcoinisiiun of certain
industries in 18K0, which were included
in 1890, accounts in part for the remark
able increase thus shown, but after
making full allowance for the different
methods and deducting the returns for
all industries not included in the census
in 1880 there remains in reports from
these seventy-five cities an increase ol
capital employed of $152,745,644. in
value of product of $2,024,236,160,
in wages earned of $677,94:1,049.
The new industrial plants estab
lished since October 6, 1890, and up
to October 22, 1892, as partially re
ported in the American Economist, and
the extension of existing plants and
the capital invested amount to $40,449,
050 and the number of additional em
ployes to 37,285.
"The report of the special agent of the
Treasury department shows at the date
September 30, 1892, there were thirty
two companies manufacturing tin aiid
terne plate in the United States and four
teen companies building new works for
such work. The estimated investments
in building and plants at the close
of the fiscal year June 30, 1893, if exist
ing conditions were to be contiucd, was
$5,000,000 and the estimate of produc
tion aoo.OOU.OUO pounds per annum.
The actual production for the quarter
ending September 30, 1892, was 10,
925,725 pounds.
Exports and Import.
The foreign trade for 1S92 exceeded
the annual average value by $-K)0,3."S,-
591, an increase of 22.47 percent. The
ignificancc and value of this increase are
hown by the fact that the excess in the
trade of 1892 over 1891 was wholly in
the value of exports, for there was a de
crease in the value of imports of $17,513,-
754. The value of our exports during
the fiscal vear 1892 reached the highest
figure in the history of the government,
amounting to $1,030,278,148, exceeding
bv $145,797,338 the exports ol 1891
and eseeeding the imports bv $202,
875,080. fhcre never has been a time in our
history when wotk wus so abundant or
when wages were as high, whether
measured by the currency in which they
are paid or by the power to supply the
necessaries and conitorts ol lite. It is
true the market price of cotton and
wheat have been low; it is one of the un
favorable features of agricultural lilc
that the farmer cannot produce on
orders; he must sow and reap in igno
rance, aud is peculiarly subject to the
depreciation which follows over produc
tion. Hut, while the fact is as I have
stated as to the crops mentioned, the
general average of prices have been such
p.s to give to agriculture a fairparticipa
tion in the general prosperity. 1 he
value of our total farm products has in-
ei eased from $1,363,046,800 in 18l0 to
$4,500,000,000 in 1892.
Protection.
"The English agriculturist would be
glad to exchange the returns of his labor
for those of the American farmer, and
the Manchester workmen their wages for
those of their fellows at Fall River. I
believe that the protective system which
has mw for something more than thirty
years continuously prevailed in our legis
lation has been a mighty instrument for
the developcment ol your nationality,
and a most powerful agency in protect
ing the homes ot our workingmen Irom
the invasion of want."
' . . . . The result of the recent elec
tion must be accepted as having intro
duced a new policy. We must assume
that the present tariff constructed upon
the lines ot protection is to be repealed
and that there is to be substituted for it
a tariff law constructed solely with refer
ence to revenue; that no duty is to be
nigncr, oecauscinc increase win Keep open
an American mill or keep up the wages
of an American workman, but that in
either case such a rate of duty is to be
imposed ns will . bring to the treasury
of the United States the largest returns

tnai ine prevailing party win not carry,
into legislation, the princiulcs advo
cated by it and the pledges given the
people, i recommend that the whole
subject of tariff revision be left to the
incoming Congress."

Assuming that our political relations
with Canada are to remain unchanged
the President thinks a radical revision of
our trade relation with the Uommion
should be made.
The President recommends to the at
tention of Congressa proposed telegraph
cable to Honolulu and relers briefly to
the protest ol this government against
rrench encroachment upon Liberia and
the action taken to protect our mis
sionaries and schools in Turkey.
Reciprocity.
In connection with the discussion of
the tariff the President reviews the
alleged beneficial results ol the reciproc
ity provision of the McKinley tariff and
forecasts much benefit yet to come.
Nicaragua Cttnal.
The Nicaragua canal is given the fol
lowing paragraph :
"1 repeat, with great earnestness, the
recommendation which 1 have made in
several previous messages that prompt
snd adequate support be given to the
American company engaged in the con
structing of tl e Nicaragua ship canal.
It is impossible to overestimate the
value Irom every standpoint of this
great enterprise, and I hope that there
may be time, even in this Congress, to
give to it an impetus that will insure the
early completion of the canal and secure
to the United States its proper relation
to it when completed."
The Cholera.
As to cholera and the quarantine the
President says: "There is danger that,
with the coming of spring, the cholera
will again appear. The most careful
and stringct quarantine legislation may
not lie sufficient to exclude the disease.
The proercss of medical and sanitary
science has been such, however, that il
approved preventives are taken at once,
putting all ol our cities and towns in the
best sanitary condition and provision is
made for the isolation of any sporadic
case, and for a thorough dissecting, an
epidemic, can, I am sure, be avoided.
This work appertains to the local au
thorities and the responsibility and tl.c
penalty will be appallinc:! it is neglected
or unduly delayed.
Iiilnilifralioii.
Wc are peculiarly subject in our ports
to the spread ol lnlectious diseases by
reason of the fact that unrestricted im
migration brings to us out of European
cities in the overcrowded steerages ol
the great steamships a large number ol
persons whose surroundings make them
the easy victims of the plague. This
consideration, as well as those affecting
the political, moral and industrial inter
ests of our country, lead me to renew the
suggestion that admission to our coun
try and to the high principles ol citizen
ship should be more restricted. We have,
I think, a right, and owe it as a dutv to
our ieople to keep out the ignorant, the
pauper and the contract laborer, but
also to check the too great flow of immi
gration now coming by a further limit."
Wants an Election I.aw.
"In my last annual message I endeav
ored to invoke serious attention to the
evil of uulair apportionment. I hud
hoped that it was possible to secure a
non-partisan inquiry, by menu ol a com
mission, into the evils the existence ol
which is known to all, and that out ol
this might grow legislation from which
all thought of partisan advantageshciultl
be eliminated and only the higher thought
appear ol maintaining the Ireeuom and
purity of the ballot and the equality of
the elector. Itisl'ine mutuul charges
of unfairness and fraud between the great
parties should cease and the sincerity ol
those who desire pure and honest elec
tions should be brought to the test ol
their willingness to free our legisla
tion and our election methods from
everything that leads to fraud in
the announced result. 1 he necessity
lor an inquiry and lor legislation bv
Congress upon this subject isemphnsized
by the fact that the tendency of legisla
tion in some of the states in recent years
has, in some important particulars, been
away from and not toward free and fair
elections and equal apportionment. It
is now tune that we should come to
gether upon the high plane of patriotism
while we devise methods that shall secure
the rght ot every man qualified by law
to cast a free ballot and give to every
such ballot an equal value in choosing
our public offices and in directing the
policy of the government."
I.y HCllillKH
"The frequent lynching of colored
people accused of crime is without the
excuse which is sometimes urged by
mobs, that the uecuscd have an undue
influence over the courts andjurics. Such
acts nre a reproach to the community in
which they occur, and so far as they can
be made the subject of. jurisdiction
the strongest legislation is demanded.
A public sentiment th.1t will sustain the
officers ol the law in resisting mobs and
in protecting the accused intlicircustody
should be promoted by every possible
means.
The New Policies
The President concludes as follows;
"This exhibit of the work of the execu
tive departments is submitted to Con
gress and to the public in the hope that
there will be found in it an en'rnest pur
pose to maintain the national honor and
to promote the happiness and prosperity
of all our people, and this brief exhibit of
the growthand prosperity of the country
will give us a level Irom which to note
the increase or decrease that new legis
lative policies may bring to us. There
is no reason whv the national influence
for power aud prosocrity should not ob
serve the same rates of increase that
have characterized the past thirty years
We can carry the great impulse and in
crease of these years into the future.
There is no reason why, in many lines of
production, wc should not surpass all
other nations as we have already done
in some. There arc no near Irontiers to
our possible development. Retrogression
would be a crime.

LOST IN SIGHT OF HELP
A HE VV GALE OFF THE MER
SEY.
Au Unknown Bark WHU Her
Crew Goes Down In a Fearful
Gale Lite Boats In able to do
Anything.
Liverpool, Dec. 0 A very heavy gale
prevailed in this vicinity and a tremen
dous sea is running at the mouth of the
Mersey river, making it extremely dan
gerous for a vessel to enter or cross the
river. At 8:30 o'clock this morning u
vessel which, from her general appear
ance was supposed to be a Norwegian
vessel, ran aground on the Burba bunk.
It was evident from the manner in which
she was handled that she had no pilot on
board. As soon as her headway was
stopped the sea made a clear breach over
her, sometimes completely biding her
from sight. Fifteen minutes after she
struck her main mast and mizzen top
mast went over the side and shortly af
terward the vessel fell over on her side
aud was completely submerged.
Life boats put out for the bark as soon
as her position waj seen, but their
progress against the gale and sea was
slow, and the bark went down before
they reached her. It is supposed that
everybody on board was lost.
COTTON.
Some Futures of Interest From
Atlanta.
Atlanta, Dec. C Six hundred and
fifty thousand bales of cotton, or near
that number, it is estimated here will be
the crop for the present year. The gath
ering of the crop in nearly every part of
the State has been completed and the
quanity remaining in the fields is hardly
worth computation. A much larger per
cent, of the crop has been sold up to this
time than for several years.
New Yokk, Dec. 0. Itis expected that
a meeting of traders in cotton will be
held in this city within a few days for the
purpose of discussing the recent circular
issued by fire insurance men relative to
the transfers of insurance on cotton. In
speaking of the matter a member of the
Hoard of Fire underwriters said :
"It is a fact that over 90 per cent, of
the prominent insurance companies
throughout the country, have signified
their c'isapproval of the plan to change
the rules."
Some of the members of the cotton ex
change are very outspoken in the ex
pression of their disapproval of the atti
tude assumed by the underwriters. They
have prepared lor publication a state
ment in which they declare that premi
ums for insurances on cotton arc higher
than they can afford to pay under exist
ing ciccumstances. On the other hand
the underwriters insist that the inaugu
ration ot cheap rates would be uulair
to stockholders iu the insurance com
panies. There is in business circles great
diversity of opinions as the probable
outcome of the controversy between the
traders in cotton and managers of fire
insurance companies.
MONETARY CONFERENCE.
1181111 Falls to Amount to Any
thing. Pakis, Dec. 0. The Journcl Des De
bats, whose financial editor was a mem
ber of the committee appointed by the
International Monetary conference to
consider the Rothschild proposals, de
clares that the scheme was only a slight
modification of the proposal of ten years
ago by Professor Lowe, a German. He
adds that the proposals would not have
received any attention if they had not
been presented by Rothschild. Continu
ing, the Journal says that it is useless to
rely upon any legislative check to the
production of silver in the United States
and Mexico, and that if the conference
proves futile the United States will cease
its purchases of silver and India will
adopt a new standard,

A Loss ot a Hundred Thousand
Dollars iu New York.
New York, Dec. 0. The five story
marble front building, 30 Wall street, was
almost wholly destroyed by a fire which
broke out early this morning. Hoorum
& Pease, bank book manufacturers, in
dustrial printing and binding company,
and Frank K. Walker, paper manufact
urer who occupied the building were
burned out. Their stock is a total loss.
One hundred thousand dollars will prob
ably cover the entire loss which is be
lieved to be fully covered by insurance.
A number of firemen had narrow escapes
bv the falling of the rear wall. Two were
injured. The burned building was five
stories high anil ran through the block
to Manhattan alley.

Wasiiinc.ton, Dec. 0. The United
States Supreme court today affirmed
the judgment of the Circuit court in the
well known Chicago lake front ease. The
lower court decided in favor ol the local
authorities and held that the Illinois
Central did not have a right to use sub
merged lands along the lake front for
wharves and piers.

yesterday changing the time for the ns

Congress shall assemble on the first

in each year.
Exports ol Tin.
Swansea, Dec. 0. The exports of tin-
plate from this port last week reached
