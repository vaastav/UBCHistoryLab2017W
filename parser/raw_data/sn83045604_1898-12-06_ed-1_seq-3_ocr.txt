OLTMPIA, Dec I.—The Judgment of the

i giOtident, Garfield county. Tnia ia a con-
Atfvveny over land within the indemnity
Wof the grin: to tne Northern I'a

Itfce case, briefly atated, are that ia IMS
■ Hri. Hanlflrd, a qualified settler, loca*«-d
I iVa z toe land, bu.it a house and made
ataer Improvements, and the defendant,
t - lf «wipdt by means of conveyance, sue
feeded ner ri * nt * an< * noa- holds under

j The appellant is the grantee of the raii
jsad cooßpany. and brought this action to
patent issued to the respondent
ge<i to obtain possession of the land. Tb«
of the respective parties were pre
nc,MSiy contested in the land department,
in a decision in favor of the
lOpS&dect by the a-cretary of tne interior.
IFaen the appellant purchased from tne
ItMßpany the case was pending before the
anti department. The appellant contends
- u*t the land was withdrawn from
| a»m*«:ead or other entry by the term* of
I ne act granting lands to aid in the cor.-
f wuctlcin of the railroad. The rulings in
i jse case show that the Judgment should
1 be sustained, and it may have been found
1 cast there was no deficiency entitling the

I ; {U Bd that when the selection was ma-le

absence of any reference to "points con
cerning which we mott desire Information."
He said, however, that it was & valuable
historical pater. and would oe convenient
for future referent*.
Senator Teller 'aid there would be disap
pointment over the failure of the president
to outline a government for the Philip
pines, saying. "There will be some disap
pointment in this, for I think the under
standing has been that the president wouii
indicate what form of government shouhi
be provided for thrs-- n- - * ; -^s-iff".* but
it is wise for the president not to indicate
his views on that subject, for that i» pure
ly and properly a leg.&latlve quest.on, and
one that should be left to congress."
On the recommendation in regard to cur
rency, Senator Teller said: "The friends
of bl-merallJsm. either national or Interna
tional, will find no encouragement from
anything that the president says in h s
message. No reference is made to interna
tional bi-metaii.sm. but the preside nt in the
most emphatic way indicates his intention
to maintain the gold standard. The so
called Silver Republicans who remain In
the Republican party and contend that the
Republican party is friendly to silver will
find no encouragement in the president's
mi- and it will strike all as somewhat
singular that if the Republican party, as
it has beer, claimed, is in favor of inter
national bi-mttaliiam, the preside#; makes
no reference to it."
Following are some of the opinions ex
pressed by members of congress upon the
president's message:
Representative Hitt, chairman of the
house committee on foreign affairs, said:
"The president has summarised and solved
in an able and felicitous manner many of
the questions in men's minis everywhere
touching the immense and rapidly suceee .-
lng events and the situation in which th
nation find* itself His simple proposition
to let the new possessions alone under just
anti firm governments and by the military
arm which conquered them, gives us plen:>
of time for discussion of all the propositions
for their permanent government. The prob
lem of governing the Cubans he deals with
gently and hopefully and everybody will
wish that his forecast of stable government
there will l>e realised aooner than ever >vt
has happened to a Spanish-American pop
ulation."
Representative Walker, chairman of the
committee on banking and currency! "I
am asked what I think of the currency and
banking features. I do not see that it has
any such features. I ha\e not been able to
detect any. It contains only one recom
mendation as to the currency, repeating
thai of a former m-ssage to change the
United States legal tender notes into gol I
certificates, which would have no effect on
the banking and currency s.tuation. but to
add to the burden of taxation without in
any d-pree favorably affecting the general
banking and curren v situation."

Commenting on the president's aurprtsing
language concerning the Nicaragua canal,
which utterly ignores British treaty rights,
the Daily Chronicle say* that "th.s
matter w.il arise ere long in a more acute
form."
Tne editorial highly approves Mr. M ."Kin
ley's referents to China and Great Britain.
The Standard says Mr. McKinley's refer
ences to China is a declaration that, had
the open door been closed or obstructed,
America would have interfered actively.
It adds upon this paint: "For all purposes
of British policy, no intimation could be
more welcome than that the United States
will appoint a commission to study the con
ditions In China."
The Daily Telegraph, which regards the
announcement that the United States will
support the open door in China as the
weightiest which the message contains,
says: "With such common interests to
unite us a formal alliance is unnecessary."
