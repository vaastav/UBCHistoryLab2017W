The rresldcnl'a Message.
President Harrison's lad message to
Congress ia fully equal io breath and
profundity to any State paper ever is
suer! by hlro. He tonchea eloquently
and ably on all the important imsnes.
nd hi views are well worth consider
ing, not only by men whose business
it is to carefully study economic ques
tions, but by the masses.
Like all of President Harrison's
messages to the people it is under
standable it is intelligent. No man
can misinterpret bis stalwart, vigorous
English, and every oiao can compre
hend his clean cut sentences, boldly
setting forth the policy of his adminis
tration. Tbls message will be read and com
mented upon not alone in this coun
try, but more entensively in those
countries to which the President pays
respects in dealing with the tariff quet
tion. The President is not an alarm
1st. He merely fears for the future
from the history of the past, aud very
truely says that the present generation
cannot be expected to be influenced to
any great extent by an expereence in
which it did not participate.
The full text of his remarkably able
documeot will be found on the first
page of to day's paper, and should be
read by all who would be posted on
the state of the nation.
President 11ai:i:ion evidently be
lieves I hut I he IViitnprati will have a
sweet time increasing t!ie prosperity of
the C'tuntiy hy adopting legislation
that must i -iu K iu the reduction of
waes. And he is not the only one
who thinks so, either.
Nkw York wants a liip canal up
the Hudson from New York to the
Erie canal and lli.-ncu to Lake Eile
Hope they'll get it. By the way,
win, t ever bcciimn of that ship canal
from Pittsburg in Lake Erie that the
Pennsylvania Legislature had a
spasm over about four years agoT
There was a commission appointed
and it spent $10,000 or so, aud it
made a report, but there it coded. If
we are to nave a ship canal it is about
time somebody jumped iuto the grave
yard ami resurrected that old report.
Harrisburg Telegraph.
The President's message has had a
very decided effect in placing the Re
publican party in Congress io ao ag
gressive attitude. The rout of Mo
vember had evidently left the party
leaders io some doubt as to their re
lations in future movements iu legis
lation. The President has pointed
out the way aud the lenders are very
willing to take that direction. The
Democrats are very much exercised
over the political references or rather
"partisan licks," as they term thetn,
which tbey characterize as a bid fur
1896.
At last we have it definitely that
the Weaver electors were elected in
North Dakota. This great question
having been settled, let the country
prepare for Christmas.
Jav Gould entered Wall street at
the age of 23 with $5,000 iu his pock
et, saved by rigid economy. His sons
continue business at the same old
stand with a capital of $75,000,000.
IT comes troni Washington that a
boom is being started there for Con
pressman Stone, of Warren for the
Republican Gubernatorial nomination
in 1894. It is rather eariy in the day
to talk of candidates, but if Charles
W. Stone should recievu the nnmina
tion be would get the biggest majority
given a candidate fur Governor in
thirty years. He is a statesman clean
through. JIarrkburg Telegraph.
Right you are. With him as our
candidate, the Democrats would be
saved the trouble of going to the polls.
The Democrats pretend to be afraid
that the Republicans are going to
capture enough doubtful legislatures,
in those Western States which elect
U. S. Seuators, to keep that wing of
the national legislature under Repub
lican control. Ileal I v tbey are afraid
of no such thing. On the contrary
the majority of the Democrats of the
country are hoping nod praying that
the Republicans will retain their ma
jority in the Senate so as to prevent
them (the Democrats) from blunder
ing io the passage of much bad legis
lation on the very important issues
just Dow before the American people.
Tbey are geltiug desperately uueasy
io this particular, reminding one of
the fellow who yoked himself up with
the calf: "Heie we come, d u our
fool pictures! head us, somebody."
The Hon. Tom Watson, of Georgia,
to whom the world at large is indebt
ed for the story that a maudlin Con
gressman asked the querdinu "where
was I at?" has reached Washington
and ia looked upon with disfavor by
the Southern Democratic Congress
men. Mr. Watson was fur years a
prominent factor in Georgia politics
as a Democrat, aud aided the Demo
cratio party to keep back Republicans
from the polls and suppress the few
Republitau votes thai happened to
get into the ballot-box. When be ran
fur Congress at the late election on the
Third Parly Farmers' alliance ticket
the Georgia Democrats played the
the same game on him and hie party,
and be was not slow iu denouncing it,
For ibis do the Democratic rebel tirig
adiers hale him, aud he will be giveu
the cold shoulder until bis term ex
pires.
Lieutenant Governou Hajle,
the Republican caudidate fur Govern
or of Massachusetts, at the lust elec
tion, says that on the face of the re
turns that is tbe vote an oouoted
Govoner Ruee.ll is re elected, but he
does not finish what be ought to say
Tbe votes that were cast for llaile, and
wnicn were not counted, would nave
snowed Russell under by at least 11,
000 plurality, the trouble arose out
ol IO.UUU uepuoncaus who voted !ur
llaile marking their ballots wrong
wbeo they voted for the bulauceof tbe
ticket. The intcutiuo to vole for
llaile was plain enough, hut the ballot
was declared dead because of the mis
take. Mr. Russell was not elected
Guvouer by a majority or 4 plurality
He guts it by ao error, but his pure
high minded Mugwump spirit compel
him to hang on lest w icked Kepubli
caoi gain au advantage.
Not Exactly Iu It.
A Washington correspondent tele
graphs as fallows: Representative
Honker and Charles W. Stone, in their
desire to benefit some of their constit
uents by having the head waters of
the Allegheny River improved, ran
afoul the Engineer Corps, and were
knocked out in the first round. The
Engiueer officer, Lieut. Harry Hod
ges, who was sent to investigate the
subject, reports emphatically against
ine improvement, and his superior,
Maj. Amos Stickoey, indorses the re
port as follows: The river between
Oleao and Warren is exceedingly
shallow with but a small amcunt of
water passing, and has a deep slope,
amouuting in some places to five feet
io one mile. For a portion of this
distance the river is used to sutue ex
tent for fl atiog logs to mill, but reg
ular rafting cannot be carried on un
der a four-foot stago. Tbe only im
provement of the river that could be
of much benefit to the cnmmunilv
would be the construction of locks and
dams to u ake slack-water navigation,
and the great cost of such work io
comparison with the commerce that
might be benefited renders it iuadvisa
hie to undertake them. The survey
in 1880 and the improvement tnadenf
terwards of this purt of the river was
all that was necessary. The locality
ia uot worthy of further improvement."
