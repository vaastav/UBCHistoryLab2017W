The Ananias society of Harper hold its

Thero seems to bo a firmly rooted con

THAT PREDICTION.
It i3 most gratifying to note the way
in which tho leading Republican papers
of Kansas, that one year ago were tell
ing the peoplo that the Eagle had hope
lessly and irretrievably fallen over into
tho ranlcs of the Democratic party, are
now advocating in double-leaded leaders
tho very things for which they ostracized
us. Notably the Topeka Capital and
Leavenworth Times aro outheroding
Herod, both of which papers hooted
at the Eagle's Rebellion and neither
one of which ever deigned to quote a
single one of tho many editorials in
which we designated the troubles that
were coming to tho Republican party.
Eveen the Kansas City Times, tne Demo
cratic mouthpiece of three states, pub
lished in full, and double leaded, a num
ber of the Eagle's articles on "More
3Ioney," on "Watered Railway Stocks,"
on "Consuming Interest," the McKinley
bill discriminations, and like matters.
But these otner papers and many other
Republican papers, laughed to scorn tho
declaration of the Eagle that there was
but $8 or 10, per capita, of money in
actual circulation; citing "Windom's
windy words to the contrary.
We now ask these papers where would
this country have been three weeks ago,
at the time of the Barring troubles, had
congress failed to give tho country that
compromie-e measure for Plumb's free
coinage act? We say thai there would
havo ensued a panic and a prostration of
values such as this country probably
never experienced, in which hundreds of
men would have gone to tho wall every
daj' this winter. Quoting the language
of ono of our editoria's: "the stringency
"is world-wide, the depression universal,
"and this usury-ridden nation of people
"must have relief in the way of
"an increase in the volume of
"currency, must havo more and cheaper
"money, or sweoping bankruptcy will
"follow." And asain; "the supply of all
"characters and kinds of money is short
"and tho dollar of gold, silver and paper
"because of relative scarcity, is loo dear
"and of too great purchasing power, en
abling tho creditor to rob the debtor;
"the dollar in the pocket of tho capital
ist being out of all proportion in its
"power a3 compared to other values."
Even tho Eagle's criticism of the
Kansas delegation was received with
poor grace.
But we must have more money, what
ever tho "Wall street goldbug, the banker
or tho creditor may say to the contrary.
Not only are the ordinary debtor and the
mortgagee classes surely sinking, but
the average business interests of the
country aro hampered and threatened
with insolvency, rendering otherwise
possible enterprises and movements in
the direction of general improvements
impossible.
How shall wo get it? Mako it. Make
it through Plumb's free coinage bill, is
one way, and a safe way, because it pro
vides for tho unquestioned basis of gold
and silver, good tho world over; make it
good for all debts, public and pri
vate, and mako it of as largo a
volume as the principal of redemption
in coin or in bullion will warrant, even
to the doubling of tho present circula
tion; mako it, till the holders of tho
present volume are pressed into disgorg
ing anu into investing in realty ana in
all other non-monetary values. Then
confidence will bo restored and good
times will come. Thero will bo growth
and increase in everything and every
where, instead of tho present universal
fear of maturing liabilities, distrust of
obligations and uneasiuess over shrink
ing and dissipating values.
Make it and there will bo a chance,
tho only chance, for the Republican
party in '92.
The Leavenworth Times pretends now
to fix tho exact amount of the proposed
increase. That is but guess work. A
fixed or stated increaso might depreciato
or effect the value of the government's
"promise to pay" and wo want only gold
and silver and the "promise to pay" of
an equal value. The Capital calls for tho
amount named in '69 and in '90 by the
Eagle, vis. a hundred millions moro of
national currency. That Is at least a
safe sum by which to increase, but one
which would probably fall far short of
the presont and continually expanding
tain that it will not be occupied by white
men again, either under leases or pur
chased from the Indians, and not until
it is opened for white settlement by the
government
A DOUBTFUL. EXPEDIENT.
Capt. John Florer, who has had eigh
teen year3 experience in dealing with
the Indians, has been interviewed by a
Kansas City Journal reporter in regard
to the present Indian situation in general
and the Cherokee strip in particular.
He is reported to have said that "if the
Cherokees refuse to accept the liberal
offer made by the government for the
strip, Judge Perkins1 plan of opening the
strip to settlement and. then negotiate
with the Indians, is the proper tiling to
do." That the government has the power
to do that nobody will deny, but that it
has tho right, moral, legal or other, is
just as patent. The very fact that the
government offers the Indians any sum
is an admission that their claim to the
land in question is valid, and if eo, tho
government has no more right to confis
cate it (for that is what such an act as
that proposed would be) than it has to
arbitrarily take tho property of a citizen
in time of peace. Urgent as the popular
demand is for the opening 6f the strip,
the emergency is not so great as to call
for such arbitrary action on the part of
the government. "We have not seen tho
plan in detail that the redoubtable cap
tain refers to, but think Judge Perkins
has been misquoted. "We are aware that
Mr. Perkins is the champion and recog
nized leader in this movement to secure
the opening of the Indian lands to settle
ment, but we think he is wrong in the
instanco herein cited if he is correctly
quoted.

National Alliance resolution.
The Alliance, as every other society or

solve in favor of or against any and
every such question if they choose, but
the rightfulness of tho thing demanded
is quite another proposition. In this par
ticular case the complainant has no moro
grounds of complaint that any other
class or community. The farmer portion
of the Alliance has nothing to complain
of if the exposition is opened Sundays:
they will not be called on to attend the
great show on Sunday. But largo num
bers of other laboring people will have to
visit the exposition on Sunday or not at
all. Peoplo whose scruples will prevent
them from visiting the exposition on
Sunday will have tho balance of
tho week to gratify their curi
osity in, but they should consider the in
terests of those who are so situated that
they cannot observe tho requirements of
such scruples without depriving them
selves of the enjoyments and recreations
of the rest day; and further, that "the

BLAIR'S BLUFF.

and modify ths McKinler bill, or the
party will not carry more than five ! doubtedly the object of tho present bid.
This morning's dispatches state that
John A, Blair, of Independence, Kan.,
has mnde the Cherokees an offer,through
Chief Mayes, of $20,000,000 for tho strip
of land bearing their name. This offer,
if it was in fact made, was no doubt
mado on behalf of the Cherokee Live
Stock association, of which Blair is a
member. Efforts have been made in the
samo direction by that association be
fore, and just at a time or times when
the government and Indians were on
the eve of consummating a deal, and
while such offers could not be accepted
by the Indians, they had the effect of
breaking off negotiations between the
comniisionersand Indians and postponing
the settlement of the issue. This is un-
A Harper county correspondent says:
"Times have been very close financially,
and farmers aro yet somewhat behind.
We had a good wheat crop this year,
and it is bringing a fair price. The larg
est acreage of wheat ever sown in this
county has been sown this fall, and it
never looked so well at this time of the
3ear as it does now, and if wheat is
worth 90 cents a bushel next fall, no
man in tho world, holding a mortgage
on a llaqer county farm, need lose a
cent, unless by his own folly. Farmers
are trying hard to get back interest paid
up, and in my opinion it is well for in
vestors, holding mortgages in this
county, to give the farmers a little time,
and my judgment is that if this is done,
by the next year thore will be no com
plaint as to our docket being behind, so
far as the farmers' part is concerned."
PLUMB AND THE PEOPLE.
From the Rcloit Gazette.
Senator PJumb introduced his silver
free coinage bill last Tuesday. If he
will push it to a passage, and devise and
carry through some measuro to squeeze
the water out of the railroad stocks, and
solve the problem of decent transporta
tion rates for the people, he can be presi
dent m '92, notwithstanding Blaine with
his reciprocity and Harrison with his
force bill and tho tariff. The transporta
tion question is the great problem before
tho American people today, and no party
can ever win again which does not meet
it, and decide it in favor of the people,
and against Jay Gould and his partners.
He holds, today, the prosperity of the
great mass of the American peoplo in
his hands, the railroads of the country
being, practically, under his control.
He h:is thrown off his mask, and defies
the business interests of the country;

that right speedily, the people, through
tho Alliance or in some other way, will
put men in power who will settle the
matter for all time to come.

American, and especially western wo
men are energetic, and it will be hard to
keep them out of politics unless kfpt
busy at some suitable employment. Can
the 'Wichita Eagle see a "way out,"
