The Result of the City Election
Quite a bit of good-natured rivalry
entered into the election of the munic
ipal officers last Tuesday. So far as
we can note from surface indications
the rivalry did not reach the point of
creating ill-feeling. That the matter
of who should be mayor for the ensu
ing year was not definitely settled,
should be a matter for legret. If, as a
prominent attorney has said, it was
necessary to elect a mayor at this time,
it had been vastly better to have put
two candidates before the voters.
Should the old council refuse to
issue a certificate of election to the
candidate who was elected on the face
of the returns, and the present incum
bent continue to serve, the question,
"Can a mayor, illegally holding office,
make a binding contract?" must con
front the council every time an ordin
ance comes up to be signed. It had
been much better to have settled this
question before than have it come up
after the election.
We often hear some one deplore the
snow-fall, rwho underestimates the ben
efits of the snow to crops and particu
larly to the fruit crop. The snow acts
as a blanket to the trees and prevents
the injury which freezing weather
would undoubtedly cause if the ground
was bare. The twelve or fourteen
inches of snow which fell the past
week insures a full crop of apples next
year. The shortage in the fruit crop
the past season was caused by the
ground being bare of snow last winter
up to the 23rd of December, inconse
quence of which the ground froze to a
depth of from six to ten inches. We
hailed the snow with delight, and
would have been pleased to see it two
weeks earlier.
This paper does not yield to anyone
in the pride it takes in Washington
and all of its worthy public citizens.
It would have rejoiced to see Mr. Sec
retary Ballinger come out of the Glavis
controversy "whiter than snow," but it
can not close its eyes to the fact that
the last number of Collier's magazine
contained very convincing proof of Mr.
Ballinger's wrong-doing,"not to use any
term more harsh. The standard of
civic righteousness set by Colonel
Roosevelt should weighl'against preju
dice, sympathy or pride. Every good
citizen should cry aloud, and spare not.
Mr. Ballinger has disappointed his own
people.
Can Mr. Chancellor Day witewash
the sugar trust? He has been elo
quently silent on the holiness of trusts
and the divinity of money for the past
few months. How much did'the sugar
trust give to the Syracuse university,
anyway? _______^_^_
Superintendent McDonald, of the
Wenatchee Valley & Northern railway,
tells The Echo that the spur from the
main line up to the head of main
Chumstick is just about completed.
The spur runs to Adams & Costello's
logging camp, where a hundred men
will be employed this winter in log
ging. A number of substantial houses
have been erected.for.the accommoda
tion of the men and teams as well as
for feed and supply storage. It is said
that a year or more will be consumed
in getting the logs from the vicinity,
there being several sections of good
timber to be logged off.

One or two parties who have been
living in Leavenworth the past summer
went to the Sound country some weeks
ago, claiming they did not like the
prospects of a Leavenworth snowy win
ter. The aforesaid parties are welcome
to their choice of a habitat. In the
past two weeks the Sound country has
had its annual flood, which was more
destructive than usual. A damage of
over a million dollars has been caused
to the coast lines between Tacoma and
Bellingham. Thousands of acres of
rich land in Snohomish and Skagit
counties have been inundated by both
salt and fresh water through the break
ing of dykes. Roads and bridges
have been washed away by the same,
and the loss of crops and other farm
property has been enormous. Heavy
rains and high tides have flooded Ho
quiam, South Bend, Aberdeen and
other tidewater cities, and to cap the
climax, a big fall in temperature the
past few days, with heavy snow storms
and high winds, have altogether made
the Puget Sound winter climate a
raging nightmare and a thing to be
dreaded, alongside the peaceful, quiet
snowfall at Leavenworth and an equa
ble temperature that is bracing and
enjoyable. Oh, you flood, fog and
mist victims of the Sound! Come to
Leavenworth and enjoy real decent
winter weather, where no such disa
greeable surprises are in store.

Notes from the Schools
Clare Burns re-entered the primary
grade this week, after an absence of
several weeks, a part of which time he
spent in the Twin Cities for medical
treatment.
Oeorge Hoxsey, who has been as
sisting at the Tumwater Savings Bank,
returned to school Monday.
Nora Debord, who was detained at
home a part of last week with a
sprained ankle, is in school again.
The following new names appeared
on the roll this week: Wallace Snyder,
from Everett, Wash.; Willie Carnahan,
Cascade Orchards; Helen, Paul, Harry
and Earl Osborne, recently from West
Virginia; Earl and Charlie Seagraves,
from Franklin Park, 111.
Last week a class in book-keeping
was organized, in which the pupils will
receive instruction in practical book
keeping, commercial law, business
forms, commercial paper and banking.
The deplorable accident Bessie Wal
ker met with Monday afternoon will
probably keep her from school for some
time.
Cleopatra
For nearly two thousand years it has
been common for men to say regret
fully that for a woman Anthony threw
a world away. Maybe it has all been
sympathy wasted. Old Plutarch was
not a bit sentimental, but his descrip
tion of Cleopatra makes it reasonably
clear that the woman had a more
masterful brain than the man and withal
a charm of womanhood well nigh
irristible. He admits that there were
more beautiful women, but he
adds: "The attraction of her person
joining with the charm of her conver
sation and the character that attended
all she said or did, was something be
witching. It was a pleasure merely to
hear the sound of her voice, with
which, like an instrument of many
strings, she could pass from one lang
uage to another; so that there were
few of the barbarous nations that she
answered by an interpreter; to most of
them she spoke herself, as to the
Ethiopians, Iroglodytis, Hebrews,
Arabians, Syrians, Medes, Parthians
and many others whose language she
had learnt." The rough Roman sol
diers under her spell gave a world for
her and thought the price was cheap.

SCURVY AMONG STARVING
I. W. W. PRISONERS
Spokane, Dec. S—Disease resembl
ing scurvy has broken out among
1. \Y. W. prisoners confined in the
old Franklin school building. It
is believed to be the result of lack
of vegetatble food. The gums of
three men have turned dark blue
and their teeth are so loose they
can scarcely keep them in their
sockets.
The police have reduced rations
in the effort to starve the revolu
tionists into submission to the anti
street speaking ordinance.
The Franklir* school building is
declared to be in a frightfully un
sanitary condition. It has not been
scrubbed since the prisoners were
taken there.
THE TAFT POLICIES
An Outline of the Recommendations
of the President to Congress in
His Annual Message.
Washington, Dec. 7.—The program
placed before congress by President
Taft in his annual message is the
most extensive and ambitious ever
proposed by a chief executive. It
even dwarfs the recommendations
made by Roosevelt. Ten main poli
cies are urged by the president, be
sides a list of minor items covering
routine matters and questions of
secondary importance. They are:
Supervision of the issue of stocks
and bonds by interstate corporations.
Readjustment of the duties and
powers of the interstate commerce
commission.
Expansion of the duties of the
bureau of corporations.
Creation of a new bureau in the
department of justice to deal with
violations of law by interstate car
riers.
Establishment of a go-called "rail
road court."
Amendment of the Sherman anti
trust law.
Creation of a postal savings bank.
Ship subsidies.
Amendment of the procedure re
garding the granting of injunctions.
Conservation of natural resources.
One of the minor policies favored
by the president is the consolidation
into a national health bureau of all
instruments for the investigation,
prevention and cure of disease,
which are now included in the na
tional government or may properly
be included.
Would Control Stocks.
The recommendation for the con
trol of the issue of stocks and bonds
by corporations is aimed at the
evil popularly known as stock water
ing, while those for the expansion
of the duties of the bureau of cor
porations and the creation of a new
bureau in the department of justice
to deal with violations of the anti
trust, anti-rebate and railroad laws
suggest closer inspection and con
trol of interstate corporations.
Those for the readjustment of the
duties and powers of the interstate
commerce commission, the creation
of a railroad court and the amend
ment of the Sherman anti-trust law,
are partially in line with Roosevelt's
plans and partially to the initiative
of President Taft himself. The work
ings of the railroad rate law have
not been entirely satisfactory in
practice, and this proposed legisla
tion is for the purpose of remedying
the defects in the act.
President Taft would divide the
executive and judicial functions of
the commission, giving the last
nameil to a court proper.
ONE KILLED, SEVEN HURT
Party of 13 Coasters Hurled into
Telephone Pole.
Portland, Dec. 6. —While dashing
wildly down a steep hill, a bobsled
carrying 13 young Portland pleasure
seekers careened from the beaten
path and crashed into a telephone
pole. The blow dashed one of the
occupants of the six coasters to
death, another, it is expected, will
not survive and others are injured.
Zelaya Seeks an Investigation.
Managua, Dec. s.—President Ze
laya has asked the United States
to send a commission to Nicaragua
to investigate conditions existing
here, and says that if its findings
show that his administration is det
rimental to Central America he will
resign. President Zelaya believes
the information sent to the United
States regarding cruelties practiced
by his government is prejudiced.
To Reduce Homestead Residence.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Senator Bo
rah will introduce a bill reducing the
homestead residence period on gov
ernment irrigation projects to three
years; a bill providing for aiding in
the development of towns on gov
ernment projects and a bill author
izing a $200,000 public building at
Twin Falls, Idaho.
GALLON GOODS
T)TD it ever occur to you that you can buy
- fruits and vegetables in gallon cans as
cheaply as you can put them up at home?
Owing to the short crop —especially peaches
—last season, we bought heavily in this line and
marked them at the usual retail figures notwith
standing the fact that the wholesale price was
much greater than for several years past.
For your convenience we give below an
itemized list of the line, followed by prices:
Peaches 50c. Pears 50c. Blackberries 60c.
Apricots 40c. Apples 40c. Cherries 60c.
Grapes 50c. Prunes 40c. Plums 40c.
Pumpkin 40c. Tomatoes 40c. Squash 40c.
And they are good, too. We trust you
will appreciate these exceedingly low prices and
give them a trial. The same thing in small cans
costs you more than three times as much.
Phone, leave, or give our solicitor an order
for gallon goods.
