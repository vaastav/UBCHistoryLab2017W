Mar.y Copper Ornaments of
Unique Shapes.
Hollered to Indtf-ate a Clone Connection
Betcreen the Ohio Mound Builders and
the Muct:an Indian A Number of
Skeletons Also Funnd Interesting De
velopmenti Expected.
Chilucot hk, O. . Doc. 1 3. The world's
Columbian exposition survey, under
Warren K. Mooreliead, at Anderson,
medt a discovery Thursday which ex
ceeded the finding of the king published
some time ago. In cut No 3, the same
mound from which the king was taken,
a mass of 120 unique copper objects were
found. Just below the deposit are skel
etons resting upon the hard floor of the
mound. These wall he taken out t nday.
The copiier objects represent fish, crosses,
combs, discs and combinations of squ tres
erect and crescents. They evince a do
gree of workmanship superior to that at
tained by Ohio Indians, and must have
come from a southern source, possibly
from Mexico. Conspicuous among them
were three splendid cuttings of the Swa
tisca cross. This type of cross is similar
to the early Greek cross. It is found on
the Patenque tablet, at Chiapas, Mexico.
This cross is frequently found in Yuca
tan. This throws great light on the religion
and travels of Ohio mound-building
clans. The fishes represented are ten
inches long, and have eyes worked in
repousse. All the objects are of sheet
copper, admirably executed. Circles
large as a plate, w ith leaves and hearts
worked within, were found. The spaces
between tho leaves and outer edge were
cut out, giving the affair the appearance
of a stencil. Anklets and bracelets of
massive copper, very like Etruscan or
early Egyptian. Hi the number of eigh
teen were uncovered. There were largo
ear-shaped copper ear-rings and wrist
ornaments found, consisting of two con
vex spools, joined by a cylinder. These
showed relief work, perioral ions, etc,
Ono large sheet of copper, tin eo feet in
length, was covered with beautifully cut
crescents, leaves and fish heads. Four
combs, representing an animal of the
cat family, with long teeth in the place
of legs, lay upon the sheet.
Never in te exploration of Ohio
mounds have such numbers of copper i
etligies and ornaments been found, ex
hibiting such symmetry of liiiih.
Jleusrs. Mooreliead and Cressou are of
the opinion that they were not made in
Ohio. When the king was found ho v;is
thought to be the greatest personage in
the mound. The skeletons to be uncov
ered Friday, having such a quantity of
copper above, may indicate higher chiefs
than he. None of the coppers could have
been manufactured with stone tools.
The designs are manifestly Mexican; the
Hwatiska cross, occurring four times,
fifteen feet below the surface, could not
have been made hy modern hands. The
copper is covered with verdigris, and has
every appearance of age. This cross
find may lead to the establishing of re
lationship between primitive man in
Ohio ami Mexico. The design cannot be
accidental, and will undoubtedly create
no little excitement in archieological cir
cles when the facts are fully known.
The survey will work for ono month
before completing the mound.
TEN NECKS SAVED
lly tlie Confession of Thornton Nance's
Murderer in South Carolina.
Columbia, S. C, Dec. Vi. One of the
most remarkable cases that has ever
come to light in this state developed in
the supreme court Wednesday, and as a
result the necks of tho ten colored men
under sentence of death in Laurens
county for the murder of Thornton
Nance some months ago will be saved.
They were sentenced to hang on Oct.
24 last, but tho attorneys appealed to
the supreme court and the motion
Wednesday was to suspend the hearing
in the supremo court and transfer it
buck to the circuit court. The ground
of this motion was the confession of an
other colored man. Henry Suber, who
was recently arrested, to the ell'eet that
he alone was the murderer. His affi
davit stated substantially that he was at
tho Pitts church on tlie night of tho
murder; that shortly after the meeting
ho started to his home and when about
a quarter of a mile from the church ho
was overtaken and assaulted by Nance.
Then and there he says he shot Nance
and killed him.
He says ho is not related to any of the
condemned men, but feels that it is his
duty to make known the facts, in order
that innocent men may not stiller on his
account. He says, further, that any
statement or statements that other per
sons were implicated in the killing but
himself are false, and com hides his affi
davit with the statement that, when the
time comes for the trial for his life, he
will irive all the details, and show that
there was absolutely no conspiracy. Me
gave this affidavit to the lawyers to e
used aw thev might think advisable for
the sake of humanity. The supreme
court Thursday decided the motion, and
sent the case to the circuit court for re
hearing. l.oulHville Fire lirtims.

IHfc POPE TU SJAY AT ROMe.
I" Anyone I.envea, 'Twill Re the King,
riays Mprr. O'Hryen.
New York. Dec. 12. The Rt. Rev.
ATgr. O'Bryen, one of the pope's cham
berlains, and who was sent by his holi
ness to settle an ecclesiastical dispute in
Canada and to represent the pope at the
Kolden jubilee of tho Most Rev. Arch
bishop Kenrick, of St. Louis, last
week, is stopping here. A reporter saw
him.
He was very willing to talk, and in an
swer to the first question regarding the
health of tho pope, said:
"The pope's health is very good. He
is able to walk about, but the doctors do
not allow him to do so, as they are afraid
he might overexert himself. He is often
carried when he might walk. There is
nothing the matter with him, but you
know, when a man gets to be over eighty
years old he must take very good care of
himself.
"Will ho leave Rome? Why certainly
not. He never had any intention of do
ing so. When he protests against two
sovereigns living there people jump to
the conclusion that the pope is going to
leafe. The pope has never entertained
the idea for an instant. King Humbert
is the one who must go. When Hum
bert goes then the strained relations
which have existed bet ween the Vatican
anil tlie government tor twenty years
can readilv bo arranired bv dinlomacv.
But it never will be until Humbert
goes.
"I do not know who will be nomi
nated for cardinals at the coming con
sistory. No, I do not think there will be
another American raised to that honor
just now."
"Why is it that the people of the
L nit ed States, who are so intensely re
publican, are always clamoring for roy
alty in the shape of princes of the
church? Cardinal Gibbous is very pop
ular with nil classes of the people and
has identified himself so closely with
your country and its institutions and yet
thev now want him to be pope, the
fulfillment of their wish would be the
worst possible thing that could happen
to you, because lie would have to leave
this count rv."

IILI'S STAND
Relative to Claims Against the
Country by Foreigners.
The Present Ministry Refuses
to Recognize Any.
They Claim Any Other Course Would Be
Discriminating Many of the Urltlsh
Claims Are No Doubt Just and Chill, In
the F.nil, Can Not Hefuse to Pay a Large
Proportion of tho Claims.
New Yohk, Dec. 12. A special cable
dispatch to The Herald from Valparaiso
says: '
Foreign Minuter Matta has idade a re
port to congress relative to the claims
made against Chili by foreigners, in
which he says the government is bound
in duty to administer strict justice. The
Chilian ministry, however, he adds, re
jects all attempts to formulate claims
which at tiints have been allowed in
America, owing to the special circum
stances under which the governments
against which such claims were pre
ferred were p.laced toward those in
whose favor they were formulated.
To countenance the present attempts
would be to create in favor of foreigners
privileges that are allowed neither by
state nor international law. While there
is no doubt, he concludes, that the claims
of prominent British merchants are in
several cases greatly exaggreated, still
in the end the Chilian government can
not refuse to pay a large portion of the
claims made for tlie sacking and looting
in Valparaiso, Vina del Mar and San
tiago, as well as for damages to tho ni
trate and the detention of steamers.
The Hritlsh Liar Again.
Valparaiso, Dec. 13. The statement
recenlly sent to tho London times by its
correspondent at Santiago, to the effect
that United States Minister Egan, dur
ing the recent correspondence between
the United States and the government
at Santiago, sent several insulting notes
to Minister of Foreign Affairs Matta,
which had caused a proposition to be
presented to the Chilian congress look
ing to the suppression of the Chilian le
gation at Washington, which proposi
tion had only been defeated by the gov
ernment exerting its influence to the ut
most, is unqualifiedly false. Tlie matter
has not been discussed by the govern
ment or by congress and all indications
point to a 'desire on the part of congress
to continue the amicuble relations
which have existed for so long with the
United States.
MORE TROUBLE IN BRAZIL.

Rio Janeiro, Dec. 12. Disagreements
have arisen between the government and
Senhor Portella, governor of the state of
Rio Janeiro. Tho differences are so rad

Governor Portella to resign his position.
This request the governor has declined
to accede to. It is now expected that
the government will appoint a military
governor of 'he state and that martial
law will lie proclaimed.
There is much uneasiness in financial
circles here growing out of the panic
which prevailed on tho bourse Thursday.
It is feared that in the event of a repeti
tion of the panic much trouble will be
caused for the banks, and consequently
guards have been detailed to protect
those institutions.
The government has announced that
tho credits for the repayment of a popu
lar loan have been guaranteed.

THOUGHT IT WAS A BOMB.
Steam Pipe Hursts In the National House
of Hepresentatives.
Washington, Dec. 12. A steam pipe
burst in the southeast corner of the hall
of the house of representatives before 1
o'clock Friday, causing great commo
tion. The house was not in session, but
many of the members were at their
desks, and the floor was crowded with
visitors. The report was very loud, and
the first thought whs that some crank
had set off a dvnamite bomb.
Memliers and others who were in that
portion oi me nan tuiuoieu over earn
other to get out, but no one was hurt.
Several ladies were sitting in the private
gallery immediately over the pipe which

steam began to rise in dense volume, but
in a short while every one knew what
the trouble was.
Joking with Dynamite.
Boston, Dec. 12. Dynamite, which

and while lvimr in his bunk he lighted
his pipe, which suddenly exploded taking
off the ends of ihreo of his fingers and a .
thumb and making a noie in uie iinru

marks of powder on tho hands it is sup
posed that dynamite was the cause of
the explosion, and that it was placed in

HARRISON'S CRANK.
tailing to det an Audience with
President lie Writes a Letter.
the
Washington, Dec. 12. A man giving
his namo as- Thomas Henry Mercer
Hogg was arrested a few days ago at
the White House while- endeavoring to
ram an audience with the president,
tnd he has been adjudged insane by a
Lioaru ot physicians.
Failing to gain admission to tho ex
ecutivo mansion, Hogg wroto a letter to
Sir. Harrison, which reads as follows:
Mr. Benjamin Harrison, President of the
United States:
Dear Si u What I, Thomas M. Hogg,
wishes to spake to you about is from the
time signed the declaration of my inten
tion to become a citizen of tho United
States of America. I have not had the pro
tection of a citizen in Kordham, the state
of New York, and in the city of New York
and in Bayonne, Jersey state, and In
Jlomestead, the state of Pennsylvania.
The time I came here was in October, lSH'.l.
j There are a number of persons after me,
I the same as in England and Ireland, ever
since 1NS2, and 1 ran not get a stop to the
same and me to Injoy the privileges of a
citizen of the I nited States.
Thomas Henry Mercer Hoiio,
Bricklayer, 109 D street, N. W.
He enclosed a letter addressed to the
lord lieutenant of Ireland, which he
requested to be forwarded to that offi
cial. Hogg is about twenty-eight years
old, and had $121 in currency in his
pockets when taken into custody.
Ho could not be induced to tell whore
he lived, but it is supposed from papers
which he had about him that he came
from Foruham, N. Y.
THE RUSSIAN JEWS.
Congress to Give F.arly Attention to the
Kusslan Persecutions.
Washington, Dec. 12. One of the
first subjects to occupy attention of the
foreign affairs committeo after the or
ganization of the committees of the
house by Speaker Crisp will be that of
the harsh treatment of Hebrews by Rus
sia. This question will be earnestly
pressed upon the attention of the com
mittee, and it will lie urged to go as far
as possible in expressing its sympathy
with the Russian Hebrews in their dis
tress, and to take such measures con
sonant with the uses of diplomacy as
will tend to secure an amelioration of
their condition. This government will
lie asked to continue the use of its good
offices as an intercessory with the czar
in behalf of the Hebrews. The president
in his message devoted some space to
the question of the wholesale banish
ment of Jews from Russia and to the en
deavors which this government had thus
far put. forth in their behalf. The sub
ject will be brought to the attention of
the committee probably by the introduc
tion of a formal resolution, but the cus
tomary distribution of the various por
tions of th president's message, will
bring the matter before the committee
in the absence of any resolution what
ever. RECIPROCITY WITH GERMANY.

Washington, Dec. 13. The state de

New York, Dec. 12. District At
torney Ridgway, of Kings county, Is far
from being satisfied with the verdict of
"not guilty" rendered by the jury in thn
case of Darwin J. Meserole. "JsTever in
the history of Kings county," he said
Thursday, "lias a rich man's son been
convicted of homicide. This was a cold-!
blooded murder, and the lawyer for the 1
defense was afraid to put Meserole upon
the stand. You may put me down as sav
ing that a Brooklyn jury can not be
found to convict a rich man's son."

A Destructive Storm Again
Sweeps Orcr England
Doing Great Damage to Ship
ping and Other Property.
Several Years of Uninterrupted Prosper
ity Will He Necessary In the Agricul
tural Districts to Make Vp for the
Losses Incurred This Tear Numerous
Wrecks Iteported on the Coast.
London, Doc. 12. The severe storm
which has been raging over the British
Isles for the past forty -eight hours con
tinues, with unabated violence, to cause
much damage to shipping and other
property. Floods in various parte of
England are again playing a prominent
part in the work of destruction and are
inflicting further damage upon the farm
ers, who have already suffered bo much
this year. In fact, several years of un
interrupted prosperity will be necessary,
in many districts, to make tip for what
the agricultural communities have lost
this year owing to the series of fearful
storms which have swept over the land.
The heavy stone walls by which the
greater portion of the city of Chester is
enclosed, have subsided in some parts
owing to their having been undermined
by the furious gales and heavy floods of
the past few days.
The gale which began Thursday night
coutinues with increased violence and is
raging with unabated vigor; also, In
Ireland, Scotland and Wales. A num
ber of small craft and fishing boats are
reported lost. Telephone and telegraph
wires and poles have been blown down
in all directions and only meager reports
from outside points can be obtained.
From the little news that has been ob
tained it is shown that the damage al
ready done is very heavy. The Leonore,
which was last seen at 1 o'clock Friday
morning, has entirely disappeared from
view.
At Liverpool.
The following was received from Liv
erpool Friday:
ihe gale which has Been Drevauinar
over Great Britain during the past forty
eight hours has increased here to te
fury of a hurricane todav. the wind
blowing at the rate of eighty-five miles
an hour. An immense amount of dam
age has been done, and numerous
wrecks are reported, the most important
being the steamer Eiffel Tower, which
