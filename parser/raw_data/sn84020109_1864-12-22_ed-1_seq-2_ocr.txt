nHOWNVILLE, THURSDAY iEC. 22, 1S54.
Again do we appear before the ii'imer
ous readers figuratively speaking of
the Nebraska Advertiser. Having, in
connection with Geo. W. Hill, bought out
the entire establishment fcf W.H. Miller
his good will thrown in occemore do
we assume the honorable,- if ijot lucrative,
position of editor. And, as is customery,
it behoovos ts to brieflly itate the prin
ciples upon which the paper thaii be run
while in our control.
First, then, we shall always bear in
in;nd, and tling firmly to our motto :
'Liberty and Union one and insepara
ble now and forever !"
Second, we shall fuslain the Adminis
tration cf Abraham Lincoln, in its every
attempt to whip the rebels. Loyalty ha
triumphed over northern dough-faced
traitors in Abraham Lincoln's re-eleciicn
and it will triumph over southern treason
only in sustaining Lim. Ve are opposed
to party strife until the strife against
treason is ended, and do not think any
man, or set cf men. trully loyal who will
eiop to quarrel over petty party issues
while our common enemy treason is
ttill alive.
Third, vre shall do all that lies in our
power to further the best interest of our
City, County ad Territory.
Fourth, we shall keep our readers
posted in the Iastest news of importance,
either foreign or local.
Fifth, and last, we shall do all in our
power to make the Advertiser worthy of
the support of every loyal citizen of Ne
maha, or any other county. Being both
of us practical printers, we will give you
. as much reading matter as we can possi
bly set up, We expect To "build up" the
Advertiser, and to that end we .respect
fully solicit the patronage and assistance
of every Icyal citizen of this county.
The prospect'of Missouri becoming a
free State is very good, and must be
gratifying to all who truly love freedom.
But, aa there is a culminating point to all
good, which, when once reached, makes
ny step beyond rediculous and abortive
of the main object, so, even this act of
mcdrn progress may result in a serious
injury to the white race in that State.
These ideas were induced by a perusal
of argument in favor of negro suffrage
in Missouri. Radicalism has accomplish,
ed much for Missouri, and the border
States generally; a wide field is still
left for its operation ; but if this stand is
tsdeen, and they should succeed, we be
lieve that its consequences would dim the
glory of their first great achievement.
But a few few years eince, in many
sections of that State, it was almost as
much as a man'slife was worth to even
mention abolition, and, yet, now the ques
tion ef negro suffrage is seriously dis
cussed. Th:r3 is a vital question to the
white race generally, as the benefit is
all on one tide, and desirable only to
the negro and a few (we hope) who
are willing to barter their self-respect
in order to increase the population of
Missouri by making her a negro colony.
Advocating the enfranchisemen of ne
groes in Missouri, the Philadelphia Am
erican and Gazette says ;
'If this change were made in the laws
cf Missouri, there can hardly be a doubt
that thousands of educated colored men
of properly and standing would emigrate
thither from States which, like Pennsyl
vania and Illinois, refuse thera.the right
of suffrage. Thousands' of colored peo
ple would also go thither from Kentucky.
Tennessee and Arkansas; and with an
abundance of cheap labor, a vast amount
ef land would be broughrdnder cultiva
tion, railroads built and mines opened.
The movement is therefor one of prime
importance to the future of Missouri,
end marks a new era in the history of
the nest.-'
Yes, with a very black "mark."
The fellowing we find in the Nebras
ka City Daily News, of the 19th :
a
"And so come our abolition friends
and demand a change among the "loyal"
lists of oxhce-holding patriots in Nebras
ka. Among other schemes there is one
to oust Mr. Paddock from the Secretary
ship and put in some man who can be
made more subservient than he can to
the faction now rulirg among ihe faith
ful." This canard was doubtless intended, by
its auther, to create a profound sensation
among "the faithful," perhaps it may,
but in this section, we know it will be
one of contempt for the snarling dispo
fition of Ajax,
Sec. Paddock's administration of our
financial affairs, gentlemanly conduct,
and ability displayed in every depart
mant of his office, have stamped him as
one "honest and capable." We know
that such a move, as. that spoken of above,
will meet with no favor in this county.
Ajax : Don't you think Sec. Paddock
will administer such an "oath" to the
members of the next Legislature as will
"ccmpell" thitn to remain f ix session in
definitely ?

The Latest News.
Washington, Dec. IB.
The following has been received at
the War Department : f
Nashville, 9, p. m., I5ih. We attack
ed the enemy's left this morning and
drove it from the river below the city,
very nearly to Franklin pike, a distance
of about eight- mils, and have captured
Chalmer's headquarters, a train of about
20 W8gcns, between eight hundred and
thousand prisoners, and sixteen piecss of
artillery.
Our troops behaved splendidly, all ta
king a share in assaulting and charging
the enemy's breastworks.
I shall attack the enemy'again in the
morning, if he staods to fight, if he re-
Ltreats dunag the night I shall pursue. I
have, been throwing a heavy cavalry
force in his rear to destroy his trains if
possible.- Signed,
. THOMAS.

The American's Annapolis special says:
The steamer Havana has just arrived
with the news that Sherman had cap
tured Savannah, with 1500 prisoner, af
ter eight hours hard fightiig.
Washington, 16.
Richmond papers state that on the
9th Sherman captured Ft, McAllester,
commanding the entrance to Ogeeche
river, that the capture of this position
puts Sherman in communication with the
Yankee fleet and necssitates reinforce
ments to Savannah.
The following unofficial dispatch has
been received at the War Department :
Nashville, 16, 2 p. m. Hood has fal
len back, apparently doing his best to get
away, while Thomas is pressing him with
great vigor ; frequently capturing giins
and men. Everything so far perfectly
successful. Signed,
STANTON.
Washington, 17.
The following official report of the
great victory achieved yesterday, by
Thomas and his gallant army, over the
rebel forces under Hood, in front of
Nashville, was received this morning al
the War Department;
I have the honor to report the enemy
has been pressed at all points to-riay on
his line cf retreat to Bectwood Hill.
Brig. Gen. Hatch of the Wisconsin corps
of cavalry on the right turned the ene
my's left, and captured a large number
rf prisoners. Number not yet reported.
Maj. Gen. Schofields corps, next on the
left of the line, carried several hills and
captured many prisoners and six pieces
of artillery. Brevet Msj, Gen. Smith,
next on the left of Schofield, carried the
salient points of the enemy's line with
MuNellis' brigade of McArthur's divi
sion, capturing 16 pieces cf artillery,
two Brig. Generals, aud about 10C0 pris
oners. B'ig. Gen. Garrard's diviaion of
Smith's command, next on ihe left of Mc
Anhur.s division, carried the enemy's
entrenchments, capturing all the artille
ry aud troops of the enemy on the line.
Brig. Geu. Wood's troops on Franklin
pike, took up the assault, capturing the
pnemv's entrenchments and two pieces
of, artillery and something over 600 pris
oners, aaJ drove tbe enemy wimin one
mile ef Brentwood Hill. . ,
Maj. Gen. Steadinan, commanding de
tachment of different military divisions,
most nobly supported Gen. Wood's left,
and bore a most honorable part in the
operations cf the day
. 1 have ordtred the pursuit to be con
tinued ' in the morning at daylight, al
though the troops are very much fatigue d
The utmost enthusiasm prevails.
I must not forget to report the epera
tious of Brig. Gen. Johnson, in success
fully driving the enemy, with the co-ope
ration of gunboats under commodore
Smith, from their established batteries on
the Cumberland river, below the city of
Nashville ; and of the success of Brig.
Gen. Caxon's brigade in covering our
right and rear in the operations of yes
terday and to day.
THOMAS.
Since the above was in type we have
have received news more definite:
The total number of prisoners captur
ed during the two days fight near Nash
ville was 6,500, and on the morning' of
the 19ihour forces in pursuiet captured
3 00C. During the battle 30 guns anl
7,000 small arms were captured. Hoed'
army is reported entirely demoralized
and at Duck river, crossing as fast as
possible. His loss is at least 15.000 since
he advanced from Columbia to Nashville.
From Sherman the news is most en
couraging. There is no doubt of his
having opened communication viith Fo.s
tef and the fleet. The city of Savannah
is completely invested, and even Rich
mend papers admit that its fall is inevita
ble. Sherman started from Savannah
with only 200 and retched Savnnnah ; so
much was capturod on the way that it be
came an embarrassment. Seven tfcoui
sand able-bodied negroes came away
with his army. Ilia whole loss, during
the march from, Atlanta, from all causes,
is only about 1000.
Everything is progressing favorable
before Petersburg. Graat got off his
joke again in honor of Thomas's victory,
by firing a salute of .100 shotted guns in
to the rtbel lines.
There is a large amount of counter
feit postal currency in circulation at pres
ent, especially twenty-five cent pieces.
They are of the new issue, and the pa
per and printing poor, tut when they be
come worn, it is difficult' to distinguish
them fr6m the genuine.
One of the most dangerous counter
feits we have yet seen, is a S20f green
back shown us yesterday by J. L- O'NeiL
Cashier of. the Western Bank. It is fur
superjor.to tne old counterfeit, na is well
calculated te deceive. The engraving is
coarser than the genuina, and the- red
star on the face beats a dull brick color1,
while the genuine is a bright scarlet.
Look well to your S20's. St. Joe. Her
ald. Navigation of the Yellow Stune
River.
Captain Hutchison, commander of the
Idaho fleet which left the Upper Mis
souri last spring- with gold hunters by
way of the Missouri and Yellow Stone,
has returned to St. Paul. He has open
ed up a new water highway towards the
North-west Pacific slope which promises
to be of great value in developing the re
source or. thai almost unknown region.
One of his fleet, the Chippewa Falls
was the ' first . steamer whose paddia
wheels ever stirred the waters of the
Yellow Stone. Captain II. run up feme
fifty miles the first trip, finding about
four feet of water and the navigation of
one of the largest rivers of the north
west practicable. The river is described
ftsalout tue size of the Mississippi above
the falls of St. Anthony, and about as
crooked. It is not so inuidy as the Mis
souri, nor so full of snags, has some bars,
but the most obstructions arise from,
rocks, however, not dangerous. It
is bordered with heavy timbered bottom
lands, back of which are bluffs which
seem quite barren. The Yellew Stone
is thought to be navigable for small
boats as far as the mouth of the Big
Horn, where a town is growing up.
The second trip up the Yellow Stone
was made by two steamers of the'fleet
to the old trading post, ninety miles
from the Fort.- One of the fleet ran
up the Missouri to Fort Benton several
hundred miles above the mouth of the
Yeilow Stone. The crew and engineers
ran off te the gold mines, and the steam
er was left tied up to the bank under
the Fort. In the spring an effort will
be made to bring her down. Omaha

Ihe President's Message.
We give below that portion of the
Message devoted to our own country and
the war, in which we presume our read
ers feefthe" greatest interest: ';
The war continues. Since the last an
nual message, ail the important lines and
positions then occupied by our armies
have steadily advanced, thus liberating
the regions left in the rear, so that Mis
souri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts
of other States, have again produced
reasonably fair crops.
The most remarkable feature of
ihe , military - operations of ihe year
is Gen. Sherman's attempted march
cf 300 miles dirtctly through" the
insurgent region. It tends to show a
great increase of our relative strength
that our General-in-Chief should feel
able to confront and hold in check every
active force of the euemy and yet to de
tach a well appointed army to move on
such an expedition. ' The result not yet
being known conjecture in regard to it
js not here indulged. Important move
ments have also occurred during the
year to the effect of moulding society for
durability in the Union, although' ehort
of complete success it is much in the right
direction that 12,000 citizen in each of
the Slates of Arkausas and Louisiana
have organized loyal State Governments
with free constitutions and are earnestly
struggling to maintain and administer
theuu yhe movement in the same di
rection, more extensive, though les3 defi
nite in Missouri, Kentucky and Tennes
see should not be overlooked but Mary
land' is secure to liberty Union for all the
future. The. genius of rebellion will no
more claim Maryland like another foul
spirit being driven out, it will seek to
tear her, but it will woe her no more.
' At the last session of Congress a pro
posed amendment of ihe Constitution,
abolishing slavery throughout the United
States, pnaatd the Senate, but failed for
a lack of a two-third vote in the House.
I venture to recommend tha passage of
the measure at the present Congress.
Of course the attract question is not
changed, but au intervening election
shows almost certainly that the next Con
gress will pass the measure if this dees
not. Henca there is only a question of
time as to when the proposed amend
ment will go to ihe States fcr their ac
tion, and a-i it is to go at all even's, may
we no agree that Hie sooner the better?
It is not claimed that the election has
imposed a duty on members to change
their views or their vot s aiy fu ther
than as an additional element to be con
sidered. Their Judgement maybe af
fected by it. '
It is the voice of tha People now for
the first time heard upon the question.
In a great National crisis like ours, una
nimity of action among those staking a
common end is very desirable almost in
dispensable, and yet no approach to such
unanimity is attainable unless some de
ference fchall be paid to the will of. the
majority, simply because it is the will of
the majority.
In this case the common end is the
maintenance of ihe Union, and among
the means to-secure that end, such will,
through the election, is m jt clearly de
clared in favor cf sich constitutional
c-wlavact. ..Tho ut re liable indiea-.
tion of public purpose in this country is
derived through cur popular elections.
Judging by th9 recent canvass and its
result, the purpose ef -.he pecple within
ihe loyal States to maintain the integrity
of the Union was nevermore firm, nor
more nearly unanimous than now.
The extraordinary calmness aud good
order with which the millions of voters
met and mingled at the polls, gave
strong assurance cf this. Not only
those who support the Union ticket so
called, but a great majority of the
opposing party also may be fairly
claimed lo be actuated by the 6ame pur.
pose. It is an unanswerable argumen
that no candidate for any office whatev
er high or low, has ventured to seek
votes on the avowal that was for giving
up tne Union.
The election has exhibited another
fact not less valuable to be known the
fact that we do not approach exhaustion
in the most important branch of the na
tional resources, that of living men.
While it is melancholy to reflect that
the war has filled so many graves, and
caused mourning to so many homes, it is
some relief to know ihat, compared
with the surviving, the fallen have been
so few. While corps and divisions brig
ades and regiments have formed and
f aught and bled.Snd gone out of exis
tence, a great majority of the men who
composed them are still living. The
same is true of the Naval service. The
election returns prove this. So many
States regularly holding elections, both
now aud four years ago, to-wit: Cali
fornia, Cojineiicut. Delaware, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Mary
land, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minne
sota, Missouri, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Ore
gon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Ver
mcntjlVes; -Virginia and Wisconsin cast
3.9S-2. UU votes now against 3,770.222
cast, then, showing an aggregate now of
3.39S.211, to which is to be added 33.
762 cast now in the new states of Kan
sas and Nevada, which States did not
vote in 1860; thus swelling the aggregate
to 4,075,773, and the net .increase du
ring the three years and a half of war to
145,951.
To this, again, should be added the
number of all soldiers in the fieid from
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jer
sey, Delavvare,Indiana, Illiuois and Cal
ifornia, who, by the laws of those States,
could not vo:e away from their homes,
and which nimb-jr cannot be less than
90,000. Nor yetis this all. The num
ber in organized Territories is tripple
now what it was four years ago, while
thousands white anl black join U3 as
the national arms press back the insur
gent lines.- So much is shown affirma
tively and negatiyelly y the election.
It is not material to squire how the
increase has been produced, or to show
that it would have been greater but for
the war, which is. probacy true, the
important fact remains Remonstrated
that we hava more men nowhan we had
when, the war began; that Ve are not
exhausted nor in process of Vxhaustion;
that we are gaining strengthjand may",
if need, be, maintain the comes, jndefin
itly. This is to a man. '
Natural resources ore now mie com
plete and abundant than ever. The na
tional resources, men, inexnausiaoie.
The public purpose to re-establish and
maintain the national authority is un
changed, and, as we bejieve, unchange
able The manner of continuing the ef
fort remains to chpose. On careful con
sideration of al: the evidences accessible,
it seems tome that no attempt at nego
tiation with the insurgent leader could
result any good:
He would except or nothing short of
the severance of the Union. His dec
larations to this efleot are explicit and
oft-rf peated. He does not attempt to
deceive us. Jlo affords us no excuse to
deceive - ourselves. We cannot volun
tarily yield it. Between him and us the
issus is distinct, simple and inflexible.
II is an issue which an only be tried by
war, and decided by victory.
If we yield W8 are beaten; If the
Southern people fail him, he is beaten:
either way it would be the victory and
defeat following war. War is true.how
ever, of him who holds the insurgent
cause, is not necessarily true of those
who follow. Although ha cannot reac
cept the Union, they can. Some of them
we know, already desire peace and re
union. The 'number of such may in
crease. They can at any moment have peace,
simply by laying down their arms and
submitting to ihe National authority un
der the Constitution. After so much the
Government could not, if it would, main
taiti waragaiust them. The loyal peo
pie, would not sustain or allow it. If
questsons should remain we would adjust
them by the peaceful means of legisla
tion, cjnference, courts and votes.
Operating only in constitutional and
lawful channels, some certain and other
possible questions are and would be be
yond the Executive power to adjust; for
instance; the admission of members into
Congress, and whatever might require
appropriation., of money.
The Executive power itself would be
deminished bv the cessation of actual
war. ' Pardons and remissions of for
feiture, however, would still , be under
Executive control. In what spirit and
temper this centre! would be exercised
can by fairly judged of by the past. A
year ago general terms were offered to
all except -certain designated classes,and
it vvaJ at the same time made known that
the excepted class were still within con
teinplation of special clemency.
During the year many availed them
selves of the general provision, and many
more would, only the signs of bad faith
in some led to such precautionary meas
ures as rendered the practical process
less easy and certain. During the same
time also, special pardons have eeen
granted to individuals of excepted class
es, and no voluatery application baa been
denied. .
Thus practically the door has been for
a full year open to all, except such as
rwere not in condition to make free
choise; that is, such as were in custody
or under constraint. It is still open to
all, but the time may come, probably
will come, when public duty shall de
mand that it be closed, and that in lieu
more vigorous, . measures than hereto
fore shall be adoptedl
In presenting the abandonment of
armed resistance of the National au
thority uu iLe pari of ihe insurgents
condition to ending the war on the pari
of the Government, I retract nothing
heretofore said as to Slavery. I repeat
the declaration made a year ago, and
and that while I remain in my present
position. 1 shall not attempt to retract
or modify the Emancipation Proclamation
Nor shall I return to Slavery any per
son who is free by the terms of that
Paclamation or by the Acs of Lon
grt3. .
If Mie people should, by whatever
raoda or taeans, make it as executive du
ly to re-emlave such person?, another,
and net I, must be their instrument to
perform it.
In staling a single condition of peace,
I mean simply to say, that the war will
cease on the part of the Government
whenever .it shall have eeased on the
part of those who began it.
