Partial Text of President's Message to Congress
Tt u -with this nurnose in mind that
i called a conference to meet in Wash
ington, Dec. 1, to consider these prob
lems In all their broad aspects, with
the Idea of bringing about a better un
derstanding between the two interests.
The great unrest tnrougnoui me
world, out of which has emerged a de"
xn&nd for an immediate consideration
of the differences between capital ana
labor, bids us put our own house in
order. Frankly there can be no PBr
manent lasting settlements between
capital and labor which do not recog
tiz e the fundamental concepts, for
which labor has been struggling
through the years.
World-Wide View.
The whole world gave its recogni
tion and indorsement to these funda
mental purposes In the league of na,
tions. The statesmen gathered at
Versailles recognized the fact that
orld stability could not be bad by
reverting to industrial standards and
conditions' against which the average
workman of the world had revolted.
It is, therefore, the task of the states
men of this new day of change and re
adjustment to recognize world condi
tions and to seek to bring about,
through legislation, conditions that
will mean the ending of age-long an
tagonists between capital and labor
and that will hopefully lead to the
building up of a comradeship which
tovlll result not only in greater con
tentment among the mass of work
men but also bring about a greater
production and a greater prosperity to ,
business Itself,
To analyze the particulars In the de-1
mands of labor is to admit the Justice
ot their complaint In many matters
that lie at their basis. The workman
demands an adequate wage, sufficient
to permit him to live in comfort, un
hampered by the fear of poverty and
a want in his old age. He demands
the right to live and the right to work
amid sanitary surroundings, both in .
home and in workshop, surroundings
that develop and do not retard his own
health and well being and the right to ,
provide for his children's wants in the '
matter of health and eddcatian. In !
other words. It Is his desire to mane ,
the conditions ot his life and the lives
of those dear to him tolerable and easy j
to bear. 1
The establishment or tne principles
regarding labor laid down in the cov
enant ot the league of nations offers
us the way to Industrial peace and1
conciliation. No other road lies openj
f- ?. Not to pursue this one is-long-i
fer to Invite enmities, bitterness and
antagonisms which in the end only
lead to industrial and social disaster.
The unwilling workman is not a prof-,
itable servant. An employe whose in
dustrial life is hedged about by hard
and unjust conditions, which he did
not create and over which he has no
control, lacks that fine spirit of en
thusiasm and volunteer effort which
are the necessary ingredients ot a
great prdoucing entity.
Need of Frankness.
Let us be frank about this solemn
matter. The evidences of vorldwide
unrest which manifest ther" elves in
violence throughout the world bid ns
pause and consider the means" to be
found to stop the spread of this con
tagious thing befor& it saps the very
vitality of he nation itself. Do we
gain strength by withholding the rem
edy? Or is it not the business of
statesmen to treat these manifesta
tions of unrest which meet us on
every hand as evidences of an econ
omic disorder and to apply construc
tive remedies wherever necessary, be
ing sure that in the application of th?
remedy we touch not the vrf al tissues
of our industrial and economic life."
There can be no recession of the tide
of unrest until constructive instrumen
talities are set up to stem that tide.

to protect all of its people ana to as
sert its power and majesty against the
challenge ot any class.
The government, when . it asserts
that right, seeks not to antagonize a
class, but simply to defend the right
of the whole people as against the ir-
reparable harm and injury that might
be done by the attempt by any class
to usurp a power that only government
itself has a right to exercise as a pro
tection to all. ' 1 .
In the matter of International dis
putes which have led to war, states
men have sought to set up as a remedy
arbitration for war. Does this not'
point the wy for the settlement of
industrial disputes, by the establish
ment of a tribunal, fair and Just alike
to all. which will settle Industrial
disputes which in the. past have led
to war and disaster.
Must Master Itself.
America, witnessing the evil conse
lauences which have followed out of
such disputes between the contending
forces, must not admit itself Impotent
;to deal with these matters by means
jof peaceful processes. Surely there
must be some method of bringing to
gether in a council of peace and amity
these two great interests, out of which
will come a happier day of peace and
co-operation, a day that will make far
more comfort and happiness in living
and a more tolerable condition among
all classes of men. Certainly human
intelligence can devise some accept
able tribunal for adjusting the differ-
encefl Detween capital and labor.
This is the hour of test and trial for
America. By her prowess and strength
and the Indomitable courage ot her
soldiers, she demonstrate1 her power
to vindicate on foreign battle fields
her conception Of liberty and Justice
Let not her influence as a mediator
between capital and labor be weaken
ed and her own failure to settle
matters of purely domestla concern be
proclaimed to the world.
There are those In this country who
threaten- direct action to force their
will upon a majority. Russia today,
with its blood and terror, is a painful
object lesson of the power of minori-
ties u roake8 little difference what
minority It Is, whether capital or labor,
or ther class, no sort of prlvllego
will ever be permitted to dominate
this country. "
We are a partnership or nothing that
is worth while. We are a democracy,
where the majority are the masters, or
all the hopes and purposes of the men
who founded this government have
been defeated and forgotten. In Amer
ica there is but one way by which
great reforms can be accomplished and
the relief sought by classes obtained,
and that !s through the orderly pro
censes of representative government.
Thor who would propose any other
method of reform are enemies of thJs
country. America will not be daunted
by threats nor lose her composure or
clamness in these distressing times.
We can afford, in the midst of this
day of passion and unrest, to be self
contained and sure.
The instrument of all reform In
America is the, straight road of Justice
to all classes and conditions of men.
Men have but to follow this road to
realize the fufl -fruition of their ob
jects and purposes. Let those beware
who would take the shorter road of
disorder and revolution. The right
road is the road of justice and orderly
process.
