A well known writer declares that
the only thing the matter with this i
country is the enormous increase in
population without proportionate in
crease in the number engaged In ag
riculture. Something over a century
ago 90 per cent of the American people
were living on farms while today not
more than 33 per ce Jt may be so classi
fied. There are a good many contri
buting reasons for this growing dis
parity, yet few writers take into ac
count the most important, and that is
the fact that modern machinery, has
made is possible for one man to do the
pork of half a dozen in the growing
crops.
I.aFollette.
Senator. La Follette's bitter attitude
toward the Taft administration is
doubtless correctly reported. One gets
it from various sources. 6ays the
Springfield Republican, that the insur
gents have returned to Washington
for the session in a jubilant state of
mind over the result of the elections.
A certain member of the old guard now
on the scene has sarcastically said
that he would not be surprised to see
some insurgent introduce a resolution
congratulating the democrats upon
their victory. Republicans like Sena
tors La Follette and Cummins evident
ly regard the political revolution as a
necessary preliminary to the capture
of the republican party by their own
wing and their own advancement to
the dominating places of leadership.
As for Mr. La Follette, there is no liv
ing republican strong enough to pre
vent him froni seeking the national
leadership for himself, regardless of
the effect upon the Taft administra
tion. Colonel Roosevelt has very little
control over him; indeed, in Wiscon
sin the senator is undoubtedly stronger
than the ex-president. But, as things
are, tne ex-presment is not HKeiy to
make any effort to restrain the activi
ties or curb the ambition of the Wis
consin leader.
Senator La Follette is nominally a
republican; in reality, he is a free
lance and in business for himself.
Uniformity of Laws.
It is when the governors of the var
ious states get together, as they have
at" Frankf6"rt, that there is impressed
on the country the necessity of more
uniformity in laws which govern the
commonwealths of the nation. The
governors have had forced on their at
tention the manifold annoyances which
result from lack of uniformity, and
their combined experiences make a
formidable argument for this simple,
common sense reform.
In the early days, when there was
comparatively little travel and men
seldom changed their place of resi
dence from one state to another, uni
formity in state laws was not a ser
ious question. In those days there
most all or them were based on tho
old common law, they did not differ
radically. What inconvenience was
caused by the different conditions in
different states was trivial.
With the growth of transportation
and other facilities for interstate com-
tjgtUriflaUon)tath4et6sh.aa-been a -gradual
wiping out of state lines in trade and .
disappearance of boundaries in the so- j
clal life of the people. We retain our
pride of state, but a considerable num
ber of us live in or do business in two
or more commonwealths, and find con
flicting laws an absurd restriction on
our activities. As an instance, stat
utes covering commercial transactions
create a' lot of trouble and unnecessary
work because they are not uniform
throughout the nation.
One purpose in getting the gover
nors together in annual conference was
to have them suggest means for se
curing the adoption of uniform laws
on such subjects as demand legislation
of this character. Their recommenda
tions along this line ought to carry
weight with the various state assem
blies. . '
Cheerfulness at Christmas Time.
Mrs. Franci3 Hodgson Burnett has
been crowned the queen of cheerful
ness, an honor indeed enviable.
In a dispatch from Boston Fhe is
quoted as saying"cheerfulness is the
religion of which I am the apostle.
It is the greatest of- qualities except
love. People 6hould forget their devils
and keep their pink lamps lighted.
That is a little word among my friends.
A pink lamp always makes everything
look lovely. So we'll tell each other
all the nice things whenever we can.
You must sacrifice everything to hap
piness." Cheerfulness, is the motive power
cf the world. It is the great lamp
from which gleams the light that illum
inates the universe. It is kept burn
ing by love.
But for fear of growing senti
mental one may return to Mrs. Bur
nett's especially pertinent suggestion
that "if you are happy you know you
are bound to be good, for you can't be
happy unless you are good."
That indeed is the essence of hap
piness. Its application may indeed be
urged in this glad Christmas season.
Let Christmas mean what it really
is happiness, love, charity, '""hristi
anity. Let us be cheerful ourselves,
but unselfish in our cheerfulness. Let
us make ourcslves more cheerful by
making others happy. Let there be
some practical charities that will reach
the homes of the poor, lighten the
darkness of the wretched, inspire hope
in the souls of the discouraged and
contribute to the wants of those in
-distress and who, through thMr own
misfortune or of those upon whom thej
are dependent, dread Christmas be

Harpers Weekly: We are drinking
more alcoholic drinks than ever
more not only in gross, but per capita.
'So the internal revenue bureau says
after totaling up its receipts for the year
i eauing on cue oum ot last June. Mere i
is its report of some of the products
that paid taxes:
16.1,000,(100 gallons of distilled
spirits, 3ft,ono.oon gallons more
than the year before.
59,485,117 barrels of fermsnted
liquors, an increase of 3,000,000
barrels.
7,600.000.000 cigars, 160,000,000
than in 1909.
6,830,000,000 cigarets, an in
crease of 1.000,000,000.
402,000,000 pounds of plug, fine
cut, cube cut, granulated, or sliced
smoking or chewing tobacco or
snuff. 4.000,000 pounds more thau
the year before.
141,862.282 pounds of oleomar
garine, 50,000,000 pounds increase.
It appears that the consumption of
spirits increased last year by over 20
per cent. Perhaps taxes were paid on
more liquor than was drunk, but the
payments from year to year are a
pretty close measure of consumption.
That drinking should increase in the
face of such prohibition and local op
tion legislation causes some astonish
ment, but it is not, we believe, con
trary to experience. Legislation may
have an effect on manners, methods
and details of consumption, but it
does not change habits. Prohibition,
if Maine is any criterion, does not help
at all in promoting temperance. Local
option may do good, but it is more
likely to benefit the rising generation
than the one whose habits are formed.
It is possible that in spite of the
internal revenue figures the manner
of drinking may be improved and the i
drinks distributed.
It bears on this subject that of the
9.000.000 of population in New York
state 7.000,000 live in cities. Local
option in this state is confined to coun
try townships. The increase of city
population all over the country has
doubtless a relation to this inqrease
in the consumption both of alcohol
and tobacco. The nervous tension of
city life is sreater than of country
life, calling more for stimulants, and
affording more convenient opportun
ities to get them. Drinking and smok
ing, too, are both social practices, and
there Is more society in the cities than
in the country.
The consumption of spirits has In
creased more in proportion than the
consumption of beer, and the consump
tion of cigarets more than cigars. 1 The
report Is not complimentary to legis
lation. :

"Gir!V said Sadie Armsby to half

Christmas, "it's a crying thame for

"It isn't meanness," said Martha

"I should think." remarked Miss
'Armsby, "tht if he's such a stickler
for honorable conduct some girl who
would be above making conquests for
fun would be more likely to succeed
with him."
"Oh, Sadie," pretested Miss Quigley,
uyou make me tired: lo you think a
aian Is drawn by a woman's honorable
conduct? Send him a fascinator and
the more dishonorably she treats him
the quicker she'll snare biin."
One of those prattlers, a bosom friend
of Miss Loroy, was commissioned to
go to her and offer her a presout if
she would bring Westcott Slyter to the
Christmas church party. Miss Leroy,
instead of ilecliniii the bribe with in
dignation, wished to know what it
would be aud when told told that she
would receive a lozea p:iirs of gloves
struck for two d en. Her terms hav
ing been accepted, she began to lay
plans tor getting uer ciuicues on xue

"Just think." observed Miss Thorpe
when she heard of this nefarious con
tract, "of sending a girl with no sense
ot honor at all to eaten an abnormally
honcrable man."
"She'll catch him all tho same," re
plied Mis Quigley "that is, If she can
get at him."
Miss Leroy's comeliness was a mat
ter of dispute. By some she was called
pretty, by others homely. When her
face was at rest there was no beauty
In It, but when it lighted up it changed
tompletely, taking on an expression of
mingled innocence and chlldlikeness.
Every one spoke of "that guileless
way" she had with her. Probably her
most effective feature was her eyes.
They were dark brown ones, and she
tould look out of them anything she
pleased. Her principal use for them
was to send expressions of injured in
nocence. Miss Leroy determined to make a
reconnoissance of Slyter castle, as it
was called by the young women of the
place. Taking a book under her arm,
she went to the house and rang the
bell. The butler appeared, and she
asked for Mr. Slyter with a view to
take his subscription for a new vol
ume. Of course she didn't get sight of
him, but she cross questioned the but
ler asking, he thought. Impertinent
questions and learned where Mr. Sor
ter's study was situated. Then on
leaving the premises, throwing her
strategic eye about, she observed that
an apple tree sent its branches right
up against th' study window.
A day or two later, while Mr. Slyter
was writing a chapter in his book, en
title "Man's Tlace In tL? Universe,"
happening to glance aside, he saw a
kite entangled in the leafless branches
of the apple tree. It hung by Its string
and dangled in the crisp December
wind.
"Strange!" inured the author. "I
didn t k::ow thr.t boys tly kites in win
ter. I never did when 1 was a boy.".
He resumed bis writing, but It was
interrupted by a slight shutting off of
the light. Looking for the cause, he
was astonished to see a little girl she
appeared by the length of ber dress to
be about thirteen years old up in the
tree and making efforts to reach the
kite with one band, while she clung to
a branch with the other. Mr. Slyter
threw up the sash and said to her:
"What are you doing up in a tree
trying to regain a kite in December!
This isn't kite time."
"My little brother was flying his kite,
and it crme down in your tree. I
didn't suppose you'd mind my trying
to get it. I'm very sorry to have in
truded." She looked as if she would cry.
"My dear child, of course I don't
mind. Stop a bit. I'll get a broom
handle or something to poke it with."
He ran away from the" window, pro
cured a rod and ran back. The kite
was still dangling, but the girl was
nowhere to be seen. A dread that she
bad fallen gave Mr. Slyter a cold chill.
Leaning out of the window, there 6be
lay under the tree, apparently uncon
scious. To run down and out to
where she had fallen required but half
a minute. Seeing no sign of life, he
took the child up in his arms, carried
her into the house and laid her on a
lounge. He was surprised at her
weight.
"William:" he yelled.
The butler entered the room, but
got no farther than the door when he
was ordered to call a doctor. At that
moment Slyter felt a hand clutch his
arm and a forced voice say:
"Xo, no! I'm not badly hurt Give
me a little time and I'll be all right."
"Never mind. William; wait awhile.
Bring a What have we in the line
of restoratives whisky? No; that
won't do. These creatures require
something stuck under their noses.
I haven't smelling salts. Bring a glass
of wine."
William retired and returned with
the wine. His master took it from
him at the door and, going to the
girl, asked her to drink a little of it.
She barely touched it to her lips,
made a wry face and banded it back.
Two brown eyes looked up at him
with an expression he was not likely
soon to forgot.
"I suppose," she said in a self re
proachful tone, "that my fall is a
punishment for trespassing."
"Not nt all, my dear child. You were
quite welcome to try to recover your
brother's kite."
"I'm much better now," she said.
"I'm going home."
"I'll send you in my auto."
"No; 111 go on foot, thank you. I
must run along; mamma will be wor
ried." . .
"But the kite?"
"Oh, never mind that."
"Here's a dollar; buy your brother
another."
As she went out she showed signs
of weakness, and he supported her.
He tried to dissuade ber from going
alone, but she was firm. ' He said he
would send to inquire about her, and
she gave him Uer address. Then she
dragged herself away.
The next morning William called to
know how the little girl was and was
told that she was in a critical condi
tion. This brought his master. He
was ushered Into a room where the
"little girl" lay on a lounge, but as
there was no short skirt to give her
the appearance of a child Slyter saw
what seemed to him to be a young
woman somewhere between seventeen
and twenty years old.
He saw Jack Ieroy. She had flown
the kite herself and brought it down
after many attempts upon Mr. Sylter's I
apple tree. When he went away from .
) the window she had scurried down the i
j tree and had only time to assume an
! unconscious but graceful position on
i the ground when he returned.
! There was an air of comfort In the
, room contrasting with Mr. Slyter's
bachelor quarters". A cheerful fire
1 blazed on the hearth, the hangings were
in perfect taste, the pictures were at
tractive, fuid a sill.ru blanket grace
fully covered the "little girl" from the
wnit down. Sylter's call lasted a
couple of hours.
. When Christmas eve came the prize
that bad been ofiVred for. Mr. Sylter's
capture was almost forgotten, and
; those who remembered it never
dreamed of Jack's wlnuing it. When
! the members of the congregation were
! assembled for the Christmas festlv
j lties a belated couple walked In to the
guild room. A dur.en girls uttered ex
clamations of astonishment. The pair
were Jacqueline Leroy and Westcott
Slyter. Miss Ltov marched in as
unassumingly r.s if she had caught a
sparrow. The same innocent smile
played about her lips; the same guile
less look Y'us in her eye. No one would
