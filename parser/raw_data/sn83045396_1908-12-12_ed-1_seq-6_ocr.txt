THE "BOOST UTAH" CONVENTION
I The convention of delegates rcprc-
seutiug commercial and industrial in
' stilutions, clubs, and boards, from tho
1 different portions of this State, which
has just closed its first session in
this city with eclat, is one that must
effect important results for tho good
or Utan. it starts on wen, anu wo aro
especially pleased to soo the freedom
with which the different topics aro dis
cussed. There is an independent ex
pression, a grasp of timely topics, and
a disposition toward furthering the de
velopment of the State, that promise
well for the career of the Utah De
velopment League, as launched.
Not only was there an excellent repre
sentation of localities in- the two score
or more dolegatcs present, but tliore is
a worthy representation also in tho
variety of interests represented. Tho
report of the session says that "every
industry and walk of life, aud labor
organizations in their vonous depart
ments are fully recognized."
i Unanimity on the main purpose of
tho organization, as manifested in
the proceedings of the session, is
entirely commendable. But unanimity
of opinion in reaching the best results,
especially a unanimity that would
hamper or crnsh out independence of
j thinking and expression, is precisely
' the opposite of what should prevail in
such a convention. There must neoc-s-sarilybo
in the minds of thinking men
differences of views, differences of
methods, aud differences as to molhods
of approachiug the subjects to be dis
cussed or plans to be formulated and
carried out. Right there is where di
vergence is aiways to bo commended
and whero the best results arc io be
expected from free discussion.
If all were to be cut and dried, if
there wore to be no expressions of op
posing viows, no criticism, no inde
pendence of spirit or mind to bo de
veloped, then indeed there would be
but small hope of I he best results
from such a convention. But tho con
vention voiy wisely avoided any dis
position to run overj'thing' into any
one's particular mould, or in any way
to hamper the freedom of those taking
part in the proceedings. But discursive
political gabble, such as was intruded
somewhat in yesterday's proceedings,
should be kept out.
In this full, free business and eco
nomic discussiou is wisdom, and through
this will be reached the best possible re
sults. When those results are reached it
should be the effort and determina
tion of all to work unrosorvedly and
with the utmost enorgy for tho success
of the plans formulated. To that end
wo trust that the Development
League will from time to time in its
acts .reach definite purposes aud
declare aims and plans that will give
the people of the State at large some
'thing to think about and to work upon.
The Loaguc is getting on splendidly,
and wc trust that all of its de
liberations may be attended with the
same" earnest spirit of progress, of in
dependence, and of devotion to the
interests of Utah as a wholo that has
in the main so far characterized the ses-
TARIFF REVISION THOROUGH.
' Wc judge from the dispatches that
President-elect Taft has reached a
common grouud with Speaker Cau
"iion as to the scope and ex
tent of the proposed tariff re
vision. It appears further that there
is to be no limit on that scope nor any
restriction on the thoroughness with
whiph tho tariff schedules will all
be gone into. The hearing before the
Ways and Means Committee of the
House indicate the same thing. There
is perfect freedom and a wholesale in
vitation to all who have anything to
offer to the committee to come for
ward and make it kuowu, present
facts. figures, market fluctuations,
tendencies of trade and transportation,
:inrl. in fnftt.. nvivfiliinn i-Vin u
. , - .... u VIUIU
have any real bearing upon the tariff
question.
Yesterday morning's dispatches gave
further reassurance to the coup
try that there would be an extra ses
sion of Congress called immediately
after March" -1th. and that the tariff
question would be the business of Cou
gross when so assembled- in extra ses
sion. The dispatch treating of this
indicated that this extra session might
last through the summer. While it is
true that the tariff question is a very
complicated one, and that every detail
of thu different schedules requires cau
tious and contiderato attention, it
would seem that there need uot be
such a long session as that in order to
reach proper results. The extra session
which gave rho Dinglcy tariff law to
the country convened on March 15,
IS07. and by the 2-itb of July the
complete rovifiou of 'the tariff law had
been effected. Wo 'should think, taking
into consideration tho hearings-of tho
Ways aud, Means- Committee and the
large discussions that havo been had
on tho tariff question, that tho work
of present revision could be shortened
instead of needing to be enlarged, as
compared with the revision of eleven
years ago. Still, of course, whatever
time is necessary to make a law that
will be satisfactory will undoubtedly
be taken. And this is to be said
about it, that the present Congress will
enter upon consideration of this ques
tion at its extra session next March,
1 with fuller information and more de
tailed presentations of facts to go upon .
than any other Congress has ever had
at. the beginning of any former tariff,
revision. '. ...
'We' take it that the fundamental idea
of protection will be kept in mind '
throughout in this tariff revision, but
we trust that it will not bo conceded
that every manufacturer in this coun
try necessarily needs protection in his
business. There eurely should bo by
this time an illustration of the perfect
work of protection in tbo establishment
in tho United States of -arious forms
of manufacture that would now ueed
uo protection at all. Mr. Caruogie
showed pretty conclusively, in his re
cent Century articlo, that the manu
facturers of steel in tho United States
ueed uo protection. They can pro
duce steel choapor than steel can be
produced anj'whcro else in the world,
and they arc now producing it in
greater quantities and at less cost
than has ever bcon dono in any ono
country or in any other throe countries "
iu the history of the world. It would
appear, therefore, that .steel and most
of the manufactures of steel need no
protection. In tho matter of the
products of wood, it would bo a help to
tho reforestation proposition to admit
woods in the crude form of logs, and
perhaps somo forms of lumber, with
out any duty. If logs from Canada
could be brought into this country free
of tariff, tve would immediately begin .
iu uuuuuu iuu vjanauian loresis in piacc
of our own. And surely no objection
able results would follow to
Canada through the denudation
of .her forests, but rather bene
ficial. And still it is quito proper
and consistent for the Ropublican party
to keep in view in the revision of
the . tariff the paramount idea of pro
tection; but care should bo taken to
see that protection is uceded in fact,
and is not a mere holhouso clamor for
the retention of something that is
no louger needed. And in going through
the whole of the schedule with these
two ideas in mind, fff retaining pro
tection whore it is needed and taking
it off where there is no longor need of
it, Congress will have a busy lime of
it, and its results should bring great
relief to the country and should stimu
late its manufactures in a wa3- under
the new tariff that no provious tariff
has ever been ablo to excel.
CONGRESSIONAL RESENTMENT.
It was uot iu the least surprising to
rend in the dispatches j-cstorday morn
ing that both tho Senate aud tho House
of Representatives arc up in resentment
against that portion of President
Roosevelt's message that deals with the
''Secret Service." The language used
1)3' the President in treating of that
subject was decidedly castigating, and
did not refrain from casting imputa
tions upon both Housos of Congress and
upou the motives of tho Congressmen
who had passed the measure of which
the President makes- complaint.
It appears that tho President's ob
jection is to an amendment .incorporated
Secret Service. This was to the effect
that no detail should bo made from
the Secret Sorvico and no transfer
made therefrom. The President charac
terizes this euuetment as of benefit
only, and possible of benefit only, to
the criminal classes. And he imputes
a deliborato intent to this cud by tho
friends of tho amendment, lie says,
"If deliberately introduced for the pur
pose of diminisning Iho effectu-oness of
war ;i gainst criniu, it could uot havo
been better devised to this end." He
urates that thr jiniclico thus forbi-ldcn
h?s been followed by tho ciecutivo
heads of tho varolii; departments for
twcr.t3" yoars, and he claims Ih.'.t: to th
custom so followed "wo. owe fho secur
ing of the ovvideucc which enable.! us
to drive great lotteries out of busi
ness' to "discover aomo of tho most
outrageous frauds in connection with
the theft of Government land and Gov
ernment timber 1,3 great corporations
and by individuals," and that tho cus
tom thus put an eud to "enabled us
to get somo of the evidence indispen
sable in order to secure tho conviction
of iho wealthiest and most formidable
criminals with whom the Government
has to deal."
Tho President repeats that the
amendment was "of benefit to no ono
excepting to these criminals, ' and it
scriouslj' hampers the Government in
tho detection of crime and the secur
ing of justice. And he proceeds to make
it lit on-members of Congress by saj-ing
thnt the chief argument iu "favor of tho
change was that the Congressmen did
uot themselves wish to bo investigated
b3' Secret Sorvico mou. And ho cites
as presumptive evidence of this fear
and in apparent implication that such
investigation would result in tho cou
victiou of a number of the members of
Congress, tho fact that "tho work of
tho Secret Service .agents was partly
responsible for the indictment aud con
viction of a Senator and a. CoiiTessmun
of land frauds in Orocon. " Thismnhos
it tit very closely upon the mombors
of Congress. It is a direct charge,
first of nil, that Congress has passed
au act which was of so much . benefit
to tho criminal classes that if dosigned
for their protection it could uot havo
been more so. And while stating of
fensive' tho proposition that the law
was passed because the Congressmen
did not wish themselves to be investi
gated, illustrating tho fact V- the prose
cution and conviction of members cf
Congress from 'Oregon, tho President
mado it as offcusivo as it wall could bo
as against the members who voted for
that amendment.
Apparently the President considers
such members undosirnblo Congress
men, and possibly ns undesirable citi
zens. But if ho had deliberate- and
designedly hatched up somo means
whereby the repeal of that (to him)
i obuoxious ainondment, could be made
impossible, he could not havo pursued
i that object with, more cortainty of re
sult' than" he has done. 4 In thus pro
scut ing the case in his message, no
Congressman can now vote for tho re
peal of that amendment without delib
erately confessing that he was lnsh'iO
thereto b3r the vituperation of tuc
President, and at the samo time con
fessing that his vote in passing that
amendment last j-car was directly 'n
(ho interest of the criminal classes, aud
to protect himself from investigation.
And so wo do not expect to see that
amendment repealed at this session.
Probabl there was good reason for
adopting it at the timo it was adopted,
and that roasou will bo sufficient still,
to keep it on tho statute-book.
A PLAIN CASE.
The church organ Inst night con- I
tinned its discussion of the " red-light
.district" in its usual st3-lc of hardened
falsehood and rascality. It misreprc- j
cents, evades, and baldly falsifies con-
stnutlj-, aud is the most conspicuous j
examplo we know of among church
organs of willful and deliberate do
pravitj'. Wo call- tho attention of the church
organ specifically to a conspicuous in
stance of its slaudor and lying. On
Thursday evening' it statod editorially
that, "'the American organ." meaning
Tho Tribune, had not adversoly crit
icized tho dreadful proposition of Chief
of Police Pitt till later, meaning un
questionably that we had not promptly
condemned that proposition when it
appcarod. But wc showed that the Pitt
proposition was made public on tho 31st
of January last, that wo knew notaing
about it till it was made public, and
that we promptly, sovercl3 and un
qualifiedly condemned it tho same day,
our criticism of it being at length and
appearing in The Tribune of the morn
ing of January 22nd, tho morning after
tho Pitt report appeared.
Wo called upon tho "Sows to retract
its charge; but it refuses to do so. It
is therefore, pilloried as an unscru
pulous, willful liar, a paper not deserv
ing of the least consideration by the
public, a character assassin, and an in
famous traitor to society, to morals,
and to common deconcj.
THE "ADAM-GOD" INSANITY-
Dispatches from Kansas City, Mis
souri, during tho woek havo contained
accounts of a sanguine encounter be
tween the police there and a man
named Johu Sharp, who styled himself
the "Adam-God." and who had sur
rounded himself with a small number
of followers. And in the profession of
this fanatic there is material for a lit
tlo comparison.
The Tribune, of course, does not.
know how tho man Sharp got hold of
his sillj' doctrine whether ho has bor
rowed it or whether it was the product
of his disordered mind. But we do
know that he is iiot the first to preach
the nonsense. Let us make a reference:
Now hear it, O Inhabitants' or tno earui,
Jew. Gentile, saint and sinner! When our
father Adam came into the garden of
Eden, he came Into It with a celestial
body, and brought. Eve, ono of his wives,
with him. Uo helped to make and organ
ize this world. He Is Michael, the arch
angel, the Ancient of Days! about whom
holy men have written and spoken he is
our Father and our God, and the only God
with whom wo have to do. Every man
upon the earth, professing- Christians or
non-profesBlngs must hear it, and will
know It sooner or later. From a sermon
by President Brlgham Young In the Salt
Lake tabernacle. April 0, 1S52; Journal of
Discourses, volume 1, page 50.
It appears that Sharp has varied this
doctriuc somewhat, in that ho himself
claim? to be tlfe "Adam-God," aud
that his wife is tho "God-Mothor"
Eve. But the essential part of the
teaching remains the same that Adam
is the God of this world, and really
the being whom Christians should wor
ship. The effect of the .theory advocalod
1)3' tho fanatical Sharp is identical with
tho Mormon doctrine in another respect
that thcro aro more gods than ono,
sotting aside Biblo teaching iu this re
gard. And when we come to cxainiuo
the presentations, of Mormon loaders a
little moro closely, wo do not kuow
that Ihorc exists evon the minor disa
greement to which wo have called at
tention. While Sharp claims himself
to be tho "Adam-God" in persou, the
veiled utterances of Mormon pulpiteors
have sometimes contained intimations
to a similar, effect in behalf of their
own leadership. i"or instance:
If you find out who Joseph was. you will
know as much about God ns you need to
at. present; for if Uo said. "I am a God to
this people." IIo did not say that He was
the only wjzo God. fN'otlee the cnpllul'za
tlon of "IIo" as It appears In the original
lexU"
'a a 4 S ti
If T can pass Brother Joseph, I shall
stand good chance for passing Peter,
Jesus, tno prophets, Moses, Abraham, and
all back to Father Adam, and be pretty
sure of receiving his approbation. If I
can pass, all this ordeal, Ehall 1 not be pret
ty safe? I think I shall. From a sermon
by President Brlgham Young, delivered
In Great Salt Lake City. March S, 1S5T;
Journal of Discourses, volume 4, page 271.
In the foregoing matter is a rather
nlain fliippnstinn Mint the salvation of
tho Mormon people, and tho achieve
ment of proper reward in heaven, can
como to them onky through the Mor
mon prophet. In other words, "In- mo
is salvation," and without intercession
on the port of tho founder of Mor
mouism humanity must take hell and
damnation for its portion. The effect
of such teaching is to give to the
prophet the attribute of a pod one to
be worshipped because one through
whom all reward mn3' be gained 03' peo
ple in this particular dispensation. So 1
it maj' be that Sharp has been a stu- j 1
dent of the doctrines set forth by the
Brighamitc branch of the Mormon
church, inasmuch as ho aoears to havo '
presented nothing new. If so, the cur- j J
rent news of tho day with respect to 1
his notions aud their results would 1
seem to reflect no credit unon tho teach- !
ing bo imitates, nor upon the origi
nators of that teaching.
Another thing that makes for proof
of similarity between Monnonism and
Sharpism' is tho fact that this later
fanatic imagined it to be nccessar3 to
arm himself in order to protect his the
ory and its proponent from physical
attack by ungodly unbelievers. At tho
time tllis "Adam-God" dortrino was
first promulgated hero in Utah tho
Mormon organization was tho church
militant high priests were going about
armed to tho tcoth. The prophet him
self was never without the dare and
tho threat in his mouth ho was always
ready to unsheath his bowio and go
forth to slay in behalf of tho Almighty.
Sharp is but a mcro imitator, oven in
this respect, because ho was not onby
armed but fought like the fanatic thnt
he is, with unfortunate' fatal results
to innocent and deluded followers. And
hero, again, the historj' of Monnonism
is repeated, for it has always been the
befooled beliovor that hns been com
pelled to suffer anv serious couse
quences that l'ollowod the immoral and
blasphemous raids made 1)3' the leaders
upon Christian soutimcnt.
When all the facts aro taken into con
sideration it seoms plain thnt the Utah
Mormon has little reason to laugh aB
otherwise- derido this man Sharp. yvr'
