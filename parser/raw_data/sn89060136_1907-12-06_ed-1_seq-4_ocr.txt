The Message.
The Presidents message was read be
fore both houses of Congress on Tuesday
Its great length may be judged from the
fact of the reading occupying one hoar
and forty two minutes. The subjects dis
cussed cover a wide range, but the mes
sage as a whole does not seem to hare ex
cited any unusual interest in either house
Viewed from a partisan standpoint, John
Sharp Williams, democratic leader iti the
House, styles the good part not new,
while the new part is not good. By re
publican leaders it is styled as an able
and interesting document.
The President presents no real plan for
currency reform, but suggests law to pro
vide a more elastic system of currency,
and authorizing emergency issues to be
based on adequate securities and issued
under heavy tax.
Trust legislation is discussed at great
est length, and more Federal control of
railroads and all other great corporations
urged.
Following the recommendations of the
Postmaster general the establishment of
postal savings banks, and extension of
parcels post system is favored. In regard
to the Panama canal Mr. Roosevelt ius'sts
that the government should continue the
work of construction under army en
gineers. "
One of the radical suggestions is the
suppression of campaign contributions
by corporations, and the appropriation
by the Government to the national com
mittees of each party enough money to
conduct Presidental campaigns.
The big stick policy crops up with a
demand for an increase of the army and
navy, and the strengthening of coast
defenses. Among other important re
commendations in the lengthy document
are the improvement of inland water
ways, irrigation and drainage; protection
of forests and the public lands; conser
vation of mining rights on public lands;
limitation of exercise of injunction by
Federal courts; compulsory arbitration of
disputes between capital and labor; &c.,
&c.
How about the “gold standard” and
“the best banking system on earth” now ?
Do you remember the bowl that went up
from the bankers when the greenhackers
and populist farmers wanted the Govern
ment to issue paper money ? Do you
remember with what ridicule and scorn
the baukers scouted loug-haired reform
ers and talked of the necessity of “honest
money”? And now these same bankers
are making “fiat money” out of theii
checks to give out in lieu of the alleged
honest money which their depositors left
with them for safety.
Reiuertiber what a lot they had to say
about 53 ceut silver dollars ? But what
about the no-cent dollars they are resort
ing to at the present Time ? Are the
people being cautioned against them
and are the capitalistic dailies pratiug
about the “honest do lar” and a “safe
and sane<* policy, while the Wall Street
stock jobbersYind gamblers are dipping
into the United States Treasury to
help themselves out of a panic of their
own making ? Just do a little thinking
about these things for yourself now.
The Populists have issued their call for
a National convention, to nominate a
candidate for President. The convention
will meet in St. Louis April 2, 1908. The
call declares if the power of monopoly
and privilege is to be taken from the
banks and stockjobbers and the rule of
the people restored in our time, it is to
be accomplished through an independent
party, free from predatory affiliations, a
both Democratic and Republican parties
i have entangling alliauces with the en
emies of the government, and canuot
make substantial progress for reform in
this generation.
The Sixtieth Congress of the United
States opened on Monday. Both Houses
are reported to have been in a snarly
mood, with the presiding officers as the
object of their attack, the minority mem
hers of the House objecting to the adop
lion of Seakers Cannon's rules, while vice
President Fairbanks was assailed for what
was considered a violation of senatorial
ethics in the opening proceedings
Twenty nine new Senators took the oath
of office, while in Ibe House 102 new
members took thier seats.
Swarthmore College will, iu all prob
ability, reject the bequest of Anna T.
Jtanes, estimated to he worth SI,OOOOOO,
the acceptance of which would require
the institution to cease to participate in
inter collegiate sports.
WASHINGTON LETTER.
Senator Allison, chairman of the
finance committee of the Senate, drifted
into town this week and discussed the
outlook for currency legislation. Oh
yes, of course, he said, there would be
currency legislation, but not immediate.
There were a number of plans to be con
sidered, and it might be some time before
the combined wisdom of the party made
itself manifest in a perfect hill that could
be subscribed to by all interests in the
party and passed as an administration
measure. That gives the keynote to the
situation. The majority party wants to
draw a bill and pass it as n party meas
ure, claiming all the credit for it without
respect to whether the country is waiting
and needing legislation or not.
There are about as many minds as to
just what is needed in the way of a cur
rency bill as there are men iu both
bouses of Congress. There are all sorts
of measures, from free silver to green
backism. But there are about four pos
sible solutions of the problem that will
be seriously considered. Indeed whether
any one of them is really a solution is a
question that time alone can determine
There is a proposition for a central bank
of issue, more or less on the plan of the
bank of England or the Imperial Bank
of Germany. TBere is another scheme,
less intimately associated with the gov
ernment, of an organization among the
existing banks with a sort of general
clearing house and bank with supervisory
powers. Then there is the scheme for
largely increased note issue based on
securities other than government bonds,
and finally a scheme for note issue based
on the assets of the banks with a govern
ment guarantee behind it. Probably
none of these schemes will be adopted
outright. Each of them is a definite plan
and any of them might work more or less
well. But there are a number of “lead
ers” who will want to have a finger in
the pie of final settlement, and it is easy
to see now that the ultimate hill will be a
compromise measure, trimmed to suit
various interests and to satisfy individual
and personal vanities. In the end the
measure probably will be neither fish,
flesh or fowl, ami the only thing assured,
if there be legislation at all, is that it
will be a party measure in the worst sense
of the term. It is wished by the party
managers that the bill may be framed in
committee and brought to the House and
Senate ready to be jammed through
under the party whip. That is the only
way that it ever will get through, and
thej-e probably will be a lively fight over
it even Ihtn. It is quite as likely that
the bill will he endlessly amended on the
floor of the House and Senate, bandied
back between conference aud floor, ami
possibly in the end talked to death, end
ing np the session unpassed under the
warning of tile leaders against “hasty
and ill considered legislation.”

There is another record breaking re
port of wireless achievement on the Pa
cific. The western ocean seems for some
reason to be better adapted to long dis
tauce wireless work than the Atlantic.
There i 9 no particular explanation of
why this should be but there are so many
things about wireless telegraphy still
unexplained that perhaps this 19 nst
remarkable. The fact remains that one
of the naval vessels when about 1,400
miles off San Francisco was in communi
cation not only with San Francisco hut
picked up a wireless message from Sitka.
This was distant 2,200 miles air line,
making a record for wireless communi
, cation.

The War Department is going in for
dirigible balloons at once without waiting
for next spring. Army officers have been
iletailed to watch the tests of a new motor
in which the Department is interested.
Without saying just what the motor is,
* it may be said that it has been brought
' down in weight to four pounds to the
horse power for the larger sizes. It is
the most powerful motor of its weight
that the Department has been able to
6ml in this country, aud several of them
have been ordered for the several airships
; that will soou be under construction. A
1 ship built by the private firm that man
ufactures the motor was tried out the
1 other day iu the presence of some repre
sentatives of the War Department. It
was something of a departure in the line
of dirigible balloons. It used the gas
bag to lift the bulk of the weight of the
ship, but was slightly heavier than air
wbeu fully loaded and depended on the
: thrust of its propellers for part of its
1 bouyaucy, as well as for its driving power.
It made an ascent of several hours'
duration; attained an altitude of r,Boo feet
and made in still air, a speed of 30 miles
an hour. The trial was very satisfactory
and a number of the features will be in
corporated in the balloons that the De
partment is preparing to build.

Another step has been taken in the
fight with the Tobacco Trust in the case
of the |7,200 worth of cigarettes that were
recently seized at Norfolk. The Trust
after putting up adequate bond was flow
ed to ship the cigarettes abroad. They
were intended for the trade supplied by
the Britisb-American Tobacco Company
and were originally seized under the
claim of the government that it had a
right to levy on trust goods in interstate
or foreign commerce. The question of
law has not yet been fought out and it
probably will be a long time before the
case comes to a settlement which must
eventually be before the United States
Supreme Court. Meanwhile the Trust is
free to ship its good abroad, giving bond
to cover the amount if any more of them
should be seized.

There was an interesting visitor at the
White House this week in the person of
old Ezra Meeker, one of the pioneers of
the northwest who has been for almost
two years engaged in a jonrney from
Tacoma, Wash., to the White House in a
prarie schooner drawn by oxen. He is
interested in a trans continental road
fiom the Atlantic to the Pacific to be
known as the Pioneer Way in memory of
the man with the ox and wagon trains
who opened up the west to settlement.
Ezra drove up to the White House in bis
ox drawn wagon and was introduced to
the President by Representative Cushman
of Washington. The President walked
out bareheaded in the cold wind and
looked over the team and was introduced
to the hired man and the oxen. He ex
pressed himself as much interested in the
plau for a great inter ocean railway, but
there is a serious question whether the
scheme will become anything more than
a scheme for many years to come.
Panics.
The Springfield, Mass , Republican,
makes the following comments on this
subject, which is occupying the public
attention at present :
‘"‘Some lessons of value therefore are to
be learned, and auioug them are these:
The belief has been deeply cultivated that
a money system strongly testing ou gold
makes panics impossible It is a false
notion. The belief has bad wide accept
ance that a high protective tariff protects
from panics which come only under low
tariffs. That is quite as false as the other
The belief prevails to 3 greater or less
extent that a particular political party
possesses the exclusive power of govern
ing the country in freedom from financial
disaster and industrial relapses. That is
even more false than either of the other
beliefs. Panics or financial crises are
made possible only by the existence of
the credit system, and the credit system
exists under the gold standard as under
any other money standard, and it is in
operation whether tariffs are high or low,
or whether the republican party is.in
power or not.”
The Jamestown ter-centennial closed
on Saturday at Norfolk. The total at
tendance figures arrf given as 2,800,000,
of which 1,500,000 were paid admissions,
hike almost every other big exhibition of
its kind, it was far from a success
financially. Receivers may be asked to
keep the Exhibition intact and in read
iuess for another year on a prospective
sale as a whole of all the property.
Maryland’s fruit exhibit was sent to
Baltimore fdr exhibition there. Those of
other States will be sold or given away.
A Real Wonderland.
South Dakota, with its rich
silver mines, bonanza farms, wide
ranges and strange natural forma
tions, is a veritable wonderland.
At Mound City, in the home of
Mrs. B. D. Clapp, a wonderful
case of healing has lately occurred.
Her son seemed near death with
lung and throat trouble. “Ex
hausting coughing spells occurred
every live minutes,” writes Mrs.
Clapp, “when I began giving Dr.
Kng’s New Discovery, the great
meidicine, that saved his lite and
completely cured him.” Guaran

The Reaeon Was Plain.
“There was a woman,” said a law
yer, “whose husband was killed In a
railroad accident. The railroad, to
. avoid suit, gave her $5,000 damages.
The. sum satisfied the woman, but a
month or two afterward, taking up a |
newspaper, she read about a man who
had lost his leg In the same accident,
and, behold, this man was given by
the company damages to the amount of
: $7,500. It made the woman mad. She
hastened at once to the office of the
railway's claim adjuster. She said
bitterly:
“‘How Is this? Here you give a
man $7,500 for the loss of his leg,
while you only gave me $5,000 for the
loss of my husband.’
“The claim adjuster smiled amiably
and said In a soothing voice:
“‘Madam, the reason is quite plain.
The $7,500 won't provide the poor
man with a new leg, whereas with
your $5,000 you can easily get a new
husband and perhaps a better one.’ ’’—

London Theater* Charm.
One of the delicious treats London
offers Americans is the acting and ac
cessories of her theaters. The or
chestra stalls or balcony stalls are very
sumptuous and very' roomy aud are
evidently created on purpose to ap
peal to hearty diners. The usher is a
very tidy young woman In black dress
and coquettish cap and apron, pos
sessed of a sweet face and a still sweet
er voice. You pay her a sixpence for
each programme. The stage settings
are perfect in detail. Best of all is the
elocution of the players. From the
rising of the curtain even unto the go
ing down of the same, each and every
word uttered Is as clear and tuneful as
the tinkle of a silver bell. You don’t
have to wait till the middle of the first
act before you can even guess what
the plot Is about. Under these unusual
circumstances the interest one takes In
a play is greatly enhanced, and he
wonders why an American company Is
not as well drilled.—Travel Magazine.
A Curious Widow’s Cap.
A very curious cap forms the “wid
ow’s weeds” of the Australia aborigine
in one part of the groat island conti
nent. Near the northeast bend of the
Murray river it Is the custom for wid
ows to attend upon the tombs of their
departed lords. Then, after shaving
their heads, they cover them with pipe
clay, kneaded into a paste. The head
Is first covered with a net to prevent
the clay from sticking too tightly to
the skin—a misfortune which Is partly
averted by the amount of grease with
which every Australian native is anoint
ed. A layer of this clay several Inches
in thickness is plastered over the head
and when dry forms a sort of skull
cap exactly fitting the head on which
It was molded. As It weighs several
pounds, the widow’s cap cannot be
comfortable.
Why Age Improves Wines.
“Why do wines improve with age?”
“Because they marry,” answered
expert.
“Marry?”
“Yes. That is the term used in the
trade. ‘This sherry,’ we say, ‘has mar
ried well’ or ‘that hock has married
hastily.’ We mean by a wine’s mar
riage, that Its different components—
the alcohol, the sugar, the carbonic acid
and so on —have --blended together
smoothly. In a new wine this blend
ing, this marriage, has not yet taken
place, and hence the harshness of new
wines. Old wines are valued because
the alcohol and sugar and acids and
others have all married together Into
one fragrant compound.”—Exchange.
Weather Vanes.
The best weather vanes are made
with the greatest nicety and precision,
so that they balance perfectly and
turn with the least possible wear. The
vane Is, of course, longer on one side
of the socket than on the other, or It
would not turn with the wind, but Its
weight Is the same on_both sides. If
It Is a narrow vane, for Instance, the
weight of the solid head Is easily made
equal to that of the longer, projecting,
but thinner feather end, and all vanes,
whatever they may be, are balanced
as to weight and so adjusted that they
turn easily and with the least possible
friction.
Crazy People.
“Crazy people never act together,”
declares the superintendent of a large
asylum for the Insane. “If one Inmate
attacks an as sometimes
happens, the others would look upon
It as no affair .of theirs and simply
watch It. The moment we discover
two or more inmates working together
we would know they were on the road
to recovery."
Mr. E. L. Marks who conducts a general mer
ohandise business at Pope, Va , writes: I had
chills last June and got down in very bad shape. ,
My system was so completely run down that I was
scarcely üble to attend to any work. 1 took 3
bottles ol Rvdale’s Tonic and felt like a new mau
before I had tinished taking it. It did me m >re
good than anything I ever found and my health
was good all last summer. Eli T. Reynolds.
