? Washington. December 7: President
Taft Is putting in all his spare
time these days struggling with the
question of "what is whisky?" By succeeding
appeals the question has been
carried through the food and drink experts
of the department of agriculture,
charged with the administration of the
pure food and drug act, to the solicitor
general of the United States and to the
president himself. The printed evidence
and the briefs of the attorneys
who have appeared In the controversy,
form a record equal to that of many of
the cases which the supreme court of
the United States Is called u*x>n to determine.
and the president is living
again the life of a Federal judge when
he takes to his private library In the
evening the volumes of testimony and
argument which he peruses In the hope
of reaching soon a strictly legal decision
on the mooted question. The whole
controversy hinges on the question of
whether whisky, artificially aged and
highly rectified, is whisky or "imitation
whisky" when compared with whisky
wnlch is aged and colored by the oldfasnioned
method of storage in white
oak barrels which have been fire-charred
on the inside.
? New York, December 8: The report
of the census bureau showing only
8,878,277 bales of cotton ginned to December
1, compared with 11,008,661 to
the same date last season, was followed
by increased activity and considerable
excitement in the cotton market
this morning with May contracts selling
up to 15.39 or 17 points above the
closing figures of last night, and at a
new high record for the season. Heavy
realizing, attributed to some of the
leading bulls, caused slight recessions
during the morning, but there was a
great volume of outside buying and the
market showed a very firm tone with
bulls claiming that the census figures
indicated a government estimate of
under 10,250,000 bales. The cotton crop
last year was in the neighborhood of
13.800,000 bales. The market became
even" more active later in the day, with
buying orders reaching the ring from
all directions, while it looked as though
some of the largest of the old bulls
were replacing cotton which they had
sold below 15 cents in expectation of
16 cents before Christmas. May contracts
sold at 15.50, or $1.40 per bale
above the closing bid of last night,
while August advanced to 14.95, or $2.40
a bale. The close was steady with the
general market showing a gain for the
day of from 14 to 43 points.
? Washington, December 8: There
were 8,878,277 running bales of cotton
ginned from the growth of 1909 to December
1, as compared with 11,008,861
for 1908, according to a bulletin of the
census bureau issued today. These figures
count round as half bales, and exclude
linters. They stand against 8,343,396
for 1907, and 10,027,868 for 1906.
The proportion of the last three crops
ginned to December 1 is 84.1 per cent
for 1908, 75.5 per cent for 1907, and 77.2
for 1906. Round bales included this
year are 133,919 against 201,480 included
for 1908. and 154,636 for 1907. Sea
Island bales Included are 77,776 for
1909; 68,396, for 1908, and 55,299 for
1907. The distribution of Sea Island
cotton by states for 1909 is: Florida
25,906, Georgia 43,118, and South Carolina
8,752. The total cotton crop report
for 1908 was 13,086,005, and for 1907 is
11,057,822. The corrected statistics of
the quantity of cotton ginned this season
to November 14, are 8,112,119 bales.
By states, the cotton ginned from the
1909 growth to December 1, follows:
Alabama 919,575, Arkansas 613,871,
Florida 55,958, Georgia 1,677,232, Louisiana
237,553, Mississippi 866,950, North

South Carolina 988,340. Tennessee 206,357,
Texas 2,212,319, all other states
49,133.
? New York, December 8: George
Preston Sheldon, deposed president of
the Phoenix (Fire) Insurance company
of Brooklyn, lying at death's door at
his Greenwich, Conn., home, was indicted
for larceny in the first degree by
the grand jury in New York today for
alleged misappropriation of funds of
the company, of which he was the head
for twenty-two years. As Sheldon was
not arrested and probably will not be
unless his health improves radically,
the text of the indictment was not
made public, but an official of the district
attorney's office is authority for
the statement that the amount which
he is accused of stealing is 345,000.
According to this official, Sheldon, it
was testified before the grand jury,
usea me iunus or creuu 01 me wisuiance
company in stock market transactions
through a New York brokerage
firm and pocketed the profits. The
grand Jury will now investigate the
connection of others with alleged speculation
with funds of the company.
Only charges against Sheldon have
been examined yet, although the report
of the insurance department implicates
others. In the meantime detectives
will be sent to Greenwich to inquire
into the condition of the accused man's
health. If they are satisfied that he is
too ill for trial, no attempt at extradition
will be made, but he will be kept
under close surveillance. His condition
tonight, as reported from Greenwich,
was critical. Four exhibits of interest
which have figured in the grand
Jury investigation so far, are three
drafts for $10,000 each and one of $15,000,
alleged profits of speculation which
Sheldon is accused of having carried
on. Each of these drafts is made the
subject of a count in the indictment.
Sheldon is 64 years old and widely
known in insurance circles. He was
taken ill with ptomaine poisoning six
weeks ago, before he was deposed as
president or me insurance company.
? What the Washington Times prints
concerning the president is generally
considered to be authoritative. This
concerning the president's attitude toward
the appointment of negroes to
office is from that paper: "That President
Taft is going to make apnolntments
of northern negroes to office
rather than southern ones is the information
which has been pretty thoroughly
disseminated among the colored
politicians of Washington and elsewhere.
The president has talked over
his ideas about the appointment of colored
men to office with some of the
leading men of the race and he has
signified to them his inclination to give
recognition to the negro voters in
northern states, where there are large
populations of blacks. As the result of
this policy it is expected that the negroes
in the south who are holding im
portant offices will, as their terms expire.
be displaced for the most part by
whites and in turn recognition will be
given to colored men In the north. In
the entire south are not many offices
held by colored men?that Is. offices of
importance and influence. The list of
colored men holding imp< rtant offices
in the south under the Federal government
includes the following: Robert
Smalls, collector of customs at Beaufort,
S. C.: Henry Rucker, collector of
internal revenue, at Atlanta, Ga.; Joseph
Lee, collector of internal revenue
at Jacksonville, Fla.: Nathan H. Alexander,
register of the land office at
Montgomery, Ala.; Thomas V. McAllister.
receiver of -^ublic moneys at
Jackson, Miss.; Walter L. Cohen, register
of the land office at New Orleans;
Alexander B. Kennedy, receiver of public
moneys at New Orleans; John E.
Bush receiver of public moneys at Little
Lock. The course the president
will take in the matter of appointing
colored men is likely to be illustrated
in the selection of a successor to W,
T. Vernon, register of the treasury.
Booker T. Washington and other colored
leaders have given their support
to J. C. Nanier of Nashville for the
place. But it apoears the president will
probably select a colored man from the
north."

EIntertd at the Postofflce In Yorkvllle
as Mall Matter of the Second Class.
YORK VILLE, S. C.t
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1909.
British statesmen continue to Insist
that the government must develop cotton
production In Africa by means of
subsidies, and they are going to keep
on along that line until they accomplish
something.
President Taft does not mince matters
In recommending the passage of
a ship-subsidy bill: but as to whether
the Republican congress will dare lei
such a measure go through, is very
doubtful.
The New York Times of yesterday,
printed affidavits from George H.
Dunde, an insurance broker and Capt.
Loose, a retired navigator, stating that
Dr. Cook had employed them to help
manufacture records of his polar trip,
and they are giving the things away,
because the doctor failed to pay. By
way of corroborating their statements,
they give some of the alleged faked
records. Dr. Torp, rector of the University
of Copenhagen, who now has
Cook's records in his possession, says
that the Times story is based on fiction:
that it would be impossible to
fake records that will stand the tests
to which these will be subjected, and
it ought not to be forgotten that the
Times has quite a reputation as a finder
of mares' nests.
Some of the papers are printing stories
to the effect that Germany and
Japan are mixing in the Nicaraguan affair
on the side of President Zelaya, in
the hope of getting a concession for the
digging of an isthmian canal through
Nicaragua to compete with the Panama
canal. Of course we do not know; but
we do not believe there is anything to
the story. While it is probable that
the late Senator Morgan was right in
claiming that the Nicaragua route was
the best and the cheapest, and while it
is possible that the United States may
some day dig a ditch through Nicaragua,
because of physical difficulties
along the Panama route, and more especially
because some day the Panama
canal may be found to be Inadequate to
the developments of the future, we do
not believe that Germany, Japan or i
q nvhnHv pIso k oniric tr> trv to interfere
with the operations of this country on
the isthmus.
Referring in its last issue to what
The Enquirer has been saying about
the letting of the contract for publishing
the county supervisor's quarterly '
statement, the Rock Hill Herald says
that our statements are prompted by
malice and spite, and characterizes
some of these statements, especially '
those referring to circulation and facilities
to do the work as false. If
anything we have said has been
prompted by malice, spite, or even ordinary
resentment against the Herald, 1
or any one else, we are not aware of
the fact. We certainly do not feel that 1
way, and we have not said anything !
that we did not have good reason to 1
beLeve was true. Our estimate as to !
the circulation of the Herald is based I
on the statement in N. W. Ayer's '
newspaper directory for 1909. The '
publishers of this book Rive the figures 1
at 1,100, and they say that they got '
their information from the Herald. Of 1
course, we understand that the figures
were for the year previous. As to what
the present circulation of the Herald
is, we do not know, and because of the
different points of view as to what constitutes
circulation, we can think of
but one way by which this proposition
can be satisfactorily established, and
that is by inviting a postal inspector
to go over the list, strike off all names
that are not recognized as bona fide
under the rules of the postofflce department
and make an official statement
as to the net result. We stand
ready for this test at any time. However.
we insist and repeat that we have
no quarrel with the Herald and no resentment
toward it on account of this
little advertising contract. The commissioners
are not required to let the
contract by competitive bidding, and
we have absolutely no objection to their
giving it to the Herald or any other paper.
without consulting us at all. But
really we do not think it exactly fair
to the public to allow the impression to
go out that the award was made on a
F(trict business basis, unless this is a
fact.
Letters to aanta. >
We are printing quite a bunch of j
letters to Santa Claus in this issue, and s
while there may be some crusty people, ?
who think it is all foolishness, we don't i
see it that way.
The little chaps are generally quite <
modest in their requests, which are
generally so simple that they are hardly
worth while; but as to the worth
while part, we older ones have only to
think a little.
What grown man or woman is there
who does not remember how his or her
childish heart used to yearn at Christmas
times for just such things as the
children are writing Santa about, and ,
how pleased they were when old Santa .
came along and left them what they |
wanted. t
Of course, most of the little writers '
are going to get what they are asking
for. They would have probably gotten '
it had they not written: but still their *
letters are not amiss for they contain
suggestions that may cause Santa
Claus to do a great many nice things
that he would not have otherwise
thought about.
Christmas is not here yet. It is still
fifteen days off, but it is near enough
to make it worth while for all of us to
begin to consider how much pleasure
there is for ourselves in trying to make
it pleasant for others, and if we ponder
thi-3 question sufficiently, there will
really be more in the wonderful season
for the older people than there is for
the younger ones.
The Postal Doficit.
Discussing the affairs of the postoffice
department in his annual message.
President Taft has this to say:
The deficit every year in the postofflce
department is largely caused by
tne low rate of postage of 1 cent a
pound charged on second-class mall
matter, which includes not only newspapers
but magazines and miscellaneous
periodicals. The actual loss growing
out of the transmission of this secondclass
mail matter at 1 cent a pound
amounts to about J63.000.000 a year.
The average cost of the transportation
of this matter is more than 9 cents a
pound.
It appears that the average distance
over which newspapers are delivered
to their customers is 291 miles, while
the average haul of magazines is 1,049,
and of miscellaneous periodicals, 1,128
miies. Thus, the average haul of the
magazine is three and one-half times
and that of the miscellaneous periodicals
nearly four times the haul of the
daily newspaper, yet all of them pay
the same postage rate of 1 cent a
pound. The statistics of 1907 show that
second-class mail matter constituted
?3.91 per cent of the weight of all the
mail, and yielded only 5.19 per cent of
the revenue.
The figures given are startling, and
show the payment by the government
of an enormous subsidy to the newspapers,
magazines and periodicals, and
congress may well consider whether
radical steps should not be taken to
reduce the deficit In the postofflce department
caused by this discrepancy
between the actual cost of transportation
and the compensation exacted
therefor.
A great saving might be made,
amounting to much more than half of
the loss; by imposing upon magazines
and periodicals a higher rate of postage.
They are much heavier than
newspapers, and contain much higher
proportion of advertising to reading
matter, and the average distance of
tjheir transportation is three and a
half times as great.
The total deficit for the last fiscal
year in the postofflce department
amounted to $17,500,000. The branches
of its business which it did at a loss
wert? the second-class mail service, in
which the loss as already said was
$63,000,000, and the free rural delivery
in which the loss was $28,000,000.
These losses were in part offset by the
profits of the* letter postage and other
sources cf income. It would seem wise
to reduce the loss upon second-class
mail matter, at least to the extent of
preventing a deficit in the total operations
of the postoffice.
I commend the whole subject to
congress, not unmindful of the spread
of intelligence which a low charge for
carrying newspapers and periodicals
arsist. I very much doubt, however,
the wisdom of a policy which constitutes
so large a subsidy and requires
additional taxation to meet It.
There is very little objection to be
urged to the common sense and logic
of the foregoing; but if congress should
carry the president's suggestions 10
their legitimate conclusions, the result
would be of very great moment to the
business of the newspaper publishers
of the country.
Under the law now, newspapers are
supposed to be carried free of postage
in the counties in which they are pub
lished and to go from the office of publication
to subscribers throughout the
country at the rate of one cent a
pound.
The object of free postage was to encourage
the spread of information, and
that it has had this effect there is no
question; but the laws of free competition
have very naturally and properly
given all the advantage of free postage
to the buyers of newspapers, leaving
the publishers little or no direct benefit.
This concession of free postage and
reduction rate of 1 cent a pound is commonly
called a subsidy; but the practical
result to the publisher does not
bear out this designation. His profit
is no greater than if his postage acC(
unt had all along been on a strict
basis of value received.
Of course, we would not undertake to
dispute the figures of the president to
the effect that the cost of carrying
second-class matter is 9 cents a pound;
but it is nevertheless a fact that there
are Hundreds or Dig dailies mat send
tons of papers by express that could
have gone by mall at only 1 cent a
pound, and they would not do this unless
there is In it. either better service
or more economy.
But whether the newspapers derive
any benefit from the so-called subsidy
or not, there Is no question of the
fact that an increase in the rate on
second-class postage from 1 cent a
pound to 8 cents a pound, will bring
about a very material shake up and readjustment
in the present methods of
the newspapers, and there will be an
appreciable increase in subscription
rates, all along the line.

contract upon which a franchise was
secured for Gastonia, stipulating that

This project is only a part of the

TAX RETURN RECORDS. i
The comptroller general has adopt- i
ed a new plan for filing the tax re- .
turn records and it promises to save
labor and facilitate examination.
Any way the auditor undertakes to
go about it, the taking, folding- and
backing of twelve or fifteen thousand
returns is quite a big undertaking.
Heretofore, the auditor has been taking
tax returns on fiat sheets, prepared
for the purpose, backing them after- <
ward, folding them and arranging them I
in alphabetical order by township, the
task requiring days and weeks of very <
hard labor. i
Auditor Hunter, who is probably one J
of the most systematic officials in the 1
state, keeps his returns in pigeon holes,
and is always able to lay his hand on
any desired piece of the 12,000 or 15,000
records almost at a moment's notice.
The new plan provides for the binding
of the returns in books by townships
without folding or backing. One
side of the blanks contain the itemized
questions, the same as heretofore, and
on the other side there is no printing.
There are however, three holes through
the left hand margin, and the idea is
to arrange the returns alphabetically as
they are taken and bind them into flat
In- foien^klnj
This plan, it is understood, originat- s
ed in Edgefield county, and because of <
it? convenience and satisfaction, the t
comptroller general has decided to put >
it into use throughout the state. t
Auditor Hunter did not like the new
arrangement much at first; but he is
going to try it and will no doubt find
it entirely satisfactory.
THE NEXT CENSUS.
For the purpose of the next census,
to be taken next spring, York county
is to be divided Into twenty-three districts
with one enumerator in each district.

Bethesda township is to be divided
into three districts and Is to have three
enumerators.
Broad River township Is to be divided
Into two districts and Is to have two
enumerators.
Bullock's Creek township Is to be divided
Into two districts and Is to have
two enumerators.
Catawba township Is to have four
enumerators, two In the township outside
of the city of Rock Hill, and two
in the city of Rock Hill.
Ebenezer township is to be divided
into two districts and is to have two
enumerators.
Fort Mill township Is to be divided
Into two districts and is to have two
enumerators.
York township Is to be divided into
four districts and Is to have four
enumerators, one for the town of Yorkvllle.
The enumeration work Is to be done
principally during: the month of May,
and It is now estimated that the enumerators
will receive from about $75
to $125 each.

THE CIRCUIT COURT.
The case of the Southern Railway
against Pride Ratterree, which was In
progress when the last issue of The
Enquirer went to press, resulted in a
partial victory for each party to the
suit.
The suit was brought by the plaintiff
for the purpose of ousting the defendant
from certain lots alleged to be
on the plaintiff's right of way.
The land in dispute Included as stated,
about one fifty-fifth part of an acre,
along the plaintiffs right of way.
There were three small sheet Iron .
shacks on the land, that had been i
erected at sundry times by the defendant.
The defendant did not undertake
to show any paper titles. The plalntlfT
offered the testimony of Its engineers 1
to show that It properly owned the land
claimed; but was unable to establish j
Its lines with absolute precision, be- ,
cause of the obliteration of old land
marks. The defendant was able to j
prove that two of the shacks had been ,
standing on the disputed ground for i
more than twenty years; but was un- 1
able to show that the third had been 1
standing as long as ten years. The
jury found that the land occupied by
two of the shacks belonged to the de- '
fendant, and that the land occupied by ,
the other, belonged to the plaintiff. All ]
of the shacks are partly on the land of 1
the plaintiff and partly on the land of *
the defendant, and the effect of the (
<? ' ? '"? /^Afnn/lanf fha t 1
> eiuit'l IU 51YC Hie uciviiuuui * ?%
part of the plaintiff's land that is
covered by the shacks that have been j
there for more than twenty years.
The verdict which is outlined and '
explained above, was not reached until j
after a long and tedious tie up. The j
|ury took the papers at about 11 o'clock t
Wednesday, remained out all night and
reported on the convening of court yes- j
terday morning. J. E. McDonald for
olaintiff. W. M. Dunlau and G. W. S. 1
Hart for defendant.
?
The next case taken up after the c
Ratterree case went to the jury, was t
:hat of D. L. Shleder vs. the Southern *
railroad. This case first came up for ^
trial at the 1908 term of the court, hav- i
ng been brought to recover possession a
>f a part of a shipment of cigars and
1500 damages for the refusal of the
lefendant to deliver said cigars to de- I
'endant. The jury gave the plaintiff
special and punitive damages in the *
> Li 111 U1 f 6UU, Hj/Jicm tuv ou|'tv?<v tl
:ourt sent the case back on the ground t
hat the allowance of punitive damages *
vas Improver under the testimony. At c
he second trial the same state of facts f
was Improper under the testimony. At
jury gave actual damages in the sum
of $32.25. M. B. Jennings, Esq., for
plaintifT; J. E. McDonald, Esq., for defendant.
The court is now engaged on the cqse
of Samuel Friedheim vs. the Manchester
cotton mills. This is a suit by the
plaintiff for damages against the defendant,
on an injunction on account
of dye water and other objectionable
refuse running from defendant mills
through a stream on plaintiffs land.
The case was tried a year ago with the
result that the Jury found for the defendant,
but the Judge set the verdict
aside. Because It was apparent when
this case wajs taken up that It would
consume the balance of the week, all
the Jurors not engaged In It, were discharged.
The cases of E. F. Bell vs. the W. U.
Telegraph company and lone S. Noland
vs. John S. Sadler, were continued.
The National Cash Register company
against McElhaney company has been
settled and it is understood that the
case of Ed Fewell against the Southern
Railway company has been settled.
The case of C. Scott Wilson, administrator,
vs. the Southern Railway company
has been fij *o? .?ext Monday,
and It will be followed by tie case of
the Arcade Cotton Mills vs. the Southern
Railway company, or Stacy McKlbbon
vs. the So. Ry. Co. The case of
McOaskey Register company vs. V. B.
McFadden is fixed for Wednesday, and
Calendar 1 is to be sounded tomorrow
for the purpose of readjusting, the roster.
