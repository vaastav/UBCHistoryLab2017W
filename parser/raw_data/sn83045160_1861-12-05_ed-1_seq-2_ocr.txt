umment's consideration.
THK MMMI THAT
The idea that the North will ever be able to
accomplish the conquest of the fvuth. and ior.c
her under the yoke of the imbeell dynasty at
Washington, has long since been aallllllMll as
an exploded dogma by all intelligent persons in
(.ill I tfX eostfinasU TU most tliat
thi enemy expect lo witness ft the overthrow utf
th- Confoderate povcrnmwit by the .Lsatfection
of its own citizens. A majoriry of these are
falsely allege. by northern demagogue, who
have betrayed their people into th- bloody sup
port of this war. to be friendly to the diabolical
pmposes of the Lincoln wig-warn, and its un
scrupulous agent. It is represented daily that
the great and sublime struggle now transpiring
among us, whose sole purpose is to assert and
vindicate a people's right to govern themselves,
is not iue w-.rk of a united people, but of a few
ambitious and designing politicians, who have
managed by some sort of legerdemain and po
litical chicanery not yet explained, to tear twelve
severirn States from the old American Union
and force them into war against the will of their
citizens. It is accor lingiy expected that upon
the approach of the Lincoln army into the
South, along the border aod the coast, vast
numbers of renegade tones will flock to their
standard, proclaiming an unalterable devotion
to th? desecrate! piece of men' burning that has
been transformed by fanaticism into the black
symbol ot the barbarous outlaw. Tlie establish
ment ef " provision: " State governments, like
the miserable farce ot the I'anhaudie traitors at
Wheeling, is looked upon as the natural se
quence, and the vile engines of tyrannical op
pression that follows, is to accomplish the rest.
The ignorant masses of the North are thus led to
believe that the presence of Federal bayonets will
give a very different complexion to our political
sentiment that we are already dissatisfied and
disaffected from bearing the burdens of a galling
despotism, which cannot be much longer tolera
ted. It is indeed difficult for one. not
acuttomed to peruse the columns of the
Abolition journals, to appreciate that obstinate
fatuity with which they seem to cling to this
one idea." It is the gist of their argument
that beds tyranny hope for success. Other mo
tives than the " relief of the loyalists.'" such as
cupvirt) . revenge, and even self-preservation,
may be urged to keep the war spirit op to the
projr pitch. But the flickering eipectation of
triumph, now dampened by Hull Kim. Oak Hills
and Heiinout , now feebly biaz ng out a! Laurel
Hill. Port Royal and Tybee. finds encourage
ment solely is the thought of a divided South.
Thetory eiemeut, powerless aud impotent as it
is. is expected to do its part of the infamous
work, and the South, it is vainly imagined, is to
fall, like Rome, by the foul machinations of her
own traitorous sons
So far has this delusion obtained among the
enemy, owing to the recent emeutt of a few East
Tennessee traitors, and northern falsehoods re
garding the alleged revulsion of political feeling
on the coast of the Carotinas. that it is openly
acknowledged in many instances to he the sole
and, last hope upon which success can be predi
cated. In considering the question " will the
Southern States return to the Union," a writer
in the St. Louis .Veirj. whose opinions seem to
lie endorsed by that paper, denies that tliere is
unity of sentiment amog the rebels " on the
question oi war, aud asserts that were ihN
true, the Government would best subserve the
ends of justice and humani'v by making a good
treaty wirh them, and let them go." The writer
reasons thus :

By so doing, ai! this talk about the North
whipping the South, etc., is done away. Nothing
hat beeu done but destroy a foul conspirarv
against a government, the best ever known, and
,n T7 pwiicnmr as valuable to the South as
tneor..i; which has ever, aud ever will, if al
lowed to live, j.rosper aud protect all its loyal
citirej,.
This 5s a v- v palpable ha-kine do . n from
the lofty boastiugs with whi. li we were replied
by the northern press at the i oimoeiieeinent of
taewar. Then w were to be "whipped cas

of the New York Trtlmn. n ,w we are merely
to be "overthrow n" by proviaioual abo ti.ins past

luents. It has hewn bat rocently asrrrtainel.
that tlie " half-clothe.1, half-paid, half-starved
ivbe! army," whose disbanding the Fabian
MpCixllax ha. so patiently lmen in siting,
has suflicient coherency to last a lew months
longer. The fact it further manifest that the
reliels, according to the confession of the enemy
themselves, "fight like devils," aud do not take
to their heels as expected at the sight of a Fed-
ml bayonet. Other hopes dispelled, the "one
idea" that we are A IsjUn back on as

It will require time and hard blows to dispel

It was announced in the morning papers that

THE RECEPTION AT THE DEPOT.
As early as eight o'clock some two or three
thousand people, including mauy ladies, assein
bled at the depot to weloome Gen. Fremont to
the city. A large police force, uuder Col. Iud
ley, was present, anj preserved a large ojieu
space in the interior, and a passage way to the
entrance, for the una of committees and got thl
Brandt's cornet baud, in full uniform, was sta
tioned at the west end of the depot.
At half past eight the whistle of the train was
heard below, and immediately the crowd was
largely augmented In a tew minntes after, the
train entered the depot, the band playing tlie
"Star Spangled Banner " Fremont and his
party occupied the rear car. which was immedi
ately surrounded bjr the crowd. A portion oi
tlie committee entered the car. and soon return
ed with gloomy faces. The cause wits immedi
ately ascertained that the general declined a pub
lic reception, and was determined to pr.s-.s !
east immediately, without an hour's halt in Ch
cinnati. It was stated that he had never author
ized auy one to announce that he would remain
here to receive public honors.
AtVr some delay, au old public hack, eugagt-d
by too committee, was driven up to the 'four,
and General Fremont and the indomitable Jessi -were
escorted thereto by the committee, while
the band played a national air. The moment
ttie general made his appearance, in- was enthu
siastically greeted, the cheers being continued
until after he was seated in his carriage He
wore a military overcoat aud cap. and uncover
ed his head as he passed through tie -rowd. The
general looks a little careworn, but expressed
Himself as feeling well
Following the general and his lady came their
children and several members of his stall.
There appeared to be one fault as to the carriage
arrangements, and they were taken back into th-depot-
Th" genera! immediately called the hack
driver to him, and ordered him to drive rapidly
to the Little iliauii depot. The driver whipjied
up. and away went the carriage and its distiu
guished intnates without escort, but greeted by
me cheers of the people- 1 be crowd started af
ter the carriage, cheering aud shouting; but the
Jehu toon f ecoeded In getting his distinguished
load aw ay from the enthusiastic din aud clatter.
, AT THE Bt'UET II' ii se
Hie crowd not understanding the general's
immediate destination, followed the directions of
the morning papers, and made for the Burnet
House. Our repo. tor followed leisurely, taking
iu his course the published line of march. The
people were assembled at various points along
the line, and mai.y flags were displayed. On
Founh street, especially, large crowds were con
gregated, patiently awaiting the arrival of the
Pathfinder. At half-past nine o'clock, the crowd,
in and around the Hume, House, numbered
several thousand. They were looking ; anxiously
for the procession ; at last William Wisewell, ol
the reception committee, arrived, and taking
position, announced that (len. Fremont had
gone to the Little Miami depot aud would not
step. The announcement was regarded as a
" tsjB."
Rome one proposed thn-e cheers for Fremont,
which were heartily given. Then thn-e mure
went up for "The L'uiou, the Constitution and

of gallaut men, was in reality but little better
tliau a military mob. they were not skillfully
marshaled to the fight, and, through lack of con

Then- is no description of n listance, nu rerial

and numliers. The mam questiou to be cm
sidecfxl is the willingness tor .sacrifice; and il
the tausc which iuspired the French and British
in tile Crimea to find a lodgment on the para
pet ot the Redan or to make a lane of bodies
through the " hell-fire " of the MalakotV, was
good enough tor such sublimely heroic efforts,
oOTs should lie strong -nough to carry ns
through the rebel fastnesses that bar ut from the

with plenty of men an 1 cannon,'' was the fa
vorite sayirig of a celebrated European gewral .
ami 1 am reminded bv the maziin, tliat there is
1 predator ant iu Africa, which at times, turn
out so potently, that its billions overflow whole
belts ot country, in a straight maich, for miles
and mile-., enveloping aud devouring every
thing, whether it be umn or beast, within its
track. Kven th bohemnth, the elephant, aud
the otherwise unconquerable lion, tak to tin
water, to avoid the stilling and impalpable at
tacks of the resistless, creeping swarm. Let
thi re be no tear, therefore, that Manassas is im
pregnable to our arms. Nothing is invulnerable
to due application of strtitrrb sn 1 courage
We saw tliat tlie other day at Port Royal, and
if Manassas bo the object of our young chief
tain's eye, it will bo carried, and presented to
the country, perhaps, as I Cl.r:;ma present by
his devoted troops.
At to tlie time !rt:n, it it almost as hard to hx
tlie date ol movement as it was a month ngo.
Tim.- certainly is much that is yet to be done
before MeClellan wiii h , - ti ! move. The
leview which took place OH Wednesday last,
though it uumbei.-d seventy thousand men. ex
led but a third d our eutir fores iu that
necessary style o' piassive evolution ; and it
would seein by the patieut manner in which the
l.eueral has conducted these tinid examinations,
even truiii the day be bcg.a tho organization ot
brigades, that he intends to be thorough with
them all. That, in short, ho designs, most
likely, to give every corps tt urate iu lesson, und
the practice of his eye, before making the tiual
step of the geueral tasfc.
In evideuuo ot' this, we find a review of all the
irgiuieuis ai Washington ordered for Tuesday

not impressed with the belief that a move, just

that the army here would be held in check until

Ik-thus arrested ai r'je . -y mimi'iit ot their ex
ultation over their escape of the blockade, and
brought back in iiruuemuy to our shores. The
degradation of their position is deepened by the
seizure ot their iHspatcbes and papers, which
contain, no doubt, full instructions from the
Richmond government as to the course tliey acre
to pursue iu Kurope, and the valuable conirr.er
cia! privileges they were to offer to Urea Britain
..ud France, as a condition for the recognition
..f the Southern Confederacy. The Lieut. Fair
