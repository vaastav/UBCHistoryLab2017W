PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGES
Whatever the difference of opinion that may ex
ist as to the subject-matter of President Wilson's an
nual me- age to Congress, there must be unanimity on
one point, namely, its brevity: and in brevity there
is much virtue, whether it deals with spoken or writ
ten word.- Presidential messages to Congress have
never been remarkable for the penurious use of words.
Or. the contrary, for most part, they have been ex
haustive to the point of exhaustion. One of the mes
sages sent to Congress by President Taft used up
some 25.000 words. President Roosevelt. a3 might be
expected, was given to prolixity of expression, al
though what he said usually had a "punch" in it.
President Cleveland's messages were inclined to pre
penderosity. yet they were admirable state papers,
ard he was besides a coiner of words and given to
resurrecting pharases that had fallen into "innocuous
desuetude." Roosevelt, too. showed facility in digging
into .musty tomes in order to find expressions that
would attract instant attention, and he is still prolif
ic in digging out of the literary grists of the past
words and phrases intended to confound his enemies
hv their ant aDDlication.
McKinley's messages to Congress were seldom of
unusual length, and they contained none of the um
brageous ornamentation and phrases that have served
the purposes of others. And yet his messages were
models of clearness and excellent diction.
President Wilson is, without doubt, the greatest
master of words in the I'nited States today, and they
are not "weasel" words, as some of his critics would
have us believe. His public speeches and his mes
sages to Congress show a clarity of speech and a hu
man nerspective that iiave been seldom equaled, at
least by any modem statesman: and it cannot be
truthfully charged against him that he is verbose in
either, for. however people may differ as to the opin
ions expressed, the President's speeches end messages
to Congress contain food for thought and, for the most
part, tersely expressed. Many speakers and writers,
though they be eloquent, indeed, fail to remember that
"Words are but leaves, aud where they most abound.
Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found."
President Wilson's recent message to Congress
was directed wholly to domestic subjects, principally
the problem of railroad legislation. It was not to be
expected that he would deal in a message of this kind
with the many international problems that have devel
oped as a result of the European war. These are
too complex and frequently of too delicate a nature
to be discussed in detail in a message to Congress;
and there is nothing to be gained by a mere reference
to them. The United States has its own domestic
problems to solve, including railroad legislation, and
the President has clearly stated his position. Labor's
rights are co-equal with the rights of employers of
labor, but they are not paramount, and the President
has not lost sight of the fact, so far as the interests ]
of the public are concerned and that railroad em- <
ployees should not be permitted to paralyze railroad <
transportation without first exhausting every means j
afforded by conciliation and arbitration. Legislation t
placing the railroads and their employees directly i
under the direction of the President, in case of strikes, t
will no doubt be enacted at this session of Congress. 1

THE SEEING EYE 3
o
In an eastern educational publication we read that v
an educator who wanted to find out how much first- t
hand knowledge his pupils possessed, lately sent them 0
a list of questions, of which the following are a few: F
"How many segments are there in the w
bodies of flies and spiders, and to which of j,
them are tho legs attached?"
"Do the V's on the face of a clock point
toward the center or the rim?"
"Is the convexity or the concavity of the p
new moon toward the sun?" C(
"Do vines twist the same way as the hi
threads of a screw, or the opposite way?" n
"What are the first flowers of spring and m
the last of autumn.'" to
"Is dew deposited on clear, cloudy or h:
windy nights?" th
"Which hoofs are on the ground when a ar
horse walks, trots, canters and paces?" pi
"Do birds ever come back to their old th
nests?" w
"Why do shoes creak, and why does shoe
blacking shine when rubbed with a shoe
brush?" to
Few adults can answer all these questions, pe
and such answers as they are able to give are, in wt
many cases, the result of reasoning.
Robert Louis Stevenson somewhere speaks of Wj
the seeing eye and.gives evidence of his own powers
of observation by attributing It -to un uneducated man.
It has often been remarked that the hnblt of reading
fiction tends to dull the memory and that the use of
books of reference betrays us all into distrusting our
own knowledge. Yet the business man, or the pro
fessional man, has even more need than the woods
man or the former to see all that passes around him,
register It automatically and retain It in momory.
Facts which at first seem trivial often take on, in
the quickly shifting course of life, the utmost im
portance. It Is well worth patient training to culti
vate the seeing eye.
Uecently a mother in an Alaskan town, whose
invalid son, aged eight, had not been taught to read,
was reproached for the fact by a friend whoso son
had learned to read at four. Her defense was that
her boy had learned the habit of seolng and question
ing every thing that came his way; she clinched the
argument by asking what the other lad had read in
his four years. Nothing but boys' books, of course.
WAGES AND CAMPAIGN CRIES
Tl?o Steel Trust may not be aware of the fact,
but its action in raising the wages of 200,000 employees
has given the lie to the late lamented Republican
campaign.
That campaign, state in its simplest form, was an
effort to scare the people into voting for Hughes.
From stump and platform, from billboard and street
car. from advertising page and editorial column, the
Republican National Committee shrieked its claim that
the re-election of Wilson would bring disaster and
that only the triumph of Hughes and the restoration
of ancient tariff schedules could save the country
from a terrible panic.
Part, a singularly large part, of the voters were
misled by this clamor, but enough remained sane to
return Mr. Wilson to the White House?and promptly
the Steel Trust, greatest of the Hughes-supporting in
terests. shows how much it fears panic by adding
$20,000,000 to its yearly pay roll. As if this were not
enough, the Cotton Mill Trust of New England gratis
a similar increase to its 33,000 operatives.
It ought to be a cold, cold day before Republican
calamity howling deceives any one again.
Another chance for a good bet would be, who is
the hardest loser. Chairman Willcox or Candidate
Hughes?
Roosevelt hasn't congratulated Wilson yet, but
maybe he's waiting for the letter of thanks which the
President owes him.
With the thermometer fifty degrees below, the
Republicans of the Fourth certainly received something
more than a frost.
Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to
drink, may now be changed in Fairbanks by coal, coal
everywhere but not a chunk to burn.
The Rankin" Republican is Miss Jeanette, not Un
cle Joe Cannon.
| Mr. Wilson's success has been attributed to almost
j everything and why may it not be due to Mr. Wilson?
:
It would be interesting to know what Roosevelt
and Hughes really think of each other.
BURY THE PAST
(Seward Post)
Somebody woiking for Uncle Sam blundered a
few months ago and it is up to Seward folks to repair
the blunder cheerfully and go on about our business.
When a site was surveyed for the radio station
at the head of the bay, the ground was 3till public
domain and it would have been possible for Uncle 1
Sam to reserve for his own use sufficient land for the
station before granting patent. To have done so would i
have worked far less hardship on the homesteader j
than the fact that pin-headed officials delayed issu
ance of patent until the matter had to be taken be- |
fore the Secretary of the Interior himself for a just .
ruling.
.Vow another branch of the government needs the
site for a radio station and puts it up to Seward to
secure it. '
The natural feeling of the homesteader is to soak f
Uncle Sam good and plenty for the trouble and delay t
he was put to in securing the ground. But the gov
ernment is impersonal and unfortunately it is impos- t
slble to soak the individuals who caused the trouble. |
Any effort by an individual to get even with the gov
ernment merely works a hardship on the rest of the
people. In this instance it would work a direct bur- 9
den upon the people of Seward, who are in no way I
responsible for the delay in securing the land. <
The only thing to <jo in a case of this kind is to t
let bygones be bygones and join in bringing to pass
better things. j
Let the owner and the people interested in bring- (i
ing the radio station hero do the right thing, the
latter reimbursing the former a fair amount, and pre- '
sent Uncle Sam with a site for a radio station. "
Smile and say you like it.

THAT DISH OF CROW a
w
(Cordova Times) w
Many years ago, the story runs, when this glor- ^
ious republic was younger and political enthusiasm
expressed itself in foolish exultation such as we se
late and deep thinking people do not indulge, two
nen of opposite persuasions laid a wager, the winner "
:o dine on chicken, the loser to have crow. And if
hus the bet was paid, to the glee of those who wit- tl
tessed the consumption of the scolding stable bird of re
hievishly covetous nature. From that day to this w
he political loser has been the crow eater, and thou
;ands suffer just as much from the thought of it as
f they were compelled actually to nibble the last
hreds from the crow skeleton.
There are a lot of us who can take defeat with
>ut a grimace and a yell, just as miny who cannot
rin without lampooning the vanquished, and between
he two the days following an election are sorry m
nough for the fellow equable temperament who ac- se
epts all events as the will of fate, smiles and bucks T'
ito the next thing in which he believes and for
rhlch he is willing to fight?and to laugh if he loses, j
ist as he laughs if he wins.
Eat your crow like a man.

Let us in Seward hope that the result of the
residential election means that Franklin K. Lane will lOi
mtinue as secretary of the Interior. Of all men be;

tilroad. He has evidently taken time from" his
ultitudinous duties to give his personal attention
i what is proceeding in this remote district. Evidence t
is been found that he reads everything he can find
lat will show how matters stand up here. His name
id reputation are bound up with the government
oject, and to swap him for some other now in cai
e crossing of the stream might well be calamitous. ^

A NEWSPAPER WITHOUT STORE "ADS" WOULD
BE AS INCOMPLETE AS A CITY
WITHOUT STORES
Try to imagine a city without stores! You
wouldn't like to live in it. It would be the lone
somest place, the least livable place, Imaginable.
Can you imagine a newspaper without store ad
vertisements?
Such a newspaper would lack the same elements
of interest which would be missing in the city with
out stores.
Next to a city without stores, as a place to
shun, would be a city without GOOD STORES.
NeNxt to a newspaper without store ads, as
something to avoid, would be a newspaper without
Adequate, Informing, Interesting, store ads.
If you have never considered what a big part is
played in the life of this city by its stores, think
for a moment what the city would be like without
them.
If it has never occurred to you how much of
the news interest of a newspaper is founn in its
store ads, try to imagine your newspaper without
these uds.
