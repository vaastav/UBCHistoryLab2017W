Secretary Alger's annual report, says
a correspondent, is somewhat remark
able for its omissiAne. It does tlot
contain the 'round robin" sent from
Santiago, nor does It contain "Teddy"
Roosevelt's report, which "Teddy"
told the "investigating commission"
he hoped they would get and read.
There are others who would be glad
bo read that report, provided It could
be had as it was written, and as it was
received at the war department. To
read Alger's report, one would sup
pose that there had been no scandal
conecbed with the conduct of the war,
and that everything had moved along
as smooth as esilk, whereas, every in
telligent man, in the United States
knows to the contrary. Some day the
truth may be written about the war,
but there are no signs that tt will be
soon. Had & democratic bouse been
elected, the outlook. would have been
very different. , ' j
- A well known , Washington writer
says . that president - MoKinAey has
made it plain to "senators and repre
sentatives who have called upon. him.
tdnce Spain agreed to our terms for
the surrender of the Philippines to us.
that he has hot made up his mind what
we ought to do with the Philippines
and will not do so until we have had
them under military control long
enough to get the Information, neoes-,
sary to form an intelligent opinion.
That sort Of talk has fetrengthened
the chances of the treaty of peace for
ratification at this session of oongress,
as it coincides wtth the opinion of
three-fourths of the senators regard
less of party, The opinion la practi
cally snamimous that the taking of Che
islands away from Spain was the right
thing to do, but there the unanimity
ends. What sort of govsrmment will
follow our military rule of the islands
nobody can say at this time. It will
depend largely upon publlo sentiment
in this country, and that will be gov
erned by circumstances. .;
The Hartford Times in referring to
Dr Rodman's suggestions albout the
care of the eyes says: At Che annual
meeting of the OannetfUcut Medical
society, Dr C. S. Rodman In the presi
dent's address suggested that when
children awe to enter school tihere
should be an examination of their
eyes, with reference to prompt treat
ment If defects exist which require at
tention. A large number of school
children have such defects, and many
of them can be cured or made of little
oensequence if taken' in Ume. One
incidental advantage of these entrance
examinations will be that by compar
ing the record -then obtained with a
later record af ter some time7 spent in
school, something can 'be learned of
the effect produced by school life and
conditions 00 the pupil. If his eyes
are in worse condition at the second
examination, it la probable that the
physical condition of the schoolroom
or the qauntity and kind of work re
quired are et fault Many school
rooms are badly lighted, and this Is
one of the reasons for impaired eye
sight among children. It is one which
is practically disregarded by most
school committees. Insufficient or un
property placed lights 'and small or
poor print In text books : contribute
much to damage children's eyes. Any
thing which tends to make this con
spicuous to those who Are responsible
is worUi encouraging,1 and it d al
most certain that a double set of ex
aminations properly explained will
have this effect The Yale Medical
Journal has called attention to the
subject in an article which would be
wholesome reading for every one con
cerned With school management, and,
Incidentally, for 'every1 parent who has
reasonable Interest In his children's
welfare. . . - ? - J ' - , , ' I

ABOUT RUBBERS,
i
There was n 'time, not so many
years back, when It was not quite fas
hionable to appear too robust A lit
tle languor was considered rafher be
coming in a young woman. Beauty
was most IbeautMul (When frail. But
thaf. day has passed. The tpale, droop
ing, in-door girl has given way to the

Health has received the seal of fas-
tHon. -, 1
s And everything that conduces to
health Is now good form. For in
stance, in the matter of wearing rub
bers. A feW' years ago a good many
women objected to wearing rubbers
on the ground that they detracted
Prom the trim appearance of the foot.
But everybody knows that nothing
else ruins the health as quickly as wet
feet, and the only possible way to have
dry feet especially in winter Is to
wear rubbers. So rubbers Ihave come
back into style as an Indispensable
adjunct to good health.
The added fact that rubbers are now
so nruch more shapely and graceful In
the'lr lines than they were a dozen
years ago, and hat tlhey are now
made In such infinite variety, has
served of course, still further to in
crease ' their popularity. Harper's

"No," responded Thompson, shaking
his head. Tm a man of my word.

WAR SONG OF 98.

Ho! fathers roumd. we'll sing ft stave
to make the Saxon pale,
And send the red blood boiling
, through the brave heart of the Gael.
What reck we Albion's wooden walls,
What reck her Corsair crew?
Or be their jackets red or green, we'll
sh'aipe them work to do;
By Cahil of the wine-red hand, we'll
carve them work to do. '
Long, long beneath the despot's heel,

Long sighed and wept and vigil kept
for freedom's coming day.
So now we hail its advent, boys, with
such a round of cheers :
As woke Duhgannon's echoes wild to
haiil the volunteers,
And wear if freedom's grave be dug,
'twill be With bloody spears!
Oh, how our eouls will lighten up, oh,
how our hearts will thrill, -To
see Tyroonnell's troopers burst
from royal Aileadh hill;
To see them sweep by town and field
and in their vanguard wae,
The cross, the white cross of our sins,
' the banner of the brave
'Twill float so grand from Kerry's
hills to Swllly's foamy wave.
How proudly in after days the chron

Of how we bathed babe freedom's
limbs in Streul's holy well, -When
fifty thousand armed men, loud
spoke the sponsor's vow,
And swathed the babe in green and
gold, put garlands on fts brow
A coronal of shamrocks upon Its placid
brow. .
I know of one who hopes to see, of one
who hopes to share
The danger and the glory of baptlelng
freedom there;
And so to you and you, ah, standing
side by side,
We'll raise old Erin's drooping form,
quell braggart England's pride;
Strong in the bond of love and truth,
mock England's soulless pride;
Them let the beacon fires be lit from
smiling Lee to ban.
The north holds out its arms to greet

One wild hurrah, one bursting shout
of joyous jubilee,
We'll make another Limerick, another

FUNERAL OF WOLFE TONE. s
The following, from- Gilbert's His
tory of 'Dublin, possesses a wonderful
interest for every true Irish heart:
"The ceremony of waking Theobald
Wdlfe Tone was performed in Novem-.
ber, "1798, at No 63 High street, the
residence of his kinsman, William
Dunhaven, who was totally opposed-to
Tone's political opinions. He was a
member of a corps of yeomanry and
possessed some influence with the ter
rorists of the day. By means of that
Influence, probably assisted in high
quarters by the Interference of the
Hon George Knox, the body of Tone
and his effects, clothes, uniform and
sword, was given up to his friends.
The two Dunhavlns, provided with a
written order, went with four men to
the provost or the body, and it was
given up (to them -by Major Sandys.
It was taken to William Hunhavln's
house in High street, where his fath
er and mother were then living, and
laid out In a room on the second floor,
The surviving relatives state that the
mother bore up astonishingly against
the trials which betel her in such
quick succession, but the poor father
seemed to have been overwhelmed by
this last calamity. The body was
kept two nights ait Dunhavln's. A
great number of persons came and sat
in the room where the corpse was laid
out At length the order came from
the government that the iinterment
should immediately take place and as
privately as possible. The funeral, in
conformity with the orders of the au
ttooritles, was attended only .by two
persons. William Dunhavin and John
Ebbs, a brazier, who resided in Bride
street, both were members of a corps
of yeomanry. The remains of Theo
bald Wolfe Tone were Jinterred in the
ancient cemetery of BodenstJown, olose
to the wall (on the south side) of the
ruined abbey that stands in the center
of the graveyard, in the same grave
where his brother's remains were re
cently buried, and those of his grand
father and his uncle repose.

THE VISITING BARBER .
There are many men and their sum-
ber is constantly increasing, who are
shaved at their home3 dally by a bar
ber Who comes for that purpose, and
so there is a considerable number o'f
barbers who do more or less of their
work away from the shop. But there
la perhaps only one man to the city
who is exclusively a visiting barber.
Most of the work done In houses is
performed before 10 o'clock in the
morning. The barber has a few such j
customers Whom he attends to before
that hour, but most of his work is
done in down town business offices be
tween the hours of 9:30 A. m. and 4:30
p. m. ,
Ten years or so ago the visiting bar
ber, then having a shop in a downtown
street, went out one day to shave a
customer in hi3 office, a wholesale bus"
lness man, who was too busy to come
to the shop. Thereafter -he shaved
this eustomeri regularly at his office,'
and from that beginning grew his reg
ular trade. As outside customers
came to him he attended to them all
personally, and 'finally, about three
years ago, he gave up his shop alto
gether and has since devoted himself
entirely to visiting work, whWh he
finds more profitable. His customers
are chiefly among wholesale drug mer
chants. For years they all were, but
then a wholesale leather merchant
was added to his list, and he has now
a number of customers in the swamp.
These customers did not all desire
to be shaved at the same time, and
so It was toomparatively easy to make
a working schedule. The barber ap
pears at the office df each customer at
the same time daily. The places to be
visited are all pretty close together,
and but little time is lost in going
from one to another. Partly for that
reason and partly because the work Is
done on six days in the week only, in
stead Of seven, the charge (Tor this
work Is a little less than for work done
at home. It is $2 a week, Which, how
ever. Includes hair cutting as well as
shaving.
The object of the business man who
is shaved at his offitoe ds to save time.
The object of the man wno is shaved
at home is both convenience and com
fort. . The man who is shaved at home
is likely always to ibe shaved by the
'same man, a barfber whose work he
likes and whom he has picked out him
self. The (barber comes to the house
seven days , in the Week at the same
hour dally. The ruling price for this
work in the very 'best- shops is $15 a
imonth. Some shops do the work for
(12, and it is sometimes done for $10.
! The man who pays $15 a month for
the barber to come to his house pays
Chat for a" dally shave only." Hair cut
ting and other work are extra. For
hair cutting he pays 75 cents. ' If he
has his hair cut two or three times a
month and has any other work done.
his bill may easily reach $18 a month,
which is a figure not unusual. It may
come to more than that . If the bar
ber has to wait, no account Is taken
of a detension of a few minutes, tout
ft he has to wait half an hour or more
the time Is charged for at the rate ot
fl an hour. New York Sun.
NEW USE FOR STEEL.
A' new use has been found for steel
in the manufacture of (harness..' An
English firm makes a steel trace, con
sisting df a narrow ribbon of the met
al, Strom three-f ourths of an inch .to
one inch wide, rolled very thin and
cased in leather. A trace of this kind
has attained a tenslble breaking strain
of 4,575 'pounds, while an ordinary
leather trace of the best quality, test
ed at the same time, broke at, a strain
of 2,700 pounds.. Besides being light
er and stronger than the ordinary
trace, the, steel ribbon, is albout 20 per
cent cheaper. The steel Is of the finest
quality, and can be twisted in any di
rection. The same kind of steel has
been introduced in England' In the
manufacture of 'practically puncture
less tire. The steel ribbon, eased in
rubber, is placed inside of the ordinary
tire. It is said that it does not In the
least impair the reslstence of the
wheel, and has actually tjhe effect of
increasing the speed of the machine.

LANGUAGES IN PARLIAMENT.
Switzerland differs from other coun
tries in many things, and one of the
most remarkable Is the way In which
its parliamentary debates are con
ducted. A Swiss member of parlia
ment can express thlapelf 'in French,
German or Italian, and the privilege
is freely used. When the president of
the federal assembly speaks in German,
his remarks are translated by a sec
retary In. olose proximity to him. All
the laws and resolutions, before being
voted upon, are drawn up in French,
German and Italian, and every, official
