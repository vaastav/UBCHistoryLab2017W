Congress.
Oo kbe nt iij of tbe present teoiion of Con.
greu, December 1, Mr. Cox, of Ohio, Intro
daoed Into the Home a preamble and resolution
which bare beea published In this paper, con
demning the arreot and ImpiieonmeLt :t citizsni
WHITE MEN out of the jurisdiction of tbe
State of their reiidence, in which States there
. was 00 inmrrection or rebellion or prelenae
thereof, and demanding that inch arrest shall
hereafter eeaee. On motion of Mr. Colfax,
Abolitionist, of Indiana, the preamble and res
olution were laid on tbe table bj a rote of 80
Io40.
On tbe same day, Mr. Richardson, of Illi
nois, offered in the House ft resolution reqoeet
. . ' ing the President to inform tbe House what
citinns WHITE MEN of Illinois erenow
confined in prisons ont of that btate, tbe charges
' against ibetn, end where and by whose author
ity they were arrested. Mr. Lotij, Aboil'
tioniat, of Illinois, stored to lay the resolution
00 the table, which was carried by ft rote of 74
to 40
On the stcsnd day of the session, December
S, Mr. Powru., of Kentucky, offered in the
Senate ft resolution respecting the arret t and
- Uylionmrol oU!bm WiHTB MBN of
- Kentucky, outside of tbe State, similar to that
offered in the House the day before by Mr.
RicHAaDHn. Mr. Wilson, AbolitioniBt, of
Massachusetts, objected to tbe present oonsider
tion of Mr. Powell's resolution, and it was
laid orsr nnder tbe rules
Mr. Powell also on tbe same day offered In
the Senate a joiLt resolution respeo.ing the ar
rest end Imprisonment out of the States ol their
r residence, of citizens WHITE MEN, similar
to that effsred In the House by Mr. Cox on the
first day of the session. Mr. Collamei, Aboil
tiooist, of Vermont, demanded that the reeolu
tion lie orer, end it did lie orer nnder the
rules.
On the third day of tbe session, December
3, Mr. SADLfioar, of Delaware, tffared in tbe
Senate, ft resolution directing the Secrtttry of
War to Inform the Senate whether Dr. John
Laui and Whitilt Meredith, citlsens
WHITE MEN J of tbe State of Delaware, or
either of them, hare been arrested and confined
in Fort Delaware, the time of tbe arrest and
imprisonment, the obarges against them, and
by whose orders they were arrested. Mr. Feb
senden, of Maine, and Mr. Claix, of New
Hampshire, Abolitionists, both called out
simultaneously as soon as the resolution was
read: "Let it lie orer!" Objection being
made, it did lie orer.
On the same day, Mr. Scmnxk, Abolitionist,
Of Massachusetts, offered in the Senate ft reso
lution requesting tbe Secretary ol War to fur.
' Blah the Senate any information which he might
possess with reference to tbe sale into alarery
of free men BLACK MEN captured or seised
' 7 by the rebel forces, and state what steps bare
y been taken to redress this outrage upon human
rights. There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded Is oonsider the resolution, and it was
Adopted. . .
- A stranger, on looking orer these proceedings,
would naturally ask: "Is Ibis, as I hare been
told, country inhabited ebitfly by white men
witb Government founded by white men for
white men?" He could hardly aroid tbe con
. . elusion that. If such was ef er understood to be
the oase, the fact was now quite lost sight of or
forgotten. Here he sees National Legislature
ftdministeriog the most Important branch of the
Government for tbe whole country, jet paaeio;
try with seeming. If not real indifference the lo
r tereste of whit men sod sttending with alacrity
to those ef black men.
We raise) at this time no objection to the
resolution offered by Mr. Bojmes and immedl-
fttely adopted by the Senate. Its object was to
obtain information in regard to the liberty and
personal safety of certain black men. But
.l What a contrast Is exhibited In the Senate and
In the House when the libeity and personal
safety of white men are drawn in question
.,: Then, nil inquiry must be postponed, end not
area present discussion allowed. , Verily,
white men are, with the Abolition majority in
tbe present Congress, at a low rale of discount
ftnd negroes ftt ft high premium.

The One Hundredth Ohio—It. Military Policy in regard to the Slavery

The Ooe Hundredth Ohio, Colonel John C
Gboom, of this olty, Is now encamped near Lx-
' iDgton, Kentucky, under tbe direction of its
'(allant Colonel, seconded by Ite other able offi
cers, tbe regiment le rapidly Improving la dls
. oipllne, and preparing for actlre end efficient
! serrice in (he field. Beside tbe different reci
tations in the schools for the instruction of com
missioned and non-commissioned officers, the
regiment is eogaged In drilling from six to
eight bours daily.
Tbe Ooe Hundredth Ohio is attached to the
Division commanded br General Q- A. Gil-
mors. General Gilmore stands high as an offl
cor and a eentleinnn. He is an Obioan, and is
the distinguished Eosineer who made the prep
laratloDS for the reduotion of Fort Pulaski, end
obtained his Brigadier Generalship as a reward
for meritorioue military seirloes. Tbe officers
and men in his oommand unite in hi praise.
Under him and led by their gallant Colonel, we
shall expect to bear good report from IheofB
cers and men of tbe One Hundredth Ohio.
Lml oltissns of Kentucky are resorting to
tbe olril tribunals of the Sttte and suing out
writ 1 of replevin for the recovery of their fugl
tire slaves. Many of these slaves are found
our militarv camos. Col. Groom, when the
suhleot was practically presented to bim, adopt
ed tbe following course in regaid to this vexed
"contraband" question a line of policy wbloh
we understand, bas been also adopted by Gen,
Gilmorr:
When an officer from a civil court, comes
within the lines of Cot. Groom's camp for the
purpose of taking an alleged slavp, on a
of replevin, from ols of the officers of bis
command, who bas euoh alUgel sUve la his
employ as a eirvnt, (he Colonel has been
guided by tbe following rules, and bas, when
called on for advioe or counsel, given the same
tihls officers:
1st. He assumes that Kentucky is a loyal
State; that she Is fully represented in the Con
gress of tbe United States; that martial law
has not been declared there, end that, therefore
the civil process of the Sttte ie above the mill
tary, and the military subdeivient to the civil
power.
21. That he bas no right to resist tbe exer
else and execution of any civil process properly
issued by competent authority.
3 J- That the effi :ers and men under his com
mand set np no claim to any right ol proper
or interest of aw kind in any kUve witbia tbe
lines oi their cimp
4;b. That if sny mch prep ry as t't de
scribed in the writ of replevin Is within their
camp, they are not awaro of it.
Sth. That if the oivil officer finds any such
property, be must take his own mode of secur
ing it without any assistance from the officers
or men in the camp-
Gib. That if tbe civil officer does fLd fuch
property within tbe camp, tbe Colonel will not
deliver it to hlm4or permit it to be done by any
one nnder bis command; nor will he permit the
civil offioer to be interfered with while in th
nroner exercise or discharge 'ol his ifficia
duties.
7th. No negro will be turned out of the
camp for the purpose of enabling bis master,
an officer or other person to get possession of
bim.
Col. Groom baa also rr quested the officers
under his command Dot to give employment to
an escaped slave, wben tbe fact is established
that he is tbe slave of a loyal master. It is
stated that they have all acquiesced most
heartily, and Indorsed tbe policy.
The Cleveland Herald and Parson
Brownlow.
Tbe Cleveland Herald ought to be ashamed
of itself. In its issue of Monday, it has the
unblushing effrontery to reproduce a portioa of
ooe of Parson Brownlow's old eleotioset ring let
ters, which charges tbe Democracy of the loyal
States wl;h "treason," and ft willingness to
surrender to Jsrr. Davis, and all that sort of
thing! Tbe editor of the Herald knows very
ell, that the old Parson took it all back when
he was at Nashville a short time ago, and vol
unteered to testify to the loyalty and patriotic
devotion to the country of the whole people 0
the North. When Brcwnlow bimeelt admits
that be lied about tbe Democratic party, and
retrao s all that he said derogatory to it, we
submit whether the Herald Is not gu l .y of a
rery dishonorable ao, in reptintiog the false
hoods of the dirty old libeler, who bas been
coining money out of the torrible t mictions
which we are now called upon to endure as a
people! Does the Herald see it 7

oamn near Lexington, Ky., December 1st, 1863,
Colonel John C. tiroom was called to tbe chair,
and Lieulenaut r.lmer was appointed Score

lowing preamble and resolutions, wblob were
unanimously adopted :
Whereas, It bas pleased Almighty God to
take from our regiment our friend and brother
in arms, Captain William II. Thornton, of
Company D, 100th regiment O. V. I., and
whilst we most humbly submit to tbe will of
our Heavenly Father in tbis, to us, sad visita
tion, yet we can not but mourn the early loss
of one who, in all the relation which he sus
tained to tbis regiment as a man and officer,
bas endeared himself to the entire regiment,
and baa shown that bad be lived to meet the
foe in deadly strife, neither bis regiment, his
country, nor his friend would have bad cause
to blush for Captain Thornton.
And whereas, It 1 due to bl memory, aa a
small token of respect to his many virtues,
that we thus formally express our appreciation
of his worth and onr loss, though our loss is
bis everlasting gain; therefore, be it
Ketohed, That in the death of Captain
Thornton, of Company D, lliO.b regiment 'J.
V. I , we beve Iobi a friend, bis company a
kind and excellent Captaio, tbe regiment a
highly promising officer, and tbe couutry a
b.ave and gllaut mtn, who at her call went
forth to deleud, with bis lile, if need be, bis
couii try's honor and ber fltg.
ittolotd, That to bis widow, whoae young
heart baa so suddenly been turned from re
joicing as a bride, witb a bright and joyous
loture, to that of a widow, without one ray of
earthly bope to cheer ber downward way to tie
grave, we tender our deep oundolence in this,
tbe daikeBt hour of ber life. May He, who
alone can suit tin aud comlort her, give to ber
"that coneoiation which the world can neither
give nor take away."
Rnolved, That the proceedings of this meet
log be signed by the ifficers of it, aud that a

[Extract from a Letter on the Battle Field.]
This battle (Antietam) has been the most
eangulnarr of the war, and tbe only one fought
with visible design and npon military princi
ples. Tbe arrangement ol our corps tbe
overlooking position of tbe commanding Gen-eral-rthe
sending Into aolion the right and left
divisions the closing op of tbe oeoter, and fi
nal success excites bewildering admiration,
and carries the mind to tbe great fields of Aas.
terllli snd Wsgram, fought by Napoleon. Of
all this have I spokeo. The heart history of
suob a confliot, purohaisd by tbe life and blood
of twenty thousand men, must be found in the
hospitals. War has Its glories but It has its
ten thousand demons In these human tortures,
that make tbe eye balls ache the heart bleed
' the lips palsy, and tbe brain reel. Tbe sight
Is at first positively unendurable. Tbe life
blood of some la still trlokling away In silent
calmness while the dissevered limbi and ma
niao brain of others give rise to sounds God
. grant I may not again witness.
Bat ye mothers who here seek a son or
wives a husband or sisters a brother or eons
a father know and be oonsoled that even here
tbe band of meroy is watchful, and better oare
. Is bestowed upon your loved ones than might
at first seem possible. It was In the hospital,
where rested the gallant Hooker, that I learned
the history of those mythical words so often
seen and so little understood, "S. T. 18G0
X." Anything alleviating tbe sufferings and
saving the lives of our soldiers, is a national
blessing. I witnessed some astonishing reaulta
lrom tbis article.
It is well koown tbe (fleet of burnt gunpow
der and cx:liement Is thirst, which added to the
loss ol blood In 1 be wounded, creates tho ne
cessity of a revlviog stimulant. Ia this par
ticular hospital, the phjeloians were allowing
tbeir pa leutj to drink Plantation Bitters, other
wise called S. T. 1860 X, and although the
wounded are most numerous here this di
vision having opened the fight at 5 in tbe morn
ing the men were mostly composed, and there
was very little fainting. Tbe article aots upon
the stomach acd nerves in a most incomprehen
sible manner, superior to brandy, and without
subsequent stupefying reaction. It originated
In tbe West Indies, composed of tbe celebrated
Calissya Birk, Roots, Herbs, etc.; all preserv
ed In St Croix Rom tbe S. T. 18G0-X be
ing a eeoret iogre.'lent, not yet revealed to tbe
public. It is principally recommended for want
of appetite, disordered liver, intermittent fe
vers, stomachic difficulties, eto. I understand it
was somewhat known la the Southern Stat
previous to the war, and It appears ao agent of
Jifferson Davis reoently applied to tbe proprie'
tors (or the privilege to mike it for hospital
purposes duriog tbe war, to which they made
tbe following reply :
NEW YORK, Jan. 16th, 1862
Mr. ,
Agent of, ite t
Dear Sir lu reply to your communication
ottering us r lit thousand dollars lor there
oipe aud right to make the Plantation Bitters
for your hospital purposes duricg the war," we
oeg to say, your price is a liberal ooe, oooeia
ering it would cost us nothing to comply, and
tnai o Demise we can derive no revenue lrom
the Southern States; but, sir, our duties to our
Government and our ideas of consistency
would not allow us to entertain it, although It
mlgbt please us to assuage the Bufferings of
your misguiaea touowers. -j.
We remain,
Very respectfully, vours,
P. H. DRAKE & CO.
These gentlemen give tbe history of certain
ingredients of tbeir article for over two bund
red years ebowlng that through all changes
of the medloal profession and Its practitioner
strength, composure and cheerfulness have been
derived from these sources. Dr. Woods in th
Washington Hospitals informed me that one
ostient was fast sinking and craij, and bad not
slept an hour for two weeks, until the Planta
tion Bitters came t his knowledge, wben one
day's trial gave him a night's rest, and be was
now fast recovering. I am surprised oar Gov.
ernment has not equaled Jefferson Davis In en
ergy, and adopted this Invaluable article In all
our hospitals. The weak soldiers cliog to it
like a brother. As a lay member, I can bear
witness it la "good to take," and affords more
energy and life than anything I ever tried
Success to the Plantation Bitten.
Bat I have digressed. In my next I shall
speak of gathering la the wounded, burying the
dead, eto.
