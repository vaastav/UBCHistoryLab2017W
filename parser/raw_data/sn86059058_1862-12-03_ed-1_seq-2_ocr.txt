A Retrospect.
Duriup'tltc nOTith of December find
January lust, froom and despondency
were feU I'lrougtiout the loyal States.
Everything appeared to be at a " dead
lock." The rebels held possession of
Manassas, Norfolk, Bowling Green,
Forts Henry and Donelson, and Colum
bus. The Union troojw were hardly
holding their own in Missouri, while our
grand armies in front of tbe rebels at
Manassas and Howling Green, were
paralyzed by an inactivity that was
equally perplexing and discouraging.
The mystery connected with this inac
tivity was more annoying than the slug"
gishness of those in whose keeping were
the destinies of the Republic. It was in
the West these dark clouds first began
to break away. Commodore Foote's
cannon at Fort Henry so disturbed the
stagnant atmosphere that the clouds
raised, parted, and at Fort Donelson
the sun of liberty came ont with resplen
dent beauty. Joy filled every patriotic
heart. The backbone of the rebellion
was considered broken. Victory follow
ed victory in quick succession. Bowling
Green, Nashville, Columbus, Islaud No.
10, Pea llidge, Shiloh, and New Orleans,
were rapidly and triumphantly won by
the gallant volunteers from the North
west, and people began to talk cheer
fully of the close of the war. This an
ticipation was strengthened by the suc
cesses on the Atlantic coast
But then came the reaction. Beaure
gard slipped through Halleck's fingers at
Corinth. The attack on V'icksburg was
a failure. The Mississippi remained
closed. McClellan's efforts, backed by
the most desperate fighting and cheerful
sacrifices by his army, amouuted to no
thing. Richmond bid us defiance. Again
the rebels assnmed the offensive, and in
Virginia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and
Kentucky they steadily pressed back the
Federal legions, nntil the feet of rebels
pressed free soil. Once again the bloody
repulses of Antietam, I'erryville, and
Corinth turn the tide against the rebels,
and our columns start in pursuit. But
another paralysis has come over the
Army ef the Potomac, and it lies at
Fredericksburg confronted by a power
ful and vigilant enemy. It now seems
to ns that we must turn our eyes from
ths -Potomac if we expect to see anything
done within the next two months. It is
more -than ever evident that the North
west is to tight the battles and save the
Government; and we rejoice to see that
her columns are again in motion. We
expect to hear soon of results accom
plished. Her hardy sons, when properly
led, take no steps backward.
We learn that an important move
ment has taken place from Helena.
The rivers in that vicinity are rising
rapidly, and Gen. Hovey never hesitates
to strike when the time comes to admin
ister the blow. Gen. Grant is also " mov
ing on the enemy's works," with seven
days' rations, while Gen. Sherman, with
a large force, has gone down the Missis
sippi. The rebels at Grenada, Miss., are
becoming alarmed, and the Memphis
Appeal has already began its prepara
tions for a second move. Vicksburg and
Jackson will soon be ours. Tennessee
will be liberated, and the Cotton States
will be'made to feel the terrors of war
and drink the cup of rebellion and revo
lution to its very dres.
Gen. Bragg, it is reported, is making
haste to strengthen the hard pressed ar
mies of Price and Van Dorn, now under
the command of Gen. Joe Johnson. He
is alredy at Aberdeen, Mississippi, and we
may expect another battle in that State
that well exceed the bloody struggle at
Shiloh, Tennessee.
For some days past, disappointment
and dissatisfaction has been written on
the faces of our people. But we confi
dently look for joy and hope soon to
light up their countenances, as they read
of other triumphs achieved by their no
ble boys in the Mississippi Valley. If
thewar does "drag its slow length along,"
we are confident rebellion will receive
fearful aud stunning blows iu the South
west This would be poetical justice,
for tbe base attempts of the rebels to
alienate the affections of the people of
the North-west from the Government
which baa done so much for them. It
will be a fitting return for the insult to
our people in proposing to buy their loy
alty with a promise of the free naviga
tion of the Mississippi. The navigation
of the father of waters will le free for
succeeding generations; what a noble
legacy to bequeath our children that
the strong right arms of their fathers
made it so.
The Capitola, Ida May and Mar
mora, all passed up, on their return from

U- The 5f ashville tTnion says the I
greatest consternation prevails among
the rebel slarftoidrra of Middle f'ennes
fcee, as the trine " draweth fcigk " when
the Pfctwrcnt's proclamation is to be
enforced. However 'that remarkable
document may be regarded by the But
ternuts in tbe Fret States, the Southern
butternuts think ,t other than brutum
fulmen. Titey look upon it as the most
terrible wound yet inflicted upon the pe
culiar institution which, while it is the
crvr,sr-kge, hitherto been the main sup
port oTthe Butternut Confederacy.
The Union asserts as an evidence of
this fact that in the counties of Wilson,
Williamson, Mauray, Rutherford and
Davidson counties, in Middle Tennessee,
rebel masters, for two or three weeks
past, have been diligently gathering np
their slaves and running them South as
expeditiously as possibly. The same
course has been pursued by the rebels in
Virginia, a large portion of which Stale
has been entirely cleansed of the black
element. Would that it could as easily
be purged of traitors!
With the Union, we cannot see what
particular benefit rebel masters are to
derive from this wholesale shipment
South of their chattle property. They
must have hopes of resisting the onward
march of the Union army, or else with a
I Mieawber's faith they have sent them
; South with the expectation that some
: thing will turn up. In this they will not
be disappointed, but it is a something
which sends a shudder even through the
heart of loyalty. "What that" something"
may be is thus energetically stated in
the Union:
We have our doubts whether these fu
gitive masters will find the change for
thehetter. It looks to us like leaping
out. of the fijhja pan into the fire. What
will they do with their slaves when they
get them South? There is no work for
them to do, no cotton or tobacco to raise,
and nothing for them to eat, It does not
seem to us that to collect hundreds of
thousands of restless, excited negroes
together, is exactly the best method of
securing and strengthening the divine
institution of slavery, which is sanction
ed by the Lord's Prayer, and the Sermon
on the Mount. To use a plain term,
these rebel slave-holders are a set of
asses; they never were troubled with
much brains, and they have improved
very much, of late, the wrong wav.
it we wanted to stir up miscniet, m
sulordination and the devil generally, in
the Cotton States, we would advise these
slave owners of Middle Tennessee, to do
just as they arc doiir4. Just let tliem
pile up their negroes, four deep, over
Mississippi and Alabama, until those
States look like the deck of a slaver, and
leyond all doubt we shall speedily wit
ness an irresistible conflict, compared
with which all other conflicts will apncr.r
JMM and spiritless. Who would have
believed, twelve months ago, that during
n bloody civil war, the rebel slave own
ers, who have always dreaded insurrec
tions among their slaves, even when
they were separated from each other on
isolated plantations, would at the most
dangerous period of the war, mans the
slaves in one formidable body, and thus
render them immeasurably more power
ful to inflict injury f This is precisely
what the rebels are doing. But we have
heard nobody object to their doing so. If
they can stand it, we guess that we can
endure it, not only patiently but com
fortably. In fact, ve confess that we
rather like the movement, The rebels
are kindly putting their heads so close
together that we can soon sever them at
one blow, as if they had had but one
neck. Nor does it require the gift of
prophecy to foretell what will follow in
this State.
Brutal Murder. By a note from Col.
Green, Mail Agent on the Grey Eagle,
we learn that a foul murder was commit
ted on Saturday last in Daviess county,
Kentucky, about five miles from Owens
boro. Mr. Willis Fields, who has always
been regarded as one of the most upright
men in the county, was found dead two
! miles from his house with several stabs
in his body, indicating that they had been
- inflicted with a large knife.
Various suspicions have been aroused
I as to the perpetrator or perpetrators of
' this murder, but as yet nothing has oc
curred to satisfactorily fix their identity.
Mr. Fields is said to have been a ster
ling Union man, respecteJ and beloved
by all his neighbors. This, however,
only makes the murder the more myste
rious, Col. Green, thinks, but we do not
think so. Nothing can more naturally
account for the cowardly taking off of any
citizen in Kentucky than the fact that he
was a sound Union man.
We are ii hope the authors of the
murder will be ferreted cut and brought
to speedy and condign punishment.
Not Mustered Out. Our readers will
remember what an important figure
" Thompson's Battery " cut in the battle
of Shiloh; how gallantly it was served
and what fearful huvock it made among
the rebels.
Capt. Thompson, who so ably com
manded the battery on that occasion, ar
rived in the city last night, en route for
Holly Springs, he having, as we are in
formed, been promoted to the rank of
Lieut. Col. of artillery, and been assigned
to duty with Gen. Grant, as Chief of Ar
tillery. The report that the Captain had been
mustered ont of the service for absence
without leave, was of course erroneous.
He hasheeu sick for several months, but
is now in excellent health and spirits.
For Memfuis. The splendid passen
ger and freight packet Forest Queen has
her shingle out to-day for Memphis. It
looks superfluous to say much in praise
0 so celebrated a packet as the Queen.
C:irit Conway is in command, and will
141 immediately on the arrival of the
train.
"Railroad Accident. A bad smash
up occurred on the Terre Haute and
Richmond Railroad tn Monday, between
the stations of Cortersburg and Plain
field. A bridge over a creek a few miles
east'of Cartersburg gave way and pre
cipitated fifteen cars into the creek. Two
men were killed. How many were in
jured we did not ascertain; nor the
amount of damage done to the cars and
their contents.
It is not often an accident of this kind
occurs on that model road ; so seldom
that one is induced to suspicion " foul
play " when they do happen.
We did intend publishing the ab
stract of the President's Message as it
came to us last evening in the Indian
apolis and Cincinnati papers, but on
glancing over it, we are convinced it is
a very unsatisfactory summary, and
therefore prefer waiting until we can lay
the Message in full before our readers,
which will be in a day or two at farthest
Personal. Yesterday we had the
pleasure of grasping the hand of Gen.
Veatch, who was on his way home to en
joy, with his family, a few days' fur
lough. The General bas been quite si 2k
and looked considerably the worse for
vear; but we are in hope that a short
time spent amid the comforts of home
will fully restore him to his health, use
fulness, and brigade. The army has
sufficiently few valuable oibcers that it
can spare so good a one as Gen. Veatch
any great length of time.
For Rent A very desirable residence
on Locust Street, between Sixth aud Sev
enth streets. The house is well furnished,
and supplied with every convenience.
Will be rented with or without tbe furni
ture. Apply at the residence of Thos.
E. Garvin, on First Street. 2td
Charles Wimar, a distinguished West
ern Artist, died at St. Louis on Sunday
night, the 30th ult, of consumption. The
deceased, who had already gained a
high reputation as a landscape painter,
was only 30 years of age.
While the weather was cold and
cloudy iu the forenoon, it cleared up by
12 o'clock, the sun came out warm and
bright, and finished up tbe day in a blaze
of genuine spring sunshine.
The 25th Regiment Indiana Vol
unteers is now located at Davis' Mill, six
miles from Lagrange, Tenn.
The Belle Creole, a very substan
tial packet, is advertised to leave for
Memphis to-day. The polite and popu
lar Harry McDougal, officiates in the of

It was announced a few davs ago
that an order had been issued by the mil
itary authorities for the arrest of John
B. Norman, Esq.. the able editor of tbe
New Albany Ledger, for the charge of
publishing information calculated to give
aid to the enemy. Hearing the rumor,
he at once reported himself to General
Wright for orders. Now, we are pleased
to learn that Mr. Norman has returned
home and resumed his editorial duties;
from which we infer that he has been
deemed not guilty of the charge but we
trust that Gen. Wright admonished him
not to do so any more. Louisville Jour

RIVER AND WEATHER.
Tbe weather yesterday was. cold and
cloudy. There were some indications of
snow.
The river has risen several feet since
Saturday, and at last we have the grati
fication of announcing that the bar just
above the city, which has been an eye
sore to boatmen for so many mouths,
has " gone under." We fear, however,
it won't stay under any great length of
time especially if the weather gets
much colder.
There was a large fleet of boats at the
landing during the dav, receiving and
discharging freight. When we went to
the levee in the morning we found the
Henry Clay laying at the wharf boat
She was on her way up tbe river.
The Mattie Cook had arrived from the
Wabash sometime in the night, with a
''staving load" of corn, which deck
hands were busily removing to the shore.
The Mary Miller, with a huge barge in
tow,jwas also at the landing loaded with
cotton. She was receiving freight for
points above.
The Hazel Dell, a popular little craft,
was diligently stowing away goods for
points below. She left at her usual hour
with a fair trip.
The new steam ferryboat, or rather
the old boat in a new trade, bas been
doing a lively business, and is such a
convenience, that we do not see how we
did so long without it.
ADDITIONAL RIVER SEWS.
The river at this point has risen abont
four feot since Saturday and is rising
slowly, with about eight feet hence to
Cairo.
Latest accounts from Louisville and
. Cincinnati report the river falling with
' light raius at the latter place.
The Grey Eagle will be here again to-
day, and will leave at 2 o'clock for Louia
, ville. Her accommodations are the
i most elegant and her officers the most
I polite and attentive. Travelers should
remember her hour.
Tee Westmorland went down on Sun
day and the Sunny-I5ide up.
The Clara roe at French Island,
bursted a steam pipe, and sent to this
city for repairs. Soon after leaving
French Island she struck a snag, caus
ing her to leak badly.
Tbe Mattie Cook came out of the Wa
', bash on Monday night, with a load of
' corn for this place. She left yesterday
j for Green river.
The Moderator, Ida May, Capitola and
Marmora passed up yesterday.
The McCombs arrived from Louisville
at half-past ten last night, and returned
during the night.
On Monday, the Leonora, Argonaut
No. 2, and Aurora passed down, and the
Jewess went up.
The Lady Pike, Diamond, Tycoon
Lancaster No. 4, and the J. W. Cheese
man also went down, and tbe Lancaster,
White Rose, and Araericus up.
One Monday night the Commercial,
Lady Franklin, Fannie McBurnie, Star
light, Key West, Hetty Gilraore, Mary
Miller, and Henry Clay passed up, and
Clara Poe down.
The Citizen, Capt. Donnelly, will leave
here at four o'clock this evening for

Patent Pipe.
PATENTED Jan. 21st, 1862.
Reqnirea only a trial to prove Its incomparable
superiority to any other pip now in use. It may
be? sinoke without axt dki.f.tekioi'8 or I'lsriEAS
ast irrccTs, as the oil of tobacco is not draw n into
the mouth and the tongue does not heccxu furred
or coated from inhaling its poisonous properties.
The bow l is made of the fine! Devonshire Clay, snd
gives to the toliacco a peculiarly pleasant fra
grance. The tobacco caknot fr, .-i m .i-t. as in
ordinary pit- -, because the drip beneath receives
the saliva that insensibly escApes into the stem ;
hence the pip never be omes offenslv ry rank, and
the breathofthe smok rdoes not proclaim to every
one he meets that he has been "indulging in a
Pipe.."
W heii the bowl becomes clogged, or the drip le
neath requires cleansing, the pipe may be taken
apart by removing the rim. The clay howl may at
any time be restored to its original whiteness by
burning in the fire, i first drying it thoroughly,) or
a new bow 1 may be pri-ured of I he dealer.
