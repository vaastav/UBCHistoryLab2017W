Harrison, Indicates very elonrly to each
Mockman present that tho "1 will" spirit
of the second city In tho American union
fully appreciates what tho live stock men
of this country have done for Chicago.
When wo consider that for the lust two

Tho varied Interests of these stockmen
of America uro very powerful and thoy

STRONG'S VITAL ADMISSION

W'nn I'n tn I,
ADRIAN, Mich.. Dec. 3. It Is expected
that thn coroner'H Jury which has been In
vestigating the disastrous wreck on tho
Wabash nenr Seneca last Wednesday night.
In which so many Italian Immigrants wero
crushed and burned to death, will render
verdict tomorrow.
The testimony this afternoon brought out
the fact that there were three different
Interpretations among the crew of east
bound train No. I of thn orders under which
tho train was running. Conductor Mnrtln
and Brakcman Dlttmann, who understood
(ho orders correctly, expected to pass train
No. 13 at Seneca and train No. 3 at Sand
Creek. Engineer Strong, whose misunder
standing wus directly responsible for tho
wreck, understood that ho was to pass
trains No. 3 and No. 13. both ut Sand Creek.
Fireman Dasticn testified that he believed
they wero to pass No. 13 ot Sand Creek
nnd No. 3 at Seneca Just the reverse of tho
way tho orders rend.
In reply"'tO a point; blank" fiuesttoa. fro'm
the prosecutor, Engineer Strong admitted
that It wan his misunderstanding of the or
ders that caused the wreck.
Engineer A. T. Strong nnd Conductor
George J. Martin of 'Wahaith train No.
I, testified also. Conductor Martin testified
that his orders, whch ho read to Engineer
Strong, Instructed him to puss train No. 13
at Scnccn.
Ab soon as he discovered that the train
had passed Seneca ho nttemptcd to pull
the emergency brake cord. Tho brakcman.
howover, had already dono this. Conductor
Mnrtln's testimony brought out the fact
that In thn coaches with double windows
signals from the engine whistle could not
be heard by the conductor and brakcman.
Engineer Strong testified that ho read
his order handed him by Conductor Martin to
meet trains Nos. 13 and 3 both at Sand Creek
Instead of one nt each place as the order
was written. lie accounted for the error
by the fact that the wind was blowing when
tho order was handed him and that while
he was reading it ono corner of the papor
was blown over, hiding the word Seneca.
Engineer Strong admitted that Conductor
Martin read this order to him, but said
that ho must have misunderstood It then.
As soon as ho discovered train No. 13 on
the same track and coming toward him ho
shut off his engine and applied tho emer
gency brake.

GR0SVEN0R PRESENTS HIS RESOLUTION

ory of I. nle President 'McKluley,
Follorrlnsr Ohio Represent
ative' Motion.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. Not In many
years havo the members of tha houss ll
tened with such rapt attention to tho annual
message of a president of the United States
as they did today to the reading of the first
message of President Roosevelt. Kvery
word was followed Intently from tbo an
nouncement of the tragic death of President
McKlnley In tho first sentence to the ex
pression nf hope that our relations with tho
world would continue.
The reading occupied two hours, but not
a member left his seat until tho close.
Several times there was applause and at the
close there was an enthusiastic demonstra
tion on tho republican side.
As the hands of tho clock reached 15
Speaker Henderson called the houce to or
der. On motion of Mr. Payne, the floor
leader of the majority, it was agreed that
when the house adjourn today It bo to meet
on Friday,
Tho speaker announced the appointment
of the committee on rules as follows: Mr.
Henderson of Iowa, Mr. Pit ho! I of Pennsyl
vania, Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, Mr. Richard
son of Tennessee and Mr. Underwood ot Ala
bama,
The only chango In the comraltteo wat
the substitution of Mr. Underwood for Mr.
Halley of Texas. Mr. ningham reported.
that tho committee, accompanied by the
committee from the senate, had rorforuui
Ita duty and tho president would at onet
communicate with tho two houses. Mujot
Pruden announced n message from tho
president. It was taken to tho spraker's
dcak, where Speaker Henderson broke tho
seal nnd banded the document to the read
ing clerk.
There was a slight murmur ot aoolause
when, In concluding tho recommendation of
legislation to put down anarchy, the clerk
read, "No matter calls more urgently for
the wisest thought nf congress."
To Put Down Auarclo'.
The murmurs when this sentence was
read were, fallowed by, a burst of ajiplauir.
when the cicfrk read: ''The, America 'pro
pie are aloVt to wraths but when their
wrath la onoj kindled It burns llko a con
suming flame." Probably no other portion
of tho messago attracted so much ntteu
tlon as that relating tn trusts. The rend
ing ot this portion of tbu message evoked
no demonstration, hut tbo rcromeudatlon
of a Chinese exclusion law drow great ap
plause. Tho reading of the message was con
cluded In tho house nt 2:33. Mr. Grosvenor
thon offered the following resolution, which
was, adopted without division:
"Resolved, That a committee of ono mem
ber from each stnto ropreacntcd In this
houso bo appointed on the part of the house
to Join such committee as may be appointed
on the part ot the senato to couKldur and
report by what token of respect and affec
tion It may bo proper for tho congress of
the United States to express tho deep sensi
bility of the untlon to tho traglo death ol
tho late President Wllllarq McKlntey anr"
that ao much of the message of Iho presi
dent thati relates to that deplorable urnt
be referred to audi committee."

tion tho speaker appointed a committee
