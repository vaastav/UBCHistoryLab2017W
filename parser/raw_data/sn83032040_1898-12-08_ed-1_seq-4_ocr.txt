Hon. 11. \V. Williams, well
known in this section of the State,
and now one of the Judges of the
Supreme Court of this State, has
always been a sensible citizen as
well as an able judge. I icing asked
as to his views of the resignation
of Judge Gordon from the Common
Pleas bench of Philadelphia, said:
"I am of the opinion that lie will
be John Wanamaker's candidate
for the United States Senate to suc
ceed M. S. Quay. This appears to
be the only explanation of his un
looked for resignation.''
WASHINGTON LETTER.
'From our Regular CnrrcxpoiuU'nt.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. sth, 1898.
President MeKinley's annual
message to Congress is a thoroughly
patriotic document from start to
finish. There is not a word of
partisanship in it. The message
will not only be read with interest,
but it will be carefully preserved,
as it is an authentic, condensed
history of the events leading to the
war with Spain, of the war, and of
the results of the war, so far as
they are known at this time. It is
in itself alone sufficient to place
President McKinley in the very
front ranks of American statesmen,
if he had not already attained that
position. It is necessarily long,
but contains no platitudes, no
striving after effect or bids for
popular favor. It is a plain state
ment of some of the most importa nt
events in the country's history,
made by a man whose patriotism
lias been proven by trials such as
few men have gone through. It
ought to be read in every school
house in the land and studied as a
lesson in current American history,
written by a maker of that history.
Even the most partisan Democrats
find nothing in it to object to,
which is something decidedly un
usual in Presidents' messages.
'I lie attendance at the opening
of Congress was quite up to the
average, both on the Iloor of the
House and Senate and in the gal
leries. Speaker Reed opened the
House, his smiling face indicating
a contentment that must have been
envied by those Democrats who
have for months past, been engaged
in overthrowing him, on paper.
Vice President Hobart presided
over the opening of the Senate in
his usual urbane and dignified
manner. Among the notable Sen
atorial absentees were Senators
Davis, of Minn.; Frye, of Me., and
Gray, of Delaware, who are de
tained in Paris by their work as
American Peace Commissioners,
but who expect to complete the
treaty of peace and start for home
in a very few days, the difficult
part having been accomplished
when the Spanish Commissioners
agreed to our terms, a week ago.
No man is better authority on
things Congressional than Senator
Allison, Chairman of theCommitt.ee
on Appropriations. His opinions
carry weight because of his long
experience and the correctness of
his judgment in the past. He
said of the session of Congress that
opened to-day: "In my opinion
the session will be an interesting
one. and many of the debates will
be of great importance.'' Of the
prospect of legislation lie said : "It
can be laid down as a safe rule
that if any measure proposed is
antagonized b\ a determined min
ority, it will be withdrawn. There
will be great pressure in behalf of
legislation for the Niearauga canal,
and if any importont measure is
passed; outside of the appropria
tion bills, it will be the Canal bill.
That subject has been so thoroughly
threshed over that it ought not to
provoke much debate." Of the
treaty of peace with Spain he said:
"It will be ratified beyond a doubt,
and exactly as it comes to us from
the Peace Commission. We can
not afford to stultify ourselves
in the face of the world by
refusing to accept the work of
the Commissioners. They have
been very careful and deserve the
endorsement of the country. I
shall be in favor of prompt action
because we ought to dispose of the
matter and not let it remain in a
state of uncertainty. We want to
settle as soon as possible our rela
tions to the Philippines, and this
we cannot do until the treaty is
ratified."
Secretary Alger's annual report
is a very interesting document,
embracing, as it does, a brief, but
comprehensive sketch of the con
duct of the Mar, with copies of all
official orders relating to the army,
etc. A careful study of it will re
move the last vestige of foundation
for most of the stories attacking
the management of the War De
partment. For instance, the of
ficial figures of the wounded in the
Santiago campaign are a complete
refutation of tlie stories that the
wounded were not properly cared
for. There were 140 surgeons with
Gen. Shafter's army. The total
number of wounded was 1,431, of
whom only 13 died of their wounds,
a percentage as remarkable in the
history of war as some of the more
talked about achievements of the
war.
Chairman Hepburn, of the House
Committee and Foreign Commerce,
anticipating early action on the
Nicaraugua Canal Bill, has an
nounced that the Committee will
grant hearings either for or against
the Niearauga Canal. The agents
of the Panama Canal Company,
now in Washington, are prepared,
it is believed, to spend a lot of
money to defeat or prevent Niea
rauga Canal legislation, but the
friends of the Canal are also in
Washington in force, including a
delegation from the Chamber of
Commerce of San Francisco, and
they w ill work as they have never
worked before, because they believe
success is in sight.
Senator Thurston, of Nebraska,
is one of the most pronounced ex
pansionists in Congress. lie said,
speaking of the various objects of
our taking the Philippines: "I am
satisfied to trust their future to
the good sense of the American
people. If they become a burden
rather than a blessing, the same
patriotic spirit which demanded
their surrender by Spain would set
them up in independence or other
wise dispose of tliem, without sac
rificing the liberties of other peo
ples and without doing discredit
to the American name."
Bucklen's Arnica Salve.
The best Salve in the world for cuts,
bruises, sores, ulcers, salt rheum, fever
sores, tetter, chapped hands, chilblains,
corns, and all skin eruptions, and posi
tively cures piles, or no pay required.
It is guaranteed to give perfect satis
faction or money refunded. Price 25
cents a box. For sale by L. Taggart.

Premier Sagasta should be careful.

Two Pointed Questions Answered.
What is the use of making a better
article than your competitor if you
can not get a better price for it?
Ans. —As there is no difference in the
price, so that while our profits may be
smaller on a single sale they will be
much greater in the aggregate.
How can you get the public to know
yonr make is the best?
If both are brought prominently be
fore the public both are certain to be
tried and the public will very quickly
pass judgment on them and use only
the better one.
This explains the large sale on Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy. The people
have been using it for years and have
found that it can always be depended
upon. They may occasionally take up
with some fashionable novelty put
forth with exaggerated claims, but are
certain to return to the one remedy
that tliey know to be reliable, and for
coughs, colds and croup there is noth
ing equal to Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy. For sale by L. Taggart.

Pains in the chest when a person has
a cold indicate a tendency toward
pneumonia. A piece of flannel damp
ened with Chamberlain's Pain Balm
and bound onto the chest over the seat
of pain will promptly leave the seat of
pain and prevent the threatened attack
of pneumonia. This same treatment
will cure a lame back in a few hours.

For six years our daughter was sorely
afflicted with throat affection caused by
Diphtheria. Two years ago we used a
bottle of Armstrong's Diphtheria and
Quinsy Drops, which not only gave
immediate relief but was a positive
cure. Her tonsils were soon back to
their natural size, the first in six years.

Millions Given Away.
It is certainly gratifying to the public
to know of one concern in the land
who are not afraid to be generous to
the needy and suffering. The proprie
tors of Dr. King's New Discovery for
Consumption, Coughs and Colds, have
given away over ten million trial
bottles of this great medicine; and
have the satisfaction of knowing that
it has absolutely cured thousands of
hopeless cases. Asthma, bronchitis,
hoarseness and all diseases of the throat,
chest and lungs are surely cured by
it. Call on L. Taggart, druggist, and
get a trial bottle free. Regular size
50c. and sl. Every bottle guaranteed,
or price refunded.
The rescuers who started out to res
cue Andree have been rescued.
A Clever Trick.
It certainly looks like it, but there is
really no trick about it. Anybody can
try it who has lame back and weak
kidneys, malaria or nervous troubles.
We mean he can cure himself right
away by taking Electric Bitters. This
medicine tones up the whole system,
acts as a stimulant to liver and kid
neys, is a blood purifier and nerve
tonic It cures constipation, headache,
fainting spells, sleeplessness and mel
ancholy. It is purely vegetable, a
mild laxative, and restores the system
to its natural vigor Try Electric
Bitters and be convinced that they are
a miracle worker. Every bottle guar
anteed. Only 50c. a bottle at L. Tag
gart's drug store.
