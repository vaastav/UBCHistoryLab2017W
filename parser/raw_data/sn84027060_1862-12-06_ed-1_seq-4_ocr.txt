Mnraroior COMHM.—The lut JBession of
tbe present Congress will convene at the Capital
to-day. It will probably be one of the moat im

under our Constitution. Everybody will be acx
iOtti to see the President's Message, and to hear
what new measures, if any, he deems requisita for
tbosuccessful prosecution. of the war, and the
maintenance and future peaoe and security of
the Unfen. Of these we hate seen BO reliable
indications. Whatever hf Jaa J' stiggest will
doubtless be well considered^ nd, be worthy o
the candid and cautious judgment of Congress
«nd the people. Never, in 'the history of any
co&itiy, were such tremendous issues demand

judgment so necessary to the present and the fa.

"Patioi JOHK."—It is said that John Tan
Buren'a notorious Cooper Institute speech is
having a great run throughout the land of Dixie.
Nearly all the rebel papers copy it from the
Riofamond Dispatch, with words of commenda
tion, and their editors very apparently regard
him as one of themselves.

CORN IS FOIL.—The editor of the Nebraska
Advertiser, published at Brownville, (N. T.)
diseosees the comparative cheapness of com ss
an article of fuel He says that corn is worth
ten cents, and coal twenty cents, per bushel,
and wood two dollara per cord. At theae prioes
lie concludes that ths choice is altogether de
pendent upon which ia obtainable with the
least trouble—in other words, that twenty bush*
els of corn are of the same value (or fuel as a
00rd of wood ready to put into the atove.—
Wood bears a higher comparative price here at
present. It would be singular if we should get
to burning corn aa a cheaper substitute.

that, on Monday night of last week, the dwelling
of Mr. Joel Rambo, an old citisen, residing
about eight milea south of Ottumwa, waa enter
ed by three miscreants, who seized the old man
by the throat, choking him nearly to death,
threw him dowo, threatened to kill him if he
moved, and then robbed the bouse of $66 in
money and such clothing and other articles aa
they could carry away. Mr. Rambo recognized
two of the party, one of whom is known to be
bushwhacker and rebel from Missouri. The
whole three were subsequently arrested and are
now securely lodged in jail.

QfThe Chicago Journal thinks that Con
gress should at oqgs take off all taxes on news
papers, and also abolish the tariff on bleaching
powders which enter so lsrgely into the manu
facture of paper. It thinks a tax on school
houses would be aboat as legitimate as a tax on
newspapers. It then goes on to say that Con
gressmen are only known to the people through
the Press, which records alike their election and
death, fcc. We think that the publishers of
papers should bear an equitable proportion of
the public burdens. If the preaent law is inequi
table, and saddles an undue burden on publish
sis, so far aa it is in excess, it certainly ought
to be modified. But we
do not see hew the high
price of paper is cauaed by the tax.' That is
caused, aa we understand it by the scarcity of
cotton both here and in Europe. Let us be rea
4 aonable and fair, and not ascribe to the tax what
results from facta over which Congress has no
control.'

Knows IT ALL !—The Chicago Times, in a la
bored editorial, alleges that the rebels hare be
tween two hundred and fifty and three hundred
thousand troops concentrated in Virginia! The
Times is so positive about this, that we are
bound to believe it haa had a special communi
cation from its Southern friends in relation to
the matter. However, we have no idea that its
information is correct. They undoubtedly have
a large army. But that number could be divided
by two, and then probably the estimate would
be large. We expect Gen. Burnside knows, ap
proximately at least, how large a foroe can be
concentrated againat him. When he makes a
move, we fp$l confident tya( it will be with such
knowledge, as will justify him in doing so, and
with as muck certainty of success aa can be ex
pect
edof the actiona of so ponderous an-ariny aa
his. We have no idea that the huge falsehoods
of the Times will materially modify his purposes
and actions.
yy The Chicago times don't like the propo
sition for the Union men of Louisiana to elect
Members of Congress! Probably it is fearful
that the Union men of that region will not elect
Representatives who will be willing to act with
such fellows as Fernando and Ben. Wood, or be
footballs for such reprobates aa "Prlnoe John,"
and hia fellow schemers for the country's ruin*
Southern Union men are likely to be earnest
men, if tbey are not pretenders to the cbaraeter.
8uch men will not auit the Times, for the iden.
tical reasons that make them acceptable to pa
triots.
Such papera as the Dubuque Herald find
time to abuse Gen. McNiel, for shooting ten
bushwhackers for murder and other atrocities
they bad committed. They are unable to find
epitheta sufficiently outrageous to spply to him.
It is a singular fact, however, that not one of
them haa a single word of rebuke to utter
against the order fulminated by Jeff. Davis, to
hang Union officers for no other offence than
that of holding their commissions, and doing
their duty under them! This omission can
scarcely be accidental. What reason eatt be as
signed for it other than the assumption that tbey
think the monater right, and, in their hearts, en
dorse bis proposed butchery The editors of
these foul journals Mill prate of their patriotism!
What an astonishing method they have of man
ifesting it!
w The aecesh press still continue their
efforts to excite opposition to every measure
adopted to put down the rebels. They do not
seem to understand that the greater the trials
imposed upon loyal people by the rebellion, which
waa fostered and encouraged by such men aa
they, the more earneat and resolved do the peo
ple become in their determination to orash it
utterly out of existence now and forever. Their
clamors produce an effect exactly the opposite
to their wishes. The more they cant, the more
radical they make the people. We don't know
that we dislike the results very much. It is get
ting pretty evident that strong measures are
neoeaaary to save the Union, and the oonspira
tors are aiding the work against their desires.
w From a letter of the 20th uit, written at
Grand Junction, Miss., by a member of the 2d
Iowa Cavalry to a friend in this place, we learn
that the 2d Cavalry, about the first of last month,
left Corinth and were in camp near the Junction
at the time of writing. The boys think they are
juat getting into the Sunny South, as the por
tion they are now in "ia about all they have
seen that is fit for a white man to live in," and
that the changes in the Eastern command be
tokens good, which might be extended to their
Department by bringing a more active man in
command of the West Tennessee district The
new levies are arriving and the troops are in
good spirits and anxioua for action.

GUT. SBZRMAH'S MOVKMIKT. The Chicago
Journal of the 1st, has a dispatch to the effect
that Gen. Sherman with the forces with which
he left Memphis, had reachedpoint below
Cold Water, on the Railroad leading South

respondent also professed to have important,but
contraband, information concerning the expedi

with this flittering remark:

of the: present and the character of the doner.
The fleg is regulation size with silk stripes
and orange fringe. On ths center are written the
words "Fort Donelson" in quotation marks, and
immediately beneath, "Iowa Second Infantry."
After dress parade, Col. Weaver formed the
regiment into a square with the colors in the
center, and having taken bis steed beside them,
he read the Governor's letter of presentation,
and then made aubstantially the following re
marks in reply: I
He alluded to the flag which they had b&rae
so victoriously at Fort Donelson, ted which was
now preserved by their friends among the .ar
chives of the State Hiatorical Society as a me
morial of their bravery and patriotism.' They
were glad to yield to their friends such a. tfebti
moniai of their faithfulness $o the cause of their
country, -..or :-j a
He thetf alluded to the trials through which
they had passed.
When the regiment left Keokuk it numbered
over one tbousafid' men,M)d1iaf received about
two hundred recruits since. Many had fallen
by disease and npon the battle field, and many
more
had been discharged on account of their
wounds and had gone home to halt their way
through life, and the regiment now numbers,
preaent, on detached service, wounded and sick
in the hospital, only about six hundred. But
the remaining few, after having passed the or
deal of war for eighteen months, still stand rea
dy to do their duty and defend the flag of their
country.
We had every reason for encouragement
I see, said he, a star on that flag representing
Tennessee, which is as completely under the
power of the United States as She waa before
she seceded. I see a star for Mississippi, the
8tate which we now occupy, and in which re
bellion was crushed at the battle of Corinth. I
aee stars for Missouri, Arkansas and Texas.
The whole country west of the Mississippi river
is virtually under the authority of our arms.—
Gen. Burnside is'moving on Richmond—General
Granger is moving on Georgia. Expeditions
were being fitted out against Charleston and
Mobile, and in six months there would not be a
vestige of rebellion left.
Here the Colonel stopped, for a moment and
looked up at the flag.
Said he, God bless the old flag and gathering
it in hia arms, he said, with choked utterance,
I love it, with my life I will defend it. Will you
stand by me my brave boya
We will," reaponded the regiment with one
universal shout
The Colonel having closed his remarks, Capt.
Davis, in his own peculiar atyle, in a style that
makes every word mean something, proposed
three cheers for the National Flag. Three rounds
of hearty cheers were given. Immediately soifte
one shouted three cheers for Col. Weaver, and
again the woods, and all the ^lills and valleys
around, echoed with three such rounds of cheers
as come only from the heart They did not
sound careless as though they were given merely
for the sake of fashion, nor did they grate against
the throat aa though they had been forced out
by outaide pressure, but tbey came out with a
full round note, just as they always will come,
when pushed out by the warm impulses of the
heart Three cheers were then proposed for Gov.
Kirkwood, and again they made the very canopy
ring.
After the usual maDoeuvering.the Colonel gave
the order to break ranks, and all went to their
quarters, pleased. The regiment is again very
ably commanded. Col. Weaver, a man of tried
military ability, has the respect, confidence and
affection of his regiment. Capt. Cowlea, a man
of courage and extensive military experience,
has been appointed Lieutenant Colonel, and
Capt Howard, a young man of marked ability,
in civil life, and a native-born military genius,
has been appointed Major—and you may expeot
to hear from them. They will, no doubt, equal
the noble deeda of their illustrious predecessors.

They have followed bravely and victoriously
the faded, ragged colors of a company through
the slaughter at Shiloh and the fierce conflict

Fortresa Monroe to pay off the troops connected
with the Expedition, now at that point, and it

C. DURHAM, ESQ—-Dear Sir: I postponed
writing to you until I could srrfve at the extent
of the Indian Upriaing in the Territory The
excitement that prevailed among the settlers for
a week or two, was almost indisoribable. Con
sternation seemed to be contagious. From one
settlement to another the cry wss heralded,
'•Prepare to save yourselves by flight 1" from
Fort Randall to Sioux City. Farms everywhere
on either hand show the effects ef a frightened
populace gone pell mell, atampeded, skedaddled.
This waa not withon£a cause. The Indians have
been showing a spirit of insubordination ever
since the latter part of June last, when the Gov
ernment paid them their annual bounty. This,
however, was attended to by dispatching some
of the boys of the Fort to the Agercy, a dis
tance of about 15 miles below the Fort After
the excitement was over—after the dust had set'*
tied, and the inhabitants oameto ask themselves
what had been done, it was ascertained that
there had been some of the whites murdered at
Sioux FailB, some cattle and horses stolen at oth*
er places. Thus ended the second imaginary
Indian War.
Once more things begin to assume an ominous
aspect. Little Crow's band have passed through
by Sioux Falls, or source of the James River, up
toward Fort Pierre. Major Pattee haa, according
ly, fitted up an expedition against the Indians
in that vicinity. We are just now in the receipt
of the intelligence that 6 or 8 of the white chil
dren taken by the redskins referred to, have been
burned the women taken arejretained as slaves.
There are some doubts as to the result of the
expedition. Should the winter set in while on
route, it may be the boys will be glad to get
back without congealed noses and ears. It is
the opinion of your correspondent that Major
Pattee will treat for the captives before com
mencing hostilities. Then, should they refuse to
give them up, they may look out for their nap
pers. There will not be much fighting done this
winter but the citizens seem to think we had as
well prepa:e for the worst next Spring.
The force quartered in this Territory is thought
quite insufficient to keep at bay so formidable a
foe.
The election went off with some ruffianism.—
Fraud was practiced to a considerabls extent.—
Several Districts were thrown oat on account of
fraud. The certificate of eiectioo was finally
awarded to Jayne, the present Territorial Gov
ernor. Subsequent returns from some of the
upper country place Todd considerably ahead.
There is, however, no political change, as Todd

personification oif meeting of the
TrnaabiUl
meeting of the officers of the Third Reg
iment of Iowa Infantry held in camp at La
Grange, Tennessee, on thelevening of the 21st of
November, 1862, convened upon the arrival of
the news that Lieut Col. Trumbull had resigned
aod was about to leave us.
After expressions of sorrow and regret by
every officer present, and avowals of tbe warm
eat friendship for the Colonel as a man of their
respect for him as an officer, and of their appre
ciation of his bravery on the battle field, a com
mittee was appointed to draft resolutions ex
pressive of the feelings of the Regiment towards
him. Said Committee conaisted of Major B. F.
Reables, Surgeon, Captains S. B. MoCall and
James Tullv, and Lieut, G. W. Crosley, who re
ported the following Reeolutions, which were
unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That while in command of this
Regiment CoL M. M. Trnmbull has given uni
versal satisfaction to the officers and men under
him.
Resolved, That by the resignation of Colonel
Trumbull our Regiment has lost a popular and
efficient officer, his brother officers a sociable
and generous companion, and the Government
one of its coolest and bravest soldiers.
Resolved, That we deeply regret the circum
stance that has forced him to resign, and our
sincere wishes for the speedy recovery of his
health acoompany him in his retirement
Resolved, That Col. Trumbull by his eoolnecs
and bravery at the battles of Blue Mills, Shiloh
and the Hatchie, has made a record that is
equalled by few, and surpassed by none, and
should lsst while coolness is approved snd bra
very commended.
Resolved, That these Resolutions express the
sentiment of the Entire Regiment, both officers
and men, to the best of our knowledge.
The Colonel responded impromptu, in sub
stance about as follows:
Major KeabUi and Gentlemen,—I am over
powered by the generous expressions of confi
dence, friendship and sympathy oontained in
the resolutions just read to me. It is impossi
ble for me adequately to express my emotions
of regret at the circumstances which compel me

you for these kindly expressions, but I am still
more thankful for tin ready obedienoe and the
warm personal regard yon have given me durine

fortune, that whilst I have always insisted on

STATE SBCKBTS BROUGHT

TO
The SewarC-Beynaenr Plot
from Wilkes' Spirit or the Tisnes, Nov. 89.
The honest, earnest, loyal-mindtd North,
which drew so deep a breath of ease when Mc
Ciellan was removed, should not release its ap
prehensions ia too long a furlough. Dangers of
graver significance and deeper root remain be
hind and till they be corrected, the country
will continue to plunge on, as purposeless as a
dismasted ship, with an unseen leak ainking her
to the bottom. Generals cannot save tbe na
tion if ite counsellors are false. A stubborn
people might replace armies which imbecility
had surrendered to the enemy, but no amount
of heart can restore tbe capitulations of e false
diplomacy for onoe we concede to treason even
so much as the opening for a hair, the fracture
widens, and our unity is split forever.
We mean by this language to declare our fixed
belief that we are even now upon the brink of
ruio, and that the permanent division of this
vast Republic is inevitable, wdeea WWieon H.
Seward b« quickly taken from the helm of the Gov
ernment And wis, on our part, ia no vague and
idle fear nor is it entertained solely by our
selves. Thousands of thinking men, who have
watched with wonder Mr. 8eward's course sinoe
he exchanged tearful adiens with the traitors of
the Senate, share this opinion with us and fore
see as we do, that unless some fresh hand take
possession of the wheel, and put it bard down
against our previous course, the Union will be
soon npon the rocks.
It is Mr. Seward who is the author of the tame
and wavering policy which has for the laat two
years characterized our treatment of the South.
It waa Mr. Seward who, with a blindness which
denies all presumption of bis Statesmanship, re
fused to recognize tbe possibility of a rebellion.
It was he who, on this false calculation, steered
tbe shameful surrenders of Buchanan he who
received the spotted traitors of the revolted
States when an insulted sovereignty should have
consigned them to a scaffold snd it was he, too,
who held the handaof the President while Letch
er k Co. fooled uaof Norfolk and Harper's Ferry,
and thus bore off Virginia to the arms of the
Confederates. Even tnen, this famous states
man did not seem to realize that war was in tbe
wind, and by way of makiog snre of peace, con
ceived the bright notion of letting the cotton
Statea retire, on tbe profound idea that the bor
der string would stay nay, that the recusanta
would soon blushingly return, and humbly en
treat to be left out no longer "in the cold." He
had in his prescient eye a little plan of a conven
tion for this purpose, after the pattern of that
which Seymour & Co. fought for in the late
election while, as a windward anchor, in case
this hope should fail, he calculated to appease
the country by an aggregation oq, the ride of
Canada, as an offset tor the amputation en the
Gulf. Vide bis orationa in the political cam
paign of '69, and hia crapulous statement to tbe
Duke of Newcastle, during the visit of the Prince
of Wsles.
In keeping with Mr. Seward's misleading assu
ranees to the North, that there would be no war—
none, at any rate, which he could not settle in
sixty days—was the unauthorized promises which
this model statesman made to the Southern
Commissioners, that Sumter should not be rein
forced and especially in keeping with this ex
traordinary pledge, was tbe more than dubious
act of authorizing Harvey to give information to
the traitors of the President's secret expedition
for that purpoae. The word which waa thus
given from the State Department, was tbe signal
for that infamous bombardment and Harvey,
who sent it, was rewarded by his patron with the
embassy to Portugal.
Finding himself now drifted into deeper wat
er, Mr. Seward attempted to navigate the coun
try on a semNdemi, half-and-half, war and con
ciliation principle. Instead of branding the
outbreak purely an insurrection, by closing the
Southern harbors as ports of entry to the com
merce of the world, he formally recognized'tbe
rebels as belligerents, in proclaiming a blockade,
and then, by way of aveiting the similar recog*
nition of tbe European powers, he endeavored
to propitiate France and England by a relin
quishment of privateering, without stipulating
even for the protection of private property at
sea. This action of state»man»hip was the fruit
ful source of half our future tronbles. It gran
ted the first aspiration of the South, by recog
nizing it as a public power, against which we
were leving war, nor exercising jurisdiction, and
thus invited in its favor that sympathy which
usually extends to revolution. It is entirely in
keeping with bis wholesale and uncompensated
abandonment of privateering, and fully worthy
of tbe subsequent declaration to our Minister at
London, that the President recognized the pos«
sibility of separation, ard admitted the cardinal
dogma of the South—"that the Federal Govern
ment could not reduce the seceding States to
obedience by conquest"
These extraordinary declarations were made
to Mr. Adams in a letter dated 10th of April,
1861, and given to the press by Mr. 8eward a«
late as December last They make a revelation
at which the country well may tremble for,
while thus formally encouraging tbe South to
persevere in arms, and justifying England for
her Southern predilections, he permitted tbe
President to keep demanding soldiers by the
hundred thousand, apparently to effect what he
had announced, in the President's own name, as
impossible to be done. But these troops gave
not the slightest tronble to our little Premier.
Their cost to the country contributed to help
his plan of wearying the people with expense
while, so long as he could retain McClellan and
Buell, the troops could not be used to aggravate
the issue beyond negotiation point We may
now perceive why Mr. Seward has constantly
been the secret influence which retained these
incompetent commanders in the field and why,
on the other hand, be has been the persistent
enemy of Grant, Hooker, Hunter, Wallace, Fre
mont, Mitchell, and Rosseau, and every other
soldier who has evinced an inclination for active
movements in the field.
The selection for St James, of Mr, Adams,
wbo has gravely admitted upon paper, that "this
war is a mere question of boundaries," is of a
piece with all the rest of Mr. Seward's policy.
That gentleman is as fully in accord with all
our Premier's private plans and politics as is his
shadow, Thurlow Weed, or his friends 8eymour
and Prince John. Were this not so, Mr. Sew
ard would not have ventured to lay down to
him in the famous letter of the 10th April, the
doctrine that States rights are co-equal with the
national authority, nor have authorized him to
say to England, we recognized the fact that the
8outh had the power to successfully resist—that
is to say, to successfully resist the force of
Federal arms, but not to withstand the ultimate
persuasions of Mr. 8eward's masterly diploma
cy. Mr. Adams, therefore, so far as Mr. Seward
is concerned, is as "sound" as his minister to
Portugal and he may safely be relied upon not
to object to our cruisers being ordered out of
British ports when pirates want a clearance,
and not to protest against the building of Con
federate naviee in the Clyde, till Mr. Seward Im
parts to him the one, that the North is suffi
ciently humbled and dispirited to be in due
Christian temper for negotiation. In tbe esti­
mation of Hobbes, the old philosopher war i
the natural condition of mankind: aceordi«..
the philosophy of Mr. SewArd, it is emir®!?
exceptional one, and only to be tolerated a.
prologue to diplomacy. And of this we
have mere proofs than one.
8orae time laat winter, a delegation of ftut
citizens visited Washington to org® the ei»u,
7
ment of our 8tate canals, in order that Fsdifi*
ships of war might pass from the ocean tT ,u
Lakes, and from thence be slipped afar th.
bels down tbe Mississippi. When tbe 'cbah*!^
called on Mr. 8ewatd to urge tbe matter
was brusquely told he "had better disband hit
delegation and go home.7' On his sakinr •»,
the Premier replied: "Because what yoe
pose is directly in face of tbe policy of thaV^T
eminent!" "What," said tbe chairman °H„'
you mean to say, that when we hold all th.
trump cards we are not to eae them on the e«

please," said Mr. Seward, pacing petBlantl*
and down die floor, "but the govornmeiS
not propose to undertake any permanent wsrk.
in connection with this rebellion."
In a conversation with Lord Lyons searcAi.
three weeks ago, Mr. Seward, while discussing
with his lordship the condition of American af
fairs, remarked in substance—"I have now set
tbe country juat where I desise it The oeo
pie always get tired of prolonged hostilities
The North is already nearly so, while the South
is utterly sick and disgusted with tbe war. Thus
you see, my lord, the people on both sides an
anxious for hostilities to end, and I am sure to
be able to clooe the war by spring." To tbia
complacent theory, his lordship quietly remark
ed—"Yes, Mr. Sewsrd, you may think you have
tbe country where you want it, but are you sure
tbe country will be content to remain lone
enough in that position for your purposes?" To
another party Mr. Seward said, even ainos this
conversation with Lord Lyons, "I have now the
nation where I want it There are no more
troopa to be had by either side, and ths war
must be fought out with thoss already ia. »ha
field. There 1s a growing aversion to a contin
uation of the contest so with the combined
moral foree of the dissatisfied party at the North
and tbe disaffected portion of the South, I can
bring the country together, and the whole thin*
will be properly arranged.
Mr. Ruggles may now understand what Mr.
Seward meant whan he snabbed him about tbe
enlargement of canala and Mr. Liocoln may be*
gin to divine Whose programme it was that Sey
mour, Fernando, and Prince John recently car
ried out in the election in New York. In this
connection we may note the fact that this city,
in which is located the enormous Republican'
patronage of the Custom House, Ssrveyemhip
Post Office, Metropolitan Police, Navy Yard',
Navy Agency, U. S. Marshal and District At
torneyships, there wss a majority sgainst tbe
Administration of 81,000 out of 76,000 votes
and it is a matter of notoriety, that nearly all of
Mr. Seward'a adherentt at theae "cribs" voted
againat Mr. Wads worth. Whether ths Presi
dent has awakened to the plot which this reveals
whether he sees Mr. Seward marching over his
remains into the Presidential chair, placing hia
I good friend Thurlow in the Treasury, handing
Prince John the diplomatic bonne bouehe of
St. James, and, first and foremoat, helping
Ferdando this winter into the United States
Senate by a few tractable 8eward votes,
we do not know but we can tell him
that tbe scheme hss dawned upon ths
minds of many observers here, and also warn
him, that apostates from bis favors are already
begining to trim their sails for the trade wind
of the next four years. Though a keen-minded
and aubatantial man, Mr. Lincoln haa been ut
terly duped by bis chief Secretary but if be will
rouse himself, and get his thinking machinery to
work without asking help from snybody for u
hour, he cannot fail to see the fatal poaition in
which he has been enmeshed. He will then per
oeive why bis wily minister so persistently sup
ported generals who always shunned battle aod
never would pursue and turning his eyes into
his own domestic camp, will find, to hia aston
ishment, that every member of bia government
haa recognized the fact of the impending disso
lution of bia incoherent party, and ia sagaciously
arranging a new platform for himaelf. We do
not say this in reproach of tbeae gentlemen, for
it ia the natural reault of Mr. Lincoln consigning
himself utterly, on the subject of the war, to tlx
artful manipulations of the premier and Blair.
In politics, as we^,AS morals, the instinct of eel!
preservation is still the first law of nature, ani
while Mr. Lincoln is going down, they cannot
expected to reject such planks as the wreck sendi
floating by.
These, doubtless, are new views to Mr. Lincoln
but they are true views, nevertheless and tbt
sooner he ponders on them with an earnest mind,
the better. The general opinion of loyal men it
that all the country needs at present is a victory,
and that the capture of Richmond will be tbt
deathblow to the hopea of the rebellion. Doubt
leas Mr. Lincoln fully shares these views witb all
the earnest patriotism of bis heart, and to us,
likewiae, these achievements are desirable but
on the heels of victory, aud especially in the fall
of Richmond, do we detect our greatest perila
We bear in mind that Mr. Seward set eat with
the plan of letting the Cotten States retire *e
bave read bis doctrine of State rights, as laid
down to Mr. Adams, and we know that bis geo
eral panacea for thia tremendous crisis is s new
National Convention. In all theae things Sey
mour & Co., and he agree and Prince John,wbo
most boldly put thia submission programme be
fore the people, ia now in Waahington (or vuof
late) probably with the purpose of consulting
Mr. Seward. We aball not be surprised there
fore, at any hour, since we have aeen ths fc
cility witb which treasonous emissaries ire
convoyed by Cabinet pasaea through our
lines, to have the full fledged plan of a ceasatiM
of hostilities and a national peace conveatix
burst upon us, by some committee of distin
guished citizens," hailing either from
Albaojot
Richmond. And this, too, just as Burnside ant
Hooker have earneatiy laid bare tbeir sworda-|
Mr. Seward is the very patron and Grand KM
ter of everything that ia oblique in civil stratfff
and we warn Mr. Lincoln, that unless from tbt!
hour forth be keep himself very wide awake,
insidious elbow friend may mislead him in
some erroneous act of policy, from which it
be impossible for him either to reoede
or
to
vanoe with safety.
Finally, we would aak him, after thusexamlt
ing his own position snd its fortunes, to W,
his invigorated vision to the contemplation
the country. A rapid backward glance, aid
by the lights we bave juat hung up, wui g'
him a topographs view of the Seward's eo«r»
and he will perceive the coils whioh hsTeboo*
this mighty grant torpid at the feet of treat*
Though it will amaze him much, he will ^,,
cover, that while the South through its a*«0|
engrafted on our armies and sprinkled tbr«F^|
our oouncila, have performed the game of ptf
ing the North till it became tired enough to
Mr. Seward, witb an equally deluded mind, h*
been anchoring his hopes of settlement ot11
equal disgust among the rebels.
And such, after eighteen months of drex*'
ing civil strife, is tbe appalling
might
interprets*
of our astounding dream. Two gigastis
tions, with nearly two millions of opposing*'
diers in the field, have been played H***
each other in regulated losses, that a subtle v
getiator, who has an abhorrenoe for nnilitf-'
triumpba, may reconcile tbe exhausted
without the advent of aa overahadowing
tation. Gratefully, then, may "oor ernj
brethren of tbe South" recognise tbe BOW
philosophy of the distinguished $tateem» y
had the preacieaee to foresee and magnaus*
to admit, even at the outset, that tbey ee»
not be conquered to obedienoe by tbe fed£
arms. 8uch a statesman and patriot as
well hope that an admiriog aod en*"
siastio people might readily agree upon bis'
he first President of the restored Goufc"*
Ion.
