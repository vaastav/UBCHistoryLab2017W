NOT ENCOURAGING-
The first annual report of General
Chaffee was not an especially en
couraging document. He praises
the military government of Manila
and expresses the belief that a ma
jority ot the inhabitants of the island
desire peace but he has not been
able to give the assurance that even
where they want fighting to cease
that they care to accept our domina
tion. All efforts to secure a general
surrender in southern Luzon have
failed, several hundreds of rebels
still being in arms there. President
I Roosevelt in his message expressed
the view that " the insurrection has
, bocome an affair of local banditti
and marauders who deserve no
' higher reeard than the brigands of
' portions of the old world." but
General Chaffee does not confirm
j this in any way.
' Two of General Chaffee's recom-
mendatious are quite opposed to the
viewsXrf the government. He urges
that no further material reduction
of troops be made before January 1,
1903, and goes on record against
General Corbtn's plan of concen
trating the troops in large bodies
except in the vicinity of Manila.
General Chaffee also declares that
there is but one certain and relia
ble way of ascertaining the progress
ot the people in sell-government
by observation by the army. Pa

THE COLUMBIAN,
MUNICIPAL Aff AIK3-
A New Corporation to bo Known at tho
Citizen's Electric Light and Power Co.
Thursday night was the regular
monthly meeting of the Blooms
burg Town Council. The President
and all the members were present.
The first business taken up after
roll call was the matter of paving
the alley between the Court House
and Wirt building. In view of the
fact that the property owners have
expressed their willingness to bear
their part of the expense, it was
moved that the Town bear its share
of the expense. Carried.
Mayor Ikeler stated that com
plaint had been entered regarding
the dangerous condition of the
pavement in front ot the old Presby
terian church, due to the accumula
tion of snow and ice, and also in
relation to the pavements in front
of properties of C. W. Runyon and
C. A. Kleim on Main street. On
motion duly seconded the ordi
nance requiring the cleaning of
pavements is to be enforced. Car
ried; On motion duly seconded the
ordinance aforesaid is to be repeal
ed and another covering the essen
tial points contained in the former
with, such additions as may seem
proper is to be prepared by the So
licitor. On motion duly seconded the So
licitor and Secretary were instruct
ed to prepare said ordinance ready
lor printing and same to be etven
out by bids.
Solicitor Ikeler appeared and
stated that arrangements had been
made to settle the Walp damage
case for the sum of $500.00, and
also said that the otiginal viewers
appointed by the Court, Messrs.
Robbins, Kunkle and Fahringer,
had asked lor their pay. On mo
tion duly seconded the matter is to
be left to the discretion ot President
Ikeler, the Solicitor and the Fin
ance Committee.
The Solicitor further stated to
Council that suit had been entered
against the Town by the Land Im
provement Company for the rent of
Oak Grove Park on an old lease of
1890, but which had been renewed
three years later.
Solicitor Ikeler stated that Messrs.
C. C. Yetter, Alexander Schwarz
and W. R. Chapin ask that an ordi
nance be passed granting the right
to locate and construct ouildings,
erect poles and wires upon the
streets and highways, and to con
struct a railroad switch for the pur
pose ot supplying light, heat and
power by electricity within the
Town of Bloomsburg, the above
gentlemen being the representa
tives and promoters of a proposed
corporation to be known as the
Citizens' Electric Light and Pcwer
Company, of Bloomsburg.
Mr. Yetter appeared on behalf of
the company and stated that the
object of the proposed company was
to interest local capital as far as
possible, and that the balance
would be obtained from outside
sources. He stated lurther that the
company would apply lor a charter
immediately and that the work of
constructing the plant would be
begun at the earliest possible mo
ment. Solicitor Ikeler read the pro
posed ordinance. It was then taken
up and passed section by section
and finally approved as a whole.
Fire Chief Harman appeared and
read amendments as adopted by
Fire Board and asked Council to
adopt them.
The motion to adopt the amend
ments was lost.
On motion duly seconded there
are to be no changes in by-laws and

The most sympathetic and oblig
ing people in any community are
the dear lawyers, who plead so im
ploring and earnestly for the poor
(?) criminals and all others who
may get into trouble of various
kinds and who need their aid.
We were much amused to see the
Judge call the boys up last Tues
day a week ago before his honor
and examine them, after which,
giving them certificates to positions
in various institutions some in the
county jail, some, perhaps, in the
penitentiary, and still others in re
formatories in other parts of the
State. Those educated in the
schools of vice and crime get posi
tions as well as those educated of a
more honorable type, but the occu-
rations are of opposite character
istics. Herein is an object lesson
for our boys and girls to distinguish
and choose in which class of schools
they would rather be educated, and
under which they would rather
hold positions in the different insti
tution? of our country. The high
est graduates, or those taking great
est degrees in the criminal schools,
are furnished striped suits, while
those of the college graduates are
obliged to furnish their own suits
of their own choosing. This :s an
interesting question and profitable
lesson for our boys and girls to
study thoroughly. Honor crowns
the one class, while disgrace covers
the other.
Our acknowledgements are due

Last baturday we visited Altred
McHenry, of Cambra. for the pur
pose of copying the affidavits re
garding the old Salt Well, where
boring for oil will commence very
shortly. We wish to keep the peo
ple informed regarding the pro
gress of this enterprise, and also
wisu to show tae people what the
prospects are, as set forth in the
accompanying affidavits. The au
thors of these affidavits have been
dead many years, but they were
men of sterling integrity.
lhe following is a true copy of the
original affidavits in possession of the
Secretary of the Pine Creek Oil Co.
Luzerne County SS:
On this aoth day of Tune 1S65, be
fore me, the Subscriber, a Justice of
the Peace, personally appeared Peter
Boston, who being duly sworn says;
that he is a resident of Fairmount,
Luzerne County, Pennsylvania! that
he is 69 years of age, that he had the
job of boring the Salt Well near Cam
bra, said County, commencing about
the year A. D. 1826,-that he bored
said well and gave his personal atten
tion to it, that at the depth of 200 or
300 feet, while boring after night,
there commenced coming out of the
well a strong smell, something like
sulphur only a great deal stronger,
and on examination in the morning
the water that continually flowed out
of the well was of a blue black color,
and that the smell came from the
water, that for at least 20 feet on the
surface of the water in the creek be-
low, this water made quite a scum;
that he is now of the positive opinion
that that dark water of offensive smell
was coal oil, and he has so expressed
his opinion ever since he became
acquainted with coal oil, that he has
no interest in this matter, but if a
company is raised he is willing to take
a share in it.
Sworn and subscribed before me
this aoth day of June 1865.

Heaping u They Have 8owa,
The plight of Pittsburg in the
scrimmage between the "ripper"
factions of the Quay machine is not
one to excite pitying sympathy.
Her city government has beeri
made a foot ball for the teams with
her full knowledge and consent,
and her citizens have "rooted" for
one gang or the other as the game
progressed. When the Bigelows,
backed by Stone, Potter, Elkin and
the rest of the Quay team, broke
through the Flinn line and scored a
touchdown Pittsburg applauded the
play by giving to Stone's mnn,
Potter, a rousing majority. Now
that Stone has kicked the ball into
the middle of the field, and Flinn
has caught it, Pittsburg's yells of
"off-side" excite only derisive
laughter. The score is even, it is
Flinn's ball, and the teams are in a
confused scrimmage, a squirming,
biting, kicking and slugging mix
tip in the mire of squalid politics.
The decent people of Pittsburg
had their opportunity to register a
protest against this game when
Stone's man, Potter, caught in the
act of making the Supreme Court a
tool of political cracksmen, was
placed upon the State ticket as the
representative of ripperism. They
gave to Potter a majority which
could be construed only as an en
dorsement of all that he represent
ed, a ratification of the ripping up
of their municipal government and
a grant of full power to Governor
Stone to carry out any deals he had
made, involving control of their
affairs. The vote of Pittsburg
shows that there was no revolt of
decent Republicans against the ma
chine. Only the old-line Demo
crats made any fight against the
combined forces ot. the plundering
factions and their opposition was
more partisan than patriotic.
There are good citizens in Fitts
burg, plenty of them, no doubt, but
they failed to indicate at the late
election that they give serious
thought to the responsibilities of
citizenship or even have an in
telligent regard for their own in
terests. Pittsburg, least of all the cities of
the State, can pretend that there
was anything unexpected in the
playing of one local machine against
the other in Governor Stone's rip
ping game Sht had received just
what she bargained for, and if she
finds the price somewhat stagger
ing, she must remember that gov
ernment by the worst always comes
high. North American.
