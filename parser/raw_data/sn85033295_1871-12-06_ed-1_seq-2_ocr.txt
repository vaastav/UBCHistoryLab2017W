WEDNESDAY, DEC. 6. Ib7l.
CONGRESS.
tbe writer Bess.on of C ngr** op
ens ! tf noon oo Monday lan when the
President s Message was delivered.
Politically the presen’ Congress stand*
as follows; Senate, 56 Republican*
and 17 Democrats; Hou'*, 150 Re
poo.'.cans n; and 103 Democrats. Up to
the time of going to press only a for
tiori of the President’s Message had
been received. We give a sympsis of
opetrng part. The President congrat
ulates the people on the general pros
perity of *tba nation. In speaking of
tke di -asters by fir* and storm, the
President #*y<* they t.-wve served to cal
forth the best element* of human na
ture in our country, sau to envelope of
a friendship for s on the part ol for
eign nation* which goes far toward al
leviating the distress occasioned by the
calamities. The relations of the Un
ited States with the foreign powers con
tinue to be friendly. The year has
been an eventful one in witnessing two
great nations, epea ing one language,
settling by peaceful arbitration disputes
ef long standing, a,d liable at any
time to bring these nations into bloody
and hostile confi et.
The suggestions as to the necessity
of increasing and improving, the ma
terial of the navy meets with approval
in the message. The President speaks
©f the enlarged receipts of the Post
Office Department, as shown by the
Deport of the Postmaster General,
widen exhibits a gratifying increase in
that branch of the public service. It
is the index of the growth of education,
and of the prosperity of the people—
two elements highly conductive to the
stability and vigor of republics. This
is a brief outline of the document, as
far as received.. We shall polish the
entire message next week.
ANOTHER HOPE VANISHED.
Part of the “passive" programme
intended to be sprung on the country
next year by the Democracy, was the
nomination of Senator 'Trumbull of Il
linois, as the coaseivative candidate for
President against Grant, through which
means it was fondly hope! the re
gular dyed ia the wool Republicans
would be driven to the wall, and Grant
at their heal defeated. But allowing
Senator Trumbull to be the judge, he
he docs not intend to be made the
scapegoat of the Democracy, and what
is more, declared emphatically in con
rersation with prominent politicians a
few days since, that under no considera
tion would lie consent’to become the con
servative candidate far the Presidency.
He prefers bis seat in the Senate ; be
sides the people he thinks are not ready
for a change. The Senato: claim? that
Grant’s defeat would cause a re-action
in the South, making a worse condition
of affairs there than at present exists.
What the Pemocr. cy will do about
it,’’ so far as their action in the next
Presidential canvass is concerned, re
mains to be seen, and we elieve that
at present no one is capable ol judging
as to the course they intend to pursue.
That no conservative Republican will
consent to lead their forlorn hope in
the next campaign is quite certain, and
this being the case, the Democracy can
not adopt the “ passive" policy, al
though many of the leaders are now
strongly advocating it.
A Clean Sweep Promised.— A
special despatch to the Chicago Tri
bune of Dec. 2J, says; The Reform
Committee believe Mayor I all will be
compelled to resign within the next
fortnight; that Gould and Fhk will he
forced out of the Eric Railway, and
that a clear sweap will be made of all
iha lending official scoundrels in the
city. Gould and Fisk are said to be
greatly alarmid at preseat appearances,
and are getting ready to avoid t..e legi
mute consequence of years of dishon
esty and fraud. It is stated upon what
c’airns to be authority, that neither of
them now has a dollar’s worth of prop
erty in liis own name. It is generally
believed tonight that Tweed will run
away in a day or two. There is little
doubt if ho does not, that lie will be
sent to prison, and the Sheriff seems to
think Tweed will not be at liberty more
t an firty-ciglit hours longer. Rum
ors are circulating that he is djw pre
paring for flight.
Tax Certificates —Julge Stew
art, of the Ninth Judicial D strict,
decidi and that a tax certificate on which
aUn ted tales Revenue stamp of five
cents was placed, is illegal a*d void?
It has been the custom in nearly all of
tbe counties in this State to put on a
stamp of this amount, and in many to
put on no stamp. This question is to
go before tbe Supreme Court of the
Slate for a decision, and if tbe position
of Judge Stewart is sustained, most of
the tax deeds since 1802, obtained no
such certificites, must be worthless.
We understand that Judge Lyon, of
the First Judicial District, sustains the
decision made by J udge Stewart. This
matter is of great importance, and the
action of the Supreme Court will be
looked for with an unusual degree of in
terest.— La Crosse Republican,

FROM THE NATIONAL CAPITAL.
Washington Nov 291 h, 1871.
To the Editor of the Republican:
Speculations as to the probable course
to be pursued by the Democrat* and Anti
! Grant Republicans in the coming campaign,
continues to keep the upper hand here v hut
figns are already beginning to be seen that
the coalition if it ever take* place, will be
a! y’b iig but harmonious. The World, in
the first place strenuously advocating the
sum-nder ot tfie Iteinacratic party to the
diseat -ded Republicans, now sounds a note
t wvr;mi(, telling the lattar that only if
wtey appear iu respectable lumbers will
tbrlr sentiment* he allowed to prevail, and
if veiorv hen is achieved it will be due to
lha Democrat#, aiwi to them will, as matter
of tosr--, belong the spoils. I sapectthat
the is, the World and its friends, begin
to *e* that the esedus from the Republican
piety is not going to b quite as large a*
wae f. ret anticipated. All tfce rumors re
gardiug the proposed convention of Anti.
Grant wen, such as Greeley, Schurz, Sum
ner, is mere osmseitse and Las been denied,
over and over again What these men are
striving for, i'purifications and improve
ments mside the Republican party, but none
of them have auy idea of nskiug Democrats,
or the Demtutratic party, for support. They
will achieve what they are aiming at, or
most of it, in the Republican party with
Grant at its head, and though they may op
pose him in the Convention, they will sup
port him at the polls as heartily as they did
in 18<J9. The Republican opoos'tion to
Grant will then be a mere handful, led by
such men as Dana, of the New 1 ork Sun
and Don Piatt, of the Washington Capital ,
men whose only argument is the lowest and
diniest vituperation of the President and
every one connected with the adminisfra
| tion. When such men leave the Repubii
j can party, it will indeed be purified, and
j they w 1 he left to revel in the dirt where
j they belong. With rainy politicians Grant
j is eat what may be termed a strong man,
( but there is iifile doubt that he stands as
I high with the people as ever. Two of the
great points made at his inauguration, an
I honest collection of the revenue, and a cor
responding reduction of the debt, and the
settlement of the Alabama claims have been
successfully carried, and the third one, the
reform of the Civil service, is in a fair way
of completion. While unpopular appoint
ments may have been made, the service bag
not suffered by them, and it is hardly fair
*o condemn him for appointments concern
ing which be, as a matter of course, has to
depend entirely upon the statements of
others. His administration has been honest
and prosperous for the country, and this is
what concerns the people the most, they
have seen this and undoubtedly appreciate it
The question of the bolding of the next
National Republican convention, will he
determined during the begimog of the com
ing year. The time will be sometime dur
ing the summer, but regarding the place
there will be some strife. St Louis, Boston,
Philadelphia, Washington, and bow many
many more I know not, are candidates for
the honor, with fairest prospects for the
first named one. If she cannot have the
National Capital, let her, at least, have the
National Convention.
The womans rights movement, which
reajlj has gained some adherents,
even among our German fellow citizens, ha?
met with u sudden check, by the indecent
and disgusting lecture held hy Victoria
Woodhull, in New York, a few evenings
since Justly, or not, she is considered the
leader In the movement, ud when she
gives a nasty talk upon L r tree-love prin
ciples, it is time that all decent men an i wo
men stopped to see where such a movement
in vi ably will It a 1 to.
The great event of the past week, in New
York, has been the coming and going of
Alexis. It is really ridicnlons to see tbe
iuss made by our liberty loving Americans
over the poor boy; it looks as if some of
them really thought that a prince or a grand
duke, must be some kind of queer specimen
of humanity, and it. is sad to think that
while thousands of dollars are wasted in
unnatural and ridiculous display, many
poor human beings are suffering from want
off ;el and food, perhaps in the very next
street. lam glad to say that Wasnington
has less of that slioidy toadyism than New
York, and his coming here created but little
sir, and no display. He came here merely
to call on the President, and when this was
done, he left quietly again.
Before this reaches your readers, the wise
men of the Nation will h ve gathered in
council. Almost all of tie Senators and
Members are here, and Washington is fast
fi ling up. The first event looked forward
to with interest, is the appointment of Com
mittees of tha House, and when this is done
the work will begin in earnest. That you
may form some idea of the work before Con
gress, I will say that the number of bills
now on the calendar is 799. of which 359
belong to the Senate, and have already
been referred to appropriate committees.
Many of the Gills are without special inter
est, but some will give rise to considerable
discussion. w
FIRE AT BARABOO.
Editor Republican:
Baraboo, Wis., Dec. 4, 1871.
Yesterday about 12:30 P. M., a lire broke
out south of the Court House, iu a frame
building, and ere the flumes had finished
tim-ir feast, seven frame buildings were con
sumed. Lucky it was that it happened
during the day, for hundreds of dollars
worth of goods were save! that otherwise
wouldjhava been lost. The Sink Cos. Bank
had a very loud call, hiu by the continued
efforts of th people, it was saved, though
ofeourse sustaining considerable damage
Never before did I see such patriot wo
men. They did work at this fire that ought
to put to shame man}’ a strong, able-bodied
man that stood motionless with hands in
his pockets. Bushing to and fro through
the mud and snow, (a light snow had been
failing all day) they would carry boxes and
bundles that were much too heavy for their
tender muscles to sustain, while young
men with their clean “bib ana tuckers,” on,
would stand gaiing with an indifferent stare
the former truly deserve be name of hero
ines. Two men, while assisting in gelling a
counter from a building, were borne to the
ground by the falling of burningtimbers, but
the ready bands of surrounding bystanders
pulled them out before they sustained any
serious injury.
An explosion of gunpowder caused the
crowd to scatter, but no dauia e was do .e,
A pile of miscellaneous goods were burned
after being brought into the street
This is a hard blow for Baraboo ; for it
wipes out some of the large-t business houses
in the place. I have heard no estimate as to
the amount of property lost, but it will reach
at least $20,000 ” ' B. M. W.
RESIGNATION. OF MAYOR HALL
DEMANDED.
New York, November 29.—At a
meeting of the citizens’ Committee tf
Seventy last night, the following re- ;
solutions were adopted : I
Resolved. That tor the purpose of
securing to the people et this city the
yubslantisl fruits of their victory in
the recent election over corruption,
this committee propose to use every
lawful effort to secure at the earhest
possible moment the removal ot the
prsenl Mayor from the office he holds.
Recalling the fact that it was he who
sided in devising in fhe interests of
corruption the present iniquitous char
ter and plot for robbing the treasury ot
the city by the credit of false and fr ind
olent vouchers; that it was he wno
filled the various responsible "Sicas and
departments wi’h hicb who have now
been condemned by the verdict of the
people; th t it was fe who having the
sole power of appointing inspectors an i
poll clerks, filled these offices generally
with Tammany Democrats and Tamma
ny Republicans, meaning to rob the
honest citizen of their suffrages, and
when an honest man was duly appoint
ed Deputy Comptroller used his whole
power and influence to prevent him
from entering upon his duties of that
office; and that fie has endeavored at
every step to thwart and defeat the
efforts of the people to discover and
punish (hose who have been engaged
under bia auspices in plundering the
city treasury. W demand but im
mediate resignation.
Rjtolved, That if the Mayor shall
continue to defy the express will of the
people, and shall persist in retaining
liis official position, the Committee on
Legislation be instructed to prepare
and present to the Legislature, im
mediately on its ute* ting, an act which
shall be sufficient and effectual to re
ceive him at once, without waiting for
the completion of the new charter or
other remedial measure?.

in average families—cannot hat profit by its good
sense and good tai-ie. which, we- have no doubt,
are. today making very many homes happ’er
than they may have been before the women be
