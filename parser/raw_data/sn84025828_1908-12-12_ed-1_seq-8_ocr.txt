Cnrporiitlona.
As regards the great eorporntlon en
caged in interstate business, mid especial
ly the rallionds, I can only repeat what I
liae already ngaiu nnd again snid in my
messages lo the Congress, I delicto that
under the Inteistate ilause of tho Consti
tution the I'nlteil States has complete
nud paimnouut right to uintiol nil agen
cies of Intel stnlc (onimeue, nnd I believe
that tho national goierument nlono can
cxcmIsc this right with wisdom nnd cfTcc
thenecN so as both to seciiro justlco from,
mm to no justice lo, mo great corpora
tions which are me most important ac
tors In modern business, I lielleie that
It Is worse thin folly to attempt to pro
hibit all combinations ns Is dono by tho
Sheiman nntl-tiust law, because micIi n
law can bo enforced only Impeifectlv nnd
iineqiinlly. nnd Its enforcement works nl
most ns much hmdslilp iu good, I strong
ly ndiocntc that instuid of nn unwise
elTort to piohlblt nil combinations, there
fihnll 1m substituted n law which hIiiiII
ecpio-sly permit roinlilimtlons which me
In tho lutoi est of the public, but shall nt
the Mime tlmo ghe to some ngenev of the
national government full imwcr of control
nud supcivUlon over them, One of tho
chief fen lilies of this toutiol should bo
seeming ditlio publicity In nil matters
which the public tins a ruht to know, nnd
futtheimoie, tho power, not by judicial
but by executiie nctlon. to pioent or jiut
n itop to ei cry form of improper favorit
ism or other wiongdolng.
Tho rnlliwi of tho country should bo
put completely under tho Interstate com
merce commission nnd remoied from tho
domain of the nntl-tiust law. The power
of tho commission should bo mado thor
oughgoing, so that It coulil exeiclse com
nlelo Mipenlslon nnd contiol over the
Uhuo of secuiltles as well ns over tho mis

rate, at least, this power should bo num
mary. The power to Inwstigiito tho finnn

wajs has been one of tho moit vnlunblo
featuirs In ic(ciit legislation. Power to

tho lepiet-entntltcs of tho public should

It Is teiy emmittlv lo bo wished that
our people, thioilgh their lemc'M litntltcs,
hhoiild net In this mutter. It Is haul to
ay whether mot ilnmtgo to tho country
nt Inr.'e would como fiom outlio fnlluio
on the part of llm public lo supeivlso nnd
control the actions of tho gieat corpora

hary goteiiunental power in n way which
would do Injustice and wrong to tho cor

of nil opniesulnn which would deny lo nblo
mini of business tho Just lewmd of their
liiltlntlio and business sagacity, nro advo
cating policies that would bo fiaught with
tho giatPht haim to tho whole country.
To penult ctery lawless capitalist, oteiy
law'-doftlns coinointlon. lo tako any ac
tion, no matter how Inhpiitoui, In tho
cliort to bociiio nn improper pront mm
to build nn piltilese, would bo ruinous
to tho republic nnd would mark tho aban
donment of tho effott to securo in tho
Industrial world tho xplilt of democratic
fali-ilealliiff, On tho other hand, to at
tnck tlieso wiougs in Hint spirit of dem
agogy which enn wo wrong only when
committed h tho linn of wealth, and Is
dumb and blind In tho piosenco of wrong
committed against men of property or by
men of no property. Is exactly as evil as
corruptly to defend tho wrongdoing of
no of wealth. The war we wage must
be wnged ngiliwt misconduct, n gainst
wiongdolng w deleter It Is found: nnd we
must stand heartily for the ilghti of et
cry detent man, whether he be n nun of
cieat wealth or n man who earns his lite
llho.id us a wagewoiker or a tiller of Ihe
soil.
It Is woll lo keep in mind that exactly
as the nuurchUt Is ihe worst enemy of lib
erty and the le.K lloniiry the woiit enemy
of order, so the men who defend tho lights
of properlj Imte most to fear fiom the
wioiiRiloeis of grent wealth, nnd the men
who ure championing popular rights hate
most to fear fiom tho ileiuigogues who In
Ihe name of populnr rights would do
tttotig to mid oppress honet business
men, honest men of wealth: for the xiic
cess of either ,t.tpe of wrongdoer neccs
snrlly hit lies n tlolent reaction against
the cause the wrongdoer nominally up
holds. In point of danger to the nation
there Is nothing' to choose between on Ihe
one d.wd tde corruptinnist, the bribe
glter, tho bribe-Inker, the man who em
lilojs his gteitt tnlent lo dwindle Ills fel-lotv-cltlfens
on n lmge xcale, nud, on the
other hand, the pi eat her of class hatted,
the man who, whether from Ignorance or
from willingness to sieilllce his country
to his nmbltton, perxiiades well-mennlng
but wrong-headed men lo try to destroy
the Instruments upon which our prosper
ity inainlv rests. ,et each group of men
beware of nnd gtiatd ngilust Ihe shortcom
ings lo w tilth that group Is Itself most
llnble, n Too often we seo the business
community In n spirit of unhealthy class
consciousness deplore the effort lo hold to
nccount under the Inw the wealthy men
who In their management of grent corpo
rations, whether rnilrouK Rtreet rnllwnts,
or other llidustrlll enterprises, bnte de
buted In n wnv that revolts Ihe conscience
of the plain, decent people. Such nn nttl
tilde cannot be condemned too severely,
for men of property should recogulre Ihnt
they Jeopardize the rights of property
when they fall heartily to Join In the ef
fort to do nwny with the nliuses of wealth.
On tho other hand, those who ndtocato
proper control on Mm If of the public,
through the Stale, of these grent corpora
tions, nnd of Ihe wealth engaged on a
giant scale in business oHrattoiis, must
eter keep In mind that unless (hey do
scrupulous Justice to Hie corporation, un
less they permit ample profit, nnd cordial
ly encourage capable men of business xo

stilklug nt the root of our national well

for n moment delicto Hint the problem
will bo solted by nny short nnd easy
method. Tho solution will como nnlv Im
pressing various concurrent remedies,
which the federal government nlono can
enact mid which is absolutely tltnl In or

pose. Many laws nro needed.
I.nbur.
There nre ninny matters nlTcctlng lalior
nnd the status of the wagenorker lo which
I xlioulil like to draw jour attention, but
an cxliniixtlte illsriisnloii of the problem In
all Its lisped Is not lion nect'ssjut. This
iiilmlulsirntlon Is Hearing Its vnii; unit,
more titer, nniler our form of government
I lie notation of tho problem ilepenils upon
the action of the States, ns much ns upon
thn action of the nation. I believe In n
xtenilt- effort, or norhiins It woulil lie more
uciiiriilo to stay In slimlv efforts In mnny
different directions, lo bring about a condl.
tlon of txffalrs under which the men who
work with hand or with brain, the laboreis,
the superintendents, (do men who produce
for the market ami tho men who Hnd n
market for the in tides produced, shall own
n far gieiler share than at pivsvnt of tho
wealth Ihey produce, and ho enabled to
Invest It In the tools and Instiuments by
which nil Iho work Is can led cm. As far as
possible I hope to see a frank lecoznltlon
of tho advanlnges coufcricd bv machinery,
oiganlzallnu and dltlslon of labor, aicom
piulecl hy an effort to being about u larger
share In the owneishlp of wagewoiker of
iiillway, mill and failory. In farming, this
simply means Hint wo wish to see the farm
er own his own laud; we do not wish to see
thu fnims xo huge Hint the)' become the
property of absentee' landlords wlm farm
Ihem by tenants, nor jet so small Hint the
fanner becomes like a I In I ope mi peasant.
Again, tho dcposlioix In our swings banks
now number over one-linth of our enllie
population, 'these mu nil capitalists, who
thioiigd tho savings banks loan their
money to the workeis that Is, In man)
cases to themselves to earr) on their va
rious Industrie's. Tho mine wo Increase
llielr number, the mole we Introduce tde
principles of co opvmllou Into our Indus
Hy. lively Increase In tho number of small
stodiholdeis u corporations is a gooil thing,
for the same reasons ; and where the cm
i1o)ch aro the stockholders the result Is
piirttculmly good. Veiy much of this move
ment must bo outside of any tiling that can
be accomplished by legislation ; but legis
lation can do n good deal, l'ostal savings
hanks will inako It easy foi tho poorest to
keen their sat lugs In absolute safety. The
iigulutlon of tho national hlghwii)s must Is
sued Hint they shall nerve all tho people
with cepm! Justice. Corporate llnnnces
must Ihi supervised so as to inako It fur
safer than at present for Hie man of small
means to latest Ills money In stocks. Tdcro
must do piodlhltlon of child labor, diminu
tion of woman lubor, shoitenlng of bonis of
nil mechanical labor; stock watering should
ho piohlblted, and stock gambling xo far
as Is possible discouraged, llivro snnuiu
ho a piogresslte luhviltiince tux nn large
fortunes, Industrial education should lie
cniciiiiaged. As far as possible wo should
lighten tho burden of luxation on tho small
man. Wo should put n piemliim upon
thrift, hard work and business vuiigy; but
these cpmlltlcs cense to be the main fnc
tots In accumulating a fortune long before
that fortune leaehes n point wheie It would
bo seriously affected by any Inheiltauce tax
such as I pinpose, It Is eminently light
that tho nation should llx thu tonus upon
which tho great fortunes aro Inherited
'I hey rnrcly do any gemd and they often do
Ilium to tdosa who Inherit them In llielr
entirety.
I'roteclloii fur Wuue Workers,
'Ibcio should no longer bo any paltering
with tho iiiestlou of taking eato of tho
wagevvutkers who, under our pivsent na
tional sjslem, bccomci killed, crippled or
worn out as part of tho regular incidents
of n glten business, imu imijoinj oi wage-
vvoikers must unto ineir i ignis secuivii ior
them by State action : hut tho national
government should leglstato In tduioagh
going und far-leaching fashion not onl) for
all emplojes of tho national government,
hut for all pet sous engaged In Interstate
commerce. ...
Pending a thorough going Investigation
and action tlieie Is teituln legislation
which should bo enacted nt once. Tho law,
pissed nt the last session of the Cougiess,
granting compensation to ceilaln classes of
duplet ves of the government, should lie ex
tended to Include nil emplojes of the gov
ernment and should bo made more llbcial In
Its trims.
1 renew my rvcnmmcndatlon that tho
principle of tho eight-hour day should as
rapidly anil as far as piactlcablo bo ex
tended to tho entire work being carried on
by tho government; tho present Inw should
lsi amended to embrace contracts on those
public works willed tho present wording of
the act seems to exclude.
'1'lie Courts.
I most earnestly urge upon the Congress
the dutv of liicren.lug the totallv luaele-
riuate salaries now glvin to our Judges. On
tho whole there Is no body of public serv
ants who do as vnluablo work, nor whoso
moneyed reward Is so Inadcejuuto compared
to their work. Ileglnnlng with the Supreme
Court the Judges should have tbelr salaries
doubled, ft Is not Is-tlttlng the dignity ot
the nation that Its most honored public
sonants should be paid sums so small com
pared to what they would earn In private
life that the performance of public service
by them Implies an exceedingly heavy pe
cuniary sacrifice,
It Is earnestly to be desired that some
method should be devised for doing away
irh ih Inns delnts which now obtain In
I ilia administration of Justice, aud wblcd
operate with peculiar feverltv against per
sons of small means, ami favor only the
tery citiulnnls whom It Is most desirable
In punish
At the last election certain IcaeWs of
nrganlteil lalior iiimte a tlolent aud sweep
ing nttnek upon the enllie Jinllclarv of the
coitntit, an nltitck comheil In such terms
as to Include the most uniUht, honest and
la nail nil niled Judges, no less than those of
tin I nmcr iiiltid nnd more lesti tiled outlook.
It was the kind of nttiuk mlmlhiblj lilted
to prevent nn siiciesful attempt to reform
aliases of the Jiullihirr, hecausp It gate tho
champions of Ihe unjust Judge llielr eagerlv
il licd oppoi (unity to shift their ground
Into a clmmplonslilp of lost Judges who
were iinjiistlt iHnlled. Icist year, before
the House Cnmnilttpc on, the .Indklnry
these same lenders formuhited their etc
tiiiinds, speilfjlnx the bill that contained
Ihem, i ef nlng nil compiomlsn, stating they
wished the principle ot thai lilll or nothing.
'I her Insisted on a pi o vision that In n
labor dispute no Injunction should Issue
except to protect a pioperty right, and spc
clllinllv tuotlded that the right lo rmrv
on business should not he construed ns n
pioiiertv right: nnd In n second provision
their bill made legal In labor dispute
any net or ngieemetit bv or lutween two
or more persons that would not hnvo been
unlaw fill tr done lit a single person. In
other w oi ils, Hits bill Ipgalled blacklisting
and bojcottlng In rvoiy form, li'ffnllzlnic,
foi Instance, those forms of the secondary
boycott which Hit- anthracite coal xtrlko
commission so unreservedly condemned;
while the right lo tarry on n business was
explicitly taktn out fiom under Hint pro
tection which the law throws titer proper
ty. Tho demand wns made that tlieie
should be trial lit Jurj In contempt cases,
thereby most serlouslj Impilrlng the nil
thorlty of Ihe courts. All this repicsentc-d
a course of polity which, If tarried out,
woulil mean the enthronement of class prlv
I lego In Its, crudest nnd most brutal form,
nnd the destruction of one of the most
essential functions of the Judiciary In all
tlvlllred lands.
The violence of the crusade for this legis
lation, nnd Its tomplele failure, Illustrate
two truths which It Is essential our people
should learn. In the Mrst plate, they ought
lo teach the worklngman, the laborer, the
wagewoiker, that hv demanding whnt Is
Impioper nnd Impossible he plajs Into the
hands of Ills foes. Much a crude nnd vi
llous attack upon the coiuts, even If It were
ii'mporiiriiv xiiccessrui, would inevitably in
the end cause n tlolent reaction and would
band the great mass of clllrens togcthci,
forcing Idem lo stand by nil the Judges,
competent nnd Incompetent alike, lather
than lo see Ihe wheels of Justlte stopped
A movement of this kind ran ultimately re
sult In nothing tint dittiingc to those In
whose behalf It Is nominally undertaken.
The wiiKcworkcts, the worklngmcn, the
tillering men of the touiiliy by the way In
which the) repudiated Ihe effort to get
them lo cast their tides In response to an
nppeal to tlass hatred, have emphasized
their sound patriotism nnd Americanism,
the whole country has cause to ftel pride
In this attitude of sturdy Independence. In
this uncompromising Insistence niton acting
slmiilv as good clllrens, ns good Americans,
without icgard lo fancied and Improper
class Interestx. Much an attitude Is nn ob
ject lesxon In good citizenship to the en
tile nnllon.
Hut the extreme lenctlnnnrles, the per
sons who limn themselves to the wrongs
now and then committed by the courts on
tailoring men, should also think seriously
ns lo whnt such a movement ns this por
tends. 'Ihe Judges who hate shown them
seltes nhle nud willing effectltely lo check
thn dishonest nctlvltv of the very rltd man
who works Inlipiltv hy the mlsiminngement
of corporations, who lute shown them
selves nleit lo do Justice lo the wagewoik
er, and s.vinp.ithctlc with the needs of the
mass of on- pcop'e, xo Unit the dweller In
the li Helmut houses, the man who prac
tices n dangerous tinde, the man who Is
i rushed hy excessive hours of labor, feel
Hint their needs me understood by in,,
courts these Judges ale the real bulwark
of Ihe courts; these Judges, the Judges of
the stump of the I'reslelcnt-elett, who hate
ticcn feiuleis In opposing Inltor when It
has gone winng. hut fearless also In hold
ing lo xtrlct account corporations that work
lnbull.v. and far-sighted In reeving that
tho woiklngmnn gets his rights, arc the
men of nil others to whom we owe It Hint
the appeal for sued violent nnd mistaken
legislation has fallen on deaf ears. Hint Hie
ngltnlloli for Its passage proved to lie with
out substantial basis. The courts are
Jeoparded primarily by tho action of these
reelernl nnd State Judges who show In
iibllltj or unwillingness to put n stop lo
the wrongdoing of tery ilch men under
modern Indiistiinl conditions, nnd Inahllltt
or unwillingness to give relief to men of
sinn 1 1 means or wngvvtorkers who ore
unshed dovtu by these modern Industrial
conditions; who, In other ttoids, fail to
understand and apply the needed remedies
for the new wrongs produced by the new
and highly complex social nnd Industrial
Utilization which has grown up In the
Inst half century.
'Ihvie nre certain decisions by xnrlnus
courts w.lilch havo been exceedingly detri
mental to Hie rights of wugevtorkers, 'this
Is true of nil the derisions that decide that
men and women are, hy the constitution,
"guaranteed their HlM!rty" lo eon I nut to
enter a elangcinus occupation, or to work
an iiiideslinble or Improper number of
bonis, or to work In unhealthy surround
lngs,j and therefore cannot recover dam
ages when maimed In that occupation, and
cannot lie fm bidden to work what the lcg
Islatuio decides Is nn excessive uumls'r
of Iioiiis, or to cany on the woilf nuclei
conditions which tho leglslatuit elect les
to be tinhi'.ilthy. Decisions such ns these
alluded to above nullify the legislative
vffeut lo piotett the wngevvorkers who most
lived protection from those employers, who
take advantage of llielr grinding need.
Theio Is nlso, I think, ground for tho be
lief that substantial Injustice Is often stif
fen l by employes In totiseiiueiico of Ihe
custom of com Is Issuing Icinpoiary Injunc
tions without notice to them, and punish
ing them for contempt of court In Instances
where, ns u matter of fact, they date no
knowledge) of any proceedings. Outside of
organized labor tlieie Is a wlilespivud feel
ing that this sjstem ottcn woiks great In
justice to wagovvorkers when their efforts
to better their working conditions icsult In
Industrial disputes. A temporary Injunction
pioc-uieil ex pirte tuny as a matter nt fact
have nil tho effect of a permanent Injunc
tion In causing ellsaslvi to tho wugevtoik
ers' Hide In such u dispute. Organized labor
Is chilling under the unjust rcNlinlut which
tomes fiom repealed resoit to this plan of
prdcediue. lis discontent has liven unwise
ly expressed, and of Ion luipropeily ex
pressed, but tlieie Is u sound basis for It,
nnd tho orderly and law-abiding people of a
community would Iw In a far stronger posi
tion for upholding the courts If the un
doubtedly vxUtlug abuses tould bo piovlded
against.
Such proposnl as those mentioned above
as advocated by the extreme labor lenders,
contain the vital error of being class legis
lation of tho most offensive kind, and otcn
If enacted Into law I believe that tho luw
would lightly ls held unconstitutional.
Moieovei, thn labor people nro themselves
now beginning to Invoke the uwi of the
power of Injunction. During tho last ten
jvara, and within my own knowledge, at
least llfty Injunctions date been obtnlncd
by lalior unions In New York City nlono,
most ot them living to protect tho union
label (a "piopoit) light"), tint some living
obtained foi uthci icasons against cmplo
eis, Tho power of Injunction Is a gleut
cquunuiu remedy vtnicii siiouiu on no ac
count bo destiojed. Hut safc-gimieU should
bo erected against Its abuse. I believe that
nunc such piovlsions as those I advocated
a )ear ago for checking tho abuse of tho
issuance of temporary Injunctions should bo
adopted.

I'or many of the shortcomings ot Justice
In our couiitty our people as a whole are
themselves to blame, nnd Ihe Judges and
Jutles meicly bear Iheli share together tilth
the public ns, whole. It Is dlsciedltnhle tu
us ns a people that there should be dim

calities In the Inteipretntlon of laws by
Judges, tu sentimentality and class con

leila nnd sensationalism In Hie dally press.
I'or much of this falluie of Justice no tc
sponslblllty whatever lies on rich men ns
such. We who make up Hie mass of tho
people cannot shift the responsibility from
our own shoulders. Hut there Is nn Im
portant part of the failure which das spe

The chief bieiikdown Is In dealing with

Isdeel nt Inn, During tde lifetime of tde
older men now nllve tde sorlal relations
have changed far more rapidly than In tde
preceding two centuries. Tde Immense

associations, nnd the extreme strain and
piessure of modem life, data produced con

The courts hoi el n place of peculiar nnd
deserted sanctity iinclcr our form of gov

lo the permanence of our Institutions; nnd
lespect for the Inw Is largely conditioned
upon respect for the courts. It Is an of
fense against Hie republic to say nnytblng
willed tun weaken this respect, savo for
tho gravest reason nnd In the most care
fully cunided manner. Our Judges should
lie held In peculiar donor. On nn nvernge
tdey stand nliote nny other sertnnts of the

rent bed the highest letel held bv tdose few

fnct that there nre wise and unwise Judges,
Just as there me wise nnd unwise execu

shnit: the snme Is true with tlio legislator,
nlthough not to tde same degree, for do Is

easy to llx Ids personal responsibility nnd

no similar way of holding him to responsi

many localities In tho United States where
sufficient opportunity Is not given to tdo
people to deposit their savings. Tbe re
sult Is that money Is kept In biding and

brought Into circulation through tbe Instru

able to guarantee to tdo Islands order at

under It.
The Army,
As regards tho army, I can attention to
the fact that while our Junior officers and
enlisted men stand tery high, tho present
system of promotion dy seniority results In
bringing Into Hie higher grndes many men
of mediocre rapid!) who data but a short
tlmo to serve. No man should regard It as
his vestpd right to rise to the highest rank
In Hie Army any more than III nny other
profession. It Is n curious nnd by no
means creditable fact that there should bo
so often n failure on the part ot the public
nud its representative's lo understand tho
great need, fiom tho standpoint of tho sei
vlco and Iho nation, of refusing to promote
reipeclnblc, elderly Incompetents The
higher places should be given to the mo.it
deserving men without rogmd to sealoilty;
nt least seulnrlt) should bo treated ns only
