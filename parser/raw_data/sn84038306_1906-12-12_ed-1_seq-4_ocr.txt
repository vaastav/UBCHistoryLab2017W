WEDNESDAY,
DEC. 12,1906
Supt. R. S7'J6hnson Complimented.
George A. Lincoln, 6tate fish and
game warden, made public his an
nual report last week, in which he
speaks of Mr Jolinson and the gov
ernment hatchery as follows:
"In connection with this distribu
tion of fish, I dssire to call your at
tention to the great work done by
the United States Fish commission,
under the djreolion of 1?. S. Johnson,
superintendent of the oveiiimeut.
hatchery at Manchester. The many
requests of other citizens of the
stiite for fish, both for the public
Waters of the state and pouds and
lakes owned by private parties, have
been carefully attended to and
thanks are due him."
The report of Mr. Johnson to Mr.
Lincoln, which is given a place in
the appendix) shows that fish were
placed during 1905 as follows:
Rainbow trout, fry, 390,000
Rainbow trout, yearlings, 10
Rainbow trout, adults, 240,
Brook trout, yearling. 25,8(H),
Tike perch, fry, 800,000,
Croppies", 17,700,' gist
Lake trout, adults. 132, ffife
Steel head trout, adv.lts, 16!),
Ring perch, adults, 365,
Small mouth black bass, 250,
Large mouth black bass, 8,440,
Catfish, 3,2a0
llock bass, .1,225,
Pike, 7,500
In bis report, Mr. Lincoln makes
a strong plea for a resident hunter's
license. He submits reasons why
such a law should be passed and a
greater portion of his report is in
connection with that matter.
IN OTHER STATES.
Mr. Lincoln shows that a resident
licence law is effective in the follow
ing states and that the amount plac
ed opposite each one is the amount
raised by reason of such law:
Wisconsin $100,000
Illinois 120,000
Indiana .! 50,000
Missouri 50,000
Minnesota 40,000
Michigan 20,000
Nebraska 15,000
Idaho 25,000
Colorado 20,000
North Dakota 5,000
South Dakota 10,000
Washington 20,000
Wyoming 5,000
DIRTIUIIUTION OK I'ISII
Mr. Lincoln, presents a table show
ing that the Iowa fish car traveled
2,940 miles (luring the year 1005
and that he estimates that 125,000
fish were distributed to the follow
ing places: Waucoma in the Tur
key'river Riceville, in the Wupsie
Marfha'ltown, in Lake Dewey El
lora, in theTowa river Spirit Lake,
in the lake Marion, in Indian creek
and Cedar Rapids, in the Cedar riv
er. These lisli consisted of bass,
pike, pickerel, croppie, perch, sun
lish, catfish, etc., and are of the size
that will take care of themselves
nfter being placed in the different
streams and lakes, while a majority
will spawn and reproduce the. next
season.

CAINS IN KLOItT CHOPS..
"On the tide of grains over 1905,"
he says, "two short crops are con
spicuous. Hay loads, with a
gain of perhaps §80,000,000 in value,
and the oat crop is second, with a
gain of possibly $14,000,000. liarley
and cotton seed each promise a «ain
of10,000.000, beet sugar $7,000,
•000, tobacco $2,OCX),000 or more and
hops $1,000,000. Against these
gains are the losses of three abund
ant crops—$00,000,000, more or
less, for wheat and $
10,000,000 cacli
for corn and potatoes. Tlio lo-w of
rye and cane t-'iigar may bo about
half a million dollars each, if any
thing. While the value of all
cereals dropped about $40,000,000
below the total ol 1905, the number
of bushels for 1901!, which was -I,
088,000,000, was 120,000,000 bushels
above tlio yield of 19(15
The estimate ol the value of the

that losses meet gains, and the crops
have been on such a high price level
in the general average that they
have raised the total crop value
somewhat above 1905 and the high
jreceeding years. To reach a still
ligher point in this extraordinary
series of high annual values than
had been touched before is an
achievementthat deserves attention."

Every time the clock ticks a sec
ond during ten hours of a workday
the farmer drives nine meat animals
to the butcher," is the statement
made by Secretary Wilson in re
ferring to the nation's meat supply,
lie furnishes some interesting
statistics showing the increase in
the price of meat. The average re
tail price of meat, he says, for all
kinds in the proportion of actual
consumption was 12:[ cents in 1900,
13 cents in 1901 and 13£ cents in
1905. This average he declares, in
crea°ed perhaps to 1 or at the most
to 14 cents in 190(5.
At these average meat prices,"
Secretary Wilson continues, "and
with t'ie meat consumption of 1900,
the naticnil retail meat bill was §2,
052,279,000 in 1900 and it was $2,
303,578,000 to $2,345,401,000 in
1900. Every increase of one-fourth
of a cent per pound in the national
average retail price of meat raises
the yearly total expense to consum
ers by §41,883,000. The increase
of 1 cent a pound since 1900 cost
consumers this year §167,533,000.''
•'w Washington Letter.
Washington D. C., Dec. 0, .190(5.
It seems rather queer in this day
to hear talk of states rights. But
that is the tiling that is now upper
most in Washington conversation.
There is no section of the President's
message to Congress that has caused
more talk than tho section relating
to Japanese alTairs on the Pacific
Coast. The general.opinion, though
not the one generally voiced, is that
the message so far as it deals with
Japan is a gigantic bluff It sounds
ell, sounds particularly well
abroad. In this may be noted the
comments that have come back by
cable from London The British
government has been having anti
Asiatic trouble of its own in the
colonies recently, and has been
obliged to deal with the sentiment
in Australia and the Transvaal
Therefore the words about equality
and fraternity were particularly
welcome as being in line with the
policy that Great. Britain hasalreadv
adopted.
So far as Japan is concerned, the
statement in the message cannot be
accepted in other than good faith
and it'sho'ws' that the administration
is willing to do all it can to settle
the question to the satisfaction of
Japan, liut if it be shown that the
control of school affairs on the Pacific
Coast is beyond the reach of the
federal government even through
treaty rights, then both Japan and
tho Federal government will have to
bow to the inevitable and do the
best they can under the circum
stances. The talk of using military
force against the states of the coast
is well enough in published corres
pondence, but the schemes of send
ing federal troops against a state has
been tried'once in this country, and
it is not likely that it will be tried
again over so Bmall a matter as the
schooling of Asiatics.
IIS
Secretary Wilson's Report.
There are some very interesting
facts and figures in the annual re
port of Secretary Wilson, recently
forwarded to President Roosevelt. It
shows that the prosperity of the
agricultural sections continuesto in
crease.
"Taken at that point in produc
tion," says Secretary Wilson, "at
which they acquire commercial value,
the farm products of the year, esti
mated for every detail presented by
the census, have a farm value of
§0,794,000,000. This is $485,000,
000 above the value of 1905, $035,
000,000 above 1904, $870,000,000
above 1903, and $2,077,000,000
above the census for 1899 The
value of farm products of 1
!K)(! was
S per cent greater than that of 1905,
10. per cent over 1901, 15 percent
over 1903, and 41 per cent over
1899."
"Crops so largo as to be beyond
any rational comprehension," he
continues, "have strained the freight
carrying ability of railroads. Direct
ly and indirectly the farmer has set
up-a demand for iron and steel that
has exceeded the productive power
of the chief producer among nations.
Ilis contribution to the supply of
loan capital has been beyond calcu
lation ai reealle the fact that the
depression in the loan and invoht
ment market of 1903 was cl
away by the following crop. 1
while, the farmer has been a g.
ous consumer and lias given pcAr
ful support to the market of llJFlii
ilustrial producer, to the trade of the
merchant and to the wages of the
working man:"
The probable course is that a test
case will be made in the courts, and
carried speedily to the Supreme
Court. If that tribunal decides that
the Japanese must be admitted to
the public schools of the coast, the
people of California, Washington
and Oregon will probably admit
lliem and send their own children
elsewhere. Hut if the court decides
the opposite, the government of
Japan will be notified of the dicision
and the matter will be allowed to
rest. As several of tho senators and
representutives have pointed out,
any talk of war is worse than use
less. It is
Hilly.
No sooner has
u,-
I
CongresB
gotten to­
gether for the new session than
there is talk of an extra session in
in the air. It is naturally over the,
question of tarifl revision. There is
now talk that a special message will
bo sent to Congress, and that there
will be a special session called on
March 5th next. Massachusetts is
in the lead about this. She wants
tariff revision more than any other
of the manufacturing states and
practically the whole of the state
delegati-m is solid lor the idea. The
Democrats are of course in favor of
tariff revision and they hold that
tlice is more prospect of getting it
now than should the party wait till
Roosevelt is succeeded by Taft,
Fairbanks, Shaw, or some of the
other men who areavowed standpat
ters. There is a question whother
in ease the subject can be brought
up for discussion, it would be wise
to open the whole question. There
is a strong element,'in favor of set
tling on some or the schedules that
are now obviously too hiah, and
Xow that the Interstate Conimeri
Commission has been enlur cl,
there seems to be more piling up for
it than even the enlarged commission
ran tin, and there is serious talk ol
milling two new members to it. One
of I he first jobs hai it. is expected to
tackle is the investigation of the
Harriman system of railroads. These
roads are alleged to constitute the
greatest combination in restraint of
trade in the country. The Uni-jn
Pacific is peculiarly liable to govern
ment supervision and control because
of a provision in its charter permit
ting the government to regulate the
earnings over six per cent. But it
is claimed that the combination of
the so called Harriman lines now is
greater trust than that contem
plated by the Northern Securities
Company. It is said that while the
dissolution of this trust if it were
dissolved would be a matter for the
Supreme Court, that the Interstate
Commerce Commission, with its
mandate to "supervise and inquire
into" the conduct of the railroads,
would be the first bureau to have a
try at the investigation aud florae
lung of the sort may be expected
very soon.

"'M The Chautauqua Idea I
The last five years has seen a phe
nomenal growth in the number of
Chautauquas until they are now as
common as lecture courses were ten
vears ago. In spite of the increasing
number of them each is more succet
ful and the demand for more assem
bly's in new places increases. The
quality of their programs steadily
improves. The modern Chautauqua
represents a week's pleasent outing
where intellectual feasts, superb en
tertainments, rest, recreation, renew
al of old friendships and the making
of new ones are the order of the day.
One returns to ones work after such
a week's enjoyment a new man or
woman, with broader and brighter
ideals for the Winter's work. An old
farmer was heard to say last sum
mer that he would gladly toil
through another hard year's work if
he could attend the next season's
Chautauqua. If you love music, come.
If 3'ou enjoy good lectures, come. If
you like humor and fun, comedaily.
If you like travel talks be sure to

The Luborerit of Servin,

prosaic fellow. His altire is coarse al
most to tlie point of ungainllncss—
rough brown trousers of homespun,
coat shade or two darker and edged
with strip of black Uecce a peaked
woolen cap and a cane, and you have
the picture. He Is a farmer 011 a small
scale, and his hobby is raising hogs,
which he turns into the forests or
fields to fatten on mast. The rural life
in Servia is primitive. At sunup folks
rise, hike their rakl, or schnapps, and
go to the fields to work. Their meal Is
brought to them at noon and again In
the evening, for they often work until
sunset. And so life goes on and on.
Across the bluffs that border, the riye»',
a road runs parallel with the Danube,
and here workmen are seen, dressed
often In white suits with red girdles,
striving to bring from the earth the
grain that will not come. In noumnnta
aud Bulgaria tho grain lands are rich,
but here the earth seems stubborn and
unproductive. So the laborer ekes out
his existence as he may—the least In
teresting of all the laborers of southern
Europe.

The Battle of Redonda.
Not far from St. Thomas, a matter of
perhaps a hundred miles, "was fought
the most wonderful naval battle lu all
history. The Dutch admiral detected
the enemy in the early morning, when
the sei was covered with a thick mist,
and liis guns opened fire at ouco with
out warning. The fire was returned
with interest, the ocean fairly quiver
iug wltb spasms caused by the shock
of frequent discharges. Somehow or
othc^* the enemy's shots, which sound
ed like a bombardment, seemed to fall
shout or go wide of the mark, for not
even a splash of a ball was heard, and
the .Dutch ships remained uuscathed.
On tlie other hand, the Dutch could not
free the terrible execution their guns
were doing until nearly the middle of
the forenoon, when the fog lifted, re
vealing to their astonished gaze not the
vessels of the euemy, but a great rock
standing out of the sea. They had beeu
firliig at It for five hours, aud the sound
of the return shots they heard was the
echo from the solid wall of granite.
They named the place Itedonda, which
means sent, rolled or driven back* and
Redonda It is to this day.
One of the Fumlly.
r'-"-
James Seymour, the artist, was boru
In London In 1702. He displayed a
fondness.for drawing and painting in
boyhood and subsequently gained ce
lebrity by Ills skill in designing horses.
Once tlie proud Duke of Somerset em
ployed Seymour to paint a room at his
seat in Sussex, with the portraits of his
running horses. Having admitted the
artist to his table, he one day drank to
him, saying:
"Cousin Seymour, your health."
The painter replied, "My lord, I real
ly believe that I have the honor of be
ing of your grace's family."
This hurt the pride of the duke so
much that he rose from the table and
ordered his steward to pay Seymour
and dismiss him. Finding, however,
that no one In Englaud could complete
the pictures begun, he condescended to
sena tor his cousin. The painter re
sponded to the message in these words:
"My lord, I will now prove that 1 am
of swill* grace's family, for I won't
come."
Sea Otter Skin.
The furrier was taking his stock out
of the cDld storage room. It came
forth frozen stiff and coated with glis
tening white frost. But there was one
beautiful skin that, though jnst as stiff
its any of the others, had no frost on It.
"I want you to look at this skill," he
said. "It Is the kind that the richest
Russians, graud dukes, and so on, have
their overcuat collars made of. It Is a
sea otter's skin, and it Is so expensive
that ot'ten oue coat collar of it will cost
$300. It Is unquestionably the best
skin in the world to make coat collars
of. Why? Look at this one, and you'll
see. All my other skins are covered
with frost, while on this fur no frost
whoever appears. And that's the rea
son why sea otter skins make the best
coat collars. The breath, for some un
known reason, doesn't freeze on them."

Diutliisfnltthert by Movement*.^
Observant and far sighted persons
distinguish nt great distances a man
from a woman, uot by dress, face or
figute, but by movements. The mo
tions of the most graceful of men are
ungainly when compared with the sinu
ous lines that most women instinctively
assume. It often happens that a single
motion of a distant figure, and especial

The constable is an observant man,
aud his observation had its reward at
Marlborough street one morning. It
was' the case of a hansom driver who
had'run into a four wheeler, and the
constable maintained in the witness
box that the hansom driver was drunk.
"There was a bit of a dispute," said
the driver," and the constable admit
ted as much. "You was a bit doubtful
about me bciii* drunk, wasn't you
now?" continued the driver solemnly.
"I was, just a bit," said the constable

as saying: "There's that man Disraeli.
Thcv tell me he is a good speaker.
Perhaps I do not know what a good
speaker is. But 1 read a speech of his
that he delivered In Glasgow a year or
two ago, and It appeared to me the
greatest jargon of nonsense that ever
got Into any poor creature's head.".

these grouped together, emit at night
