Congress during tlio past week luisdono
but littlo besides fretting into working or
der by tlio formation of committees Ac.
But few bills of general interest' liuvo been
offered. Mr. Sumner however lias offered
one very ridiculous bill, which is, to issue
ten million of compound interest notes
each month and retire an equal amount of
green backs, nit if currency was not
Bcarce enough now without offering further
inducement for persons to hoard it up. lie
also Rtnrtled the Senate by giving notice
that he should introduce a bill to abolish
the Internal Rovcnuo Bureau.
Civil Reform. 1
The President in his recent Message lays
much stress on tlio necessity of reform in
the manner in which official appointments
are mado. There is no doubt much truth
in this assertion, but we think thero never
will bo much reform until the constitution
is so amended that no person can fill tho
Presidential chair, two successive terms.
Take away tho temptation to "fix tilings"
for a re-election, and one great step lias
been taken towards securing a reform in
tho appointment of subordinate officers.
Wo believe that no officer who has pub
lic patronage at his disposal should tio eli
gible to a re-election, and tho fact of an
officer seeking tho nomination for a second
term is sufficient to warrant the belief that
tho power invested in his hands may have
been used to promote his private, rather
than tho public good.
With the " one term" law in operation
no cause for such belief would exist,and wo
trust the t inio will soon come when neither
President or Governor or any other officer
with patronage at his disposal, can legally
tie a candidate for a re-election.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Tho President commences his message
by congratulating himself that he has been
enabled to enforce the laws on tho statute
book, and he says he has done this without
stopping to inquire as to their wisdom. Af
ter referring to the satisfactory condition
of our relations with all other nations, he
speaks of the troubles regarding the fish
ery boundaries as follows :
"1 recommend that tho legislation neces
sary on the. part of tho United States to
bring into operation articles of treaty rela
tions of the United States toward British
North American provinces to become oper
ative so soon as proper legislation Bhall lie
had on the ynui of Great Britain and its
possessions. It is much to be desired that
this legislation may become oporativo be
fore tlio fishermen of tho United States be
gin t make their arrangements for the
coming season."
Tlfti President says the government was
compelled to csk the recall of tho Russian
Minister owing to his impertinent meddling
with affairs that did no concern him.
Ho calls the attention of Congress to the
damaging effect of tlie continued fluctua
tions in our currency, and asks for legisla
tion that will give a ilxod und steady valuo
to the samo, but does not suggest any meth
od for accomplishing so dusirablo an object.
Tho steady increase of the receipts of tho
Post Office department are referred to as
evidences of tho growth of education, and
the President favors tho uniting of tho tel
egraph system to the postal department.
Tho reduction of the National debt has
boon so great tlint the President thinks
that modilication of the tariff and the rovc
nuo laws will be advisable, mid that it is
not necessary that this rapid payment 1
tlio dobt should be continued. His ideas
upon the subject of tho tariff coinc.ido with
tlio old whig doctrino and are as follows :
" I therefore recommend a modilication
of both tho tariff and internal tax laws, and
recommend that all taxes Lorn internal
sources 1h nlMilished except tlio.se collected
from Hpiritoua, vinous and malt liquors, to
bacco in its various forms, aud from stamps.
In re-adjusting the tariff I suggest that a
careful estimate bo made of the amount of
surplus rcvenuo collected under tho present
laws, after providing for tlio current expen
scs 01 mo uovernmenr, tno' interest ac
count and a sinking fund; and, that this
surplus bo reduced in such a manner as to
nfford the grcntext relief to the gTcatost'mtm
bcr. Thoro are many articles not produoed
at homo, but which enter largely into gen
eral consumption, through articles' which
are manufactured at home, such as medi
cines, compounds, etoi, , from, which very
littlo revonuo is derivod, but which outer
into general two All mrch article I recom
mend to bo placed on tho free list. Should
a further reduction provo advisable, I
would then recommend that it be mad
upon those articles which can best bear it
without disturbing homo production or re
ducing tho wage of American labor." .
In reference to tho troubles in Utah tho
President suggests that Congress considers,
what, in the execution of the laws against
polygamy, is to lie tho status of plural
wives and their offspring, and thinks that
laws might be passed legitimizing children
born previous to a certain dato. .....
Tlio President is opposed to giving away
any more of tho public lands to corporations
and unon this subject says :
." I renew my recommendation that tho
public lands bo regarded as a horitago to
our children to lie disposed of only as re
quired for occupancy and to actual settlers.
Thoso already granted have been in great
part disposed of in such a way as to secure
access to tho balance by tho hardy settler
who may wish to avail himself of them, but
caution should bo exercised even in attain
ing so desirable an object."
Tho condition of tho Southern States and
tho amnesty question is disposed of as fol
lows :
"More than six years have elapsed since
the last hostile gun was. fired between the
armies then arrayed against each other
one for tho perpetuation, the other for
tho destruction of the Union it may well
be considered whether it is not now time
that the disabilities imposed by the Four
teenth amendmeut should bo removed.
That amendment does not exclude the bal
lot, but only imposes the disability to hold
offices upon certain classes. When the
purity of the ballot is secure majorities are
sure to elect officers reflecting the views of
tho majority. I do not soe tho advantage
or propriety of excluding men from ofllco
merely because thoy were before the rebel
lion of standing und character, sufficient to
bo elected to positions requiring thorn to
take oaths to support tho constitution, and
admitting to eligibility those entertaining
precisely tho same views, but of less stand
ing in their communities. It may bo said
that tho former violatod an oath, whilo the
latter did not have it in their power to do
so. If they had taken this oath it cannot
be doubted they would have broken it as
did the formor class. i
If thero are any great criminals distin
guished for the part they took in opposition
to the Government, they might, in the
judgment of Congress, bo excluded from
such an amnesty. This subject is submit
ted for your careful consideration. The
condition of the Southern States is, unhap
pily, not such as all tmo patriotic citizens
would like to see Social ostracism for
opinion's sake, personal violence or threats
toward suchpersons us entertain political
views opposed to those entertained by the
majority of the old citizens prevents immi
gration an3 the flow of much needed capi
tal into the States lately in rebellion. It
will be a happy condition of the country
when tho old citizens of those States will
tako an intorest in public affaire, promul
gate ideas honestly entertained, vote for
men representing their viows, and tolerate
the same freedom of expression and ballot
in those entertaining different political con
victions." ,
The President closes his message by
earnestly recommending a reform in the
civil service, and trusts that the board
convened for that purpose will lo enabled
to devise a plan which will remedy tho evil
and lie a great advantage to tho Executive
and all the heads of tho departments.
Death from Blowing Down
Chimney.
nip
The Luzerne Union records another ter
rible accident resulting from tho too com
mon practice of blowing down a lump
chimney to extinguish tho light. The cus
uality occurred in Cleveland, I'a., a few
nights since. Mrs. Elizabeth Stark dis
rolied to retire about 10 o'clock. She at
tempted to extinguish hot' coal oil lamp, in
a very common manner, by blowing dowu
tho chimney. Tho lamp exploded, throw
ing over her the blazing liquid, and iu an
instant she was enveloped in flames and
was terribly burned. There scorns no end
to accidents resulting from the careless use
of coal oil, and people cannot be too care
ful how they manage and handle their
lighted lamps.
-r
A Singular Case.
Mr. EH Ilempstcd died a short time since
in New Haven from a most singular cause.
Bomo years ago he was attacked with insan
ity and was sent to tho Insane Kotreat in
Hartford. '. While thero ho pushed a watch
key up his noso, and after his recovery- in
formed his physician what ho had done.
An effort was made to got It out, without
siiccoxH. He left tho Retreat, and nothing
further was done to remove tho article,
though ho occasionally spoko of feeling it.
in a year or two uo was attacked with a
sharp pain in at the lower part of tho right
lung, Ho so fibred from it for some time,
when it passed away and for two years he
enjoyod good health. A few weeks ngo he
went to New Haven with nn invoice of pro
duce, and while engaged in lifting barrels
was again attacked with pain and bleeding
from the lungs. - Ho was taken to his fath
er's house, where in a few days lie died.
His case was so singular that the physicians
made a post mortem examination, when
they found tho key embedded in tho low
cr part of tho lung, , and surrounded by a
lump in a state of mortification. Tho key
had dropped out of tho noso through the
windpipe into tho lung, and had remnined
there four years. '
Anchored to a Whale A Strango Story.
Tho Boston Herald says: Captain John
Evitt, of tho Ashing schooner, Charles U.
Price, of Salem, Mass., which arrived home
from a eruisp yesterday, reports tho follow
ing strange story. , Tlio schooner was an
chored off Grand Bank, ten days ago, with
about 200 fathoms of hemu cable out and
about ready to start for homo, having ta
ken about 13,000 pounds halibut. Tho
cook throw ovor a lino to catch a fish
for dinner, and having caught ouo, threw
the lino over again and found it teuded aft
at a remarkablo rate. . Thinking it strange,
ho called from tho cabin tho captain, who
canio on dock, wont forward, aud found
tho vessel going ahead at about Ave knots
speed, but could not account for it. He or
dered all hands called, and thoy hove in the
cable , to within about v thirty fathoms,
when they discovered that, their anchor had
got hooked to a large whale, which thoy
had before seen at somp distance. The
whalo ran with the schooner some little
time longer., The crew, weather-bitted the
cable, and iu a short timo the whale sound
ed, broke the anchor, and carriod away
with hira a good part of it. The black
skin is to be seen on the cable whero it
chafed on tho whale. Tho ring and a small
piece of tbo anchor were all that was left
attached to the cable; the flukes are gone,
and are supposed to have somehow become
attached to tho body of tho whale.
Charged with Murder.
An old colored man named Edinboro
Smith, who lived by himself on Laurel Hill,
about three miles from Johnstown,and who
had some money about his house, was mur
dered on Wednesday evening, August 13,
18G5, in his own dwelling. ' lie was found
weltering in his blood early the next day.
Suspicion rested upon a person who was
loitering iu the neighborhood the previous
day, but who could not bo identified then.
Recently information was made charging
a young man named George Gates, with
committing tho deed, and on the 2d inst.,
ho was arrested aud taken to the Cambria
comity jail. A motion for a writ of habeas
corpus was made before the court at Ebons
burg which was granted and returnable on
Monday, Decemlier 11th, at 7 o'clock p. m.
Awkward.
A citizen of Elizabeth, N. J., 'wont to
the cars on Thanksgiving day to see his
daughter tiff. Securing her a scat,he passed
out of the cars, and went round to her win
dow to say a parting word, as is frequently
done on such occasions. While he was
passing out tho daughter left the seat to
speak to a friend, and at the same timo, a
prim-looking lady, who occupied tho scat
with her, moved up to tho window. Una
ware of tho important changes inside, our
venerable friend hastily put his face up to
tho window nnd hurriedly exclaimed, "Ono
more kiss, pet." In another instant the
point of a blue cotton umbrella caught his
seductive lips, followed by the passionate
injunction, " Scat, you old gray-headed
wretch I" and lie scatted. ' '
Thero is a man at Spring Grove.
Houston county, Minnesota, who is grad
ually turning into stone. He is completely
petrified in all his limbs and body the
only exception leing a portion above tho
mouth, throat aud eyes. He has a good
appetito, eats, and prays day and night for
tho Lord to deliver him from this, terriblo
affliction. Ho is perfectly helpless. Tho
process of pertriflcation commenced some
time last spring in his foot und knees,
sinco which time it has gradually increased.
K3l There is a young ludy in Boston who
was persuaded the other day to givo a
private exhibition of her beautiful head of
long and heavy black hair, llor height is
five feet throe inches, and when she it
standing erect her hair falls to her feet, and
trails a quarter of a yard on tho Aoor. It
is soventy-flvo inches in length. ; Here,
indeed, is a fuvored young person. No
need has she of chignons, nor of trieoph
erous compounds ; and Eve herself, tho
primal aud perfect woman nobly planned,
had probably no greater wealth of tangled
charms.
