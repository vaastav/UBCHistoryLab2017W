nothing to disturb the relations of confi
dence and good will between Alabama and
her sister States, and she baa bo controver
sy with the tFeaeral Government. On the
contrary, the people and the State goverc
mect are in earnest accord In support of
every measure that tends to promote the
welfare of the entire people of the Union ?
and to maintain the honor and credit of the
genera! government. Within our borders
there is no lack of the means ot comforta
ble subsistence, and in many respects we
are blessed with abundance; peace and con
tentment prevail, and a new and growing
prosperity strengthens the hopes of the
people and gives them courage in their
efforts to utilize all the rich and bountlfu.
resources with which nature has endowed
this beautiful land.—[Governor Cobb's IB
augural Add r ess.
Ix the bihob which comes from Wash
ington that the Republican *>d Democratic
managers have becom* so fearful of each
other that political investigations are likely
to be stoppied, by mutual content, be true,
it will be regarded as a confession of fraud
by each, that ia likely to deepen the con
tempt which reflecting persons are hardly
able to conceal for popular government.
Nothing ean affect the conviction which all
ubservers of the events of *74 entertain of
the precedure by which an unsuccessful
candidate was fraudulently counted in, and
a successful candidate was cowardly be
trayed by the leaders of his p>arty in Cou
gre*», who consented to and prompted the
psssage of a law by which an unconstitu
tional commission was formed, and the
method of the constitutisc was abandened.
No honorable man can with complacency
contemplate the proceedings by which,
a-tively on the part of one party, and per
tniseively by the other, fraud was seated in
the highest office in the country. But that
is history which cannot be affected by in
vesUgation.
•• The only question that is ncdacided is
the guilt or innoeenee of Hayes or Tilden,
and that is of vital interest to the whole
people. If Mr. Hayes rewarded ballot sniff
ers and forgers ef returns with positions of
honor sed profit, knowing their guilt he 1*
as guilty as the worst of the criminals who
made his false return: snd If Tilden ecu
ceived, participated in, or assented to the
frauds In Oregon and the South, he is as
guilty as the guiltiest of the Hayes elecoral
thieves.''
Let the investigation proceed—if exposure
of fraud be the purpose of lt.

CiycTX5A*n, Dec. 2, ISIS.
The Enquirer of to-day ha* a page and
a half of interview? with Southern men
upon political issue? that are likely to
Ctoie forward between now and 1SS0, end
tbe choice of the various State? of Presi
dential candidates for the contest of that
year. On the republican side for the in
terviewer? embrace met, of both politics)
parties i tie most significant feet L? that
they demand, with almost perfect unani
mity, Grant's re-election and the reaora
ti'c of the government support to their
part.-. Among the democrat* the most
noticeable feature is that they ask nothing
in the way of candidates for the South, but
are content to iet the North name the ticket
while thev will support it unquestiooingly.
In Kentucky such men a* Senator Beck
and Congressman Blackburn say that Ohio
promises to be the pivotal State in the
next Presidential campaign, and it will be
necessary for the democratic party, if it
succeeds, to carry that State. They be
lieve that a Western man is necessary to
this, and that Thurman is the most popular
man in the West, unless it may be Hen
dricks. Blackburn says Thurman is 5,000
votes more popular than any other demo
crat in Ohio, and argues from that the
necessity of making hi in the nominee to
get Ohio'* twenty-two votes in the elector
al college. Among Kentucky republi
cans. including poi masters and revenue
officers of all grades who have been ap
pointed by Hayes, there is a unanimous
call for Grant for a third term. Failing to
ge: him they put Coukling as their second
choice. In a long Northern line of States
General Ben Harrison's name is spoken of
for a place on the ticket. In Tennessee
the democrats show a partiality for green
back doctrines in finance. Hendrick

the leading man for lbSO.

Many leading republicans are outspoken
in dislike to Hayes' adminL-tration. This

The republican leaders are all in fevor of

be righted through the federal jadiciary,

propriety of criticising the Message for the
suggestions about the elections in h JOth
CaroHaca and Louisiana- As long as the
of Congress is on the statutes be said it
the duty of the President to see that
the law was executed. The fact that Mr.
Hayes called attention to election frauds in
South Carol tana and Louisiana and not to
frauds in New York, spoken of by Mr.
Wood to-day. cannot be considered an
effort on Mr. Hayes' part to suppress any
infertmtion as to N York elections, as his
attention was not called to them. Mr
Wood himself said there had been no pub
