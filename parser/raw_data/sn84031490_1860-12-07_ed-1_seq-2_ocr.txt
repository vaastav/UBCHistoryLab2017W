There is ho provision in the Constitution
to pay ter fugitive laborers. That instrument:
regards'apd describes glares
hdd to labor by virtue of State laws, and
not as it-deelaree tkaVwhca
persons held to labor- ‘‘-under State laws,

into another, they shall not be discharged
from such obligation 5 by 1 Yifttifcttf law
or regulation of the Bute in to winch they,
may escape, but shall bq ( delivered yp on
the t*t»m of the party to whom the service
was due; 1 This rendition dauSe applies to
while men and apprentice boys in the Free
Staley‘who may have contracted to labor
for another, and run off to the Soutb to
avoid its well as to slaves in
the South, who break their obligation to la
bor, and flee into the Free Stales.! !All the
complainant has to do in cither case, is to
show that the black orwhite manna bound
to serve him by virtue of a law of his Bute.
Tho nature *of Ihi obligation; fit Svheiher :
there has beenajralid
or a fair bargain made, arc questions to be
determined in the courts of the State from

their picks and vyhedbarrows and abscond

party brig exactly' the same OonsUtutional
right to have the fugadous laborersrecap-.

party has no better or more valid claim for
indemnity out Of
the other, , #ndiTTOA^tto^. ; Y.:^’iiw\‘^ -

Now, where is the statesman who will
seriously assert that Congress has power
under the Constitution iu pay * employers
the losses they 7 uilglit sustain by ifeasbn'of
the bad faith of thdr employees, who might
rhn off and leave .the .Staty?. If it were
Constitutional .to enactjsuch a law as the
Times proposes, it would, cpst the Federal
Trcosury.jnore tij?n to t cairyon
against France and England. The Gov
ernment k would he. bankrupted before*
twdvc months, and would not be able to
pay ten dents on the dollar of the dolma
that would he preferred against it every
year thereafter, . ,Breaches -of-labor con
tracts’of all imaginable descriptions, in’
countless numbers, would be entered in the
court iof -claims tor payment.:’ But the le
gal absurdity of the proposition is so ap
parent-that il is needless to farther
it. We might stop here, but in order to ex
pose t beZCimc* nostrum as a
cdy, we will waive the Constitutional ob
jection* and suppose, for the sake of argu :
meat, that! Coy power to pass such
an act as>it suggests.
The first thing to ho /considered is the
scale ol prices which the Government shall
pay the losers ofEughiYß .-Slaves.; The
Tima proposes Ihattbey he paid two&Srjj*
of their commercial value.' This is inet
with theobjection, that if it he the duty of ;
the Government to pay anything, U should
pay the fair market value of .the property
lost Equity.and good conscience require
tbis much. If the Korth ever concedes the;
principle of any indemnity from the Federal
Treasury, jhc ; .Souths will never accept a
cent less than the fair value of the Fugi
live. • And common honesty would render
a verdict that the master Is entitled to the
whole or none. It would be a dishonest
position to. take, that the. 'slaveholder was
constitutionally and legally entitled to in*,
demoity from the Government for his loss,
and then turn round and cheat him Out of
onc-tlardot his just claim: Congress will
. neverhe guilty of so base a thing. It will
allow the cTaimanllHe Ibll Valhtf or noth
ing. . ..fhcrc is no use in . wasting .words
over a matter so certain and imperative in

Placeholder has now a legal remedy pt the

character. It redaims his fugitive bond

applied; and.if the human chatlle is res-
from the captors, this law renders the
rescuers liable ih damages for the full value
of the slave,* with costs of suit, added to
fines and imprisonment. Tf the lawTs not

. -I; A SAD SPECTACLE. ,
. No more striking example of the extent
to which’ Slavery has debauched the mind
and conscience of many of the public men
of this country, has heretofore, been wit
nessed, than is to be found in the manner
' in which the secession question is treated
in the Message of President Buchanan.
'The Chief Executive of the Nation, in the
performance of a Constitutional' duty re
quiring the strictest impartiality between
sections and between States, assumes the
rule of a special pleader in behalf of Slave
ry audits preposterous exactions. , Qc has
‘do word to. oiler in reprobation of
the contemplated treason of certain
of the slaveholding States, but seeks
rather, their justification before the.
world and in the eye of future history. He f
assumes that-they are the injured party;
and he implores the free States to concede
i to the former all that they -demand as a
I condition precedent to the abandonment of:
I tiielr treasonable designs. .He denounces
j in unmeasured terms the free States os bc
| ing responsible for all the mischief which
I slavery and its upholders have brought
1 audnowlhrcalentobringupon the country.
IBs entire treatment of the subject, is a la
: bored defence of those who openly boast
of the intention of disrupting the
I Confederacy, of 1 taking '- up arms, if
[ r need be, against the Government of the
I United States, and of plunging the : country
1 into the nameless horrors of civil war.

and which the. free Slates have reluctantly ■
yielded; the numerous shameful and 1 ,

petrated upon their citizens when, in

occasion to go into certain • dayeholding :

Of .these and a thousand other provocations

■ Let the Southern Senators' and. members' of
the House of Representatives zhoeton the first
day of the session, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, and present to the Black Bepnbli
cao niajorlty a request that they, without the
aid of a Southern votcii will adopt thcfbllow
ing resolutions, and enforce them!by acts of
Congress Immediately, viz-:
- l jUtoloed, That the rights of the people of
the Southern States arc In all respects equal to
those of the people of the Northern States
under the Constitution* of tbcUnited States.
; 2. JladveH; That the propdrty*of the people
of the South Is as fully protected by the Con
stitution of the United Slates, as that of the
people of the North.
t /& Jiudted, That the slaves of the South arc
•property -under the .Constitution of -the Uni
ted States, and os fully protected - by it os any
other property intheUnlted States.,.
4. Jiesc&ed, That the Fugitive Slave law Is
constitutional, and ought to be executed; and
! aU State laws intended, or calculated to defeat
orpreventits execution, ought to bo repealed.
b. Jtadved, That the Temtories of the Unit-,
cd States are the common property of all llie
States, and, therefore, the people of all the
States have an equal right to enter upon and
occupy them (If any have that right,) and to
lake with them thmrpropcrty, whatever iUnay.
be. »
G. Hadvcdy' That the decision oftho Supreme -
Court of the United States; in the case of Dred
Scott,, correctly expounds the rights or the in
habitants in the Territories of the United States
and by that exposition neither Congress or a
Territorial Legislature has the right to jwss
any law discriminating between slaves and any
other property, to the disadvantage or Injury
-of the rigfebflbeslaVc owner, r or denying or
withholding from him the same remedies for
the preservation anti-recovery, ot his property
which are. furnished to the .owner. oCother.
property for the protection, preservation and
recovery of his property.
7. Jtesolccd, That the citizens of every State
have the right of peaceful transit with their
slaves through every other Slate, and every
ntlcmptto prevent such transit or. to deprive
them of their slaves on the transit, under
any pretence whatever, is an illegal and uncon
stitutional tlOtotiofi of thefr’righlsr" ‘ :**
8. Aesofoed,- That-tbe Fugitive Slave- law, as
it now stands upon the statute* hook, is con
stitutional and ought to be enforced; and all
State laws designed or having the effect to de
feat or nullify it, are unconstitutional and
void, and ought to be repealed, and all persons
acting under such laws, where they may not
-be repealed, should be punished by a line'of
not less than five thousand dollars, .and. lm-.
prisonment for hot lees than five years, unless
the fine he paid sooner, and then for one year.
With these resolutions let one be sent from
the Southern members to the following cfleet,
to wit:
JteUved, That the foregoing resolutions be

with the request that they will adopt them,
and procure the written approval of them by
Mr. pass immediately such bills
-as are necessary to give effect and perpetuity
to them; and we hereby pledge ourselves, in
that event, to do everything in our power to
dissuade the Southern States from, and to pro*
vent the secession of any State from Abe Union,
and to restore peace and tranquillity to the
Country, and fairly and in good faith to sup
port the administration of sir. Lincoln.
- If the Black Republicans arc, as Senator
Trnmbull says they arc, the lovers of justice
and a constitutional Union, they will promptly
comply with our request, and save the Union. >
If they refuse, they will stand exposed, and
the South will be lully vindicated before the

THE WASHINGTON PLAN.
The only measure of conciliation of a prac
ticable and practical character is a proposition
In form to amend the Constitution, audits
adoption 7 forthwith' tty a'VwcMhlrds ‘vote in
both Houses, and its ratification by three
fourths of the States within the course of the
next six months. The amendmcnts'ncccssary
to satisfy the South arc:
Ist. Explicit guarantee for. the- faithful exe
cution of the Fugitive Slave Law, and in de
fault the delinquent State to pay for the fu
■gilive.
•Jd. Express and unequivocal declaration
that the right of -the-slaveholder Jp emigrate ,
. .with faJs slaves to the common territory, and
to protection to such property therein, shall
he guaranteed. • •••
3d. That the public domain and its proceeds
shall be appropriated exclusively to public and
national purposes. " ' " *''
4th. That the Federal Government shall be
expressly restricted from undertaking works,
of internal improvements in the States, except
■ only one Pacific Railroad south and one north,
of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes, to which
such aid Is to be limited.
' 5. That Improvements- of rivers and harbors
be left exclusively to the States In which they
•are situated. ■ -
C. That a two thirds vote of both Houses
shall benccessary for any appropriation of mo
ny or land or the creation of any loan.
. *7. A modification ofthc constitutional pro
vision respecting the cjeclijn of President and
Vice President, abolishing the Electoral C6l
- authorizing the vote to be given di
rectly to the-candidate, each. Congressional

what is meant when “ Compromise** is
talked of.
A NEW COMPBOimSE LINE.
Elsewhere in this paper, we print a
letter from a prominent mcrcliant of Chi
cago, now in .N cw Orleans, in which a rem
edy for the present perils to the Union is
briefly set forth.. The writer is sincere and
patriotic; but he has fallen upon the mea
sure of Compromise which the South would
summarily reject; so we need not discuss it.
A Rumored John Brown Raid.
. It was stated by Gen. Clark, the Representa
tive from Bolivar, on the floor of the House of
Representatives of Mississippi, that a private
letter had been received by a gentleman in
Jackson, from another In Wisconsin, inform
ing him that an immense raid was being or
ganized in that State against tbc South. The
plan being for emissaries to bd Introduced gra
dually, sous toavoidsnsplclon,throughout all
the South,' gradually and quietly, when at a
certain time, by preconcerted action, a strike
was to bo made.
With stuff like the above, which we find in
tbc Memphis the Secession papers
arc working tbclr readers up to the pitch of
excitement necessary for the consummation
of their treasonable schemes. Unquestiona
bly the story is false in every particular.

■ the hopes of good men and true patriots who
are laboring to stay the hand of the destroyer,
and roll back the tide of Revolution.
1 do not propose to discuss the question of
the relative responsibility resting upon the
'North and-the South. It is a useless task
where there are wrongs upon both sides, but
'the wrong can never be righted by crimination
, and recrimination. The crisis demands the ex

Cannot something be done by the Northern

ent with their honor and self respect ? I think
so. i Tbe existing excitement ut the South,
though colled Into action by-Mr. Lincoln’s
election, does not result from any appreben,
stem of new- acts of aggression at present
But the.election is regarded as proof of per
sistency in the aggressive policy long since
adopted by some of the States, and as indi
cating the .adoption .of tbe same policy by
others. The “Personal Liberty. Bills,” (so
called) of many of the. Northern States con
tain provisions' palpably in violation of the
Constitutional rights of the South, and deroga
tory to her honor. The prompt repeal of tbe
obnoxious alike by the dic
tates of Justice, Patriotism and Honor—would,
go tar to allay the present 1 earful excitement,
defer hasty action by the revolutionary States,
and. open the way for just and permanent set
tlement of this vexed question of slavery.
This question is the. rqckupon which our ship
of State threatens to bo dashed to pieces.
Amidst the darkness and the storm, woe to
that man who folds h!s hands in selfish com
‘•placcncc, and woe to him who in such on hour
can only heap taunts and reproaches upon the
heads of those who arc involved with him in
a common peril!
. .lean but hint at what appears to me tbe
only practicable course to restore harmony
and peace. It is by means of a Convention of
• dll the States called in a Constitutional manner,
which shall adopt an amendment to the Con
stitution fixing a geographical line, south of
which slavery shall be recognized, and north
of which it may not go.
This' would virtually be a re-enactment of
the Missouri Compromise under the sanction
of the Constitution. Thu repeal of that
measure lies at the foundation of ail our pres
ent trouble, and since that repeal was the
joint work of Northern and Southern States,
tbe adoption of a similar provision in the Con
stitution need not, and 1 think would not, be
regarded as a sectional measure. lam confi
dent it would be popular at the North, and 1
am assured by those whose opinions arc cn
- titled to respect, that it would meet with favor
at the South.
In bopc that rash and Lasty measures may
be avoided, vise counsel prevail, and the bles

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF
. THE INTERIOR.
From the Report of the Secretary of the In
terior, we make such extracts as will bc-of
interest to our readers:
the pltjuc iaxd srsmi.
During the fiscal year ending June 30,15C0,
tlnd the quarter ending the 30lh of September
last, 16,885,361 acres ot public lands have been
proclaimed for sale. During the same period,
V,640,471 acres have been surveyed and pre
wired for market, and 12,060,053. i 2 acres have
- >een disposed of in the following manner:
3,977,619.30 acres have been sold for cash, yield
ing $2,021,425.97; 3,379,040 acres liave been ab
sorbed by the location of bounty land war
: rants; 3,037,770.92 acres approved to States
undertime swamp grants; and 2,665,023 acres
under the railroad grants. The number of
military bounty land warrants outstanding on
the 30th of September last was 74,403, and they
will require 8,106,580 acres of the public do
main to satisfy them.
In former reports I have expressed my deci
ded approval of our existing public laud sys
tem, and my objections to any radical change
in il Forty years ago, the minimum price of
the public lands was fixed at fL 25 per acre,
and at this rate the principal portion of the
lands in thirteen large and populous States on
the eastern elope of the continent have been
settled, purchased and improved; and two
States on the Pacific coast liave now risen Into
Importance, and arc rapidly advancing to pow
er, without any complaint from their citizens
as to the price’ at which public lauds arc sold.
The system of surveys is perfect, the price is
moderate, and the settler is secured in his Im
provements. This being done, the lands not
.taken by pre-emptors are offered at public sale,
‘ the unsold lands become subject to private en
try, Mid the settler on such tract is allowed
twelvemonths within which to make proof
and payment for the quarter section upon
which he has fixed bis home.
When lands have been subject to private en
try for more than ten years, the price tet actual
settlers and cultivators is reduced, from time
.to time, until, after the expiration of thirty
years, it Is only twelve ami a half cents per
acre. The donation —improperly termed home
stead —policy, based upon the fallacy that a
residence on a tract of bind for a certain num
ber of years'shall, Instead of allied price, be
made the consideration which shall entitle the
settler to the land he selects and occupies, has
been tried, and, as stated In my annual reports
of 1858 and 1850,' has everywhere failed and
met with public condemnation.' It was annoy
ing, to the settler, productive of controversies,
and Injurious to the communities in which
the donations were made.
Daring the' past year, in every' case pf the
proclamation and public offering of extensive
portions of the public lands, urgent requests
have been made, as heretofore, fur a postpone
ment of the sales thus ordered. These re-'
quests could not be acceded to without inter
rupting the harmonious operation of the laws
constituting our land system, which requires
the public lands to be brought'into market
from tithe to time, In proportion as surveyed
lands ire disposed of and other lands surveyed. ■
As there has not been any considerable com
petition or cash demand for new lands during
thepastycar, the settlers on thclands brought
Into market, who were unable, from particular
misfortunes, to make payment before the day
of sale, have generally been able to file declara
tory statements after the day of sale, .and thus .
avail themselves of the twelve months' credit
secured by law. to pre-emptors of lands subject
to private entry. It Is believed, therefore, that
settlers hive suffered no serious hardships.-
Owing to the slight demand for lands as an in
vestment, the'cosh receipts from the public
sales have been inconsiderable, when compared
witb-the quantity of land offered..
Experience has demonstrated the wisdom
and. proprietv of the recommendations coh
‘tained in mvlast annual report: first, that, in'
a spirit of liberality to all settlers upon unof
feredlahds, two years should be allowed, from
the date of settlement, within which to moke
proof and payment; and, second, that it Should'
be made' incumbent upon the Executive to
offer at public sale, by proclamation, within
two yean after survey, all 4hc lands that baye
not been claimed by settlers..
The income from the pnblic lands during four
yean past has not been so'great as was ex
pected. The commercial 'revulsion ot 1857,-
followcd as It was by short' crops -In most of
the new States and Territories, checked immi
gration,-and also the inclination of capitalists
to make further. investments.' .Bat this is not
I the sole cause .of reduction la this revenue
1 The manner of disposing of the public lands !
hag bees mad© a topic or political discussion;
and, whilst some emigrant families have made
• settlements and delayed giving the proper no
tice, or making any payments, In tbe'expect*- "
. tlon of a donauon, other persons, who arc con
templating emigration, have .deferred their re
moval from their old homes and the purchase
r ot lands for settlement, awaiting some definite
legislation upon the subject- Should'the dis
, cession of alterations in our land system
cease, it is believed that* the* revenue derived
from sales would speedily rise'to treasonable
aim m 3 average, especially if the quantity of.
unlocated land warrants outstanding should
continue to diminish from year to year as for
three years past.
: The -general interest felt In this work;- and
1 the Importance of the nearest possible ap
proach to accuracy In all Ua details, have been
properly appreciated by this department; and
It Is hoped that the energy and care with which
it has been wilt insore results in
accordance wiQffhc publlcexpcctaliorL

For the completion of the eighth census, the.
sum bf (437,000, os a deficiency, will bc requlr
cd fdr the current .fiscal year, and.a further ap-.
propHation of 1100,000, for the fiscal year end-,

tion j about (1,642,000, of which sum about
51,303,000 will be paid -for -the marshals and
tiieiri assistants, in accordance with the rates
established by the law of 1850, for their ser
viced in this connection.
The sum demanded for the execution of the
eighth census exceeds the cost of the seventh
in the sum of s2ls,ooo—an excess rendered
necessary by the. increase of oor population
and its diffusion over the vast plains of the In
terior. ; •
Ini this, my last annual report, I feel it to be
my duty to suggest the propriety and impor
tance of establishing a bureau of statistics.
The Internal trade between the different
States of this Union is greatertban onrforcign
trade, and. directly interest! a much greater
.' number of our own people, yet we possess no
agency by which ascertain and defi
nitely present to the world the value and ex
tehtjof this exchange of the products of labor.
IVe have no central point of statistical knowl
edge by which we con show the connection
and! dependence of the several States upon
each other for their material advancement and
prosperity. It is trad tbattofice in each period
of tqn years the country is. supplied with cer
tain} information regarding: our agricultural,
manufacturing and mining interests; yet noth
ing [s known of the importance, direction, and
the channels of onr home commerce. Con
gress, the departments and the community ore
without any general reliable resource for the
ascertainment of onr internal trade and tbe
annual productions of agriculture, manufac
tures and mines. It would be a wise economy
to establish an agency which would secure the
desired information In the most authentic,
practicable form, and regularly report the
same at each session of Congress. - The requi
site force would be small, and I feel confident
that tbe reports of snch a bureau would com
mand for it the public favor.
Some changes in the laws arc required, to
enable this department to secure uniformity
and to enforce, existing regulations in regard
to judicial expenses of tbe government, and 1
renew my former recommendation on this sub-,
jeet. Without some additional power, prompt
itude and accuracy In the return of the emolu
ment accounts of the clerks of the United
States courts cannot be secured.
FOBIOSS.
I refer yon to the rq»ort of the Commission
er of Pensions for information in'respect to
the operations of tbe Pension Bureau for the
post year.
The whole; number of pensioners of. all
classes now remaining bn the • roils is 11,281,
and the sum required to pay their pensions is
$1,001,018,95. During the lust year the amount
thus expended was $1,103,902.03.
Although there appears to have been but a
slight diminution in the work of the office,
yet such is the condition of the business that
ft will admit of a considerable reduction of the
clerical force during the next year, and, conse
quently, the estimates now submitted for this
branch of the service have been reduced by the
sum of $28,200. •
The energetic measures which have been
adopted- for--the prevention of • pension and
bounty land frauds upon the
have been attended with very favorable results,
•as is clearly indicated by the decrease in the
number of prosecutions lor offenses of this
character. ‘
•PATEST OFFICE.
The increase of business in the Patent Office,
■and the magnitude of its operations, give addi
tional force to the recommendations hereto
fore made for a reorganization of this bureau.
The amount of work devolving upon the ex
aminers is enormous, and it 4s difficult to be
- Hcve that the reiterated appeals in this behalf
would have been so entirely disregarded, bad
Congress'realized the actual condition of fhc
business of the office; and as the office Is self
-1 sustaining, it is .only reasonable that this.de
partment should-be empowered to graduate
the force-employed, by tbio work to be done,
provided,'always, that the expenditures'shall
be kept within the receipts.
I hike the . occasion to renew, the recoin-,
nicudation of the previous reports in regard
to the tmoffioly of allowing appeals from the
Commissioner of Patents to one of the three
District Judges. .In , addition to the reasons
urged in my lirst annual for an altera
tion of the law in this particular, it Is to be ob
served that, as each Judge acts separately upon
the appeal taken, it becomes very difficult,-if
not impossible, to.maintain the uniformity
aiid certainty in the execution of the patent
laws.
Tho income of the offle for the three quarters
ending September, SO, JBCO, was $107,648.40,
and its expenditure, 180,672.23, showing a sur
plus of $7,996.17,
• Durin this period, five thousand six hundred
and thirty-eight applications- for patents Lave
been received, and eight hundred and forty-one
caveats filled.;Three[thoaiand’eixhuDdred and
twelve applications have been rejected, and
three thousand eight (hundred and ninety
six patents issued, including rc-lssucs, addi
tional improvements und deslgns. In addition
to this, there have been forty-nine applications
for extensions,' and twenty-eight patents have
been expended for a period of sevcnycars from
t bo expiration of their first term.
AGRtCCLTCKE.
This is one of the main pillars of tho pros
perity and power of any- country, aud it as
sumes additional Importance in oars because
of the extent of Our territory, embracing every
variety?of soil and climate,' the cbcapucss.of
land, and the facility with which. its products
can be transported to market The liberal ap
propriations made by Congress at Us last scs
»iou,'in encouragement of this most useful art,
received the cheerful sanction of the people,
aud this department has labored faithfully to
carry on£ the beneficient instructions of Con
gress. Diligent enquiry has been marie for tbc
varieties of seeds and cuttings of every useful
plant£and vegetable, and satisfactory arrange
ments have been made for procuring them ou
the best terms and transporting them in the
safest manner. It is.manifest that, when wc
have rccicvedan. adequate supply of the differ
ent plants and seeds adapted to onr agricultu
ral resources, by the judicious supplication of
the results of scientific investigations, the
United States must become the grancry of the
world.
DE6MOINES .AND FOX RIVER. IMPROVEMENT.
By an act of Congress, approved August 8,
1 '*-40, a grant of lands was made to the State of
lowa for the Improvement of the navigation
of the Desinolnos River, from Ks mouth to the
Raccoon Fork. This grant, for more than two
years, was regarded on all hands as confined
to the line of improvement, and limited to the
lands along the river* and below, the Ractoon
Fork; and'this view of the matter has been
maintained by the Department of tbc Interior
and by the General Land Office. The quantity
of land thus admitted .to hc.within the grant
was found to be 322,392 acres, and was long
since listed and approved to the State.
Secretory Stuart, however, caused some of
the lands along the .river and above the Rac
coon Fork to be listed and ccatillcd, as part of
the grant, and a list was also approved by Sec
retary McClelland, before his attention was
questions of law involved in a claim which
had been presented on behalf of the State, in
1849, that the grant extended to the headwa
ters of the Dcsmolcefirirer.

Court of the-United States at the December

lands, and that the lists and certificates which
bad been Issued from this department convey
ed no title to thc.Statc. Thc_ quantity pflaad

When I came into office the grant to Wis

settled. My predecessor, a few weeks before
that’ period, .made a decision according to
• which the quantity of this grant, under all the
laws upon the subject,'was ascertained to be

in exeess'ofthis' quantity, and the selections

on the charge of having for some time past
engaged In the work or propagating abolition
sentiment among the other free negroes and
the slaves of this city. Another free negro
and a slave, arrested with him, were dismissed
upon a preliminary exaittis&ion before Mayor
Monroe. Under a provision of the black code,
Jcnninss is committed for a -full examination
before Recorder Emerson. Joinings has lived
hero long, and . bis rectitude in politics is

acted rascally in some financial dealings with
white men, and as Chief McClelland arrested
him upon what he considered good evidence
of his incendiary disposition, ills not certain
that he will not he found out to be one of the
worst and most dangerous incendiaries that
we could possibly have In bur midst.
There is and has been for some time much
talk and excitement among bur German popu
lation, regarding some of their countrymen
iw hose antecedents arc not calculated to benefit
them la so warm a latitude os this. We have
already mentioned the disappearance of one
Fucrster, an aitaehi of one of the German pa
pers, in consequence of notifications be bad re
ceived, touching bis abolition sentiments. We
may here, add, In Justice to the paper with
which he was connected, that he was dlschare

we do not speak or understand the German
‘ language, we have small opportunity of post
ing ourselves os well os we would like to, con
cerning the excitement which has been rife
among our German fellow-citizens. '
One case which Is now the talk. Is the affair
of Julias Rcidcl and Simon Hoosemann. Kel
del is a co-manog’cr of the German theatrical
company which, has been playing at Concert
Hall on Poydras street. Houscmann Is mana
ger of the other theatrical company which has
been playing at the Orleans Theatre. The ri
valry of the; men as managers, so we hear it,
lias led to an Inspection of their respective an
tecedents, and stories have got abroad that
Keitlel Is a rank Abolitionist, having mode
Black Republican speeches to Germans at the
North. Keldel denies this; and in support of
this he lias hod Hoosemann arrested as the
propagator of the stories, his allegation being
that these stories put bis life In danger. On
the simple charge of “breach of the peace,” a
warrant was issued by the Second District Re
corder for Honsemonn’s arrest, and House
maun, hearing of this, went yesterday to court
and surrendered himself, and gave bail to ap
' pear for examination when notified.
• An exciting affair came off at the St. James
Hotel oa Magazine street, last evening. One
Lav! Harris, a traveling agent for some large
business Uuusc in Philadelphia, stopping at the
hotel, was indiscreet • enough to vaunt his
Black Republican sentiments. The news of
this spread. A committee of citizens looked
around for him yesterday, but did not find
him. In the evening, however, he was found
at the hotel, and was at once seized and taken
to his room and questioned at length. The
evidence of his abolition language was strong
against him, aud it was determined to send
him forthwith to some more congenial latl
tude.
Haring the inquisition, a large and excited
crowd collected around the hotel, probably
with tho view of lynching him. The men who
laid him in charge, discovering this, and not
wishing any. harm done to him, smuggled him
out: by the back way, put him into a carriage,
and sent him off at top speed to the Jackson
Railroad Depot. He had no money, bnt a
druggist of this city loaned-him SIOO to pay
bis traveling expenses. .We did not bear
whether he reached the depot in time for the
.cart or not.

i • MOSS ABOLITION EXCITEMENT. -
Yesterday morning Arthur Robinson, a man
of genteel appearance and education, was ar
rested by Corporal Dean and the Slayer’s spe
cial officer, T; TL Dryden, • at the request of
two citizens, and brought to the Mayors office,
ou jthe charge of entertaining Abolition senti
ments and expressing the came In public.
The accused is a native of Ireland,: and came
to the United States In l&L Ho remained in
New York until 1850, and has since been living
iu this city.' He stated to the Mayor that he
waf decidedly adverse to slavery and wanted to
>ec it abolished at os early a day as practica
ble, by lawful means; that be did not contem
plate doing anything wrong, bnt he could not
help giving utterance to his feelings, la reply
to .the Mayor’s questions, he acknowledged
that he had conversed on the subject with tree
negroes,but wonldnot state positively whether
or not he had spoken to slaves. . .
The Mayor committed him for farther ex
amination before the Recorder. Wc beard of
this man several weeks ago, as being in the
habit of receiving through the Post Office
packages and bundles of Abolition papers and
other documents, which, being much more
than he could have any occasion to read him
selT, he must have circulated in an incendiary
minuet.
Another case was brought before the Mayor
yesterday morning. Two gentlemen arrived
last evening from Pass Christian, having in
charge a man with his wife and child, and
handed the following letter to tbc Mayor:
Thomas Gay, having beeu convicted of being an
Abolitionist, by the citizens of the town of Pass
Christian, and by them sentenced tobe transported
to n free State, be is now In the bands of Messrs.
F. !T. Bcrean and L. D. Smith, with instructions to
carry him to New Orleans, and there to be handed
over to the Chief of Police, with the request that
lie-will be forwarded to a free State. He has been
provided withsndldcnt means to defray his and

Yesterday afternoon the Mayor's special offi

Uw-t evening the captain and clerk, of the

to’ render answers thereto, which may or may
not affect their prospects of business in this

The Southern Rights Vigilance Committee —
Tor such a body exists and has, cvcrsincejthe

of the most respectable andrcsponslble men of
this city. Their business is to purge the com
munity of “bad eggs,” not by violence, or by
afiy harsher measure than that of inviting said
*» eggs” to leave, showing them to the earliest
channels of migration, and giving them money
to travel with should they be short of the nec
essary money in these stirring times.

statement of the itai/y i/rra/(l(pub!L»hcdbere;
in reference to one of our prominent and en
terprising citizens.:.. •
A. C. EllitUorpe,. Esq., the inventor of the
celebrated* quartz crushers and pulverizers,
leaves by express this morning ou business
East. He purposes to be back iu a short time.
Ibis gentleman, during the last few months,
has fully set at rest any doubts that existed in
regard to tho success of his quartz machinery,
which is undoubtedly the most economical
quartz mill yet introduced into this country,
lie bos also examined the various ores of the
Rocky Mountains, and made numerous experi
ments, which we expect will be beneficial to
the manufacturing interest of this country tre
lung, and wc doubt not, profitable to those
who may Invest their capital in the pioneer re- .
searches and manufactories of our land.
A train of lifty-two wagons, loaded with
flour, groceries and. provisions, for-Ab-x. Ma
jors, of this city, and a quartz-mill fur panics
in the mountains, arrived on Saturday evening.
There have been severe storms ou the
i plains and a heavy fall of snow, obstructing
the progress of several trains on their way to
this point, heavily ladcu with all kinds of mer
chandise. The loss of stock during the last
month has.bcca considerable. The high price
of hay, and provender of all kinds, has been
the cause. Cattle, are cheap, *aud it seems to
be considered economy on the part of 100
many of our stock owners to let their cattle
perish for the want of food, rather than pay
at the rate of S4O to SSO ti ton for hay, and SO
to $lO a bushel for com to feed them with.
While iu the mountains a ten* weeks since,
I learned that therewas'a company formed to
start Immediately on the receipt of expected*
intelligence for the San Joan mines iu New
Mexico. They had sent on parties to prospect
tho country, and if I* proved us rich as report
ed, one of them was to return to the moun
tains and notify the others, and they were to
leave linmcdlacely.-
A few days since the expected messengers re
turned with the results of their prospecting,
tour, which they refused to commiuur.ite to
outsiders. Suffice it to say that,notwithstand
ing the two feet of snow Iu tho mountains, the
company, with one exception, started immedi
ately in a southerly direction. The single ex
ception was a gentleman well known in this
vidnity. He was here In town, and from the
company he received a note, which I lave been
permitted to sec. In which arc these words:
•• Mr. returned last eve. San J uau all
right—rich. We leave this moniiug; hurry on
and overtake us. Mum.U the wof»L”
Soon alter the receipt of the above the gen
tleman suddenly disappeared, and the pre
sumption is, he Is now tn route to overtake his
companions. ‘‘Mum is the word,” a very
ominous suggestion. Parties arc leaving every
week for the San Juan mountain*, but not a
word of information respecting the mines of
any value cau be obtained from them; their
movements arc conducted with secrecy; they
consider silence upon what they intend to do,
preferable to a public exposition.
A gentleman who left this city a few days
since with a parts, and went south through the
snow, told me that if he should publish all he
knew about the San Juan mines, this city
would soon become depopulated. Said he, **i
shall shirt immediately -noiwiilisUuiding the
storm and snow,that b all I can say about the .
Son Juan mines,” and he Is now i/i route, en
countering all the difficulties of travel at this
season of the year, with the ground covered
with snow. They arc camping out these bit
ter cold nights. * Surely they illustrate tl:tir
faith by their work*.
The weathe *, for a few days jm-»t has been
rather pleasant, ami our people have taken ad
vantage of It—many of them for their £r»t
sleigh-ride at Pike's Peak. The sleighs are of
rather odd patterns, hastily constructed and
known as jumpers : wheels have been moved
from light vehicles and put ou runners extem
porized for the great occasion.
The “Provisional Government” has been In
a sitting posture forsomo time in this city,
“waiting for something to turn up. Anxiously
expecting a quorum to enable the machine to
run, they have called upon their friends to rally
round it, but nary a friend. Like Mahomet,
they called the mountain, but the mountain
would not come ; so they go to the mountain.
After remaining here lor several days, they
at lost concludwTto adjourn to Golden City,
where they, say they “have friends.” The
friends would not come, so they go to them. *
Parties at Omaha, Nebraska, look tho con
tract to print and bind the Laws of the “ Pro
visional Government of Jefferson Territory.”
which they have found to be a bad job. and
bare the worthless mass upon their hands,
with no one to furnish sufficient money to
remove the trash from the printing office to
this city.
