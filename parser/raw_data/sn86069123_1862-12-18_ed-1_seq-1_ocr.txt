The Dome of the Capitol The mag
nificent dome of the capitol. designed by
Thos. V. Walter, and now in course of con
struction under his direction, is rapidly pro
gressing to completion. The principal frame
has been completed, the ribs put in place,
and the outer plating is being finished.
After this is done, nothing will be left to
complete the exterior of the dome but the
construction of the lantern and the placing
of tbo ornaments on the upper windows and
around the spring of the cupola. The cast
ings for the inner dome are in course of
preparation, and will soon be ready. The
bight of the iron work above the basement,
including the statue, will be 285 feet. The
whole quantity of iron received from the be
"innin" of the" work up to the present time
was about 7,500.000 pounds, and 800.000
more will be needed. The dome will be
crowned with Crawford's gigantic acd im
posiDjj 6tatue of freedom, which is nineteen
and a'balf feet-bigb, and weighs 15.000 lbs
The entire cost of the statue was $25,000.
"The cost of the dome and statue together,
when completed, will be about $900,000.

Effects.
The excitement of the public mind, for a
long period preceding the recent elections,
was such, that it would have attempted
boldly to combat the errors and designate
the crimes which have been committed by
the Abolition party since the fourth of
March, 1861. There is a time when the
discussion of principles and the denunciation
of abuses may do much good, by enlighten
ing and instructing the minds of those whose
mistaken views are the result of ignorance
or want of due reflection. But when passion
sways the heart and masters the intellect,
every barrier which is interposed, or obstruc
tion which is thrown in the way of its on
ward course, only serves like those opposing
forces of nature which cause the faarfut
mn-lstrom of Norway to lash its victim into
fury and madness. The unconstitutional,
arbitrary and most wicked arrests, which
have been made by the Abolition Govern
ment throughout the Eastern and Vestern
States together with the equally atrocious
suspension of that noble writ, which was de
signed to defeat the mal'gnity of tyrants,
may, and doubtless has operated to silence
many a voice whica would otherwise have
been hcaid in tones of eloquent patriotism
pleading the cause of our sorrowing, bleed
ing country. But it would be a melancholy
and most humiliating reflection, that among
thirty millions of people so few found who
dared to protest in the name of God and of
humanity, against the unconstitutional and
tyranical acts of the administration, because
they feared to maketsuch protest. That the
silence of our political writers and others,
was not caused by fear of personal conse
quences, but by the belief that the time had
not yet arrived when the cold, calm voice of
. . ! .1 I. 1 . 1 . i. : . r . l i r
reason could be heard, the writer of this arti
cle.is well assured, and lie is equally well
convinced, that the time has at length come
when every man will bo heard who speaks
boldly and earnestly in defense of his opin
ions and in condemnation of tyranny, re
gardless of the source from whence it may
proceed. It is an extraordinary fact one
which has no parallel in history, that the
terrible war in which we have been engaged
for the last nineteen months, has notshaken I

I talk the nature of our State and federal sys

and upon whom it has eonfprrnd snHi hlnsa-
as men never before derived from gov-
ernments, who have failed failed in adher-
ence to its principles, and thereby failed in
their duty to themselves and to the world,
There never has been a time since the
Federal Constitution went into operation, in
which the Goverr.ment having been admin
j istered in the spirit and according to the
true ir:tei.t and meaning 01 tile bond by
which it was created, did not afford fuli,
adequate and complete protection to every
citizen, and at the same time command the
respect and admiration of the world; while

and uselulness in ai! the estates wuicn remain
under the old flag
The foregoing remarks I have deemed
necessary before proceeding 10 discuss, ac
cording to my design, the present war, as a
constitutional measure and its effects upon
the country. In the convention which
formed the Federal Constitution. Edmund
llan&olph.of Virginia, introduced a resolu
tion, which he desired to incorporate into
that instrument, authorizing the Govern
ment, in the event that a Slate, or any body
of men within a S'ae. should resist the laws
of the United States, to ca'l from the re
maining Srates a force sufficient to over
come such resistance and compel obedience.
Ou a succeeding day, Mr. Paterson, of New
Jersey, offered a similar resolution, though
couched in diff-rent language; indeed, it is
somewhat, remarkable, that the language of
Mr Lincoln's first proclamation, in April.
1861. is almost word for word with that of
Patterson's resolution. These resolutions
were considered by the Convention, in the
order of their introduction, and having been
deb ited bv Alexander Hamilton. Jas. Madi
son, George Mason and Luther Martin, all
of whom bitterly opposed their adoption, on
the ground that they were repugnant to the
principles of the proposed government,
destructive to the sovereianty of the States
and calculated to weaken the general sys
tem, were rejected by the votes of all the
members, save those by whom they were of
fered. It is, therefore certain, that what
ever opinion we may entertain of the power
of the government under the Constitution, to
make 'war upon disobedient or seceding
States, no such idea existed, either in the
minds of the movers in the foregoing resolu
tions, or in those of the remaining members
of the Convention, otherwise their rejection
would not have been placed upon grounds
antagonistic to the grant of such power, as
was sought to be conferred upon the Gov
ernment by implication; but on the contrary,
it can only be exercised by subverting the
Constitution 4and disregarding its plainest
and most important principles, as I shall pro
ceed to show. It will be observed, first:
That the Government of the United States is
purely federal, both in form and substance.
By which I mean, Ihat it derives its au
thority from the written agreement of sover
eic States who have r.ot thereby relinquished
any portion of their sovereignty. It is so in
form; because the President is chosen by
electors, selected by. and representing their
several States, as distinct and seperate com
munities; because the Senate and lower
branch of Congress are In like manner com
posed of representatives from the several
States, and are not taken from greater and
less districts, carved out of the whole terri
tory of the Union; and lastly, because the
Supreme Court, although chosen by the
President and Senate, possesses a separate
and independent jurisdiction within each
State. It is so in substauce; because, al
though the Government exercises Certain
dowers over the citizens of each State, it
does so, by virtue of the same authority. tre-
cisely, through which theState governments
execute their functions, viz: By the con
sent of the people within each State,sepa
raieiy given. In other words, both the
Federal and State sovernments derive their
authority wMin each State, from the people
thereof, and according to the theory which
formerly obtained in this country, are noth
ing more than agents of the people in each
State. That this ida may be rendered per
fectly plain it is only necessary td remem
ber that neiiherthe P&lerat nor Slate govern-
tnents are sovereign, hut the sovereignty resides
with the people hy whom those governments tdcrt
created. Now, by whom was the Federal
Government invested with the sovereign
powers, which it exercises within the limits
of Pennsylvania? Certainly by the people
of that State alone, for if they had refused
to adopt the Federal Constitution, it would
have heen inoperative within that Stite.
even though It had received the unanimous manded as a right that they should be per
vote of the people in every other State. J mitted to force upon the agrrcultural States,
Nor does the fact of the other States having j the products of their factories at their own
in like manner, as Pennsylvania, adopted prices, by means of tariffs excluding com -
the same common acent, render the instru-
ment creating such agent any more the great
work of a united people, than if each of the
States had adopted for itself the same form
of State government established by the
others. It is folly to contend that the peo
ple of any State ever empowered an agent
of their own creation to make war upon
themselves. Again, the Federal Govern
ment possesses no powers except those grant
ed to it in the Constitution. This limita
tion of power would be wholly inoperative
and the Constitution itself a useless instru
ment, if the Government, notwithstanding
the limitation, can enforce its laws within a
disobedient State by calling out the mi'itary
power of the remaining States. Such a con
struction takes from the States the right to
rpsist ii nronstitnf ional lpvi.4l.1t ion . and makes
,he Federal Government" the sole judge of
tne PXtent. of its own rowers, thereby placing
the people of each State at 'he mercy of a
Government of their own creation. Can any
one belipve that snch a folly was committed
by the Convention or sanctioned by the peo
ple of he States? The burden of proof lies
: upon those who make the assertion, and the
evidence is altogether against them. I have
said, and will now proceed to show, that
war against a State can only be prosecuted
"bv subverting the Constitution and disre
garding its plainest and most important
principles. For this purpose the Adminis
tration has furnished tha evidence.
First. The President, by increasing the
armv and navy of the United States, by call
ing large numbers of men into the land and
naval service, and calling forth the militia
without the authority of Congress, has vio
lated tho 8?h Section of the 1st Arlicla of
the Constitution.
Second The Southern ports have been
blockaded in violation of the treaties with
foreign nations, and of the 9th Section of
article 1st of the Constitution.
Third. The writ of hnbea scorptts has been
suspended by the President in violation of
the 9th Section of Article 1st of the Consti
tution. Fourth. Illegal searches and seizures
have been made under the authority of the
President, both of persons and property, in
the "loyal" States, in violation of the 4th
Article of the Amendments to the Constitu
tion. F-fth. Congress has passed a law for the
corfi-cation of S u thern property, which has
been approvd hy the President, in viola
tion of the 9th Suction of Article 1st, the
3 1 Sc. of Article 3d of the Constitution, and
the 5th Article of Amendments to the Con
stitution. Sixth. The President has issued a proc
lamation of freedom to the slaves within
certain States, and has invited them to en
gage in servile insurrection, in violation of
every dictate of humanity, precept of re
ligion, and of all the principles of the Con
stitution. Seventh. The Government of the United
States, for the purpose of supporting the ex
penses of the war, has issued its notes and
forced them into the currency of the conn
try as one of our standards of value, against
the policy of all civilised nations, and with
out the authority of the Constitution.
Other instances might be given in which
the Constitution has been setaside and wholly
disregarded in the prosecution of the present
war against the South, as much as declara
tions made by leading members of the Aboli
tion party, that even :o name the Constitu
tion in connection with the war was treason
to the country. But those which 1 have enu
merated, are surely sufficient to satisfy eve
ry reasonable man that the Administration,
by its own acts and confessions, has been
unable to prosecute the war without tramp
ling upon that instrument. I come now to
consider the effects or consequence of the
war. I have said in another place, that the
disolution of the Union was not caused by
inherent defects in the Constitution, but that
it was ciused by repeated attempts made in
our section of the country, to enlarge the
powers of the General Government, and
thus contract those of the States, more than
was lawful, equitable or wise. To those
who are familiar with American history, it
is well know that much jealousy and bitter
ness of feeling existed among the colonies,
long anterior to the revolution of 1776, and
this feeling especially prevailed between the
colonies North and South. Dr. Franklin,
whose political sagacity will not be denied,
having watched this feeling with much in
terest, and with aa earnest desire to restore
harmony, only two years before the "Dec
laration of Independence" expressed the con
viction that the ha&d of God alone could
unite such discordant elements. Fifteen
years thereafter, when the Constitution was
submitted to the several State Conventions
for ratification, we fiod from Elliots's de
bates that similar feelings of distrust, jeal-
ousy and suspicion were exhibited by the
members both in speeches and resolutions.
Notwithstanding the existence of this feel
ing, the Constitution was adopted, and mat
ters went on smoothly enough until the pass
age of the Alien and Sedition laws, during
John Adanis' administration. Those laws
excited much dissatisfaction in the South,
and were warmly defended by the North.
Next came the war with Great Britain of
1812, and the proceedings of the Hartford
Convention, which included all the New
England States. Those proceeding were
certainly not calculated to promote harmony
among the States. The foregoing were
however, but trifling causes of discontent,
and time would soon have healed them had
not a new and far more dangerous cause of
dissension been thrown into the cauldron, in
the "protective policy,' or "American sys
tem," as it is sometimes called. This self
ish, wicked, and unconstitutional measure
has been the fruitful source of "all our
woes." In 1815 it was prayed for by the
New England manufacturers As a favor, to
be granted to them for three years, during
which time they supposed that, aided by
the new tariffs of 25 per cent, they would
be enabled to get rid of their manufacturing
capital without material loss. In 1820, 182-1,
! 1X32 and even aftarwarda. thev dp.
petition from other lands. These demands
' were as strenuously resisted by the South
as thev were warmly urged oy iNew ting
land, and ultima'elv the Western States
threw their weight into the scale with the
South. The coalition between the New
England manufacturers and the Abolition
ists, commenced at this period, and has ever
since been maintained. It was necessary to
wean the West from the South, otherwise
the selfish schemes of New England must
fail, and as this could not be affected by ap
peals to the interest of the former, resort
must be had to passion, prejudice, hatred, all
of which may be summed up in the one
word, Abolitionism. Who is there, among
our old citizens, who doesnot remember the
time when the Western mails were filled
with newspapers, pamphlets, fcc, represent
ing the "poor negro" under the lash of his
cruel master, who, being unable to work him
in factories, was determined that nobody
else should engage in those healthful, pleas
ant and profitable employments? And who,
again, is there among U3, who does notkuow
the many years which have been employed
in disseminating abolitionism among our
people, and in traducing the South through -out
the world by pulpit orators, lecturers,
school teachers, and through the instrument
ality of school books, tracts, newspapers,
pamphlets, books of fiction, books of travel,
and even of history? Earnest, persistent,
and long continued labor, whether directed
to a good or evil purpose, will always make
its impression upon society. The mass of
the people had neither time nor inclination
to inquire into the true condition of the
Southern slave, or to investigate the ques
tion of his capacity for Improvement under
another system than that which had beeu
applied to him at the South. Others, who
had time and opportunity for such investiga
tions, regarded the subject with indifference,
as one with which they had no practical con
nection, except as it affected our local pol
itics. It was easier, and sometimes more
profitable, to assume as true, what the Aboli
tionist said, than to make the inquiry ne
cessary to expose the falsehoods and errors
which were propagated by him. We have
the fruits of abolition Zeal unopposed by
truth, in a broken Union, a terrible war, and
a ruinous debt. The Contest in regard to
the Territories would never have been
made, but for the determination of the Abo
lition party to influence and embitter the
minds cf the people North and South against
each other, under the Vain and silly pretence
that the South, with one-third the popula
tion of the North, if permitted to takdslaveS
into the territories would convert them into
Slave States, to the eXclus'on of free labor.
And if such contest had by chance arisen, it
could easily have been disposed of by means j duct of some of our Generals, and our own
of the Crittenden Compromise, which gave j liberties taken away under the false plea of
to the North two-thirds of the territory ab-j a war necessity You, Mr. Editor, know

the United States, iu common with the
North, rather than which, that party pre

restored by war. That Abraham Lincoln, (
his Cabinet or his party, ever believed that '
war could restore the ancient Union of the
States, that Union which our fathers made,
and which was the source of all our pros
perity and greataess as a nation, cannot be
credited by any sane man. That they
did believe that the Southern States could
easily be conquered, reduced to a state
of vassalage, and compelled
to submit to

customed to raise their own provisions,
which has been hitherto supplied by the
West, with but few manufacturing establsh-
ments. and having withal, a large negro
population in their midst, who, it was fondly
hoped bv the amiable Seward, Thurlow
Weed and their followers, would, when the
husbands, fathers and sons, were away to
the war with their white foes, comme
nee the)
work of death and dishonor in their homes,
upon defenceless women and children. Is
it wonderful, that such men should have
deemed it an easy task for the powerful
.North, with us vast internal resources, its
ports open to the world, and assisted by a
powerful navy, to crush out and destroy a
foe thus situated? They did believe it, and
from the commencement of the war Besom
ed the tone of conquerors, instead of the
conciliatory tone of men who were bent on
restoring the ancient Union. At first it was
hard to persuade the Abolition Administra
tion that it was not politic td piit to death
as traitors, the prisoners of war taken from
the South; it was harder still to procure an
exchange of prisoners, and ithas been hither
to impossible to convince this same admin
istration that the principles of war recognised
among all civilized and christion nations,
should be observed in the contest With the
Southern States' principles which were only
designed to ameliorate the horrors of war,
and prevent useless cruelty, and the recogni
tion of which would have Saved the people
of the Hortti and West from the shame and
humiliation which they must ever experi-
ence, when the names of Butler, "the beast,'
of Turchin, "the brute," of Pope, the en
courager of rapine and theft, of McNeil, the
murderer, and of others of less note, are
mentioned in their presence. The South
can, and shall be conquered, said the Aboli
tion Administration, and to effect this end,
it assumed, and still holds, a doable, and
most ridiculous attitude before the nations
of the world. It cloims, at one and the same
time, all of the rights which appertain to a
nation engaged in war with a foreign nation,
and all, and more than all, the rights, witbio
the seceding States, of a government over its
own subjects. According to Mr. Lincoln,
the Confederate States constitute a nation
"de facto" for blockading purposes, and for
the exchange of prisoners of war, while the
people of these States are subjects of the
Federal Government, and therefore liable to
have their property confiscated, and their
slaves liberated by law. A great absurdity
than which, can not well be imagined, or
one less likely to be tolerated by foreign na
tions, as we shall soon discover when these
conflicting claims are to be discussed. When
Fremont was invested with "Proconsular
powers," (I quote from himself,) in Missouri,
he undertook to confiscate property and
liberate slaves by proclamation, but every
one capable of reasoning on the subject, at
tributed bis conduct to the insane folly of a
party despot, whose head had been turned
by his advancement to a position for which
nature had never designed him. Since then
the Government has fallen with deliberation
into the same error, into which its "procon
sul" madly rushed. The war has been
prosecuted for nearly twenty months, and
the South is not yet conquered, nor does
that event seem nearer than it did twenty
months ago. It is not an easy task to sub
jugate a brave, united and determined peo
ple, even with " overwhelming numbers,
backed by a long purse, vast resources, and
stimulated by hatred. Men will not give
up their lives, their honors, their country,
without a struggle, not until they have
hurled every rock, which lies buried in the
soil, at the person of their invaders. The
Southern people have been accustomed to
freedom and they love it! Mr. Lincoln and
his Cabinet should have thought of this be
fore they commenced the war and drove
them to a united resistance. If, however,
the South had been, or shall hereafter be,
conquered, how will it affect us? Will the
Union, the old Union, be restored? I an
s,wer no it ia impossible! The idea is vain
er than a sick man's dream. The lion may,
in the millenium lie down with the lamb,
but the master and the slave can never be
equals. In that event, no voice from the
seceding States will ever again be heard in
the old halls of Congress, demanding an
equality of rights, for its tones mingling with
the rattling of chains, and the clanking of
fetters would sound broken and unnatural.
Republican government in the North
Despotism in the South! How long would
such a Union last? Which would yield
first to the demand for unity in governments,
the Republic or the Despotism? It be
hooves our people to consider these things.
The effect of the war thus far, has been the
dissolution of the Union, three hundred
thousand men slain in battle, as many more
wounded and broken down with disease, at
least fifteen hundred millions of debt, much
territory laid Waste and property destroyed,

From tha Philadelphia Evening Journal.
Washington Society
The Washington correspondent of the
Ledger says that very few foreign ministers
were present at the opening of Congress
The French and English ministers were
both absent. We see nothing wonderful in
thU. Congress has become such a con
temptible body that even a minister from
Liberia or Hayti might afford to despise it.
Foreign ministers have become so disgusted
with the ignorance, vulgarity and buffoonery
in official circles at Washington that they
have, many of them, removed to New York,
so that they may avoid the necessity of
making mere visits of courtesy to the White
House and to Cabinet officials. They only
encounter our President and Cabinet when
they are compelled to when actual busi
ness requires them to do so. By residing
in New York, they escape the necessity of
attending the State dinners at the White
Hotise, and this, during this Administration,
must be a great relief to any well bred man,
and our own people ought to be thankful
that so few foreign representatives are pre
sent on such occasions to observe the dis
graceful caricaturing of good breeding, and
the ludicrous attempts at style and gentillity
on the part of those who, for the present,
misrepresent the American people.
The change in Washington society is re
marked by all visitors to that city. Butfew
well-bred people, and but few honest peo
ple, are now to be found there. In place of
such, we now see lank, lantern-jawed New
Englanders, many of them of a poor, parson
like aspect in fad'ed black, soiled linen, and
once white choakers, with blue cotton um
brellas, and cheap oil-cloth satchels, half
filled with crackers and cheese. These gen
tlemen are chiefly applicants for chaplain
ships in the army. They wear a very sancti
monious air, rub their hands unctuously to
gether (when they are not engaged with the
cotton umbrellas and the oil-cloth satchels)
roll up their eyes piously, and comb their
hair back of their eyes piously, and comb
their hair back of their ears. A set of mean
er bigots and more profoundignoramusses
could not ba found on the face of the earth.
Another large class of people now in Wash
ington are the contractors and contract-seek:
ers shoddy ites and swindlers generally,
who are too well known to need description
at our hands. Then we have Abolition
emissaries and apostles, of every variety,
who are in Washington to urge extreme
emancipation measures and to pick up what
ever of plunder tney can. These men are
generally the friends and associates of the
Abolition members of Congress, and are of
similar grade in the social, moral and In
tellectual scale. And to these the corres
pondents of the Abolition press, small ped
dlers, and such wretches as Forney, who do
the obsequious for their b-ead and butter,
and you have a tolerable idea of the chief
elements of Washington lociety at present,
so far as the malo sex is concerned. The
females present are, of course, the wives and
daughters of these, and of course are their fit
companions. The sharp-nosed, sharp-voiced
daughters of New England are the ruling
spirits at present. They all spell cow
k-e-o-w, and pronounce it accordingly, and
express wonder in such terms as, "Now, I
want to know!" "Du tell!" etc., and in
variably ask their neighbors "what they bad
to pay" for this or that article of clothing.
If. in the society of a foreign minister and
his lady, these "ladies" would, of course,
ask them the cost of each and every arUcle
of their dress; how much dried apples, and
maple sugar are worth; where they come
from," and how much wages, their kings,
queens and emperors reoeived.
Is it any wonder that foreign ministers did
not attend the opening of Congressthat
they refuse to reside in Washington at this
time.
Look at T'other Side, Jim. When a
boy, as I was one day passing through the
market with my neighbor Joe, I spied a
beautiful orange lying on the top of a bas
ket full of the same fruit I enquired the
price, and was proceeding to buy it, when
my brother exclaimed with e shrewdness
which I shall never forget, 'look at t'other
side, Jim.'
I looked, and to cy'aetonishment it was
entirely rotten.
In passing through life, I have been fre
quently benefited by this little admonition.
When t hear the tongue of slander level
ing its venom against some fault or foible of
a neighbor, I think, 'look at t'other side,
Jim.' Be moderate have charity. Per
haps the fault or foible you talk so much
and so loudly of, is almost the only one in
your neighbor's character, and perhaps yon
have as great, or greater ones of your own.
It may be this is your neighbor's weak
side, and except this he is a good citizen, a
kind neighbor and affectionate father and
husband, and a useful member of society.-
Others may listen to the story of calumny,
but remember, they will fear and despise
the calumniator. Learn to overlook a fault
in your friends for perhaps you may wish
to em to pardon a tai.lt in you,
The President's Message. This dull
stupid, and senseless document will be found
in all its length, breadth, and silliness, on the
odts:de of the Qizette to-day; and we con
fess that we owe an apology to our readert
for having occupied so much of our valuable
space with a document so weak, puerile.And
meaningless.
It is, without dodbt, oae of the most an
surd fallacious, and ridiculous Messages that
has ever yet emanated from any President
of the Uriited States, and altogether unwor
thy of the Executive head of any nation.-
A school-boy of fifteen years would have
produced a more creditable State, paper, in
point of statesmanship, scholarship, or com
mon sense; and, if we mistake not, it will
be the laughing stock of other nations, as it
is of oar own. HilUboro Gazette.

John Van Buren,- speaks of his military
experience as follows:
Now, I never have made any claim to
military experience. To state the matter
as strongly as I Can, I may safely admit
that I am as profoundly ignorant of military
matters as any Brigadier General that ha
been recently appointed.'
