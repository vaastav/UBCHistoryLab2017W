FOLLOWING is the message of
President Wilson delivered at a
joint session of the senate ami j
house at tlie beginning of the j
Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress?Since I
last had the privilege of addressing!
you on the state of the Union the war
of nations on the other side of the sea.
which had then only begun to disclose
its portentous proportions, has extended
its threatening and sinister ^copo
until it has swept within its flame
sonie portion of every quarter of the
globe, nut excepting our own hemisphere,
has altered the whole face of j
international affairs, and now presents |
r~. o m-rtcnwt ?f ro>n > i7.n ri on .qnrl re
construction such as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upou i
to attempt before.
The president tells how this country)
practiced neutrality and declares that
he hopes that when the time comes
for readjustment and recuperation this
country will be of infinite service. Referring
to Central and South American
problems, the president declares that
we should retain unabated the spirit
which has inspired us throughout the
i whole life of our government and
r which was so frankly put into words
by President Monroe.
We have been put to the test in the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test. Whether we have benefited Mexico
by the course we have pursued remains
to be seen. Her fortunes are in
her own hands. Rut we have at least
proved that we will not take advantage
of her in ber distress and undertake
to impose upon her an order and
government of our own choosing. Liberty
is often a tierce and intractable
thing, to which no bounds can be set
and to which no bounds of a few
men's choosing oupht ever to be set.
Every American who has drunk at
the true fountains of principle and tra[
dition must subscribe without reserva
tion to the high doctrine of the Virginia
bill of rights, which in the great
days In which our government was set
up was everywhere among us accepted
as the creed of free men. That doctrine
is, "That government Is or ought
to be instituted for the common benefit,
protection and security of the people,
nation or community;" that "of
all the various modes and forms of
government, that is the best which is
-capable of producing the greatest degree
of happiness and safety and is |
most effectually secured against the
danger of maladministration, and that
when any government shall be found I
inadequate or contrary to these pur
poses a majority of the community

indefeasible right to reform, alter or
-abolish it in such manner as shall be
judged most conducive to the public
weal." We have unhesitatingly applied
that heroic principle to the case
of Mexico and now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic. I
which had so much of which to purge
itself and so little sympathy from any
I outside quarter in the radical but nec- j
essary process. We will aid and befriend
Mexico, but we will not coerce
her. and our course with regard to her!

I PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
Economio Adjustments Inevitable Within
tha Next Generation,
The moral is that the states of America
are not hostile rivals, but co-operating
friends, and that their grow-,
ing sense of community of interest,
alike in natters political and In matters
economic, is likely to give them a
new significance as factors in international
affairs and in the political his
tory of the world. It presents them as
In a very deep and true sense a unit
In world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking together,
quick with common sympathies

they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.

PRESIDENT WILSON'S LATEST
PICTURE.
(From snapshot taken on Nov. 26.)
This is pan-Americanism. It has none j
of the spirit of empire in it It is the j
j embodiment, the effectual embodiment, j
of the spirit of law and independence j
and liberty and mutual service.
Tin-* r^Tv^crirJanf ^allc nttonffon tr> th<* !
I
i meeting In Washington recently of
I representatives of the pan-American
; republics and says that economic adi
justment is inevitable in the next gen!
eration.
No one who really comprehends the
| spirit of the great people for whom we
; are appointed to speak can fail to perI
ceive that their passion is for peace,
: their erenius best'displayed in the prac
j tice of the arts of peace. Great democ|
racies are not belligerent They do not
! R??ek or desire war. Their thought Is
of individual liberty and of the free
{ labor that supports life and the udcensored
thought that quickens it.:
Conquest and dominion are not in our
reckoning or agreeable to our principles.
But just because we demand un-,
molested development and the undisturbed
government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter it may come, the aggression we '
ourselves will not practice. We insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
i chosen lines of national development
We do more tban that. We demand it
also for others. We do not confine our
enthusiasm for individual liberty and
free national development to the incidents
and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wherever
there Is a people that tries to walk
in these difficult paths of independence
and right. From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and have
deemed it as important that our neighbors
should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
1 ' ? ~ J ,7 ?
ue, nave set Aixicinja asiue us a ?ut?c
for the uses of independent nations and
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a people
against aggression. And we are
as fiercely jealous of coercive or dictatorial
power within our own nation
! as of aggression from without We
will not maintain a standing army except
for uses which are as necessary
in times of peace as in times of war.
SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Increase Standing Regular Force?Four
i Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiem.
i
But war has never been a mere matter
of men and guns. It is a thing
of disciplined might If our citizcns
are ever to fight effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves immediately available
and immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant
in this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of |
themselves and of it The military !
arm of their government, which they :
will not allow to direct them, they may I
prdperly use to serve them and make i
their independence secure, and not J
their own independence merely, but i
file rights also of those with whom !
MESSAGE
Declares That if Full Navy Program
Is Carried Out We Will
Have a Fleet For Defense That
Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs
and Worthy of Our Traditions."

I
they hare made common cause, should |
they also be put In jeopardy. They
must be fitted to play the great role
in the world, and particularly in this
hemisphere, for which they are qualified
by principie and by chastened am
bition to play.
It is with these ideals in mind that
the plans of the department of war for
more adequate national defense were
>onceived which will be laid before
you. and which I urge you to sanction |
and put into effect as soon as they can
be properly scrutinized and discussed
They seem to me the essential first
stens. and thor seem to me for the
present sufficient
They contemplate an increase of the j
standing force of the regular army
from its present strength of 5.023 officers
and 102,985 enlisted men of all
services to a strength of 7.136 officers j
and 134.707 enlisted men, or 141.843
ail told, all services, rank and file, by
the addition of fifty-two companies of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en-!
gineers, ten regiments of Infantry, four
regiments of field artillery and four
aero squadrons, besides 750 officers required
for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all important
duty of training the citizen force of ;
which I shall presently speak, 792 noncommissioned
officers for service in

the quartermaster corps, the hospital
corps, the ordnance department and
other similar auxiliary services. These
are the additions necessary to render j
the army adequate for its present duties.
duties which it has to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our interior
army posts, but also in the Philippines,
in the Hawaiian Islands, at the isthmiis
nnd in Porto Rico.
By way of making the country ready 1
to assert some part of its real power j
promptly and upon a larger scale !
should occasion arise the plan also !
contemplates supplementing the army j
by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi- :
zens, raised In increments of 133,000 a
year throughout a period of three '
years. This it is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment under which the !
serviceable men of the country would j
, be asked to bind themselves to serve j

Wltn 1116 colors xui ^uij^voco iiuiu l
! ing for short periods throughout three j
years and to come to the colors at call j
at any time throughout an additional j
"furlough" period of three years. This
force of 400.000 men would be provided
with personal accouterments f*s
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for the field made ready to be supplied
at any time. They would be assem
bled for training at stated intervals at i
convenient places in association with
suitable units of the regular army, j
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months in
the year.
The president says it Is up to the
patriotic young men of the country to
respond to this call.
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
FOR GREATER NAVY.
Always Looked to It as Our First and
Chief Line of Defense.
The program which will be laid before
you by the secretary of the navy
Is similarly conceived. It involves only
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out, but It does make definite and explicit
a Drosram which has heretofore
been only implicit, held in the minds of
the committees on naval affairs and
disclosed in the debates of the two
houses, but nowhere formulated or formally
adopted. It seems to me very
clear that it will be to the advantage
of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency and to press that plan
to completion within the next five
years. We have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and
Una r\f rJof*>nsp: wp have always
seen it to be our manifest course of
prudence to be strong on the seas.
Year by year we have been creating a
navy which now ranks very high indeed
among the navies of the maritime
nations. We should, now definitely de
termlne how we shall complete what
we have begun and how soon.
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
five years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty destroyers.
fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, four gunrmo
hnsnitfll shin two ammuni
U/VtttOf vuv . - - - -
tion ships,.two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It is proposed that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
twenty-five coast submarines, two gunboats
and one hospital ship: the second
year two liattleships, one scout cruiser, j
destroyers, four fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat I
and one fuel oil ship; the third year I
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
submarines and fifteen coast subma*

ship and one fuel oil ship, and
the fifth year two battleships, one battle
cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers.
two fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, one gunboat, one ammunition
ship and one repair ship.
The secretary of the navy is asking
also for the immediate addition to the .
personnel of the navy of 7,500 sailors.
2.500 apprentice seamen and 1.500 marines.
This increase would be suHeient
to eare for the ships which are
ro be completed within the fiscal year
1017 and also for the number of men
which must be put in training to man
the ships which will be completed
early in 101S. It is also necessary that
the number of midshipmen at the Naval
academv at Annapolis should be
increased by at least 300 In order that
the force of officers should be more
rapidly added to. and authority is asked
to appoint, for engineering duties
only, approved graduates of engineer
ing colleges, and for service in the aviation
corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
If this fu?l program should be carried
out we should have built or building in
1921. according to the estimates of survival
and standards of classification
followed by the general board of the
department, an effective navy consisting
of 27 battleships of the first line, 0 i
* ? I ? ? A.U^
battle cruisers, ^.> oauiesmps ui iuc
second line. 10 armored cruisers. 13
scout cruisers. 5 first class cruisers. 3
second class cruisers. 10 third class .
cruisers. 10S destroyers. 18 tieet submarines,
157 coast submarines. (> mon- '
itors, 20 gun'ioats. 4 supply ships, 15
fuel ships, 4 transports, 3 tenders to 1
torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special
types and two ammunition ships, This 1
would be a navy fitted tu our needs j
and worthy of our traditions.
But armies and instruments of war '
are only part of what has to be c n- j
sidered if we are to consider the supreme
matter of national self niflieien- j
cy and security in all its aspects.
There are other great matters which
will be thrust upon our attention \
whether we will or not- There is, for
example, a very pressing question of !
trade and shipping involved in this
great problem of national adequacy.
It is necessary for many weighty reasons
of national efficiency and development
that we should have a great r
merchant marine. The great merchant j
fleet we once used to make us rich, j
that great body of sturdy sailors who 1
used to carry our nag into ever,) ?en,
and wlio were the pride aud often the
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven out of existence by inexcusable
neglect and indifference and by a hopelessly
blind and provincial policy of
so called economic protection. It Is
high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our commercial independence ,
on the seas.
VTitb a view {o meeting thes^e press f
ing necessities of our commerce and
availing ourselves at the earliest possible
moment of the present unparalleled
opportunity of linking the two Americas
together in bonds of mutual inter
est and service, an opportunity which j
may never return again if we miss it j
now, proposals will be made to the!
present congress for the purchase or J
construction of ships to be owned and j
directed by the government similar to i
those made to the last congress, but j
modified in some essential particulars.
I recommend these proposals to you j
for your prompt acceptance with the
more confidence because every month |
that has elapsed since the former proposals
were made has made the ne- '
cessity for such action more and more
manifestly imperative. That need was
then foreseen. It is now acutely felt
and everywhere realized by those for
whom trade is waiting, but who can
find no conveyance for their goods. 1
am not so much interested in the particulars
of the program a3 I am in
taking immediate advantage of the
great opportunity which awaits us if
we will but act in this emergency. In
this matter, as in all others, a spirit of j
common counsel should prevail, and i
out of it should come an early solution
of this pressing problem.

ASHBY DAVENPORT AND 1
WILLIAM SWlTT?N8ERGi
Al'TO CRASHES INTO SEABOARD!
FREIGHT TRAIN.
Accident Occurred on Elmwood lie-!
nue in Columbia EUrly Sunday
3Iorning.
Special to The Herald and News.
Columbia, Dec. 6.?Mr. Asnoy m.
Davenport and Mr. Wm. C. Swittenberg,
both Newberry boys who have
been living in Columbia for the past
several years, met a horrible death at
an early hour on Sunday morning,
when an automobile in -which they
ivoro riflshpd into a freieht train
on the Seaboard Air Line railway
which was crossing Elmwood avenue,
this city. Mr. Swittenberg was instantly
killed, his body being mangled,
and Mr. Davenport died in a very short
time in a local hospital to which he
was rushed in an unconscious condition.
The bodies of the two young men
were taken to Newberry this morning
for interment in Rosemont cemetery
this afternoon.
In the car with Messrs. Davenport
and Swittenberg at the time of the
fatal accident was iMr. J. Frank Falls,
a Newberry boy who has also been
working in Columbia for some time.
The young men lived on Elm wood
avenue, near Main street. . It seems
they had gone up Elmwood across the
Seaboard track, and had turned and
were coming DacK down mmwooa .towards
Main, when they ran into the
train. The testimony at the inquest
was to the effect that the gates had
been lowered upon the approach of
the train, and that the automobile
smashed the gates. The gaies have
red lanterns attached, and the watchman
says these were burning.
A coroner's jury was enpanelled
and the inquest was begun on Sunday
afternoon. Owing to the inability of
Mr. Falls to appear, as a result of the
severe shock which he sustained, the
inquest was adjourned until tonight.
Mr. Falls had a miraculous escape from
death, being thrown from the car and
onLy bruised.
The freight train was north-bound,
and consisted of more than forty cars.The.^
watchman at the crossing says
an automobile which he took to be the
same car that was wrecked a few
minutes later, crossed the track, going
towards Elmwood cemetery, just
ahead of the train, and a few minutes
later smashed into the train on ine
other sidfc of the street. 'The young
men had evidently gone up towards the
cemetery and turned around, and were
coming back down Elmwood to the
home at which they boarded.
Mr. Davenpart represented the Atlantic
Life Insurance company, and
Mr. Swittenberg was bookkeeper for
J. M. Van Metre* Mr. Swittenberg had
worked late on 'Saturday night on his
books, and the supposition is that Mr,
;Davenport had picked him up after the
store had closed.
Messrs. Davenport, Swittenberg,
Falls, and iMessrs. William Scurry and
Roof, Mr. Scurry being also from Newberry
and Mr. Roof being a Newberry
college man, had been rooming at the
same home in the same community
for the past couple of years. They were
- - ? /-i?
all doing well in a business way in Columbia;
and were popular among a
large circle of friends. It was only
on Friday that Mr. Scurry was called 1
to Newberry on account of the sudden'
death of his father. Within the short.
space of forty-eight hours afte had
been cruel to four of the five close
companions.
Messrs. Davenport and Swittenberg,!
-- - - . i
the deceased, were well liked in ousi- j
ness and social circles, and their un-;
timely death was a severe shock. The i
car which Mr. Davenport was driving!
at the time of the accident was an j
Oakland touring car, which he had se- f
cured through an arrangement with!
his company on account oi his increas- I
in? insurance business. Ihey were'
sober and industrious and genial, and
the future was bright for them.
Mr. Swittenberg and Mr. Davenport:
were riding on the front seat of the
/
y
Boys Meet
eath in Capital
automobile at the time of the accident,
with Mr. Davenport at the wheel. Mr.
Falls was in the rear seat. While his
injuries are not serious,-the shock wa^
severe. The train had almost cleared
the crossing when the accident occurred.
I Your correspondent has lived In
, same block with the two young men
! who were killed for the past two ivears.
, 'Coming from the same town, and liv
ing so close togetner in uoiumDia, it
was natural that our .association
should be close, and I feel a sense, of
personal loss in their tragic death. In
a city where speed mania seems to
have seized most of the owners and
! drivers of automobiles, and where the
I regulation and control of motor cars
! has seemed to me sometimes to be al;
most criminally careless, I regarded
I Mr. Davenport as a careful driver, and
was surprised to read in the testimony
at the inquest that he had been fined
j for fast driving a few nights before
the accident. It gives me a great deal
of pleasure to be able to testify for
them that, with all the opportunity I
have had of observing them in Colum- ~~ 1
bia, ther conduct was that of young
gentlemen who were working hard to
establish themselves in the world, and
who were succeeding, quqietly, soberly
and industriousliy.
i
The street along which they were
running is paved, and they were coming
down hill from the cemetery towards
the track.
The Columbia State gives the following
report of the inquest, which was
adjourned over until tonight. '
The Inquest,
S. E. Harmon, M. D., of Columbia
said that he was called about 2 o'clock
Sunday morning to Wayne street\and
Rlmwnrvd avenue, where he foun<l a
wrecked automobile. The train had
gone. Two bodies were lying there,
;\fr. Davenport's being nearest the
railroad track and Mr. SWittenberg's
about 20 feet from the automobile.
Mr. Davenport was still alive, but unconscious.
Mr. Swittenberg was dead.
After examining the bodies Dr. Harman
went with Mr, Davenport to the.
' hospital, where he died not more than
30 minutes after his arrival. Both young
men had injuries about the head that
would be sufficient to cause death.
Mr. 4Swittenberg's legs were crushed
and Mr. Davenport had injuries about
_ the body. 'The wrecked automobile

W36 Standing yaiiiiiCi wnu mc utaboard
tracks, not more than three to
six feet away from the rails, and the
crossing gate on the southwest side
was broken to snlinters according to
Dr. Harmon. He also said that lie
. saw pieces of a broken lantern, but
he didn't notice this especially.
W. E. Fulmer, M. D., who had also
been called to the scene of the acei-*
dent, substantiated what Dr. Hari
?
mon had said.
Eye Witness Examined, ~ i
\ Job Schumpert of 935 G-ervats street,
flagman in the employ of the Seaboard
Air Line railway, who was on
duty Saturday ni?h* at the E'in wood
crossing, testified that an automobile
passed, going westward at about 50
miles an hour. This machine went out
of sight, he said, and just then the
headlight of the extra freight appeared.
He pulled down the gates and rang the
gong. He saw something go up against
the train and he went out to see what
had happened. "What do you all
, mean?" he said he asked of the third
! r^Hjnant of the machine. This was
about 2 o'clock, according to Mr.
Schumpert. He said that there were
red lanterns burning on each of the
frmr eates and he exhibited to the
jury a broken lantern, which he said
was the one that was hanging on the
gate which was smashed in the accident.
When asked how long it was
between the time he saw a machine \
speed out Elmwood and the time of
the accident he said about three minutes.
He would not swear that it was
the same automobile, but said that he
supposed it to be tfte same. Mr.
Schumpert testified that he didn't see
the car on its eastbound trip until he
saw a flash when the machine struck
the train. He declared that the lights
on the crossing gate-s were burning.
The lamp was examined and fc.ird to
