Trains on the Waterbury and Meri
den railroad began running again to
day, after a stop of several years.
This will ba good news for Meriden,
as the inhabitants of fchat isolated
town will now be connected with
hustling Waterbury and its large sub
urban population. The management
should remember the original stock
holders by sending them a mileage
book over the road. The investment
they made would then seem as though
it was bearing some fruit
A Washington correspondent -thus
discusses the president's message, be
fore the rest of us 'have had a chance
to get a glimpse at it: "There is
Uttle or nothing in Mr McKinley's an
nual -message to congress, long as the
document is, -that Indicates with any
OI "certainty, what policy he in
tends to follow towards the Philip
pines. This indicates that he has not
decided upon a policy, or f he has,
that -he is afraid to make it public yet.
and confirms the heHrif
tnmn that lie intends playing foxey on
the Philippine question until atfter -he
gets tiat) treaty of pea, ratified by
the senate and the 120,000,000 whici we
are to pay Spain, appropriated by con
gress. An announcement of a positive
policy . before then might result In
making too many votes against both
treaty and appropriation. Mr Mc
Kinley's handling of the war and mat
ters relating thereto, in his imessajge,
contained no surprises. The message
follows Just about the lines It iwas ex
pected to follow lines plainly indi
cated for wee'ks, aye months, past, by
official and semi-official emanations
from the administration. The mes
sage also indicates very olalnlv that
Mr McKiniey isn't as anxious to push
along financial legislation as some of
the members of his party would like
him to be."
Senator Caffrey of (Louisiana savs
be will oppose the ratification by the
senate of ai treatv uineTiwr
Philippine Islands, but mpon one con
dition would gladly support it-tbat all
the negroes be deported to those
islands and never be allowed to return
to the United States. Mr Caffrey said:
"If the south could Ibe rid of the negro
problem, it -would prosper beyond the
dream of man. "With its great natural
advantages of climate and of soil, with
its coal and iron hidden away in its
mountains and the vast inducements
for capital wbieh it would offer, if the
negro problem was settled, it would
take a great stride forward." Another
senator iwho will oppose the Philip
pine annexation Is Senator Hale, who
makes it plain by his talk that -he in
tends to join Senator Hoar in oppos
ing the ratification of the treaty of
peace, because It provides for United
States ownership of the Philippines.
Whether there are other republicans
wbo will oppose tOie treaty is not pos
itively known, but, unless there have
been some recent changes, tjhere are a
sufficient number of democrats who
will oppose it, to make it almost cer
tain that no attempt will be made to
bring -the treaty to a vote during the
life of this congress. After March 4
it is expected that the required two-
thirds vote can be controlled in the
senate, whicb. can be called in extra
session for the express purpose of dis
posing of be treaty, 'without calling
an extra session of the bouse, II Mr
McKinley so willa it.

Mr McKinley will not lessen bis
troubles by trying to have one tariff
policy for the Philippines and another
for Porto Rico.

The safe that was taken from the
raised Spanish cruiser Maria Teresa,
and which was not opened till yester
day, was found stuffed full of bags of
gold and silver coins. It Is estimated
that the value is $75,000. The amount
might be sent to Spain when we pay
her $20,000,000 (for the Philippines. It
would be real generous-like. Hart

New Britain will ask the legislature
for two favors. One is the appoint
ment of A. F. Bromley as clerk of the
house. The other is the appointment
of Andrew Turnbull to the position of
county corn'missioner. If we can judge
by past experience, the country towns
will say that New Britain wants too
much and then gives us nothing.

Quite a number of years ago, Con
necticut was taken from the republi
can and placed in the democratic col
umn, as the result of a senatorial con
test. Democrats united witb bolting
republicans and elected Hon O. S.
Ferry. The result was a republican
breach which lasted a decade or more.
PerV.rrs history may furnish a profit
able guide for democratic action in
the present senatorial contest.

COUNTRY JUSTICE.
"Worst set-back I ever had," tells an
attorney who does a fine business on
Griswold street, "was years ago to the
western part of the state, shortly after
I had been admitted to the bar. It
was my first civil case, my former ex
perience having been confined ito the
field of asault and battery. One fariner
was claiming $200 damages as the re
sult of a deal he had with a neighbor
and I 'Was for the defendant
"The presiding justice of the peace
was new to his position, but bad all
the confidence of a book agent, and
considered himself a final arbitrator
in all disputes submitted to him. I
had a strong case and, having studied
it days and nights for weeks, never
overlooked a point. The justice, It
seemed to me, did not fairly appre
ciate the importance of the issue and
he was constantly urging us to hustle
things along for be was going over
into Illinois to spend the holidays
with a brother of his.
"Justice squirmed in hi3 hard-bottomed
chair while my opponent' made
one of those noisy harangues tha t were
the proper thing in those days. With
a pile of books alt my elbow, I began
on a long and flowery speech which
had been rehearsed several hundred
times. I was just well under way with
the Impressive introduction when jus
tice called a halt.
" 'I hain't got no time to hear all
this here elerquenoe,' he stated in cold
blood. 'I leave fur Illinoise in the
morr-in',' and have a lot a runnin
'round ter do. I d-rawed up this here
verdict fur the plaintiff last night so's
ter save time. Constable, when Jim
mie gits through epoutim', lock up and

SEVENTH SONS.
A papular superstition that has a
remarkably tenacious bold in many
parts of the world is a belief in the
luck of a seventh sonv :A weaver
named '"Doctor" Talbot (was charged
at a 'London police court the Other day
with traveling on a railway without
having paid bis fare. The prisoner
said that Doctor was bis christian
name, and be bad had it given Wm
because he .was the seventh son of a
seventh son, and therefore possessed
the gilt of "bealing. In an English
graveyard is the following inscription:
"A Shepard, the ithir'd seventh daugh
ter, Doctress." In Lupton's "Notable
TMn'gs," edition 1660, rare find: "It is
manifest by experience that the
seventh male child by order (never
gri or wenich being born bettweeti)
doth beal only with 'touching, through
a natural gift, the king's evil, which is
a special giift elf God, given to kings
and queens, as daily experienca doth
witness." In France, especially in the
Orleans district, the seventh son is
called a mareou; be possesses bealing
pclwers and is marked on the lelft side
with a fleur-de-lis. On tbe border the
seventh son is marked with seven
stars, and it is interesting to find that
individuals of this class not only
possess inherent bealing powers, but
it is tbe usual custom to bring them up
as "doctors." "Chicago Inter-Ocean.

It is only recently that any attention
has been paid to the rice crop of Texas,
but it is demanding notice. An acre of
rice returns about $50 a crop.
Capitalists are trying to get Florida
farmers to go into cassava raising.
Starch will be manufactured from it.
Three tone to an acre at $20 a ton is-the
gold-en promise held out.
From Southern Pines, N. C, during
the past season there were shipped by
express 2,543 crates of blackberries, 12,
203 crates of peaches and 7,565 crates of
grapes.
The pineapple crop in one district
alone of Florida is estimated at $50,000
before January 1. Owners of pineries
realize as much from the sale of suck
ers as from the fruit. Each pineapple
plant produces from five to six of these
a year, and, separated from the parent
plant and planted, they grow into new.
strong plants. They sell for ten cents
piece.

A BOY'S COMPLAINT.
Almost tbe last words lather said
To me before he fell asleep
Were: "William keep this in your
bead
The crop you sow you'll have to
reap!
Don't envy others what they've 'got,
But you just do the best you can
For all the world, and you cannot
But grow to be a worthy man."
I've had to work since father died
I've learned a lot I never knew
Before he went; but still I've tried
To do the thing be told me to.
I've never cheated any one.
I've always tried to shun tbe wrong;
Ef be can see, be knows I've done
My level 'best to 'help along.
But every day or two I meet
Some one that father 'used to know
Who says: "My graic'ious "it tf'oes beat
Creation how these boys do grow!"
Ahd so be stops and looks at me,
And I could knife bim then, because
He's sure to say I'll never be
Quite such a man a's father was.
A week ago my Uncle John
Came on a visit from the West;
"Gosh bow you've grown since I've
been gone!"
He said and then I guessed the
Test.
He 'grabbed me by tbe muscle 'gee!
jtfba't an awful grJ'p be bad!
"But o' course," saM he, "you'll never
be
Quite sucb a feller as your dad!
Still mother tells me not to care
What such unthinking people say;
She says she knows I'll make them
stare
If God but lets me live, some day;
"'For even Washington," says she.
No doubt waa often sad because
Folks told bim be would never be
The man his bumble father was."

ELECTRICITY IN CATS.
Strangely enough, I once had an
impression that a cat's tendency was
to travel north, and to face the north
as a magnet does, and tbat this ten
dency bad some intimate association
with tbe electrical strengtb. of its fur.
In brief, I looked upon a ,cat as a
lightning "conductor on a small scale,
and that according to its temperament,
negative or positive, did it face north
or south, or just as tbe points of its
'fur were attracted by the negative or
positive poles of the earth. I was led
to "this by some observations I bad
made some years previously in the
London suburb. Then I noticed that
the cats of that particular district bad
a tendency to walk in particular di
rections on tbe walls fiat faced the
north rather t'han to walk on the waflTs
that ran east and we'st.
As to the idea that cats are srood
weather gauges, I do mot credit 'that.
I believe that the reason a cat washes
itsel'f over its ears or not is bound up
with the particular method by which
the particular aniimal cleans Itself, rts
main object, in washing, to my mind,
is just to com'pQete an electrical cir
cuit, for by so doing it generates beat,
and, therefore, a pleaainig sensation in
its fur. Cassell's Magazine.

IN SELF DEFENCE.
When 'the prisoner appeared before
the police judge in a Missouri town it
was difficult to say what manner of
man be was or whence he came. It
was evident, though, that be was not
en'tirely sober and bad been very
much less so. In addition he had no
doubt been rolling in the gutter and
had scraped bis face over some pretty
rough sidewalk. All in all, he was a
dilapidated specimen; yet there was
Something' about bim that bore tbe
distinctive mark of difference from the
common herd of that court room.
"Aren't you one of the famous
Rough Riders?" asked the judge, after
be bad talked to Mm very plainly,
watching bim narrowly the mean
while. The prisoner beld up bis band warn
ingly. "Don't give it away, Judge," he said,
looking around in alarm.
"What do you mean?" replied the
astonished judge.
"Just what I say, Judge," replied the
prisoner, bending over so as to get as
near as possible. "Don't give it away.
I hougbt I bad concealed my identity
from the public gaze." And. he looked
down over bimself half in pride and'
half in shame. . r '
This was too much for ! the judge,
and, bringing the prisoner, nearer, so
as be could tell his story confidentially,
so to speak, be told hilm to proceed.
"Well, you eee, it was this a-way,
Judge," said tbe prisoner with a Texas
accent; "when I was mustered out and
begin to see what the great American
people thought of us fellers that ' fit
into tbe Spaniards a Santiago I seen
that if I didn't do somiething in self
defense purty soon I was goin' to be
run for office by the party that got to
me first, er that I was going to have
the face kissed off Of me by a string of
gals a mile long; and I concluded I'd
jist git low-down, eomimon drunk and
stay tbat a-way till I could git to a safe
placein Texas. I've escaped up to
date, amd if you'll not say a word,
Judge, but just shove me along West,
I reckon I'll git back borne la fair
enough shape, all things considered.
What do you say, Judge, is it a go?"
It was Indeed, and ifche judge in
structed a police Officer to keep an eye
on the distinguished prisoner and see
that he was put on the next train
pointing its cowcatcher toward the
southwest corner of the great republic

?ARMY AND NAVY NOTES.
The gun of largest caliber in th
world is tbe British 17.72 Jnch 100 ton.
gun.
Tbe new 12-inch 50-ton gun, which is
to be supplied to battleships now build
ing, is capable of piercing 46 inches of
wrought iron, if this were placed
against the muzzle. "
Naval experts put down the active
life of a modern battleship at about 15
years. A hundred yearsago battleships
lasted nearly six times as long, and were
on active service nearly the whole ot
their commission. . '
The mules sent from the United
States to Cuba seem to thrive well there,
as only 21 have died out of the 1,200 sent.
Yet .none of the mules drank boiled
water or slept on platforms lifted above
tbe ground or observed any of the othen
rules of sanitary science.
The Egjptian army 16 years ago con
sisted of some 6,000 men, badly trained
and disciplined. In 1882 Sir Evelyn.
Wood and his assistants- took it in
band, and it has now in its ranks more
than three times that number of men.
and as regards discipline, training,, and
bravery is reckoned almost equal to
British troops.
The army of the British empire, in
cluding-British, Indian, and colonial
troops, costs more to keep up than that
of any otheT nation xn the world. In-
round numbers France pays twenty.,
five millions sterling annually for her
military defenses, Germany thirty mil
lions, Russia the same, and the British
empire thirty-seven millions.
In the fight between the fleets of Ad
mirals Cervera and Sampson off San
tiago, tbe Americans mounted 225 guns
from 13-inch down to Maxims and
the Spaniards 146. Th6 Americans
mounted 32 8-inch, 14 6-inch, and 12
5-inch, and the Spaniards 30 55-dnch
and ten 6-inch. It is calculated that tbe
Americans were able to employ 119 guns
and the Spaniards 91, and that the
weight of shot fired every minute by the
Americans was 6,720 pounds and the
Spaniards 4,827 pounds.
