California is rebellious, if not in a state

Dignitaries Who Ask After
His Health.
ROME, Dec. 4.—Pope Pius, while re
turning from his daily walk in the Vati

high church dignitaries, who inquired]
after his health.
"Thank you,” replied the Pope gently,
"I need have no fear, for 1 know I hava
yet six years to live.”
When some astonishment was ex
pressed ns to what led him to such a
positive prediction he explained:
"I was vicar at Tcmholo nine years, :
head priest nine years at Solzano, nine
years canon at Treviso, bishop of Man
tua and patriarch of Venice for the same
length or time. You see I have six years
left to me in which to accomplish my

PREACHER AND
NEGRO HANGED.
J. G. Rawlings and Alf Moore Die To
gether Without Tremor at
Valdosta, Ga.
VALDOSTA, Ga,. Dec. I-J. G.
Rawlings and Alf. Moore, a negro, were
hanged hero today for the murder of
Willie and Carrie Carter in July. 1905.
Roth stepped upon the scaffold with
out a tremor; they stood on the trap to
gether and fell together.
Rawlings, in his last statement, de
clared that he had told the truth and
that his sous had no connection with
the crime.
Story of Awful Crime.
Rawlins, his sons and the negro
wera convicted for the murder of two
little children, Rob and Annie Carter, in
an attempt to exterminate the familiy of
W. L. Carter. Carter and Rawlins had
been powerfud revival preachers in the
Methodist church. About twenty years
ago they married into wealthy families
and settled on adjoining plantations.
The Rawlins family comprises three
boys and two girls. Carter had olio sou
and three daughters.
The quarrel between the two families
originally started among the children
and was a most trivial affair. Hut the
ciders took it up and then began the
feud. Finally the trouble reached the
lighting stage and it was mutually un
derstood that trouble must ensue when
ever members of the two families
chanced to meet.
Children Shot Down,
One evening the cattle in the Carter
ham made a great rumpus. Boh and An
nie, two of the children, ran out to learn
the cause of the trouble. Carter hud
reached the porch when he saw the
children shot down by men united with
shotguns. Suspecting that it was but
the forerunner of the murder of the en
tire family, he ran into the house and
in and the doors. The cldldren had
been murdered outright. To still their
dying cries the murderers had ground
their heels into the children's faces and
kicked them until their ribs were brok
en.
All night long the murderers besieged
the house, hoping for an opportunity to
kill the occupants. Mrs. Carter's hair
turned white in the night and the rest
of tho family became nervous wrecks.
Negro Got SIOO for Murder.
On the strength of a statement made
by Moore, tho negro, the chime was
charged against Itawlins and his sons,
Moore and another negro named Turner,
itawlins was in another town on the
night of the murder, but was arrested
on Moore's claim that he had plotted
the crime. Moore said the instructions
were to kill every member of the family
and to hum the house. Ho said he had
been paid SbKi and that he and Turner
were given permission to keep till the
money that might be found in the build
ing.
They were tried, with the result that
.the elder Turner, Ids sons Milton anti
Jesse, and Moore were sentenced to
the gallon-, and Leonard Itawlins and
the negro Turner to lift" imprisonment.
The verdicts in the case went to high
er court, then to the supreme court of
the United States, then to the state sn
preme court on an extraordinary motion
and then to the hoard of pardons. The
verdict below has been sustained in each
instance. (!nv. Terrell's refusal on Mon
day to interfere with the execution of
the death sentence today destroyed their
last hope.

the method by which the Idaho authori
ties secured jurisdiction over the men.
All of them are residents of Colorado
and it was alleged on behalf of Moyer
ami his associates that they were kid
naped in pursuance to conspiracy to
which the governor of Colorado and the
Idaho authorities were parties and
hence that jurisdiction was acquired by
fraud.
Justice Harlan said that in the habeas
corpus proceedings in the United States
courts the method of extradition of the
defendants was not material. The mer
its of the cases were not involved as
that phase was not presented. The only
question there involved was the right of
the state courts to proceed with the
cases, of which there could be no doubt.
Justice McKenna delivered a dissent
ing opinion, holding that Moyer, liny
wood and I’ottibone had a right to invoke
the aid of the federal courts to corruct
improper methods used in securing their
extradition. He said that kidnaping un
der the law is no more to be justified
than when performed outside the law.
where every effort of authority is usisl
to prevent and punish it.
PLAGUE GERMS
GIVEN PRISONERS,
Stranger Mixed Bottles at Manila and
Ten Convicts Were Inoculated
Fatally.
MANILA. Dec. 3.—An investigation
made at Hilbid, where ten prisoners
who had been inoculated with cholera
scrum recently died, lias disclosed traces
of plague germs in the bodies.
No formal report lias been made and
the government has reached no decision.
Stranger Got Germs Mixed.
It is asserted that tubes containing
plague germs and others filled with
cholera serum, which arc so much alike
that it is almost impossible to distin
guish them apart, were mixed in _ the
laboratory by a visitor who examined
the plague germs, and by mistake placed
them in a rack with the scrum tubes.
This is said to have occurred during
the temporary absence of Dr. R. F.
Strong of the bureau of science, who
has been conducting experiments and in
oculation of persons with cholera scrum
to test its efficacy.
Scientist May Resign.
The natives generally are In ignorance
of the situation, but the foreigners are
indignant and bitter. It is not believed
that criminal charges will be preferred,
but it is possible that Dr. Strong may
resign.
LABOR ISGREATLST TRUST
Head of Citizens’ Industrial Association
Scathingly Arraigns Recent Cam
paign by Gompers.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 3.—President
Post in bis report to the Citizens' Indus
trial association today characterized the
American Federation of Labor as "The
greatest trust in tho world.” He de
clared the industrial association was
formed to defend communities and citi
zens from "the destructive acts of both
capital and labor.”
He said: "In the late election where
the labor trust was avowedly arrayed
against the common people in an effort
to retire congressmen who voted con
trary to the dictates of the trust, the
discovery was made that the great mass
of citizens are not members of the la
bor trust, or of any other mist.”
