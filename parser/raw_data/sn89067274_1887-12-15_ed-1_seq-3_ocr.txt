There was a large audience pres
ent at the morning service of the
Christian church Sunday much
larger than would have been there,
doubtless, had not the announce
ment been made that the report of
the Trial Board would be given in
full at that time. Eld. J. W. Hig
bee, the pastor, was ill and unable
to conduct the service and P. W.
Harding, chairman of the Board of
Elders, had charge of the meeting.
The 37th Psalm was read and after
song, prayer and the usual sacra
mental service, the benediction
was pronounced. Mr. Harding
made the announcement that the re
port was not yet in the proper form
to be submitted and he doubted if
it could be given even on Wednes
day evening.
Later A leading member of the
church told the Ledger this after
noon that the result will be iven
to the public Wednesday evening,
at prayer meeting.

but they will take their medicine
when it is finally presented to them,
as it is sure to be during this ses

against us in this fight, and it is
just as well that there should be a
general roll-call and inspection
before the battle of 1888 begins.

Correspondence ol the Ledger.
Pceblo, Col., Dec. 8. I will
give the readers of the Ledger a
little history of the freaks of one of
the many weeklies sent out Decem
ber 1: -
I am unable to say the exact hour
on Thursday, Dec. 1, that the
Ledger left the office, but suffice
to say, it went to Kansas City first,

known at what point the load will
cross the MissourJ river Parties
interested in theline have gone
over the country 4nd iave been
greatly encouraged ay citizens all
along the route. At "Hannibal, it
is thought the C. B. & Q. will be
tapped, thus giving a direct outlet
to Chicago from the great South
west, which for years has sorely
felt the need of such a line. The
incorporators of the new enterprise
are R. C. Nickerson, R. D. Fowlew,
E. F. House, Jas. Lathrop, R. H.
Fudge and John L. Lothrop, all of
Chicago.
R. H. Fudge, one of the incor
porators, was in the city to-day,
and departed late this afternoon for
Hannibal. He is enthusiastic over
tee outlook and is confident of the
success of the enterprise.

The "trust" is all-powerful.

dreary than it was last week? Two

that it made everyone long to get
a peep at the "silvery lining", of
U1O80 oarjc, misty clouds. Such
days, it any on should be

should, would bo a most excellent
time tor the dark deed; the victim
would have nothing bright to look

the future ftato. But the eilverv
lining has put in its anrjeamn
this morning, and bow faces have
brightened, Bteps are quicker,
laughs are louder, and all our mer
chants are ready to sell on time.
Speaking of merchants reminds me
of a little episode that happened
last week. A farmer's family liv
ing near here came in and pur
chased goods lrom several business
firms. Word came that the
family would leave in a few days
for Kansas City. The merchants
got uneasy about their goods and the
three firms sent representatives out
to collect the money if possible, if
not, the goods. They all arrived
at the same time. The goods were
given back to two of the firms, but
the third, the one they had bought
the most from, failed to get either
goods or money. The : family had
packed most of their ! household
goods ready for starting, and we
presume they i had also packed
Merchant No. 3's goods. The
mother said she knew not where to
lay her hands, on the goods and
she was qot the owner of them.
The daughter said finding was be
fore taking and being busy at work
refused to help find. Nos. 1 and
2 got their goods back as they were
not just the style wanted. We
presume they didn't match the
dress patterns lying there concealed
from the ga2e of any - that might
know them. We presume the
young lady thought it best to have
oil her 6uit to match. . The mer
chants, with the aid of our Marshal,
looked - in the deep ' recesses of
trunks, dived to the bottom of
boxes, climbed "the golden stairB,"
but all to no avail. No goods ex
cept those that had been used in
the family were brought forth. The
mother and daughter did not as
sist in the search, but sat calmly
by, telling where they had better
look, directing them to a certain
box where they would find some
thing to eat. We presume by this
time the family and the merchant's
goods are all in some place near
Kansas City and the daughter per
haps is making fine robes for the
holiday occasion, while her cred
itors are: thinking of donning sack
cloth and ashes.

Auxvasse, Dec. 14. The water-
witches have disappeared from our
country with the first jjenerous
shower, and we earnestly hope
they may not be called for again for
many years. However, our peo
ple should not forget the lesson
the drouth has taught us at such a
fearful cost, but should proceed,
not in desperation, but as provi-.
dent individuals and prepare ample
reservoirs, ponds; cisterns, or bore
for living water, as -economy and
sound judgment may indicate.
Mr. M. Greer bought four lots
ofJohnSwon on Clinton avenue,
and has begun the erection ol a resi
dence thereon. . Mr. Greer will
make his home here and will be
quite an accession to our village.
Elder Reese, of the Christian
church of Fulton, has been engaged
in a protracted meeting here since
last Sunday. His meetings have
been well attended, the member
ship revived and there were eleven
additions to the church with eight
baptisms. The Elder is a clear
headed, scholarly preacher, mani
festing entire consecration to the
Master's work.
Mrs. Joe Brothers has been very
ill with pneumonia, but we are
glad to report her improving.
Mr. Sam Schooler .stole a march
on the boys last Wednesday night
while they were all at church and
married the handsomest girl in
town. AVhen the boys 'found out
what Sam had done they held, an
informal meeting and unanimously
decided that a charivari was in or
der. Hence,everything that would
make a none was brought into re
quisition, a captain apixrinted and
Sam was soon brought to the front
with his beautiful bnde, and arter
brief introductions and congratula
tions, the company dispersed in ft
fine humor.
