Population of Los Angeles, 251.463 ;
Start In on your Christmas buying
today.
Only two more weeks of Christmas
purchasing left.
Oo right ahead Mr. Harriman; noth-
In's holdln' you.
, The powder king has been divorced.
Too many blowings up?
Nice warm rains mean fine golden
oranges. Watch 'em grow.
Post your gifts early; it helps the
postofflce and expedites delivery.
The scramble to the Democratic pie
counter grows with each passing hour.
Send you • packages east early. Bet
ter a week toe soon than a day too
late.
This rain may not help the Christ
mas shopping, but think what it will
do for the crops.
How does Uncle Vim Hill like the ac
tivity hereabouts of his most puissant
rival, E. H. Harrlman?
Evidently Mr. Harriman sees that
Los Angeles and not San Francisco is
the great city of the coast.
It won't be a very merry Christmas
for a lot of Republican pie-blters who
lose their Jobs early In January.
Meanwhile, Mr. Harrlman, consider
ably better service on the lines as at
present constituted would help some.
Wisconsin university's president says
tainted money ,1a harmless. Somebody
'" give 'Mm some? Or is that a bid for a
gift?
Of course the Chinese agree with
the president's message on the Jap
anese. Us Mongolians must stand to
gether.
Presumably the overworked "un
written law" will again be depended
upon to free the woman who shot ex-
Senator Brown.
Stopping the cars on the "near" side
is like halting an elevator with the roof
of the car level with the floor— and
just as sensible.
If Harriman does swallow up Hunt
lngton, as is rumored, Los Angeles will
lose the best street railway man In
the United States.
Los Angeles last year built twenty
five miles of new buildings; this year's
record is thirty-three miles. What city
on earth can beat it?
The "near" side car order will last
Just lonp enough to muk" everyone sore
on the trolley companies. Then they'll
change back to the present sensible
style.
It is to be hoped the senate will
not mix up in the Roosevelt-Storer
row until it washes tome of its own
dirty linen— Smoot, Platt, Depew,
et al.
The lone train robber in Missouri
was captured; the lone bank robber
In Kansas is behind the bars. It's
a bad year for the lone bandit, it
seems.
"Los Angeles has arrived," says a
f-an Francisco business man who comes
here to locate. Yeß, but it isn't content
with arriving; it will yet head the pro
cession.
Uncle Vim Hill is again in the lime
light. No; not speeches on prosperity;
a little smelling bee by the interstate
commerce commission ai to why so
much prosperity sticks to Uncle Vim's
fingers.
Only five cities In America put more
money into buildings in November than
Los Angeles did— and they are the Jive
largest places in the United Utates. No
city smaller than five times itself came
anywhere near Los Angeles. That's a
record for you!
Mr. Harrlman promises to do big
things for Los Angeles because it will
always be the metropolis of the coast.
No one ever accused Mr. Harriinan
of being a false prophet, but if all his
guesses have been the cinch that thu
one U, how could they?
The Herald printed last' summer in
'•. detail every plan of the Harriman in
. tercuts which was disclosed officially
yesterday. The Los Angeles-Paclflc
people howled "nonsense" very vigor
ously, and other papers, notably the
Snooze, yawped "fake." Now they all
print It. The Herald happened to know
what it wait talking about, an usual;
. the other* didn't.
■■NPArT CROSSING FAD
Log Angeles Is again to be made the
Victim of a foolish fad. The trolley
rur.i ire to be stopped on the "near"
crossings. Instead of the "far" ones.
Just who Is responsible for this no
tion It Is hard to say. It was embod
ied In a series of recommendations
mnde by n group of citizens to 11. ]■;
Huntlngton, one of the greatest and
most expert trolley car magnates on
earth. Most of these recommenda
tions the Huntlngton Interests had al
ready taken steps to adopt; some of
them were clearly Impossible and never
will be considered. The most foolish,
lmpracticable and troublesome of all
—that of "nsar" crossing stoppages,
this wise magnate picked out to try
probably to show how little his ad
visers know about their subject, mid
quickly to disgust the city with the
whole ;i(Tnlr.
Stopping onrs on the "near" side of
the street Is sheer folly. No one ever
looks for ■ cur there, In the flrit place.
ilciic.' tndlm confusion nnd delay are
bound tn ensue. Signs will be necea
siiry to direct strangers— for only one
OthCT city In Ihe country permits the
custom, though many hiive tried It.
Traffic will be blocked because no
teamitar can tell how long <i car will
1»' StOpp#d nnd no je.hu will hold his
horses waiting Indefinitely on a motor
man. Now a teams) or sees I car ap
proach, nnd, waiting till It has passed,
goes In Its rear; hereiifter he will
drive In front and block traffic.
The new rule will he especially mean
In rainy weather. Cars now stop with
the rear steps nt the crossings nnd
people board and alight dry shod. Un
der the new management they will be
dumped off In the mud any old place.
The front end of the car Is the dan
ger end. People who are thrown un
•dor the wheels meet with the accident
while hoarding or leaving the front
end. The "near" side rule will make
the uHe of the front end Imperative
and accidents untold are sure to fol
low from persons slipping beneath the
wheels.
The logical wny to leave a car is
by the rear door. Years of education
have taught people thiH and they do
It Instinctively. All this must be
changed; imagine the confusion that
will ensue.
The motorman Is on the front of a
car and his attention should be con
centrated on his work. The use of
his platform for ingress and egress
should be forbidden. The new rule
throws almost nil the traffic at his
end and tends to confuse and rattle
him. The conductor, hired to assist
and look after passengers, is to be
left alone on the unused end of the
car. Isn't that foolish?
The danger at crossings Is Increased
many fold.. Now pedestrians and driv
ers stop as a car approaches, knowing
that It will pass and that they will
then be safe. The new rule will re
quire every bit of cross-street traffic
to cease, when a car approaches, till
it stops, unloads, loads and proceeds —
else one may be run down, as no one
can tell when It will start. It banks
cars in the center of the blocks and
obstructs the free traffic of the street.
It is abominable, senseless and dan
gerous.
Toronto tried the near side rule and
abandoned it in disgust. Washington
gave it up as a failure. Kansas City
undertook it and the council made the
trolley company return to the sane
way. Many other cities abandoned
the idea. San Francisco alone per
sists In It. Los Angeles is foolish for
tolerating it one day, filled as the city
is with strangers from every other
city where the proper method is ob
served.
It should never be put in force, even
for a day.
/o JAPANESE WAR
There will be no war between the
United States and Japan, despite the
hysterical yawps of the yellow press
and the reports of "talk in Wash
ington." And it will be because
Japan neither wants to nor can fight.
It takes money to run a war — much
more money than the ordinary man
thinks. The recent mlxup with Russia
cost the Nipponese $1,000,000 a day Just
for the army in the field; at least,
Japan admits that It cost that much.
Probably the total was much more. It
co6t the Island kingdom thousands of
her sturdiest sons and reduced her pro
ducing capacity — and hence her flnan
i ml status— by the results of all their
labors, nnd this cannot be recovered
fur ;i generation to come, it cost her
■everal of her best war vessels and
though these in a way were replaced
by those taken from Russia, still the
captured e&pi have cost much to refit
and are still mere Junk compared to up
to-date fighting machines. A debt
running Into the billions v:a3 Japan's
legacy from that war and only by
straining every nerve can she pay the
interest on it. Vast colonies were ac
quired and theii development and ex
ploitation even now is hindered by lack
of funds.
The reason that Japan ended her
war with Russia just when she had
complete victory in her grasp and on
terms which were little short of com
plete surrender to the czar's demands,
whs because she had no money with
which to continue hostilities. The
world didn't know this at the time,
but the money brokers did. They
stopped the bloodshed; they simply re
fused to furnish any more sinews of
war; ami perforce the war came to an
end— you can't tight without a plethoric
treasure chest, "Witte knew all this;
he knew his own nation was in finan
cial straits and could get no help; If
the white Russians could not, how
could the brown Japanese? He knew
they couldn't— and he made the bar-

A GOOD PROPOSITION
Make an annual aproprlatlon of $50,
0,000 for river and hurbor Improve
ments, and expend the money where
It will do the most good.
That Is a proposition advocated by
the National Rivers and Harbors Con
gress, which began Its session In Wash
ington last Thursday. California
members of congress are consplcuaus
BdvQCatM Of the proposition. A lead-
Ing purpose In this movement, as stat
ed, Is to make comprehensive Improve
ment of waterways "a remedy for tho
wholly Inadequate transportation
facilities now afforded by the rail
roads."
The yearly appropriations for river
and harbor account vary greatly, and
they are governed largely by the ten
sion of political "pull" in the several
localities directly Interested. The fix
ing of a large aggregate sum for tho
purpose, to be expended annually,
would not eliminate the "pull" feature,
but it would Insure a vast Increase in
the scope of much needed improve
ments.
The Pacific coaßt states are especial
ly Interested In an enlarged scheme of
river and harbor Improvements. Here
tofore the Atlantic coast states have
been especially favored In this respect
because of their greater commercial
Importance. A change in this situation
is taking place, however, by reason of
the rapid development of the Pacific
slope.
Southern California has only a gen
eral Interest in the proposition for en
larged river and harbor work. We have
no navigable rivers on the coast side
and no noticeable harbors except those
of San Pedro and San Diego. Work is
so far advanced on San Pedro harbor
that there is no question about suffi
cient funds for its completion, although
an expansion of the original plan would
be desirable. San Diego harbor is ser
viceable now for all such tonnage as
it is likely to need accommodation for
In view of present commercial pros
pects.
Good roads and improved waterways
are the greatest needs to the develop
ment of American industries. Instead
of building battleships at a cost of $5,
0,000 each and expending many mil
lions of dollars yearly in support of a
large army in the Philippines, we might
better employ the funds in home im
provements. Millions for defense but
not one cent for aggression would be
a commendable adaptation of Plnck
ney's famous motto.
Los Angeles during November was
fourth in the number of building per
mits granted, only Brooklyn, Philadel
phia and Chicago — each very many
times its size— surpassing it. Popula
tion considered, Los Angeles far out
distanced every city in America.
When the new legislators meet here
tomorrow advise them in detail about
the proposed city and county consoli
dation plan. Then they'll know what
Los Angeles wants and not be left
In the dark, as the special session was.
A French doctor advises that the
night be halved; that people do not
sleep through it, but divide it into
parts of waking and slumber. The
old rounder, however, does that now —
and see what he comes to.
Negroes thrown out of the army by
the recent unwarranted wholesale dis
charge on executive order are seeking
re-enlistment. Thut offers the pres
ident aa t \vay out of the mess into which
his impetuosity led him.
As the leading part, head and front
of the yellow peril, it is to be ex
pected that the Hoist newspapers will
be in with the Japanese and the Chi
nese and the president on his stand
against the Pacific coast.
In view of the general use to which
slayers are putting the "unwritten
law" wouldn't it be well to have that
law reduced to writing and codified?
It would save a lot of legal interpre
tation and trouble.
Another car runaway Saturday on
the West Second street hill recalls the
terrific smashup there last Christmas
eve. Wouldn't it be wise to take some
measures to prevent runaways on this
dangerous Incline?

SUCCESSFUL CONVENTION IS

Last Day Is Given to Much Activity
and Brilliant Addresses — New
Organ Adds Beauty to

The moat successful convention of
the Southern California Baptist attain*
bly closed yestertlny after a long series
of helpful sessions and brilliant ad
dresses. The sessions yesterday were
lii keeping with the closing of a large
assemblage, and also marked the clot
in« of the young people's convention.
Despite the rain forty delegates at
tended the auniiee service yesterday (it
7 :80 o'clock, at which Rev. George C,
Wright of Santa Barbara presided.
Many of the delegates attended the
Sunday school session, the adults
meeting In Rerean hall, while the pri
mary classes were held In the child
ren's hall. ;i:
Ai 11 o'clock the annual B. V, P. 17.
sermon was preached by Rev. Robert J.
Hurdettc in the main auditorium. Pre
cedlng the sermon the Impressive rite
of baptism by Immersion was admluls
tered to one candidate. The baplstery
was enhanced hy the background, tho
scenery representing a sunlit forc.lt.
The large audience, wMch filled the
auditorium, for the moment forgot
that Walls of solid concrete encased
them, and that they were not out In
the open forest, with a running stream
as the baptismal waters.
Dr. Burdette. in his own inimitable
style, spoke to the young people, tuk
ing for his topic, "A Life of Pleasure."
The text was from II Corinthians
12:10. "Therefore I take pleasure in In
firmities, In reproaches, In necessities,
In persecutions, in distresses, for
Chtit's sake; for when I am weak,
then am I strong." He said in part:
Love of Pleasure Natural
"A love of pleasure is natural. It
is a child's idea of life to have a good
time. A little child dances when she
hears lively music, although she never
saw any one dance and doesn't know
what dancing is. It is beautiful and
natural— in little children. But if I
should go dancing around at my time
of life I ought to be shot. Some peo
ple never grow beyond childhood in
their love of pleasure. Men plan for
pleaaure. 'If I had all the money I
wanted,' a man says, 'I'd ' Well,
what, Robin Ruff? He'd 'have a good
time.' He'd do as he pleased; he'd en-
Joy himself. That's natural.
"In the matter of innocent amuse
ments,' by which we old folks usually
mean the kind that were enjoyable
sixty years ago and which are not at
all amusing now, the church has said
for so many years to the young folks,
"You shan't, you mustn't; don't— don't
—don't!' that It must begin td say,
'You may.' Come Into the church,
children, and have a good time!
'What, in the church?' Sure! That's
what the church believes in. It wants
you to have the time of your life. A
good time, indeed, that will outlast
your life and keep on getting better
all the time. Even back In the apos
tolic days the church believed In pleas
ures. What with dodging spies and
persecutors and heretic hunters, Ro
man soldiers nnd Imperial inquisltora
It didn't have much time for recrea
tion, but it believed In a life of pleas
ure.
"Why, the world was wild with
pleasure in Paul's day. 'Panem et
circences!" was the popular cry. Thea
ters all over the world. A growing
taste for pleasure. Stronger and spi
cier year by year. Last year's bills
too tame. Must have a little more
thrill In them to please the audiences.
Wild beast fights too slow. Put a
man down in the arena to match the
tiger. Ah, that's something like sport!
Bravo, tiger! No, the man's got him!
The tiger gives back! Coward! No, he
springs again— hear the bones in the
man's arm crunch under those fear
ful jaws! Stand up to him, Christian!
There, the tiger's got him by the
throat! Glorious! Drive away the
tiger now and haul away the man.
No! Shame! Let the tiger have his
breakfast— the poor brute hasn't tast
ed food for three days.

thai your church is too strict and rig

lnI In the Roman empire. Thai was the
sport that made the name Christian
the noblest, bravest, subllinrst, most
heroic name In any language in any
age of the world!
"Yes, my children, your fathers went
to the theater. And they gloried In
lt. Could you? And who looked on
from the boxes and the high, safe
seats? The same kind of people Who
attend prize fights today. Politicians,
business men, rich men of leisure;
people who believed In 'healthful and
ennobling sport, In which' they were
safe spectators,
"Ah, the world was full of pleasure
lnI In those 'good old wide-open days.'
Th* most popular emperor was he who
lnvented the newest amusements for
the hard-working citizens who had so
few pleasures in life. Bven today
there are people In Los Angeles who
have /absolutely no pleasures what
over Just because a few years ago the
'long-hairs' and 'hypocrites' of the
churches managed at last to put a stop
to coursing sport In which half a
dozen dogs tore live rabbits to pieces
for the amusement of some pleasure
loving people on Sunday afternoon.
What's life without a good time?
Wine party, Monday; theater, Tues
day; dinner, Wednesday; automobile
trip with a supper at a winery, Thurs
day; Ascot races, Friday; prize fight,
Saturday, and golf Sunday! There's
a jolly week for you! Strike the pace,
my son. 'Rejoice, O young mn, In thy
youth and let thy heart cheer thee in
the days of thy youth and walk In the
ways of thine heart and In the sight
of thine eyes, but know thou, that for
all these things God will bring thee
lnto judgment!' "
Rally Closes Meeting
At the closing rally meeting in the
afternoon Rev. S. A. Northrop pre
sided.
Rev. A. L. Wadsworth, field secre
tary, read a report of the historical
committee. He said:
"In some sections there are so many
chnnges among the ministers that they
have taken the name of 'butterfly pas
tors.' "
Rev. Arthur S. Phelps made a short
address on "Your Part," In which he
said:
"It Is a great thing to be an officer
of a young people's society, or a mem
ber of a committee. They said to an
old colored woman: 'I understand that
your son^ who was studying for the
ministry, Holdß a high position In the
church now.' 'Vis, sah; he's mighty
neah de top, now; he's palntln'
steeples; he says dere's moh money
in paintin' steeples dan dey Is in
poundln' pulpits.' So it is a great
honor to hold a position in your so
ciety. But for what end is that honor?
One of the most wonderful discoveries
of Darwin In his 'Origin of Species'
was that nothing exists in nature just
for its beauty. The color on the peach
and on the petal and on the bird's
wing is to perpetuate the species. It
Is to render them attractive to the
disseminating forces of propagation.
"Let use, then, Justify honor. My
wife has some old-fashioned chairs in
our parlor which we brought from our
home in Connecticut. But heavy men
are warned not to sit down in them;
they are to look at. We hqpr our
young people's commltteee report at
the quarterly business meeting, 'We
are holding our own.' Is that all you
can say? I go out on the ocean and
call to a vessel we are passing, 'How
many knots are you making?' and
she answers, 'We are not making any,
but we are holding our own.' I go
out on the porch In the moonlight and
see my friend in the hammock and
say, 'Fred, what are you doing?' and
he answers, 'I am holding my own.'
I go to the cemetery and I say, 'Old
cemetery, what are you doing?' and
the cemetery answers, 'Holding my
own.' Holding Its own, but every one
a corpse! *
Definition of Life
"Let use be directed into adaptation.
Spencer's definition of life was that
it Is the adaptation of Internal rela
tions to external relations. This must
be true of your committee. It will not
follow slavishly the rules laid down
In the books, but adjust Itself to the
life of the church and fche needs of the
surrounding community. When Lin
coln was asked how long a man's legs
ought to be, he answered. 'I have al
ways thought a man's legs ought to
be long enough to reach from his body
to the ground.' Your committee must

ties of the church recognize the great
need of a band of consecrated young
people to aid In the great religious
work. I think that a church should
provide all possible means to enthuse
the young people to ennobling work for
the church. It Is a holy enthusiasm
and there Is room for everybody to
participate In it. We are inclined to
be too tame in our work and fall into
ruts. We need a spirit of action that
makeß mistakes, for we are all human
and some mistakes must be made If a
great amount 'of work Is accomplished.
Let us try and do something worthy of
the cause we uphold and maintain,
even at the risk of some mistakes,
which can be corrected.
"We may be like the negro who at
tached himself by a rope to a mule.
A friend saw his predicament, as he
was being dragged by the animal, and
Interceding, asked the negro If he
hadn't made a mistake, to which he
replied, 'Certainly, sah. I tumbled onto
de mistake befo' de mule drugged me
two rods.'
"A boy may ask many questions con
cerning subjects of the day and It will
not do to turn off with old fogy ideas.
He is beginning to think for himself
and the old traditions will not quiet
him. He should be instructed in the
present day activities and in the
knowledge of God."
Rev. Mr. Pierce drew a contrast be
tween two homes, the one having a
parlor that was nearly always closed
and no person allowed to enter it, lest
a particle of dust or sunshine entered;
the other, a parlor which was always
open for the family and friends to the
enjoyment of the comforts of life.
"Think of the young people," con
tinued Rev. Mr. Pierce, "who are com
ing to take up the work of their fore
fathers. They should be Instructed into
their Inheritance that they may be en
dowed with the precepts of Jesus
Christ.

"There la a great deal of machinery
