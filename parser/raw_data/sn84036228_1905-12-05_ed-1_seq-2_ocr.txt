LEWISTOWN, MONT.. Dec. 5. 1905.
DON'T LET THEM LAPSE.
Nothing could have been more time
ly and appropriate than the Thanks
giving greeting of Senator Armstrong,
chairman of the committee appointed
by the New York legislature to inves
tigate into the affairs of the big life
insurance companies. The searching
investigations now being conducted
will result in placing these great com
panies on an economical basis of man
agement and control, and lead to leg
islation that will make secure the
r'ghts of policyholders. Senator Ann
strong .in his greeting, gives the fol
lowing good advice:
"I am asked for a brief message to
policyholders on the eve of our ad
journment for the month, and am glad
to make this suggestion: Do not allow
your policies to lapse on account of
anything revealed by this investiga
tion. Policyholders are in a better
position now than before the investiga
tion began and their position ought
steadily to improve as our inquiry pro
ceeds. The legislation we will recom
mend will undoubtedly safeguard and
strengthen the rights of policyholders,
but those who suffer their policies lo
laps-e will lose the benefit of what has
been done already, as well as what
we hope to accomplish. No sacrifice
now ought to be made by policyhold
ers and patience and courage for a
short time will not only prevent loss,
but enable this committee to render
the liest service to the greatest num
ber."
This is the time for policyholders
to exhibit coolness and steadfast failli
in the outcome of the investigation.
Already Alexander, Hyde and Jordan
are out. of the Equitable, McCurdy has
resigned the prosidenccy of the Mutual
and the balance of Hie family will
toon retire. The McCalls, Hedgeman
and others will soon have to drop out
of the New York Life.
Examination shows that the finances
of the Equitable company are in a
sound condition. The net assets of
the company are found to be $410,
044,927, and the surplus $67,142,865.
Under the able management of Paul
Morton the affairs of this company,
the first to be under the lime light,
are fast getting into good shape. The
grafters have been kicked out and the
business is being conducted in the in
terest of policyholders. Confidence is
being restored and the company is get
ting new business.
The outlook is that all of the big
ci mpanies will be better and stronger
than ever in a few years. It is to be
hoped that some way can be found
to further safeguard policyholders
through national legislation.
HADN'T HEARD ABOUT IT.
In 1905 we sold $253,000,000 of mer
chandise to the United Kingdom, $194,
000,000 to Germany, $140,000,000 to
Canada, and smaller amounts to the
other countries, says the St. Louis
Globe-Democrat. The $1,518,000,000
of our exports to the outside world in
1905 went to all continents and coun
tries. The reciprocity people appear
not to have heard of these things.
They do not seem to know that our
sales to the rest of the world are
growing by leaps and bounds. England,
Germany and the rest of the world
talk about the "American invasion."
All those countries except England
are planning how to resist the "inva
sion," and to keeip the Americans
from conquering the world's markets.
None of these things, however, seems
to have come to the knowledge of the
leciprocity advocates. At the time
when the amiable gentlemen in Chi
cago were telling us that foreign na
tions were turning against us on ate
count of our "commercial attitude,"
we were making vast conquests in the
world's markets.
In the present fiscal year our con
quests are likely to be still greater
than they were in the year which end
ed six weeks ago. It was noticed that
nobody representing the Roosevelt ad
ministration appeared at the reciproc
ity conference, or took any notice of it.
The figures which we have just cited
showing the great increase in the
country's exports under the present
tariff, especially the exports of man
ufactures, will explain why it is that
neither the president nor any other
Republican leader who leads anything
paid any attention to the reciprocity
round-up.
THE C. A M. COMING.
Now it is officially announced that
the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul
road will commence the construction
of an extension of its line to the Pa
cific coast at once. It is said the pro
posed extension will cost 160,000,000,
but nothing is given out as to the
course the line will take in passing
to the coast. Possibly this will re
main undetermined until an engineer
ing crew has gone over the ground.
Of late the impression has prevailed
that the road would pass through Wy
oming, south of the national park, ow
ing to the fact that the company has
large coal measures in that state. But
there may be no ground for this. Sure
ly, central Montana offers extraordi
nary inducements to the new line. Not |
in prestent tonnage, perhaps, but in
the unfolding and developments of the
I
future. It would hardly seem probab-1
le that the possibilities of this region
would be overlooked in selecting a
reute to the coast. The Milwaukee
has agents and representatives who
are familiar with the situation and in
all probability some one authorized to
determine the location stakes of this
system will be in Fergus county bte
fore many months have passed away.
Future developments will be watched
with interest.
The conviction of Senator Burton
of Kansas on the indictment charging
him of acting in the capacity of a paid
attorney in behalf of Lue Rialto Grain
& Securities Co. of St. Louis before
the postoffice department to prevent
the issuance of a fraud order, should
prove a lesson to young men who have
political aspirations. Senator Burton
vas looked upon as one of the ablest,
men west of the Missouri river. As
ar orator he ranked among the best
and was frequently called beyond the
limits of his state owing to his abil
ity in this line. Long before he was
chosen a United States senator he
was regarded as one of the coming
men of the southwest. How unfortun
ate that he should not have been sat
isfied with the highest office the peo
ple of Kansas could confer upon him.
The salary of the office was ample
for his needs hut thoughtlessly or in
tentionally he prostituted it for further
gain and must now pay the penalty
with a prison sentence and be forever
barred from holding a position of bon- 1
or and trust in the service of the |
United States. He made a sad and fa- !
tal mistake.
Great sorrows visit Hie homes of the |
wealthy as well as the poor. A few j
days since while purchasing an equip- I
ment for a hunting trip, Marshall j
Field. Jr., of Chicago, was shown a
new pattern revolver by the dealer
with whom he was in the habit of
trading, and becoming interested in its
mechanism, concluded to purchase one,
although he staled that he was the
owner of several revolvers and did not
have much use for one. The weapon
was sent to his home and shortly af
ter in an effort to become more fam
iliar with its workings, which were
quite intricate, he accidentally shot
himself, inflicting a wound from which
he died, after hovering between life
and death for a week or more. The
father, who was in New York city,
hurried to his bedside by special train,
which smashed all records, but the
liest skill that money could buy was
unavailing. Thus the heir to many
millions was taken in the prime of
life and a home that knew no earthly
want was made desolate.
It Is probable that congress at this
session will take up the matter of
changing the date of inauguration day.
The committee appointed to take the
matter in hand will recommend the
last Thursday in April as a more de
si raille date for the ceremonies. This
change of date has been urged for
some time but grave and reverend
senators are sticklers for traditions
and customs even though death visits
their chamber as a result of expos
ures on March 4th, the present inaug
uration day. In any event there is
good prospects for a change before
another president is inducted into of
fice. March weather in Washington
is anything but pleasant as a usual
thing and visitors to as well as resi
dents of the national capital will be
glad when the present date is abandon
ed.
The United States sold to Canada
last year exports to the value of $160,
000,000, this amount constituting more
than 62 per cent of the whole Canadi
an imports and was only eleven per
cent of the exports of the United
States. Besides selling goods to Can
ada fully 25,000 settlers went from the
United States to its northern neighbor
from January to October. 1905, the val
ue of their effects being placed at $25,
• Min. There has been a falling off in
the number of emigrants in the past
two years which is likely to continue
in the future. A good inanyy have re
turned lo file United States having
been disappointed with tae lands and
climatic conditions in tile dominion.
Better opportunities are offered in
Montana for settlers than can he found
across the line.
A representative of the Helena In
dependent interviewed Senator Clark
last week and among the questions
asked him was this: "What do you
think of Roosevelt's plan for federal
control of railroads, senator?" To
which Mr. Clark replied: "In the mat
ter of the proposed federal control of
railroads, I can say I favor the idea,
as it appears primarily. Of course,
there are so many different interpre
tations of that expression that one's
decision must lie qualified." This is
about as clear as mud. It is to be
hoped the senator will define his po
sition more fully after he has listen
eu to the reading of President Roose
velt's message.
Bishop Grace, of the Roman Cath
olic church in California, says that
conditions in Ireland are not so bad
as some persons would have the peo
ple of America believe. In a recent in
terview in the Sacramento Union, af
ter his return from Wexford, he said
he found that under the new land laws
"the people are able to get hold of a
little land, a very little to be sure,
as we Californians would consider it,
but still enough to give them a foot
hold, and the most of them are pros
perous and comfortable. Many people
bave gone away and the decrease in
population makes it easier for those
who remain."
P
The city of Havre has again been
visited by a disastrous conflagration,
entailing a loss of $150,000 worth of
property. Buildings only recently
completed furnished food for the flames,
among them being a large and hand
some hotel and the costly Broadwater
Pepin building. The fire is believed
to be of incendiary origin, an insid
ious enemy hard to combat. One must
he totally depraved, who would inflict
such a loss upon men of moderate
means and upon a town that has just
arisen from the ashes of a former con
flagration. It hardly seems probable
that the Havre fires were accidental.
The fund being raised in the Unit
es States for the relief of the Russian
Jews is growing by leaps and bounds.
New York City has subscribed nearly
a million dollars, while generous con
tributions are being made in Chicago,
St. Louis, Philadelphia and other large
cities of the country. The Russian gov
ernment. if there is anything worthy
of being called such, is in a measure
responsible for the shocking cruelties
that have startled the world. No doubt
every safeguard will be taken to the
end that the relief fund raised will be
distributed among those who have sur
vived the massacres.
There have been eighteen deaths
and 12(1 injuries from the game of foot
ball during the season just closed. The
greatest number of fatalities occurred
am mg high school scholars. Most of
tin deaths were caused by concussion
of the brain. Evidently the time has
come lo take off some of the rough
edges from the. game of football.
The Anaconda Standard says "the
day is not far distant which will let
jou avail yourself of the opportunity,
if you want it, to hoard, in Butte, a
Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul train,
eastbound or west." Is there a city
in tile state that is not expecting the
Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul road?
"Where did you get it?" is a newly
coined expression that was given mo
mentum in the recent municipal cam
paign in New York. It will apply to
a red nose or a blackened eye as well
as to money. It is likely to become
a handy addition to the current vo
cabulary of slang.
Wealth production on the farms of
• he United States in 1905 reached t'ae
highest amount ever attained in this
or any other country- $0,415.000,000.
While Montana was enjoying a gen
tle and even fall of the "beautiful"
fierce blizzards raged in Minnesota
and the Dakotas.
Disappointed.
"Don't you know," said the young
man who thinks he has a musical tal
ent, "I sprained my throat the other
day playing the cornet."
"Yes," replied hiB landlady, "and
the neighbors sent their sympathy un
til they heard the truth."
"What truth?"
"They thought you had sprained
the cornet."—Chicago News.
