DROPS DETAILS
Stated That the President'#
Message Will Not Follow
Precedent,
lu That It Will Only Deal With
Important Questions ot
the Hour.
Department Details Being ¥ett
to the Reports of Cabinet
Officers.
WASHINGTON, Deo. 8 —The message
of Psesident McKinley will be devoted
practically to the subjects of oar for­
eign relations and the onrrenoy prob­
lem. It will be unique in the respect
that it will ignore the great bulk of
matters usually constituting the depart­
mental portions of the president's an­
nual message. There is scarcely a ref­
erence to the subject matter of the an­
nual reports of the cabinet, the presi­
dent's purpose being to call attention
only to the more important affairs of
the government. For this reason the
postal savings project of the postmaster
general is not discussed in the message.
While the details of the currency
plank are not definitely known, it can
be authoritatively stated that it is in
the main an incorporation of the views
submitted by Secretary Gage, though
as to details the president leaves him*
self freedom of action by not taking
any position with reference to several
features of the secretary's plan while
endorsing its main object.
Hawaii and Cuba.
A strong presentation of the Hawaiian
question is made and congress is urged
to take immediate action by ratification
of the treaty of annexation. This part
of the ,, message strongly depicts the
necessity for making the island part of
the domain of the United States and re­
views advantages that would accrue
to the country by its possession. As to
Cuba the message calls attention to the
recent trend of affairs on the island, re­
fers to the scheme of autonomy just
offered by Spain and, after reciting
other developments in the situation,
reaches the virtual conclusion that exist­
ing circumstances do not warrant inter­
ference in the affairs of the island.
Considerable attention is paid to the
question of reciprocity negotiations
with various countries in Europe.
Special Commissioner Kasson has been
working on this subject for some time
and the message deals with some of the
developments of negotiations already
had and expresses the hope of the ad
minstration to secure satisfactory
results in the future.
The policy of the administration on
this subject is outlined and, citing
French champagnes as an illustration,
the point is made that if special conces­
sions are given any foreign products
the United States must be given equal
treatment by reciprocal concessions.
The Alaskan problem is discussed at
aome length and a plea is made for con­
gressional legislation, including the ex­
tension of the operation of the public
land laws, and the granting of rights of
way for roads by which all parts of
the country may be made more accessi­
ble.
CONGRESS WILL DO NOTHING.
Chairman Walker's Opinion on Prospects
of Currency Iaegislrtion.
CHICAGO, Dec. 3.—A special from
Washington says: Representative
Walker of Massachusetts, chairman of
the house committee on banking and
currency, was asked, after a visit with
the president, what he thought of the
prospects for onrrency legislation. As
Mr. Walker is at the head of the com­
mittee which will have the matter in
charge, considerable significance is to
be attached to his reply, in which he
•aid:
"From my experience as chairman of
the banking and currency committee, I
should say that congress will do noth­
ing on the currency question."
ONE WAY TO ECONOMIZE.
Cangrnss May Skip the River and Harbor
Appropriation This Session.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. Chairman
Cannon of the house committee on ap­
propriations was with the president for
quite a time during the day discussing
the subject of receipts and expendi­
tures. Mr. Cannon would say nothing
as to the object of his visit, but re­
marked that it was very hard to cut ap­
propriations and that the greatest sav­
ing could be effected by not passing the
river and harbor bill at this session.
Many important works, he said, were
under the contraot system and many
others had money available tor work on
them. The fortifications appropria­
tion, he thought, could be kept down
also.
Import* of Sngar.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—The monthly
statement of the bureau of statistics
show that the total imports of dutiable
sugar during October last amounted to
182,998,945 pounds, valued at 13,643,613,
which is an increase over the Septem­
ber imports of nearly 73,000,000 pounds
and an increase in value of over $1,200,
600.

PUBLIC LANDS 11E1WT.
Annual Statement of Commission­
er of the General Land Office.
Number of Acres of Public l.nndu In
the Several StutcM mid Territo­
ries—Receipts from Snlcn Ag­
gregated $1,000,380.
Commissioner of the General Land
Office Binger Hermann has submitted
his annual report to the secretary of
the interior. Compared with the pre­
vious year it shows a decrease of 3,298
original homestead entries, aggregat­
ing 378,625 acres. In the entire dis­
posals of public land there was a falling
off of 5,370,400 acres. The area sold for
cash reached 419,052 acres anil miscella­
neous entries aggregated?,334,554 acres.
The receipts from disposal of public
lands amounted to $1,590,380 and from
the disposal of Indian lands, $138,710.
There were 32,087 agricultural patents
issued approximating 5,133.920 acres.
There were patented or certified with
the effect of patenting for the benefit
cf railroad companies, under congres­
sional grants, 5,101,969 acres, a decrease
of over 10,000,000 acres from the previ­
ous year.
Lists of lands selected by the several
states and territories under the grant
for educational purposes aggregated
739,417 acres. At the close of the year
there were pending railroad selections
embracing 11,436,809 acres.
An approximate estimate of the num­
ber of acres of public lands in the sev­
eral states and territories at the close of
the fiscal year is as follows:
Alabama, 532,339 Arizona, 54,400,211 Ar­
kansas, 3,P22,012 California, 43,841,04-1 Col­
orado, 40,037,204 Florida, 1.797.GG2: Idaho,

tana, 71,432,917 Nebraska, 10,669,353 Ne­
vada, 61,578,586 New Mexico, 56,983.047
North Dakota, 21.3S5.293: Oklahoma, 8,105.
238 Oregon, 35.S92.318: South Dakota, 13,
250,713 Utah, 44,205,070 "Washington, 17,958.
E36 Wisconsin, 454,107 Wyoming, 49,341,
ESS Alaska, 369,529,600 acrcs. The figures
above given do not include the vacant
land embraced in military timber and In­
dian reservations, reservoir SITS, tr-AF*
covered by selections, filings, railroad
grants, etc.
The mining industry reached its low­
est point during the past year, but is
now on the increase. In view of the ex­
pected filing of man j- locationsjncident.
to the opening- up of the Upper Yukon
district the commissioner favors the
establishment of another land district
in Alaska. Noting the fact that nu­
merous mining syndicates are already
in the field, competing for title to many
individual locations made on the rich
mineral discoveries in Alaska, it is rec­
ommended that the law be so amended
as to prohibit the including of more
than one lode claim or more than 100
acres of placer ground in a single appli­
cation or entry.
At the present timber dealers yearly
sweep vast quantities of timber
from the public lands in the in­
terest of speculations without pay­
ing a dollar to the government,
and conflagrations rage through
the public forests without government
effort to check destruction. The tim­
ber loss yearly from these sources, con­
servatively, runs up into the millions
of dollars. It is impracticable to pro­
tect and administer the forests upon
the public domain without provision
for the maintenance of a full local force
to supervise the timbered lands and ex­
ecute these laws.
Among the recommendations are: For
prompt action by congress to terminate
the suspension of Arkansas land
claims a change in the course of pro­
ceedings for the adjustment of mineral
lands modification of the law impos­
ing penalties for depredation of public
timber, and ample appropriations for
protecting and administering existing
and prospective forest reservations.

SUGAR INVIGORATES THE BODY.
Consumption of Small Quantity Suf­
ficient to Revive Tired Mn»cle».
Experiments of an interesting nature
have lately been made at the instiga­
tion of the Prussian war office to en­
deavor to decide the question as to
whether the consumption of small
quantities of sugar renders the tired
muscles capable of renewed exertion.
In order to obtain a practical result, the
person who was made the subject of the
experiment was kept totally ignorant
of the object of the experimenters. On
one day, says the New York Medical
Record, a sweet liquor was adminis­
tered, containing 30 grams of sugar
on the next day a similar liquid, con­
taining- a sufficient amount of sac­
charine to render it indistinguishable
from the other as regarded taste. Aft­
er a very large amount of muscular
work had been performed it was found
that better results could be obtained on
the days when the sugar was given than
on the days when saccharine was given.
The blood had become very poor in
sugar in consequence of the severe
muscular effort, and the administra­
tion of a comparatively small quantity
of sugar had a markedly Invigorating
effect.

TRADE WITH ENGLAND.
Consul at lilriiiliiKhuiit tilvow Inter*
ratlin
K'
nnd Slii'niOcunt
FIrui-cb.
Consul liarker at Birmingham, Eng­
land, in his annual report to the state
department, says that the one marked
development in that district during the
year has been the cycle trade. It has
been so great that there, has been a
great over-production. The trade with
the United States has not been greatly
affected because no complete bicycles
have been sent to the United States
since 1894. The British foreign trade in
bicycles amounted in 1895 to $0,747,012
in 1896 to $9,056,420, and in 1897 (esti­
mated), $7,877,375. So many men have
been drawn into bicycle making, thai
other branches of business have been
injured. An increase of ten per cent,
in the wages of skilled labor has re­
sulted, but a decline is expected for
various reasons including the intro­
duction and use of the best American
machinerj-. In the past two fiscal years
the exports from the United States to
the United Kingdom of cj-cles and partE
of cycles, was as follows:
For 1S96, $613,392 for 1897, $2,375,675.
Speaking of the general trade, the
consul says that exports of other manu­
factures, which show an increase, but
which are not classified by countries oi
destination, are brass goods, clocks and
watches, glass and glassware, lead and
its manufactures, steel rails, iron and
steel plates and sheets, wire, printing
presses, typewriters, nickel, tin and
zinc. An analysis, of the exports from
the United States shows an increase in
the articles mentioned in British col­
onies, especially in Canada and Aus­
tralasia. In addition United States man­
ufacturers are extending their trade in
cotton goods, leather, boots and shoes
and furniture in these markets which
the British manufacturer hitherto held,
lie says in the matter of typewriters
the people of the United Kingdom are
dependent upon the United States, as
there are no acceptable machines- of
British make.
OUR COAST DEFENSES.
Estimated of Their Cost for ISOS-OO—
it Ivor nnd Ilnrlior Improvements.
Gen. Wilson, cluet ot the engineers
of the army, lias made his annual report
to the secretary of war. It is devoted
to the fortifications and river and har­
bor improvements of the country. The
estimates for coast defenses for the
years 1S98-99 are as follows:
Gun and mortar batteries. $5,000,
000 purchase of land for fortifications,
$500,000 protection, preservation and
repair of fortifications, $100,000 prep­
aration of plans for fortifications, $5,
000 sea walls and embankments, $55,
000 torpedoes for harbor defense for
the purchase of submarine mines and
necessary appliances to operate them
for closing the channels leading to our
principal seaports for needful case­
mates, cable galleries, etc. to render it
possible to operate submarine mines,
$150,000.
Total, $5,810,000.
Gen.Wilson says thatduring the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1897, there was
expended on river and harbor improve­
ments, $13,461,659. For the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1899, his estimates are:
Continuous work authorized by con­
gress, $18,876,007 for other work not
provided for by continuing contracts,
$29,452,153.
HAVING FUN WITH A GROOM.
St. LouIm Man on Marriage Dent Finds
Ills BaKK'Se Decorated.
When Alexander Fyfe left St. Louis
a few days ago to meet his promised
bride in New York he thought he had a
sccret in his heart. But when Mr. Fyfe's
baggage arrived at the Pennsylvania
station in Jersey City he almost fainted
on beholding it.
The trunk was festooned from stem
to stern with white satin ribbons, with
here and there a placard. The placards
read: "My first night out." "Put ma
off at Greater New York," "Gone east
after a good thing," and "Purchased lor
the occasion*" This cheerful little joke
had been played on Mr. Fyfe by friend*
in the railroad office where he is em­
ployed. His trunk had been opened
and filled with miscellaneous junk
where there was room for it, and the
hardest kind of knots tied in his gar­
ments.
DESTROYS WATER PIPE.
Electric Currents Playing Havoc with
Atlanta'* Fluid Conductors.
The waterworks system of Atlanta*
Ga., is menaced by electrolysis.
For a long time past complaint has
been made to the water commissioners
of the undue size of water bills, and
an investigation by engineers shows
that the interior of the pipes convey­
ing water to dwellings from the mains
is being eaten out by the corrosive ef­
fect of the heavy electric currents from
trolley and electric light mains.
The pipes are so perforated that leak­
age occurs, and it is known that the
danger extends to the large mains. A
collapse of these is soon feared, and
unless ther city finds some method to
counteract the influence it will be com­
pelled to lay new pipes at an enormous
cost.
Po»t Offices.
There are 200,000 post offices In the
world enjoying organized facilities of
correspondence, and of this number 70,
000 are in the United States.

Along the Austrian shore of the Ad­

On the other hand, the number of the
fish has considerably decreased in re
cent years, and the price has risen ac
cordingly. In 1881 it was about $1.35
per 1,000, .while last year as much as
$3.15 was paid.
