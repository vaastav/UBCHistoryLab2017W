PROHIBITION ATTACKED.
Mr. Fitzgerald, ui Mr.s.achusettn, opposed
the amendment. "Unless w.j desire to act
K3 hy pocrites." said he. "we should vote
Uown thi3 amendment. It is impossible to
enforce prohibition in any portion of this
country or of the world. We cannot enlist
C3.!X) men for service in the Philippines cr
tnj whtrc tlto who can be made total ub
ttaimrs. We should seek to promote tem
perance .'n the way which will bring the
Vst result?. Mr. Fitzgerald concluded
tvith an attack on prohibition a it obtained
in Maine.
Mr. Crobvcnor, of Ohio, declared that
prohibition had been a failure wherever it
uad ben tried. Nevertheless, he ald, he
would vole for the amendment. If good
came t It he would thank (iod; if not. as
ho beiic-Vfd it would not. no harm would be
lione and CongreJ-s could eaidly retrace its
Iteps.
Air. SlayoVii, of Texa. who is a member
of the military committee, opposed the
amendment. If reason, and not hysteria,
was to control legislation, he saM. it would
be voted down, lie said that officers con
versant with the workings of the canteen
system were unanimous in indorsing it.
It was an influence for temperance.
Mr. Pearce, of Missouri, said he was pre
pared to assert that nothing would do so
much to break down true temperance in
the army as absolute prohibition.
Mr. Hay, of Virginia, believed It was
wrong for the government to engage in
the sale of liquor. He was opposed to
throwing temptation in the direct path of
young men who entered the army. He as
serted that the evidence of the army offi
cers was not altogether on one side of the
question. Applause.
Mr. Parker, of New Jersey, a member
of the military committee, opposed tho
amendment. The whisky-drinking army of
eld days of the sutler and post trader,
had become a temperate army, under tho
canteen system. , Desertions In the seven
years before the canteen system were
double those for the same time afterward.
The same figures hold good for convictions
for drunkenness.
After some further debate, Mr. Dick, of
Ohio, in favor of the amendment, and
Mr. Bartholdt, of Missouri, against. Mr.
Littleneld closed the debate on the amend
ment and defended prohibition In Maine,
which, he Insisted, made for morality ana
temperance.

Many members of the W. C..T..U. were
tn the gallery and loudly applauded the
resolution.
Mr. Fitzgerald then proposed an amend
ment to prohibit the pale of liquor in the
Capitol building, but Mr. Hull made the
point of order that the amendment was
not germane, and was sustained.
Mr. Williams, of Mississippi, asked unani
mous consent that Mr. Fitzgerald be al
lowed to offer his amendment.
"I object." said Mr. Shattuck. of Ohio.
Soon afterwards the bill was reported
from committee of the whole and adopted

the sermon, clear and forceful, and yet
withal fearfully scathing, preached by Rev.
Wohl in his church last Sunday. Mr. Stokes
Is to-night improving, and it Is now ex
pected that he will recover, although his
escape from death was exceedingly nar
row. His coat, upon investigation, was
found with no less than three holes in it,
which shows that Rev. Wohl fired at least
four shots. It now turns out that Mr.
Stokes fired oftener, than was at first sup
posed. Mr. Wohl was found to be wounded
In the shoulder. From this it is evident
that after the first fatal bullet he wheeled
and was shot in the back.
The Rev. Wohl, in his sermon, depict

without exception every woman, married

REPUBLICAN METHODS VINDICATED.
Good lteult of the Recount of Ballots
in Tipton County.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
TIPTON, Ind., Dec. 6. After the recent
election tho Democrats brought contest
proceedings against James N. Richards,
recorder-elect, and David M. Wheatley,
county assessor-elect, alleging that there
were a number of tickets which were cast
for the defeated candidates and not
counted. Yesterday the election bags were
opened In the Commissioners' Court and
it was found that about forty mutilated
tickets were uncounted, in one-fourth of
which the political complexion of the voter
could not be determined, and the remainder
about equally divided between the two par
ties, thus giving neither the advantage in
the recount. This morning the commis
sioners rendered a verdict in favor of the
Republicans in both cases. A motion for an
apieal to the Circuit Court was at once
made in the case of the county assessor,
but was abandoned in the case of the
recorder.
Both Democrats and Republicans who
witnessed the recount agreed that it was
the fairest election ever held In the county
and that every candidate got the benefit of
every vote that was cast for him, except
where the mutilations threw them out by
law. All the Inspectors were Republicans,
and it was the Intention to prove that the
Democrats did not have a fair show, but
the tickets so convinced all that saw them,
that tho appeal proceedings are being dis
couraged. It was a vindication and victory
for the Republicans.
I3IPOIITANT INJUNCTION SUIT.
On It Depends the Vnlne of Ten Thon
saud Acren of Land.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
V I NC E N N ES, Ind., Dec. C An Injunc
tion suit Is now pending In the Knox coun
ty Circuit Court, upon the result of which
the value of $100,000 worth of real estate
depends. Land owners of Decker township,
this county, petitioned the County Commis
sioners to dig a ditch along the line of the
Evansville & Terre Haute Railway, from
Purcells to Decker, a distance of about six
miles, and to build a levee along the west
bank of White river from the E. & T. II.
Railway, at Decker, to Dicksburg hills,
about three miles in length. The object of
the proposed ditch is to carry away a por
tion of overflow water from RJver Puchee,
In time of flood, to White river. The levee
along White river would prevent overflow
from that stream.
After the drainage commissioners had re
ported favorably the County Commission
ers overruled a remonstrance filed by the
Evansville & Terre Haute Railway Com
pany and certain property owners of Gib
son county, opposite Decker. The work was
ordered Jo be done. The remonstrants ap
pealed to the Circuit Court and securtd a
temporary injunction, during the pendency
of the case.
The E. & T. II. Railroad Company avers
that the ditch would divert River Duchee
from its natural course and endanger the
company's roadbed; and further, that to
build a levee on one sido of White river
would increase the volume of water on the
opposite side of the stream in times of
floods and thereby endanger the roadbed.
On the Gibson county side of White river
the E. & T. II. Railroad nas a long and
high embankment, which has caused the
company no end of trouble and many thou
sands of dollars expense. It was there that
the roadbed washed away about two years
ago and caused the plunge of a passenger
train, one night, into tho flood. Several
lives were lost in that disaster and two or
three coaches were swept away, no part of
one of which was ever round. Several land
owners possessing real estate in White
river bottoms, opposite Decker, also oppose
the levee and have become parties in the
remonstrance. The petitioners claim that
ten thousand acres of land would be bene
fited by the ditch and levee. They say that
the land would be worth ij an acre, where
as It 13 now practically worthless.
The motion was argued, this week, be
fore Judge Cobb, who has the issues under
advisement.

Wednesday appearing before the County
Commissioners with the expectation that an
election would be called to vote the road a

from a dozen of the signers of the C. R.

withdrawn from the petition. The. C, R.

THE GOLD STANDARD ACT.
Congress Asked to Reinforce It by
Placing All Money on Equality.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6. The New York
Chamber of Commerce adopted the follow
ing resolutions to-day:
"Whereas, In the various discussions in
relation to the gold standard made during
the late presidential campaign it became
evident that the action, of Congress in
March of this year, declaring for tne gold
standard ancrproviding for the redemption
or payment in gold of United States notes
and treasury notes, made no provision for
making as good as gold the silver currency
of the country, and owing to this fact
grave fears were entertained lest the acces
sion to administration of a party com
mitted to the free coinage of silver might
be followed by an attempt to lorce the
country upon a silver bais in advance of
any legislation to that effect;
'Resolved. That the Chamber of Com
merce of the State of New York respect
fully request and urge upon Congress the
vital importance of adopting at the present
session a bill authorizing and directing the
secretary of the treasury to exchange gold
coin for any other money issued or coined
by the United States whenever it may be
necessary to do so."

bo drawn from the mass of documents is
the eagerness of tho Ca pc Dutch to take up

brother of P. J. Bllgnaut. secretary of the
