' Congress convened Monday. The
President's message is a lengthy doc
ument. In discussing the tariff ques
tion he descends to shallow dema
gogism and demonstrates his utter in
ability to discuss such a question from
a statesman-like standpoint. He
even descends to anarchical commu
nistic arguments. The New Yory
Press well says :
"For a man elected to the office of
Chief Magistrate by the suppression
of votes and intimidation and murder
of voters in many States of the solid
South to thus arraign the business
and manufacturing interests of the
country and impeach the integrity of
those who have led far more useful
lives than he himself has, is, to say
the least, a superb exhibition of igno
rant impudence tinctured with the
wrath of defeat.
The scramble for post-office struck
this place last Friday, when H. P.
Chase, the present assistant postmas
ter, was out with a petition and per
sonally solicited signers. In this, as
a matter of course to all acquainted
with the petition business, he was
quite successful. As to what he is
going to do with it we are not advis
ed. Undoubtedly postmaster God
dard has been induced to resign and
that resignation and this petition is to
go in together, but whether at once
or after the new administration comes
in, we do not know, orcare. In view
of the fact, however, that Mr. Chase,
when Harrison was nominated, hung
out a Cleveland flag on one side of
his door and a Harrison banner on
the other side ; and that he kept Dem
ocratic literature, including the
. ''Grindstone turner," on a desk ac
cessible to the public, we would sug
gest that his documents be sent in at
once so that he can receive his ap
pointment from a reform and non
partisan administration." :'

Letters from the People.
Editor Sfler: I notice in your is
sue of Nov, 8, an extraordinary chal
lenge to me, in person, by Mr. G. K.
Davis of this place. It seems to be
given with the same assurance of suc
cess as the 100 to 75 upon Cleveland.
His ridiculous challenge I will ac
cept upon condition that he himself
will take the trouble to And the man
willing to mire himself up iu such a
matter; and that, at the same time,
the following questions be also decid
ed i
Was the post-office here removed
from our good old deacon as a matter
of public policy, or of private, cunning
aud deceitful, democratic influence?
What became of all of those split
democratic county tickets with straight
Republican headings, but with "G
K. Davis" substituted for Sheriff?
Why didn't they use them iustead of
pilfering Republican tickets?
Did the Democrats sell off all their
votes for Representative in order to
gaiu support for Mr. Davis for Sher
iff? If not why did they not set up a
candidate of their own ?
Did G. K. Davis cause to be in
serted iu the Beuuiugton County Re
former, in an article charging his Re
publican opponent with all manner of
crimes and irregularities, a regular
signed certificate testifying to his own
personal excellence ?
Upon the evening before election,
did he and his conferree, Btanding in
front of the pulpit at a Democratic
rally, spend fifteen minutes in vile
personal abuse of a person for pre
senting, by permission, telegrams
from certain prominent Republicans
denying their assertion that they had
offered Mr. Davis their support?
Have the Republicans of Benning
ton county an equal right with the
Democrats to have bosses, and which
clan of bosses bossed the best ?
Is it proper for a man who has been
a chronic candidate himself every e
Iection for years ; who has never hes
itated to go around aud boldly elec
tioneer for himself ; who has, time
aud again, taken, with his owu hands,
regular Republican county tickets,
and after himself insertiug his own
name upon them, offer them for sup
port ; is it proper for such a person to
charge another with acting in view
for office ?
In a regular battle and clan fight
should the whipped dog growl aud
whine, or crawl back iuto his kennel,
lick his sores and be quiet?

Silk Threads In Bank Note.
The paper on which bank notes are
printed is called "distinctive paper," be
ing used exclusively by the government
for the printing of bonds and current
notes. Tho mills where it is manufac
tured are at Ulen Falls, West Chester
county, Perm. An agent of the treasury
department receives the paper direct
from the hands of tho manufacturer, and
every precaution is observed in order to
prevent any loss. Short scraps of red
silk are mixed with the liquid pulp in an
engine.
The finished material is conducted to a
wire cloth without passing through any
screens, which might retain the silken
threads. An arrangement above the wire
cloth scatters a shower of fine scraps of
blue silk thread, which falls upon the
paper while it is being formed. The side
on which the blue silk is deposited is used
for the back of notes, and the threads are
so deeply imbedded as to remain perma
nently fixed. Each sheet is registered as
soon as it is made. Behoboth Sunday

A House Built of Paper.
There is a paper house in Atlanta. No
wood, brick, iron or other material is
used about the building. At 108 Decatur
street a neat little store, painted sky
blue, has attracted considerable atten
tion recently. The gaudy color is not
the cause of the little building being the
object of so much attention, but the ma
terial of which it is constructed makes
it a novelty. It is made entirely of paper.
The store was built by a Frenchman
named Smith (spelled, of course, in a
French way), who is agent for the paper
of which it is constructed. The rafters,
tho weatherboarding, the roof and the
flooring are all made of thick, compressed
paper boards, impervious to water and
as durable as wood. The house cannot
catch on fire as easily as a wooden build
ing, because the surface of the paper is
smooth and hard. The building is used
as a store by Neal Kelly, who says he
finds it warm in cool weather and com
fortable when the weather is warm. At

JH7. Editor: i will now for the
benefit of a long sutferen puMick and
my dimercratio fiends, giuerally, try
ami disci ibe, frum adimercratic stan
pint, a must disshameful event, which
will go down tu all cumin generations
as the Smith-Barber episode. It was
concernin' a bet which was made as
tu which wood be elected, our noble
president Cleveland or that barbarian,
Harrisou. Well as it proved out
great head was defeuted, through no
fault uv his. No man livin ever wan
ted wurs, and we did all we cood for
him but it was no use ; if it hed not
bin for the people not wuntiu him
he'd been Mected. So it was our co
worker, brother Smith, hed to wheel
this Barbado Theoder tu East Ja-
meekv and the nite uv the 20th was
appinted for it tu cum off. I hapen
ed tu be that- so I posted myself onto
the hotel steps tu see the percessliun.
Thur was nuthin' but a lot uv boys
an old men an' others uv all ages be
tween. They was expectin' Wind
ham Drum Corps but, Lord tliey now
ed better than to be caught in sich
company. Well on they cum, burin'
torches j jist ahead uv me was sum
thin' which looked as if it mite hev
bin a resusticated Egiptin mummy
stolen from the arkives uv Asia, but
i found out that he was the local mu-
sishun. He had a red bandana tied
over one shoulder an a anshent sword
tied onto himself by some sheep
twine, and carried an old fiddle onto
which he played, they called him Cur
tis, and he constituted a band, be
mite hav bin George William but
thev sed he was a republican ; next
cum the wheelbarrow with its repub
lican frate, and "Moses" awheelin it
Aron and Hur assistin' to hold up his
hands, each had a holt on the wheel
barrow ; along close to em cum anoth
er man which 1 shood judge was a
prohibitionist or an ex-preacher or
something of that sort, he carried a
big tu gallon jug iuto which was the
ile which they greased the wheels with ;
next cum a lot uv bovs with banners
with picture on to 'em. one was a
piuttir of our dear president pictured
as a dog with a tin can tied to his tail
(the dog's tail i mean), onto which
said "free trade," and thev had start
ed him for buffalo. The band kept
all the time plavin'. Aron was a
dimercrat and Hur was a republican,
what he wanted tu help fur was more
than i cood see unless it was fur the
sake uv the wheel grease, they had
tu stop and ile up evry few minutes.
1 went along with 'era although my
feelings was stung Uu think uv the
contrast between now and 4 years a
go, yet there was to be found some
uv the same fluid that we had then.
One house on the way was beautiful
ly luminated and wood looked good if
it had been a dimeiciatie rally, it be
longed tu Mr. Geo. Washington, the
band kep all the time playin', and the
sweat runin' down Moses les. When
we arove at the depo at east jameeky
there was a big stone where a dimer
crat had spit on to it and a republican
was try in to set that spit on fire to
make a lumination. That's the way
them repubs try tu utilize all they can
git out uv us, (that's the way they did
with Lord Sackville's letter,)but it
woodent burn, was watered too much
at townshend. Findin' that it wood
not burn he jumped on the depo step
and shouted "thre cheers for Harri
son and Morton." i shut my mouth
for once, and says i to myself they'll
git no yell out of me for old Harri
son. A fresh supply of ile was re
ceived when the train cum in, and
the depo man opened a barrel of
crackers and says, "boys help yirself"
Yes here was my chance, and i took
in consideration all the evil the repub
licans had brung upon us, how this
very chap had wanted a post-office
thar and probably wood have it soon
a thing which is not needed as there
is only 50 or 60 families it wood ac
comerdate ennyway and they be all
republicans and dont ought to have
enny mail, yes with all these thoughts
in my mind i made a rush for that
cracker barl, and i filled all my pock
ets, my boot legs and my shurt buzi.n
and i think the most uv our boys wer
filled with sum feelin uv retaliation
onto the republicans. By this time the
wheel grease got in its work and they
cheered that cracker fellow, the depo,
the cars and evry thing thur was thur
Tnen we started back. The bnnd
kep all the time playin. i don't know
who the st lf-appinted Capt. was but
there was features about him that led
me to believe he was a dimocrat. We
stopt on the way to cheer when i
herd a deep drawn sigh at my left,
such as a hen wood giv if choked, and
looking around ther i seed the Capt.
a lyin in the the ditch on bis back
with bis feet turned up to the moon,
i looked up to the moon oh, how
small it looked, not so big as a five
cent nickle so dim and far away
more than a thousand miles, and the
stars were all dancing right hand
pokys. Shortly alter gitting tu the
village and arter lots more cheerin,
and arter the band fell over the Capt.
and broke some uv thur instruments,
the percesshun broke up. i went off
with a chap what showed me a bottle
by which i nowed he was a fiend.
Thur was a dance that nite but
none uv onr bovs attended, the floor
tu the ball was tu uneven But we
will show em in 1892, hurrah !

STOLEN DIAMONDS
SOME CURIOSITIES OF THE SOUTH
AFRICAN TRAFFIC IN ILLICIT GEMS.
scheme, and Artlfleee of That Rascally
Fraternity, the "I. U. B." How Stolen
Stone. Reach Europe Some Interesting
gtorlea The Dying Digger.
Dr. Matthews, an English practitioner
who siient many years in the diamond
field or South Africa, has just published
in England a book on the subject. An
interesting part of his book is that which
deals with the development of the great
diamond digging industry, and the
schemes and artifices of that rascally
fraternity, the I. D. B.,or Illicit diamond
buyers. There is a saying that five years
hi South Africa la lutllcient to corrupt
the most immaculate, and that a man
who has lived there for seven should not
be behoved upon his oath. Dr. Matthews'
revelations certainly give color to the
saying. According to his account, the
larger part of the community of Kimlier
lev is mixed up in this uefarious traffic
Diamonds, as most people will be
aware, are sorted out of dianiondifcrous
stuff by native "hands." Some of these
hands are probably in the pay of tho fra
ternity. A fine stone is turned up by one
of them when nobody is looking, lie
seizes it, hides it in his hair, in his mouth,
or in some other portion of his person.
Or if a goat he handy he twists it in Ida
wool, and tends the animal affectionately
till an opportunity occurs of redeeming
the stone. Or, perchance, he conceals it
behind a rock, or forces it down the
throat of a dog, or, Homeric device, he
swallows it himself . The gem being re
stored to the light of day from hiding
place, whatever it may have been ana
many a diamond now sparkling on a
lady s neck has made acquaintance with
the stomach of a Kafir the dusky thief
In due course puts himself in communi
cated with another native of a superior
class. This man is a tout in the pay of a
low white man a "mean white," as he
is called in the colonies. i
HOW IT IS DONE. I
The tout buys the stone for, let.us say,
a hundredth part of its value, aid the
thief spends the money in the vile drink
which it is the peculiar pride of civil
ization to supply to the unsophisticated
savage, and, so far as he is concerned,
there is an end of the transaction. Then
the tout carries the stone to the "mean
white" and receives from him a svn of
money, perhaps double what ha has
given to the actual thief. The "mean
white" in his turn takes it to the licensed
buyer of diamonds, who is possibly a
person of glaring and even aggressive
respectability a church warden or a
member of the municipality, or at least
a merchant of good antecedent and
from him receives perhaiK a tenth part
of the worth of the gem. So far so
good; but still there are slips between
the cup and the lip, aud it is sometimes
found difficult to convey the stuff tut of
the country to the final receiver in )Lon
don. To this end many artiiices a)e re
sorted to. Innocent looking fovling
pieces, on examination, have been lOund
to be loaded with diamonds to within an
inch of the muzzle, while such depos
itories as novels with holes cut d the
leaves, the quills of ostrich feathen and
boots with hollow heels are not uncom
mon. Often the fair sex are found to b use
ful auxiliaries in these adventure), for
there is a peculiar sacredness ablut a
lady's underclothing that appeals f the
mind of the customs officer. Th man
would be bold who merely ventured on
her back hair. However this nay be,
by far the greater number of stales so
procured arrive safely in Europe, i Most
people will naturally think that ie na
tive rascal who takes the stone is cspon
eible for this state of things, but itis not
the case. The native never dreaned of
stealing diamonds until he was taightto
thieve by the white receiver of stolen
goods. i :
SOME INTERESTING 8TORIESJ
Dr. Matthews tells some intenetlng
tales of tho I. D. B. f ratensjjji"! the
dead of a Certain -' r-jn .rTTT
he was roused from sleep and conf lmtod
by a trembling and middle aged 6 tizen
of the fields, who informed him tlat he
had swallowed a thirty carat dianond
and two sovereigns just to shoV his
friends how the scoundrels did t, and
was now anxious to be rid of,' these
foreign substances, which had pesum
ably begun to disagree. Ultimately
they were recovered, and the jiappy
citizen departed with the dianond,
leaving tho gold in payment. Of tourse
this man had disposed of the ditmond
under imminent fear of dctectioi; but
why he took the two sovereigns itis dif
ficult to say, unless it was to g.t his
hand in. Some people, by thei way,
appear to be able to swallow very large
stones, for so lately as last year, a tative
upg uuuer auspicious circumstances,
stone found in his stomach.
Here is another tale, A white gentle
man lived with a pretty Fingo wunan,
who also acted as his agent i the
"trade." He fell ill of fever, anl for
weeks lay in a state of delirium, between
life and death. She nursed him teiderly
through it all, and, what is morej kept
up his connection with the "bovi;" so
that when he came to himself shi was
enabled to present him with hundrtds of
carats of fine b tones. And now, mark
the sequel. No sooner was he strong
enough than ho departed for Europe,
taking every gem and farthing sht had
collected with him, and leaving th un
fortunate girl to starve on the sttects.
On a certain occasion Dr. Matthew was
called in to attend a dying digger j who
had once worked a claim for him. These
were tho words that greeted him t hen
he told the man that there was no lope:
"Doctor, I cannot die without tiling
you how, when I worked your claln in
No. 6, 1 robbed you of nearly all your
diamonds." V
In tho face of stories such as these and
a mass of other evidence, it is sometimes
dillicult not to believe that civilization is
a failure and that the educated Chrutian
man, except under very exceptional cir
cumstances and when restrained by the
strictest pressure of law, is a lower ani
mal at heart than the savage he despises
and destroys with drink and ride bul
lets. The Argonaut i

plantation ot two acres In tha far off and

Three mornings every week Lea Fong

coling to any great extent They supply
Chinese vegetable to the Chinese store
keepers in Mott, Pell and Bayard streets,
and to Mr. Yuet Sing, who maintains the
big grocery under the Josa house at No,
10 Chatham square. These Chinese vege
tables all come from seeds that Fong and
Foo imported from China last winter
when they made up their minds that
farming was the proper thing for them to
try. They are called "ong qua," "la qua"
and "bait toi." The principal customer of
the Lee Brothers' Agricultural company
(limited), is a modest young gentleman
named Ah Moy, who does business on
the curbstone on Mott street, in the heart
of the Chinese quarter. He is a coy
youth and an honest. He is afraid to
answer many questions about himself or
nis vegetables, nut be deals Honestly
with his customers and gives them fair
weight. No kind of food is sold among
the Chinese by measure or by count
Everything is bought by weight.
An artist did some quiet marketing In
order to establish confidential relations
with the proprietor, whose chief charac
teristic was a perpetual tendency to say
"aik' cent pound to every question that
was asked him. Every one of his vege
tables, Including a big invoice of sugar
cane from Louisiana and some New York
state apples, was held at that figure. He
weiL'neu everything he sold on a aualnt
old fashioned scale, whose rod was ma
hogany, very old and much polished by
long friction. The chances are that with
it Mov's ancestors weighed out food to
Soo Chow cith.3n8 long before the United
States were heard of. The weight is a
clumsy hunk of rusty Iron, and the di
visions of weight are indicated along the
rod by hundreds of fine brass nails, which
are driven so skillfull v that the rod is not
cracked anywhere, the vegetables sold
oy An Moy attract large crowds of China
men every morning after Lee Fong has
driven sway. The greatest of all these
is ong qua. which is a. saussh with odd
convolutions and of weird, grayish green
coloring. There is a bloom on it like the
oioom on a peach, and its rind is very
tender. "Him good to cook," explained
Ah Moy. "Cook, boil, belly nice to eat
an' good for pickle."
La qua and cha qua are distant rela
tives of ong qua. Cha qua is a cucumber
covered with furry spines and about four
times as big as our ordinary gherkins, it
is boiled and eaten bke squaw or pickled
with spices. La qua is a small squash
much used for the making of sweetmeats.
It is candied and put away dry in boxes,
like candied ginger. Bak toi is an odd
sort of vegetable. To an American it is
a combination of cabbage, celery and
cauliflower. Ah Moy savs, "You cook
him, fry a little or boil." which are prob
ably as good as any other ways of serving
oaa toi. i ne neart ot the vegetable is line
the heart of the cauliflower. Its stalks are
white and resemble celery stalks, and at
the top they broaden out into a very fair
imitation of a cabbage leaf.
There is another variety of toi known
as gai toi. This id like the other, with
the exception that ils stalks are green.
It is used for boiling, cabbage fashion,
and is also put in soup like okra. The
sugar cane, called gam chiah, is a fine
thing for a man to eat who wants to have
luck, ran tan players are very fond of
it The cane may be eaten raw, but it is
best pickled and fried in lard. All of

The Pretty Girl of Richmond.
People who have gone to the exposi
tion at Richmond speak of the many
handsome women seen in the crowds
there. This observation is no doubt well
founded. Richmond is a very provincial
city in many respects, but she is metro
politan if not cosmopolitan in the beauty
of her women, if this meant that the
beauty of her women is unsurpassed.
There are no pre-eminent belles in Rich
mond now as there were in the days
closely following the war, when Mattie
uuid transnxed with both her wit and
beauty everybody she met, but what has
been lost in individual celebrities has
been more than made up in a great multi
tude of wonderfully attractive women.
Many ol them are blondes. 1 here is a

country. This comes naturally and
lawfully from their English ancesti-v.
There is very little of the Spanish or
French intermixture found In Virginia,
and hence the Creole type of beauty is
rarely seen in the state. The world
runs after blondes nowadays, especially
after blonde or golden hair; and such
hair as the Richmond women have! It
is a special connection of the genial
southern sun, and is as distinct m its
beauty as the golden leaf tobacco for
which Virginia is so celebrated. If a

Why She Woji a Heroine.
We were running down from Charles
ton to Savannah, and the train was hum
ming along at high speed, when the
danger signal blew and the airbrakes
were put on hard. As tho train stopped
all the passengers piled out to see what
waa the trouble, and wo soon discovered
that a culvert around the short curve
had been washed out. A negro woman
had flagged the train with a wbite apron.
and of course we all looked upon her as
a heroine.
"When did you discover that the cul
vert had goner' I asked.
"Jist about half an hour ago."
"And your first thought was to stop
the train'r" .
"Ye3, sah."
"Well, vou are a brave woman. We
owe our lives to you."
"Does ye? I nebber thought of that."
"But you stopped the train."
"Yes, sah, but 1 didn't want ilat bnll-
