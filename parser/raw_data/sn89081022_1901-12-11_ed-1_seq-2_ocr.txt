Washington, Dec. 3.—The opening
day of the first session of the Fifty
seventh congress in the house of
representatives furnished a spectacle
that delighted the crowded galleries.
The machinery of the house is cum
brous, and is set in motion by a la
borious process, but the spectators
evidently did not consider it tedious,
as they clung to their places
which lasted 4y, hours, probably half
the time being consumed in the mo
notonous calling of the roll.
Sworn in as Speaker.
The organization of the house was
accomplished according to time-hon

FAVOR NICARAGUA ROUTE.
Report of Isthmian Canal Commis
sioner Sent to Congress—E«tl
timate of Expense.
Washington, Dec. 5.—The report of
the isthmian canal commission was
sent to congress Wednesdaj. The
commission, as anticipated several
weeks ago, favors the Nicaragua
route and makes an estimate of $189,
864,063 as the total cost of construc
tion of the canal through Nicaragua.
The estimated cost of the Panama
loute is $144,233,35S, but, the report
soj s, it would cost $109,141,000 to ob
tain the Panama concession. The
commission value the work done at
$40,000,000.
The report sajs the Panama route
is feasible as a sea level canal while
the Nicaragua route must be bj' locks,
but Lake Nicaragua will furnish an in
exhaustible supply of water for the
canal. The Nicaragua route has no
natural harbors at either end, but sat
isfactory harbors may be constructed.
Harbors already e\*st at each end of
the Panama route, but considerable
work must be done at the entrance of
the harbor on the Atlantic side.
With adequate force and plant the
commission estimate that the Nicara
gua canal can be completed in siv
yeais, exclusive of two jears for
preparation. Ten jears is estimated
to complete the Panama. The total
length of the Nicaragua route is 163.66
miles and the Panama route 49.09
miles.
The .estimated cost of operating and
maintaining the Nicaragua eanal an
nually is $1,350,000 greatei than that
of the Panama canal. The estimated
time for a deep draught vessel to pass
through the Panama canal is 12 hours
and through Nicaragua canal 33 hours.
The Nicaragua route, the report
says, is more advantageous for com
merce save that oiiginating on the
west coast of South America. For the
gulf ports the advantage is two days,
and for most, of the ports on the At
lantic and Pacific one day. The
Nicaragua route is said to be better
for sailing vessels on account of favor
ing winds. Hygienic conditions also
favor Nicaragua.

Extract* from the Report of Secre
tary Gage—Lergrc Surplus
for tlie Year.
Washington. Dec 5—Secretary Gage,
of the treasury department, Wednesday
submitted to congress his annual report
on the nation's finances for the year end
ed June 30, 1901 In the period covered
by the report the revenue of the gov
ernment from all sources aggregated
$699 316 530.92 and the total experditures
were $621.598 546 54, leaving a surplus
the treasury June 30 of $77,717,984 38.
According to the report there was in
the redemption division of the treasury
November 15, 1901, $150 000,000 in gold com
and bullion The available cash balance
in the treasury at that date was $717,017,
610.
On the working of the last national
bank law the report says
"The national currency bill became law
February 25, 1863, but was repealed and
reenacted with material amendment on
June 2, 1864 Under the provisions of the
former act 488 national banking associa
tions were organized and under the lat
ter 4,971 The act of March 14, 1900,
which authorized the incorporation of na
tional banking associations witr min
imum capital of $25,000 in towns with
population not exceeding 3,000, resulted
in the organization of 429 banks of that
class up to June 30, 1901, making a total
of 5,888 organizations under these three
acts up to the close of the year On
July 1, 1901, there were in active opera
tion 4,178 national banking associations,
with capital stock ot $647,686,695. During
the existence of the system 1326, or
about 22 5 per cent, of the associations
were placed in voluntary liquidation, and
384, or 6 5 per cent, in charge of receiv-
"During the fiscal year 411 banks, with
aggregate capital of $20 517,000. were or
ganized, 37, with capital of $8,970,000
placed in voluntary liquidation, and 12,
with capital of $1,860,000, placed in charge
of receivers. Subsequently to the close of
the ear one of the 12 associations was
placed in a solvent condition and permit
ted to resume The authorized capital
stock of the banks In existence on June
30, 1800, was $627,503,093 In addition to
the capital of banks organized during
the year, old associations increased their
stock to the extent of $12,921,800"
Secretary Gage reviews at length the
Russian sugar bounty case, holding that
the ruling made last winter was the
most equitable that the department could
devise in th^ interest of all parties
The secretary urges a modification o£
the currencv and national banking laws
He lavs down three principles upon which
he bases his recommendations:
1 The United States treasury should be
relieved ot its responsibility and burden
of redeeming the greenbacks in gold and
the burden transferred to the national
l^on Ire
2. National banks should be permitted
to issue circulating notes to the full
amount of paid-in capital upon deposit
of 30 per cent of the amount of the
capital in United States bonds and 20
per cewt. of the capital in United States
legal tender notes.
3 The obligations of the government
to pay the notes of insolvent banks
should be rescinded.
In support of his recommendations Sec
retary Gage points to the fact that a
diminishing volume of government bonds
will soon make it impossible for national
banks to secure a basis for circulating
notes.
According to the report touching immi
gration the arrivals of aliens for the
ear aggregated 562,868. Of that number

THE INSULAR CASES.
Important Decisions Handed Down
by Supreme Court.

Government iKunt Repay Duties Col
lected on Import* from Philip
pines—Customs Levied Against
Porto Rico Are Legal.
Washington, Dec. 3.—Porto Kico and
the Philippines became domestic terri
tories immediately upon the ratifica
tion of the treaty of peace. The con
stitution followed the flag to all of the
islands, and they immediately became
territories of the United States.
Duties levied in this country against
the products of those islands under the
Dingley law were illegal and must be
returned, but merely because of the
failure of congress to act. The islands
never have been foreign since the
treaty of peace.
The power of congress to pass laws
for the regulation of the territories is
unrestricted. It comes from the con
stitution itself.
The Foraker act, providing civil gov
ernment for Porto Rico, is constitu
tional. The duties it levied in the
United States and Porto Kico alike
were legally collected beeause they
were imposed by an act passed in pur
suance of the constitutional right of
congress to govern the territories as it
sees fit.
All duties collected on goods between
the United States and the Philippines
under the Dingley tariff are illegal, be
cause the Dingley tariff specifically
fixes duties on goods coming 1 om for
eign countnes, whereas the Philip
pines are domestic
Congrress Can Provide Tariff.
The right of congi ess to legislate for
the government of the Philippines is
affirmed, and under that right a special
tariff can be provided by congress at
San Francisco and at Manila on goods
going in either direction.
The Philippines are in exactly the
same condition as Porto Kico was
just prior to the passage of the For
aker act. As soon as congress legis
lates for the Philippines those islands
can have free trade or otherwise with
the United States or with other coun
tries, as congress sees fit.
These general principles embodv
the sum and substance of the two im
portant decisions handed down in the
supreme court Monday.
Will Result in Legislation.
The immediate result of the decisions
will be the passage of a law bj con
gress establishing a form of civil gov
ernment, no matter how simple, for
the Philippine islands, and establish
ing tariffs on goods entering the is
lands from the United States or else
where The same act will provide for
the collection of taxes in the United
States on the products of the Philip
pines, and those will not be at the Ding
ley rates, but at such rates as congress
shall fix. The new law will be in its
general principles the same as the
tariff features of the Foraker act, be
cause it will provide and must pro
vide under the ruling of the court that
the taxes levied on goods brought
from the Philippines shall be used for
the government of these islands and
shall not be turned into the treasury
at all
