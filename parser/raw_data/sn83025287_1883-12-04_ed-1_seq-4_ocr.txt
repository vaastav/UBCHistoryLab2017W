SUBSCRIPTION PRICE REDUCED. !
t
The "Globe" Hereafter to be Fur- '
nished at Lower Rates and the Qual
ity as Well as Quantity Improved. \
Readers of tho Globe have been frankly ■
advised of the tendency among the leading 1
papers to reduce their rates to the public, t
This course, for some time, has been '
inevitable. The price of news
papers had not, until recently, '
been reduced since the advance which
took place during the war. Nearly ever} -
thing else has suffered a decline, but news
papers have stood at one dollar per month,
the same as in 18G5. There was some
reason for the retention of "war prices," as
. labor has increased r3ther thsn
declined, and additional expen
ditures - for news have betn
enormous. It was on these accounts,
doubtless, that tho decline has been so
long delayed.
The Glob" has,however, decided to meet
tho popular demand for cheaper newspa
pers, without impairing the quality of the
paper. In fact, it will be greatly improved
in every respect, no labor or expense being
spared to make it still
more complete as a news
paper than it has been. With the intro
duction of its new perfecting press the
Globe will be increased in size to an ex
tent equal to the addition of five of its
present columns. The plans for addi
tional news service, which cannot be fully
developed until onr new quarters and new
press facilities are available, are simply
immense, far surpassing anything
heretofore attempted in this locality.
Ail of this we hope to have
duly inaugurated early in January, when
our new thirty thousand dollar press, with
n capacity of producing fifteen thousand
newspapers per hour, is set in operation.
To reduce the price of a newspaper and
correspondingly cheapen the subject mat
ter it affords, would by no means be ap
predated, but when coupled with the re
duction, improvement in every department
takes place, we feel sure the movement will
• b3 welcomed.
. The publishers of the Globe have, ac
cordingly decided, notwithstanding the
increase in size and quality proposed, to
make the price of the paper, on and after
December 1, I»S3, EIGHT DOLLARS
PER YEAR, for seven issues per week,
delivered .by carrier, and SIX DOL
LARS PER YEAR for six issues per week,
(Sunday's issue omitted) sent by mail.
As a liist class newspaper is thus placed
within the reach of all, it is trusted that
the circulation of the Globe will only be
limited by the population .within its
geographical radius.
The following are the rates, in detail on
and after Dec. 1, 1883:

An investigation was recently made by
the Philadelphia Times into the direction
from which the western states and terri
tories had received their population. The
general credit of this is given to New
England, but the Times wf.s surprised to
discover, as the result of it? : inquiries, that
the wealth and development of the west
were attributable in a larger degree
to the south than to the
eastern states. Unfortunately our census
compilers do not take the trouble to give
the descent of the inhabitants of the
I United . States,. as is done by the British
government. The Canadian census states
in detail the number of residents of that
country who had French or English or
Scotch or other ancestors, and information
.; of ; that kind ■ regarding the population of
this country would be of great value in the
':elucidation',-of- : many important social
problems. Tie New Orleans Democrat
publishes scene statistics . on the
subject, jnV. reference ■-/ to : {he
___ - ' :'.--- \ ■:. '■ I .. '. -' '
?xtent". to which ■ the south
has participated in peopling the west,
which will probably be enrprieing to. pei-
Rona who have been taught to believe in
the ; New England origin of western
society. .
When a century ago Ohio, then a terri
tory, was thrown open to - settlement, a
large number of "Hew England persons
settled in the "reserve" in the northeast
ern corner, but it seems that throughout
the stale general./ the creator number of
the settlers were from the south. The Demo
crat distinctly declares that there are to-day
twice as many Virginians in Ohio as there
are people from all the six New England
state?. Of the present population of
American descent in . Ohio, 36 . per cent,
trace their ancestry to families moving
there from south of Mason and Dixon's
line, and 64 per cent., of which only one
third came from New England, from, the
older northern states. In other, words'
more than one-third of the people' of Ohio
are southerners in blood and ancestry, if
not wholly so in sentiment.
In other weetern states the south is
shown to contribute an even larger pro
portion of the population. In Oregon, for
instance, 48 per cant, of the people are of
southern descent, and in Kansas 42 per
cent., while in Texas 93 per cent, of the
population is southern and only 7 per
cent, northern. These facts are interest
ing and contrary to the generally enter
tained opinion on the subject. The in
ternal movement of population
in this country which •is constantly in
progress is one of the most efficient safe
guards of the nation, mixing the people of
opposite regions into a homogeneous
social mass, and prventing the growth of
sectional prejudices with their attendant
antagonism and bitterness. The south
poured thousands of citizens into the west
in the earlier days of settlement in the
latter, and the present southward ten
denoy of western emigrants would
seem to be merely the repayment of a
loan. ..:■'.'..
31It. CARLISLE.
Upon being conducted to the speaker*
chair yesterday, Mr. Carlisle exhibited a
modesty and dignity that at once com
mend him and deeply interest the country
in his future oourse. It was charged npoE
him by the Republican press immediately
it was known that he was the
choice of the Democratic caucus,
that the committees of the House are to
be formed in in the interest of the ''anti
protection wing of the Democratic party,"
and the color was also given to his selec
tion, that the southern wing of the party,
having formed alliances to elect Mr. Gar
lisle will take steps to make the best pos
sible use of his success.
Indulging in this spirit of carping crit
icism the new speaker is charged with
having maintained a conservative position
daring the preliminary canvass simply as
a matter of diplomacy, bidding for votes
by concealing rather than by ; avowing his
purposes. In one of the bitter partisan
bloody-shirt organs Mr. Carlisle is thus
complimented.
Tlih success of Mr. Carlisle means, in shor c,
that old fashioned Democracy is to assert itself,
and that under cover of th« new speaker's repu
tation and record the southern faction is to fight
foe the control of the party machinery.
''Old fashioned Democracy" is a title
which any man may be proud to wear, and
na Mr. Carlisle, is, by all just men admitted
to be one of the broadest and fairest men
in the conulry, and among the congress
men he is honored by the title,
though it was not in that
sense the designation was used.
re judgment of opponents is the chronic
habit of the Republican mind, and no
man of the dominant party in the Forty
eighth congress could have been elected
Speaker without being painted black by
the whited sepulchres whose vulture claws
have so long been fastened upon the gov
ernment. That injustice is don* the new
Speaker at the outlet is not unexpected.
and that no act of his will receive honor
able credit is to be hoped.
The country at large however, will be in
clined to accord Mr. Carlisle fair play,
and they already understand that his old
fashioned Demooraoy means strict econo
my in the administration of the
government, just and equal
taxation for public purpose?,
a faithful observance of the limitations of
the constitution, with a scrupulous regard
for the rights and interests of the great
body of the people, in order that their in
terests may be scrupulously protected. Mr.
Carlisle and all "old fashioned Democrats"
can well afford to suffer denunciation for
holding to such sentiments.
The new speaker in his inaugural ad
dress to the Hou?e said: "Sudden and rad
ical changes in the laws and regulations
affecting the commercial relations and in
dustrial interests of 'the people ought never
to be made, unless they are imperatively
demanded, and in my. opinion, under
the existing circumstances, such 1 changes
would not be favorably received by any
considerable number of those who have
given serious attention to the abject'
These sentiments were re
ceived with applause. That the
gentleman gave ' voice to the
well established sentiment of hia party, as
proclaimed in the platform adopted by the J
Democracy of Kentucky at their last'state .
convention and by the Democrats of Ohio
and of other states, . all intelligent men
well know, and the future course of the
Democratic party will be upon this sound
and saving ground.
In Mr. Carlisle the Republicans recognize
a man so well ■ poised,. so honorably
grounded in the time honored and lustrous
Democratic faith that he will hold no dal
liance with the political foe, and for this
reason, in large part, their vial 3.. of
wrath are uncorked, and dark pictures are
drawn from their depraved ' imaginations
That the Republican minority, so far a«
they can be influenced by the vile and ve
nal party press, will act as obstructionists
and undertake to defeat the popular ; will
and render ineffective wholesome measures
and reforms is expected. The . country,
however, may rely that Mr.
Clarisle will use all the influence of his
high position for the good of the country
and inaugurate no policy but that which
will be for the interest and benefit of the
people without regard to section or bias of
any sort. Fair play has never been a Re
publican jewel and we shall see none of it
from that quarter now.
The comment of the Globe that the se
lection of Mr. Carlisle as speaker .was what
the Republicans wished, is fully borne
oat by the utterances of the Republican
papers since he was chosen.... The St. <
Lo aft Globe-Democrat, a radical '• Republi-1

xjlobe of that date in saying it was "blun-
No. 1." .'
Those persons who nrb relying upon the Dem
icratio Houso to blunder the Democratic party
nto a condition for its easy defeat next year
lave no can so no far to relax their faith. The
selection of Carlisle for Speaker may be sif ly
out down, as blunder;' No." 1. The election :of
. ';<r) ■!.-!« will insure a good dell better chance of
Meeting a Republican Presideatnext November.
The New York Tribune said:
Mr. Carlisle is to be the Democratic Speaker
at the npxt -House.. We are glad of it. It
places his party on a platform en which we shall
be glad to fight it.
The New Yoik Times and other promi
nent Republican prints take similar view*.
That Mr. Carlisle will prove a fair, able
and honorable Speaker is beyond question,
but his selection raises • issues . which it
would have been better to have avoided.
cuiiß&yr comment.
It is an interesting fact that European mails
to tho East find quicker transportation across
the United States tnan by the Suez canal route.
Am iiit.M is a"regular mail across - the Atlantic
four tiin39 a ttui k it is seldom that mails going
to London from the East do not make close
connect ions. Great Britain tends a large por
tion o£ hor infill* Ui Australia, New Zealand, etc.,
throagh the United States. Each trip of the
Pacific Mail steamers forwards 3'JO
sacks of correspondence from ■ those countries
to Great Britain, and 600 sacks from
Great Britain. . " The average time of
transit between New York and Sydney is about
thii ty-three d:ij'P, and from Sydney to London
abo at forty-two days.
As interesting case is attracting considerable
attention in the town of Howard in southern
Dakota. A young woman who -was married
there last summer to a homestead claimant, was
claimed recently by a man from lowa as his run
away wife to ■whom he had been married • for
three years. The lowa man offered to sell out
his interest in her for $250, but the settler could
not raise so much money, and the man caused
the woman's arrest on the charge of bigamy.
She swears that she never knew him, and never
married him, and her sister also swears that she
never was married. But the man insists that
ehe is his wife, and she was held for the action
of the grand jury.
Last Friday, Governor Cleveland, of Hew
York, appointed Wheeler H. Peckham to be

About twenty-five years ago he cane to St. Paid
a_d speedily secured an extensive practice in
the city. In 1863, ho wore-, lie returned t« his
native state, and taking up his residence in New
York city, he rose rapidly to a leading position
at the bar of that metropolis. He distinguish
ed himself by tho ability with " which ho con-■
ducted the prosecution of the Tweed Ring, and
it is said iii=i present selection by the governor
is owing to the record he made in thoa* impor

It is said that business ie Tory dull on the
Pacific coast and especially in Oregon end Wash

is said to contain nearly a thousand of unem

be replaced by a general business activity on a

Can American steamships compete with those
of Great Britain? The American Steamship
company of Philadelphia have come to the con
clusion that they cannot. One reason m the
lower cost of manning English vessels, the
American seaman receiving nearly double. the
pay of the British tar. The company has deter
mined to dispose of its own fine steamers and
replace them with others of larger capacity and
sailirtg under English colors. Where is John

A United States ex-senator indicted for

two barns in the middle of the block sur
rounded by Rondo, Martin, Rice and

Although the department were prompt
ly on the ground the fire consumed the two
barns and set fire to a small story
and a half house adjacent without any
thing to protect a nest of small houses and
shanties adjacent but the chemical engine
and a pail brigade.
Finally by attaching hose together and
turning up Rice from Kendo and thence
turning upon Martin a cistern was capped
from 500 to 600 yards distant and a stream
secured in tine to save the house after a
portion of the roof burned off.
The settlement was entirely French and
one of the barns burned was the property
of Michael Morrissette, who Rived his cow
but lost a small quantity of fodder, and
tho other belonged toMatßowen. The
damage ail told was probably under $300,
and was probably uninsured. Had th«ro
been any wind blowing at the time the

Cleveland, Dec. 3. —Miss Flora Moore,
of the "Buach of Kris" Comedy company,
has discovered in Dr. Geo. W. Moore, a
well known. and wealthy physician, a long
lost uncle. About the year 1861. Geo. W.
and Chester Moore separated at the break
ing out of the war, George going to the
army and Chester to the Pacific states to
seek his fortune. Ten years afterward
Chester died, leaving a wife and a little
boy of seven and a girl of five. George
heard the news, but .soon
lost sight ; of his / sister-in-law,
and the children who went on the stage at
the ages of ten and twelve years to play
juvenile and minor parts. The girl ad
vanced in her profession. She also mar
ried an actor, Mr. Me Adam. . Yesterday
ehe learned that there was a prominent
physician in the ; city, named
Geo. W. Mpore. She drove to bis resi
dence and asked whether he had a brother
named Chester. He replied that .he had
had a brother of that name. "Then
Il 4 - am Dora .. Moore, # the only
daughter of your r brother Chester.'
cried Miss Moore, "I thank heaven I have
found you after years of search.". For
once the actress found herself in a roman

EXPEN3E3 OF T3H TTNITED STATES COUET3.
The expenses of the court?, when, finally
ascertained for a fiscal year, usually reach
$3,000,000. It is no prudent to suppose
that they will fall below this sum in any
■ year. The character of the expenses
changes somewhat year after year, but the
gross amount remains nearly the same.
- The provisions of the bill, chapter 436,
approved August 7, IS3O, for ' service of
process, etc., applicable to tha territories
of New Mexico and Arizona might justly
be extended to the territories of Montana,
Idaho, Washington, Wyoming and Utah.
It is respectfully submitted that in terri
tories where the expenses of service are
greater than the legal fees, the fees of the
marshals should be doubled, since other
territories now have that privilege.
PEES Or WITNESSES AMD JUBOEB IN TBBBI
TOBIES.
Tke acts of February 26,1853, and May
1, 1876, provide that witnesses of the
United States shall receive for attendance
in court or before any officer pursuant to
law, $1.50 per day and 5 cents a mile for
troing from his place of residence to the
place of trial or hearing, and 5 cents a
mile for returning. -
i In the districts of California, Oregon,
Nevada, and all the territories, the actual
cost of subsistence is from $2 to . $4 per
day, and the cost of transportation irom
sto 20 cents per mile. When it is ' con
sidered that the places of holdiag court in.
the districts mentioned are at great dis
tances apart, often 200 or 300 mile.*, aud
that ' the necessary mode of travel i?
by stage, it will be seen tkat a citizen
serves in the capacity of a United States
witness at a great pecuniary loss and per
soaal , inconvenience. It is believed that
this inadequate compensation causes
mans oj the suits and prosecutions
on : behalf of the government
to fail because of the ill-will of the wit
nesses. Witnesses frequently avoid a
summons, thus defeating justice, or 'if
served,' decline to obey, in '■■ order to com
pel the marshal to arrest them on a bench
warrant, preferring to be taken to the
court as prisoners ;at ' the government's
expense, rather than to pay their own ex
penses without any hope of being reim
bursed.
Under the act of June 30, 1879, jurors
receive a per diem of $2, and under the
act of ' July. 15, 1870, five cents per mile
' for the distance necessarily traveled from
their residence, going and returning
from said court by the shortest practical
' route.'
'" The actual expenses of jurors are . the
1 name as those of witnesses in the districts
mentioned, and there can be no doubt that
1 the interests \of ■'. the " government are in
■ jured '. and great injustice ; done citizens
called upon to : serve in - either ■of * these
capacities '...by. the insufficiency of the
compensation allowed under the present
law. ■
It is recommended that acme additional
legislation be enacted to relieve the peo
ple of the hardships : now : necessarily • in
flicted npon them by the administration of
justice in the ; United States courts.' ;It
•would seem that the most equitable pro
vision that could be made would be a law
providing that witnesses and jurors in the
dibtriets of California, Oregon, Nevada,
and all of the territories' be paid their ac
tual expenses in going to, while in atten
dance upon court, and returning to their
places of residence, in lien of the mileage
and per diem now allowed by law. The
justice and propriety of such a provision
of law has already been recognized by
congress.

MOLLIE MOLLIFIED.
The Actress Kaown as Mollle Ravel
Secures a Divorce From tier Husband,
. [Special Telegram to the Globe. 1
Philadelphia, Dec. 3.—A decree of di
vorce was issued in favor of Mrs. Win. H.
Fitzgerald, better known by the stage
auras of Mollio Ravel. She was married
to Fitzgerald in March, 1872, whan . both
were amatorrs. They afterwards chose
the stage as a profession and removed to
Cleveland, where their marital
troubles b?gan owing to his strange con
duct with a colored cook, and his subse
quent dismissal from a boarding house,
his innocent wife being also sent adrift.
Mrs. Fitzgerald followed the wayward hus
band to ban Francisco, where they were
compelled to separate, she joining Bald
win's theatre while he become manager
for several "stars." In the fall of 1880
the husband and wife become connected
with Alice Oates' combination, and it was
here the real trouble began.
Mrs. Fitzgerald swears her husband was
entirely too intimate with Alice Oates, she
awaiting his coming- and a domestic scene
ensued. He dropped on his knees and
begged his wife to kill him, being certain
beyond a doubt that she wouldn't do it.His
wife was in hysterics, while the fair queen
ran and hid herself. Mrs. Fitzgerald soon
left the company and wont to New York,
while her husband remained with
the Oites party. Word reached
her that he and the fair
singer were too loving at New Orleans,
where they were playing. Without waiting
for coremony she took the first train and
hurried thither. She reached the hotel in
New Orleans at 7 p.m. Remaining in a
close carriage in front of the hotel Elie
waited for her husband to appear. la a
few moments they came out,the fair singer
leaning on his arm and saying something
funny which made them both
laugh. The enraged wife ■ tore
opea , the . carriage, seized
a small clock she carried with her on her
journey, and coming behind the opera
bouffe queen struck her a heavy blow on
the head flattening her bonnat and knock
ing her into the gutter. The fair singer
shouted "murder" and begged her enemy
to spare her, while the surmised husband
asked calmly: 'Why, Moliie, what is the
matter?" "Decide," cried the wife point- i
ing to the fallen enchantress, ''between i
that woman and me. Which will you
go with." "Why, with you, of I
course, Mollie," replied the surprised hus- I
band, "ain't you my wife V He took her
arm and they went away, leaving tho dis
consolate woman to pick herseif up. In
the spring of 1881 Mrs. Fitzgerald claim*
her husband deserted her. On this charge
combined with another charge in which a
prominent Philadelphia physician who at
attended and responded, was summoned
as a witness, the grounds for divorce were
based.
SKII'PED TO CHICAGO.
Milwaukee lieruft of Her Only Lady Lav. -
yer, fortha lieiif.ll t of the City at U.«
Head of the Lake.
[Special Toiesram to the Globe.]
Milwaukee, Dec, —Miss Kate Kane,
the lady lawyer, has shaken the dust of
Milwaukee from her feet and gone to re
side in Chicago. Her exodu3 was made
very quietly, the lady bidding adieu only
to a few of her intimate friends, and not
speaking to them of the plans which she I
had formed in regard to the future. This
reticence in regard to her personally is
said by her friends to have been
one of Miss Kane's characteristics
since the episode in Judge
Mallory's court about a year ago when
the lady lawyer exhibited "contempt of
court" by dashing a glass of water in the
face of the occupant of the bench. She
has not lately essayed the practice of the
legal profession. For some tune past she
has been engaged in correspondence for
some northwestern papers and her letters,
written in the vigorous, racy style for
which she is celebrated, have at
tracted considerable notice. It is
believed that she has obtained
a permanent engagement in Chicago to do
newspaper work, During the time of her
residence in Milwaukee, Miss Kane was
probably more frequenty in hot water than
any other woman in the city, and the con
trast formed by the quietness of her de
parture is consequently a subject of gen
eral remark.
CHICAGO THE PLACE.
The Politicians Agree That it is the Best
Piece for the National Conventions—A
Prospect that Both will be Hold There,
[Special Telegram to the .Globe. I
Chicago, Dec. 3.—"At the present
time," said Mr. Warren G. Leiand to a
reporter for the Globe last evening, the
chances for the holdiDg of both national
conventions at Chicago are most exel
lent."
' "How. soon will you be able to say de
finitely whether either will be held here?"
"I think we shall be able to tell some
time during the coming week. Things are
being pushed along as fast as possible, and
a great deal of work is being done.
f All of those we have heard from by let
ter are convinced that Chicago is the very
best place for the purpose. My private
opinion is that the committee will succeed
in all its plans. You paw what Mr. Jas.
B. Jeffrey said about the feeling among
politicians in Washington, where he has
recently bean on business. He srys that
everybody he has talked with was of the
opinion that Chicago was the place for the
conventions, and po it is."

Sainon says he lulled iL-s. Ford at!)
o'clock Saturday forenoon, but did not at
tempt to outrage her. She was killed in a
drunken squabble. She showed signs 'of
life for about ten minutes and he made
several attempts to bring her to life. Fail
ing, he became frightened and chopped the
body and put it i. .o a trunk and started '
off to disposa of it. Ha carried it to Rud
dy's house, whore he was somewhat ac
quainted. He then left the trunk in front
of the house, where it remained about two
hours. He took it into the hocsn about
dark,' and during the night he became
frightened and could cot sleep. When it
was near morning and ho had bad no op
portunity to dispose of the body, he con
cluded upon the plaa of killing Ruddy and
his family and burning the houst, thereby
destroying the evidence of his gcitt.
Samon gives & graphic description of the
killing of Ruddy and the child, and die at
tack on Mrs. Ruddy. The latter got up at
midnight and made him a cup of tea and
returned to bed. Ruddy aat np with
Samon, who did not intimate to Ruddj
what the trouble was. Samon was all
worked np and imagined the house sur
rounded by people. "I walked about the
house," ho says, until abont 8 o'clock,
when; it oceurrtd to me I might kill the.
whole of them and burn the ho«.-:i. The
very moment; the thought oame to ma
I struck Ruddy. I don't eupposa he saw
me. I killed him instantly. Ha
made no noise more than dropping off th« •
chair. His wife ran out. There wad a
light on the table when eho came in the
room. I grabbed at hor and struck her
with the hatchet and &he screamed. I can
not remember what she Bain*, ac th« child
■was screaming also. I took him off th»
bid, but don't remember cutting him with
the hatchet. I cannot toll whether I struck
the woman afterward or not. At thi3 time
the trunk lied not been opened. I chopped,
tie rope off the trunk, and turned the body
of Mrs. Ford on the floor in the same way.
I pulled the bed clothes around every way
and poured kerosene around and
set it on lire. Then I ran
out into the street and went right over to
Ford'n, bat could not get in, and then
I started for Plymouth. I did not hear the
fire bells, nor did I hear the women
scream. I did not know the house was
not burned until Jewell told mo. I sap
i posed the bodies might hava been de
j stroyed. Have not seen Ford since the
j Friday night before I killed Mrs. Ford. I
ate supper with him that night and they
had words at th*> table. I c!id not see Mrs.
Ford again until next"morning. I can't
describe the Ruddy hatchet. I remember
wishing I had pat it where I found it. Did
not throw tho hatchet in the rivor. I had
no thought of doing Mrs. Ford any iujnry
until I saw her on Saturday morning.

tho Texas Pacific Railroad company wi*
forgery and swindling. It claimed Lohn
stein's operations covered upward of $125,

the eastern defaulting ngent of the rail
road at Sherman. It is said the fictitious '• .
name of G. J. Anderson was used by Lohn- ; r
stein's confident at Sherman in sending jj
him samples of cotton, bills of lading, etc. t'
Lohnstein paid Anderson for 2,500 bales
of cotton through the banking house of .
Oliver & Briggs, drawing between $40 and
$50 on each bale. This cot
ton was consigned to Her-'
man Bros., Salman . & Co., and _
Lehman Bros., New York, Stoddard & Co.

some eastern mills. All the drafts were ■
promptly paid by the consignees except
$8,000 now held by Oliver & Brigg? i
against Lohnstein. They claim to be safe,
as Lobnstein has $5,000 as margin depos- I
ited with them, as.d bills of lading are :
signed in date form by the eastsrn com pa- ■ _
Egent at the time. Lohnstein's at- •
