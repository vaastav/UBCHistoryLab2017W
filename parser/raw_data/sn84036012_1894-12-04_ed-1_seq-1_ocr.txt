Tbasagacity which baa always charac-^teriied tba management at the great^business interests represented by tbe^bouse of Lays baa invariably coma con^^spicuously into the foreground whonover^a commercial crisis or other momentous^period has called (or the exercise of^prompt and sound Judgment, and nothing^better serrea to illustrate this than the^Arm's recent announcement in connec^^tion with the changes effected in the new^tariff.
,Ant Icipating the advance of duty on dia^^monds and precious stones from 10 to^26 per cent, the firm laid in a very large^reserve stock of the gems. It will readily^be aaen what an advantage this foresight^offers to the house, for they have an^^nounced that until their reserve stock,^which will tide them over for many^months. Is disposed of they will not ad^^vance any of their prices, but continue to^sell at the same figures prevailing before^the tariff law wont into effect.
Avery extensive line of solid silver, both^for table and toilet use, aa well aa novel*^ties of every description, has Just been^received for the holiday trade, and prices^have been greatly reduced from thoea of^last season. In addition to these reduc^^tions the bouse will make a great display^of new goods in their various departments^this season.
Beautifulgifts are to be had from 60^cents upwards, and no excuses for lack of^cash to buy Christmas gifts nsad be made^by the people who visit this well filled se^^tsblisbment.
Goldgoods, from exquisite gold-beaded^canes and umbrellas to the most delicate^pin, era exhibited at prices to suit every*^body. One of the main features of the^display la a ease of solitaire diamond^rings, which they are selling at the ridicu^^lously low pries of $15 each^s pries, con^^sidering the sise of the stone and the^beautiful mountings, would seem incred^^ible. Undoubtedly many will seise this^golden opportunity % wear a diamond^ring.

Wasbuiotoh,Dec. 8.^The following is^the text of the message of President^Cleveland which was read in both bouses^of congress this afternoon:
Theassemblage within the nation's leg^^islative balls of those charged with the^duty of making laws for the benefit of a^generous end free people impressively^suggests tbe exacting obligation and inex^^orable responsibility involved in their^task. At tbe threshold of such labor now^to be undertaken by tbe congress of tbe^United States, and in the discbarge of an^executive duty enjoined by tbe constitu^^tion, I submit this communication con^^taining a brief statement of tbe condition^of our national affairs and recommending^such legislation aa seems to me necessary^and expedient.
SOMErORBIOV MATTERS.
Tbehistory of our recent dealings with^other nations anc our peaceful relatione^with them at this time demonstrates tbe^sdvantage of consistently adhering to u^firm but Just foreign policy, free from en^^vious or ambitious national schemes snd^characterised by entire honesty and sin^^cerity. During the past year, pursuant to^a law of congress, commissioners were^appointed to the Antwerp industrial ex^^position, though tbe participation of^American exhibitors fell far short of com^^pletely illustrating our national ingenuity^and industrial achievements, yet it was^quite creditable, in view of the brief time^allowed for preparation.
Ihave endeavored to impress upon the^Belgian government the Heedlessness and^positive barrafulness of its restrictions^upon the importation of certain of our^food products and have strongly urged^that the rigid supervision and inspection^under our laws are amply sufflcisnt to^prevent the exportation from this country^of diseased cattle and unwholesome meat.
Thetermination of the civil war in^Braiil has been followed by tbe general^prevalence of peace and order. It ap^^pearing at an early stage of the insurrec^^tion that its course would call for unnsual^watchfulness on the part of this govern^^ment, our naval fores in lbs harbor of^Rio de Janeiro waa strengthened. This^precaution I am satisfied tended to i^strict the issue to a simple trial of strength^between tbe Brasilian government and^tbe insurgents and to avert complications^which at times seemed imminent. Our^firm attitude of neutrality was maintained^to tbo end. The insurgents received en^^eouragement of eventual asylum from our^commanders and such opposition as they^encountered was for the protection of our^commerce and was dearly Justified by^public law.
Aserious tension of relations having^arisen at tbo close of tlio war between^Braid and Portugal by reason of the es^^cape of the insurgent admiral, Do Gama^and bis followers, tbe friendly offices of^our representatives to those countries^w ere excited for the protection of tbe sub^^jects of either within tbe territory of the^other. Although the government of Bra^^it was duly notified that tho commercial^arrangement existing between the United^States and that countrv, based on the^third section of the tariff act of 189J was^abrogated on Aug 28, 1894, by the taking^effect of tbo tariff law in lorce, that gov^eminent subsequently notified the United^States of its intention to terminate such^arrangement on tho first day of January,^1891, in tue exercise of tbe right reserved^in the agreement between the two coua^tries. I invite attention to tiie corre^^spondence between tbe secretary of state^and the Brasilian minister on this sub^^ject.
Tbecommission organized under tbe^convention which we had entered into^with Chili for the settlement of the out^standing claims of each government^against the other, adjourned at the end^of the period stipulated for its continue^ance, leaving undetermined a number of^American cases which had been duly pre^^sented. These claims are not barred and^negotiations are in progress for their sub^^mission to a tribunal.
MUAND JAPAN.^The new treaty with ( lima in further^regulation was signed at Washington, and^on Aug. 13 it received the sanction of ll.^senate. Rat ideation on tliu nan of China^and formal exchange arc awaited to give^effect tothismiiiua.lv bunclicial SStlVOS^tion. Acratilying recognition of the uni^^form impartiality of this country towards^all foreign states was manifested by the^coincident request of the (liiueso and^Japanese governments that tho agents of^tho United States should, within proper^limn, afford protection to t:io subjects of^I the other during the suspension of diplo^I matic relations duo io a state of war.^: This delicate office w as accepted and^I misapprehension wInch gavo nan lo the^, belief that, in affording this gladly mi^official protection, our agents would excr-
stsstbosassssstborkywhich the nun-
Iranii SgOOtS o' the belligerents^had exercised was promptly cor^| reeled. Although the war hot ween^( tuna ami japan endangers u^policy of th*^ L'tnted Males it deserves^uiir gravest consideration by reasoi^of its disturbance of our growing^commercial interests in the t^countries and tbo increased dangers
whichmay result to our citlsens domi^^ciled or sojourning in the interior of^China. Acting under a stipulation In our^treaty with Cores (the first concluded^with s western power) st felt coos trained^at the beginning of the controversy to^tender our good offices to induce en ami^^cable arrangement of tbe initial difficulty^growing out of the Japanese demands for^administrative reforms in Corest but the^unhappy precipitation of actual hostilities^defested this kindly purpose. Deploring^tbe destructive war between tbe two most^powerful of the eastern nations and anx^^ious t hat our commercial interests la those^countries may he preserved and that the^safety of our citisens there shall not be^Jeopardized, I could not hesitate to heed^any intimation ihat our friendly aid for^tbe honorable termination of hostilities^would be acceptable to both belligerents.
Aconvention has been Anally coneluded^for tire settlement by arbitration of the^prolonged dispute with Kcuador growing^out of the proceedings' against Eradio^Santos, a naturalized citiien of the United^States.
ASTO FRANCE AND l.l.ltMANY.
Ourrelations with the republic of France^con inue to be such as should ex st bs^^tween nations so long bound together by^friendly sympathy and similarity in the r^form of government. The recent erucl^assassination of the president of this sis-^tor republic called forth such universal^expressions of sorrow and condolence^from our people and government as to^leave no doubt of tho depth and sincerity^of our attachment. I hn resolutions^passed by tho senate arid house of repre^^sentatives on the occasion havo been^communicated to tbo widow of President^Csrnot.
TheGerman government has excepted^sgainst that provision of the customs tariff^act which imposes a discriminatingduty of^one-tenth of a cent a pound on eugtrseom^ing from countries paying an export boun^^ty thereon, claiming that the exaction of^such a du y is in contravention of articles^5 and 9 of tbe treaty of 18 t^ with Prussia.^In the interests of the commerce of both^countries and toavoid even the accusation^of treaty violation, I recommend the re^^peal of so much of the statute as Imposes^tbat duty, and 1 invite attention to tbe^accompanying report of the secretary of^state containing a discussion of the ques^^tions rsised by tho Gorman protests.
THEBERING SEA Bl KIN ESS.
Esrlyin the present year an agreement^was reached with Great Britain concern^^ing instructions to be given to tbe naval^commanders of the two govern^^ments in Bering sea and the con^^tiguous North Pacific ocean, for tbeir^guidance in the execution of tbe award^of the Paris tribunal of arbitration and^the enforcement of the regulations there^^in proscribed for the protection of seal^life in the waters mentioned. An under^^standing has also been reached for tbe^payment by the United States of fM35,0X^.^in full satlsfsction of all claims which^may be made by Great Britain for^damages growing out of the controversy^as to fur seals in Bering sea or tbe^seizure of British vessels engaged in tak^^ing sssl in these waters. The award snd^findings of the Paris tribunal to a great^extent determined the facts and princi^^ples upon which these claims should be^adjusted, and they have been subjected^by both governments to a thorough ex^^amination upon tho principles as well as^the facts which they involve. I am con^^vinced that settlements upon the terms^mentioned would be an equitable and ad^^vantageous one and I recommend that^provision be made for tbe prompt pay^^ment of the stated sum. Thus far only^France and Portugal have signified their^willingness to adhere to the regulations^established under the award of the Paris^tribunal of arbitration. Preliminary sur^^veys of tbe Alaskan boundary and a pre^^paratory examination of tbe question of^protection of food fish in tbo contiguous^waters of tho United Slates and the^Dominion of Canada are in progress.
Tbeboundary of British Guinea still^remains in dispute between Great Britain^and Venezuela. Believing that early set^^tlement on some just basis alike honor^^able to both parties is in the line of our^established policy to remove from this^hemisphere all causes of difference with^power beyond the sea, I shall renew the^efforts heretofore made to bring shout^restoration of diplomatic relations be^^tween the disputants and induce arbitra^^tion, a resort which Great Britain so con^^spicuously favors in principle and respects^in practice, and which is honestly sought^by ber weaker adversary.
AWORD ON HAWAII.
Siuoocommunicating tbe voluminous^correspondence in regard to Hawaii and^tbe action taken by tho senate and house^of representatives on certain questions^submitted to the judgment and wider dis^^cretion of congress, the organization of a^government in place of the provisional^arrangement which followed the deposi^^tion ot the queen has been announced,^with evidence of its effectivo opcrauoti.^Tho recognition usual in such cases has^been accorded the new government.
Ctiderthopresent treaties of extradi^^tion with Italy, miscarriages of justice^havo occurred owing to the refusal of that^government to surrender its own subjects.^Thus far our efforts to negotiate an^amended convention obviating this diffi^^culty has been unavailing.
Apirt from the war in which their land^empire is engaged, Japan attracis later*^eating attention in this country by her^evident desire to cultivate more liberal^intercourse with tho United Slates and ^o^seek our kindly aid in furtherance of her^laudable desire for complete autonomy in^her domestic affairs and full equality in^the 'family of nations. The Japanese^empire to-day is no longer the Japan of^the past, and our relations with this pro^^gressive nation should net bo less broad^and liberal than those with other powers.^TO Till'. south ok t s.^Good will fos cred by many interests in^common lias marked our relations with^our nearest southern neighbors.

ATHENS,Dec. 3.^The associated press ex^^clusively has been able to give to the world the^facts of tho fearful atroc.Los nerpetrated upon^the Armenian Christians In Asia Minor, and to^^day a representative of the associated press^succeeded In securing additional Information^conllrmlng the previous statem tits mad^. The^representative to-day met t!0 Armenian refugees^who arrived here from Aimenis after a Journey^of hardship aud sufferlug.
Securingihe services of a first class interpre^ti r he questioned the refugees concerning the^terrible events of which they had In a number^of case., been rye witnesses. Most of the per^^sons w ho told their stories to-day, escaped from^Moosh, ihtilsh and sassoun. and making their^way with the greatest difficulty lo the Russo-^Turklsh frontier.
SeveralArmenian women escaped In villages^wlfh this party, but when near Krzeroum they^died frum tbe rllects of saber wounds Inflicted^upon them before their escane. 1 or ainuit 1*^months, the Armenians say, the procure of^hessoun has been surrounded by Turkish troops^and nobody has been allowed lo enter It or to^^ass,
Aboutfour months ago the ITnrklsb suthirt-^tios learned that the Inhabitants of Variemis, a^village o dslde of the frontier of Sassoun. were^sending for the necessaries of life to tbe village^of Dslvorlg. Such communication between the^two villages being prohibiied, the Turks massa^^cred nearly all of the inhabitants of VartemlS.^This wss the second massacre; the first look^place about a year ago.
Olioof tbe refuges slates tbat his uncle snd^aunt were both k tiled, the latter bring violated^previous to be.ng put to death. An Armenia^prh st named kevont was killed for refusing to^celebrate the Turkish rights lu bit cburcn at^Vartemls. The ill.age contained XS Armenia^houses before the lurks attacked It, bat when^the fugitive, left only ^ houses remained st nd^Ing. Dalvorig. It appears is the largest village^In the province of sassoun, snd Its lubsbllaois.^w ben they learned of the horrors perpetrated^by the Turks at Varltemls, a tacked the Turks^os the frontier. The Turkish commander^evi-Btually sent 12 soldiers luto Dslvorlg to^learn what bad occurred Tbe ArmeuUtu,^filled with Indbtna'lon at the atrocities commit^^ted by tbe Turks at Vartemls, attacked this de^^tachment of Turkish soldiers sad pat them ail^to death.
Whentbe Turkish commander heard of the^death of his soldiers he determined on venge^^ance In the most bloody manner Dosstble. A^strong force of Turkish troops was seat to the^village wltb artillery and the massacre bee n.^Ihe guns kept up a continuous Ore upon Dsl-^rortgniitil practically not oss 11080 wss left^standing ui on another.
Seio.the bey of Inllzuun. a Kurd, wltb a da^^ta hment of Kurdish cavalry, went with the^Turkish soldiers to the village of Semal sad^forcibly took an Armenian priest from his^cburcb. bound him oo a donkey, which they^drove a few yards. Tbe soldiers then Ursd at^the priest and kl led him sad the beast.
Fromthis village seio forcibly took eight^Armenian girls and sent them le btt harem at^isMhSsn.
Furtheratrocities were committed at the ril^^ing^ of Kell huesen Before the daws this^pi ice ess surrounded by soldiers, soil wale the^Inhabitants were asleep. It was set on firs.
