SPAIN AND CUBA.
A Resume of the Conditions Whleh
Led Dp to the War.
In my last annual message very full con
sideration was given to the question of
the duty of the government of the United
tates toward Spain and the Cuban In
surrection as being by far the most Im
portant problem with which we were then
, sailed upon to deal The considerations
then advanced, and the exposition of the
Views therein expressed, disclosed my
sense of the extreme gravity of the situ
ation. Setting aside, as logically un
founded or practically Inadmissible, the
recognition of the JnUi pendence of Cuba,
neutral Intervention to end the war by im
posing a rational compromise between the
contestants, intervention In favor of one
r the other party, ami forcible annexation
of the island, I cotu luiieil It was honeatly
due to our friendly r latlons with Spain
that she ahould be given a reasonable
enance to realize her expectations of re
form to which she had become irrevocably
committed. U itiiin a few weeks previous
ly she had announced comprehensive plans,
which it was confidently asserted would
he efficacious to r m dy the evilB so deep
ly affecting our own country, so Injurious
to the true interests of the mother country
as well as to those of Cuba, and so repug
nant to the universal sentiment of hu
manity. The ensuing month brought little sign of
real progress toward the pacification of
Cuba. The autonomous administration set
up in the capital and some of the prin
cipal cities appeared not to gain the favor
of the inhabitants nor to be able to extend
their Iniiuence to the largo extent of ter
ritory held by the Insurgents while the
military arm, obviously unable to cope
With the still active rebellion, continued
many of the most objectionable and offen
sive policies of the government that had
f receded it. No tangible relief was af
orded the vast numbers of unhappy re
eoncentrados despite the reiterated pro
fessions made In that regard and the
amount appropriated by Spain to that
end. The proffered expedient of zones of
cultivation proved illusory; Indeed, no less
practical nor more delusive promises of
succor could well have been tendered to the
exhausted and destitute people, stripped of
all that made life and home dear and
herded In a strange region among unsym
pathetic strangers hardly lees necessitous
than themselves.
By the end" of December the mortality
among them had frightfully Increased.
Conservative estimates from Spanish
sources placed the deaths among these dis
tressed people at over 40 per cent, from the
time Gen. Weyler's decree of reconcentra
tlon was enforced. With the acquiescence
of the Spanish authorities a scheme was
adopted for relief by charitable contribu
tions raised in this country and distrib
uted under the direction of the consul-general
and several consuls by noble and ear
nest Individual effort through the organ
ised agencies of the American Red Cross.
Thousands of lives were thus saved, but
many thousands more were inaccessible to
such forms of aid.
The war continued on the old footing
Without comprehensive plan, developing
only the same spasmodic encounters, bar
ren of strategic result, that had marked the
course of the earlier ten years' rebellion as
well as the present Insurrection from its
start. No alternative save physical ex
haustion of either combatant and there
withal the practical ruin of the island lay
In sight, but how far distant no one could
venture to conjecture.
Pestrnctlon of the Maine.
' At this Juncture, on the 16th of Febru
ary last, occurred the destruction of the
battleship Maine, while rightfully lying in
the harbor of Havana on a mission of in
ternational courtesy and good will a
catastrophe the suspicious nature and hor
ror of which stirred the nation's heart pro
foundly. It Is a striking evidence of the
poise and sturdy good sense distinguishing
our national character that this shocking
blow, falling upon a generous people, al
ready deeply touched by preceding events
In Cuba, did not move them to an instant,
desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the
existence of a condition of danger and dis
order at our doors that made poasible auch
S deed by whomsoever wrought. Yet the
Instinct of Justice prevailed and the nation
anxiously awaited the result of the search
ing investigation at once set on foot. The
finding of the naval board of Inquiry estab
lished that the origin of the explosion waa
external by a submarine mine, and only
halted through lack of positive testimony
to fix the responsibility of its authorship.
Action of Conarreca.
All these things carried conviction to the
most thoughtful, even before the finding
of the naval court, that a crista In our re
lations with Spain toward Cuba was at
hand So strong was this belief that It

the navy of Bualn. which comprised mod

eniuigomtnt of men and munitions. The

oreaded contingency s told In the reports
or the secretaries of war and of the navy,
ana need not be- repeated here. It la suffi
cient to say that the outbreak of the
war, when It did come found our nation not
unprepared to meet the conflict.
Nor was the apprehension of coming
stnre confined to our own country. It was
felt by the continental powers which, on
April 6, through their ambassadors and
envoys, addressed to the executive an ex
pression of hope that humanity and mod
eration might mark the course of this gov
ernment and people, and that further nego
tiations would load to an agreement which,
while securing the maintenance of peace,
would afllrm all necesaary guarantees for
the reestabllshmcnt of order In Cuba. In
respond'ng to that representation, I also
sharod the hope that the envoys had ex
pressed that peace might be preserved In
a manner to terminate the chronic condi
tion of disturbance In Cuba so Injurious
and menacing to our Interests and tran
quility, as well as shocking to our senti
ments of humanity: and, while appreciat
ing the humanitarian and disinterested
character of the communication they had
made on behalf of the powers, I stated the
confidence of this government, for it? part,
that equal appreciation would be shown for
Its own earnest and unselfish endeavors to
fulfill a duty to humanity by ending s sit
uation, the indefinite prolongation of which
had become insufferable.
Efforts (on tinned.
Still animated by the hope of a peaceful
solution and obeying the dictates of duty,
no effort was relaxed to bring about a
speedy ending of the Cuba nstruggle. Ne
gotiations to this obpert continued actively
with the government of Spain, looking to
the Immediate conclusion of a six months'
armistice in Cuba with a view to effect the
recognition of her people's right to inde
pendence. Besides this, the instant revo
cation of the order of reconcentratlon was
asked, so that the sufferers, returning to
tholr homes and aided by united American
and Spanish effort might be put in a way
to support themselves and, by orderly re
sumption of the well-nigh destroyed pro
ductive energies of the island, contribute
to the restoration of its tranquility and
well-being.
Negotiations continued for some little
time at Madrid, resulting In offers by the
Spanish government which could not but
be regarded as Inadequate. It was pro
posed to confide the preparation of peace
to the Insular parliament, yet to be con
vened under the autonomous decrees of
November, 1897, but without Impairment In
any wine of the constitutional powers of
the Madrid government, which, to that
end, would grant an armistice, if solicited
by the Insurgents, for such time as the
general in chief might see fit to fix. How
and with what scope of discretionary
powers the Insular parliament was ex
pected to set about the "preparation" of
peace did not appear. If ft were to be by
negotiation with the Insurgents, the issue
seemed to rest on the one side with a body
chosen by a fraction of the electors in the
districts under Spanish control, and on
the oilier with the insurgent population
holding the Interior country, unrepresented
In the so-called parliament, ana defiant
at the suggestion of suing for peace.
CONGRESS ASKF.D TO ACT.
1 Whole Question Submitted to l.esu-
lator on April 11.
Grieved and disappointed at this barren
outcome of my sincere endeavors to reach
a practical solution, I felt It my duty to re-
l mlt the whole question to the congress,
j In the message of April 11, 1898, I announced
, that with this last overture in the direc
tion of Immediate peace In Cuba, and its
. disappointing reception by Spain, the ef
' fort of the executive was brought to an
end. I again reviewed the alternative
course of action which I had proposed,
, concluding that tbe only one consonant
with international policy and compatible
with our firm-set historical traditions was
; intervention as a neutral to stop the war
and check the hop. less sacritice of life,
even though that resort involved "hostile
constraint upon both the parties to the
contest, hh well to enforce a truce as to
fcuide the eventual -1 I tlement."
The grounds Justifying that st.p were:
The Interests of humanity; the duty to
protect life and property of our citizens in
Cuba; the right to chi ck Injury to our com
merce and people thiough the devastation
of the island, and. rriu.it Important, the need
of removing at once and forever the con
stant menace and the burdens entailed
upon our government by tlie uncertainties
and perils of the situation caused by the
unendurable disturbance in Cuba. I said:
"The long tiial has proved that the ob
ject for which Spain lias waged the war
cannot be aualred. The fire of Insurrec
tion may flame or may smolder with vary
ing scaon.$, but it has not been, and it is
plain that it cannot be, extinguished by
present methods. The only hone of relief
and repose from a condition which can no
longer be endured is the enforced pacifi
cation of Cuba, in the name of humanity,
in the name of clvihzation. In behalf of en
dangered American interests which give
us the right and the duty to speak and to
actual war In Cuba, must stop."
In view of all this, the congress was
asked to authorize and empower the pres
ident to take measures to secure a full and
final termination of hostilities between Spain
and the people of Cuba, and to secure to the
island the establishment of a stable govern
ment, capable of maintaining order and
observing its International obligations, In
I suring peace and tranquillity, and the se
curity of Its citizens as well as our own,
and for the accomplishment of those ende
to use the military and naval forces of the
IJnlted States as might be necessary, with
added authority to continue generous re
lief to the starving people of Cuba.
Action of Congress Approved.
The response of the congress, after nine
days' of earnest deliberation, during which
the almost unanimous sentiment of your
body was dev loped on every point save
as to the expediency of coupling the pro
posed action with a formal recognition of ,
the republic of Cuba as the true and lawful
government of that Island a proposition I
which failed of adoption the congress, i
after conference, on the 19th of April, by
g vote of 42 to 36 In the senate and 311 to 6 1
in the house of representatives, passed the I
memorable joint resolution, declaring:
"First. That the people of the Island of
Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free '
and independent.
"Second. That It Is the duty of the United
States to demand and the government of '
the United States does hereby demand, the 1
government of Spain at once relinquish Its I
authority and government In the Island of
Cuba and withdraw its land and naval
forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
"Third. That the president of the United
States be, and he hereby Is, directed and
empowered ,o use the entire land and naval
forces of the United States, and to call Into
the actual service of the United States
the militia of the several states, to such
extent us may be necessary to carry these
resolutions Into effect.
"Fourth. That the United States hereby
disclaims any disposition or intention to
exercise sovereignty. Jurisdiction or control
over said Island except for the pacification
thereof, and asserts Its determination when
that Is accomplished to leave the govern
ment and control of the island to Its peo
ple." Diplomatic Itelntiona Ended. j
This resolution aas approved by the ex
ecutive on the next day, April 20. A copy
Was at once communicated to the Spanish
minister at this capital, who forthwith an
nounced that his continuance In Washing
ton had thereby become Impossible, and
asked for his passports, which were given
lii.n. Hi ttKieupon withdrew from
Washington, leaving the protection of
Spanish Interests In the United States to
the French ambassador and the Austro
Hungnrlan minister. Simultaneously with
Its communication to the Spanish minister
Gen. Woodford, the American minister at
Madrid, was telegraphed confirmation of
the text of the Joint resolution and directed
to communicate It to the government ol
Spain with the formal demand that It at
once relinquish Its authority and govern
ment In tho Island of Cuba and withdraw
Its forces therefrom, coupling this demand
with announcements of the Intentions ol
this government as to the future of the Is
land, In conformity with the fourth clause
of the resolution, and giving Spain until
noon of April m to replj
The demand, although, as above shown,
officially made known to the Spanish envoy
here, was not delivered at Madrid. Aftet

pain and Other Conntrlea NotlUed of
Ueglanlng of Hoattlltlea.
Spain having thus denied the demand of
the United States and Initiated that com
plete form of rupture of relations which
attends a state of war, the executive pow
ers authorized by the resolution were at
once used by me to meet the enlarged con
tingency of actual war between Spain and
the United States. On April 22 I pro
claimed a blockade of the northern coast of
Cuba, Including ports on said coast be
tween Cardenas snd Bahla Honda and the
port of Clenfuegos on tbe south coast of
Cuba; and on the 23d I called for volun
teers to execute the purpose of the resolu
tion. By my message of April 26, the con
gress was Informed of the situation and I
recommended formal declaration of the
existence of a state of war between the
United States and Spain. The congress
accordingly voted on the same day the
act approved April 25, 1898, declaring the
existence of such war, from and including
the 21st day of April, and reenacted the
provision of the resolution of April 20, di
recting the president to use all the armed
forces of the nation to carry that act into
effect. Due notification of the existence of
war as aforesaid was given April 26 by
telegraph to all the governments with
which the United States maintain relations.
In order that their neutrality might be as
sured during the war. The various gov
ernments responded with proclamatlona of
neutrality, each after its own methods.
It Is not among the least gratifying inci
dents of the struggle that the obligations
of neutrality were impartially discharged
by all, often under delicate and difficult
circumstances.
In further fulfillment of International
duty, I Issued April 26 a proclamation an
nouncing the treatment proposed to bs
accorded to vessels and their cargoes as
to blockade, contraband, the exercise of
the right of subjects and the immunity of
neutral flags and neutral goods under ene
my's flag. A similar proclamation was
made by the Spanish government. In the
conduct of hostilities the rules of the dec
laration of Paris, including abatentlon from
resort of privateering, have accordingly
been observed by both belligerents, al
though neither was a party to that dec
laration. Responce to Call for Volunteers.
Our country thus, after an Interval of
half a century of peace with all nations,
found Itself engaged in deadly conflict with
a foreign enemy, livery nerve was strained
to meet the emergency. The response to
the initial call for 125,000 volunteers was
Instant and complete, as was also the result
of the second call of May 25 for 75,000 ad
ditional volunteers. The ranks of the reg
ular army were Increased to the limits
provided by the act of April 26. The enlisted
force of the navy on the 15th of August,
when it reached Its maximum, numbered
24,123 men and apprentices. One hundred
and three vessels were added to the navy
by purchase, one was presented to the
government, one leased, and the four ves
sels of the International Navigation com
pany, the St. Paul, St. Louis, Nt w York and
Paris, were chartered. In addition to these
the revenue cutters and lighthouse tenders
were turned over to the navy department
and became temporarily a part of the aux
iliary navy.
Stren&rth of the Navy.
The maximum effective fighting force of
the navy during the war, separated Into
classes, was as follows: Four battleships
of the first class, one battleship of the sec
ond class, two armored cruisers, six coast
defense monitors, one armored ram, 12
protected cruisers, three unprotected
cruisers, 18 gunboats, one dynamite
cruiser, 11 torpedo boats, 14 old vessels of
the old navy, Including monitors. Auxil
iary navy: Auxiliary cruisers, 28 converted
yachts: 27 converted tugs, 19 converted col
liers, 15 revenue cutters, four lighthouse
tenders and 19 miscellaneous vessels.
Defense of the Coast.
Much alarm was felt along our entire
Atlantic seaboard lest some attack might
be made by the enemy. livery precaution
was taken to prevent possible injury to
our great cities lying along the coast.
Temporary garrisons were provided, drawn
from the state militia; infantry and light
batteries were drawn from the volunteer
force. A'bout 12,Oc.O troops were thus em
ployed. The coast signal service was es
tablished for observing the approach of an
enemy's ships to the coast of the United
8tates and the llfe-savlnp and lighthouse
services cooperated, which enabled the
navy department to have all portions of the
Atlantic coast, from .Maine to Texas, under
observation. The auxiliary navy was cre
ated under the authority of congress, and
was oflici red and manm d by the naval
militia of the several states. This organ
ization patrolled the coast, and p rformed
the duty ol a second arm of defense.
rMnntlnp; of Mines.
Under the direction of the chief of engi
neers submarine mines were placed at the
most exposed points. Before the outbreak
of the war permanent mining casemates
and cable galleries had been constructed
at all important harbors. Most of the tor
pedo material was not to be found in the
market and had to be specially manufac
tured. Under date of April 19 district offi
cers were directed to take all preliminary
measures, short of the actual attaching of
the loaded mines to the cables, and on
April 22 telegraphic orders were issued to
place the loaded mines In position. The
aggregate number of mines placed was
1,535 at the principal harbors from Maine
to California. Preparations were also made
for the planting of mines at certain other
harbors, I ,it owing to the early destruction
of the Spanish fleet these mines were not
plaoed.
The Sternal Oorpa.
The signal corps was promptly organized
and performed service of most difficult and
important character. Its operations dur
ing the war covered the electrical connec
tion of all coast fortifications, the estab
lishment of telephonic and telegraphic facil
ities for the camps at Manila, Santiago
and in Porto Rico. There were constructed
800 miles of line at ten great camps, thus
facilitating military movements from
those points In a manner heretofore un
known in military administration. Field
telegraph lines were established and main
tained under the enemy's fire at Manila
and later tho Manila-Hong-Kong cable was
reopened. In Porto Itlco cable communi
cations were opened over a discontinued
route, and on land the headquarters of the
commanding officer wns kept In tele
graphic or telephonic communication with
the division commanders of four different
lines of operation. There was placed In
Cuban waters a completely outfitted cable
ship with war cables and cable gear suit
able both for the destruction of communi
cations belonging to the enemy and the
establishment of our own. Two ocean
cables were destroyed under the enemy's
batteries at Santlngo. The day previous to
the landing of Gen. Shaffer's corps nt Cai
manera, within 20 miles of the landing
dace, cable communications were estab
Ished and cable station opened, giving di
rect communication with tho government
at Washington This service was Invalu
able to the executive In directing the opera
tions ( f the army and navy.
With a total force of over 1.800 the loss
was, by disease In camp and field, officers
and men included, only five.
Wnr Revenue.
The national defense under the $50,000,000
fund was expended In large part by the
army and navy and tho objects for which
It was used are fully shown In the reports
of the several secretaries It was e most
timely appropriation, ennhllr" the govern
ment tn strengthen Its defense and making
preparations greatly needed In cneof war.
This fund helng Inadequate to the require
ments of equipment and for tho conduct of
the war, the patriotism of the congress pro
vided the means In the war revenue act of
June 13, by authorizing a three per cent,
popular loan not to exceed 1400,000,000 and
by levying additional Imposts and taxes.
Of the authorized loan. $200,000,000 were of
fered and promptly taken, the subscrip
tions so far exceeding the call as to cover
it many times over, white, preference he
lng given to the smaller bids, no single allot
ment exceeded $r.000. This was a most en
couraging and significant result, showing
the vast resources of the nation and the
determination of the people to uphold their
country's honor.
BRIBF HISTORY OP THE WAR.
Leading; Rnaraare-ments and Thrilling
Achievement Recounted.
It ll not within the province of this mes
sage to nsrrste the history of the' ex
traordinary war that followed the Spanish
declaration of April 21, but a brief recital
of Its more salient features Is approprists
The fltst er.eoui ;et o' the war ir. polr.t of
date took place April 27, when a detach
ment cl the blockudliiK squadron made a
reconnolssance In force at Matanxaa,
shelkd the harbor forts and at mollsned
several new works In construction.
Dewey's Victory.
The next engagtuu nt was destined to
mark a memorable epoch In maritime war
fare. The Pacific diet, undei ommodore
George Dewey, had lain for tomt weeks at
Hong-Kong. Upon the colonial proclama
tion of neutrality bm g Issued and the
customary 24 hours' notice being given. It
repaired to Mlrs bay, ruar Hong-Kong,
whence It proceeded to the Philippine Is
lands uvder telegraphic orders to capture
or destroy the formidable Spanish fleet then
assembled at Manila. At daybreak on the
1st of May the American force entered Ma
nila bay and after s few hours' engage
ment effected the total destruction of the
Spar.Ush fleet, consisting of ten warships
and a transport, besides capturing the
naval station ana forts at Cavlte. thus nr
nihllating the Spanish power In the Pacific
ocean and completely controlling the Bay
of Manila, with the ability to take the city
at will. Not a life was lost on our ships,
the wounded only numbering seven, while
not a vessel was materially Injured. For
this gallant achievement the congress, up
on my recommendation, fitly bestowed up
on theactors present permanent and sub
stantial reward.
The effect of thla remarkable victory
upon the spirit of our people and upon the
fortunes or the war was instant. A pres
tige of Invincibility thereby attached to
our arms, which continued throughout the
struggle. Reenforcementa were hurried to
Manila under the command of Maj. Gen.
Merrttt, and firmly established within stght
of the capital, which lay helpless before
our guns. On the seventh day of May the
government was advised officially of the
I victory of Manila, and at once inquired ot
the commander of our fleet what troopa
would be required. The information waa
received on the 15th of May, and the first
army expedition sailed May 25, and ar
rived off Manila June 80. Other expeditions
soon followed, the total force, consisting
I of 641 officers and 15,058 men.
Only reluctance to cause needless loss
1 of life and property prevented the early
storming and capture of the city and
therewith the absolute military occupancy
of the whole group. The insurgents
meanwhile had resumed tbe active hos
tilities suspended by the uncompleted trues
of December, 1897. Their forces invested
Manila from the northern and eastern side,
but were constrained by Admiral Dewey
and Gen. Merrltt from attempting an as
sault. It was fitting that whatever was
done in the way of decisive operations in
I that quarter should be accomplished by
' the strong arm of the United States alone.
: Obeying the atern precept of war, which
enjoins the overcoming of the adversary
and the extinction of his power wherever
assailable, as the speedy and sure means
to win a peace, divided viotory was not
permlssable, for no partition of the rights
and responsibilities attending the enforce
ment of a Just and advantageous peace
could be thought of.
Following the comprehensive scheme of
general attack powerful forces were as
sembled at various points on our coast to
Invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Meanwhile
naval demonstrations were made at several
exposed points. On May 11, the cruiser
Wilmington and torpedo boat Wlnslow
were unsuccessful in an attempt to silence
the batteries at Cardenas, against Matan
zas, Worth Bagley and four seamen fall
ing. These grievous fatalities were strange
ly enough among the very few which oc
curred during our naval operations in this
extraordinary conflict.
Advance of Cervera's Fleet.
Meanwhile the Spanish naval prepara
tions had been pushed with great vigor. A
powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera,
which had assembled at the Cape Verde
islands before rhe outbreak of hostilities,
had crossed the ocean and by Its erratic
movements in the Caribbean sea delayed
our military operations while baffling the
pursuit of our fleets. For a time fears were
felt lest tho Oregon and Marietta, then
noarir.K horde after their long voyage from
San Francisco of over 15,tn 0 miles, might
be surprised by Admiral Cervcra's fleet
but their fortunate ar rival dispelled these
apprehensions and lent much needed reen
torcements, Not until Admiral Cervera
took refuge in the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba about May 9 was it practicable to
plai a systematic military attack upon the
Antillean possessions of Spain.
Several demonstrations occurred on the
of Cuba ai d l orto Kico In prepara
tion for the larger event. On May in the
North Atlantic squadron shelled San Juan
do Porto Rico. On May 30 Commodore
Schley's sou ulron bombarded the forts
guarding the mouth of Santiago harbor.
Neither att ic k had any material result. It
was evident that well-ordered land opera
tions were Indispensable to achieve s de
cisive advantage.
HubNon'a Unnd of Heroes.
The next act in the war thrilled not alone
the hearts of our countrymen but the world
by its exceptional heroism. On tho night
of June 3 Liout. Hobs n, aided by seven
dovoted volunteers, blocked the narrow
outlet from Santiago harbor by sinking the
collier Merrirnac in the channel, under a
fierce fire from the shore batteries, escap
ing with their lives as by a miracle, but
falling into the bands of the Spaniards. It
is a most gratifying incident of the war
that the bravery of this little band of
heroes was cordially appreciated by the
Spaniar ds. who sent a flag of truce to notify
Admiral Sampson of their safety and to
compliment them on their daring act. They
were subsequently exchanged July 7.
Full uf on n in na mo.
By June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban
cable Isolated the Island. Thereafter the
Invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On
June 10, under a heavy protecting Are, a
landing of 600 marines from the Oregon,
Marblehcad and Yankee was effected In
Guantanamo bay, where it had been deter
mined to establish a naval station. This
Important and essential port was taken
from the enemy after severe fighting by
the marines, who were the first organized
force of the United States to land In Cuba.
The position so won was held, despite dea-
J era to attempts to dislodge our forces. By
une 16 additional forces were landed and
strongly intrenched. On June 22 the ad
vance of the Invading army under Maj. !
Gen. Shafter landed at Balqulrl, about 11 j
miles east of Santiago. This waa accom- j
pllshed under great difficulties, but with '
marvelous aispatcn.
i III: HANTIAGO CAMPAIGN.
Its Snececsfnl laaue Gave Us the En
tire Eastern End of Cuba.
On June 23 the movement against San
tiago was begun. On the 24th the first se
rious engagement took place, in which the
First and Tenth cavalry and the First
United States volunteer cavalry, Gen.
Young's brigade of Gen. Wheeler's division,
participated, losing heavily. By nightfall,
however, ground within live miles of San
tiago was won. The advantage was stead
ily Increased. On July 1, a severe battle
took place, our forces gaining the out
works of Santiago; on the second El Caney
and San Juan were taken after a desperate
charge, and the investment of the city was
completed. The navy cooperated by shell
ing the town and the coast forts.
sinking of the Spanish Fleet.
On the day following this brilliant
achievement of our land forces, July 8,
occurred the decisive naval combat of the
war. The Spanish fleet, attempting to
leave the harbor, was met by the American
squadron under command of Commodore
Sampson. In less than three hours all the
Spanish ships were destroyed, the two
torpedo boats being sunk, and the Maria
Teresa, Almirante Oquendo, Vlzcaya and
Cristobal Colon driven ashore. The Span
ish admiral and over 1,300 men were taken
prisoners, while the enemy's loss was de
plorably large, some 600 perishing. On
our side but one man was killed, on the
Brooklyn, and one man was seriously
wounded. Although our ships were re
peatedly struck, not one was seriously In
jured. Where all so conspicuously dis
tinguished themselves, from the command
ers to the gunners and the unnamed heroes
in the boiler rooms, each and all contribut
ing toward the achievement of this as
tounding victory, for which neither an
cient nor modern history affords a parallel
In the completeness of the event and the
marvelous disproportion of casualties, It
would be Invidious to single out any for
speclal honor. Deserved promotion has
rewarded the more conspicuous actors the
nation's profoundest gratitude Is due to all
of those brave men who by their skill and
devotion In a few short hours crushed the
sea power of Spain and wrought a triumph
whose decisiveness and far-reaching con
sequences can scarcely be measured. Nor
can we be unmindful of the achievements
of our builders, mechanics, and artisans
for their skill In the construction of our
warships.
With the catastrophe of Santiago Spain's
effort uron the ocean virtually ceased. A
spasmodic effort toward the end of June
to ssnd her Mediterranean fleei under Ad
miral Camara to relieve Manila was
abandoned, the expedition being recalled
after It had passed through the Sues
canal.
Capture of Santlnvo.
The capitulation of Santiago followed.
The city was closely besieged by land, while
the entrance of our ships Into the harbor
cut off all relief on that side. After a truce
to allow of the removal of noncombatants
protracted negotiations continued from
July 8 until July 15, when, under menace
of Immediate assault the preliminaries of
surrender were agreed upon. On the 17th
Gen. Shafter occupied the city. The capitu
lation embraced the entire eastern end of
Cuba. The number of Spanish soldiers sur
rendered waa 22,000, all of whom were sub
sequently conveyed to Spain at the chargs
of the United States.
Gratitude of the Nation.
The story of this successful camualcrn Is
told In the report of the secretary of war i
wnicn win do lata oerore you. rne inal
vtdual valor of oiflcers and soldiers was
never more strikingly shown than In the
several engagements leading to the sur
render of Santiago, while the prompt move
ments and successive victories won Instant
and universal applause. To those who
fi allied this complete triumph, which estab
shed the ascendency of the United States
upon land as the fight off Santiago had fixed
our supremacy on the seas, the earnest and
lasting gratitude of the nation is unspar
ingly due. Nor should we alone remember
the gallantry of the living; the dead claim
our tears, and our losses by battle and dis
ease must cloud any exultation at the re
sult and teach us to weigh the awful cost
of war, however rightful the cause or sig
nal the victory.
MILES
AT PORTO RICO.
Brief
ulatory of the Expedltloa
to That Island.
With the fall of Santiago, the occupation
; of Porto Blco became the next strategic
necessity. Gen. Miles had previously been
assigned to organise an expedition fdr that
purpose. Fortunately he was already at
! Santiago, where he had arrived on the 11th
, of July, with reenforcements for Gen.
Shatter's army. With these troops, consist
ing of 3,416 infantry and artillery, two com
panies of engineers and one company of
the signal corp&, Gen. Miles left Guantana
mo on July 21, having nice transports con
voyed by the fleet under Capt. HlKginson,
j with the Massachusetts (flagship), Oixls,
Gloucester, Columbia and Yale, the two
latter carrying troops. The expedition
landed at Guanica July 25, which port was
entered with little opposition. Here the
fleet was Joined by the Annapolis and ths
. Wasp, while the Puritan and Amphltrits
went to San Juan and Joined the New Or
leans, which was engaged In blockading
that port. The major general commanding
was subsequently reenfor?d by Gen.
Schwann's Brigade of the Third army
corps, by Gen. Wilson, with a part of bis
division, and also by Gen. Brooke, with a
Sart of nis oorps, numbering In all 16,973 of
cers and men. Or Julf 27 he entered
Ponce, one of the most Important ports In
the island, from which he thereafter di
rected operations for the capture of the
island.
With the exception of encounters with
the enemy at Guayama, Hermlguerez,
Coamo and Yauco, and an attack on a force
landed at Cape San Juan, there was no so-
rious. resistance. The campaign was prose
cuted with great vigor, and by the 12th of
August much of the island was In our pos
session and the acquisition of the remainder
' was only a matter of a short time. At
I most of the points In the island our troops
j were enthusiastically welcomed. Protesta-
tlons of loyalty to the flag and gratitude for
I delivery from Spanish rule met our com
! manders at every stage. As a potent in
, fluence toward peace, the outcome of the
I Porto Rican expedition was of great con
i sequence, and generous commendation 1b
, due to those who participated in it.
Fall of Manila.
The last scene of the war was enacted at
( Manila, its starting place. On August 16,
. after a brief assault upon the works by the
; land forces, in which the squadron assisted,
I the capital surrendered unconditionally.
1 The casualties were comparatively few.
i By this conquest of the Pbllllpnlne Islands,
; virtually accomplished when the Spanish
capacity for resistance was destroyed by
i Admiral Dewey's victory of the 1st of ,
May, was formally sealed. To Gen. Mer- j
ritt, his officers and men for their ttneorn- '
plaining and devoted s rvices for their gal- j
lantry in action, the nation is sincerely
grateful. Their long voyage was made
with singular success, and the soldierly j
conduct of the men. most of whom were !
without previous expei lencs In the military i
service, deserves unmeasured praise.
Our liessSS.
The total casualties In killed and wounded !
1 In the army during the war was as follows: i
Ofltoers killed, 23; el lls( 1 men killed, 257:
total, "n , t;icers wounded, 113; enlisted
men wounded, 1,464 I taL 1.87T. Of the 1
navy: Killed, 17; w dod, 91; died as result
of wounds, 1; Invalided from service, 6;
1 total, 91. It will te observed that while our
navy was engaged In two preat battles and j
In numerous perilous undertakings in the I
blockades and bombardment and more :
than fo,0(X) of our troops were transported I
to distant lands and engaged In assault
j and sle;re and battle and many skirmishes '
I in unfamiliar territory, wo lost in both I
I arms of the service a total of L66I killed and
Wounded; and in the entire campaign by
land and sea we did not lose a gun or a
flag or a transport or a shin, and with the '
, exception of the crew of the Merrlmac, not
i a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner.
Troops Ketnrn.
On August 7. 46 days from the date of the
landing of Gen. Siiafter's army In Cuba,
I and 21 days from the surrender of Santiago,
, the United States troops commenced em
j barkation for home and our entire force
was returned to the United States as early
I as August 24. They wtre absent from the
United States only two months.
Tribute to Patriotism,
It Is fllting that I should bear testimony
to the patriotism and devotion of that
large portion of our army which, although
eager to be order, d ' 'he post of greatest
exposure, fortunate, y was not required out
side of the United HI S. They did their
whole duty, and like ihclr comrades at the
front, have earned the gratitude of the
nation. In like manner, the orhcors and
men of the army and of the navy who re
mained in their departments and stations
Of the navy, performing most Important
duties connected wllh the war, and whose
requests for usignir.cnt in the field and at
sea it Waa compelled to refuse because
their services were Indispensable here, are
entitled to the highest commendation. It
Is my regret that there seems to be no pro
vision for their suitable recognition.
Work of the Red Cross.
In this connection, it Is a pleasure for
elation the timely and useful work of the
American National Bed Cross, both In re- 1
lie! measures preparatory to the campaign,
In sanitary assistance at several of the
camps of assemblage and later, under the
able and experienced leadership of the
president of the society, Miss Clara Bar
ton, on the fields of battle and In the hos
pitals at the front in Cuba. Working in
conjunction with the governmental au
thorities and under their sanction and ap-
rroval, and with the enthusiastic coopera
lon of many patriotic women and soci
eties In the various states, the Red Cross
has fully maintained its already high repu
tation for intense eagerness and ability to
exercise the noble purpose of its Interna
tional organization, thus Justyfying the
confidence and Bupport which It has re
ceived at the hands of the American peo
ple. To the members and officers of this
society and all who aided them in their
philanthropic work, the sincere and lasting
fratitude of the soldiers and tbe public is
ue, and Is freely accorded.
In tracing these events we are constantly
reminded of our obligations to the Divine
Master for Hla watchful care over us and
Ills safe guidance, for which the nation
makes reverent acknowledgement, and of
fers humble prayer for the continuance of
Ills favor.
