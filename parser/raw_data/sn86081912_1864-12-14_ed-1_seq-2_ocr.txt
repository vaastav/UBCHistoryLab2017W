hat Missouri, Iv ntuoky, Tennessee, and
puts of other states bave again produced
reasonably fair crops.
CEN. SHERMAN'S ADVANCE.
The most remarkable feature in the tr.tii
tary operations of tfcfl year, ie General Sher
man's attempted march of three hundred
miles directly through the iusurgent region.
It tends to show a great increase of our rel
ativo strength,that our general in chief should
feel able to confront and hold in check every
active force of the enemy, and yet to detach
a well appointed large army to move on such
an expedition. The result not yet being
koown, corjecture in regard to it is not here
indulged. Important movements have also
occurred during the year to tne effect of
moulding society.for durability in the Lnion
although short of c -mplete success; it i 3 so
much in the right direction that twelve thou
sand citizens in each of the States of Arkan
sas and Louisiana have organized loyal slate
government with free cor.s'itutions, and are
earnestly struggling to maintain andadmiuis
ter them.
The movemtnt in the same direction, more
extensive though less definite iu Missouri,
Kentucky, and Tennessee, should not be
overlooked.
MARYLAND.
But Maryland presants the example of
complete success. Maryland is secure to
liberty and Union for all the future. The
genius of rebellion will no more claim Mary
land, Like another loul spirit, being driven
out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo
her no more.
THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.
At the last session of Congress a proposed
amendment of the Constitution abolishing
slavery throughout the United States, passed
the Senate, but failed for lack of the requi
site two thirds vote in the House of Repre
sentatives. Although the present is the
same Congress, and nearly the same mem
bers, and without questioning the wisdom or
patriotism of those who stood in opposition
I venture to recommeud the reconsideration
and passage of the measure at the present
session. Of course the abstract question is
not changed, but an intervening election
shows almost ceitainty that the next Con
gress will pass the measure, if this does not.
Hence, there is only a question of time as
to when the proposed amendment will go to
the states for their action, and as it is to so
go at all events, may wc not agree that the
sooner the better. It is not claimed that the
election has imposed a duty on members to
change their view or their votes any further
than as an additional element to he consider
ed as iheir judgment may be affected by it.
Tt is the voice of the people, now for the first
time heard upon the question. In a great
national crisis like ours, unanimity of action
among those seeking a common end is very
desirable, almost indispensable, and yet no
approach to such unanimity is attainable
unless some deference shall be paid to tne
will of the majority, simply because it is the
will of the majority.
THE RF.CEST ELECTION.
In this case, the common end is the main
tenance of the Union, and among the means
to 6ecure that end, such will, through the
election, is most clearly declared in favor of
■uch constitutional amendment. The most
reliable indication of public purpose in this
country ia derived through our popular elec
tion*. Judging by the recent canvass and
its result, the purpose of the people within
the loyal s'ates to maintain the integrity of
the Union was never more firm nor more
nearly unanimous than now. The extraordi
nary calmness and good order with which
the inHlions of voters met and mingled at
the polls, give strong assurance of this. Not
only all those who supported the "union
ticket" (so called) but a great majority of
the opposing party also may be fairly claimed
to entertain and to be astuated by the same
purpose. It is an unanswerable argument to
this effect, that no candidate for any office
whatever, high or lew, has ventured to seek
votes on the avowal that he was for giving
up the Union. There has heen much im
pugning of motives aud much heated confro
versy as to the proper means and best mode
of advancing the Union cause, but in the
distinct issue of Union or IIJ Union, the poll
ticians have shown their instinctive knowl
edge that there is no diversity among the
people. In affording the people the fair
opportunity of showing one to another, and to
the world, this firmness and unanimity of
purpose, the election has been of vast value
to the national cause. The election has ex
hibited anothei fact not less valuable to be
known, the fact that we do no; approach
exhaustion in the most important branch of
Ihe nat ional resources—that of living men.
"While it is inelancholly to reflect that the
war has filled so many graves and carried
mourning to so unny hearts, it is some re
lief to know that, compared with the surviv
ipg, the fallen ha.*e been so few. While
corps and divisions and brigades and rcgi*
ments have formed and fought and dwindled
and gone out of existence, a great majority of,
the men who composed them are still living

of those states, could not vote away from j

less than 90.000. Nor yet is this ail. The .
r.uinbtr in organized territories is triple now
what it was f. ar years ogo— while thousands
white and black—Join us at the national
arms press back the insurgent lines, so much ;
is shown affirmatively and by the
elect'ori. It is not material to inquire how :
the increase has been produced, or to show j
that it would have been g'eater but for the
war, which is probably true; the important j
fact remains demonstrated, that wc have,
more men new than we had when the war
be an, that we are not exhausted nor in ;
process of exhaustion ; that we are gaining j
strength, and may, if need be, maintain the '
contest indefinitely. This as to men.
Material resources are now inoie complete
and abundant than ever. The national re
sources, are inexhausted, and, as we believe,
inexhaustable, The public purpose to re
establish and maintain the national authori- '
ty is unchanged, and. as we believe, unchang
able- The maimer of continuing the effort
remains to choose.
NEGOTIATION.
On careful consideration of all the evidence
accessible, it seems to me that no attempt
at negotiation with the insurgent leaders
Could result in any good. He would accept of
nothing short of severance of the Union, llis
declarations to this affect are explicit and oft
repeated, He does not attempt U deceive us.
He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves.
We cannot voluntarily yield it. Between
him and us the imie is distinct, simple, and
inflexible. It is an issue which cau only be
tried by war, and by victory. If wo yield
we are beaten. If the southern people fad
, him, he is beaten. Either way it would be
the victory and defeat following war. What
is true however, of hirn who leads the insur
gent cause, is not necessarily true of those
who follow. Although he cannot reaccept
the I riion, tbey can. Some of them we
know already desire peace and reunion
The number of such may increase. They
can at any moment have peace, simply by
laying down their arms and submitting to
the national authority under the Constitu
tion. After so much, the government could
not, if it would, maintain war against Ihetn.
Ihe loyal people would not sustain or allow
it. If questions should remain, we would
adjust them by the peaceful means of legisla
tion, conference, courts and votes, operating
only in constitutional and lawful channels
Some certain and other possible questions
are and would be beyond the executive pow
er to adjust, as, for instance, the admission of
members into Congress, and whatever might
might require the appropriation of money.
AM NEST R.
The executive power itself would be great
ly diminished by the cessation of actual war.
Fardons and remissions of forfeiture, however
would Siili be within executive control. In
what spirit and temper this
cAt-icisea can be fairly judged of by the
past. A year ago general pardon and amnes
ty upon spec fied term? were offered to all,
except cer'ain designated classes?, and it was
at the same Time made, known that the ex
cepted classes were stl in contemplation of
special clemency. During the year many
availed themselves of the(general prevision,
and many more wou'd, only that the signs
of bail faith in some led to such precautionary
measures as rendered the practical process
less easy and certain. During the same
time, also special pardons bave been granted
to individuals of excepted classes, and no
voluntary application has been denied.
A THREAT.
Thus practically the door has been for a
full year open to all, except such as were not
in c ndition to make free choice ; that is.
such as were in custo ly or under restraint.
It is still so open to all- But the time may
come, probably will come, when public duty
demand that it be closed, and that in lieu
more vigorous measures than heretofore shall
be adopted.
CONDITIONS OF PEACE.
In presenting the abondonment of armed
resistance to the national authority on the
part of (he insurgents as the only indispens
able condition to ending the war >n the part
of ihe governmeut, I retract nothing hereto
fore said as to slavery. I repeat the declara
tion made a year ago, that while I remain in
iny present position I shall not attempt to
re'ract or modify the Emancipation Procla
mation. Nor shall I return to slavery any
person who is free by the terms of the proc
lunation, or by any of the acts of Congress.
If the people should, by whatever mode or
means, make it an executive duty to re-en
clave such persons, another, and not 1, must
be their instrument to perform it.
In stating a single nondition of peace, I
mean simply to say, that the war will cease
on the part of the government whenever it
shall have ceased ou the part of those who
began it.

TUNKHANNOCK, PA
Wednesday, Dee. 14, 1864
Political Preacher*.
We hope our Demoeratic friends throughout the
country will keep in kindly remembrance the pro
fessed Ministers of the Gospel, who during the late
campaign, left their pulpits an l went preaching for
Lincoln and Abolitionism, The time is coming
when these hypocritical pretenders . will want pay.
Let those whom they have denounced refuse to give
them a cent. Democrats remember them.—Demo
crat, Bloomsburg.
The above suggestion, or something of sim
ilar import, we now find in almost every
Democratic paper. With this difference, it
is applicable to the case of mo6t of the preach
ers of this region. Here, these abolition war
preachers, do not ''leave the pulpit" to dis
pense their nigger doctrines, but rather, use
it, as their rostrum, to give their partisan ha
rangues a show of truth and respectability.
We heartily endorse the doctrine, that those
for whom they preach should support them.
When a man, professing to be called of
God, to pre tch the Gospel, so far forgets his
duty to God and his fellow men, as to engage
in stirring up strife, contention, and blood
shed among the people, ana encouraging ha
tred, revenge and all the baser passions of
the human breast—we say, when a man does
this, we think it a high christian duty for
every man and woman to wash their hands
of the stain of feeding such "wolves in sheep's
clothing." We do not imagine that what we
have to say on this subject, will diminish
the amount that will be given to these blood
suckers, these parusiUs in communities where
they live They will, doubtless, be sustained
by those for whom they preach,and in whose
interests they labor. This is as it should be.
If those who do not approve ol their aboli
tion war preaching, have charities to bestow,
theyjeanaof fail to find worthier objects on
which to bestow tin in.
The land is filled with helpless, half-fed,
half-clothed, dependent widows and orphans.
Shall bread be taken from' their famished
n"uths, and raiment from their shivering
limbs, to feed and clothe these fat, cleek,
worthless, impious, vagabond, abolition
preachers? We think it ,ual
the burthens and respensib-lities of so doing,
should be taken from the patient, long suffer
ing over taxed masser. Hereafter, let negro
worshippers. shoddy contractors and govern
ment office holders support negro-worship
ping preachers ! Let christian men and wnr
men start a widows and orphan's aid society
in every town ; and give their mites, to those
who are deserving and needy.
To those who may think that we are
ing in respect fur the ministerial office, we
willjsay; that for the true uieeic and lowly
apostles of the Saviour we always have en
tertained and still do entprtain the highest
regard ; but for these pretende r s these cant
ing hypocrites, we have no sentiment or feel
ing, but of loathing and contempt. And, if
we can aid in teaching the succeeding gener
ation, to despise them as heartily as we do,
we think we 6hall have done goo 1 service, in
the cause of humanity and Christianity.
xrar The blower of th e nigger organ, of
this place, gave his readers, last week, a long
winded homily on the duty they owed to
! their children to furnish them good, moral
j abolition newspapers. One would suppose,
| that this self appointed teacher, had, by prac
i ticing what he preaches , furnished to the
i world some very exemplary specimens of the
i "rising generation." Wo propose, shortly,
1 time a.id space permitting, to preach—thro'
the columns of the Lemocrat , for the benefit
; of this preacher ed tor, and others of his cloth
'a sh jrt, practical sermon on the text ; "By
' their FRUITS ye shall know them."
The Message.
The President's message which we publish
| to day, entire, is, to use the very classical
lnguage of that high functionary tn relation
, to th j Maryland election, "a big thing."—
We are only able to glance at a few points in
! this important state paper. Our want of
i classical knowledge prevents an appreciation,
by u, of all its beauties.
In adverting to our foreign relations, the
President congratulates himself and the na
j tion, that we are on the most peaceful footing
! with Ca6ta Ilica, Nicaraugua, Hayti, Liberia,
j and all the rest of the nigger and half nigger
I kingdoms, principalities, and republics of the
world. England, Franco, Husia, and other
European nations, made up, as they are, of
i "white trash," he does not deign to noliee.
j With China, Ezypt, and the Barbary states,
i too, "the most amicable relations exist."
i Oflicial correspondence with Liberia lias given
the President a "pleasing view of social and
political progress in that Republic." There
i is only one little dark spot to mar the beauty
of the prospect. Some of the igerant "Afri
:cm gentleman" of "African descent," make
occasional raids upou the American gcutle
mon and women of the same descent and car
ry them off to feaat upon their fat carcasses,'!
jor sell them into slavery. Our humane
1 President asks authority ot Congress to send
| a gunboat to his Liberian friends; but seems
to entirely forget that the native races may
thereby take offence, and our harmonious
••elations with them be disturbed. It is to
" *hat this suggestion will not be
the next annual rnes
that the;
hopeu
adupti'J —otherwise
..je,™*.!! P' b ' W 5" U
friendly relations existing between us and
the kingdbifaftof Guinea, Sackatoo, Ninkapoo
and other great central African powera have
been slightly disturbed—by this gunboat.
On the subject of the finances we find in
the message a suggestion that Congress
should not only secure the government bond
holders against taxes ; but that they should
also exempt them from the payment of their
debts. Is it possible that Mrs. Lincoln's
millinery bills, or old Abe's bill with his
glove-maker, has been the father of this
brilliant idea 7 Or are the greedy Hotel and
boarding house keepers pursuing the govern
ment clerks and contractors for the last
quarter's board ? ID either case, relief sho'd
by all means be granted by Congress' passing
this bankrupt bill. Another idea on the
subject of finance, would, but for the presi
dent's sagacity, have escaped the attention of
the taxpayers of the country. He says:
"The great advantages of being creditors as
well as debtors with relation to the public
debt is obvious." Men cannot be much op
pressed by a debt which they owe to them
selves." The next time the government tax
collector comes around, of course every "Lay
aC man will empty his pockets of all he has,
for he would only be paying a debt which he
owes to himself. Certainly every man should
deal h mostly with himself. This new finan
cial idea, tuny, to the ignorant masses
seem to conflict with tbe proposition—which
also originate with the sage of Sangamon—
that it is easier to pay a small debt than a
"big one but this apparent discrepancy, is
easily understood, when we reflect that "the
world moves."
While we are told that there are 50,000
names on the invalid and pension rolls, our
hopeful President still adheres to his original
declarations that 'there's nothing the matter
nobody's hurt." On this point he says: j
'"While It is melancholy to reflect that the
war has filled so many graves ard carried
mourning to so many hearis, it is some relief
to know that compared with the surviving,
the fallen have been so few. While crps
and divisions and brigades ar.d legimenis
have formed and fought and dwindled, gme
out of exi*tance, a great majority of the men
who compose i them are still living. 'lite
election returns prove this, So many voters
could not else be found."
It will certainly be a great source of con
solation to the hundreds of thousands of wid*
ows and orphans in the land, to know that
those whom they have mourned as dead, are
still living-and able to vote. If they should'nt
exactly see the poii.f, they cannot fail to dis
cover that the number of men killed, as coin
pared with those still living , is/eir. hat
homeless widows, or shivering orphans will
be "disloyal" enough to grieve for a husband
or father, when they reflect that there are
"mors men living now than when the war
began."
On the nigger question, tho ,JC, "' al
K .. stiller ttian ever. Ho has con
cluded tocon'rnue his "bull against the com
et" in full force and virtue. The late elec
tion is considered as a complete endorsement
of all that has been done or may hereafter be
done by him—against the cornet. The few
Democratic congressmen, who Voted for "the
constitution as it is," at the last session, are
now modestly asked to give up their preju
dices in favor of that instrument, and aid the
abolitionists in making such changes as they
may deem best. For, says he, "it is only a
question of lima." The new congress, which
will meet in March next, will certainly "pass
the measure, if this does not." The feeble
highwayman finding himself overpowered by
a man whom he has attacked, begs him, to
join in kis iutamous calling ; and tells him, if
he don't, the next man he meets will. This
kind o( argument cannot fail to abolitionize
all the Democratic Congressmen, who have
stood as a wall of fire against the assaults of
the abolition destructionists for the past two
years. We had supposed that the question
of nigger or no nigger, in these United States,
had been settled by proclamation. The
President's wish for Congress to do again,
what has already been done, can only be ex
plained by the declamation, that, "the execu
tive power itself would be greatly diminished
by the cessation of actual war." He seems
to greatly bar that the war ms/V stop ; and
his proclamations may thereby be shorn cf
their efficacy. What a pity it would bo if
his "bull" should cease bunting the "comet;"
and it should escape unharmed. On this
subject he says :
"I repeat the declaration made a year ago
that while I remain in my present position I
shall not attempt to retract or modify the
Emancipation proclamation. "Nor shall I
return to slavery any person who is free by
the terms of that proclama' ion, or by any of
the acts of Congress. If the people hsould,
by whatever tnode or means, make it an ex
ecutive duty to re-enslave such persons, an
other, and not I, must be their instrument to
perform it."
It is a matter of serious alarm when we
reflect that we are liable in any event to
loose the invaluable services of the sa.-e of
Sangamon ! Only think of it; suppose a
new set of Webstere, Clays Casscs aud Ben
tons should get into Congress and upon a
restoration of peace and the union, should
attempt to carry out the provisions of the
Constitution by a fugitive slave law, such a
that of 1850. Mr. Lincoln—although he has
laken a solemn oath to support it— would
not be the instrument of such designing men
to carry out the law.
What a misfortune to the country, if in
such an event, he should— resign ? Such a
contingency is to terrible for contemplation !
Heaven forefend thi c great calamity !
On the subject of Peace the President
says.* "Tne war will cease on the part of the
government whenever it shall have ceased on
the part of those who began it.
Those inen who voted for Lincoln's re elec
tion, on the supposition that it would show
the rebels that "we were in earnest " and
that they would then "throw down their
arms and beg for mercy ;" must, on reading
this, the last sentence of the message, con
clude that the punctillious Johnies are wait
ing for ojicial knowledge of the fact. For,
instead of informing us,as from promises wo
had a right to expect he would—that Jeff
Davis is now before hiin, on his marrow
bones, beggirg for mercy and forgiveness; be,
like a half whipped school-boy, who has been
fighting a ootitpanioa for. he knows not what
whines oat, "I'll atop palling hair if you will"
Taken altogether, and considering all tbe
circumstances, this message is, most emphat
ically a "big thing."

The War.
(From !he Piladelphia Age of tbe 12th.
The damage which h5 been done to the
Dtich Gap Canal by the continued shelling
of the Confederate batteries on the south side
j of the James, has at length compelled a Fed
' eral movement. On Wednesday last a brig
ade of negro troops was sent up the James a
short di>tance ab the canal, and etnbark
'
|ed on pontoons. They crossed over and
marched down the southern bank until a
point opposite the canal was reached. The
Confederate sharp shooters were driven off
and the negroes began entrenching. Dur
ing the night a rifle pit wa9 dug, and on
Thursday, morning the position was secure
Veryf ew men were killed or wounded on
either side. As the Confederate force was
successful in stopping laboi on the canal, by
breaking the dredging machines, it 1* now to
be seen whether 4 Grant will replace the ma
chines and renew the labor free from moles
lat ion. The Con federale ironclads, moved
down the James on Thursday and came with
in range ol Duch Gap. Up, to Saturday,
however, no hostilities had occurred, and
the Confederates made no attempt to drive
the negroes away. The varioua reports of a
general aovance at Grant's southern wing
towards Stony Creek Stations, on the Wei
don llailroad, which have been preyalent for
some days at length are conftimed by
definite intelligence. Warren's Corps, one
division of Humphreys', and Gregg's cavalry
began a southern.march,on Wednesday last.
1 hey marched down the Jerusalem roadjutd
crossed the Nottaway River on a pontoon
bridge. They are now cut off from commun
ication with Grant's army, and have not
been heard from for some days. This ad
