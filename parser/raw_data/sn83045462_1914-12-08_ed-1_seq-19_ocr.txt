National League Proposes to
Make Marquard Case Test
for Jumpers.
CLARK GRIFFITH THINKS
JOHNSON YET UNSIGNED
Admits Big Pitcher May Have Entered
Into Agreement With
the "Outlaws."
XKW YORK, December 8.?President
Harry N. Hempstead of the New York
< rianta received a unanimous vote of
the support of hie National League (
colleagues last night in making a j
strong issue of Pitcher Rube Mar- j
juard's attempted desertion to the Federal
League. A policy of quick action
was voted secretly r a dinner Mr.
Hempstead gave to the club presidents
?f the Tener circuit at the WaldorfAstoria.
Prior to this the matter had
been discussed with President Ban
Johnson of the American League and
t'halrman August Herrmann of the
national commission. The triumvirate
will sta.id behind the New York club
to the end.
Club owners of both the National
nnd American leagues made no secret
during the day of their desire to have
Marquards dealings with the Brooklyn
independents sifted to the bottom. William
F. Baker of the Phillies, Barney |
Hreyfuss of the Pirates and August I
Herrmann of the Reds were among i
those who condemned the latest at- j
te?npt of the outlaws to wean away |
players under straight contract for ,
3SM5. J. Conway Toole, a prominent j
New York attorney, who has been in J
active touch with base ball affairs, was
called into conference by the major
magnates.
Mr. Toole refused to discuss the situation
further than to say that the New
York club might be expected to take
strong action in the near future. Mr.
Baker and several others were less
Rube Wants to Renig.
It was said last night that Rube Marti
unrd is endeavoring frantically to
l ave the New York club intercede for
him with Robert B. Ward so that he
can refute the contract with the Tip
'"ops. return the $1,500 advance money
:< nd square the unpleasantness of the
. lleged misleading affidavit. It is said
further that Marquard is prepared to
j.lace the blame of his Federal League
dealings upon outside influences. This
phase of the case the New York officials
would not discuss last night.
The National League representatives,
who passed the day at the Waldorf
preparing ammunition for the annual
.Meeting, which opens this afternoon,
were not left without the usual tid
hits of gossip.
Charles L>ooin, the deposed manager
of the Phillies, announced that he had
served ten days* notice on William F.
I laker, his employer. Charlie denied
that be had had any communication
with or from Federal T.eague agents.
1-Jt said that he would be a free agent
n another week, and that he then ,
would go to the club that offered the
most money. i
*1 am through with sentiment." said
i he fiery Dooin. "It hasn't got me any
thing so far. My sentiments always
have been with the National League,
but now I am going after the coin. My
services will be placed at the disposal
f?f the highest bidder. If that happens
, *o be a Federal League club it will not
r * be my fault."
Discusses Johnson Case.
Clark Griffith arrived from "Washington
positive in his assertions that
Walter Johnson had not signed a contract
with the Federal League. Griffith
thinks Walter may have signed an
figreement to go with the outlaws provided
Washington will not agree to
certain terms.
"I offered him $16,000 a year for
three years." said Griffith. "He promised
to notify me as soon as he came
to a definite conclusion. He has sent
me no word. If he had gone to the
Gilmore circuit T should have heard it
before this. Nevertheless there is absolutely
no chance of Johnson playing
in <*hicago. He has a contract from
which the ten-day clause was elimiated
arid he accepted $2,500 on an
option for his services next year. The
Washington club will fight the case to
The highest court if Johnson attempts
to go elsewhere in 1915."
Fred Clarke, the well known wizard
of Pittsburgh, failed to come to terms
' ith Barney I>reyfuss yesterday. He
said that he might decide definitely toorrow
whether he would remain lead'
r of the Pirates.
"Dreyfuss and T have our differences,"
id he, "but they will be settled without
outside aid. I think tomorrow will
s?-ttle my future in base ball. The
mnch looks pretty good to me."
? Clarke said there was absolutely no
possibility of his going with the Fed%
ral League provided he and Dreyfuss
v. trre unable to adjust their differences.
Many Trades Pending-.
Clarke said that until the matter of
is future with Pittsburgh was decided
he would take no part in the trade
talk, which as usual flies thick and
fast. Roger Bresnahan of Chicago and
Pat Moran of Philadelphia, two new
National League leaders, said they were
prepared to trade almost any ball
player of either the Cubs or Phillies.
??Tost of th other managers are of like
mind. But as usual every one wishes
to trade a bottle of skimmed milk for
a good milch cow. Th* rumor was revived
that Mcciraw had entered the
lists for Heine Zimnu-rmann of the
?"ubs. If so the trade has not passed
tli* first stages of speculation.
All of the American League club
presidents except Charles Somers of
Cleveland and Robert L. Fledges of the
St. Louis Browns were here last night.
It is probable that Ban Johnson may
rail a special meeting of the American
League l" fore the end of the week.
.MAY JOIN WITH VIRGINIA
TO IMPROVE CAR SERVICE
.?
Carriers on Old Dominion Line Frequently
Overcrowded. Utilities

Commission Finds.
Co-operative effort may be made by
the public utilities commission of the
T>istri< t and the state corporation commission
of Virginia to improve the
service on the Washington and Old
Oorninion railway line.
Following complaints of the service
the commission today asked the comj.an>
to inform it within ten days of
what steps it promises to take to improve
conditions, and also addressed a
htter to the Virginia commission in
Kichrnond. asking its co-operation in
the endeavor to obtain an improvement
in service.
Observations taken by the commission,
according to its letter to the
company, sh< w that cars arriving at
the 36th and M streets station from
Virginia points frequently are overcrowded.
Observations on November
10, 20 and 24 revealed the fact that
cars arriving from McLean, Va.. carried
as many as twenty-seven and
twenty-eight standing passengers and
that cars from Cherrydale, Va., carried
as high as thirty and thirty-seven
standing passengers. As practically
all of the company's line is in Virginia,
the local commission will be unable to
9 ^accomplish but little in the way of
improving conditions without the aid
a of the Virginia authorities.
BOND TRADING TODAY
IS MORE DIVERSIFIED
Number of Substantial Advances Despite
Decline in Business
Volume.
NEW YORK. December S. ? Such
changes as occurred at the opening of
today's bond market were again limited
to mere fractions. Atchison convertibles
of 1317, Rock Island debentures
and Chesapeake & Ohio convertible

Railway 5s fell Otherwise prices
were stationary.
In the early session there was marked
decline in volume of trading.
There were more than the usual number
of substantial advances, however,
and business was more diversified.
Rock Islands were Irregular, the debenture
5s making a further gain, with
some heaviness in refunding 4s. Bethlehem

RULES ON CLAIMS
IN BUILDING CONTRACTS
Appellate Court Reverses Supreme
Court Finding1 in Hazen-Latimer
Company Case.
A subcontractor may not enforce &
claim against the owner of the property
or against the surety of an absconding
contractor with whom the
owner had settled in fun before that
contractor's departure when the surety
company completes the building, according
to an opinion of the District
Court of Appeals yesterday rendered
by Mr. Justice Van Orsdel. The appellate
court reverses the finding of the
District Supreme Court in awarding a
lien of $1,016 in favor of the Hazen
Latimer Company against Mahlon A.
Winter and George W. Paris, owners,
and the Fidelity and Deposit Company
of Maryland, surety of a missing contractor.
"Upon the abandonment of the contract,"'
says the court, "the surety *'as
called upon by the owner not to make
good any loss sustained by the failure
of the contractor, but to step in and
protest the completion of the building
under the contract. When the surety
elected to assume the completion of
the work, as it had the right to do, it
did not assume anything back of the
first payment. For its own protection
and not because of any fictitious relation
to the contractor- it assumed to
take the work where the contractor
left it on the owner's hands, and to
complete it- as it had assured the own- |
er it would be completed by the con- i
tractor.
Has Right of Protection.
"The owner is entitled to equal protection
with the subcontractor. The
subcontractor should acquaint himself
with the terms and conditions of thp
building contract. In the absence of
anything to the contrary, we must assume
that plaintiff possessed this information.
If it knew when the next
payment would be made to the contractor
after it completed the work it
must be presumed to know the condition
of the statute which expressly
gave it a lien only against money owing
the principal contractor at the time
of notice of its claim to the owner.
It could have given the owner notice
the day it completed the work. It cannot
shift its neglect onto the shoulders
of either the owner or the surety.
In conclusion the court points out
that its construction in the absence of
fraud or collusion, can work no hardship
upon the subcontractors or material
men. but only imposes promptness
in asserting their claims. If the
plaintiff's contention were sustained
the court suggests, great hardship
might be experienced by both owner
and surety.

SUFFRAGE FOR DISTRICT,
THEME OF BUSINESS MEN (
Chamber of Commerce Members Will
Take Up Ballot and Representa- t
tlon in Congress. r
Members of the Chamber of Commerce
are anticipating a meeting tonight
that long will be remembered In
the organization. This is due to the
fact that the chief topic to be considered
Is a report dealing with suffrage
In the District of Columbia.
At its meeting two mont' * ago the
chamber went on record in favor of
suffrage In the District without specifying
Just what kind of suffrage is
wanted. Tonight an attempt will be
made to reach this decision, when a
special committee, of which Albert c
Schulteis is chairman, will submit a c
report favoring an amendment to the r
Constitution that will provide repre- e
sentation for the District in the House
and Senate and the electoral college
and will ask the indorsement of the,
chamber. T
Another matter of interest that is ^
scheduled to be considered is a report r
of the committee on law and legislation
embodying a recommendation for S
a more stringent law governing the a
sale of deadly and dangerous weapons r
in the District of Columbia. An amend- 3
ment to a section of the code of law
for the District of Columbia govern- j
ing the sale of dangerous weapons is
recommended by the committee, which g
believes that a weapon of this char- ^
acter should not be sold, bartered or
exchanged unless the person desiring
to obtain it first has obtained a per- 1
mit from the chief of police.
A report of a special committee of
which Charles W. Clagett is chairman d
on the alleged unfairness of the present
methods of assessing benefits for
street and alley improvements also is
scheduled to be received. P
COMPLETE REPRESENTATION. \
The Larger Manifestation of District
Suffrage Desirable. 4
To the Editor of The Star:
I hope the Chamber of Commerce will s
adopt the report of the special committee
in favor of full representation for
the District of Columbia in both _
branches of Congress and in the electoral
college.
As,chairman of the District Delegate
Association for several years, and during
my arguments and pleas for representation
for the District of Columbia _
in Congress by a delegate, the convic- a
tion has grown upon me that we were *
justified in asking for more than dele- r
gate representation. B
While the District Delegate Assocla- *
tion believed that a delegate in the c
House would be a decided advantage ?
wvci cut; preoeni aysiem, ana nave Deen d
working for it for that reason, and be- J?
cause especially it would be a means to 11
the end of securing more complete rep- J?
resentatlon, at the same time, if this p
latter can be obtained by the same p
efforts that would be required to se- n
cure a delegate, then we should stop N
at nothing short of that. *>
I earnestly urge that all advocates ?
of a delegate for the District indorse J,(
and work for the larger program of p,
more complete representation. All the St
advantages of the delegate system s*
would be realized and many additional S.
ones. It will, of course, require a longer
time to secure full representation,
involving, as it seems to, a constitutional
amendment, while a delegate
could be granted by a single act of
Congress. Nevertheless, the same issues
would be raised by Congress in
granting a delegate, and the matter
might as well be settled in favor of ^
full representation while the question
is agitated.
Every citizen of this community ^
should now earnestly co-operate, in my
opinion, for the plan as mapped out by
[ the special committee of the Chamber ^
I of Commerce, which calls for our right
j to vote for our own representatives in
the House and Senate, as well as to N
.vote for President and Vice President
j of the United States.
I Those who desire a more radical program
should be satisfied to secure this 1
j first. If, later, the people of the District
should wish a more extended form
of local government, then we would
I be in a better position to obtain it. But, F
I if that involves the abolition of the
present half-and-half plan, then I do
not believe Washington would go so N
far, for Congress will never vote away
its prerogative of exercising exclusive
jurisdiction over the National Capital, T
and for obvious reasons it should not

OBJECTS TO SURRENDER
OF JOHNSON & CO. LEASE
G
Insurance Company, Ownen of
Banking Premises, Questions
Power of Receivers. L
Objection to the request of the rej
ceivers of the bankrupt Arm of Lewis
Johnson & Co., to be allowed to sur- F
render possession of the first floor of
premises 1505 Pennsylvania avenue
was made late yesterday afternoon by
Attorneys Brandenburg & Brandenburg,
as counsel for the Arlington Fire
Insurance Company, owner of the
premises. The court is advised in the C
petition that the insurance company c<
leased the property to the brokerage tv
firm December 5, 1911, for a term of tl
five years at an annual rental of $6,500. la
When the firm failed it was in arrears, oi
it is stated, to the extent of $1,083.32. V
The landlord objects to the surrender
of the lease and declares the receivers y<
are without power to give up the o
premises. The unexpired term of the C
lease and the rental due thereunder are pi
declared to be a substantial claim w
against the bankrupt firm. tl
The receivers a few days ago asked
permission of the court to remove the q
business to a place which could be P
rented for about $60 per month. ta
Justice McCoy has issued a rule m
against the receivers to show cause f?
Friday why they should not surrender N
certain promissory notes deposited for
collection by the wife of Robert B. j*
Howard. Mr. Howard has filed a peti- b
tion on behalf of his wife for the notes, tl
which he says were unindorsed. F

EFT MESSAGES TELLING
OF PLANS FOR SUICIDE
'olice Think William E. Coggswell
Jumped Overboard From a
Norfolk Steamer.
Several notes written by William E.
ogswell, twenty-seven years old, who
inducted a lunchroom at 1359 U street
orthwest, suggested to his father and
ie police that he committed suicide
ist night by Jumping overboard from
ne of the steamers of the Norfolk and
Washington Steamboat Company.
The first that was known of the
nung man's intentions was the finding
f a note by his father, William L.
ogswell, when the latter reached his
ace of business. 615 4% street south
est, from his home at Ballston, Va.,
lis morning.
Mr. Cogswell hurried to police headuarters
and reported his son's disapearance.
He said that the note con
Lined a statement that his eon had
lade a failure of life and that he was '
oing to end all by jumping from a
orfolk steamer.
Steamboat officials communicated
ith their Norfolk office and learned
hat Cogswell disappeared from the
oat, probably about 8 o'clock, when
he steamer was passing a point near
'ort Washington, He paid for his
cket and stateroom before the steamr
left its wharf at the foot of 7th
treet.
Two notes, one addressed to young
ogswell's wife and the other to his
ither, were found in the stateroom
nd will be brought here on the boat's
eturn trip. The harbor police have
equested members of the crews of
oats to be on the alert on their trips
own the river, thinking Cogswell's
ody may be found floating or on the
hore.

URGES AN INQUIRY '
ON BRIBERY CHARGE
]
Senator Robinson Would Have
Investigation of Accusation
Reported From Mexico. i
When the Senate assembled today
Senator Robinson of Arkansas again
urged the adoption of his resolution
providing for an investigation of a report
originating in Mexico and published
here to the effect that the Carranza
government of Mexico had paid
$75,000 to two senators of the United
States to use their Influence to bring
about the withdrawal of the United
States troops from Vera Cruz. He
said that he Intended to move that the
resolution be amended so that the investigation
be made by the Senate
lobby committee. Instead of the foreign
relations committee, as originally proposed,
because Senator Stone, chairman
of the latter committee, had stated
his committee had much important r
work before It.
Senator Smoot of Utah said that he J
had hoped Senator Robinson would with- 2
draw the resolution, Since he believed
that the Senate should not dignify such
reports by paying: any attention to them.
Before action could be taken upon the
resolution the Senate took a recess so
as to go to the House to hear President
Wilson deliver his message to Congress.
STOCK EXCHANGE OPENS
SATURDAY FOR TRADING
Committee to Allow Restricted Dealing
In Shares for Cash Above
Minimum Prices.
NEW YORK, December 8.?Dealings
In stocks on the New York Stock Exchange,
which came to an abrupt halt
at the close of business July 30 last,
because of the disturbed financial condition
abroad, dre to be resumed under
certain restrictions next Saturday.
The governing body of the exchange
has empowered the special committee
of five, which has exercised full supervision
over stock dealings during the
period of enforced closure, to take such
action, at the same time defining the
cnm mittPA'n nnwera tinder th?> lawn of
the exchange. The list of stocks which r
may be bought and sold under the new ?
regulations included nearly 200 issues a
out of a total of the 565 listed on the
exchange. No restrictions will be lm- J
posed on shares selling at or under t
$15. A number of active, if unimportant,
stocks come within this figure, ^
as well as numerous industrials. T
The restricted list embraces many of t
the better known industrials and vir- t
tually all the railway Issues which d
form no part of the so-called interna- t
tional group. Tt does not include t
United States Steel, Union Pacific, 1<
Southern Pacific, Canadian Pacific, Bal- P
timore and Ohio and New York Cen- ?
tral, all of which are extensively held q
abroad. Canadian Pacific and Baltimore
and Ohio were the most active
of American stocks in the Berlin market.
i,
The principal reason for the exclu- ^
sion of these stocks appeared to be g
based upon the belief that foreign a
owners and allied interests might pre- ?
cipitate a heavy selling movement if
opportunity afforded. j.
Trading in stocks, with the exception
of those under $15, is to be con- ^
ducted on the same basis as that which c
now applies to bonds, namely, strictly s
for cash and not under minimum
prices to be established by the com- t
mittee from time to time. s

:EDERAL RESERVE ACT !,
MAY SOON BE AMENDED
Jankers Consider That System Will
Be Changed to Admit Rediscount
of Securities.
I.S a Means to Enlarge Activities
and to Increase Business In
Normal Times.
BT I. A. FLEMING.
General opinion In financial circles
favors the probability of an amendnent
or amendments to the federal rejerve
act at the present session of Congress.
It is within the powers of the reserve
board to make a ruling that member
banks shall borrow onlv from their re- t
clonal reserve bank, but such a ruling
could not be made effective with the
present limitations on the discounting
powers of the reserve system without
Injury to bankers. Only strictly comnerclal
paper is acceptable.
But banks have many collateral loans
lecured by bonds and stocks that are
ictually more desirable than much of
he so-called strictly commercial paper
n that they are readily salable and
hat the loan is fully secured, frequenty
with large equity, whereas commercial
paper is not always as safe.
This class of business, barred because
t savored of Wall street, is currently
Lccepted by banks all over the country,
frequently the security is high-grade
nunicipal bonds or the stocks or bonds
)f some local enterprise or utility.
In our own city Capital Traction 5s are
yorth 105, Gas 5s 104 and many other
ocal issues well above par, but not
>ne of these is sufficiently good collatsral
back of a note for the latter
o be rediscounted. Similar conditions
night be cited in every city of size
ind many towns and villages.
If the reserve system is to make the
uling referred to, regarding borrowng
only from regionals, this class of
lecuritles must be made acceptable.
It looks as if the ruling might be exjected
as the only way in which the
jystem as constituted can be made to
employ the cash in vaults and to make
he cumulative dividends promised to
lubscribers to the capital stock.
As at present, although the system
s but yet a few weeks in operation.
?v .coci vcs co.1 ncu ana tne capital
itock locked up does not appear to be
Lvallable for general use, save in the
estricted way noted.
Bankers meet this problem every
lay. Asked for loan accommodations,
hey report loanable funds practically
>ut. "But," says the would-be borower,
"you can rediscount this note
n the reserve system, can't you?" "No,
lot this note," is the frequent answer.
'You do not require the proceeds for
itrictly commercial purposes."
It Is for the reasons named that some
>f the leading local bankers consider
hat amendments are sure to be underaken
at this session of Congress.
Then, too, it is considered that these
natters and probably others will have
o be undertaken in the way of amendnents
to make the system attractive to
he savings banks, state banks and
rust companies, that they may be inluced
to enter the system.
There must be amendments before
rust companies can avail themselves
o any extent of the rediscount privieges,
for the majority of these cor orations
will not make loans save on
ollateral security, stocks and bonds
ilways preferred because of their liluiditv?always
possible, at a price.
The Cotton Pool.
W. J. Flather, chairman of the Clearng
House Association, visited the local
anks this morning securing official
ignatures, and with seal of each bank
ttached, to the cotton pool amended
igreement. This document, differing in
10 essential point from the orginial,
>ears date November 30, 1914.
This doesn't look as if the cotton pool
ras off and the relief of bankers in
otton states left to Congress, as
tated in a morning paper.
It is within the probabilities that
he activities of the pool may be retrlcted.
but the local action indicates
hat It will be used to give whatever
elief work is to be done in this diection.
Entertained.

anks and trust companies, appearing

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM J
RULES UNDER DISCUSSION

Board Members.
Representatives of state banks and
trust companies were here today for a
conference with the federal reserve
board regarding: regulations to be Imposed
on such institutions entering the
reserve system.
Limitations to be put on real estate
loans by state banks formed one of
the princpal questions for discussion.

point today, although regulations for
the admission of such institutions have
been under consideration by it since
the opening of the reserve banks.
Those who had been invited to attend
the conference included, representing
trust companis: U. H. McCarter, Newark,
N. J.; J. W. Platten. New York;

Following the meeting, the board was
to confer with the governors of the
twelve reserve banks rlative to clearing
house operations by these banks
and other Important questions.
GRAIN AND PROVISIONS.
CHICAGO.
CHICAGO, III., December fl.?-Wheat
sagged today, influenced by lower
prices at Liverpool. Besides, export
demand appeared to lack urgency for
the time being, primary receipts were
abnormally heavy and additional needed
rain had fallen in the domestic winter
crop belt. Leading firms were conspicuous
on the selling side. Opening
prices, which ranged from the same as
last night to % to % lower, were followed
by a decline all round and then
a moderate rally.
Wet weather that threatened to diminish
the movement from first hands
had a strengthening effect on corn.
The heaviness of the wheat market,
however, tended to make the bull side
cautious. After opening at a shade
off to a like advance, the market held
within % either way from last night's
figures.
Oats took the same course as corn.
Trade was extremely slow.
Higher prices for hogs gave a lift
to provisions. Shorts were the chief
buyers.
