Jjft jT T HEN President Wilson re
?1 /I f cently accepted the invita
V JV tion of the league 'of *ta
r tiotaa to mediate betweei
Armaria and the Turkish nationalist]
he pat the United 'States" onoe nrbri
on record as a factor in .brlngini
about peace between nations at war
, or involved in controversies threat
enlng war. The diplomatic history o
this country affords not a few in.
stances where the United States
through ila chief executive, has inter
vened in the interests of peace be
tween other nations. While Presiden
Wilson has made It clear in acceptint
the invitation to act as mediator thai
he was without authority to throw thi
weight of American arms into en.
foreement of the terms that migh^h<
settled upon, nevertheless it is impos
sible for him to disassociate himsell
xi uui mo uigii uuicc which tie noma in
undertaking to act as mediator. It
was not" as ans individual that thi
league sought his aid In mediation
but as the head of a great' nation
whose word would have weight.
Mediation, to be exact, is an act oi
4 intervention, and in the case of strife
between two nations the intervention
of a third. In that it is more than
arbitration, though mediation may lead
j to arbitration. But the. right of a
third nation to intervene and to off?
its good .offices to settle strife or disputes
between two nations has long
been recognised in International law.
When mediation is mentioned in thii
country, the mind immediately reverti
to Theodore Roosevelt and Grove*
a Cleveland. The action of President
Roooevelt in intervening in the RussianJapanese
war to offer his good offices tc
bring about peace between those nations
was closely akin to mediation. 11
not the very act itself. President Cleveland
goes down in history as the mediator
between Great Britain or rather
N British Guiana and -Venescela.
Veaesselaa Boundary Dispute.
Thn' controversy between Great Britain
and Venezuela was over the boundary
line betweeft Britlah,: Guiana and Venezuela.
'T'or .nearly half a century this
controversy had been unsettled. The
.. situation was bqcomingr more' and more
A serious.' The CnUeifc fctafea government
t- had for many years urged arbitration
of the question involved. A large ter
ritory between the' ]?sse<guibe and
Orinoco rivsra was in -dispute. The
British fovsfnsof^it/lhMn time to time
if gathered in another giice of this terriVs
tory which was Claimed by Venezuela
v The latter country had been unable to
get Great Britain to agree to any dividing
line between Its colony and Venesuela.
Nor would Great Britain ascent
arbitration urged by Venezuela and the
United States. Finally, Venezuela
broke off diplomatic relations with her
powerfufopponent.
t Great Britain had occupied a point on
the Orinoco river that allowed her to
dominate the vast" country drained by
r that river.. PresltKfW Cleveland realized
^hat the Monroe doctrine' was threat*
ened, under which the United States declines
to permit aggression by foreign
nstions in the western hemisphere. In
bi? annual message to Congress/in ISM
he directed attention to the unsatisfactory
situation that existed, i He announced
his intention of again seeking
to taring about arbitration of the dis.
pute between the two nations. Congress
promptly adopted a resolution
backing him up. Under ins true tides
from President Cleveland, Secretary
Olney of the State Department and
United States Ambassador Bayard undertook
to insist that Great Britalx

With the advice and assistance of

United States, a co-operating group
of scientific Investigators of insect
pests and plant diseases, together
with representatives of leading industrial
concerns engaged in the manufacture

name of the Crop Protection Institute.
This Institute intends, it is announced.
to make a thorough scien

the materials and appliances used in
fighting them.
The board of trustees of the institute

. agree. Moreover, they maintained that
- the Monroe doctrine, while held-in re{

?- Instance, since British Guiana- already
f existed in South America and could, not
, be considered a foreign power.
President' Cleveland's Protest.
A year after his first message to Congress
regarding the dispute between
Great Britain and Venesuela President
Cleveland sent his how famous-message
t to that body, which caused tremendous
excitement in England and inAfeis cou'nt
try, and which, it was predicted, would
, lead to war. In^it President Cleveland,
* declared that the maintenance of the
s Monroe doctrine "is important to our
peace and safety as a nation, and is
[ essential to the integrity of our free in,
stitutions and the tranquil maintenance
t of our distinctive form of government
, It was intended to apply.": he continued,
"to every stage of our national life
and cannot become obsolete white oar
republic endures."
; He pointed out that Great Britain had
refused to accept arbitration and there
was nothing left to do but accept the
situation and deal with It the best way
possiblec He recommended that a commission
be appointed to' investigate and
determine, the true boundary, line, and
after the report of the commission was
made it would, be the duty, of the United
States to resist by every means in its
power the seizure of lands which the
commission had determined, belonged to
Venezuela.
Congress immediately put through
a resolution provMliigfor' the proposed
commission, and appropriated
$104,000 for its expenses. From
the tone of the British newspapers,
it looked as If war would follow. But
the British government continued
diplomatic negotiations, and finally
it bras agreed that the. territory in
question should be submitted to arbitration.
A treaty was agreed upon
for that purpose between Great Britain
and Venezuela. and the arbitration
was concluded in 1890, fixing a
compromise boundary line.

ALONG stride forward is
about to be taken by those
responsible for .and interested
in social service work

For some, time there has been
developing an appreciation on the
part of those actively engaged in
social work that, although a great
majority of the individual agencies
were doing a splendid <work, the
cbllective effort fell somewhat
short of full efficiency. Both the
agencies themselves and' the general
public have been conscious of
the fact that duplication and overlapping
of effort have existed; that
frorjj time to time certain uncared-for
social heeds have presented
themselves which seemed to
lie outside the jurisdiction of any
existing agency; that co-operative
effort was lacking; that the flnan- .
cial appeals of the several agencies
were somewhat ihco-ordlnated
and, jn a word, that the separate
efforts of the various agencies?all
striving for the same general goal
?lost driving force, owing to the

Met M Dlseass Problem.
Out of the dissatisfaction arising*
from the consciousness of this state
of affairs sprang the idea of
creating some type of federation
of the social agencies-of Washing,
ton. A number of the larger
agencies met together to discuss
the problem. A committee was appointed
by those present tp develop
plans for functional federation.
And, after a period of careful
consideration, the 'proposals of
that committee have matured, and
a constitution has been drafted,
and .in ' the Immediate future a
number of. Washington social
agencies are 'to be invited to Join,
as charter member, in the formtfh
of the Washington Council of
Social Agencies.

a federation is happily obvious.

I, N. spite of a considerable urge tc
. extend.the term 'of the Presideni
and to make him Ineligible foi
re-election, it la now pretty well
assured that no such action wlll.be
taken by this or the newly ejected
Sixty-seventh Congrbss. .There are
! today In Congress some of. the, motl
careful students of the Constltutior
in .the entire country, and they have
been considering for several month!
the proposal in the light of. practical
politics and of the record of. the present
fixed four-year teYm. Amonj
there is 'Representative S. D. Fess 01
unio, who was the campaign manage!
who put the republicans in control oi
the Sixty-sixth Congress, and again
returned them with- unprecedented
majority - in the Sixty-seventh Con'
gress. - j
These authorities unite In the opinion
that the four-year term has well
met the consideration which persuaded,
the trainers of -the Constitution
to fix a quadrennial election, and
that these, considerations still persist.
The argument over the tenurt
of the executive ranged, from annua
electleiv to li^e, .or during good behavior..
^
The two extremes empjmsised. th<
two schopls (1), that whicji feared to<
strong, an executive . aqd, (1) tha
which feared too 'weak an. executive
The .first school demanded, protectioi
of the people from the dangers whlcl
the colonies had - recently escaped
This guarantee ~wu to be lodged ii
short terms necessitating easy recall
The' second school' demanded pro tec
tion from anarchy, which might re
suit from lade'of vigorous aad^eso
lute -government in the maintenane*
of lav and-order.
Arguments Before the Cssreatt?,

In the conv^ttion the discussion dis
played-two leading lines ofireasonlng
Should it be seven years excluding re
election or a less period with the v?:
open for re-election? The argumen
against exclusion "of the right to re

These considerations overcame th
contention for the denial of the priv

too long. Four, being the average be
