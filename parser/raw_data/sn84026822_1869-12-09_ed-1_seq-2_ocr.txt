THE MESSAGE.
Fl US T ANNUAL COMMUNICATION OF PRESIDENT
GRANT TO OONGBBB8.
"Blessed with peace at homo,"and "with
out entangling alliances abroad," tho Presi
dent congratulates Congress on the abundant
crops, tho grand natural resources of the
country, and upon tho general prosperity.
Seven Slates which passed ordinances of
Secession, have been fully restored to their
places in the Union. The eighth, (Geor
gia) after going through some of tho forms,
proceeded "in violation c f the constitution
they had Juft ratified, ns since decided by
the Supreme Court of the State," to unseat
the colored members of the Legislature, and
admit others, disqualified by tho 14th
Amendment. The President suggests a
law authorizing tho Governor of Georgia
convene the original Legisla
ture, requiring each member to take
the oath prescribed by the reconstruction
, und none to bo admitted who are ineli
gible under the 14th amendment.
