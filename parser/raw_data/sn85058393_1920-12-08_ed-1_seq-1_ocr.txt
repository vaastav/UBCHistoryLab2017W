GENEVA. Dec 8. (By the Associ
ated Press) Plans proposed for the
formation of the technical organiza
tions of the league of nations particu
lar!:, health and transportation, were
sharply attacked at today's session of
tho assembly by Newton Wesley Ro-
jwell. former president of the Canadian
' privy council.
These plans, the Canadian contend
ed tended ;o take such organizations
out of the hands of the assembly,
; which should control them, and throw
them under the Influence of Europe
through the impossihlllty of the nou
Ktiropean nations sending their best
men to three or four conferences an-
1 nually.
WHAT 1 AN IDA PAID
"Fifty thousand Canadian soldiers

Canads has paid for the European
. statesmanship which drenched the

the Canadian delegate concluded, but
ho was warmlj applauded from all
the other benches.
si OPENS DEBATE
Debate on the subject had been
opened by L'ir. l-'ridtjof Nansen, of
I Norway, It was based on the report
I of the committee on technical organi
sations. Dr. Nansen insisted upon the
in esslty of cooperation In these or-
ganizations hy countries not members
(of the league. He called attention to
the participation of non-members in
previous financial conferences and
other consultations, and pointed to the
substantial aid they had given in the
work of repatriating prisoners of war
Il was expected the discussion of
the scope and powers of the military
naval and aerial commission might de
ivelop what connection it may have
With the league's international force
that Is being sent to supervise the
plebiscite In Lithuania.
( ONFLICT POSSIBLE
On one occasion, Lord Robert Cecil,
delegate for South Africa, referred to
this commission as a "staff." This
appellation, however, was distasteful
io manv delegates who do not care
to encourage the idea of the militar
isation of the league.
The possibility of conflict between
the league and the various powers lias
o risen as a result of the decision of
the committee on admission of new
iit!itii! ivsmvt Ine Alhania and it is
likely to be discussed on the floor ofi
the assembly when that commit tee's J
r i port Is considered. Lord Robert Ce
cil has Insisted stoutly that Albania
should I" admitted t'p tin league. Ken,
Vivian 1, of France, and Slgnor Pagll-i
ano of Italv, have opposed this step!
on the ground that Albania has not
been recognized by any power and thai;
admission at thlO time might Interfere
with national policies of sonic Govern
ments They were able to secure post
ponement of Albania's application, but
Lord Robert reserved the right to dis
cussion on the floor of the assembly.
