THE recent Maryland census will
bring an increase of seven
members of the new House of
Delegates. The counties in
ch gams in population give the gains
in representational Annapolis are; Anne
Arumlle, Charles, Kent, Prince Georges,
Montgomery, St. Mary’s and Washing
ton each gain one member. No county
suffers a loss in its representation, al
though there is a decrease in the popu
lation of several of the counties.
The present House ol Delegates con
sists o( 91 members, 46 being a constitu
tional majority. The next House will
have 98 members, with 50 votes necces
sary to pass a hill. On joint ballot there
will be 124 members of the legislature.
Of the seven new members six will come
from counties generally considered Re
publican. Representation in both Re
publican and Democratic state and con.
gressional conventions will he based
also upon the new census returns, and
will be identical with that of the legisla
tive representation of the several count
ties.
FATHER ANDSONONTHE FARM.
WHETHER farm life is agree
able or not to a hoy depends
to a very great extent on
the relation between him
and the other members oi the family.
If the son and father enjoy each other's
company, they will have entire confi
dence in eacli oilier, and the boy will
most likely grow up with a good, broad
view ol life, drawn from the greater ex
perience ol his father. This is largely
the case with the relation between bro
ther and sister, hut it is not so important.
As a people, we Americans are not in
the least danger of being too polite, and
the earlier we begin the better for us.
But when the father and son do not un
stand and indeed know each other's
opinions and pleasures, then is when we
may expect sorrow sooner or later. In
truth, it is surprising how very few
farmers take any interest in their sons’
interests and pleasure, except to discour
age them, and how very few ever take
the time to teach them to work easily
and well.
Some boys are interested in plants,
others in birds and insects, and if they
are encouraged just a very little, the
pleasure they derive from these tilings
will make their whole life bright, not to
mention the training in neatness and
accuracy they get by so doing. There
are too many things done on the farm to
keep the hoys from getting spoiled, just
as though they were colts. They dare
not watch the plumber or lightning rod
man for fear they might get lazy, when
they would be only too glad to make up
all the time lost.
Notice, if you please, the way the
farmer hoys make room for themselves
in the cities, and how they are appre
ciated by the men ol influence. These
men quickly recognize the kind of stuff
the boys are made of. Can any one tell
me why these same boys are never ap
preciated in the country? —Clayton IT.

PRESIDENT MCKINLEY’S MES
SAGE TO CONGRESS.
THE Fifty Sixth Congress assem
bled in Washington on Monday
for the work of the short session.
The annual message of Presi
dent McKinley was sent to Senate and
House.
The following is an abstract of the
message:—
THU CHINESE I'IIOBLEM,
The message opens with a brief survey of
the growing strength and Increasing power
for good of republican Institutions and
American liberty at the outgoing of the old
and the incoming of the new century. The
Chinese problem is made the dominant qucs
tion in our foreign Intercourse, and an ela
borate review is made of iho details of mili
tary operations and diplomatic steps taken
in the progress of the settlement up to the
present time, and which have been made
known to the public by olllcdul announce
ments in tile past. The circular note to the
Powers of July 3 Is cited and reaffirmed, and
the opinion 1s expressed that conditions givo
hope of a complete settlement of all ques
tions involved. The seeureraont of an ade
quate guarantee for liberty of faith Is put for
ward as one of the essential factors of a dur
able adjustment. "Since insecurity of those
natives who may embrace alien creeds is a
scarcely less effectual assault upon the rights
of foreign worship and teaching than would
bo the direct invasion thereof.’ 1
NICAIIAQUAN CANAL.
Itegarding the Nicaraguan Canal the infor
mation is given that the Nicaraguan Govern
ment shows a disposition to take measures to
promote the water way, after having declared
the so-styled Eyre-Cragln option void. The
report of the Commission, it is recommended,
may he awaited. The convention with Great
Britain to remove any objections which might
arise out of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty to the
construction of the canal is commended to
the early attention of the Senate.
FINANCES Of THE GOVERNMENT.
The llnancial operations by the Govern
ment during the year arc reviewed in detail.
"It will bo the duly, as 1 am sure it will be
the disposition of Congress,’’ says the Presi
dent, "to provide whatever further legislation
is needed to iusurc the continued parity under
all conditions between our (wo forms of
metallic money, silver and gold." Touching
the disposition of the surplus the President
recommends a reduction of internal revenue
war taxes in the sum of $30,000,000. "This
reduction should be secured by the remission
of those taxes which experience has shown
to be the most burdensome to the industries
of the people." "The inclusion in the reduc
tion is specially urged of the legacy tax be
quests for public uses of a literary, educa
tional or charitable character.
Smi'i'lNTi bill unhoused.
Immediate action is urged on measures to
promote American shipping and foreign
trade, and it is said "the remarkable growth
of our steel industries, the progress of ship
building for the domestic trade and our
steadily maintained expenditures for the
navy nave created an opportunity to place
the United States in the llrst rank of com
mercial maritime powers.’’
ABOUT TIIUSTS.
The President calls attention to the passage
In his last annual message for early action to
remedy such evils as might be found to exist
in connection with combinations of capital
organized into trusts, and he repeats the lan
guage of the previous message, adding; "Re
straint upon such combinations as arc injur
ious, and which are within Federal jurisdic
tion, should be promptly applied by the Con
gress."
mi; rniLiiTiNEs,
Tins treatment of the Philippine question
consists largely of a review of events and
acts there during the past year, recalling the
President's determination to await the de
cision of the will of Congress as to the es
tablishment of a form of government. lie
reports favorable progress towards pacifica
tion and the iatitutlon of local government.
Instructions to the Commission arc embodied
in lull, and the preliminary report, which has
already been published, is cited as to the im
provements following the arrival of tin- Com
mission in Manila. Later report* from the
Commission ace said to show yet more en
couraging advance towards good govern
ment in the interests u( humanity, and witli
the aim of building up an enduring, self-sup
porting and self-administering community.
Legislation Should be along these generous
lines, in the unselfish discharge of an un
sought trust, which tile fortune of war has
thrown upon tho melon. Reiterating Ids
/le-lgniiU' n of the Filipinos ns "the wards of
the nation," the President say- "It is our
duty so to treat them that our Hag may be no
less beloved iu tliu mountains of Luzon and
tlic fertile zones of Mindanao and Negros
than it is at home; that there, ns here, it
shall lie the revered symbol of liberty, en
lightenment and progress iu every avenue of
development. The Filipinos arc a race quick
to learn and to prollt by knowledge. He
would bo rash who, with tho teachings of
contemporaneous history in view, would fix
a limltjto the degree of culture and advance
ment yet within the reach of these people it
our duty toward them bo faithfully per
formed."
11EOHOANIZINO THE AUJIV.
Increased needs of the army, by reason of
the new possessions, tho country’s const de
fences and new army posts, are pointed out,
and the necessity in the immediate future of
from 45,000 to 00,000 men iu the Philippines
is stated. "It must be apparent," says the
President, "that we will require an army ol
about 00,000, aud that during present condi
tions iu Cuba and the Philippines the Presi
dent should have authority to increase the
force to the present number of SIOO,OOO. In
cluded in this number authority should ho
given to raise native troops iu the Philippines
up lo 15,000, which the Taft Commission be
lieves will he more effective iu detecting and
suppressing guerrillas, assassins and la
drones than our own soldiers.”
NAVY TO BE STIIEN ITHENEO.
Recommendations of the Secretary of the
Navy for new vessels and for Increased force
are approved, and the establishment of a
national naval reserve ami of the grade of
Vice Admiral is recommended, aud also pro
vision for suitable rewards for special merit.
A IV.IUM.Mi AOAINST EVTUAVAUANeE.
Tile Message concludes ns follows: "In
our great prosperity we must guard against
tho danger it invites of extravagance iu
Government expenditures anil appropria
tions, and the chosen Representatives of tho
people will, I doubt not, furnish an example
in their legislation of that wise economy
which in a season of plenty husbands for the
future. Iu this era of great business activity
and opportunity caution Is not untimely. It
will not abate, hut strengthen oonlldenoe.
It will not letard, hut promote, legitimate
industrial and commercial expansion. Our
growing power brings with it temptations
and perils, requiring constant vigilance to
avoid. It must not lie used to Invite con
flicts, nor lor oppression, but for tho more
effective maintenance of those principles of
equality and justice upon which our institu
tions and happiness depend. Let us keep
always in mind that tho foundation of our
Government is liberty, its superstructure
peace."

Blood Humors
It doesn’t make any difference wheth
er you believe in the modern theory
and speak of the causes of diseases as
referable to germs, microbes or bacilli,
or whether you use the older and better
understood terms of "humors” and
“blood diseases” Hood’s Sarsapa
rilla cures them all.
It cures scrofula, salt rheum or
eczema, catarrh, rheumatism, malaria
and all other blood poisons; nervous
troubles, debility and that tired feeling.
This is not merely modern theory; it
is solid up-to-date fact.
“ Salt rheum on my hands so aevertr I had to
wear gloves most of the time, and could not
shut my thumb and finger together, was
cured by Hood’s Sarsaparilla.” Mus. A. O.
Spaulding, North Searsport, Me.
“My throe months old boy was cured of a
very had case of scrofula by Hood’s Sarsapa
rilla.” Wm. 11. Garner. West Earl, I’a.
