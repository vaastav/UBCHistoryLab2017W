The President's Message.
President's message rings with Americanism
and is characteristic of the man. who typifies the
true American citizen. In it is found all that fear
lessness of thought and action for which the
President of the United'States is noted. His ideas
are clear and he couches tbem in language that
ctnnot be misunderstood or falsely interpreted.
It is the proauct of great intellectuality and high
est purity of heart. With a knowledge of Koose
?elt. his life, his history, uoone will deny the sin
cerity of his utterances, his honesty of purpose,
and bis determination to execute faithfully his
pledges.
This message, his first, was awaited by the
people of the nation, iriespective of political
creeid, with eagerness. Statesmen of both parties
paid profound attention to its reading and were
deeply impressed with the great scholarship and
grand statesmanship, with which it was featured.
Possibly, not in several decades of the nation's
history has the reading of the President's mes
sage commanded such universiul attention of the
federal legislative bodies, and never a more' popu
lar reception. The journals of the country with
very few exceptions, are loud in their praises. All
who have read it are pleased and pronounce it an
encyclopaedia, worthy of the careful study of the
law makers of the land.
On the matter of capital and labor be does not
surrender himself to demagogical. as so often is
the case 'o prejudice the people and create strife,
but exercises a judicious conservatism aud sug
gests such regulations as will not weaken the
prosperity of the country, but on the other hand
will be a protection ot mutual benefit to both
classes. lie is pronounced on the matter of an
archy and proposes treasures congress will do
well to take up and make law.
On all party policies he is happily orthodox,
but not so radically pronounced as to put himself
under the ban of subserveince to party regularity.
He shows himself to be a republic to in the truest
sense and not muswumpship as designing partisan
d m lcratic press has bien bo diligently trying to
convince the people he would be.
The message is wholesoni" mid replete wiili
the spirit of Americanism, and lev is no shadow of
doubt as to the high character of administration
the chief executive will give in the futu-e.
Roosevelt On The "Trusts."
Tb'o President has spoken on the so called
??trusts," and suggests a certain remedy for ih?
baneful effects they may have on the i"dus'riil
conditions ot the country, provided they are alio*
od to run uncurbed. He has not taken no ihe
demagogic hue and cry against them that has been
so often set up agaitfst combinations of capital
but bandies the subject from the point of reason,
able objection to improper combinations whose
object nmy be to monopolize certain 'ines of indus
ry. In this particular he asks for regulations
which, upon theirface. seem wise ami not detri
mental to capital, but at the same lime beneficial
to labor. Over-capitalization inspites a lack of
confidence and may work th edestruction of the in
dustrial fabric of tbe country, and permit of an
illegitimate conduct of the business of a concern.
Toe President would regulate thin condition or at
least meet and prevent it by/publicity?"that is a
public knowledge of the working capital of tbe
concern and so much of its affairs as will Induce
confidence." He is also right In his claim that they
sbould be under national supervision, and. very
properly suggests that there be an amendment to
tbe constitution, if tbe subject be not now cdvored
by tbe constitution- Tbe claim has been advanced
'that they are itate creations and can only be look
ed after by the states. If this be true, no end of
mischief might result, and it would be well to have
tbe amendent he suggests, and in that event, tbe
proper thing to do, as he suggests, is the creation
of a new cabinet department, to look after the com
merce and industries of the country.
The president's message on this subject wi'l
inspire the confidence of both capital and Iab->r and
especially of all, who are honest in their eDdc iv r
to make a hving and develop tho.country. Ciuj
binations of capital can have no reasonable objec
tion to such a regulated conduct of tbeir concern
as will iuBure them proper returns on theL- inves ?
merits and reward for their e(T >rts. Oa tho uth? r
band tbe laboring mao, whose welfare i? Ur. in
dependent upon thesucce6s of capital, can not -
ject to such regulations as will be of advantage to
himself as well as tbe capitalist. There vili beno
upheaval along this line to startle the country ar,.i
throw the nation into the air of panic and distrut. ,
so long as the executive head of the government
treats the subject in this fashion and so long as
congress stays within.rational bounds 111 its act.ou
upon this subject.
No Tariff Tinkering.
The President wants no taritr tinkering and,
as claimed some months ago by the Telegram,
j there is not likely to be any, as tbe republicans in
congress are practically uni'ed aeaiost such a
procedure, beyond what may be absolutely nrces
sary as to tbe Philippine Islands owing to a recent
decision of tbe United Stat'es supreme court. whi.-Ii
declares the recent collection of duties in tbV p r
ticular unconstitutional. Like his illustrious
predecessor, President McKinley. Roosevelt ad
vances the ideaof reciprocity, when it will Lot inter
fere with the nutu-ingof of our home industries
.and when there will be 110 weakening of pr >
tection to American labor. botiieW the treaties
now pending, he b-ltev-^ would be de'rimer-nl to
our nation's com ner id ir ovt i mi.I iiuin ' i.ii
activity if ratified and uti does uut li M<a'e .? ow
gest in a respectful manner the neco-i y i f ?mrti
fying or rejecting - hem. Wh'le n siroriif c.h ? mi>i<>n
of protection, he ii i.<-r ?? ..\t cm i n?.- ?? .
ject and does not attempt to say ibat uur present
prosperity is due alone to the tariff. He does,
however, recognize its etficajy in the buildicg
up and progress of the nation, and does not wish
to see certain clauses and schedules tampered with,
as such* action would tend to throw the country
into a state of disquietude of mind and would in
spire a lack ot confidence throughout tbe buci'iess
and financial circles of the country. He recom
mends such reciprocity treaties as will widen and
strengthen our foreign trade, but not any such as
would leave us a defensless home martcet and
I bring degradation to the- labor of the oauntry.
Reciprocity along these lines will no douot prove
advantageous
His utterences upon the tariff and reciprocity
are a strong confirmation of his purpose to carry
out that memorable pledge he made to the nation
"to continue absolutely unbroken the policy of
President J/cKinley for the peace and'prosperity
and honor of our beloved country."
The President's message was given to the
news^ tp rs tu keep until it bad been read in cor
t?ra-s. Wore thev should publish. They all held
his cui'tideiiCH, and he did them a good turn, thus
saving th m de ay and inconvenience. The plan
was strictly original and furnishes a hippy preced
ent for others.
There are some, though they are believed to
be quite few, who will not hive thought much
about tbe message, until Bryan tells what he thinks
ot it and its meaning. Tneu they *411 tell you
wnai th-y think atmut it.
President Roosevelt very <ci<n. ly received
.-everal Uarisoncounty citizens toi-i w ek and re
marked that he had a very warm s jjt in his heart
for West Virginians. That feeling is reciprocal
and West Vireiniaus are just as proud of him as the
people of his own native state.
The Telegram desires to start ofT with the
new year with the business of the office brought
up to-date, and will appreciate the settlement- in
full of all subscription a year or more in arrearges.
THIRTEEN DOCTORS FAILED.
Mrs. M. A. Close, of Nebraska, Was Cured of
Incipient Consumption After All Medical
Aid Had Failed?Read Iler Letter.
MRS. M. A. CLOSE.
Kearney, Neb,, July 8,1900.
Dr. S. D. tlartman, ColumbuM, Ohio: ?
Dear Doctor-'-"I desire to express to you my sincere thanks tor the In
terest you have shown In my case, and for the timely aid and advice which
has effected a curs of as bad a case of consumption as could be weft Imagined.
44Peruna and Manalln have done what thirteen of the
be it physicians In the country have failed to do. For more
than three years / doctored for consumption, and spent
thirteen weeks In a Pulmonary Sanitarium at Milwaukee,
Wis.; but finding myself growing worse, as a last resort, 1
came West when / was bedfast for many weeks, and the
physicians which my husband called gave no hope but said,
?She cannot possibly live more than a few days.9 But
thanks to Peruna, f fooled them all. In an Incredibly short time after / began
to take Peruna the hemorrhages stopped. 1 began to mend slowly at first, but
the Improvement became more marked, and now / can truthfully say that
there Is not the slightest trace of my old complaint.
441 would have written you a long time ago, but have purposely waited to
, i'th? ef.'sct was lasting; rnd /;?conclusion I would say, God bless you and
keep you v.-lth us that you may go ai with your work of mercy fdr many years
tjc~uic."?rins. M. A. CLOSE.

FOUND
HERSELF
CROWING
WORSE.
AN OLD COLP
Is Catarrh, and Catarrh
to Consumption.
The tendency of catarrh of the
is to ptM downward through the
chial tube* to the lunge. Any one who
hu had catarrh of the head for a ye
more find* the disease gradually
greasing downward. Im eome oaae
progreee ia rapid, and ia other oaeeellie
slow; but sooner or lattv M oatarrh la
allowed to run, it will 90 fe the lunge
and set up the disease heown ae con
sumption. It is doubtful if eensumptio
is ever caused by anything except
tarrh.
The catarrh usually begins as a cold in
the head or throat, and is neglected until
it becomes chronic; then it begins to
dawn on the victim that he has cataxrhu
Unless he ip very foolish indeed he will
not rest easy until the catarrhis entirely
cured. Thousand* pay no,attention to
it until it is too late.
Mrs. J. Priest, Lee, Mich., writes"I
think there is no medicino on earth that
excel Is Peruna. My husband won't take
any other. We have tested it and it
worked a great change in my son'*
health last spring when we thought he
was going into consumption.' We gave
him only one bottle and he was all right.
I tell everybody about how much good
it has dono us. My husband says he
oan't do without it. As for myself, it
saved me seven years ago from going
blind. I could not see to read one word
for six weeks. I thought I should surely
lose my sight. I commenced taking Pe
runa and by the time I had taken one
bottle I could see to road as well as ever.
Wo think it is a grand medicine."?Mrs.
J. Priest.
Dm aa Much as Needed.
If Peruna is used a cold never be
comes chronic, and hence catarrh is pre
vented. But after i
catarrh has be
come thoroughly
established Peru
na will cure it,
but it will take
much longer.
Even in cases
where catarrh has
attacked the
lungs and the
pymptoms of con
sumption have
shown them
selves, the Peru
na will cure. A
great many cases
of genuine con
sumption h a v o
been cured with Peruna after the patient
had been given up to die, as in the case
of Mrs. Close.
If you do not derive prompt and aatle
factorv results from the use of Peruna,
write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a
full statement of your case and he will
be pleased to give you his valuable ad- .
vice gratis.
