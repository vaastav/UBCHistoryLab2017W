The Vandalia railroad has not yet changed
bands.
John C. Eobixson he, ia sorely "worrying
the Democracee.
THE President's message has given him a
oom in England.
THERE is fr opening in Louisville for a
Republican newspaper that will support Re
publican candidates.
The Danville speech of General Harrison
touched the Harrison-Coy-Sullivan Democ
racy on the raw. Their organ, the Sentinel,
squeals like a stuck pig.
"WITH Colonel Lamar on the Supreme Bench
the country may look for a revival of the long
dormant doctrines of John C. Calhoun in con
atltutional construction.
John C. Calhoun's body lies moldering
In the ground, but his soul is marching on in
the person of Lucius Quintius Cartus Lamar,
his disciple and eulogist.
No wonder the English press is delighted
with the President's message. From their
point of view it could not be better if it had
been prepared by the Cobden Club.'
Irish Americans will be sure to throw up
their hats for Cleveland when they read the
laudatory comments of the? British govern
xnent organs on his free-trade message.
Nobody denies that the President's free-
trade message shows courage. So did the
bull that essayed to throw a locomotive off
the track. Courage enough, but mighty
little discretion.
The President and Secretary Fairchild did
not consult before preparing their respective
messages to Congress. Mr. Fairchild evident
ly was not a member of the somewhat ceta
brated "Red Top conference."
The city election in Louisville seems to
have been characterized by every form of
corruption and fraud known to the worst
Echools of municipal politics. Too much
Democracy is bringing forth its natural fruit.
The citizens' committee of Louisville was
cot organized early enough. In order to
effect any reform in the corrupt political
methods of that city, proceedings shoald be
begun a year or so in advance of an elec
tion. - Up from the South at the break of day
there did not come a chorus of approval for
the President's free-trade message. On the
contrary, there is something of a rumble and
roar, relieved ,by occasional flashes of si
lence. The Democratic party is treading on dan
gerous ground. Free trade is not popular in
the South, and Cleveland, Carlisle, Watterson
& Co. may break that solid line of States
Which elected the last President unless they
etre very careful.
The Democracy have thrown down the
gauntlet and challenged the Republicans to
meet them on the free-trade issue. They
could not have selected a better line of battle
nor a plan of campaign more satisfactory to
the Republicans.
THE President ought to try and run over to
London for a few weeks next summer. His
f ree-tiade message has made him very popu
lar on the other side, and Englishmen would
give him an ovation. Perhaps that might
secure him the Irish vote.
A citizens' committee has been appointed
In Louisville to arrest and prosecute Demo
cratic bribers and illegal voters. . The organ
of the tally-sheet forgers in this city should
pen out on the committee. It is a great
outrage to interfere with Democratic cor
ruptionists. The members of Congress will do nothing
before January but reduce the surplus a little
by drawing their salaries and talk over the
tariff question. There is no use of the meet
ing of Congress in December, and the date
should be changed along with that of inaug
uration day.
In the matter of political corruption and
dishonest elections Louisville now stands in
line with Baltimore. This disgraceful condi
tion of things will not be remedied until de
cent Democrats meet with Republicans on the
non-partisan platform of municipal reform,
and rid the city of its rascals.
Mr. Lamar has succeeded better in obtain
ing recognition himself than he did in try
ing to obtain recognition for the Southern Con
federacy. His trip to Washington has proved
more successful than his trip to Europe was,
and a Democratic administration easier to
Work than foreign governments.
The report of Secretary Fairchild will not
receive great attention. There is little new
r important in it His arguments on the
lurplus and tariff reduction are substantially
what the President'd were, and hence appear
vs twice-told tales. He makes one individual
recommendation as to the surplus, however,
and that is, that it be placed in the banks of the
country, where it would be available for busi
ness. He says, "as this is the best use to
make of this money, I advise it." The Presi
dent says in his message, "the proposition to
deposit money held by the government in
banks throughout the country, for use by the
people, is, it seems to me, exceedingly objec
tionable in principle." Mr. Fairchild must be
gratified at this expression of confidence in
his financial ability by his chief. It is
another evidence of Democratic harmony on
the surplus, and what to do with it. The
principal portions of the Secretary's report
are printed this morning.
The President's message is generally received
for just what it is, an undisguised free-trade
document. The English people recognize it, and
the free-trade Democrats know it. Mr. Watter
son, rabid extremist, serves notice on the Ran
dall wing of the Democracy that it means fight,
and if they are not prepared to "homologate"
with the free-traders, they had better go into
the Republican party at once. He declares the
policy the President advocates "more radical"
than any the Democracy ever have avowed,
not ".excepting the "tariff for revenue only"
cry of 1SS0, and says the "President is
against protection pure and simple," and
that "the duty of the Democracy is to edu
cate the workingmen of the country, the
wage-workers, out of the idea that protection
protects them to any extent." Mr. Watterson
speaks plainly, and apparently with authority.
The Randallites understand the message the
same way. Mr. Randall say3 "the issue is
forced upon us." The New York Sun says
"the President treats the manufacturers of
the country as a class as though they were
public enemies and conspirators." The At
lanta Constitution says "it is a Bill Morrison
message, and that Morrison was left at home
by his constituents at the last election." And
so it goes. The President's attempted sugar
coating, his little disingenuous play upon
words, his masquerade, has failed of its pur
pose, and we have the issue of protection or
free trade clean and clear cut. It ia not
either the reduction of the surplus or the
revision of the tariff; it is whether the surplus
shall be absolutely and permanently destroyed
while ; great and needed public works are
demanding attention, and whether reform in
the tariff shall be made with an idea of
retaining the American system of protection,
or committed to those who believe, with
the President, that the system is "organized
robbery," and that there is no necessity of
throwing any kind of protection about either
our industries or our workingmen. On that
issue the Republicans will be glad to join
battle; but the fear is that the Democratic
party cannot be induced to follow the bugle
call of their impetuous would-be leader.
There are Democrats who remember the
adage that a certain type of people rush in
where angels fear to tread, and they have not
forgotten the lesson of 1880.
The Sentinel has not got over the last cam
paign, and frequently drools and drivels in
impotent wrath because of the "lies" of the
Republican party in that struggle, "as it
pleases to call them. Well, our esteemed
contemporary is in that condition where the
worm that troubles it dieth not. The last
campaign will be scarcely a marker to tha
next one. Every issue touched in that can
vass, and passed upon favorably to the Repub
lican claim by the people, remains unsettled,
and next year will be devoted to fighting the
old battle over, only with redoubled energy
and added ammunition. The same scandal
ous and corrupt management of the great
benevolent institutions of the State contin
ues. The board under which the infamies
laid bare in the canvass and in the last Legis
lature were perpetrated, and by their con
nivance and consent, still continue in charge,
and not a respectable, honest Democrat, in
good standing "with his party, has dared to
lift his voice against the gang that fed insane
patients with maggoty butter, cholera hogs,
and decayed fruits. The campaign of last
year will be repeated with increased emphasis
next year, and if our esteemed contemporary
is in distress now, it will be in torment before
next November. The Republican party does
not propose to leave the insane of the State
to the tender care of the Harrisons, the Sul
livans and the Coys of the Democratic party.
It will continue on "the sunlit hills of duty,"
remembering "the message of the Son of
God;" it will again declare for non-partisan,
honest, kindly, efficient care of the un
fortunate wards of the State, and we believe
the people will return a Legislature that will
see that humanity and decency triumph
over brutality, infamy and corruption. We
renew to our "esteemed contemporary the as
surance of our distinguished consideration,
and advise it to get in out of the wet. After
last year, the deluge.
AMONG the great number of hungry Indiana
Democrats there is one whose claims should
not be overlooked by the party. The person
referred to is George W. Buldock, of Jeffer
son ville. Mr. Buldock is .a Democrat "from
way back," and his claim for recognition is
one that will be instantly recognized as pecul
iarly meritorious. He claims to have elected
Mr. Turpie to the Senate. His claim rests on
a beautiful chain of cause and effect. He was
recently superintendent of the poor-farm in
Clark county, and in that capacity he voted
fifteen paupers for Dr. McClure, Democratic
candidate for the Legislature. Thesa fifteen
pauper votes elected McClure, and McClure's
vote gave the necessary majority in the rcmp J
convention for Turpie. But for those fifteen
votesi Republican would have been sent to the
Legislature and Turpie would not have been
where he is. This is the way Buldock elected
Turpie. He is now out of office, and of course
is hungry. Something handsome should be
done for Buldock, and we suggest that the
Democratic members from Indiana, headed
by Mr. Turpie, call on the President and urge
his appointment to some lucrative position.
Such action on the part of the President
would be a graceful compliment to Turpie,
and would somewhat mitigate the embarrass
ment of his present position. Perhaps no
other Senator, or alleged Senator of the
United States, ever owed his so-called elec
tion to the votes of fifteen paupe.s. The re
markable services of Mr. Buldock should be
rewarded. , The other paupers can wait.
There is to be a meeting of the Republican
clubs of the country in New York city on the
15th instant and it would seem that the club
organizations of the State of Indiana should
be fully and properly represented. So far, the
Journal has noticed the appointment of no
delegates except from the Huston Club, of this
city, a new and strong colored organiza
tion, and the Morton Club, of Fort Wayne.
The Lincoln League is already organized in
various parts of the State, and is to be in all
part3 before the winter is over. It will be the
part of wisdom to have the League repre
sented in the New York conference, where
important work looking to the future cam
paign may be laid out Indiana is one of the
important States next year. It is not improb
able that where Indiana Republicans sit will
be the head of the table; certain it is, that it
will be well up toward the front In this con
tingency, the Republicans of Indiana should
be fully represented at New York. If the
clubs of any town or city will communicate
with the Journal we can arrange needful ac-
commodations for' their representatives on the
railroads, which have made special rates for
the occasion.
Under the head of "Three Disappearances"
the New York Sun calls to mind the brief his
tory of Wm. R. Morrison, of Illinois; Albert
S. Willis, of Kentucky, and Wm. R. Cox, of
North Carolina. The Sun says: "These three
respectable and conspicuous Democrats were
defeated in their several districts, either in
caucus or at the polls, for no other reason than
that they represented impracticable tariff the
ories, extravagant, we will not say dishonest,
methods of expending the people's money, and
undemocratic notions concerning the offices."
The editorial was printed the morning Mr.
Cleveland's free-trade message was read to
Congress. The Sun will be heard from later.
Mr. Jacob, the newly elected Mayor may
be regarded as the Higgins of Louisville. It
is not known that he has received any certifi
cate of character from reformer Cleveland such
as that bestowed upon Fellows, of New York,
but there is no doubt that he is a "worker"
after the President's own heart, and that their
views in regard to the proper management of
municipal affairs coincide exactly. If there is
anything Mr. Jacob want3 of Mr. Cleveland,
he can have it for the asking. . ir :
The Journal devotes considerable space
this morning to personal and newspaper com
ment upon the President's message. These
comments are not selected from 'Republican
sources nor from those which have like opin
ions, but fairly represent the general drift of
comment from all points of view. The Jour
nal's news columns "rise above party" on all
occasions. The interests of the party the
paper believes in are attended to in the edi
torial columns.
The "rubber trust" has been organized, to
go into effect on the 1st of January.
Before the 1st of January, if possi
ble, a law should be passed by Congress
declaring this and all kindred combinations
illegal, and punishing them as conspiracies
against the people. This is.a great deal more
important than the postal telegraph scheme.
Who will be the man to stand for the people
as against the ''trusts?"
ClTY officials of Buffalo say that when Mr.
Cleveland formally gave up his residence in
that place, last year, he stated that he ex
pected never to return. He neglected, how
ever, to explain whether this resolve was
caused by a wish to escape unpleasant associ
ations or by his expectation of being re
elected President for the term of his natural
life.
For many years it was Professor Lamar,
then it was Colonel Lamar, and now it is like
ly to be J udge Lamar. It used to be thought
that a man should serve a pretty long appren
ticeship at the law before aspiring to the Su
preme Bench. Mr. Lamar qualified himself
by teaching mathematics and commanding a
regiment in the rebel army.
The appointment of Boss Dickinson, of
Michigan, as Postmaster-general removes the
last vestige of pretense of civil-service reform
in that department, and is notice to every
Democrat in the service to cut loose. From
this time on postmasters and postal clerks
may use all the offensive partisanship they
want to. Everything goes.
It has come at last The blowing up of a
Halifax photograph gallery with dynamite is a
proof that the victims of the camera will not
always suffer and make no sign. If this sort of
fate, however, is to be meted out to photogra
phers, what shall be done with the persons res
ponsible for newspaper portraits? Now that pub
lic indignation is visiting itself upon one class of
offenders, it is not likely that perpetrators of
the worse outrage will escape. Left to a vote of
the sufferers, it may be doubted if the dynamite
method of retribution would be regarded as
sufficiently severe. The Journal congratulates
itself at this crisis on not being a pictorial
paper.
New York detectives have just arrested a
confidence man who had "tolled" a ( ood Metho
dist elder all the way from Tennessee, for the
purpose of giving him $3,000 in "green goods'
in exchange for $500 in greenbacks. This be
gins to look like social progress. Methodist
brethren must be protected, and depraved
wretches who agree to sell them counterfeit
money and fail to do it ought to be arrested.
The coroner at Denver committed suicide tlie
other day. It is an unusual thing for one who
is often called upon tt look at men and women
who have killed themselves and been killed vio
lently, to take his own life and furnish a subject
for an inquest The formality should be waived
in his caso out of respect to the omce.

MR. BLAINE ON THE MESSAGE

And Improves the Opportunity to Give the
- World His Views as to tbe Most Desirable
Method of Reducing. the Revenues.
He Wonld Repeal the.Tobacco Tax: and
Use the Whisky Tax in Building Forts.
Views of Other Statesmen and Politicians on
thegMessagre It la Generally Regarded
as a Strong Free-Trade Manifesto.
Ne,v York, Dec. 7. The Tribune of to-morrow
will contain a long interview with Hon.
James G. Blaine on President Cleveland's mes
sage. It was taken in . short-band under the
direction of the Tribune's Paris correspondent,
and sent bv cable to-night. It is as follows:
"I have been reading an abstract of the Pres
ident's message, and bare been especially inter
ested in the comments of the London papers.
Those papers all assume to declare the message
is a free-trade manifesto, and evidently are an
ticipating an enlarged market for English fabrics
in the United States as a eonseqnence of the
President's recommendations. Perhaps that
fact stamped the character of the message more
clearly than any words of mine can." ,
"You don't mean actual free trade without
duty?" questioned the reporter.
'"No," replied Mr. Blaine; "nor do the London
papers mean that. They simply mean that the
President has recommended what in the United
States is known as a revenue tariff, rejecting
the protective feature as an object, and not
even permitting protection to result freely as an
incident to revenue do ties."
"I don't know that I quite comprehend that
last point," said the reporter.
"1 mean," said Mr. Blaine, "that for the first
time in the history of the L nited States tbe
President recommends retaining the internal
tax in order that the tana may be forced down
even below the fair revenue standard. He
recommends that the tax on tobacco be retained.
and thus that many millions annually shall be
levied on a domestic product which would far
better come from a tariff on foreign fabrics."
"Then do you mean to imply that you would
lavor tne repeal oE the tobacco taxi '
"Certainly, I mean just that," said Mr.
Blaine. "I should urge that it be done at once,
even before the Christmas holidays. It would,
in the first place, bring great relief to growers
of tobacco all over the country, and would
materially lessen the price of the article to con
sumers. Tobacco, to millions of men, is a
necessity. The President calls it a luxury,
but it is a luxury in no other sense than tea and
coffee are luxuries.. It is well to remember that
the luxury of yesterday becomes a necessity of
to-day. Watch, if you please, tbe number of
men at work on the farm, in the coal mine, along
the railroad, in the iron foundry, or in, any call
ing, and you will find 95 of 100 chewing while
they work. After each meal the same propor
tion seek the solace of a pipe or a cigar. These
men not only pay the millions of the tobacco
tax, but pay on every plug and every cigar an
enhanced price which the tax enables the manu
facturer and retailer to impose. The only ex
cuse for such a tax is the actual necessity under
which the government found itself during the
war and the years immediately following. To
retain the tax now in order to destroy the pro
tection which would Incidentally flow from rais
ing the same amount of money on foreign im
ports, is certainly a most extraordinary policy
for our government-"
"Well, then, Mr. Blaine, would you advise the
repeal of the whisky tax!"
"No, I would not. Other considerations than
those of financial administration are to be taken
into account with regard to whisky. There is a
moral side to it. To cheapen the price of whisky
is to increase tbe consumption enormously.
There would be no sense in urging the reform
wrought by high lieense in many States If the
national government neutralizes tbe good ef
fect Dy placing whisky within reach of every
one at twenty cents a gallon. Whisky would be
everywhere distilled if the surveillance of the
govern ment were withdrawn by the remission of
tke "tax, aid illicit sales could not then be pre
vented, even by a policy as rigorous and searching
as that with which Russia pursues tbe Nihilists.
It would destroy high license at once in all the
States. Whisky has done a vast deal of harm
in the United States. I would try to make it
do some good. I would use the tax to fortify
our cities on the seaboard. In view of the power
ful letter addressed to the Democratic party
on the subject of fortifications by tbe
late Mr. Samuel J. Tilden, in 1885, I am amazed
that no attention has been paid to the subject by
the Democratic administration. Never before
in the history of the world has any government
allowed great cities on tbe seaboard, like Phila
delphia, New Ycrk, Boston, Baltimore, New
Orleans and San Francisco, to remain defense
less." "But," said the reporter, "you don't think we
are to have war in any direction?'
"Certainly not," 6a"id Mr. Blaine: "neither, I
presume, did Mr. Tilden when he wrote his re
markable letter. But we should chance a re
mote chance into an absolute impossibility if
our weak and exposed points were strongly
fortified; if, to-day. we bad by any chance even
such a war as we bad with Mexico, our enemy
could procure ironclads in Europe that would
menace our great cities with destruction or lay
them under contribution."
"But would not our fortifying now possibly
look as if we expected war?''
"Why should it, any more than the fortifica
tions made seventy or eighty years ago by our
grandfathers, when they guarded themselves
against successful attack from the armaments
of that day? We don't necessarily expect a
burglar because we lock our doors at night, but
if by any possibility a burglar comes it contrib
utes vastly to our peace of mind and our sound
sleep to feel that he can't get in."
"But after the fortifications should be con
structed would you still continue tbe tax on
whiky"
"Yes," said Mr. Blaine. "So long as there is
whisky to tax 1 would tax it, and when the na
tional government should have no use for the
money I would divide the tax among the States
of the federal Union, with the specific object of
lightening the tax on real estate. The houses and
farms of the whole country pav too large a
proportion of the total taxes. If. ultimately,
relief could be given in that direction, it would,
in my judgment, be a wise and beneficent pol
icy. Some honest but misguided friends of
temperance have urged that the gov
ernment should, not use the money derived
from the tax on whisky. My reply is that the
tax on whisky by the federal government, with
its suppression ot all illieit distillation and con
sequent enhancement of price, has been a pow
erful agent in tbe temperance reform by putting
it beyond the reach of so manv. The amount of
whisky consumed in the United States per
capita to-day is not more than 40 per cent, of
that consumed thirty years ago."
After a few moments' silence Mr. Blaine
added that in his judgment the whisky tax
should be so modified as to permit all who use
pure alcohol in the arts or in mechanical pur
suits to have it free of tax. In all such ' cases
the tax could be remitted without danger of
fraud, just as now the tax on spirits exported
is remitted. .
"Besides your general and sweeping opposi
tion to the President's recommendation, have
you any further specific objections?"
"Yes," answered Mr. Blaine; "I should seri
ously object to the repeal of the duty on
wool. The repeal - would work great
injustice to many ' interests, and would
seriously discourage: what we should
earnestly encourage, namely, sheep culture
among farmers throughout the Union. To break
down wool-growing and. be dependent on for
eign countries for the. blanket under which we
sleep and the coat that covers our backs is not
a wise policy for the national government to en
force." "Do you think if the President's recommends
tion were adopted it would increase our export
trade?"
"Possibly in some few articles of peculiar
construction it might, but it would increase our
import trade ten-fold as much in the great
staple fabrics in wollen and eotton goods,
in steel, in all tbe thousand and
one shapes in which they are wrought How
are we to export staple fabrics to tbe markets of
Europe, and bow are we to manufacture them
cheaper than they do in Europe, unless we get
cheaper labor than they bave in Europe!'
"Then you think that the question of labor
underlies ibe whole subject?"
"Of course it does," replied Mr. Blaine, "it is,
in fact, the entire question. Whenever we can
force carpenters, masons, iron-workers, and
mechanics in every department to work as
cheaply and live as poorly in the United
States as similar workmen in Lurope, we can.
of course, manufacture just as cheaply as they
do in England and France.,' But I am totally
opposed to a j.oiiey that would entail such re
sults. To attempt it is equivalent to a social
and financial revolution, and that would bring
untold distress." -"Yes,
but might not the great farming class
be benefited by importing articles from Europe
instead of buying them at higher prices at
home?" - - .
"Tbe moment," answered Mr. Blaine, "you
beein to import freely from Europe you drive
your own workmen from mechanical and manu
facturing pursuits. In tbe same proportion
they become tillers of tbe soil, increasing stead
ily the agricultural product and decreasing
steadily the large homo demand which is con
stantly enlarging as home manufacturers en
large. That, of course, works great injury to
the farmer, glutting the market with his prod
ucts and tending constantly to lower prices."
"Yes. but the foreign demand for farm prod
ucts would be increased in like ratio, would it
not?" s
"Even suppose it were," said Mr. Blaine;
how, do you know the source from which it will
be supplied? The tendency in Russia to-day,
and in the Asiatic possessions of
England, is toward a large increase of the
grain supply, the grain being raised by tbe
cheapest possible labor. Manufacturing coun
tries will buy their breadstuffs where they can
get them cheapest, and the enlarging, of the
home market for the American farmer being
checked, he would search in vain for one of
the same value. His foreign sales are al
ready checked by the great competition
abroad. There never was a time when the
increase of a large home market was so
valuable to him. Tbe best proof is that tbe
farmers are prosperous in proportion to the
nearness of manufacturing centers, and a pro
tective tariff tends to spread manufactures. In
Ohio and Indiana, for example, though not
classed aslimanufacturing States, the annual
value of fabrics is larger than tbe annual value
of acricnltural products."
"But those holding the President's views," re
marked the reporter, "are always quoting the
great prosperity of the country under the tariff
of 1 840."
"That tariff did not involve the one de
structive point recommended by the President,
namely, the retaining of direct internal tax
es in oider to abolish indirect losses
levied on foreign fabrics. But tbe country had
peculiar advantages under it by tbe Crimean
war, involving England, France and Russia, and
largely impairing their trade. All these inci
dents, or accidents, if you choose, were im
mensely stimulating to trade in the United
States, regardless of the nature of our tariff.
But mark tbe end of this European experi
ence with the tariff of 1846, which,
for a time, gave an illusory and deceptive
show of prosperity. Its enactment was imme
diately followed by the Mexican war; then, in
1848. by the great convulsions of Europe; then,
in 1849, and succeeding years, by the enormous
gold yield in California. The powers made
peace in 1856, and at the same time the output
of gold in California fell off. Immediately the
financial panic of 1S57 case upon the country
with disastrous force. Though we had
in these years mined a vast amount
of gold in California, every bank in
New York was compelled to suspend specie
payment. Four hundred millions in gold bad
been carried out of tbe country in eight years to
pay for foreign goods that should bave been man
ufactured at home, and we bad years of depres
sion and distress in atonement for our folly. It
is remarkable that President Polk recommended
the tariff of 1S46 on precisely the same ground
that President Cleveland recommends a similar
enactment now, namely, the surplus in the
Treasury was menacing the prosperity of tbe
country. .History is repeating itself. By tbe
way," Mr. Blaine added, after a moment's re
. reflection, "it is worth notice that Mr. Polk in
sisted on emptying the Treasury by a free
trade tariff, and then immediately rushed
the country into debt bv borrow
ing $150,000,000 for the Mexican war.
I trust nothing may occur to repeat so disas
trous a sequel to the policy- recommended by
President Cleveland. But the uniform fate has
been for fifty years past that the Democratic
party, when it goes out of power, always leaves
an emyty Treasury and ' when it returns to
power always finds a full Treasury."
"Then, do you mean to imply that there
should be no reduction of the national rev
enue?"' '
"No; what I have said implies the reverse. I
would reduce it by a prompt repeal of the to
bacco tax, and would make, here and there,
some changes iu the tariff, not to reduce pro
tection, but to wisely foster it."
"Would you explain your meaning more
fully?"
"I mean," said Mr. Blaine, "that no great
system of revenue like our tariff can operate
with efficiency and equity unless tbe changes of
trade be closely watched and the law promptly
adapted to those changes. But I would make no
change that should impair the protective
character of tbe whole body of the tariff
laws. Four years ago, in the act of 1883,
we made changes of the character I bave tried
to indicate. If such changes were made, and
the fortifying of our seacoast undertaken at a
very moderate annual outlay, no surplus would
be found after that already accumulated bad
been disposed of. Tbe outlay of money on forti
fications, while doing a great service to the
country, would give good work to many men."
"But what about the existing surplus?"
"The abstract of the message I have seen,"
replied Mr. Blaine, "contains no reference to
that point. I, therefore, make no comment
further than to indorse Mr. Fred Grant's re
mark that a surplus is always easier to handle
than a deficit."
The reporter repeated the question whether
the President's recommendation would not, if
adopted, give us the advantage of a large in
crease in exports.
"I only repeat." answered Mr. Blaine, "that
it would vastly enlarge our imports, while the
only export it would seriously increase would be
our gold and silver. That would flow out boun
teously, just as it did under the tariff of
1S46. The President's recommendation, en
acted into law, would result, as did an
experiment in drainage of a man who wished
to turn a swamp into a productive field. He aug
a drain to a neighboring river, but it happened,
unfortunately, that the level of the river was
higher than tbe level of the swamp. The con
sequence need not be told. A parallel would be
found when the President's policy in attempting
to open a channel for an increase of exports
should simply succeed in making way for a
deluging inflow of fabrics to the destruction of
home industry." -
Opinion of Congressmen.
Collected from Washington and Other Specials.
Senator Call A very able document.
Senator Reagan I like and indorse it
Senator Eustis It is an admirable message,
and suits us.
Senator Teller It's a remarkable message
and very weak.
Senator Paddock (Rep.) It is a big card for
the Republicans.
Representative Mills said: "Good, elegant; it
could not be better."
Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania (Dam) Well,
he forces the issue upon us.
Representative Fuller, of Iowa, (Rep.) We
can stand such stuff as that.
Senator Spooner--It is a rehash of old stump
speeches, poorly put together.
Representative Cox (Dem.) Didn't hear it
all, but it is on the right lines.
Senator Blackburn If there's anything I don't
want to be quoted on, it's the message.
Representative McComas, of Maryland (Rep.)
It is the great error of the administration.
Re'presentative White, of Indiana (Rep.) A
rehash and a misstatement of figures and facts.
Senator Aldrich The President presents an
issue which the Republicans wilLbe very glad to
meet.
Mr. Reed, of Maine It has come like a great
blessing to us. Now we see what is in our
front.
Mr. Randolph Tucker It is evident that our
people will not relish the suggestions about tbe
tobacco tax.
Mr. Burrows, of Michigan It is the twaddle
gathered up from the weakest free-trade stomp
speeches he could find.
Senator Hiscock We can carry New York by
tbe biggest majority it was ever carried if they
will give us that platform.
Representative Bland said: "It's the best we
have ever had. I have not heard its equal since
I have been in Congress."
Senator Gray Strone. original, and charac
teristic of the man. Mr. Cleveland is the strong
est President since Jackson.
Representative Springer said: "That is a
good one. He hits tbe nail on the head every
time. We bave our platform."
Representative Hooker, of Mississippi (Dem. )
It ia strong, unique, and the grounds are well
taken. The party will indorse it.
Representative McKinley, of Ohio (Rep.)
The issue is made. It is free trade against pro
tection, and will give us strength.
Senator Manderson said: "It was a strong
message for free trade, but what a complete ig
noring there was of everything else."
Mr. Hiestand, of Pennsylvania On that plat
form Pennsylvania is nood for one hundred
thousand Republican majority next year.
Senator Allison If the President means free
trade and I take it that he does it will bo a
good enough document for the Republicans.
J. G. Cannon, of Illinois He only sees the
five millions gathered from wool, and there are
forty millions from sugar. Why, no one need
ask. s.
Senator Piatt said he didn't know whether he
wanted to express an opinion or not for publi
cation. If he did, it mifht not be compliment
ary. Senator Stanford I wasn't able to bear it
very well, but what I did hear of it struck me
as being something in the way of a free-trade
arenment.
Mr. McKinley: Speaking as a Republican, I
am glad the President has so clearly fixed upon
tbe attention or toe country wis great issue and I
has so surely committed his party to the British I
poliey of free trade. The voters of the Union
will now have an opportunity to pass upon this
question fairly and without avoidance or eva
sion. Senator Frye, of Maine It is exactly th
message which we wanted. It sharply defines
the issues, and leaves the Republicans tbe issus
they desired.
Representative Townsend ' said: ''Elegant,
elegant! It beats them all. It could not be bet
ter. We are going to stand by him, and we art
going to win."
Senator Chandler I only fear the Democratic
party will not indorse it, and will go back on it.
The Republicans want nothing better with
which to sweep the country.
Senator Cullom said: "It is a good free-trade
message, and to that extent it is of use to us.
We are entirely willing to have the Democratic
party come out for free trade."
Dunham, of Chicago The message is simply
a few more pages cut from tbe encyclopaedia,
and should be bound up with tbe rest of the en
cyclopaedia speeches of the tour.
Representative Bingham, of Pennsylvania
(Rep.) It weakens the President, and is tbe
most extreme Democratic sentiment I ever heard,
uttered on the floor of this House.
Representative Gibson (Dem.) The strongest
and boldest expression ever made by any one on
the subject. I heartily approve every word of
it It is the line we must hew to.
Wm. Walter Phelps, of New Jersey He comes
out squarely as against protection to Ameri
can labor, so that every man can see just where
he is, and on that issue we can carry the coun
try. Representative Bayne, of Pennsylvania, (Rep.)
With a balance of trade against us amount
ing to $50,000,000 annually, a man capable of
single-entry book-keeping out to know such talk
is absurd.
Senator Hawley was disgusted with the mes
sage. He described it as weak and trasby; full
of exploded ideas. He bad heard schoolboys do
better; there was no new idea or feature in it.
and there was not one practical suggestion in it.
Representative Hovey, of Indiana. (Kt-p.) It
creates an emergency and ignores tbe real Issue
before the country that of distributing the sur
plus. It will harm tbe Democratic party, and
by ignoring the soldiers bring them solidly over
to us.
Mr. Ermentrout, of Pennsylvania, a Demo
crat, thinks the President has increased the dif
ficulties of the situation in Congress in respect
to the tariff, instead of submitting suggestions
likely to bring about unity of action by tha
party.
Representative Glover (Rep.) I heard only
portions of it, but I have talked with many of
the Ohio delegation, and they are against the
message because of the argument agaiust a tariff
on wooL Without Ohio in accord 1 fear but lit
tle can be accomplished.
Mr. Brumm, of Pennsylvania It is a counter
part of Hancock' statement that the tariff is a
local issue. He wants to get rid of the five
millions of duty on wool, and keep the fifty
millions on sugar, because the first benefit the
yeomanry of tbe North, while the sugar is raised
only in the South.
Representative Owen, of 'Indiana, (Rep.) It
is a characteristic message, written, as usual, on
the line of a stump speech. The demand for
free wool and tbe silence on sugar, when there
are a million wool-growers and less than seven
teen thousand sugar-producers, wiU not quite
meet the better judgment of the people.
Mr. Wilson, of West Virginia, Democrat, who
has several times made a successful fight against
protection . in his - State, says: "Just such a
clear and authoritative statement from tbe exec
utive was needed. It makes the tariff tbe lead
ing and inevitable issue between the two polit
ical parties in Congress1 and in the next presi
dential eompaign."
A. Garland, assistant secretary of the
American Protective Tariff League, and former
ly a member of the tariff commission, said:
"When once the people find out that filling our
markets with cheap foreign goods means work
at foreign wages for those who can find any
work to do, they will effectually wipe out the
whole free-trade scheme and the men who are
behind it."
Judge Kelley.of Pennsylvania To execute tbe
objects indicated by the President without de
stroying many of the leading industries of the
country is an utter impossibility. It is said
that Mr. Cleveland publicly admitted that he
had not known bow large tbe country was until
he took bis hasty trip around tbe circle, whiea .
had not anything like the diameter of that
around which Andy Johnson swung Mr. Sew
ard. Ex-Congressman Frank Hurd, of Toledo, who
is known as one of the most strenuous advocates
of absolute free trade in this country, said:
"The President's message will serve to bring on
the direct tariff issue. That is what I want.
We shall now have political discussion of a great
principle instead of disreputable wrangles and
personalities. On this tariff issue the Dem
ocratic party can carry tbe Northwest. Soeh
states as Michigan, Iowa, .Nebraska, Wisconsin)
and Minnesota are with us on this question.
I here will be only eight or ten States left to the
Republicans. As for breaking up the South,
you can not do that."
Ben Butterworth: The Democratic majority
aim not to revise, but to- destroy. They oppose
the system in toto, and hence there is tbe
strongest probability that what they would call
revision would be no more and no less than tbe
kind of pruning of which Mr. Dorsheimer spoke
when he said: "We propose to cut, to cut deep,
to cut to the quick, in revising tbe tariff" It
was simply a declaration of war upon the pro
tective system. We understand that the so-
called revision by the Democratic majority
means a studied assault upon the system. And
that we are bound by our faith to prevent.
If we bave to delay that revision in order to
preserve the system, the people will sustain us.
and elect a Congress which will promptly and
properly revise and yet not destroy tbe tarin.
Mr. Randall said: "There will be a reduction
of taxation at this session to the extent of f 60,
000,000 or more, but not on the exact line of the
President's suggestions. The internal taxes
will be reduced in part, or in a large degree re
moved, which the President does not seem to
favor, and some reductions will be made in the
rates of duties on imports."
It is clear, from what Mr. Randall said, that
he and his followers will insist that the greater
part of tbe reductions to be made in the rev
enues shall be made in internal taxation, and
that they intend to present a bill for that pur
pose.' It will be a bill to abolish the tobacco
taxes, and will contain only so much relating to
tariff as may be supposed to be needed to make
it palatable to the "free-traders."
Mr. McAdoo, of New Jersey, who is Mr. Ran
dall's lieutenant, said: "So far as I am con
cerned, tbe recommendations of tbe President
will have due weight and consideration. Ho is
undoubtedly honest and sincere, and bis anxiety
about the surplus is shared by nearly every
member of the House, so far as I know." He
frankly admitted, however, that be differed
from the President as to the principles which
nnderlie federal taxation, and did not concur in
his suggestions as to the remedy for the ex
cessive income of the government.
MR. "WATTERSON'S VIEWS.
Article in Louisville Courier-Journal: Though
the readers of the Courier-Journal will find noth
ing that is wholly new to them in the Presi
dent's handling of the tariff be goes out of the
way, in fact, to disavow anv intention to in
struct they will meet in its perusal, along with
many strong, terse expressions, many old, famil
iar friends. Tbe infantile mendicant, a hundred
years of age. is treated to tbe disdain he merits,
and an excellent and sonnd argument is made to
contradict tbe fallacies that high tariffs make
high wages or cheapen the necessary commodi
ties entering into tbe daily living of tbe poor.
On this point the message is most elaborate and
emphatic, making it clear that the President
bos resolved no longer to neglect a field of pub
lic usefulness to which the Democratic party
needs most to address itself. That field is tha
real interest of the great body of wage-earners
in the United States. Tbe time has come when
they shoald be fearlessly educated out of the
falsehood that protection protects them.
Taken in connection with Mr. Carlisle's ad
mirable remarks on assuming tbe chair, these
pages from the message are at once significant
and encouraging. They mean that there is one
fence which we shall not again attempt to strad
dle, and that a fence constructed by ourselves,
out of the supposed ignorance and credulity of
tbe work-people. Not until we leap this and
take the middle of the highway of honest, cour
ageous discussion, shall we make any progress
in dissipating an illusion which, through the
help of timorous, time-serving Democrats, the
Republicans bave hitherto been enabled to work
to their exclusive profit.
Attention is called to analogous points neither
to belittle tbe message nor to extol the Courier
Journal, but as an answer to a concerted move
ment on tbe part of certain protectionist news
papers in the East of late to create the impres
sion that the Courier-Journal is fighting upon a
different and more extreme line of reform than
the administration a misrepresentation which
these quotations and, indeed, the entire body of
tbe message completely explode. It is for tbe
unfair critics of the Courier-Journal now to
cease their cavils and fall into the column led
by the President or to fall out and into the ranks
of tbe Republican party. There is no longer
middle ground to stand on, and still less to fight
on. -

Tbe Mail and Express (Rep.): The President

He has taken a courageous stand, and we sin
