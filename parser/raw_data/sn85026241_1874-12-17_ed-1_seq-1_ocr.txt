successfully. . "I d not care," he says,
"what the antecedents of a candidate

He thinks the party has made some

the attempt to pass the Civil Rights' bi 11.

that while the Civil Rights bill was

President's Message.
To the Senate and Route of Representative!:
THE PROSTRATION OF BUSINESS.
Since the convening of Congress one
year ago the nation has undergone a
prostration in business and industries
such as has not been witnessed with us
for many years. Speculations as to the
causes for this prostration might be
indulged in without profit, because as
many theories il be advanced at
there would be independent writers
those who expressed their own views
without bortowiog upon the subject.
Without indulging in theories as to the
oanse of this prostration therefore, I
will call your attention only to the fact
and to some plain questions as to which
it would seam there should be no dis
agreement. Daring this prostration
two essential elements of prosperity
have been most abundant.
labos and capital
Both have been largely unemployed.
Where security has been undoubted
capital has been attainable at very mod
erate rates. Where labor has been
wanted it has been found in abun
dance at cheap rates as compared with
the cost of the necessaries and comforts
of life which could be pmcbased with
the wages demanded. Two great ele
ments of prosperity, therefore, have
not been denied us, to which a third
might be added,
CAPACITY OF THE SOIL.
Our soil is unequalled within the
limits of any contiguous territory under
one nation for its variety of productions
with which to feed and clothe a peo
ple, and m the amount of surplus to
spare to feed less favored peoples.
Therefore, with these facts in view,
it seems that wise 'Statesmanship at
this session of Congress would dic
tate legislation ignoring the past and
directing in proper channels these
great elements of prosperity to any
people.
DEBT AND CREDIT
is the only element that can with a
sound currency enter into oar affairs
to cause any continued depression in
the industries and piosperity of our
people.
CURRENCY.
A great conflict for national exis
tence made necessary for temporary
purposes the raising of large sums of
money from whatever source attaina
ble. It made necessary, in the wisdom
of Congress and I do not doubt their
wisdom in the premises (regarding the
necessities of the times) to devise a
system of national cprreacy, which it
proved to be impossible to keep on a
par with the recognized currency of
the civilized world. This begot a spirit
of speculation and extravagance and
luxury not required for the happiness
or prosperity of the people, and involv-
lug.botb directly and indirectly,foreign
indebtedness. Tha currency, beings
fluctuating valae, and therefore nnsafe
to hold for legitimate transactions
requiring money, became a subject of
speculation in itself. These two causes,
however, have involved ns in a foreign
indebtedness, contracted in good faith
by borrower and lender, which should
be paid accoiding to tbe bond agreed
upon when the debt was contracted, in
srold or its equivalent. The good faith
of tbe Government can not be violated
toward creditors without material dis
grace. -nrr
COMMERCE AND MANUFACTURES.
Our commerce should be encouraged,
the American ship building and carry
ing capacity increased, foreign markets
sought for the products of the soil and
tbe manufacturer, to the end that we
may be able to pay those debts. Where
new roarcet can oe created ror toe
sale of our products, either of tbe soil
ths mine, or the manufactory, a new
means is discovered of utilizing our
idle capital and labor to tbe advantage
of the whole people. But, in my judg
ment, the first step towards accomplish
ing this object it to secure
A CURRENCY GOOD WHEREVER CIVILIZA
TION REIGNS
one which whenever it becomes supera
bundant with ouo people will find a
market with some other a currency
which has as its basis tbe labor necessa
ry to produce it, which will give to
it its value. Gold and silver are now
the recognized mediums of exchange
tbe civilized world over, and to this we
should return with tbe least practica
ble delay. In view of the pledges of
the American Congress when our
present legal tender system was adopt
ed, there should be no delay, certainly
no unnecessary delay, in fixing by leg
islation a method by which we will
return to specie. To the accomplish
ment of this end I invite your especial
attention, I believe firmly that there
can be no prosperous aud permanent
revival of business and industries until
a policy is adopted, with legislation to
carry it out, looking to a returu to a
specie basis. It is easy to conceive that
tbe debtor and speculative classes may
think it of value to to tbem to make
so-called money abundant until they
can throw a portion of their business
on others, but even these, f believe.
would be disappointed in the result if
a course should be pursued which will
keep in doubt tbe value of the legal
tenaer medium of exchange.
A REVIVAL OP PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRY
is needed by all classes by none more
than the holders or property, of what
ever sort, with debts to liquidate by
realization npon its sale. But admit
ting that these two dosses of citizens
are to be benefitted by expansion.
would not the general loss be too great
to justify such relief? Woold it not
just as honest and prudent to author
ize each debtor to issue bis own legal
tenders to the extent ot his liabilities
as to this? Would it not be' safer, for
fear of over-issues by unscrupulous
creditors, to say that all debts and ob
ligations are abliterated in the United
states, and now are we to commence
anew, each possessing all he has at the
time free from incumbrance? These
positions are too absurd to ba enter
tained for a moment by thinking or
honest people; yet every delay in the
preparation for final resumption par
takes of this dishonesty, and only
lessens the hope that a convenient day
will at last arrive for tbe good work
of redeeming our pledges.
IT WILL NEVER COME,
In my opinion, except by positive action
by Congress or by national disasters
which will distroy, foretime at least,
the credit of tbe individual aud the
State at large. A sound currency
might be reached by total bankruptcy
and discredit of the nation and of tbe
individual. I believe it is the duty of
Congress at this sossion to device such
legislation as will renew confidence.
revive industries, start ns on a career
or prosperity to lsst for many years.
and to save tbe credit of this nation
and of this people. Steps toward
return to a specie basis are the great
requisite devoutedly to be sought for,
ana there are others, which 1 may
touch npon hereafter. A nation deal
ing in a currency below that of specie
in value, labors under two great dis
advantages. First, having no use for
tbe world's acknowledged medium ef
eicbange, gold aud silver, these are
driven out of the country, because there
is uo demand for their use; socond, the
medium of exchange in use being of
fluctuating value for, after all, it really
is only worth just what it will pur
chase of gold and silver melals, hav
ing, an intrinsic value just in propor
tion to tbe honest labor it takes to
produce them, a larger margin must
be allowed for profit by the mana
facturer and pioducer. It is months
from tbe data of production to the date
of production to the date of realization ;
it) teres t npon capital must be charged
and the risk of fluctuation in the value
of that which is to be received in pay
ment added, uence high prices act as
a protection to the foreign producer
who receives nothing in exchange for
the products of his skill and labor ex
cept for a currency good at a stable
value the world over. It seems to me
that nothing is clearer than that the
greater part of tbe burden ef the exist
ing piostration is for
THE
WANT OF A SOUND FINANCIAL SYS
TEM
the evil of which falls upon the work
ing man, who must after all produce
Ihe wealth and the salaried man, who
superintends and conducts business.
The burdeu falls upon them in two
ways, by the deprivation ' of employ
ment and the decreased purchasing
power ol their salaries. It is the duty
of Congress to devise the method of
correcting the evil, which are acknowl
edged to exist and not mine, but I will
ventuie to suggest two or three things
which seem to me as absolutely necessa
ry to a return to specie payments As
a first great requisite to a return to
prosperity, tbe legal tender clause to
tbe law authorizing the issue of curren
cy by the National Government should
be repealed, to take effect as to all con
tracts entered Into after a day fixed by
the repealing act, not to apply, however
to the payment of salaries by the Gov
ernment, or for other expenditures
now provided by law to be paid in cur
rency in the interval pending between
tbe repeal and tbe final resumption.
Provision should be made by which the
Secretary of tbe Treasury can obtain
gold as it may become necessary from
time to time from the date when specie
redemption commences. To this might
and should be added a revenue suffi
ciently in excess of tbe expenses to in
sure an accumulation of gold in tbe
Treasury to sustain the redemption. I
commend this subject to your careful
consideration, believing that a favorable
solution is attainable, and that if reach
D7hi Congress the present and fu-
generations will ever gratefully
remember it as their deliverer from a
thraldom of evil and disgrace. With
resumption, free banking may be au
thorized with safety, giving tbe full
protection to bill holders which they
have under tbe existing laws. Indeed
I would regard free banking as essential.
It would give proper elasticity to tbe
currency, as more currency should be
required for the transaction of legiti
mate business. New banks would be
started, and in turn tbe old banks would
wind up their business, when it was
fonud that there was a superabundance
of currency. Tbe experience and judg
ment of the people can best decide just
bow much currency is required for the
transaction of the business of the coun
try. It is nnsafe to leave the settle
ment of this question to Congress, the
Secretary of the Treasury and the Ex
ecutive. Congress should make the
regulations under which bunks may ex
ist, but should not make banking a mo
nopoly by limiting the amount of re
deemable paper currency that shall be
authorized. Such importance do I at
tach to this subject, and so earnstly do
commend It to your attention, that I
give it prominence by introducing U at
the beginning of the message.
THE DEPLORABLE STRIFE IN CUBA
continues without any marked change
in the relative advantages of the con
tending forces, and the insurrectiou stilt
continues. But Spain has gained no
snperiority in six years of strife, and
thus gives the Insurrection a signifi
cance which cannot be denied. Its do
ration aud the tendency of its advance
together with the absence of the mani
fested power ot suppression on the
part of Spain cannot be controverted
and may lake some positive steps on
the part of other powers a matter of
necessity. 1 had confidently hoped at
this time to be able to announce tbe ar
rangement of some of the important
questions between this government and
that of Spain, but the negotiations have
been protracted. The nnbappy intes
tine disseutions of Spain command our
profound sympathy and must be ac
cepted as perhaps a cause of some de
lay. An early settlement in part, at
least, of tbe questions between the gov
ernments is hoped. In tbe meantime,
awaiting tbe result of immediately
pending negotiations, I defer a further
and full communication on the subject
of tbe relations of this country and
Spain.
TREASURY MATTERS
The report of tbe Secretary of the
Treasury, which is made directly to
Congress and which forms no part of
this message, will show the receipts and
expenditures of the Government for
the last fiscal year, the amount receiv
ed from each source of revenue, and
the amount paid out for each of the
departments of the Government. It
will be observed from this report that
the amount of receipts over the expend
itures has been but $2,344,882 for tbe
fiscal year ending June 30th, 1874, aud
that for the current year the estimated
receipts over the expenditures will not
much exceed $9,000,000. In view of the
large ualioiuU debt existing and tbe
obligations to add one per cent per
annum to tne sinking fund a sum
amounting now to. over $300,000 per
annum I submit whether revenues
should not be increased or expenditures
diminished to reach this amount of sur
plus. Not to provide for the sinking
fund is a partial failure to comply with
the contracts and obligations of tbe
Government. At the last sossion of
Congress a very considerable reduc
tion was made in the rates of taxation
and in the number of articles submitted
to taxation. Tbe question may well bo
asked whether or not in some instances
this was wise. In connection with this
subject of funding, I atu of the opinion
that the means ol collecting ravenue,
especially irotn imports, bave been so
embarrassed by legislation as to make
itqoestionable whethe r or not large
amounts are not lost by failure to col
lect, to the direct loss of the Treasury
and to tbe prejudice of the interests of
honest importers of taxpayers. -
Tbe Secretary of the Treasury, in his
report, favors legislation looking to
AN EARLY RETURN TO SPECIE PAYMENT,
thus supporting the views previously
expressed in this message. He also
recommends economy in appropria
tions, cans attention to tbe loss of rev
enue from repealing the tax on tea and
cocee without benefit to tbe consumer,
and recommends an increase of 10 cents
per gallon on whisky ; and further, that
no modincauon be made in tbe bank
iog and currency bills passed last see
sion of Congress, unless modification
shonld become necessary by reason of
the aboption of the Treasurer's recom
mendation for returning to specie pay
meuts. And in thes'e recommendations
I cordially join. I would su rarest to
Congress the propriety of readjusting
tbe tariff so as to increase the revenue
and at the same time decrease the nam
oer 01 articles npon which duties are
levied. Those articles which enter in
to oor manufactures, and are not pro-
oucea at nome, it seems to me should
... . .
be treated free. Those articles of man
ufacture of which we produce a coo
stituent part, but do not produce 1 the
whole, that part which we do not pro
duce should enter free also. I will in
stance fine wool, dyes, &c. These arti
cles must be imported to form a part of
the manufacture of tbe higher grades of
woolen goods. Chemicals nsed as dyes.
compounded in medicines, and nsed in
various ways in manufactures, come nn
der this class. The introduction, free
of duty, of such wools as we do not
produce should stimulate tbe manu
facture of goods requiring the use of
those we do produce and therefore
would benefit home productions. There
are many articles entering into home
manufacturers which we do not pro
duce ourselves, the tariff upon which
increases to cost of producing the man
ufactured articles. AH corrections in
this regard are in tbe direction of bring
ing labor and capital in harmony with
each other, and of supplying one of the
elements or prosperity so much needed.
THE ARMY AND NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of War,
herewith attached, and forming a part
of this message, gives all the informa
tion concerning the operations, wants
and necessities of the army, and con
tiiins many suggestions and recommen
dations which I commend to your . at
tention. There is no class of,. Govern
ment employes who are harder worked
tban the army officers and men; none
who perform their tasks more cheer
fully and efficiently, under circum
stances of the great pri vat ions and hard
ships. It is desirable to reader more
efficient this branch of the public ser
vice. All the recommendations of the
Secretary of War I regard as judicious,
and I specially command to your at
tention the following: Consolidation of
Government arsenals; the restoration
of mileage to. officers traveling under
orders; the exemption of money receiv
ed from tbe sale of subsistence stores
from being covered into the Treasury;
the use of appropriations for subsistence
stores without waitiug for the begin
ning of tbe fiscal year for which the
appropriations are made; for addition
al appropriations for the collection of
toi pedo material; for increased appro
priations in the manufacture of arras;
for relieving the State frem indebted
ness for arms charged to them during
the rebellion; for dropping officers from
the iolls of the army without trial for
the offense of drawing pay more than
once for the same period; for the dis
couragement of tbe plan ef paying sold
iers by checks; and the establishment
of a professorship of rhetoric and En
glish literature at West Point.
The reason for these recommenda
tions are obvions, and are set forth
su fficiently in the report attached. . .
I also recommend that the staff corps
of the army be fixed, Where this has
not been done, so that promotions may
be made, and vacancies filled as they !
occur in each grade when reduced be
low the number to be fixed by law.
The necessity for such a regulation is
specially felt now in the pay depart
ment. The number of officers in that
department is below the number ade
quate to the performance of the duties
required of them by law. The effici
ency of the Navy has been largely in
creased during the In.-t year under the
1.1 pulse of the foreign complications
which threatened us at the commence
ment ef the last session of Congress.
Most of our efficient wooden ships were
put in condition for immediate service
and the ropair of our Iron Clad fleet
were pushed with the utmost vieor.
The result is that the most of Iheete are
now in an effective state and need only.
to be manned and put in commission
to go at once into service. Some of the
new sloops authorized by Congress are
already in commission, and the most
of the remainder are launched and only
wait tne completion oi their machinery
to enable them to take their places as
part of our effective force. Two iron
torpedo ships bave been completed dur
ing the last year, and four of oar large
double turretted Iron Clads are now
undergoing repairs. When these are
finished everythine that is useful of
our Navy as now authorized, will be in
condition for service, and with the ad
vance in the science of torpedo warfare,
the American Navy, comparatively
small as it is, will be found at any time
powerful enough ror the purpose of a
raceful nation.

THE SOUTHERN STATES.
Your attention will be drawn to the
unsettled condition of affairs in some
or the Southern States. On the 14th of
September last the Governor of Louis
iana called upon me, as provided by
the Constitution and laws of the United
States, to aid him in suppressing the
domestic violence in that State; This
call was made in view of a proclama
tion issued on that day, by D. B. Penn,
claiming that he was elected Lieutenant-Governor
in 1872, and calling upon
the militia of the State to arm, assem
ble and drive from power the usurpers,
as he designated tbe officers of the State
government. The next day I Issued
my proclamation commanding the In
surgents to disperse within five days
from the date thereof, and subsequen
tly learned that on that day they had
taken forcible possession of the State
House. Steps were taken by roe to sup
port the existing and recognized State
government, but before the expiration
of the five days the insurrectionary
movement was practically abandoned
and the officers of the State govern
ment men t, with some minor., excep
tions, resumed tneir powers and duties,
Considering that the present State ad
ministration of Louisiana has been the
only government in that State for near
ly two years, that it has been tacitly
acknowledged and acquiesced in as
such by Congress, and more than once
expressly recognized by me, J, reirard
ed It as my clear duty, when legally

I regret to say that with tbe prepare-
for tbe late election decided in-
dications appeared in some localities in
the Southern States of a determination
by acts of violence and intimidation to
deprive citizens of tbe freedom of the
ballot, because of their political opin-
ions. Bands of men, masked and arm-
made their appearance: white lea-
gues and other societies were formed;
large quantities of arms and immuni-
tion were imported and distributed to
these organizations; military drills,
with menacing demonstrations, were
held.and with all these murders enough
were committed to spread terror amonc
those whose politicsi action was to h
suppressed, if possible, by these intoler-
ant and criminal proceedings. In some
places colored laborers were compelled
to vote accord inir to the wishes of their
employers under threats of a discbarge,
too many instances in which when
these threats were disregarded they
remorselessly executed bv ihoi
who made them. I understand that

citizens the right to vote and to protect

right. Enjoined by the Constitution to

successive assemblies, ratified bv a I
majority of tbe electors of the State
voting thereon. On the 11th of May
1874 the Governor convened an extra
session of the General Assembly of the
which, on tbe 18th of tbe same
month passed an act providing for a
couventioa to frame a new Constitution
Eursuant to this act, and at the election
on tbe 30th of Jane 1874 the Con-
stitution was approved and j delegates
were chosen thereto, who assembled on
the 14th of July and formed a new Con-
stitution, the schedule of which pro-
vided for the election of an entire new
set of State officers, in a manner con-
trary to the then existing election laws
of that State. . On the 13th of October,
1874, this Constitution, as therein pro
vided, was submitted to the people for
their approval or rejection, and accord
ing to the election returns was approv
ed by a large majority of those qualified
to vote thereon, and at tbe same elec
tion persons were chosen to fill all the
State, county and township offices.
Tbe Governor elected in 1872 for the
term of four years turned over his
vjffice to tbe Governor chosen under the
new Conatiiution, whereupon tbe Lieu
tenant Governor, also elected in. 1872
for a term of i years, claiming to act as
Governor, and alleging that said pro
ceedings, by which the asv Constitu
tion was made and a new set of officers
elected, were u nconstitu tion al( illegal
and void, called upon roe as provided
in section 4, article 4 or the uoosuui-
tion to protect the State against dom
estic violence. As Congress is now in
vestigating the political affairs of Ark
ansas, I bave declined to interfere.
Tbe whole subject of Executive inter
ference with the affairs of a State is re
pugnant to the public opinion, to the
feeling of those who from their official
capacity must be msed in such interpo
sition, and to him or those who must
direct. Unless most clearly on the side
of law. such interference becomes a
crime, and, with the law to Bupport.lt,
is condemned without a hearing. I
desire therefore that all necessity for
Executive direction in. local affairs may
become unnecessary and obsolete. I
invite the attention not only of Con
gress, but of the people of the United
States, to the causes and effects oT these
unhappy questions. ' li there not a Dis
position of one side to magnify these
wrongs and outrages, and on the other
to belittle or juetify them ? If the pub
lic could be directed to a correct survey
of what is right, and to rebuking wrong
and aiding the proper authorities In
punishing it, a better state of feeling
would be inculcated, and the sooner we
would bave that peace which would
leave the States free Indeed, to regulate
their own domestic affairs. I believe
on the part of our citizens of the South
ern States, that the better part of them
are of a disposition to be law abiding
and to do no violence either to individ
uals or to the laws existing But do tnev
do right In ignoring tbe existence of vi
olence and bloodshed In, resistance to
the constituted authority. 1 sympa

CHEAP TRANSPORTATION.
The subject of cheap transDortatioa
has occupied the attention of Con cress.
and much new light on this qaestloa
will without doubt be given by tne
committee appointed by the last Con
gress to investigate and report upon -this
subject. A revival of ship build- '
ing and particularly of iron, steamship-
bnudingis oi vast importance to our
National prosperity, tha United State
is now oeving over 1100.000.000 dot an
num for freight and passage oa foreign
ships, to be carried abroad and expend
ed in the employment and support of
other people's beyond a flair percentage
of what should go to foreign vessels,
estimating on the tonnage and travel
of each respectively. . It la to be regret
ted that this disparity in the carrying
trade exists, and to correct I woold be
willing to see a great departure from
tbe usual coarse of government ia
supporting what might osnaUy be
termed private enterprise. I would
not suggest as a remedy a direct subsidy
to American steamship lines, but I
would suggest the direct offer oi am pie
compensation for carrying the mail
between the Atlantic seaboard cities
and tbe Continent on American-owned
and American-built steamer, and
would extend this liberality to vessels
carrying the mail to South American
States, and te Central America and
Mexico, and would pursue the same
policy from our Pacific seaports to for
eign seaports on tbe Pacific. It might
be demanded toai. vessels mui for tni
service should come op to a standard
fixed by legislation in tonnage, speed,
and all other qualities looking to the
possibility of tbe Government's requir
ing them st some time for war pur
poses, xne ngnt aiao oi taxing posses
sion of tbem ia such an emergency
should be guaranteed. I offer these
suggestions, believing them worthy of
consideration In all seriousness, affect
ing as they do all sections and interests
alike. If anything better can be done
to direct the country Into a course of
general prosperity, no one will be more
ready than I to second tbe plan. ... -,
