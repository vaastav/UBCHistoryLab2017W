A Food
to Work On
Work! Work!! Work!!!
Lots of energy is needed to keep up the pace. In
the struggle, the man with the strong body and clear
brain wins out every time.
The man of to-day needs something more than
mere food ; he needs a food that makes energy a food
to work on.
Although some people may not realize it, yet it is
a fact, proved and established beyond doubt, that soda
crackers and this means Uneeda BiSCUlt arc
richer in muscle and fat-making elements and have a
much higher per cent, of tissue-building properties
than any other article of food made from flour.
That this is becoming known more and more every
day is attested by the sale of nearly 400,000,000 pack
ages of Uneeda Biscuit, the finest soda cracker
ever baked. An energy-giving food of surpassing
value sold in a package which brings it to you with
all the original flavor and nutriment perfectly pre
served. Truly the food to Ivork on.
Whoever you are whatever you are wherever
you work Uneeda Biscuit.

Effects of Dcclulon Will Do to Con
tinue to Hold Accused Men in Con
finement Pendlnrj Trial for Murder
of Former Governor Steunenberg.
Washington Dec. I. Tho supremo
court of tho United States decided tho
habeas corpus case of Moyer, Hay
wood utid l'ottibone, the representa
tives of the Western Federation of
Miners, who aro now held in prison
lu Idaho on the charge of complicity
In tho murder of former Governor
Bteunenberg, adversely to tho men.
The effect of the decision will be to
continue to hold tho men in confine
ment for trial in Idaho. ,
The eases came to this court on an
appeal from a decision of the Idaho
federal court refusing to grant writs
of hnbeas corpus. The principal point
of controversy wns the method by
which tho Idaho authorities secured
Jurisdiction over tho men. All ot
them aro residents of Colorado and
It was alleged on behalf of Moyer and
his associates that they were kid
naped In pursuance of n, conspiracy,
to wHiIch tho governor or Colorado and
the Idaho authorities were parties and
hence that jurisdiction was acquired
by fraud.
Justice Harlan said that in the
hnbeas corpus proceedings In tho
United States courts the method of
extradition of tho defendants wns not
mntcrial.
Justice McKenna delivered a tils-1
senting opinion, holding that Moyer,
Haywood and Pettibono had a right to
invoke tho aid of tho federal courts
to correct improper methods used In
securing their extradition. Ho said
that kidnaping under the law Is no
more to he justified than when per
formed outside tho law, whoro every
effort of authority is used to prevent
and punish It.

and a posso has started in pursuit.
Miss West comes of one of the wealth
iest families in Green county. She

PREVAILING TONE OF LONDON
EDITORS IS FAVORABLE.
DISCUSS JAPANESE SITUATION
Leading Newspapers Emphasize Presl-'
dent's Warning of Possible Use of
Federal Forces to Secure Fair Con-,
sWeration of Treaty Rights.
London, Dec. 5. President Itoose-
velfa message to the American con-1
greso occupies tho most prominent '
placo In tho leading newspapers and .
has attracted widespread attention.
Tho provalllng tono of comment is fa
vorablo, particularly with roferenco
to tho president's statements on tho
Japanese, situation, tho nowspapors
emphasizing tho president's warning
of a possiblo use of tho federal forces
for tho protection of tho Japanese.
This foaturo of tho, nieqsasQ ! given
especial s.u's r.c Hon in official Japa
nese quarters, .score It Is pointed out
that Japan Is satisfied to await tho
outcome of tho issuu between the fed
eral and state authorities.
Tho Standard snys tho most signifi
cant feature of tho message is that
the president is constantly finding
himself "up against" tho American
constitution. Knrslghted observers
have long since seen that the United
States has outgrown its cradle, yet
the conservative sentiment of tho most
conservative- pooplo on earth clusters
most strongly around the constitution.
If thero aro .to ho reforms, they can
only result from drastic reconstruc
tion of the political system and tho
prospect of their realization appears
somewhat remote
The Daily Express finds the message
a strong demonstration of tho fact
that tho main currents of the nntlonnl
lire in England and America are
sweeping forward in parallel lines,
namely tho struggle of nationalism
against anti-nationalism and of tho
state against socialism.
Havana, Dec. B. The message of
President Roosevelt to tho American
congress was published In tho local
press. Liberal and moderato leaders
are chary of expressing an opinion of
tho president's declaration regnrdlng
a Cuban policy, but tho general view
is that It does not differ materially
from tho statements made In tho let
ter to Senor Quesada, the Cuban min
ister, Inst September and that tho
final determination of tho policy of
tho United States rests in tho hands
of congress.
Rome, Dec. 5. President Roose
velt's messngo to tho American con
gress has produced nn oxcellent im
pression hero. His denunciation o;
lynching nnd tho paragraphs upon
peace and righteousness and when
wnr is not meroly Justifiable but im
perative have been received with es
pecial satisfaction.
