THE BRIDGE PREFEXTMEXT.
The grand jury's presentment on the breaking
of suspender rods and cable bands on the Brook
lyn Bridge last July and certain conditions
which that occurrence indicated is studiously
moderate in its tone and conservative in its
conclusions. The grand jury has not found
such proof* of -wilful" neglect as would de
mand the indictment of those responsible for
the care of the bridge, but it calls the neglect
"culpable." and admonishes all concerned that
the circumstances which are now regarded as
extenuating could not properly be so regarded
hereafter. The character of the neglect which
led to the rupture of rods and bands is thus
described :
The gTand jury find from the evidence before
them that The New-York and Brooklyn Bridge
has never been either regularly or systemati
cally inspected, and that its management In this
regard has l.«y no means been in accord with
that which would naturally characterize its
management had it bet-n private property under
the control of a good business man charged with
responsibility for its safety. Methods of inspec
tion well known and even common among bridge
engineers have been wholly omitted, and we are
satisfied that if the bridge had been periodically
subjected to a proper systematic inspection such
an accident as that of July 24 last would have
been avoided. We further find that during the
period under consideration such inspection of
the bridge as did take place was made by car
penters, riggers, riveters and such mechanics,
wholly undirecu-d and uninstructed as to
methods by any engineer, and that, too. at no
stated time and at no regular intervals, and
that their so-called inspection did not in any
ca5 A include a comprehensive inspection of the
bridge as a whole, even by such methods as
might suggest themselves to these mechanics.
So far as is known, the mechanics referred to
did their work in a satisfactory manner, and no
discredit attaches to them on account of the
work that was left undone. But the quiet state
ment of facts which we have quoted is a
decisive condemnation of the men charged with
The maintenance of an immensely important
structure and responsible for the safety of all
who use it. When a large allowance has been
made for the spirit of laxity which service
under the municipal government ha? too com
monly engendered, it still appears amazing that
nridge officials could have been so reckless. It
< scarcely possible to think of another public
rust so well adapted to inspire a profound
cuse of obligation in those to whom it is com
mitted. It seems as if the mere sight of the
vf. with the stream of traffic incessantly
flowing over it. would compel its guardians (o
l^erform their whole diity with the utmost vigil
ance. Yet the grand jury finds that it "has
•nf-^-er been either regularly or systematically
"inspected"— in other words, that the first essen
tial of prudent management has been deliber
ately neglected. Under the circumstances the
■woj)der is wn that merely a few rods and bands
save way. but that vastly more serious mischief
than has yet been discovered did not result.
We hope it is safe to assume that no such lack
,t care and system will be tolerated or even be
conceivable hereafter— that there will never be
occasion for giving effect to the grand jury
declaration as to The limits of leniency. If its
recommendations are followed the bridge, which
I? now found to be safe, though at some points
the present strain leaves little margin, will
remain safe. If. as is said, the examinations
made since the break last summer have not
been exhaustive, there should be no delay in
ascertaining the exact condition of every part;
and in the future a system of competent Inspec
tion at frequent intervals, probably under the
supervision of an engineer who has no other
duties to perform, ought to be established.
Nothing less than that is an adequate safe
guard. Indeed, common sense would require as
much as that if property interests alone were at
stake. We observe that Commissioner Shea is
pleased to interpret the action of the grand jury
in making a presentment Instead of finding an
indictment as a "vindication."' It was hardly
necessary that he should give the community
another reason for being glad that he is about
to be retired, but that is just what he has done.
It may be hoped that no future incumbent of
bis office will be so situated as to rejoice in
such an escape.
BEFVBUCAHS IX THE CITY GOVERXMEXT.
Mr. Low yesterday announced the names of
several of the members of his official family
selected from the Republican wing of his sup
porters. They will be received with approval
both by their party and the general public.
Some time ago the Mayor-elect gave it to be
understood that in making appointments, other
things being equal, he would prefer the active
participant in politics and worker for the over
throw of Tammany to the person who holds
aloof from the hard work of campaigns. He
has with good reason now taken several of his
assistants from the ranks of Republican work
ers. The organization supported him earnestly
and furnished the majority of the votes neces
sary for his election. It has made no claims to
patronage, and has kept its pledge to uphold Mr.
Ixiw without regard to the distribution of loaves
and fishes. Mr. Low recognizes the Republican
party, however, as one of the necessary props
of a successful administration, and naturally de
sires its co-operation. He also sees the pro
priety of taking some of his assistants from
among the active organization men of ability
and integrity. In so doing he serves not only
his own immediate purposes as head of the city
government, but tends to promote honest poli
tics in all parties. The idea that good govern
ment is not to be looked for from active party
politicians is one of the most harmful ever circu
lated in the name of reform. It tends to turn
the management of parties over to the bad ele
ments in them, and to create organized oppo
sition out of what might under proper leader
ship have been powerful assistance to reforms.
The old type of district leaders which at one
time disgraced the Republican organization in
this city has been giving way before the work
of earner and honest men to place the control
of their districts in worthy hands, who would
use party power for the public benefit. One of
the leaders in the Scht against the old selfish
ness and corruption is MoDouenll Hawkep,
named for L>ock Commissioner. He is a district
leader who stands for thn progressive policy of
President Morris, and has won his district away
from the old Tammany Republicans. His busi
ness and personal reputation mark him as a
man excellently equipped to discharge the duties
of the office to which he has been named. Will
iam R. Willcox, who is to be Park Commissioner
for Manhattan and Richmond, and doubtless
president of the Park Board, is not a district
leader, but he is an energetic party worker. He
was the Republican candidate for Congress
against O. H. P. Belmont last year, and in a
heavily Democratic district made a strong cam
paign and greatly reduced the Democratic ma
jority. Mr. Wilicoi is a lawyer, has been inter
ested in East Side settlement work, and is ex
pected to devote much attention to the question
of small parks. He can also doubtless be
trusted to take an enlightened view of the
larger questions of park management and con
tinue the development of Central Park in har
mony with the ideals of landscape art which in
spired Olmsted in creating it, but which have
not been faithfully followed ny Tammany. It
is understood that Mr. Willcox was not a candi
date for any office under the city administra
tion, and reluctantly consented to accept Mr.
Low's invitation.
Thomas Sturgis. Mr. Low's selection for Fire
Commissioner, held that office for a time under
Mayor Strong and made an excellent record.
He is a business man of large experience and
the highest reputation for integrity. He can be
implicitly trusted to break up the scandalous
practices which under Scanneil have made the
city pay unreasonable prices for (supplies, and
extorted from merchants as commissions for
favorites their fair profit on sales to the city.
The president of the Department of Taxes and
Assessments is to be James L. Wells, who was
the fusion candidate for President of the Bor
ough of The Bronx. He is a prominent real
estate man and is well qualified for his new
work. Mr. Low's Republican appointments
fully measure up to the standard set by his
earlier Democratic selections.
TARIFF OOWCEB6IOVB TO FILIPINOS.
Coincidently with the passage by the House
of Representatives of the bill imposing the
Dingley rates of duty on goods from the Phil
ippines' comes the report of -the Philippine Com
mission recommending a reduction of 50 per
cent in the imposts on tobacco, hemp, sugar
and other products of the islands. Probably, if
this recommendation had been before the lead
ers of the House when they prepared the pend
ing measure, or at any time while it might have
had consideration before the final vote, some
change would have been made in the bill to
conform to the needs of the islands as set
forth by those best acquainted with their con
dition. The fight that has been successfully
made on the constitutional question involved in
the Foraker act for Porto Rico was to establish
the power of Congress to deal with the outly
ing possessions with a perfectly free hand as
their interests might require, unhampered by
our own domestic revenue and administrative
systems. The object wns not to build a wall to
shut our dependents out f 'om reasonable ac
cess to our markets. In Porto Riqp. after the
Foraker act had served the purpose of estab
lishing that freedom and furnishing needed
immediate revenue in the island until a scheme
of Internal taxation could be perfected, its im
ports lapsed, and the Porto Ricans now enjoy
free entry for their products to this country.
It is undoubtedly necessary to pass a tariff
bill applying to goods from the Philippines.
They have rates of duties on imports from for
eign countries different from our own. We al
low other nations to trade with the Philippines
on the same terms as ourselves, and are bound
to do so if we would have the privileges of the
open door in China. If we maintain no custom
house through which Philippine goods must
pass, the imports of Europe and the Orient into
the Philippines can be brought on here without
paying duties at our established rates, and our
whole revenue system can be put in confusion.
This is not a question of the protective tariff
or of Republican policy. T'nder any party, with
protection or so-called free trade, a large ©art
XEW-YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. SATURDAY. DECEMBER 21. 1901.
C f the revenn« of the United States must come
from duties on Imports. It has been so from
the beginning whether Federalists. WMg*
Democrats or Republicans ruled: and. with the
sphere of Federal taxation limited ac it is br
ihP practical reservation of general property
iax to the States, such duties will probably
be levied for a lonjr time to come. Now. if they
are to be levied at all. there must be no loop
hole through which they can be evaded at
wholesale. Therefore, unless we are prepared
to impose our domestic tariff rates on imports
into the Philippines, both from the United
* tnte * and from foreign countries-and such
rate* are absolutely unsuited to comuuons and
co«t of living there-we must maintain a bar
rier here. That barrier, however, does not need
to be raised to full height against products of
the islands themselves. Its purpose with re
card to them should be rather to provide a
means of inspection of all froods from the Phil
ippines so as to prevent fraud in foreign im
ports and to furnish revenue needed for the
islands.
The Philippine Commission is undoubtedly
the best judge of the revenue requirements of
the inlands and of what imposts can safely be
reduced and how much. It is also the best
iudpe of the political effect within its jurisdic
tion of a tariff law. If. therefore, the commis
sion believes that 50 per cent of the Dingley
duties on certain island products will, with the
increased trade likely to follow, furnish sulh
cient revenue, and at the same time encourage
industry and tend to pacify the Filipinos, its
advice is entitled to most, respectful considera
tion The Dingley rates can in general be levied
on imports from or by way of the islands and
so meet ail requirements of the situation, and
at the same time lesser duties, amply sufficient
to subject all goods to inspection, can be levied
on products of the islands, the cultivation of
which the Philippine Commission desires to en
courage. If by granting this request we can
teach Filipinos that peaceful tilling of the
soil pays much morp handsomely than bush
ranginc. we shall be solving our colonial prob
lem and saving much money. The few inter
ests that might possibly suffer somewhat by
the proposed reduction in duties are not to be
compared in importance with the whole na
tion, which is concerned to establish peace and
prosperity in the Philippines at the earliest
possible minute.
CUBATf ELECTION ARRAXGEMENTS.
In another column of to-day's paper we pub
lish a letter from Mr. Fidel G. Pierra reviewing
briefly his petftion to the Secretary of War for
a postponement of the Cuban election and a
reorganization of the election boards, together
with some salient extracts from his letter to
the Secretary of War in reply to the latter's
decision not to interfere in the matter. Mr.
Pierra will be pleasantly remembered by our
readers as one of the most conspicuous and
most esteemed Cuban leaders in the late revo
lution, and h)s representations upon this subject
are entitled to courteous and careful consider
ation. We cannot, however, regard his appeal
as altogether convincing. There are some de
tails of mattr-rs of fact upon which his testi
mony is not to be ignored. But neither can we
ignore the expert opinion and deliberate Judg
ment of th» United States administrators who
are responsibly dealing with th" case.
So far as the general principles involved are
concerned, it does not seem posr-ible to agree
with Mr. Pierra, We do not for a moment sup
pose that he and his blends, su;>i">rior!* of the
candidacy of General afaao, intended for om*
moment to involve the United States in any
local faction feuds in Cuba- Nevertheless, ?uch
would surely have been the effect of n granting
of their plea. The T'nited States must, above
all things, maintain an altitude of sin<'<>re im
partiality toward the various political parties in
Cuba, and when once a suitable dau* for flec
tion has been fixed and a representative elec
tions board constituted this government cannot
revoke or alter those arrangements to suit the*
ends of some individual candidate. There Is no
question that the Board of Scrutiny, to which
General Maso's followers object, was Impar
tially choson. without regard to any man's can
didacy and before any candidate had been put
forward. Mr. Pierra himself concedes that such
was the case. That now. long after, it should
he reconstituted in the interest of a candidacy
which has since been developed is a demand
which cannot be regarded as reasonable. If it
were granted there i* no assurance that another
such demand would not be made thr* next week
In behalf of another candidate, and so on. with
the net result that there never would be any
election or any Cuban government.
It would never do to establish such a prece
dent of mingled meddling and delay. The
United States must keep itself entirely apart
from the local Insular politics of Cuba, and
Cuba itself must proceed with the organization
and establishment of its own government at the
earliest practicable date. This latter fact is
strongly emphasised by the urgent plea for
immediate commercial reciprocity. We believe
such reciprocity is much needed and should be
granted. But It is evident that the granting of
it would be much siraplih'ed and expedited if
Cuba now had a responsible government of her
own. Less factional Intriguing and more prac
tical getting down to the serious business of
self-government are what Cuba most needs.
A GRIEVANCE AGAINST ITSELF.
The Panama Canal Company seems to be try-
Ing to air a grievance which it thinks it has
against the United States Isthmian Canal Com
mission. It complains that the commission
would not enter into a discussion of terms with
it, but simply asked its lowest price for its
property and agreed to report that to the Presi
dent. There is no allegation that the commis
sion failed to keep this agreement. On the con
trary, the fact that it did so seems to aggravate
the supposed grievance, since the commission's
report of the company's asking price is supposed
to have practically decided the case apainst
Panama.
But it does not appear that the commission
acted wrongly. On the contrary, it seems to
have done just what it should have done. It
was not appointed to purchase a canal route or
to offer a price for one. It had uo authority to
tell the Panama company that it was asking
too much for its property and that the United
Stares would be willing to pay only such or such
a price. It would have been not only undignified
but altogether improper for it to enter upon any
bargaining with the Panama company, trying
to "beat down" the price it asked for its un
finished canal. There was really nothing for it
to do but to ascertain what the company wanted
for the canal and to report that to the Presi
dent, together with an opinion as to what, in
its judgment, the canal was really worth.
The Panama company's grievance is thus
really against itself. Confessedly it asked more
than the price which it was willing to accept.
That was suspected in this country at the
time, and the opinion was expressed here that
the Panama company was "fishing for an offer"
and was trying to get this government to com
mit itself to It in some w«y. In that it did not
succeed. It tried to play too shrewd a game
and lost. Really, we cannot see that it is en
titled to much sympathy, certainly not that its
complaint against the Isthmian Canal Commis
sion is well founded. If it really wanted to sell
out to the United States It should have named
Jts minimum price and should have abided by it.
It is not becoming for it now to complain eim-
ply because the commlssion-and perhaps the
povernm en t— takes it at its own word .

will be a seasonable feature of The Sunday

array of pictures of scenes in Argentina, the
great South American State whose relations
with Chili have of late excited so much appre

the National Guard will be continued with one
on the famous "Brooklyn 23d" and its stately

The artistic treasures of the White House, the
Philadelphia exhibition of domestic animals, Dr.
Greer's work at St. Bartholomew's and his rea
sons for declining a bishopric, and the mural
painting of the Pilgrims on the Mayflower, in
the Boston State House, are among other sub
jects which will be treated with literary and

THEY WERE NOT FARSIGHTED.
Could our Knickerbocker forefathers have Im
agined how great a metropolis New-Amsterdam
would become in the first year of the twentieth
century they would have laid out all the streets
and avenues with the generous breadth of the
Bowery and Canal-st.
When the lines of Broadway from the lower
end of Manhattan Island to the northern ex
tremity, of Xassau-st. and of the thoroughfare
which formerly bore the name of Chatham-st..
but is now the upper part of Park Row; of
Elm-st. and Marion-st. and many others which
might be named, were mapped out, had the
width of every one of them been allotted with
a spacious and liberal breadth of beam, how
much better off would be the New-Yorkers of
to-day! What a pity it Is that our well meaning
ancestors from Holland and from England did
not take larger views and a longer look ahead:
Dogs delight to bark and bite, whether they

According to the figures prepared by the Con
troller, this city is a landowner on a great scale.
In this borough and in that of The Bronx New-
York holds the title to real estate valued at the
tidy sum of a half billion dollars. And it Is by
no means "land poor" at that.
The furious Impatience which Commissioner
Scanneil of the Fire Department expressed a
few months ago to appear before a Jury of his
peers and prove his Innocence of the charges
against him seems to have cooled amazingly
with the lapse of time. When he was first in
dicted, nothing could burn more fiercely than
the flames of his virtuous rage. He was all
ablaze with Impetuous zeal to meet his accusers
and put them to flight In confusion and dismay.
But there has been an election since then.

"Whenever the question of liquor Is raised." says
"The Wine and Spirit Gazette," nt this city, "an
outspoken hostility of the organized labor move
ment to the liquor interest la manifest at once.
■We may regret this hostility, but It Is there. Th«
organized liquor trade of the country Is humiliat

to the cause of personal liberty as the labor leaders
are."

Dr. J. E. Rothrock. the Pennsylvania State Com

a place In the Pocono Mountains where consump

he says. "I was able to send to Reslca a man re

Fooling Diamond Expert-.— "l am convinced that
few people know anything about diamonds., no mat
ter how much th>'y may pose as experts," said :i
young business man yesterday. "A recent experi
ence of mln<- has forced me to this conclusion. I
bought, as a Christmas present for my wife, a
brooch containing a cluster of diamonds, and took
occasion to show it to several of my friends at the.
club. They examined it very closely, looked wise,
and then started to show me where my judgment
had been at fault. Every man in the crowd seemorl
to be a diamond expert. By the time they had got
through I really felt as though I had been buncoed,
and was considerably depressed. Next day I got
to thinking the matter all over, and came to the
conclusion that my friends had been talking of
something they knew nothing about. At any rate.
I determined to make a test. I went to one of
those imitation diamond stores, and tor 50 cents
bought a brooch, which I plact si in the box that
hart formerly contained the real one. Again I went
to the club, and announced to my critical friends
that I had taken th.tr collective advice, anrt by
paying an extra $50 had exchanged the. brooch in
which they had picked so many flaws. They all
agreed that the 50 cent bauble which I showed
them was a great improvement over the other, and
when I tolcl them of the trick I had played on
them they wouldn't believe me. To a man they
contended that they couldn't be fooled on dia
monds. Now I feel better Batlsfled with my pur
chase.—(Philadelphia Record.
A young Philadelphia man gave a Klondike din
ner the other evening. The dining room was ar
ranged with canopies of rough canvas to give the
appearance of a tent. The table was of rough hewn
boards, and there was no covering. A tin plate
was at each place, and the plates were flanked by
knives, forks and spoons of the cheapest variety.
All the guests were invited to come in Klondike
costume. The men wore flannel shirts, and the
women were dressed as suited their individual
tastes. The butler who served the dinner wore
high boots, and slapped the food down at each
place in true miner spirit. Nothing but beer was
served to drink, and as there were no glasses the
efforts of the guests to drink from the bottles
were weird in the extreme.

This has been a week of debuts. Each day has
witnessed the presentation of several young girls
to society. Two more, bolder than the rest, se

Poor was introduced at a dinner dance given by her
parents, at their .house in Lexington-ave., Miss
Elsie Waterbury made her debut at a theatre party
which was followed by a supper and dance at
Sherry's.
The same sobriety with regard to floral decora
tions which characterized the ball given by Will
lam C. Whitney on Tuesday last, was noticeable
last night at the dinner dance of Mrs. Poor, whose
house, formerly occupied by Cyrus W. Field, is so
full of art treasures and so beautiful in its decora
tions that the customary display of flowers would
have been superfluous. Dinner was served at small
tables, the guests being fifty in number, consisting
chiefly of young people, friends of the debutante.
