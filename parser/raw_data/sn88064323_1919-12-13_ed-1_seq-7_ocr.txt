I WILSON'S MESSAGE
READ TO CONGRESS
LABOR UNREST AND HIGH
CCST OF LIVING IS
DISCUSSED.
General Recommendation for
Return of the United States
To Peace Basis.

The president asked for new tariff
laws based on the nation's changed
relation to the rest of the world, sug
Rested that the income and
M ashington.— A diversified program
to restore a peace time business stat
us, revise the tax system, curb un
rest, reduce the cost of living ami rec
Mt> labor and farming conditions, was
recommended by President Wilson
I uesday in his message
session of congress.
... , ----- excess
prolits tax schedules he simplified,
advocated steps to improve rural con
ditions and promote production, and
declared lor a "genuine democratiza
tion ot industry" to protect both la
bor and capital.
I be presidents principal reconimen
dations were:
Kstablishment of a budget system
for the national finances
Reozkunwauon in tue taxation ays
tern, u mi simplification of the income
and excess proiiis.
Readjustment ol the tarifl system,
it necessary, to meet changea worm
conditions and make the s^sicu- eon
loiiu wnil the tact that the tTilted
States is "tiie greatest capitalist in the
world.'
Recognition and relief tor veteran
soldiers of the w orld war, particularly
in the way of government. I arms, as
proposed by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dye
stuffs industry built up during the war
lo keep the Cnited «States independent
of foreign supply.
\n enlarged program for rural de
velopment, in recognition of the farm
ers' part in the war.
Measures which "will remove the
causes of political restlessness in our
body politic."
At this point the president made his
most extensive reference to the peace
treaty by saying the causes for the
unrest "are superficial rather than
deep-seated," and that' they "arise
from or are connected with the failure
on the part of our government to ar
rive speedily at a juat and permanent
peace, permitting return to normal con
ditions, from the transfusion of radical
j theories from seething European cen
ters pending such delay from heartless
profiteering, resulting from the in
crease of the cost of living, and lastly
from the machinations of passionate
and malevolent agitators.
With the return to normal conditions
this unrest will rapidly disappear.
Several recommendations, some re
newals of previous ones, were made
by the president to bring down the
cost of living. Among them were ex
tension of the food control law to peace
times for the emergency; regulations
for transportation of foods in inter
state commerce; a coal storage law
modeled after the law In New Jersey;
a law requiring markets to show the
lencth of time foods are kept in stor
age. and a law to secure "competitive
selling and prevent unconscionable
profits" by »federal license of corpora
tions selling food in Interstate com
merce!
Clerks Read Message.
For the second time only since the
president established the practice of
addressing congress In person his mes
sage was read today by the clerks.
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
"I sincerely regret that I can not be
present at'the opening of this session
of the congress. I am thfls prevented
from presenting in as direct a way as I
could wish the many questions that
are pressing for solution at this time.
Happily. 1 have had the advantage of
the advice of the heads of several
executive departments who have kept
In close touch with affaira in their
detail, and whose thoughtful recom
mendations I earnestly second.
"In the matter of the railroads and
the readjustment of their affairs grow
nig out of federal control I shall take
the liberty of a later date of address
ing you.
"1 hope that congress will bring to
a conclusion, at this session, legisla
tion looking to the establishment of
a budget system. That there should
he one single authority responsible for
the making of all appropriations, and
that appropriations should he made
not independently of each other, but
with reference to one single compre
hensive plan of expenditure proper
ly related to the nation's income, there
can be no doubt. I believe the bur
den of preparing the budget must, in
the nature of the case, if the work is
to be pffbperly done and responsibility
concentrated instead of divided, rest
jupon the executive. The budget so
prepared should he submitted to and
approved or amended by a single com
mit tee of each house of congress and
no single appropriation
should be

very practicable solution resisting

8< Idlers. I can do no better than
quote from my last message urging
this very action: "We must see to

the places for which they are fitted In
the daily work of the country. This
can be done by developing and main
taining upon an adequate scale the ad
mirable organization created by the
department of labor for placing men
seeking work and it can also lie done
In at least one very great field by cre
ating new opportunities for iiidiivdunl
enterprise.
"The secretary of the interior has
pointed out the way by which return

jilans shall receive immediate and sub
stanlial support of congress.
"No one who has observed the
march of events of the last year can
fail to note the absolute need of a
definite program to bring about an
improvement in the condition of la
bor. There can be no settled condi
tions leading to increased production
and a reduction in the cost of living if
labor and capital are to be antago
nlstic instead of partners. Sound
thinking and an honest desire to serve
the interests of the whole nation as
distinguished from the interests of a
class must/ be applied to the solution
of this great and pressing problem.
The failure of other nations to consid
er this matter in a vigorous way has
produced bitterness and jealousies and
antagonisms, the food of radicalism.
The only way to keep men from agi
tatlng against grievances is to remove
the grievances. An unwillingness
even today to discuss these matters
produces only dissatisfaction and gives
comfort to the extreme elements in |
our country which endeavor to stir up $
disturbances in order to provoke gov- j
erninents to embark upon a course of ;
retaliation and repression. The sqed
of revolution is repression. The rem- j
edy for these thingR must not be nega- j
tlve in character. It must, be con
structive. it must comprehend the
not suppression, hut a deep considéra- !
tion of the wrongs that beset our na
tionàl life and the application of
remedy.
"Congress has already shown its will
ingness to deal with these industrial
wrongs by establishing the eight-hour
day as the atandard in every Held of
labor. It haa sought to find a way to
prevent child labor. It has served the
whole country by leading the way in
developing the means of preserving
and safeguarding the lives and health
in dangerous industries. It must now
help in the difficult task of finding a
method that will bring about a genu
ine democratization of industry, based
upon the full recognition of the right
of those who work in every rank to
participate in some organic way in
eVery decision which directly affects
their welfare. It ia with this pur
pose in mind that I called a confer
ence to meet in Washington on Decern
ber 1 to consider these problems in
all their broad aspects, with the idea
of bringing about a better understand
ing between these two interest*.
"This is the hour of test and trial
for America. By her prowess and
strength and the indomitable courage
of her «soldiers she demonstrated her
power to vindicate on foreign battle
fields her conceptions of liberty and
justice. Let not her influence as a
mediator between capital and labor be
weakened and her own failure to set
tle matters of purely domestic concern
be proclaimed to the world.
"There are those in this country who
threaten direct action to force their
will upon a majority.
"Russia today, with its blood and
terror, is a painful object lesson of the
power of minorities. It makes little
difference what minority it is; wheth
•r capital or labor, or any other class;
no sort of privilege will ever be per
mitted to dominate this country. We
are a partnership or nothing that is
worth while. We are a democracy,
where the majority are the masters,
or all the hopes and purposes of the
men who founded this government
have been defeated and forgotten.
"in America there is but one way
by which great reforms can he ac
complished and the relief sought by
classes obtained, and that is through
the orderly processes of representative
government. Those who would pro
pose any other method 6f reform are
enemies of the country. America will
not be daunted by threat* nor lose her
composure or calmness In these dis
tressing times. We can afford in the
midst of this day of passion and unrast
to be self-contained and sure The in
strument of all reform in America is
the ballot. The road to economic and
social reform in America is the
straight road of justice to all clasaas
and conditions of men.
Men have had to follow this road to
realize the full fruition of their objects
and" purposes. Let those beware who
would take the shorter road of dis
order and revolution. The right road
is the road of justice and orderly
process.

It is naught but an old-folk tale, but
It bns truth hidden at its heart, for a
strange, subtle force, a spirit of gen

seem to animate child and man alike
when the world pays its tribute to the
''heaven-sent youngling." as the poet,
Drummond, calls the infant Christ.
When the three wise men rode from
the east into the west on their sad
die-bows wer" three caskets filled with
g< td and frankincense and infrrh, to

ning with this old. old Journey the
spirit of giving crept into the world's
heart. As the magi came bearing
gifts, so do we also; gifts that re
Here want, gifts that are sweet and
fragrant with friendship, gifts that
breathe love, gifts that mean service,
gifts inspired still bv the star that
shone over the City of David 2,000
years ago.
Then hang the green coronet of tlie*

TO TRIM A CHRISTMAS TREE
Pretty Trimmings and Decorations
Can Be Made in Almost Any Home
at Slight Expense.
As to trimming the Christmas tree,
first of all, don't trim your tree with
cotton batting and lighted candles, as
there is always danger In this combi
nation, and "safety first" should be the
slognn in all Christmas festivities.
You can purchase a whole lot of
pretty decorations for your tree at the
shops, and these come very cheaply,
too. But almost any home can furnish
the decorations for a really lovely tree
without very much expense, and there
Is no reason why every family where
there are children should not have
their Christmas tree.
Strings of popcorn and red cran
berries looped from the branches
make an effective decoration. And
strings of yellow field corn gleam beau
tifully In the Christmas light. Cres
cents, stars and hearts cut from heavy
cardboard and covered with silver and
gilt, or even colored paper, and cornu
copias of bright colors filled with
candy and popcorn are very pretty,
Form cotton batting into balls the size
pf qn orange and cover with orange
, ^ )C twist tightly an^
«• » «« v - ,,h -'<,rr m ,
fo° n - These are pretty on the tree am
look like oranges.
It is best to place all the larger
packages under the tree, tying only
the smnller gifts which are tied up In
bright-colored paper to the branches.
In this way the tree will not look
frayed and denuded when the gifts are
distributed, and it may be kept a long
time for the children to enjoy.
CHRISTMAS BELLS
By Lizzie Clark Hardy.
Oh, Christmas belle! Sweet Christmas
bells!
What Joyful memories you brlnx
Of ahepherds watching on the plain.
Of ungel hosts—a glittering train—
Who bear to earth from heaven above
Sweet messages of peace and love.
While all the stars together Bing
An anthem unto Christ our King.
To all the world thy chiming tells
Glad tidings of great Joy, O bells!
Oh, Christmas bells! Sweet Christmas
bells!
Far. far to eastward gleams a star;
Fair and serene it lights the way
O'er desert plains—a heavenly ray—
As unto Him the wise men bear
Their gifts of gold and treasure rare.
And incense sweet, from lands afar;
While from the gates of heaven ajar,
O'er all the earth the music swells
Of sweet, celestial Christmas bells.
Oh, Christmas bells! Sweet Christmas
bells!
As on the air your music swells.
On this the Joyful Christmastlde
The gates of heaven swing open wide.
And angel hosts with mortals sing
All glory unto Christ our King.
Peace, peace on earth, good will to men,
Pea! forth the Joyful strain again;
While peaivn and Joy and gladness wells
In all our hearts. O Christmas bells!
USt OF EVERGREENS.
The use of evergreens at Christmas
tithe is older than the Christmas tree,
the Christians seeming to have copied
It from their pagan ancestors. In a
very old book we find this reference to
the use of evergreens at Christmas
time; "Against the feast of Christ
mas every man's house, as also their
parish churches, were decked with
holme. Ivy. bayes, and whatsoever the
season of the year afforded to be
green. The conduits and standards of
the streets « ere likewise garnished ;
among which I rend that In the j
year 1414. by tempest of thunder and
lightning, toward the morning of Can- j
dbunas day, at the Leadenhall, In
Cornhlll, a standard of tree, being set
up in the midst of the pavement, fast
i n the ground, nailed full of holme and
ivy, for disport of Christmas to the i
people, was torn up and cast down by
the malignant spirit (as wns thought), j
and the stones of the pavement all :
about were cast in the streets and into j
divers houses, so that the people were {
sore aghast at the great tempest." j

LESSON OF CHRISTMAS DAY
Example of Christ Should Inspire Un
selfishness and Make Us Try to
Remedy Faults.
Christinas should Inspire a world of
unselfishness. The example before us ;
Is almost too perfect, for it rather
frightens us to attempt such divine
heights of self-abnegation, hut we can
try. It will at least take us from the
depths of selfishness, where most of us 1
now are. Fach Christmas day should
tench ns something of the lesson of
the Holy Child's life.
If we could learn from Christmas,
today and in the succeeding years the
serious lessons of self-betterment and '
ennoblement it has to offer, how in- j
finitely better It woultl he than just
to look on.lt as a holiday for gifts and
feasts, for extravagance anti foolish- j
uess.
So take «in hour or two off on
Christmas day and give It up to retro
spective and self-inspection. You will
each find faults, if you judge yourself
Impartially, for no one Is perfect. Then
make n serioys determination to try
to overcome those fntilts, for only try
ing to improve is there any growth In
character. If you are satisfied with
yourself you stay just as you are with
all your faults and virtues. But if
you try hard to remedy the fnults your
character Is constantly'growing broad
er. This is the lesson which Christ
mas day has for each of you.

weak, dizzy, suffer from sleeplessness,
or have pains in the back, wtlke up at
once. Your kidneys need help. These nr«>
signs to warn you that your kidneys
are not performing their functions
properly. Tlmy are only half doing
their work and are allowing impurities
to accumulate and be converted into
