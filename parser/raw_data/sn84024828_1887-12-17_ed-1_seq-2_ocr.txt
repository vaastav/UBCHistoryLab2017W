fcecretary Lamar of tho Interior De
partment in his report toCongresV has
tho following to say about the Territories
In all otthe Terrftoriesjhere has been
a considerable increaso during thoyear in
population and in wealth In Arizona
and New Mexico the native population
and that of Spanish extraction has not
pout ten years while during that period
the total population of New Mexico has
increased about 20 per cent and that of
Arizona more than 100 per cent The
prwjnt population of tho Territories is
estimated respectively as follows Ari
zona 90000 Dakota 508400 Idaho
97250 Montana 130000 New Mexico
101000 Utah 105500 Washington
142301 Wiomfnir 85000 Alaska 1ms n
iwnulation of 6800 whites 5800 civilized
native and 20800 natives not civilized
Tho most marked featnre In tho recent
agricultural development of tho Terri
torics is the discover of the astonishing
fertility of largo areas heretofore suppos
ed to lc arid or desert lands valuable only
fnr grazing purposes Garden farms in
Arizona and New Mexico yield rich semi
tropieal products in profusion and orch
ards in Utah and Idaho furnish a great
variety of fmitH of such ecellent quality
that extensive shipment are already
made to the eastward and the highest
prices obtained
The rapid agricultural development
as well as the heavy losses in tho northern
Territories from the unusual severity of
last winter together with the low prices
prevalent during tho year have some
what checked the progress of the cattle
industry po far as it is carried on upon
largo ranches but great advances in other
important branches of stock raising have
rnoro than counterbalanced this depres
sion
The yearly product in precious metals
of Arizona is estimated at 6103878 of
New Mexico In gold and silver

fJaffrd States Grant Jury Beprt
The following is the report of the U S
Grand Jury which completed its session
in Prescott this week l
PBBScoTf Dec 12 1887
To tha Hon James H Wright Judge of
the Third Judicial District Territory of
Arizona
We the United States Grand Jury for
the November term 1887 beg leave to
make this our final report and Tequest
that We be discharged
We have examined all charges brought
before us and find indictments as follows
Perjury 2 Summation of Perjury 1
Selling whisky to Indiansrl Polygamy
1 Adultery 2 -
We feel satisfied that many cases exist
where parries have unlawfully cut and re
moved timber from Government land
and illegally ontered and taken up Gov
ernmenHand and while we would have
been glad to investigate such cases we
have not bad tho proper evidence laid
before us We would most respectfully
request that the proper government offi
cials look fully into these matters and
when cases aro found to have tho evi
dence and w itnesscs ready for cxamina
tion and investigation by the next U S
Grand Jury if possible the Investigation
to t over all parts of this District
The attention of the Grand Jury has
heeti called to the fact that certain coun
ties of this Territory have seemingly dis
regarded an Act of Congress passed for
the purpose of chocking extravagance in
the administration of county affairs in
the Territories and usually known and
tcrmod the Harrison Act It Is assert
ed that the counties referred to have
within tho past year issued evidences of
indebtedness in excess of the limit pre
scribed In and by said Act in violation
of law
We would therefore recommend thaj
tjie U S Attorney make such n investi
gation into tho affairs of the different
counties as will determine the truth or
falsity of such assertions and if found as
represented present thn same with proper
witnesses to tho next U B Grand Jury
for their consideration that tho responsi
bility may be fixed and the guilty parties
punished accordingly
