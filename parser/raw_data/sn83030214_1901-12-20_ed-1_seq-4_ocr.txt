MURPHY'S POWER IN DANGER.
%t BATTERY DAN" FIXX WOULD WREST THE LEADERSHIP
OF THE FIRST FROM THE POLICE CHIEF.
TAMMAXYS FINAL ATTACKS ON THE CITY TREASURY
Yesterday was a day not without developments in the local political
field. * r ,
It was learned that "Battery Dan" Finn was planning a fight to wrest
the Tammany leadership of the Ist Assembly District from Police Commis
sioner Murphy.
Tammany schemes for spending city money were exposed. Con
troller-elect Grout gave his reasons for opposing the street improvement
scheme in The Bronx, which was "jammed through" the Board of Public
Improvements on Wednesday.

SIONER FROM FIRST DISTRICT
LEADERSHIP.
A Mtter nerhT ha? been started in the I?t As

Poll'-* ComttisFloner Michael 0. Murphy, for Ah"
rnntr <if th*' diPtrirt at the primaries next
year F"inn I? determined to wrest the leader
ship of th» district from Colonel Murphy, and he
ha? planned n'? "ah' at a time when th» latter
■will not ':•■ abb> to bring^ the argument of pat
ronat* •■' boar on th<» rppult. There has been
an old gru<sc° between Finn and Murphy for
yeaiF. -:-•: Finn nan been restive under the lead
ership of the Police Commissioner.
T!.' patronage ff the district, which Murphy
ways si '• to sv.-'re. has been given to particular
friends of Murphy. an<l the friends of Finn have
been left nut of the count altogether. The
Meads of Finn say that Colonel Murphy has
had j;i.« day. and that one rood fipht will finish
him ft* leader. Commissioner Murphy has spent
much of the time -for the last few year? at hi?
rummer home in Far Rockatvay. and Finn has
of late been using this as an argument against
Mao.
The two factions have taken side? in the Con
gress district fisrlit in which a successor to Nich
olas Moll .'. of Ptaten Island, will be elected.
jUI of the Ist Assembly District is in the old
Vllth Conpreps District, and Finn, in order to
make things unpleasant for Murphy, has de
rided to purport Perry Belmont. Murphy has
not declared openly for any one, but he has
said he was agrainFt a "carpet bag candidate,"
such as Mr. Belm at. Finn cares little for the
carp- i bag; issue either one way or the other, but
he is against Murphy, and if Mr. Belmont cret<*
The nomination the followers of Finn Brill claim
th.> - -■ knockdown. It i? understood that
Murphy and hi* friends Kill be for Councilman
O'Grady. and they will be reinforced by the
delegates from Richmond whom O'Grady can
control.! Nicholas Muiler, the Democratic leader
of Richmond, counts on delivering the Richmond
deleeaticr. for Mr. Belmont. but in this he is
likely to fall short by at least a dozen delegates,
as OGrady is making a hustling fight for the
nomination. Councilman Ryder, leader of th?
Hid District, ana toward O'Grady in the fight
because he and OGrady have been close friends
in the Council, and Mr. O'Grady will be out of
office next year unless he is elected CongTess
man.
The convention will contain 2TS delegates— i.>s
from Richmond and 140 from New-York. Th»
district includes, besides Richmond County, the
entire Ist Assembly District of this county,
twelve districts of the I lid Assembly District.
and two of the lid Assembly District, where
Councilman. '-Tom" Foley is leader. Foley is
ea;d to be with the Belmont people. Croker
has taken Me hand? off in the fight, and it
seems to be an open fight between Mr. Belmont
■■4 Mr. O'Grady for the lelegatea. Finn says
that no matter how the Congress contest goes
he is out to retire Commissioner Murphy, and
there are plenty of Tammany men in the dis
trict who predict that he will succeed.

TAMMANY'S LAST REVEL
i RAISING SALARIES AND PLANNING BIG
EXPENDITURES-GROTTT ON THE
BRONX MAP.
In The closing days of the Tammany admin
! istration there Is an apparent effort to load the
1 incoming administration as heavily as possible
with increased salaries for city employes and
i with plans for Improvements to cost millions^
I The courts rtepped in and prevented the award
! of several costly contract? for asphalt pave
■ ments which had been advertised by James P.
I Keating, the Commissioner of Highways, and
! one Tammany scheme was set at naught. Th.'
Board of Public Improvements, which goes out
; of existence at the e^id of the year, and there
fore cannot be expected to do much damage
in the few remaining days of its life, took ac
tion on Wednesday calculated to burden the
city with enormous expense, but that action
may have no serious effect, because the next
administration will not be bound by it.
The plan of Bridge Commissioner Shea.to have
Delancey-st. widened to 125 feet all the way
from the approach of the New East River bridge
to the Bowery; to have an additional street cut
through to Elm-st.. and to have a plaza at the
subway station at Spring and Elm sts.. would
mean the outlay of millions of dollars, but the
approval of the plan by the Board of Estimate
and Apportionment would be needed before the
city could be committed to the plan. The ap
proval of Mr. Shea's plan by the Beard of Pub
lic Improvements on Wednesday will serve,
therefore, merely as an indication of what the
Tammany politicians might have done if they
had remained in power. Controller Coler and
two other members of the Board of Estimate
and Apportionment will not permit the ratifica
tion of Mr. Shea's plan for widening Elm-st.
Corporation Counsel Whalen said yesterday
that while he did not know the merits of the
plan for widening Delancey-st.. he thought such
an Improvement, involving great cost, should be
left for the next administration to deal with.
"That is a matter." he said, "that probably will
not come before the Board of Estimate and Ap
portionment until next year, anyhow. As a
member of the present board, I would not favor
passing upon the plan."
ADVANCING SALARIES FREELT,
Mr. Whalen and Mr. Shea have made In
creases In salaries In their departments, appar
ently wishing to reward certain employes with
promotions. Fifteen of the clerk* and office boys
in Mr. Whalen's office have had their sal
aries raised on the promotion plan. Office
boys were promoted to junior clerks and
junior clerks were promoted to
clerks. The increases of ealnries rantred from
1290 tc ?700. and the total increase -.vould
amount to (<USfO it the clerks were to ren
office a year. Mr. Whalen said yesterday that
the promotions and Increases in salaries were
made in conformity with Civil Service rules and
v.<-).- expected to be permanent, but Mr. Rives,
when he becomes Corporation Counsel, may
thir.k there are too many clerks in the office an^
discharge some of them.
Mr. Shea has increased the salaries of hiif a
dozen employes in the Department of Bridges.
The increase? rangre from (100 a year to five
tirrcc that amount.
Controller-elect Grout, who opposed the new
map for Th» Bronx before the Board of Public
Improvements on Wednesday, yesterday pave a
Tribune reporter a statement of his views on
the subject. In the course of his talk Mr. Grout
criticised Eorouph President Haif^n's attitude
in the matter. "Mr. Haffen oug-ht to reflect
whether it Is wise." sa;d Mr. Grout, "to have
his ear so close to the «rround that he lets his
constituents walk all ever him "
Mr. Grout outlined his own view? upon the
subject in the following: statement:
I appreciate the desire of the people of Th«
BrOnx to have some map adopted. I appreciate,
alto, the need of it practically, but I think the
best rule in such matters is tn be sure, you ar<;
right first and then po ahead. And I am very
doubtful whether these maps which have been
jammed through are right. The whole question
is whether or not^the maps provide for more
wide streets and public places than are. needed
or than either the city of New- York or the
borough of The Bronx ran afford to pay for.
CRITICISES HAFEX.
"Individually most of the members of the
Board of Public Improvements are convinced
that the maps do contain an excess of such
streets and places. But, like Mr. Haffen, who
himself thinks so, too, and ha? repeatedly said
so. they were not willing: to stand up before the
crowd which demanded action in favor of the
maps, whether it was right Or wronp. Mr. Haf
fen himself thinks the maps are wrong in this
respect, and he defies his own conscience and
judgment rather than resist the demands of his
constituents.
"The Board of Public Improvements has done
likewise, and yet it has constantly been beset
with a demand that the city should foot the ex
pense of opening and Improving every street
which exceeds sixty feet in width— an expense
which, if these new maps for The Bronx were
adopted, would run up to many millions of dol
lars.
"It is a fallacy and a delusion to say that the
adoption of these maps causes no expense, for
while their mere adoption does not. it lays the
foundation for a system which makes the ex
pense to the city at large inevitable
"If these maps are adhered to the city will be
financially unable to contribute to the assess
ments for wide streets, as it has done in the
past, and I venture to predict in such an event
that the people of The Bronx will themselves
ask to have some of them narrow rather than
pay for them. Understand. I am not against a
proper number of wide streets or of public
parks, but I believe it possible to have too much
of a pood thing, unless, of course, you get some
one else to pay for it. To have a street one
hundred feet wide every ten blocks is, in mv
Judgement, to have twice as many as the dis
trict north of The Bronx River will ever need "
Mr. Grout read a statement that the people
of The Bronx felt that they were entitled to th«
outlay the new maps provide, since Brooklyn
was to get $SO,OOO 000 In new bridges.
Mr. Grout said in reply:
"This is not a geographical question. I am
not influenced by that fact. I would oppose them
just as vigorously if they were for Brooklyn I
believe each borough should have all necessary
r-2£rintlonr -2£r intlon which th clty can give it but i,
$BO.uOO.CKK} is necessary for bridges, that is no
reason for the unnecessary expenditure of i
single dollar. People ought not To look on such
a question as if the various boroughs were en
gaged in cutting up a big: watermelon."

JEROME NOT TO PF.riDE ABOUT RESIGNING
UNTIL NOON. JANUARY 1.
For the purpose of preventing Mayor Van
Wyck from having any legral grounds for ap
pointing a successor to him as justice of the
Court of Special Sessiona, Justice Jerome has
studiously refrained from tellinp any one that
hp contemplated resigning: the office. As a legal
proposition, it was said yesterday, the Mayor
has no right to assume that Mr. Jerome is going
to resign his Judgefhip until he has been In
formed by Justice Jerome. When asked about
his intention yesterday Justice J>rome naively
said:
I haven't decided to resign as justice of the Court
of Special Sessions. My certificate of election as
District Attorney has not been presented to me.
and. even if it had been, that would be no con
clusive proof that 1 expect to resign my .present
office Mv certificate of election will be placed in
escrow as soon as I get it. In fact. I shall not con
eider the question of resigning my Pr«sem Position
until 12 o'clock noon on January l- After that 1 our
it is possible— l only concede that It is a possibility
-that if certain esteemed friends of mine prominent
in the fusion movement should press upon my at
tention the necessity of resigning ray jud?eship n
order to become District Attorney— lf they should
bring powerful arguments to the front at that time,
I am free to confess that I may. seriously consider
the propriety of resigning as justice. ntll the
clock strikes 12 noon on January 1. however. I
shall not resign my judgeship.
After saying this Mr. Jerome smiled in a sug
gestive way. Lawyers consider that Justice
Jerome's plan disposes of any legal quibble that
Mayor Van Wyck Wnight take advantage of to
appoint a Special Sessions justice between the
hours of midnight on December 31 and noon on
January 1.
NEW SHERIFF TO MAKE CLEAN SWEEP.
JOHN .7. ADAMS BECOMES HIS COUNSEL
THOMAS SULLIVAN MAT BE
UNDER SHERIFF.
Sheriff-elect William J. O'Brien yesterday had a
conference with John C. Bheehan and William Hep
burn Russell, after which it was announced by
friends of Mr. O'Brien that he had decided to make
a clean sweep of the Tammany men In the Sheriff's
office as far as the Civil Service laws would permit.
The new Sheriff announced the appointment of
John J. Adams as Sheriffs counsel.
Mr. Adams has been a member of Tammany
Ha;! for a number of years, but this Is his first
punlic place. He lives at No 114 West Seven!
fourth-?!., and has offices at NO. 25 Broai-st. Mr
Adams will succeed Philip J. Brltt, and his salary
will be $6. 980 a year.
Mr. O'Brien will not retire all the old force im
mediately upon taking oSice, but will weed them
out as fast as he can do so without interfering
with the safe transaction of business. Among
those who will go, It is said, are Under Sheriff
Harry p. Mulvar.ey. who has been in the Sheriff's
office for twenty-seven years, and Warden Plckctt
of Ludlow Street Jail. The warden was until a
ytar or two ago a police captain, and draws half
pay from the Police Pension Fund, In addition to his
salary of $3,000 as warden. The friends of the for
mer captain are bringing considerable pressure to
bear upon Mr. O'Brien to induce him to allow l!: "
warden to retain his office. Mr. O'Brien has made
no announcement as to his new staff. It is under
stood that Thomas Sullivan, who was for ■ out of
the Sheriff's orMce three years ago because he
would not desert John C. Sherhan. will be made
tinder Sheriff, at a salary of $3,000 a year. No one
knows who will pet Wardtn i'irk< It's place. Sheriff
O'Brien will have twelve fier.mi. « to arrant «'
$2 y/> apiece. One or two of these places may be
filled by Republicans. There are twelve assistant
deputiea at jl.ooo . piece, i.t.i! several clerks an.l at
tendant?. These also are not in the classified
service.
The pressure upon Messrs. Bbeehan and Russell
by the office seekers is som« thine extraordinary.
Mr. Sheehan has not hern able to give much at
tention to his contracUng business since Election
Day. Now that the tirr>e is co close at hand for the
filling of the places, there is a lively scramble to
get in out of the political cold.

OPEN SALOONS FOR A YEAR
.IT-STICK JEROME MAY FAVOR AN EX
PERIMENTAL T,AW-HIS REASONS*.
In view of the growing opposition to his •«
vocacy of a Sunday opening law. Justice Jerome
may ask the legislature to pass a bill emboa>
ine some of the views he has advocated merely
"as an experiment, with the understanding that
If at the end of twelve months the plan is a
manifest failure the next legislature shall
amend or abrogate th» experimental law. Yes
terday, in answer to a question. Mr. Jerome
said:
"I believe that twelve months would suffice
for a practical and fairly thorough trial of a
Sunday opening law."
"S6 that If it were fatally defective in practice
it could be abrogated?" he was asked.
"Yes." said he. 'but it would have to be hon
estly tried. To go at it in any half-hearted
manner would not be fair to those who desire a
change in the existing situation. I think that a
twelve months' trial would demonstrate the wis
dom of the proposed new law."
In his speech in Rochester Tuesday nlghr
Justice Jerome advocated the opening of saloons
on Sundays from 1 to 11 p. m. He was asked
yesterday why he did not propose to leave the
saloons open all day Sunday.
"That Is a small view to take of the question,"
replied Mr. Jerome. "The present law cannot
be enforced because the people are oppose,] to it.
They don't want it enforced. As it stands now
it is attended by necessary evils, and these evils
should he minimized as much as possible. The
question is. How should It be done? By allow
ing the saloons to remain open from I to 11
o'clock you can enforce the law with an honest
police administration, and the saloonkeeper will
assist in its enforcement. Through this chnnge
the people will have respect for the law. where
now they have contempt for it. and it has be
come a farce. You cannot enforce a law which
is not consonant with the wishes of so large a
number of people. What is the use of continu
ing a law with its inseparable evils?"
"Do you personally wish to see the saloon*
open on Sunday?" the justice was asked.
"I do not." he replied. "Bo far as I am per
sonally concerned I would prefer to see them all
closed tight. But that is not the thing. We
must try to do the best we can for the people,
and sink our own personal feelings for the good
of the entire community."
"Will a bill embodying your views on needed
changes in the liquor laws be ready for intro
duction at the opening or tht legislature?"' he
was asked.
"I think to," said Mr. Jerome. "1 would like
to say that in this whole matter I am trying to
bring about amelioration of conditions at pres
ent confessedly bad. and in doing that I am
merely trying to qualify on the pledges I mad*
in the campaign. If 1 an 'thrown down' on it.
all right. There is a limit to physical strength
and to the hours of the day. Whatever may be
the result, I am certain of one thing, and that is
that the advocacy of change* in the existing
laws has quickened public interest in the sub
ject, and whether much or little comes out of it.
it i? certain that the matter will be more se
riously studied than heretofore.' It seems to me
that it is not so much a question of what would
be the ideally perfect thing to do as it is one of
what can be brought about. I have no doubt
that if the man living in « two or three room
flat in this city would do the proper thing when
the thermometer is above 90 on a summer Sun
day afternoon he would go to some cool spot, if
he could find one, and pernaos read 'Plutarch's
Lives," or .'■■■• equally serious book; bui the
fact of the matter is. he won't do that. He be
lieves that a drink of cool beer Is what he
n^eds. and be supplies the need If he can. If.
instead rj doing this, he could hring himself to
think th.* he at.-i his family «r< aid be better ofT
looking at a menagerie or visiting one of th"
Carnegie free !it.rart««. as I said before, he
would be better off. Whatever Is done, it should
rot bo forgotten that the primary duty of en
forcing the law devolves upon the Chief of Po
lice and the Commissioner and Mayor. Th" Dis
trict Attorney's duty is secondary. It would not
be a dereliction on the part of the District A»
ton -v If he allowed every saloon m the ci y to
violate the law on Sunday. It I- the business
of th« Pinrtct Attorney to hrintr about a-- in

OTHERS DISPLEASED. BY HIS SPEECH
ADVOCATING OPHN BALOONS.
[BT inr'n\rn TO tiik TWllXi-l
Rochester. N. V. Dec. 19.— "The Post-Express"
tola fternoon publi«he« the viewa of many promi
nent mlnlfters and business men Of this city on
the solution of the Sunday saloon question ay pre
sented by Justice William Travel* Jerome in his
Chamber of Commerce speech her** last Tuesday
night. Opinion is pretty evenly divided, but the
general interest In the rnntfr Is widespread
A special meeting h.is been called for Sunday af
ternoon by Justice Jerome's opponent* to protest
ncninst Sunday opening in any form. The meeting
will be under the auspices of the more extreme tem
perance leader . The subject will form the theme of
many sermons on Sunday. It is Interesting and
significant to observe that most of the men who
favor Justice Jerome's plan are more or less fa
miliar with conditions lr New-York City.
The Rev. Murray Bartlett, rector of St. Paul's
Protestant Episcopal Church, at one time engaged
In mission work on th» East Side In New-York,
said:
I believe that the saloons In New-York City
should OB closed all day on Sunday, if it is a pos
sible 'hltiK; but my experience in the metropolis
makes me feel that there Is much to be said in
favor of Justice Jerome's attitude, and it deserves
the sympathetic and careful consideration of the
legislature.
The Rev. Dr. Clarence A. Barbour. pastor of the
Lake Avenue Baptist Church and a leader of the
Good Government forces, said:
I presume that Justice Jerome by his speech
pleased the people in New- York Who want open
saloons on the first day of the week-. That, per
haps, was all that he hop»>fl to accomplish. So far
as putting such n law as ho proposes upon the
statute books. I think the chances of it are very
remote.
The Rev. Dr. S. - B. Nelson, of St. Peter's Presby
terian Church, who replied to Justice Jerome at
the Chamber of Commerce dinner, said:
Now Is th« hour to squelch this brazenly degen
erate plan to haul us back under the domination
in the worst thought and the worst citizenship. Mr.
Jerome will never earn the title of "Roosevelt II"
unless, like Theodore, he sets himself with all his
strength against public evils.
The Rev. Dr. Rob Roy Converse, rector of St.
Luke's Protestant Episcopal Church, said:
I believe that such a question cannot be decided
for a great community like New-York City in the
same way In which It might be decided for a small
er community. If the people of New-York City are
going 10 hold out for what they consider a question
of principle, regardless of the question of expedi
ency, 1 believe they -will have Tammany back again
and Low buried.
Deputy Excise Commissioner Milton Race ex
pressed himself as favorable to Justice Jerome's
plan.

RICH, BUT S TA R VED TO DBA 1 H
BANKBOOKS AND GOLD FOUND IN A j
p.vr; norxD with chain? un
der A MISER'S BED.
Although John Fitzp3triok. an old and ec- j
centric citizen of Croton Falls, was worth more ■
than .*2O.ooi>. vet he died from starvation and
neglect After he was buried in Massachusetts [
yesterday hi 3 bankbooks were found in an old ;
leather beg. which was bound with chain?. In a ;
hole in the floor under his bed. Both Mr. and |
Mrs. Fitzpatrick lived the lives of misers, th* :
neighbors My, and pretended that they were ;
penniless. !
Mrs. Fitzrr.trick died four months ago. and
after her death two bankbooks, each showing a
balance of $4,000, were found in an old •*•**-
ing hidden in the wall of their bedroom.
Mr. Fitzpatrick was seventy-two years Old.
and for years he was employed as a laborer on
the Harlem Railroad track? at $1 23 a day. The ;
last time he was seen alive was on last Satur- ;
day, when he vent into the Croton Falls Hotel j
in an emaciated condition and begged for a I
drink of whiskey. He said he had a bad cold I
and had no money to buy medicine. On Wednes- I
day Thomas Welch forced open a window, and '
found Fitzpatrick lying unconscious on his bed. :
There had apparently be en no fire in the hou.-e ,
for several days, and there was no food, except ,
a !i?.rd piece of bread. He died soon after n- j
was found. j
Fitzpatrick owned the cottage in which he ,
died. While his relatives were cleaning out hi« J
bedroom they round the bag. In it were seven '
bankbooks, showing deposits in New- York, Dan- ,
bury. Conn.; Brewsters. Peekskill, and other
place*, amounting to more than $14,000. Not a
rent of the money h^> 1 ever been withdrawn and
interest had not been collected on any of the |
deposits for more than ten years ;
Tied up !n old rags, abo.ut ?v-"? v -" in gold was ;
found, and II is expected more gold will be dl.*- ,
covered In the walls, as it has since been learned
that he hid all his wife's money. Two ?isteif .
of the dead man. who live in West Brookfield, .
Mass., will share their brother's estate. ;

i THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE -YORK POST
GRADUATE HOSIUTAL. SHOWS A
GOOD TEAR'S WORK.
: The seventeenth annual repoit of the NVw-YorK
i Post-Giftilunte Hospital, for the year ending Octo-
I her 1. 1901. has Just been is*u?d. ft shows tnat
i 2.005 free patients occupied beds la the hospital dur
; ing: the year, and that these received 33.191 days of
j free hospitPl .are. The number of flays of hospital
| care for both free and pay patients was 53,K)8.
I There were •".. '.71 microscopical, chemical and other
examinations made in the hospital laboratory last
year. "Great as is this number," says the re
: port, "it falls far she rt of the constant and press
| ing needs of the institution." An enlargement of
j laboratory space and an increase in the working
j force and in equipment are ask*d for. Six hundred
j doctors attended th a courses in the medical school
■■■: the institution.
The report also contains a brief account of the
! Margaret Kahnestock Training School for Nurse*,
which is a part of the medical school and hos
pital, and is opposite the' pon-srraduate school.
Foods for an indoor lying-in department are ur
gently needed.
Concerning the car» of consumptives, the report
says:
Many a patient's life could be saved and Ms
family rendered Safe from infection if he could
be sent early to a sanatorium or to 1 properly
equipped hospital. The disease is a. curable one
with proper surroundings, but It Is of all the dls
, en*** the most distressing and hopeless to treat
I In the homes of ...e poor. No money could be
better spent than in providing a ward for Its
treatment. The larger the ward the better, and
no matter how large, the district physician will
guarantee to nil it and keep it full
Contributions to any of the departments of the
I institution may be sent to Dr. Bach* Emmet, the
