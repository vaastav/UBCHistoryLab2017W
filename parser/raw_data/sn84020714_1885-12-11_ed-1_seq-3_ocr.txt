We repeat what we said a few
weeks ago, that Gov. Jarvis' recommenda
tion in his Message in Jauuary, 1885, that
ten cetits on the $100 valuation of pro
perty, was right, and that that sum was
sufficient for 1885. No more money
should be collected for interest on the
Bonded debt until it is actually needed.
Before the next meeting of the Legis
lature we shall call attention to the mat
ter of State finances.
Physicians throughout the coun

mothers will regret their violent exercise

Jr? It is certainly unkind and in bad
taste for the N. Y. Sun, and other papers
to ridicule ex-i resident Hayes for being
present at the funeral services of Vice-
President Heudricks. If Tilden and
Hendricks were cheated out of their
oilices in 1877, it is uo reason why there
should be an everlasting sneering at
Hayes, for he only did what every man
in the United States would have done ac

PRESIDENT'S' MESSAGE, x
, Thai me.Beagq -contains a lull and com
prehensive review of our foreign relations,
with many suggestions; recommends to
the consideration of Congress such meas
ures as the President deems necessary and
expedient. We here publish only a
synopsis. Of the Revenue the President
says:'- '
The Revenue. In a summary of the
Treasury exhibit it is shown that the
ordiuary receipts from all sources for the
fiscal year eudin June 50, 1885, were
$322,690,706.38. Of this sum $181,471,
939.34 was received from customs and
$112,408,725.54 from internal revenue.
The total receipts, as given above, were
$24,829,163.54 less than those for the year
ended June 30, 1884. This diminution
embraces the falling off of $13,595,550.42
in receipts from customs and $9,687,346.97
in receipts lrom internal revenue. The
total ordinary expenditures of the govern
ment for the fiscal year were $260,226,
935.50, leaving a surplus in the Treasury
at the close of the year of $63,463,771.27.
This is $40,929,854.32 less than the sur
plus reported at the close of the previous
year.
The fact that our resources are in ex
cess of the actual needs of an economical
administration of the government justifies
a reduction in the amount exacted from
the people for its support. Our govern
ment is but the means established by the
will of a free people, by which certain
principles are applied which they have
adopted for their benefit and protection,
and it is never better administered, and
its true spirit is never better administered,
than when the people's taxation lor its
support is ' scrupulously limited to the
actual necessity of expenditure, and dis
tributed according to a just and equitable
plan.
One proposition with which we have to
deal is a reduction of the revenue received
by the general government, and paid by
the people from custom duties. The ques
tion of free trade is not involved, nor is
there any occasion for a geueral discus
sion of the wisdom or expediency of a
protective system. Justice and fairness
dictate that in any modification of our
present laws relating to the revenue, the
industries aud interests which have been
encouraged by such laws, and in which
our citizens have large in vestments,should
not be ruthlessly l mured or destroyed.
We should also deal with the subject in
such a manner as to protect the iuterests
of American labor, which is the capital of
our workingmen. Its stability and proper
remuneration furnish the most justifiable
pretext for a protective policy.
Within these limitations a certain re
duction should ba made in our customs'
revenue. The amount of such reduction
having been determined, inquiry follows,
where can it best be remitted and what
articles can best be released from duty in
the interest of our citizens.
I think the reduction should be made in
the revenue derived from tax upon the
imported necessaries of life. We thus
directly lesson the cost of living in every
family in the land, and release to the peo
ple in every humble home a large measure
of the rewards of frugal industry.
National Banks. During the year end
ing November 1, 1S85, one hundred and
forty-nve national banks were organized,
with an aggregate capital of $16,938,000,
and circulating notes have been issued
to them, amounting to $4,274,910. The
whole number of these bauks in exis
tence on the day above mentioned, was
2,727.
The very limited amount of circulating
notes issued by our National banks com
pared with the amount the law permits
them to issue, upon deposit of bonds for
their redemption, indicates that the vol
ume of our circulating medium may be
largely increased through this instrumen
tality. .Nothing more important than the pres
ent condition of our currency and coinage
can claim your attention.
Silver Coinage. Since February, 1878,
the government has; under compulsory
provisions of the law, purchased silver bul
lion and coined the same at the rate of
more than two millions of dollars every
month. By this process up to the present
date $215,759,431 of silver dollars have
been coiued. .
A reasonable appreciation of the dele
gation of power to the general govern
ment would limit its exercise, without ex
press restrictive words, to the people's
needs and the requirements of the public
welfare. Upon this theory the authority
to "coin money given to Uongress by the
constitution, il it permits purchase by the
government of bullion for coinage in any
event, does not justify such purchase and
coinage to an extent beyond the amount
needed for sufficient circulating medium.
The desire to utilize the silver product of
the country should not lead to the misuse
or the perversion of this power. .
Necessity for such an addition to silver
currency ot the nation as it is compelled
by the silver coinage act, is negatived by
the fact that up to the present time only
about fifty millions of silver dollars so
coined have actually found their way into
circulation, leaving more than one bun
dred and sixty-five million in possession
of the government, the cnstody of which
has entailed considerable expense for the
construction of vaults tor its deposit.
Against this latter amount there are out
standing silver certificates amounting to
about ninety-three millions of dollars.
Every month two millions ot gold in
the public treasury are paid out for two
millions or more of silver dollars, to be
added to the idle mass already accumu
lated.
If continued long enough this operation
will result in the substitution of Bilver for
all the sold the government owns appli
I . m" . Y . 1
I cable to its rreneral purposes, it win not
do to relv upon the custom receipts of
I the erovernment to make eood this drain
I of erold. because of the silver thus coined
having been made a legal tender for all
1 1 "1 ! A ft
debts ana dues, public anu private,
times during the last six monms ao per
ceut. of the receipts for duties have been
in silver or silver certificates, while the
average within that period has been 20
per cent, ine proportion oi suver aim
its certificates received oy ine govern
ment will probably increase as times goes
on for the reason that the nearer the
period approaches when it will beobliged
to offer silver in payment of its obligations
thA irreAtor tlifi inducement will be to
hoard erold against the depreciation in the
value of silver or for the purpose of specu
lating. This hoarding of gold has already
begun
When the time comes that gold has
been withdrawn from circulation then
will be apparent the difference between
the real value of the silver dollar and the
dollar in gold, and the two coins will part
company, i Gold, the standard of value,
and necessary in our dealings with other
countrieswill tie at a premiumover sil
ver. Ihe banks which have substituted
gold lor the1 deposits of ! their Icustonaers
may pay them with silver bought with
such gold, thus making handsome profits.
iich speculators will sell their hoarded
gold to their neighbors who need jl to
iquidate their foreign debts, at a ruinous
premium over silver and the laboring men
and women of the land, the most7 defence-
ess of all, will find that the dollar received
for the wages of their toil has sadly
brunk in its purchasing power. It may
be said that the latter result will' be but
temporary and ' ultimately the price ol
abor will be adjusted to the change. - liut
even if this takes place the wage worker
cannot possibly gain, "but must inevitably
ose, since the price he is compelled to pay
for his living will not only be measured
in coin heavily depreciated and fluctuating
and uncertain in its value but this uncer
tainty . in the value of the I purchasing
medium will be made the pretext for an;
advance in piices beyond that justified by
the actual depreciation.
It "will 'not be disputed ' that any at
tempt on the part of the government to
cause the circulation ot silver dollars
worth eighty cents, Bide by side with gold
dollars worth one hundred cents, even
within the limit that legislation does not
run counter to laws of trade, to be suc
cessful must be seconded by the confi
dence of the people, that both coins will
retain the same purchasing power and be
interchangeable at will. A special effort
has been made by the Secretary of the
Treasury to increase the amount of our
silver coin in circulation, but the fact that
a large share of the limited amount thus
put out has Boon returned to the public
treasury in payment of duties, leads to the
belie! that the people do not now desire
to keep it, in hand. And this, with the
evident disposition to hoard gold, gives
rise to the suspicion that there already
exists a lack of confidence among the peo
ple, touching our hnaucial processes.
1 here is certainly not enough silver now
n circulation to cause uneasiness, and the
whole amount coined and now on hand
might, after a time, be absorbed by the
people without apprehension; but it is the
ceaseless stream that threatens to over
flow the land which causes fear and uncer
tainty. , ,
What has thus far been submitted upon
this subject relates almost entirely to oon
8ideration& of a home nature unconnected
with the bearing which the polices of
other nations have upon the question.
But it is perfectly, apparent that the line
of action - in regard to our currency can
not wjsely be settled upon or persisted in,
without considering the attitude on that
subject of other countries with whom we
maintain iutercouse through commerce,
trade and'travel.
The Monetary Conference. An ac
knowledgment of this fact is found in the
act by virtue of which our silver is com
pulsiorly coined. It provides that "the
President shall invite the governments of
countries composing the Latiu Union, so
called, and of such other European na
tions aa he may deem advisable, to join
the United btates in a conference to adopt
a common ration between gold and Bilver
for the purpose of establishing interna
tionally the use of bi-metallic money and
securing a fixity of the relative value be
tween these metals. .:-. .'
This conference absolutely failed and a
similar fate has awaited all subsequent
efforts in the same direction, and still we
continue our coinage of silver at a ratio
different from that of any other nation.
The most vital part of the silver coinage
act remains inoperative and unexecuted,
and without an any or friend, we battle
upon the silver field in an illogical and
osing contest.
To give full effect to the desire of Con
gress on this subject I have made careful
and earnest endeavors since the adjourn
ment of the last Congreps.- -
We have now on hand - all the silver
dollars necessary to supply the present
needs of the people and to satisfy those
who from sentiment wish to see them in
circulation, and if their coinage is sus
pended they can readily be obtained by
all who desire them, if need of more is at
any time apparent their coinage may be
renewed.
That disaster has not already "over
taken us furnishes no proof that danger
does not wait upon a continuation of the
present silver coinage. We have been
saved by most careful management and
unusual expedients by a combination of
fortunate conditions and by the confident
expectation that the course of the gov
ernment in regard to Bilver coinage would
be speedily changed by the action of
Congress.
Prosperity hesitates upon our threshold
because of the dangers and uncertainties
surrounding ' this question. Capitalists
timidly shrink from trade aud investors
are unwilling to take the chance of the
questionable shape in which their money
will be returned to them, while enterprise
halts at the risk against which care and
sagacious management do not protect. -
As a necessary consequence labor lacks
employment and suffering and distress
are visited upon a portion ot our tellow
citizens especially entitled to the careful
consideration ot those charged with the
duties of legislation", No interest appeals
to us bo strongly for safe and stable
currency as the vast army of the unem
ployed. - ''.''. vi rp 1 : r
I recommend the suspension ot com
pulsory coinage of silver dollars directed
by the law passed in February, 1878.
The Navy. Referring to report of the
Secretary of Navy, the President among
other things says: concerning tne ois-
patch boat Dolphin, claimed to be com
pleted and awaiting the acceptance of the
Department, no one can fail to see from
recitals contained in this report that only
the application of business 'principles has
been insisted' upon in tthe -treatment of
these subjects and that whatever contro
versy has arisen was caused by the exac
Hon on the part ot the Department ot
contract obligations, as they were legally
construed.
Recommending that the work upon the
cruisers authorized at the last session - of
Congress be, pushed, the President con
tinues. All must admit the' importance
of an effective Navy to a nation like ours,
having such an extended sea coast to pro
tect, and yet we have not a. single vessel
of war that could keep the seas against a
first-class vessel of any important power.
Such condition ought not longer continue,
The nation that cannot resist aggression
is constantly exposed to it, its foreign
policy is of necessity weak and its nego
tiations are cond noted with disadvantage,
because it is not in a condition to enforce
the terms dictated by its sense of right
and justice. , .-..
A Thoroughly Reorganized Navy De-
vartment Wanted. Inspired as i am by
the hope shared by all patriotic citizens,
that the day is not very far distant when
our Navy will be such as befits our stand
ng among the nations of the earth and
rejoice at every step ! that leads in the
direction of such a consummation, I deem
t jay dutv to especially direct the inten
tion of Congress to the close of th e report
of the Secretary of the Navy, in which the
humiliating weakness of the present or
ganization of bis department, is exhibited
anu ine siarinng auuses anu waste oi us
present methods are exposed., .The con
viction is forced upon us with the certain
ty ot mathematical demonstration that
before we proceed further in the restora
tion of the Navy we need a thoroughly
reorganized Navy Department.
The 'Post i Office. The President' ap
proves the, recommendation of .the Post
master General that the charge on domes
tio money orders of five dollars or less be
reduced to five cents. .
The United States Courts. The con
tinuation of business in the courts of the
Uuited States, the President says, is
such that there seems to be an imperative
necessity lor remedial legislation on . the
subject. Some of these courts are so over
burdened with pending causes that the
delays in determining litigation, amount
often to a denial of justice. Among the
plans suggested for relief is one submitted
by the,Attorney General. Its main fea
tures are: A transfer of all original juris
diction oi the Circuit Courts to the Dis
trict Courts, and an increase of judges for
the latter , where, necessary; an addition
ol judges to the Circuit Courts and con
stituting them courts ot appeal, and rea
sonably limiting the appeals thereto:
urther restrictions of the right to remove
cases from State to Federal Courts, per
muting appeals to the Supreme Court
from the courts of the District of Colum
bia and the territories, only in the same
cases as they are allowed from the State
courts and, guarding against an unneces
sary number of appeals from the Circuit
Courts. .
I think that the marshals and district
attorneys should be paid salaries, adjusted
by a rule which will make them commen
surate with the service fairly rendered.
Pensions. The cleansing of the pension
rolls of those who have been placed there
by fraudulent means and other reforms in
the pension service are recommended.
The Mormon Question. Discussing
the Mormon question in Utah, the Presi-
tnt says: There should be no relaxa
tion in the firm but just execution of the
aw now in operation, and 1 should be glad
to approve such further discreet legisla
tion as will rid the ' country of this blot
upon its fair name.
Our Agricultural Interests. The agri
cultural interests of , the country, the
President says, demands just recogni
tion and liberal encouragement. Legisla
tion for the protection of our live stock
against disease is recommended. If the
aws now in operation are insufficient to
accomplish this protection, I recommend
their amendment to meet the necessities
of the situation, and I commend to the
consideration ol Congress the suggestions
contained in the report of the Commission
er of Agriculture calculated to lucrease
the value and officiency of this depart
ment. The Civil Service. The report of the
Civil Service Commissioner contains an
account of the manner in which the civil
service law has been executed during the
last year, aud. gives much valuable in
formation on this important subject. I
am incliued to think there is no sentiment
more general in the miuds of the people
of our country than the conviction of the
correction of the principle upon which the
law enforcing Civil Service Reform is
based. In its present condition the law
regulates only a part of the subordinate
public positions throughout the country.
It applies the test of fitness to applicants
for these places by means of competitive
examination, and gives a large discretion
to the Commissioners as to the character
of the examination and many other mat
ters connected with its execution. Thus
the rules and regulations adopted by the
Commission have much to do with the
practical usefulness of the statute and
with tne results 6f its application. "
The people? may well trust the Commis
sion to execute the law with perfect fair
ness and with as little irritation as possi
ble. But, of course, no relaxation of the
principle which ' underlies it, and no
weakening of the saleguards which sur
round it can be expected. Experience in
its administration will probably suggest
amendments of the methods of its execu
tion, but I venture to hope that we shall
never again be remitted to a system
which distributes positions purely as re
wards for partisan service. Doubts may
well be entertained whether oar govern
ment could survive such a atrain of a con
tinuance of this system which, upon every
change of aiministration, inspires an im
mense army of claimants for office to lay
siege to the patronage of the government,
engrossing the time of the public officers
with their importunities, spreading abroad
the contagion of their disappointment and
falling the air with the tumult ot their
discontent.
The Allurements of Place. The allure
ments ot an immense number ol o race 8
and places exhibited to the voters1 of the
land and the promise of their bestowal in
recognition of partisan activity . debauch
suffrage and rob political action of its
thoughtful and deliberative character.
The evil would - increase with the multi
plication of offices consequent npon our
extension and a mania for office-holding
growing from its indulgence would per
vade our. population so generally that pa
triotic purpose, the support of principle,
the desire for the publio good and solici
tude for the nation s welfare, would be
nearly banished from the activity of our
party contests, and cause them to degen
erate into ignoble, selfish and disgraceful
struggles for positions of omce and public
place. Civil service reform enforced by
law came none too soon to check the pro
gress of demoralization. One of its effects
not enough regarded is the freedom it
brings to the political action of these con
servative and sober-minded men who in
(he fear of confusion and risk attending
an arbitrary and sadden change in all
public offices with change of party rule,
cast their ballots against such change.
: Parties seem to be necessary and will
long continue to exist, nor can it be now
denied that there are legitimate advan
tages not disconnected with office-holding
which: follow party, supremacy. While
partisanship continues bitter and pro
nounced, and supplies so much of the mo
tive to sentiment and action it is not fair
to hold public officials, in charge of im
portant trusts, responsible for the best
results in the performance of their duties,
and yet you insist that they shall rely in
confidential and important places npon
the work of those not only opposed to
them , in political affirmation, bat so
steeped in partisan prejudice and rancor
tbat they have no loyalty to their chiefs
and no desire for their success. Civil
service reform does not exact this, nor
does it require tbat those in subordinate
positions who fail in yielding their best
service, or who are incompetent should be
retained simply because they are in place.
The whining of a clerk discharged lor in
dolence or incompetency who, though he
gained his . place by the worst possible
operation of the spoils system, suddenly
discovers that he is indebted to protection
under the sanction of civil service reform,
represents an idea no less absurd than the
clamor of the applicant who claims a va
cant position as bis compensation for his
most questionable party work.
Ihe civil service law does not prevent
the discharge of an indolent or incompe
tent clerk, but it does prevent supplying
his place with an unfit party worker.
Thus in both these phases is seen the
benefit to the public service, and the peo
ple who desire good government, having
secured this statute, will not relinquish its
benefits without protest. Nor are they
unmindful of the fact that its full advan
tages can only be gained through the com
plete good faith ot those having its execu
tion m charge, and this they will insist
upon. ,
I recommend that the salaries of the
Civil Service Commissioners be increased
to a sum more nearly commensurate to
their important duties.
The Presidential Succession. The pres
ent condition of the law relating to the
succesBiou of the Presidency in the event
of the death, disability, or removal of both
President and Vice President, the Presi
dent says is such as to require immediate
amendment. This subject has repeatedlv
been considered by Congress, but no re
sult has been reached. The recent la
mentable death of the Vice President, and
the vacancies at the same time in all
other offices, the incumbents of which
might immediately exercise the functions
of the Presidential office, has caused pub
lic anxiety and a just demand that the re
occurrence of such a conditien of affairs
should not be permitted.
In conclusion, I commend to the care
and thoughtful attention of Congress, the
needs, welfare and aspirations of an intel
ligent and generous nation. To subordi
nate these to the narrow advantages of
partisanship, or tho accomplishment of
selfish aims, is to violate the people's
trust and betray the people's interests,
but in an individual sense of responsibility
on the part of each of us, and the stern
determination to perform our duty well.
must give us place among those who have
added in their day and generation to the
glory aud prosperity of our beloved land.

Washington, Dec. 8, 1885.
Indian Commissioner Welsh, of
Philadelphia, was once negotiating a
treaty with the chief of a certain tribe,
and wished to impress upon them the fact
of his confidential relations with the Presi
dent. "I have," said he, as the interpre

tence, into the Indian tongue, "I have the
ear of the Great Father." "Stop I" ex
claimed one of the chiefs, impressively; "I
do not believe that. Tell him fto the in
terpreter if he has the Great Father's ear,
to produce it. Show it to us and we will
believe him."
