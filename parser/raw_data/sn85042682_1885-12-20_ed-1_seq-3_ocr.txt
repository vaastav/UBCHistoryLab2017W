" No, the DcmocrnU In onr LcgKlaturo don't mean
that Sherman shall bo returned as United States
Senator from onr State If they can prevent It," said
an Ohio Republican Congressman to the Lounger
the other evening, talking of the coming Senatorial
election. "What can bo donolo prcTentltt" was
the natdral Infjulrf. " A ood many lhlnrfs ceilld bo
done," was iho answer," and" I'll letl yorf wtfal fi'al
already been atlempiod. torf see, w6 only haoa,
reliable majority of three. Tho Democrats havo
the money, and money Is just as potent a factor In
Ohio In rout leal matters aslt is In other states. The
Democrats aro too quiet now, and there Is ono thing
which makes ns suspect mischief. They don't go
gunning with a brass barid, at any. lime, and nt
present they nro keeping their p)an mighty still,
but ono move they havo attempted li thlst Th.q
members-elect from the counties of Mnsklngum and
Licking are Republicans, and not very well off In
worldly goods. 1 hear that Dave Stewart, whawos
elected frsm tho last-named connly.has, been offered
Ahandsomo Inducement to resign. It was In tho
shape of a good salary as foreman of a machlno shop
over In Indiana. Tho araonnt offered was 1.1,000 A
year, and ho was to bo paid two years' salary In ad
vance." "lint how would Ihls help tho Demo
crats!" 1 Inquired. "I was Just coming to that. If
Stewart had resigned thero wonld bo no member for
Licking when tho voto for Senator was had, for a
special election could not bo held in lime to meet
Ihls emergency. Tho law fixes the ilato of Iho
Senatorial election, and that's Iho way they expected
to cut off our Republican voto.
"Tholhlngwasnll figured out, but Stewart did
not resign. Thero Is something going on of tho
same sort In Muskingum and Vinton counties. If
three Republicans could be got lo resign before tho
Senatorial election, and a Bncclal election should bo
held, tho Democrats could afford to put $10,000
into tno canvass ror their own candidates, and with
this amount Ihcy might manage to carry them. 1
have a letter from Sprlngllold which tells mo of a
new dodge," and tho gentleman read as follows 1
"They (tho Democrats) aro playing It low down,
and tf wo don't watch they will beat us. 1 hear that
five members of Iho Legislature who aro Republi
cans havo been approaohed and asked to stay away
from Columbus until nftcrthc tlmo In which the law
declares iho balloting for Senator shall begin has
passed. A failure to elect n Senator would glvo
tho Oovcrnor tho appointment of ono until
Another Legislature was chosen. This would
glo tho Democrats another chanco to carry the
staio and get tho Legislature In tho new election,
and Ihey might win. I hear too," said tho writer of
this letter, " that tho Democrats are declaring that If
iostcr or Judgo West will agreo to boa candldato
for tho Senate, and mako any showing of strength,
enough Democrats can bo got to voto for cither ono
of them to elect him. I don't know how trtiolhlB
may be, but tltcy nro determined to beat Sherman If
they can, and this Is a case In which tho utmost Igl
lancowlllbo required, for If wo do not watch wo
may lose the Scnatorshlp In spite of all we can do."
Allowing the usual discount on all llth sort of
rumor, that thero still seems to be some ground for
Republican uneasiness ts evident from what they
themselves admit. It would be one of Iho curiosi
ties of politics If Mr. Bhormin were beaten after all
he has done. As ho himself onco elated that be
thought right and morals Justified anything that
could bo dono to beat tho Democrats, ho should not
be surprised If Ihcy adopted his own ethics In tho
present instance.
Tho Interest felt all over the country in some plan
for tho reorganization of tho militia upon a national
basis was amply manifested by tho coming to
gether of prominent oltlccrs of thoNotlonol Ouard,
from all sections of the Union, last week, tor their
sixth annual meeting. When seventy-flvo gentle
man, embracing tho most prominent citizen soldiers
from Maine to California take the trouble to come
from distant homes at their own expense on nn er
rand like this It speaks equally well for their zeal
and patriotism. Tho representation from tho far
Western Plates w,is especially full and Intelligent.
anil tho only thing wanting in the meeting was Borne
expression and representation from tho local mili
tary of the District of Columbia. Jn vlewof the fact
that prominent gentlemen here have created and
maintained such crack organizations as the Washing
ton Battalion of Light Infantry, (a body that In the
social standing of Its members and Its perfection in
military drill and disclpllno Is without a superior in
any city of tho Union,) and that It was unrepre
sented at a meeting as Important as was this ts most
surprising and unaccountable. The same omission
existed In the case of Iho National Rides. To be
sure, both corps nro self-supporting and receive
very little, It Indeed any, uld from the National or
local Government, but they belong to tho militia of
the country nevertheless, and nomo member from
each Bhonld have been present to speak for his
comrades, and tho failure was a matter of generally
expressed regret.
The movement Inaugurated by the association of
officers from tho National Guard for the purposes
mentioned has found expression In a very brief reso
lution, asking Congress to repeal the obsolete
clauses of tho act of 1S03 relative to tho militia, aud
amend it by somo much-needed legislation. Tho
most Important chango asked for is that which In
creases tho annual appropriation for the mainte
nance of tho national mllltla from $200,000 to $000,010
or $1,000,000 per annum, If tho latter sum 13
deemed necessary by Congress ; and there Is scarcely
a doubt but that $1,000,000 can bo hid If a united
effort bo made In that direction. Tim Sunday
IlEHtLD has always been the consistent advocate of
the principle set forth In tho Constitution relatlvo lo
tho maintenance of a mllltla, and any effort looking
to tho better organization and Improvement of Ihls
important national Instrument of defense must meet
with tho cordial approval of all who have the good
of tho country at heart.
No Incident of tho season has mado such a Bensa
Hon In a small way as a long ana carefully written
communication that appeared about a month ago In
the rail Mull Gnzitte, Instituting a careful analyti
cal comparison between tho genllowomen of Eng
land nnd tho equivalent class In this country in the
matter of beauty and bralus. Tho writer sums up
his, or her, general v lews with the following conclu
sion: "The ladles In the older cities of tho North
American continent aro, with scarcely any excep
tion, 8upcrlor to English gentlewomen In brain
power, In clearness of mental vision, In common
sense, In practical, Bound Judgment, and In general
Intelligence."
Naturally enough this broad and daring statement
mado a great row In England. "Tho British
Matron," who is prone to rush Into print upon tho
slightest provocation, has controverted this proposi
tion In communications to nearly every leading
Journal In arcat Britain, with no great degreo of
loglo lo be sure, but an abundanco of declaration,
and a wealth aud exubera'uco of denunciatory
verbiage that inuBt make the rash cause of all this
indignation feel that It would bo better that rocks
and mountains should fall upon him than that ho
should fall Into bis country-women's Indignant hands.
There Is ono thing, hswever, that Is certain. Tho
American girl, well born and properly educated, Is
the most charming bolng In Iho shape feminine un.
dcr tho eun. MiedreBscsbelterlhan tho rnrlslenne
herself when she can afford It, and tn cleverness, es.
vrit, and modest yet Independent bearing, she Is
inanltely tho Bupcrlor of any woman, class for
class, known to civilization, wbllo In personal
beauly, of a dcllcato typo that cannot well bo charac
terized, alio Is as far beyond Iter European sister
as sho Is In her mental endowments. This Is tacitly
acknowledged lu every continental capital. It may
not bo the beauty that you see lu French fashion
plates, but it Is a raro and Ineffable loveliness that
comes from healthy natural functions, from tho un
conscious graco that.ls higher than any art, that has
in beginning In Naluro'sown school. The typical
American girl, well bornaud nurtured, islbo modern
counterpart of Iho Greek Ideal, and In her cxlstenco
she confers a favor on tho rest of Christendom. Sho
has what Iho French call Ihcyi) ne falsjiastjuol, for
her charm Is In her frank, unconscious grace. Her
loveliness Is tho IovcIIucm of a beautiful soul, for
beauty without llfo and vivacity Is nothing but un
changing ugliness,
Somo years ago rrofessor DoMlllowrolea very
clever novel, entitled "Tho American Baron," which
bad a great run. It was thought, however, to Involve
too much that was Inherently Impossible, but thero
aro circumstances In real llfo stranger than any ever
depleted In novel or poetry. Thero aro qulto a num.
ber of rcrsous In America who aro entitled to " han
dles to their names," and It Is about some of them I
know Ihat I mean to write. Everybody In Washing,
ton is aware Ihat the real Lord Fairfax la a practic
ing physician In Maryland, Burko's Peerage, I mean
tho book having that title, says 1 " Fairfax, Eleventh
Lord, (title originating loir,) John Conteo Fairfax,
Son of tho latellou. A. Fairfax, brother of Tenth
Lord, (by Caroline, daughter of R. Snowdon, Esq ,)
born 1BS0, succeeded to title I W, married In 1851
Mary, daughter of Col. I!, Klrbcy, U.S. A., Is an
M. D. Rcsldcnco, Oak Grove, Prlnco Gcorgo County,
Maryland, U, H." This gentleman is also an
English Baron, under the title of Lord Camcrden,
and could sit In tho House of I.ords If ho vicre to be
come an English subject, A few months ago thero
died hero a gentleman who was a very near relatlvo
ofthoDuko of Cleveland, nud had ho lived might
bao succeeded lo Iho title. Ho was very poor, and
but for friends, who sympathized with aud sutler
stood hi real worth of character, he might havo
known want.
Thero Uvea luNowOrloaus a quiet, tuodcst.nilddle
aged geutlcman, n prosperous stationer of that city,
whols tho lineal descendant of ono of tho most
famous noble housos of Franco, aud heir to tho
MarquUulo of St. Cyr. Not very inauy people aro
aware that (leu. Beauregard Is tho Couut do Hcauro
gard, aud that his name Is Plcrro Uustao Toutaut
comlo do Boatirrgard. Ills father was alwajs
known as Jacques Toutaut do iniuitvuid, A
gentleman tolerably well known to journalism In tho
South Is a llarou of Frauco, being tho nearest inalo
to a title that Is almost a thousand years old. Tho
family estate, consisting mostly ul personality, goes
to two ladles ; so tho llllo would be but u barren honor,
aud ho has too much goodseuso to care auythlug
about It. Ono of tho cleverest of tho younger school
of New Orleans Journalists Is a Marquis of Frauco,
or would bo if ho wero a citizen of that republic
At present ho has given up Journalism, I bellow,
and ts Judgo of ono of the Pollco Courts of that city,
and a capital Jusllco he makes, too. Tho curlons
history of Elcazar William? a mlddlo-agcd gentle
man who died many years ago In a Now England
State, who wan believed to bo tho Dauphin and heir
to tho Bonrbons of France Is well remembered
still. There seemed to bo nodonbt of tho legitimacy
of his right, but ho took no trouble In tho matter,
and nothing ever came of It, except much cnrlons
s'pfcnlatlon And somo Interesting historical dls
coVHloo. Tho strangest circumstance of (tils' tori .''as, t
think, never been In print. Thero Is no donbtbnt
that the nearest living relatlvo of Iho First Napo
leon, his grandson In fact, Is an American citizen.
Tho facts tn his case can bo briefly stated. Just be
fore tho Russian oampalgu was undertaken, and In
deed whtlo tho Emperor was reorganizing his army
(or Ihls coup )n 1811, rru was very brilliant, for
tho First Emplro was In Iho zenith of lis glory. At
tho Court Ihcro was a young lady In walling ripofl
Iho Empress who was very pretty and vola'lllc. Sho
had tho misfortune to attract Iho attention of Napo
leon, and finally Iho result was is might ha6 been
expected. The King's power Is' always ilang'cron's'
to women, and tho daughter of an ancient and hon
orablo houso wai so seriously compromised that
msrrlngowasnocos.ary to stvohcr reputation. A
dashing and handsome cavalry officer, serving on
tho staff of Marshal Mural, was much enamoured of
tho young Trovoncal beauty. Ono day his Imperial
master sent for tho A. D. C, And Imformed him that
It was his wish that he marry Iho young M Ho. dc
Immediately. As Napoleon had beforo ordered
several marriages nti coj at tambour, his haste In
tho matter was not considered unusual, or If It was
thero were no comments that ramo to tho to-bo
bridegroom's ears. So Iho young lady was given a
handsomo dot and married before sho had tlmo to
protest or think twice about It. After a week's
honeymoon her husband was ordered to take tho
Held, and when ho returned nearly a year thereafter,
terribly wounded, ho was much surprised to find
himself tho pntatlvo father of a daughter, who was
about six months old. Thero was a terriblo scene
between husband and wife, for she told htm the
truth, Though she had been so frail, yet she nursed
her wounded husband so faithfully and patiently till
his recovery that to her caro tho physician de
clared his p tttcnt owod his life, aud tho couple made
up and agreed Ulctttio past bo bloltod out. But,
though he forgave his wife, tho Colonel never for
gavo tho Emperor, and tho first thing. he did upon
his recovery was to enter Into n conspiracy for the
restoration of tho Bourbons. He was found out, con
victed of treason, and condemned to bo shot, and
nothing but his wife's personal appeal to the Em
peror saved his life; but ho was ordered to leave
France, which ho did, and went first to Ilajll, and
from thero came to tho United States.
Tho person spoken of at Iho beglnulngnf this para
graph is tho grandson of the lady referred to, and
the son of her llrst-born daughter. Thero H no
doubt whatever as to tho accuracy of this state
ment. Ills own mother told him In her told htm In
her last Illness what I havo hero related, and aub
stantlstcd h-r Almost Incrcdiblcand very astounding
story by documentary evidence that was beyond ques
tion or cavil. Thegentlemtn who Is now coming
Into middle life has the Bonaparte look to n degreo
that Is startling at times, and It has attracted the at
tention of persons v. ho never dreamed of any kin
ship. Hellves In an American city, Is fairly well-to-do,
and only his very Intimate friend 1 aro awaro
that he Is the nearest living descendant of the
mighty conqueror ol Europe. Surely truth Is
stranger than fiction.

A roil r tit edition has been printed, and a tilth is con

At tho Boston dinner to Commissioner Dorman B.

A New York firm advcrtlsoaB "Stationers to his

This Is but a silly adoption of the English custom,
where a celebrated firm of cutlers give 10 tho world
t he legend, " Razor manufacturers to tho Oucen." It
Is "more honored In tho breach than in Iho observ

Tho Philadelphia and Now York Custom House
officials liavo decided that Apolllnarls water Is duti
able as a manufactured article. The great Apolll
narls qucBtion was onco decided the other way by
Secretary Fotger, ami it Is said that the Apollo of the
American bar Mr. Roscoc Conkllng mado a fee of
$50,000 for securing this decision, overruling as It
did a previous opinion of Attorney General Mc
Veigh. There Isan alarming Increase of diphtheria patients
tn New York and Its suburbs, and a large proportion
of the cases is fatal. Localities which are noted for
good drainage and well-constructed houses arc
suffering from tho disease, as well as tho crowded
and llly-dralued sections of tho city. According to
Dr. Naglc, of the New York Bureau of Vital Statis
tics, tho first case of diphtheria reported lu llio cliy
was In 1S5T, since when the Increase In tho number
of cases reported annually has been great.
After a thorough Investigation of Iho working of
tho prohibitory i'quor law In Iowa, Hon. M. P.
Sutton, a strong antl-llquor man nnd member of
tho lowu Senate, comes to tho conclusion that local
option and not Mate prohibition is tho causo for Ihe
tempcrauco men lo advocate. According to his
statistics more liquor was vended openly In more
Elncca after the passage of the prohibitory law than
eforc, and there wero a largo additional number of
places whero It was sold on tho sly. ills conclusions
nro that prohibition Is only useful whero public
local sentiment sustains It, and Injurious whero it
docs not. He now advocates local option and high
license.
A correspondent of Ihe Boston C.ur He says that
tho lato Mr. Vandc rbllt was a devoted friend of Miss
Kellogg. That when tho latter was at Saratoga he
was very fond of spending an evening with his wife
In her parlor, and nothing pleased him mora than
to hear her sing English ballads, unless perhaps
when sho took down her banjo from tho wall and
sang a negro melody. Ills eyes fairly danced, and
ho laughed as heartly as n child nt the "Yallcrgal
dressed In blue," which, desnito Its frivolous name,
is a very pretty melody. I think I am safe in saying
that Mr. Vanderbllt has left tho bulk of his forluno
tohlsBon Cornelius, who has displayed a greater
aptliudo for business than any other member of the
faintly.
"Talk- of Iho credulity of believers 1" says tho
ll'iitrnimn. "It Is not to bo named tn the same

mesmerism, clairvoyance, and telepathy; aud nssirls
that they are 'no longer questionable but proved.1

Ex-Delegalo Cannon, whoso com Itllon of a viola
tion of tho "Edmunds Act " was recently sustained
by the Supremo Court of tho United States, divided
his tlmo between his three whes, Clara, Sarah, and
Amanda, with the most accurate Impartiality. Ho
no arranged tho Important matter of meal-taking us
to give them each a day In turn. With Clara ho
breakfasted, dined, and supped on Mondays ami
Thursdays, Willi Sarah on Tuesdays aud Fridays,
and with Amanita on Wednesdays and Saturdays,
while on tho Sabbath day hobreakfaslcdwllh Clara,
dined with Sarah, and supped with Amanda. Not

"An ordinary looking water-color palnllug of an
Eastern landscape," Bays tho Pittsburg Denmlcli,
"Is attracting considerable attention In Camden, as
It was painted by den. U. 8. Grant In 1SI3, while ho
was at West Point. Tho narao of U. II. Grant Is In
