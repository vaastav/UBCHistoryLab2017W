PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
President Wilson in his mes
sage o Congress makes vigor
ous prosecution of the war, with
no alternative bui victory In the
end, the condition of peace with
Germany. la urging a declara
tion of war with the other belli
gerent enemies,, he takes the
only practical view of a neces
sary step in the more speedy and
successful prosecution of the
war. It is estimated that there
are more than a million alien
enemies in the country from
those nations who are in sym
pathy with Germany. A decla
ration of "war with Austria and
the other hostile nations Is nec
essary in order to put a better
check upon the secret agents of
theaa foreign nations, and upon
the German propadandists and
pacifists, that many of our peo
ple may not be misled into the
pitfalls and snares of German in
trigue which have brought about
the downfall and disgraceful dis
ertion of Russia.
The Presidents message will
have a wholsome effect upon the
entire country, and will tend to
allay any fears.that this country
will allow the Russian desertior
of her allies and benefactors, t(
stand in the way of victory, thai
'. peace, when it does come, maj
be dominant and enduring fo.
the worlds safety, and for world
democracy.

TRAINING SCHOOL.
. Nothing has pleased us more
on our advent to Colnmbia than
to find a community of such uni-
.verial culture and intellectual
refinement. By comparison with
many less fortunate small cities,
it does not take the visitor and
new-omer long to discover the
incentives that have brought
auch high standards of social
life, and the causes that have
made this delightful city of Co-
lumbia . so attractive to people
seeking homes. This, when one
looks around, must be attributed
to the splendid institutions oi
learning that have been long
.' fostered. under the influence of a
patronage whose first aim has
been' to maintain at home the
.facilities for a liberal education
,for their children. -No institu
tion of -learning has done more
for a:community in ' Kentucky
than has the Lindsey-Wilsor.

maintained for the purpose of
meeting a need that has long
been splendidly supplied. for this
section of Kentucky by this great

the management of Prof. G. L.

taken rank among the foremost
and most successful of the State's
educational leaders. On coming
to Columbia we were glad to find
at the head of this Institution
for christian learning our former
associate in the work, and effi
cient former colleague on the
State Board of Examiners, whose
work as a member of this im
portant Board did much for the
raising of standards for the com
mon schools of Kentucky. Under
this management Lindsey-Wilson
will continue its splendid career
for the cause of civilization -and

THE LOOSE LEAF MARKET.
A leading farmer in Adair
County sold last week- his crop
of tobacco outside of the market,
where competition is afforded by
the presence of buyers who es
tablish market values, for an
average of, 17 cts per pound.
This farmer saw this same to
bacco sell the next day on the
loose leaf floor for an average of
22 cts per pound. The disparity
in price and consequent loss to
the farmer represents practically
what tobacco use to sell for when
the farmer was at the mercy oi
the man higher up. Now when
the farmer has an opportunity
for good living, prices for his
products, he is, here in Adair
county, handicapped for the lack
of a market at home. Hundreds
of farmers who would market
their tobacco at Columbia and
spend more 6f their money here,
would gladly support the organi
zation of a loose leaf market
here. They are- already seeing
the great loss to them, by not
having had a loose leaf market
already organized, for the
sale of. the crop of this season.
DIGEST OF STATE POLITICS: ,
The people and tax payers
hoped that the extra session of
the Legislature in 1917 would
pass a tax measure that would
accomplish at least three things:
More equitable distribution of
taxes; the greater exploitation of
our resources by putting into
general development large
amounts of idle capital and bring
ing into the state more outside
capital: and diminishing asrapid
ly as possible the outstanding
debt of the state. The new law
looks better than the old one,
and with amendatory simplifi
cation will in time accomplish the
first two objects. The third can
never be accomplished, we fear,
except by constitutional provJ3
iorrfor a bond issue" and sinking
fund. It will certainly neVer bel
accomplished thru the promises
of candidates of political parties.
Wilson and Hageried with each
other in platitudinouH pledges,
McUreary and O'Rear made it
appear a cinch for each in their
pledges to the people, while Mor
row and Stanley in their almost
tie contest of 1915 could on oc
casions cease to prate about
the wJzzard of finance" to
promise by the saints in glory
that- each would in four years
make the platterciean. We have
seen little difference between the
two men as statesmen save that
one is a republican and the other
a democrat; and until both par
ties get" away from -the weak

nances can be placed upon, a
sound business basis."
f
It is a matter of the political
history of North Carolina, Vir
ginia, and other Southern states
.that until the issues of sound edu
cational and economic develop
ment of the state were put
squarely hefore the people by
leader brave enough to defy
temporary reverses at the hands
of the demagog and political jug
gler, the great reforms that
have in recent years put these
states so far forward did not
come. The signs indicate that
things are beginning to take
such shape in Kentucky tho long
delayed by chronic subordination
of real .jssue3 and real needs to
the antics and prantings of prof
fessional politicians and dema
gogs. Many changes will come as a
result" of war conditions. .New
leaders in both parties will be
made to espouse more encourag
ingly for the masses of the peo
ple, old issues and new issues
Public sentiment is predicting
already that many things and
conditions-are opening the eyes
of the people to the folly of
blindly following longer the corn
stalk gods of office seeking.
Some private, corporal, or sear
gent in the ranks "over there"
or here, may soon appear to dis
turb the political equilibrium of
both the old political parties, in
the state.
Rumor this week.has it that
we failed to cover the ground in
our last talk, and that there are
many others than were mention
ed, being quietly considered in
the minds of people as probable
and good timber for various high
offices to be filled next year and
thereafter. Our attention has
been especially and frequently
called to Harry Sommers of
Elizabeth town, as one eminently
fitted for the office of Governor
of Kentucky. We have hesitat
ed to take his name in vain
knowing his aversion to politi
cal mention. But that has been
the trouble with Kentucky poli
tics in the past. Too many of
our real and solid men fear, thru
dignity-and modesty, to be con
sidered as real leaders of the
people.
Many of the- wi3e dopesters
are awaiting the outcome of the
1918 General Assembly before
giving" much consideration to the
aspirants to minor state offices
and probable candidates for
other offices. It is not to be
gainsaid, that in spite of. ad
ministration handicaps as has
often been the case in the past,
there are several men at Frank
fort now holding office either by
election or appointment who
have made for the people most
excellent publie servants and
who ought to be continued" there
as. an endorsement of their,
splendid. .and efficient services.
Chas. Morris .the present. Attor
ney General is a big enough man
to continue as he is or go high
er. Considering that, Rpy.L. Mc
Farland has been one of the. few
expertly qualified school men of
the state to be elected over the
protest of the-old order of poli
ticians to the State Senate, he
1 will no doubt be a strong possi
bility for the Very important

A Complete Stock of United

larger job His friends- are
hoping for him an unscathed re
cord in the Senate.
Here in our home Senatorial
district people are wondering
whether and when Major Trigg
will resign, since the office of
Senator and his .commission in
the Army are incompatible. It
has been suggested that in the
event of his early resignation
and an election to fill the vacan
cy, an "administration" man
could not be elected in the dis
trict. On account of this there
may b "techmicalu and other
wise' explainable delays in this
matter. The democrats of the
district are very greatly interest
ed in this, since, the1 time is
short and .the special election
must probably be called by the
Governor.
As indicated heretofore the
"digest" will be continued at
opportune sundry times.
Hon. R. B. Trigg, of Glasgow
is the State Senator from the
counties of Adair, Barren and
Metcalfe. Ho is a Major in the
army and is assigned to Camp
Lee, Va., and it is not believed
that he will be able to attend the
coming session of the Legisla
ture which will convene at
Frankfort in a few weeks. The
district should be represented,
and we take it that Mr. Trigg
will resign in due time for some
one to.be elected in his stead.
Barren county will be entitled to
the candidate for the short term,
and " Adair county will take
pleasure in supporting the can
didate she puts ouC Mr. D. E.
Hatcher, who was defeated for
the nomination by Mr. Trigg, will
probably be a candidate and per
haps otfiers. . This ' end of the
district will cheerfully support
any candidate-named by Barren
