WASHI A LTO N CO K RESPON I) ENC E.
Washington, Dec. 6. (Special Cor
respondence)—George Burkitt, once,
and now once more, assistant post
master at Winnetka, 111., has had a
kind of “Off-again-on-again-gone
again-Finnegan” experience. He was
dismissed from the postal service for
having said that the president’s sec
ond marriage was indelicately sudden.
He tried to secure a hearing from the
postmaster-general and was turned
down. He published the correspond
ence in the newspapers. He was or
dered reinstated within twenty-four
hours.
This doubtless closes the incident so
far as concerns Burkitt and his job.
But the episode has brought about a
renewal of comment over the presi
dent’s courtship and marriage which
has caused no little irritation at the
White House, where great pains have
always been taken to minimize gossip
on this particular topic. The presU
dent’s attention to Mrs. Galt have been
no secret here in Washington for
many months. No one here was es
pecially surprised when the engage
ment was announced; and the only
comment which the capital vouch
safed was in line with that for which
Burkitt lost his job.
A few western newspapers had dealt
with the subject in like vein; the wo
men of Idaho—where women vote—
had been polled with a similar expres
sion of opinion; and the girls of a
western university had held a meeting
and resoluted to the same effect. But
the subject was no longer exciting in
terest, even privately, and was in a
fair way to disappear altogether, when
suddenly up hobs Burkitt’s boss, As
sistant Postmaster-General Roper,
with an official letter which has set
all tongues to wagging again and with
accelerated force.
The news broke here on Sunday, and
the correspondents became immediate
ly active. At the White House it was
said that nothing was known about the
matter. Postmaster-General Burleson
refused to say anything. But Mr. Ro
per talked with some freedom and
seemed to think he had in some way
befriended the president in firing Bur
kitt. Tumulty, however, had no such
illusions and, as soon as he had given
the situation the once over, lie prompt
ly proceeded to announce Burkitt’s re
instatement "by instructions of the
president.”
So far as Burkitt is concerned that
ended it. But it did not end the gos
sip. No, indeed. That is still going
on, with the concensus in Burkitt’s
favor by a large majority.
Postmaster-General Burleson has
been recognized as the active political
personality in the present cabinet, and
he has lately furnished additional evi
dence that he is on the job.
Just as it became clear that the
democrats in congress were about to
show defiance to their master’s voice
from the White House, Mr. Burleson
hastened to publish a “list of first,
second and third-class postoffices
where presidential postmasters have
not been appointed since March 4,
1913.” The list is imposing, compris
ng some 1.400 places and taking in
every state.
There is no doubt here regarding
Mr. Burleson’s purpose in publishing
the list just now. It is generally be
lieved that he is dangling a bait hook
before the democratic congressmen
who are showing signs of independ
ence from the White House control.
The list is looked upon as at once a
menace and an appeal. In effect Mr.
Burleson says to democratic congress
men : "Here is the pie which is not
yet distributed. You can see how
much your share should be. If you
are good, you will get it. If you are
not good, it will be withheld.”
"National prepardness and national
revenues are two problems that go
hand in hand.
“The democratic administration pro
poses the one, when it has utterly
failed to solve the other.”
These are conclusions reached by
Representative Frederick H. Gillett of
Massachusetts, ranking minority mem
ber of the appropiatons committee.

His statement has greater significance
when it is remembered that for weeks
Mr. Gillett has been in daily con
ference with both democrats and re
publicans of the house in an effort to
improve the present system of financ
ing government appropriations.
“The question of revenues is the
most difficult problem the democratic
party must face when the congress
meets,” said Mr. Gillett. "Republicans
have always claimed that lack of busi
ness efficiency was an inherent and in
evitable defect in every democratic ad
ministration. That theory has been
abundantly illustrated since March
4. 1913.
"Dilatoriness, vacillation, change of
plans and deficits have marked the
democratic fiscal policy. A constant
excess of expenditures over receipts
has been shown by treasury state
ments. Furthermore, the sudden
change in the form of statements
adopted on the first of October, wheth
er made for that purpose or not, had
the effect of pieventing easy com
parisons and unfairly swelling the
apparent treasury balance.
“Now the president Is going to rec
ommend appropriations for the army
and navy. The serious problem will
be how to pay them. In the past re
publicans have been allowed no voice
in these matters. Plans have been
formulated by a democratic sub-com
mittee, endorsed by a democratic cau
cus, and passed by a democratic ma
jority kept sold by the pressure of
party tyranny and administration
patronage.
"Whether the same system will pre
vail in the coming session will de
pend, I suppose, upon the harmony in
the democratic ranks and the necessi
ties of the administration. At all
events 1 think the funds necessary
for the program should be raised by
taxation and not by the sale of bonds.
The proposed expenditures for na
tionsl defense should not be shifted
on to our successors, but should be
paid from current revenues.
“This involves cutting off our lux
uries and pruning down our necessi
ties on the one hand, and increasing
our income on the other.
“It involves surveying the field
from a business and not from a polit
ical or sectional viewpoint and that
is where I fear democratic failure.
Unless the party can meet the situ
ation with better business foresight
and efficiency than it has so far dis
played, the current drift toward the
republican party will become a land
slide.”
A RULE-OR-RUIN POLICY.
The New York World is for Wilson,
and it sometimes affects to speak for
Wilson. We wonder if it speaks for
Wilson when it says:
“One of two things will happen in
Washington at the coming session of
congress. Either the administration’s
program will be adopted or there will
be no increase in the army and navy.”
There can be only one interpretation
of this language. It means the Wil
son plan of prepardness must be swal
lowed in its entirety by congress un
der the painful alternative of leavng
the nation in its present wretched con
dition of military unreadiness.
Yet it is well known that there are
not enough democratic votes in con
gress to adopts the president’s plan.
If that plan is adopted it must be by
republican support. Does the World
wish the country to understand that
republicans must vote for legislation
in the framing of which they are to
have no voice? Is the president’s re
cent and sudden conversion to the
cause of prepardness so thorough that
he can already master all the essen
tials of the problem? Has he, after a
few weeks, been able to formulate a
plan which, running counter as it does
to that of the experts in the war and
navy departments, is nevertheless su
perior to anything that those experts
would suggest? Is the president in
fallable?
The policy which the W’orld sug
gests is a rule-or-ruin policy. Such a
policy has too often marked this ad
ministration already—with consequent
disaster to the nation’s enterprise and
honor. If it is now purposed to apply
this policy with disaster to the na
tion’s fate in case of war, that fact
should be plainly made known. Is
that what the World wants the coun
try to understand?
DEMOCRATIC PARTY OPPOSED
MERCHANT MARINE.
Congressman W. E. Humphrey of
Washington. January 14, 1915 —"In
his Indianapolis speech, the president
was especially severe upon those who
do not agree with him in regard to his
socialistic propositions to construct a
merchant marine. He said of those
who oppose him on this proposition:
‘Some of them are blind; some of
them misguided; most of them are
ignorant.’
“I w’ill make no comment upon the
propriety or the lack of self-poise in
dicated by those words. I do not be
lieve, sc far as my memory serves me,
that any other president has ever
used such language as that in refer
ence to another branch of the govern
ment, except Andrew Johnson. But
whatever we may think of the pro
priety of the language, certainly it
stills’ the tongue of those who have
been, with such show of virtuous in
dignation, ever ready to denounce any
one who criticizes the president. It
is somewhat hard to understand, in
view' of the record of his party and of
his own record, why the president
takes such offence at any man who
does not agree with him in regard to
his program for securing a merchant
marine. It was the democratic party,
under the leadership of Jefferson
Davis before the war, that enacted
legislation that led to the destruction
of our merchant marine, and since
that time the democratic party has op
posed every measure that has ever
been proposed that would be of bene
fit toward reconstructing it.
AVOID USURPATION OF POWE^R.
George Washington, farewell ad
dress.—lt is important that the habits
of thinking in a free country should
inspire caution in those intrusted with
its administration, to confine them
selves within their respective consti
tutional spheres, avoiding in the exer
cise of the powers of one department
to encroach upon another. The spirit
of encroachment tends to consolidate
the powers of all the departments in
one, and thus to create, whatever the
form of government, a real despotism.
A just estimate of that love of power
and proneness to abuse it which pre
dominate in the human heart is suffi
cient to satisfy us of the truth of this
position. The necessity of reciprocal
checks in the exercise of political
power, by dividing and distributing it
into different depositories and consti
tuting each the guardian of the public
weal against invasions of the others,
has been evinced by experiments an
cient and modern, some of them in
our country and under our eyes. To
preserve them must be as necessary as
to institute them. If, in the opinion
of the people, the distribution or modi
ficaton of the constitutional powers
be in any particular wrong, let it be
corrected by an amendment in the
way which the constitution designates.
But let there be no change by usurpa
tion, for though this in one instance
may be the instrument of good, it is
the customary weapon by which free
governments are destroyed. The pre
cedent must always greatly overbal
ance in permanent evil any partial or
transient benefit which the use can
at any time yield.
MADE A MATCH.
Ohio Columbus Barber, the Akron,
Ohio, millionaire match manufacturer,
and Miss Mary Orr were recently mar
ried.
A dispatch says that “both parties
will seek campaign material during
the coming session of congress.” No
need for the republican party to do
much searching. Its own record in
the upbuilding of American industry
during a period of sixteen years of
protective tariff, its achievements in
the establishment of a merit system
in the public service, its enactment of
such commendable legislation as the
postal savings bank law, the parcel
post, the pure food, Panama con
struction, the reclamation law, con
servation, the income tax amend
ment. the popular election of senators
amendment, and other measures too
numerous to mention, furnish an
abundance of affirmative material.
The democrats have, in two years,
supplied plenty of material with which
to attack them. Extravagance, resort
to spoils system, violation of pledges,
demoralization of public service, are
matters of public record and require
no searching.
The head over the article in last
Thursday’s Milwaukee News, describ
ing Senator LaFollette’s meeting at
Monroe the evening before, says:
"Bob Willing to Doff Toga to Save
State—Declares He Will Give Up Sen
ate Seat Before He W T ill See Progres
sive Government Taken Away—ls
W elcomed at Monroe —Attacks Philipp
Appointments to Rate Board and Dai-
ry and Food Department in Lengthy
Address.”
It does not require any particular
stretch of imagination to know that
our senior senator made a “lengthy
address” or that he “attacks Philipp;”
but the thing almost beyond human be
lief is his sudden spurt of patriotism
to any cause which would induce him
to pry himself loose from public office.
All this talk about “do your shop
ping early” is nice; but if it would
end there. After the shopping tour
is ended and pa has seated himself at
> the supper table, ma begins telling her
experiences and explains how she en
tered the house by leaving the pack
ages on the door step, then bribes little
Willie and Susie with pink candy to
go to another room. She then rescues
her packages and hides them, all of
which is interesting to pa, especially
when ma says: “I, bought a d-o-1-1
c-a-r-r-i-a-g-e and a d-r-u-m. The
fact should not be overlooked, how
ever, that 5-year-olds are now in the
kindergarten, and can spell, while in
ma’s and pa’s day the early period
schools were unknown.
The republican press of the country
has repeatedly exposed the false claim
of the democrats that it was the war
j that cut revenue. Statistics gathered
from the reports of this administration
show that even before the war the
deraocrtic tariff law' w'as not an ade
quate revenue producer. The fallin t
off in imports since the war began
was so slight that it cannot possibly
account for the shortage in revenue.
The fact is that the democrats cut the
tariff rates to such an extent that ade
quate revenue w r as impossible. Such
is the necessary result of democratic
tariff policies.
The democratic adminsitration need
not think it can fool the American peo
ple by selling Panama canal bonds
to fill its depleted treasury. Every
body will know exactly where the
money came from and where it goes.
“I shall not be a candidate for judge
of the Wisconsin supreme court at the
election next April if Judge W. H.
Timlin, the sitting member is a candi
date for reeleetion,” said Attorney-
General W. C. Owen, recently.
Watertown married women did not
appear to be the least bit jealous last
week when told that their husbands
were out nights being entertained by
the “chickens.”
“85 Die —King George Sends Let
ters of Sympathy to Victims,” reports
the Boston American. We doubt if it
does them much good.
There probably isn’t anybody like an
American war veteran for laughing at
England for the ludicrous way she is
muddling this war.
Uncle Joe Cannon is in congress
again—he “come back.” All of which
is nice if he will refrain from dancing
jigs and cutting up high-flaluten ca
pers on his birthday anniversary.
President Wilson wrote his annual
message himself, on the presidential
typewriter, presumably as a precau
tion against hyphens and split infini
tives.
That Wnnetka assistant postmaster
has done all he could to keep the pub
lic interested in the White House wed
ding.
Headline in an exchange: “Roose
velt Won’t Fight.” Is the millenium
approaching.
Our idea of a soft snap is to be the
minister of marine in Turkey.
Now are the winter flannels of our
discontent.
Free Trade With a Handicap.
Congressman E. J. Hil, of Cinnecti
cutt: “As I understand it,' r the common
expression of “a tax for revenue with
incidental protection” is meaningless.
There is no such thing as “incidental
protection,” for if the tax laid on im
ported merchandise is less than the
difference in the cost of production of
the like article here and elsewhere,
it means, so far as the general require
ments of the country for that article
are concerned, that it will come from
the cheapest producing point, which
means the transfer of the Industry to
foreign countries; and yet, after all,
strictly applied, a tariff for revenue
only, would compel the placing of the
tax upon such things only as did not
enter into competition with any do
mestic industry.
“As between such a tax and English
free trade, my preference would be
emphatically for the English system.
For example: suppose that a duty was
placed on tin, or rubber, or raw silk,
or tropical woods, all of which are
now imported free and manufactured
into finished products here and are
sent broadcast over the whole world,
if a tariff for revenue was placed upon
these articles how would it be possi
ble for us to maintain ah export trade
in competition with the other nations
of the world where these things are
not dutiable?
“I can reach but one conclusion,
therefore, that the choice of the Amer
ican people must ultimately be made
between a protective tariff which will
care for and preserve our home in
dustries, or the English free trade
system, and for a revenue only, as set
forth by the democratic doctrine, is
nothing more or less than free trade
with a handicap.”
COUGHS AND COLDS ARE

Few of us realize the danger of
Coughs and Colds. We consider them
common and harmless ailments.
