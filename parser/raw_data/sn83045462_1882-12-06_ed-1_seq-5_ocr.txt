When the hearing In the Dickson case was n
sumed this m >rnlng Mr. Wells stated that subpcens
h i?l been Issued by tr.e defense upon the Departmei
of Justice to furnish the original affidavits taKe
oy the assistant district attorney, lie malntaine
that the department could not be forced to prt
du^e public documents where only the interests <
a dtiz n were concerned- It could be required 1
produce certified copies only. He was willing a
a matter of courtesy to allow the defense an oj
portunity to examine the originals.
Mr. Smith said that they wanted to see the orlg
nals, and wanted to know what return had bee
mad-* to their subpoenas.
Mr. Cuppy stated that they also wanted certifle
copies of the Fall reports and th" Jury affidavit
Mr. Wells th<?n handed to the counsel for the d<
fense the original of the Dickson affidavit, and Mi
Smith and Mr. Dickson then compared the cert
ll -d copy produced yesterday with the original.
Mr. Wells then went on to speak of the legf
right of the department to make any rules In n
gard to the custody or their papers. All appllct
t;ons for officl.il papers must be made In writinj
stating the object for which they are wantec
As to the affidavit of Juror Cox, It wa

Mr. Cuppy said that they must be Judges as t
whether these papers would be material to thel
case. It will be time enough to decide this que;

The court suggested that the counsel for the df
feiise m ide iheir request for papers In due form.

juror tobrinkr cross-ex amined
Juror Tobrlner was called to the stand. He ga?
substantially the same account of the receptlo
by the Jury and the reading of Dickson's paper a
the others had done. Then Mr. Smith cross-ej
amlned him.
Mr. Smith.?State any fact which tended t
show an Intention on the part of Mr. Dickson t
corrupt the Jury.
Mr. Wells.?I object, because the witness 1
asked to Juige as to the effect of a fact.
The Court sustained the objection.
Mr. Smith.?Did Mr. Dickson do anything to li
fluence you?
Mr. Wells.?I object
The Court,?Let the witness state what Mi
Dickson said.
Witness.?Mr Dickson said to me that he did nc
wish to influence me. He was going to vote as h
fileased, and he wanted me to vote as I pleased
le recollected that McNelly did withdraw his oti
jection to the reading of the paper.
Mr. Wells.?What did MeNelly say?.
Witness.?He said that it was not right.
Mr. Wells.?You call that a withdrawal, d
you?
The witn?ss, under the questioning of the court
denied that McNelly had withdrawn hlsobjeetlor
and the witness said he meant by "withdrawing
that McNelly sat down without saying anythlL
more after he had objected.
juror m'lain's testimony.
Juror McLaln was then called, and said tha
after the Jury retired reference was made to ai
tempts to bribe the Jurors, and then two vote
were taken. A discussion on the attempts to brlt
occurred, and remarks were made by Tobrlne:
Ilolmead and others, and then Mr. Dickson
paper was readMr.
McNelly made the first allusion to the sul:
J ?ct by saying that he heard some of the Juroi
had been approached. He favored the reading c
the paper. He could not recollect whether M
Dickson offered the paper to be read or some on
asked him to read It After it was read some ii
tlmatlons were made that the paper was not tru!
and then Mr.Dlckson appealed in some way to th
Deity. He could not remember the substance <
the conversations which he said he had held at dl
ter^nt times with Mr. Dickson relative to th
paper.
Mr. Smith objected to the manner of questlonln
employed by the government couusel as an a
tempt to torture from him something against Mi
Dickson.
The court said that if the witness appeared t
be hostile to the party putting Mm on the stanc
or his memory was defective, the counsel had
right to question him to bring the lnformatloi
The witness did not appear to be hostile.
Mr. Wells then renewed his question in regar
to the conversations with Mr. Dickson. Furthe
objection being made, the court asked him If b
had any recollection of the conversations and h
said that he had not, although he was perfectl
willing to tell Gov. Wells anything.
the witness was cross-bxamined
by Mr. Smith, and said that he could not recollee
whether Mr. Dickson prefaced the reading of th
paper by saying that he did not wish to lnlluenc
the Jury.
Mr. Smith.?What is your Impression?
Mr. Wells objected to this question.
The witness went on to say that It wa3 a mer
impression, ana he would not like to say.
Mr. Smith.?Did it influence your mind?
Witness.?Not in the slightest
Mr. Wells.?I object
Mr. Smith.?The answer has been made.
Mr. Wells.?I ask that It be stricken out
The court directed the answer to be strloke
out. A similar objection was made to the questlo
i as to whether the reading changed the vote of an
man on the Jury.
Mr. Smith.?We don't want a narrow examint
tlon In this case. We are going to get at the trutl
if possible, and bring out everything.
Witness did not hear any Juror say that th
paper had influenced his mind. Neither did h
consider it as evidence. Mr. Dickson had neve
tried to control or Influence his vote, nor did h
en ieavor to ascertain how he was going to vote.
In answer to Mr. Wells, he said that he meat
by Mr. Dickson not trying to influence him, tin
he never atdied hlrn how he stood.
jcror murray ON TUB stand.
Juror n.T. Murray was then called to the stan:
and testified that Mr. Dickson took the paper ot
of his pocket and said that he would like to rea
it He had heard the paper read on street aboi
a week before the trial closed, and Mr. Dlckso
said at that time he thought It was an effort t
find out how he stood. Mr. Olcott and Mr. Coj
wuo were present said then that they did not be
lleve it. He did not vote the same way with Mi
Dickson on the question of guilt and Innocence.
Mr. Smith, in the cross-examination, asked i
other members of the Jury had anything to sa
about bribery.
The witness said that Messrs. McNelly, no]
mead and Olcott Rpokeof approaches. He did no
recollect what they said. Mr. Dickson had neve
endeavored to corrupt witness or influence hi
action as a Juror.
Witness did not recollect whether the two men
bers that objected to the reading of the pape
withdrew their objection before it was read. Ill
personal relations with Mr. Dickson had alway
been, and were still, very pleasant Mr. Dlckso
told him in regard to his vote that he voted ac
cording to what he thought was right, and wa
going tq stick to It
mr. smith then questioned the witness
about what Mr. Dickson said in court about th
! investigation of the bribery.
i "You were scandalized yourself," asked Mi
Smith, "were you not?"
"I was," said the witness.
"By the statements," continued Mr. Smith, "ii
the newspapers in the interests of the Departmec
of Justice.
Mr. WeilSL?I object to an insinuation thatth
Department of Justice has any papers in its ser

The question was ruled out
jcror olcott's te8tim0nt.
Juror H. A. Olcott was called to the stand an
his testimony relative to the Dickson papers wa
similar to the others. He substantiated Messn
Tobrlner, Cox and Holmead's statement in regar
to Mr^JMckson reading the paper to him on 4)
street before the trial closed. He then told hln
that he did not tblnk that government ever bribe
Jurors and that It was a Job put up by the defense
Mr. Dickson said he did not know but what it mlgh
turn out so or words to that effect The witness sal
that when objection was made In the Jury room t
Mr. Dickson's read'.nsr the paper, Mr. Dickson sali
he would act at the pleasure of the Jury. Ther
were two ballots taken on the reading, wltnes

his disbelief or the truth of the paper,and his neve
having heard ot the government bribing witnesses
Mr. Smith said, sotto voce, "That was before th
government became corrupt."
The Court?"Mr. Smith, I think that yon ha
better not make these running comments in th
testimony."
The witness said in walking with Mr. Dlckso
down 4x street in August he spoke very freel;
about the trial, and said that he thought It was
El iln case ; that these men were thieves and rot
^rs and ought to be convicted. Mr. Dickson sal
he thought so too.

MSmith asked if, when Mr. Dickson read, h
had a sinister expression, or looked like a heav
villain, or whispered.
The witness said that he did not notice any thin
of the kind. He had never tried to bribe hln
lie could not say whether Mr. Dickson said at th

House of Bep^Hmtative*.
The followtaf prbceedihgs took place In the
House after the repqrt la the flrgt edition closed:
Mr. Townsend,of Ohio offered a resolution, calllng
on the Secretary or War for the nam?a and
character or the particular objects referred to
in that part of the President's message, which discusses
the appropriations for rivers and harbors,
as likely to need additional appropriations at this
session; and the amount, which in his Judgment
ean be profitably expended during the fiscal year,
ending June 30,1884.T Referred.
cheap postage.
Mr. Caswell, of Wisconsin, offered a resolution
authorizing the committee on appropriations to
embody In the Post Office appropriation bill a
clause reducing letter postage to 8 cents. Adopted.
Mr. Kelly, of Pennsylvania, chairman of the
committee on ways ind means, offered the usual
resolution for the distribution of the President's
message, and the House proceeded, in committee
of the whole, to its consideration.
Mr. Holman of Indiana, moved to amend the
resolution by referring to the committee on public
lands that portion of the message which discusses
the delinquencies of the Pacific railroads In the
original resolution it Is referred to the committee
on the Judiciary.
Mr. Anderson opposed the amendment, on the
ground that the question presented was purely a
Judicial one.
Mr. Holman contended that the question involved
was as to the forfeiture of the land.
Mr. Robeson said that so far as he could find,
there was but one clause in the President's message
which referred to land grant roads, and that
referred to this state of things. There were certain
railroads entitled under acts of Congress to large
tracts of land, and then held on to their privilege
of taking them, but did not actually take them.
That was the evil referred to In the messaee. He did
not know that this was a judicial question, but It
was a legislative question whether It behooved
the United States to take any action. It was a
question as to whether the roads should be forced
to take those lands or to give them up.
Mr. nolraan then withdrew the amendment.
On motion of Mr. Williams (Wis.) the question
of the Hawaiian treaty was referred to the committee
on foreign affairs Instead of to ways and
means.
The amendment was lost, 51-92.
The resolution was then reported back to the
House and adopted as amended.
The House then, at 1:15, went into committee of
the whole (Mr. Walt in the chair) on the state
or tho Union.
The first bill to be considered was one refunding
to the state of Georgia the sum or fctf.OOO expended
by that state for the common defense of 177f.

ie e. d. Wright, as counsel, stated ho had been requested
by the family to be present, and asked if
J- there was any objection to his presence. He was
'9 told that there was not.
Mr. Frere testified that he was a brakeman, and
as he was coming down on the car about fifteen
mlnutej, past 7 o'clock, he saw the deceased about
r. ten or fifteen feet from him, as he Judged, on the
track; called to him "get off the track." orsoraeX)

n further particulars.
0 East Washington waB thrown into a state of ext,
citement this morning over the discovery of the
brutal murder of a young colored man named
Joseph Creek, about sSi years old, who lived on C
Lt street, between 10th and 11th streets southeast, as
y mentioned elsewhere In The Star. The case is a
( most mysterious one, as the man received his ln1
Juries last Wednesday night, and the police were
r not acquainted with the facts until only a few
a hours before the death of the Injured man.
A Star reporter called at the eighth precinct
i- station-house this afternoon and learned from the
,r officers the following facts: Last Wednesday
Is night (Thanksgiving eve) Mrs. Josepnlne West, a
8 colored woman living at No. 702 A street southn
east, gave a "cake raffle." The deceased, who Is
regarded by the police to be an orderly man, was
ks one of the guests. The crowd amused themselves,
as is usual on such occasions, by dancing and
singing until about 11 o'clock, when some of the
women charged the deceased with using In3ultB
lng and indecent language to them. He was
then ordered out by some of the young
r. men, but refused to go. A st uggle ensued, and
he was gotten out without being hurt much, but
he came back for his overcoat and overshoes. A
second struggle ensued, and Michael Taylor and
a Ultas. Peyton stood by Creek, and he could not be
it dislodged In the ordinary way, and the crowd
armed themselves with all aorta of weapons,
e Creek had his head spilt with an axe, and was
- badly beaten on the head with clubs, bottles and
other weapons. He was then thrown out, and
taken to Dr. Reynolds' office and had his wounds
dressed, and was subsequently removed to his
home.
As stated above, the police knew nothing of the
* murder (although It occurred near the'station)
i. until last evening, when lt was only learned by
d accident then Officer Lawler learned from a boy
, that there was p. man dying at the house occupied
* by Creek, and on making an investigation learned
* the above facts.

b The Transit of Venus*
d NOTES FROM THE NAVAL OBSERVATORY.
The weather this forenoon has been cloudy, the
sun being at times almost totally obscured. Con8
sequentlythe astronomers at the naval observay
tory have labored under great disadvantage In
observing the transit of Venus. Three telescopes
S were directed upon the sun. Prof. Harkness was
i. dissatisfied with the atmospheric conditions at the
e moment of first contact, and made no record of
n his observations. Commander Sampson and ProL
Frlsby, however, were better satisfied, and made
d their records. A perfectly satisfactory observae
tlon of the second contact was made by all three of
e these gentlemen. Up to 12:30 o'clock only about a
dozen photographs had been obtained, as occar
sional rifts in the clouds permitted an unobstructed
view of the sun; but at that time the
weather indications were more favorable for photographing
the later phases of the transit.
Fall from a Waoon.? Aboufr 12:30 this aftern
noon, while Henry Sullivan, a colored man, was
driving a wagon belonging to Matthew Yates, he
fell off the box of the vehicle injuring himself sei
verely, after which he was removed to the Em-'rt,
gency hospital, where Dr. Markriter attended
him and pronounced his wounds not of a serious
:- nature, atter which he was taken to the fifth precinct
to sober up.

The court briefly charged thorn as to their Il<
duties, saying that the business should be pre- 86
sented to them in a regular way; that it did not ttlJ
belong to them to send out for witnesses on mere c"
suspicion that a crime had been com- 00
milted. If they had knowledge of a crime
thpy might of themselves make Inquiry and present
the case, bir not on mere suspicion. He toi
cautioned them, as they hear but one side, that it foi
would not be well for them to originate prose- ap
cutions. He would not Invite their attention to do
verbal scandal, but the newspapers sometimes
contain slanderous articles which do much
harm, injustice, destroy the peace and happiness
of a family, perhaps lead to a breach of the peace,
and often from a mere word. On newspapers w<
there Is perhaps a full proportion of liars, ge
paid liars, who, to make their papers sell, r~
concoct lies. He thought thefrod should be held
over these gentlemen. He knew members of that ?
profession who were men of Integrity, but he had St
seen that in the past few years there was an lm- no
provement, and there was some noble examples de
among the writers. <je
On such a subject aB this the grand Jury had the tm
right to act. The court then instructed them as to po
their business, telling them to consider the weight a?r
of evidence.

on which the court la directed to charge the erand 11

The Outbreak in Concord Prison.?Inquiry pr
Into the prime cause for the punishment-of the Tt
score or more ol convicts In the state prison in
Concord, N. H., reveals the fact that the scheme
on foot, to mase trouble after the Thanksgiving an
provisions had been dispensed, was a partial as
success, although of short duration. Several of mi
the men at wont in the hat shop for the Waring po
Hat Company formed a temporary organization, m]
threatening to do but half the regular stint on ^
account of stopping overwork. They also
threatened to knock out the brains of any man
who should perform the regular allowance. At ^
conclusion of the day's labors each of the con- al
splrators picked out a man who had disobeyed 10
their commands, and each went for his victim in stJ
a demonstrative manner. The row was easily
stopped by the officials. A lew of the men
pitched upon were roughly used, but not wi
enough to interfere with their work yesterday, th
Those In confinement say there Is no more work ch
for them until the old custom of overwork is n0
resumed. The intention of the men Is announced sh
to be to create scenes that will lead to an in- th'
vestlgatlon, thinking by this means to have pa*4 do
privileges restored. tic

From the Philadelphia Press, to-day. ^
Olean, N. Y., Dec. 5.?The mysterious disap- thi
pearance of Angus Potter and Peter Manners, ^
two men well known in this locality and who wl
were formerly very wealthy, is reported. They Prl
were ruined during the recent flurries in oil. It wt
Is believed that they have committed suicide. <]
John Ford, a heavy operator at Pittsfleld, has agi
become a raving maniac through the loss of his Se<
fortune, which was swept away in a week. Ford ac1
has been taken to an asylum. His physicians la
sav reason Is entirely dethroned and there is ral
little hopes ot his recovery. The disastrous re- wa
suits of the great oil panic are becoming more
apparent daily. Hundreds of persons have been in
utterly ruined, or seriously crippled. The de- hii
moralization wrought in western New York and ?o
northern Pennsylvania equals that experienced an
by Jay Cooke ACo.'s failure. It is estimated that ar^
between ?2.000,000 and fo,000,000 have been '
lost during the craze. The greater portion of ' j
the profits arising from the movement Is pre- he
sumed to have gone Into the coffers of the em
Standard Oil and United Pipe Line companies. 4 "

at as to the causes ot demurrer they were no
Ml taken. If the plea that Mr. nitz was consu
neral was a proper one, then It was proper als<
set out that he was an alien, as It might happet
at a consul general was a citizen of the Unite*
ates. The averment of alienage was, therefore
t a separate plea, but an Important part of th<
scrlption setting forth the character of the plea
r. As to the other separate averments, on tb<
ce ot the plea, It did not appear; but his ap
Intment, both as consul general and political
ent, might have been made at the same time,
it, according to the stipulation of consul, th<
mmisslons being Introduced as part ot the plea
was shown that this was not the case, the ap
Intinents being made at different times.
GEN. BUTLER'S POSITION.
lodge Wylle said that Gen. Butler, in the courty
his argument, disclaimed for the defense anj
rentlon of seeking exemption under the appoint
snt of consul general, resting his claim solelj
l Mr. Hltt' appointment as political agent
idge Wylle thought It was within the power o
e court to overlook the fault, even If the ple?
?re double; but, after the disclaimer by Gen
ltler, he was Inclined to look upon the plea ai
Jld in form, without question. The question o
rmallty would only produce further delay, ant
>th sides expressed anxiety to press the case to i
ncluslon. So he would regard the demurrer ai
general demurrer to the substance of the plea
though counsel have disclaimed all claim o
lvilege, by virtue of defendant's character a!
nsul general, yet In the face of the pleading th<
urt would consider that subject.
NSUL8 AMENABLE TO THE SAME LAWS AS OCR 0W!
CITIZENS.
The court read from Lawrence's Wheaton as t<
e privileges of consul, maintaining the posltloi
at such officials were amenable to local law
le great weight of authority, the court said
pported that opinion of the law. He cited ai
tlnlon by Mr. Cushlng, supporting this view
;sldes that It was provided by the 7th article o
e treaty between the Swiss confederation and th
nlted States, adopted in 1855, that in their prl
ite and business character, consuls and vlo
tnsuls shall be subjected to the same laws am
>ages as citizens. The right to send a consul wa
iticeded to the Swiss government by this treaty
te condition being that a consul should be amen
)le to the same laws as our citizens. He though
len that It was perfectly clear, under the law o
itlous, that a consul or a consul general was no
itltled to the diplomatic privileges. It was de
ared In the constitution or the United States; 1
as provided that In all cases affecting ambussa
)rs, other publlo ministers and consuls, th
lpreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. ]
tls jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was an ex
usive jurisdiction then this court had no powe
proceed.
THE QUESTION OF JURISDICTION.
This question had never been fully and square!
et by the Supreme Court of the United State?
it. In his opinion, the great weight of authority
, well as reason, was against allowing the prlvl
?e, or holding that the Supreme Court has ei
uslve Jurisdiction. The Judiciary act of 170
.pressly conferred upon the district court
the United States jurisdiction ove
nsuls, showing that the Constitution In
bt"d the Supreme Court not with ex
jslve, but with concurrent Jurisdiction onl;
ptr consuls. As early as 1797, in the Unite
ates district court of Pennsylvania, the questloi
me before the court as tc whether this constltu
>nal provision conferred upon the Supreme Cour
elusive Jurisdiction over consuls, and the cour
died that it did not. Upon appeal, Ciller Justlc
iy decided that the Jurisdiction or the Suprem
mrt was not exclusive. In Mr. Conk ling's trea
? the same view was taken. The questloi: cam
tore the United States Supreme Court In th
se or Davis vs. Packard, 7th Peters, 276, and th
ipreme Court there, though not squarely deel
ng the cjise, sustained the Jurisdiction of the in
rlor court. The clearest and ablest opln
n on that side of the question that the cour
id found was that of Chief Justice Tane;
the case of GIttlngs vs. Crawford
which the eminent Jurist came to the conclu
)n that the Jurisdiction or the Supreme Cour
the United States in regard to consult was nol
elusive, but concurred with that of the clrcul
id district courts. The authority of the Penn
lvanla case reterred to had been very mucl
aken by some declarations by Chief Justlo
arshall In the case or Marbury vs. Madison, li
lilch he laid down some broad rules, by which 1
3uld appear that jurisdiction conterred upoi
e Supreme Court was an exclusive Jurisdiction
lis was not a case Involving & consul, but th<
urt, at the close or the long decision, decide*
at the court had no jurisdiction. In the case o
>hens, in Virginia, however, Marshall hlmsel
adlfled the rule he had laid down In this formal
se, and advised the proresslon that br,oad prln
pies laid down by a court must not be taken a!
ithorlty, unless they were culled for by the cas<
ider consideration Itself and applied especially
that case.
PRIVILEGES OF AMBASSADORS.
Judge Wylle thought that the Jurisdiction con
rred upon the United States was a Jurlsdlctloi
uchlng ambassadors, ministers and consuls a
alntlffs. Before the Constitution was adopte<
e privileges of ambassadors were as well settle<
they are to-day. The object of this provision o
e Constitution was to confer an additional Dtlvl
?e, and that was when an ambassador wished U
Ing a suit he could go at once to the Supremi
mrt of the United States. An ambassador eoul<
lng a suit If he chose before a Justice of th<
ace. It was held in a California case tha
e Emperor Napoleon could bring a sul
a U. S. clfcult court, which he did. All of th<
urts then were open to foreign ambassadors, bu
was an additional privilege to permit them t<
lng a suit at once in the highest court of th<
llted States. The same language employed at
ambassadors was employed as to consuls. Thli
aguage gave them a privilege as plaintiffs. Th<
ganlzatlon of the Supreme Court was unsulte<
try cases In the first Instance, in the most cases
iey had no machinery to sustain a prosecutloi
r crime. If foreign agents are liable to suit anc
osecutlon, it Is a very strong argument agalns
e jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, that tht
ionization of the court was unfitted to try th<
eat majority ot such cases. For this reason, h*
is clear that If Mr. Hltz intended to claim anj
lvUetres by his plea, the plea would not avail
lere was another branch of the case, though
at raised
THE PRINCIPAL QUESTION,
d that was as to the privileges of the defendani
a "political agent." Judge Wylle translated
r. Hltz' commission or letter of credence aj
litlcal agent, which was addressed to "th<
inlster of foreign affairs." This ofllce of political
ent was so connected with that of consul thai
lenever the one failed the other failed. He sup
sed the intention of the Swiss council wasu
tach this office of political agency In some waj
the office of consul. That view rathei
lengthened his conclusion that the whole plee
is a single plea and not double. He did not set
the letter the seal ot the Swiss Confederation,
te credentials of all foreign agents are attested
th the seal of the state. If it were the object ol
is paper to conrer upon Mr. Hltz a diplomatic
aracter It would have Deen according to rule, 11
t indispensable, that the seal of the federation
ould be attached to the letter.
Mter an examination of the law he had come tc
e conclusion that the privileges of an ambassar,
such as an exemption from suit or prosecum,
are inseparable from the diplomatic characr.
If an agent is sent from this government foi
y purpose not of a diplomatic character he was
t entitled to these privileges. He instanced the
tnmlssloners of AlaDama claims, who came here
>m a foreign land to adjudicate certain claims
tey had no diplomatic character and were not
titled to diplomatic privileges. So in regard tc
s high commission that sat here some years ago.
iey were sitting in a qua?l Judicial character,
iey had no business to transact in connection
ih the government of this country. If these
ivlleges depend upon the diplomatic character
lat diplomatic character had they here?
MR. HITZ ONLT A POLITICAL AGENT.
The whole of it was that Mr. Httt was.a political
ent^-a political agent to talic politics with the
jretary of State. He had no authority to transt
any business with the Secretary of State. The
ter of credentials gave him simply the title and
lk of political agent. By virtue ot this title he
? authorized to convey to this government an
ore&slon of high esteem and friendship and to
luest the Secretary of State to recognize Mr.Hltx
the aforesaid rank?not to do any business with

Ir. Barrett, rising, uggested to the court that

reached the foot of the mountains, and upon not

SEAL SKIN PANTS FOR SrpriR.

s started down the ravine and followed along the

- little headway was made. About 10 they started
a fire, boiled some water, and had another pleoe oC

u for another tulle, but rinding the walking so bad.
and there being no signs of game, witness thought

' noon before they irot across and srot In some sand
sp>ts. The wind had shifted to the southwest and

the sand spits
g A LARGE RrVER WAS REACUKD,

f About 10 o'clock a tire was made and some willow

the moss and snow were so deep that they would
go In up to their knees. They kept on until about

Paymeit of Awards ef the GarflaM
Hoard off AodlU
The awards made by the Garfield board at
audit will be paid some time- nesf
week. The modus operandi of these payments Is
explained by Judge Lawrence, president of ths
board, as follows: The statute provides that a tar
the e wards are made the board execute a oertlft
cate of the award made to each person to the Bso>
retary of the Treasury, who shall cause to he pall
to the several persons named therein, or tnetr
legal representatives, the amount so certified.
The practice of the Treasury department Is for ths
Secretary to refer an award to the first auditoc,
who states an account and makes a report to ths
first controller, who certifies a balance due to the
claimant, and on this a Treasury warrant Is lasnoA
in his favor and sent to the Treasurer, who thereupon
issues a draft in favor of the claimant upon
the presentation of which the money is reoetvet
