Cniune,
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18,1861.
ES* Congress has adjourned over to
Monday.
Our Washington dispatches express
the confident belief that the bill to confis
cate the property (slaves included) of rebels,
will pass Congress, and without unnecessa
ry delay, and by a majority that will make
a veto unnecessary, even should Mr. Lin
coln find objections to such a measure.
£3?* Warsaw Inlet, at which some of our
naval vessels have entered, and by which
they have drawn so near to Savannah as
to see the steeples of the city,is some miles
south of Tybee Island, and enters tbe Sa
vannah river above Port Pulaski. The
people have fled from the coast in hot
haste: even the gallant “ defenders’ 1 fell to
show themselves-, and if Gen. Sherman is
ready, with the branch expedition of 6,000
men that he had assigned to duty dse
where, the city of Savannah may be taken
and razed to the ground. We have it in
our power. The “blue jackets’ 1 have led
the way and had a look at the promised
land of Canaan.
GKf. HALLECK’S ORDER NO. 3,
In the House yesterday, Frank Blair read
a letter from Gen. Halleck, reference to
■which, in detail, will be found in our dis
patches. Gen. Hallcck expresses himself
ready to cany ont any orders that may be
given him, but claims for th& one in ques
tion a military necessity. What Gen. Hal
lock has already done in his department has
Inspired new confidence and hope, and the
latter largely in the direction of believing
that he will see the necessity of using every
means to prosecute the war, and the abro
gation of the order which turns back upon
the enemy a principal source of their
strength and power. From this letter the
inference is natural as to the paternity’ and
birthplace of the order, confirming our
earliest conviction that it lay with Gen.
Halleck himself to amend it.
ENGLISH NEWS.
The news from Liverpool, in relation to
the capture of Mason and Slidell, is not fa
vorable. But the evident disfavor with
which the intelligence of the capture was re
ceived there, is not unexpected, and is not by
any means to be considered as an indication
of the temper of the English people. Liv
erpool has suffered grievously by the war
and the blockade. Among her merchants
and ship-owners, a large number arc
avowedly in favor of the recognition of
the rebel Confederacy by the British Gov
ernment—in favor of anything that will
insure a revival ot the trade in cotton and
the opening of the American market; audit
is not wonderful that this affair of the Trent
should be seized by them as. an entering
wedge to be followed by direct intervention
in our affairs. When they ascertain,
as they will, that the law of na
tions. the decisions of their own courts,
and the common sense of mankind are op
posed to their pretentions, and that Com
modore Wilkes was exercising a right
which has never been denied to belligerents,
they will find occasion to recede from their
unenviable attitude, and wait awhile before
they force their “Ministry into another
American war.
MORE ACTIVE WORK DEMANDED.
The following, from the "Washington cor
respondence of the New York Evening Post
of the 10th, will be read with interest.
There is beginning to be manifested a gen
eral feeling that this war and its policy is
not for and with our military leaders, but
that the people have an interest in this
matter, and a right to criticise and super
vise the expensive work they pay for. Not
alone are the people of Kentucky “ heart
sick.” in the language of Hr. Holt. "What
is demanded is action, a movement, a wip
ing out of the rebellion by actual deeds.
And this must come. It has tarried over
long.
Mr. Joseph Eolt is on a visit to his home in
Kentucky, and has written a letter here warmly
approving the passage of re>-jlutiom» to place
Messrs. Mason and Slidell in precisely the same
situation that the rebels.have placed Colonels Cor
coran and Wood.' He says that the only way of
intimidating the rebels is to eho's them that the le
{Hamate Government U in earnest and will punish
treason. He further writes that the loyal
people of Kentucky arc heart-sick waiting
for an onward movement of the Union troops lii
Kentucky. It is no secret that Mr. Holt also
•askatbr an advance here jast as soon as the Gen
eral-in-Command considers it prudent to move on
ward: The political interests of the connin'. Mr.
Holt writes, demand most active vork by the Gov
ernment troops. This is the story told by almost
ah Kentnckv and Tennessee men mow here. They
assert that‘it will be impossible to keep up the
public sentiment in cither of those States to the
right pitch in favor of the government unless some
advance be made.
president Lincoln most fnlly sympathizes with
this view of the subject. Mr. Holt’s letter, alln
tied to above, was communicated to him, and he
avowed his opinion freelv that Mr. Holt was right.
He also stated that he had frequently expre**ed
tf,i* opinion to Gen, McClellan, it is well known
in Government circles here that the President and
Secretary Cameron favor an early advance of our
troops. ’
A VOICE FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
Massachusetts, who earliest sent her sons
to this war, whose troops at Baltimore lost
the first blood shed in this unholy rebellion,
sends through her Chief Executive, Got.
Andrew, an indignant protest to the Com
mander-In-Chief, asking that her soldiers
be not made slave catchers. They have
not left their homes to guard slave pens.
And this protest should be respected. No
word came from the brave old Bay State
when her best blood was poured out like
water in the carnage at Ball’s Bluff. She
will smother and repress her grief over de
cimated regiments that may come back to
her, and send fresh levies to take the places
of the fallen, in fight; but she does remon-
strate when her boys, armed with Spring
field muskets, arc set about no nobler er
rand catching and returning flying
fugitives. Gen. McClellan has promised,
so the dispatch says, to order Gen. Stone to
•desist. It was under this Gen. Stone and
in his division that Massachusetts loyalty
and daring have been put aimlessly, and
without result, to the severest test this war
has known, and from it they did not flinch;
but all that Massachusetts desires to inter
pose between her boys, and the officer ap
pointed to lead them, is tins one request.
It will be respected, as it should be. And
this is the sentiment of the entire army.
Our soldiers loathe the task of detaining
and returning the slaves of rebels. Do
these orders arise more from the sympa
thies of our commanders than from a set
tled policy controlling the war, "We hope
it is only the Conner, for the lime then will
all thf earlier arrive when our army will
fall to work to save the Union, and let
Slavery take care of itself.
In the House, quite a spirited debate
took place on the resolution concerning the
“ third order” of Gen. Halleck, commanding
in Missouri.
During the debate, Representative Fouke, of
Illinois, declared that it it passed, ail volun
teering in the State of Illinois would cease.—
WasJiihgtOTi Dvpatdi to the Chicago Times,
This man grossly slanders Illinois. Her
00,000 sons have not gone forth to the tented
field to send back slaves to their rebel masters,
ns Halleck’s order commands them to do..
They have not enlisted to save slavery, but to
stare the Union . “Put down the rebellion and
let slavery take care of itself” is their watch
word. Employ sword, torch, and confisca
tion, until the traitors lay down their arms
and submit to the Constitution and laws, is
tbo sentiment of Illinois and her brave sons.
Illinois demands that tile loyal slaves of rebel
masters, shall not- be sent back; Umt the Gov
ernment shall not continue to sacrifice the
lives and waste the treasure of the people to
guard, cherish and protect slavery for rebels.
Phil. Fouke basely slanders this patriotic State,
and he knows it.
VOLUME XV.
Gen. Buell’s Advance,
The advance of the brigades ot General Bu
ell’s army, in Kentucky, across Green river,
is probably but the forerunner of an advance
in force upon Bowling Green. The Cincinnati
Commercial says it had been, expected the
rebels would attempt to maintain themselves
on the south bank of that stream, but it is
evident they propose to fall hack on Bowling
Green, which they have been busily engaged
In rendering a Manassas in strength. Persons -
familiar with the topography of tliat section
say Bowling Green can he readily turned by a
flank movement, and that the rebels will have
to come ont and try a fair fight, or run,
The advance was required primarily to
guard the railroad, since an important bridge
over Bacon Creek was, only a few days ago,
a second time burned by the rebels, alter a
month’s labor in rebuilding it. They were
ordered to press forward as far as Green River,
and to cross it, if the coast was clear, and this
they seem done. Singularly enough,
after this bridge had been rebuilt, with a view
to the future use of the road in an advance on
Bowling Green, it was left wholly unguarded!
The irarso b«ing stolen, they have now has
tened to lock£the door. But did they expect
to advance on Bowling Green as an excursion
party in a railroad train ?
Shoepff and Zolllcoffer.
Reports from the Cumberland river disagree
as to the movements of the two armies of
Shocpff and Zolllcoffer, whether they arc on
the point of a battle or not. It is stated that
Zollleoflcr has advanced across the river to
attack Shocpff at Somerset; but this is initsdf
improbable, as he would then be fighting with
a river in his rear; and, besides, it is derived
by a statement that after haring thrown a
portion ofhis troops across, he recalled them
and was making strong Ms positions on the
south side. More troops arc being hurried
forward to the assistance ofShoepff, and It is
probable that the rebels, on their part, arc
backing up Zollkoffer. The next battle we
shall have to record, if a battle be fought any
where this winter, will be on the Cumberland
river between those two armies. They were
getting down close to the work at last ac
counts. A sort of preliminary skirmish took
place on the Bth inst., in which Isaac Gilbert,
of Company B, Capt, Stone, Soth Ohio regi
ment, was wounded, and finding escape from
the rebel cavalry impossible, threw down Ins
gun and surrendered. His captors murdered
him by hacking Mm over the head with their
sabres. The 3oth OMo will not take many
prisoners if they get a chance at the enemy.
In the same aflair one rebel officer was seen
to fall from his horse; and the road where
they went back was sprinkled with blood.
The letter writer says, “Wc can sec the en
emy’s camp-fires to-night. We expect a big
fight to-morrow or any day.” Major Hclveii
and Captain Prince, of Shoepff’s staff, had
been taken prisoners.
&T Frederick P. Stanton is making a bold
push for Jim Lane’s seat in the Senate, under
the claim that the latter has technically va
cated it to serve in the field, and that there
fore his (Stanton’s) appointment by Gov.
Robinson is good. It is an old quarrel between
Robinson And Lane, apart of which luis been
manifested by the election of Crawford, in
Kansas, to contest Gov. Robinson’s place.
The Lane-Stanton seat will be decided, it is
said, on Monday, but we do not sec how it
can be decided otherwise than favorably to
Mr. Lane. He has received no military com
mission from the Government or the State,
and has been serving in a voluntary capacity
without pay. He was indeed tendered a
Brigadier’s commission, and was about to ac
cept It, when Gov. Robinson came a snap
Judgment upon Mm. This changed his
mind.
JSf* Great numbers of Union men arc flying
from West Tennessee, especially from “Weak
ley, Carroll and Henderson counties, into Ken
tucky. They have escaped from conscription
in the rebel service, and arc desirous of taking
up arms for the defence of the Union. These
refugees represent the Union feeling in the
portion of West Tennessee referred to as
strong and growing; the people arc said to be
anxious for the arrival of the National troops,
and it was thought that a quite general up
rising would take place when aid should reach
that section. The Hon. Emerson Etheridge
goes thither from Washington at once, and
will probably bear assurances of coming as
sistance.
22T* A letter from a citizen in the western
part of North Carolina to a friend in Washing
ton passed the rebel lines, and was on Tues
day placed in the hands of Gen. McClellan.
It brings the clearest confirmation yet received
that there is a large and determined organiza
tion of Unionists in that Static. They arc
putting themselves in communication with
the Unionists in East Tennessee, and await
only the dawn of hope for a general rising.
They expect a reinforcement of Brownlow by
the National forces, and will accept that
movement as the signal for. their own action.
pT On the 7th inst., a serious, if not fatal,
accident befell Capt, G. W. Lattenstall of the
flag-ship Minnesota, at Old Point. A block of
wood, quite heavy, fell accidentally from the
hands of a sailor, which struck Capt S. on the
head, knocking b!m overboard. He fell a dis
tance of some thirty feet, alighting on a small
propeller alongside. So serious was the stun
and wounds received, that very slim hopes
were entertained of his recovery. Should tliis
painful accident result fatally, our Gov
ernment will lose one of its very best officers.
£grGcn. Banks's command and all except
Gen. Stone’s brigade of this military division,
and Col. Geary’s battalion, who are still posted
along the Potomac, have gone to the region of
Frederick City, and encamped in that vicinity.
About seventeen thousand are thus quartered,
but how long they will remain there is not
known. They have not yet arranged to go
into winter quarters. Some are of opinion
these troops will eventually unite with Gen.
Kelley, who is at present operating on the
Baltimore & Ohio railroad, near Cumberland.
The Navy Department invites propo
sals for furnishing, fitting and securing to
vessels-of-war iron plates fifteen and a half
feet in length, to have planed edges and coun
tersunk holes, to be bent to the shape of the
vessels from stem to stem, and fastened to
the timber with conical headed bolts of one
and a half inches in diameter. It is under
stood that the Department designs to thus
clothe the vcsscls-of-war with the least posal
sible delay.
In the Senate on Tuesday, Mr. Sumner
presented a petition from Francis A. Tread
way, setting forth that he had seme time ago
presented complaints to the Supreme Court
against Jeff. Davis and others, hut was told
they were improper papers, after he had pre
sented the complaint to the magistrate’s court,
hut with no effect. It was ’referred to the
Committee on Judiciary.
The minute and comprehensive report
of the Investigating Committee, of which
John L. Potter, of Wisconsin, is chairman,
now speedily forthcoming, contains a mass of
evidence as to the treason in office of a multi
tude of employees of this administration which
will shock and revolt the country. Groat will
he the fluttering when this report sees the
light.
jjr It is a noticeable change in phraseolo
gy that the Southern press now habitually call
the Federal soldiers “ferocious Hessians.”
Not long ago it was “ cowardly hirelings.”
This shows an improved perception based on
experience. _
A delegation of citizens of Eastern
Maryland waited upon Gen. Hooker recently,
to ask what would be done with those who
should return, and he replied that they would
be allowed to resume their positions as loyal
citizens on taking the oath of allegiance.
pT On Tuesday, a .pamphlet written by
Mr. Eilct, who has figured extensively as a
civil engineer, was placed upon the table of
each member of Congress. s lt contains a vio
lent assault upon Gen. McClellan, but a cor
respondent pronounces it scurrilous and
malicious.
|3f**Gco. H. Silts, of Chicago, has been pro
moted to a First Lieutenant, Company, B,
Major Barker’s McClellan Dragoons, and P.
Puricy Page elected Second Lieutenant of the
same company.
The Affair at Freestone Point.
A favored Washington reporter of the New
York Tima witnessed from a balloon on Tues
day the shelling out of the rebels at Freestone
Point:
, Six steamboats belonging to the upper flo
tilla were seen near the mouth of Matawan
creek. Presently, at half-past ten o’clock, the
Jacob Bell, Lieut. McCrea commanding, got
under weigh and went within about a thous
and yards of Freestone Point. She fired five
ten-second shells into the woods, and then
put about. Several wagons were seen ap
proaching the buildings near the shore where
the rebels had some stores. Lieut. McCrea, .
of the Jacob Bell, communicated with Capt.
Austin, commanding the Anacosta, and both
vessels then stood off Freestone Point,
where they commenced shelling the woods
and buildings. The Harriet Lane, flag
ship of the flotilla, Capt. R. EL Wyman com
manding, was stationed a mile or more be
hind. She fired two ninety-six pound shots.
On a line with her, and lower down the river,
were the Reliance and the Herbert, with the
Stepping Stones immediately behind, all in
the month of Matawan creek. This was
the position of the steamers, with a sloop
lying near, when the cannonade commenced.
For an hour and a half the two steamers pour
ed shell into the woods. From the balloon I
could see the shells burst over the tops of the
trees and near the surrounding buildings.
Some struck the residence of Mr. Fairfax,
situated in a grove upon the hill. Fairfax is
said to be a Colonel in the rebel army. The
wagons moved away as quick as possible, and
several mounted officers scampered off as well.
While the vessels were firing into thewoods
our gun’s at Budd’s Ferry sent a few shells
across. The rebel batteries directly opposite,
at Shipping Point, returned the'fire. Several
of their shells exploded on this‘side without
doing any damage, and one of ours burst right
in their upper "batten’. The rebels ran in
every direction.
The Jacob Bell then went close tothc shore,
and Lieut. McCrea, with four men in a small
boat, accompanied by another boat from the
Anacosta, landed and set fire to tbe buildings
near the water’s edge, wMch they said con
tained stores belonging to the rebels. One,
containing empty barrels, was not bumed.
The other buildings were soon enveloped in a
sheet of flame. They were formerly used as a
fish house, and rented for $3,500 per annum.
The boats presently returned to tbeir respect
ive steamers, which then fell back and an
chored near the Harriet Lane.
Gen. Prentiss at Work In North-west
ern Missouri.
[From the Quincy Whig, Dec. 10.]
Reported Capture by Gex. Prertiss. —
The St. Joe Journal of Saturday says that it
“wasveiy currently reported on the street,
yesterday, that Gen. Prentiss captured CoL
John R. Boyd’s whole command of rebels,
numbering 480 men. Wc do not know how
true it is; no donbt Boyd is about here, as wc
leam he madea speech atDeKalb last week to
500 men.” If true, we shall hear more about
it soon.
The Leavenworth Cunscn , aili t e, of the same
day, says: “On Thursday Gen, Prentiss left
St.' Joseph for Platte county at the head of
four thousand men and six pieces of artillery.
Before leaving St. Joseph he ordered every
citizen to take the oath of allegiance, or go to
work on the fortifications, TOO men came for
ward and took the oath.”
Gen. Prentiss made a speech to his soldiers,
in which he boldly stated that he went to
Platte county to end secession, and if devasta
tation was necessary it should be done.
From Benton Barracks* Mo.
A letter from Benton Barracks says
the 3d Cavalry regiment have received
their pay up to November Ist, and that
the hoys of company C caused $1,200
to be expressed to their wives, mothers, 1
children, <£c. This speaks well for company
C. The writer thinks that the whole regi
ment will send over 820,000 to lowa. On
December Ist, there were ninety-nine of the
regiment unfit for duty, fifty havihg the mea
sles, and the rest colds, erysipelas, <fcc.
A review of several regiments was held on
Thursday and Friday last, preparatory to de
parture, but whither was not known, though
Cairo was supposed to he the place, and tliat
among those to leave were three lowa regi
ments, and one or two Illinois. Some of the
lowa Second Infantry - thought they also were
to leave. The Third Cavalry' Regiment is fully
armed and equipped with carbines, sabres and
navy revolvers, and with full uniforms includ
ing extra caps and India rubber overcoats.
Bast Tennessee.
The New York Jbst’s correspondence of the
10th, says:
Senator Johnson, of Tennessee, is here, and
spent several hours with McClellan on Satur
day, urging upon him the propriety of pash
in gon the JFcdeml column of troops down in
toXast Tennessee, to the relief the loyal peo
ple there. He is to have another interview
to-day upon the same subject. The heartiest
sympathy is felt for the loyal men of Tennes
see, but the reasons which prevent immediate
advance upon Nashville arc purely militaiy.
These reasons will probably not exist two
months hence—they certainly will not in the
spring.
Skirmish in Cass County, Missouri,
[From the Leavenworth Conservative, 9th.]
On Friday last Mr. Etheridge, with thirteen
men, all of whom hod been driven out of Mis
souri. went back to Missouri to recover his
■ jcrsonal property. They met a superior rebel
; brec and deemed it prudent to return to Kan
sas for help. At Olathe, their numbers were
increased to 150, and with these they went
back to meet the foe. Skirmishing began as
soon as our men entered Missouri, and lasted
through that day and Saturday. Three rebels
were killed and five wounded. The hardest
fighting was in Cass county, nca# the Big
Blue, and not far from the Kansas line. The
rebels were completely dispersed, and the
Union refugees succeeded in regaining all their
property.
Mrs. Hartnnc at Albany—-Disagree
ment of Judges—Sbe Is Released.
Albany, Dec. 12.—Mis. Mary Hartung,who
has been in prison for some three years and a
half on the charge of the murder of her hus
band, by poison, and who has been twice sen
tenced to death, was to-day released from con
finement by Judge Wright, of the Supreme
Court, on proceedings brought before mm by
her counsel. Immediately after her release,
which was hailed with enthusiasm by a crowd
ed court, District Attorney Slueffcr procured
an order for a stay of proceedings from Judge
Peckham, and served the papers on the Sheriff,
who re-conveyed the prisoner to jail. This
coming to Judge Wright’s ears, he ordered
Mrs. Hartung to be again brought before him,
and entered judgment for her unconditional
discharge, disregarding the order of Judge
Peckham. She was then set at liberty and
was immediately conveyed off by her friends.
The affair created much excitement.
E5P* Great excitement was caused in Rich
mond by rumors of the advance of the rebel
armv on tbe Potomac, and anticipations were
freely indulged of a battle soon to be fought
between the contending forces. The Rich
mond papers call Gen. McClellan a coward for
not attacking Manassas, and call upon Jefil
Davis and the leaders of the rebellion to ad
vance and annihilate the Federal troops, and
relieve Maryland and Virginia of their presence
by the first of the new year.
f3P*The inevitable “contrabands” latest
report is, that on Friday there was a grand
review at Centrcville of seventy-five or eighty
thousand troops. He heard the last read by
Major J. B. "Walton, of the "Washington Artil
lery. There were at the review also one hun
dred pieces of artillery—all light, except two
24-pound howitzers. ’Gen. Beauregard com
manded, and President Davis reviewed the
troops. Generals Johnston, Longstrect and
Stewart were also there.
Says the Washington correspondent of
the N. T. Evening Fost of the 10th:
Troops still arrive daily in Washington.
Lost week twelve regiments came in. it is
expected that as many more will come this
week. Yet there is no fighting over the river,
and no immediate prospect of an advance. It
is rumored, however, that quite a number of
the troops here will soon be sent South to
operate along the coast.
fsy Says a private letter from Kentucky,
under date of the Bth inst.:
“Iknow by the movements that arc on
foot, that we are on the eve of a great battle;
and one, too, that will he the hardest fought
of this year, and the hottest fight ever known
in this country. There will be at least 350,000
men engaged at Bowling Green. Gen. Buck
ner (rebel) will have 100.000, and wc will have
150,000. The rebels will fight hard, for it is
life and death with them.”
There was a distinguished audience in
the Senate chamber, on Wednesday, during
the Baker eulogies. President Lincoln occu
pied a seat on the right of Vice-President
Hamlin, while the family of the President had
scats in the Diplomatic gallery. Senator Pow

few moments' conversation with Mr. Lincoln,

FROM WASHDiGTOS.
[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.]
Washington, December 12, 1881.
Officers high ih rank are renewcdly protest
ing against the present inactivity of the army,
aud arc urging an advance. The army is rap
idly losing what it has gained, iu this long
continued idleness.
Wm. H. Johnston, of the Lincoln Cavalry,
whose trial wc noticed last night, has been
sentenced to be shot, and will be executed
to-morrow at an hour to he fixed hy General
Franklin, the division commanded. His crime
is flagrant according to his own confession.
He entered the army in order to desert, that
he might thus reach New Orleans, where his
mother resides. In carrying out his plans, he
got beyond our lines, but mistaking our pickets
for the enemy’s, he ran towards them throw
ing up his hands and crying that he was a de
serter. They assured him that they belonged
to the other side, took his arms, and said that
he must prove his good faith by giving infor
mation. Thereupon he told them that
they could capture part of our men
behind him, where they really were,
and gave abundant details touching
our strength and position. He was taken
prisoner and court martialed as soon as possi
ble.
A private letter from an officer inFortPick-
eus, states that Col. Brown had all his -guns
shotted for two or three days, waiting until all
the rebel boats that habitually plyed between
Pensacola and the Navy Yard were safely
at the hitter place, when he opened
fire. The result was, two of them,
were sunk and others disabled. The
Warrington navy yard was burned. The flag
staff* of Forts Mcßae and Barrancas were shot
away. The loss of life among the rebels is
unknown. There was one killed in Fort
Pickens and seven wounded. Many shells
were thrown at its flag-staff, which was not
hit, although the rebel gunnery was unexpect
edly good. A shell, three days after it was
thrown into Fort Pickens, exploded, apparent
ly without cause, and killed six men, besides
wounding another.
Letters from Port Royal say that from our
vessels, riding at anchor in Warsaw Inlet, ten
miles from Savannah, the steeples of that city
are plainly visible. WcreGcn. Shcrmanready,
the city could he easily captured. Deserters
and contrabands bring information that all the
people on the coast have fled into the interior
except Crackers, who arc furious. One de
serter said that old Tatnall was so much affect
ed while telling of affairs at Port Royal to
some ladies at dinner, at the Pulaski House,
that he burst into tears.
In saying the other day that the majority of
the House in favor of Mr. Lovejoy’s confisca
tion and enfranchisement resolution, would
have been larger had another made the

that Mr. Lovcjoy was personally unpopular,

of making this war one to abolish slavery,
and had it been in his power to have
inaugurated civil war, and could he
have foreseen that the overthrow of
slavery would have been the result of that -
war, he would have not done it; aud it was
therefore unjust to charge upon any portion
of the Republican party that their purpose in
carrying on the war is to abolish slavery, al
though we are for destroying slavery if that
be needful in order to put down the rebellion.
He was at present content to confiscate
the property and liberate the slaves of
rebels. No one at the caucus expressed any
objections to this policy, and Messrs. Beaman
of Michigan, Julian, Colfax, and Dunn, of In
diana, spoke strongly in its favor. It is be
lieved that the measure, if vetoed, would be
passed by a two-thirds vote.
The Senate was occupied to-day with the
Naval Retiring bill, introduced by Mr. Grimes,
of lowa, The only debate was upon the ques
tion as to the time at which to turn the old
hacks out to grass.
In tlie House, Mr. Wickliffe and Mr. May
nard pictured the terrible consequences of
this -war to the loyal men of Kentucky and
Tennessee, speaking in support of a bill or
ganizing the Home Guards of Kentucky.
Mr. Eliot, of Massachusetts, made an hour’s
speech in support of the confiscation meas
ure. Both he and Mr. Steele (Dcm.) of New
York had too much to say about the causes
of the war. Mr. Conway, of Kansas, made a
thorough going Kansas speech, and had a
little tilt with Colonel Foukc, of Illinois, as
to whether the battle of Belmont was a de
feat or not.
Both Houses have adjourned tin Monday.
Senator Sumner read to Mr. Cameron, this
morning, a burning letter from Governor An
drew, remonstrating against the employment
of Massachusetts soldiers as “slave catchers.”
Mr. Cameron promised to write to Gen. Stone
to desist the practice.
The amendment to the Fugitive Slave Law,
of which Senator Clark has given notice, is
intended to deprive rebels of its benefits, by j
providing that the condition precedent to an :
application under it be proof of loyalty. The
passage of other laws may, however, render
its information unnecessary. ■"

Secretary Welles has withheld his approval
from the court martial's verdict acquitting

the Sumter escape from New Orleans. He
cannot be tried again, nor can the decision be

of inquiry, and by the Secretary, of gross
neglect and mismanagement.

THE PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
Washington. December 12,1861.
SENATE.
Mr. TRUMBULL, of Illinois, presented a
Setition to repeal the Laws which prevents
ewish divines from officiating as Chaplains
in the army.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts, offered a
resolution that the Inspector General, Quar
termaster General, and Commissary General
of Subsistence, be directed to inform the Sen
ate what articles ought to be sold by the Sut
lers to volunteers, and such as best would
secure their efficiency. He believed the whole
system should be promptly abolished. The
resolution was agreed to.
The joint resolution from the House, ex
pressing the feelings of Congress in regard to
the gallant conduct of the Late General Lyon,
was referred to the Military Committee.
Mr. FOOT, of Tt,, called up the resolution
to expel Waldo P. Johnson, Senator from
Missouri, from the Senate. The Clerk read an
extract from the secession speech of Senator
Johnson delivered in Missouri. The resolu
tion was referred.
The bill to promote the efficiency of the
navy reported by Mr. GRIMES from the Naval
Committee, was taken up.
On motion of Mr. DOOLITTLE, of Wis.,
the time of retiring officers was made 45 in
stead of 40 years' service. After further dis
cussion the bill was passed.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Tcnn., moved that so
much of the President's Message as refers to a
railroad to Eastern Kentucky and Tennessee
be referred to a select committee. The mo
tion was agreed to.
The Senate then went into executive ses
sion, and upon the opening of the doors ad
journed till Monday.
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES.
Mr. BLAIR, of Missouri, rising to a ques
tion of privilege, caused to be read the follow
ing extract as farther explanatory of the re
marks which he made yesterday on Mr. Lovc-
joy’s resolution, having in view the revocation
of a part of Gen. Halleck’s general order rela
tive to fugitives. The resolution, it has al
ready been stated, was Laid on the table.
Heaikjuabtees Dbp’t Missouri.
To Hon. F. P. Blair, Washington:
Yours of the 4th inst. is just received. Order
No. 8 was to my mind merely a military necessity.
Unauthorized persons, black or white, free or
slave, must bekept out of our comps unless we
arc willing to publish to the enemy
everything we do or intend to do.
It was a military and not a political order. lam
ready fo carry out mv lawful instructions in regard
to fugitive slaves which my superiors may give
me and to enforce anv laws which Congress may
pass: but I cannot make law aud will not violate
it. You know my private opinion on the policyof
confiscating the slave property of rebels in arms.
If Congress shall pass it. you mar be certain that
I shall enforce It. Perhaps my policy as to the
treatment of rebels and their property is as well
set out in Order No. 13, issuedthe day before your
letter was written, as I could now describe it.
Yours, truly, H. W. Halle ck.
Mr. LOVEJOT, of Illinois, replied, and in
conclusion said if any soldiers want to fight
simply for the purpose of returning fugitive
slaves, he (Lovejoy) had only to remark that
the army would be stronger without them.
Mr. BLAIR, of Missouri, from the Commit
tee on Military Affaire, reported a bill author
izing the raising of a volunteer force for the
better defence of Kentucky.
Mr. WICKUFFE, of Kentucky, who sev-
eral days ago introduced the bill, proceeded
to show the importance of passing it. Ken
tucky, he said, was to be *he great battle
ground of this war. The people of that State
hoped soon to see the day when the
invader’s foot would be expelled from
that territory, which is now invaded.
Property has* been ruthlessly destroyed
and carried off. Homesteads hare been made
desolate, bridges burned, &c.; and it is to
protect the State’while the army is marched
elsewhere that the volunteer force is required.
Mr. Wickliffe also said that he had received
from the Military Board of Kentucky an ur
gent application to call on the War depart
ment and ask for just such a corps as the bill
provided. He had brought the subject to the
attention of the President and Secretary of
War, and it met not only with their approval,
but of all the Cabinet.
Mr. MAYNARD, of Tennessee, spoke of a
recent sojourn in the part of Kentucky so
much ravaged and laid waste by the rebel
troops, and would allude at a future time to
the distressing condition of affairs in Eastern
Tennessee, which he had alone the honor to
represent. His people, he said, had been left
unprotected by the Government, notwith
standing their’ firm devotion to the Union.
Ho held’ it to be a duty not only to protect
loyal men in Tennessee and Kentucky, but iu
South Carolina, and everywhere, as much
so, as In Pennsylvania and the adjoining
States.
After further consideration of the bill, it
was postponed till Monday.
The House proceeded to the consideration
of the special orders, namely tbc various pro
positions involving the quasi ion of emanci
pating the persons held os slaves by rcbeli

State. Capt. Pegram and Mr. Tancey had re
turned from London together, and that the
latter states that it has been intimated to him
by a third party, that the “ Nashville” has
been recognized by the British Government
as a national vessel, and will be allowed to
refit and repair at Southampton, as was the
case with the “ James Adgcr,”soa3 to exercise
perfect neutrality between the two contending
parties.
Livebpool, Nov. 27.—Most intense excite
ment exists here to-day, under the intelligence
of the taking of the Southern Commissioners,
Mason and Slidell, from the British mail
steamer “Trent.” An indignation meeting
was promptly held, and resolutions were car
ried by acclamation, denouncing the insult
and calling upon the Government to maintain
the dignity of the flag. Some prominent mer
chants were against precipitate action, and
Bind the matter had better be left to the Gov
ernment The feeling of indignation, how
ever, was general.
Consols declined in London a half per cent
The ship “Helm,” from Charleston, ar
rived here to-day with a cargo of rosin and

The Hansa brings the London Times of the

ing in Liverpool. The following placard was
posted on ’Change:
'■'■ Outrage on the British fag—Soufhirn Consuls
forcibly removed from a British tnail steamer—A
public meeting will be held in the Cotton States
Room, at 3 o'clock."
The room was crowded to excess. The
chair was occupied by James Spence, who
read the following resolution:
Resolved, That this meeting haring heard with
indignation that an American Federal ehip-of-war
has forcibly taken from a British mail steamer cer
tain passengers, peaceably under the shelter of oar
flag from one port to another, do earnestly call up
on the Government to assert the dignity of the
British flag, by requiring prompt reparation for
this outrage.
This resolution was received with great en
thusiasm. The resolution was advocated by
the Chairman, who considered he was ex
pressing the-feelings of the people when he
said it was the duty of the people to press on
the Government the imperative necessity of
vindicating the honor and dignity of the Brit
ish name and flag. Mr. John Campbell con
sidered there was reason to doubt whether the
facts related and acted on by this meeting
were in reality a breach of international law,
and referred to opinions of the law of
ficers of the crown as being in some
measure inclined to show that such a
step, as tuken with respect to the Southern
Commissioners, was justifiable under the ex
isting state of international law, and he urged
the propriety of postponing the consideration
of the subject until to-morrow. Mr. Tow sus
tained Mr. Campbell’s views. The Chairman
suggested that to meet the objections of Mr.
Campbell to strike out the words “ by requir
ing prompt reparation for tills outrage and
thus amended, the resolution passed unani
mously. Several merchants expressed their
views after the adjournment that the meeting
and its action was premature.

■Washington, Dec. 12.—Letters received at
the Navy Yard, say Commodore Rodgers, on
the sth, left Tybee Roads, before daylight,
with the steamers Ottawa, Seneca and Pembi
na, and crossed the bar at Warsaw Sound.
The Federal forces approached Fort Warsaw
Island within one mile, and sent Lieut- Bumes
with a flag of truce, but found it deserted, the
guns removed, platforms cut up and maga
zines blown up.
Com. Rodgers states that everything had the
appearance of being recently deserted. He
also states that the battery on Little Tybee
would be useless.
The Southeast portion is a commanding
point for observation. The highest point
reached by Com. Rodgers was about three miles
from Warsaw Bar, about ten miles from Sa
vannah, and four or five miles from Thunder
bolt, on one side, and Montgomery on the
other..
From Washington.
"Washington, Dec. 13.—Gen. McClellan
has issued an order, directing the officers in
charge of the military prisons in this city to
confine no civilian who is not regularly com
mitted by a magistrate, and no soldier except
a deserter, or those arrested by patrols, with
out special orders from headquarters. This
will be the means of checking a very serious
offence.
About sixty gentlemen were present at the
Republican caucus. Finally the pending reso
lution of Representative Bingham was unani

tion of all property of the rebels in arms, and
all who aid and abet and the uncondi
tional emancipation of their slaves.

JQITHRIDGE’S XX FLINT
GLASS OVAL
CARBON OIL LAMP CHIMNEYS
The best that have ever yet been offered to the public.
They are the best for the following reasons:
I.—Because, being of an oval shape, theclass Uevery
vhere equally distant from the flame, so that the draft
la stronger and more regular.
2—The oval shape la belter adapted to resist the
effect of sodden expansion, so that it la impossible to
crack them.
3.—' The glass is made largely of Lead and Pearlaah,
giving a great degree of strength and elasticity. The
chimneys which housekeepers nave found to be so brit
tle as to crack even when not in oae, are Invariably
made of Lime Glass, instead of the Flint Glass, of
which onrs are manofactored.
Manufacturers and consumers of Carbon Oil, who
have felt the magnitude of the obstacle which has ex
isted in the great expense of chimneys, In the wav of
the universal use of them, have found a remedy la the
Oval XX Flint Glass Chimneys, which has materially
lessened the cost of Carbon Oil Light to those who nse
them, and increased the consumption of oil consequent
upon the lessened expense for chimneys.
