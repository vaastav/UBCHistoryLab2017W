In Bpite of the fact that an extra ses

saine; and they are hereby authorized

The third, is a bill
to enable
In... i- . ...
pi-upin oi mew .Mexico to form
a constitution aoi Klute ,,,,
cou.iuuuon una &ut? potcru-
ment, and to be admitted to the '.
Union on n tqnal footing with the
original States.

entire document, and though it is an

New Mexico's chances for admission to with tll0 ,,XL.,.ption of the chairman, is
the union are one in ten thousand, for i the chairman of a sub committee:
reasons that opposing congressmen do
not deem of sullicieut interest even to
state. It can not be the unde6irablo in
habitants of New Mexico that tho re
publican congressman bringa into con
sideration, siuce the majority of hia as
sociales are ready with open arms, even
instructed by tho president's message to
congress, to anuox the semi-civilized
half naked savages of tho Hawaiian Is
lands without tho faintest consideration
of whether they are man, beast, or devil.
It seems a question of poli ics rather
than color or conditions. If Now Mex
ico is eutittled to admission at all which
is a question for the careful considera
tion of the lax payers and investors of
capital in the territory, she will knock
iu vain so long as her politics are bo
evenly balanced with a per cent iu favor
of democratic majority, and the present
republican s'reugth continues in con
gress. Mr. Fergussou's bill for admis
mission after tho necessary prelimaries
of setting forth plans for territorial con
vention, representation, qualification of
delegatos &c, provides tor the adoption
of a state constitution, which shall be
republican iu form and make no distinc
tion in civil or political rights, on ac
count of race or color, except as to In
dians not taxed, aud not repugnant to
the constitution of the United States,
and tho principles of the Declaration of
Independence. Provision is mado for the
porfect toleration of religious sentiment
for citizenship, by a resideuco of CO days
instead of 1 year, for 77 delegates in
stead of 81 in tho constitutional conven
tion and the representation in the con
vention is increased; from 1,900 to 2,000.
Provision is made for the establishment
and maintenance of public schools by
tho donation of four sections in each
township of unsettled lauds. An ap
propriation of 100,000 reres of public
lands for tho improvement of the Bio
Giunde, 200,000 acres for tho state un
iveiBity, 100.C00 acres oach for an insane
asylum, school of mines, and other in
stitutions including tho agricultural
colloge. All title to unappropriated
public lands must be forever disclaimed,
and ad lands owned by Indian tribes shall
remain under the absolute jurisdiction
and control of the congress tf tho United
Statts. All debts and liabilities are to
lie assumed and paid by the now state.
Until the next consus, or until other
wise provided the state will be entitled
to one representative, which together
with tho governor and other officers
provided for in the constitution may
bo elrcted on the same day of the
elect on for the adoption of tho constitu
tion, all territorial ollicors to coutinuo 1
... i
iu churgo, till state officers are electo 1
and qualified under the provision of the
constitution.
