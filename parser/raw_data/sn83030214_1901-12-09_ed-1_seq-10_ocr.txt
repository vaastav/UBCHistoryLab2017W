THE WEEK IN WALL STREET.
•
Stock market trading was moderately active
in the week, while prices were generally firm
until Friday, when a decline developed that re
sulted in substantial net losses in the greater
number of issues at the close. Heavy specula
tive liquidation for pool account, sales on stop
order? by commission houses and vigorous pres
sure from the trading element were responsible
for heavy breaks in Manhattan. Amalgamated
Copper, and, in fact. In all the leading specu
lative issues. A shaking up process appeared to
be under -way. Outside of a poor bank state
ment there, were no adverse news developments,
he decline being based in great part on specu
lative conditions. Amalgamated Copper made a
mwlow record at *-*4"«. and predictions that the
stock -would s^ll at *>'• were freely indulged in.
While the selling in all railway shares was
heavy, there was no investment liquidation and
no evidence in the week to show that a long
period of declining values had begun. Indeed,
the character of buying suggested that a large
number of important interests were accumu
lating stock in the confident belief of an active
bull market this winter. Stocks sold found ready
buyer-?, and weak holdings were heavily re
duced. It was thought, however, that prices
might make further declines this week.
The President's Message attracted some out
side buying, but commission houses were dis
appointed that the effect of the Message was
not reflected in a larger inquiry from the pub
lic. It is quite likely that the recommendations
of the President will be cumulative in their in
fluence on the market. . At. least, it is generally
expected that the slight increase in the demand
for stocks last week will be followed by a grad
ually expanding market, based, in great part, on
the President's Message and responsive legisla
tion by Congress- "Wall Street was extremely
JT&tified with President Roosevelt's sober mind
ed, conservative and scholarly statements re
garding the country and legislation necessary
for its welfare, and brokers were particularly
pleased with th» President's treatment of trusts
and his recommendations respecting industrial
combinations. There will doubtless be no legis
lation of a harmful character against the coun
try's great industrial organizations at this ses
sion of Congress, for the simple reason that it
is not the administration's policy to interfere
with industrial property. Combinations that are
operating: on lines that restrain trade and check
competition will doubtless be proceeded against,
but the big concerns that havp been organized
in the last few years are not in this class. In
fact, they encourage competition, and are not
working in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust
law.
In last week's market there was a slight im
provement in the demand for industrial shares,
Including American Car and Foundry preferred.
International Paper preferred, American Loco
motive ana the Steel shares. The break in ;
Amalgamated Copper nas, of course, due to
causes that had no hearing on the general list,
although the capper situation induced bear sen
timent in speculative circle:- The greater num
.v?r of industrial shares are selling well under
their actual worth, and the prospects are that
In the- course of the next few months they will
be in demand at much higher quotations. Many
people have deferred buying these issues on the
absurd idea ih>t industrial combinations are
to be smashed by act of Congress. General
Electric made a new high record in the week.
and predictions K=eve indulged in that this stock
would soon sell above 300." In the discussion of
industrial shares it may be well to bear in mind
that Genera! Electric was once a very cheap
Issue, and that such veil known high priced
stocks as Standard Oil. Pullman and Singer
Sewing Machine once sold at bargain figures.
The idea that a stock like International Paper
preferred, for instance, will not some day sell
many points higher is not based 03 good knowl
edge regarding the prospects of industrial com
panies in this country. The cheap railroad
stocks and the sound industrial issues ought
to be features of the stock market This winter.
There -were few news developments in the
•week affecting the value of securities, although
there were various rumors respecting the future
of certain traction companies and general rail
way corporations. The traction shares, particu
larly Manhattan, wane heavily bought early in
the week, while in the general railway list there
■was a good demand for Rock Island. Canadian
Pacific. New-York Central. Pennsylvania. Louis
■ville and Nashville. Union Pacific and Atchison.
Foreign operations were light. In the London
market imney conditions showed no material
change, although the Bank of England pre
sented in its ■weekly statement reason for a
belief that gold exports direct to London from
this country may soon be made. In Paris ex
change on London was again lower, while in
the lecal market sterling rates were a trifle
higher. There was a good demand for bills in
this market, and indications appeared to pout
toward further shipments of the yellow metal to
France this week. The supply of exchange is
still too light to meet current requirements, but
the " offerings of cotton '-ills are increasing.
Money rates at this centre were firmer at the
close. The bank' statement showed a heavy
• decrease In cash and reserve holdings, and the
prospects of dearer money were thought to be
good.
Regarding gold exports, it is interesting . to
note that, despite heavy shipments in November.
the amount of gold in the country, including
Treasury holdings, decreased only $3,043,648.
while th? gold in actual circulation, including
gold certificates, decreased only $1,237,041. In
the month the amount of all kinds of money in
circulation in the United States increased
$3,555,688, and on December 1 the total amount
*n circulation, as compared with December. 1900.
'•bowed an increase of $91,494,866. of this
