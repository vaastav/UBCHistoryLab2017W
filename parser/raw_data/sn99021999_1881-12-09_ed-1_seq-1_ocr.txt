At 12:50 : o'clock Mr. Merrill called
up his bill for a tariff commission and
proceeded to address thereon. Ho
said that yesterday ho was so dis
couraged by the avaluhcho of bills in
tended to draw money from the treas

stead of rbduciug the duties they
should devote their attention to the
modes of raising more rovnucs , but
on reflecting that out of over 10-
000 .bills introduced at the
last session only from , (100 to

encouraged to go on. At the conclu
sion of Merrill's speech , which occu

tive tariff , Mr. Garland obtained the

sion bill. Ho , however , yielded to a

WASHINGTON } December 8. A
committee of eight , including the
New England senators and Congress-
Paul and Fulkorson ( of Virginia )
have called on the president in rela
tion to the election of a senator in
Virginia on the twentieth , and asked
if the present use of his name
in Richmond in favor of the readjust-
-era" candidate instead of a re
publican is by authority , and
old that Malionu was helping the
movement. Arthur showed perfect
familiarity with Virginia politics , said
ho thought the republicans were
entitled to a senator und thought
'Mahone would support a republican
candidate. Thu committee sent a
special messenger to Richmond to con
voy the words of the president to Ma-
hone. Paul and Fulkorson insist that the
logic of the recent campaign in Vir
ginia is tha * Lieutenant Governor-
Elect John F. Lewis , republican , is
entitled to ba elected senator and that
-the consideration promised the repub
licans for joining the roadjiutors was
ihoy should have the senator.

eon bo inudo in the head of the navy

BOSTON , M.ISS. , December 8. J
curious and unexpected result of tin
now system of gold transaction be
tween Boston banks has just come tc
light. Until within three weeks thi
Merchants' bank acted as repository
for all others and transactions were
carried on by means of certificates ,
but at that time the Merchants' bank
decided to refuse to longer assume tin
risk of storing $7,000,000 of gold ii
its vaults , and as no other bank wai
willing to undertake the task the sys
torn was given up and all transaction !
since hvo been effected by carryinj
coin from bank to bank. It has beet
found that this transportation of coil
is gradually reducing its weight ant
that if the practice is continued the
gold will within less than a monll
cease to bo legal tender. It is fount
that the average weekly dopreciatioi
of the 87,000,000 is 830 , or at tin
rate of $15,000 per year.

cage says I tnku wilhThim in regard tc
tins caso. I don't know the man and
the statement is fatso. ! '
Mrs. Julia M. NVilson , nicco ol
Abraham Guitoau , "jirho resides nt
Lcadvillo , was the Brat witness for the
prosecution , She staled her niothoi
nuvor showed nny signs of insanity.
One of her sisters was operated on by
a mesmerist in Ann Arbor , Michigan ,
and was BO much und r the iutluenct
that-any ono could operate upon her.
The witness could snip her on tin
street by simply hold ng up her fin
gers. . i
One of the jurors ( tiio colored man ]
complained of indisposition at thu
point and retired to consult a physi
cian. | i
Witness continuing , said : Possi
bly some unmannered boy called hei
sister. "Foolish Abboy. She nevei
saw any irrational conduct on thti
part of her mother up to the time ol
the death. Ono of her swim's was in
an insane asylum in Michigan. Hei
father was afilictod with softening of
the brain bcforo ho diod.
The pritonor was unusually quiet
during this\tfcstiinony \ , only interrupt
ing Judge Porter once when ho was
referred to as a criminal "that word
does not apply to mo ; I am no crim
inal. I was inspired by God to re
move President Garfiold. "
During the cross"- examination by
Scovillo , the witness said she did not
remember that her mother had any
objection to going i\p"stairs \ during thi
latter part of her lifoj-
'
John W. Guitoau ih'fected to "lug-
ing in parsons" who had no blood re
lation to the prisoner >
* Scovillesaid'hoob ' strenuously -
ly to John W. Guitoau interrupting
the proceedings with a view to show
there was no insanity.
The prisoner got excited , and jnmp
ing up and pounding the table , exclaimed
claimed : " 1 take thu same view. ]
wish John W. Guiteau would go bacl
to Boston. Ho has entered into thii
case to gain a little notoriety. Hi
has been n nuiimnco during the wholi
trial , lie in not of the counsel anc
has no business to open his head here ,
He prcanuu'B on the fact that ho is ol
the same name to make himself coiv
spicuous here. "
The prisoner's brother paid no at
tention to his harangue.
Geo. 0. May nurd testified ho hat
known tiio family of the tiruviout
witness for years and hud nevei
heard of any member being iimnu
Recess.
After recess , Frank B.irtlutl testi
fied ho know A ! r. a"d Mrs. Scovilk
and the prisoner.
Prisoner The only thing aboul
this is the witness met ma in thu sum
mer of 187(5 ( at .Scovillo'fl place. It
cost the government two hundred
dollars to bring thin witness here and
it is an outr.igo for the public funds Iu
be expanded in thin manner.
The witness said there was nothing
in the prisoner s manner to attract
special attention. The prisoner toflk
part in a tub race and conducted himself -
self as sanely as the other partiis engaged -
gaged in this recreation.
Florence R. Bartlett , wife of tin
Lint witness , said there was nothing in
Gnitcau's action or demeanor to indi
cate ho waa insane.
Howard 0. Dunham , of Boston ,
was called.
"This man doesn't know mucli
about me , " interrupted the primmer.
"Ho thought I was badly cranked
about my book. He looked upon il
as a literary curiosity "
Witness told about the prisonei
ongagini ; an oflico in Boflton , stating
ho would abandon theology Ho goi
out cards announcing himself at
"Coutmellor and attorney at law. '
Theology , the prisoner said to him ,
didn't pay.
Scovillo objected to evidence beitii (
introduced at this Htugo tut to thi
sanity or insanity of the prisoner ,
and claimed such testimony should
have introduced in the chief exami
nation.
The court overruled the objection ,
saying it is not worth while to go intc
particulars.
Scovillo Then 1would , like an excep
tion entered to any testimony offered
on the part of the prosecution tending
to show the inranity of the prisoner.
The witness did not regard the
prisoner insane.
Prisoner The witness was a Meth
odist minister and he did netlike my-
theology , Besides I had no money
and hu didn't like iny stylo. [ Laugh
ter. ]
Witness , continningjiaid ho had a
conversation with John W. Guiteau ,
who remarked there was no well au
thenticated cose of insanity in thu
Guiteau family.
Prisoner , excitedly My brother
has the miserable opinion that it
would bo a disgrace to the Guiteau
ti ( , ย . , i . - . . . . . . u ni n. f. , ) ( ,
insane. Two of my cousins nro in a'
lunatic asylum and probably 1 will ho
in ono teen , [ laughter. ]
Corklnll presented a communication
from President Arther in answer to
interrogations of the defence. The
document was not read hut submitted
to Scovillo for examination.
John Farmer , of Saratoga Springs ,
was the nrxt witness. Bi-foro ho wan
questinni'd the prisoner said , "I owe
this nun ten dollars for board. It
coat the government one hundred dol.
lars to bring him hero. I might have
admitted this fact and spared this ov
punno to the nation. "
Witness related the dilRcully ho
had in collecting a board bill trom the
prisoner.
Meantime Guiteau had read Presi
dent Arthur's amwors to Scovillo'R
HUeatitms and declared in an emphatic
manner they should bo published at
once. The document wa-j then read
by Scoville. The first question was :
"Do you know the prisoner in the
case J"
President Arthur answered in the
aflit mative. He had seen him tun or
probably twenty times around the ro-
i > uhlic.m headquarter * at the Fifth
Avenuu hotel in New York , but had
no conversation with him except in
ordinary salutation * of the day.
"What political service did the
prisoner render the republican party
duriiii ; the last campaign ? " Vroa the
next intarrog.ition ,
"Nono that 1 know of , " the presi
dent wrote in response , "and I do not
know- that there wo * anything in his
relations to myself , General Grant or
Senator Conkling that would entitle
him to beliuvu wo would assist him in
his political prelerompnt. "
PrisonerThat is a matter of
opinion.
The president added by way of
postscript that ho had received a let
ter from the pi isoner , asking for a
postponement of the trial , in order
to allow him to prepare his defense.
Uov. R. S. McArlhur , pastor of the
Baptist church of New York , waa
then called. Ho testified that the
prisoner brought a huter of admission
to him from thu Chicago church.
Guiteau complained of poverty , re
sulting from the Chicago tire , and
witness' heart went out towards him
and ho loaned him ninety-live dollars.
There was nothing in the prisoner's
manner to indicate insanity. Ho ex
plained the prisoner's wife represent
ed to him that herself nnd husband
would bo placed cm the sidewalk if
they could not raise a little money.
The priHonor wan expecting to get a
ministry nt that time. It was the
Swiss mission. It was expected
that , however , it did .not amount
to much , it was only So , 000 a year.
Witness then statcdthatthopriRonor
was brought up bcforo the committee
ef the church in regard to certain
immoral conduct. His wife claimed
she supplied him with money which
he spent witn other women.
The prisoner again became excited ,
stating that bin conduct in this regard
wa3 prompted by his doairo to procure
Butliciont grounds for a divorce front
'theAvomiiii'whow homarricd on 'ton '
hours' notice.
Corkhill said the government in
tended to show that what was claimed
to bo insanity on the part of the pris
oner was nothing hut outrageous de
pravity.
Thin remark was loudly applauded
by the aiidicnue and a young man who
ntartcd the demonstration wits put out
by an officer.
Witnew , in answer to other ( jut's-
tioiiM , said ho never regarded Guitcau
an insane.
Prisoner I have been strictly vir
tuous for six years.
Court adjourned at 3 o'clock to to
morrow morning when examination of
Mr. McArthur will bo resumed.
