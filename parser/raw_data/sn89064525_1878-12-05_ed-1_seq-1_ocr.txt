LITTLE FALLS, MORRISON COUNTY. MINN.. THURSDAY, DEC
Cruelty in the State Prison.
The St. Paul Globe of Friday last
contained two letters from persons jrho
had served IQ the State prison ft* StWk
water, and an interview with William
Hannegan, of Minneapolis, who served
as prison guard in that institution (or
some time. The statements of these
men are similar to the statement of
Patrick Coffee, referred to in our col­
umns last week and, if true, the man­
agement of the Stato prison is abomin*
able. Mr. Hannegan refused to give
a detailed statement, however, for the
reason that there will probably be
legal investigation, and he preferredi
to make his statement before a legally
authorized tribunal. According to the
allegations of the persons mentioned
above, as long as a convict is gfjod
health and works faithfully for ihe in­
terest of the contractors, or has influ­
ential friends outside the prison, he is
well used but if he happens to be out
of health and is unable to do the work
required, there is no mercy shown lum.
Our readers are doubtless aware that
the labor of the conviets is sold to Sey­
mour, Sabin & Co. According to the
statements made, the most cruel abuses
have been practiced in the prison for
years. For trivial or imaginary
offenses men who were unable to be
very useful to the contractors, were
thrown into the dungeon on a diet of
bread and water, or no diet at all, for
protracted periods of time. For any
degree of insubordination the guards
and keepers would begin to persecute
a convict without mercy, until the
man would actually expect to be mur­
dered. Coffee's assertion that one of
the keepers applied croton oil to his
(Coffee's) back for the purpose of
making a painful sore and putting him
in as much misery as possible, is also
affirmed by other «enviets who were in
the prison at that lime. It is stated
that frequently a convict who is so
unfortunate as to be disliked by the
keepers, is punished for being sick} or,
what is equivalent, is punished for not
being able to do the work that a
healthy man could do. We are of the
opinion that tSte State prison needs a
thorough investigation.
The St. Paul Globe.
The St. Paul Giobe is worthy of
commendation for giving publicity to
the complaints that have been made
about the- management of the Minne­
sota State prison at Stillwater, and the
asylum for insane at St. Peter. The
man who becomes a convict in the
State prison usually loses his friends,
and is at once stamped as an outcast.
No confidence is placed in his word,
no appeal of his can reach a sympa­
thetic heart, and the abuses and craej
ties which may be heaped upon hiin
must be -endured, with no friendly
hand to administer consolation or give
relief. And when his term of service
expires and he is again a free man.
even then he finds it impossible to
get a hearing, for he is only a '-State
prison bird," and nobody believes him
The newspapers reject his statement,
because they would lose money by in­
curring the enmity of the persons ex­
posed. This is one of the difficulties
that the poor and obscure will always
find in their way when they seek re­
dress for the wrongs perpetrated by
rings and corporations. Money con­
trols everything and the poor wretch
who seeks to expose an influential
ring, is dismissed at once. His right
to a hearing is measured by his capac­
ity to pay for it. Last winter, when
several persons who had been employed
in the asylum for insane at St. Peter
formally alleged that abuses existed,
the testimony of these persons was
discredited. It was said that they
were only seeking revenge for having
been discharged from employment at
tbe asylum. But the Globe insisted
on having a thorough investigation,
notwithstanding the threats made by
some of the interested parties to hegin
a libel suit against that paper.
A Senate committee was appointed,
a careful investigation was had, and
last week the committee made their
report to Gov. Pillsbury. It appears
from their report that every one of the
alleged abuses did actually exist that
"gross carelessness, cruelty and inhu­
manity" was practiced, in at least two
instances resulting in the death of the
patient that unauthorized and extrav­
agant expenditures were common
that $26,164.36 in scrip, bearing 12
per cent interest, had been issued by
the trustees without any authority in
law that the accounts of the asylum
had not been properly kept $ and that
the books show a deficiency of
$4,024.75, the examination of said
books having been made by Henry M.
Knox, public examiner, and three
other experts. But as bad as the fi­
nancial management of the asylum
has been, the "gross carelessness, cru­
elty and inhumanity" practiced tow­
ard the patients is far more reprehens­
ible. The insanity of the victim
makes redress impossiblej and if his
insanity happens to be of a nature that
gives offense to the attendants, he be-
comes the object of their wrath and
persecution. As stated above, we de«
sire to commend the Globe for espous­
ing the ?ause of the unfortunate men
and women in the asylum and the
State prison.
The President's Message.
The last session of the 45th Con­
gress commenced on Monday last, and
the President's annual message was
delivered on the same day. We pub­
lish tha message in full on the second
page. The President is very careful
to commit himself to nothing, and to
eonceal his opinions in a web of words.
If he has any opinions on any of the
leading issues, he fails to express them,
except in a very equivocal manner.
No person can reasonably complain
of the tone or sentiment of the mes­
sage, for it has but little of either.
That 50 000 Acrea.
The sale of 50,000 acres of railroad
land, which was advertised to take
place in St. Paul, Nov. 27th, was com­
menced on that day at the State cap
itol. When Kavanaugh, the auction­
eer, was just getting ready to begin
the sale, Gen. John B. Sanborn, the
attorney of the Western Railroad
Company, stepped forward and read
the following document:
"GENTLEMEN: For and on be­
half of the Western Railroad compa
ny of Minnesota, and as its attorney
and agent in this behalf, and by its
direction, I give notico that all the
lands offered or to be exposed for sale
at this time and place, are claimed by
the Western Railroad eompany of
Minnesota as equitably belonging to
said corporation, and to be subject to
a lien and charge to said corporation
for their full value for the completion
and equipment of said line uf road
from Watab to Brainerd, and that the
Western Railroad company of Minne­
sota has brought suit in court to re­
strain this sale, and to have its title
and interest in said lands adjudged
and deereed to be free and clear from
all liens, and that suit is undetermined
and wi'.l be prosecuted to final judg­
ment, and that notices of lis pendens
have been filed and recorded in the
office of the register of deeds of the
respective counties where these lands
lie, to save to the company any rights
that may be adjudged to belong to it
in said lands in said action or any ae
tiou connected therewith."
It was, therefore, understood tlmt
whoever bought any of the lands
would find it necessary to defend his
title in the courts. The most of the
lands were hid in by B. B. Eaton,
agent for DeGraff & Co.. at. prices
ranging from 10 cents to SI.55 per
acre. The sale was not finished on
Wednesday, and was continued on
Friday, at which time B. Eaton
bid in a large portion of the lands
offered, though several sections were
bought by L. Christian, about 4.500
acres by J. [I Davidson, and a small
amount by other parties, the prices
being about the same as on Wednes­
day.
Anti-Drive Well Association.
On Friday last a number of gentle­
men from different parts of the State,
organized a State Anti-Drive Well As­
sociation. Among other proceedings
the following article of agreement was
adopted
The undersigned associate them­
selves together as an organization to
be known as the Minnesota State As­
sociation, for the purpose of resisting,
by lawful means through the United
States courts, the pretended claim for
a patent on what is known as the
"Green drive-well." For a temporary
association, until all portions of the
State ai*3 represented, we will elect a
president, secretary and treasurer, and
also appoint a central executive com­
mittee,in numbers at the discretion of
the associaion, the duties of this com­
mittee to be the general business and
correspondence necessary to secure
co-operation of all interested, and
they shall have entire control of the
funds collected, which shall be depos­
ited in some bank at their order,
and which funds, unless used to con­
test the claim aforesaid, shall be re­
turned to the donors, except the suais
necessary fir our actual expenses.
Timely Notice Served.
There is a growing sentiment among
Republicans that a due regard for his
own reputation and the interests of the
party will soon compel Mr. Washburn
to take some notice of these dastardly
attacks and give their author an op­
portunity to provo his charges in a
court of justice. And we
serve timely notice on all concerned,
that theRepublicans of this district will
not much longer submit to the false
and slanderous imputations which tbe
Globe is daily heaping upon them and
their successful candidate.—St. Paul
Dispatch.
This threat of the Washburn crowd
to force the Globe into an expensive
libel suit does not frighten the pub*
lisher of that paper in the least. The
Giobe replied as follows:
"Bill Washburn would evidently
like to muzzle the GLOBE, and hence
his threat in the Dispatch of libel
5.18T8. NO. 14.
suit. The Dispatch thinks it is time
his friends insisted on sueh a proced­
ure. We trust his friends will con*
tinue to insist, and if he succumbs to
their wishes he will realizo the lull
source of the injunction, "save me
from my friends." The LOBE would
like nothing better than to meet Mr.
Washburn in a tribunal where wit­
nesses can be compelled to testify.
We doubt whether Washburn's friends
can induee him to face the music, and
we base this doubt upon the supposition
that he is not quite a fool The GLOBE
is ready, however, and will promise
him more amusement than he can ob­
tain in a lifetime in occupying pur­
chased Congressional scats."
The Asylum for Insaue.
The committee appointed by. the
State Senate of Minnesota last winter
to investigate the management of the
Hospital for the Insane, at St. Peter,
made thoir repoit to Gov. I'illsdury
on the 27th ult. The investigation
has been thorough, and the report
shows that a deplorable state of affairs
has existed for years in that institu­
tion. At the close of tbe report the
committee make the following rcoom*
mendations:
"In conclusion, the committee be­
lieve the best interests of the State
imperatively demand a change in the
board of trustees, and the treasurer
having demonstrated his incapacity,
should be suspended to protect the
State against further loss and extrav­
agance, and proper steps be taken to
collect from him the amount due the
State.
That the organization of the hospi­
tal be entirely remodeled by an act
clearly defining the powers and duties
of the trustees and officers, making it
a criminal offense for any of theua to
exceed tbe power given to them un­
der the statutes.
That the salaries of the officers and
compensation of the trustees, if any,
be definitely fixed by law.
That the appointing power, now
lodged with the trustees, having re­
sulted injuriously to the best interests
of the hospital, the authority to make
such appointments should be taken
from thetn, and the legislature should
enact a law requiring the executive to
appoint."
Terrible Accident in Douglas County.
From the Douglas'Count News.
Tuesday afternoon a party of six
men were out in the Crooked Lake
woods near Alexandria, hunting deer.
Two of the men, Ole Sward and Peter
Oleson were stationed on a runway
quite close together, but not in sight
of each other. Sward heard the dogs
coining in chase of a deer, and pretty
soon heard the deer, making toward
Oieson's stand. He immediately start­
ed and ran toward Oleson, and when
pretty close the latter fired at the deer,
which just came out in sight of him.
Oleson's gun was loaded with three
buckshot and a bullet on top. When
Oleson fired he killed the deer, but
one of the buckshot unfortunately,
struck Sward in the right side, and
passed right through him, H« was
wounded at three o'clock in the after­
noon, and was carried home and med­
ical aid summoned, but he died about
nine o'clock. Dr. Denniston, who was
called to see the wounded man arrived
only to find him dead. Sward made a
dying statement, in which he exoner­
ated Oleson, and in fact, the circum­
stances clearly show that but for
Sward leaving his station he would
not have been shot. Deceased leaves
a wife and six children at home, and
one married daughter.
Making Cheese in Anoka County.
From ibe Anoka Union.
To say that the farmer patrons, of
the Grow cheese factory are thorough­
ly disgusted, but mildly expresses it,
for every one of them have been
obliged to figure the profits on the
wrong side of the ledger, and the
farmers who furnished the most milk
are of course the heaviest losers. We
are informed that some of them estim­
ate their loss at over 8100 and some
as high as $200. To be sure, they
have on hand a large amount of cheese
but it is either an inferior article or
there is no demand for it. At any
rate, we have heard of one or two
farmers who traveled over Minneapo
lis and even St. Paul, yet could net
find a single merchant, who desired
the stuff, and disgusted, they unload­
edit at a commission house, with in­
structions to sell it for whatever it
would bring. The experiment of
cheese making by the farmers of Anc*
ka has been ao expensive one, and
they don't propose to '-cheese it" any
longer. Hereafter they will turn
their attention to butter making, which
they left off to participate in the cheese
business, and as all of them have the
reputation of making superior butter,
they will soon make up their losses.
A little girl at Hedy Fall*, Ontario,
while straying around the farm, came
across a young bear, and mistaking it
for dog, tied a string around its
aedc sad tagged it home.
