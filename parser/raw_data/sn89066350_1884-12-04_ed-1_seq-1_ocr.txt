countries and would the helter seivc tu main

The failure tf congress to make an appro
priation for our representation at the Auto-
nemeus court or the khedive has proved u
seriuiis I'mliarrassiiieut to our In .creoiir.ie.
with hgypt, and in view of the necessary in

the treaty powers in ah matler of adminis
tration therein HlTecting the riglits of foreign
ers, I advise tin- rot "nit ion of the agency and
cotiMiiale general at Cufro on its fi.rmer'hasis.
1 do not conceive it to he the wish of congress
that Hi- l'nitcd States should wlthdra al

have heretofore held with icspect to the
khedive, or that ellizens of this repuhllc re

With France the traditional cordial rela
tionship continues. The lt:ir:h')hll statue of
''Liherly enlightening the World," the gen
erous gift of the people of France, is expeeted
to reach New York m .May next. I mgje.-t
that "ougicssioual action he taken In relation
to the spirit which has promised this gift,
and in aid of Ihe t niely completion of the
pedestal upon which It is to he placed.
Our relationship with (Jcrniany, a country
which contr hutes to i ur own some of tho hvst
elements id citizenship, continue to he cor
dial. The l'u tied St a ten havo extradition
treaties with several of the tierinau states, hut
hy n'ason of the confederation of these stales
umler the Imperial nile, Ihe application of
Biieh treaties la not as uniform and compre
hensive as the Interests of the tno countries
require. I propose, therefore, to open nego
tiations for a s tigle c invention of extradition
to em 1 1 nice all the territory of the empire.
It nil 'pis me pleasure to say that our Inter
course wth (ire it ltritnin ioni ums to lie ot
the most friendly character. The government
ot Hawad has Indicated ft willingness to
continue for seven years the provisions of the
exlstlug reciprocity treaty. JSnch continuance
lu view of the retail ns of that country to the
American system of states should in my
Judgement te favored.
The revolution In Hayll I'galnst tt e cstah
llshcd government has terminated. While ft
was iu progress It hecame necessarv to enlorcc
our neutrality laws hy instituting proceedings
against Individuals ai d vcsels 'hnrg(l with
their infringement. These prosecutions were
lu all cuses successful.
Much anxiety has lately heen displayed hy
various European governments, and espec
ially hvthe government of Italy, for the aboli
tion of our import duties on works of art. II
is well to consider whether the present (lis-
1 criminnthms in favor of the productions of
! America-, artists ahroad In not llkelv to result,
i as tuey themselves seem very generally to he-
llevo it may, In the practical exclusion of our
painters and sculptors from the rich fields for
occupation, study and labor which they have
hitherto enjoyed.
There Is a prospect that the lomr pending re
vision of the fore gn treaties of Japan n ay be
concluded at a new conference to ho held fit
Tokio. While this government fully recng
ntzes tV.o equal and independent Mai Ion of
Japan in the community of nations, it would
nut oppose the general adoption of such terms
of compromise us Japan nuiy be disposed to
offer in furt'ieianeeof a uniform policy of in
tcrcourse with western nations.
During tho past year the increasing good
will between our own government und that of
Mexico has been variously manifested. The
treaty of commercial reclproca'ltv, coneludeil
January 20, 1883, dab been ratified, and awaits
the necessary tariff legislation of congress to
become effective. The legislation will, 1
douht not, bo among the first measures to
claim your attention. A lull treaty of com
mercial navigation and consular rights la much
to bo desired, aud such a treaty, I hive reason
to believe, that the Mexican government
stands ready to conclude. Bomo embarrass
meat has been occasioned by the failure ot
congress at Its last session to provide nieam
for due execution of the treaty of July 'Jtith, for
the re-survey of tho Mexican boundary, and
tea re location of boundary monuments.
With the republic of Nicaragua a treaty has
been concluded, which authorises the con
strue Hod, by the United States, of a canal,

The Spanish Question.
Thl government has more thnn once heen
called upon of late to take action lu fullillinent
of Its international obligations toward Spain.
An agitation In the island of Cuha hostile to
the Spanish crow n, having tn-en fermented by
persons nhusing the sacred rights of hospitali
ty which our territory affords the olliccr of
the government have Wen instructed to use due
vigilance to prevent the infraction of our neu
trality laws at Key West and at points near the
Cuban eoat. I am happy to say that In the
only instance where these precautionary meas
ures were successfully ehnhd, the offenders
were fouiu in our territory, and wen subse
quently tried and conwVleii. The growing
need of close relationship of Intercourse, and
traffic heiwcen the Spanish Antilles aud their
.uitunil market In the Tinted States led to the
adoption tu January last of a commercial
agreement looking to that' end. This agree
ment has since been superseded by a more
carefully framed aud comprehensive couven
f i ii, which 1 shall submit tu Ihe senate for ap
proval. It has been the aim of this negotia
tion tn opcu such u favored reciprocal ex
ch mgeof production, carried under the ling of
either country, us to make the intercourse be
tween Cuba and Porto 11 eo and ourselves
scarcely less Intimate than the commercial
movement between our domestic ports, und to
Insure a icuxivalnf the burdens on shipping In
the Spanish Indies, of which in the pant our
shipowner and ship masters have ?o often
had cause to complain.
The negotiations uf this convention have for
H time potpomd the iiroseeulhm uf certain
claim of our eilzens which we reeled a red to
be without Ihe jurisdiction of the late Spanish
American claim commission Hud which we
therefore reeoinmilti d to daplomatte channels

these claims w ill now he urged by the govt m

The (exposition Quest bui.
This government Is in ficnuem rcceint of In
vltallotis from fon fi:ii stab s to participate in
Inter national exhibition-, often of great inter
est and importance. ( " ciipyiinr as we do an
advanced position In the world's production.
and aiming to secure a pr libih'c share for our
liulu.i!rics in the cetieral competitive markets,
It is a mailer of serious concern Hint the want
of means for participation In these exhibits
should so oitcti cxeiudc ur priHiucts irom no
vaiiiaucs enioved hv those other countries,
During the past y ar the attention ot congress
was drawn to thi' formal iuvllatious in this re
gard tendered by the governments of hngland,
Holland. Iteliriuui. (ieruianv and Austria.
The. executive has In some instances appointed
honorary commissions. I his ts however a
most unsatisfactory expedient, for without
some provision to meet me necessary working
cxH'itses of a commission it can effect little,
or nothing, in heh.df of the exhibitors. An
International inventors' exhibition Is to he
held in London next May. This will cover a
Held of spicial impoi tance In which our coun
try holds u foremost rank. Hut the executive
is" ot present powerless to organize a proper
representation i-i our vast nauouai interests in
this direction. I have in several previous mca
sages referred to this subject. It seems to me
that a stutute giving to the executive general
discretionary authority to accept such Invita
tions, and to appoint honorary commissions
witlioiiUulary, ami placing at the disposal of
the secret ary'of state a small fund for defray
ing their de'inei reasonable expenses, would
uc ol great pumie tunny.
Foreign Murine Laws,
This government bus received official notice
that the reviM-d international regulations for
preventing collisions at sea have heen adopted
hv all the leading marine powers except tho
I nitca Mates, ami iney came into lorcc on itie
1st of September lust, for the due protection of
shit ml ne interests. The provisions of our stat
utes should at once W brought Into conformi
ty Willi uiese regulations.
The question of securing to authors, com
posers and artists copyright privileges In this
country ill iciurn ior reciprocal ngiua auruau,
is one that mav juatlv challenge, our attention.
It Is true that a convention will he necessary
to fully accomplish this result; hut until con
gressman by statue llx the extent to which
foreign holders of copyright shall be here priv
ileged, it tins been inadvisable to create such
conventions.
The Berne Conference.
For this reason the United States were not
represented at the recent conference at Berne,
I recommend the scope of the neutrality laws
of the United States be so enlarged us to eover
ull patent acts of hostility committed In our
territory, and aimed against the peace of a
friendly nation. F.xisling statutes prohibit the
lining out of armed expeditions and restrict
tho shipment of explosives, though tho en
actments In the hitter respect were uot framed
with regard to international obligations, hut
simply tor the protection of passenger travel.
All these statutes were Intended to meet spe
cial emergencies that had already arisen.
Other emergencies have arisen stuce., and mod
ern Ingenuity supplies means for organization
of hostilllicj without open rcBort to armed
vessels or to filibustering parties.
The Neutrality Laws.
I ace no reason why overt pcepa rations In
this country, for the comnrssion of criminal
acta, such aa are hero uuder consideration,
should not ho aline punishable, whether such
acta are intended to be committed in our owu
country, or In a foreign country, with which
we are at peace. The prompt and thorough
treatment of this question ts ono which Inti
mately ooncerns tho national honor.
The Question of Naturalisation.
Our existing naturalization laws also need
revision. Those sections relating to persons
residing wit bin the limits of the United States
ii 1705 and 1708 have now only a historical
utercst; section 2713 recognizing the citizen
chip of children of naturalized parent Is am
biguoua in Its terms and partly obsolete.
There are special provisions of law favoriug
be naturalization of those who serve In the
army, or In merchant vessels, while no similar
privileges are granted those who serve in the
navy, or marine corps. "An uniform rule of
naturalisation, aucb as the constitution con
templated, should, amoog other things, clearlv
tcfloe the status of persona born within the
United States subject to a foreign power."
Be wise to provide for a ceutral bureau nf
registry, wherein should be died authenticated
transcript of every record of naturalisation lo
the several federal and state courts, and to
make provlJonal.-ofor the vacation or cancella
tion ol Biicu rceoru in care wiierc irauu nan ;
been practiced unou ihe court hv the hp nil-
cant himself, or where he had removed or for
feited his acquired ctLZ-nshlp. A Just and
unlfoim law In this respect would strengthen '
t'ie liumis or the goverrment in protecting it
citizens abroad, and would pave the way for
the conclusion ur treaties ot naturalization
with forelgu countries.
The I'miMilnr Service.
The legislation of the last session effected
In the diplomatic and consular service certain
nanges una n'uueiions wntcii nave necn pro
ductive of embarrassment. The population
and Intermediate activity of our country are
steadily oti Ihe Increase", aud are giving rise
to new, varying und often delicate relation
ships with other countries. Our foreign estal
lisbment now embraces nearlv double' the area
f operations that it did twctitv vears vgo.
The coiitiuemeut ot such a service within the
limits of expenditure then estaSlistied is not,
It seems to me lu accordance with true econo
my. A eummunfty of sixty millions of people I
snouiu ie adequately reprecnieii in us inlet
course with foretgu nations. A project for the
reorganization of consular service or for re-
nsllngthe scheme of extra territorial tuns-
diction Is now before vou. If the limits of u
short session will nm allow Its full considera
tion, 1 trust vou wont fail In make suitable
provision for the present needs of th'.1 service.
It has heenTUHtomarv to define in lint appro
priation acts the rank of mch diplomatic
office to which a salary is attached, I suggest
tliut this course be ntMtidmicd, and Unit H be
left to the president with the advice and cmi-

The Silver Dollar.
1 eouctir with the secretary nf the treasury
In rccoiuendii'g the Immediate nipettslun nf
the colnatre of pflver dollars and of the isstt
mice of silver ccrtdleates. This is a matter to
wludi In former coiiiiuuuiciitinns I have more
than once Invoked the attention of thu nation
al legislature. It appears that annually for
the past six years there have been coined In
compliance with the nqitireiueiits of the net
of Fehruarv ls;s, more than 7,lC" 000 of
silver dollars. I he number now outstanding
Is reported hv the scerclarv to he nearly
1S5,(MXI,IHK. whereof but liille more thuu
40,iJ00,lH)0 or less than "ii per cent, arc In actual
circulation. The mere existence uf this fact
seems to me to furnish of Itself a cogent ar
gument for the repeal uf thu statute which hns
made such a fact possible, but there are other
and graver considerations that tend lu the
eainu direction. The secretary avows his con
viction that unless this coinage and the
Issuance of silver certificates Ih; subpeuded,
silver Is likely at no distant day to become
our sole metallic standard and the impairment
of the national credit that would Ihj thus
occasioned can scarcely he over estimated.
I hope that the secretary's suggestions re
specting the withdrawal "fr hi circulation of
the one aud two dollar notes will receive our
approval. It Ih likely that a considerable
portion of the silver mitv In the vaults of the
treasury, lufghttlnd its way into urretiey, while
trade dollars have ceased fur the present at least,
to be an element of active disturbance In our cur
rency system. The same provision should ho
made for their surrender to the government.
In view of the circumstances under which they
were coined and of the fact that they have
never had a legal tender quality, there 'should
he offered for them but a slight advance over
their bullion values. The secretary, In the
course of his report, considers the "propriety
of beautifying the designs of our subsidiary
silver coins, and of so Increasing their weight
that they may hear their due ratio of value
to the standard dollars. Ills conclusions in
this regard aic cordially approved.
The Abolition of Excise Taxei.
In mv annual messnge of lSJ 1 recom
mended the abolition of aM excise tuxcB except
those relullug to distilled spirits. Tho recoin
roendation Is now renewed. In case these
taxes shall Ih; abolished, the revenues that will
still remain to tho government will, in nu
opinion, not only suffice to get its reasonable
expenditures, brit will afford a surplus large
enough to permit such tariff reduction us may
seem to be advisable, when the 'result of the
recent revenue laws and commercial treaties
shall have shown in what quarters these re
ductions can be most judiciously effected. '
A Commercial Commission.
One of the eravest of tho problems which ap
peal to the wisdom of congress fur solution Is
the ascertainment of the most effective means
of Increasing our foreign trade, and thus re
lieving the depression under which our Indus
tries are now languishing. The secretary of
the treasury advises that the duty of investi
gating this subject be entrusted In the first in
stance to a competent commission. While
fully recognizing the considerations that may
be urged against this course, I am neverthe
less of tho opinion that upon the whole the
other would be. likely to effect speedier or bet
ter results. That portion of the secretary's
report which concerns this condition of our
interests cannot fall to command your atten
tion. He emphatically recommends that as an
Incentive to the investment of American capital
in American steamships, tho government shall
by liberal payments for mall transportation or
otherwise, lend Its active assistance to Individ
uol enterprise, and be declares bis belief that
unless that course he pursued our foreign car
rying trade must remain as it is to day, al
most exclusively in the bands of foreigners.
One phase of this subject Is now especially
Jromlncut lp view of the repeal, by the act of
une 36, 16S4. of all salutatory provisions ar
bitrarily compelling American vessels to carry
tho mails to aud from tho United States. As
it Is necessary to make provisions to compen
sate the owners of such vessels for the per
formance of the service after April 18, 1885, It
la hoped that the whole subject will receive
early consideration that will lead to the enact
ment of such measures for the revival of our
merchant marine as the wisdom ot congress
may devise.
The Three Fer Cent Bonds.
The three per cent bonds of the government,
to the amount of more than $1,000,000,000,
have, since my last message, heen redeemed,
hy tho treasury. The bonds of that issue still
OUO, about one-fourth of which will bo retired,
(hronh the operations of the sinking fund
.bun g the coming war, as these bonds still
continue the chiet imscs for the ciieuUtion of

that the la-v guvertilm: that matter exacts from

The Deling Expedition.
Tho bodies of Lieutenant Corhmnnder
(ieorgc W. Dc Long and his companions of
the Jeannettc expedition havo been removed to
the Uuitcd States by Lieutenants llarhcr aud
Hchullz. The remains were taken from their
graves In the Lena Delta in March, 1863, and
were retained at Yakutsk until the following
wiuter, tho season being too far advanced to
admit of (heir immediate transportation. They
arrived tu New York February U0, 16S4.
They were received with suitable honors.
The Grcely Expedition.
In pursuance of tho joint resolution of con
gress approved February 13. 1W4, a naval ex
pedition was tltted out for the relief of Lieu
tenant A. W. Grcely, United States army, and
of the party who had been engaged under his
command m sclent He nbservairous, at Lady
Franklin Hay. The fleet consisted of the
steamers "Sealers" ''Thetis," purchased lo
Kngbnd, and the ''Bear," purchHsad at New
ioumlland, and tho "Alert," which was gen
erously provided hy the British government,
Preparations for the cxiiedltlon were prompt
ly made hy the secretary ot tho navy, with the
aetiveco-opcratlon of tho secretary of war.
Commander George W. Collin was placed In
command of the "Alert," and Lieutenant W.
11. Emery In command of the "Bear." The
"Thetis" waa intrusted to Commander Win
field 8. Copcly, to whom also was assigned the
sunerlntcudeucy of tho entire expedition.
Immediately upon its arrival at Uppernavlck
the fleet began the dungcroua navigation oi
Seville bay, and in spito of every obstacle
retched Little Island ou June 23, a fortnight
earlier than any vessel had before attalued
hat point On the same day It crossed over to
Cape Sabine, where Lieutenant Greely and the
other survivors of the party were discovered.
After taking on board the living and the bodies
of the dead, the relief ships sailed for St. Johns,
where they arrived on July 17. They were ap
propriately received at Portsmouth, N. H., on
August 1, and at New York on Augusts. One
of the bodies waa landed at the former place,
uad others were put on shore at Governor's
sland, with the exception uf ne which was

forwarded then to the dentin; ton indicated

Postal Matters.
The report of the postmaster general ac
quaints you with the present condition and
needs of' the postal service. II discloses the
gratifying fact that the hiss of revenue from
the reduction In the rate of letter postage, as
recommended in my pritchimatloti Ii'ccmter,
lNKi. and effected by the act uf .March H, issii,
has been much less than was generally antici
pated. My recommendation of this reduction
was based Umu Ihe belief that the uetilal fall
ing otf In lecdnts from letter postage for the
vear immediately siiceccditiK the change of
rate could be 1.0(10,1 IK). It bus proved to be
only -,V.'Ti.iKW. 'I his Is a trustworthy Indica
tion that the revenue will soon be restored to
former volume by the national Increase of
sealed correspondence. confidently reM'.at,
therefore, the recommendation of my last an
nual message that single rate imx'tHgc timti
drop letters be n (hieed to one cent wherever
payment of two cents is now required by law.
l lie double rate Is only eneled at all iillices
w here the canter system Is In ot,iendtoti and It
appears that at the olliccs where the carrier
siteui Is In operation ami 11 npH-ars that at
olllces that the Increase In tax upon ne;d let
ters ilffruva the cost of not only Its collections
and delivery, but of thucol'cetiim nnd delivery
of all other mail matter. This is an inequality
that ounhl to no longer exist.
I approve the recommendation of the pnt
masti r general that the null of weight In the
rating of tlrst class matter should he one ounce
instead of one half ounce as it Is now. In
viciv of statist es furnf:d ed by Ihe department
it in.iy be well doubted whether the change
would result III uuy loss nf revenue. That it
woul i greatly promote the cmtvciiieueu of the
publie is beyond dispute. The I rce delivery
svsteiu has heed lately applied In live cities
and the bial uuiuiicr nf nlllces In which It is
now- in npeiallon is one hundred and tilt v nine.
F.vpnjeiice shows that its udoptlon under
proper conditions Is cquullv an accommodation
to the public and an advantage to thepostnl
service. Il is more than had sustaining and
for the reasons urged by the post master gen
eral may verv properly Ik extended. It Is llie
opinion of tli.it otlieer'that il Is proper to pro
vide means whereby exceptional dkpalch in
dealing with litters In free delivery oll'ice
may be secured by paying extraordinary post

'Ihe Mormon Question.
The report of the I'lah commission will h(
read with iniercst. It discloses the results of
the recent legislation looking tu the prevention
and punishment of polygamy In that territory.
I still believe-that If that abominable practice
can be suppressed by law it only can he hy th(
most radical legislation consistent with the re
straints of the constitution. I can again
recommend, theiefore, that congress assuuif
absolute political control of the territory ol
Utah, and provhlo for the appointment of a
commission with such governmental powers as
in its Judgment may justly and wisely put lute
their hands.
Foreign Trade.
In the course of this communication refer
ence litis more thnn once been made to the
policy of tills government as regards the
extension of our foreign trade. It seems
proper to declare the general principles that
should, In my opinion, underlie our national
elforts in this direction. The mailt conditions
of tho problem may be tlm stated: Wo arc
a people rich In mechanical pursuits and
fertile tn Invention. We cover a vast extent
of territory rich n agricultural products and
In nearly all the raw materials necessary for
successful manufactures. We havo a system
of productive establishments more than
sitititletit to supply even our demands. The
wages of labor are nowhere else so greut.
Tho cost of living of our artisan classes Is
6uch us tends to secure their personal com
fort and the developments of these hlphei
moral and Intellectual qualities that go to the
muking of good citizens. Our rystem of tax
and tariff legislation Is yielding a revenue
which Is In excess of the present needs
of the government. Those are the elements
from whldi It Is sought to devise a scheme hj
which, without unfavorable changing the con
dition of the worklngmen. Our ' merchanl
marine shall bo raised from Its enfeebled con
dition, and new markets provided for the sale
beyond our lairders of tho manifold fruits ol
our industrial enterprises. Tho problem Ii
complex, and can lie solved hy no single meas
uro of renovation or reform. The countries ol
the western continent, and the adjacent Is
lands, arc for the l'nitcd States thu natural
market of supply and demand. It Is from
them that we should obtain what wo do not
firoduce or do not produce In sufilciencyj and
I is to them that the surplus product of our
fields, our mills and our workshops should
flow, under conditions that will equalise or
favor them in comparison with foreign com
petition. Four paths of policy, seem to point
to this end : First, a series of reciprocal com
mercial treaties with ihe countries of America
which shall foster between us and them an
unhampered Interchange of trade, Tho condi
tion of these treaties should In the free ad
mission of such merchandise as this country
docs not produce, In return for admission free,
or under a favorable scheme of duties, of out
products, the benefits of such exchange to ap
ply on these goods carried under the flag of the
parties to the contract. The removal on both
sides from vessels, so privileged, of all ton
nage on dress and national Imports so that
their vcbbcIs may ply unhindered between out
orts and those of other contracting partlc
hough without Infringing on the deserved
home coasting trado, the removal or reduction
of burdens on the exported product of those
countries coming within tho benefiU of tbf
treaties (and the avoidance of the technical re
strictions and penalties by which our Inter
course with those countries is at present ham
pered.) Secondly. The establishment of the consu
lar service of the United States on salaried
footing, permitting the relinquishment of con
sular fees not only as respects vessels undei
tho national flag but also as respects vessels ol
tbe treaty nation earning goods entitled to
benefits of treaties. Thirdly, Ihe enactment ot
measures to favor the construction and main
tenance of a steam carrying marina undei
the flag of tbe United Statea. fourthly, the et
tabltsment of a uniform commercial (reatyfoi
tbe countries of America so that tbe coined
products of our mints mav circulate on rquai
terms throughoutthe whole system of common
wealth. This would require monetary untur
ot America, whereby tho output of the bullloi
Sroduclng countries and the circulation ol
lose which yield neither gold or silver, could
be adjusted to conformity with tbe population,
wealth and commerda! necdi of eaeft it mattf

The Tariff Problem.
The healthful enlargement of our trade with
Europe, Asia and Africa should he sought by
reducing the tariff burdens on such of their
wares as neither we nor the other American
statea are fitted to produce, and thus enabling
ourselves tu obtain In return a better market
foroursupplles of food, of raw materials, ami
of the manufacture- In which we excel. It
seems to ine that many of the embarrassing
elcmentsln the great national conflict between
protection and free trade nmy thus be turned
to good account, that ihe revenue may Ih-reduced

as well as to tho touch, nml giving
promise of dainty rest. I may add that
in no occupation is a woman more at

servile work of making up just such &
bed. Don't vou remember how the
heioiuo of 'felio Stoops to Conquer"

letting him viow her at such
housework P My advice to girls, iu
cases where a desirable young man
happens to be a guest in tho house, is
not to disdain all connection with
household b flairs, with tho Idea of im
pressing him with your too-goodncss
for that kind of thing, but instead to
lintl some excuse for becoming cham
bermaids, so that the visitors may boo

tho job is dono deftly it is a uro to be

beholds it. But there aro things
which aro dangerous for a girl to do
at home In the presence of her ad
mirer. Going upstairs is une of them.
It is easy enough to descend with
sprightly grace, but I defy any living
being iu skirts to ascend without
awkwardness. In tho current play at
Daly's Theater two of the acts havo
tor a scene an interior in which a
broad staircase leads directly back
from the roar. The characters go up
and down uncounted times. The
women aro personating fino ladies and
wear tho most fashionable of dresses.
On the stage level they are objects of
estimable regard; but the instant they
begin to mount those dreadful stairs
they becomo camels, elephants, any
thing that walks grotesquely with tho
hind legs. Thev wabble from side to
side, they strain evory gusset and
ream in their clothes, they threaten to
burst their corset-strings, their joints
seem to refuse all customary action,
and the outlines presented by their
backs bears no semblance to their nor
mal shapolinoss. It Is dear to my
mind that nature never intended that
women should go upstairs, for I don't
believe an angej, if feminine, could
mount the golden stair other than
absurdly. Clara Belie.
