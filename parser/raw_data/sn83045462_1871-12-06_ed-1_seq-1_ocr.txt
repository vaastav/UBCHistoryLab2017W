A Labor Br reap.? In the House yesterday

the committee on education au-J labor was

I artment of agriculture, in recognition of the

A Carers of republican Senators was held at
the Capitol this morning, and a committee con
sisting of Messrs. Buckingham (chairman), Saw
yer, Poroerov, Frelinghuysen and Ferrv was ap
pointed to report what revision, if any, should
be made in the standing committees of' the Sen
ate. No actum whatever was taken in regard to
making any change in the officers of the Senate,
and it seems to be the impression that none wil
be takes.

The Nicholas P. Trist Case Judge
Wylle, holding the equity term, heard, yester
day afternoon, arguments by Gen. B. F. Butler
and Thomas J. Durant in the case of Linns
Childs, wLo sues Nicholas P. Trist, now post
master at Alexandria, Va., for some $3,."500, his
claim for services in pushing through CongTess
a claim of Mr. Trist for services in negotiating
the treaty of peace with Mexico. The plaintiff'
sets lorth that some of his fsrrii'C consisted in
urging the claim upon Mr. Sumner's attention,
Arc. The defendant demurred to the bill,
alleging that, for reasons of public policy, no
right or action could arise from such a claim.
Jndge Wy lie held the case for future decision.
Postal Tele6rai'iis During the discus
sion In the lIoiM of Representatives yesterday
afternoon, on the resolution of Mr. Dawes re
ferring the several portions of the President's
message to the committees, Mr. Handall warinlv
opposed the reference of the subject of postal
telegraphs to a special committee, and con
tended that a standing committee of tli? House
was the proper place for its consideration.
Messrs. Beck, Farnsworth, Niblack and others
look the same ground, and were replied to l>y
Messrs. Dawes, Garfield and others. After con
siderable discussion, the subject was referred
to the Committee on Appropriation" by a large
vote. The friends of the change argue that
should the government purchase the telegraph
lines of the country nearly one million ofcdollar*
jtr annum can be saved In rents alone, as that
sum is now paid by the telegraph companies
for the buildings used by them, while the gov
ernment could. If it owned the lines, locate the
offiees in ?ost officcs, custom-houses, aud other
plibUc buildings.
The Natiobal Tobacco Cobykjitios met
at 11 o'clock to-day, in the parlors of the Metro
politan Hotel. There were only nine states rej>
ruentrd, many memlters who are expected tn
be present not having yet arrived. Vine Presi
dent l^wis II. Frayser, of Virginia, occupied
4be chair, with John Straiton. ol New York,
secretary. A committee of one from eaeh >tat?
represented was ordered to be ap|*>inted bv the
chair to make nominations for officers to serve
the ensuing year. Several communications
were received from absent members, all
recommending action towards a reduc
tion of the tax on tobacco to a uni
form rate of sixteen cents per pound.
Acting President Loring Palmer, Ksq., of Sew
j York, then read a carefully prepared address,
recommending a united effort to reduce the tax
on the borne production, but recommending tlie
continuance of the duty on imported tobacco.
On the Motion to adopt the recommendations
contained in the address, n discussion arose; the
cigar BMMiufacturing interest present opposing
the continuance of the duty. Finally a motion
was adapted to receive both the address** and
enter them mm the recorded proceedings for fu
itnre use. On motion ?T Mr. Bailev, of Hew
York, a committee of nine was -appointed to
prepare business to present to the convention at
a session to be held at 7 o'clock this evening.
Qbberal Sukrjiab's Recohmebdatiob*.?
Gcasral Sherman, In hisanraaJ repert, endorses
the recommendation of General Hallech that
the sphere of action of the amy tn gmmti civil
eases should be better defined by statute, bet in
Ike absence ef each statute we can only rely
apon the intelligence nnd mod sense of the
officers specially encaged. Thus for few mis
takes if any have been made, and the conduct
of the troops has aset the be arty approval of the
eonrts, the civil officers, and even the inhabi
tants againet whoa they have been compelled
to act
General Sherman also recommends that Con
gress "give the President the discretionary
power to keep the onm pontes up to a standard
ranging between sixty and one hundred privates,
according to the nature ef the service required
of the toaepe. Bach a measure would adn very
much to the efficiency, and would rarely if ever
carry the aggregate strength of the active army
above the i tsnifird ef thirty thousand men now
tied by law."
The Oenerd again earnestly reeommends
"the great necessity that new regulations be
Citk d for the government of the armv," and
mam aniform system of tactics be adopted,
embracing rsmmra principles for haMMng all
the arms of the service when brought under a
commander. The whole theory M army move
ments is based upon the foct that one respon
sible head should central masses of men, and
this cannot be done efficiently wi?ere one set of
tactics is used for lnfontry. another for cavalry
and still another for artillery.

The Secretary of State to-day transmitted to
the Senate the official correspondence u{>on the
subject of the retirement o.' Minister Catacazy.
The lirst letter o?" Mr. Fish to ilr. Cnrtin, onr
Minister at St. Petersburg, Is dated Jiiuo lOih,
and s. ?tes: " 1 am directed to Inform vuu that
the conduct oi Mr. Catacazy, the Minister of
Kusr-la lierc, l>oth official and personal, has for
some t.rne past bee n such as to materially im
pair Lis usefulness to his government, and to
rtnder interconre wtth him lor either busing
or social purposes hlghlv disagrceale. I'nder
these clrcumstanccs the President is ot the
e>p:nion that the interests ol both countries
would be promoted and those relations of cordi
ality with the government of the Czar, of the
importance of which he is well aware, would be
placed u|?on a much Mirer tooting if Uie head of
the Russian Legation here were to be changed."
Another letter oi Secretary Fish to Minister
Curtin, dated November 16th, last, states that on
bis arrival at Washington Mr. Catacazy gave
Komise of being a useful and very acceptable
inister, and made an agreeable impression.
Soon, however, he began to make him?ell very
officious, interfering in questions not appropri
ately connected with his legation and in those
I tending before Congr?-as, importuning Senators
and Representatives, and resorting to personal
interviews and solicitations unusual on the part
of the representatives of other powers accredited
to this government, distasteful and annoying to
the legislators thus indecorously approached,
and tending to embarrass the free course
of legislation on the subjects with respect
to which his Interference was obtruded.
He did not hesitate to use the newspai>ers of the
country to influence public opinion u|>on ques
tions pending before the government, and in
dulged in much licenm- In his denunciation of
measures and of individuals. In his conversa
tions he was even more severe and unrestrained
and employed abusive, vituperative lang'uige
towards very many persons, including several in
public positions and enjoying the respect and
confidence of the community. The improprlety
of a foreign minister thus attempting to influ
ence and to misdirect the pa bile opinion of the
country must 1m* admitted as sufficient ground
for bis censing to be a proper agent between the
government which be represents and that to
which he is accredited.
A dispatch from Minister Curtain to Secre
tary Fish HUiiounces that tlic n .juej?t for the re
call ot Mr. Catacaey bail wot been i?reseute*d, as
the Minister of Foreign Affairs was absent anil
the under Secretary thought It was a matter of
too much importance for him tu act upon. To
this Secretary Fish replied that the Bosnian
Minister of Foreign Affairs could be reached,
and it was important that the matter should Ik?
settled before the visit of theliraud Duke to this
country, as the President could not be expected
to receive as the principal attendant to his
iligliiu v ore who ha* been abusive ot* himvlt
and isrsonally unacceptable. Finally, the
Russian government requested that M. Cata
cazy lie tolerated here until after the presenta
tlon of the Grand Duke to the President, and to
I this reqoe-st our government acceeded. Hence
Mr. Catscsy ceased to refwesunt the Russian
Empire after the presentation. 9
