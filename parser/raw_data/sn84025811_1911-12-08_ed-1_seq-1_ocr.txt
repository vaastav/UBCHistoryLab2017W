SEATTLE'S ELECTIONS NON
PARTISAN.
The coining election in Seattle for mu
nicipal officials from mayor to councilmen
will be non-partisan. Any candidate for of
fice who is so at the behest of any political
party or organization can not legally qualify
for the office to which he may have been
elected. To become a candidate for a mu
nicipal office in Seattle twenty-five qualified
voters must sign a petition requesting A, B
or C to be a candidate for mayor or any
other office that is to be filled and file the
said petition with the city comptroller, who
will at once notify the person petitioned to
become a candidate and such person must
accept the same within ten days or the name
will not appear on the ballot. The names
of all persons so petitioned will appear on
the primary ballot. Where there are more
than one candidate for the same office the
two getting the highest number of votes at
the primary election will be declared the
regular nominees and though one of them
gets a majority of all the votes cast, yet such
candidate is only a nominee and must be
voted for two weeks later at the regular
election. That no one may be misled we re
peat, no one seeking official honors in Se
attle must do so as the candidate of any
party or such candidate is ineligible. This
is said in view of the fact a number of
mayoralty barkuses are being groomed by
party organizations. At her next election
Seattle will elect a mayor, a corporation
counsel, a city comptroller, a city treasurer,
three regular councilmen each for three
years and one councilman for one year to
serve out the unexpired term of Councilman
Steiner, who resigned, such member of the
council will only serve one year as Mr. Stein
er was elected for only two years and at the
election only one of his two years will have
been used up.
We all know that, if the present Congress
thwarts any attempts at economy, it will be
doing no more than it has been doing since
the mind of man runneth not to the con
trary. The very idea of associating Con
gress with economy is preposterous.
Two months ago The Seattle Republican
intimated Blethen's go free, owing to the
kiss and make up of the P.-I. and the Times,
and after reading last Sunday's P.-I. and
Times, we feel almost like saying. "I told
you so."
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON. FRIDAY. DEC. 8. 1911. VOLUME XVIII, NUMBER 40.

In holding the indictments against certain
would-be Alaska coal land grabbers valid the
United States Supreme Court has saved the
government's vast coal lields from the clutch
es of a syndicate of human hogs, who would
not hesitate to corral the air in order to
financially profit therefrom. It does not
amount to a tinker's damn whether any of
the men indicted are convicted since the
government's right to prevent syndicating
her natural resources at the expense of the
masses by knocking out the demurrer set
up by the defense and sustained by Judge
C. H. Hanford, was thoroughly established.
The next move of the coal barons will be
to keep Congress from authorizing govern
ment officials from developing the country
at the expense of the general government.
When the McNamaras plead guilty, the
most diabolical crime of the century was laid
open for inspection. "God works in mys
terious ways His wonders to perform," and
He caused that brace of foul red-handed
murderers to plead guilty that the monu
mental crime of the age would have no con
dolers as it would have, had the men been
found guilty by the ordinary process of law.
It, however, is the concensus of opinion that
the McNamaras plead guilty, at the be
hest of the "higher-ups," who, per
haps, are equally guilty before the
fact with the view of protecting them
selves. Organized labor as a whole may
not have been a known party to the McNa
maras crimes, but its actions in the past to
ward non-union workmen condoned those
crimes, and its effort to raise a half a million
dollars to defend the McNamaras without
knowing whether they were guilty or inno
cent is proof sufficient that they were will
ing and ready to resort to any manner of
violence to prevent non-union workmen from
taking the places of striking union men.
The last leap of the Sixty-second Congress
of the United States of America is being
spun off, the presidential election coming
next year with the House of Representatives
Democratic and the Senate and the Presi
dent Republican, with the Socialist assuming
a threatening attitude at the front door
of the national capital the presumption is
nothing but cheap politics will either be at
tempted or accomplished during the short
session. The Alaska question, which the
Progressives purpose making the paramouut
issue in Republican ranks for the presiden
tial nomination, will cut a conspicuous fig
ure in the present session. The tariff ques
tion will likewise be worked overtime by
both Republicans and Democrats.
President Taft's third annual message
was, as are all Presidential messages, full
of meet for thought, but the chief thought
COMMEJV T
in the message was the bursting of trusts.
There seems to be no denying that President
Taft purposes to throttle the trusts and
tho.se interested in that game fully realize
what they are up against, but they see no
way of bettering themselves by openly op
posing Taft, for, perhaps, La Follette or
even the immortal Teddy, if you please,
might fall heir to his shoes, hence they are
keeping still. President Taft is in a most
peculiar situation, he is charged by the la
boring people as being a trust protegee and
charged by the trust magnates as being of
a Populist turn and seeking to disturb the
business conditions of the country, hence
under the circumstances neither faction
really wants him to be his own successor.
His recent message, however, has to an ex
tent lessened common criticism of him.
Whether Governor Hay will or will not
call an extra session we verily doth not
know, but we are inclined to believe he will,
not because he will be convinced of its ne
cessity, but because he will hope to make
some political capital of it for his own can
didacy. The calling of the legislature will
mean at least the expenditure of $100,000
of the state's money and all for the sake of
sickly sentiment. A lot of claquers want a
Presidential preferential vote taken for an
advertisement for La Follette. The state of
Washington, in our opinion, is most decided
ly in favor of La Follette for President and
the members of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee should not hesitate to order
a.general primary election to elect delegates
to the various county conventions, who, at
the state convention, would select delegates
to the national convention, which convention
would take such steps towards endorsing
a Presidential candidate as it saw fit.
Not long ago the police department of
.Seattle raided a hotel and arrested a num
ber of persons, guests of the house, but in
their rooms, and so far as any one knew
obeying the law. The doors of many of the
rooms were kicked open when the occupants
refused to open the door. One room was
occupied by an .Alaskan hunter, and he was
awakened and told to open his door or it
would be kicked open. "All right, go to it,
but, if you do. there will be used of an un
dertaker's wagon as well as a patrolman's
wagon," and he immediately put his shot
gun in order for action. The bluecoats
smellcd a mice and looked for easier victims
nor did Chief Bannick fire or lay off the
men for not breaking open that particular
door though it was the only one of many
that was not broken open that night.
Everything seems to be a frame-up in Los
Angeles in the McNamara trial and the lead
ing citizens thereof. If the McNamaras
