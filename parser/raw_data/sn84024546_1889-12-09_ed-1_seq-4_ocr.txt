PITTSBURG. MONDAY. DEC. 9. 1889.
AH JKEFFECTUAL COMBIHATION.
The reported combination of the sup
porters oNew York, Chicago and S,t .Louis
a. the site for the "World's Fair against
"Washington, is not one that is likely to
demonstrate any great cohesiveness. It has
no merits in the natural conditions of the
issue, and it -will be certain to go to pieces
at the first stress of jealousy between the
. commercial cities.
In the first place the claims of "Washing
ton rest up on a very different basis than the
advocacy of either of the other cities. The
real choice is between locating the exposi
tion at a commercial center or at the center
of. government If the majority or Congress
deem it wise to make the exposition a na
tional afiair of such character as to keep it
under national .control, all the combinations
of the other cities will not prevail against
its location at the national capital.
On the other hand, even if a majority of
the Congressmen should not take this na
tional view of the enterprise, the jealousies
of the contending cities increase its chances.
"Whatever comuinations may be made, a
majority of the CLucagoans would rather see
"Washington get the Fair than New York,
and most of the New Yorkers would rather
see it at the capital ,than at Chicago. St
Xouis does not count for much either way, but
its advocates would xote to locate the expo
sition anywhere, if by"1 that means Chicago
can be beaten.
The combination is not likely to do much
unless it be to delay matters, and that would
be a great injury. The time is none too
long in any event Congress should settle
the matter promptly and let the chosen city
commence operations.
A JAMUIAB ASSUEAKCE.
It is pleasant to be assured by the new
Haytian Minister to the United States that
the people of the recently revolutionary
island are wholly contented with their new
Government; that there is no danger of any
further revolutions for many years; and that
the few dissatisfied persons are those who
lave been removed from office. But the
perfect reliability of these assertions is some
what lessened from their exact resemblance
to the deliverances of the people who obtain
ofnee under any administration. Even in
our own peaceful land, it is the regular
thing for the happy holders of offices to take
a roseate view of the political situation un
der any and all circumstances, and that
the only people who are not contented are
the miserable minority who have been
kicked out of office. It is natural to sup
' pose that the Haytians have had enough
revolution to last them a lifetime; but more
impartial testimony than the Haytian Min
ister is needed to make us certain oi their
utter and idyllic content
UNIQUE HISTORY.
It is rather interesting to read in the cable
dispatches of the historical learning dis
played by the young German Emperor, on
bis visit to Anhalt-Dessau, and then to
perceive in an extract from his speech a
reference to the old Prince of that house
"who was the teacher of the Prussian army
under my great ancestor, Frederick the
Great" It will strike most of those who
have read the history of the third Hohen
zollern king as very remarkable history to
call him the ancestor of the third Emperor
of the same race. All previous histories
nave credited him with dying without chil
dren, and leaving the kingdom to his
nephew. It will probably be no more than
just to credit the Kaiser with having used
the German word for "predecessor," and to
suppose the word "ancestor" to be slipped
in by the translator. But, in the connection,
the statement is almost as unique as the
semi-occasional newspaper references that
we see in this country, to "direct descend
ants of George Washington."
THE SILVER 1HXLST0NE.
There is one side of the silver question to
which neither the Secretary of the Treasury
nor President Harrison have adverted, and
'that is the intense unpopularity of the silver
dollar as a circulating coin. If there are
good reasons for continuing the mandatory
coinage of this ponderous inconvenient
coin and Secretary Wmdom, in his last
report, expresses doubts of the utility of the
coinage there can be no sound reason for
forcing silver dollars by the ton into circu
lation. The people feel this imposition of
an out-of-date coin more than the weightier
evils pictured by Secretary Windom as
likely to result from the present system of
mandatory purchase and coinage of silver
"by the Treasury.
If dollars must be coined wholesale let
them stay in the Treasury vaults, and their
equivalents in silver certificates pass out
into circulation. The burdens of life are
heavy enough, without adding to them
these millstones of silver. Paper money is
a modern requisite.
ELECTRIC DISPUTATIONS.
Cincinnati, Boston and Cleveland are all
experiencing trouble with the overhead
Vires for electric street railways. In two
of these cities the trouble has taken the
unique form of a contest with the telephone
companies, which reveals the usual corpor
ate idea of their exclusive privileges in the
public streets.
It seems to be pretty well demonstrated
that telephone and uninsulated high tension
wires cannot occupy the same streets in
peace and harmony. As the very nature of
the overhead electric railway system re
quires its wires to be bare, and as they
naturally occupy the leading avenues this
plays hob with the telephone wires. The
result is that the telephone companies claim
the right to shut the electric railway com
panies off, and the electric railways claim
it as their privilege to relegate the tele
phone wires to the back streets. The prac
tical assertion of each particular electric
company that its rights in the public'
streets are paramount, after pooh-poohing the
rights of the public to keep the streets safe
.and free from obstruction, ought to make
Kthmese interests IKat they hare no fighUj
at all in the street except what the public
toleration chooses to accord them.
The practical solution of the difficulty, of
course, lies in the burial of the wires the
high tension wires in one conduit and the
low tension in a separate one. If the under
ground system is not available for the rail
roads, they shonld turn their.attention to
the improvement of the storage battery
which when made a little more serviceable,
promises to be the complete solution of sur
face transit in cities. At least the over
head dangers should be removed, not for the
sake of preserving the interest of rival cor
porations but for the welfare and good of the
public
AN OLD BAIT.
. It is a singular but interesting fact that in
the investigation of the Greene county busi
ness complications, the old ten-per-cent-a-month
bait to catch gudgeons finally comes
to light It was to be supposed that, by
this time, every one except children and
persons deficient in natural understand
ing, was too well informed to be victimized
by such a shallow device; but it seems to
have been one of the successful inducements
by which the Greene county folk were
brought to invest more money than they
had, in cattle enterprises .of which they
could know little or nothing.
Of course, this is only a new illustration
of the way in which the specious promise of
large gains is readily snatched at by the
public. It is not much more remarkable
than the disposition to surrender hard
earned fnnds to the tender mercies of trust
speculators, corporate stock waterers, or oil
or gram manipulators, except that it is
more threadbare and easily seen through.
But it has been so often proved to be a mere
deception that it almost seems as if anyone
who is caught by such a shallow promise
must have been ambitious to figure in the
character of an easily-deluded victim.
It is to be hoped that, as is reported else
where, no one connected with the Greene
county troubles has been guilty of actual
dishonesty. But it is necessary to point out
the fact that if there were any pledges of 10
per cent monthly profits out of corporate
enterprises, they furnish proof presumptive
of a swindle.
SEOET HAIR IN FASHION.
While it is true that popular attention, as
evidenced by the popular songs ot the day,
has been diverted from man's hair to his
hat "Chippy get your hair cut," having
retired in favor of "Where did you get that
hat?" considerable interest must be taken,
in the proceedings of the Barbers' Conven
tion nowbeine held in Detroit We are not
as fully informed as to the doings of the
tonsorial artists in convention assembled as
we would wish to be but one result of the
deliberations' is clearly announced and it
alone is of immense importance. It is a
resolution ot the barbers to keep American
hair short
The resolution arose from a fight caused
by Figaro Louis Lassange's effort to have
the fashion of wearing the hair long in
dorsed by the convention. Mr. Lassange is
a cultured barber of Boston, and he argued
for a return to flowing locks on aesthetic
grounds. "When some one suggested that a
barber who proposes long hair throws half
his income away, Mr. Lassange rejoined
that any falling off in hair cutting would be
compensated for by the increase of sham
pooing which he reminded his hearers was
their greatest source of profit But all these
arguments fell fiat, and the short-hair ad
vocates carried the day by a vote of 28 to 8.
For the honor of Pennsylvania we are glad
to note that the delegate from Harrisburg,
Mr. Eastern Pittsburg does not appear to
have been represented voted for esthetic-
ism and long hair.
It will still be impossible to distinguish a
statesman from a pugilist by the cut of his
hair, the study of phrenology will be fos
tered, and the national head will not need
an enlarged hat yet awhile.
Queen Isabella's exclamation, "The
good God is no more on our side," when she
heard of the Brazilian revolution, does full
justice to the Deity, although it is hardly fair
to Dom Pedro to rank him on the same side
with the modern Messalina.
"Thk fact that Thb Dispatch inclines
toward Republican administration ongbt to
satisfy it with corporation preferences and In
dulgences." The above rather ill tempered re
mark from the Philadelphia Hecord may be ex
plained by the fact that its ties to a party or
ganization under the leadership of that self
confessed corporation representative, W. L.
Scott has satisfied it with corporation prefer
ences and indulgences to that degree of reple
tion which Induces dyspepsia.
Senatob Moody, of South Dakota, has
made himself a record early in his career by
getting his son appointed a pate in the Senate
at a salary of 12 50 per day. Bo far the youth
constitutes the most significant page in his
thrifty sire's record.
The latest phase of the attempt to shut
out dressed beef Is reported from "Virginia,
where a proposition Is pending to prohibit by
law the sale of fresh meat thathasbsen slaugh
tered more than 21 hours. As this is, of course,
inspired by the local butchers, it give's a new
insight into their methods to know that they do
not intend to let their customers eat any beef
that has hung a day.
Taking out a child's brain to remove
epileptic disease and replacing it successfully,
as is reported from Philadelphia, seems about
as far as medical science can go. But we shall
have to wait a good many years to see how the
brain pans out.
The discovery of a European scientific
man that the baccili which attack the hair fol
licles and produce baldness can do foiled by
using a mixture of cod liver oil and onion juice,
permits the remark that a stndy of the conti
nental hair oils points to the conclusion that
the usefulness of such obnoxious unguents was
discovered long ago. Most civilized people will
prefer baldness.
The statement that whisky is worth $25
per gallon in Alaska makes it pertinent to sug
gest to our. friends of the speak-easies that they
will find a splendid field for their enterprise by
moving to that far-off part of the country and
never coming back.
It looks as if there might be some relief
from the electric light wire peril in the decision
of the Louisiana Supreme Court that the com
panies are liable for damages' caused by loose
and derelict wires. It may not bo any special
mitigation to the people who are killed, to
know that their heirs can get compensation;
bnt it win tend to make the companies de
cidedly careful.
The new detail that the Brazilian revo
lution was brought about in the interest of the
army has a Praetorian smack about it that does
not promise a truly representative and consti
tutional republic.
Intelligence comes from Mexico that

BEAR-HUNTING IK JEESEI.
Brain Scares Bit Pursuers, Bnt Is Treed
nod Then Shot Dead.
Bridgeport, N. J., December a The farm
ers of Bridgeport have been annoyed all the
winter by the depredations of some strange
animal destroying the yonng pigs, and a watch
has been set by half a dozen farmers along the
railroad, but in vain. Peter Schlagg, the Jus
tice of "the Peace for Logan township, rode
over last night after Charley Maloney, at
Woodbury, late Assistant Collector of Internal
Revenue. Mr. Maloney had a double-barreled
Parker, loaded with No. 7 shot for rabbits.
Magistrate Schlagg had the good sense to load
one barrel with buckshot which later brought
in a supply of bear meat for both families.
By dawn yesterday the two gunners, with
two beagle hounds, were pursuing the fugitive
cotton tails a mile below Bridgeport. They had
bagged half a dozen rabbits, and as the hunters
passed the edge of an impenetrable cedar
swamp the evening train went rattling by. The
dogs came to a halt at the foot of a fallen oak
tree, and half way up the tree Sohlagg discov
ered a black bear. Bruin was as badly scared
as the hunters and tried to get further away
from the badly-frightened Nimrods. A' hasty
council of war was held and Schlagg insisted
on Maloney firing a load of rabbit shot at the
bear to bring him down the tree.
Maloney reluctantly fired and left the scene.
The dogs followed in rapid transit Mr. Schlagg
stood his ground, and as the bear came at him
open-mouthed he stepped aside and let drive
with the barrel loaded with buck shot, aiming
behind the bear's shoulder, with fatal effect.
Bcblagg fixed the other barrel in the air, and
Charley Maloney returned. Bruin weighed 180
pounds, and the two hunters carried their
trophy into Bridgeport.
In Great Eire Harbor. Atlantic county, there
have been traces found of three or four bears,

to return with at least one bear skin.
NO SUCH THIKG AS LUCK.
Wunnmakor's Word of Wisdom Addressed
to Sunday School Pupils.
SPECIAL TELEGRAM TO THE DISPATCH.!
Washington, December 8. When it was
announced that Postmaster General Wana
maker was to make bis first appearance in this
city in the role of Bible class leader to-day it was
naturally expected that there' would be a large
attendance on the occasion. As a matter of
fact, however, this was not the case. When he
stood up at 3:30 this afternoon to deliver an ad
dress to the Sunday school connected with
Gurley chapel, there were only a few present
who were not regular attendants, and there
were a number of empty benches. Probably
the reason for this is the fact that Gurley
chapel is a comparatively obscure place of
worship, situated near the outskirts ot the
town and the meeting place for the residents of
that suburb known to Washingtonians as Le
droit Park.
The Postmaster General was warmly wel
comed by those present He took as the sub
ject of his address "The Four-Leaved Clover,"
and. after telling his hearers about the won
derful properties formerly supposed to be pos
sessed by this plant, and the good fortune
which was expected to follow its discovery, he
went on to assure them that there is no such
thing as luck in the world, and that the only
sure road to success was by industry and econ
omy. It was a good address, business-like in
its tone and Presbyterian in its doctrine, and
no stranger' would have imagined from the
mapner of its reoeption that the speaker was
the Postmaster General of the United States.
Mr. Wanamaker expects to continue his Sun
day school work during bis residence in this
city, but has not as yet determined upon any
one place to which to devote his energies.
BTEAKGB SCENES IN A MIEE0E.
Remarkable Effect of a Tragedy Upon a

New Yobx, December 8. There is a large
mirror hanging on the wall of the store at 10
Fulton street directly over the spot where
Stephen Pettus fell after he had been shot by
Hanna B. Soothworth on the morning
of November 22. The mirror i3 6 feet
long and 4 feet high, and Is set in
a stout black walnut frame. It has
been there over a year. During that time its
polished face remained the same. Since Pet
tus' death a change has taken place in its gen

The quicksilver in the back has cut up pecu

about has formed the most weird figures and

ver "evolved Itself into a handsome
landscape; the next day the out
lines of a warrior on horseback could be' de
tected with a little imagination. More funereal
looking sights occasionally assert themselves.
One morning this week when the foreman
opened tho store in the morning he was greeted
with a battle scene in quicksilver.
Yesterday the picture of a Christmas tree
glistening like diamonds attracted a great deal
of attention. The clerks in the store look on
tho mirror with awe.

DISPATOH,:
THE CRITIC'S REVIEW.
Currant Articles by Messrs. WcstInEhoase
and Carnegie Divorce, by Gladstone
Other Magazine Contributions and tho
Varied Ideas They Suggest.
The Critic, as a loyal Plttsburger, begins his
reading of the December magazines with the
North American Review, and cuts, the pages
first at the articles by Mr. Westinghouse and
Mr. Carnegie. Mr. Westinghouse contributes
"A Reply to Mr! Edison;" Mr. Carnegie sug
gests -The Best Fields for Philanthropy." '
Mr. Edison contended in the Meview last
month that the only way to secure safety in
electric lighting is to prohibit the use of the
alternating current. This prohibition would be'
extremely interesting to Mr. Edison, for bis
plants are constructed with reference to the
continuous system. It would not, however, be
nearly so agreeable to Mr. Westinghouse, for
the alternating current happens to be
exactly the current which he uses. Mr.
Westinghouse, accordingly, comes to the de
fense of the alternating system. He says that
by the Edison system, which is patterned after
the manner of gas distribution, the same ten
sion which lights the streets lights the houses
also. This tension has to be pretty strong. It
is so strong that a tension of less than halt the
number of volts, If it happened to De turned
into a good-sized piece of beef, would roast it
completely in less than two minutes. By the
alternating system the voltage in the street
mains and In the house mains is quite differ
ent. A high voltage can be used in the street,
and an "absolutely safe" voltage in the house.
As a matter of fact, the extension of the alter
nating system as compared to-day with the con
tinuous system is in the ratio of five to one.
Mr. Carnegie suggests several excellent uses
to which rich men may put their money. They
can establish orlmaintain observatories, as Mr.
Thaw did, making possible such good work as
Prof. Langley's and Mr. Brashear's. They can
found or extend universities and technical
schools. They can provide libraries, like Mr.
Carnegie himself. They can build or furnish
hospitals, medical colleges,laboratories, schools
for nurses, music halls, swimming baths. They
can provide parks, like Mrs. Schenley, or con
servatories, like Mr. Phlppa, They can build
churches in poor neighborhoods. There are two
things which Mr. Carnegie objects to. He has
small regard for post mortem benefactions, ac
counting as of minor value what a man gives
away because be has no further use for it And
he decries the kind of -giving which leaves
nothing for anjDodyelse to do. Let the man
of money give the start,and then let everybody
who is interested help.
.
The "Question of Divorce" is still under f ruit
fnl discussion in the Meview,ilT. Gladstone con
tributing a brief but weighty article. 'The
New Method of Voting" is considered by Sena
tor Saiton, the originator of the Saxton bill, by
the Governors of Massachusetts and Connecti
cut where the plan has been tried, and by Gen
eral Mahono. Marion Hariand has a sensible
paper on the "Incapacity of Business Women."
There is a declamation by Colonel Ingersoll
upon the same old subject; set forth in the
familiar phrases, and accompanied by the usual
gestures. Mr. Ingersoll's utterances are getting
to be like the soup at second-class hotels, where
tlas cook is said to have a barrel of "stock," to
which he adds a spoonful of this and calls it
vermicelli, and a spoonful of that and calls it
consomme.
The Atlantic begins in Boston, with Mr.
Bynner's pleasant and sketchy recounting of
the history of "The Old Bunch of Grapes
Tavern," where Governors and parsons, patriots
and Puritans dined in days gone by. Bradford
Torrey, who reads his last year's diary of "De
cember Out-of-Doors," does not venture be
yond the sacred boundaries of Massachusetts.
But "presently we get as far away as Delphi,
whose scenery is graphically described and its
historical associations noted by William Cran
ston Lawton. who tells how the ancient fight
between a new and an old religion lingered in
the legends of the place. John Fiske tells the
stories of the massacres at Wyoming and
Cherry Valley, and notes the important posi
tion which Fort Pitt occupied, as the key to the
Ohio. N. 8. Sbaler thinks that summer schools
of science make the best way of spending too
longvacation. Henry Van Brunt has a thought,
f ul paper on "Architecture in the West" The
"vernacular1! art of the West is in a' transi
tional state at present, he says. He looks for a
distinctive American architecture. We are in
a position here to appreciate his comments npon
the attitude ot the United States Government
toward architecture. "The profession of
architecture," he says, "is not recognized by
the genera Government" The characteristic
of Government buildings is that they are
"easiest to design and most costly to execute."
Tolstoi's Shoemaker Martin finds a counter
part in Sam Kimper, the hero of Habbertou's
"All He Knew," which leads in lAppincotVs
for December. Sam Kimper learned shoe
making in tho penitentiary, where he also
picked up "all he knew" about the Christian
religion. The story shows how he knew
enough to keep him in the path of a good life,
to reform his family, and finally to "revive"
the whole town, even the deacon! William
Henry Bishop, in the same number, describes
his visit to Avignon, where the literary present
attracts him more than the ecclesiastical past
"Leon the Exile," is a little contribution to
the literature of the Siberian banishment
system. Charles Morris, in a paper on "The
Power of the Future," believes that wo will get
a deal more work, one of these days, out of the
sun, the moon, the water, the air, and the
lightning, than we do now. There are short
stories by'Robert Grant and Roswell Page.
An excellent engraving of Deviie's bust of
Thackeray aged 11 prefaces the charming pa
per which Thackeray's daughter, Mrs. Ritchie,
contributes to this month's BLUicholas. Let
ters and drawings, reproduced from photo
graphs, illustrate the article on "The Boyhood
of Thackeray." "The White and the Red," by
Alice Maude Ewell, is a Christmas story sup
posed to be told in the light of a Virginia
hearth-fire on Christmas eve in 1652. There is
a pretty picture by Birch of the Indian Simon
carrying the little girl Lillian across the brook.
"Little Avilda" is a Norse nursery tale told by
Prof. Boyeson. "By-and-By" and "An Autumn
Revel" are delightfully illustrated Frederick
Remington makes the pictures, for Theodore
Roosevelt's article on "Buffalo. Hunting."
Nora Perry's serial story makes a good begin
ning. Outing is as breezy as ever, and carries the
reader into many latitudes. The amethystine
trout of Mackinac, and the gentle alligator of
Florida, bicycles, cameras,guns, sails and snow
shoes claim a readily-given attention. "Fly
catcher" is proving an interesting serial.
"Wabun Anung" is the name of a capital
guide up in the Georgian Bay regions. W.R.
Hamilton discusses the "Merits and Defects of
the National Guard." "The Game of Curling"
is attractively set forth by James Hedley. R.
M.Hurd reviews the history of scientific row
ing at Yale. Margaret Bisland has a practical
paper on "Women and Their Guns."

Two fine portraits of the Duke ot Welling

got his name, it appears, from an iron steam
boat, which was called after hlin, and not from
any' severity of character. The letters here
given are pleasant revelations of the familiar
and social side of the great captain's character.
His fondness for children and theirs for him

Century." which was exhibited at the
Paris Exposition, give a description of
their work ,They conceived the idea
of making a colossal panorama, which should
be a review In picture of thelast hundred years
of French history, "a veritable tableau-vivant
of the great men and the chief events of the
century, evoked from out the past with all the
witchery of historical reminiscences." The
portraits of a thousand or more of the notabili
ties of France appear in this remarkable work.

an interesting paper on the days when the

there is but one remedy, and that is an awak

The Nun of Kenmare Quotes Dr. Hutchinson
In Her Defense,
To the Editor of The Dispatch:
The conversation which your reporter had
with tho Roman Catholic lady "who visits the1
Ursuline convent every day," is curious. It is
rather hard to be pronounced insane because I
have said what the doctor of the Dixmont In
sane Asylum has said, that Sister Gonzalez'
troubles bave been the cause of her insanity.
If Sister Gonzalez' family were insane, there is
all the more reason why she should not have
been subjected to treatment which has ter
minated in insanity. I know the rales of con
vent life very well, and if the Sisters received
her under such conditions they made a mis
take. I am not responsible for what Mother
Gertrude or "a lady' has said, I have simply
repeated whatlwas said to me by Mother Al
phonse in the presence of a friend, and what
as said to me by the French Sister and also
by Mother Gertrude's own sister.
The lady says that the Sisters who are under
censure get "the greatest freedom about the
place." Bnt later she says that "their meals
are carried to them." This shows that they are
not allowed to associate with the other Sisters,
and proves what' Mother Alphonse told my
friend, that they are not allowed the same
liberty as the others; that they are, in fact,
"sent to Coventry," to use the mildest term..
As I shall enter on these subjects fully on
Tnesday, 1 shall say no more, except that I be
lieve what was said to me by the three .Sisters
whom I conversed with, and who have a better
right to speak for themselves than any lady
who speaks for Mother Gertrude. I knew
Mother Gertrude's father, the well-known
London bookseller. I was not aware who
Mother Gertrude was until after my visit or I
would have asked to see her and told her who
1 was. M. J. CTJSACK,

THE CONGRESSIONAL PE0GRAMME.
Subjects to Come Before the National Legis
lature This Week.
Washington, December 8. The recent de
falcation in the Sergeant at Arms' office, and
the consequent loss or inconvenience to many
Congressmen, have been the engrossing ques
tions of interest around the House of Repre
sentatives during the past few days, and little
thought has been given to the course of busi
ness in the coming week. If the committee in
vestigating the defalcation completes its work
in season to make a. report to the House to
morrow, it will undoubtedly give rise to much
discussion, but the committee does not expect
to be able to finish its labors until some later
day. It is thought that a joint resolution will
be introduced and pressed to prompt passage to
provide for the payment of the lost salaries,
though there are intimations that this will meet
with determined opposition. The Committee'
on Rules has not yet held a meeting, and when
the House reassembles to-morrow, it will be
governed merely by parliamentary practice.
In former years it Was the custom to permit
Representatives to introduce bills before the
committees were appointed, but this led to
such confusion in the docketing of measures,
that in the FlftieibJCongress the practice was
discontinued and it is hardly probable that it
will be re-established.
There is reason to believe that instead of
waiting, as usual, to complete the entire list,
Speaker Reed will announce several of the
more important committees this week, in fact,
be has indicated to one or two members of the
House a strong probability that he will do so.
Until these are announced, however, short ses
sions and long recesses may be expected.
It is not expected that any business of importance-will
be completed in the Senate this
week. Bills will be introduced and referred,
and some of the committees will begin their
regular wort. To-morrow the Republican
Caucus Committee on Committees will meet,
and they expect to conclude the work ot re
arrangement at that session so as to report to
the caucus on Tuesday. Senator Voorhees
will, probably this week, call up bis resolution,
in accordance with the notice given at the'tlmo
it was introduced, declaring in favor of tariff
reform and make a speech in support of it
Action will probably be taken upon the nomi
nations sent in by the President last week.
These number 133, all recess anpolntments, ex
cept that of Judge Brower to be an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court
The holiday recess question will probably
come up this week for settlement- It Is be
lieved in the Senate side that the recess will
begin December 19 and end January 6.

Frank G. Carpenter's Pen-PIccares of New
Senators and Others A Rich Statesman
Viam the Black Hllls-Mlnlslcr Palmer
Likely to Resign Other Probable Va
cancies. tCOBEESPONTKtCSl OF TEE DISPATCH;!
Washington, December 7,-The Senate has
a new millionaire this session in the person of
Watson C. Squire, of the Btate of Washington.
Senator Squire Is worth t2,OQO,000, and his In.
come is $10,000 a month. He can spend S00.CO0
a season in Washington and never miss it, and
1 am told that his entertainments will be fre
quent and liberal. He will live at the Arling
ton Hotel, and his family will be among the
leading figures in Washington society. Sena
tor Squire was born in Ohio, has lived in New
York, and has made his fortune in Washing
ton Territory. He married into the family of
the Remingtons, the noted gun and typewriter
people, and it was some years ago that he
moved to Seattle and began to speculate in
real estate. He now owns bouses and lands,
and bis property increases in value every year,
and his buildings bring him In gold galore. He
looks more like a New York club man than
one of the newest ot the Western Senators.
He has the tastes of a club man, too, and bis
well filled out front will not be out of place
among the fat goldbags of the Senatorial cham
ber. He is a good talker, and a man ot ability.
I asked an Indiana Congressman, who knows
him well, to-night what kind of a man Squire
is. He replied: "Well, ho is a curious kind of
a fellow. He Is full o( good nature, has the
accomplishments of a man-abont-town, is a
good story teller, and is a combination of gen
erosity and the reverse. He will be ugly with
you as to the difference of 25 cents, and will
spend $25 ill champagne in explaining the mat
ter to you. They tell a story of a letter of in
troduction which Nicholas H. Owens once gave
Squire in introducing him to a friend of his.
This letter read:
My Dear Governor:
This will Introduce you to my friend Watson C.
Squire. You will find him a hog In little things
and a prince in big things.
Signed! NICHOLAS if. Owxxs.
"This story, however, is probably unfair to
the Senator. Like all good business men, he
has to watch the corners closely In his money
transactions, and he does not believe in mixing
up business and charity. I am told he Is one
of the most generous and charitable of men,
and that he believes in snendimr as well as
making fortunes."
S Senator From the Black Hills.
Another bright Senator from the new States,
who is considerably well-to-do, is Gideon C.
Moody, of South Dakota. Moody's home is at
Deadwood. in the heart of the Black Hills. He
is the leading lawyer of his State, and a good
share of the metals that come out of this
mineral region drop into his pocket in the way
of fees. I am told that bis income is at least
10.000 a year from his practice, and he is pos
sessed of lands and stocks. He is a straight
broad-shouldered, well-fllled-out man of about
SO years of age. His hair Is as white as newly
slacked lime, and there are silver strands
among the gold of his full beard. He tells me
that he was born in New York and that he
moved to Indiana at manhood, intending to re
main there for 10 or 12 years and then come
back to Washington as President or Senator
from the wild and woolly West Indiana, how.
ever, did not need new Senatorial timber, and
he never got higher than the Legislature. He
was in the Legislature at the beginning of the
War, and in the stirring times of 186L he
showed himself a bold and fearless statesman.
He left Indiana for Dakota about 23 years ago,
and when he settled with his familv on a farm
Inst outside of Yankton his neighbors in the
village thought him foolhardy on account of
the danger from the Indians. There was no
house between him and the north cole, and the
only signs of civilization were in the town near
by. This farm of Senator Moody's is now di.
videdup into building lots. He paid J3 an
acre for it, and it is now worth more than S100,
009. I don't know that ha owns any of it bnt
he undoubtedly made a good thing oft of its
sale. When he left it he went to Deadwood,
and this was 14 years ago.
I met him first when he was here at Wash
ington three years ago as one of the Senators
from the then organized State of Dakota,
which was planned by the people, but which
was not recognized at Washington. Senator
Moody had, by the courtesy of the Senate, a
place in the chamber while the question of the
legality of Dakota Statehood was pending. On
its being decided illegal be went back to Da
kota and bided his time. He now comes to
Washington with no cloud upon bis title, and
he has taken quarters just across from the
Capitol, where bis office windows can look out
upon that great marble building In which foe
the next six years he will bave a chance to
make for himself a national reputation.
Minister Palmer Homesick.
Senator Palmer likes nothing in the world
better than to play at being farmer here in his
812,000 log cabin. He pines for the forests of
Font Hill, the name by which he calls his farm,
even under the sunny skies of Spain, and lam
informed by very good authority that he will
return to the United States next July and will
probably resign bis mission at this time. He
has Immense interests here and his salt wells,
lumber yards andpine forests in Michigan are
worth millions. He has a great deal of real es
tate in Detroit, and this farm is only four miles
from the city and is at the end of an electric
railroad. This railroad brings it within close
communication with Detroit, and the city is
rapidly growing toward it It may be advisable
to divide it np into lots at an early date, and the
Senator's Jersey cows and Percheron horses
also need nis attention.
He wants to be back in America also to see
about his Washington property, and bis big
brown stone bouse on McPherson Square is for
sale. This bouse has nine mahogany bath
rooms, and its kitchen and lanndry are in the
attic, while there is a fine stable sandwiched on
to its rear. It is finished in the finest of wood,
and is the house for which the Senator was
charged 45,000 more than his contract price
with the architect for building. It cost him, he
once told me, $85,000, and he now offers it for
sale, with the lot adjoining it, for $12000. He
does not want to rent it and as It is not sold,
the probability is that it will stand vacant this
winter.
Probable Diplomatic Changes.
Speaking of Palmer's probable resignation of
the office of Minister to Spain, there will prob
ably be a number of changes when the spring
opens: Colonel Denby, President Cleveland's
appointee as the Minister to Pekln, will not be
removed before that time as it would be impos
sible for the new appointee to get to his post
before the opening up of navigation on thePel
h'o river. Minister Childs, of Bangkok, is still
In office, and there has been, as yet no change
of appointment in Korea. Thomas Byan, the
Minister to Mexico, was here a few days ago,
and be has gone back to Mexico to spend some
months there at least From a private letter
from Japan I learn that our new minister at
Tokio is very popular there and that he pro
poses to entertain on a more extensive scale
than did Governor Hubbard. This letter states
that Governor Hubbard, according to Tokio
gossip, is said to saved S40.000 during his four
years' service at the Japanese capital. The Min.
ister's salary is only $12,000 a year, and it cannot
be possible that Governor Hubbard was able to
keep np his establishment on $2,000.
The Widow of Hon. S. S. Cox.
Mrs. S. S. Cox is in the city looking after her
property here, Mrs. Cox, though not rich, is
left in comfortable circumstances. Mr. Cox
had, at the time of his death, four houses in
Washington. His widow will derive
a comfortable income from these
alone. The bouse on Dupont Circle
which Sunset Cox bought originally for
30.000. and he sold on his departure for Turkey
for $50,000 and considered it a good bargain. I
It was a gooa .uurguiu. vjpvu uu iumuo
bought the same house back again for about
10,000. In addition to this Mrs. Cox has the
residence on New Hampshire avenue, which
she and her husband built a few years ago.
This is a combination ot Moorish and Ameri
can architecture. It is full of Oriental con
ceits and it cost something like $20,000 to build
it Mrs. Cox and ber husband planned the
tinmn while thev were in Turkey, and they
hoped it would be their home for many long)
.years, iurs. iua. win uui o; -m..-,.v miu
she will hold it as her winter Washington
home, spending part ot the time hero and part
of the time at her home in New York.
The relations of Mr. and Mrs. Cox were of
the closest matrimonial order. Their honey
moon lasted from their wedding to the day of
Mr. Cox's death, and they were closely asso
ciated in everything. Mrs.Cox knew all of Mr.
Cox's plans and she aided bim in his literary
work and in the furthering of bis political as
pirations. She guarded bis leisure and his
working hours, kept the bores away from him
and prevented his being annoyed by the office
seekers and lobbyists. She accompanied him
in all his travels, and I have a picture of Mr.
and Mrs. Cox taken by the light or the mid
night sun during their travels in Norway. He
dedicated all his books to her, 'and she was his
best literary critic.

LOADING A PIN0E'8 FAMILY.
A Hard Task to Get Albert Edward on a
Train.
Paris Letter in New York Times.
Apropos of princes, the sight of the departure
ot the Prince of Wales and his family from
Pari3 at the beginning of the week was a some
what amusing one. Strange to say that on this
occasion the usual precautions had been neg
lected, and that everybody wno listed was
allowed on the platform. There was quite a
miscellaneous crowd by the time the royal
party came up. Up till then amusement
had been found in staring at the portly
valets arranging the traveling rugs and
cloaks in the salon car. On the
table was a gigantic bouquet, with a
neatly written copy of verses attached, sent for
the Princess by some friend. Jnmmy, the
Princess pet dog, was there In great state,
running all over the carriage. It is a fat over
fed little brute, and with the innate snobbish
ness of dogs seemed to know who and where it
was. The royal party were fearfully mobbed
when they did come up, and the valets had all
their work cut out for them to get a passage
clear. It was not until, actlog on a brilliant
idea, the station master sent a trolly with hot
water bottles straight through tho crowd that
the Prince and party, following in its wake,
were able to get up to the entrance to their
car. It was a most amusing sight to see how
the servants got the Princess and then the
Prince into the train.
One could not help thinking of -the old days
in Spain when to touch the Queen or one of
the Princesses was to incur death, as one
watched the footmen hoisting the Princess into
the carriage. Tho Prince gave them more
worlc One footman gripped his right arm and
another got his two hands firmly planted
against the Prince's back and one, two and
away. ' It seemed that it would have beenvery
much simpler to have had a stepladder. When
all had been shot in the doois were closed and
the royal party stood at the windows like wax
statues to be stared at The Prince took up a
most peculiar attitude, crouching so that hU
head only appeared above the window sill.
The faces of some of the crowd were a study.
Most ot the people had their hats off.and many
wore a devotional air such as one sees in a
church. Nobody loves a lord more dearly than
does the French bourgeois.
SHOES SEINED BY STEAM,
The Urchin Bootblack Has a Nickel-Plated
Successor.
Trom the New York Times.
The day has long since gone by when a man,
to have his shoes made things of refulgent
beauty, was forced to lean against a fence or
balance himself on one foot and have a youth
of tender years prod his bunions with a well
worn brush. Of late the shinee reposes in a
luxurious armchair in a room cooled by revolv
ing fans in summer and heated by a rotund
whitewashed stove in winter andhasamanof
mature years and good judgment coax his boots
into ebony loveliness with an oiled cloth and a
well-kept, long-haired brush.
The quality of the shine itself has wonder
fully improved also. The unaffected and
funereal black polish that faded generally to a
pale and mottled-gray tint before the boots it
covered had moved two blocks away has been
succeeded by a glittering and attractive ebony
luster tbit lasts sometimes for two days. It
would seem as if in this line of trade "im
provement could no further go," but an enter
prising firm of colored gentlemen in Sixth
avenue went "one better" a few days ago when
they flung to the winds in front of their parlor
a sign reading:
I SHOES BHINED BY STEAJf. j
-. WmLX You Wait." :
'Theproc'ess of shining now occupies but a
minute, all told, and a shine is put on one's
shoes that is mirror-like in its refulgence and
almost everlasting in its effects.
The motive power comes from the trenches of
a steam beating company and the mechanism
that controls the brushes is nickel-plated and
glittering to a degree. The blacking still bas
to be applied to the shoes by hand, but the
pwner of the establishment is formulating a
scheme that will render that act possible, by
steam power also.

a stout knife. They burn slowly when touched

non-explosive and inexpensive.

the borough limits of Stonlngton, ConiL, is an
old family burying ground. The yard shows
neglect, bushes are growing therein, while the j
walls in many places have fallen down, and tho
entire surroundings indicate that the dead
quietly reposing there have been long since for

inscription that shows that the dead deserved
a better fate thantjbllrion. It reads: "When

1850. repudiated her Revolutionary deb:. Dr.
Richmond removed from that Btate to this
borough and selected this as bis family burial

A Sandersville (Ga.) paper tells this
story: A few days ago a gentleman was driving
in the vicinity of Long's bridge. He firmly
held the lines over a splendid mare, while the
mare's colt contentedly trotted along behind.
When Buffalo creek was reached, repairs being
made on the bridge, the gentleman found that
he would have to drive through the channel,
which was unusually deep, almost swimming,
and would swim the colt The mare was
driven in, and the colt not desiring a test of his
swimming qualities, reared up on his tender
hind legs, gently placed bis fore ones on the
box of the vehicle back of the buggy seat and
was safely drawn across the muddy stream.

There is a hollow old oak tree on
the town and county line between Lebanon
and Columbia, Conn., that for several years
distilled instead of sap, a very fair brand of
oak-tanned "blnegrass" whisky. New England
rum, and occasionally, in drouthy weather,
domestic ales and beer. During all that time
the officers of the law had remarked a phenom
enal overflow of spirits on the part of the staid
and pious old farmers of Lebanon who vote
for prohibition, and they readily understood
that somebody had a cache of balm somewhere
within the town's limit but every raid they
made on the premises of suspected persons was
unfruitful. It was not until a low weeks ago '
that the secret of the hidden rum was laid bare
by a deacon in the church, who accidentally
stnmbled on the bank of exchange ana deposit
in the silent and faithful old oak. As he was a
man untroubled with no-license thirst he gave
the whole thing away. Piece by piece the news
transpired that the old oaken bank had been
in the hands of a dexterons and thrifty receiv
er, a Lebanon man, who twice a week filled the
oak's till with rum. gin, whisky or beer from
Norwicbjand nightly a stockholder or two came
stealthily with a jug, or milk can,or tin pail and
drew on the funds. In payment for the privi
lege he left collateral security by the side of
the deposit In the tree. Since the good dea
con's fortuitous trip to the tree, the old oak
bank has gone into involuntary liquidation.
