Roosevelt's message on Porto Rico
was read in both (branches of congress
ta-aay.,' He told of his trip to the is
land and then makes a strong plea for
"conferring full citizenship upon the
peopla of Porto Rico."
The message follows:
SPECIAL MESSAGE.
Ii to tne senate ana House or itepre-
sentatives:
11 l Vn Mnimlu. 01 T .rlolta Vio Inland
of Porto IRico, landing at Ponce,
crossing by the old Spanish road by
Cayey to San Juan, and returning
next morning over the new American
road from Arecibo to Ponce; the scen
ery was wonderfully beautiful, espe
cially among the mountain's of the in
terior, -which constitute a veritable
tropic. Switzerland. I could not em
Ibark at San Juan because the harbor
has not been dredged out and can not
receive an American battle ship. I do
not think this fact creditable to us as
a nation, and I earnestly hope that
Immediate provision will be made for
dredging San Juan Harbor.
I doubt whether our people as a
whole realize the beauty and fertility
of Porto Rico, and the progress that
has 'been made under Its admirable
government. We have Just cause for
pride in the character of our represen
tatives who have administered the
tropic Islands which came under our
flag as a result of the war -with Spain;
and of no one of them is this moie
true than of Porto Rico. It would be
impossible to wish a more faithful, a
more efficient and a more disinterested
ibublic service than that now being
rendered in the Island of Porto Rico
"by those In control of the insular gov
ernment. I etopt at a dozen towns all told,
and one of the notable features in ev
ery town was the gathering of the
! school children. The work that , has
, been done in Porto Rico for education
; has been noteworthy. The 'main em-
phasis, as is eminently wise and pro
i per,., has been put upon primary edu
1 cation; tout in addition to this there
Is a ' normil school, an agricultural
; fcchool, three Industrial and three high
schools. Every effort is being made to
! secure not only the benefits of elemen-
tary education to all the Porto Ricans
5 of the next generation, but also as far
as means will permit to train them so
' that the Industrial, agricultural and
; commercial opportunities of the is
! land can be utilized at a glance that
the teachera, both American and na
5 tlve Porto Ricans, were devoted to
J their work, took the greatest pride in
it, and were endeavoring to train their
; pupils, not only in mind, but in what
ff . counts for far more than mind in citi-
c .' zenship, that is, in character.
I was very much struck by the ex-
! cellent character both of the Insular
police and of the Porto Rican regi
ment. They are both of them bodies
'that reflect credit upon the American
(administration of the island. The fol
licular police are under the local Porto
1 "Rican government. The Porto iRican
'regiment of troops must be approprla
J ted for by the coigress. I earnestly
j hope that this body will be kept per-
manent. There should certainly be
!, troops In the island, and It is wise
,i that these troops should be them
selves native Porto Ricans. It would
be from every standpoint a mistake
! not to perpetuate this regiment.
In traversing the Island even the
most cursory survey leaves the behol
der struck with the evident rapid
growth in the culture both of the su
gar cane and tobacco. The fruit in
dustry is also growing. Last year was
the most prosperous year that the is
land has ever known before or since
the American occupation. The total
of exports and inports of the Island
was forty-five millions of dollars as
against eighteen millions in 1901. This
ia the largest, in the island's history.
Prior to the lAmerican occupation the
grfeatest trade for any one year was
that of 1896, when it reached nearly
twenty-three millions of dollar,?. Last
year, therefore, there was double the
trade that there was In the most pros
perous year under the Spanish regime.
There were 210,273 tons of surar ex
ported last year, of the value of $14,
186,319; $3,655,163 of tobacco, and 28,
290,322 pounds of coffee of the value of
$3,481,102. Unfortunately, what used
to be Porto Rico's prime crop coffee
baa not shared this prosperity. It
has never recovered from the disaster j
of the hurricane, and: moreover, the
benefit of throwing open our market to
it has not compensated for the loss in
flicted by the closing of the markets to
it abroad. I call your attention to the
accompanying memorial on this sub
ject, of the B'oard of Trade of San
Juan, and I earnestly hope that some
measure will be taken for the benefit
of the excellent and high grade Porto
JUcan coffee.
In addition to delegations from the
Board of Trade and Chamber of Com
merce of San Juan, I also received del
egations from the Porto Rican Federa
tion cf Labor, and from the Coffee
Growers' association.
There is a matter to which I wish to
call your special attention, an that is
the desirability of conferring full
American citizenship upon the people
of Porto Rico. I most earnestly hope
ithat this will be done. I can not see
how any harm can possibly result from
it, and it seems to me a matter of
right and justice to the people of Por
to Rico. They are loyal, they are glad
to be under our flag, they are making
rapid progress along the path of order
ly liberty. Surely we should show our
appreciation of them, our pride in what
they have done, and our pleasure in ex-
tending recognition for what has thus
been done, by granting them full Amer
ican citizenship.
Under the wise administration of the
present governor and council, marked
progress has been made in the difficult
matter of granting to the people of the
island the largest measure of self gov
ernment that can with safety be given
at the present time. It would have
been a very serious mistake to have
gone any faster than we have already
gone in this direction. The Porto Ri
cans have complete and absolute au
tonomy in all their municipal govern
ments, the only power over them pos
sessed by the insular government being
that of removing corrupt or incompe
tent municipal officials. This power
has never been exercised save on the
clearest proof of corruption or of in
competencesuch as to jeopardize the
Interests of the people of the island;
and under such circumstances it has
been fearlessly used to the immense
benefit of the people. It is not a power
with which it would be safe, for the
sake of the island itself, to dispense at
present. The lower house is absolutely
elective, while the upper house is ap
pointive. This scheme is working well;
no injustice ot any kind results from It,
and great benefit to the island, and it
should certainly not be changed at this
time. The machinery of the elections
is administered entirely by the Porto
Rican people themselves, the governor
and council keeping only such supervi
sion as is necessary in order to insure
an orderly election. Any protest as to
electoral frauds is settled in the courts.
Here again it would not be safe to
make any change in the present sys
tem. The elections this year were ab
solutely orderly, unaccompanied by any
disturbance; and no protest has been
made against the management of the
elections, altho three contests are
threatened where the majorities were
very small ani error was claimed; the
contests, of course, to be settled in the
courts. In short, the governor and
council are cooperating with all of the
most enlightened and most patriotic of
the people of Porto Rico in educating
the citizens of the island in the pilnci
ples of orderly liberty. They are pro
viding a government based upon each
citizen'is self-respect, and the mutual
respect of all citizens; that Is, based
upon a rigid observance of the princi
ples of justice and honesty. It has not
been easy to instil Into the minds of
people unaccustomed to the exercise of
freedom, the two basic principles of our
American system; the principle that
the majority must rule, and the prin
ciple that the minority has rights
which must not be 'disregarded or
trampled upon. Yet real progress has
been made in having these principles
accepted as elementary,, as the foun
dations of successful self-government.
I. transmit herewith the report of the
governor of Porto Rico, sent to the
President thru the Secretary of State.
All the insular governments should
he placed in one bureau, either in the
Department of War or the Department
of State. It is a mistake not so to ar
range our handling of these islands at
Washington as to be able to take ad
vantage of the experience gained in
one, when dealing with the problems
that from time to time arise in another.
In conclusion let me express my ad
miration for the work done by the con
gress when it enacted the law under
whihe the Islan'i Is now being adminis
tered. After seeing the Island person
ally, and after five years' experience in
connection with its administration, it
is but fair to those who devised this
law to say that it would be well-nigh
impossible to have devised any other
which in the actual working would
have accomplished better results.

MR. CU1MMING TO REPRESENT
Yale at Annual of National Civic Fed
eration. lAttorney Alexander Cummlng, the
president of the Yale Law School Po
litical club, has gone to New York as
a delegate from Yale university to
the annual sessions of the National
Civic Federation, which are held to

NEW FJAILWAY LINES BEING
BUILT IN SOUTH DAKOTA AND
NORTH DAKOTA.
The new line of the Chicago, Mil
waukee & St. Paul Railway which is
being built from Glenham, S. D., to
'Butte, Montana, will open up a large
tract of diversified farming and stock
raising country.
The new line wil pass through Wal
worth, Boreman and Schnasse Coun
ties in South Dakota and through
Hettinger, Bowman and Billings
Counties in North Dakota, and proceed
in a westerly direction to Butte, Mon
tana. The rich soil of the country through
which this new line will pass, consist
ing of a deep black loam, with a yel
low clay subsoil, together with the
favorable climatic conditions and an
abundance of water, 'is adapted to
raising all kinds of grain and suitable
for general agricultural purposes.
There are still many thousand acres
of good government land to be se
cured along this new line. Home
stead entries for lands in Butte Coun
ty may be made at Selm, South
Dakota.
There are golden opportunities for
the farmer and rancher, and for the
small merchant In the new towns
which will be opened along this new
line as fast as the railway can be
completed. Mobridge, in Walworth
County, South Dakota, is the first sta
tion on this new line east of the cross
ing of the Missouri River. A town has
recently been established there and
promises a sreat future.
The most successful fair that the
Eagles ever held In this city was that
which closed Monday night. It is es
timated that $2,500 was cleared during
the eight nights of the bazaar.

LORD SALISBURY'S RELIGION.
Preaching in St. Albans Cathedral,
the Rev. Lord William Goscoyne Ce
cil, rector of Hatfield, bore testimony
to the religious character of his
father, the late Marquis of Salisbury.
Perhaps the fervor of Lord Salis
bury's religion was, he said, never
quite aprpeciated by his fellow coun
trymen, because to the general world
he was very reticent on religious mat
ters. It was natural to his tempera
ment to keep silence about any mat
ter upon which he felt deeply; and
this natural reticence was studiously
cultivated lest he should give over to
the suggestion that religion, always
so popular in England, was being us
ed as a means of advancing his popu
larity. He had such a loathing for
everything false that he would not
allow any ground for the suggestion
that the thing he loved most in this
world was a pretence. Yet he did not
conceal his religion. He attended two
or three services on a Sunday, even
when he had to hear the double weigh
of foreign secretary and yrime min
ister. Sunday always found him at
the celebration of holy communion,
and generally at both matins in the
aprish church and evensong in his own
chapel. On a week day he would never
be absent from the shortened matlons
read in his private chnpel; yet this
was done without any ostentation.
The place he chope in church was
Invisible to the vast majority of the
congregation. To the worldly man he
never spoke about religion, yet to
those with whom he waa Intimate he
would be constantly discussing some
aspect of religion, especially as it was
shown in the lives of holy men. Try
ing to remember the general trend of
thn manv conversations, he should
say that the three great features of
his mind were nis love ot truth, oi
mercy, and of liberty. He held that
without trusting in God, and without
a real faith In Christ, no real ad
vance, either in the individual or the
nation, could be made. London Stand
