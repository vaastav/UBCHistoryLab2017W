"Greece to-day is neither Bolshevist,
revolutionary nor republican, as recent
events in Athens may have led the j
world to believe." Prince Andrew of'
Greece, brother of Constuntine and |
uncle of Kins George, told The New
York Hekalu correspondent in the'
f lirsf interview granted since his mllit;<4'y
rank was taken away and he
wan banished for life from Greek soil.
He arrived at the Kitz this morning,
taking an apartment next that of i
Queen Olga, Prince Christopher and
Princess Anastasiu, who was formerly
Mrs. William B. Leeds, and gave or- !
days that he was not to be disturbed.
He consented to make an exception in '
t'ne case of The New York Herald
correspondent.
Tall and slim, wearing a cray twill
suit and a monocle, the Prince resembled
the popular conce-ition of a London
clubman. He spoke without blttern
-sa of his own experiences, seemingly
bearing 111 will against none and solicitous
only for the welfare of Greece
and the safety of his nephew, the King,
and the other Ministers who have not
yet been brought to trial before the
military committee. For himself, will- :
ingly as he accepted the verdict meted
mit at Athens he intends to make his
home in England, although lie said: "X
admit I should liko to go to the United
States, but it seems too far away Just
now."
"You will understand."- continued the
Prince, "1 do not want to say anything
that will be misconstrued as contesting
the authority now being exercised In
Athens. All I want to say is that I
hope it will work out for Greece's good.
For the inception of the movement one :
must go back to the beginning of the
collapso of 'he Greek army in Asia j
Minor. That was a catastrophe Which |
held the menace of Greek ruin, and it ,
is only natural that the officers becurne
virtually mad on seeing the goal lost.
They came buck to Greece with the
\ conviction that It was time to do something
to arrange matters. They actually
had the Intention of reorganising the
Greek army so as to put up another
stand against the Turks. But w? are
still too close to events to be able to
judge them correctly.
"Yet it Is necessary for the world to
know there is no semblance of Bolshevism
or republicanism In the movement,
as the elections which the present virtual
dictatorship seems intent upon
calling certainly will show. They undoubtedly
thought their plan well directed.-and
the next few months will
show how good is their judgment. Personally,
I do not think the King himself
Is In any danger now, although his
position is certainly an extremely difficult
one In any event. It Is to be hoped
that the public temper is not to be ex

j constant declarations that he was "0
1 longer indulging in politics; but lid
merely smiled when It was suggested
that perhaps Veniaelist disciples were
; responsible for the inclusion in the
churge against the Ministers before tin

returns of the plebiscite, which brought
j back Constantino. * I
"And your own trial, your Highness?"
"Personally r have little to complain |
j of," Prince Andrew replied. "I was,
well treated, but, naturally, 1 consider ,
all the charges against me untrue. 1 j
was accused of having disobeyed orders,
but 1 never dtd so. as I was under no j
.orders. 1 have been reported In rome ^
newspapers us pleading I should net be
punished because I was a figurehead.
That was not true, for it was tile public
prosecutor who declared this, whereas
I declared that I wus the only one responsible
for the whole army corps.
"They shewed me many unexpected
courtesies. The first fortnight in prison
I was under close arrest, a gendarme j
invariably accompanying my servant ;
when he brought my meats, but after
the flrst judicial examination i was;
Riven greater freedom. During the four |
weeks before tho trial I was allowed'
even to receive friends, but it was not |
allowed the King to visit the prison, ij
saw him only a few minutes before \
leaving Greece. Just ions enough to say !
good-by.
"Personally. 1 think the movement is 1
what is known as a 'military conjuru- I
tibn of Government,' which in Greece |
moans the military party Is in control, j
although with no intention to interfere '
with the fundamental principles of the j
constitutional monarchy. Just t>efore 1 :
left Athens 1 heard ihat the present'
War Minister, Pangotas, who Is an cx- I
ceedingiy capable General, intends to |
take up command of the army during '
Its process of reorganisation. This will j
he a hard task, after the burdens Greece |
has had to face during recent years, and :
with the cost of living throughout the j
country rising weekly; but Pangolas j
may be able to work out something!
for Greece's good.
"Much depends, of course, upon the I
outcome of the Lausanne conference I
and whether the pjblic's desire for
peace without losing honor ts to be rec- j
ogaiized there as one of the vital fac-1
tors in restoring aatislacory relations
in the Near Kust."
Prince Andrew's arrival lias changed
the original plans of <}ueen olga, wh<r is
now remaining In Paris to accompany
Andrew ami Princess Alice to London.
Instead of going to New York next
Wednesday with Princts Christopher and
Princess Anastasta.

them both the >Diet and Senate, and
since President Pllsttdskl stepped aside
the Nationalists have expressed willingness
to vote for if. Wltoa. They constitute
the largest party in the Diet,

Athens, Dee. 8.?The Greek revolutionary
committee of fourteen soldiers
has adjourned and hastened to the
front line in western Thrace, like the
consuls of ancient Home, to give the
army a backbone and to save national
unity. Despite an empty treasury and
difficulties in getting supplies, they
hope to put several divisions upon a |
war footing: again.
"The Greek revolution was intended
to uesuro national security and order,
which the late King Constantino's
clique destroyed,'* Col. Nicholas Plastiras,
who started the revolution and
who holds the powers of a dictator,
told The New York Herald correspondent
in his office in the former
Prime Minister's mansion.

quick of eye, still in his early forties. ]
Fie said the Crocks did not wish to j
flght the Turks, but would take the ;
initiative and fight should the Turks i
further invade Greek territory. Cdl. |
Plaatiras could not understand tlie Itrit-'
lsh Indignation over the execution of
Constantine's statesmen, instating that j
the revolutionary tribunal followed constitutional
procedure. When ho was
asked about possible conflicts with "other
Balkan States relative to outlying Greek
territory, notably the ports of Salonlca
and Dedeaghatch, Col. Plastira* asserted
that the Greeks would keep within the
limits defined by the Allies.
. Gen. PangoW, commander In chief, I
who has just resigned his post a< Minister
of War to Join the army in Thrace, j
when Interviewed in the War Office was
confident the army would recover.
"We aim to eliminate any obstacles
to French and Brltisfli friendship, principally
by keeping out Constantino and
the statesmen who compromised themselves
with the Germans. The executed
statc*in?u hy their very power were
blinded to Greek needs. The people a it
tired of slopplness and want a vigorous
Government. We have reestablished
order within Greece, and are continuing
to reorganize tlie army, We purpose
before long to hold popular caucuses.
"The Greek soldiers arc eager to
avenge their defeat, and wo are convinced
we could whip the Turks within
a few weeks <Hth the moral support of
the Allies. (We are concentrating artillery
ni Thrace, and we have made progress
in reeQUlpping the Greek troops."
The Generul saw in the deadlocked
Iarusatine hope that the British again
would give aid to the Greeks. "We need
allied support, because we fear an attack
on the Bulgarian front," he said.

Premier Theunys of Belgium said
positively to-day tliat unless unity
were readied he would not invite the
Premiers to h useless meeting in Brussels.
While Premier Poincaro's friends
lay thai he will scale down the reparaions

German circles here confirm the
report that the best Chancellor Cu*?o

l'oincar* is reported demanding the
ante "productive forfeits" which wrecked
he moratorium plans last summer and
t is fair to say that no international
tatherlng of all those which have gone
lefore ever found the participants so
leflnitel.v committed to preconceived
livergent attitudes.
The Claridges Hotel. Is the homo for
h<* ninmciit of the world's center with
i?>t only l'renjter* Polncare and MtutsoIni
but Ambassador Houghton from
Beflin and Ambassador Fletcher from
Belgium staying there. Several important
American hankers dined with
lie American envoys to-night. Ambus<ador
Harvey is detained at Warwick
"astle by the Illness of his wife.
The Americans insist that their presence
here is pure coincidence and that
.hcv have absolutely no oftleial mission.
'I came here to get a couple of pair of
London trousers." Ambassador Ilough:on
said.
British efforts are ilirccted toward
cringing order out of ciiaos. Thougli
licy had been at first determined not
:> present any llrittsh plan for reparations
hut to let Polncare speak first, the
situation is regarded as so grave tonight
that there is talK of the British
submitting a plan first so that Poin arc
will not be put in the position of
baking demands at the beginning from
which developments might make it dif3cult
for him to retire.
The French Premier was met by a
list lruriiislied arrav of British and
French officials headed by Premier
Ronar Law. It Ik believed tlic-y had an
mportant conforenee. The Belgians reused
to discuss the situation In detail,
out an atmosphere of torcat anxiety pre>'adcs
their headquarters. They do'not
want to offend Great Britain or Prance,
imt they are seeking a middle course
which may please neither. British oflelals
seemed to think that the Belgians
would be found approving the British
diesis. They suid the same regarding
Mussolini, despite the Italian's reiterated
dntement ivlillo passing through Paris
lo-dav that Germanyi must pay.
Meanwhile Tittf New York Herat.d
correspondent has been able to confirm
from German sources that Chancellor
L'uno's own offer Is due here by special
messenger to-morrow. Its exact scope
is yet unknown. Iiut it is generally believed
that It will be limited to not more
tliarw ?75,000,0<H? in cash. If the Germans
get a chnnce to speak either here
r at Brussels they expect to be able to
show the really desperate straits into
ivhieli their country has fallen.
Hugo Murines Is reported to have sent
private word to Poincare tnat ir ne
Lakes tlie Ruhr he will never get a
single gold mark from Germany.
These representations are tuken with
more than a grain of salt in British as
well as French'uuarters.
