;V?.. mmtary Mcinlleck'i Clear Tlcw.
; gTbe treatment by the secretary of tbe
, treftsury of the question of taxation and
;tb tariff, la very clear, concise and able.
;'',BereUrjr McCulloch ia one of tbe meet
ilstlngalshed financial authorities in tbe
k world, and the manner In which he ban-
-, ilea the questions considered In bis re
I pert confirms his title te be thua es-
xewaea. ne ininic mat me position ne
takes upon tbe tariff issue is sound.
Be considers that tbe present manu
factoring depression is the result of ever
production ; which is clear enough. He
farther considers that since our manu
facturing facilities are In excess of the
requirement of the country, the way out
of the trouble Is te obtain a foreign outlet
for them which also Is ;clear enough, if
it Is admitted that we make mere than
we consume new, or are likely te con
sume In the near future. That this is the
case new is Indisputable ; and whether
or no the demand of the country is going
te seen grew up te its facilities for sup.
plj, which Is very doubtful, it is at least
certain that n foreign market, in addition
te the home- market, would be a very
desirable thlDg for our manufacturers
te bare.
Mr. McCulloch proposes that a com
mission of:member:of the Heuse shall be
formed te inquire into the practicability
of obtaining a market in foreign coun
tries for our manufacturers, by a modi
fication of the import duties which new
close them te 1135 which commission
shall consider two things as settled ;
namely, that tbe revenue te be raised
shall be only such as is required for tbe
expenses of the government; and second
that the manufacturing Industries
are net te be put in Jeopardy. The
legislation te be recommended must
be in their interest, which is the inter
est of the whole country. The aim
in amending the tariff will be
te secure an outside market for
our products, and that is surely one with
which manufacturers should be In sym
pathy. "We have great advantages ever
etner countries for manufacturing, in
me possession of the important raw
materials, the best machinery, the beat
mechanical talent and the best workmen.
When we have the best workmen we also
have the cheapest, in industries demand
ing skill in manipulation. "Europe has a
lower priced labor ; but low-priced labor
is net necessarily cheap labor. It is
often the dearest. "We new send a great
many manufactures abroad, and tbe
quantity may be greatly Increased by
legislation tbat will enable us te get
cheaper materials, and that will give
our products free entrance te foreign
perta. We obviously need free raw ma
terial te start with ; and the secretary
urges Congress te at once enact that
such materials shall be admitted free of
duty.
He also recommends ihe abolition of
the Internal revenue tax en tobacco, and
en alcohol used for manufacturing pur
poses. He states that since 1850 Great
Britain has net taxed alcoholic spirits
that have been mixed with weed naphtha.
which are called methylated spirits. Se
neated they are said te be unflt for use
as a beverage, and In this casoueone
can object te the removal of the tax.
Alcohol used in manufactures and med
icines, certainly should be as cheap as
possible ; and no reason for Its taxation
can be urged save its use as a beverage.
The message and utperts.
Mr. Arthur has "glided through the
official routine" of his duties with dig
nity and decorum and in a colorless ahd
unimpressive sort of way. nis last
message te Congress and te the country
has the same characteristics. In its
treatment of foreign affairs it embodies
the fnmlliar idea of President Tayler
mat we are "at peace with all the world
mm lueitrst ui uj.iuKinu, ana it is a
geed condition in which te be and te
remain. The fact that all nations are
coming mere and mere te be of this
mind, renders tbe discussion of military
and naval questions of secondary im
portance and remands the science of
warfare and of defense te the rear of
commercial and maritime Interests.
As we get further away from tbe late
war the Union sentiment becomes
stronger and stronger and Is te day ha
certain in the Seuth as in the North;
tbe increasing efficiency of the national
guard In nil the states is ample guaran
tee of domestic tranquility ; and this
militia could be quite as readily organ
ized into an effective army for foreign
war as auy Immediate exigency will
demand. It is true that our navy is
weak and contrasts ridiculously with
the armament of many second nnd tnlrd
-'"'rate powers ; it has net yet been made
manifest tbat this country needs a navy
en the high Eeas for aggression ; far less
urgent certainly is the necessity for it
than if we had a merchant marine built
up. Our long line of seacoast and num
erous ocean ports are exposed te easy
attack at present, but there is
Constantly decreasing peril of that kind ;
meanwhile all the old theories of naval
defense are being revolutionized se
rapidly, that with the development of
dynamite and torpedo methods, we may
seen come te cheaper, quicker and mere
effective modes of resistance than the
navy department new gropes for. Most
assuredly the experience of the country
with the Republican administrators of
the navy and its favored ship build.
era since the war has net commanded
popular confidence, and no great Interest
will be felt In this department until a
new administration introduces new men
and measures.
The postal department is the one of
most universal Interest In Its operations
and every tendency toward cheaper pest,
age illustrates advancement in adminis
tration. Tbe recommendations of the
department and tbe president in this
direction seem te be founded in geed
reason and cannot fail te be gratefully
received.
It ia te the report of Secretary McCul
loch, and the president's views upon
questions of finance and taxation,
v: m. tbat the greatest attention will be dlree.
Md. As far as they go they will be
i.fMMrally accepted as sound, except tbe
approval of subsidies ; though it will be
observed tbat President Arthur is far
mere non-committal than his sec
retary, and Illustrates tbe difference
between a politician desiring te satisfy
all sides and a hard headed financier
with practical notions ei bis own.
Tbe reccommendatlen of a pension for
Grant, springs no doubt from tbe sytupa
thctic impulses of tbe executive Tliere
is no consideration of national grutltude
nor ei geed public policy that warrants
it.
FuirrnEK evidence is furnished of the
03nditien and of the administration of
the Lancaster county prison by tbe dis
graceful story of free and easy commu
nication of male and female prisoners,
sentenced te " separate and solitary
confinement," who cut holes in the par
tition between their adjoining cells,
and thus get together. The undcr
keepers blame It en the rotten jail ; the
Inspectors " censure" tbe underkeepers
and damn the jail tee ; which has pre
vieusly excited the condemnation of
courts and grand Juries. The public,
which has been hearing of these thlugs
for years holds its nese at the renewed
report of them, and while wondering
whose duty it is te build the oft de
manded new jail, concludes that a new
kind of Inspectors, keepers and jail ad
ministration Is about as sorely needed
as a stronger prison.
TnB state treasurer jogs along with
the snug balance of $S12,7S3 -13 in the
general fund, although the legal limit is
feOO.OOO. The deposit in the People's
bank, Philadelphia, has been cut down
te $10,000, but the Unlontewn and
Pittsburg banks held up their end of the
line with about $200,000 of the people's
money.
The president's message makes a rather
lively requiem for a dead party.
The base ball seed Is already trying te
penetrate above the frozen ground.
Abe Buzzard's career comes In very
conveniently just new j tbe ammunition of
the campaign liar was nearly exhausted.

It is again proposed te pension the no.
ttoeal mendicant, U. 8. Grant, and tbe
suggestion comes from no less eenaible
person than President Arthur. Since the
Grant & Ward developments, the appoint
ment of a cemmittee would seem mere In
order.
The Reading railroad has inaugurated
the era of economy in the management
of the read by matking down the salaries
of its empleyes from flve te ten per cent.
It seems net unfair that labor in this com
pany should share the distress under which
the capital of the concern has been long
laboring.
TnE Injunction suit of the 13ell telephene
oempany te prohibit the People'e telopheno
company from using the Drawbaugh in
struments that conflict with the Bell pat
ents, has been decided jn favor of the Bell
oempany. The famous controversy is net
however, absolutely settled, as it will be
appealed te the United States supreme
court. But the Bell oempany have the
b?st of the situation thus far, as their
claims have new the protection of an in
junction. Everyone in national offleial life, whose
office In any way permits the indulgence,
takes his kick at the trade dollar. The
president applies his beet te It and grave
secretary McOulIech does net disdain te
apply te it a pointed admixture or shoe
leather. Yet the unwecome guest refuses
te go, Though it is intrinsically mere
valaahle than the silver dollar that the
government Is needlessly, shoveling en the

The following extraet from President
elect Cleveland's letter returnlng te the

sent him, Is agoed index of the treatment
lobbyists may expect under his ad minis
tratien. In the oeurso of hU letter, after
aoknewledgingtho frlendly lntontiens of
the donor, he says: "The acoaptaneo of

TnADE AND TARIFF.
The question hew shall our fereign trade
be increased is the question whieh new
comes te the front and demands prompt
and careful conaideration. Manufacturers
are primarily interested, bat the whole
ceuutry has a stake iu its solution. In Its
iuvestiuatten the taiiff will necessarily be
involved, inasmuch as the relations be
tweeu it and our foreign trade are se close
that they oannet ba considered separately,
but it need net be involved exoept by se
far as it stands in the way of international
trade. If the duties upon raw materials
are an obstruction, theso duties should be
removed. If tbe duties upon ether articles
are an obnruetiou, they should be medi
tied. Whatever may ba rcquired te in-
crease our fereign trade, whether it be a
repeal or moditicatien of existing duties,
should be demauded by the manufacturers
themselves. Hew, then, shall the Infor
mation required for a full understanding
of what stauds in the way of an increased
exportation of our manufactured coeI h
obtained ? It may net be proper for me te
euer aavice en wus point, but I cannot
forbear te say that I can see no better
means than by the appointment of a
commission, composed of men net wedded
te the doctrines of froe trade or protection
fair-minded men, who would prosecute
the inquiry thoroughly, oemprohensible,
aud impartially. It sueh a commiislen
should be created. It should ba dene with
out unnecessary delay.
In the commencement of Its wnrk thn
commission should, I think, regard the fol
lowing points as being settled :
First. That the publie revenues are net
re oe iu excess or wbat may be required
for the support of tbe government, and
me gradual reduction of the publie
Second. That our manufactures, whisb,
under tbe festering care of the govern
ment, have attained such gisan'ie propor
tions and who:e oresneritv in Mwntki tr,
the welfare of all ether interests, and net
te be put in jeopardy bv radical nn.l
sweeping changes in the tariff ; aud that
all reduotieus of import duties Bheuld. b-
iniuimemitw w ueir markets from
whiea they are new In a large degree
CTJKUJUUCU.
If such a commission as had been sug
Rested had been appointed, and its weik
could be performed at an early date, I
should net ba disposed te say anything
beaiiuir directly upon the tariff; but as
relief from the preeent burden of taxation
is urgently and justly demanded, I deem
it my duty te suggest that something in
this direction should be done without da
lay. Offing te the shortness of time
allowed me for the consideration of the
subject, I nui net prepared te name the
arttelcs upon whieh duties should be re
moved or rodueed. I should regret this
if CeugretB were net already in possession
of the facta which should govern ita ae
tieu. This rnueh, however, it may be
preper for roe te recommend :
First. Tht the existing duties upon raw
materials which are te be used in manu
faeture should ba removed. This can be
dene in tbeintereat of our foreign trade.
Beoend. That the duties upon the art!
eles us3d or consumed by these who are
the least able te bear the burden of taxa
tien should ba redueed This also can be
effected without prejudice te our expert
trade.
In regard te our Internal revenue taxes,
I have te say that, as these taxes, with the
exception of the tax upon whisky, ought
net te be and will net be noeded ferrcve
nue if appropriations are kept withiu
reasonable bounds and rigid economy is
establish iu all branehes of the publie
service, I see no geed reason for their
continuance.

Of this important interest he says tbat
iu direet connection with the oendltion of
our fTelKU trade is tha condition of our
merchant service. The causes of the do de do
eliuo of our shipping ere se well under
steed that any remarks en this point are
quite unueeessary. The humiliating fact
stares us iu the face that while the United
States net miny yaara age led all the
nations in ship building and was scoend
only te Great liritaln in oejau tennage, it
has almost ceased te be recognized as a
maritime power. This revolution has
been caused by the diversion of American
eapital aud onergy te manufaotuiieg and
ether internal interests and the substitu
tion of iron for weed In the oenstruotlon
of ships. The obstacles In the way of a
restoration of our foreign shipping will
net be found In the cost of shijs which
are te hi built in the United States, but
in the absence of a demand for thorn.
The great and profitable eirrylng trade
between the United States and Europe
has baeu allowed te pass in the hanrtunf
the ship owners cf ether nations. Se oem-
piete is ineir oentroi or it, se large the
eapital invented in it and se sharp aud
persistent would be the oentest if wa
should attempt without government aid te
share iu it, that our capitalists would net
ourapeie ler it. .uteit4ining these views,
he recommends that, as we ought te have
an lnteres; in the busluess we create and
as tle restoration of our shipping interest
is important if net essential te the exten
sion of our fereign trade, subsidies in the
form of liberal payments for the transport
iuuu ui maws or in come ether form
should be offered as an inducement te
Investments or capital In steamships.
PUBLIC DEDX AHD CONDITION OF THE
TllEAaimY,
It Is highly gratifying te the sccretary
te notice the great reduotlen of the publie
debt ainee it reached its highest point, in
August, 1805. The total debt at that date
was $2, 750,431, 571.13, and the annual In
tereit oharge $150,077,007.87, the average
rate of interest paid being 0.31 per ceut
November 1, 1881, the total debt, less cash
in the treasury, was $1,408,482,018 09, tbe

management of Its debt the United 9
States has been an exatuple te the world.
While heavy taxes were uece.'faty te ac
cemplish these marvelous results thesei
taxes have neither clicofced eutcrprlse uer
retarded growth. While, howevor, the
publie debt Is iu this MtUfiotery oetid i
tien there nre seme tlnanci.il dangers nln-nd
which can only be avoided by changes in
our tluaucial legislation. lhe most imml
ni' nt of these daopets ai 1 the due te
which the secretary asks the especial at
tontleu of Congress arises from the oeu
tlnued colnage of silver aud the increasing
representation of it by silver olrtifleutcs.
lie holds that both geld and silver are ab
solutely necessary for a circulating lue.llum
and that neither can bj disused without
Injurious effeets upon home and inter
national trade. But geld and silver can
only be made te maintain thelr com pur.
atlve value by the joint aotieu el commer
cial nations. As most Kurupean nations
have demenetised iilver it is Impassible
for a slogle nation te maintain the oldtime
relative value of the two metiils. After
giving the subject the most oarclulcensld
oration he Is foreod te the conclusion that
unless both the coinage of the silver dollars
and the issue of silver eertitleates are sus
pended, there Is great dauber that silver,
aud net geld, may beoemo our metallic
standard. Te guard against this danger
he strongly urges Congress te suspend or
repeal tbe silver coiuage act.

The number of national banks In oper

as about $135,000,000 of the circulation of

the national baukiug system has beeu of

has furnished a bank note circulation of

is admitted eveu by its opponents. All
this being true, Its preservation is a mat

is prison here, The seirehlug party also
discovered n large quantity of stolen
goods.
Fer seme days past Sam. Bewman, the
well known constable, has been very busy
organizing a band of men te make a soareli.
He sent word nil ever the neighborhood by
telephone, telegraph and mall nnd
Informed the peeple that n raid
would be made Memhy mjrnitig.
He appointed the " Hand Heards" en the
mountain as the plaoe or meeting, and,
Monday morning at niue o'eloak, oue huu
drcd and twenty llve men were gathered
tegether there. All were heavily armed
and were auxieus te make another despor desper despor
ate effort te ferret out the hidiug places of
the notorious thieves.
the sE.incu begins.
Constable Bewman was at the head el
the party, in which was L. C. Roblnsen.of
Koekvillo, Honoybreok township, Chester
county, whose stere was rebbd of several
hundred dollars worth of goods ou tte
night of September 25th. The party
started shortly after ulue o'elook from the
" Hand Beards " They proceeded at once
te the "Sassafras. " where thev arrested
the elder Benjamiu Green, us a member of
lhe baud ; he carried au ugly lucking
revolver, which was taken from him
and he went nubtly aleug. Leaving
the " Sassafras" the party went te
"Possum Hellew," whieh is a long
swamp ut the toot of the mountain.
At the lower cad of this hollow stauds a
small esbin. in which Wei. Marshall and
Hiram Lloyd hae beeu liviug. When the
searching pirty arrived at the house they
found Marshall coming from his stable,
whieh he had just looked, and Lloyd was
in tne uoue. iue party at oneo began a
search, and leund at least a wagon leul of
goods, all of whieh are believed te have
been stolen, iu the barn and a stene
feuoe ou the premises. Tbe goods
consisted of jewelry, razor. knics,
tobacco, calico, haruess, &j. Thorewuro
ever 100 articles In all, and n large num
ber were IdenMued by Mr. Robinson ss
property whieh was stelen from his btore
when it was "cracked." Many of them
bore his private marks, and therc is no
doubt that they belonged te him. The
goods were nil leaded up aud taken oharge
of by Constable Bewman, who has them
at his house nt present. Marshall aud
Lloyd were then taken into custody, and
the former was found te be weiring a pair
of pantaloons which had bjen steliiu from
Mr. Robinson.
SENDINO SCOCT3 UIT.AD.
After leaving Marshall's house, the
pesse with the three prisoners moved en.
Scouting parties were sent ahead and
squads wero kept in different parts of the
mountain in order tbat the main body might
be kept warned. V hen the laitar nrrived
at "Ulue Heck" they found Ben Green,
the younger, who was a'se taken into cus
tody. He is the boy who was with the
Buzzards and Lippince'.t ou Saturday, and
was sent by them te Worst's stere nt
Springvl le for cbocee and crackers,
Nothing was feuud upon his psreen but a
knife, and he is held upon suspicion.
Iu the evening the four prisouers were
placed iu n wagon, whieh was hired for the
purpese, and Constable B t wraan and Mr.
U..W.OU irt MKaruft'tewn" with thorn
for Liacaster. They arrived in this city
about 11 o'eloak and the prisouers wero
placed in the station houje, where they
were kept ever night. This morning they
wero takeu te prsm. Constable Bewman
has made complaint before Alderman
Ferdney agaiust Marshall and Lloyd,
charging them with receiving stelen goods.
The elder Gi-een is held for earryiug oou eou oeu

thieves who beleugcd te the baud. The
tlme for their hearing has net yut been
set.
wne the rniseKuns are.
The men in custody are a hard let, and
have bceu iu numerous scrapes before.
Marshall U 02 years of age, and has been
charged with larceuy at different times; he
has always been lucky ii gettiug claar,
however. He livei iu a Iittle cabin, aud
has no woman in his family, lle is a man
of geed appearauoe, closely resembling a
coleiod prcaeher. At the last term of court
be was tried upon the oharge of stealing a
three spring wagon from Adam G. Kurtz,
of West Cocalico township, en July 21st
When the wagon was stolen the running
gears wcre yellew, hut when rcceveied en
the premises el defcudaut en the moun
tain, it was found te have been painted
blaek with lamp black The dofense was
that tte well dressed strangers stepped at
Marshall's house and offered te soil him the
wagon. He deelued te buy it, but even
tually advanced $a0 te the strangers, and
they left the wagon as security. The
strangers gave Marshall a writing te the
effect that they would redeem tne wagon
in three weeks and two days.
The verdict of the jury was net guilty,
but the impression at tbe time was that
he was guilty. Marshall denies that hi is
guilty of the last crime for whieh he has
been arrested, aud has a story te explain it :
He says tbat ou Saturday night last the
goods were brought te his house by Jehn
Linpiuoettand Abe Buzzird. who tarried
thorn in bags aud had with thorn a lighted
lantern. The ollletrfl think thisavery
unlikely story, as thesa two well known
creeks wGuld hardly carry a lantern with
them at night when they knew that they
are being hunted for nt all tlmef.ospBelally
after getting Bafely out of a llht with
citizens.
Lloyd is also an old darkey, aud is bo be bo
Ileved te be the same age as Marshall. He
is net well known te the oflleers, having
been en the Welsh mountain but a short
time. He also denies his guilt, He tells
very contradictory stories, however. First
be said that be bad been en the mountain
but two days and then changed it te two
weeks, finally saying tbat he oatne there
lest week. The two Benjamins are ceus
ins and oemo from bad stoek. The elder
is a man and the younger 17 years ei ege.
ABE BUZZARD NOT ABJUT.
During yesterday's search nothing was
seen of Abe Buzzard or Llppincett,
although they were beard of at different
points where they bad b:en seen. It is
believed by iuiqv that thev mty have left
the mountain until things tlull oeol off,
lie stated te some ene that he believed
that bis tlme had come, but he wauted te
get even with some fellows yet ; and, if he
had te die, he would have the satisfaction
of knowing that he had geed eause for
giving up his earthly oareer. It is almost
eertaln that he was the leader of the party
who robbed Sniffer's stere en Friday ulght
Whether the wily Abraham lives en

A WELLOnOANIZED OANO,
There is no doubt among the officers and
persons residing in the neighborhood of
tbe mountain that a well erganizsd band
of desperate thieves who positively refuss

THE MOUNTAIN CONSTAULE,
Constable Bewman, the miu who has
always been a terror te the Welsh mouu meuu
tain thieves, has shown a great deal of
bravery iu capturing inembers of the
baud, nud descrves great credit. He has
done cverythlng iu hiS power te bring the
men te justice, nnd is new pessessed of
plenty of information that he will net
divulge, ns it might "queer" his opera
tions, He is constantly ou the move, nud
this morning he exhibited a piece of calico
about two Inches square for whieh he paid
$5 iu erder that he might be aided Iu so se so
euring seme stolen property. He, ai well as
many ethers, have an Ide.i that the gang
ein tiover be entirely breken up until tbe
men who aid nud assist the thieves in
hiding nnd koeplng thorn informed are
locked up.
A JOURNALISTIC CRANK.
iV great many wild stories have been
told concerning the Welsh mountain
thieves, but the fellow who sent n special

night should be given the cake, bakery
and all. He says; "The staioher.i met
three of Abe's brothers, Mart Jeha and
Jake, ou the mountain. They declared
that they knew whero Abe was, tbat he
was armed and that he was determined te
kill bofero being takeu. Mrs. Buzzard,
his wife, also declared he bad been home
last night and that she had no fear that he
would be captured."
The truth Is that Jake Buzzard Is In this
eity hard at work, as he has baen for years,
