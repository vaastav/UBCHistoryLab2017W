OUIt CITY ELECTION ! !
DEMQCRACYTRIUMPHANT I
ALBANY KEDEEIED ! !
A Democratic Mayer Democratic Ro
c order Democratic Treasurer Dem
ocratic Majority in tha CouncU.
The election last Monday was hotly
contested and closely ionght to the
very end, bat the Democratic hosts
were too many for the enemy, and
when the polls were closed Radical
ism had received a shock which sent
it reeling and despairing from the
. arena, with hardly enough of its num
ber left unharmed to bury the dead
and bear the wounded from the field.
It is true that we did not escape
unscathed, for a small squadron who
contested the battle well and nobly,
went down with the great body of the
enemy; bnt theirs is a glorious de
feat, because their very intrepidity
and daring saved the day for Democ
racy and left our colors floating over
the ensanguined field.
List year the Republicans carried
the city on their general ticket by an
average of 20 majority, although a
Democratic Mayor and one Council
man were elected, by Republican
Totes. Having been so successful at
that time, they were fully confident of
winning an easy victory this year, and
consequently went to the polls with a
confident and buoyant air, as though
there was no such thing as a Demo
cratic party in existence. Imagine
their astonishment, then, at finding
themselves almost completely annihi
Tated when the polls closed after the
day's struggle was over.
Following is an abstract of the vote
Democrats in Italics, Republicans
in Roman:
Fob Mator A. W. Sxeeeney, 134;
J. F. Backensto, 118. Sweeney's ma
jority, 16.
Fob Recorder Jos. TL Hen-en,
139; E. B. Purdom, 124. Herrens
majority, 15.
Fob Marshal J. D.May, 103;
"Wm. Riley, 147. Riley's majority,
44.
Fob Treasurer C. C. Kuhn,
134; Wm. Colwell, 131. Kuhn's
majority, 3.
Fob Cocxtclmex A. Hackleman
143, A. jParker 1U, G. A. Hill llfi,
J. Z. Crouse 12$, Leo Fox 118, C. AT.
Cartwright 110, John Conner 92,
John Briggs 128, S. E. Young 138,
W. H. Kuhn 13G, C. M. Cartwright
136.M.M. Harvey 133.
Messrs. Hackleman, Parker and
Hill are the Conncilmen elected on
the Democratic ticket, and Messrs.
Young and Kuhn are the victorious
Councilmen on the Republican ticket;
and then Charley Cartwright was a
candidate on both tickets and of
course was elected by an overwhelm
ing majority.
HE ISIHAEDLY A DEMOCRAT.
The Oregonian publishes a long
letter abusive of Hon. Jaa. H. Slater,
purporting to come from Eastern Or
egon, and says it was written by a
Democrat. The writer of the letter,
after heaping much doggerel abuse
upon Mr. Slater, says :
"Bnt, then, it is no quarrel of ours,
only so far as the natural pride of cit
izens is concerned. In this regard,
however, Republicans as well as Dem
ocrats have an interest at stake."
Now isn't the above rather singu
lar langug3ge for a Democrat to use ?
But tor what the Oregonian asserts
one would naturally suppose that its
correspondent was a Black Republi
can, who had no interest in the Dem
ocratic tight in Eastern Oregon, "only
so far as the natural pride of a citi
zen is concerned." We opine the
Oregonian has got its correspondent's
politics rather mixed. Such "Demo
cratic" letters as that won't wash up
this way. '
As Affecting Scene. The Jack
sonville Sentinel of last Saturday says
that Miss Hannah Ralls, upon the
trial of her father for assaulting J. D.
Fay with a dangerous weapon, gave a
full statement, under oath, of her se
duction, her flight from the house,
and her extreme suffering in the cold
from early in the morning until found
late in the afternoon. She gave her
evidence slowly and calmly, without
showing the least vindictiveness or
anger. Her statement brought moist
nre to the eyes of many in the crowd
ed Court House, and carried convic
tion of the truthfulness of what she
stated, to every unprejudiced mind,
This evidence was admitted for the
purpose of,' showing what an over
whelming weight of mental suffering
the defendant's mind must have been
under, upon hearing of the ruin of his
family by the prosecuting witness.

A QUESTION 0? VERACITY.
As a general r,ulo "one good turn
deserves another," and when the Ore
gonian a few days' ago took occasion
to allude to the State Rights Demo
crat as a paper of the highest re
spectability truthful, dignified, cour
teous, and all that we hoped to be
able to always puff our cosmopolitan
ueighbor in the same way- in fact we
expected to immediately propose to
associate the two papers into a "mu
tual admiration society;" but we find
that journal so persistently departing
from all of our preconceived ideas of
" fairness and respectability " that we
have abandoned the hope of a high
toned coalition with it and have con
cluded to let it remain in the common
gutter of debauched journalism.
While it is expected that that pa
per, in the interests of its own party
will resort to all means, however
questionable in propriety or fairness,
to secure a partiznn advantage, yet we
were hrnlly prepared to see it fulmi
nate so glaring, palpable and inexcus
able a falsehood as that in its issue of
last Monday, wherein it states that
Gov. Grover, from 1S61-2, never
came squarely to the front and identi
fied himself with the Democratic
party or participated in its councils
till 1870.
Now we personally know nothing
of Oregon politics previous to 1866,
but we recollect that during the cam
paign of that year Gov. Grover was
an active champion of the Democrat
ic cause, and made speeches in vari
ous places during the progress of the
struggle. The Oregonian can certain
ly not have forgotten Gov. Grover's
speeches before the Oro Fino Demo
cratic Club in Portland, or his con- j
test with Dave Logan at a Yamhill I
town on the eve of the election of 1SR6,
nor how he met other Radical speak
ers during that campaign. The Ore
gonian surely has not forgotten that
Grover was Chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee con
tinuously during the past six or eight
years, and by virtue of that position
has been at the head of the Democrat
ic councils daring the whole of that
time. But it is difficult to shame a
journal into truth which would so
glaringly misrepresent facts that are
of such public record as those of
which we speak, hence to further dis
cuss the subject would be to dignify
falsehoods which are known as such
throughout our whole commonwealth.
Tammantin MfLTXOMAn. Mrs.
Duniway, in the Xew Xbrthiccd, thus
prods up the Radical officials of Mult
nomah county, who have been imitat
ing the theivery of Tammany for the
past year :
The Grand Jury Report shows that
the expenditures of Multnomah coun
ty for the fiscal year are near $9,600
in excess of those for 187 J ; or, to be
exact, the sura of $43,592 24 sufficed
for 1870, against 8o4,475 32J for 1871
an increase of $S,SS3 07 . It can
not reasonably be claimed that the in
flux of population or growth of crime
accounts for this greatly increased ex
pense. Indeed, it can be verv readily
accounted for otherwise. The Re
port before referred to shows that
$2,100 have been allowed the County
Clerk and Sheriff SOOtf to the former
officer and $1,500 to the latter in a
manner not contemplated bv law.
So here is $2,1U0 of the people's mon
ey surreptitiously appropriated by
by our lucre-loviug public servants
accounted for at a single dash of the
pen. Were the salaries of Clerk and
Sheriff of 3Iultnnomah meager there
might be a shadow of excuse for such
questionable transactions; but on the
contrary it is notorious that both
these offices have almost princely in
comes. 1 artisan malice couia nave
had nothing to do with the Report,
as a majority of the members of the
Grand Jury were Republicans.
At the recent election for members
of the Legislature in Mississippi the
Democrats caried twenty-three coun
ties, which in either 1869 or 1870
gave Radical majorities. In one
county Adams which is hopelessly
black, the Democrats generally ab
stained from voting, as their exercise
of that franchise would have availed
their candidates for the Legislature
nothing. Next year, at the, Presi
dential election, every Democrat
who can get to the polls will vote,
and the Democratic Presidential
nominee will pet the electoral vote of
the redeemed State.
NEWSPAPER Change. T. Patter
son & Co. have sold the Oregon Her
ald to" an association of Democrats
who will hereafter publish" it. We
believe CoL Taylor is one of the new
association and will still remain as
editor. Long may the Herald re
main under the editorial management
of so able a Democratic writer as Col.
Taylor.
"Five years ago," remarks the Phil
adelphia Court Journal, "we fought
the Democracy, with the spelling
book, and whipped them. This year
our weapon is the arithmetic, and is
just as deadly." To which the Cin
cinnati Enquirer responds: , "Precise
ly. It is bard to beat your arithmetic
when there are divisions in our own
ranks; when additions are ruade to
yonr party by the use of the bayonet;
when your uotes are multiplied by re
peaters and revolvers, and our baliots
are subtracted from the box by ras
cally judges,"
Afteb all tha tremendous outcry
against the .Tammany Ring, it turns

folks who make a fuss about each a
contemptible sum as that?
