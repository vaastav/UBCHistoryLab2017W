RIVER IMPROVEMENT DOnS
Who can bring forward a good
w reason why the government should
r not Issue bonds to improve the rivers I
and harbors Not on the theory of
economy It would save hundreds 01
millions of dollars and multiply trade
eo that we would have the money all 1
back in a few years
If the streams are worth improving J
at all they are worth improving at I
once Why should not we have the
advantage of them At the rate the
f work has been going on It would not
be finished In a thousand years an
t f the annual waste has been millions
Until the real river interests Joined
1 hands with the government engineers f
in demanding reform the standing E
answer at Washington to the ques
tion When Is a river navigable I
was When It Is In a doubtful dis E
trict
If the government Issues bonds
and undertakes the improvement 01c
Internal waterways systematically
the whole sum will be placed at the I
disposal of come executive depart q
ment and the graft feature of the an I
nual appropriations will be elimi
nated The work of making the
Ohio Tennessee and Cumberland tl
rivers navigable the year around then t
would proceed without cessation until t
completed In times of war the na t
tion Incurs great expense and Issues II
bonds lavishly Is it not preferable
to direct bur sinews to the tasks of d
j Improvement Tc

The withdrawal of the rivers and a
harbors money from the congref E

step following the removal of fourth c
class postmasters from politics In the

TilE TRUTH CUTS
indignantGo be
cause the president said In his mess
age that they amended the appro
prlatlon bill to prevent the detailing
secret service men for fear of r
being spied upon themselves Yet
that very argument was employed
when the bill was considered that
the executive coud employ detectives
to coerce the legislators We do not
pretend to know why tho amendment
was Inserted The interior depart
ment was employing secret service
men detailed from the treasury Je
partment to run down land and min
oral thteves In the west Then the i
law was amended so as to prohibit l
such details ln spite of the press
dents protest that it would cripple
the government in rescuing the pub
lic domain By the way the predic
tion that Roosevelts activity In those
land cases woud cost Taft the went
did not come true

lUres No bill thus submitted can beI I
come a law unless It Is approved by a I
majority of thoso voting upon It
However the legislature Is not re j

There Is also a provision In the J J

Steuovlcs made llls communication

Sophy was to receive an honorary ap

the prince
princeIf
If IlastaU were right and uiy mem

Ho smiled still The offense against
discipline would be so much less seri
ous Tho prlnco Is a disciplinarian To
speak with nil respect he forgets somo
times that discipline la In the last
analysis only n part of jwllcya
means not an end The end Is always
the safety and tri1I o utility of the state

The generals final Injunction at
least Sophy lot t no time t tu obeying and
nn the slightest thought three thing I
were obvious the king Bas very grate

to appear very grntrful to her nod far
some reason or another Rtciiovlcs
wished her memory to be wrong to
the end that tho life of Mlstltch and
his companion HIP greater Included
the le5mlht be spared InClultClll
he wish that
Presumably his words about the re
lation of discipline to policy supported
the conclusionto avoid that disturb
ante which the prince had forecasted I
as the result of Mlstltchs being put to
death Hut the prince was not ufrald
0of tba disturbance Why should Rte
novlcs IwT The commandant was nilI I

n some tense he was afraid That sho
iccepted Hut she hesitated to believe
bat he was afraid In tlw common
sense that ho Win either lacking la I
nerve or overburdened with humanity
that he either feared fighting or would
shrink from n salutary severity In re
pressing tumult If he feared ho fear
ed neither for hIs own skin nor for tho
klu of others Ho feared for his policy
or his ambition
These things wcro nothing to her
She was for the prince for his policy
