General Mantkuffel's occupation of Rouen,

General Grant is a plain, unpretending,
honest, matter-of-fact sort of a man, thoroughly
American in manner, character, thought and
purpose, and a firm believer in our popular
institutions of liberty and equality, as now
roilocted from our national constitution, and
such in the chftraetor of his annual Message to
Congress, which we lay before our readers
this morning. A* an exhibit of t!?e manage
ment under his supervision of the government,
in our foreign and domestic affairs, there is
much in this Message that is good and encour
aging, and as a foreshadowing of the general
policy of his administration there is nothing in
it calculated to disturb the general confidence
of the country. Lot us briefly examine it.
Opening with a recognition of the blessings
of a Divine Providence, as devout as the grati
tude of old King William's despatches, the
Message immediately follows with a regret
"that, a free exercise of the elective franchise
has by violence and intimidation been denied
to citizens in exceptional cases in several ol
the States lately in rebellion, and the
verdict of the people has thereby been re
versed." This is a serious charge. The States
referred to, we suppose, are North Carolina,
Alabama and Texas, and the '"violence and
intimidation" mentioned are levelled at the
Ku Klux Klan. We know there wus during
the summer a terrible uproar in North Carolina
between Governor H olden and the mysterious
Ku Klux desperadoes; but we thought that
business a tempest in a teapot and that it had
been settled iu a compromise. We had heard
of scenes of "violence ami intimidation"
against the poor bewildered blacks iu Alabama
and Texas, but had never supposed they were
ho bad as to call for a special notice in the
President's Message. The hint will probably
be followed by some further measures of
Southern reconstruction, though General Grant
hopes the work will be completed with the
restoration of Georgia, and we hope so too.
The course of the administration in refe
rence to the war in France and the French
republic, aud iu regard to the application from
the provisional French government for the
friendly interveation of the United States in
behalf of peace, as detailed by the President,
i3 iu some respects very gratifying, and in all
r ?spects, perhaps, satisfactory. Wo are, how
ever, inclined to think that the timo is near,
it not already upon us, wheu this antediluvian
policy of a Chinese isolation from European
affairs will hrive to be abandoned by this great
overshadowing and expanding republic of the
West. So in regard to Cuba wc are sorry to
hear that in the State Department "it is not
understood that the condition of the insur
rection has miterially changed sinco
the close of tlie last session of Cou
gress." Still it is pleasant to know
that a course of prosperous negotiations is on
foot which promises the maintenance of our
friendly relations with Spain ; and pleasant to
know that "the lon;-deferred peace conference
bet.weeu Spain and the allied South American
republics haa been inaugurated at Washington
under the auspices of the Uaited States and
we are particularly pleased that, in the opinion
of General Grant, "as the time is not probably
tar distant when, in the natural course of
events, the European political connections
with this Continent will cease, our policy
should be shaped in view of this probability,"
so as to meet the grand American ideas on this
subject (the Monroe doctrine) of Monroe,
Adams and Clay.
Here, then, we have tbe key to General
Grant's St. Domingo annexation treaty,
rejected by tbe Senate at the last session, but
in regard to which time baa only confirmed
tbe President ia his views. He is satisfied,
too, that if we abandon this project some
European nation will step in ' and take
our pla?e. The argument of the ALpsage for
the acquisition of this splendid island of St.
Domingo (beginning with the Dominican sec
tion) is very strong ; and in view of the
importance of the question a joint resolution
is recommended looking to the ultimatum of
annexation as in the case of Texas, tbe identi
cal policy suggested in our editorial columns
last summer. Doubtless, on the Texas plan
this Dominican scheme will succeed, for we
quite agree with General Grant that "the
project has only to be investigated to be
approved."
There appears next a little difficulty with
Mexico, which, with proper nursing, may
bring forth good fruit. The President says
that "the injurious effects upon the revenue of
the United States from the policy of the Mexi
can government in exempting from import du
ties a large tract of its territory on our borders"
(tbe free zone), are not only continued in spite
of our representations, but that it is even pro
posed to enlarge this free zone and correspond
ingly the facilities to frontier smuggling. The
earnest attention of Congress is called to this
matter, and we would submit that perhaps the
shortest method of disposing of this "free
zone" would be to extend "the flag" over it
from sea to sea and down, say to Yucatan.
Nothing ha3 been done, and nothing
appears to be doing on those Alabama claims.
The Message, however, asks Congress to
authorize a commission to make out the bill of
actual cash damages for our ships plundered
and destroyed by* Anglo-rebel "crmsers^
held over the head of John Bull. In reopen
ing negotiations upon the subject the admin
istration is disposed to await tbe convenience
of England, and In hope of "a conclusion con
sistent with the honor and dignity of both
nations." Secondly, "the course pursued by
Canadian authorities toward the fishermen of
the United States during the past season has
not been marked by & friendly feeling," and
the Messago enters very fully and earnestly
into the championship of our fisnermen's
rights. Thirdly, in our British relations,
"a like unfriendly disposition has been
manifested on the part of Canada in the main
tenance of the claim of the right to exclude
the citizens of the United States from the navi
gation of the St. Lawrence." This becomes
a weighty matter when it is considered that
this great river Is "the natnral outlet to tho
ocean for eight States, with a population of
about 17,600,000 inhabitants," and with a ton
nage upon the tribuary great lakes of 681,807
toas. The President discusses this great ques
tion with remarkable force and in a tone which
is very suggestive. He hopes that England will
not support the unfriendly assumptions of the
i Now Dominion in relation to its fisheries on
the St. Lawrence; for It in evident tb&t there
is to be no more trifling with the rights of our
citizen* on that river or in regard to those
fisheries. Our people "down East and
Northwest will join hands upon this branch of
the Message. The grand American outlet of
the Ht. Lawrence in fast assuming the impor
tance of tlie outlets oi the Mississippi under
Jefferson, and it must eventually come to the
same solution. The Message will open the
general agitation ol this solution.
The subsidies recommended for the encou
ragement of American iron steamship lines
will find a host of supporters. The routine
business of the executive departments and the
workings of the Treasury are discussed in
others of our editorials ; but upon the new
party cry of "revenue reform" General Grant
comes so refreshingly to the point and tho
purpose that he canuot fail to chal
lenge the special attention of all
parties. His Message, in fact, is
a declaration of war against these so-called
par excellence "revenue reformers." He
gives to the New York Evening Post, the Chi
cago Tribune , Carl Schurz and Gratz Brown
and their republican followers the choioe be
tween the democratic party and a third party,
inasmuch as their peculiar "revenue reform"
notious are not the netions of Grant's adminis
tration. He moves here upon the "enemy's
works," and the movement looks like the
advance upon Fort Uonelaon. It brings the
issue into close quarters and knocks these
new-fangled catchwords and claptrap of "reve
nue reform" into a cocked hat. So broad,
practical and liberal, too, is the system of
revenue reform suggested by the President
that only the extremists at both ends can
reasonably ol>j -ct to it.
Tho Message gives a hopeful view of the new
humanitarian policy adopted towards the In
dians. and submits that in its appropriations
of the public domain to railway corporations
Congress has been driving the engiue too fast,
and should slacken steam aud apply tho
brakes; and so say the people. The liberal
system in force of land grants to pioneer set
tlers, and for educational purposes, works
admirably in the development of new States
und Territories, aud ou?:ht to be continued.
The census, we are assured, will furnish in all
the departments of industry a flattering ex
hibit of the country's prosperity in spite of the
desolations of our late war. Finally, the Mes
sage sums up the policy of the administration
to be tho enforcement or the laws, economy,
retrenchment, tho payment of the national
debt, a wise reduction of taxes, honest and
fair dealings with all other people, reform in
our treatment of tho Indians and in our whole
civil service ; 'ia honest ballot and uo repeal
iug, and no violence or proscription on account
of party, nativity or color.
Such is the annual Message of General
Grant. It is a good State paper and a stanch
party platform. Our only tears aro that Gen
eral Grant is too old in the honesty of the sol
dier, too new in the ways of the politician, too
much disposed to rest from his great labors of
the war and too amiable by half to carry out
his party programme after the tren
chant fashion of Old Hickory. But Queen
Victoria gets on very well, though
she hardly troubles herself with State
j affairs. She leaves them to her Cabinet,
aud her Cabinet to the Parliament ; so General
Grant, in leaving his general policy to his
Cabinet, and his Cabinet to the supervision of
bis party in Congress, may prosper and en
joy himself at the same time. He knew where
to look for a good general better than ho
knows where to look for a good secretary, and
here he may wisely" rely upon older profes
sional experience than his own. To be a good
politician, statesman or shoemaker, you must
learn the trade. But this Message indicates
the turning over a new leaf by General Grant as
the head of his party, that'he has been learn
ing the trade, and it may be that he will yet
astonish his limping supporters on his strategy
and taotics, action and activity as master of
the political field. We think he has fairly
knocked away the underpinning of the "reve
nue reformers."
Tho War SHu?tl?n? Th? End Approueblia.
The old story of political interference, that
no wearied the patience of peace-loving patriots
during the rebellion in the South and so vexed
the spirit of McGlellan's army, is repeated in
France. Gambetta at Tours undertakes to di
rect the movements of De Paladinea in front,
and the result is disaster. Orleans is evacu
ated, the left wing of that brave army that
marched to the relief of Paris is thrown back
upon itself and takes refuge in Blois. The
fight is said to have been a severe one, and it
must have been, or the Army of the Loire,
urged to desperate resistance by the scared
politicians at Tours, would never havo fallen
back half tho distance between Orleans and
the temporary capital, thus permitting the
enemy, as it were, to advance so much nearer
the spot that th<i presence of the French poli
ticians makes sacred. The defeat ia disas
trous, for it overturns all the hopes of relief
raised in Paris by the temporary success of
De Paladines' army. The brilliant sorties
made by Ducrot were worthy supports of the
valiant advance made by De Pailadines, and
shewed plainly enough that the two were in
^jmmanijatiop. Now that De
Paladines has failel it is not likely that any
sorties, however desperate, can be successful.
Indeed, it appears from the despatches this
morning that the positions gained by those
sorties are already slipping frem the grasp of
the Frenchmen. The Prussians are fighting
desperately, and with their usual success, to
drive the beleaguered enemy back into his
narrow compass again. The end approaches.
The disaster of De Paladines may bring the
heart even of the never-despondent Gambetta
to despair, and the nation that has hoped so
long against hope and fought so long against
unconquerable foes may soon consent to
peace.
Tub Pittsburg Dispatch states that General
Sohenck Is of the opiaion that the whiskey
dealers will fail in the effert to have the tax
increased. This, remarks the same paper, is
one of the remarkable instances where the
lowness of tax is death to the dealers. The
whiskey dealers are breaking from lack of
taxation. The iaference is that there will
consequently be so many the less number of
heads broken among those who indulge in
"tangle-foot," and oonsequently a loose nod

Karl Oraivlll0>n Reply to W#? Omr u
dnkalTt Lint N*to.
The reply of the British Secretary for
Foreign Affairs to Prince GortchakolTs last
note on the Eastern or Blaok Sea question
has been anxiously looked for, because upon
the tenor of that, it was expected, would hang
the prospect of poace or war. The text of
this important document has been forwarded
to us by special telegram, and is published to
day In another part of the paper. The answer
of Lord Granville is clear and concise, and
devoid of that circumlocution characteristic of
diplomatic language generally. It has the
stamp of statesmanship, and showB that Lord
Granville may be classed with the school of
great modern statesmen to which Cavour
belonged and Bismarck and Voa Beust
belong.
The main point of this answer to the Rus
sian note Is that the British government
accepts the invitation which was made to Rus
sia by other Powers for the assembling of a
conference, but with the understanding that
this conference shall be convoked without the
expression of any foregone conclusions as to
the result of its labors. In suoh case the Bri
tish Secretary says her Majesty's government
will be glad to consider with perfect fairness
nod with complete respect any proposals which
a great friendly Power like Russia may make.
Karl Granville takes care to say, however,
that he does not admit the assumption of
Prince Gortchakoff, that the Treaty of Paris
of 1 8.r>(> bad been violated, or that there was
any ground for assuming it would be, by Aus
tria possessing the D.mubian Principalities.
To all appearances, then, there is a prospect
of a European conference, with some hope
that the present difficulty relative to the East
ern question may be bridged over. Still,
the question is riot decided. Russia
| may at the eleventh hour, if she desires war
or thinks she caa gain by war, rofuse to
accept a conference without an understanding
that her claim will bo admitted. There is a
possibility, too, that the Powors In a con
ference might not agree. Great Britain is not
committed to yield to the demand of Russia,
nor is lltidsia to accept conditions that may
he offered. But the action of both just now
seems to favor peace. The proposed con
ference may lead also to a congress of the
European Powers, when other questions than
that of the East may be settled. May we not
hope such an assemblage would do something
to cud the frightful and destructive war in
France and to curb the overboaring ambition
of Prussia ? The great neutral Powers have
only to aay in the language of General Grunt,
"Let us have peace," and the war between
France and Prussia will be closed.
Thn Blprald? Italy, lUme moil tbr Pope.
Tf tho London Saturday lit viewers Lave any
further desire to noto and comment upon the
enterprise of the Nkw Your Hbkai.d they
will have no reason to complain of the want
of a fresh opportunity. We hare not yet found
it convenient to interview tho British Premier;
but there is no necessity for haBte. A con
venient season will arrive. Count Bismarck,
Baron Beust, the Emperor Napoleon, have
all baen proud of the opportunity of speaking
to the world through our columns. In pros
pect of the assembling of both houses of Par
liament, and in view of the resurrection of the
Alabama claims question, Mr. Gladstone may
find it convenient to make use of our inter
viewer, and so through our oolumas speak to
the American people. Two days ago we told the
Saturday Reviewers to look out for surprises.
What will the Reviewers say when they receive
the IIbb&ld of Monday, December 5, and find
the protest of Archbishop Manning, of West
minster ? a protest read in the Catholic
churches of Lendon the day previous ? In full
and side by side with the protests of New
York, Philadelphia and other centres? In
this case, at least, it will not be possible for
them ? as it ha* not been possible for friends
noarer home ? to cast suspicion on the genu
ineness of the report. Of this, howevor,
enough.
What shall we say of the protests against
the spoliation of the temporal domains of the
Pope? If we are to judge from what took
plaee yesterday in London, in New York, in
Philadelphia, another crusade is not an impos
sibility. Another Paynim host has polluted
another holy place. This time it is Rome, not
Jerusalem, which is in danger. If the Catholics
of Europe and America follow the advice of
the spiritual teachers the latest crusade will
be the most wonderful and romantic of them
all. Seriously, however, it is not our opinion
that the threatened war in favor of the Holy
father and his temporalitios will be other than
a war of words. It will be another grand Pro
testant movement ; but we have no idea that
it will result in another schism. With Cardi
nal Manning's protest we confers ourselves
not a little surprised. Hitherto we had had
a high opinion of his intelligence and culture.
But in reading this document we seem lo be
reading some musty brief of the Middle Ages.
We discover no evidence that Cardinal Man
ning has learned anything which wan not
known in the day9 of greatest darkness and
wildest intolerance. It is undeniable ? the
Archbishop cannot deny it ? that the Roman
people have cast their votes in favor of Victor
Emmanuel and incorporation with Italy. If tho
Archbishop is right all revolution is wrong.
In so many words he denies that people have
aright to rise against their rulers or determine
by whom and after what fashion they will be
ruled. With tho exception of Father
Farrell ? an honorable and praiseworthy
exception? the New York and Philadelphia
protests and speeches wore all in
the same vein. It is a wonderful thing to
find such sentiments endorsed in free America.
It is fortunate that the enthusiasm of European
laymen does not rise bo high. Spain and
Austria have generally been considered the
most Catholic countries in the world ; but In
this matter Austria la indifferent, and, as
shown by the election of Aosta as King,
Spain is contemptuous. The Catholic Church,
Including Dr. Manning and Pius the Ninth,
must bow to facts and yield to the force of
events. The temporal power is doomed, and
no wild, despairing cry can save or restore it.
It ought not to be forgotten that the Italian
government does not seek to banish the Holy
Father from Rome, or in any way hinder him
in the disobargo of hia high and holy duties.
It htm made him large and liberal offers. The
| Vatican Palace is to remain to him. and for
the discharge of hU heavenly ministration*
every facility will be given him. As It is vain
to kick against the pricks we advise ail good
Catholics to advise the Holy Father to make
peace with the govern man t of Italy. As we
have said attain and again, the downfall of
the temporal power in a positive gain to the
Catholio Church, and, indeed, to the whole
Christian world. It will be a mistake If the
Pope ieaveB R me. If ho remains in Rome
he must accept the situation.
( ouiri'M a.t Work A?ain.
Yesterday, under fair auspices ? for the
weather was bland and beautiful as in Sep
tember ? and with a full attendance of mem
bers, the third or Bhort session of the Forty*
first Congress of the United States was opened.
Both Houses were called to order precisely at
noon, in the presence of unusual throngs of
spectators, and with an evidence of interest
on the part of both members and public that
augured well for the work to be done. That
this work Is not likely to be idly deferred Mr.
Sumner distinctly indicated in the Senate by
introducing a financial bill to promote and
facilitate a return to specie payments by
gradual and natural processes, consistent with
the exigencies of the government and the
business of the countrj. The bill itself
we shall have a better opportunity of discussing
after the organization of the standing com
mittees, to which it will in due course be re
ferred. But we are glad to see that the subj oct
before the country which is the most prominent,
important and pressing, is thus ensured the
earliest consideration. The repeal of the
income tax alter the 1st of January next was
also put at once into the foreground by the
bills of Messrs. Cole and Casserly, of
California, who, representing both par
ties, as they do, are agreed upon the
necessity of removing a burthen which cripples
the enterprise of their young commouwealth
notwithstanding all its vigor and rosources. A
few bills of less import, but all looking like
earnest business, completed the day's work for
the upper chamber.
The House of Representatives, also, had a
genial and pleasant meeting, and, after hear
ing the President's Message read, referring
the report of the Secretary of the Treasury and
passing a bill ? the fir.4t, therefore, of the
session ? to supply an omicsion in the latest
Indian Appropriation bill, adjourned at' three
P. M.
Thus the new session is fairly launched,
without any sign of collision or unpleasantness
in any direction, and we sincerely trust that
the good humor of its first day may continue
to its last. The amount of business accumu
lated and craving performance is heavy, but
with a full Congress, few, if any, of those
whose seals are now vacant, and the
earnest good intent that should now
animate all parties and the representatives of
all sections, the task is easy enough for
patriotism and statesmanship. The contrast
afforded by the condition of our great
country and that of distracted Europe
should impress itself upon our legis
lators and nerve them to the labor that
still remains to be done ere we can consider
our prosperity consolidated and our future
secure. The nation bogins to feel fresh life in
all its veins ; its monstrous losses by civil war
are being rapidly made good ; its wounds are
healing; its numbers and wealth increasing
with fabulous rapidity, while, as the
Message of our Chief Magistrate reminds ns
a bounteous Providence has ever blessed ns,
"our basket and onr store." A moral duty of
the highest order devolve* npon us, then, not
only to profit by these advantages our
selves but to set the example of their
proper usufruct to other nations. There
should be lntelligenoe enough in the

The Massing of thk French at Crbteil,
a small town covered by the guns of Fort
Charenton, indicates that Troohu intends to
make tbe next sortie from Paris a direct
attack npon the Fontainebleau road. Creteil,
like Cbampigny, is on the left bank of the
Marne, but on the opposite side of the penin
sula formed by the deep curve of the river.
General Vinoy is said to have actually pierced
the German lines at Choisy-le-Roi, near this
point, but he was compelled to retire be
cause of tbe inability of Ducrot to advance
beyond Champigny. It is, therefore, pro
bable tbat the recent sorties have discovered
the weakness of tbe Prussian investing line
here, and as it is on tbe direct road for the
objective point of the Paris garritton we are
likely to hear of a fierce strugglejaetween the
Seine and Marne rivers.
Will It End in SmoIe? ? It^ will be

of the United States will meet in Richmond
to-day (Tuesday). It is announced that the
affair will end in a splendid ball, given by the
Richmond tobacco merchants. Othors think
that it will very naturally wind up in "smoke."
Wk Havr a Report from Lyons of a de
cided victory gained by the forces of Garibaldi
ovor General Von Werder's troops. The
scene of the engagement is located near
Autun, a village in the department of SaGne
et- Loire. It is a remarkable fact that every
last victory gained by the Garibaldians is some
miles nearer to Lyons than the preceding one.
Perhaps this arises from Garibaldi's "drawing
the enemy on, " but it seems to us more like
tbe case of the man who kept his antagonist
dowu by inserting bis nose between his teotb.

The Sfrrrtorf of the Treasury liiat very
happy condition oh regards his department el
the government. He reports the receipts far
the fisoal year ending last Jane to be
$41 1,225,477 and the expenditure* $309,653,
5(50, leaving a surplus for the reduction of the
public debt of $101,001,906. But as the
income for the first quarter of the present fiscal
year, ending last September, was $115,101,
230, it is evident that the revenue continues
to augment with the increase of population,
wealth and business, and that although
there may be special reasons fer the
income of that quarter being greater
than in any other quarter, we may
expect the revenue of the present fiscal
year weuid not, under existing revenue
laws, fall much short of that of last year.
We say this in the face of Mr. Boutwell's
low estimate, which anticipates the income to
be only $820,418,000. For example, the
income from customs for the first quarter of
the present fiscal year was $57,729,478, and
yet he estimates it at only $128,000,000 for
the remaining three quarters. Now it is well
known that the heaviest importations are in
the spring and summer, and, consequently,
the revenue from that source is larger. The
income from customs the last fiscal year was
$194,538,374. There is no reason to suppose
it will be loss the prexent year, aud it will
probably exoeed two hundred millions. Mr.
Boutwell always under-estimates, and with a
view seemingly to keep up an enormous sur
plus revenue, in order that he may get the
credit of paying off the debt rapidly. The
changes that have been made in internal taxes
may reduce the gross income to some extent,
but we doubt if, with the present laws, it
would be much less than last year.
It is not necessary to pay off the debt at tha
rate of a hundred millions a year, or even at
the rate of forty or fifty millions. It is an in
justice to the present generation, which haa
borne the burden of the war andiias paid so
much of the debt already. What we want
now is a reduction of taxation to the lowest
possible point that an economical administra
tion and a sinking fund of twenty milliens ot
so will admit. The estimated receipts for the
present fiscal year are over three hundred and
twenty millions, and they will amount doubt
less to near four hundred millions. They
should be brought down to less than threa
hundred millions, and then there ought to be
a large surplus for the payment of the debt.
We believe a hundred millions or so of taxes
could be taken off and still an ample income
be left for the government Mr. Beutwell
does not want the taxes reduced. He
tells Congress so. Like a miser, he wishes t?
have his coffers full, that he may gloat upon
the cash and say to the world, "See how pru
dent I have been!" lie argues, too, that tha
plethoric coudition of the Treasury will Inspire
confidence and enable him to raise loans
abroad for funding the debt. This is fallacious
reasoning. Every sagacious capitalist knows
already the ability of the United States to pay
both the interest and principal of the debt,
and his confidence will not be increased ia
the least by seeing unnecessary burdens
imposed upon the people. Tha President, in
his Message, has expressed the right view
where he says there should be "a reduction oi
taxes as rapidly as the requirements of tha
country will admit, reductions of taxation and
tariff to be so arranged as to afford the great
est relief to the greatest number."
As for the 'other matters and details of the
department in the Secretary's report they are
subordinate and of less consequence, and
they are, on the whole, unobjectionable.
His remarks about the new Post Office build
ing for New York are judicious, and we hope
Congress will make the necessary appropria
tion required immediately. On the whole the
exhibit of the Secretary of the Treasury shows
the country to be in a condition that none
other in the world is, and that unnecessary as
is the amount of taxes raised the people are
able and willing to pay them when demanded
by the government. Such* is the patriotism
and conservative character of the nation and
the result of our glorious institutions.

Difficulty Between Brazil and Peru.?
The letter which we publish this morning from
our correspondent in Rio Janeiro suggests the
possibility of war between the Brazilian empire
and the republic of Peru. A rumor prevailed
in the capital shortly before the depwture of
the mail steamer that the Brazilian gunboat
Mag(? had been seized on the Amazon by tho
Peruvians. To such an extent did this report
spread that the press took it up and called
upon the government to say what truth there
was in the statement. An ominous silence
was the only answer. Since the report, bow
ever, active movements have been going oa in.
the naval depots of the empire, and six iron
clads are being rapidly fitted out, but for what
purpose is not publicly known. The next mail
will bring us further particulars of the affair,
and from that we may be able to form some
opiuion as to the chances of Brazil getting
into a quarrel with another of her republican
neighbors.
