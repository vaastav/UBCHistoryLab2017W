PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
Heavy attacks are being continued
by the Auslfro-Gernians in Italy
especially on the north end of the
line where snow now covi rs the con
tested mountain positions. The
Germans are also continuing their
efforts to retake the lost terrain be
fore Cambrai in France.
By hurrying troops from the Rus -
sen front where they appear to be ro
longer needed, the Austro-Germans
are now thought to outnumber the
forces of the entente allies on the
Italian and western fronts. The
allies expect lhe Germans to launch
a great offensive before the Americans
g ;t on the line in large numbers.

The Assembly program given by
Ihe Sophomore class is to take place
in the High School Monday evening,
Dec. 17, at 8:30 o'clock. This pro
gram has been planned as an
entertainment for the parents and
friends of the 11. S. students, and it
is hoped there will be a large atten
dance. There will be no admission
charge, but sandwiches and coffee
will be sold by the Sophomore girls
after the program. The funds thus
obtained are to be turned over to the
Red Cross for the purpose of buying
yarn for the Idaho bovs in the service.
This is obviously a worthy motive so
the Sophomore class extend a hearty
invitation to all friends and patrons
for next Monday evening.
