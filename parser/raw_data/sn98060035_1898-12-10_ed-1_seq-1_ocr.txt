THEIR FIRST DANCE
For the first time since thpir rt.ii,.-..
from Chickamauga the boys of Company
K met their friends for a social dance
last night and although the crowd nres-
ent was not as large as some af those in
cue past, it can be safely said that no
more enjoyable time has ever beeu had
at any of their former assemblies than
was nau last niglit. Xnis was not th
annual ball as many supposed yet full
as elaborate preparations were made
for it as for the annual and it was fully
MS MICCUSSllll.
The hall was most artistically decor
wen, one oi me notable features bein
the Lnion Jack which covered about
half of the rear porliou of the wall
uie nau. mine center-: overhead was
hung a beautiful canopy made by Mrs
M. liond and over the platform th
stars and stripes was entwined about
bust of President Mckinley. The wall
were hung with mirrors and buntine
ana all in all it presented a very at
tractive appearance.
At aDout B.-to me grand march was
begun lead by FlynnG. Austin and Miss
Williamson who were followed by about
60 couples. Many beautiful dresses
adorned many beautifu. young ludie
and everything combined to make the
affair a most enjoyable one, After th
ighth uanee . refreshments of sand
w iches and coffee were served by the
young men and C. 11. Campbell wh
was the caterer deserve much credit
for the manner in which the repast was
gotten up.
Music was furnished bv the Barre or
chestra consisting of Ed. Bruce, Robert
MeKenzie, William Uilbertson, Joseph
Jenkins and 11, M. Dufer.
llvnn G. Austin was floor manajrei
and the aids were Georjre Cadjrer. Wil
liaiu Russell and 11, C. Whitaker.
As previously stated this was not th
annual ball for that will take place later
but if it is auv more of a success than
this one was it will certainly be
miracle.

Tlaloun Th Pinal Span,
lab. Protest.
Paris, Dec. lO.-Senor Montero Rlos,
president of the Spanish peace commis
sion, and Senor OJeda, secretary of that
commission, are still confined to their
beds. The illness ot Senor CHeda dolavH
engrossing the treaty, and It Is doubtful
wnemer it will be feigned before Mon
day. 4
In spite of the secrecy observed by
the Americans, It la learned that the
treaty, in substance, consists nt ia nr n
articles. The prlndtoal articles nrnvldp
iur me cession andjevacuation of Cuba,
Porto Rico and thj PhilitiDine islands.
nu me political, (administrative and
nnancial results thereof; the acquire
ment by the United States of public
property and thef rellnaulahment of
archives. The articles of secondary im
portance determine (the status of Snan
Ish subjects remaining In the ceded ter
ritories and unfinished lawsuits and
eumracis; guarantees of the same
terms to Spanish BhlDnlne and mer
chandise as Imposed upon American
shipping and merchandise in the PhiliD
pine islands for teri years, and leaving
tne status of Spanish commerce in the
Vv est Indies to be settled later.
An important provision is the guaran
tee of religious trJedom In' the ceded
territories, in the lame terms as the
Florida treaty, thef Americans having
steadfastly refused to Incorporate any
guarantee of the United States' deter
mination to favor he property of the
Catholic church, leaving It subject to
the general lawa on the same footing as
private property, ii
The Americans Svere apprehensive
even Thursday that there might be
some unforeseeable turn of affairs which
would frustrate thel efforts at the elev
enth hour.
Senator Gray, though well known to
be radically opposed to the policy of an
nexation or "imperallsm," will vote In
the senate to ratify the treaty, consid
ering that his signing that document
binds him to support it.
Garntca Interviewed.
The Spaniards continue making bitter
comments concerning President McKln
ley's reference to the Maine. When a
correspondent appijpaohed Senor Gar
nica of the Spanlatti' commission for
further details of the (treaty, he said
American and English papers Is really
a reason why I should say nothing.
. T, i .,..1,
But what you show me as having been
cabled Is substantially correct. The ex
act number of articles Is still unde
termined. The Americans are to pay
the Indemnity within three months of
the ratification. We shall appoint con
suls in Cuba, Porto Rico and the Phil
ippine islands without delay. The Cu
ban consul will be accredited to the
powers that be."
Asked why the Spaniards refused to
grant the United States a coaling sta
tion In the Caroline islands, Senor Gar
ntca said:
"The Americans could hardly expect
that we should agree to discuss matters
outside of the protocol after the les
sons we have had from them on this
point. When we wished to discuss the
Cuban debt, they absolutely refused to
consider it, and then they ask us for
whatever they want. Quelle toupet!
(What cheek!) Yet the Cuban debt re
mains an important question for settle
ment." In regard to the Spaniards' final pro
test on the subject of the Maine, Senor
Garnica remarked:
"That protest now becomes history,
as it Is embodied in the protocol. We
do not wish to remain under an Impu
tation which would perpetuate animos
ity and hatred against us and which
would be a source of constant irritation
in Spain. It is neither loyal nor Just
that this thing should hang over the
reputation of Spain. We cannot submit
to It. It must be ciearea up in jiuu
to ourselves. There are many other
causes to bring hatred between the two
nations without the addition of such a
one as this."
Future of the Philippine.
Konnr Garnica was then questioned as
to the future of the Philippine islands,
and he said:
The United States naa maugura-ieu
a policy which will bring It much tre
ble and many responBioiuiic.
Americans are not prepared for the
work they are about to undertake."
The Americans preserve secrecy re
garding the terms of the treaty. This
Is partly through the Influence of the
i,r senators on the body, who repre
sent that It would be discourtesy to the
senate to publish tne terms oeiore me
treaty Is presented to that body by the
president. ,
Th nrotocol of the treaty will almost
reach the dimensions of a volume, as It
will conta n every written siaiemeni
presented on both sides during the con
ferences. Tne spaniBiuB iiittuc a i
rnntributlon Thursday on the assem
bling of the commissions. Senor Mon
tero Rlos then presented a vigorously
wnrded Drotest In which the Spaniards
declared they had yielded to force, but
that they invoked the conscience ol the
.,tin aealnst the 8DUSB oi me rignis
of nations of which they were the vic
tims. This protest was for the purpose
of record and consisted of an argument
In support of every concession aemana
ed by the Spaniards and which the
Amorirnns refused, some of them per
emptorily and without an opportunity
for discussion.
The protest conciuaea: -am ineeo
concessions which we are onngea xo
moitn touch us less than the Insult
which has been Inflicted, on our nation
by President McKinley in his message.
We again protest solemnly against the
accusation hurled against us in con
nection with the Maine, and we Intend
to again submit the question to an in
ternational tribunal comprised of Bng-
i.nri Fiance ana uermany xo aeier-
mins who shall bear the responsibility
of the catastrophe."
