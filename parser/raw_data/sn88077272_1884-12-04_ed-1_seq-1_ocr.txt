Last Document of the Kind by
Chester A. Arthur.
A New Electoral Count Law, the Chinese
Question, Coinage of Silver Dollars, and
the Tariff Question are Among
the Topics Discussed.
To tax Congress of ths TJirrMtB States
Since the close of your last session the
American people. In the exercise of their
highest right of suffrage, have chosen their
Chief Magistrate for the four years ensuing-.
When It Is remembered that at ho period in
the country's history hers the long political
contest, which customarily precedes the day
of the National election, been waged with
areater- fervor and intensity, it Is
a subject of congratulation
that after the controversy at the
poll was over, and white the slight pre
ponderance by which the issue bad been de
termined was as yet unascertained, the pub
lic peace suffered no disturbance, but the
P2P'e everywhere patiently and quietly
awaited the result. Nothing could more
strikingly Illustrate the temper of the Amer
ican citlien, his love of order and his loyalty
tolaw. Nothing could more signally demon
strate the strength and wisdom of our po
litical Institutions.
THE ELECTORAL COUNT.
Eight years have passed since a eontro
vfr8yu.COIieernin8 the result of a National
eteottbn sharply called the attention Of the
congress to the necessity of providing more
8red8e and definite regulations for counting
le electoral vote.
ltl?.,?ie STeatest importance that this
question be solved before conflicting claims
to the Presidency shall again distract the
country, and I am pursuaded that, by the
Pople at large, any of the measures of re
lief thus far proposed would be preferred to
continued
AT PEACE.
Our relations with all foreign powers con
tinue to be amicable. With Belgium, a con
vention has been signed whereby the scope
of present treaties has been so enlarged as to
secure to citizens , of either country within
the Jurisdiction of the other equal rlarhts and
privileges.
In the acqulsion and alienation of property
a trade marts' treaty has also been conclud
ed. The war between Chili and Peru is at an
end. For the arbitration of the claims of
American citizens who, during- It continu
ance, suffered through the acts of the
onllian authorities, a convention will soon be
negotiated.
The state of hostilities between
FRANCE AND CHINA
an embarrassing feature of
our Eastern relations. The Chinese Govern
ment has promptly adjusted and paid" the
claims of American citizens whose prop
erty was destroyed !h the recent riots
at Qanton. I renew the recommendation
of Any last annual message that the Canton
indemnity fund be returned to China. The
true interpretation of the recent treaty with
that country permitting the restriction of
Chinese immigration 1b likely to be again the
subject of your deliberations. It may be
seriously questioned whether the statute
passed at the last session does not
VIOLATE THE TREATY RIGHTS
of certain Chinese who left this country with
return certificates valid underthe old law aud
now seem to be debarred from landing from
lack of certificates required by the new. The
recent purchases by the United States of a
large trading fleet heretofore under the Chi
nese flag has considerably enhanced our
commercial importance in the Ea9t. In view
of the large number of vessels built or pur
chased by American citizens in other coun
tries and exclusively employed in legitimate
traffic between foreign ports under the
recognized protection of our flag, it might be
well to provide a uniform rate for their reg
istration and documentation, so that the bona
Me property rljrhts of our citizens therein
shall be duly evidenced and property guard
ed. Pursuant to the advice of the Senate at the
last session, I recognized the flag of the In
ternational Association, avoiding in so doing
any prejudgment of conflict in territorial
claims in that region. Subsequently, in exe
cution or the expressed wish of the Congress,
I appointed a commercial agent for the Congo
Basin.
THE CONGO QUESTION.
The importance of therioh prospeotlve'trade
of the Congo Valley has led to the general con
viction that it should be open to all nations
upon equal terms. An international confer
ence for the consideration of tlis subjeot wa
called by the Emperor of Germany and is now
In session at Berlin. Delegates are in atten
dance on behalf of the United States. Of the
results of the conference you will be duly ad
vised. The Government of Corea has generously
aided the efforts of the United States Minister
to secure suitable premises for the use of
the legation. As the conditions of diplomat
ic Intercourse with Eastern nations demand
that the legation premises be owned by the
represented power, I advise that
an appropriation be made for
the acquisition of this property by
the Government. The United States already
possesses valuable premises at Tangier, as a
gift from the Sultan of Morocco. As is
stated hereafter they have lately received a
similar gift from the Siamese Government.
The.Government of Japan stands ready to
present to us extensive grounds at Tokio
whereon to erect a suitable building for the
legation, Court-house and jail: and sim
ilar privileges can probably be secured in
China and Persia. The owning of suoh prem
ises would not only effect a large saving of
the present rentals, but would permit of the
due assertion of extra territorial rights in
those countries, and would the better serve
to maintain the dignity of the United States.
The failure of Congress to make appropria
tion for our reoresentation at the Antnrin-
mous Court of the Khedive has proved a
serious embarrassment in our intercourse
with Egypt, and In view of the necessary In
timacy of diplomatic relationship due to the
participation of this Government as one of
the treaty powers In all matters of admin
istration there affecting the rights of
foreigners, I advise the restoration of the
agency and Consulate General at Cairo on its
former basis. I do not conceive it to be the
wish of Congress that the United States
should withdraw altogether from the honor
able position they have hitherto held with re-
Snect to the Khe.ilve. or that, eltlxenn of t.hi
Republic residing or sojourning In Egypt
should hereafter be without the aid and pro-
icuiiuu or a competent, representative.
Titn franco the traditional cor
dial relationship continues. The

pected to reach New York in May next.
suggest that Congressional action be taken
in relation to the spirit which has prompted
this gift, and In aid of the timely completion
oi ise peuestai upon wmcn it is to De placed.
Our relations with Germany, a country
which contributes toour own some of the best
elements of citizenship, continue to be cor
dial. The United States have extradition
treaties with several of the German States,
but by reason of the confederation of these
States under the imperial rule, the ap
plication of such treaties is not as uni
form and comprehensive as the interests of
the two countries require. I propose, there
fore, to negotiations for a single
CONVENTION OF EXTRADITION
to embrace the territory of the empire.
affords me pleasure to say that our inter
course with Great Britain continues of
most friendly character. The Government
of Hawaii has indicated its willingness to
continue for seven years the provisions of
the existing reciprocity treaty. Such con
tinuance, In view of the relations of that
country to the American system of States,
should in my judgment be favored.
The revolution in Haytl against the estab
lished Government has terminated. While
was in progress it became necessary to en
force our neutrality laws bv instituting Dro-
ceedings against individuals and vessels
charged with their infringement.
These prosecutions were in all cases suc
cessful. Much anxiety has lately been dis
played by various European Governments,
and especially by the Government of Italy,
for the abolition of our import duties upon
works of art. It is well to consider whether
the present discrimination in favor of pro
ductions of
AMERICAN ARTISTS ABROAD
is not likely to result, as they themselves
seem very generally to believe it may, In the
practical exclusion of our painters and
sculptors from the rich fields for observa
tion, study and labor, which they have hith
erto enjoyed. There is a prospect that the
long pending revision of the foreign treaties
of Japan may be concluded at a new confer
ence to be held at Tokio.
While this Government fully recognizes the
equal and independent station of Japan
the community of nations, I would not op
pose the general adoption of such terms
compromise as Japan may be disposed
offer in furtherance of a uniform policy
intercourse with Western Nations. During
the nast year the increasing good will be
tween our own Government and that
Mexico has been variously manifested. The
treaty of commercial reciprocity concluded
January 30, 1888, has been ratified, and awaits
the necessary tariff legislation of Congress
to become effective.
The legislation will, I doubt not, be !among
the first measures to claim your attention.
A full treaty of commerce, navigation and
consular rights is much to be desired, and
such a treaty I have reason to believe that
the .Mexican Government stands ready
conclude. Some embarrassment has
been occasioned by the failure
Conarress at its last session to pro
a
vide means for the due execution
of the treaty of July 29, 1888, for the resurvey
or the Mexican boundary and the relocation
of boundary monuments. With the Repub
Uc of Nicaragua a treaty has been concluded
S.?". guorizes the construction by the
United States of a canal, railway and tele
Pph line across the Nicarag-uan territory.
V the terms of thia trna.p .IvV mtln. n . U
iver San Juan, as well as like Nicaragua, an
lnlftad sea forty miles la width, are If consti
tute a part of the projected fehterprlsp.
This covers for nttual canal construction
seventeen mires on the Pacific side and thirty
Six Miles vn the Atlantic. To the United
States, whose rich territory on the Pacific is,
for the ordinary purpose of commerce, prac
tically out off from communication by water
with the Atlantic ports-, the political and
commercial advanrnges of such a project can
scarcely be oveB estimated.
it is believed that when the treaty is laid
before you the justice and liberality of Its
provisions will command universal approval
at home and abroad. The death of our rep
resentative at Bussia, while at his post at St.
Petersburg, afforded to the iMperiaiGoVern
ment a renewed opporrurifty to
TESTIFY ITS SYMPATHY
in a manner befitting the intimate friendli
ness which has ever marked the Intercourse
of the two countries.
The course of this Government in raising
its representation at Bangkok to the diplo
matic rank has evoked from Slam evidences
of warm friendship and augers well for our
enlarged intercourse. The Slamense Govern
ment has presented to the United States a
commodious mansion' and grounds for the
ooennancy of the legation and I suggest that
by Joint resolution attest Its appreciation bf
this generous gift. ,
This Government has more tfiaft once been
called upon Of late to take action In fulfill
ment of iU international obligation toward
Spain. . Agftatibh in the Island of Cuba hos
tile TO trie Spanish Crown having been fer
mented by persons abusing the sacred rights
f hospitality whloh our territory affords,
the officers of the Government have been in
structed to exercise vigilance to prevent in
fractions of our neutrality laws at Key West
and at other points near the Cuban coast. I
am happy to say that in the only instance
where these precautionary measures were
successfully eluded, the offenders, when
found in our territory, were subsequently
tried and convicted.
The growing need of close relationship of
intercourse and traffic between the
SPANISH ANTILLES
and their baturaihvatkBt ih trje United States
led to the adoption,. In January last, of com
mercial agreement tbokihglo that end. This
agreement has since been supe receded by a
more carefully framed and comprehensive
convention, which I shall submit to the Sen
ate for approval; it has been the aim of this
negotiation to open such a favored reclprcu
cal exchange of productions carried under
the Sag or either errantry, as to make the
intercourse between Cuba and Porto Rico
and ourselves, scarcely less intimate than the
commercial movement between our domes
tic ports, and to insure a removal of the bur
dens on shipping In the Spanish Indies, of
which in the past our ship owners and ship
masters have so often had cause to complain.
The negotiation of the convehti'oli has for
a time postponed the prbsecutlon of certain
claims Of OUf Citizens which Were declared
to be Without the jurisdiction ,of the late
Spanish American Claims Commission, and
which are therefore remitted to diplomatic
channels for adjustment.
The speedy settlement of the claims will
now be urged by this Government.
Negotiations for a treaty 'of com mercial re
ciprocity with the Dominican Republic have
been successfully concluded, and the result
will shortly be m'd before the Senate.
Certain questions between the Cuited
States and the
OTTOMAN EMPIRE
still remain unsolved. Complaints in behalf
of our citizens are not satlsfaetorilv adjust
ed. The Porte has sought .to wlth'old from
our commerce the tight Of favored treat
ment to Which W8 are entitled bv existing
conventional stipulations, and the revision
Of the tariffs is unaccomplished.
The final disposition of nendlnir Questions
with Venezuela has not as yet been reached,
but I have good reason to expect an early
settlement, Which will provide the means of
re-examining the Caracas awards In Conform
ity with the expressed desire of Congress and
which will recognize the justice of certain
claims preferred against Venezuela. The
Central and South American Commission, ap
pointed by authority of the Set of July 7,
1884, will soon proceed to Mexico, It has been
furnished with Instruct tons, Wnjch Wilt be
laid before yen. They contain a states
ment of the general policy of the Govern
ment for enlarging Its commercial Inter
course with American States.
The Commissioners have been actively pre
paring for their responsible task by holding
conferences 1U thbir principal cities with
merchants and others interested in Central
Mid
MERIDIAN CONFERENCE.
I
The International Meridian Cbnference,
lately con vened in Washington upon the in
vitation of the Government of the United
States, was composed of representatives from
tw&nty-flve nations.
The conference concluded Its labors on the
1st of November, having with substantial
unanimity agreed upon the meridian of
Greenwich as the starting point, whencelon
gitude is to be computed through 180 degrees
eastward and westward, and upon the adop
tion for all purposes for which it may be
found convenient, of a universal day which
shall begin at midnight on the initial meri
dian, and whose hours shall be counted from
zero up to twenty-four. The formal report
of the transactions of this conference will be
hereafter transmitted to Comrress.
This Government is in frequent receipt of ln
vitations from foreign States to participate in
INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITIONS,
often of great interest and importance.
Occupying as We do, an advanced position
In the World's production, and aiming to se
cure a profitable share of our Industries in
the general competitive markets, it is a
matter of serious concern that the want
of means for participation in these
exhibitions i should so often ex
clude our producers from advantages enjoy
ed by those of other countries. During the
past year the attention of Congress was
drawn to the formal Invitations In this re
gard tendered by the Governments of Eng
land, Holland, Belgium, Germany and Aus
tria. The executive has in some instances
appointed Honorary Commissioners.
This is, however, a most un
satisfactory expedient, for without
some provision to meet the necessary work
ing expenses of a commission. It can effect
little or nothing in behalf of exhibitors. An
International Inventions Exhibition is to be
held in London next May. This will cover a
field of special importance, and In which our
country holds a foremost rank, but the Ex
ecutive is, at present, powerless to organize
a proper representation of our vast National
interests in this direction.
I have in several previous messages re
ferred to this subject. It seems to me that a
statute givirur to the Executive general dis
cretionary authority to accept such Invita
tions and to appoint honorary commissioners
without salary and placing at the disposal of
the Secretary of State a small fund for de
fraying their reasonable expenses, would be
of great public utility.
r fhe Government has received official notice
trlat the revised intrnatlonal regulations for
COLLISIONS AT SEA
adopted by mari
time powers except trie united states, and
came into lorce on tne ist oi sepieuiDer last.
For the due protection of our shinning in
terests the provisions of our statutes should
at once De Drought into contocmity with
these regulations.
The question of securing two authors, com

in this country in return for reciprocal rights
abroad, is one that may justly challenge your
attention. It is true that a convention will be
necessary for fully accomplishing this result,
but until Congress shall bv statute fix the ex-

inadvisable to negotiate such conventions.
For this reason the United States were not
represented at the recent conference at Berne.
I recommend that the scope of the
NEUTRALITY LAWS
in
so as
cover all patent acts of hostility committed
in our territory and aimed against the peace
or a lrienuly nation. Existing statutes pro-
niDit tne ntting out oi arinea expeuinons aud
restrict the shipment of explosives, though
the enactments in the latter respect were not
framed with regard to international obliga
tions, but simply for the protection of pas
senger travel. All these statutes were in
tended to meet special emergencies that had
already arisen. Other emergencies have
arisen since and modern ingenuity supplies
means for the organization of hostilities
without the open resort to armed vessels or
to filibustering parties.
I see no reason why overt preparations in
mis country iorine commission or criminal
acts, suoh as are here under consideration,
should not be alikepunlshable, whether such
acts arc mi ended to De committed in our owu
country or in a foreign country with which
we are at peace. The prompt and thorough
treatment of this question, is one which In
timately concerns the National honor. Our
NATURALIZATION LAWS
of
of
to
of
also need revision. Those sections relating
to persons residing within the limits of the
United States In lTUa and 1798, have now only
a historical interest. Section 2172, recogniz
ing the citizenship of the children of natural
ized parents is ambiguous In its terms and
partly obsolete. There are special provisions
of law favoring the naturalization of those
who serve in the army or in merchant ves
sels, while no similar privileges are granted
those who serve In the navy or marine
corns. i
An uniform rule of naturalization, such
the constitution contemplates, should, among
other things, clearly define the status ot per
sons born within the United States, subject
to a foreign power (Sec. 1992), and of minor
children of fathers who have declared their
intention of becoming citizens, but have fail
ed to perfect their naturalization. It might
be wise to provide for a central bureau of
registry, wherein should be filed authenti
cated transcripts of every record of
naturalisation in the several Federal
and State Courts, and to make
EiroVlslon also for the Vacation or cnncella
iob of such record in cases where trapd had
leon practiced upon the Court by the appli
cant himself or where bo had removed or
forfeited his. acquired citizenship. A just
and uniform law In this respect would
strengthen the hands of the Government in
protecting its citizens abroad, and would
pave the way for the conclusion of treaties
of naturalization with foreign countries.
The legislation of the last session effected
in the
DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE
certain changes' and reductions whioh have
been productive of embarrassment. The
population and oommereial activity of our
country, are .steadily on the Increase, and are
feivi ng rise to new, varying and often delicate
relationships with other countries. Our
foreign establishment now embraces nearly
double the area of operations that It did
twenty years ago. The confirment of
such a service within the limit of
expenditure then established is not,
it seems to me, in accordance with true econ
omy. A community of sixty millions of peo
ple should be adequately represented in its In
tercourse with foreign nations. A project for
the reorganization of the Consular servioo aid
i or recasting tne scpeme 01 extra territorial
urisqicuon is
BOW before Iron . f f the . limit
Ota short session will riot allow its full con
jnderaUoB. Itrust you will not fail to make
suitable provision for present needs of the
service.
It has been customary to define in the ap
propriation acts the rank of each diplomatic
office to which a salary is attached. I sug
gest that this course be abandoned and that
it be left to the President, with the advice
and consent of the Senate, to fix from time
to time the diplomatic grade of the represen
tatives of this Government abroad as may
seem advisable; provision being definitely
made, however, as now, for the amount of
salary attached to the respective stations.
The condition of
OUR FINANCES
operations of the various branches
of the public service which are connected
with the Treasury Department are very fully
discussed in the report dfthS Secretary. It
appears that the ordinary revenues for the

From Internal Revenue 121,588.072 51
From all other sources 81,886,307 6o
Total ordinary revenues $848,519,869 92

Total ordinary expenditures.. $200,918,433 88
Leaving a surplus of $57,608,896 08
As compared with the preceding fiscal year,
there was a net decrease of over $21,000,000 in
the amount of expenditures. The aggregate
receipts were less than those Of the previous
year by about $54,000,000. The falling off ' of
reveiuie from customs made up nearly $20,
000.000 of this deficiency, and about $28,000,000
of the remaining was due to the diminished
receipts from Internal taxation.
The Secretary estimates the total receipts
for the fiscal vcar. which will end June 80.
1885. at $330,000,000, and the total expenditures
at 3w,03u,au.ie. in wnicn are included tne in

1 concur with the secretary of the Treasury
in recommending the immediate suspension
oi tne oi
SILVER DOLLARS
and of the issuance of silver certificates.
This is a matter to which, in former commu
nications, I have more than once invoked the
attention oi tne national Legislature, it ap
pears that annually for the past six years
there have been coined, in compliance with
requirements of the act of February 28, 1878,
more than twenty-seven million silver dollars.
The number now outstanding, is reported
by the Secretary to be nearly $185,000,000. when
but little more than $40,000,000, or less than
twentv-two per cent, are in actual circulation.
The mere existence of this'f act seems to me to
lurnish of itself a cogent argument for the re
peal oi tne statute wnicn nas made such ract
possible, nut tnere are otner and graver
considerations that tend In the same
direction. The Secretary avows his Con
viction that unless this coinage and the is
suance of silver certificates be suspended
silver is likely at no distant day to become
our sole metallic standard. The com
merclal disturbance and the impairment of
tne .national credit that would be thus occa
stoned can scarcely be overestimated
hope the Secretary's suggestions respecting
tne witnarawai irom circulation oi tne one
dollar and two dollar notes will receive your
approval.
It is likely that a considerable nort ion of
the silver now encumbering the vaults of the
Treasury might thus find its way into the
currency, while trade dollars have ceased
for the present, at least, to be an element of
active disturbance in our currency system
some provision should be made for their sur
render to the Government. In view of the cir
cumstances under which they were coined
and of the fact that they have -never had a
legal tender quality, there should
De ottered for them only a slight advance
over their bullion value. The Secretary in
the course of his report considers the pro
priety of beautifying the designs of our sub
sidiary silver coins auu oi soincreasingtneir
weight that they may bear their due ratio of
value of the standard dollar. His eonclu
sions in this regard are cordially approved.
In my annual message of 1882, I recom
mended the abolition of all excise taxes, ex
cept those relating to distilled spirits
This recommendation is now renewed. In
case these taxes shall be-abolished. the reve
nues that will still remain to the Government
will, in my opinion, not only suffice to meet
its reasonable expenditures, but will afford
surplus large enougn to permit suca

as may seem to be advisable when toe re

trade ana tnus relieving tne depression un

The Secretary of the Treasury advises that
the duty of Investigating this subject be in
trusted. In the first instance, to a competent
commission. While fully recognizing the
considerations that may be urged against
this course, I am nevertheless of the opinion
that, upon the whole, no other would be
likely to effect speedier or better results
That portion of the Secretary's report which
concerns the condition ot our shipping
interests can not iau to command you
attention. He emphatically recommend
that as an incentive to the investment of
American capital in American steamships
the Government shall, by liberal payments
for mall transportation or otherwise, lend its
active assistance to individual enterprise.
and declares his belief that unless
that course be pursued our foreign
carrying trade must remain as it Is to-day
almost exclusively in the hands of foreign
ers. One phase of this subject Is now
especially prominent, in view of the
repeal by the act of June 26, 1884.
of all statutory provisions arbitrarily
compelling American vessels to carry the
mails to and from the United States, as it
necessary to make provision to compensate
the owners of such vessels for performing
that service. After April, 1885, it i- hoped
the whole subject will receive early consid
eration that will lead to the enactment
such measure for the revival of our mer
chant marine as the wisdom of Congress may
devise.
The three per cent, bonds of the Govern
ment to the amount of more than $100,000,000
have since my last annual message been re
deemed by the Treasury. The bonds of
issue still outstanding amount to little
$200,000,000, about one-fourth of whioh will
be retired through the operations of the
sinking fund during the coming year.
these bonds still continue the chier basis for
the circulation of the National BankB the
question how. to avert the contraction of the
currency caused bytheir retirement is one
constantly increasing importance.

INDIAN QUESTION.
that the last year has been notable for its
frfeedom from Indian ButbrCakS:
In defiance of the President s proclama
tion of Jnly L 1884, certain Intruders sought
to make settlements ih the Indian Territory.
They were promptly removed by a detach

approval of the Senate. A similar bill re-
orted favorably to the House of Represen
itivcs by one of its committee, 18 still pend
ing before that body.
It is hoped that during the coming session
the measure may become a law, and here
after immediate steps may be taken to se
cure a place of safe deposit for these valu
able collections, now in a state of insecurity.
RIVERS AND HARBORS.
The funds with which the works for the im
provement of rivers and harbors were prose
cuted, during the nast year were derived
from the appropriations of the act of August
is.a, together with such tew balances as
were on hand from previous appropriations.
The balance In the Treasury subject to requi
sition July 1, 1883, was $10,021,649.55.
ifi amount nnnropriaiea aunnirtne nscai
year, 1884, was $4,816,684. 62, and the amount
drawn from the Treasury during the fiscal
year was $8,228,703.54, leaving a balance of
$8,112,580.63 in the Treasury subjeot to requi
sition July 1, 1884. The Secretary of War sub
mits the report of Chief of Engineers as to
the practicability of
PROTECTING OUR IMPORTANT CITIES
a
on the seaboard by fortifications and other
defenses able to repel modern methods of at
tack. The time has now come when such de
fenses can be prepared with confidence that
they will not prove abortive; and when the
possible result of delay in making' sudh
preparation is seriously considered, delay
seems Inexcusable for the most important
cities, those whose destruction or capture
would be a national humiliation. Adequate
defenses, inclusive of guns, may be made by
the gradual expenditure of $60,000,000, a snm
much less than a victorious enemy could levy
as a contribution. An appropriation of about
one-tentn ot .tnat amount is asKea to Degin
the work, and 1 concur with the Secretary of
Waih Urging that it be granted.
The War Department is proceeding with
the conversion of ten-Inch smooth bore guns
into eight-inch rifles by lining the former with
tu oes oi iorgea or ox couea wrougat iron.
Fifty guns will be thus converted with the
gears. This, however, does not obviate the
necessity of providing means for the con
struction of guns of the highest power, both
for the pnrposes of coast defense and for the
armament oi war vessels.
The report, of the Gun Foundry Board, ap
pointed April 2. 1888, in pursuance of the act
of March 6. 1883, was transmitted to Congress
in a special message of February 8, 1884. In
my message of March 26. 1884, 1 called atten
tion to the recommendation ot the Board
that the Government should encourage the
production of private stcdl works of the re
quired material for' heavy cannon, and that
two Government factories, one for the ftrrriy
and eneferthe navy should De established tor
the fabrication of guns from such material.
NO action having been taken the board was
subsequently reconvened to determine
more fully the plans and estimates necessary
for carrying out its recommendation.
- It has received information which Indicates
that there are responsible steel manufac
turers in this country whoalthough not pro
vided with the necessary plant, are willing to
construct the same and to make bids for con
tracts with the Government for the supply of
tne requisite material Tor tne neaviest guns
adapted to modern warfare. If a guarantee
order of sufficient magnitude, accompanied
a positive appropriation extending over a
series of years shall be mode- by
Congress all doubts as to the feasi
bility of the plan being thus removed- I re
new my recommendation that such action be
taken by Congress as will enable the Govern
ment to construct its own ordnance upon its
own territory, and so to provide the arma
ments demanded by considerations of na
tional safety and honor. The report of the
Secretary of the Navy exhibits the
firogress which has been made on
he new steel cruisers authorized by
the acts of August 5, 1885 and March 3, 1883. of
the four vessels under contract one, the
Chicago, of 4,500 tons, is more than half finish
ed ; the Atlanta, 3,000 tons, lias been success
fully launched, and her machinery Is now fit
ting; the Boston, also of 3,000 tons, is ready
for launching, and ths Dolphin dispatch
steamer of 1,500 tons, is ready for delivery.
Certain adverse criticisms upon the de
signs of these cruisers are discussed by the
Secretary, who Insists that the correctness of
the conclusions reached by the Advisory
Board and by the department has been de
monstrated by recent development in ship
building abroad. The machinery of the
double turreted monitors, Puritan, Terror
and Amphitrite, contracted for under the act
of March 8, 1883, is in process of construction.
No work has been done during the past year
on their armor, for lack of the necessary ap
propriations. A fourth monitor, the Monad
nock, still remains unfinished at the Navy
Yard in California.
It Is recommended that early steps be taken
to complete these vessels and to provide also
an armament for the monitor Miantonomah.
The recommendations of the Naval Advisory
Board, approved bv the Department, com
prise the construction of one steel cruiser of
4,suu tons, one cruiser oi .i.owi tons, two ncavuy
armed gunboats, one light cruising gun
boat, ono dispatch vessel armed with
Hotchkiss cannon, one armoi-ed ram and
three torpedo boats. The general designs.
all of which are calculated to meet tne exist
ing wants of the service, are now well ad
vanced, and the construction of the vessels
can be undertaken as soon as you shall grant
the necessary authority. The act of Cou-
gress, approved August 7. 1882, authorized the
removal to the United States of the bodies of
Lieutenant Commander Geo. W. DeLong- and
his companions, or tne jeannette Kxpeoi
tion.
This removal has been successfully accom
plished by Lieutenants Harbor and Schuetze.
The remains were taken from the grave in
tne l.ena Delta In March, issi. ana were re
talned at Yakutsk until the following winter
the season being too far advanced to admit
of their immediate transportation. They
arrived at New York February 20, 1884, where
they were received with suitable honors.

The report of
THE POSTMASTER GENERAL
acquaints you with the present condition anu
needs of the postal service. It discloses the
gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from
the reduction id rate of letter postage, as
recommended In niy message of December,
1882, and effected by the act of March 8, 1883,
has been much less than was generally anti
cipated. My recommendation of this reduC
tion was based upon the belief that the
actual falling off in receipts from letter pos
tage for the year Immediately succeeding the
change of rate, would be $3,000,000. It has
proved to be only $2,276,000. This Is a trust
worthy indication that the revenue will soon
be restored to its former volume by natural
Increase of sealed correspondence.
I confidently repeat, therefore, the rec
ommendation of my last annual message,
that single rate postage upon drop letters be
reduced to one cent wherever payment of
two cents is now required by law". .The
double rate is only exacted at offices where?
the carrier system is in operation, and it ap
pears that at these offices the increase in tax
upon local letters defrays the cost not only
of Its own collection and delivery, but of the
collection and delivery of all other mall mat
ter. This is an inequality that ought no
longer to exist,
I approve the recommendation of the
Postmaster General that the unit of weight In
the rating of first-class matter should be
bne ounce instead of one-half ounce, as it
now is. In view of the statistics furnished
by the Department It may, welL.be doubted
whether the change w6ula result in any loss
of revenue; that it would greatly promote
the convenience of the public is beyond die
pute. The free delivery system has been
lately -applied to five cities, and the
total number of offices in which it
is now In operation is one hundred
and fifty-nine. Experience shows that Its
adoption under proper conditions is equally
an accommodation to the public and an ad
vantage to the postal service. It is more
than self-sustaining, and for the reasons
urged by the Postmaster General may prop
erly be extended. It Is the opinion of that
officer that It is proper to provide means
Whereby exceptional dispatch in dealing
with letters ih free delivery offices may be
Secured by payment of extraordinary post
age. This scheme might be made
effective by employment of a special stamp
the cost of which should be commensurate
with the . expense of the extra service. In
some bf the large cities private express com
panies have undertaken to outstrip the Gov
ernment mall carriers by affording for the
prompt transmission of letters better facili
ties than have heretofore been at the com
mand of the post-office.
It has always been the policy of the Gov
ernment to discourage such enterprises, and
in no better mode oan that policy be main
tained than in supplying the public with the
most efficient mall service that with due re
gard to Its own best Interests can be furnish
ed for Its accomodation.
The Attorney General renews the recom
mendation contained in his report of last

his observations respecting our Indian af

ment, and the operations of the Pension
Office, the Patent Office, the Census Bureau
and the Bureau of Education. Allusion nas

both as between different Indian
tribes and as between Indians and
the whites, the ' past year BaS been
one of unbroken peace. In this circumstance

will be reaa with interest. It discloses the
results of recent legislation looking to tho
prevention and punishment of polygamy in
that Territory. I still believe that if that
abominable practice can be suppressed by
law it can only be by the most radical legis
lation consistent witn tne restraints or me
constitution.
I again recommend, therefore, that Con
gress assume absolute political control of
the Territory of Utah, and provide for the
Appointment of a commission With such
Governmental powers as in its Judgment
may justly and wisely be put into their
hands. In the cause of this, communica
tion reference has more than once been
made to the policy of this Government as
rcgaros tne extention oi our
FOREIGN TRADE.
It seems proper to declare the general orin
ciples that should, in my opinion, underlie
our National efforts In; this direction. The
main conditions of the problem may be thus
stated: We are a people in mechanical pur
suits and fertile In Invention; we covers
vast extent of territory rich In agricultural
products and nearly all the raw materials
necessary for successful manufacture: we
have a system of productive establishments
more than sufficient to supply our own de
mands; the wages of labor are no
where else so greaft the scale of living
of our artisan classes is sucn as tenus to
secure their personal comfort and tho de
velopment ot those nigner inorais ana intel
lectual qualities that go to the making of
good citizens.
Our system of tax and tariff legislation Is
yielding a revenue which Is In excess of the
present needs of the Government. These
are elements from which it is sought to de-
Vise a scheme by which, without unfavorably
changing the condition of the workingmen,
our merchant marine shall be raised from
fenfoehled condition and new markets pro
vided for that sale, beyond our borders,
the manifold fruits of our industrial enter
prises, re '
Tne propiem is complex, auu can ue &ui eu
pv no single measure ot innovation or re
form. The countries of the American Conti
nent- and the adjacent islands are for the
Uuited States the natural market of supply
and demand. It is from them that we shonld
obtain what we do not produce, or do not
produce in sufficiency, and it is to them that
the surplus productions of our fields, our
mills and our workshops should flow, un
der conditions that will equalize or favor
them In comparison with foreign competl
tion. Four paths of policy seem to point
this end: First, a series of reciprocal com
mercial treaties, with the countries
America, which shall foster between us and
them an unhamnnred movement of trade.
The condition of these treaties should be the
lree admission of such merchandise as this
country does not produce In turn for admis
sion tree or under a ravorea seueme oi au
lies of our products.
The benefits of such exchange to apply
these goods carried under the nag or tne
parties to the contract. The removal on both
sides fi-oin vessels to so privileged of all ton-
uage dues and national imports, so that their
vessels may Dlv unhindered between our
ports and those of the other contracting
parties, tuouirh without Infringing on tn
reserved home coasting trade. The remov
ul or reduction of bin ileus on the exported
products of those countries coming within
the benefits of tho treaties, and tho evidence
of the technical restrictions and penalties
which our intercourse witn tnose conntrics
is at present hampered. Secondly, the
tablishment of the consular service of
United States on a salaried footing, thus
mitting the relinquishment of consular
not only as respects vessels under the Na
tional liag. but also as respects vessels
of the treaty nations carrying goods
entitled to the benefits of the treaties.
Thirdly, the enactment of measures to favor
the construction and maintenance of a steam
carrying marine under the flag of the United
States. Fourthlv. the establishment of
uniform currency basis for the countries
America, so that the coined products or our
mines may circulate on equal terms through
out the whole system of commonwealths.
Thfs would require a monetary union
of America, whereby the output
of the bullion producing countries and
circulation of those which yield neither gold
nor silver could be adjusted in conformity
with the population, wealth and commercial
needs of each, as many of the countries fur
nish no bullion to the common stock.
surplus production of our mines and mints
might thus be utilized and a step taken

To the accomplishment of these ends,
lar as tney can De attained ny separate
treaties, the negotiations already concluded
and now In progress have been directed,
the favor with which this enlarged policy
thus far been received warrants the belief
that Its operations will ere long embrace
or nearly all. the countries of this hemisphere.
It is by no means desirable, however,
the policy under consideration should be
plied to these countries alone. The healthful
enlargement of our trade with
Asia and Africa should be sought by
ing tariff burdens on such of their wares
neither we nor the other American States
are fitted to produce, and thus enabling
selves to obtain In return a beiter
market for our supplies of food, of
materials, and of the manufacture hi
which we excel. It seemi: to me that many

Napoleon's Meanness.
The selection from the' letters end
dispatches of the First Napoleon which -has
just been published, with explana
