a«stf -1 sympathy and regard for the United
States The Emperor requested Mr. Taft, with
whom iie sppnt about five hours, to convey his
_ tJBKB to President Roosevelt.
The Secretary, accompanied by Urigadier Gen

Cptaln S. L. H. Slocum, the American mili
tary, attach^, end Count Konitz. the Russian
ofjeer who is acting as his aid during his so
journ in this city, left St. Petersburg at an
a,,, hour on a special train for Tsarskoe-Selo.
There the party was met by a state equipage
and a number of court officials. The visitors
were driven direct to the so-called "Little Pal
«c." the residence of the Emperor, and escorted
through the palace with the usual ceremonial.
Secretary Taft was received by his majesty
in his private study and spent nearly one hour
in intimate conversation. The Emperor dis
cossed military topics at considerable length.
ilf questioned Mr. Taft In regard to his Jour
ney over the Transsiberian Railroad, and
drew a contrast between present means of
communication and the method in vogue —
horsed sleighs and steamers across the rivers
3no — when he made his trip across Asia
to inaugurate the Transsiberian lines.
Hss majesty showed a keen interest in the
problems which the American government has
to solve In the Philippine Islands, and he asked
mM?:y questions concerning the new Philippine
Assembly. The Emperor referred also in a
complimentary manner to the work done by thu
American government on the Isthmus of
Panama in its fight against yellow fever.
After the audience the party went to the
ridir.sr school, where the Semenovsky Regiment,
l.>oo strong, and accompanied by a machine gun
battery and several other detachments, was
drawn up. The Emperor and Secretary Taft
were received with cheers. Then the Emperor
and his guests, accompanied by their respective
staffs, walked together through the lines of the
regiment and inspected its formation. When
this examination was over the troops passed
twice at a quickstep before the reviewing party,
and then the host and his guests returned to the
;>a!ace lor luncheon.

hi<= party were entertained at dinner by Foreign
Minister Iswoteky. There -were present also
Premier Stolypin. Minister of Finance Kokov
*c,ff. War Minister General Rudiger. Lieutenant
•General Balatzyn, chief of the general staff,
Rnj the most prominent officials of the Foreign
'.•ffice.
In proposing the health of the Secretary and
Mr?. Taft and the distinguished party accom
panying them, the Russian Foreign Minister
said that it was a keen pleasure to welcome
<nic of the leading- statesmen of the great north
ern Republic. He said he was afraid that the
crrat speed at which Secretary Taft had trav
ailed the entire breadth of the empire had en
nbled him to obtain only a bird's-eye view, yet
be hoped that the Secretary had gathered a con
viction that the sympathies of the Russian peo
ple for America were as warm as ever, a con
viction which when conveyed by him to his
Mlov countrymen would surely strengthen the
historic friendship and mutual respect of Rus
sia and America.
.Secretary Taft jn reply expressed thanks for
th» cordial welcome he had received across the
empire from Vladivostok to St. Petersburg and
from the Emperor as well as the military and
• ivil officers. The glimpse he had had of Siberia
and other parts of Russia helped him to under
stand the difficult problems presented, and the
American people, he said, were profoundly in
rested in the successful working out of these
problems so as to redound to the honor of the
Russian jrovemmerit and the happiness and
prosperity of the peonfc . The traditional friend
hip for Russia had been cherished by Ameri
cans since the Civil War, and lie said he was
g-lad to c^rry to them the message of good will
that had fallen from the Ups pC his host.
Mr:-. Taft learned to-night of the serious ill
ness of Mr. Taf t's mother and decided to aban
don her European trip and return to America

JERSEY RATE DISPUTE.
Central of That State Objects to
Xew Haven Road's Attitude.
i
Officers of the Central Railroad of New Jersey
I yesterday did not approve a statement which ap
peared In ■ Wall Street news bureau concerning
the cancellation by the New Haven of joint through
rates with the Reading, the Baltimore & Ohio and
the Central Railroad of New Jersey, by way of the
Jersey City gateway, and asserting that the prin
cipal question involved in t'.- controversy was that
of the per diem charge, and Betting forth the merits
of the Now Haven's Poughkeepsie Bridge route to
New Kn^lanci. The Now Haven, the Centra] of
New Jersey officials said, bad encouraged and ad
vised their road and its connections to work up
traffic in connection with tin .Ww Haven, which
business bad been established and was dependent
upon the Jersey City gateway. »
The Poughkeepsie poute. they declared, was im
possible for the class of traffic now being handled
via the Jersey City gateway. Within the last two
or three years the New Haven company had re
quested that certain business be diverted to the
Poughkeepsie Bridge route, and in this the Jer
ney Central had acQuiesced; and in the confer
ences between th«! New Haven and the New J«r
se3' Central the latter company ha.l urged that if
relief via the New York gateway was what the
New Haven Company desired it should be afforded
by c-ach of the three companies, i. c.. the P«»nnsyl
vanir. the L«ehlgh Valley and the Jersey Central,
diverting a percentage of their traffic via the
l'oughkeepsie Bridge* route, the connection with '
that route being identically the same for each of '
the three companies— Baton and the Jersey j
Central, independent of the action of the other •
two companies, had actually made use. to the ex-
tent Of its ability, of that route. ;
In the matter of the 50 cents per diem which the
New Haven company states is such a drain upon
Its finances, the New Jersey Central men cay it '
should be borne in mind that prior to the advent
of per diem settlement for car hire the New Haven
company, upon the mileage basis, paid a compara
tively insignificant sum for the use of the equip
ment owned by other railroad companies, and
upon which and with which It earned its revenue.
With the advent of per diem the New Haven com
pany found itself in the unpleasant predicament of
having to pay for the vehicles In which it con
ducted its transportation.

REICHSTAG'S LIVELY DAY.
Emperor Suspends tin Conrt of
Honor Proceedings.
Berlin, Der. 4.— Prince yon Billow, the Impe
rial Chancellor, trap won in a short, Fhart con
test with the wavering National Liberals. They
and rill the parliamentary parties forming a
coalition. Including two Conservative and three
Radical groups, again agreed In caucuses late
this afternoon to support the government. Tin 1
leaders met and arranged a programme for to
morrow, which will begin with a vote of confi
dence in tho Chancellor. This ended a day of
much political confusion and excitement.
The question remains whether the parties rep
resenting such diverse Interests can continue to
co-operate In supporting the government on the
variety of controversial measures pending.
Prince yon Bttlow solved his Immediate embar
rassments by using the National Liberal criti
cism of the government's financial measures a.s
nn opportunity to have a straight-out talk with
the coalition leaders over the continuous doubt
as to whether the government really was able to
command a. majority.
This doubt has existed since the election early
in the year, it being constantly affirmed by the
goveramenfa opponents that the "blue" parties
could not possibly keep together. Tho Chan
cellor amazed tho Reichstag by quietly calling
together Herr yon Narir.ann and Karon yon
(.amp. Conservatives; Hrrr Ernst l?assi'irnann.
National Liberal: Herr Miiller and Herr Mem
K<n, Radicals: Liebermann yon Sonncnberg.
Agrarian, and seme others in his room at the
Reichstag this morning.
The substance of his communication was that
lie would ask the Emperor for leave to retire
unless be could r«'ly upon a majority from tho
coalition. H<>. therefore, asked the leaders to
discuss the situation with their followers and
a..".onea '..".one themselves, and see if they would prom
ise unity. It was presumed that the Chancellor
was acting with tho Emperor's full approval.
Minister of War yon Einem announced In the
Reicafltag that the Emperor had ordered the
suspension of the court of honor proceedings
;i^.ihjst (Joneral Count WHhelm yon Hohenau,
•uho. together with Major Count Johannes
Lynar, was compromised by the testimony given
in the Yon Moltkc-Harden libel suit. The Mln-
Ister of War said that Count yon Hohenau and
Count Lynar had presented themselves for trial
and that the cases would take tho usual course.
This announcement created a great sensation.
These remarks were ca'.led forth by a remark
able speech delivered by Dr. Herman P. Paasche.
First Vice-President of the Iteichsta*:. in tho
course of which he held up a bundfe of letters
which he said had been written by Count yon
Hohenau from the Imperial headquarters at
Wlllhelrrsshohe to Herr Bollhardt, who was a
■witness at tho Harden trial, which Indicated
that Yon Hohenau had had meretricious rela
tions with Bollhardt. At tho trial Bollhardt testi
fied to havine taken part In th«» orgios at the
vi'in of Count Lynar.
Hrrr Paasche sharply criticised the adminis
tration for allowing the Imperial expenditures
to exceed the revenues and for contracting- th»>
\<\k loans that yearly are- necessary. Ho de
manded] a general property tax for Imperial pur
poees on all property valued above JIU.iiQO and
also a military <-xemption tax on all men re

SUBPOSNA EOIi BELMOXT.

Albany, Dec. 4.— Subpoenas were Issued to-day for
August Belmont and H. H. Vreeland, of New York,
to appear before the l*ublic Service Commission, In
j the Id District, on December 10. The subpoenas
followed developments at the hearing before th«
; commission to-day on the complaint of Mayor
: Coyne of Tonkera. against th^ Tonkers Railroad
. Company, for failure to operate can on a newly
i opened branch In Yonkers, obtained under a fran
| chise, one of tho conditions of which was that .in
i S-cent fare should be charged from Yonkers to the
i City Hall, New York, via the subway.
While Mr. Belmont and Mr. Vreeland were sum
! mooed primarily to substantiate certain statements
■ made by E. A. Maher. the president of the Tonkera
Railroad Company, the commission announced that
before reaching a decision it would bo necessary
[ to find who was th*; present owner of the Yonkers
Railroad, and It Is likely that the witnesses will bo
asked to explain the relations between the Tankers
company] the Interborough, the Third Avenue Rail
j way and the New York City Railway Company.
President Maher was asked who was the owner
of the <•;.;• Til stock of the Tonkeiti Railroad Com
pany at the present time. He replied that he was
unable to tell.
"Where is the stock book of the Yonkers Rail
road Company kept?" asked Commissioner Stevens.
"I do not know." replied Mr. Maher.
• 'liairman Stevens then nolntt-tl out that the Yon
v.-is Railroad Company was compelled by law to
keep the stock book at It.- priacipaJ office under
a penalty of a tin.- of $50 for each day's 'violation]
He directed Mr. Manor's attention to the necessity
of obeying the law.
In explanation of the railroad company first ■•- -
cepting -i franchise with an B-cenl fare condi
tion and then refusing to operate under the fran
chise Mr. Mail- Bald that before the franchise
was accepted he had nonsuited Mr. ' Vreeland, who
told him that Mr. Belmont was willing to enter into
a .transfer agreement with the Yonkers company.
Acting on iii statement, Mr. Maher said that the
Vnnk*-rs road had built and equipped a line only
to have the board or directors of tn<- Interborough
refuse to enter Into any such arrangement.
Chairman Stevens announced thai the commission
would like to hear what Mr. Vreeland and .Mr. Bel
rnont bad to say on this subject, in order to deter
mine whether sufficient assurances bad been given
the Yonkers Railroad Company to warrant its
accepting the conditional franchise. Mr Maher
asserted that the citizen, of Vonkera and the Com
in- Council were willing to permit the road to
charge a tfl-cent rate in the circumstances.

XO STATE BOX I) MARKET.
Officers Have Financial Problem on
Their Hands.
By Telegraph to Tho Tribune. •
Albany. Dec. 4.— State officers seem to have a
difficult financial problem on their hands, the ques
tion of rinding a market for state bonds, because
of the disturbed conditions of the money market,
and the advocates of improved highways and barge
canal are worried. The latter project calls for
' an expenditure of $101,000,000 and the improved high
way system involves an outlay of J00.000,000 more.
The state is permitted to issue 3 per cent bonds I
lor the canal improvements and •) per cent bonds i
for road work. ; ,\ ■ ■:
Since the tirst issue of tli.-.se bonds the money
market has been in such it condition as to make
the purchase of New York State bonds unattract
ive. The state has a. surplus of about $IS,UOO,OUO,
which is deposited in various bunks^of the state.
These deposits are protected by surety bonds,
which are furnished at the rate of- 12 50 for each
$I,ooo* deopsltiKl or by the depositing of state bonds
to. the extent of the deposit. The state exacts in
terest on its deposits at the rate of 2^2 per cent.
It is not profitable for the banks to buy state bonds
and offer them as security for state deposits, and
the result has been that the state has bought in i
nearly all of Its canal and highway bonds.
One suggestion Is that If the requirements of
interest \on state posits were withdrawn the
banks would - probably buy the slat, bonds. It is I
.-.. I.i that under this plan the state could exact i
th.- .requirement that, slate bonds must be given .

Political Possibilities.
neoref A. Knight, the Rei-üblican national
committeeman from California, who seconded
the nomination of President Roosevelt in l'. M^
arrived here last night from San Francisco on
his way to Washington to attend the meeting
of the national committee which will be held
to-morrow.
Mr. Knight spoke enthusiastically of the Pres-
Ideni and of his policies, and declared that the
people of the Pacific Coast would stand unani
mous for his nomination if he those to run for a
third term. It is Mr. Knight's opinion that
whether or not the Presldeni is willing to ac
cept the nomination, his policies are bound to
dominate the Republican national convention of
190&
Th* California committeeman expressed him
self as heartily in favor of nominating ■ Sooth
erner for Republican Vice-President H* said
the West was in favor of it. and declared that
the development of the Mississippi River and its
tributaries and the opening of the 1 Panama
Canal would bring tho West and South closer
together. He prophesied a great boom for in
land commerce with the completion of the
canal and tho development of commerce along
the Mississippi River and its branches, and said
there was no doubt thai tho West would be ma
terially benefited.
Mr. Knight, who is a well known lawyer in
San Francisco, an orator »f national reputation
and one of th<» most prominent Republican*
west of the Mississippi River, seconded the
nominations of James G. Blalne for President
in ISS4. President McKinley In 1896 and Presi
dent Roosevelt In 11)04. He has been the <oun-
Eel for the Union Pacific Railroad, and has had
full charge of various estates In California, in
cluding the Fair estate, of $18,000,000. He came
to New York to attend to some personal busi
ness, and will leave here for Washington to-day,
where he will meet the President.
Asked about the feeling in the West concern
ing the possibility of tho President's accept
ance of a third term, Mr. Knight said:
"Tho Republicans west of the Missouri River,
and particularly on the Pacific Slope, would
renominate President Roosevelt for another
term If he would but giv« tha slightest intima
tion that be would accept. His policies as laid
down in his speeches and messages have ap
pealed strongly throughout our section, and
whether he will accept another nomination or
not I am sure that so far as our "Western people
are concerned his policies -will not only
dominate the next national convention but will
have a deciding Influence In the naming of the
next President of the L T nited States."
Mr. Knight, when asked who, la his opinion,
might he tho selection for Vice - President at
tlit> forthcoming Republican national convention*
replied:
"After looking over the field I am convinced,
no matter whom the Republicans nominate for
President, that the time is opportune to give the
second place on our national ticket to a South
ern man. I do not sco why we ran afford any
longer to ignore such a great body >•• Ameri
cana who have demonstrated not only their lit
ness as citizens, but have in tiroes of stress
stood shoulder to shoulder with us or the North

The removal of the other member, John J. Moore,

Mechanical Engineers Hear Paper
on Use of Lore Grade Fuels.
Th* mechanical engineers attending the twenty
olffhtli annual meeting in this city of the American
Society of Mechanical KnKlneers were the guest*
yesterday of Charles M. Jacobs, chief engineer of
tho Hudson companies, who took them through the
tunnels unrtfr the Hudson River. Nearly all th"
members took advantage of the Invitation, going |
to Hobuken after luncheon. Then- they inspected
UM borings and cuts through the reck, and after
that the work lion-- under th.- rtver.
in the morning £nreial technical papers wer
read on -gas power, Its production and use. Chief
in popular interest was that by rrofessor K. X
Jung( , on "The Rational Use of Low Grade Fuels
with Special Consideration of the Application of
<;as Producers." - Trofessor Jungo Is a member of ,
the Verein Deutscher Ingenieurie. j
. -The question whether an exhaustion of what .
W. have termed our irreplaceable fuel resources, :
he said? -is a danger for the life and prosperity
of future generations can only discussed on
the basis of theoretical prognostications and spec
ulative arguments. The other question, whether
for the benefit of present activities it is wise to
economize in the methods of utilization of those re
sources, cannot be answered but in the affirmative.
That Individual or company or nation will be su
perior commercially to others which can get the
most efficient se.-vlee from the cheapest reliable
source of labor, whether manual or mechanical.
Never is superior talent engaged for low class
work. if there Is an alternative available to get
adequate help at low prices. Likewise it is but a
natter of political prudence for a nation to ex- ,
l»loit the low grade fuel materials of the country. ■
such as peat, dust coals and refuse, if they can i
be used for the generation of heat, light and j
power, instead of wasting anthracite and coke, and j
to reserve the latter coals for more profitable and
important uses in the metallurgical and other in- !
dustries. An efficient utilization of coal, generally
speaking, tends toward the preservation of national
values, making a country self-supporting and in
dependent of th« world's markets. It also aids the
prevention of hygienic abuses which, if not
amended, are apt prematurely to weaken the earn
ing capacity and the Industrial activity of a. na
tion." •
