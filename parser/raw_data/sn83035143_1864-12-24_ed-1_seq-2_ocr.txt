MrVAjshleVo tHf, Introduced into the
Eons provides for tie appointment, by
the-PresideatjOf the Provisional Governors
of tkqBebel States, who sHHiee that the
Iawi of thoUnitsd States and of the Stales
before the Rebellion are enforced. But no
law or usage recognizing slavery shall be
recognized by any officer or Court in
such Stale : It emancipates all slaves in
such Slate and their posterity forevar, and
provide! for the ; discharge, on habeas cor
pus, of persons held to service on pretence
of ownership.
It provides for the punishment of at
tempts to ro-enelave emancipated persons
It declares that officers of the rank of Col
onel or higher, in the Eeuol service, are
not citizens of the United States. The sev
enth section is in these words:
JThe United States, in Congress here as"
sembled, do hereby recognize the Govern"
mant ol the State of Louisiana, inaugura"
ted under and by the convention of the
people of Louisiana, which assembled, on
the 6lh day ot April, 1864, at the city of
Hew Orleans, and declare the same to be
entitled to the guarantee and all other
rights of a Mate government under the
Constitution of the United States;'
This important section, tie accomplish
ment of General Banks' reconstruction pol
icy, is said to have been agreed to by the
re-construction committees or Vuiix How
es. It is understood that Henry Winter
I?ftvlJ even ha pronued to support it.
The conclusion" to report this seventh
section is said to have been reached
through an interview with the Presiding
in which it was intimated that his approv
al of the bill depended on Us insertion
:The bill funher provides for the calling of
conventions in States whose governments
have been usurped and overthrown, ss socn
as the military resistance to the United
States shall have been suppressed, and the
people shall have sufficiently returned to
their allegiance. The conventions aro re
quired to provide that persons in Kebel civ

grade of Colonel shall not vote for, or be a
member of, the Legislature, or Governor,
Involuntary servitude is prohibited, and
the freedom of all persons is to boguaran
teed in the said States. No debt, State or
Confederate, created by the usurping pow

Speech of the Hon. E. P. Spalding. SPEECH OF THE HON R. P.
SPALDING,
In the House of Representatives,
Dec. 19, 1864.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Mr. ChairaLas : When, at the last sit
ting of the Committee of the Whole House
on the Etate of the Union, I submitted the
motion which at this time gives me the
floor, my only purpose was to bring about
an adjournment of the House. But as, by
parliamentary rule, the privilege 01 speak
ing is accorded to me, I shall improve the
opportunity to congratulate the commit
tee and country upon the dignified and
patriotic cnaracter or tne . rrcsiaeni s
message, which is, by a like rule, made
the first subject for our consideration.
The l resident gives us to understand in
this, his annual message, that the condition
of our foreign affairs is "reasonably satis
factory" that is to say, that amicable re
lations with all foreign Powers is still pre
served through the arts of diplomacy. He
says, however, that unforeseen political
difficulties have arisen on the "northern
boundary of the United States," and, "in
view of the insecurity of life and property
in the region adjacent to the Canadian
border, by reason of recent assaults and de
predation, committed by inimical and des
perate persons, who are harborta inert, it
hss been thought proper to give notice
that, after the expiration of six months,
lie period conditionally stipulated in tne
existing arrangement with Groat Britain
tne United elates must nolo themselves at
liberty to increase their naval armament

wealthy, intelligent, and highly patriotic
population in the immmediate vicinity of
one ol tno6o of tnese great i&Kea, wnose
peaceful waUrs have the last summer been
widely violated by the marauders from
Canada. I desire to thank the President
for this signal manifestation of executive
firmness and sagacity.
It snould sot be lorgotten mat tnis
House of Bepresontatives,at its last session,
acc-pted wUhagocd degree of unsnitniry a
joint resolution, eminating from the Com
mittee on .Kaval Anairs, requesting tne
Executive to give to Great Britain this
very notice so vitally important to the
commerce of the lakes and to the security
of the inhabitants living upon their bor
ders. This resolution ''fell asleep" in the
Senate.
AncCher resolution touching the interests
of the .British iTovmces in a strictly com'
mercial point, and giving reciprocity in
fact where none existed bat in name, has
recently passed this House, in accordance
with the lust expectations ol tne people,
and thav seem now to bo waiting some
what impatiently the further aouon or co
ordinate branches of the Government.
Air. Chairman, I am fully awaro of the
delicacy of cur reifitio-s with Groat Britain,
and have no disposition at this moment
to provoke pen hostilities with her; but I
am tree to coniefs that I do not look upon
that Power as a friend to the United States.
She is greatly ambitious to ba the loader of
the nations by means ot her lupremacy on
he ocean, and the Is pre-eminently selnh
in all thit appertains to commerce and
trade. In both of these particulars, a navy
commercial marine, the United States
having peace within her own bordus,
would speedily overshadow fcer. Neither
do I fear Great Britain. This Government
has no occasion to fear her, for, with all her
wealth and military and nsv.il strength,
ibe ioyal people of the United Statos axe,
at this moment, with the "great rebellion"
on their hands, more than a match for her.
Vv hi; we deprecile war with foreign na-

rest way to avert that calamity is to be fuljy
pre pared for the emergency. raRilIani-
mojs legislation em ptsinammoua ai
plomacy will bring ruin upon a
nation sooner than armed legions. It is
therefore the true policy of our Bpubiic
to be continually '-girding on her armor,"
to erect fortifications upon her exposed
coasts and borders, to establish dock-yards
and depots upon tho shores ot our inland
seas, as well as upon tho shores of our two
great oceans.
The message miorms us lLai ue nnan
cial affairs of the Government have boen
beneficaily affected by the legislation of
the la3t session of Congress. That receipts
Into the Troasury from all sources during
th9 year, in casn, were $681,076,640, of
which, there was dunked irom customs
$102 316,152; from lands, 1538,333; from
direct taxes, $473,618; from internal rev
enue, $109, 741,184; from miscellaneous
sources,- 747,oii,4b; ana irom loans,
$628,413,929. The disbursements were, in
the sum total, $S05,234,087, of which the
War Department consumed J690,7yi,84i
and the Navy Department, $85,733,292
These estimates, it win be noted, were
made on the 1st day of July, 1864, at which
time the increased tariff and internal du
ties were hardly felt atthe national Treas
ury. The national debt at that date, was
$1,740,C90,439. It is believed that by a
judicious revision of the system of tariff
and taxation, ana especially oy me impo
sition of a resonable duty upon sales of all
sorts, the internal revenue may be made
to exceed the sum ot $300,000,000 a year,
without being burdensome to our people.
What a picture that will present oi the
unfathomable resources 01 our great na
tion I Not yet fourscore years of age, and
with one-third of the btates in open and
active rebellion for four years, sustaining
an army of a million men, and a navy of
seven burdred ships of war, and yet not
one dollar borrowed, except from our own
loyal citizens I And still we have but a
faint conception 01 tne wonaeriui resources
of the United States Government and
people.' I am persuaded that I speak
within the bounds of modesty and truth
when I say that a single article of com
merce, almost unknown to the arts at
the breaking out of the rebellion, will com'
mand annually, in the market, money
enough to pay the interest on our national
debt.
It is gratifying to learn from the mes
sage that, notwithstanding the exactions
for the military service, some nine thous
and persons had been enabled to enter
lands tor tarms during toe nve quarters
preceding the 30th day of September last,
under the benign provisions of the home-
sload law. This is the only legitimate
mole of making sovereigns in our country
lords of the soil and they will be very
apt to standjby the Government whence
they nave derived weir uue 01 aggran
diiement.
It is painful to hear of the devastating
effects of war upon our fighting popula
tion; and, at the same time, wo are happy
to know that republics aro not all of them
ungrateful. The .resident tells us taere
have been placed on the Army pension
roils, during the year, twenty-two thousand
one hundred and ninety-eight widows, or
phans, and mothers. The number seems
large, but we must increase the list until
every dependent relative of a diseased aol-
aier snail, oy tne county ei tne uovern-
ment, be made secure against want. An en,
and not till then, shall wo be permitted to
sing --
- BOW tlMp IH DrT, WHO KU to refT,
JIt all liwtr country vlibe bleat."
Wo are told by the President, in his own
peculiar style, that society is " being mold
ed for durability in the Lnion;" and as
evidence cf the fact, he points to the
Monumental City, and says, in words that
thrill the patriotic breast, " Maryland is
secure to litarty and Union tor ell the fu
ture. The genius of rebellion will no
more claim Maryland." All honor to
Mary kind ! Ail honor to the noble men
who have been instrumental in rescuing
that old and respected -Commonwealth
from the incubus of slavery! Henceforth
Maryland is destined to shine, in the galaxy
vl States, u a tr of the first magnitude,
JltL respetful lutrousion I Here ti-
fathers in the days of Virginia's manhood
should object to our national charter be
and cause it contained a negative upon pro-
j
ture to suggest that the President has him
self performed an official act since the
commencement of the present session of
Congress that will do more in the future
toward " molding society for durability in
the Union" than any conceivable action of
any one State.
The President adverts m his message to
the recent quadrennial election as evidence
of the will of the people in favor of the
constitutional amendment for the prohibi
tion of slavery throughout the United
8tates. He is clearly right in this, so far
as regards the sentiments of at least three
fourths ot tne voters 01 tne loyai estates.
It is in vain that politicians plant them
selves upon the track of progress and at-
tempt to impeae we car 01 ireeaomi u
in vain that the learned, eloqnent, but er
ralio Kepicsentntives from the city of New
York invokes "toleration" in behalf of an
institution that he says "was tolerated by
the Savior and H a apostles." The enlight
ened sense oftheege in which we live im
peratively demands thecompleto extinc
tion of slavery; the voices of two hund
red thousand of our sons who have fallen a
sacrifice upon the altar of freedom, cry to
us from their graves, "Extinguish Slavery!"
The widows and orphans of the slaughter
ed soldiers implore to us "abolish slavery."
Two hundred thousand stalwart men with
bayonets in their hands, once slaves, but
now soldioi s, admonish us to wipe out the
foul stain of slavery; but. above all, right
ano justice and the perpetuity of our free
institutions of government call upon us to
remove this curse trom tne lana.
And whv should gentlemen on the oth
er tide of the House he?itate in this matter ?
Have thev not always, as partisan politr
ticians, expressed a desire to abolish
slavery so soon as they could do it in a
constitutional manner? And now what
ai o .. a.-A.' Kj7- thftir votes?
Simply to aid the majority by giving a
two-thirds vote, so that the proposition to
amend the Constitution may be submitted
to the people of the States through their
Representatives in the legislative bodies
If they refuse to do this, what is the just
inference? That they are so wedded to
the institution of slavery that they will
net trust tho people with the privilege of
saying whether or not it snail continue us
existence in the land. If they refuse to do
this, what is the inovitable conse
quence? The Thirty-ninth Congress will
adopt the measures within one week of its
organiztion, and then the iaue will be
with the country, in all time to come,
which body most truly represented the
interests and wishes of the great American
people.
In connection with this subject of amend'
ing the Constitution so as to prohibit
slavery in the land, I commend to the con
sideration ot gentlemen on both sides of
the House the MlowiDg historical fact:
Colonel George Mascn, of Virginia, one of
tha distinguished statesmen who assisted
in frjminz the Constitution, nevertheless
refused to give it the sanction of his name,
ar.8 protested against Its adoption for this
among older reasons oy mm puo::ciy as
signed :
'Ihe general Legislature (Congress) is
restrained from prohibiting the lurlner lm
portat:on of slaves for twenty odd years:
though such importations render the United
btates weakir, more tumeraou ana lest
eavablt of defense"
Is it not passing strange that one ol tue
hibition of tto slave trade, and, at this
day, alter tnree lourths ci a century s ex
perience of the wisdom of that objection
there should be fjucd in this Hall men
nurtured in the lap of freedom and blessed
with ail the precious privileges, appertain
ing to free institutions who by their voices

air. Uhairman, I did not intend to mtkc
an anu-elavn.'y -t.eoca on this floor,
agree with the genueman iroinitw lor
in his declaration publicly made at thu
last session, that "bLAVKRYH dead.
But I do desire to ,! set a seal upon the
dcor of its tomb. Such a seal, in my
judgment, will require the proposed
amendment ct the uocstitution.
I do not advert, Mr. Chairman, to the
long string of hallucinations introduced by
the gentleman from New Tork into his
speech to show a protended parallelism
between the patriotic efforts of " Burke ana
Fox and Chatham and Camden" and oth
ers of the British Parliament, in tho early
days of the American Rovolution, and the
treasonable ravings 01 disappointed poll
ticians in another and different arena. 1
turn all such contestants over to another
and different tribunal, where moie sum
mary justice is to bo administered. I will
stop long enough, however, to say to the
gentleman from Now Tork that since he
made his proud boast, on Wednesday last,
that his " southern brethren could never
bo subjugated," very much evidence has
accumulated on that point. I send to the
Clark ihe remarks of a morning paper on
the present aspect of military affairs, and
beg leave to say that I hear.ily agree with
the patriotio editor in his ascriptions of
praise to ue neaus 01 me war ana iiavy
departments, and to the cmcers na sol
diers ot our armies:
The Cleik read, as follows

morning tne pronaost bulletin of the war.
It makes a noble record for the presiding
genius whose masterly intellect controls
the movements of the Union armies from
his unobtrusive headquarters at City Point.
for the executive talent of the great War
Minister and his subordinates, whose un
wearying activity and promptitude furnish
in abundance the requisite material for so
many distant armies, for the military tal
ent and aptitude for command of the lead
ers who are so nobly guiding our troops to
victory, and for the daring endurance and
patriotic enthusiasm of the rank and file,
whose achievements will stand comparison
with the best soldiers of any age or clime.
Nor should the valuable cooperation of the
Navy be forgotten the energy and skill
which have placed the United States in the
foremost rank of the naval Powers of the
world, the ability and heroic zeal of the
officers, and the indomitable pluck of our
gallant tars.' The news which we publish
tnis morning, conurmavory or me glad ti
dings which have sent a thrill of exultant
triumph throughout the land, is the sure
precursor of the approaching doom of tho
rebellion. r
"Sherman has made his devastating

the very heart of Georgia, breaking up
workshops and factories, destroying stores
and supplies, scattering the panic-stricken

Me. Spalding. Mr. Chairman, I do not
adopt the term "subjugate" as used by the
gentleman from New York but in the last
necessity. I heartily concur with our ex
cellent Chiof Magistrate in the sentiment
embodied in the last paragraph of his
message, and commend it especially to the

may sympath:z3 with him in his efforts to
inspire the supporters of a bad cause with
