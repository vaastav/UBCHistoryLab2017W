FINANCIAL AFFAIRS.
The report of the Secretkry of tbe
Treasury gives a foil and Interesting exhibit
of the financial condition of the country. It

Leaving a surplua revenue of $132,874,
444.41, which, with an amount drawn from
the cash balance in the Treasury of $1,290,
312.55, making $184,178,756.96, was applied
to the redemption of various bonds and
loans.
Tbe revenue for the present fiscal year,
actual and estimated, is as follows: For the
quarter ending September SO, 1883, actual
$95,966,917.08; for the remaining three auar
ters of the year, estimated, $247,038,083.97.
Tbe actual and estimated expenses for the
same period are: For the quarter ending
September 30, 1883, actual, $67,942,090.38;
ior the remaining three quarters of the year,
estimated, $190,057,909.07. Total recepte,
actual and estimated, $343,000,000. The
expenditures, actual and estimated, $258,
000,000. Total, SlBklQg Fund, $45,816,
741.07. Leaving a balance of $39,183,
258.93.
If the revenue for the fiscal year, which
will end on June 30,1885, be estimated upon
the basis of existing laws, the Secretary is
of tbe opinion that for that year the receipts
will exceed $60,000,000, the ordinary ex
penditures including the amount devoted to
Jinking Fund.
WHAT TO DO ABOUT TUX SURPLUS.
Total.
Hitherto the surplus, as rapidly as It has
accumulated, has been devoted to the reduc
tion of tbe National PA«.
As a result tbe only bonds now outstand
ing, which are redeemable at tbe pleasure of
the Government, are the three per cent#,
amounting to about $305,000,000.
The four and one-half per cents, amount
ing to $250,000,000, and the $737.000,000 four
not payable until 1891 and 1907,
per cents are
lespectlvely.
If the surplus shall hereafter be as large as
the Treasury estimates now Indicate, the
three per eent. bonds many ail be redeemed
at least four years before auy of tbe four-and
one-half per cents can be called in. The lat
ter, at tbe same rate of accumulation of sur
plus, can be paid at maturity, and the
moneys requisite for tne redemption of the
four per ceute will be In tbe Treasury many
years before those obligations become pay
able. There are cogent re&sons, however,
why tbe national Indebtedness should not be
thus rapidly extinguished. Chief among
them is the fact that only by excessive taxa
tion is such rapidity attainable.
In a communication to Congress at its
last session I recommended that all excise
taxes be abolished except those relating to
distilled spirite, and that substantial reduc
tions be also made in the revenues from
customs. A. statute has since been enacted
by which the annual tax and tariff receipts
of the Government have been cut down to
the extent at least of fifty or sixty million
million ot dollars. While I have no doubt
that still further reductions may be wisely
made. I do not advise the adoption at this
session of any measures for large diminution
of the national revenue. The results of the
legislation of the last session of the Congress
have not, as yet, been sufficiently apparent
to justify any radical revision or sweeping
modifications of existing law. In the inter,
val which must elapse before the effects of
the acts of March 3,1883, can be definately
ascertained, a

portion at least of the surplus

D
NATIONAL BANK CURRENCY.
Immediately associated with the financial
subject just discussed Is the Important ques
tion. What legislation is needed regarding
the National currency?
The aggregate amount of bonds now on
deposit in the Treasury to support the
National Bank circulation is about $350,
000,000. Nearly $200,000,000 of this amount
consists of three per cents, which, as al
ready stated, are payable at tbe pleasure of
the Government, and are likely to be called
in within less than four years, unless mean
time the surplus revenues shall be dimin
ished.
The probable effect of such an extensive
retirement of tho securities, which are the
basis of the National Bank circulation,
would be Buch a contraction of the volume
of the currency as to produce grave com
mercial embarrassments.
How can this danger be obviated? The
most effectual plan, and one whose adop
tion at the earliest practicable opportunity
shall heartily approve, has already been in
dicated.
If tbe revenues of the next lour years shall
be kept substantially commensurate with
the expenses, the volume of circulation will
not bo likely to suffer any material disturb
But if, on the other hand, there shall
anee.
be great delay In reducing tax, It will be
come necessary either to substitute some
other form of currency in place of the Na
tional Bank notes, or to make important
changes in the laws by which their circula
tion is now controlled.
Iu my judgement the latter course is far
preferable. I commond to your attention
the very interesting and thoughtful sug
gestions upon this subject which appear In
the Secretary's report.
The objections which he urges against the
acceptance of any other securities than the
obligations of tbe Government itself as a
foundatiou for National Bank circulation
seem to be Insuperable.
For averting tne threatened contraction
two count's bare been suggested, either of
X s &S§
run, bearing a low rat© of Interest, and ex
changeable upon specified term* ior those
now outstanding. The other courte, which
commends Itself to my own judgment as the
better, la tbe enactment ol a law repealing
the tax on circulation, and permitting the
banks ti issue notes for an amount equal to
00 per cent, of the market value, Instead of
ii "" the face value of their deposited
bonde. I agree with the Secretary lu the
belief that tne adoption of this plan would
afford the necessary relief.
CALLING IV TVS TRAD* DOLLAR.
The trade dollar was coined for the pur
pose of traffic in countries where sliver
passed at Its value as ascertained by its
weight and fineness. It never had a legal
tender quality. Large numbers of these
coins entered, however, into the volume of
our currency. By common consent their
circulation in domestic trade has now ceased
and they have thus became a disturbing ele
ment. They should not be longer permitted
to embarrass our currency system. 1 re
commend that provision be made for their
reception by tbe Treasury and tbe mints, as
bullion, at a small percentage above the cur
rent market price of silver of like fineness.
• • « • « e
wo AOÛT tva*# wn ft jjidians.
From the report of the Secretary of War
It will be seen that In only a single Instance
has tbgre been any disturbance of the quiet
condition of our Indian tribes. A raid from
Mcxicblnto Arizona waa made in March
last by a email party of Indians, which was
pursued by General Crook Into the tnoun
ralnous regions from which It bad come. It
is confidently hoped that serious outbreaks
will not airain occur, and that the Indinu
tribes which have lor so many years dis
turbed the West will hereafter remain in
peaceable submission.
The President further recommends the
^Improvement of our tea-coast defenses, the
'on courage ment of the militia and the in
of our naval strength.
CIT
In regard to poet a' affaire the President
avows ills belief that the Government
should be authorized by law to exercise
some sort of supervision over inter-8tate
telegraphic
the hope that, for attaining that end, some
measure may be devised which will receive
thé approbation of Congress.
The President approves the recommenda
tions of the Attorney-General for an increase
of witness fees and lor the payment of dis
trict attorneys and marshals by salaries in
stead of fees. The President also calls at*
tentiou to the need of more legislation to
prevent frauds under the pension laws, and
for Federal aid to primary education to re
duce illiteracy.
The Piesideut further recommends legis
lation for the suppression of polygamy, a
form of government for Alaska, laws lor
the regulation of inter-ôtate commerce, and
a better system of declaring the election of
President and Vice President. Also, con

TWO NEW MYSTIC KIES.
Connecticut Kxc'ted Over More Unsolved
Murders—Coal-Pit and Lime-Kiln.
New Haven. Dec. 4.—The discovery of
the body of Elaridge F. Johnson, a farmer
Madison, in a coal-pi r . has created great
excitement. It Is believed that he was mur
dered. Investigation showed that his skull
waa crushed in, his body terribly bruised
and the lower limbs terribly burned. One
lee had been jammed into a hole in the top
or the heap and apparently burnt off from
above tbe ankle. The indications ol
foul play were convincing. An inspection of
the ground revealed signs of a severe strug
gle about the heap. The ground was torn
as by the heels and tees of heavy boots.
Blood was found on the rocks beside the pit.
His axe and lantern were missing, as were
$11 that he was known to have nad in his
pocket when he left the house on Sunday
night. He had sold a pair of cattle on Sat
urday, and had kept that much of the pro
ceeds ol the sale about his person.
To-day Coroner Bollman and Deputy
Sherff Hull, of Madison, pulled the charcoal
heap to pieces and found the missing foot
of the murdered man, bloody and very little
charred, sunk under the sods ot the heap.
To all appearances It had been chopped off
and stuffed into the charcoal In the hope,
probably, that it would be consumed betöre
morning. Scattered bunches of hair were
found on the rocks. No jury was impan
neled and no witnesses summoned.
A young man who formerly worked for
Johnsons is under suspicion,
excitement of (the Mary Stannard murder
has been again summoned into existence
by this mystery, and it Is probable that
Justice Wilcox, famous from his connection
with the Stannard murder,will again be the
presiding genius at the preliminary hearing.
A sensation has been created in New
Haven by the announcement that a decom
posed human arm, apparently that of a
man, bad been found iu a rusty tin chest
near the lime-kiln in Fair Haven «by a
laborer who carelessly opened the box.
Medical Examiner White is engaged in an
investigation, which, he says, proves fair to
be as much ol a mystery as the Jennie
Cramer case. There is a rumor that tbe
arm Is the remnaut of a well-to-do young
farmer who went away Irom Mount
Carmel last summer and
since been seen,
murdered
body dismembered in the hopes of effect

arm now discovered was inclosed in the
tiu chest aud sunk in the Quinniplac River,
and that its decomposing gases caused the
chest which is a tight one, to float. The
missiog man's name was Maynard and he
was last seen on his way home from New
Haven. Notwithstanding the retioence of
the officials and although the arm cauDot be

source that the stump has the appearance

had pressed his face Against the railing of
the old court house at KenL. His voice
filled every portion of the court room, aud,
quoting an old authoiity, declared that be
would "rather be right, than consistent."
At last, turning upon Mr. Fulton, he ex
claimed, almost In the voice of thunder:
"We know ourselves to be honorable
We never saw ihe paper and you never
offered it. Counsel or no one else can tie
my client's hands so long as I my tongue

Mr. Gray followed with a more moderate
speech, and finally, after vigorous speeches
by Judges Wootten and Houston, the latter
pounding the desk forcibly with his fl6t to
ain the na
and. Dur
I emphasize his remarks, all the parties, both
I bench and lawyers, cooled down,
For perhaps an hour there wis a eorfu
slon of J-remarks, comments, denials, insin
uations, etc., which much amused the law
yers and other spectators, most of whom
were unable to understand what It was all
about.
After the confusion had subsided, Mr.
Fulton offered to put in evidence a bill of
sale of 1870, nine years before tbe seizure
and sale of the disputed heifer. As he did
so Mr. Harrington exclaimed: "Why, that
was before the bull was born."
Mr. Harrington then called the following
named gentlemen, prominent citizens of
Hmyrna, all of whom swore that the repu- j
tation of John R. Wilson lor truth and vera- I
city in the community in which he lived was |
bad and that they wouldn't believe him on
oath, especially in a matter In which he was
directly interested: William Hutchinson, Dr.
W. T. Collins, John Van Gaskin, Nathaniel
Wilds, Benjamin V. Weldtn, John H. Hof-
fecker, James B.Hoffecker,James McDowell,
Henry G. Budd and Joseph Ruth.
When Mr. Fulton was cross examining Dr.
Collins he asked the witness if he had ever
had any trouble with John R. Wilson. Dr.
Collins said that he had, but it would not in
any way influence his testimony, and,
reaching over the witness box he shook his
finger at Mr. Fulton, exclaiming: "I repel
the insinuation you put upon me," and left
the stand.
On being examined, Mr. Ruth stated that
he left Smyrn a "some five years" ago, but
at that time Mr. Wilson's reputation was
bad. Counsel for the plaintiff objected, on
the ground that it was too long ago, but the
testimony was admitted. Mr. Harrington
stated that the plaintiff mightcall witnesses
to show that Wilson had repented. It was
also considered, he said, that a man who
was a professional liar five years ago con
tinned so unless there were some signs of
bis repentance.
Counsel for the plaintiff then called tbe
following named witnesses, who declared,
with perhaps two or three exceptions, that
Wilson's reputation in the neighborhood
varied, "Some saying that it was good and
some bad " They all, however, asserted that
they would believe him on oath: Captain
MuBtard, Presley Spruance, Horace Mus

William H. Thompson,James W. Spruance,
and John B. Lewis.
