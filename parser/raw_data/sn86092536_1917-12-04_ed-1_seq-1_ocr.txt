Extremely hard fighting, with j
the Germans using large forces of j
Infantry rn mass formation, is |
taking place along the southwest- j
ern section of the Cambrai sali
ent.
In the region of Gonneiieu, La !
Vacquerie and southward to Vend- 1
huile. and northward toward Mas- '
meres, battles were waged with
great fierceness throughout Mori- j
day. with the Germans nowhere
successful in breaking the British !
front. At La Vacquerie they
?gain succeeded in penetrating
the village from which they were
1 ejected Dreviously. but a strong
cojrtcr-attack again turned the
scale in favor of General Byng"3
force? . who threw out the enemy,
inflicting heavy casualties on him. i
As 'n their previous attacks. ?
the Germans used great masses of i
artillery, hut the British forces j
everywhere met their onslaughts
stoically and at last accounts were
firmly holding their line at all J
points.
Although the Germans in their j
offensive have been using men !

B j THANK H. SIMONDS I
Military Critic of tbe New York Tribune j
ml Wheeling- Intelligencer
NEW YORK, Dec. 3.? Wc are
seeing the most considerable
German blew delivered against
the British since the battle of
? the Marne, measured alike by j
ground gained and by prisoners 5
and guns taken. In accepting
these measurements, however,
It is well to remember that the
Germans arp ; merely regaining I
ground which rthey have recently^ |
lost, retaking -some of th? guns j
which they have lately lost and
that, so far ajt least, they have |
only made a partial recovery, j
Their claim of six thousand pri?- !
oners stands against the British
claim of more than ten thousand
prisoners, taken last w?ek. The
total of guns is still Inferior to j
1
I the number taken by the British, |
and they have so far regained less j
than a tenth of the ground they j
lost In Byng's Initial attack.
1 In sum, by the most determined j
and successful counter-offensives,
which they have delivered against
the British since the battle of the
Marne, th; Germans have taken
six thousand- prisoners, captured '
one hundred guns, reduced the |
British gain of ground of last !
week by approximately a quarter !
and very materially diminished j
the profits of the British victory. !
The whole thing represents a skil
fuf and successful local counter- i
offensive. It Is a very brilliant j
military op?ratlon. It demon- ;
strates the fact that the German j
armies on the western front are j
still capable of very dangerous
attacks, and It very probably in.
sures a continued German stay In
Cambrai. Probably the Germans {
will now be able to hold Cambrai
until next spring at the earliest, j
when the prospect of a general rc- j
tirement teems good.
The most considerable profit for
the Germans, however, is not in
the ground regained and the pris
oners and guns taken. Byng's
original succes^ was the most
damaging blow To the prestige
and morale of the western Ger
man army since Petain's success- .
ful attack at Verdun just one year
ago. It was impossible for the
Germans to permit this victory
to stand, because its effect upon
their own armies and their own
public would have been disas
trous. They have now very ma
terially changed the character of
the whole operation by their own
counter-success.

WASHINGTON, D. C.. Dec. 3.
? Becausc there is not enough
warm -clothing to permit the next
Increment of five hundred thou-i
sand men to be called under the
selective draft being taken into
the government service while the
weather continues cold, the date
of their going into camp has been
postponed until the latter part of
March, It was learned at the war
department today. ?
The delay in calling the men to
the colors, while it will of course
delay by just that much time
when they will be ready for aer
vice in France, will give the quar
termasters' department almost a
year in which to provide the ne
cessary winter clothing. I hey
will not need the warm clothing
until their period of training in
the United States is completed,
and they are ready to be trans
ported to France.
The war department has been
having hard sledding to provide
winter clothing for the men al
ready In the scrvice. It has
been officially admitted that the
call for the last quota of the first
increment of the drafted men was
delayed because of the lack of
overcoats. Now the training of
the second increment will be de
layed, so that they will not be
mustered into the federal service
until the warm weather makes a
supply of heavy clothing unneces
sary for the time being, and the
department will have until next
October in which to provide the
heavy clothing which the men will
need in France next winter if the
war continues.
There has never been an official
announcement ps to just when the
second increment would be called
out, but the date fixed by army
officers, whore only desire Is to
get an army trained as rapidly as
possible, and who were not taking
into consideration the inability of
the quartermasters' bureau to fur
nish supplies, was some time this
month. It had been planned to
train the second increment, large
ly in the camps made vacant by
the movement of National Guards
men to France. Now it is thought
that the cantonments will be
available for the second - incre
ment, as the first incremsnt will
or can be cent to France before
present plane contemplate e
calling of the second.

( 'abarnis county mint, wa? to offer
export testimony designed to combat
lhat introduced by the proserin ion
thai it would have boon physically im
possible for Mrs. Maude A! King to
haw ft red l he shot that caused her
death a I Wrick-welder Spring the night
of last August 20.
Half a dozen North Carolina physi
cians testified that in their opinion it
would have been possible for Mrs.
King to have fired the shoi. They
told of lengthy experiments they had
conducted in firing at blotters with 22
calibtv automatic revolvers, such as
that with which Mrs. Kine was killed.]
Powder stains generally were left on
the blotters when the revolver was
held at any distance less than 11
inches away, they said, but no stains
were visible when hair was placed on
the blotter. i
On cross-examination, the physi*j
clans admitted that Afton Means, a
brother of the defendant, assisted In
all tests they made and that on on?|
or two occasions Lee Crowell, of coun
sel for Means, also was present. The]
State demanded that the blotters be
produced, but this was not done.
fir. W. 11. Wadsworth, one of the
witnesses, undertook to demonstrate
to the jury how he believed the shot
that caused Mrs. King's death could
have been 11 red by her. but lie could,
p. i the revolver into position only,
through the aid of counsel for the de
fense. The State's objection to tliisj
assistance was sustained by Presiding ;
Judge nine. When challenged by:
Solicitor Clement to make the demon
stration unassisted. Dr. Wadsworth]
admitted that he could not know when |
he had the weapon in th erlght posl-j

The President's Address.
Speculation as to the nature of the!
1 'resident's address centers largely upon
i the <juest !'>n whether he will recommend
[declarations of war by the United
.States against Germany's allies. Gen-,
era! belief is that he will not, at least.,
for the present, and' that congress will
follow his fit-sires. Sentlijiept for such
action Is widespread, however, aud in-t
dividual members probably will Intro-1
duce war resolutions. One or two se?a-:
tors were prepared to-day to offer such
resolutions, but were prevailed upon to
withhold them.
General Legislation.
A spirit of confidence apparently per- ]
vades e.ingress. Ke turn In it members ex-!
j changed views with declarations of in- !
! creased determination to lent! every aid
t In vigorous condu?n of the war. . The
J h-aders predicted llAt legislation would

I tiie President I" understood to desire..
I Senator Martin, Democratic leader in thej
I senate, said there would bo little timci
for other than war problem*. And Repre
sentative Kltchln, the house floor leader,
announced after Informal conference*
?with colleagues, that he wm disposed to
favor the plan. The understanding, how

Tho house Judiciary committee meets '
to-morrow and as consideration of na

slon on the basis of action at this ses

sessions by the presence of many uni
formed men among: spectators in the ^
crowded galler'os, and of women busily
plying knitting needles during the open

Senate proceedings were, unusually
brief. After an adoption of routine re*?
olutions. the senate adjourned out of re- (
spect to the late Senator Husting, of
Wisconsin. Th? house remained in ses
sion until the Joint committee appoint-,
ed to notify President Wilson of tho re1
turn of congress reported, and then
passed the resolution for to-morrow's
joint session. Tho usual crop of bill*,
resolutions and petitions was received In
the house, including a resolution by Rep
resentative Martin, of Louisiana, propos
