made of the native wood from the Isthmus. These

Some senators complain that President Roose
velt upset traditions when he sent in nomina
tions before waiting to be formally told that the
senate was in session. '
On the first day of the session Senator Pen
rose of Pennsylvania offered a resolution calling
upon the president for information relating to
the discharge of the negro troops. Senator Foraker
immediately offered a substitute calling upon the
secretary of war to furnish, all correspondence and
data bearing upon the dismissal of the negro
troops with the record of each man and all de
tailed information with respect to the record
of the Twenty-fifth infantry, which is made up
of negro troops. It is the understanding tliat
Penrose introduced his resolution at the sugges
tion of the administration.. Foraker's resolution
was understood to be hostile, and this idea is
upheld by the fact that in various sections
of the country negroes - are organizing Foraker
clubs, such organizations to be used for the pur
pose of pushing Mr. Foraker's boom for the re
publican nomination in 1908.
Referring to his resolution Senator Foraker
said: I have no purpose of raising the race
question. The question involved is broader. It
would be unfortunate to have it narrowed by
drawing a color line. It concerns white as well
as colored soldiers. It is a question of constitu
tional power on the one hand and constitutional
and statutory rights on the other. Until we have
.a complete record I do not know just what ques
tions will arise, but we may have to consider
whether or not a man can be convicted of felony
by order, and whether, following such a conviction
sentence may be imposed and punishment inflict
ed by order. Discharges without honor may be
made where they are not based on an offense

The Washington correspondent for the New
York World is authority for the statement that
President Roosevelt has determined that before
he retires' from office the $148,000 contributed to
his campaign by the- three insurance companies
shall be refunded. The World's correspondent
says that when the president suggested this plan
to Messrs. Cortelyou and Bliss they bluntly re
fused to have anything to do with the proposi
tion. They insisted that the money should not
bo returned. The president made Inquiry, and dis
covered that the republican national committee
has a balance on hand of $400,000, and he is
anxious tha out of this sum the committee's offi
cers shall repay the .$148,000 to the policyholders.

Japan, to explain whether or not he Is correctly
quoted in an interview published in which he
predicts war between the United States and Japan
on account of Japanese children being excluded
from the white schools of San Francisco. Presi
dent Roosevelt is indignant over the publication
of this story, especially when credited to an offi
cial from the consular service whose, duty is to
promote good feeling between this country and
Japan instead of causing friction."

On the fourth day of the session the senate
adopted the Penrose resolution asking the presi
dent for information regarding the discharge of
the negro troops. It also adopted the Foraker
resolution, directing the secretary of war to give
similar information. Senator Culberson of Texas
amended each resolution by asking specifically
for the order of a major commanding the troops,
which order directed that certain of the troops
demanded by the Texas authorities be not sur
rendered. .The Culberson amendment was adopt
ed. A heated discussion, took place in the senate
while these resolutions were pending. Senator
Foraker denied that the negro troops were guilty
of murder and produced copies of the testimony
which he said was "unsatisfactory, incomplete
and of a flimsy character." Senator Foraker said
that the race question was not involved; that
the right of the president to dismiss a man from
the army was involved and if he could dismiss one
man he could dismiss a company, a regiment, or
In fact the whole army.
An Associated Press dispatch under date of
Washington, December 6, follows: "The govern
ment today resumed the purchase of silver, ac
cepting bids for two thousand ounces at 68.669
cents per fine ounce. This is more than 3 cents
an ounce lower than the offerings which were
made at the time purchases were suspended near
ly four weeks ago. This fact .and the large and
increasing public demand for subsidiary coins
which could not be met without additional pur
chases are the controlling reasons given by the
treasury officials for the resumption It is stated
by the treasury officials that purchases will con
tinue for an indefinite time, tho amount to de
pend largely upon the prices asked."

Nepo leaders in Washington are very much
Interested in the Japanese question. They say
that if it should be demonstrated that citizens of
other nations must be treated alike in this coun
try the same rule ought to apply to American cit
izens in their own laud. In that event the negro
would want to know with what reason the school
authorities in the District of Columbia prohibit
negroes from attending school with white chil
dren. They say that if Mr. Roosevelt wins his
Japanese case in San Francisco a negro case will
be instituted in the District of Columbia.
Senator Cullom has introduced "by request" a
bill declaring against simplified spelling.

wedge.

Bellamy Storer, formerly ambassador to
Austria, sent to President Roosevelt, to mem
bers of the cabinet and to members of the senate
committee on foreign relations a pamphlet con
taining copies of letters which passed between
Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. and Mrs. Storer. Mr.
Storer claimed that Mr. Roosevelt was striving to
have Archbishop Ireland promoted to cardinal,
and that Mr. and Mrs. Storer were the president's
instruments to that end. Storer claimed that
when the scheme became known in diplomatic
circles Mr. Roosevelt wrote to Storer and his wife
letters indicating that he was very much opposed
to any interference with church affairs and in
those letters the president severely criticised Mr.
and Mrs. Storer. Tho Chicago Tribune gave
Storer's pamphlet to the public and it created a
sensation. On the following day the president
wrote a letter to Secretary Root, which letter
was made public. In this letter Mr. Roosevelt
denies the material allegations made by Storer,
and says that while he has a deep affection for
Archbishop Ireland he took no part in the effort
tq make him a cardinal, but on the contrary was
In earnest when he rebuked Mr. and Mrs. Storer
for their efforts in that line.
