from the Xotv York Sun.
The negative qualities of President i
Taft's tirst annual message to Congress
command our instant attention and ad
miration. It is a notable document. Not ,
a single paragraph or line is propagandle
in the recently familiar sense. No part
of it Is a sermon or exhortation or
parable or moral essay or disquisition
upon remote and extraneous subjects of
human interest. There is in no passage
any incitement to passionate thinking on
the part ?ff any class of citizens. For
the first time In about eight years there is
published to the country an annual mes
sage which is accompanied by not the
faintest suspicion of a yellow supple
ment.
Temperate.
Kr?m Ui?? New WnrH.
Throughout the message Mr. Taft is
moderate in his views and temperate in
speech. He has no startling novelties to
offer, no catchwonls to tickle the ear
and no appeals to class prejudices. When
lie advances a reform he does it patiently
and ddilierately and after full considera
tion of its bejirins on present conditions.
With Mr. Taft the administration of the
government is apparently a plain matter
of business in the public interest, not
a game to be played for personal amuse
ment or political effect.
Old-Fashioned.
Vroui tlie New York Tribune.
President Taft's message both in com- !
pass and in character resembles the old- j
fashioned presidential messages more
than those to which the nation has been
accustomed in recent years. The return
to the old type is accomplished by re
>ervintr for discussion in special messages
his views concerning the most important
economic and political topics. Conservu- .
Hon and the amendment of the anti-trust j
and interstate commerce acts are to be |
made the subject of future messages, i
They will thus attract greater attention '
and receive tnoro thorough discussion, j
and they do not immediately thrust aside I
A variety of routine matters which it is
necessary to present to Congress and the
country.
Times Have Changed.
Fr?ni the New York Times.
The time that has elapsed since tiie i
last annual message of President Taft's 1
predecessor was sent to Congress is but j
the span of a single year. yet. if we may
judge by comparison with the message
sent in yesterday, how great a change
has come over the spirit and affairs of
this people! We no longer see the wrinkled
front and the clinched teeth: the male
factors of great wealth have fled to their
hiding places, or, it may be, are reserved
for later consideration: in all the land
there is no hint of any conspiracy against
the administration; the hostile press has
been won over or forgiven, and over the
printed panes a benignant countenance
seems to look forth upon a world of
peace, the countenance of a man and a
President considering in calmness and
with a philosophical mind what recom
mendations for the public welfare he
shall make to the Congress. Mr. Taft
appears to have written under the con
viction that this nation is, after all, in
the main living a wholesome life; he has
written, too. ami for that all men will be
grateful, with a due sense of the short
ness of life, insomuch that we are not
asked to read a message of twenty-two
printed columns.
A Cheerful Message
I nun th<- .New York HernM.
The sober and dignitied tone of the
President's message and its optimistic
prediction that the country is on the eve
of :t substantial business expansion makes
a favorable impression in business and
financial circles. That his promise to
deal with needed amendments to the anti
trust and interstate commerce acts in
later official messages created no uneasi
ness is evidenced by the improvement in
t ie value of securities that occurred
when a summary of the message reached
the exchanges. President Taft's judicial
temperament and the absence of all sen
sationalism from the message transrmt
t"<l to Congress yesterday evidently in
spired business men and investors with
confidence that he will not indulge in the
"trust-busting" talk and attacks on
"swe lien fortunes'" for which his prede
cessor was distinguished.
Wise and Welcome.
1'riitii tlie Philadelphia Letter.
President Taft's first annual message is
a wise and welcome return to the con
siderate and unexciting form which was
customary with most of his predecessors.
The President always has the opportunity
to make particular communications to
Congress upon particular subjects; this
formal report upon "the state of the
Cnion" wh ch is presented at the open
in:.' of each regular session covers too
wide a range to be devoted profitably to
rhetorical appeals, except upon some un
usua' occasion when one subject appears
of dominating importance. Mr. Taft s re
turn to the more conventional type is a
recognition of the restoration of normal
conditions and of the readiness of Con
gress and the country to proceed with
t he public business with orderly dis
? retfon.
Mute on Great Questions.
1 ivni i Philadelphia Inquirer.
President Taft ? message is chiefly re
markable for what it does not say.
Whether for l*i k of time, whether be
ause so many routine matters carried
t e document into an undesirable length,
h?- President hay left for future dis
? Mission burning issues concerning *hich
i :<? country wishes enlightenment. The
??cent decision regarding the Standard Oil
?'ompanv is the most im|Hjrtant opinion
1 ''at the Supreme Court lias handed down
in many a day. What is the exact at
titude of the administration toward it?
Then there is the interstate commerce
. ommission. It is known that the Presi
dent wishes to strengthen the hold of the
federal government upon the railroads.
I?ut in what manner.' These ;ire the
uuestions which are not answered. We
are told as to the Sherman anti-trust
law ami the interstate commerce law
that "developments in their operation call
for a discussion and sonu suggestions as
to amendments." So in the course of
tune the Prestdrnt is to advise amend
ments to both of them. For the details
we shall have to wait.
Not Strongly Partisan.
I the Philadelphia I'rmi.
I hougii th?- presidential message sent
to Congress yesterday is the mes
sage of a republican President to
a republican Coifgress, there is scarcely |
a suggestion or recommendation in it '
that does not appeal to democrats quite
a s strongly as to republicans. The one
issue that might be considered partisan,
the tariff, was disposed of in the extra
session. Partisan lines will be main
tained in Congress, but they will not
find in this message any vital partisan
issue to divide upon, unless it is the
ship subsidy issue, which always secures
republican indorsement in national con
ventions, but has never vet been able to
hold the republicans together in its favor
iu a national Congress. Let us hope
that it will fare better than heretofore
in the present Congress, backed as it
is by President Taft's earnest indorse
ment.
