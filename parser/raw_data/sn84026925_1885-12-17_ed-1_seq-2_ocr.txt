YORKYILLE, S. C. ^ / |
THURSDAY MORNING, DEC. 17, 1885. !
CONGRESS. i
Congress has done nothing as yet of ira- \
portanee, nor is it probable that any meas- 1
ure of national legislation will seriously engage
the attention of that body until after J
the holiday recess. On Saturday the Presi?: .
dent sent to the Senate for confirmation a
number of nominations made by him since
his inauguration. The communication was J
received, but no action taken upon it.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
On the first page of this issue will be
found a synopsis of Mr. Cleveland's first
message. Measuring the administration by ;
the length of this document, Mr. Cleveland (
x will prove to be the most able executive that .
has ever filled the Presidential chair. The 1
message has received very favorable criti- <
cism from the press of all parties, and lengthy
as it is, the critics say it does not contain a
surplus word. Our condensation covers all |
the points treated by the President and <
gives a clear iaea or tne tenor 01 me wnoie ;
paper. 1
THE ATLANTA INJUNCTION.
Argument was begun last Saturday in the
United States Court at Atlanta, Hon. H. K.
McCay presiding, in the contest over the '
late prohibition election in Fulton county. '
The case was in the shape of a bill for injunction
to restrain the Ordinary of the
county of Fulton from declaring the result ,
of the election, a temporary restraining order
having been granted two weeks ago.
There is quite an array of lawyers on each
side, and the case will occupy several days
in its hearing. On Saturday only one
speech was made, and that was made by i
Albert H. Cox, Esq., representing the liquor
dealers. He argued the uuconstitu- 1
tionality uf the bill, in that it allows the
sale of Georgia made wines and prohibit- (
ing the sale of wines made in other States;
that it was unconstitutional under the Geor- i
gia Constitution, in that it allows the elec- i
tion in "wet" counties and does not allow I
elections in "dry" counties, thus not operating
alike throughout the State, and that :
proceedings under this bill were illegal.
A number of authorities were read to i
sustain those points, and affidavits were introduced
in support of the facts alleged, of
the illegality of methods of the election, j
Argument was continued on Monday. i
t
* THE LIEN LAW.
At the present writing, the indications <
are that the Legislature, yielding to the <
clamor of certain persons throughout the J
State, for the past four years, will repeal the ^
lien law, the ostensible object being to im- g
prove the condition of the laboring class, i
hut. thp rp?I nurnnsp boin? to create a SVS- t
tem of serfdom for a large number of the j
poorer class and deprive the laboring man
with limited means of all opportunity to ^
till the soil except under a boss. While 1
this is a thrust at the poor man, intended to r
make him poorer, the evil will not stop ;
* there. One serious effect will be to de- 'J1
preciate the value of lands, a result inci- a
dent to the disorganization of labor that \,
will surely follow the repeal of the law, f
while our State will lose a large percentage ^
of its best labor, driven away by the oppres?ive
system that will inevitably follow a re- j
peal of the law. ( v
In the present financial depression it t
were safer and wiser to leave the lien law s
undisturbed. The statute only permits the e
system, protecting the landlord, it is true, t
but at the same time affording {he poor r
man a means of obtaining credit; yet there y
is nothing in the law making it compulsory g
upon either party to enter into the contract, c
The number of liens recorded each year in
every county of the State is the strongest t
argument in favor of the necessity of the jj
law. Deprive this large class of persons of c
the opportunity of giving such security as t
they can, and they will be driven to the c
b
THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY. ?
The board of directors of the Columbia n
Theological Seminary held a protracted j
session in Columbia last Thursday, all the 3
members being present. The meeting last- {
ed till long after midnight. The principal n
subject considered was the relation of Drs. u
Woodrow and Girardeau to the institution, p
and it will be seen that while Dr. Girar- y
deau's connection with the Seminary as a a
Professor has been finally severed, the re- a
markable action of the board leaves that of ^
Dr. Woodrow in a more embarrassing situa- v
tion than ever. p
On Thursday morning, soon after assem- {,
bling, the board reached the conclusion a
that the action of the board of a year ago j
declaring the Perkins Professprship va- ?
* ?. 1 w i.,, IJ
vmii) uui iittviu^ uccu appiuvcu uj q
Synods constituting a majority of the con- j,
trolling Synods, the chair was not vacated. (j
A committee consisting of Rev. T. H. tj
Law and Rev. W. J. McKay, was instruct- 0
ed to communicate this action of the board r
to Dr. Woodrow, and at the same time to
call his attention to the action of the Syn- ^
ods expressing their desire that the doc- ^
trine of evolution should not hereafter be 0
taught from that chair, and asking Dr. g
Woodrow if he would accede to the wishes
of the Synod as thus expressed. 1
The committee waited on Dr. Woodrow v
in person with the foregoing communica- j a
tion, to which he replied that he fully roe-j b
ognized the right of the Synods to pre- j 0
scribe what subjects should be taught in the | (]
Seminary, and expressed unhesitatingly his i j
readiness to comply with their require- a
ments in this respect. h
The report of tne committee to the board (]
of the result of their interview with Dr. r
Woodrow seems not to have been conclus- j ii
ive of the controversy as was expected, for 1 v
at midnight another committee, consisting a
of Dr. W. H. Dodge and Mr. W. S. McKay, t
called on Dr. Woodrow with a paper from t
the board in which he was asked, with a \
view to put a stop to further agitation in s
the church, to resign. a
To this request Dr. Woodrow replied that t
he was not prepared to answer at present,! t
and the committee returned to the board \
with this reply. 11
On this a number of resolutions were j i
offered in the board, intended to effect his {
removal, all of which were voted down by f
the original vote of 7 to 0. <To
a reporter of the Register Dr. Woodrow t
confirmed the foregoing statement of facts
without being able to account for the final ^
action of the board in asking his resigna- j $
tion. He was frank in the statement of his t
intention to accept the responsibility which i j
the action of the Synods and the board had j
innnn Kim nnrl wnnlfl chnpflv ro
lUJJpVO^U uuvii 1I1UJ J UUV4 Ifvwm ?v
sume the duties of his professorship, which
had been so long interrupted by the delay 1
of the board in reaching the conclusion t
communicated to him on Thursday morn- t
ing. He said he would regard the second t
communication, asking his resignation, in (
which he understood two of his supporters j
in the board joined solely on the ground of s
allaying agitation in the church, as address- $
ed to his individual judgment and conscious- t
ness of right, that he would give to it the 1
same weight which he would give to sinii- ?
lar advisory counsel from any friend of si
equal judgment, but that he could not a
recognize it as of any official authority rJ
whatsoever. j t
TJiis now episode of the unfortunate histo- si
y will be regarded by all true friends of the <
?hurch as introducing a serious complicaion
into the issue, which will make it
nore difficult to reach a peaceful and liarnonious
settlement. i
The board communicated with Dr. Girar- j t
leau through a committee with a view of c
)btaining a withdrawal of his resignation, t
Dr. Giradeau, however, declined to with- c
lraw his letter, and at their final meeting ?
yesterday morning his resignation was ac- 1
jepted. j
Resolutions were offered to go into an
election to fill the existing vacancies, but 1
they were not adopted.?Columbia Register.
The Dead Millionaire.?Vanderbilt's
body was deposited in the old Vanderbilt
cault, close by the old Moravian church, in
New Dorp, until the new mausoleum can be
fully prepared. A tall white shaft, bearing
the word "Vanderbilt," marks the location
of the vault, in which lie the bodies of Commodore
Vanderbilt, his two wives and his
sister Phoebe. The vault has several vacant
arches. The coffin containing \V. H.
Vanderbilt's body is very plain, of cedar,
with eliptic ends, draped in black English
broadcloth, and lined with white satin, upholstered.
It is six feet eight inches long
and nineteen inches across the shoulders at.
the bottom. The top is in three panels, the
upper one of glass. The inclosing box is oil
oak lined with copper.
His will was made public on Saturday.
It bequeaths to his wife his dwelling house,
lots, stables, etc., and $200,000 a year, anlt"
ten million dollars to each of his eight children.
Nearly one million dollars in stocks
and bonds is given to charitable institutions.
The remainder of his fortune is divided
equally between Cornelius and William K.
Vanderbilt. He directs that all ol the rail--road
stock bequeathed to his children shall
be held in bulk and administered for the
best interests of all, and none of them
shall be disposed of without the consent of
all concerned. He also provides annuities
of from two to three thousand dollars to a
number of distant relatives. Mr. Chauncey.^
M. Depew and Mr. Henry M. Anderson are
constituted administrators for his wife.

A Kentucky Affray.?A fatal affray t
occurred in the United States marshal's of- ^
ice at Covington, Ky., on Thursday. A ,
lumber of prisoners were taken from jail
;o that office, which adjoins the Court-room.. B
\11 were ushered Into the Court-room ex- ^
;ept Edward O'Neal, who was left in ihe ^
iffice with Bailiff Day. The prisoner was
ieated near the table in the centre of the r
oom. In the drawer next to him was a a
W-calibre pistol. As Day turned, after
ihowing the other prisoners out, he was
net by O'Neal, who had in the meantime
aken the pistol from the drawer. Day's
irst intimation of danger was feeling a
landful of pepper thrown into his eyes. ^
\s they closed with pain he caught a <]
glimpse of a pistol-barrel levelled at his a
lead. Instinctively he caught it with his c
ight hand and clutched O'Neal's throat v
vith his left. He bore down on the pistol a
is it was discharged. The bullet just grazed ^
lis hip. Still holding his grasp, though in s
in agony of pain, he bore O'Neal back- e
vnrd, simultaneously wrenching the pistol t
rom his hand, and pointing it toward his fj
mtagonist, whom he could no longer see, he j
ired, shooting O'Neal through his body. n
The bullet entered the lower part of both c
ungs, bringing him to the floor. The q
vhole thing was done in less time than it (
akes to tell it. Instantly all was confu- e
ion in the Court-room. Doctors were call- r
d, who dressed O'Neal's wounds, which ?
hey pronounced necessarily fatal. The
rounded man is 2S years of age; was origi- /(,
lally from Detroit; was said latterly to j
tave been a member of a counterfeiting 0
:ang, and was under indictment for passing j
ounterfeit money. ' v
_
The House Chaplain.?Mr. Milburn, j
he "blind man eloquent," was elected chap- ti
ain of the House, and his selection in cau- Q
us came about in this way : "The nomina- 0
ion of chaplain was the last business of the *(
aucus, and in the meantime Mr. Robert- (]
on, of Kentucky, who supported Mr. Mil- ^
urn, was making an active canvass among p
uembers and bagged many a vote. When
he time came Mr. Carlisle made his nomiation
and Mr. Randall seconded, both mak- A
ng ornate and graceful addresses. Then n
Ir. Carlisle said smilingly to Mr. Kooerrson
hat the best thing for him to do was to ]
aove to make Mr. Lindsey's nomination
nanimous, but Mr. Robertson simply re- g)
died, "Waitawhile." Then Mr. Morrison,
rho was to put Mr. Milbum in nomination, S(
rose and stood for a minute in his usual
ttitude, with his hands in his pockets. ^
.'hen he said : "I have no eloquent figures
nth which to address you, but only a few
lain words. I nominate a man for chap- ^
tin who loves God, hates the devil and
lways votes the straight Democratic ticket,
knowing the Northern Methodists of llli- ^
ois as 1 do, I ask that if a minister of that
hurch who has voted the Democratic ticket
r. Illinois for twenty-five years does not cj
leserve well of a Demoratic House, who
oes?" This speech, following the efforts!
f Mr. Robertson, was a clincher, and as a j (j
nember afterward said who hadanticipated |
different result, "it settled the business." '
Jr. Carlisle and Mr. Randall waited long 11
nough to see the drift, and then meekly
;ot up and left. t(
Four Colored People Drowned.?
'our colored people, two men and two c
romen, were drowned in Broad river at
point sever .1 miles below the Air Line
>ridge, night before last. It appears that;
n the night in question, the neighborhood j V
larkies had a frolic on the plantation of j ?
dr. D. J. Smith, in York county, S. C., j d
nd some of them on their return to their i o
lomes, hud to cross the river. An ordinary a
lug out canoe furnished the means of trans- i t<
lortation across the water. The boat's last | v
uad consisted of five colored people, two of |
vhom were women, and almost immedi- ri
tely after embarking they noticed that the It
?oat was leaking badly. Believing that tl
hey could keep the canoe afloat by bailing v
t out they continued pulling for the other I S
hore. They had underestimated their k
bility to bail out the water and despite
heir efforts the boat gradually filled, but h
hey managed to keep it afloat until almost e
vi thin reach of the shore. The bank which a
hey were approaching came down abrupt- a
y into the water which was deep, and the 11
)oat went under when within about ten j tl
eet of the landing. Two of the men grasp- j ?
id the two woman and endeavored to save b
hem, when all four sunk and were drown-1
id. The remaining member of the party -S|

LETTER FROM McCONNELLSVILLE.
McConnellsville, S. C., December 14.
Vs the people of our country are now trying
o close up the business of the year, the fact1
Iraws upon the minds of our business men \
hat this is a disastrous year to all classes of;
>ur people. The crops are all short of an j
iverage yield, and cotton, the king of our j
armers, has played them false, both as to '
field and price.
AVhat is to become of our country if our '
armers continue to plant cotton as the only
noneyedcrop? Let the farmers think, and
hink well of this before their plans are setled
for another year. Let them find out by
. lose reasoning and calculating, whether
.otton can be raised at 84 cents or under,
md whether they can aftord to buy meat
ind bread on credit, and pay for it in the
all from the proceeds of cotton at present
trices. There is no reasonable probability
hat the price will beany better next fall
:han it is now.
A general unrest and dissatisfied feeling
s observable among tenants and laborers,
md as a result there will be, probably, more
MOVing anil CllUIIglUg wi jumcn iiiia.Tr?auii,
linn for several years.
LThis year has fully demonstrated that the
'one crop system" will not do. Will our
armers learn from this great and expensive
'object lesson?" It has cost them millions,
md it is too expensive to be demonstrated
5ften without breaking up the country.
~ Dr. W. M. Love has moved into his new
louse here, and Mr. C. L. Moore will move
nto his in a few days. Mr. F. D. Williams,
me of our popular merchants, rents the
louse of Mr. J. M. Williams for another

?Mr. Wm. M. Ashe, of our neighborhood,

soceity of Olivet Church, will have an enertainment
on Christines night, at the Acad?my
here, for the purpose of raising funds

consist of a Christmas tree and hot supper.
Twenty-five cents admission will becnargid,
and every ticket purchased by visitors
,vill draw a present from the tree. A band
.vill be present to furnish music for the occasion,
and a large crowd is expected.
I understand that Mr. Paul, of Union
seminary, will preach soon, probably next
sunday, at Bethesda, with the view of being
'ailed to that church as pastor.
Mr. P. W. Lindsay moves soon to the
Mace recently occupied by his brother, Mr.
II. M. Lindsay. We would prefer seeing
)ur genial friend moving in this direction,
mstead of going the other way.

The bill to repeal the Act forbidding the :

inr wito wns siro-ued before the Senate and i

evening, F. T. Morgan, Esq., and Maj.
I. P. Hamilton representing the petitioners
ir repeal, and G. W. Gage, Esq., and Maj.
ulius Mills representing the counter pe-1
ition. Mr. Morgan made a strong argu-1
tient for the repeal of the act. His posi-j
ion was that prohibition had failed to pro- j
libit, and that the best way of accomplish-1
ng this end was by means of high license. |
Toreover he showed that the petitioners for |
he repeal of the Act were composed of the i
irgest property-holders in the town of;
'hester. While Air. Morgan is not an ad-1
ocate of the sale of intoxicating liquors, !
e believes In the fairness and justice of I
he local option law, and believes that Ches- j
E?r and other towns that have been derived
of it, are entitled to its benefits.
Taj. Mills, in his argument opposing the I
appal of the Act, claimed that the law had '
not proved a failure. ?but a benefit to the
town. The unfavorable report of the Joint
Committee on the bill to repeal the Act
forbidding the sale of "intoxicating liquors'
in our town was a great disappointment to
the advocates of high license, as they ex-;
pected a different result. Having failed to
accomplish anything by an appeal to the |
Legislature, they will now appeal to the
people. They will make the prohibition j
question an issue in the next primary cam-1
paign. I think so from what I have heard.

acres belonging to H. II. Wilkes, bought by

to the estate of Thomas Woods, bought by
J. L. Glenn for $G50; 310 acres belonging to
the same, bought by S. B. Massey & Son for
$750. The low price of land is due to the
great scarcity of money. M.
Correspondence of the Yorkville Enquirer.
THE STATE LEGISLATURE.
Columbia, November 14.?The most of
the time to this dale has been consumed by
the General Assembly in the introduction
of Bills and. committet^$r? and now the
Calender shows the matters to be disposed
of. There are an unusuab number of Constitutional
amendments proposed.
1. An amendment providing that the poll
tax shall not be less than one dollar and
strikes out of the Constitution the proviso
that no person shall ever be deprived of the
right of suffrage for the non-payment of poll
tax. This amendment has passed the House,
but has not been acted on by the Senate.
2. An amendment striking out the provision
requiring a State census every ten
years, and authorizing the General Assembly
to adopt the preceding U. S. census as
a correct enumeration of the inhabitants of
the State for the purposes of a reapportionment
of the representation of the several
counties of the State in the House of Representatives.
This has passed the Senate
and has received two readings in the House.
This will almost certainly pass, but a fight
will be made to take a State census this
year, many up country members not feeling
willing to wait two years to secure a
reduction of the representatives from the
low country. To take a census will cost
a good sum of money for a very small advantage.
The proposed amendment to equalize the
representation in tne .-senate, vvnien wuuiu
deprive the county of Charleston of one
Senator was defeated in both J-Iouses.
A new section was proposed to the Constitution
providing that the Legislature shall
have no power to authorize any county or
other corporation or sub-division of' the
State to issue honds or lend its credit to any
corporation, association or company, which
was defeated. If this had passed it would
have been a good thing for the railroads
now builttas it would have practically put
an end to railroad building in this State.
Another amendment proposed to vest the
election of Superintendent of Public Education
in the General Assembly, to increase
his term of office to four years and to give
the appointment of School Commissioners
of the counties to the Governor. This was
rejected by the Senate. The argument used
for its passage .was that by divorcing this
office from politics that more efficient officers
would be secured, the argument used against
it was that it was giving too much power
and patronage to the Governor.
An important Bill has passed the House
and is now on the Calendar of the Senate.
It is a Bill to establish the priortty of liens.
The liens prescribed are in the following
order: 1st. Landlord's lien for rent and
supplies. 2nd. Laborers who assist in makingthecrop.
3rd. All other liens for agricultural
supplies. This has been continued on
the calendar to await the result of the action
of the Senate on a Bill from the House to
repeal the lien law in toto, which passed
that House by a large majority. The indications
are that it will also pass the Senate.
If it does this disposes of the above named
Bill.
The Bill which required emigrant agents
to pay a license of $500, which passed the
House, was rejected by the Senate.
A bill has passed the House to regulate
municipal and special elections so as to require
the electors to register as in general
elections.
A Bill to authorize county commissioners
to work short term convicts on the public
highways or on the streets of towns or
cities will probably become a law ; also a
Bill to require the Superintendent and Directors
of the Penitentiary and the Agricultural
Department to pay all money received
by them into the State treasury, and to
be drawn out by them on warrants from
the Comptroller General.
A Bill to renew and extend the charter of
YOrKVllie nas passeu urn oenait; ami is uii
its passage through the House, also a Bill
to amend the charter of the town of Black's
by extending its limits half a mile further
westward; also a bill to renew the charter
of the town of ilock Hill.
The question of continuing the canal has
not been settled yet. I think the majority
of the General Assembly are opposed to
any further aid to this project except convict
labor.
The Bill to abolish free tuition, in South
Carolina University, and the Bill to abolish
the Railroad Commission have not been
acted upon.
The Bill providing a stenographer for our
Circuit was rejected by the Senate. A Bill
to repeal the law giving to the militia the
annual appropriations of $14,000, was defeated
in the House. A Bill passed the
House to exempt all persons who served in
the confederate army from road duty.
A Bill to fix the rate of interest at 7 per
cent, instead of 10 per cent, as is now allowed
on contracts, was, after a long discussion
in the Senate, killed.
The Bill to repeal the Prohibitory liquor
law in Oconee county, and place it backunder
the operations of the local option law
passed the Senate, but I do not think it will
pass the House.
The fight of the session on the prohibition
question, which it was understood would
come off in the House on the loth, drew a
large crowd of spectators. Delegations were
present from Anderson, Chester, Sumter,
Oconee, and Barnwell. There were double
delegations from each of these counties?one
seeking repeal of the prohibition laws now
in force, the other asking that the status
quo should stand. The county of Anderson
upon which the fight was made, asked that
the county of Anderson be allowed to vote
upon the question as to whether license
would be granted in the town of Anderson.
After a long and spirited discussion by
members on both sides, the question came
up on a motion to indefinitely postpone the
Bill, the result of the vote on this motion
was. nvps 5(>. navs 54. A motion was then
made by the enemies of the Hill to reconsider
that vote and lay that motion on the table,
which, if agreed to, would bury the Bill
beyond any hope of resurrection. This vote
resulted, ayes 55, nays 55. So the motion
was not agreed to. Friday night the tight
was again resumed on a motion to reconsider,
which was lost, ayes 44, nays 50.
This ended a very hard tight, in which
neither side had anything to boast of. The
result was generally accepted by the delegations
from other counties as settling the
question for this session.
A Bill has been introduced to permit the
sale of domestic wines made from home
grown grapes, in quantities of less than one
gallon, the wine to be sold in bottles on the
premises where grown, bearing a label with
the name of the grower.
This Legislature is a hard working body,
but whether it properly appreciates the
true condition of the farming, and I may
say all other businessintcrests, which are so
much depressed by the stringency of the
times and the low price of cotton and other
farm products, a tax under these conditions,
which in prosperous times would scarcely be
felt, becomes a grievous burden, and calls
for the strictest economy in expenditures for
public purposes, that is consistent with an
efficient administration of public affairs.

Mr. DAVIS* LECTURE.
A good audience assembled at the Presbyterian
church on Wednesday evening of last week
to hear the lecture of Rev. John W. Davis, a
returned missionary from China. All who were
present were highly entertained by the speaker's
happy style of relating the habits and customs
of the Chinaman in his native land.
THE M. E. CHURCH.
By the action of the Conference, in session last
week at Columbia, Rev. J. Thomas Pate, for the
past year pastor of the M. E. Church at this'
place, lias been stationed at Florence, and will,
be succeeded here by Rev. W. W. Daniels. Mr.'
Pate discharged his pastoral duties here in a
manner most acceptable to his congregation, and
his transfer to another field is regretted, not only
by his own congregation, who labored to prevent
it, but by our citizens generally.

^kmad dog.
Wo learn that on last Monday morning Mr.
Wm. Thomasson, while walking from his house
to Massey's store, six miles east of town, when
within about one hundred yards of the store,
met a dog which tried to bite him. Mr. Thomasson
endeavored to kick the dog off, which he
succeeded in doing without sustaining any hurt
to his person, though so firmly had the dog set
his teeth in his pants, they were badly torn before
he let loose. Messrs. W. II. Moore and
Henry Massey, each with a gun, mounted horses
and pursued the dog, which they killed after a
chase of six miles. During the chase, the supposed
mad dog had a fight with another dog,
and also attempted to bite a negro boy on Mr.
W. S. Wilson's place.
the railroad survey.
The engineer corps surveying the route of the
Georgetown and North Carolina Railroad from
Black's, on the Air Line, south, reached Yorkville
last Tuesday, having made a preliminary
survey from Black's. The survey crosses King's
Creek on thelands of Mr. Whisonant, and Clark's
Fork on the lands of Mr. W. M. Faulkner, and
then proceeds in the direction of the King's Mountain
road, striking that road near the residence
I of Mr. D. M. Hall, live miles north-west of town.
The line crosses the Chester and Lenoir Railroad
near the residence of Col. W. B. Wilson, runs
east of the Cemetery and crosses the Rock Hill
road near the Snider lot, one mile east of the
Court House. The engineers are proceeding in
the direction of Smith's Turnout, and on Tuesday
moved their camp to Moss' Mill, two miles
south-east of town.
