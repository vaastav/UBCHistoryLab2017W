Retirement of Judge Nelson.
The retirement of ITon. Samuel Nel
son from the bench of the Supreme
Court of the United States, after a term
of service exceeding twenty-seven years,
in addition to its national and political
significencc and importance, has a local
interest to the people of Vermont, from
Ins having received his collegiate educa
tion at one of our colleges, and having
presided over, the United States Courts
for Vermont, with a few exceptional in
stances, since 1845. Having thus retired
to private life, full of years and full of
honors, a brief resume of his life may be
both Interesting and opportune. lie was
born at. Flebron, Washington county.
New York, si town almost on our imme
diate border, in 1702, and having pur
sued his preparatory studies in one of
the neighloring academies, he entered
Middlebury College, where he graduated
In 181JJ. lie studied law and, upon be
ing admitted to the bar, immediately en
tered upon a successful practice of his
profession, in the active duties of which
he continued until his elevation to the
bench of his native State. His first ap
pearance in public life was as a member
of the Constitutional Convention of New
York, in 1821. Judge Hammond, in his
"Political History of New York," pub
lished in 1843, says that, although a
young man, ht' was among the most dis
tinguished members elected by the Dem
ocrats, .of a Convention that "presented
an array of talent, political experience
and moral worth, perhaps never surpass
ed by any assemblage of men elected
from a single State." Such was the
ability and legal acumen displayed by
him in the Convention that, in 61'.. at
the earl j' age of thirty, he was appoint
ed a Judge of the Circuit Court of the
Slate of New York. The appointment
of so young a man to a high judicial po
sition would be noticeable at any time,
but was especially so fifty years ago. as
tin idea was then almost universal and,
we are sorry to say, is still prevalent to
some extent that legal knowledge, busi
ness capacity, talent and wisdom were
the sole attributes of age. In 18:51. on
the election of William L. Marcy to the
United States Senate, he succeded him "j
a a Judge nI Supreim Court of the
Slate of New York, and, in 1830, was
elevated to the Chief Justiceship of the
same Court, on the retirement of Chief
Justice Browuson. On the 13th of Feb
ruary, lS4r, lie was nominated by Presi
dent Tyler, anil confirmed by the Senate.
Judge of the United States Supreme
Court in place, of Judge Thompson, de
ceased. This action of the Senate was
a marked compliment to Judge Nelson,
as they were politically opposed to him,
and had previously rejected the nomina
tion of John C. Spencer and refused to
act upon that of Chancellor Walworth
for the same position, although both of
these gentlemen were able lawyers, pro
found jurists, and in every way qualified
to adorn the bench. How well he per
formed the duties of his high station,
the current judicial history of the conn
try attests, and as "a patent judge," if
we rway so designate him, he stands with
out a peer, or even a rival, In the world.
In acknowledgment of his legal acquire
ments and judicial ability, he was ap
pointed by President Grant one of the
members of the "Joint High Commis
sion," on the part of the United States,
and it is understood, and we believe gen
erally conceded, that our commissioners
relied almost entirely upon him in all
questions of legal construction. His last
official act was tc affix his siguature to
the Treaty of Washington. And now,
after nearly a half century's service as
Judge of the highest courts of the laud
a longer term of judicial service than
has before been known in the annals of
this or any other country lie returns to
the privacy of domestic life, bearing
With him the acclaim of all good citizens.
"Well done, good and faithful servant."
The North Carolina Senatorship.
- -The deadlock in the Legislature of the
Old North State, consequent upon the
difiicultiev experienced in selecting a
popular United States Senator has at
length been broken. Tt will be remem
bered that ex-Governor Vance and Judge
Merrimon have both been soliciting the
honor on the Conservative side against
John Pool, the Republican candidate.
For nearly a week past the struggle has
been going on between the contestants,

legislation was suspended during this
conflict. At length, after much bolting

has been elected, the vote Tuesday re

&ud for "consequential" damages In the
abama case, turns out not to.be a new

war, $109,000 was paid by the United
States to the citizens of Georgia as com
pensation for slaves who had escaped in
to Florida. The owners of these slaves
subsequently presented a further claim
of $141,000 as compensation for the
children that the female slaves might
have borne to their masters had they re
mained in bondage, as such children, if
born, would have been, under, the la
of Georgia, slaves and "consequentially"

REPORT- MONEY BROKERS FINANCIAL,
REPORT OF THE COMPTROLLER ETC.
Washington, Dec. 3.
At an early hour the galleries of both
Houses of Congress were quite well fill
ed, and upon the floors the usual hand
shakings were observed. The Liberal
Republicans were the centers of attrac
tion in the different circles. With the
exception of Senators Sumner and iiice
none of the soreheads seemed out of
sorts, and all appeared reconciled to the
situation. 1 he resolution of Mr. Sum
ner, in reference to striking from the
Army Register and regimental colors all
allusions to the battles of the late war,
and also Senators Rice's calling upon the
President to explain why troops were
sent into Arkansas, created no little sur
prise. On roll call iu the House only 14!) an
swered to their names. Although there
was a quorum, much surprise was mani
fested on account of there not being
more members in their seat?. Tn the
Senate, however, there was a b-tt"r rep
resentation. The refusal of the House to accept the
resignation of General Banks as chair
man of the committee on Foreign Af
fairs, is the theme for discussion in every
circle, and generally the course of the
House is dissapproved.
It was expected that General Farns
worth and Blair would follow Banks'
'resigning the chairmanships of their res
pective committees : but no such good
luck was in store. The refusal to ac
cent the resignaticn of Mr. B. was con
sidered by those two gentlemen ("so their
friends say) a good excuse why they
should be retained.
There are, at least, a dozen clerkships
held by Greeley men by virtue of the
sore-heads Republican Senators and
Representatives, places which will sure
ly be retained to the detriment and dis
appointment of ardent republicans who
have labored hard with brain and money
in the cause of the Republican party.
The report of Hon. A. M. Clapp,
Congressional printer, furnishes the
following of interest:
The total amount of printing during tlx
past year authorized bv law or by joint
resolution, has been $436,449.30; total
authorized bv the Senate, $125,645.45;
total authorized bv the House. $20.j.

I lie anove statement or printing, in
cludes lithographing, cost of paper, dry
pressing, folding, engraving, binding.
etc., which is no small proportion of the
sums total.
In concluding his report, Mr. Clapp
very appropriately calls attention to the
present and prospective necessities of his
office and recommends an appropriation
sufficient to erect a wing on the west line
of the present building similar to the one
erected on the east side one year ago
also an increase ot clerical torce and an
encouragement of higher grade by an in
crease of pay.

There are two ways resorted to by
money lenders in Washington to get
usurious rates of interest out of the un
fortunate (distressed) borrower. The
first, perhaps the less objectionable way,
is from the banks which generally have
confidential agents who are generally de
nominated "real estate agents or brok
ers" who also inform the public that
claims are collected, and money loaned
on good collateral at 10 per cent per an
num, (as per act of Congress some two
years ag, allowing such a rate in special
contract.) These agents are sought af
ter by hundreds needing money, who
are politely informed that they have
money to loan on desirable property,
but require an abstract title made by a
certain party to whom the borrower is
respectfully referred. From $15 to $25
he is charged for an examination. He
pays it with hope then on the presenta
tion of his abstract to the agent, the
money will be forthcoming. But to his
disappointment he is told "I am out of
money to-day, call again in a day or two
and I'll accommodate you." lie calls
again and again, and at last is told that
the money market is very tight and that
he can only act as agent for which he
shall be compelled to charge him from 5
to 10 per cent, (according the amount
loaned) for procuring it for him. Gen
erally this offer is accepted as the only
nlternative. and the bank doubtless re
ceives not only the 10 per cent, but a
portion of the agent's fee. Your corres
pondent will venture to say that one
third o the real estate in Washington is
under similar loans, paying indirectly
20 per cent per annum.
The second way is practiced by par
ties wh only make money-broking a
specialty, making short loans, and re
quiring no real estate security, but to
those outside of government employ,
good endorsers are required, and these
notes are what is known as made note,
i. e., the note is made to a confidential
third party, who winks for the sake of
a division of the spoils, to a discount of
from 5 to 10 per cent per month. There
are estimated to be twenty of these
sharpers playing upon the distressed of
this city and who have amassed fortunes
in the past few years. Two of these, to
make their illegitimate transactions re
spectable, have secured charters and
have opened banks.
The clerks in the several departments,
which number over six thousand, are the
better patrons of this latter class. The
families of these clerks, in consequence,
suffer, and Congress is yearly called upon
in order to alleviate their suffering, to
increase the pay of the clerical force.
What shall be done? Will not Con
gress answer by enacting a stringent
usury 1 law which shall compel these
money-brokers of Washington to pursue
a different and useful occupation ?
The business of the country has, to no
small extern, been deranged by the late
stringency in the money market. For
some time it was impossible, in New
York to get mercantile paper discounted
at any rate consistent with ordinary prof
its in a legitimate business. Even first
class notes were charged one per cent a
month, and second class had no chance
whatever. The interior trade suffered
from the same causes. Export trade
was burdened in addition by irregularity
in gold and exchange, high rates of
transportation and the raising of the
rates ot discounts by the Bank of Eng
land to 7 per cent. This remarkable fi
nancial phenomena was the result of an
increased demand upon the bank by the
interior trade of England and of the
heavy drain caused by the paj'ment of
the Franco-German indemnity. Both
of these causes have spent their main
force and now a favorable reaction has
set m. The London money market sud
denly raised up to five per cent. France
has paid her third millard and is about
to discharge a half of the fourth. When
the fourth millard is paid the French
territory will be evacuated and the great
financial efforts of the Government to
secure this desideratum by advance pay
ments will cease.
The comptroller of currency has pub
lished his annual report in w hich, among
other important items, i3 presented the
fact that since the organization of the
National bank system in 1863. only" 21
Natimial banks have failed1 of their ag
gregate circulation $2,042,703. The
treasury has reduced $2,411,430, and
stands ready; to redeem the balance as
soon as presented. The holders of these
note, however, are in no hurry. Very
likely but few are aware that the banks
have failed. Not one in a hundred ever
looks at the name of the bank issuing the
note. Everybody knows that there is
provided a fund ample for the redemp
tion. When we compare the present
stability of our circulating medium with
the wild cat eras of the past, w e realize
something of the magnificent character
of republican statesmanship. The first
great point ot stability has been reached.
Within the true limits of the system it
is now proposed to introduce features
l. i. ..'hi r. . .... . -
which win give greater elasticity to the
currency and enable it. to adapt itself
more readily to the changing wants of
business These are points to' which the
comptroller invites the special attention
of Congress.
Mr. Van Vliet a native of the North
land, but since 1840, a resident of Rata
via, Java, in his late visit to the Com
missioner of Education in search of in
formation in regard to American schools,
nmde some interesting statements with
regard to affairs in Java. He savs there
are 16.000.000 natives, 00, 000 Europe
ans. 150.000 are Chinese.
The Chinese educate their ow n chil
dren in their ow,n way. and every child
can read, write and reckon. Very little
is done for the education of the children
of Europeans, there being only primary
schools for them. Any such desiring ad
vanced education have to go to Holland.
Only about $120,000 are expended for
the education of the entire native'popu
ulation. With a view to removing these deplo
rable neglects, Mr. Van Vliet is gather
ing information for use in his argument
with the government officers in Java.
The President has accepted an invita

Life.
Telegraphic Feat, The New York
Eceniug Post calls attention to the fact,
as a great telegraphic feat, that the
President's Message "was transmitted to
New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore
in about forty-five minutes, which is the
shortest time ever attained with so long
a document. Twelve wires were used,
and the weather was favorable for work
ing purposes. There are eleven thousand
three hundred and thirty-nine words in
the message." There were, of course,
twelve operators, each engaged in the
transmission and receipt of the message,
and forty-five minutes for each operator
would make the time occupied in the
tranmission, as well as m its receipt,
nine hours. If this is a great feat for
Washington, New York, Philadelphia
and Baltimere operators, we will pit our
regular night operator, who takes all our
pres telegraph reports, against the
world. Monday night, "solitary and
alone." he received and wrote out the
entire message, eleven thousand three
hundred and thirty-nine words, in seven
hours. When he had finished the mes
sage, he was ready for more. He beat
the Washington, New York, Baltimore
and Philadelphia operators by two hours
and as if this was not enough', like Oli
ver Twist, asked for "more."

memorial Sermon on tlie DcatU of
Horace Greeley, Preaehed at the
Town 'Hall, Rutland, December
4th, 1872, by Rev. W. P. Aiken.
We give herewith an abstract of the
sermoa of Rev. William P. Aiken, at
the memorial services, Wednesday, re
ported expressly for The Herald :
The mournful event which brings us
together has filled our hearts with genu
ine sorrow; the death of Horace Greeley,
whose name and whose fame have long
been a national possession, joins a pub
lic calamity to private bereavement,
When rumors of his illness began
to be circulated, it was plain to see
in the anxious inquiries that were
made, in the subdued and compas
sionate tones in which men spoke, and
in the generous recognition of his per
sonal worth and eminent services that
he still retained his old strong-hold upon
the hearts of the people, while the sad
spectacle that was disclosed when the
curtain was lifted, caused all to feel that
the circumstances of his death were
scarcely less sorrowful than the death
itselt.
It is not the loss of a sagacious leader
in the politics of the country that we de
plore when such a man dies, party may
suiter ; but the country has never been
known to suiter, nor is it the loss or a
gifted and accomplished editor of the
most widely read and influential journal
the world has ever known, and who did
much to elevate journalism in this coun
try to the dignity or a science but we
deplore the loss of an efficient worker in
the cause of human progress, whose in
fluence was not limited to the field of
political thought nor confined to the
channels of political action, but who
sought in either field of letters as well as
the field of politics, by spoken as well as
by written eloquence, to do good to his
f ellowmen ; who wras of tener heard in the
lyceum than in the caucus, ottner at ag
ricultural meetings than political con
ventions : whose principles were not ex
pedients devised to swell the ranks or
secure the triumphs of. party, but were
derived from the study of political econ
omy, of the duties and obligations of
civil government : a man of kindly na
ture, of overflowing charity and chari
ties, and whose voice has ever been ap
plied in the behalf of temperance, truth,
iustice and humanity. Such was the
man whose death we deplore. The
preacher then gave a sketch of his life
which, as all are laminar with it, is
omitted. He then proceeded to say that
Mr. Greeley first made himself felt as a
power in the politics of the country in
the election ot WW. Jiunng the six
months preceding that election, he con
ducted what was popularly Known as a
campaign paper and which contributed
largely to the success of the Whig party.
In some respects no position we can im
agine could be worse tor. a young man,
if he was willing to do party work mthe
usual dirty way ot party. In other re
soects it was an admirable school of
training for the work he was afterward
to undertake. The issue was to be
made within a given time and men
pressed to an immediate decision. Hence
lie had to study the art of putting things
in the most effective way, to write
terse, vigorous, pointed articles, sharp,
strong, direct argument, to condense
into a few lines the substance of a long
essay, and yet omit nothing important
to be said to carry the minds of men, ss
it, were, by storm. This was an excel
lent training for the columns of the Tri
bune, which he established in 1811. To
talk of Mr. Greeley here is to talk of poll
tics, parties, tariffs, slavery, temperance,
education, farming, in short of every sub-
lect connected with the interests ot hu
inanity. One needs to know better than
the preacher did the history of the coun
try, the state of parties, opinions, meas
ures, the moral condition and sentiment
of the people, the tone of the press, be
fore he could duly appreciate the work
of Mr. Greeley and its value to the coun
try. Still he knew the state of the
country was very different from what
it is now. -Parties were different, ineas-
nres different. Of the living issues of
that day, not one, if we except the tariff,
has survived to our time. Some have
been settled, some the countrj' has wil
lingly let (he ; one that had not even
then assumed its frightful proportions
has been settled at a great cost of money
and precious life. The South ruled the
country, it filled all the high offices of
government, it controlled all offices in
the army and in the navy, all offices
from foreign ministers down to the
humblest post office in the laud. It con
trolled missionary societies and tract so
cieties, the press and the pulpit. The
political press taught human equality
and slavery ; the religious, human broth
erhood and slavery. Probably the most
widely read political journal was the
New York Herald. It had been the
first to make daily reports of the stock
market. Its editor had . displayed won
derful energy in securing the collection
and transmission of news from distant
places ; these were the only really decent
things about the paper. It had no fixed
opinions, no principles, no conscience.
It pandered to vulgar tastes and low ap
petites. Still upon the question of slav
ery the Herald was certainly no worse
than other papers, even the religious.
Slavery was a humane institution, it
was a divine institution, it was a chris
tianizing institution only the mission
ary, instead of going abroad to the hea
then, bred the heathen upon his own soil,
and, instead of being scourged for
preaching Christianity, he scourged his
converts. With these trifling differences,
he was no unworthy successor of Paul
himself. Mr. Calhoun was the only
political seer in the country, at least the
only one who was willing to see. He
saw the irrepressible conflict long before
Mr. Seward formulated that famous
phrase. He saw that the fertile lands
of the North and West were destined to
be settled and to be free. Immigrants
from the peasantry of Ireland, Norway
and Sweden, from the artizan and labor
ing classes of Germany, were to come
hungering for land and with an unborn
hate of tyranny and oppression. He
sought the annexation of Texas and ac
complished it a slice of Mexico and got
it. But what he did not see was, that
in the mountains and in the river-beds of
California there was gold, and gold
made California a free State.
. Into this conflict Horace Greeley
threw himself with all the ardor of his
passionate nature. He had been nour
ished among the mountains and in the
free air of Vermont a State whose boast
it is that no slave was ever owned with
in her borders. From the first he was
consistent in that he respected the guar
anties of the Constitution. Slavery was
a mistake in political economy unprofit
able in every way, it was a great moral
wrong but still he had no right to in
terfere with it, when it was established,
except in the Way of peaceful argument.
Sydney Smith has somewhere noticed
the change which had taken place in
parties since he began to write. lie saw
many riding in the coach, among them,
the then Prime Minister, looking out the
window, whom he did-not remember to
have seen in the days of the poverty of
the ruling party. Well, in the times
now spoken of, anti-slavery men did
not ride in State coaches. It was scarce
ly safe for an abolitionist of the Garrison
school to walk the streets. Rarely, if
ever, couia tney dc beard peacefully.
The time came when the the entire South
was interdicted territory to Horace Gree
ley, unless he was willing to be brutally
muraereo ine time came too, when
he received the best possible testimonia
of the f ruitf ulness and effiiciency of his
services in tne anti-siavery cause, a mob
attacked his printing office. It was not
that he supported the war many other
papers in tne same city were doing that
as vigorously too as the Tribune but
it was because the mob bslieved that
there had been no Tribune there had
been no war. And the mob were right
When Horace Greeley began his labors
there was no political conscience in the
press, nor in parties very little in the
pulpit.. The men who had such a con
science were generally considered to be
infidels. That such a conscience was
awakened, that it was braced first to
resist the encroachments of the 6lave
power, and then to defy its insolent an
gry threats of disunion and war, that it
never tlinched, but accepted as a solemn
duty from God, the contest of war, and
sorrowfully, but willingly, laid whole
hetacombs of the choicest youthful life
upon the altar of his country. All this
is due to Horace Greeley, more than to
any other one man of his time. One
thing that gave him such an influence
was his earnest advocacy of the doctrine
of protection. He believed that our
dearly bought labor could not compete
with the cheaply paid labor of Europe.
Encourage manufactures you thereby
give labor to the mechanic, create a
market for the products of the farm
you make all labor more remunerative.
and in the end. will be found to have
cheapened the price of the manufactured
articles which you have protected
Right or wrong, as a matter of political
economy, it will not be disputed that it
gave him a hold upon the working
classes. The intelligent mechanics and
farmers of the country felt that in him
they had a true friend. He counselled
them to temperance, to frugality, to
cherish a manly independence, especi
ally by scorning all pecuniary dependen
cies, to rorm lyceums, debating socie
ties, libraries, neighborhood societies to
discuss farming. He went himself to
lecture upon all these subjects, and thus
gained audience for anti-slavery senti
ment.
The preacher did not propose to ana
Ivze the character of Mr. Greeley. He
did not know him. But be might add
that one thing which impressed him in
reading the Tribune, was the man in the
paper. It might not be easy to tell
what that is in one article which caus
one to feel the writer, and in another no
more causes one to feel hmWhan a tree
or stone. But it is in some writings and
not in others. Other men write as pure
English. Other men use as weighty ar
guments. Other men are as sincere and
candid. But they do not impress them
selves upon one as he did. He always
seemed to come with his paper to lay the
weight of his presence and personal
character upon the argument. I will
venture to say, said the preacher, that
hundreds who read the Tribune and
never saw the editor, ie:t the influence
and magnetism of this invisible personal
presence.
The preacher then proceeded to notice
the course pursued in the )olitical con
test just ended. He belonged, himself,
to no political party. It is some years
since he had voted. He had given up
the practice of voting for the privilege
of speaking of preaching from the
pnlpit without being heard as a partisan
speaking not from conscience, but
the interested motives of a party man.
w hen the movement began which cul
minated in the Cincinnati convention,
he sympathized with it. Its end seemed
to be good and only good. It appeared
to him that the promises made by the
administration when it came into power
had not been fulfilled. The president
had not defied the politicians, who had
always, more or less, controlled every
administration we have had. But he
did not approve the nomination of Mr.
Greeley, not that he considered him lyi
fit for the office. In looking over the
list of American Presidents, it seemed
to him that acountry which had endured
some of them, now of one party, and
now 'of another,, might well endure Hor
ace Greelev. But he was too vulnerable.
He had written every day almost upon
every conceivable subject or national
interest, written under tlie pressure and
excitement of Jthe moment, often with
imperfect data before him, and it would
be easy to snatch sentences from the
columns of the Tribune, which torn
from their connection and read in ignor
ance ot the circumstances which in
spired them, could be made to mean
whatever party feeling dictated. More
over he had been an uncompromising
toe ot the democratic party. It was
doubtful whether they could be brought
to support him, especially as they were
to come to him and not lie go to them
But he was nominated, and then begun
a series or attacks which tor baseless
ness, for malevolence, for cruelty have
never been surpassed in the history of
political contests. The preacher honest
ly and anxiously desired to know wheth
er Horace Greeley had become a rene
gade and traitor, an associate and part
ner ot drunkards and thieves, lie then
gave a succint narrative of the proceed
ings or tne Cincinnati and iialtimore
conventions. The former adopted an
excellent platform. The latter adopted
that platform. He thought that it was
a matter of congratulation that the
democratic party did so. He then pro
ceeded to notice the charges against Mr.
Greeley. It was said that he was vac
illating. But in what respect ? The
three measures which he strongly sup
ported were the limitation of : the presi-.
dential service to a single term opposi
tion to American slavery and protection
to home industry. "When did he ever
prove recreant to these principles ?
When had he ever wavered in their sup
port ? , It had indeed been said that he
had renounced the doctrine of protec
tion, to catch the votes of free traders,
by saying that if the country demanded
free trade, he would not, if elected, op
pose it ; that it wa3 said he has refused
beforehand to perform his constitutional
duty, and veto what he disapproved. But
for the life of him, the preacher could
perceive no difference between this and
the saying which over and over again has
been applauded as most patriotic and
statesmanlike "I shall have no will to
oppose to the will of the people.'
It had been said that Mr. Greeley de
serted his party and joined the democ
racy. What were the facts ? That the
Cincinnati platform was republican to
the core is too plain to need argument.
That piatrorm was adopted at Balti
more by the democrats, who nominated
Mr. Greeley. Surely this was the most
remarkable way of conversion to democ
racy ever heard of. The party which
had opposed the war, which had refused
to support or to accept the constitutional
amendments which secured to us and to
our children after us the fruits of the
war; a party which so long as it re
tained that attitude, . rendered the per
fect tranquilizing of the country an im
possibility that party had deliberately
accepted the amendments. Whatever
the motive the deed was done, and irre
vocably done. The party could never
go back upon that act. There were
those who believed they were not sin
cere. It was not to be wondered at,
Upon the questions of war and slavery
the democratic party had a miserable rec
ord. It had done everything to forfeit
confidence,, nothing to deserve it. The
conversion, however, was not altogether
sudden. The year before a leading poli
tician of the party, in the West, had told
them that the time bad come to change
their base ; and his words had met the
approval of many in the party.- But
sudden or not sudden, sincere or
not sincere they could never go
back ot the action of that conven
tion held in Baltimore, in the year of
our Lord 1872. The deed was done, and
it was irrevocable, yet Horace Greeley
was charged with going over to the dem
ocratic party, and that not the party of
the Baltimore convention, not the party
as we hope it is to be in the future, but
the old democratic party of 1861, and
of the years after the party which op
posed the war which gave moral sup
port to the bouth which it was believed
would gladly undo, if it could, what had
been done for human liberty. This was
the party Horace Greeley was said to
have deserted to. The preach
er affirmed that he could find no act, no
single word that ever fell from the lips or
the pen of Horace Greeley, to lend the
shadow of a support to this charge. The
lesson of all this for us, said the preach
er, is to moderate the opinions of politi
cal wartare ; to be truthfnl, to be lust.
There were issues which might have
been made. There were points vital
enough to demand the thoughtful atten
tion of every man. It might have been
said that Mr.' Greely if elected would be
obliged to give office to Democrats ; that
it was not wise, in the present state and
temper of the bouth not yet pacified
to restore to power its old ally, however
sincere their acceptance of the issues of
the war, it might have been said that
justice requires us to believe Gen. Grant,
since he has professed a desire for civil
service reform, and that Mr. Greeley if
elected would meet the same difficulties
which lay in the way of Gen. Grant.
And that as there had been cases which
made it expedient to re-elect the Presi
dent, it was not wise or safe to put it
beyond the power of the people to do so,
These would lrave been fair issues. Nor
is it denied they were mentioned, but
they were soon buried under calumni
ous assaults upon Mr. Greeley. When
he was nominated it was first said to be
the joke of the season. Here was a man
who, but for his following conscientious
convictions of duty, might have been
Governor of the largest State in the
Union. Her august Senator in the Con
gress of the United States, who could
have gone if he had chosen as minister
to a foreign court, where the formalities
of etiquette had grown stiff by centu
ries of practice this man was held up
to the derision of his countrymen, as a
clown and buffoon. I lere was a man
w ho had done more than any one man
to make the Republican paaty; more
than any other one man to make univer
sal liberty and universal suffrage possi
ble to the nation; who had done his
best to drive corrupt judges from the
bench ; thieving receivers from their
seats, and pecculating officials from
their places ; this man was held up as a
renegade from his party, a partner of
miscreants, and waiting only opportunity
of power and office, to buy free men of
their old masters, to pension traitors and
assassins.
To-day Horace Greeley is buried. I
am told, said the preacher, that the press
and the pulpit have poured forth clow
ing eulogies. They lav upon his coffin
the wreaths they would not put upon
his brow. Oh friends, to-day, Horace
Greeley, the man of masterly nund,
whose heart was as tender and loving
as a child, toward all who are oppress
ed; toward all afflicted; toward all in
poverty and want, wa3 dead ; crushed
under an ignoble weight of base calum
n He .died of a broken heart. And
the men who broke his heart were his
countrymen, his long time friends. To
day grave Senators have left their seats
in the Senate chamber, Judges left the
bench, the President leaves the cares
and duties of office to attend his burial,
to pay their grief at his bier. With
tearful eyes and tearful hearts a nation
follows in thought the cortege as it
slow ly wends its.way to the final resting
place ot his body.
Horace Greelev ts dead : ! et he lives
in the hearts of his countrymen. He
will live, in the admiring and grateful
reverence of generations yet to come,
for he belongs
To freedom now and to fame.
And of the few, the immortal names
That were not born to die.

Burglars Abound. The dwelling
house at the corner of West and Pine
streets, in this village, was entered by
burglars, during the night of Thursday
and a silver watch and twenty-five dol
lars in money stolen therefrom. It ap
pears that two families reside in the
house and, for their convenience, proba
bly the outside or street door had lieen
left unfastened, through which an easy
entrance into the building was effected.
They then passed up stairs to the sleep
ing apartments, occupied by Albert Hut
chinson, and while he and his family
were sleeping ia the same room, abstract
ed his pocket-book, containing twenty-
five dollars, and a silver watch, together
with the case in which it was hangin
Having secured their plunder, they made
their escape without awakening any per-
son in the house or attracting observa
tion elsewhere. It is evident that the
country, at this time, is full of burglars
and that they are busily at work plying
their vocation. We can hardly take up
a newspaper, whether published in city
or country, that does not contain notices
of one or more burglaries. In St. Albans,
Tuesday night, Gallar's meat market
was entered and some five dollars in
change taken ; Merrifield's bookstore was
visited and the money drawer emptied ;
the hardware store of Farrar Brothers
and the Elm street school house were
also the recipients of similar attentions.
This, be it remembered, is only the re
cord of one night in a place smaller than
Rutland, and we state these . facts sim
ply as a specimen of their wholesale
operations.. A similar condition of af
fairs exists throughout the country.
There is reason ' to believe that we shall
soon have further depredations to record,
in Rutland, unless the utmost vigilance
is used. We already hear of numerous
well authenticated cases, where prowl
ing strangers have been, seen and heard
around the houses and in the yards of
our citizens, who, upon flhe first appear
ance of activity on the jart of the in
mates of the houses, immediately disap
peared and escaped, unrecognized, in the
darkness. Too much care cannot be
used to see that the doors are securely
locked and bolted, and the windows
fastened. Do not invite these visits by
your own carelessness. Bolts, locks and
watchfulness are the only sure protec
tion against thescinrbads. An ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Railroad Transfer. We learn that
the railroad bridge across Iake Cham
plain at Ticcmderoga and the lease of

Mr. C. C. Hard of New York, the
leader of the Rutland Choral Society,
has consented to teach music in this
place this winter. This presents an op
portunity for studying the art of music,
seldom enjoyed in country towns. Mr.

been the director of music in one of the
prominent churches la 2ew York, and

solicitations by his friends, be has con

CHESTER.
During the past week we have watch
ed certain movements, with a "suspi
cious eye," and as those persons who
have a secret to keep, are sny of report
ers, we were not, for a long time made
aware of the necessity of certain en
terprising individuals so often, hurrying
to and fro in our usually quiet streets.
But in due time we were made a party
to the plot, and as we were under the
lawof secrecy, wedared not divulge. The
sequel reads thusly: That Thanksgiv
ing eve, in addition to its usual festivi
ties, gave to more than two hundred of
our citizens the pleasure of attending a
surprise party, and presentation at that
popular hostel rie, Cole's Central HoteL
t,arly in the evening .Mr. and Airs. Oeo.
H. Cole were invited to the house of a
friend who was in the secret, and a few
moments after their departure, their
friends began to assemble in the spacious
hall connected with the hotel. After
the usual preliminaries of such an occa
sion were over, the entire party were
seated and a messenger in the person of
II. O. Maxfield, repaired to the residence
of M. W. Perbam, and informed Mr.
and Mrs. Cole that their presence was
demanded at home. Oa arriving at the
stairway leading to the hall, thev were
somewhat surprised on meeting Messrs.
Spaulding, Powers and rutnam, who in
sisted upon taking them In charge and
conducting them to the hall. The open
ing of the hall door revealed to them &
scene which wa3 well calculated to
turn their surprise at the to them
singular proceedings thus far, into utter
astonishment. The. brilliantly lighted
hall, the large assemblage of. thelr
friends and acquaintances, the strange
silence which pervaded the room, served
to form a problem which, by them,
could not be solved. Oa approaching
the head of the hall they encountered
Representative Henry, who had just re
turned from the councils of State with
his well earned laurels yet damp upon
his" brow, standing near a table, wnich
held and hid from their fights a treasure
which was soon to be theirs.
After a choice selection of music bad
been played by the Chester Quadrille
Band, Hugh Henry, .q., approached
Mr. Cole and addressed bim substantially
as touows: ".During tue last two
months I have frequently directed my
remarks to one, which custom required
I should address as Mr. Speaker, and my
remarks have oft times, during that
period, been listened to by a less number
of persons, than are assembled here on
this more than pleasant occasion. To
night my remarks are addressed to one,
whom I simnlv address as Mr. (le
and in behalf of your friends wboj have
assembled at this time I feel the! mo6t
intense pleasure ia thus conveying to
you, a slight tosen 01 tneir appreciation
of your efforts to stand at the head of a
first class and popular hotel, and also
their confidence in you as a citizen, and
a friend. A well conducted and well re
gulated hotel, adds to the material pros
perity of a town, as well, as does any
other business enterpri?e. And in your
labors, which have tended toward giving
Chester, a popular hostelrie whose fame
has reached beyond the borders cf our
dearly beloved'Xew England, you have
had the heartfelt sympathy of our peo
ple, and words 01 good cheer will al
ways be spoken for the old Ipgrabam
House, for the love of the associations
which have clustered around it, since
you and your estimable wife have acted
as host and hostess. .Permit me, in con
clusion, to present to 3'ou in behalf cf
these friends as a hotel keeper, and a
man, this gift now before you, and we .
trust that you will not value it for m-
trisic value alone, but that you will
prize it for its extrinsic w ortb, and for
the spirit which prompted the doHors to
tender it. As you have, thus far, glided
serenely oa ia life's journey, even so
may you continue till time for jou shall
be no more, and at last, when our labors
on earth are ended, may we all greet
each other in heaven, with the reniinis-
ences of this life."
At the close of these remarks, the
covering, which had bid from sight this
unexpected gift, was removed, and the
recipients were completely surprised, and
deeply affected, on beholding this mani
festation of good will on the part of their
friends. The present consisted of an
elegantly chased silver, ice-pitcher and
salver, which was- procured at the jew
elry store of C. M. Maxfield. The pitcher
bore the following neatly engraved in
scription: "To Mr. and Mrs. Georgd H.
Cole, from theirChester friends, Novem
ber 28, 1872."
At the conclusion of Mr. Henry 8 re
marks, Mr. Cole, with a voice choking
with emotion, appropriately responded
to the presentation speech After the
ceremonies attending the presentation
were through with, the cornet sounded.
and until late In the "wee sma' hours,"
one of the most happy assemblages of
the devotees of "terpischore" that ever
gathered in Cole's Hall, continued to
wander through the intricate mazes till
all bad danced their fill.
Supper was furnished at an early Lour.
and the large company of friends who
had assembled upon this banpy occasion. .
sat down to tables that were literally
groaning beneath the weight ot good
things, which included innumerable
dainties and luxuries that would have
tickeled the palate of the most faetidi
ous epicurean. The supper was furnished
by the ladies, who were engaged in the
plot, and for a few hours, Mr. and Mrs.
Cole found themselves the guests of a
party, who bad taken possession of their
home. On the whole, it was a well
merited and substantial compliment paid
to a deserving and popular favorite of
the public, and every one teemed to ap
preciate it. No person present seemed
to enjoy the occasion more than mlae
host's daughter "little May," who is a
iavonte witn an classes, and we trust
she will always have pleasing memories
of this event. Videx.
