Croup is a terror to youngi moth

cause, first symptoms and sreat
merit is the object of this item. The
origin of croup is a common cold.
Children who are subject to it take
cold very easily and croup is almost
sure t; f ll w. The first symptom is
hoarseness; this is soon followed by
a peculiar rough cough, which Is
easily recognized and will never be
forgotten by one who liaa heard it.
The time to act is when the child
first becomes hoarse. If Champer
Iain's Cough Remody is freely given
all tendency to croup will soon dis
appear. Even after the croupy cough
has developed it will prevent the
attack Thore is no danger in giv

CAPT. GIBSON MET THE SAINTS
ASatUfactory Meeting of His Chief
Lieutenants.
Captain Gibson wined and dined
the saints of the Lod at the Palace
Hotel Friday, Dec. 3.
The meeting was called to order
by Lieutenant W. L. -Trent, Cap
tain Gibbon's Po8t;Master at Knox
vilie who stated that the object of
the meeting was to save Captain
Gibson from the wrath of disap
pointed office-seekers, and deliver
ed an address of welcome.
Bob Lindsay of Coal Creek re
sponded and stated that Captain
Gibson would be quite strong in
Anderson if Brother Bart, Judge
Hicks or some other man wlw
could beat him didn't run.
John L. Goddard of Maayville
stated that Blount was solid for
Gibson except "fellers" who didn't
get office.
John C. Hollingsworth and D. H.
Rosier stated that Campbell was
solid, that it had been reported
over there that he would not ap
point any post masters in Sevier
county who would get drunk and
cuss and that the people of tnat
county believed that was a cam
paign lie started by the Blambt-r
Houked Prohibitionists to injure
Captain Gibson in his race, and all
the people of Campbell county who
either cuss or drink (which is about
all the voting population) were un
animously for Captain Gibson.
Frank Galbraith of Jefferson
county said that a little thing like
a marshalship or a post office didn't
amount to much and that with the
exception of a few thousand who
were for Rogers. Penland, Buttram,
Greer, or a dark horse, the republi
cans of Jefferson were solidly for
Capt. Gibson.
N. H. Greer of Loudon stated
that not withstanding his brother
Jim was a candidate, Captain Gib
son would hardly lose a vote in
Loudon county or anywhere else.
Gen Will D. Wright was happy
to inform them that Morgan county
was loyal to his "chief," and that
all thes? things Jimmy Swaggerty
had been patting in the Morgan
County Republican about Billio
Buttram going to carry that county
were mere gusto and buncomb.
Major Coffman stated that the
three thousand old soldiers, the
fifteen thousand sons and seventy
five thousand grand-sons of Roane
county were solid for the friend
and comrade, the "chief' of
Hooker's staff.
Dr. J. C. Parker' the Houk man
he appointed post master at Helen
wood, stated that Houk men, Gib
son men, most republicans of Scott
county were for Buttram and that
he himself was about the only
"Saint of the Lord" in Scott but he
was a"goodun." '
"O. K." reported Sevier county
OK. He stated that the only ap
plicant for office in this county who
amounted to anything was his
partner, Jeems Johnson Ellis, and
that he didn't amount to much
That while Penland's followers
would make some noise Captain
Gibson would get the votes. That
the -White Caps" are now against
Penland, aud since Captain Gibson
had joined the "blue bills," that
benevolent order was solidly for
him, and in church matters Cap
tain Gibson had them all, the Bap
tist claim that he is a member of
the First Baptist Church of Knox
ville, while the Methodist claim he
is a member of the First M. E.
Church of the same city, and the
hypocrites know that he is tiie
most hypocritical hypocrite of
them' all and Is at home anywhere
He assured them that Sevier coun
ty would be O. K.
After a number of exhortations
from the smaller saints, they all
went and took some "lightning hot
drops," after which dinner was
served.
After dinner Captain Gibson
indited two telegrams one to his
friend, Speaker Reed to convene
congress Monday, December 6, and
one to President McKinley, saying
that he would be in Washington
in time to revise the President's
message. After which they sang,
"When shall wo all meet agcin ?'
They won't meet any more,

COLLEGE NOTES.
The Annual Mid Winter Entertain
ment of the Athenian Literary Society
will be held in the Chapel of the Col
lege, instead of Columbian Hall as
previously announced in the Times.
The programme is as good as in tor
mer years. The musical numbers es
pecially fine.
Saturday evening the Junior Section
of the Athenian society held a very
spirited meeting; debating on the Ha-
wawian question the principal feature.
The Junior boys are acquiting them
selves like men and bid fair to become
as proficient in lines of debate as some
who have gone out from the society.
Genial Paul Lloyd Smith was seen
among old friends on the Hill last Sab
bath. "Bill" Phillips was also in
Maryville.
The Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A.
of the college held a joint Missionary
Meeting in the Chapel Sabbath after
noon. Miss lieien aimms naving
charge of the exercises. The subject
of the meeting was, "Medaeval Miss
ionaries and Pictures from Missionaiy
History." There were several papers
prepared for the occasion by members
of the two associations. The subject
wa6 illustrated further by the leader's
use of the Volunteer Band's Mission
ary Map of the World. It was a spirit
ed meeting, profitable and interesting
to all.
Externally considered, our new Y.
M. C. A. building, Bartlett Hall, is
almost complete. It is a commanding
structure and by far the most beautiful
structure on the Hill, and is so well
placed that it seems the rest of the
land scape was planned for its recep
tion. This week the last of the metal
cornice was lifted to its place. It is a
triangular affair,. and occupies the
Gothic projections in the front eleva
tion. It contains in relief the Inter
national Emblem of the Y. M. C. A.,
the triangle represents the mind, body
and spirit; upon this the open Bible.
Behind this the Greek cross, signifying
Christ, and in this the letter P mean
ing power through Christ. It is an
appropriate decoration for the building-
Professor Haworh attended Chapel
devotions Tuesday a. m.
The semi-annual publication of our
college paper will be issued the 22nd
of December. It will appear under
the new name of, Orange and Gar
net. The paper is under the manage
ment of a new editorial staff and they
have spared no pains in making an up-to-date
college paper. Several half
tone and chalk-plate engravings will
appear. Both words and , music of
the new College song. "Carmen
Collegii Mariavillensis," will be pre
sented in a full page engraved plate.
Help the editors out by purchasing a
copy of this paper.
A. R. Garrison and William Calli-
ver of Knox County were visiting our
College the first of the week and have
decided to attend school here after
Xmas.
Mr. Cecil Smith of Elizabethton re
turned to his home last Thursday.
Mr. Smith has made a good record
in the Butsiness Department of the
College but owing to the urgent need
for him at home, he returned.
Examinations will begin next Mon
day and will continue till Thursday
afternoon.

ure of entertaining the Synod of Tenn.

The Alpha Sigma Society gave
their Annual Entertainment in Colum
bian Hall on Friday evening, Dec. 10.
The program was well arranged and
well carried out. The music was
furnished by the Alpha Sigma Quar
tette, Duett, Prof. J. G. Newman and
wife, Miss Carnahan and Mrs. Baitlett.
Although the Hall is very poorly
arranged with a view to acoustics, yet
the music was excellently rendered
and appreciated by all.
Fred Caldwell's "Speech on the
Annexation of Cuba" wasa comic
declamation and was well delivered.
J. E. Biddle gave an excellent ora
tion, his subject being, "Anglo
phobia." This oration was well writ
ten and was spoken in a very eloquent
manner.
The debate was-Resolved, "That
municipial government should be non-partisan"-H.
C. Rimmer first spoke
and with Ciceronian oratory made the
audiance think that politics shouldn't
enter into our icity government
However, M. W. Ervin arose and
with Demosthenean eloquence convin
ced the same audience that politics
should enter municipial government.
Whether this immediate change of
sentiment in the audiance should be
attributed to their own flexible minds,
or the convincing argument of the
speakers, it is hard to determine.
However, it is a fact that our govern
ment remained unchanged the next
morning. Mr. E. B. Beuley's oration
on the "Coming Century" showed
tact in its preparation and oratory in
its delivery. W. C. Harriott, as usual
gave an able oration, his subject being
"Drudgery." Mr. Harriott showed
that "Drudgery" was one of the ele
ments of success.
The last and most amusing feature
of the program was the reading of the
Alpha Sigma Advance by editor S. T.
Miser. Mr. Miser with his clear, dis
tinct and forcible voice displayed
much vit and Wisdom" and every
one present realized that Sam is a
coming editor. A large audiance was
present at .Jhe entertainment and by
their cose attention and good behav
ior showed their interest in the work
of the Alpha Sigma Society.
The holidays will soon be here
again. Many of the students wilj
have the pleasant opportunity of spend,
ing Xmas at home.
This term has been one of the best
in the history of our College. The
attendance has been good and the
work has been efficient. It makes us
very sad however to think of the fact
that two of our best students have
been called away from our school
since last fall never more to return.
Maryville College students have in
the main, been greatly blessed with
health and many other blessings.
S. 0. Houston and J. W. Ritchie
went to Knoxvilie Saturday on busi
ness. The Sprayer meeting on Tuesday
evening was led by Prof. F. M. Gill.
The subject was the "Titles of Christ."
Many of the titles of Christ were
presented and ably commented on.
