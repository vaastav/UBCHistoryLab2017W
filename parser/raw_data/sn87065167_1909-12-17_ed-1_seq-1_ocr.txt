(By Associated Press.)
Managua, Nicaragua, Dec. 17.—Pres
ident Zelaya has cabled a conciliatory
message to President Taft.
In the message Zelaya said he had
shown his faith by resigning in order
that Nicaragua might resume friendly
relations with the United States.
He added that he proposed to leave
the country, but stood ready t<^ ac
count for his acts as president.
ZELAYA'S RESIGNATION
SENT TO CONGRESS.
Managua. Nicaragua, Dec. 17.—.lose
Santo Zelaya has resigned from the
presidency of Nicaragua. He placed
his resignation in the hands of Con
gress yesterday.
Apparently there was no other
course for him to take. The people
were at last aroused. The guns of
the revolutionists threatened. The
warships of the United States lay in
Nicaraguan ports. Manague has been
seething for days. The spirit of re
volt has spread even to the gates of
the palace.
Zelaya surrounded himself with an
armed 'guard. Unchecked the popu

Who will take up the reins? No
one knows or cares. It is said that
Zelaya as dictator will be known no
more. There is no doubt that Con
gress will act quickly on his resigna

Dr. Jose Madriz, judge of the Cen

and is now his choice for president,

Columbus, Ga., Dec. 17.—Four per

NOT A CANDIDATE
FOR CITY MARSHAL
Mr. John F. Bennett States Positively
That He Will Not Enter the
Race for That Office.
Some time ago, in giving the names
of possible prospective candidates for
various municipal offices, The News
stated that friends of Mr. John F.
Bennett, the present city tax colh.:
tor, would ask him to enter the race
for chief of police.
Mr. Bennett stated this morning
that, while the subject has been men
tioned to him by different individuals,
he had never seriously contemplated
running for the office, and that he pos
itively would not become a candidate
for the place.
Chief of Police Williams has an
nounced to his friends that he would
offer for re-election, and it is thought
probable that Policp Officer B. O. Do
herty will be his opponent, as it is
known that a number of his friends
have insisted that he enter the race.
Mr. Doherty has not as yet, however,
made positive announcement of his
intentions in the matter.

IN SELLING LANDS
GRANTED DY STATE
Says Road's Claim That It Now Owes
State Nothing Is Example of In
gratitude Unparalleled Since Days
of Judas Iscariot.
(By Associated Press.)
Springfield. 111., Dec. 17.—Attorney
General Stead began his argument
here today before the state supremo
court in the case which the state of
Illinois has brought against the Illi
nois Central ^feilroad to recover ap
proximately $20,000,000. He said that
the state in 1851 chartered the Illi
nois Central railway, granting the
road at the same time between 2,000,
000 and 3,000,000 acres of land as
right of way, and to aid the road in
its construction. The attorney gen
eral, claims that these lands were
sold by the road for $30,000,000, more
than sufficient to build the road.
Ingratitude Unparalleled.
The claim now made by the Illinois
Central, said Attorney General Stead,
that it owes the state nothing be
cause of this land grant, is an exam
ple of ingratitude that has no parallel
since the time of Judas Iscariot.
Attorney General Stead said the
state made a contract with the road,
and that an accounting
made each year until 1877. when the
road began to "forget'' to send ac
counts to the state.

From End to End.
(By Associated Press.)
Ottawa, Ontario, Dec. 17.—"Captain
Loose confessed that his story pub

a lie from beginning to end. We hope
to have his confession sworn to in a
few days."
This is the substance of a statement
made in a letter received here by Cap
tain Bernier, commander of the Cana
dian explorer steamer Arctic. The let
ter to Captain Bernier is from Cap
tain Osbon, of New York, secretary of
the Arctic Club, of which the Cana
dian explorer is a member.
It was Captain Bernier who received
the first letter from Dr. Cook after
his dash to the pole, announcing the
success of the journey.

FORTUNE TELLERS

'Palmistry'' Game Will Not Work

as the privilege tax is charged for

is an art, and not fortune telling, and
