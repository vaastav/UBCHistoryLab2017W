MICHIGAN MATTERS.
For the Protection of Gam.
Daring the session just passed two deer
hunters, who went to Munising from the
lower part of the state, killed 264 deer
Within ninety days. The saddles, which
are worth on the average, 5 each, were
shipped out of the state. The hunters
subsisted almost entirely on the meat they
killed and their only outlay was for am
munition. Their net profit was therefore
nearly $1,400. Other pot hunters at other
point have done the same, and in conse
quence game in the Upper l'eniusula of
Michigan is growing scarce. There is a
law to preveut shipping deer out of the
state, but it is not euforced. There is also
a law to restrain hunters from killing deer
in the water with a light, but it also is
practically inoperative.
Bo great has been the slaughter of deer
in tho only parts of the state where they
exist iu any numbers that the leg
islature will be asked this winter
to enact still more stringent laws,
which will ln anforced bv the local sports
men's and game associations which have
been formed recently in nearly all the cit
ies in this part of the state. The statute
asked tor will be to prevent the shipment
of game out of the upper peninsula. Ihe
S resent law prohibiting the shipment or
eer out of the state can be easily evaded.
It is very easy to ship a deer to some point
in the state near the Ohio line, then reship
it to any part of the country desirea.
Wholesale slaughter in the herds of deer
that roam throueh parts of the upper pe
ninsula has been no greates than the havoo
made among the finny residents of the
mall rivers and creeks. Brook trout have
been taken with nets and shipped away
by the ton. Unless a stop is put to this the
hunting and fishing grounds of the upper
peninsula will soon exist ouiy in me mem
ory of the past.

Congressman Prico Dead.
Congressman W. T. Price died in Black
River Falls, Wis., on the 0th inst., after a
long and protracted illness, of cancer of
the stomach.
W. T. Price was born in Huntingdon
county, Pa., June 17, 1824. Emigrating to
Wisconsin he engaged -in the lumber busi
ness and at the same time conducted an
extensive farm. Ho entered actively into
political life. He was a member of the

ninth congress, of which he was a member
tt the time ot his death.
The National Banks.
Hon.- John Sherman says that he Is In
favor of letting the national banks do
business upon the 4 f per cent bonds now
outstanding, but would allow them circu
lation upon the face value of the bonds.
This would increase the circulation about
$30,000,000. He would issue circulation up
to the market valuo of the bonds and have
that value fixed once a year. He would
reduce the bank tax to one-half of 1 per
cent. Ho did not favor a 2 per cent per
petual bond. He favored reducing revenue
by making sugar free (giving bounties for
Louisiana sugar) and lowering the tobacco
tax one half.

a circular to magistrates, in which he says
that his attention has been called to the
increasing number of cases in which Touch

ries in Turkey are faring better; extradi
tion demands attention; international
copyright and free importation of art
works are favored; the consular service
needs reform. '

house that tho senate was in session and
was ready to hear the president's message.
Me-srs. Edmunds and Salsbury were desig
nated to perform this duty. Senator
Williams' credentials were presented and
ho was sworn in. Some bills and petitions
were introduced when a reco-s was taken
until the two houses met in joint session
to list- o -he reading of the messae.
DKCF.Mr.rn 7 In the senate Mr. Beck In
troduced a bill to provide for the retire
ment of United Stati-s legal tender and
national brink notes of small denomina
tions and for the issue of coin certificates.
Mr. Morril offered a resolutiou declaring
it expedient and detrimental to the reviv
al of the trade uud industry of the coun
try for the present congress to mal.e any
further attempts at revision of the tariff,
and Mr. Ingalis introduced au amendment
to the pension laws. Out of respect to the
members who have died since the adjourn
ment of the lost session, the senate ad
journed. A number of bills were introduced in
the house ;and tho bill appropriating $20-,
I0J for a permanent school for cavalry
and artillery Instruction at Fort Riley,
Kan., was passed.
The electoral count bill was taken up and
after remarks by Mr. Caldwell the nou&e
adjourned at 2:0.
December 8 A draft of a bill for the is
sue of subsidiary silver coin was laid bo
fore tho house, An effort was made to
have a bill passed to admit free of duty
material to be used in rebuilding East
port. Maine, but the matter was laid over.
The house passed a bill amending the act
"For tho muster and pay of certain offi
cers and enlisted men of the volunteer
forces,' so as to provide that in oil cases
arising under the same any person who
was duly appointed and commissioned,
whether his commission was actually re
ceived by him or not, shall be considered
as commissioned to the grade therein
named, amount date from which he was
to take rank under and by the terms of
his said commission, and shall be entitled
to all pay and emoluments as if actually
mustered at that date. Some time was
spent in the discussion of the electoral
count bill and the bouse adjourned.
The senate devoted its time to-day to
the discussion of the question of marriage
and divorce and woman suffrage. Among
other bills introduced was one providing
for the erection of a monument to the Ne-
f:ro soldiers and sailors who gave their
ives for the preservation of the union.
After discussing the fisheries question for
some time tho senate adjournod.
Decemiier 0 The house devoted nearly
all the time to-day to tho discussion of the
electoral count bill, which measure was
finally passed with but one amendment,
and now goes back to the senate for con
currence. The bill giving free delivery
service to cities having a population of
lii.uuuor more was also passed. Jn com
mittee of the whole the bill cre
ating a department of agriculture and
labor was)discussed at considerable length,
and the house adjourned.
The time of the senate was mainly oc
cupied with the consideration of Mr. Mor
rill's resolution declaring it inexpedient
and detrimental to the revival of the trade
and industry of the country for tho pres
eut congress to make any further attempts
at revision of the tariff. At the close of
the dtbate the senate adjourned until
Monday.
The Decision Against Ker
The United States supreme court has
rendered a decision in the case of Freder
ick M. Kcr against the people of the state
of Illinois, brought beforo that tribunal by
a writ of error from the supreme court of
Illinois, sustaining thedecislon of the crim
inal court of Cook county against the pris
oner, is affirmed. The court suggests that
Ker might have an action against Julian
for trespass and false imprisonment. The
cne was brought to test the legality of
the extradition of Ker, who was seized in
Peru, whither he bad fled after embezzling
a largo sum belonging to the firm of Pros
ton, Kean & Co. of Chicago, while acting
as confidential clerk for the firm.
Tery Bomantio.
The Canadian Interior department have
been asked to look up the identity of Big
Bear's wife. It is claimed that she is a
white woman. A quarter of a century
ago Harriet Montgomery, a child, sudden
ly disappeared from her homo in Dundas,
Ont., and no clue to her whereabouts has
been found until recently, when relatives
of Harriet Montgomery communicated
with the interior department on this sub
ject, and officials of that department are
making inquiries. Col. MacDonald says
that Big Bear's wives are full blooded
squaws, and that the relatives of the girl
have struck tho wrong trail.
Brothers to be Benumeratei.
The Quartermaster-General of the army,
acting under the provisions of a bill passed
on the motion of Representative O'Neil of
Missouri, at the last session of congress,
has examined the claim of the Christian
Brothers' College of St. Louis, for occupa
tion of its building: by United States troops
during the war, and has certified to the
secretary or the treasury that the college
is entitled to $15,000. This is somewhat of
a new departure in the mode of payment
of similar claims, a specific appropriation
by congress being generally required.
Shot the Father.
A case of murder has presented itself to
the people of Henderson, Shiawasse coun
ty. Thomas Morrison, upon learning that
the teacher, Fred Joslyn of the school near
there, had been punishing his son pretty
severely, started to the school house to
see if it was true. He entered the school
room and, walking up to Jodyn, told him
he was about to give him the same treat
ment, whereupon Joslyn drew his revolv
er and shot Morrison dead. Joslyn claims
tear ne acica in eii-dcrenea.
Track Walkers Killed.
Bridget McCarthy and John Toole, who
were walking on the Pennsylvania track
near Braddock, Pa., were struck and killed
by the fast express. Barbara Conway and
Festus Cook were also struck, bat escaped
with slight injuries
What Hazon Wants.
Gen. Ha ten asks for the transfer of the
10 second lieutenants now in the signal
corps to the line of the armyt with the
respective dates of their commissions, as
vacancies occur, and also asks that the
president t hall be authorized to detail 20
officers from the army as acting signal
officers, who, when so detailed and in
structed, shall not be relieved from signal
duty except for unfitness or other sutll
cieut cause. In this way he thinks a good
signal sorvico can be obtained.

A Walk of 300 Miles.
The schooner Sylvester Neolon, which
sailed from Chicago for Collingwood a
month ago and was thought to have gone
down with all on board, has been heard
from. Her owners have received word
that tho crew wero ot Owen Sound, hav
ing abandoned the ves.-el at Tobermory,
on Great Manitouliu island, and walked
!HJ miles through a rough country to Owen
Sound. Tho Neelon was valued at $10,tOJ.
Twenty-Seven Men Perish.
Two life boats which put out from South
port, Eng., the other day were wrecked,
and it 1 believed that twenty-seven per
sons were drowned. The survivors of one
of the life-boat crews say that instead of
righting herself the boat remained bottom
upwards and that five of their number
were underneath it for an hour in water
only kneo deep. Threo of them were suf
focated; tho two others wero rescued.
A Woman Blamed for It.
A contractor named George N. Walker,
a brother of Maj. Wulker, lute chief of po
lice, shot and dangerously wounded John
C. Miller, n well-known stenographer and
patent attorney, on F street in Washing
ton the other afternoon. Miller grappled
with his assailant after being shot aud a
terrific struggle ensued. Walker's wife
appears to have been ut tho bottom of the
trouble between them.
. A Niue-llour Day.
Kenny Emerch of NewYork, general
secretary of the carpenter's union, at a
meeting'of tho local union recently, urged
th nu n to stand by their organization as
a demand for a nine hour day will bo
innde January 1st. uud employes will bo
given to April 1st to decide. If the de
mand is refused, a general strike all over
the union will follow. All other unions
ure expected, to follow in this demand.
Trouble ia Ireland.
It Is stated that in consequence of the
decision arrived at by the English cabinet
council to suppress intimidating meetings
in Ireland, the Irishexocutive at the castle
is preparing for a determined struggle
agair.st the national league. Tho execu
tive procedure w ill involve proclamations,
arrets and probably the seizure of the
newspapers in Ireland.
Returning to Europe.
One hundred foreigners, mainly Ger
mans, wero waiting at the depot in Pitts
burg tho other day, returning to Europe
from their homes in the west. They said
they had been to St. Paul, Minneapolis aud
other points in Minuesota, but did not
prosper. They think there has been too
much immigration of persons without
capital.

NATURAL GAS.
IIovV It Is Accumulated and Htored
Tho safety Valve nt lite (Jlobe.
Dr. II. W. Faucet t, of Neosho, Mo.,
who has for many ycari U eti deeply in
terested in natural gas, Its origin, ami
results, and who has made experiments
and investigations in tho oil regions of
Pennsylvania, h at the Hotel Moser.
Ho talks very entertainingly and in
fetniclivcly upon tliu subject that proba
bly occupies a major portion of his
thoughts ami shows that lio has given it
much careful research.
Science tells us," said ho yesterday,
'that tho central portion of this globe
is a molten mass of heat, if no it must
necessarily be an incandescent or electri
cal heat, burning in vacuo without oxv
gen henco no combustion. Admitting
tliis to bo the case ami considering that
at least two-thirds of the globe's surface
is covered with water, tuero must bo
an immense quantity of that liquid
gradually working its way by gravity
through tho crust of the earth and com
ing in contact with this great heat, tho
natural result of which is thr.t immense
quantities of hydrogen gas are liberated
from tho water, and, it being very vol
atile and expansive, iinds its" way
through to tho many cavities and cav
erns iu the earth's crust, which aro, as
it were, nature's gasometers on an im
mense scale, and there accumulated
and stored unt'l under that immense
pressure it must liml vent, and in doing
o it is constantly coming in contact
with sulphurous gases, which are also
generated bv the internal heat, and be
comes a hydro-sulphurous acid gas. In
other instances it comes in contact with
organic or carboniferous matter; each
having an enmity for tho other it be
comes a hydrocarbon gas and burns a
white llame, while in the original state,
or a sulphurous acid gas, it burns a yel
lowish and blue llame. These gases iind
an outlet through ami between tho dif
ferent strata formation of the earth's
crust and in doing so under that intense
or inconceivable pressuro and expan
sive force with great velocity cause 1 ho
waves or undulations called earthquakes
ami tho escape of these gases aro what
are generally noticed in the odor of sul
phur at the occurrence of these undula
tions or waves Vesuvius. JCtna, and
oilier volcanoes aro tho safety-valves of
I his globe, and when the crater or out
let of any one of these cools or closes
these gases have to seek other outlets,
ami generally do so where tho crust
may bo the thinnest, or lind their way
between the different strata to where
tiiev may outcrop, frequently under the
bed of tho ocean. Tho large quantity
of dead fish si'en floating on the surface
at times are evidence of those results,
either from sulphurous acid gas or. cou
cuvsion. Tho tidal wave that oecnrred
on the .west coast of South America a
few years since was the re-ult of an out
break under the ocean.
'Wliat other results have you no
ticed?" There aro many different results pro
duced by the overpressure of gases;
ranges of mountains are thrown up,
continents and islands are formed and
sunk, lake aud inland seas aro formed
bv depressions. With our contracted
ideas we can scarcely conceive the
magn'tudc of the work going on in na
ture's laboratory, and only when such
occurrences as the undulations or
waves that have recently taken place
at Charleston and vicinity do wo con
sider their forcj or magnitude."
What's tho nature of these gases?"
They aro the most volatile and ex
pansive substmeo kuown and under tho
nnmenso pressure they .ire subjected
to are permeating and escaping from
the earth's surface at all times yet they
aro not noticed except in extreme low
temperatures or wliero Ihev may es
caps through still water. The spas
modic How of the geysers at Yellow
stone are identical with the regular
spasmodic llow of the petroleum wells
in some instances, and both arc caused
by the accumulated head of pressure
of gas b.'hind the liquid. There is noth
ing novel in the use of tho gases for
fuel or illuminating purposes. I and
others generated steam in our boilers
and lighted and heated our offices and
buildings with it over twenty years
since in tho Pennsylvania oil region."
'How do you account for the stor
age of these gases in certain places?"
There are no geological theories by
which the storages of these gases can
be located or delincd. The underlying
strata or formation of tho whole area
or buiii, from the breaks on the west
base of tho Apalacliian range to tho
Rocky range lying horizontally and
being unbroken or undisturbed, confine
tho gas, aud only through connecting
crevice's or at tho outcropping oan it
lind An outlet iu quantities. Every
city and town within that area can as
well bu suppl ed with natural gas from
nature's gasometers at far less cost for
plant and product than erecting works to
manufacture from coal or other substan
ces. There arc surfaco indications in
the outcroppings of gas on the water
springs as is the case on the Muskingum
river, in Ohio, on the Kanawha in West
Virginia, and in the Choctaw and
Chickasaw nations in Indian Territory.
Tho Indians valuo these oil and gas
springs for their medical properties, and
light their camps by inserting a lube or
gun-barrel in tho earth."
"Hut would not tho supply soon be
come exaustcd?''
'As to the permanancy of the supply
of these gases there can be no doubt,
but in cases whero tho outlet is In ex
cess of tho accumulations tho head or
pressure must necessarily decreas. Hv
proper management experience wijl
soon demonstrate tho supply of any
given outlet without decreasing tho
pressure. Whero crevices or cavities
may bo struck in drilling wells that lead
to large caverns or storage places for
gas the supply will bo In proportion to
tho accumulations, ami tiie escape
should bo regulated accordingly. In
many instances in the Pennsylvania oil
fields crevices have beo;i struck that
havo afforded many millions of cubic
feet of gas daily, escaping under a pres
sure of JJ00 to 400 pounds to tho inch
through tho usual 5j casing, and suffi
cient lo light any city on thecont'nent
Petroleum has its origin in deposits
of organic matter of a marino growth
of fatty vegetation, while natural gas is
a separate and distinct formation, being
accumulations as abovo stated." St.
Louis Ikpublican.

"How's prohibition out here?" asked
an Eastern clergyman of a rural lowan.
Prohibition bo hanged! Tliero Isn't

Mv friend, do you think that's
right?"
"No, of course I don t,"
"I'm heartily glad to hear you saj
so, my friend."
"No, wo ought to get too drinks for
that nioaey."--77c-rif.
