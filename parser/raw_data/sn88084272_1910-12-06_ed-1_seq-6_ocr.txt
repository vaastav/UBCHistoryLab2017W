Peace, Blessed Peace
FINAL paragraphs of president Taft's 40,000 word" message contain the declara
tions for which the business world has teen waiting. From the position
which the real meaty part of the message occupies, it looks as if the president
had given these matters the most careful and longest consideration. The pith of
the message is what thS president has to say about the interstate commerce law
and the anti-trust law. He says that there has been no time to test the effect of
the interstate commerce amendments made by the last congress. Three points
that the president formerly recommended were not covered, in the amended law,
but; says the president in his message: "I do not press the consideration of any
of these objects on congress at this session." '
Only a very few amendments to the interstate commerce law are recommended,
and none are likely to cause bitter contention. No change whatever is suggested
in the anti-trust law. "Rather," says the president, "let us stop for awhile and
witness the effect of the vigorous execution, of the laws on the statute books."
In addition to enforcing existing laws, the president believes that the activities
of government should be directed for the present to economy of administration,
enlargement of opportunities for foreign trade, building up heme industries, and
strengthening the confidence of capital in domestic investments.
The whole message is a conservative, restrained pronouncement. In fact it is
exceedingly dull, both in a literary sense and in a political sense. There are no
preachments, nobody is called a liar or a scoundrel ,no phrases are coined for the
use of future makers of -quotation dictionaries, and the whole message is just
about as sensational as the annual report of the street commissioner. Yet, after
all, a careful reading will disclose a number of significant recommendations, just
" the sort that might be expected to come from a man of president Taft's training
and disposition. j
Of the new suggestions put forward, the most notable is that to extend the
classified civil service to all postmasters, including first, second, third and fourth
class. This would, remove at one sweep the greatest number fbf politcal appointive
government positions ever snatched away from hungry politicians at one time.
It is altogether likely that congress will pay no attention whatever to this part
of the message; the recommendation is so essentially conservative, rational, and
right that it becomes radical, almost revolutionary, in the eyes at least of those
who have had a .hand in distributing the patronage.
The president strongly recommends the 'simplifying of judicial procedure
and suggests that the supreme court under special authority from congress make a
thorough revision in the rules of procedure with a view to expediting the work
of the courts. The president recommends also that the supreme court be relieved
of much -unnecessary appellate consideration, which the courts below might just as
well dispose of. The president renews his recommendation that the issuance of
injunctions be regulated by law, in order to prevent radical legislation proposed
by some agitators ana in-order to avoid the dangers of "that cruel social, instru
ment, the secondary boycot."
The recommendation for an increase in the salaries of federal judges is accom
panied hy'a comment which bears significantly, upon the probable fate of the
Arizona ' constitution when dt goes before the president. Says president Taf t,
"Next to life tenure of judges, an adequate salary is the most material contribution
to the maintenance of independence on the part of our judges." Expressing else
where his preference for life tenure, it does not seem as if the proposition to
"recall" judges by popular vote at any time during their term is likely to appeal
yery strongly to the president.
The recommendation for national incorporation of interstate commercial and
industrial organizations is renewed. "Possibly next to the president's pronounce
ment upon the interstate -commerce and anti-trust questions, his views on the tariff
will attract the most attention among business men. He strongly recommends a
permanent tariff1 commission to correspond with the strictly business organizations
in foreign countries that have charge of 'tariff revision. He urges that only one
schedule at a time be taken up for revision, and that only after careful investiga
tion and report by the -permanent tariff commission. The present tariff and the
corporation tax are declared to be most successful income producers.
A leasing system for coal, oil, and gas lands is approved, also for water power
sites. The president stVongly -urges legislation at the short session .with a view
to putting into practice some of the more important conservation plans that have
been thoroughly thrashed over. The recommendation for specific conservation
legislation is one of the very few pointed! suggestions put forward for the work
of the short session. The president approves the secretary of the interior's sug
gestion that land litigants, take their appeals to th,e courts instead of having to
rest their cases with the land office and the secretary.
Much space is devoted to foreign relations. "Generally speaking, our relations
with foreign countries are declared to be in every way satisfactory. The United
States will direct China's monetary reform. The course of the United States in
Central and South American matters is explained.
There is no reference to the Rodriguez incident or to the Mexican insurrection.
The only references to Mexico relate to the centennial and the cordial reception
by Mexico of American delegates, and to the prospective settlement of the El Paso
boundary dispute. However, bile there is no direct mention of the Rodriguez
incident, the president makes a very strong recommendation for federal legislation
to enable ithe national government to protect aliens in their political and treaty
rights and safeguard their lives and property, even though state governments may
firid local mobs uncontrolable and may be indisposed to protect foreigners and
prosecute those who violate the treaty rights of foreigners.
The president recommends the establishing of a bureau of health and expressly
denies that any spatial school of medicine would' be favored through such an
establishment. '
Only twice does the president refer to "my predecessor," once in reference
to certain investigations that president Roosevelt carried on as to coal land
leases in British colonies, and once in connection with the payment to the Southern
Pacific of the claim arising out of the successful fight against the encroachments
of the Colorado river, when president Roosevelt personally solicited aid from the
Southern Pacific and personally promised that he would do what he could to get
the government to reimburse the railroad. This is a just and honorable debt,
and it will be a national scandal if it is not quickly discharged.
In his message the president discloses himself as a most cautious writer. He
has several times proved himself to be vigorous as a constructive statesman and
as a pacificator. He would much rather act, than write about what he intends
to do, and his careful and deliberate, if ponderous, message as chief executive
ought to have the effect of quieting down a lot of the senseless agitation and
smoothing the. way for continued national progress along rational lines in a spirit
of optimism amply justified by the facts of the situation. Without trying for
effect, the president has demonstrated his fitness for the job at this period in the
national life. "

THE FLIGHT
By Hans AVeber.
ELIZABETH had been longing to get
away from Taris and this after
noon they were to leave.
Gerard had not been able to under
stand why she felt so uneasy whenev
er they were outside the walls of the
hotel, but when she had told him the
reason the day before, he had first tried
to calm her, but finally he had given it
up and promised her to leave and now
she was busy packing her trunks.
,She was thinking of the months she
had spent In Paris, a city she had
quickly learned to love, nay. which she
had really loved since she visited It the
first time with her father while she,
was still very young. Now she and
Gerard had spent their honeymoon
as she had always dreamed of doing,
and their Intention had been to stay for
at least another month until the mid
dle of June.
Tired with the effort of packing, she
had sat down to rest near an open win
dow overlooking a narrow street on
the left bank of the Seine in which the
hotel was situated. The roise and bus
tle of the crowd, the shouts of the ped
la'rs reached her ears as from a far
off world while she sat thinking of the
many happy hours she and Gerard had
spent here together until the day when
the shadow first fell across her path.
That day, a beautiful day In May, she
and her husband had walked along the
Boulevard des Capuclnes watching the
passing automobiles to choose one for
a ride through the Bois de Boulogne.
They stopped several, but all of them
asked exorbitant prices, and at last
they had to be satisfied wich an old
taxicab, but still they felt like princes
as they drove through the Avenue des
Champs Elysees, though all other autos
passed them as if they were standing
still and even aid cab horses seemed
to make fun of them. They drove all
through the Bois, however, and on thel
way back they i got out at Place de
l'Etoile and mounted lo the top of the
arc de triomphe to enjoy the view of
Paris.
Suddenly, white they, were standing
there, looking towards Louvre, Ehza-
3 beth felt somebody staring at her. 'She

gentleman in a grey suit standing at
the door leading to the stairway. She
thought she saw a sarcastic smile about
his lips. She had recognized him imme
diately and the memory came back to
her of her early youth wr.en she had
been madly in love with him long be
fore she met her husband. After the
death of her mother sne had spent some
time with friends in a provincial town
and here she had accidentally met this
man, who had made a strong impres- l
sion upon her. During their long walk
through the woods her love had grown,
but it did not take long to discover
he was merely experimenting with her,
because it amused him to see the power I
he exerted ovr Her mind. When she re- i
alized his heartlessness and broke with
him, she. fell Into a nervous fever, and
when she got over ft she returned to
Berlin and heard nothing of him until
she now unexpectedly met him again.
looking the same as then, though his J
dark hair was now beginning to turnva
little gray. A feeling of 'dizziness and
fear" overcame her and it was only by
exerting all her strength that she could
seize Gerard's arm and whisper: "Let
us go down, Gerard. I do not feel quite
well."
"But what is the matter, dear?"

J And. "Glu-glug. burble, burra
boo," laughed the baby. .
She was an 'enchanting baby and had
held the attention of most of the pas
sengers during the journey.
She had, poked a -small pink finger
into the eye of a fussy old gentleman
in the next seat and he, after first
looking deeply outraged, had ended by
returning the courtesy and playfully
poking her fat little neck.
She had beat a strenuovs tattoo on
the newspaper of the young man -behind
her and he, after blushing furi
ously at the shameless young woman s
advances, had smiled kindly on her.
A comfortable looking woman who
looked as though she might be the
mother of eight, beamed on her from
across the aisle.
A sad-looking woman gazed at ner
longingly, then turned toward the win
dow and I could see that her eyes were
blurred with tears.
The whole car belonged to the baby.
She had laughed and crowed and gur
gled her way Into the heart of every
man, woman and child in it.
The young mother looked proud and
pleased, as she had every right to be.
The baby was sweet and wholesome,
and it was hers, her very own, to cud
dle and kiss and dream over.
On Fifth avenue, a few days later,
I saw a well-dressed young woman
step into a motor and in her arms she
carried an elaborately dressed doll.
"Must belong to her little girl," I
murmured. "Not at all," said the
friend with whom I was walking. "It
belongs to herself and you see dozens
of other women doing the same thing."
"Isn't It contemptible? Itsf bad
enough to fuss and pet a- dog, but the
dog is at least alive. What are the
women coming to?"
The little girl who lives her dolls
is getting ready to love her real babies
when they come along in their own

of 'these walks a man ame towards
them on the narrow path. It was he.
She felt him. stare straight in her face,
and she turned pale as a ghost. Her
legs trembled so that she could hardly
walk. When he had passed she sat
down on a bench. Gerard, who was
busy studying a pocket map of the
woods, had not noticed her confusion.
From that day she felt Instinctively
that the man was trying to brings her
under his old influence and she asked
Gerard to leave and though it puzzled
him why she was so anxious to get
away from the city, he knew she loved,
he had asked no questions. When they
were first engaged she had hinted at

yesterday when they came back to the
hotel 'and the waiter handed her a card
and said a gentleman had been asking
for her and would return, she broke
down. When they reached their room
she threw her arms around her hus
band's neclc and confessed overytbing,
her nervousness and the feeling that he
possessed a strange power vor her,
which she could not resist. Why had
he followed her to this little hotel in
the Latin quarter? What did he want
from her? She thought of Gerard's
loving tenderness, of his attempts to
cheer her up, but she felt relieved only
when he promised her they would leave
at once. If she could only get away
before he returned. She would not lis
ten to Gerard's suggestion tnat tney
should stay and that he would see the f
man alone, when he called. Now every-
thing was packed and In an hour the
cab would call for them.
On the way to the Northern railroad
station their cab was stopped by a
crowd that had gathered on the corner
of Rue du Pont Neuf. There had evi-
l dently been some accident. A large j
motor bus was standing in the center ,
of the crowd. Gerard left the cab to j
see if there was any way to pas's by.
Elizabeth did not want him to leave her

would have to wait. A man had been
run over by a bus and the wheels had
crushed his chest. An ambulance came

stopped P.iCng side their cab. Four men
carried the lifeless body. Elizabeth
gave a cry of horror she, had recog

whom she was running away. Half an
hour later, when they were sitting in
their comnartment. -she whispered to
Gerardt who held her hand:
"Do you think he was on his wav to

Beginning- of the Movement.
The first direct movement for the es

the work which the Red Cross assumes

1S63, but the idea may be said to have

fell in the struggle with the Russians.

organized at the opening of the Civil
testimony from the United States, set-

the new organization.
First Americas Society.
The first American Red Cross society
was founded a year after the close of
the Civil war and was known as the
American Association for the Relief of
Miseries of Battlefields, and it was
about the same time that Clara Barton

Nor can any man fall in love to

How One Man Expressed It.
In speaking of such a case a man
said not long ago to me: "I have
never worked as hard at anything in
my life as I have at trying to fall in
love with- Sally. She is everything in
the world that comes up to my ideal

domestic,
entertaining and
charming. I enjoy her society, but to
.save my life I can't get up one throw
of sentiment over her.
"Is it not ghastly to think how much
the sport of fate we are in such mat
ters? I cannot love this croori woman
that I' so admire, and yet the chances !
are that some day I shall go crazy
over some weak, vain little fool, and
marry her, and she will make me mis
erable ever after. But I am helpless to,
love, as I shall' be powerless to keep
keep from loving when I 'meet the One
Woman."
It Is one of the most pathetic things f
in life tha.t we cannot win love, nor j
recall it when we have lost it, any !
more than we could a wilding bird,
that has - escaped from our hand.

with more home comforts to turn 'him I
once more into the lover.
Affection Xot to be Compelled.
Vain. hope. The' flre is out on the
altar a-nd you cannot kindle into flame
the dead ashes. When the illusive
unn.tiiins mat atiracrea a man to a
woman Is gone from her for him it is
like a lost perfume, or the efferves
cence of a Ijottle of champagne You
cannot resist it. Probably nay doubt
less In most cases" the man regret3
the lost attraction just as much and as
bitterly as the woman does. It is as
great a tragedy to the man to cease
to love the woman he has chosen as it
Is to her to cease to be loved, but h,e
cannot compel his affection, nor force
himself to thrill because it is his dutv
to thrill at his wife's kiss.
Therefore, with sorrow I say to my
correspondent, that there is no known
system by which she can break the
bank of love. It is a game that has
no rules, under which precedents do
not count. It Is the greatest gamble
on earth, which is the reason thaOnen
and women never tire of staking their
all upon it. , i

A DIFFERENT VIEW.
Anthony, N. M Dec 4.
EditoirEl Paso Herald:.
Having lived six "years in Mexico,
among the midale class and despised
peqhs. I know conditions in that un
happy land pretty welL All appear
ances point to the conclusion that the
anti-American riots were inspired by
the Diaz government, and not by the
revolutionists. That party could have
nothing to gain by such tactics, for
its leaders know that the majority of
workingmen from the States who are
in Mexico are insympathy with t-hem,.
and they also wjsh to avoid giving the
United States government cause for in
tervention. Nine-tenths of the intelligent middle
class Mexicans are ready for revolt,
whenever they -think there is any
chance of success. ' It is only the "stu
pidityof the low, ignorant" class that
upholds such a government- iaz
knows this and purposely keeps the
masses ground down in ignorance and
poverty, till they have not enough,
spirit to throw off the yoke of tyran
ny that is crushing them,
The only people in Mexico who, a
a class, have any real grudge against
the Americans, are the employers of
labor. They despise the gringoes for
paying better wages than they have
been paying their peons. That causes
discontent among Mexican employers'
slaves and many leave their former
masters and go to work on the ranches
and In the mines of the foreigners.
Those are the people .who love to hear
a crowd of drunken peons shouting,
"Muerte a los gringoes."
Anyone who has lived any length
of time in Mexico (among the people,
I mean, not in some first class hotel,
or as a guest of some government offi
cial) knows that when a crowd of"
peons get drunk they can easily be led
to give any "gritc"desis:ing persons
might desire them to. Thy( must have
some excitement and- if nothing else
offers, often fall to carving up one
another. "
It is to the Interest of the Diaz
regime to prejudice the American peo
ple against the popular uprising in
favor of the rightsv of man, and if pos
sible to get the United States govern
ment to help hunt down the. victims of
Diaz's tyranny. May Madero prove to
be a second Hidalgo.

El, PASO.VXS I.IVE ONES.
From Las Cruces IN. M.) Citizen.
El Paso is soon to have another wire
less telegraph station, which is grati
fying. It hasnt been but a short time
sirce the Pass City had a tower, but
the company became afflicted with cold
feetis and drifted out of the burg
whose people couldn't be inveigled into
buying something that hadn't been
there long enough to demonstrate its
worth and their faith to deliver the
goods. El Pasoans are, true blue when
it comes to helping enterprises that
will aid in the upbuildintr of their city,
'but they believe in the Missourian creed
and must "be shown " '
