BOYCOTTED BY BREWERS.
A Chicago Firm Instructs It3 Brokers to Re-'
fuse to Buy Iowa and Kansas Barley.
Chicago, Dee. 17. Considerable stir has been
caused here by the fact leaking out that the
Keeley Brewing Company bad Instructed its
brokers to bay do barley grown in or shipped
from the States of Iowa or Kansas. The in
strnctions to the broker read as follows:
"When purchasing barley for our account,
you must nave a guarantee from the seller that
the barlev was not grown in either the States of
Iowa or Kansas, or shipped from any ttfwn in
either of those States."
John P. Taylor, secretary of the Keeley com
pany, is quoted to-day as saying: "No, it is cot
an attempt to punish those States for their pro
hibition principles, but if they won't buy our
beer, it is quite proper that we should not buy
their barley, isn t it?"
Mr. Taylor said he issued the order because he
thought the Minnesota and Wisconsin barley
was better than the Iowa and Kansas barley, and
because, he added, 'there is no need of our buy
ing from them if we can get as good or better
somewhere else."
At other breweries it was said the matter, up
to the present time, concerned only the Keeley
company. Louis Hueck, the millionaire malt
ster, said the deliberations of the Brewers' As
sociations were held in secret. If there were
such a movement as intimated he wonld join it
heart and soul. The f aimers of Iowa were hypo
crites, he declared, pretending to believe in pro
hibition and raising barley for the manufacture
of whisky and beer.
LABOR INTERESTS.
Beading Railway Employee Decide to Stand
by the Lehigh Strikers.
Elizabethport, N. J., Deo. IS. A conven
tion of Beading railroad employes began here to
day. There are three hundred delegates pres
ent from local assemblies of the Knights of La
bor on all branches of the road in Pennsylvania
and New Jersey, representing miners, coal
handlers. Iron-workers and general railroad
men. Three sessions were held with
closed doors, and the delegates " are
very uncommunicative. The object of
the meeting is to discuss all labor
questions directly affecting Reading men, par
ticularly the Lehigh miners' strike. It was re
solved to stand by the strikers in their demand
for 8 per cent, advanee. and all local assemblies
will be urged to contribute financial aid. Over
ene hundred Lehigh boats are lyinc at the
Reading docks in this city and the employes re
fuse to load them.
New York Central Labor Union.
NkwYork, Dec 18. The Central Labor Union
te-dy refused to adopt a resolution demanding
that Congress sbonld remove the duty from
Canadian and other British coal, to protect the
American people from the grasping greed of the
coal barons. A resolution demanding that Con
gress place a tax npon the imported barrels used
by the Standard Oil Company was referred to
the law committee.
IJurtal of an Accomplished Femslo Bandit.
St. Louis, Deo. 18. Senora Araasboa Rubio
de Pascadera, a female bandit of renown, was
buried by the side of her lover, at San Antonio,
Zacatecas, Mexico, yesterday. In early wom
anhood her intended husband was killed by
federal troops, and on his grave she swore ven
geance. Her oath was to kill five men every
year of her life, and she more than kept it. Her
first exploit was to rob the Aguas Calientes
stage, single handed. She drove the postilions
to flight, hailed the stage and ordered a sup
posed band of assistants coneealed in the cbap
paral not to shoot unless resistance was offered.
The eight passengers gave a good booty. Sbe
continued a career of robberv for many years,
which terrorized citizens of Sinaloa, Jalisco and
Sonora. and enriched herself. The authorities
and troops were powerless to suppress her. She
bequeathed her fortune to charities, dying a
natural death in obscuritv.
The Rumored Indictment of Amor Smith.
Cincinnati. Dea. 13. It transpires that the
rumors of Mayor Smith's indictment grew out
of the faet that the grand jury is now in session
and that Prosecutor Pugh asked for the testi
mony in an investigation, made some time ago
by the Board of Revision, of charges made
against Richard Johnson, a clerk of the Police
Board. Johnson had been sent to Kentucky to
buy horses for tt police department. lie em
ployed a friend who was an expert to make the
selections for him, and instead of paying his
eommistfion separately put it into the vouchers
which represented the price of the horses. The
amoont was $143. He was found guilty of uu
6fficerhke conduet. and was discharged. Mayor
Smith's connection with the affair was to certify
to the bill. lie knew nothing of Johnson's
method, and the board specifically found that
no blame attached to hirn.

flULLIGAN'S MURDERERS.
James Robinson, the Last of the Trio, Found
Guilty of Murder in the First Degree.
Ravenna, O., Dee. 18. For the third time
within two months a verdict of murder in the
first degree has been rendered in the Criminal
Court of this county. James Robinson, of
Pittsburg, was found guilty as charged in the
indictment aeainst him. Together with "Blinky"
Morgan and John Coughlin, already convicted,
the prisoner killed detective William IL Hulli
gan, of Cleveland, last February, on a train in
this place. Robinson's case was given to the
jury on Saturday afternoon), but no verdict was
reached until this afternoon. The court and
officers were hastily summoned, and at 6 o'clock
the fate of Robinson was , announced. The
prisoner received the news without any display
of outward emotion, but his two sisters created
a scene by a great demonstration of grief.
This is the end of one of the greatest
crimes ever committed in the Western Reserve.
The'triai attracted general attention. On the
28th day of January, 18S7, the fur store of Ben
edict & Ruedy, on Superier street, Cleveland,
was burglarized in a remarkably bold manner,
and sealskin cloaks, valued at $3,000, carried
away. It was learned that these furs were
shipped to Pitt3burg, and a notorious crook,
known as "McMnnn the Kid," was arrested in
that city. Police Captain Henry Hoehn and de
tective Hulligan, of the Cleveland force, were
detailed to bring the prisoner from Pitts
burg. They left there on the night of Feb. 3,
taking a Cleveland & Pittsburg train. MeMunn
and detective Hulligan sat in the same seat,
the prisoner being securely shackled to the of
ficer. Hoehn sat opposite, facing them
About 4 o'clock in the morning
the train reached Ravenna, a small
town in Portage couuty, thirty miles
from Cleveland. Here a stop was made for a
few minutes. There were not over half a dozen
persons in the car with the officers and their
prisoner, and of this number four were rather
shabbily-dressed men. Two of them rose and
started for the door. When they reached the
seats occupied by the officers they halted. Quick
as thought revolvers were flashed out and
thrust under the very noses of the two astounded
policemen. The same instant some one from
behind struck Hulligan a fearful blow over the
head with a coupling pin. His shriek of agony
roused Hoehn to action. Leaping to bis feet
and drawing a pistol he fought single-handed
with the outlaws. The lights in the car were
extinguished and a fusillade of shots riddled
windows and frame-work. Unaided Hoehn
conld not successfully combat with his four as
sailants, and, wounded, he soon sank to the floor,
receiving as he went down a blow on the head
from the same weapon that had felled Hulligan.
In the meantime MeMunn, assisted by an ac
complice, bad dragged the helpless form of Hul
ligan out of the car onto the depot platform, the
key was taken from the officer's pocket, the
handcuffs unlocked, and rescuers and rescued
disappeared in the darkness. Four days later
Hulligan died, but his murderers had made
good tbeir escape.
For five months not a trace of the outlaws
could be obtained, but their identity had been
pretty clearly established. "Bllnky" Mogan
was the ringleader of the gang, and with him
were associated Pat Hanley, Billy Harring
ton and one other, now thoueht to be James
Coughlin. On the 27th of June Morgan and two
other men, giving their names as Charles Rob
inson and James Coughlin, were arrested at
Alpena, Mich. 'Blink j" was taken by sur
prise, but made a desperate resistance,
and in the melee Sheriff Lynch, the brave offi
cer who made the arrest, was shot in the thigh.
He lingered for several weeks, and died at the
hospital in Detroit from blood poisoning in
duced by the wound. Morgan and his two con
federates were bronght to Cleveland, and short
ly afterward transferred to the county jail in
Ravenna, where the trial took place, the crime
with which they were charged having been com
mitted in Portage county.
Paddy Ryan Wants to Fight Cardiff;
Minneapolis, Minn., Dec. 18. John Donald
son is in receipt of a letter, from Paddy Ryan,
who is now in California, asking him if there
would be any prospect of getting on a fight with
Cardiff if he should come to Minneapolis on his
way East. In his letter Ryan says that if Kil
rain beats Smith for the world's championship,
he proposes to challenge him for a fight to a
finish for the championship and for $5,000 to
$10,000 a side stake money. Ryan claims to be
the next best man to Sullivan in America. Car
diff had not made up his mind late yesterday
afternoon whether he would meet Ryan or not.
It is quite probable, however, that a twelve or
fifteen-round contest with small gloves will be
arranged, to take place at the Washington Rink,
in January.
The Diffusion Process.
New Orleans. Deo. 18. A dispatch received
from the government diffusion experiment sta
tion, on ex-Governor Warmouth'a plantation,
says: "The second sugar from the run of
Dec 3 has been dried out and weighed, and
shows a product of forty pounds to the ton, ten
pounds more than was estimated. Added to
the first sugar, 14G.1, this makes a total of 186
pounds to the too from cane polarizing 12.26
sucrose and .99 glucose. Theoretically the
available sugar in this particular lot of cane was
194 pounds of sugar to the ton. This is a gain
of about 10 per cent, over the best average
made by the most Improved processes other than
diffusion."
Rev. Fulton's Rook to Be Pruned.
Boston, Dec. 18. Rev. Justin D. Fulton has
notified Rand, Avery & Co. that Anthony Corn
stock approves his book. He proposes that the
proofs be submitted to the State Attorney
general, and that the question of printing the
book depend upon that official's report on its
propriety. Rand, Avery & Co. will accept this
suggestion, and such parts of the book as may
be objected to Dy the Attorney-general will be
cut out.

Bismarck Still the Arbiter Result or the
Vienna War Council.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
London Deo. 18. The English and conti
nental journals continue to publish articles,
varying in length from a column to a page, dis
cussing the chances of an almost immediate
European war. Military circles iu Berlin are
imbued with the conviction that war is immi
nent,but there is a suspicion that in this case the
wish is father to the thought. One high official
in the German military service is quoted as say
ing that the situation has assumed a phase
making it possible that war may come over
night. The Berlin Post is also a firm believer
in the nearness of war, and goes to the length
of fixing the time of its breaking out at some
time during the month of'February.
The London Observer, on tbe other hand, while
deprecating hostilities as the result of any of
the existing differences between the European
powers, believes that there will be no war. "Ev
eryone," it says, "inclines to the belief that a
war precipitated by Russia is inevitable, but
this is hardly possible. Whether Russia wauts
to fight or not and it is doubtful if she does
there can be no war without the consent of Ger
many, and thus far there is no reason for assum
ing that she entertains a wish for war."
Tbe military council in Vienna to-day was
presided over by Emperor Francis Joseph.
There were present Herr Von Tisza, Hungarian
Prime Minister; Count Von Taafe, Minister of
the Interior; Count Kalnoky, Herr Von Kallay,
Imperial Minister of Finance; Archduke Al
brecht, Count Von" Welsersheimer, Minister of
Defense of Austria; and Baron Von Fejervary,
Minister of Defense of Hungary. Previous to
and after the council, Herrr Von Tisza had a
conference with Count Kalnoky. The council
resolved that the unexpended portion of the
credit of 52.000,000 florins, voted last spring,
sbaU be applied to the purchase of equipments
and construction of huts for troops in Galicia.
No increase of the force in Galicia has yet been
decided upon, and, if there is co further aug
mentation of Russia's troops on the frontier,
Austria will adhere to the policy of observation.
Another military council has been sum moned
for to-morrow.
It is semi-ofScially stated that the Austrian
Cabinet shares in the belief that good relations
with Russia will be maintained. No difference
exists except with respect to Bulgaria. Austria
is ready to assist in a pacific solution of the
question, but the announcement in the Invalids
Russe, that Russia projects a whole series of
military measures, of which the recent increase
of forces in Poland is only a part, enjoin in
creased military vigilance. Austria must keep
pace with Russian plans. Count Von Taafe and
Herr Von Tisza agree that the summoning of
the Delegations in the meantime would bo inop
portune. The Berlin National Zeitung says that Von
Schweimtz, the German embassador to Russia,
returns to St. Petersburg with conciliatory in
instructions. Prince Bismarck, the paper says,
counsels Austria, while strengthening her mili
tary position, to avoid giving provocation to
Russia.
The Vienna correspondent of the Daily News
says: "Austria and Germany are acting like
one nation with regard to the war scare. Aus
tria takes no step without Germany's approval.' '
The North German Gazette says: "Austria
evidently expected a more honest answer than
that of the Invalide Russe an answer that, if
unresolved to undo the measures already taken,
Russia wonld at least listen to just objections to
her frontier movements and henceforth desist
from such tactics. If the reinforcing in Russia
continues we would not be surprised to see
Austria-Hungary doing likewise."
IRISH AFFAIRS.
The Present Week JLikely to Witness Vigor
ous Enforcement of the Crimes Act.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
London, Dec. 18. The Nationalist press are
unanimous in waging bitter opposition to the
establishment of a new Catholic university in
Dublin, for which it is asserted Doctor O'Dwyer,
the Conservative bishop of Limerick, ha3 al
ready drafted a scheme.
The government, as the result of yesterday's
discussion of Irish matters in the Cabinet coun
cil, is determined to prosecute the editor or pub
lishers of every newspaper publishing reports of
meetings of league branches whose suppression
has been proclaimed, and it is asserted that Mr.
O'Brien will be rearrested the moment his pres
ent term of imprisonment expires, unless bis
paper, United Ireland, ceases, in the meantime,
its persistent repetitions of the offense for which
its editor was indicted and placed in jail. It is
probable that the present week will witness a
vigorous enforcement of the crimes act in Ire
land, in pursuance of instructions issued yester
day and dispatched post haste to Dublin Castle.
Mr. Barrett, who was arrested recently on a
charge of obstructing the Irish police, but
whose case was dismissed for lack of evidence,
has expressed his determination to continue his
action for libel against Chief Secretary Balfour
for having stated in a public speech that Bar
rett bad been convicted. Mr. Balfour, when
his attention was called to the inaccuracy of his
statement, wrote a letter to the press to correct
his mistake, but Mr. Barrett does not deem the
Secretary's explanation adequate and will have
nothing less than an abject apology or substan
tial damages at the bands of a court of law,
neither of which, however, he is likely to get.
IMPERIAL MISERY
The Russian Czar's Trouble Ills Wife Going:
Insane and Ilia Son a Consumptive.
New York Special to Globe-Democrat.
Tbe following article is a translation from a
letter written in the Russian language to a Rus
sian citizen of this State, by an official of high
standing in the Russian court:
"It is not too mnch to say that to day Alex
ander III, the autocrat of all the Ruasias, is in
deed one of the most miserable men of this
country. Putting aside the absurd notion that
he, the Czar, is virtually an earthly god of his
own country, let us look at him as a man, a
husband and a father of bis family. Not even
the fiercest of the Nihilists have ever accused
Alexander Alexandroviteh of being a dishonest
man; and yet since he ascended the imperial
throne, he never enjoyed the lot of the
upright man. Like an outlaw pursued by a
vigilance committee, he is forced to bide nim
self. going stealthily from one secluded place to
another. When visiting this capital he is ex
pected to follow faithfully a detailed route made
out for him by the police, and it happened time
and again that his manhood spoke louder than
the Czar, and he ordered his driver to go by a
route unguarded and unlooked for, to tbe inde
scribable consternation of the police, detective
and gen-darmes officers. But the lack of com
forts of civil life is quite insieuificant by the
side of the deep sorrow he suffers as husband
and father.
"There is no man in Russia truer and more
tender to his wife than Alexander Alexandro
viteh is to his. Now imagine the lot of this lov
ing husband realizing the dreadful fact that his
beloved wife, bota physically and mentally, is
quite worn out; that the restless nights and
weary days and constant fear for years have
completely undermined her health, so much
so that to-day she is showing the symptoms of
approaching insanity. Those who some six years
ago have seen the lovely, lively, rosy-cheeked
and ever-smiling wife of tbe Czarovitch can
hardly now realize the same woman in the
Czarina. Pale, ever trembling at the least un
expected noise, with deep, dark circles surround
ing her eyes such is the Czarina of to-day.
How dearly she has paid already for the imper
ial crown? And her hour of trial is yet at the
beginning. Is there a woman in Russia who
would exchange her lot for the Czarina's? To
dread ceaselessly for her husband's fate, and
to wait for the premature but inevitable death of
her elder son, this is enough to break the heart
of any woman.
"The doom of the Czarovitch is sealed. He
has consumption. This is a court secret. Think
only of the Czar's feelings in view of repeated at
tempts on his life. If tbe worst should happen
to him, who would take charge of his family and
the empire? Certainly the Czarovitch is not in
a condition to take up that burden. Then he
would abdicate in favor of his next brother,
Grand Duke George, a youth of sixteen. But
that would involve a perturbation that might
endanger the very imperial throne. We mnst
have in view that the imperial houses of Roman
off of to-day is not at all a happy and peaceful
family. There is in it as much of discontent,
conspiracy and hatred as in the country at large.
Grand Duke Constantine. uncle of the Czar, for
instance, has a personal grudge against the
autocrat, and it is said he would agree to any
terms, provided he would be placed at the helm
of the government, be it with tbe title of a Czar,
or of a constitutional Emperor, or even of a
President But Grand Duke Vladimir, the
chief commander of the army of the St. Peters
burg district, a man of the Nicholas type, would
not sarrender his power to any one, so that there
wou'd be indeed lively timesjiere should a Nihil
ist's bomb reach its aim.
"As to the Nihilist movement, it must be said
that the Czar's substitutes, though unawares,
have succeeded in bringing it up to the red-bot
pitch. Curious enough, all the Czar's Ministers
were vying with each other in order to provoke
the bad blood of the conspirators. General Van
novsky. Minister of War, has succeeded in com
pelling all the university graduates to serve in
the army for the term of one year. Take annually
3,000 young, hot-headed, self-appointed candi
dates for a radical Parliament, dress them in a
uniform and force them to serve the absolute
ruler, and you will have the result attained by
General Vannovsky.
"Then comes Chief Procurer of the noly Synod
Pobedonoetzeff, who undertook an extraordinary
job of dismissing 100,000 village school teachers
and appointing as many priests in their stead.
Is it not natural to expest that out of the thou
sands of dismissed taachers at least hundreds
will join the conspirators' ranks?
"Further on, Minister of Publie Instruction
Delianoff, by his senseless orders, provoked both
students and their parents to the last degree.
He limited the number of students of each' uni
versity to a certain maximum, and as that maxi
mum is far below the number of the students
enrolled, hundreds of them have beem peremp
torily dismissed from each university. To these
etudents dismissed, for no cause of theirs, must
be added the Jewish students debarred from the
university education, for only 3 per cent, of
them are now admitted to the universities, that
is, three Jews to ninety-seven Christians.
"is there any wonder that now throughout the
country tbe sons are conspiring and tbe fathers
are grumbling against the one man government?
And yet that particular man is neither origina
tor nor abettor of those stupid and cruel so
called reforms. He is responsible for them only
becaune a blind destiny placed him at the helm
of a ship, to guide which he was neither brought
up nor has he a natural capacity. And that is
not his fault either. He is full of good inten
tions, but that is not enough in order to become
a wise ruler. And, indeed, he is ruled himself
as much as anybody else in this country.
"Take, for instance, the finances of the coun
try. Since Alexander III ascended the throne
a rigid economy has been apparantly observed
l'ViU departments, and yet each year tbe bal
ance showed a deficit of $25,000,000 to $35,000,
000. Could the Czar wipe out this deficit he
would gladly do it. nor could his learned Miais
ser of Finance, Professor Bunge. achieve that
feat. The present Minister, Vyshnegradsky,
promised to the Czar to close tbe state accounts
without a deficit. Certainly th8 Czar has no
idea whether that promise can or can not be
fulfilled, and to be sure he has nothing to sug
gest to that end.
"While he was enjoying his long visit in Den
mark, a number of clear-headed officers of the
Ministry were sent to different countries, in
cluding tbe United States, to study the internal
revenue system. The Ministry is fully aware
that the people here could not stand any in
crease of taxes, with the exception of those col
lected on liquors and tobacco, and so the taxes
on these two items will be increased to the ex
tent of the deficit. It is said here that in case of
need the selling of liquors will be retained by tbe
government as its special monopoly. So it
is possible that under Alexander III, asunder
Nicholas, every vodka shop in Russia will
be ornamented with the imperial em
blem of the double-headed eagle. But whatever
be suggested to tbe Czar for better replenishing
the treasury, he has but to approve it in his
laconic style "so be it" And if one measure
proves bad and another is pointed out to him in
its stead, he again indorses the new experiment.
To this is the autocratic ruling reduced in tbe
reign of Alexander III. Nevertheless, all the
Russians seem to be in despair. They are tired
of the beAurocratic regime. If the Czar does
not rule, then they will rule themselves. This
is a general, though not an outspoken, desire
here.
"The political prophets of to-day will un
doubtedly find it the most difficult of tasks to
tell anything of tbe coming condition of Russia,
Germany. France and Europe in general. With
the Czar hunted down by the irrepressible con
spirators and the Czarovitch sinking from con
sumption, who can tell what perturbation may
take place in Russia in the next year? With tbe
Kaiser of Germany in his nineties, the Crown
Prince afflicted with cancer, and bis son, Prince
William, suffering from a dangerous chronio
disease, a gloomy uncertainty is banging over
the German empire; and with the present

GENERAL FOREIGN NEWS.
Burial of an Alleged Victim of One of the
Trafalgar Square Riots.
London, Dec. 18. The funeral of Linnell,
who is alleged to have died from injuries re
ceived at the bands of the police in the Trafalgar
square riots of Nov. 13, took place to-day, and
was conducted with much display and attended
by an immense crowd. Dense crowds of people
from the East End, attended by bands of music
and carrying flags, banners, streamers, etc.,
marched to the cemetery and literally packed it.
There was no attempt at a riotous demonstra
tion, and, with the exception of a few isolated
and very trival rows between tbe rougher ele
ment and the police, everything passed off with
the utmost good order.
The funeral was made the occasion of the
most imposing public demonstration seen for
many years. As the procession neared the
cemetery, it was a mile and a half long, and it
is estimated that there were 100,000 persons in
the crowds that thronged the streets throughout
the route.

TUB SWEET-TEMPERED ST. JOHN.
Ha Takes Exceptions to Mr. Blaine's Views
and Declares Him a "Jlonster."
Special to the I&dianapolia Journal
New York, Dec. 18. Ex-Gov. John P. St.
John addressed the Manhattan Temperance As
sociation in Cooper Union Hall thi3 afternoon.
His subject was "Unclean Thing3." The whisky
traffic, he said, was an "unclean thing, and
there was no middle ground for the coward. Ha
extolled Mayor Howland, of Toronto, and the
text which was above his office door, thus, "Ex
cept the Lord keep the city the watchmen wake
in vain." Mr. St. John excited derisive laughter
by inquiring how that text would look over the
office-door of Mayor Hewitt, in this city. "Tho
greatest men make the greatest mistakes,"
quoth the speaker, and then added: "If this is
true, James G. Blaine's great cheers from tho
audience reputation has been vindicated by his
greatest blunder." Ho then dissected Mr.
laine's recent interview upon tho President's
message, and ridiculed his expressions relative
to the tobacco and whisky taxes. He declared
that when Mr. Blaine advocated the abolition of
the tobacco tax he led the young into evil paths,
and when he declared that tobacco was a neces
sity "he proved himself a monster." Mr. St.
John gloried that Mr. Blaine said he favored de
struction of high license in all the States, and
exclaimed "Thank God! we have smoked him
out on that at last."
Resolutions were then adopted arraigning the
Mayor and police officials of this city for the
alleged open sale of rum in New York city on
Sundays.

Views of Mr. Itynnra on the Question of Its
Admission as a State.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal,
Washington, Dec 18. Representative By
num, of Indiana, was asked by the Journal cor
respondent this afternoon whether , he believed
the House would pass a bill admitting Utah to
the Union of States at this session. Mr. Bynunt
can give a very good reflex of the sentiment of
the Democratic side of the House, as Le is on
of the most active in his party. He said:
'No, I do not think Utah will come into the
Union of States for probably a number of years,
and I wiil tell you why. The demand for ad
mission to statehood is made by tbe ilormcns,
and there is behind it a deep-laid Mormon trick.
I have no doubt the Mormons would very read
ily coneent to have a provision in their Constitu
tion declaring polygamy to be a crime, and pro
hibiting it in the State; but they very well
know that such a provision in the Constitution,
unless it is backed by moral sentiment and
force, would be perfect'y idle, and without ef
fect. A constitutional provision is not self-acting
or self-enforcing. A State Constitution can
not fix a penalty for a crime. There must be
enactments by the State Legislature, and, of
course, after Utah became a State, although 1
declared in its Constitution against polygamy,
the Legislature and affairs of the State gener
ally would be in the hands of Mormons and
polygsmists, and they would refuse to pass any
laws to carry out the provision in their Consti
tution. This would make all requirements and
provisions of Congress a dead letter. Utah
must purge herself of her sins before she can
hope to be a State She must show that she is
able to reform herself and means to be better
ias a State than a Territory before I wonld be
willing to vote for her change of condition."
At this point in the conversation Mr. Breckin
ridge, of Kentucky, who is one of the oldest
and most influential Democrats in the House,
was asked by Mr. Bynum if he did not take the
same view of the situation. Mr. Breckinridge
said:
''You are right in your diagnosis of the case.
There is just one way to overcome the objection,
and that is for Congress to adopt Randolph,
Tucker's proposed amendment to the Constita
tion of the United States, making polygamy a
crime in any part of tbe Union, and giving the
federal government and courts jurisdiction.
This will enable the government to fix the
penalty and enforce the law."
To this Mr. Bynum replied:
"The suggestion not only meets oy approval,
but I have no doubt it would be indorsed by
the majority of the Hnne: but I am afraid if
this provision is made Utah would not agree to
"come into the Union of States."
Tbe Mormon lobby bas reappeared. The
Mormon Cnurch is determinedjto make one mors
desperate effort to gain tbe fight here and thwart
tbe federal government in its determination to
dig up the roots of polygamy. There is more
clear money in the Mormon lobby than any other
that bas visited Washington for many years.
The wants of the church have all been centered
i n statehood for Utah. If the Territory of Utah
can be admitted to the Union as a State with
out a provision in the constitution on which it is
admitted, prohibiting polygamy, the State will
then le able to govern its own affairs, and in
making its laws permit as much polygamy ai
the majority of tbe inhabitants want The Mor
mon Church has absolute control of municipal
and county affairs in tbe Territory, and it wonld
be enabled to elect tbe State officers and run
things with a high hand.

BELBIONX'S MISTAKE.
A Man of National Reputation Shows Him
self in a Bad Light.
Special to the Indiananolts Journal.
Washington, Dec 18. The men of big repu
tation in Congress are often guilty of very
puerile things. In the scramble for patronage
and office the renowned men from whom the
country would expect great acts are not in
frequently guilty of very small acts. One is
related to me which affects Perry Belmont, of
New York, the eon of August Belmont, the
banker and agent for the Rothschilds. On the
roll of the House postoffice are two clerks from
New York. One is annual, while the salary of
trie other runs only during the session. One of
these positions is given to Representative Bel
mont. In tbe last Congress Postmaster Daltoa
filled the annual clerkhip for Mr. Belmont, ,
and pave the session position to another mem
ber from tbe Empire State. When the
Fiftieth Congress assembled Mr. Daltoa
thought it bat fair to give the annual position
to aother New York member, and the session
place to Mr. Belmont, thereby tramposinc
