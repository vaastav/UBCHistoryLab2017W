Final and Convincing Lesson.
"You catch with me, the voices of
humanity that are In the air. They
prow dally more audible, more articu
late, more persuasive, and they come
from the hearts of men everywhere.
They insist that the war shall not end
In vindictive action of any kind; that
no nation or people shall be robbed or
punished because the Irresponsible
rulers of a single country have them
selves done deep and damnable wrong.
It Is this thought that has been ex
pressed in the formula 'No annexa
tions, no contributions, no punitive In
demnities. Just because this crude
formula expresses the Instinctive judg
ment as to right of plain men every
where, it has been made diligent use
of by the masters of German Intrigue
to lead the people of Russia astray
and the people of every country their
agents could reach, In order that a1
premature peace might be brought

Its final and convincing lesson, and
the people of the world put In control
of their own destinies." ,

believe that it Is necessary to say
plainly what we here at the seat of ac
tion consider the war to be for and
what part we mean to play In the set
tlement of Its searching Issues.
"We are the spokesmen of the Amer
ican people, and they have a right to
know whether their purpose Is ours.
They desire peace by the overcoming
of evil, by the defeat once for all of
the sinister forces that Interrupt
pence and. render it Impossible, and
thoy wish to know how closely our
thought runs with theirs, and what ac
tion we propose. They are Impatient

nantly Impatient but tfiey will foe
equally Impatient with us If we do not
make It plain to them what our ob
jectives are and what we are planning
for In seeking to make conquest of
peace by arms.
Menace Must Be Crushed.
"I believe that I speak for them
when I say two things: First, that
this Intolerable thing of which the
masters of Germany have shown us
the ugly face, this menace' of com
bined Intrigue and force which we now
see so clearly as the German power.
a Thing without conscience or honor
or capacity for covenanted peace, must
be crushed and. If It Is not utterly
brought to an end, at least shut out
. from the friendly Intercourse of the
nations ; and, second, when this Thing
and Its power are Indeed defeated and
the time comes that we can discuss
peace when the German people have
spokesmen whose words we can be

ready In the name of their people to
accept the common Judgment of

fluence, secured by the peace of the
world. We were content to abide the
rivalries of manufacture, science and
commerce that were involved for us In
her success and stand or fall s we
had or did not have the brains and the
Initiative to surpass her. But at the
moment when she had conspicuously
won her triumphs of peace she threw
them away, to establish In their stead
what the world will no longer permit
to be established, military and political
domination by arms, by which to oust
where she could not excel the rivals
she most feared and hated. The peace
we make must remedy that wrong. It
must deliver the once fair lands and
happy peoples of Belgium and north
ern France from the Prussian conquest
and the Prussian menace, but it must
also deliver the peoples of Austria
Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans,
and the peoples of Turkey, alike In
Europe and In Asia, from the impudent
and alien dominion of the Prussian
military and commercial autocracy,
To Manage Their Own Affairs.
"We owe it, however, to ourselves to
say that we do not wish In any way to
Impair or to re-arrange the Austro
Hungarlan empire. It is no affair of
ours what they do with their own life,
either Industrially or politically. We
do not purpose or desire to dictate to
them in any way. We only desire to
see that their affairs are left In their
own hands, in all matters, great or
small. We shall hope to secure for the
peoples of the Balkan peninsula and
for the people of the Turkish empire
the right and opportunity to make
their own lives safe; their own for
tunes secure against oppression or in
justice and free from .the dictation of
foreign courts or parties.
"And our attitude and purpose with
?gnrd to Germany herself ere of a
ke kind. We Intend no wrong against
he German empire; no interference
with her internal affairs. We should
eetn either the one or the other ab-
olutely unjustifiable, absolutely con
trary to the principles we have pro
fessed to live by and to hold most
acred throughout our life as a na
tion.
German People Deceived.
"The people of Germany nre being
told by the men whom they now per
mit to deceive them and to act as their
masters that they are fighting for the
very life and existence of their em
pire ; a war of desperate self-defense
against deliberate aggression. Nothing
could be more grossly or wantonly
false, and we must seek by the ut
most openness and candor as to our
real aims to convince them of its false
ness. We are in fact fighting for their
emancipation from fear, along with
our own from the fear as well as
from the fact of unjust attack by
neighbors or rivals or schemers after
world empire. No one Is threaten
ing the existence of or the indepen
dence or the peaceful enterprise of
th German empire.
Not Again to Be Trusted.
'The worst that can happen to the
German people is this, that if they
should still, after the war is over,
continue to be obligated to live under
ambitious and intriguing masters in
terested to disturb the peace of the
world, men or classes of men whom the
other peoples of the world could not
trust, it might be Impossible to admit
them to the partnership of nations
which must henceforth guarantee the
world's peace. That partnership must
be a partnership of peoples, not a mere
partnership of governments. It might
be Impossible, also, in such untoward
circumstances, to admit Germany' to
the free economic intercourse which
must inevitably spring out of the other
partnerships of a real peace. But
there would be no aggression In that;
and such a situation, Inevitable be
cause of distrust, would In the very
nature of things sooner or later cure
Itself, by processes which would as
suredly set in.
Wrongs Must Be Righted.
"The wrongs, the very deep wrongs,
committed- In this war will have to be
righted. That of course. But they
cannot and must not be righted by the
commission of similar wrongs against
Germany and her allies.
"The world will not permit the com
mission of similar wrongs as a means
of reparation and settlement. States
men must by this time have learned
that the opinion of the world is every
where wide awake and fully compre
hends the Issues involved. No repre
sentative of any self-governed nation
will dare disregard it by attempting
any such covenants of selfishness and
compromise as were entered Into at the
congress of Vienna. The thought of
the plain people here and everywhere
throughout the world, the people who'
enjoy no privilege and have very sim
ple and unsophisticated standards of
right and wrong. Is the air all govern
ments must henceforth breathe If they
would live. It is in the full disclos
ing light of that thought that all poli
cies must be conceived and executed in
this mid-day hour of the world's life.
People Have No Say.
"German rulers have been able to up
set the peace of the world only because
the German people were not suffered
under their tutelage to share the com
radeship of the other peoples of the
world either in thought or in rurpose.
They were allowed to have no opinion
of their own which might be set up as
a rule of conduct for those who exer
cised authority over them. But the
congress that concludes this war will
feel the full strength of the tides that
run now In the hearts and consciences
of freedom everywhere. Its conclu
siens will run with these tides.
All these things have been true
from the very beginning of this stu
pendous war ; and I cannot help think
ing that if they had been made plain
at the very outset the sympathy and
enthusiasm of the Russian people
might have been once, for all enlisted
on the side of the allies, suspicion and
distrust swept away, and a real and
lasting union of purpose effected. Had
they believed these things at the very
moment of their revolution and had
they been confirmed In that belief
since, the sad reverses which have re
cently marked the progress of their
affairs towards an ordered and stable
government of freemen might have
been avoided.
"The Russian people have been
poisoned by the very same falsehoods
that have kept the German people In
the dark, and the poison has been ad
ministered by the very same hands.
The only possible antidote is the truth.
It cannot be uttered too plainly or too
often.
Freedom of the Seas.
"From every point of view, there
fore, it has seemed to be my duty to
speak these declarations of purpose, to
add these specific Interpretations to
what I took the liberty of saying to the
senate In January. Our entrance into
the war has not altered our attitude
towards the settlement that must come
when it is over. When I said in Janu
ary that the nations of the world were
entitled not only to free pathways up
on the sea but also to assured and un
molested access to those pathways I
was thinking, and I am thinking, now,
not of the smaller and weaker nations
alone, which need our countenance and
support, but also of the great and pow
erful nations, and of our present ene
mies as well as our present associates
in the war. I was thinking, and am
thinking now, of Austria herself,
among the rest, as well as of Serbia
and of Holand. Justice and equality
of rights can be had only at a great
price. We are seeking permanent, not
temporary, foundations for the peace
of the world and must seek this can
didly and fearlessly. As always, the
right will prove to be expedient.
Declare War on Austria.
"What shall "we do, then, to push
this great war of freedom and just to
its righteous conclusion? We must
clear away with a thorough hand all
impediments to success and we must
make every adjustment of law that
will facilitate the full and free use of
our whole capacity and force as a
fighting unit.
"One very embarrassing obstacle
that stands in our way is that we are
at war with Germany but not with her
allies. I, therefore, very earnestly rec
ommend that the congress immediately
declare the United States in a state of
war with Austria-Hungary. Does it
oem strange to you that this should
be the conclusion of the argument I
have just addressed to you? It is not
It is In fact the inevitable logic of
what I have said. Austria-Hungary is
for the time being not her own mis
tress, but simply the vassal of the
German government. We must face
the facts as they are and act upon
them without sentiment in this stern
business. The government of Austria-
Hungary is not acting upon its own
initiative or in response to the wishes
and feelings of its own peoples, but as
the instrument of another nation. We
must meet its force with our own and
regard the central powers as but one.
The war can be successfully conducted
in no other way.
As to Turkey and Bulgaria.
The same logic would lead also to
a declaration of war against Turkey
and Bulgaria. They also are the tools
of Germany. But they are mere tools
and do not yet stand in the direct path
of our necessary action. We shall go
wherever the necessities of thi war
carry us, but it seems to me that we
sRould go only where immediate and
practical considerations land us and
not heed any others.
The financial and. military meas
ures which must be adopted will sug
gest themselves as the war and its un
dertakings develop, but I will take the
liberty of proposing to you certain
other acts of legislation which seem
to me to be needed for the support of
the war and for the release of our
whole force and energy.
"It will be necessary to extend in
certain particulars the legislation of
the last session with regard to alien
enemies ; and also necessary, I be
lieve, to create a very definite nnd
particular control over the entrance
and departure of all persons into and
from the United States.
"Legislation should be enacted de
fining as a criminal offense every willful
violation of the presidential proclama
tions relating to alien enemies promul
gated under section 40G7 of the Re
vised Statutes and providing approprl
ate punishments; and women as well
as men, should be Included under the
terms of the acts placing restraints
upon alien enemies. It is likely that
as time goes on many alien enemies
will be willing to be fed and housed
at the expense of the government In
the detention camps, and it would be
the purpose of legislation I have sug
gested to confine offenders among
them In penitentiaries and other sim
liar Institutions where they could be
made to work as other criminals do.
Go Further in Fixing Prices.
"Recent experience has convinced
me that the congress must go further
in authorizing the government to set
limits to prices. The law of supply
and demand, I am sorry to say, has
been replaced by the law of unrestrain
ed selfishness. While we have elim
inated profiteering in several branches
of industry, it still runs impudently
rampant In others. The farmers, for
example, complain with a great deal of
justice, that while the regulation of
food prices restricts their incomes, no
restraints are placed upon tho prices
of most of the things they must them
selves purchase, and similar iniquities
obtain on all sides.
"It Is imperatively necessary that the
consideration of the full use of the
water power of the country and also
the consideration of the systematic
and yet economical development of
such of the natural resources of the
country as are still under the control
of the federal government should be
Immediately resumed and affirmatively
and constructively dealt with at the
earliest possible moment. The press
ing need of such legislation is daily be
coming more obvious.
A Word to the Lawmakers.
"The legislation proposed at the last
session with regard to regulated com
binations among our exporters, in or
der to provide for our foreign trade a
more effective organization and meth
od of co-operation, ought by all means
to be completed at this session.
And I beg that the members of the
house of representatives will permit
me to express the opinion that it will
be impossible to deal in any but a very
wasteful and extravagant fashion with
the enormous appropriations of tho
public moneys which must continue to
be made, if the war Is to be properly
sustained, unless the house will con
sent to return to its former practice
of initiating nnd preparing all appro
priation bills through a single commit
tee, in order that responsibility may
be centered, expenditures standardized
and made uniform and waste and du
plication as much as possible avoided.
"Additional legislation may also be
come necessary before the present con
gress again adjourns in order to effect
the most efficient co-ordination and op
eration of the railway and other trans
portation systems of the country; but
to that I shall, if circumstances should
demand, call the attention of the con
gress upon another occasion.
Concentrate on Winning War.
"If I have overlooked anything that
ought to be done for the more effective
conduct of the war, your own counsels
will supply the omission. What I am
perfectly clear about is that in the
present session of tne c-ongress our
whole attention and energy should be
concentrated on the vigorous, rapid
and successful prosecution of the great
task of winning the war. ,
"We can do this with all the greater
zeal and enthusiasm because we know
that for us this as a war of high prin
ciple, debased by no selfish ambition
of conquest or spoliation; because we
know, and all the world knows, that
we have been forced Into it to save the
very institutions we live under from
corruption and destruction. The pur
poses of the central powers strike
straight at the very heart of every
thing we believe in; their methods of
warfare outrage every principle of hu
manity and of 'knightly honor; their
intrigue has corrupted the very
thought and spirit of many of our
people; their sinister and secret diplo
macy has sought to take our very ter
ritory away from us and disrupt tjje
union of the states. Our safety would
be at an end, our honor forever sullied
and brought Into contempt were we to
permit their triumph. They are strik
ing at the very existence of democracy
and liberty. .
Cause Is Just and Holy.
It is because it is for us a war of
high, disinterested purpose, in which
all the free peoples of the world are
banded together for the vindication of
right, a war for the preservation of our
nation, and of all that it has held dear
of principle and of purpose, that we
felt ourselves doubly constrained to
purpose for its outcome only that
which is righteous and of irreproach
able intention, for our foes as well as
for our friends. The cause being just
and holy, the settlement must be of
like motive and quality. For this we
can fight, but for nothing less noble
or less worthy of our traditions. For
this cause we entered the war and for
this cause will we battle until the last
gun is fired.
"I have spoken plainly, because this
seems to me the time when it is most
necessary to speal? plainly, in order
that all the world rrny know that even
in the heat and ardor of the struggle
and when our v;)iole thought is of
carrying the war through to its end
we have not forgotten any ideal or
principle for which the name of Amer
ica has been held in honor among the
nations and for which it has been our
glory to contend in the great genera
tions that went before us. A supreme
moment of history has come. The
eyes of the people have been opened,
and they see. The hand of God is laid
upon the nations. He will show them
favor, I devoutly believe, only if they
rise to the clear heights of his own
justice and mercy."

The Mystery Explained. .
Clifton Hess, an employee of the
Pennsylvania railroad at Shelbyville,
Ind., relates the Indianapolis News,
looked out the window of the freight
depot the other day and noticed a
woman. A half hour later he looked
again and still saw the woman. She
had changed her position only slightly,
moving down the railroad track a few
feet. She seemed to be strolling leis
urely along, covering about a foot a
minute.
Curious to determine the reason for
her actions, Hess walked outside to
get a better view. Then it was all
explained. The woman had a big
Rhode Island Red rooster with a
string tied to his leg. There had
evidently been a leaky car of wheat
along the railroad, and the rooster, ob
livious to all else, was calmly filling
his craw while the woman kept up
with the procession.
Later on during the day the good
news must have spread, for there ap
peared on the scene several other
chickens with owners attached to
them by strings. As the ground be
came clean the procession slowly
moved from view.

Halifax, N. S., Dec. 7. Two thou

Injured and fully one-half of the City
of Halifax is in ruins as the result of
an explosion in Bedford Basin, north
of town, when the loma, a Belgian re
lief ship, collided with the French mu
nition ship Mont Blanc.
The Mont Blanc was blown to pieces,
but the crew escaped by the ship's
boats before the explosion.
The pilot asserts that the collision
ivas due to a confusion of signal whis
tles. Many Seamen Lost.
The Mont Blanc was pierced on the
port side almost to the engine room.
The loma, which was only slightly
damaged, backed away when flames
burst out on the munitions ship, and
was abandoned by the crew.
The captain of the Mont Blanc also
ordered his crew to the boats as he
realized an explosion was inevitable.
The men reached shore safely before
the tremendous blast, 17 minutes later,
which blew their ship to pieces.
Members of crews of ships in the
harbor were killed and injured. On
one steamer, the Pictou, it is report
ed that 13 of the crew of 42 were
killed. Bodies of many seamen have
been picked up in the harbor.
Fire Threatens City.
Fire following the explosion, and
which early threatened to wipe out the
entire city, caused property damage
which will run into millions.

damage will run far into the millions.
Dartmouth Also Hit.
A part of the town of Dartmouth)
across the harbor from Halifax, also
was wrecked. Nearly all the buildings
in the dockyard there are in ruins.
The zone of destruction in Halifax
itself extends from the North street
railway station as far north as Afric
ville to Bedford basin and covers an
area of about two square miles in the
district known as Richmond.
The buildings which were not de
molished by the force of the terrific
explosion were destroyed by the fire
which followed.
Persons Injured in Collapse.
Scores of persons were injured by
the collapse of the railway station,
Arena rink, military gymnasium, su
gar refinery and elevator. All business
has been suspended. Armed guards of
soldiers and sailors are patrolling the
city. Not a street car is moving and
part of Halifax was in darkness last
night.
The collision occurred on the wa
ter front off Rockingham, a suburb on
the opposite shore of the harbor from
the City of Halifax, shortly before
8 :30 o'clock In the morning.
Tons of Explosives.
The Mont Blanc, which arrived at
a United States Atlantic port on No
vember 0, was laden with 3,000 tons of
munitions for France. As she was
leaving her berth, presumbably for the
outward voyage across the Atlantic,
she was rammed broadside by the Bel
gian relief ship.
The impact caused the ammunition
in the French ship to explode, setting
the vessel afire. The flames spread to
the piers and adjoining buildings,
many of which had been wrecked by
the explosion.
Try to Fight Fire.
The ships' crew was quickly called
to quarters and an attempt was made
to extinquish the flames. This failed,
and as the fire approached the holds
where the explosives were storeVl the
captain ordered the seacocks opened,
and the crew took to the boats, rowing
for their lives. '
But the vessel drifted toward one of
the piers and a few moments later an
explosion occurred, tearing the Mont
Blanc to pieces.
Overwhelming Blast.
What happened after that can only
be conjectured in large measure.
Everybody seems dazed by the result.
The concussion must have been posi
tively overwhelming.
It killed telegraph operators at their
desks four miles away.
It broke windows in Truro. It blew
heavily laden freight trucks off the
railway lines.
It caused the collapse or partial col
lapse of nearly every building along
2 miles of thoroughfares from the
Union station to the Queens hotel.
It sent the harbor shed and wharves
to wreck and ruin.
Destroys Terminals.
It shook the magnificent new ocean
terminals at the lower end of the har-
consuming earthquake.
Indeed, it is doubtful if an earth
quake could have done more damage.
Every telegraph wire, every cable
connection was put out of commission
by the shock. The entire lighting and
telephone system was disorganized.
For a while Halifax was cut off com
pletely from the outside world.
The area of destnietion includes
numerous institutions, banks and gov
ernment buildings.
Includes Citadel Hill.
Citadel Hill, the eminence which
dominates the entire city, is located
within the stricken territory and the
most important part of the water front
was in this zone.
In addition to many churches and
schools, the railway station, govern
ment dockyard, Wellington barracks.
Admiralty House (the official residence
of the admiral in command of the
North American British squadron), the
military hospital, post office, provision
al parliament building, city hall, the
ordance department, most of the de
partment stores, all of the telegraph
and cable offices and a few hotels were
located there.
Station Collapses.
The concussion resulting from the
explosion caused the roof of the Cana
dian Pacific railway station at North
street to collapse, while all the ware
houses on the water front for a mile
and a half were damaged.
The devastated district was the old
er part of Halifax and thickly popu
lated. - x
Rockingham, where the explosion'
occurred, is a suburban village about
three miles north of Halifax. It is sit
uated on the west shore of Bedford
basin, a continuation of Halifax har
bor. Since the war it has been used
as an examining station for ocean
steamers.
It was at this portion of the harbor
that ex-Ambassador Bernstorff and
party were held and examined on their
way 'from the United States to Ger
many. Richmond Wiped Out.
Amherst, N. S., Dec. 7. A late dis
patch from Halifax said the fire was
under control. Richmond, a suburb of
Halifax, has been wiped out, not a
building in the city escaping damage.
Fieces of shrapnel blown from, the
scene of the explosion were found
three miles away.
Several hundred are reported killed
and thousands injured.
The Queen's hotel on Hollis street,
near Sackville street, marks approxi
mately the southern limit of the devas
tated area, it is reported.
The berth of the Canadian cruiser
Niobe was near the area affected, but
no reports have reached here as to
whether the ship or her crew were' in
jured. Many Killed Outright by Shock.
Many people were killed outright by
the shock; hundreds were crushed by
falling buildings and debris and the
wounded were running about the
streets shrieking, with nobody to at
tend them. Even at a late hour In the
afternoon dead and dying were lying
about in scores.
The hospitals of the city were total
ly inadequate to cope with such a dis
aster, and long after they had been
filled to overflowing dead and dying
and wounded were being gathered in
by the ambulance corps and by hun
dreds of willing helpers, both Halifax
people and volunteers from the coun
try around.
Fortunately there were no Canadian
soldiers in the city or on transports
awaiting orders to sail. The only
military forces there were the perma
nent garrison, and these did yeoman
service in helping to restore order and
in succoring the dying and wounded.
We consider a man a gentleman who
takes off his W to a lady. At least
the act is thought to be gentlemanly,
polite. The origin of this custom, like
so many other customs common among
so-called civilized peoples, goes back to
primitive times, says the Salt Lake
Tribune.
When a person was made captive his
conqueror stripped him of his weapons
and clothing and left him without any
thing he could call his own. The cap
tive was thus made a slave, his lack
of clothing being evidence of his sub
jugation. We need only to look at the
sculptures of the Assyrians to see the
truth of the fact. And in Isaiah 20 :2-4,
we find the following statement: "And
the Lord said,' like as my servant
Isaiah hath walked naked and bare
foot three years for a sign, so shall
the king of Assyria lead away the
Egyptians prisoners and the Ethio
pians captives, young and old, naked
and barefoot."
The first step, then, in tracing the
origin of taking off the hat, is the
surrender of the clothing among primi- -.
tive and ancient peoples as a mark of
submission. The next step is the un
covering of the body as a mark of rev
erence. There are all degrees of un
covering, though often only the most
valuable parts of the clothing are taken
off in the presence of superiors.
It must be remembered that this
act of uncovering the body was cere
monial in nature and used to show
reverence to a superior. Then came
the use of the ceremonial to propitiate
the dead. We can see a remnant of
this most any time. At funerals and in
our graveyards men take off their hats.
They still take off their hats on enter
ing churches and before the images
of Christ and the Madonna.
In times of chivalry men raised their
hats to ladies to show reverence. But
this was only superficial in meaning.
A knight would ride down a poor peas
ant woman carrying a large burden
and never think of helping her least
of all would he think of taking off his
hat to her. However, if he heard of
some beautiful damsel of his own class
in the slightest danger, Imaginary or
real, he would go to her and, hat in
hand, kneel and dedicate himself to her
service.
Today much the same things occur.
Ordinarily a gay youth forgets to take
off his hat to his mother, yet he
shows this deference to his "best girl."
After all it is only form, and polite
ness should go deeper than this. How
ever, the form persists, and it is of
some historical interest to remember
that it is a remnant of the primitive
stripping of a captive by which process
was expressed the- fact that he yielded
up all heliad. Taking off the hat to a
wealthy girl means, occasionally, not
only the yielding up of all you have,
but the getting of all she has. Cere
mony Is often nothing but a hard cal
culation in regard to personal results,
especially where self-aggrandizement
is the ultimate aim o'f the polished individual.

Smoked Dry Pipe.
The lost pipe of a Hun raider was
found in the garden of a house in an
Essex town over which a German air
ship passed. A portion of the stem:
has been cut and flattened and upon
it is written in indelible ink, "Karl
Werner, 1313S A. G." The under side
of the bowl and the stem have been
notched eleven times and on the side
of the mouthpiece -are more notches.
The finder of the pipe said: "There
was no smell of tobacco about the pipe
and it had not apparently been recent
ly smoked. It is possible that it was
used by the owner as a dry pipe as the
mouthpiece shows signs of hard bit-,
ing. The notches cut in the stem may1
record the number of times the air-j
man had flown with it in his mouth.'"
"Smoking" a dry pipe is not unusual, i
especially would it be the case in a
Zeppelin in which a spark from a light-,
ed pipe might cause the ship's destruction.

Boston, Dec. 7. A special train car
rying 40 physicians and nurses left
Boston for Halifax. The train carried
a quantity of supplies. Arrangements
for sending it were made by the state
committee on public service In eon
junction with the state guard, which
provided the physicians. A. C. Rat-
shesky of the state committee on pub
lic safety heads the party.
Governor McCall sent the following
letter to the mayor of Halifox, to be
delivered in person by Mr. Ratshe
sky :
"I am sending A. C. Ratshesky of
the Massachusetts public safety com
mission immediately to your city with
a corps of our best state surgeons and
nurses in the belief that they be of
service to you in this hour of need.
"Kindly express to the people of
your city the very deep sympathy of
the people of the commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and assure them that
we are ready to answer any call that
they may make upon us."
Lieut. Col. William A. Brooks, act
ing chief surgeon of the state guard,
was placed in charge of the unit of
surgeons and nurses.
The war department was asked to
use its wireless to inform the mayor
of Halifax that the relief train was
coming. The train consists of two
baggage cars, two sleepers and a buf
fet car.

Stove-Heated Garden.
The garden of James Swartz of
Holter Dam, Mont, is heated by a
stove from the inside, and is protected
on the outside by a curtain which is
lowered about it on a frame. The
garden is seven feet square and con
sists of a series of terraces built
around a hollow center to a height of
ten feet. Mr. Swartz believes this
arrangement will permit a longer
growing season.
Early Day Buttons.
The ancients lacked buttons one
wonders, indeed, how they got along
without them but evidently they pos
sessed studs of modern pattern, such
as those with which we fasten our
cuffs and collars. And, in truth, they
did even have a kind of button (though
not sewn on), which fastened garments
with a pin and hook exactly in the
way our brooches and clasp pins oper
ate. Exchange.
Faithful Dog.
A dog's faith in its master has been
touchingly illustrated at Riom, France,
recently. The man has gone to the
war, and has been killed, but the dog
still awaits his return, and he refuses
to leave the station at Riom. Upon the
arrival of each train he dashes out on
to the platform, runs first to the loco
motive and then scampers from car
riage to carriage, looking for the object
of his affection until the whistle
blows and he is left to gaze wistfully,
as he did once in 1914.
Strict Accounting.
A business man requires those who
handle money to account for all ex
penditures, holds an employee respon
sible for the full amount trusted to
him and demands vouchers for all dis
bursements. Even then he may not
be- satisfied without a cash audit by
an accountant. Material should be
accounted for on exactly the same
theory as cash Itself (although pos
sibly less rigorously), says Stephen
Gilman, in Industrial Management.

venson had a nightmare of a dual per
sonality, and on that basis wrote the
novel of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

Fungi and Boleti.
In Talmudic treatise it is stated that
"the people went out into the fields

and the same thing, one having a lower

pore surface. The lexicon of the Chal
dees contains words the equivalent of
which are fungi and boleti, and the
Chaldees are credited as the first of
the so-called civilized nations, although
all recent evidence points to their de
rivation from the vastly more ancient
civilized peoples of Mexico.
