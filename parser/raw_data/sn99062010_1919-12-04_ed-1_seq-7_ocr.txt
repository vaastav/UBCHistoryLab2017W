Sinking of Fleet at Scapa Flow
Was Unauthorized, They Say
—Admiral Thought
War Was Over.
London, Dec. 1.—The German gov
ernment's note to the peace conference
denies th:.t Germany was responsible
for the sinking of the German fleet
interned at Scapa Flow, according to
Berlin dispatches today.
"The German government must re
pudiate as without. just grounds any
obligation to perform the demands
made in the allied note on the Scapa
Flow sinking," the dispatches quoted
the German note as saying.
Admiral Keuter, the dispatches
quoted the German note as saying,
thought the armistice had ended the
war when he ordered the seacocks of
his vessels opened. He was cut off
from communication with his govern
ment, it was pointed out.
The note offers to submit the matter
to arbitration of the Hague tribunal,
according to the dispatches, leaving
it to decide wether the German gov
ernment is responsible and if so what
damages are due the entente.
The note points out, according to .'.ie
Berlin dispatches, that the allied de
mands will delay speedy enforcement
of the peace treaty, which '^'•many
greatly desires.
A Berlin dispatch to the United Press
filed yesterday said the German gov
ernment had inspired a statement that
Germany would not sign the allied
protocol providing for delivery of cer
tain docks and ships to the allies in
payment for the sinking of the interned
German fleet at Scapa Flow, on the
ground France had repudiated an
agreement'to give up German prisoners

BEDS" TO DORPAT
SEEKING PEACE
Esthonian Negotiations With
the Soviet Government De
cember 2 May Include
Luthuania and Letvia.
London, Dec. 1. The Esthonian
government has announced that peace
negotiations with soviet Russia will be
begun at Dorpat an Tuesday next, De
cember 2, according to a wireless dis
patch from Moscow today. The soviet
delegates, it is stated, will cross the
frontier in the neighborhood of Pskov.
Although Esthonia only is mentioned
in the bolshevist message regarding
the impending negotiations at Dorpat it
seems not improbable that both Lithu
ania and Letvia will join in the parleys,
the first peace negotiations of moment
to be held by the bolshevists since their
historic conference of 1917 with dele
gates of the central powers which led
to the peace of Brest-Litovsk.
A Dorpat dispatch November 20, re
ported that Letvia and Lithuania had
definitely decided to join Estlronia in
inviting the bolshevists to send a dele
gation tj Dorpat to begin peace nego
tiations. The date for the negotiations
then mentioned was December 1. Max
im Litvinoff, envoy of Moscow soviet
government was in Dorpat at the time
engaged in the negotiations with the
representatives of the Balkan states
with regard to the exchange of pris
oners, arrangements concerning which
were understood to have been agreed
to.
Later advices on the situation re
ceived in dispatches from Helsingfors,
cast some doubt upon the attitude of
Letvia and Lithuania toward the bol
shevists, there being intimations that
some pressure had been exerted from
entente sources upon the Baltic states
against any peace negotiations with the
soviet. It seemed to be conceded, how
ever that at any rate Estbonia has in
vited the soviet to send a delegation to
Dorpat, and that the probability seemed
strong that other Baltic states were in
terested in the jiroposition.

New York, Dec. 1.—The hunger
strike of the Ellis Island soviet, waa
broken today. Ail but five of tho 68
radicals, who had refused to eat sinco
last. Monday evening, eagerly answered
the call to the dining room for break
fast.
After a five-day fast they were
ravenous and were first in tho immi
grants' dinintr hall. They devoured
prunes, mush, bread, substitute butter
and coffee and asked for more. Second
helpings were refused, however, not
only because one was considered ade
quate, but the radicals might have
made themselves in by eating too much.
Those who continued tho Iu ng«
strike, included Ethel Bernstein and
Dora Lipkln. They were tho only wom
en on hunger strike.
The silence strike of the 68 also had
collapsed. Word that tho department
of justice was providing the island with
eight husky guards to forco Uwm to
attend deportation hearings before the
immigration Inspectors were brought to
the radicals by their counsel.
The "strong arm" squad was on duty
at the -island today and after separat

the prisoners, began taking others be

will take several weeks. It Is said.
