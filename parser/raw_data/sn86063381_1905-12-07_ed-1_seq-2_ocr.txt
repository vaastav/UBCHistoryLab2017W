SUBSCRIPTION
Doesn't JerkJust Pulls.
"If there is one enterprise
on earth that a 'quitter'
should leave entirely alone it
is advertising. To make a
success of advertising, one
mast be prepared to stick to
it like a barnacle on a boat's
bottom. He should know be
fore he begins it that he must
spend money. Somebody
must tell him, also, that he
cannot reap results commens
urate with his expenditure
early in the game.
"Advertising doesn't jerk,
it pulls. It begins very gent
ly at first, but the pull is
steady. It increases day by
day and year by year until it
exerts an irresistible power.
"JOHN WANAMAKER."
"Cautiously and Care
fully"
THERE is no quest on in the
world today at all commensurate
in importance to the people of
this country with the question of
the growth and conduct of great
corporations. Great combina
tions of capital are the significant
features of the industrial and
commercial evolution of the
times.
These great combinations are
nob things to be hunted down
and killed, and the hue and cry
raised against them Iper se is a
greater evil than the fact of the
combinations themselves. Could
the radicals who demand the life
of every great corporation haye
their way ruin, complete and
terrible, would overwhelm eyery
legitimate enterprise in the
country. These combinations
are part of the industrial and
commeicial hfe of the country,
and cannot be destroyed without
ending all industrial and com
mercial life at the same time.
What is wanted is regulation,
not killing, "Our steady aim
should be by legislation, cautious
ly and carefully undertaken, but
resolutely persevered in, to as
sert the soverignty of the na
tional government by affirmative
action," declares President
Roosevelt in his annual message
to Congress. Hei is the only
remedy that can be safely ap
plied government regulation.
Its application may not be as ex
peditious as we desire but we
are not wise enough to make
the proper remedy today, even
had we the power. Time will
show us what form the remedy
must take.
Great corporations did nob be
come a part of our business life
in a day neither will their con
trol be accomplished in a day.
We have to proceed "cautiously
and carefully."

Cold
It should be borne in mind that
every cold weakens the lungs, low
ers the vitality and prepares the
system for the more serious dis
eases, among which are the two
greatest destroyers of human life,
pneumonia and consumption.
Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy
has won its great popularity by its
prompt cures of this most common
ailment. It aids expectoration, re
lieves the lungs and opens the
secretions, effecting a speedy and
permanent cure. It counteracts
any tendency toward pneumonia.
