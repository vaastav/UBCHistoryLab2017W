THE CATHOLIC SIDE OF IT.
IHplWhile the average thinking Ameri
can- citizen Is unalterably opposed to
enyj interference by any church of any
denomination iii governmental affairs,
inhere are many who look upon the
'*Prench separation act as of
law ousting these from its manage
j^tnnt and ownership are very natural.
Archbishop John iM. Farley, of New
®Y$:.k, explains in a public «tateoi3nt
ftlie church Bide, of the content I ji. In
ox^er to understand the Catholic
..fclerev'r refusal to oonr.ply with the or
der* of the government he explains that
rht statute demands the consent of Ihe
church and of its ministers to the
alienation of all' the property that has
been bequeathed and donated them for
religious and philanthropic purposes. It
Is property, he says, which they do not
derive from the, government, but of
which they are merely trustees.
.:
Archbishop Farley illustrates thus:
The situation created by the new law
of separation, Is as if, for instance, the
legislature of New York were to ennct
laws compelling the trustees of the
trinity church corporation under pen
alty-of confiscation, to give consent to
the alienation of all its vast property
to other uses than those for which it
was intended, and. to transfer its ad
ministration and control to people who
might either belong to rival denom
inations, even profess atheism. It is
as if the legislature of New York were
i*-to enact a statute requiring the Cath
olic /church under penalty of th^ .con
of its property to consent to
tlietraiisfer of the management and
control of its sacred edifices, seminar
.les. rectories, hospitals, protectories
and other institutions to associations in
which not merely avowed foes of Cath
olicism, but also agnostics and schem
ing politicians, interfere to any kind of
-religious belief, were in the majority.
Resistance to organized law is not
^confined to France or to one denomina
Ij tion. This country has been free from
^church interference with government
prSand government interference with re
ligions. However, We are not lacking
in resistance of class resistance to law.
In Io-wa enforcement of liquor laws has
brought on riot a.nd will again. It Is
not astonishing that the Catholic
L" flergy of- France should refuse and the
|*r great mass of Catholic communicants
H^tfresiist the edict. Nevertheless there is
l£&but one end to the struggle which, will
Bsaa'be. .to a finish. The pope's order of
ll^passivjs resistance lias left the govern
|f|pment no choice. It must :be greater or

THE WRONG DEFINITION OF 6RAFT.
The Clinton Herald refers to "the
state printer and binder graft." The
Herald, is too strong in its expression.
Under the law and the custom the
state printer and binder are granted
certain profits and privileges and when
they take advantage of them they
neither belong nor should 'be classed
as grafters. If the offices are redundant
Id expensive, abolish time. Don't call
who occupy them by the will of
ite assembly grafters. There Is
profit in the holding of these
than in holding a postoffice.
bs are not grafters "but not
ps worth the money the gov
lys him. Not a presidential
country might not be 'filled
lor better man at a saving to
of from 25 to €0 per cent of
Jpenditure. Graft alleges dis
md the holding of a state of
stated salary or commission
law o&n not be tortured into
dishonesty.
In' our enthusiasm Jet us not get
Attera mixed. The offices referred to
may be and in the opinion of most
of the voters are unnecessary—but
there Is vast difference between hold-
ing them and graft. Some graft there
has been in these offices. A case late
ly before the courts is an example but
honest men have filled them and will
again if they be continued.
These offices should bt abolished.
They are poor business. It is in the
power of those opposed to their con
tinuation to secure their abolition, it
would be well also to reform our postal
system to the extent that il $1,000 man
shall not gain $3,000 or $4,000 In value
by special appointment to a postoffice
position.

BEVERIOGE'S CHILD LABOR BILL.
The third annual meeting of the Na
tional Child Labor Committee, the or
ganization of which President Roose
velt is not only an honorary but an ac
tively interested member, reached its
conclusion on Saturday. Addresses
were made by Senator Beverldge, Felix
Adler, Jane Addams, Dr. Samuel Mc
Cune Lindsay, Homer Folks, Arthur
T. Vance and others prominent In child
labor reform work. Senator Beveridge
described in detail his bill recently in
troduced into congress to abolish chlUl
labor by prohibiting the interstate
transportation of goods manufactured
or mined by child labor.
Senator Beyeridge's idea is a good
one, perhaps In part suggested by trio
passage of the law denying interstate
rights to convict manufactures. It will
be remembered that the Nelson act of
sixteen years ago gave convict made
goods open entry into all states and
territories. Previous to that time states
could legislate against such manu
factures. Under the new federal law any
state or territory may deny the peni
tentiary products rights inside Its
boundaries.
So with the child labor law. Give the
state a' right to discriminate against
the products of child slave drivers. The
children need and free labor deserves
that recognition.

The Protestant communicants of
Greater New York in 1855 were 82,

of the city in 1905, they numbered
337,2S9, or S.4 per cent of the city's

Comparing 1905 with 1904, Federation

part of the population from 18.3 per
cent to 18.6 and Catholics theirs from
33.3 to 33.8. The churchless Protest

"It beats the devil how an American

wihin-e for a publio job," exclaims the
Odebolt Chronicle. "Men wiho can
hardly be induced to do ordinary work
at any price are generally the most
persistent applicants for places at the
state crib. Every representative and
senator has ait least half a dozen letters
per day from men who want to be door
keepers or janitors, or who want com
mittee clerkships for their daughters
or pages' positions for their little boys
who ou®ht to be in school. Truly this
ds an age of graft."
Tho Waverly Independent objects to
the custom of the farmers of Iowa
who "sell pork at $5.50 to $600 per
hundred pounds, and they buy it .back
again at $12.50 to $18 per hundred
pounds. "It is not well to continue in
the footsteps of our fathers and grand
faithers In all respects, but wouldn't it
be a good plan If the farmers would
cure the meat tihey use at home in the
good old fashioned way of the fathers
and mothers of 1840 to 1860?" asks the
Independent. "It is hardly necessary
for the farmers of Iowa to be at the
mercy of the meat trust, both going
and coming. The farmers of fifty
years ago cured their bacon and hams
so tlhat they were good and" they can
do it again if they want to."
"If the main who tolls fourteen 'hours

To the Chelsea Independent "It really

"Probably Mr. Bellamy Storer camnot

Council Bluffs Nonpareil.
"In stJhe commutation of Louis

imprisonment the governor of Iowa
has extended apparent clemency to
one of the most repulsive murderers

a kindness," says the Davenport Dem
ocrat. "Except for the hope that
some other governor, some day, might
open the prison doors with a pardon,
a swift death would be by most of us
preferred to the lingering drag of
chilling hopeless years."
The Muscatine Journal confesses to
some curiosity to see .how .the rail

As the conductor came to the top the

Editor Tiunes-Republican: The fol
lowing poem,, Which I present In an
English version, was writ-ten. by Hen
rik Wergelanul, Norway's first and
greatest republican patriot, and the
most sublime iyric poet that northern
Europe ever produced. He has been
styled "the Byron of the north." He
was a poet of tremendous caliber and
his mind was a brilliant illumination of
poetical fire and fancy. He turned the
batteries of his colUissal genius against
all forms of tyranny and oppression,
striking powerful blows at the curse of
•moss-covered creeds and She fanatical
rule of prejudice and superstltloni
Being an ardent advocate of liberty
and Justice, bis great poetical soul was
fired1 into aflame of compassion for all
patriotic martyrs who fought and fell
for fatherland and freedom.
The present poem refers to an epi
sode in the history of Ireland:
In 1798 the Irish patriots made a
bold buit unsuccessful attempt to break
the iron chains of English rule and
deliver their county from 'the cruel
shackles of foreign despots. The in
surrection was crushed by fire and
sword, and a bloody vengeance was
wreaked on the dovoted heads of the
vanquished (heroes. One of the un
fortunate Irish patriots escaped to Nor

THE FARMER'S WIFE.
[Tama Herald.]
Two opposing views of the status
of a farmer's wife come out of the
middle west. A vague statement in
some "woman's column" by a senti
mental writer "that it is a fond dream
of mine to become a farmer's wife and
meander down life's pathway," drew
this comment from a country editor:
"Oh, yes, that is a nice thing, but
when your husband meanders off and
leaves you without wood and you
have to meander up and down the lane
pulling splinters off the fence to cook
the dinner and you meander around
in the wet clover in search of the cows
until your shoes are the color of the
setting sun, and each stocking absorbs
a pint of water, and when y«?u meand
er out across twenty acres of plbwed
ground to drive the cows out of the
buckwheat and tear your dress on a
wire fence, and when you meander
back to the house ^nd find that the
goat has butted your child until it re
sembles a pumpkin, and find the old
hen
and sixteen chickens in the par
lor, the cat in the cupboard and the
dog in the milk, you will realize, dear
girl, that this mea.ider business is
not what it is cracked up to be." The
other view—the optimistic one—can
be set forth as follows: A cheery
person can picture farm life so idylic—
that the farmer, on rising in the
morning, does not disturb his wife,
but says good morning into the
boudoir phonograph. He may add
a hint as to what he would like to
have for breakfast whein he returns
from his automobile ride about the
farm. At eight o'clock the maid calls
•the farmer's wife, and by half past
nine she has a telephone call from
her husband, over on the northwest
quarter, saying thai he will join her
In five minutes. At breakfast the
morning papers are read, having come
by rural delivery a few minutes be
fore, and the wife announces the pro
gram for the day. It may be French,
music, physical culture or clubs. A
package of the latest nsvels, a ride
across' the country on a blooded mare,
skating in winter, golf in summer, a
lecture on art in the village hall—all
these things are set forthyas possibili
ties for the plutocratic nrmer's wife
in this state. And In the evening the
pianola puts Beethoven or Handel at
the lady's finger tips. The children
are put to bed, the governess dis
missed and a telephone conference
with the neighbors over the day's gos
sip is begun. The farmer reads his
favorite poet, and the night glides on.

How charmingly is Ireland looming

TOMATO CAN IN DIPLOMACY.
Knocked,OC Jap Profeaaor'a Slllc Hat
and Nearly Embroiled Natlona.
The boy who threw a tomato can
and thereby created an international
Incident has been found, says a San
Francisco special dispatch to the New
Yor". "Unes. He is Sidney Marks of
San .aucisco, formerly a special de
livery postal messenger. It was Sid
ney who threw the tin can which
knocked the silk hat from the head of
Professor Omorl. That Incident came
to the knowledge of President Boose
velt and, it is understood in San Fran
cisco, was the circumstance which de
cided him to let the Japanese para
graphs in his message stand against
protests by many of his advisers.
Professor Omorl, who is one of the
most distinguished of living seismolo
gists, was studying the results of the
earthquake near the San Francisco
postoffice when the tomato can, aim
ed with perfect accuracy, knocked his
hat off. It was known that the can
was thrown by one of a number of
boys in the employ of the postoffice
who had stopped the professor. The
postal superintendent called the boys
together and ordered them to tell who
was the culprit Each professed ab
solute Ignorance of the affair. The
superintendent then adopted more sub
tle means of getting at the truth. He
told the boys to write the name of the
offender on slips of paper, which were
deposited In a hat. With complete
unanimity the boys named Marks. He
saw what was coming and wrote his
own name on the slip which had been
handed to him. Thereupon he was
bounced.
Sidney's own account of the Incident
Is interesting, not only as. history of
the Japanese-American trouble, but
also because it furnishes material for
philologists who are Interested in the
comparative slang of the Atlantic and
the Pacific coasts. By way of ex
planatory preface it should be 6et forth
that "Skippie" Is an epithet applied to
a Japanese in San Francisco.
Sidney says:
"It was this way. There was a bunch
of ua out behind the postoffice, when one
of the gang yells: 'Pipe the skippie under
the dicer! Let's soak 'im!' We let loose
for fair, me to be the. lucky boy. I bounc
ed a can off his sky piece. He was sure
sore. But we sent him down the alley
after the naughty boy who did hini
wrong. I guess the naughty boy thing
did not go with the skippie, 'cause Mr.
Fiske called us up and gave us a chan«e
to tell who did it.
"Say, the way the gang came through
at first was great—nothln" doln'. Then
Mr. Fiske he ses each kid must write the

slg on my paper. See?
"Say, do you know what was In that
hat? Little Sidney was a redhot favor
ite with every vote. That guess I laid on
the candy boys:' feet saved my reputation,
and I was due for the can anyhow. Say,
didn't the president put me name In his
message after I done something to give
him a chance to talk? No? That's pret
