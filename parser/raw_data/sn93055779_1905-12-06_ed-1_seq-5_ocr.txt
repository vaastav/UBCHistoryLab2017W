REGULAI I IN OF TRUSTS
So long as the finances of the nation
are kepi lip m an honest, basis no other
question of Internal economy with which
the congress bus the power to ileal
begins lo approach in Importance the
matter of endeavoring to secure proper
Industrial conditions under winch the
Individuals, and especially the great
corporations, doing an Interstate busi-
ness are lo act. The makers of our I
national constitution provided especial
ly that the regulation of interstate com- j
mere should come w ith n the sphere of
the general government. The argu
ments iu favor of their I, iking this
Stand were even then overwhelming, j
but they are far Stronger today, in view
of the enormous development of great
business agencies, usually corporate in
form. Experience lias shown conclu
sively thai it is useless to try to get
any adequate regulation ami super
vision of these great corporations by
stale action. Such regulation and su
pervision can only be effectively exer
cised by a sovereign w hose Jurisdict ion
is coextensive wiili the held of work of
the corporation that is, by the nation
al government, i believe that this reg
ulation ami supervision can be obtain
ed by the enactment of law by the con
gross, if this proves Impassible, it will
certainly be necessary ultimately t
confer In fullest form sin-h power upon
ihe national government by a proper
amendment of the constitution, it
would obviously be unw Isc to endeavor
to secure such an amendment until it
is certain that the result cannot be ob
tained under the Constitution as it now
i-. 'ihe laws of the congress and of
the several states hitherto, as passed
npOS by the courts, have resulted more
often in showing that the stales have
no power in the matter than that (he
" national government has power; so
that there at present exists a very un
fortunate condition of thlmrs, under
which these great corporations doing
SO Interstate business occupy the po

Istlng conditions with which it is desir

most important provision which such
law should contain is that e inferring
upon, some cumin-tent administrative
body the power to decide, upon the case
i cing brought before it. Whether 0 given
r
full Uivestlgatlon of the complaint, to
prescribe the limit of rate beyond
which it shall not lie lawTul to go the
maximum reasonable rate, as it is com
monly called this decision to gi into

Obtain from thence onward, subject to
review by the courts. II sometimes
Happens at present, not that n rate N
loj high, bin that a favored shipper Is
given too low a rat. In such case the
commission would have the right to lix
this already established minimum rate
as the maximum, ami il would need
only one or two such decisions by the
commission to cure railroad companies
of tho practice of i lag improper min
imum rates. I call your attention lo
the fact that my proposal is not to giv e
the commission power to initiate or
originate rat. generally, but to regu
late a rale already lived or originated
by tin- roads upon complaint ml after
Investigation. A. beav pesalty should
be exaeled from any Corporation which
f.dls to respect an order of the commis

a uMXunuti rat as being essential to

an evasion of the law. The commis

I urge upon tlie congress Ihe need of
providing for expeditious BCtion by the
Interstate commerce commission in all
these matters, whether in regulating
rales for transportation or for storing

not merely of some few rich men, but
of a multitude of small iincstors, a
multitude of railway employes. Wage
workers, and mosl severely against the
interest of Ihe public as a whale. I b"
lieve thai on the whole our railroads
have done wed and QOl ill. but the
railroad men who wish to do well
should not be exposed lo competition
with those who bar no such das Ire,
and tlie only way to SSl'UIB this end it
lo give to MUM government tribunal
the power to see that Justice is dona

WOOld be most unwise. It is true that
some judges have misused this power,
but this does not justify n denial of the

a labor leader would justify the denial
of ihe right to strike. The remedy is
to regulate the procedure by requiring
the Judge to give due notice to the ad

the hearing to be ex parte if the ad
verse party does not appear at the time
and place ordered. What is due notice
must depend Upon the facts of (ho

It has been only too clearly shown

only complete remedy for this condi

the growth of n spirit which condemns

I LDLRAL l.LECTIONS
i
to repeat this recommenda
tion- In political campaigns In a coun
try as large and populous as ours It Is
Inevitable that there should be much
expense of an entirely legitimate kind.
This, of SOUrse, means (hut Uiauy con
tribntions. ami some of them of large
size, must be made, ami. as a matter
of fact, In any big political contest such
contributions me always made to both
sides. It is entirely proper both lo
give and receive them unless (here Is
an improper motive connected with
Cj1(., Kifl ,
reception, if they are ex
torted by any kind of pressure or prom
ise, express or implied, direct or indi
rect, In the way of favor or Immunity,
(hen tin- giving or receiving becomes
not only Improper, hut criminal. It
will undoubtedly be difficult as u mat
ter of practical detail tO shape an act
which shall guard with reasonable cer
lainty against such misconduct, but if
ll Is possible lo secure by law the full
and verified publication in detail of all
the sums contributed to ami expended
by (he candidates or committees of uuy
political parties the resull cannot but
be wholesome. All colli rf bill lous by
corporations to any political committee
or for any political purpose should be
forbidden by law, directors should not
be permitted to use stockholders' mon
ey for such purposes, aud, moreover, a
prohibition of this kind would lie, as
Car us It wenl, an effect l clhod of
-topping (he evils aimed at iu corrupt
practices nets. Not only should lH,th
the national and ihe sewral slate leg
; Islatures forbid any officer of a eor
I poratioti from using the money of the
corporation in or about any election, but
they should also forbid such us? of
money in connection with any legisla
tion save by the employment of coun
sel In public manner for distinctly lejjnl
services.

NATLKM IsllO.N LAWS
llnr nc the pant year eVidence ba se-
eomulateil to confirm the expression
contained in my last two annual mes
Mge a to the importance of ret iring
by appropliatr legialatHu W sjstem
or naturalizing aliens, i appotntet!iasf
March a commission lo make a careful
examination of our naturalization laws
and to suggest appropriate measures to
avoid the notorious abuses resulting
frsm the Improvident or unlawful
granting of citizenship. This commis
sion, composed of an officer of ihe de
partment of state, of the department of
justice and of the department of com
merce and labor, has discharged the
duty Imposed upon il and has submit
ted a report, which will be transmitted
lo the congress for its consideration
and. I hope, for Its favorable action.
The distinguishing recommendations
of the c lUimission are:
First. A federal bureau of naturali
zation, to be established in the depart
ment of commerce and labor, to su
pervise the administration of the natu
ralization laws and lo receive returns
of naturalizations pending and accom
plished. s icond. Uniformity of naturalization
certificates, fees to be
irged, and pro-
cedure.
Third. More exaciing
lualiflcatlons
for citizenship.
Fourth. "The preliminary declaration
of Intention to be abolished aud no
alien lo be naturalized until at least
ninety days after the Hling of his peti
tion. FifthJurisdiction to naturalize
aliens to be confined to I nited States
district courts aud to such state courts
as have Jurisdiction iu civil actions In
which the amount Iu controversy la un
limited; In cities of over liNl.oOO inhab
itants (he United States district courts

such cities.
VilSSISSIPP LEVEES
The national government already
does something iu connection with the
construction and mainlcuauce of t In
great system of levees along the lower
course of the .Mississippi. In my Judg
ment, it should do much more.
CHINESE IMMIGRATION
The questions arlatBg iu eounoetiou
with Chinese Immigration staud by
themselves, ihe conditions iu China
are such that (lie entire Chinese cooly
class- hat is, the class of Chinese la
borers, skilled and unskilled legiti
mately come under the bend of unde
sirable immigrants to this country be
cause of their numbers, (lie low wages
for which tl','' work ami their low
standard of living. Not ouly Is it to
the interest of this (ouutry to keep
them out, but ihe Chinese authorities
do not desire that they should be ad
mitted. At present their entrance is
prohibited by laws amply adequate to
accomplish (his puriiosc. These laws
have been, are being and will be thor
oughly Sllforced, The violations of
them are so few In number as to be lll
finllsalmil and can he eutirely disre
garded. Then Is no serious proposal
lo alter the Immigration law as regards
the Chinese laborer, skilled or unskill
ed, and there is no excuse for any man
feeling or effecting to feel the slightest
alarm on the subject.
Rul in the effort to carry out the pol
icy of excluding Chinese laborers, Chi
nese coolies, grave Injustice aud wrong
have leen done by this nation to the
people of China and (herefore ultimate
ly to this nation Itself. Chinese stu
dents, business und pro-ssional men
of all kinds not only merchants, but
bankers, doctors, manufacturers, pro
fessors, travelers and the like should
lie encouraged to come here and treat
ed on precisely the same footing that
era treat students, business men, trav-
i elers ami the like of other nations.
Our laws and treaties should be framed
not so as to put these people in tho ex-
i i cpied elusses. but to state that wo
w ill admit all i umese except cmneso
of the cooly class, Cbluese skilled or
unskilled laborers. There would not
he the least danger thai any such pro-
ision would result in any relaxation
of the law almut laborers. These will
under all conditions be kept out abso
luteiy. But it will be more easy to
see that bath Justice and courtesy are
shown, us they ought lo !e shown, to
other Chinese if the law or treaty Is
framed as nliove suggested. Examina
tion should be completed at the port
of departure from Cblua. for this pur
jiose there should be provided a more
adequate consular service In China
than we now have. The appropria ' ms
both for the office of the consuls and
for the office force in the consular
should lx? Increased.
A Qutition of Equity.
As a people we have talked mu h of
the open door In China and we expec
and quite rightly intend to insist upon
Justice being shown u by the Chinese.
But we cannot expect to receive equity
unless we do equity. We cannot ask
the CfclaesM to do to us whst we are un
willing io do lo tbera. They would have
a tcrfcct right to exclude oor laboring
if our laboring men threatened to
come lata their country in such num
ber as to Jeopardise ihe well being of
the Cblneee imputation, and as. mutatis
mutandis, throe were the condKMsax
with which Chinese immigration aetasl
! brought this people face to face we
had and have a perfect right, which the
I railtit Iu no way con
test, fci set s we have acted In the
mailer f restricting cooly immigration.
That 1tr r .-hi exist for each country
w explicitly acknowledged In the last
tn stv between the two countries. But
w must treat the Chinese student,
traveler and huin man In a pit
f the broadest justve and courtesy If
we npect similar treatment ty be ac
corded to our own people of similar
rank who go to China. Much trouble
