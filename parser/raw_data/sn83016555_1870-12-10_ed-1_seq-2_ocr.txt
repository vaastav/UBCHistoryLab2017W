OFFICIAL JOUR NAL OF THE U NITED STATES
OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF NEW ORLEANS
d«Ttn*r WtnBtft*
We copy the following from the Red
River yew* :
Perhaps there is 'not a Governor in the
hroad expanse of the United States who
has had more difficulties to overcome, more
advene circumstances to contend against,
than the chief magistrate of Louisiana.
Though comparatively young in years, he
has exhibited wisdom, firmness, judgment
and ability worthy of one of riper age. Yet
there are those who, 'notwithstanding the
Governor's record, notwithstanding the in
eontrovertibility of facts, persist in assail
ing his public as well as private character.
Yet Ms course has brought to the State
oeace out of disorder, prosperity out ol
poverty and ruin. Such is the record of one
who fills an exalted, honorable position, and
who is sustained in his principles and acts
by a majority of the citizens of the State.
These shafts of malice and prejudice glance
harmlessly from the steel mail of rectitude
of purpose which clothes his person and
proclaims him beyond the injurious accusa
tions which are constantly hurled at him.
It is not surprising that those who are
particularly opposed to him should fiercely
assail his character. It is astonishing, how
ever, that man who call themselves, not
only Republcans, but even Christian. Repub
licans, should descend into the vile cess
pool of scurrility to attaok his acts and
saying that hois followed by parar
sites, satellites and tools whom he uses lor
self-aggrandizement and to achieve am
bitious projects. These must assuredly be
Chririian sentiments, as they emanate from
a journal which claims something of god
liness. Save the mark!
To-day our State affairs could be en
trusted to worse hands than those of Gover
nor Wannoth. The record of the past- two
years, daring his administration, attest the
wisdom of his rule; not only so, but the
prosperity and peace which have been
evoked out of poverty and disorder. 1 hese
art incontrovertible facta, and men should
see them in their true light, and not look at
them through the glasses of jaundiced, pre
judices. a _
Immigration.
We copy this very sensible article from
the Opelousas Journal:
Of hbout nine hundred immigrants who
to jived at Hew Orleans on the steamship
Frankfort, the New Orleans Republican
says: "About five hundred of them are
■shag to Texas to engage in farming, and
nearly all the rest go up West. Tlie Re
publican asks: " Why is it Louisiana can
Dot h ol «* out sufficient inducements for those
tjtho arrive here to remain and settle down."
, About two years ago we had an " Immi
society" in St. Landry. It died a
time after its organization from
ct It should have been a permanent
tail with proper and persistant efforts
on the part of its members, immigration
could have been induced to our parish in
the course of time. The society, during its
short existence, did some good, but it was
rmi y the germ of what might have been
accomplished by this time.
It seems our people prefer paying taxes
on lands they are unable to cultivate, to
giving part of them or selling them to im
migrants at low rates. It is difficult for
some people to see their own prosperity in
that of the public. .They do not under
stand that land not only useless but ex
pensive to them, if given or sold cheaply to
immigrants, would be like bread cast iidob
the waters to be found after many day*. This
plan would not only increase the general
prosperity of the country, but would
greatly enhance the value of the remaining
hinds.* And we liclieve this the only plan,
except the building of a railroad through
pur midst, that wiU bring us immigration
in a reasonable time. A railroad might in
duce immigrants to pay higher prices tor
lands, on account of the early profit they
could derive from them; but, as things now
stand, immigrants will go where lands are
cheap. _ _ _
Land Grant Scheme,
Washington, December 6.—The first
thing like business to come up in Congress
this session was a land grant scheme. It
was a joint resolution, reported in July, to
extend the time for the completion of a
road in Minnesota, and to come up in the
'House in the regular order as unfinished
business.
This js one of those oases in which a land
grant Is in danger of being forfeited by non
completion of the road within a specified
time. *
The arguments advanced in its support
Uv Mr. Wilson, of Minnesota, and Mr.
Washburne, of Wisconsin, were the usual
ones—hard times—faith of government—
settlements om lands purchased at high
prices—necessity for the road—and it was
.rather quick, after the strong language of
ilje President's message, to push a bill
through.
Messrs. Julian. Lawrence 'and VVood, of
New York, made strenuous opposition—Mr.
Wood on general grounds, and the others on
particular features of the bill as well.
j Sir. Eli offered an amendment providing
for grants of lands to aid the construction
of certain proposed railroads in New Hamp
shire, one of which would, he said, pqas
through the beet granite eectipn in the
country—an open and short route to the
seaboaol-puxd .afforded cheap and rapid
transportation for good stone to Minnesota,
and for gofid lumber to New Hampshire; hut
the Minnesota people would not give New
Hampshire any help, and after an hour's
debate the resolution was laid on the table,
by a vote of eight.v-nine to eighty. The mo
tion to lav on the table a motion to recon
sider wda'lost. and the matter was tempor
arily disposed of by postponing it until next
Tuesday! after the morniug hour, when
there wilbbe another struggle, the fate of
which WiH- probably decide the fate of any
similar proposition. If it were out-and-out
new grant, and not aft'ecting other interests
in a peculiar way, it would have small
• chance of success'.
.4 most painful affair occurred in Cooke
county. Texas, some two weeks since, the 1
particulars of whieh are given in the last
number of the Gainesville Gazette. It ap
pears that a citizen of the county, a Mr. Ed
ward Brothers, left home on business, to he
gone all day. During the day Willie
Brothers, a Sprightly three year old boy,
went to the cotton pen in the* field and was
plying upon the cotton, and, becoming
tired, tell asleep. Some of the other children
had occasion to go to the pen, and seeing
Willie and hearing a strange noise (it is sup
posed tlie little boy was snoring), became
alarmed, and ran back to those at work and
communicated their fears. They all assem
bled near the cotton pen, and, upon hearing
the same strange noise, concluded that it
was some wild beast. They were confirmed
in this by-tlie hat of the child, whir'll they
mistook lor some animal's head. One of
them was.dispatched for the gun, while the
others kept watch. The gun was soon
brought forward and placed in the hands of
one of tlio oldest hoys, it was soon leveled,
aimed and fired at, what was supposed to
be, the wild animal. The ball took effect in
the head of the sleeping child, killing him
instantly. The mistake was soon discov
ered, and Mr. Brothers arrived at the ' spot
just in time to see his dead boy, and to wit
ness the heartrending grief of ILe whole
family lor the littlo one.
They have neck-tie sociables in Montana.
Every lady, upon entering the door, is re
quired to give tlie door-keeper an envelope
containing a neck-tie made of the same
material as the dress she wears that even
ing; to be made in any conceivable shape,
and trimmed as _ she chooses. Every gen
tleman i ays fifteen cents at the door, and
receives a check for a neek-tie. and after
wards the neckties are distributed to the
check-holders. After receiving his new
article of dress, each gentleman commences
a search for the lady whpinqde it. and, after
finding her, shows his*gratitmle by treating
her to oysters, cake, peaches, etc.
The Baton Rouge Grand Era says:
Our wharf is literally covered with bales
-. i>f cotton, hogsheads of sugar, and.manulac
' tnred articles from the State Penitentiary,
convincing the passing stranger that Baton
Rouge la not the little one-horse town many
aapposc it to be.

turnpikes, plank roads, terries, or obstructions of
any Kind by which expense may be incurred. No

creased.
11. Bidders are cautioned to mail their proposals
in time to reach the Department bv the day and
Lour named (3 P. M.. March l ( ltf71), for bids re

competition \r.th bids of reasonable amount re
ceived in time. Neither can bids be considered
* liich are without the guarantee required by law,
and a certificate of the sufficiency of such guaran
tee.
12. Bidders should first propose for service strict
ly according to the advertisement, and then, if
they desire, separately for different service; and if
the* regular bid lie the lowest offered for the adver
tised service, tlie other propositions maybe con
sidered.
13. There should be but one route bid for in a
proposal, ton soli dated or combination bids ("pro
posing one sura for -two or more routes''/ are for
bidden by law, and can not be considered.
14. The route, the service, the yearly pay, the
name and residence of the bidder (that is, his usual
postoffice addre ss), and the name of ea<ch member
of a firm, where a company offers, should be dis
tinctly stated. .
15. Bidders are requested to use, as far g* prac
ticable, the printed proposals furnished by the De
j»i;i tment, to write out iu full the sum of their bids,
and to retain copies of them.
Altered bids should not be submitted, no^ should

daw for receiving proposals.
Each bid must be guaranteed by two responsible
perootis. The bid and guarantee should .be signed

The Department reserves the r'gnt to reject any
bid which may be de* med extravagant, and also to
disregard tbe bds of fa .'.ing contractors and bid
ders. (Act of July 2, 283b, section 24.)
lb The bid should be e«-q}ed, superscribed " Mail
Proposals. State ol'Louisiana," addressed " Second

on the mail day next after it, whether the contracts
be executed of not.
Transfers of contra "ts, or of interest in contracts,
are forbidden by law. and consequently eun not be
allowed. Neither can bids, or interest in bids, be
transferred or assigned toother parties. Bidders

to perform The serv'ce accepted \o them through
the whole term of the contract.
18. Section eighteen of an act of Congress approve
March 3, 1845, provides that contracts tor the
transportation of the mail shall be let, "in every
case, to the lowest bidder tendering sufficient
guarantees tor faithful performance, without other
reference to the mode of such transportation than
may be necessary to provide for the due celerity,
ci ftaintv, and security of such transportation."
Und r this law bids that propose to transport the
mails with u celerity, certainty, and security," hav
ing been decided to be the only legal bids, are con
strued as providing for the e ntire mail, however
large, and whatever maybe the mode of convey
ance necessary to insure its " celerity, certainty,
and security," and have the preference over all
others, and 'no others are considered, except for
steamboat routes.
13. A modification of a bid in any of its essential
terms is tantamount to a new bid. and ean not be
received so as to interfere with regular rompeti
tion.^Making a new bid, with guarantee and cer
tificate L* tlu only way to modify a previous bid.
20. Dost masters an* to be eareiul not to certify to
tbe sufficiency of guarantors without know ing that
they are persons of sufficient responsibility. They
must not sign the certificate until the sum of the
bid is inserted, and the bid and guarantee ave
signed by the bidder and (two) guarantors; a dis
regard of this instruction by postmasters i.s a vio
lation of their oath of office, subjecting them to
immediate removal.
21. All bidders, guarantors and sureties are dis
tinctly notified that on n failure to enter into or
perform the contracts for the service proposed for
in the accepted bide, tlicir legal liabilities will be
enforced against them.
22. Present contractors and persons known at
tbe Department, must, equally with others, pro
cure guarantors and certificates of their sufficiency
substantially in tbe forms above prescribed. The
certificate of sufficiency must be signed by a post
master, or by a Judge of a court of record; no other
will be admitted. ^
