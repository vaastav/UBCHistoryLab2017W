THE REPORT OF THE TARIFF COM
MISSION.
The Tariff Commission has submitted its
report, and it is said to recommend reduc
tions in the tariff averaging '2"> per cent.
Of v une it ie not poßfeible in the absence
of details to say w! at these reductions
amount to, but if we may judge from the
known character of the Commission, the
ultimate purpose is to throw a sop to the
tariff reformers, and thus save the bulk cf
the imposts. The reductions announced
may, when the actual facts are at hand,
prove to be a mere blind. It is more
likely that this is the case than that a
Commission packed in the interests of
Protection should pfopose a genuine re
form measure. But it is to be expected
that the report of the Tariff Commission
will not cut a very important figure in the
coming deliberations of Congres?. The
Republicans have no doubt learned some
thing from the late election?, and among
other things they have had it borne in
upon them that the people demand a thor
ough revision of the tariff. Besides, if the
Republicans are afraid to tackle that ques
tion they know that the Democrats will
come after them and make all the capital.
And therefore they are liktly to favor a
larger reduction than '_'."> per cent.
AND NOW FRANCE TAUNTS US.
The weakness of our navy exposes us to
taunt aud insult whensver we undertake
to assume the dignity cf a great nation in

that the United States Government has
addressed some remonstrance to Trance is
enough to call forth sneering comments
from the Fretch preßS upon the impotence
of our navy, and we are reminded that
France could destroy all our seaport towns.
Of course the fact that this is true does cot
make i; the more pleasant ; but we must
" grin and bear it," so long as Congress re
fuses to take any practical measures to reor
ganize the navy and pltce it upon a re
spectable footing.

THE PROSPECT FOR CIVIL SERVICE
REFORM
The President has given in his adhesion
to the principles of Civil Service reform,
and it remains to be teen whether Congress
will act upon his recommendation. The
fact that public opinion, as the President
states, has been already shown to demand
this reform, unfortunately does not of
necessity secure compliance with that
opinion. It is evident that the American
people are heartily tired of the spoils
system, but it is equally true that our
representative sy stern rests upon that
method of conducting politics. Tne diffi
culty therefore which presents itself to
every Coagrees is always the same. Men
are scarcely ever elected to Congress with
out being compelled to make a great many
promises in return for assistance. Almost
every member of Congress goes to Wash
ington weighted down with obligations to
political friends, and a very large percent
age of these political friends are men who
would have but a poor prospect if they
were compelled to re'.y upon their success
in competitive examinations, for obtaining
office. We loDg ago pointed cut the very
serious character of the difficulties in the
way ef reform, arising from this Btate of
things. However much the people may
demand reform, the men who can alone
enact it are hampered and embarrassed
from the outset, and almost pledged
against any such measure. The experience
of every I'resident has been identical with
President Arthur's. Tney all lind them-
Belves overwhelmed with the importunities
of office-seekers. The more conscientious
they are the sooner are they worn out with
the ungrateful labor. Bat thus tar no man
has been found strong enough and patient
enough to resist the temptation to get rid
of the respontibility by allowing the mem
bers of Congress to control appointments.
The kind of men who have been given
prominence in national politics through
the spoils system are not the kind of men
to throw down the ladJer by which they
have mounted. Indeed, to ask them to do
away with their own patronage is to ask
them to renounce all ambition, and to re
tire from politics, for there are very few ot
them who could secure a re election if
they had no army of official claijueurs at
their back to watch their interests in
their districts, and to " arrange " all the
party machinery with a view to the accom
plishment of tbeir desires. And this is the
real difficulty in the situation. Congresa
has come to be dependent upon the spoils
system. A generation of politicians have
been educated and trained under it. They
do sot understand any other methods.
Like poor old Thurlow Weed, they believe
it is the beet system in existence. A i.il so
it is for them ; for under a rational system
they would have to devote their energies
aud capacities to productive industry of
some kind, and would be forced to leave
politics to those who were able to rely upon
their own merits. But the Congress of to
day \i a body which understands nothing
but the epoils system, and which is too old
to learn. The question therefore is,
whether the fear of public opinion will be
powerful enough to overcome the fear of
political suicide, with these men.
It must be a lmitted that their position
ia extremely embarrassing. In fact, to use
a vulgar but forcible expression, they are
" between the devil and the deep sea." If
they do nothing about Civil Service reform
they must apprehend that their constitu
ents will retire them into private life. If
they do anything about Civil Service re
form they know that they will be inca
pacitated for re-election. In theee pecu
liar and discouraging circumstances, our
Congressmen cannot Le expected to ex
hibit much enthusiasm. Aad the position
is a bad one for the country also, for the
problem before it is how to induce & body
which lives by and through abuse, to abol
ish that abuse. It is truo that there are in
the present Congress an unusual number of
members who have already been defeated,
and who may therefore be disposed to
shed a certain spleador over their exit from
public life by assuming a virtue foreign to
their natures. This is one hope, though
we must c:nfes3 that it is a feeblo one.
But if nothing is done at this session for
reform, how can it be expected when the
Democrats come into power ? The Itopub
licans may be said, in the words of the
English I'oet Laureate, to have "dropped
"off gorged" from the public treasury.
But the Democrats are faint with famine,
and thtir eyes gleam hungrily as they scent
the prey. Is it to these starved and greedy
politicians that the country must look for
relief !
The Democrat?, moreover, are not com.
mitted to Civil Service reform as the Re
publicans are. Yet there is one avenue
of hope even here. The Administration
will remain Republican, and the President
cm, if he chooses, keep the Democratic
Congressmen from the public crib by refus
ing to let them dictate any appointments.
Under the smart of such a disappointment,
and from motives of revenge, they might
be induced to vote for the abolition of the
Federal patronage altogether. Whether
the I 'resident will so act as to encourage
them in that tendency is, however, very
problematical. No Executive has cvor
seemed to care greatly for contests with
Congress, and Arthur may prefer a qaiet
life to the doubtful public advantages of a
course which would be open to miscon
struction. On the whole, therefore, it
appears probable that unless Civil Service
reform is established at the session which
has just been opened, the country will have
bo wait for it some time longer. (); course
it is possible that the Republicans may
suddenly aad unexpectedly develop a noble
spirit of self sacrifice, and piss the Pendle
ton or some other bill of the kind. This
is possible, but we are constrained to ad
mit that we do not regard it as highly
probable. And yet if the Republicans do
nothing in the premises this seasioc, it will
be almost hopeless to thii.k of rehabilita'
ing the party in time for the next Presi
dential election.
THE GARFIELD PHYSICIANS.
The statement of Dr. U'.iss as to the dis-
proportionateness of the amount offered
him, with the income he sacrificed in ordtr
to attend upon President Gartield, may be
a good ground for scoffing commen*, but
we fail to perceive it if it is so. It appears
to us that in euch a case it was the clear
duty of the committee appointed to audit
the claims of the physicians, to ascertain
what their services were worth ; and that
no other means of ascertaining this could
i>e resorted to than an examination of their
practice. If a physician is making §10,
--000 a year, and he is called in to attend a
President, and thus loses three months'
time and revenue, and has his connection
broken up, he ought, upon any business
consideration, to be paid not only for the
actual loss of revenue incurred, bet for
the farther injury resulting freni the
breaking up of his clientage. Now if the
representations of Dr. Bliss as to his income
fre-n his practice are correct, and we pre
tzms that there is so reason to doubt hi 3
integrity, it follows that the sum offered
him by Congteeq is altogether inadequate,
and that he is fully jus'.itied in feeling
wronged and insulted by the offer. This
remark of course &ppUes with equal
or greater force to the cases
of l>rs. Agnew and Hamilton, for
their practice is very n.uch n.ore lucrative
than that of Dr. Bliss, and they must have
incurred correspondingly greater losses.
In matters of this kicd legislative bodies
are very apt to exhibit a mean parii.
mony, and UDcler pretense of guarding the
public interests they not infrequently com
mit seriou3 wrongs. Considering the wan
ton and lavish recklessness with which
Congress has been tlingiug about the money
of the people in the Pension Arrears swin
dle, in the Pv'.ver and Harbor bill, and in
the tariff, this pretense of economy in the
matter of Uattield's physicians is gro
tesquely inconsifct-.nt and abaurJ. If, how
ever, through the refusal of Congress to do
justica to the physicians who attended
upon the late President, the estate of the
deceased should have to bear the expenses,
it would be a nation il disgrace. And yet,
after the spectacle of the dishonest and
shameless retention of the Japanese In
demnity Fund, even thia ought not to sur
prise any one.
HERE'S WISDOM.
The comments of the London press upon
the President's Message have a very odd
flavor. They suggeat to us Professor Z j)l
--ner'a puzzling proposition of the way
three-dimecsicaal things would appear to a
being living in four- dimensional space.
Our English critics really do not seem to
poetess the faintest conception of Ameri
can politics or affairs. From the Timen
down they exhibit what c rlain theolo
gians call "invincible ignorance." Why
I'rcßident Arthur's Message should have
appeared to theae I.jnbsys a clear indica
tion that the Republican party has g^ne tc
the dogs, it is absolutely impossible to con
ceive. It is equally impossible to under
stand what the T&mn means by saying
that the President has "placed himself at
the head of the stalwart party, and sue
"ceeded in detaching from the Republican
"connection the reformers and independ
"enta who, if few in numbers, are amone
" the moefremineiit for capacity and char
acter." Few, in Dumber! We wonder
what Judge Fitger will thick of that ta
pient observation. But the whole of the
English comments are mysterious to the
last degree, and "wonderful past all
whooping," as an Elizabethan writer
phraeea it.

The Secretary of War's Report.
Washington, December s',h. — The report
of the Secretary of War shows that the ex
psauHnreß for the year ending June, 18S>
were .?■!•">, 349,000. The appropriations for the
year ending next; .Tnne &re 155.667,000. Tha
estimates for 1534 are SSS^'JS.OOO. These
figures do not inclu is tho river and harbor
work or the -M ----- j ; ;' river work. The
General of the Army atrontdy urges an in
crease to 30.000 men. The soldiers are over
worked, and the companies ar3 too small for
di-ciplice or real economy. The force has
b?en increased" in New Mexico and Arizona,
« hers tho Apiche outbreaks occurred, and
the time is at hand when Congress should
make permanent provision!* for comfortable,
permanent [mats at important strsjetic points'.
The various disbursements are fully treated!
The cxtenaba and further perfection cf the
Signal Bervin are urged, and the report con
cludes with some recommendations for an in
crease of salaries.
Strong Nerves an Attainable Blessing.
There are many who have never known the

with weak ones. Those who have, and
through disease or some other canse have
suffered a loss of nerve power, can, by coc
tra?t, mere fully appreciate the magnitude of
that losb. The trus way to repair it is to in
vigorate the system through the medium of
imprcved digestion, secretion, and the estab
lishment of a regular habit of body, three
results invariably accomplished by the use of
Etostetter's Stoaatoh Bitters, which insures
the thorough ronver.'ion of the food into pure,
nourishing blood, frora which tha nerves, in
common with every other part ot tue bodily
econorr.y, gather vigor, the grand prerequi
site of health. The great objection to eeda
tivea and narcotics is, that they not only ex
ert uo tonic influence, but aro slwavs followed
by a hurtful reccti'-n. Su?h U far from being
