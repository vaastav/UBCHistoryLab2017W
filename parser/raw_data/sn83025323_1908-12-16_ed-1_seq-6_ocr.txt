COKCR SS TO PRONE
PRESIDENT'S WORDS
HOUSE PASSES RESOLUTION TO
APPOINT COMMITTEE OF IN
VESTIGATION.
ACTION BY SENATE
SOON TO FOLLOW
Representative Perkins Points Out
That Disregard of Criticisms Might
Argue for Lack of Respect-DecI
sion of Caucus Closely Followed.
Washington, Dec. 12.-Immediately
after the convening of the house Fri
day Representative Perkins of New
York introduced a resolution, which
had heretofore been agreed upon, pro
viding for the appointment of a spe
cial committee of five members to
consider the proper means of dealing
with that portion of the president's
message which criticises the course of
congress in prohibiting the detail of
secret service men to duty outside of
their own bureau. The resolution is
preceded by a preamble reciting some
expressions of the message. No ef
fort is made to give voice to the feel
ing of the house. The resolution was
passed.
House Takes Action.
In presenting the resolution, Mr.
Perkins made a brief statement saying
that he was satisfied that the house
would not hesitate to take such ac
tion as the dignity of that body re
quired. He said that some of the pres
ident's expressions were misleading.
In submitting the resolution, Mr. Per
kins said that the statements by the
president could not be lightly disre
garded, as they might impair the use
fulness of the congress; that undue
obtuseness might argue a lack of
proper self-respect. A resolution
similar to that passed by the house
probably will be adopted by the sen
ate early next week. It will provide
for the appointment of a committee
to recommend a course of action rela
tive to the president's utterances.
No Debate on Appropriations.
When the legislative appropriation
bill was called up in the house of rep
resentatives Friday by Mr. Bingham
of Pennsylvania the extraordinary sit
uation was presented that for the first
time in 12 years no general debate
was asked for. Even the first read
ing of the bill was dispensed with by
unanimous consent.
Mr. Bingham, having the measure
in charge, explained its provisions,
the main features of which already
have been printed. Its reading for
amendment then was begun.

METCALF LAUDS WORLD CRUISE
NAVY REPORT TELLS OF GOOD
DONE BY LONG VOYAGE.
Ships Maintain Standard Time-Take
Care of Own Repairs and Make
Many Friends.
Washington, Dec. 12.-The world
cruise of the Atlantic fleet is given the
first place in the
annual report of
the secretary of
the navy, made
public Friday. The
report is signed
by Victor H. Met
calf, the retiring
secretary, his sne
cessor, Truman H.
Newberry, " having
taken ofcice only
a few days ago.
"An epoch-making
cruise," is the way
V. H. Metcalf. the trip of the
battleship fleet is described.
Late in the spring of 1907, says the
report, it was decided to send the At
lantic fleet on a practice cruise to the
Pacific. When the purpose of giving
the assemblage of 16 battleships such
a practice cruise, under severe condi
tions, was announced, says the secre
tary, criticism from high technical
quarters was heard. The undertak
ing, it was said, was too monumental;
dangers more than multiplied with
numbers in such a case; battleships
should not be sent around the globe
on any ordinary occasion; the skele
tons of some of them would doubtless
be left in the Straits of Magellan; and
if the ships should round South Amer
ica, they would, one by one, arrive
with machineries loose and unservice
able, and with crews reflecting the
condition and the material.
The facts are, Mr. Metcalf says, that
the ships maintained schedule time,
and have practically taken care of
their own repairs on this cruise. The
repairs list sent in at the naval sta
tion, Cavite, P. I., has just been re
ceived, and is significant. It shows
that after the voyage to the distant
borders of the Pacific, the needed re
pairs are negligible. The perform
ance of the Oregon, in 1893, has, it
seems, been substantially repeated.
This cruise, while hardly half over,
he declares, gave opportunity to get
better acquainted with republics to
the south of us, with our own island
possessions, with the new and vigor
ous branch of the British empire in
Australia, and particularly with
Japan; and has given to those coun
tries a better opportunity to get ac
quainted with us. It has been every
where understood and accepted as it
was intended, as the reaching out of
a strong hand in friendly greeting on
the part of America, and the cordial
hospitalities extended to our fleet will
be long remembered, and have power
fully influenced feeling in this
country.
MANIAC HOLDS TOWN IN TERROR.
Alleged "John the Baptist" Runs
Amuck at Edgewater, N. J.
Edgewater, N. J., Dec. 12.-Shouting
that he was "John the Baptist, come
to save the world," an aged insane
man held this town in terror for
nearly an hour Friday afternoon. He
rushed down the main street, waving
a revolver and shouting, held up half
a dozen citizens, robbed the tills of
three business establishments, stole a
team of horses and exchanged many
shots with a hastily-formed posse. His
wild career was checked when he was
bowled over by shots fired by mem
bers of the posse after a chase of
more than half a mile.
After his capture the man said his
name was Arthur S. Pomeroy and
that he came from Nebraska. It is
believed that he escaped recently
from a sanitarium at Stamford, Conn.
Pomeroy was shot twice, but his
wounds are not regarded as serious.
He will be removed to the state in
sane asylum at Morris Plains.
FIVE DEAD IN FANATIC BATTLE.

GOILTY OF BRIBERY
FORMER POLITICAL LEADER IN
SAN FRANCISCO CONVICTED
ON GRAVE CHARGE.
NEW CAPITAL CASE
TRIALS ARE DENIED
Pennsylvania Graft Convictions Against
Prominent Former Officials Re
fused by Harrisburg Court-Appeal
to lie Filed Before Higher Judiciary.
San Francisco, Dec. 12.-Abraham
Ruef, former political boss of San
Francisco, was convicted of bribery.
The verdict was returned exactly up
on the stroke of four o'clock when the
deliberations of the jury had been pro
longed throughout a period of 24
hours.
The warnings of Judge William P.
Lawlor and the vigilance of the po
lice checked all attempted demonstra
tion, although the excitement in the
courtroom was so intense that men
were thrust down into their seats or
held in the grasp of detectives as they
rose to obtain a better view of the
proceedings.
Impressive Scene in Court.
As the jury filed into the, courtroom
and took their seats in the jury box,
Judge Lawlor asked Foreman Mc
Namara:
"Have you gentlemen reached a
verdict?"
"We have," replied the foreman as
he handed a folded slip of paper to
Clerk Welch. An impressive silence
followed. Attorneys, defendant, spec
tators, detectives and police held their
breath as the clerk slowly and delib
erately, yet with apparent agitation,
unfolded the paper and then, as every
Abe Ruef.
eye in the courtroom was riveted upon
him, read the words: "We, the jury,
find the defendant, Abraham Ruef,
guilty as charged."
Immediately all arose to their feet.
There was a murmur of approval, but
no demonstration.
At the other end of the counsel
table, near the place where his blood
had dyed the floor a deep crimson
red which had been effaced with sand
paper, sat Francis J. Heney, who ap
peared in the courtroom for the first
time since the day he was shot.
No New Trial in Capitol Cases.
Harrisburg, Pa., Dec. 12.-A new
trial was refused to four of the de
fendants in the capitol conspiracy
cases Friday by Judge George Kunkle
in the Dauphin county court, before
which the men had been tried. The
defendants are John H. Sanderson,
Philadelphia, the contractor for the
furnishings and decorations in the
$13,000,000 capitol; James M. Shu
maker, Johnstown, who was superin
tendent of the board of public grounds
and buildings during the period of the
furnishing of the building; William P.
Snyder, Spring City, former auditor
general of the state, and William L.
Matheus, former state treasurer. These
men, with Joseph M. Huston, Philadel.
phia, the architect of the great build
ing, were charged with conspiracy to
cheat and defraud the state in con
nection with furnishing and decorating
the capitol, but Huston secured a
severance and his trial has not yet
come up.
Tried and Convicted.
The four defendants were tried last
spring and were convicted as charged.
They immediately appealed for a new
trial, but argument was not heard un
til after the Dauphin county court had
disposed of a second conspiracy trial
in which the defendants in the first
case were also among the accused and
were acquitted.
Several other defendants, of whom
there were 14 in all, remain to be
tried. One defendant died and an
other was removed to a sanitarium,
having broken down mentally during
his trial.
The capitol scandal is one of the
outcomes of the political revolution in
Philadelphia in 1905 following which
a Democratic state treasurer was
elected. He discovered and made pub
lic alleged irregularities and the pros
ecutions followed.

RECIPE FOR REAL TROUBLE.
Cheerfully Contributed to an Aiready
Unhappy World.
Trouble making is an older industry
than the manufacture of steel. Cain,
the trouble maker, got into action be
fore Tubal Cain, the iron worker;
and Eve got Adam into hot water long
before the Boiler Makers' union began
business.
There are three kinds of trouble
imaginary, borrowed and real.
Imaginary trouble consists of rail
road accidents, earthquakes, fires, sui
cides, the poorhouse, death, and the
grave, carefully mixed and taken
after a late dinner, or a drop in the
stock market.
Borrowed trouble is the kind we get
from our relatives. Its principal in
gredients are visits, borrowed money,
birthday presents, advice and expecta
tions. But the real article is pro
duced as follows: Put the sandals of
endurance on your feet, take your life
in your hands and follow by turn the

Grown-Up Children.
It is not only the frivolous whom
the spirit of childishness is just now
leading astray. Silliness is the fash
ion even among the wise. Women
especially affect a kind of childish
shrewdness in talking of serious sub
jects. Like children who have the
habit of romancing, they lose the
sense of reality, and because they nev
er talk exactly as they think they be
gin to think exactly as they talk.

CAUSE AND EFFECT
Good Digestion Follows Right Food.
Indigestion and the attendant dis
comforts of mind and body are cer
tain to follow continued use of improp
er food.
Those who are still young and
robust are likely to overlook the fact
that, as dropping water will wear a
stone away at last, so will the cue of
heavy, greasy, rich food, finanly cause
loss of appetite and indigestion.
Fortunately many are thoughtrel
enough to study themselves and note
the principle of Cause and Effect in
their daily food. .t N. Y. young womr
an writes her experience thus:
"Sometime ago I had a lot of trouble
from indigestion, caused by too rich
food. I got so I was unable to di
gest scarcely anything, and medicines
seemed useless.
"A friend advised me to try Grape.
tuts food, praising it highly, and as
a last resort I tried it. I am thankful
to say that Grape-Nuts not only re
lieved me of my trouble, but built me
up and strengthened my digestive or
gans so that I can now eat anything I
desire. But I stick to Grape-Nuts."
