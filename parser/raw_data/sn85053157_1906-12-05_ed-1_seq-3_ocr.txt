A BUREAU UASKET.
A Rnrean Banket. ,
A bureau basket is one of the col
lapsible creton covered wastebaskets
In miniature. It Is not more than
three inches high, and both sides and
base are made and finished separately
an, l Joined by narrow ribbons, Plic
basket is left empty for the various lit
tie thiugs or is partly filled with tape
measure, scissors, thimble and emery,
On one side (outside) Is a pocket,
gathered on an elastic; on another is
a fat pincushion, and a third lias a

needle bonk. The fourth is left plain
•vv U .v^ wn . ■ m ivuiui I« ifu fjiiiiii
so that the basket may be set flat
against the back of the bureau.
Like a number of other things, they
may be quite elaborately got up of
silks ornamented with tiny flowers
and fitted out with all the tiny belong
lugs or they may be made of bits of
creton, small patterns being best.
Kodak Film Case.
A unique and at the same time very
useful souvenir which one maynl&k»
to give to a kodak faddist Is a film
case. Use four pieces of cardboard,
6 by 8 inches, and cover them with
brown linen. On the outside of one
cover embroider the word "Films" in
attractive script and with effective
colored silk. Upon the reverse side
outline a graceful spray of blossoms
and work the monogram of the pro
spective recipient. To these ornate
covers tie six envelopes with a harmo
nizing shade of ribbon, threading It
through the flaps, also acting as a
hinge to hold the covers. These en
velopes should be lettered separately
with water color paints upon the ad
dress side. "Contents," "Dates," "In
cidents," "Scenes," "Persons," etc.
Workbaar Apron.
For the woman who is expert at em
broidery a workbag apron is just the
thing. A square of muslin or china
silk is trimmed all around with a nar
row edging of lace, preferably valen
WORKBAQ A THON.
Cienncs. Iu the center a large circle
Is outlined with beading, run with rib
bon. When the worker is ready to put
away her embroidery she drops the ar
tides in this circle, and when the
Strings are drawn a dainty workbag
Is the result
BagiraK«' Tax Case.
Have you ever been able to locate
baggage tags when you most wanted
them? Save your friend from a misfor
tune of this kind
by making her a
case in which to
place the trick
sy pests. In
shape this case
reminds one of
a rather large,
old fashioned
watch pocket,
except that it
would be square
were it not for
a point at the
top of the case.
BAOGAGE TAG C ARE.
A slightly stiffened eoarse tan canvas
goes into its manufacture. One piece
about eight inches long and four Inches
wide Is pointed at the top. A pocket
half the depth of this foundation piece
is attached, and both pieces of canvas
are bound with half inch satin ribbon.
Tied Into the pocket with baby ribbon
are a half dozen baggage tags. On this
pocket flap and on the top of the foun
dation are sprays of flowers done In
water colors. The particularly pretty
case is made of tan canvas, bound with
lavender ribbon and adorned with vio
lets. Loops of ribbon are sewed at the
top as a hanger.
A Bachelor*« Plnraahlon.
Fill a brier or cberry wool pipe with
cotton wool or bran and over this gum
a little piece of velvet. Next take
three yards of baby ribbon and wind
It carefully round the plpestem, tying
• small bow at each end. Stick some
pins in the cushion part, and the result
1* a dainty trifle, very novel and easy
to make for the bachelor 's Christmas.
ARMOR plated auto.
Mllllaiiniire*H Novel Machine Dalit t*
WitliMntKl Rnnitninx of Truclta.
J. Harvey Ladew, the millionaire
leather dealer of Now York, has had
constructed for himself nn armored
automobile at a cost of $10,000, which
Is the first vehicle of its kind built for
private use, so far r.s known. In any
city in the world, says the New "York
World. A half inch plate of chilled
Bteel protects the rear and side panels
of the car from the axles up to within
three feet of the hood. The sides of
the seat of the chauffeur are similarly
safeguarded, so that all parts of the
car—that is to say, what would be the
vital parts in a warship—are proof
against ramming.
The French and German armies have
what are known as war automobiles.
„um «re miowu as war auTomooues. 1
buttressed with steel plates to resist i
shot and shell. Mr. Ladow's auto car !
lias not been built to defy bullets, but j
to turn aside the shafts or poles of .
trucks or wagons.
The novel and original Idea of an ;
automobile protected by a plate of
armor is Mr. I.adew's own and was '
suggested by an accident In which he !
figured. He has been noted for his j
care and consideration for the rights
of others when automobiling, but has
not always received the same consld
eratlon himself, and has had two or
three narrow escapes from Injury by
recklessly driven trucks. The danger
from collision was brought strongly I
to his mind last February, when he j
and Mrs. Ladew were nearly plunged j
Into the East river through the gates j
of the Astoria ferry house in New i
The machine is beautiful In design
and ornamentation and exactly what
the owner wanted. The vehicle com
plete weighs a little more than two and
it mue muri? mail two nnc
balf tans and is probably the heav
lest automobile of its size In the world
; The s te? I pinte In the rear and on the
sides Is covered with a highly polishod
' veneer of malachite green.
I So far as outward appearance goes,
j the vehicle does not differ from the
j ordinary cab auto except In the ele
gance of Its finish. It la equipped with
an air brake, an entirely new device,
„and in addition to tills Is another and
most Ingenious scheme for the guid
ance of the chauffeur. Directly In
front of him Is a brass cylinder, the
circumference of which is divided off
Into sections, each containing n direc
tion, like "Go slow," "Turn right,"
"Turn left," "Stop," "Proceed." All
these arc controlled by a button within
the cab and are directed by the occu
pant. As an additional precaution
there Is a megaphone speaking tube
which, iu addition to the signaling, can
be uaed to keep the chauffeur Inform
ed as to the wishes of his passengers.
To make the whole car still more per
fect It Is lighted by electricity.

harvard's new game.
Or. Saritent'a Invention Conalata of
Basketball on Ënlarsed lirait.
Dr. Dudley Sargent, director of the
Hemenway gymnasium at Harvard
university, lias Invented a new game
very much like basketball, and he will
soou begin some experimental games
with It, says a Cambridge (Mass.) dis
patch to the New York Sun. The
teams to play the game will consist of
twelve or sixteen men, preferably six
teen. and play will bo held on a field a
hundred feet square.
There are to be four goals, one on
each side of the square, the two oppo
site ones to be defended by the same
team. The field is marked off with a
twenty -five foot square In each corner
aud a fiity foot square In the middle.
The reinaluiug four spaces in front o('
the goals, 25 by 50 feet, are to be oeeu
pied by two frost 1 tenders and two oppo
neuts. Iu the center square there are
to be four men from each team and In
each corner square one man from epch
team. The players are not allowed to
leave their assigned spaces. The rules
of the game are very much like basket
ball, except that the kinds of goals and
methods of se iring are entirely differ
ent. I>r. Sargent hopes to get up a
game of much more Interest, excite
ment and variety than basketball.
