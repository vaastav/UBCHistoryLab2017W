December 4, 18GG.
'What is the matter wi.h Mr Yates of the Char
lotte Democrat? Last summer we heard him speak
rather in favor of the adop.ion of the Constitution
as amended by the so-called bogus Convention.
Next we bear him talking rather strangely about
the Howard Amendment to the Federal Constitution.
Now we hear him urging the Legislature to abolish
the offices of Adjutant General and State Geologist.

But what is the matter with fr.end Yates? He is
a gentleman of prudence and sagacity, and usually
right. We fear he is wrong Salisbury Banner, No
vtmbtr 10A.
For some time past we have refrained from
writing anything about Federal politics, believ
ing that it would do no good for Southern Editors
to meddle in such matters at present. We have
Deen content to merely keep our readers posted !
in regard to passing events and the actual Condi- j
tion of affairs, waiting for a more proper time to !
i . . i , . ' . ;
give our own indtvtdualvtews. The above para- !
graph from the Salisbury Banner is couched in ;
ucu pome ana inruuiy terms that we ought not j
A. . !l , l
w pass it over in silence.
We assure the Banner that there is nothing the
matter with us but an earnest desire to .ee peace
restored to the country, good feeling prevail
among all our people, and perfect security for 1
persons and property. We are individually, as)
well as generally, interested in this matter, and
without meaning to boast we will say that we
have as much property and as large a family de
pendent on the proper settlement of national af
fairs as the majority of our citizens who take
an interest in such matters. In the South
we expect to live and die. and if any one
were to assert that we are not fully identified
with the Southern people, we should feel disposed
to say that he was guilty of falsehood. We want
no office for ourself. and would accept of none
neither have we any particular favorites to elevate.
We were decidedly in favor of ratifying the
new Constitution adopted by the late Convention.
It was an improvement on the old Constitution,
and if it hud been adopted our Courts would have
been relieved of trying numerous cases that might
be. settled by a Justice of the Peace, thus saving
the counties heavy expense. Besides, the busi
ness before our State Legislature would have
been expedited, and log-rolling' and bargain
ing" prevented hy that provi.-ion in the new Con
stitution which forbid the election of a member
of the Legislature to any office. It has been too
much the practice for men to go to the Legis
lature for the purpose of having themselves elect
ed to some other office. The late Convention
was not a bogus assemblage if it was bogus,
then we have a set of bogus State officers. Judges,
etc.. because they wtre elected by authority of
that Convention.
We have uttered no strange sounds about the
Howard amendment wo stand by what we have
heretofore said, viz : that we would prefer thut
the Southern States should adopt that amendment
rather than have all our State officers turned out.
a Provisional Government re-established, negro
suffrage forced upon us, large bodies of U. S.
soldiers quartered in the South, and probably
confiscation enforced. We don't like the amend- j
incut, but we have feared that unless the amend
ment was adopted we should have to endure and
submit to a great deal worse terms. For express
ing these views we have been called timid. We
make no pretentions to much bravery, but we
claim to be cautious, and, as a public journalist,
actuated by a sincere desire to promote the com
mon welfare of our people.
We are not disposed to reproach or denounce
those who oppose the amendment, but we must
be allowed to say that it is au easy matter for
many men who have nothing to lose to denounce
and defy the powers that be, and talk big words.
We do not claim to be more patriotic, or wise, or
far seeing, than many others, but we respectfully
submit that if the times and circumstances do not
require prudence in language and caution in ac
tion on the part of those who must suffer greatly
if our national difficulties are not speedily settled.
It is said that an effort is being made to effect
a compromise between the President and Con
gress on the basis of permitting negro suffrage.
If such an arrangement is made we shall expect
to see. our frieud of the Salisbury Banner and j
many others who are now declaiming against the
Howard amendment, proclaiming in favor of it.
For our own part, we prefer that the question of
puffrage should bn left for each State to settle for
itself, where we conceive that the Howard amend
ment leaves it. If the negroes are permitted to
vote, let them understand that we of the South
grant them that privilege, and not a Congress in
which the South is unrepresented. We believe
that by adopting negro suffrage both the whites
aud blacks will be greatly injured.
The Banner alludes to our proposition to abol
ish the offices of State Geologist and Adjutant
General. We are still in favor of dispensing
with the services of those officers, because they
are unnecessary in the present condition of af
fairs, and are an expense to the State Treasury.
Wh heur a great deal about the importance of
practising economy, but whenr we suggest now a
paving of money to the State might be effected,
our friends of the Salisbury Banner and Raleigh
Sentinel object, aud will nut agree to co-operate
with us. We respectfully call upon them. Gov.
Woith. and the Legislature, to suggest some
mode to lessen public expenditures. What is the
use of preaching what is not practised ?
We are not wrong, but we fear the Banner is
rather imprudent if not wrong.
Advkti51SO An unusually large number of new
advertisements will be found in this issue of our
paper. As tbe main source of revenue to a printing
office is derivei rom advertising, we ask the indul-
gvnee oi our j'nii uiis uiuu nc iunc diiuugniiriiis lo
give a larger quantity of reading matter. Rut all
ought to read the advertisements sales of property,
notices, new goods, &c.
Accidentally-. Killed. Mr Henry Bolton,
in attempting to descend a flight of stairs leading
into the back yard at the Charlotte Hotel on
Tuesday night last, fell and struck his head
against a stone, which caused his death in about
an hour. , He was a citizen of this place, about
.36 years old and unmarried.
A Penitentiary. Gov. Worth, in his late !
Messngo to the Legislature, recommends the
building of a Penitentiary in this State. - Our
opinion about the matter will not influence the
action of the Legislature one way or the other, ..
but w merely want to say that we do not agree
with the Governor. I
First, we are opposed to this scheme because !
it will require a larger amount of money to erect
the buildings and put the establishment in opera
tion than the people can spare in their present
impoverished condition. The Governor acknowl- I
edges that the people are barely able to pay their
present taxes, and many are entirely unable to
pay their debts, yet he makes recommendations
that will certainly increase taxation.
Second, we are opposed to building a Peniten
tiary because we think it will increase crime by
diminishing the terror of our present modes of
the only punishment to be inflicted. Hanging
and whipping are the best means to diminish
crime and lessen the number of evil doers.
Third, we are opposed to bringing criminal or
pauper labor into competition with our honest,
respectable mechanics. If a Penitentiary was
erected, of course various mechanical branches
would be carried on, and the work would be
thrown on the market in competition with that of
a highly useful and respectable class of our pop-
ulalinn the mechanics. If the State goes into
the business of learning criminals trades and the
manufacture of harness, saddles, boots, shoes,
etc , our present class of mechanics who manu-
,.p wu,j soo be oblid to
qu;( tl1(,jP trades and go at something else to sup-
vort themselves and families.
port
Fourth, we do not think the Legislature ought
to sanction the recommendation, because the
ouesti'n lias heretofore been submitted to the
1 . . , i . .. . .1
people and an overwhelming majority voted
against a I enitenttary.
Besides the expense of erecting the buildings.
purchase of machinery. &c. it. would require a
heavy annual appropriation for a few years at
least to keep the establishment up. lt is very
doubtful whether it would ever pay expenses.
m
U. S. Senator. It will be seen by the pro
ceedings of our State Legislature, that after sev
eral ballottings. Judge Manly was elected to the
U. S. Senate, in place of John Pool, whose term
expires 4th of March next.
Unless the test outb is repealed Mr Manly can
not take his seat, even if Congress, this winter,
declares the State to be in the Union.
We feel that we esteem Judge Manly as highly
as any man in the State we consider him one of
the best men we ever knew, and would gladly
see him placed on the Supreme Court Bench
but we would not vote him to a position he will
never be peimitted to fill, and why the Legisla
ture should '-lay him on the shelf" in that way
wo cannot understand.
m
The N- C. Uxivehsity. We regret to learn
that the prospects of the College at Chapel Hill
are not very good but few students in attendance,
and some of them talk of leaving, so we are in
formed. The management of the Institution does
not give satisfaction. We have no unkind feel
ings for the President, Gov. Swain personally
we esteem him highly but the opinion prevails
that there ought to be a change in the head of the
Institution: We are sorry to say this, but we
feel it our duty to do so. Sincb the election of
Gen. Lee to the Presidency of a College in Vir
ginia, it might have been expected that our Uni
versity would decay unless some man like Gen.
Joe Johnson was placed at its head. Instead of
appropriating money out of the State Treasury
to support the College, let the Trustees call a
meeting and elect Joe Johnston or some other
such man President, and in one year the present
buildings will not be sufficient to accommodate
the large number of students.
Mecklenburg Agmcultural Society. A
called meeting of the Mecklenburg Agricultural
Society was held in the Court House on Satur
day the 21th ult. A B Davidson. President, in
the Chair, and F Scarr, Secretary.
The report of the Chairman of the Executive
Committee was read.
On motion of J A Young, it was resolved, that
J E Brown. E-q., be requested to correspond with
the members from the county now at Raleigh in
regard to tho recovery of the Property of the
Society.
On motion, the following gentlemen were ad
ded to the Executive Committee: Gen J A Young
and J M Hutchison, Eo
On motion of J E Brown, it was resolved, that
a Committee of five be appointed to report matter
for action to a meeting of the Society to be held
on Tuesday of January C ourt.
The following members were appointed by the
Chair :
Messrs J E Brown. M L Wriston. Dr J Graham,
Dr T K. Curetou and Col Win Grief
The U. S. and Mexico. The Mexican ques
tion is creating some excitement at present. It
is reported that a body of U. S. troops under
Gen. Sedgwick crossed the Rio Grande and oc
cupied Matamoras, and that a collision has oc
curred between the American and French troops
The authorities at Washington say that if Gen.
Sedgwick has invaded Mexico he did so without
orders, and will be arrested. The whole story is
doubtful.
It is also said that Napoleon has ordered all
the French troops to be withdrawu from Mexico
13 We think it is about time for the Confer
ences. Synods. Presbyteries, and other religious
bodies in the South, to talk a little more about
educating the poor white children in our midst,
and let the negro question drop for a while. We
fear that some people are going crazy on the ne
gro-school question. Iluinbuggery.

Signs of,. Improvement. Recently there
have been several sales of property in this city
and vicinity, and we are glad to say that the
spirit of improvement has got hold of our people
and manifesting itself in the erection of new
baildings and repairing old ones. There are now
between 15 and 25 new houses in course of con
struction. Two vacant lots at the corner of the Square in
rear of the Mansion House, on Trade street, were
sold by Mr J. A. Sadler to Messrs Stenhouse,
Macaulay & Co.. for $2000 in gold.
Mr John S. Means. living 5 miles North of this
town, sold his tract of land containing about 400
acres, to a Northern Company for about $20,000
in gold. There is said to be a gold mine ou the
place, and the Company bought it, we presume,
for the purpose of working the Mine.
Burned to Death. We learn that a child
of Mr James Johnston, living near Davidson Col
lege, was burned to death on Friday night last by
its clothes taking fire.
.
Agricultural College. We are sorry to
feel it our duty to disapprove any of Gov.
Worth's recommendations. We believe the Gov
ernor to be honest in his opinions and has the
good of the State at heart, but like other men he
is liable to err and may be mistaken iu his ideas
of public policy.
By an act of Congress a large quantity of pub
lic land was donated to each State to erect and
put in operation au Agricultural College. The
Governor suggests that North Carolina's share of
this fund be used to engraft such a Department
in the College at Chapel Hill. We do not think
such a disposition of the fund would be prudent
or beneficial, unless the management at Chapel
Hill is materially changed. At present, scores of
our young men are going to Colleges outside the
limits of this State Chapel Hill does not sustain
the reputation it formerly did and the addition
of an Agricultural Department will not much help
its stauding. We are opposed to partial dona
tions of public property or money. If it is
thought best not to establish a separate College
for promoting Agriculture, let the fund be fairly
divided among all our Colleges, and let an Agri
cultural Chair be supported iu each. Let Chapel
Hill take its chance among other institutions.
and let the institution be conducted iu a more
energetic and economical manner.
It might be better, for the present, to leave the
fund in the hands of the State authorities, unap
propriated.

"The Last Ninety Days of the War in
North Carolina " This is the title of a neat
volume of 267 pages, by Cornelia Philips Spencer,
an accomplished daughter of the Old North State,
which we have received from the publishers, E.
J. Hale & Son of New York. It gives an inter
esting account of Sherman's march through the
State, incidents of the war. &c. Orders for the
book may be sent to E. J. Hale & Son, (late
Editors of the Fayettevillo Observer.) wholesale
Booksellers aud Stationers, 4Ub Broadway. New
York. The price of a single copy, by mail free
of postage, $1.50. To dealers, very liberal dis
counts.
Rather too" much space in the book is occupied
in "putting a lew individuals anu particular
families; and its statements are not altogether
accurate, but the errors are not of much impor
tance. For instance on page 109 we read:
"Governor Graham was sent from the Legisla
ture by a majority of three-fourths to the Confed
erate Senate, in December, 1863, on the resigna
tion of the Hon. George Davis, who had accepted
the appointment of Attorney General in the Cab
inet of President Davis.
The Hon. Geo. Davis never resigned his place
in the Confederate Senate. Governor Graham's
friends went to work to defeat Mr Davis' re elec
tion, and succeeded in electing Mr Graham.
After this. President Davis invited Geo. Davis to
a seat in his Cabinet. This is a matter of no im
portance, only it is right to keep history correct.
!
Too MUCH Labor. New York and Wash
ington papers suy that there are thousands of
laborers in those cities out of employment, and
the prospect for them this winter is gloomy. If
those people would come out this way, and go to
cultivating the land, they might make a good
living. Our land holders ought to agree on some
plan for disposing of their lauds in small tracts,
so as to induce immigration. "
Hon. Ilerschel V. Johnson has resigned
the office of United States Senator, to which the
Georgia Legislature elected him.
What is the use for him to continue to hold the
position, when he knows he will not be allowed to
take his seat in the U. S. Senate.

euuorsea summary measures will be adopted oy ;
the two Houses to bring this Southern difficulty
io a speedy and decisive solution, lhis opinion
we believe to be well founded, and from certain
information which has lately come into our pos
session, we think the initial point of a new line
of action has been discovered whereby this whole
question may be substantially settled before the
adjournment on the 4t!i of March next, and set
tled upon the basis of the pending constitutional
amendment
The key which unlocks this difficulty and all j
us complications is this: that three-fourths of the
loyal Stales, or the States represented in Congress,
are competent not only to carry on the govern
ment, but to change the organic law of the gov
ernment. Divested of petty technicalities, quirks and
quibbles, it i3thus apparent that three-fourths of
1 1 O A . Jl
me oiaies now represented in congress are com
petent to make the pending constitutional amend
ment part and parcel of the Constitution, the su
preme law alike to the outside and the inside
States and Territories. This is the conclusion
which, we understand, will be acted upon by Con
gress. Y lien three-fourths, or twenty-one of the
twentv:six States now represented in Congress
shall have ratified the amendment the Secretary
of State will be required, by an act of Congress, if
necessary, to proclaim the ratification complete.
Then, while the ratification may be held as the
condition of Southern restoration, the amendment
consummated will still be binding upon thctn as
the supreme law of the land, and Congress may
enforce it from Virginia to Texas by "appropriate
legislation, as in the lerritdnes.
This is the solution which awaits the excluded
States. It is a solution perfectly consistent with
the rights and powers assumed by the loyal States
in suppressing the rebellion of the late so-called
Confederate States, and with all the legislation of
Congress since the first bombardment of Fort
Sumter."
