The Lerfslature.
Paring the past vfleek but little of importance was
done, W regret to see that several days have been
occupied in discussing tbe question of admitting the
resolutions of certain Republican meetings, asking
for the trial of certain members charged with be
luuging to the Ku Klux organization. It would be
jjctti r to permit such matter to be read if presented
l,v a member and then lay it on the table. Would
pot that be a more proper course than to spend a
Ion? time in discussing the matter and giving it
notoriety ? Anything in the shape of a petition or
request should be read, and if a majority considers
it improper, let it be laid upon the table, the grave
for all hills and resolutions which the members do
not want to vote upon directly.
We Are gratified to see that Mr "Waring pressed
j,h bill to abolish the oflice of State Geologist to a
i.vch reading on Friday last ; and we regret to see
that such conservatives as Sparrow, Martin, and
Jones of Caldwell, opposed its passage, along with
Boine Republicans who care nothing about reducing
expenses by the present Legislature. Mr 'Waring
made some sensible and timely remarks in favor of
the hill, and we hope he will continue to pres. it to
a fiiKil passage through both Houses. Unless some
useless olliees are abolished wc can't see how the
people will pay the expenses of the State Govern
ment, to say "nothing ab. it Cjtmty and City ex
po ses.
There is a bill before the Legislature to transfer
the Hailroad stocks owned by the State to the State's
creditors, and levying a tax of 33 J cents on the $100
value of real and personal property and $1 on the
jioll, to pay the interest on new Bonds to be issued
in compromising the State debt.
.
jrjT Considerable press ure is being brought to
ben r on the Legislature in favor of reducing the tax
en riicusses, concerts, shows, Arc. Instead of re
ducing the tax, the Legislature had better increase
it. What would home tax-payers say if their Repre
sentatives reduced the tax on traveling performers
and humhugSi and increased it on land and personal
jiropcrty ?
The President's Message.
We publish the Message of President Grant de
livered to Congress on the 4th hist. Wearegrati-fii-
to see that the President recommend the re-
moral of the disabilities of all persons so as to en- !
able them to hold any office to which they may be
elected. The President shows not only fairness but
good I'-ine in miking such a recommen lation. lie
deserves thanks for that much at least, and a good
deal of censure for the partian spirit exhibited in
other portions of his message.
We don't like Grant's administration, and intend
to do all we can to put other men in oflice, but if
that cannot be done we will not despair and give up
all as lost. This country is the best in the world,
even if it is sometimes governed by incompetent
had men. Let us all work to produce reform and
discountenance strife and turmoil and unlawful con
tention between common citizens. Never despair.
aa a
Ex-Gov. W. W. Holden.
If Congress removes the disabilities of all South
ern men and admits Gov. Vance and others properly
elected to their seats in the U. S. Senate and House
f Hepresentatives, we intend to advocate and re
quest the Legislature to remove the disabilities im
posed upon Gov. Holden by reason of his impeach
ment and lemoval from office. By impeachment
he was deprived of the right to vote in this State.
If he wishes to become a citizen again we are in
favor of restoring him to the rights of a citizen.
We disapproved of his course while Governor, but
we are in favor of trivinr all white men the riht to

nay he abased for such a course, but that shall not
deter us from doing what we think is right, no
math r what others may think about it. The re
moval of Hidden from office was a vindication of
the rights of citizens whom he had unlawfully ar
tiste I. ami whs punishment enough without de
priving him of the rights of a citizen.
Ih'l len is a better man than John Pool and men
' f that stripe who advised him wrongfully, accept
pi hit aid in promoting them to oflice, and then de
serted him in the hour of trial. We are in favor of
a pencral amnesty by Congress, and also in favor
.Canting to others (including Gov. Hoi den) what
'e u.-k for onrself and our party friend.

The Lawyers and Judge Logan.
The following proceedings of a meeting of the
Lawyers of the 9th District were laid Kforo the
Legisdatu re on the 2d inst. We presume that Judge
iAigan was astonished when he saw certain names
to the paper, although it appears that several law
yers dodged the responsibility. It could not have
been expected, however, that Col. W. P. Bynum
would sign the paper, as he holds an elective office
like the Judge, and it would be improper for him
to interfere in the matter :
At a meeting of the Bar of the ninth judicial
district, held at Charlotte, and numerously attended
on the 2d of June, 1871, the following preamble'
ana resolutions were adopted.
U ukkkas, The learning and ability of the judi
ciary of North Carolina have always been the boast
of her citizens and the pride of her bar; and where
as we think that the same high standard of judicial
excellence should be maintained if possible, and
that the law should be correctly and uniformly ad
ministered, therefore
llemlced, That it is the opinion of the undersigned
members of the bar, that His Honor George w'
Logan, judge of the ninth judicial district, 'is not
qualified either by learning or capacity to discharge
the duties of the oflice he now holds," and that bv
reason of his incompetency the course of justice has
been impeded, and in many cases justice itself vir
tually denied, public confidence in the efficiency of
the government and the laws has been impaired,
crimes have been multiplied, and the administration
of law rendered needlessly expensive, as well to the
public as to parties litigant.
JUsohcd, That the secretary of this meeting be,
and he is hereby instructed to forward these pro
ceedings to the speaker of the house of representa
tives of North Carolina, immediately upon its as
sembling in November next, with the view that tiie
same may by him be laid before that honorable
body, as our memorial for such action as the exigen
cy of the case may demand.

FOR THE CHARLOTTE DEMOCRAT.
Indian Relics Masonic Emblems.
W. J. Yates, Esq , Editor Charlotte Democrat :
I give you the following description of an Indian
grave excavated by me in March, 1871.
In a conversation with Mr R. V. Michaux of
Burke county, N. C, on Indian curiosities, he in
formed me tiiat there was an Indian mound on his
farm which was formerly of considerable height,
but had gradually been plowed down ; that several
mounds in the neighborhood had been excavated,
and nothing of interest found in them. I asked
permission to examine this mound, which was
granted, and upon investigation the following facts
were revealed :
Upon reaching the place I sharpened a stick four
or live feet in length and ran it down in the earth
at several places, and finally struck a rock about
eighteen inches below the surface, which, when
digging down, was found to be about eighteen
inches long and sixteen inches wide, and from two
to three inches in thickness, the corners rounded
. . ...
It rested on solid earth about
ibout 18 inches above thebot-
lo.n of the grave and had been smoothed on top.
I then made an excavation in the south of the
grave, and soon struck another rock, which, upon
examination, proved to be in front of the remains
of a human skeleton in a sitting posture. The bones
of the lingers of the right hand had been resting on
this rock, and on the rock near the band was a small
stone about five inches long, resembling a toma
hawk or Indian hatchet. Upon a further examina
tion many of the bones were found, though in a
very decomposed condition, and upon exposure to
the air soon crumbled to pieces. The heads of the
bones, a considerable portion of the skull, maxillary
bones, teeth, neck bones, and the verlebre, were in
their proper places, though the weight of the earth
above them had driven them down, yet the frame
was perfect and the bones of the head were slightly
inclined toward the Etixt. Around the neck was
found coarse beads that seemed to be of some hard
substance, and resembled chalk. A small lump of
red paint, about the size of an egg, was found near
l:ie 1 1 .Mil ni.-ic oi mis Mueiei' .!, unu i;ie sumics oi un.

.. J
Me right side ot this skeleton, and the sutures oi tne
twentv-live or twenty-eight years of age. The top
of the skull was about twelve inches below the
mark of the plow.
1 made a further excavation toward the west of
this grave and found another skeleton similar to the
first, in a sitting po.-ture facing the east. A rock
j was on the right, on which the bones of the right
hand were resting, anil on this rock was a toma
hawk which had been about seven inches in length,
but was broken into two pieces, and was much
better finished than the first. Beads were also
arouud the neck of this one, but are much smaller
and of liner quality than those on the neck of the
first. The material, however, seems to be the same.
A much larger amount of paint v.-as found by the
side of tiiis than the first. The bones indicated a
person of large frame, and I think was about fifty
years of age. Everything about this one had the
appearance of superiority over the first. The top
of the skull was about six inches below the mark of
the plow.
I continued the examination, and after dilligent
search found nothing at the north side of the grave,
but on reaching the east found another skeleton, in
the same posture as the others, facing the west. )a
the right side of this was a rock on which the bones
of the riht hand had been resting, and on the rock
was also a tomahawk about eight inches in icngtn
broken into three nieces, much smoother and of
finer material than the others. A larger amount of

sides the smaller bones were almost entirely decom
posed and w ould crumble when handled. These
two circumstances, coupled with the fact that the

The grave was situated due East and West, in
size about 9 bv 0 feet, the line being distinctly marked
bv the difference in the color of the sail. It was dug
in rich black loam and fined around the bodies with
Ayhite or yellow sand, but contiguous to the skele
tons was a dark colored earth, and so decidedly
ditferent was this from all surrounding it, both in
quality and smell, that the line of the bodies could
be readily traced.
The odor of this decomposed earth, which had
been llesh, w:is similar to clotted blood, and would
adhere in lumps when compressed in the hand.

Important Case.
In the Federal Court the case of Terrell vs.
Will'ams was decided last week. The action
was brought by Dr. Terrell, a non-resident,
to recover five thousand dollars from Greene
and Sandy Williams of Person county in
this State. After the decision by our Su
preme Court that the Constitutional home
stead exemption was retroactive Mr. Ter
rell who held a large lot of notes and other
evidences of debt left Person county where
he resided to take up his residence in anoth
er State for the purpose of collecting his
debts in the Federal Court where the Home
stead exemption is held not good as against
old debts. Gov. Graham for the defence
raised the point that Terrell had just gone
from the State for this purpose and it was a
fraud upon the Court and he hoped the case
would be dismissed. His Honor held differ
ently. That if Terrell had gone from the
State to reside permanently it made no diff
erence what his object was. So Dr. Terrell
gained the ease. Halei'jh Carolinian.
