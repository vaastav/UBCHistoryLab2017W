The financial recommendations of
Mr. Hayes and Secretary Sherman
don't seem to meet with a very hearty
reception even in their own party, and
they are preparing for a square back
down upon the subject. The recent
pronunciamentos of those function
aries demanding the retirement of
greenbacks and the demonetization of
silver, produoed quite a sensation and
bid fair to create a row in the Radical
ranks that would burst the rotten con
cern into flinders and scatter its frag
ments to the four winds. Had these
financial views of Hayes and Sherman
been proclaimed before our lste elec
tion the result would have been very
different from what it was. Several
of the Republican members of Con
gress seeing the blonder of their Pres
ident, are making haste to repair the
damage that would be likely to follow,
by ofleriog joint resolutions declaring
against any tampering with financial
matters, and in favor of leaving them
where Democratic legislation has plac
ed them, with silver remonetized and
the volume of greenbacks required to
be maintained .to the amount of about
$346,000,000. For the present the pros
pect is that a row between the Radical
factions is likely to be avoided by the
Eastern goldites consenting to keep
quiet and await a more convenient time
for surreptitiously forcing through
their pet schemes. Let the people re
member the Radical snake is only
scotched ; it is not dead.
It is the general impression that
Bayard, the great statesman of the lit
tie State of Delaware, did not materi
ally improve his chances for the Demo
cratic nomination for President by com
ing to the aid of Hayes and Sherman
in their financial scheme, by offering a
joint resolution in the Senate to take
away the legal-tender quality of the
greenbacks, making them merely
Treasury notes, payable in specie at
the will of the holder aod receivable
for all dues to the United States ex
cepting duties on imports. Inasmuch
as Mr. Bayard would make the green
back redeemable in coin at all times
and at all the government agencies, it
is difficult to comprehend what sense
there Is . in making the exception
against receiving them for duties on
imports. It is certainly against the
well known sentiment of the Democ
racy who have persistently demanded
that the Government should fully
honor its own paper by receiving it
for all purposes without exception
While Hayes and Sherman are being
snubbed by their own party friends, it
seems a very inopportune moment for
Mr. Bayard to come to the frout as
the champion of the money power.
General Woodford, of New York,
was the only Republican visiting
statesman to Louisiana dnring the late
political contest in that State. He
went there for the purpose of making
speeches to enlighten the people on
the subject of their interest and duty,
and we presume faithfully fulfilled the
duties of his mission. The General
his returned to his friends and there
is no account of his having been in
any way interfered with or molested
in the free and full discussion of po
litical questions, and yet the Democ
racy have carried that State by an in
creased majority over that of 1S7C
when the vote was stolen by the vil
lainous Radical Returning Board un
der the management of Northern visit
ing statesmen, to seat in the Presiden
tial chair a man who was neyer elected.

Chairman of the Committee on Ways
and Means, says that he is in favor of
legislation which will prohibit the Sec
retary of the Treasury from selling
another four per cent, bond under any
circumstances. "That liberty, which
he now has, we shall imperatively
stop, Then we propose that be shall
take one hundred million dollars of
bis coin, and hold it awaiting oppor
tunities to boy bonds. His coin lies
idle and sboold be used. We pro
pose, also, that there shall be no fail
ure in refunding from lack of oppor
tunity. It is our intention to pass a
refunding bill as soon as possible, and
give the one hundred million dollars
of coin to use with the bonds ; bnt no
bill can pass that gives more than a
three and a half per cent, bond." Mr.
Wood says, also, that he believes the
people want as little financial legisla
tion as possible ; that they want the
greenbacks let alone, and that they
also want a refunding bill passed.

Representative Weaver, the Green-
backer of Iowa, has presented at infla
tion scheme to the House, which au
thorizes an appropriation of fifty-five
millions of dollars, so that soldiers and
sailors of the late war shall be paid the
difference in value between the cur
rency which he received and the stand
ard gold coin of the United States, in
which he should have been paid, to
gether with six per cent, per annum
from the date said soldiers and sailors
were mustered out of the service of
the United States up to the date of the
payment of the sum found due him
by the provisions of the Weaver act.
Secretary McCrart in his annual
report says: "The annual expendi
tures of the War Department for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, were
$42,653,753 62. The appropriations
available for the service of the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1878, aggragated
$45,076,702 97; and those for 1879
were $53,015,040 96, and those for the
currant fiscal year amounted to $46,
269,821.94. The estimates for the ser
vice of the fiscal year ending June 30,
1881, are $40,380,428 93, to which
amount they have been reduced from
$54,306,643.14, for which they were
originally submitted to me. The mil
itary establishment is estimated for on
the basis of 25,450 enlisted men. The
Signal Corps being by law allowed
450 men not to be included in the 25,
000 men."
As the time for the meeting of the
Ohio Legislature draws near and the
sentiment of the Republican members
become known, it is apparent that
Gen. Garfield holds the lead in the
race for the Uniled States Senatorship,
While he has not a majority of the
members pledged to his support, yet
it is believed that no combination can
be formed to defeat him. In speaking
of the opposition to him, the Wash
ington Post says : "Implacable hostil
ity to Garfield has not been develop
ed. Some of his opponents are using
the DeGolyer pavemeut scandal to his
injury, but an affair of that kind will
scarcely be fatal. There have been
too many corruptions in Radical his
tory for the party to take alarm at
such matters at this date. If Mr. Gar
field is ruined by this effort of his op
ponents it will be because he didn't
get $100,000 instead of a paltry $5,000."
The ruling sentiment of both par
ties in Congress seems inclined to
avoid a discussion of the currency
question and not disturb the present
status of monetary affairs. This will
hardly suit the gold clique who de
sire to have the recommendations of
Hayes and Secretary Sherman carried
out with a view to making money
scarce and dearer that they may be
able to control the financial affairs of
the country, regardless of the welfare
of the government or the people. Hav
ing secured the remonetization of sil
ver and prohibited the retirement and
destruction of greenbacks, the Democ
racy can afford to leave the present
condition of the currency question un
disturbed for a time and devote their
attention to questions of more press
ing importance.
The Austrian Congress has recently
fixed the war footipg of the army of
that Nation at 800,000 men. Austria
has a "strong goyernment" such as the
Radical politicians want for this Na
tion, with an army that will prevent the
people from doing themselves irrepar
able damage. Our little army of 25,
000 costs this year $42,653,723.02 for its
maintenanco,whicb is thought by many
to be an extravgant sum, bnt when it
shall be increased to correspond with
the grand ideas of the Radical leaders
and with the splendid establishments
of the "strong governments" of the
old world, Uncle Samuel will have an
abundant use for all his spare change.
Xbe Canee of the Business Beam.
Ben Butler was interviewed by an
Enquirer reporter and attributed the
"revival of that business" to its legetl
mate cause. lie said "That expansion
has come through the IdQux of gold,
which has arisen from the balance of
trade in onr favor from the sale of our
agricultural and other products abread,
which, coming here as currency, has
been expansion. They call this infla
tion ; but how a currency is to be in
flated when the inflating element is
composed of that which is valuable.
per se, is a question that I leave to
others wiser than I am. That it can
be expanded by that means I agree.
Correspondent Do you agree with
Comptroller Knox that that expansion
is dangerous and unwise ?
General Butler Without that ex
pansion neither Comptroller Knox nor
any body else would have seen the
good times upon which the President
so fully congratulates the country,
would have come. Without that ex
pansion the Resumption Act would
not have been executed. To test this
it would be seen at once that if Prov
idence had sent upon this country the
famine and upon Europe plenty, so
that we had to buy our breadstuff's by
sending our gold out instead of selling
them to bring it in, I think neither
Comptroller Knox, Secretary Sher
man nor Mr. Hayes would have con
gratulated the country, either upon its
good times or the execution of the
Resumption Act.

Washington, Letter.
From Our Regular Correspondent.
Washington, D. C, Nov. 5, 1879.
Congress Is again at it. First blood
for the Democrats. The President's
attack on the currency, with John
Sherman at his back, has had a most
discouraging effect upon the Republi
cans, and they have been in solemn
conclave ever since the missile fell in
their midst, endeavoring to harmonize
among themselves, but, so far without
real effect. Senator Edmunds is busied
with suggestions, but, as the matter is
of such a nature as to bar him from ex
ercising his Mephistolian attributes of
chicanery and trickery, his peace
making efforts hardly suffice to cause
his brethren to dwell together in
peace and harmony.
The financial fight promises to be
a defensive one for the Democrats, and
they propose to make good use of their
advantages. Beyond the profuse dis-
play of flowers with which friends of
the Senators and members decorated
many of the desks, and the tables of
the chairmen, the opening on Monday
was wholly devoid of interest or varie
ty. Mr. Randall was highly favored
with floral contributions, none of
which came from some Government
conservatory, and his face displayed
his appreciation of the gifts as he called
the House to order and entered upon
the routine which precedes the recep
tion of the President's Message. As
the press had anticipated the Message,
thus acquainting all with its points few
remained to listen to its reading. The
members pocketed their copies, which
were laid on each desk, and disappear
ed, leaving the Clerk to read to empty
seats, and we venture to say that no
annual message of the past had less
weight with Congress than will have
this tame effort of his fraudulency,
Hayes. Vacant desks received it, and
unless we mistake the adverse feeling
so far expressed, Congress will allow
vacancy to hold its suggestions. Little
will be done prior to January 1, beyond
arranging programmes of labor for the
long session which is inevitable, and
the absence of the lobby interest is
quite noticeable. . General legislation
only brings these fellows here, partic
ularly such as are interested in saving
the infamous Indian frauds from de
molition. Carl Sehurz is intensely ex
cited over the expressed determination
of Mr. Scales, chairman of the House
Indian Committee, to go to the bottom
of the frauds and fizzles of the Interior
Department in Indian matters.
The improvements made in and
about the Capitol have been extensive,
and conduce largely to its beauty. The
broad approaches, which extend from
the avenues through the grounds on
the west to the Capitol terrace, have
been laid in ornamental concrete, with
guarding walls of white and blue stone,
and give much effect. The ventilating
ducts are complete. Paint and polish
have been freely used throughout the
building. Brumidi'a fresco in the ro
tunda has been so extended that the
visitor can appreciate the full beauty
and grandeur of the painting which,
as a work of the painter's art surpasses
all others in the Capitol, save those
magnificent pictures of Moran, repre
senting scenes in the Yellow Stone re
gion.
The recommendation of the Secre
tary of the Treasury, in his report.and
of the Presideut in bis Message, favor
ing the retirement of the greenback
from circulation, has developed a de
cided opposition to such a measure
among most of the Republican mem
mere from the West, and among both
Democrats and Republicans from the
South. For two days it was the sub
ject of discussion in the coat-rooms, in
the lobbies, and on the floor of the
House, but now a calm succeeds the
breeze, out of which there came
the audible whisper from the potent
voice of a strong majority " The cir
culating medium shall not be decreas
ed, and the business of the country
destroyed by such legislation!"
The most important legislation an
ticipated this session is a revision of
the tariff. Whether tea, that beverage
for which our forefathers raised such a
row in Boston harbor, is to be the ob
ject of taxation, or quinine, which
feeds our statesmen to preserve their
lives near the tadpole flats of the Po
tomac, has not yet been determined.
The stealing and publication of the
President's Message and the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury, before
they were given to Congress, is still
the subject of investigation, much dis
cussion, and, with a few, some swear
ing. Many theories and speculations
are advanced as to the manner of pil
fering them, and several fertile
schemes set on foot by the Executive
branch of the Government to get these
documents, in future, to Congress be
fore the fingers of the thief takes them
away and sells them for $250. It is not
the first instance of the kind, and
therefore they will tax their ingenuity
only for the next administration to fall
into the same trap. In 1867 President
Johnson's message got into the papers
before it was read to Congress, and it
was stated that the many journals pub
lishing it paid $100 each for the docu
ment. Notwithstanding this experi
ence and renewed vigilance, in 1868
Secretary of the Treasury McCulIoch
was startled by reading his report in a
New York paper several days before it
was given to Congress.
The Republicans of the District of
Columbia who have voluntarily re
mained disfranchised for some years,
in consequence of the great Influx of
ragged and destitute Africans from all
portions of the South, voting for any
thing that brought taxation to proper
ty holders, are now organizing with a
view to be reinstated with the rights
of an American citizen and the power
of the ballot. At a meeting held sev
eral days since, Major A. C. Richards
was chosen president,and Hon. Robert
G. Iugersoll and other prominent Re
publicans elected vice presidents. They
were eloquently addressed by lion.
Robert Iugersoll, who made no allu
sion to the mistakes of Moses, but

Four car-loads of colored emigrants
from Goldsboro, N. C, passed through
this city a few days ago, on their way
to Indiana. They are healthy-looking
and well-behaved people, of all grades
and sexes. All of them, except about
twenty, had paid their fare through to
Indiana, where, they alleged, they in
tended to make their future home. It

tificate of election to the office of Lien-tenaut-Governor
to Clarkson N. Pot
ter. It is said that more than one
hundred ballots were voted in the late
election which were defective, and
should have been counted for Mr. Pot
ter. On some the names were print
ed "C. M. Potter," and on others
" Clarkson N. Potter." The Republi
cans say that the Canvassers cau not
go behind the county returns, and
that it will be necessary for Mr. Pot
ter to appeal to the Courts. Demo
crats hold that the Canvassers must
count for Clarkson N. Potter all votes
that are plainly intended to be cast
for him. Hoskins' apparent majority
is said to be not more than eighty
The Democrats say that if the ballots
rejected as defective are counted for
Mr. Potter, he will be elected.
Georgia moonshiners.
The Commissioner of Internal Rev
enue has received a report-giviug the
details of the recent fight with moon
shiners, in which a guide was killed
and three Deputies wounded. The
raiding party, six in number, was fired
upon at night, while around their
camp-fire. They put out their light
and retreated. They were attacked by
about twenty men. Taking to trees,
the fire was returned briskly, the fight
lasting about half an hour, when the
moonshiners withdrew. One Deputy,
Daniel, was wounded desperately, be
ing shot in five places. Deputy Cobb
was wounded three times. Deputy
Pittmanu was shot in two places. It
is not known how the attacking party
suffered. The Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue has determined to
bring all of the party who attacked the
officers to justice if possible, and will
keep up the war until illicit distilling
in Georgia Is put down.

LIKENS On the Srd of December, of Typhoid
fever, at the residence of her father, Mattie
Hay, daughter of James and Mary H. Likens,
in the 14th year ot her age,
The subject of this notice was a young lady
of much promise, and was greatly beloved by
the community in which she lived, and an ob
ject of joy to her fond parents, being the young
est child of the family, but the reaper came in
the still hour of the morning and cut down this
fair flewer, just unfolding into the beauty and
loveliness of womanhood. Her short pilgrim
age on earth is ended, but her feet have entered
the pearl-set gates of the New Jerusalem, and
her footprints in the golden sands are side ly
side with the one who long since has gone be
fore her.
The funeral services were conducted by Rev.
N. Paltxgrotf, making use of those consoling
words found in the 8th chapter of Luke, 53nd
verse; "Weep not, she Is not dead, bntsleeu
eth." Mattie Hay, thou hast left us.
Here thy less we deeply feel;
But 'tis God that hath belt us, -
He ean all our surrows heal.
