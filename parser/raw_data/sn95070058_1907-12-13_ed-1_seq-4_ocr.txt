Spurred on no doubt by the trcmcn-
douB popularity of tlio president San
ntor I'hllnnder C. Knox of Pennsylv
ania linn announced himself a candl-
date for tlio republican providential
nomination.
In his speech , Senator Knox declar
ed Roosevelt's administration and pol
icies were all right and that every pol
icy had been vindicated. He nlso said
that tlio only criticism the democrats
could bring against the presidential
administration was the fact that If
the democrats had been In power , they
would have done the same thing.
A little while ago Knox was a "re
actionary" as opposed to the policies
of the president. Now ho has come
Roosevelt boomer
forth as a full Hedged
er and It Is apparent that.hc would not
be averse to running on a Roosevelt
platform.
Hut then there arc Hughes and Taft
and Cannon and Foraker to deal with
before the game is over.
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
With the announcement that the
republican national convention In 1008
will bo held in Chicago , the president
ial matter takes on now interest and
from this tlmo forward the stops in
behalf of various candidates will be
come more and more pronounced.
Kansas City was a very active can-
dltato for the convention and it was
thought for a time that the Missouri
town would win. Taft forces favored
this slto from the first , but it is not
believed that there is any political
significance in the loss.
The convention will be held early
and it may be predicted , therefore ,
that congress will adjourn early as
many senators and congressmen will
attend the convention.
Many candidates' machines will be
gin to work from now on , though some
Hughes , In particular is without a
personal machine and If ho should bo
nominated It would be by reason of
his great personal force throughout the
nation.
Many senators feared that the pres
ident's message meant he would seek
a third term , and it is not at all prob
able that the recent word from Wash
ington unquestionably inspired by the
president , will allay this fear. These
senators thought that In view of exist
ing financial conditions the president
might have omitted from his message
all word regarding "predatory wealth"
and dishonest corporations. They
claimed that in this ho was seeking
to make a grandstand play for the
nomination. But the president's best
friends still Insist ho will not accept
a nomination and that he will in no
the con
way be a candidate before
vention.
CORTELYOU'S URGENT MESSAGE.
Secretary Cortelyou asks for an
elastic currency. He makes no recom
mendations , but merely announces that
elasticity Is the need of the nation.
And he goes further to the extent of
declaring that prompt action is de
manded.
But that is not going far enough to
Bolvo the problem. It Is not explicit
enough to bring out of congress any
definite results.
There has been a pretty general talk
around Washington of the need of a
more elastic currency. The east has
felt that In the fall , when the west
wanted its money , there should bo
some elastic means of sending out
something else than the original money
while the real money went on playing
with this and that speculation.
Elasticity has been a problem In
currency for many centuries. It has
never been solved yet. It is not likely
that Mr. Cortelyou's urgent message
will bring about the result at this
time , just ahead of a presidential
election.
Many plans have ben presented. Ow
ing to differences of opinion there
would be a difficult time in getting
down to business on any one plan.
The plan to guarantee deposits is
not going to meet with favor at the
hands of bankers who desire that a
bank shall earn its reputation and be
made to stand on its own logs , rathei
than that all national banks may give
a depositor the same security and thai
recklessness could bo indulged in bj
one bank at the expense of all others
Mr. Cortelyou Is perhaps wise In
offering no more of a recommendatlor
than that elasticity is needed. For II
is easier to find fault with any de
finite plan offered , than to solve the
problem.
TOO MUCH MURDER.
The taking of human life has be
come altogether to commonplace in tin
United States of late and It is not al
all improbable that the people of the
country , are themselves , to blame.
So much has the public been wink
Ing at murder of late , excusing highlj
atrocious crimes on the basis of whal
that human blood and human life luivo
become cheap and murder n now form
of plaything.
Tlio American people ; must In n
large moaiuro take the blnmo when
thi'.v will frt'e ' wanton murdurorH who
jilead "unwritten" law as an excuse.
Only this week a Jury of Americana
acquitted a woman who. without oven
claiming to be virtuous herself , had
shot and killed A United States sen
ator because he was "untrue" to her
womanhood.
Mrs. Bradley admitted on the stand
that she had been false to her own
self. Yet she thought she ought to bo
allowed to kill , without punishment ,
the man who had been no moro false
to her than she had been to herself.
And the jury of twelve men who tried
her unanimously agreed with her and
turned her loose.
It Is not to be expected , after this
and many other such farces of Justice ,
that Harry Thaw will bo hanged.
And after such expressions of the
American public , In turning loose mur
derers who deliberately carry out
their life-taking crusades because this
or that person has not been "true" to
them , why should any man hesitate
In calmly slaughtering those who
have betrayed him or whom ho thinks
have betrayed him ? If ono can only
for the moment believe that ho has
been wronged and get up a momentary
brainstorm , why not take advantage
of the public's willingness to condone
the crime ?
But such lawlessness must have an
end. The reign of murder which has
spread over the country during the
past year or so , must pay Its penalty.
There must be a reaction following
such a splashing of human blood.
And that reaction will come in rigid
punishment of any person who takes
life , excepting in self defense. Even
a few Innocent ones may hang to pay
for the freedom of some of the success
ful brainstorm pleaders of the present.
A TOUGH PROPOSITION.
The Kansas City Journal gives an
llustratlon of the kind of propositions
n Missouri judge some times goes up
against. The case is one In which a
preacher , who is a good deal of a
tickler for the doctrine as it is re-
lorded , refuses to pay a subscription
if $5000 to the Christian college of
Columbia , Mo. , because the college
caches that Jonah was a nature fakir
ind refuses to swallow the Jonah
story. The preacher , who Is side-
topping the subscription , contends
.hat the college must teach the Bible
is it finds it.
Solomon , the wisest of monarchs ,
ho most ingenious of judges and the
most married of men , had merely to
decide which of two women was the
mother of a child. Later judges have
divided children betwen their parents ,
but Solomon was the first to propose
.ho division of ono child. Yet Solomon
performed a trilling feat compared
with the task of the Missouri judge
who must decide whether or not Jonah
was swallowed by the whale. On the
decision the disposition of $5,000 de
pends.
It might strike the average lay law
yer that the statute of limitations had
run against the evidence of eye wit
nesses in the Jonah case. Just how
the judge is going to gather the ma
terial upon which to base his decision
s a matter not uninteresting In Itself.
It would be rather difficult to secure
the attendance of Jonah himself ,
though about every third Democrat
you meet on the streets would tell you
that Mr. Bryan Is certainly a lineal
descendant. The whale Is probably
somewhere in the vicinage of Mr. Me-
Ginty at the bottom of the sea , and for
divers reasons can hardly be produced.
This only adds to the teasing knottl-
ness of the question. The decision will
be awaited with Interest.
Y. M. 0" . A. A HELP.
A recent speaker at the national
convention of the Y. M. C. A. said that
the country districts of the nation are
today greater vice-breeders than the
cities and that no form of vice exists
In the population centers which can
not bo duplicated In the rural districts.
It was argued that the free and easy
atmosphere of the country renders cor
ruption in morals easier than in the
formal and thickly populated cities.
Y. M. C. A. establishments were sug
gested as cures for these evils.
There can bo no question but that
Y. M. C. A. institutions do much to
offset the evil Influences which are
forever working upon the morals of
youth , both In the larger cities and In
the smaller places. A Y. M. C. A. with
a finely equipped building , with baths
and gymnasium , can not fail to work
for good results and uplift , both phys <
leal , moral and mental.
The statement was made in Norfolk
not long ago by an athlete of national
fame , that an athlete Is always a gen-
tlcman. And there Is moro or less
foundation for such an assertion. An
athlete , his arteries filled with rich
red blood and his muscles strong and
wholesome , In order to retain his
strength and energy , must keep always
"In training , " and that means that he
must live a wholesome life In all ways ,
The result Is that a community In
which pure athletics are a factor , IE
much stronger by virtue of this factor ,
That the people of any community
will bo better able to maintain health
nnd energy from the use of a
gymnasium Is a self evident fact. A
good gymnasium , llko a library and a
bath tub , Is a vital feature of modern
civilization nnd progress.
Norfolk has In prospect for the com
ing few months the securing of n Y.
M. C. A. building with all of its desir
able equipment. That the dream may
materialize Is just now the ho no of
those who have Interested themselves
In the matter , and the moro the sub
ject is being discussed , the more en
thusiasm Is there being developed in
favor of the project.
WILL NOT BECOME BURDENS.
Commenting upon the nervousness
of members of the Austrian relchstng
who have asked the government what
It proposes to do about an alleged
quarter of a million people svho it is
said will return from the United States
to the single province of Gallcla dur
ing the coming winter , and who it Is
feared by the Austrlans will only have
money enough to pay their passage
and bo destitute when they reach their
old homes , the Chicago Tribune says :
"No reply has been made to these
anxious Inqurlcs by the ministers.
Probably that Is because they do not
know but the danger Is greatly exag
gerated. They cannot tell how many
people are coming back , and whether
they will be a burden on the commun
ity or will be able to take care of
themselves.
"Presumably there Is no cause for
alarm In Gallcla or any other part of
Europe. The number of Europeans
returning to their old homes at this
season is unprecedentedly large , but
the immigration has been equally so.
So many have como that there have
been loud complaints hero and there
In Europe of a scarcity of labor. The
Swedish government set to work ser
iously to persuade American Swedes
to go back to Sweden. Now In Italy
as well as in Austria the fear is that
there will be too much labor because
of the exodus from the United States.
"Substantially all the people who
re now recrossing the Atlantic have
md work since they got here. They
mvo lived economically and have sav-
3d money. Some of them have sent
heir savings home. The postmaster
general says that a little over $72-
00,000 was sent to Europe In money
irders during the last fiscal year , about
iialf of it going to Italy , Austria-Hun
gary , and Russia. Most of the people
now returning to Europe ought to be
ible to get through the winter on the
money they have already sent over or
are taking with them.
"There does not seem to be a sub-
ttantial basis for the assumption that
ens of thousands of poverty stricken
men are now on their way from the
United States to Europe to add to the
cares and burdens of the rulers and
axpayers of that continent. Some of
those who are going back may be
destitute , but the great majority have
money enough to excite the admira
tion or envy of the stay-at-home
fellows. "
HIS FIRST STATEMENT FINAL.
And now comes an Associated Press
dispatch from Washington telling us
that , while many interviewers who
: iave lately seen the president have
declared that he Is not going to accept
another nomination , yet he has mode
10 special declaration along this line.
While third term boomers will probab
ly seek to take advantage of this last
dispatch as meaning that the president
Is not so unwilling to accept the nom
ination as might seem , yet there Is
no more reason now than there has
been at any time for believing that
Roosevelt intends to go back on his
word of election night when he said
that' under no circumstances would he
accept another nomination.
The president Is not willing to be
put In the attitude of making any
more statements whatever. Ho made
one statement , on the night of electIon -
Ion , in 1904 , and ho has desired all
along that should bo his final state
ment. Ho does not wish to be under
stood as having made any new state
ments because there are no new state
ments to make and if ho were to
accede to a demand for a new an
nouncement every month or two , there
would bo no soundness whatever at
tached to his election night declaration
which he intended should bo accepted
as final.
It has lately come out that the pres
ident made that election night state
ment after having carried the gist of
It around In his pocket for many weeks
Ho had gone over and over the wordIng -
Ing before he finally arrived at the
wording that suited him best.
When ho had finished , his announce
ment was final. He has not reiterated
the statement In so many words since
that time for the reason that he be
lieves the American people have In
him enough faith and confidence to
know that when he says a thing ho
means to stand by it. To repeat the
statement time after time would be
merely admitting that there were
foundation for not trusting implicitly
In his word. And for this reason , more
than any other , It Is believed the pres
ident has authorized the dispatch from
Washington , reports to the contrary
notwithstanding.
It was undoubtedly the interview
given out the other day by senators
who had just seen Roosevelt , that
occasioned this dispatch definitely
setting forth the fact that the presl-
dent had made no now announcement. |
In that Interview senators were quoted
ns saying that it had been deSlnltcly j
determined that Roosovclt would stick i
to his word nnd not become a candl- '
date. Hut this Is hardly necessary , I
since the president's best friends be-
Hove that he meant what ho said ,
anyway.
HAS THE WORLD GONE WRONG ?
Last Thursday was not only n day
of startling events In Norfolk but It
seemed to be a day when crime ran
riot all over the country , as portrayed
by the columns of the newspapers.
This condition of affairs induced a
soliloquizing mood on the part of the
editor of the Lincoln Journal , who
moralizes as follows :
"Readers of Thursday's news as re
viewed In Friday's newspapers may bo
excused for harboring a momentary
feeling of dismay. Deeds of violence
and less bloody forms of wickedness
had the run of the columns. A spec
tacular multiple wounding and mur
der In the Massachusetts state house ;
a terrifying murder and sulcldo in a
Nebraska town ; a bank robbery In
Kansas ; the arrest of a California par
ent for selling his daughter into slav
ery ; the wounding of seven persons by
a cocaine crazed negro In Arkansas ;
the Imminent hanging of three Ameri
can desperadoes In Mexico ; embezzle
ment by an American consul In China ;
suicide of an actress In Baltimore ;
troops sent to Goldfleld to prevent
strike violence ; these were a few of
the more prominent matters of news.
"There was sonic mention of more
hopeful matters. The "lid" is to go on
In New York. A rebate scheme was
nipped by the Interstate commerce
commission. The Mauretanla broke
the east going New York-Liverpool
ocean record. But these were less
prominent.
"Is the world going to the dogs ? If
one thinks of the news as a report of
the world's doings ho might easily
conclude so. Fortunately this Is the
wrong view. What Is news ? 'A new
or uncommon and more or less sur
prising thing ; a new or unexpected
event or occurrence , ' is a definition by
one of the authoritative dictionaries.
The regular order of events Is then not
news. "It is no news for the weak and
poor to be a prey to the strong and
rich , " wrote an Englishman a century
ago. In the past two or three years
the oppression of the poor by the rich
has been news , as the patronage of the
muckrakers denotes. Some have
bought the prevalence of that sort of
news a bad omen. As if for a thing
; o be so unusual as to bo news were
worse than for it to bo the usual ,
hence no news.
"All this does not make it pleasant
.0 see murder and arson and burglary
as prominent article ? of news. Those
hlngs are unpleasant because they re
mind us how far we are from being
as good as we ought to be. But so
eng as these things are told as news
we may be reassured by the knowledge
that crime is still exceptional. Dis
tasteful as it may be to know that
t occurs in even exceptional cases , It
s essential to know where wrong
exists in order to right it. "
TAFT'S TROUSERS.
All the world will sympathize with
Secretary of War Taft In his recent
sad trouser accident in Russia.
The secretary was placed in a bad
way by arriving at a dinner party
thirty-five minutes behind schedule.
There were distinguished guests at
the banquet and the delay of the Amer
ican secretary of war , in whoso honor
the banquet was given , naturally creat
ed considerable comment. For If It
is bad form for any mortal being to
be at all late at a dinner party , how
much more serious becomes the
offense when the person is the official
representative of a nation and when
the function is a banquet given him
in an official way by another great
nation ? It is little wonder that the
big secretary should feel perplexed.
But Taft is good natured. He appre
ciates a good Joke. Ho is willing even
to tell a joke on himself and par
ticularly when his only escape from
disgrace lay in speech.
So Taft told the Joke. It was on
him , all right , all right , and It is due
to become a classic in jokcdom. In
deed the trouser Incident is due to go
down In the annals of great men for
generations to come.
Taft's trousers had split at the
knees. He was already in the carriage
when his big fat knee burst through
his trouser leg nnd there was nothing
to do but return to the hotel for re
pairs.
And the bad feature of the whok1
affair was that al' ' the lest of ihe
secretary's wardrobe had been sent
along to the railway station.
If Taft had been an ordinary sized
mortal , perhaps the clothes of the ho
tel clerk might have been brought Into
action. Or ho might have borrowed
the trousers of the bell boy or the
barber or the but then Taft is Taft
and that settled the question.
It may bo imagined that the thirty-
five minutes during which the baggage
was returned from the station and the
secretary hustled into another pair ol
trousers , were anxious ones. It maybe
bo Imagined even that the secretary
sweat blood for about half an hour.
Ho was too busy to telephone that
ho had been delayed , though his genial
disposition returned the Instant the
banquet hosts , alarmed nt his non-
arrival , telephoned to Inquire what
had happened. At that moment the
secretary did not toll Just what had
happened. Ho said ho had boon un
avoidably delayed.
If It hadn't been n formal banquet ,
the chances arc the secretary would
have pone without eating for ho said
In Norfolk last summer that he Is
like a brar and can llvo off his fat if
ho has' to.
But this was n dinner of state and ,
trousers or no trousers , the appoint
ment had to be kept.
THE CONSUMPTIVE.
The Omaha Dally News publishes
an article on the treatment of con
sumption that is well worth preserv
ation. The article follows :
With the maze of "cures" of all sorts
offered the suffer of consumption ,
there is no wonder that the charities
of the country that are Interested In
doing something of real benefit , get
little chance to apply their efforts be
fore It Is too late.
The average person with consump
tion Is full of hope throughout his
usually long period of decline and
he is , therefore forever grasping at
the straws held out to him by the
quacks nnd charlatans.
In his desperate effort to get well
he spends all his own laid up money
and draws heavily upon the resources
of relatives and friends.
In the hope that some unnecessary
misery and much money may be saved
to persons afflicted with this disease ,
charitable organizations in other cities
are offering advice In which is em
bodied the wisdom of the greatest
authorities on the prevention and cure
of consumption.
So sensible is this advice that The
Daily News produces It herewith In
the hope that it may do some good :
If you have consumption : That the
treatment Is (1) ( ) fresh air , (2) ( ) rest , (3) ( )
food. Medicine will help , but it is
not so important. Therefore-the cure
Is principally in your own hands.
1. Fresh air : Don't live in rooms
where there is no fresh air.
Don't work in rooms where there
Is no fresh air.
Don't sleep in rooms where there
Is no fresh air.
Take all the fresh air into your
lungs that you can by deep breathing.
Stay out of doors all you can.
Don't be afraid of cold air.
Remember that sunshine kills the
germs.
Sleep with at least one window open
in your room.
2. Rest : Go to bed early , sleeping
at least eight hours.
If you have to work , rest all you can
while at home.
Don't worry. Worrying is not rest
ful , but harmful.
3. Food : Eat all the good , plain
nourlhing food that you can , principal
ly eggs and milk.
Drink plenty of pure water.
If you suspect that you are losing
appetite and weight , coughing , feeling
tired all the time , go at once to your
family physician. Don't spend your
time and money on patent medicine
or the so-called consumption cures.
Be hopeful and cheerful. You can
be cured if you begin early enough.
AROUND TOWN.
It's almost too exciting to have
Uncle Tom and Santa Clans strike
town within a fortnight of each other.
There Is one woman in Norfolk who
has every Christmas present bought ,
wrapped up and ready to give two
weeks from next Wednesday.
One man In Norfolk debated for a
while and then decided that it would
be more of a distinction to be able to
say that he had never seen "Uncle
Tom's Cabin" than to see it ; so he
stayed away.
ATCHISON GLOBE SIGHTS.
A husband made good by nagging ,
Is a slave and liable to run off.
Possibly you are often a bore to po
lite people when you do not show it.
If you will hand a fried lemon ,
If you will hand a friend lemon ,
When some men try to do better , It
Is generally remarked that they do
not try very hard.
One of the funniest things In this
world Is to see a woman who isn't
used to it , make change.
When you talk foolishness , you not
only waste your time , but you waste
the time of the other man.
Some dogs are as cross as some
men ; whistle to some dogs , and they
pay no attention to you.
The average woman isn't satisfied
with telling a polite Ho ; she Insists
upon her husband agreeing with her.
Girls do not think other girls true
friends unless they take sides in their
quarrels to the extent of making faces
at the enemy.
Favorite saying of women : "You
haven't been around to hear our new
preacher. "
What a difference It makes when
you feel good ! Why not devote a lit-
tie attention to feeling good ? That Is ,
why not eat and drink with a little
care ? Such a course will pay big
dividends.
A girl loves to road a letter as she
walks along a street , particularly If
It Is In a hold handwriting that looks
llko A Man's.
When the world never hears how
moan n husband u mini IK , It praises
his wife "for keeping her troubles to
herself. "
The relatives of a deaf person al
ways make this kindly remark ; that
ho can hear anything It Isn't Intended
ho should hear.
Because a girl of sixteen laughs at
a man's joke , he should not Imagine
ho Is a great wit ; a girl of sixteen
laughs because she is sixteen.
If you are Idle , your excuse for call
ing on a busy man Is "I will not take
up much of his timo. " But the busy
man will have other callers during the
day.
So far as known , no ono in Atchl-
son has yet had his feelings har
rowed by receiving ono of the now
10 gold pieces from which the words
In God Wo Trust" are omitted.
The opening stocks of the merchants
for holiday displays indicate- that this
will be an unusually trying winter for
Poor Father.
Men who have had expcricnco say
that n majority of family rows como
about because the wife Insists on stir-
Ing the milk just before her husband
puts it on his dessert ; ho generally
likes to have the top cream glide into
his dish.
The modern kind of a bandit Is
worse than the old : In olden times a
man rode up to a house on a bold
black charger , and , picking up a
maiden rode off with her. In these
days , a woman in a sweet , gentle voice
gets the girl over the telephone , and
steals her by offering her more wages.
The modern kind of a bandit Is an
object of greater hatred than the old
kind ever was.
Some women just naturally know
how to use dry goods and wo Imagine
they do not work any harder than
those who think , and think , and
think , and look slouchy. In the same
way , some men can do a thing easily ,
while others can't. That's about all
there Is in luck ; a man born with
poor taste and little sense , Is "un
lucky , " while a man born with abili
ty , and a little common sense , is
"lucky. "
If nature didn't intend a girl to take
to frills , ruflles and curls , it is a cari
cature of fashion when she attempts
It. An Atchison girl was built on the
straight , simple and uncurled lines ,
but she is trying to make herself over ,
and Is wearing marcelled hair , curls ,
waves , etc. Sometimes these waves
hang on to her left ear , and sometimes
on the right ear , but they arc never
In the right place. It Isn't In her to
be frizzed , and she might as well ad
mit it and drop back to nature's plan.
Recently at the theatre wo saw a
young husband como in without his
wife. Wo have been contending for
liberty for husbands for many years ,
but really , It looked tough to see that
husband come In without his wife.
Two widows were talking of the
great blows they had suffered. "The
greatest blow in my life , " said ono
with a far-away look In her eyes , "was
the death of my husband just a week
after he had had his salary raised. "
And the other , knowing of no blow
that could be greater , had nothing to
say.
It Is frequently remarked that every
young lady who marries In Atchison
Is "beautiful and accomplished , " or a
"society belle. " This Is a delicate way
the people have of hinting that the
newspapers are not reliable. But will
some of the objectors tell what else
the newspaper could say ? They could
not very well refer to the brides as
ugly invalids , or masses of face pow
der and cosmetics. No reporter with
regard for his personal safety would
care to say that the bride spoilt a val
uable collection of dress goods with
her miserable figure or that her tooth
looked as though they were In need
of a scrub. We know that a little
conceit and ability to drum "Silvery
Waves , " is frequently referred to as
musical culture , and familiarity of the
light fiction of the day is an accom
plishment , but , so far as weddings are
concerned , wo are not prepared to
change the old rule in reporting them.
Wo value our life too highly.
OVER NORTHWEST PRAIRIES
_
Bonesteel News : While in Sioux
City recently United States Senator
Gamble who was on his way to Wash
ington to attend the opening of con
gress , was interviewed by a reporter
and stated that the opening of Trlpp
county would In all probability occur
about the first of October next year.
Wayne Herald : Sholcs Is to make
an experiment of the central school
system that in several communities
has been put Into practice with good
results. Three school districts , No.

new central school district. This now
district voted $5000 bonds nnd erect-
en a fine modern four room school
building in Slioles. The now building -

the school building at Winsldo except
that it Is of frame Instead of brick.
There is ninety-five or a hundred
pupils within the now district and the

OVER NORTHWEST PRAIRIES.
Naper Enterprise : Old "Sport , "
Louts Jensen's faithful companion and
watchdog , has at last pamuid away ,
being assisted Into dog heaven by the
merciful hand of Henry Tlenkon last
Sunday forenoon. Sport was the con
stant companion of the Jensen family
for many years , and In sunshlno and
sorrow was always at least the ono
friend who could bo depended upon.
When Mr. Jensen moved to town ,
Sport became ono of the best known
characters on the street , always mind
ing his own biiHlncsH , and keeping
careful track of his master. But with
Increasing ago ho acquired rheuma
tism and a falling memory , and It wan
known for a long time that death
would bo a merciful relief. Mr. Jen
sen could not mourn for any friend
moro sincerely than ho docs Sport
Lincoln Star : Chief Garno Warden
George L. Carter has returned from
Cherry county , having completed the
construction of the branch fish hatch
eries at Red Deer lake and on the Mln-
nnclmduza river near Valentino , Tlio
water from the lake was piped Into
several natural ponds near Red Deer
lake and these are all ready for the
bass spawn with which they will bo
stocked this winter. The eggs for the
trout hatchers at Valentino will bo
stripped and shipped by express to
the hatchers. The hatcheries were
constructed at an expense of less than
half of the appropriation of $2,000.
Mr. Carter superintended the building
of the dams and ditches himself. Red
Deer lake Is now frozen hard.
Grand Island Independent : One ot
the longest and most hitter and gen
erally painful newspaper fights that
over took place in Nebraska promises
to have been terminated lust week
when Editor Sprecker of the Schuylcr
Free Lance and Attorney Worts , In
terested In the Schuylcd Sun gathered
together their respective collection of
judgements , libel suits , awards of
damages still held up In the courts ,
traded 'em and finally wiped off the
state , Editor Sprecker agreeing not
to refer to any past act of Wertz for
five years. The future is not "tied up"
but evidently Mr. Wertz Is In hope
that ho can so conduct himself in the
next five years as to give the other
no reason for current criticism and
that by the end of five years Mr.
Sprecker will have so fixedly formed
the habit of letting his opponent alone
that ho will have forgotten all about
the old troubles.
Boemer Times : There has been
considerable space used In some of
the daily papers tolling of the won
derful work of the new corn-husking
machines put on the market this fall.
This paper copied some of the articles
as items of general Information. But
now wo hear different reports. Chas.
Grunke and one of his brothers
bought one of the machines and , after
giving it a thorough test , Charles re-
ports to us that the machine Is no
good. They have laid It aside and are
husking their corn In the old fash
ioned way. We doubt not but that the
time will como when these machlnei
will work successfully , but until that
time comes it is very foolish for the
farmers to buy them outright unless
a good guarantee is given that in case
the machine does not do what Is
claimed for it , It may be returned.
Herrlck Press : There Is a some
what amusing story reaches us from
Dallas , which has Its growth and ori
gin in the present local strife between
Gregory and Dallas for the trade of
their surrounding country. Dallas re
cently organized a commerical club
and to promote Its Interests and stim
ulate trade the club It is said conclud
ed to have the best hog market , at any
price. They started In to pay a quar
ter of a cent over market prices at
all times and quietly advertised the
fact. Well , the way they got hogs-
was a caution. However , it soon leak
ed out that the buyers in Gregory were
paying the market price then hiring
the hogs hauled to Dallas and sold
to Dallas buyers at the quarter cent
advance thus clearing up 15 cents a
hundred without any risk.
Clearwater Record : A party of
hunters from Nellgh were up at Val
entine hunting last week. They were
out in the canyons hunting quail when
by some unlucky chance Richard Rol
lins shot B. J. Wright in the arm nnd
face. They picked eighty shot out of
Mr. Wright , but none of them pene
trated very deep ami he don't antici
pate any trouble with the wounds but
It was a pretty close call. Ono shot
did graze the eyeball , but it didn't
seem to affect the sight.
Creighton Liberal : The many read
ers of the bright little dally at Nor
folk rejoice in the fact that prosperity
dwells In the News habitation and that
a now perfecting press puts this pub
lication In a class by Itself In northern
Nebraska. No wall of despair , no cry
against the extraordinary high price of
print paper over seems to echo from
the Norfolk business office , and man
of us would llko to know
brother Huso keeps his ra.
