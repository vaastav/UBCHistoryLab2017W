TARIFF.
It is quite evident ibul the financial tiecesi
ot-s ot ttie GoVt riuiietit v\ i!'f rcfJirh a aiodifi
catioii ut' lite tariff duricg lite present session,
for the pttrpose ot iticreasitig the revenue. In
tt lis aspect k desire to reiterate the recommen
dation contained in my last two annual messa
ges, iu tavor of iniposfng specific instead Of
advalor. ttt duties oil ail imported articles to
which these can be properly specified. From
long observation and experience, I am cotiviu
Ct-d that specific duties are necessary, both to
protect the revenue and secure lo otrr luarruftrc-
interests that aiuonot of *Tifnleuta! en-
Couiagetuetit which Unavoidably results from a
revenue tariff'.
As an abstiact proposition it may be admit
ted that ad ralore/n Unties Would, in theory, be
the most just and equal. Rut if the experi
ence of this and of ad other commercial na
tions lias demonstrated that suclt duties cau
nut lie assessed and collected without great
'rands upon tiie revenue, then it is the pTrt ol
, wisdom lo resort to specific duties. Indeed,
Tarn the veiy nature of an ad valorem du'v,
to must be the result. UndeT it the inevita
•tr-'isequeuce is that loreigu goods will be
--cd at less than their true value. The
-toury will, therefore, lose the duly on the
--Ttiice between their real and ficticious val-
I ®t. and to this extent we are defrauded.
Re temptations which ad valorem duties pre
j ? fct to a dishonest importer are irresitable. —
Uii object is to pass his goods through the
fjatow-llouse at tiie very lowest valuation
i"Wessaiey to save thetn from confiscation. Iu
tins lie too often succeed*, in spile ot the vig
ilimee ot the revenue officers. Hence the rc-
Wt to talse mvuices.one trfr the puretiaser and
•Wher lur the Cits tout House, aniJ to other
expedients to defraud the Government. The
loaesst importer produces his invoice to the col
rector, stating the actual price ut which he
purchased toe articles alnoad. Not so the
bisliouest importer and the agent of the for
l-o uiaiiuiacture. And here it may be ob
' lv td that a very large proportion of the
toiiu;uctures imported Irom abroad are cou
-5, 3 r| ietl lor sttle to commission merchants who
*'f Uit -' rL ' agents employed by the munufuctur
e " In such cases no actual sale has been
Me to fix their value. The foreign mauo
-7' !rer ,i' ' le he dishonest,prepares an invoice
i " l,; l-'bods, not at their actual value, but ut
vcry lowest rate necessary to escape de
u'-" 1 - Li this manner the dishonest imjyort
, ai ' ,J l ' ie loreign manufacturer enjoy a decid
a< vantage over the hottest merchant. They
enabled to undersell the fair trader,
1 i nve linn from the market. In fact the
pwaiion of this system has already driven

foods in 10 the n PP raisers of foreign
> 'lO receive but small salaries, and
might, by uudervalution iu a few cases, render
themselves independent.
Besides, specific duties best conform to the
requisition iu the constitution that "no prefer
ence shall be given by any regulation of com
merce or revenue to the ports of one State
over those of another." Under our ad valor
em system such preferences are to some extent
inevitable, and complaints have olten been
made that the spirit of this provision has been
violated by a lower appraisment of the same
articles at one port than at another.
An impression strangely enough prevails ro
some extent that specific duties are necessarily
protective duties. Nothing can be more fai
iacious. Great Britain glories in free trade,
and yet her whole revenue from imports is at
the present moment collected under a system
of specific duties. It is a striking fact in this
connection that, in the commercial treaty ot
the 23d of January, 1860, between France
and England, one of the articles provides ad
valorem duties which it imp ses shall be couvert
j ed into specific duties within six months (rem
its date, and tlleSe are to be ascertained by
making an average of life prices for six months
previous to that time. The reverse of the
proposition would be nearer to the truth, be
cause a much larger amount of revenue
would be collected by merely converting the
ad valorem duties of a tariff into equivalent
specific duties. To this extent the revenue
wodld be increased, and in the game prooora
tion the specific duty might be diminished.
Specific duties would secure to the Ameri
can manufacturer the incidental protection to
which he is fairly entitled under a revenue tar
iff, and td this* surely no person would object.
The framers of (lie existing tariff luite gone
further, and in a liberal spirit have discrimi
nated in favor of iarge and useful branches of
our manufactures, not by rafting tlie rate of
duty upon the importation of similar articles
from abroad, but what is the same in effect,
by admitting articles free of duty which cuter
into the composition of their fabrics.
Under the present system it has been often
trulj - remarked that the incidental protection
decreases when the manufacturer needs it
most, and increases rlien he needs it least,
und Coiistitdtes a sliding scale which always
operates against him. The revenues of the
country are subject to similar fluctuation. In
stead of approaching a steady standard, as
Wofll'l be the case under a system of specific
duties, they sink and rise with the sinking and
rising prices of articles iu foreign countries. It
would not be difficult for Congress to arrange
a system of specific duties which would afford
additional stability both to our revenue and our
manufactures, and without injury or injustice
to any interest of the country. This aright
be accomplished by ascertaining the average
value of any given article for a series or years
at the place of exportation, and by simply
conve.ting the rate of ad valorem duty upon
it which might be deemed necessary for rev
enue purposes, into the form of a specific duty.
Such an arrangement could not injure the con
sumer. If he should pay a greater amount Of
tint? one year, this would bo count" rbalaneed
by a lesser amount the next, and in the end
the aggregate would be the same.
I desire to call your immediate attention to
the present condition of the Treasury, so ably
anil clearly presented by the Secretary in his
report to Congress ; and to recommend i hut
measures be promptly adopted to enable it to
di charge its pressing obligations. The other
recommendations of the report are weil worthy
of your favorable consideration.
I herewith transmit to Congress the reports
of the Secretaries of War, of the Navy, of
the Interior, and of the Pu-t Muster General.
Therecomttcfida'tfons and suggestions which
they contain are highly valuable, ami deserve
your careful attention.
The report of the Post-Master-Genera! de
tails lhe circumstances under which Cornelius
Yanderbilt, on my request, agreed, in the
month of July lest, lo c..rr* the ocean mails
between our Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Had
he not thus acted, this important intercom
muuicatiori must have been suspended, at least
for a season. The Postmaster General had no
power to make him any other compensation,
than tin* postages ott the mail matter which
he might carry. It was known at the
time that these postages would fall far short
of an adequate con?p*nsJtion. as well as
of the sum which the same service had previ
ously cost the Government Mr. Vandcrbilt,
in a commendable spirit, was willing to rely
upon the justice of Congress to make np tlie
deficiency i and I, therefore, recommend that
an appropriation may be granted for this pur
pose. •
I should do great injustice to the Attorney-
General tfere I t6 omit the mentib'u of his di
tingnished services in the measures adopted
and prosecuted by him for the defense of the
Government against numerous and unfounded
claims to iand in California, purporting to have
been made by thh Mexican Government pre
vious to the treaty of cession: The successful
opposition to these claims has saved to the
United States public property worth many
millions Of dollars, and to individuals holding
title under them to at least an equal amount.
It has been represented to me, ffcnr sources
which I deem reliable, that the inhabitants in
several portions of Kansas have been reduced
nearly to a state of starvation, on account of
tiie almost total failure of their crops, while
the harvests in every other portion of the
country have been abundant. The prospect
before them for the approaching Winter is
well calculated to enlist the sympathies Of ev
ery heart. The destitution appears to be so
general that it cannot lie relieved by private
contributions, and they are in such indigent cir
cumstances as to be unable to purchase the
necessaries of life for themselves. I refer the
subject (o Congress. If any constitutional
measure for their relief can be devised, I would
recommend its adoption.
I cordially commend to your favorable ri •
gard the interests of the people of this Dis
trict. Tficy are eminently entitled to your
consider,itian, especially since unlike the Bta!G,
they can appeal to no government except that
of the Union. JAMES BUCHANAN.

TOWANDA:
Thursday Morning, December 6, 1860.
To the Patrons of the Reporter.
Iu accordance with the notice which was
given last week, the present number of the
Reporter appears under the name of a new
publisher. In undertaking the manage
ment of a newspaper, it is usual to indulge in
a " salutatory," in which is set forth the course
the paper is intended to pursue, and the fea
tures which are intended to (rcofflrhend it to the
public.* 1 We hopd we may be exCnsed from
doing either. The Reporter has so long been
a pleasant visitor to the fireside, and has so
long, by (he advocacy of those principles
which have made the name of the country n
" tower of strength," merited the confidence
and respect of its patrons under its former
publisher, that it would be presumptions in us
to say any more than that it rill be our con
stant effort to maintain for it that preeminence
which it now possesses. How well we may
be able to accomplish this, time alone will de
termine ; but we hope that with the assistance
we shall from time to time receive trom the
pen of Mr. Gooritfcrt, that the change will be
less a change than may have been anticipa
ted.
We are of those who believe that the value
of a newspaper is not measured by the length
of its articles, nor bjr the number of lines
that may be written upon subjects which
may be its editors particular hobby ; but rather
from its judicious seiections, its collation of
news, and brief and concise articles upon what
may be the exciting topics of the day ; and we
shall endeavor to shape our course accord
ingly.
We shall endeavor to procure ns far as pos
sible, all the local news of interest, and to
this end we hope to receive aid from friends in
town and county who will interest themselves
in the matter. A good array of local trans
actions speaks well of the activity of a town,
and we hope as we become better acquainted
with the people to be able tcmake this feature
interesting.
The ready pay system which has been the
rule of the paper heretofore, but Which lias
not been rigidly adhered te'o, will hereafter be
striekiy enforced. YTe believe it to'be for the
best interest of both parties, and we hope our
friends will view it accordingly. We shall
endeavor to make the paper an equivalent for
t.i'e dollar, and this can oniy be done as we
have the means to do it.
That our intercourse may be pleasant and
profitable, ir.'j that tlie paper may command
that generous support which we shall labor to
insure for it, is the earnest wish of
