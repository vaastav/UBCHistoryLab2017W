Seoretary Wilson, of the depurtment
of ai'iriiltuie, in hia annual report de-
lores the fart that so few of the farm
s' class of the country pay any atten
tion to ectucation in agriculture, Dut
tate utut the attendance at the agri-ultui-al
colleges 19 increasing, and the
emand for expert help from the de
partment is greater man can no sup
plied. He has applied to the civil serv
ice commission in vain for help, fur men
lih the technical knowledge wanted
re not to be had. It is the same with
egard to persons well informed with
egurd, to the animal industry. At the
uggestion of Secretary "Wilson the civ-
1 service commission will hereattei
keep a register of graduates of the ag-
.ultural colleges endowed by congress
for the education of farmers, and from
his registry the department will ap-
point young men as assistants lor me
scientific divisions. This arrangement
opens the way for a graduate to pursue
his studies while on a salary, and to be
come expert in his chosen field of labor,
n which competition will not be so
reat as in the ordinary pursuits of life.
The secretary is doing a practical as
,-ell as just act in offering employment
to young men who acquire special
nowledge at the colleges.

ering the case of Mr. Roberts will go to

Ex-Governor Hogg, who has Colonel
Bryan in Texas, appears to have put a
padlock upon the mouth of the Nebras
kan. No word of comment has com
from the colonel since President Mc
Kinley's gold standard message was
printed. In other years the country
would have been filled with the lurid
voice of the silver candidate had such
a message been 'issued.
So far only one paper in New Mexic
has advocated the leasing of the grass
ing lands belonging to the public do
main, which would ruin the smaller
owners of sheep and cattle, who could
not afford to lease and fence great
areas, and would result in a monopol
of the best lands. And that paper is
the Deming Headlight, that seems
have the unenviable faculty of gettin
on the wrong side of every issue where
the interests of New Mexico are, con
cerned.

While the outside world may think ll
were better If the Boers should be van-
quished and England assume sovereign

they may feel just as much concerned

war has been made by a foreign coun

That Great Britain will win in the end
can scarcely be doubted, for her hand
has been stayed with but rare excep
Hons, and her wealth is great. Though
her soldiers have learned a bitter les
son and their fancied Invincibility has
been a disappointment in a contest with
those who depended less upon knowl
edge of the science of war, the supe
riority of numbers must triumph.
Assurances have been given to the ef
fect that the tariff and internal revenue
acta will not be touched during the
present session of congress, except i
unimportant points, if at all. The pro
posed currency legislation will not dis
turb business. Congress will probably
devote most of its time to the consider

his seat in the senate, and It can be
proved, he should be bounced even if

Oh, the Pain of
Rheumatism!
Rheumatism often causes the most in-
tense suffering. Many have for years
vainly Bought relief from this disabling
disease, and are to-day worse off than
ever. Kheumattsm is a blood disease,
and Swift's Speoiflc is the only cure, be
cause it is the only remedy which can
reach such deep-seated diseases.
A few years ago I was taken with inflamma
tory Rheumatism, which became bo intense
that I was for weeks unable to walk. I tried
several prominent physi
cians and took their treat
ment faithfully, but was
unable to get the slight
est relief. In fact, my con.

worse, the disease spread

The Democrats are sometimes pleased
at the action of a Republican official
One case in point was the resignation o
Speaker Reed, who was one too many
for them whenever they had a scheme
to hinder tha Republicans in congress
But they are not getting half so muc
enjoyment out of the change to Speaker
Henderson as they hoped, for he has the
benefit of the effective Reed rules to ai
him and the slender majority of his par
ty. While he may not crush the minor
Ity members as emphatically and with
as little regard tor tneir reelings, t-n
new speaker is strictly business, and
will not permit delay and foolish techni
calities to bar the way to legislation,
The minority have no new objection t
urge to the passage of a finance bill, an
tha determination of the speaker and
the majority not to allow the session to
be wasted in discussion of this one
measure is sensible. The week which
will be allowed for speeches and debat
upon- the su'bject should be ample fo:
every one who has anything to say to
unburden himself. The country expect;
many important matters to be weighe
and acted upon, so the effort of Demo
crats to use up the session in- arguments
upon the one bill will not be approved,
Their claims that they are being gaggei
by being limited to a few days' time i
speechmaking will not create much
sympathy. The money question has had
ample discussion in the last few years.

who does not already know whether he
will vote for a bill establishing gold as
the standard. So far as any result upo:

Talking Through His Sombrero.
Mr. Loving, the optimist from For
Worth, has again reached Kansas City
and secured the ears of reporters of th
city by the Kaw, and tells them that hi
big cattle deal has again some chances
of being completed. When it is finished
his company, he says, will own the ma
Jority of the largest ranches in Ne
Mexico and Texas. The syndicate
would own 1,000,000 cattle, twenty acre
of land for each animal, and have $50,
000,000 capital. Mr. Loving, however,
has come down from the perch whic
he occupied a few months ago when h
said he had secured abundant capita
and mow declares that ranchmen will
gladly take half the price of their
ranches and cattle in stock in the com
pany, and the other half of the capital
will be secured, provided times are no
too hard In! February. Certainly the
Texas promoter 1s talking through his
sombrero. Cattlemen were not bor
yesterday, nor are they going to give u
their property for stock in a compan
which would be .managed by easier
men, and In which the minority Btock
owner would have no effective voice
Cattle and ranches are as good
money these days, and a long ways bet
ter than a lot of paper certificates of
stock. New Mexico has no ranches that
will go in on this deal If It ever be com
pleted, without cash is forthcoming
And as for the majority of big ranches
In the territory being on the string of
the Fort Worth promoter, if he has op
Hons upon any in this territory, they
are confined to the plains east of th
Pecos river, and Texas cattlemen con
trol them. New Mexico cattlemen are
enlarging their operations now, since
they have been able to sell their beer
cattle at good prices, are stocking up
for more extensive 'breeding of a better
grade of animals, andi are mot hunting

erty for paper that does not bear the

that it is class legislation of the most
virulent type, having for its object the
uplifting of the few to the downfall of
the many.
While the project looks like a paying
one on its face, the Review is inclined to
the belief that were the law in opera
tion for a time the promoters, who now
think it such a great thing for them
selves, and prospective investors, would
And they had a white elephant on their
hands. The experience of all large land
holders in N'ew Mexico is that the re
turns from their holdings do not pay
the taxes, and most of them have been
willing to sell to smaller holders, who
can look more closely after the business
and thereby reap a profit, where the
large holder loses money.
While it is true that the small, holder
would suffer at the start from such a
law, the land-grabbers who paid the
government even 10 cents an acre rent
would find they could not realize enougc
on the investment to keep up the rental,
much less expend large sums in fencing
to keep off encroachment.
The scheme may be a paying one on
paper, but woe to the capitalist who is
enticed into such a delusive investment

TAXPAYERS TAKE INTEREST.
(Taos Cresset.)
The remarks of Judge McFie upon
the question of taxation, and assessment
should be heeded by . every citizen of the
county who takes interest in its public
welfare anil progress. The judge be-
ie-ves that the man who pays a portion
of the expense of the county will take
a greater interest in the administration
of its affairs, and his opinion upon this
subject Is sustained by events.
MINES IN DEMAND.
(Silver City Enterprise.)
The large number of mining me!
seeking to invest capital in Grant coun
ty indicates the wide popularity of this
section for genuine, good mining prop
erties and profitable investments, Dai
ly there arrives a number of anxious In
quiries for gold and copper properties
located in this sectiun, both by letter
and by representatives of the capitalist
east, who come prepared toexpeit any
property that shows any indication of
becoming a producer. It Is a very poo-'
week indeed that a good-sized mining
sale- Is not conwunvmated1 In this county.
ENTERPRISING FA RM ERS.
(Socorro Republican.)
We will very soon see a practical test
as to the amount of water which may be
obtained by pumping from our Rio
Grande bottom. The farmer of San
Antonio are about to contract with Mr.
A lair, a merchant of that town, for the
erection, of a steam pumping plant near
Luis Lopez's place for the purpose of
keeping their ditch full of water during
the coming farming season. We wish
success to our enterprising neighbors,
and hope to see their example followed
throughout our own and neighboring
counties.

A NATIONAL LEASE LAW.
(Tularosa Democrat.)
A law of this kind would place 1t in
the power of corporations- and men- of
large means to not only control the
range, but fix the price of stock, and the
small owners would be forced to sell at
such prices as they could obtain from
the leasers.
The thing is preposterous, and the
damaging effects that would accrue
from its enactment cart be seen at a
glance. The grasping, avaricious hand
of g'twd can be seen behind it. It Is
death to the small cattle owner. It will
mean added hardships to the poor, and
more 'wealth to the rich. Let us hope
that the voice of the small owner In his
plea for justice will not be ignored, and
the lease law will be crushed in its in
clpiency by the all-powerful hand of
right.
