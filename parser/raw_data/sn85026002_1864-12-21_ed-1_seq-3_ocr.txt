Just as we said was certain to ke the case,

did the Journal admit even the possibility of
such a thing T Does anybody remember ?
Surely not before the election I Solicitor
Whiting notified tha people of the country, a
fee days prior to the election that the last
draft had furnished men enough to complete
the little job of "crushing out the rebellion,'!
and that no further draft would be necessary.
When did tbe Journal take issue with the
august and veracious Solicitor aud asssrt
even the possibility that he had lied to the

Mr. Sumner, from the Committee on For
eign AO'airs reported the following substitute
far the House resolution providing for the
termination of the recipmc'iv tri'v of June
5th, 1854, between the United Slates and
Great Britain.
Whereas, It i provided that the reciprocity
treaty, concluded at Washington, June 61b,
1854, bnwet a tile UniteU Slates on one part.
and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireluud on tbe other part, that lb treaty shall
remain in lorce tea ysats from the date at
which it shall have come into operation; and
further that after the expiration of twelve
months, alter either of .the high contracting
parties shall pive notice to the other of its
wish to teraiinate the same ; and whereas, it
appears by a proclamation of the United
States, bearing dale the 16th of March, 1855,
that the treaty came into operation on that
day, and whnrras, further, it appears that it is
no longer the iuterest of the United Stales to
continue the same in force; therefore
Revived, by the Senate and House of Rn
resentalives ol the United States of America,
in Congress assembled, That notice be given
of the termination of the reciprocity treaty,
eccording to the provision therein contained
for the termination of the same. The Presi
dent of the United States is hereby charged

desired the passage of the resolution. It bed

why, and Colonel Woolford was in jail in

ance which b winbed cted upon, a bill to

AFTERNOON REPORT.
AFTERNOON REPORT. History of a Rebel Scout.
New York, December 21. Tbe morning
papers have nothing from Sherman.
The Herald's City Point correspondence, of
tue 1 1 in, says:
The notorious rebel scout, Sergeant Wm.
E. Waterbury, ol the Third North Carolina
regiment of cavalry, was mortally wounded
on Thursday last.
Waterbury has been long known to our
authorities as vigilant and troublesome
scout, with bravery enough to venture into
our camps, and sagacity sufficient lo avoid
detection and elude pursuit. He has infnsled
the country between the James river and our
left beyond Petersburg all summer.
All attempts to entrap hint have hitherto
failed. Small parlies have been sent in his
pursuit, but he could never be overtaken or
identified. But a few weeks ago he came lo
the Wells House on morning befor sunrise
and seriously threatened the capture uf a
safeguard. This within half range of three
Union forts, aud said to he within minnie
range of General Meade's headquarters. It
appears Waterbury cam to our pickets
dressed in Union uniform, representing him
self as one of our soldiers, aud requesting to
be directed to his regiment
Contrary In bis expectations, a soldier was
sent with him asa guide. On the way he in
duced the guide to halt to drink, when he
seised his musket and made him follow him
as prisoaer.
At night he fell asleep while guarding tha
Union soldi er, who in turn seised the musket
snd shot him.
