Official Paper of Coconino County
Official Paper of the Town of Flagstaff
Some winters have been dull in
Flagstaff, but there is every evi
dence that the winter of 1909-10
will be a busy one.
Walter Weflman Pays' Dr, Cook's
claims are rediculous. The type
writer Walter discovered the pole
with must have been repaired.
It is rum6r'ed that Dr. Newell,
chief of the declamation service is
to resign and engineer L. C. Hill in
charge of the Roosevelt work, is to
take' his place.
The man who talks to his custo
mers once a week in a good adver
tisement usually gets the pick of
the trade. It shows he is thinking
of their wants and i3 trying to
please. , ,
Congress convened Monday. We
didn't get statehood Tuesday as our
democratic friends demanded but
there fs every evidence that it is
coming earlier intheJ8ession than
was at first supposed.
If cement walks laid in Flagstaff
the1 past summer stand the test of
winter, the whole city will have
tne'm' in a comparatively short time
ai'J"d',th'e saving will be great aside
fiom appearance being worth the
clist.
Coconino county will receive the
aeat little sum'of 114,997.42 as its
pro rata share of the 25 per cent of
the total receipts of the Forest Ser
vice for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1909. This means Coconino
county has paid into the govern
ment for timber and grazing fees
during the fiscal -year, $59,989.68.
It might be wel for President
Zelaya of Nicaragua'to either come
through or slip a slat in the rear
part of his neither garments.
Brother Knox has our permission
to spank the ingrate soundly and
such a proceeding would meet with
the hearty approval of the Ameri
can public. They evidently' mis
take kindness for weakness.
Afler the self-righteous "insur
gents," as they style themselves,
are through with their little brief
display of themselves, Taft. Can
non and the republican party will
go right on attending to the wants
of the majority of the people. The
people are awakening to the fact
that it is merely a private sore toe
instead of an attempt to save the
country. ...
Mall order1 houses are nhVays af
ter 'business. Local business men
who go after it gel it. If you sit
down and howl because trade goes
to mailorder houses no consider
abVice is fractured, but the river
of "trade sloshes right along and
George and' Lilly, Billy and Kate
rndrely wonder why you don't
change vour grouch for a bottle of
Ketchup. Be Bill with the glad
hand rather than Tom with the sore
toeJ'
President Taft's message is in
the hands of the printers and Con
tains about 16.000 words. So far
as can be iearnd there are no swear
words mixed in among them,
though the insugents and President
Zelaya may find a few that are real
mean.
The stockmen are rapidly coining
alive ns to the advantages of pub
lishing their stock brands and are
also interetsed in having a stock
paper to care for their interests in
Northern Arizona. The Sun is
rapidly spreading out among the
stockmen all over the north and it
is to their interest to see it spread.
Ask your friends if they take it.
The possibility of a national
strike among railroad employees is
anything but a pleasant outlook in
the business world at the present
time. It is time that a special
commission was appointed for tho
settlement of questions of this
character. A fight of this kind
does not only injure the fighters
but every interest in the country
big or little. It isn't a question of
the right or wrong of either side
but the unavoidable wrongs to the
general public, and the people are
the greatest loosers every time.
Came Home With the Game.
W. H. Cox arrived home today
after ari'absence of several weeks
in Flagstaff and on the range. He
landed three fine bucks. The snow
drove the deer down and while six
beauties were standing near togeth
er, the hunter happened along, and
before Mr, Deer realized three were
dead. This was fortunate, for the
deer have been exceedingly scarce
and, hard to get. Jerome Copper
A deal was recently closed by the
Fred Harvey people for land at Del
Rio where a large dairy will be
conducted for the purpose of sup
plying cream, milk and butter to
Harvey houses along the line of the
Santa Fe.
Croup Cured and a Child's Life Saved.
"It affords me great pleasure to
add my testimony to that of the
thousands who have been bene
fited by Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy. My child, Andrew, when
only three years old, was taken
with a severe attack of croup, and
thanks to the prompt use of Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy his life
was saved and today he is a robust
and healthy boy," says Mrs. A.
Coy, Jr., of San Antonio, Texas.
This remedy has been in use many
years. Thousands of mothers keep
it at hand, and it has never been
known to fail. For sale by all
dealers.

certificates of naturalization,
(second papers) are notified that
hearings of applications for such
certificates will be heard on the
first day of each term of the Distrct
Court for Coconino County, and

ninety days prior to the said first
day of Court.
The first day of the next term of
Court for Coconino County will be
Monday April 10, 1910.

H, B. Morris of Mesa, found a

sippi river.

T he Way of the Transgressor is Lard
The wise housewife specifies Cottolene every time in place
of lard. Anyone with a particle of respect for his stomach
would prefer a pure vegetable product to one made from the
fat of a hog. Cottolene is always pure; lard isn't.
Cottolene will make more palatable food than lard, and food
that any stomach can digest with ease. Lard is a foe to digestion:
You can prove every word we say by trying a pail
of Cottolene. All good grocers sell it; all the great
cooking authorities of America recommend it.
COTTOLENE is Guaranteed ? tJyft SSS
not pirated, after having given Cottolene a fair tcit.
To1r0 Qnlrl in Rullr Cottolene is packed in pails with an air-tight top to
never jom in uuin keep , cl(.ani fre$h and ,v10ome( n prevent it
from catching dust and absorbing disagreeable o'dors, such as fish, oil, etc.
