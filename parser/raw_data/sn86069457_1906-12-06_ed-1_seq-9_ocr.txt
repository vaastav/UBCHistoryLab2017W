Washington Dee The following U
tho full text of President Roosevelts
moesage to tho second session of the
yifty nlnth congress
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives As a nation wo till continue to
njojr a literally unprecedented prosper
Uy and It Is probable UiU only reckless
peculation and disregard of legitimate
business methods on the part of the
business world can materially mar this
prosperity
No congress In our time has done more
ped work of Importance than the pres
ent congress There were several mat
tern left unfinished at your last session
however which I most earnestly hope
yea will complete before your adjourn
ment
I again recommend a law prohibiting
A corporations from contributing to the
aWipalgn expenses of any party Such
kill has already past one house ot con
gress Let Individuals contributo as they
desire but let us prohibit in effective
faMilon all corporations from making
contributions for any political purpose
directly or Indirectly
Another bill which has just past one
hctaee ot the congress and which Is ur
peatlr necessary should be enacted Into
la ir fa that conferring upon the govern
ment the right pf appeal in criminal
eafcea on questions of law This right
ejrJata in many of the states It exists In
the- District of Columbia by act of the
eorigress It Is of course not proposed
tfcfcf In any case a verdict for the de
feMant on the merits should be sat
sMe Recently In one district where
tbVgovernment had Indicted certain per
01 for conspiracy In connection with
relates the court sustained the defend
ants demurrer while In another juris
diction an indictment tor conspiracy to
obtain rebates has been sustained by
thf court convictions obtained under it
and two defendants sentenced to Impris
onment The two cases referred to may
not bo In real conflict with each other
out It Is unfortunate that there should
even be an appurent conflict At
at there Is no way by which the I
krnment can cause such a conflict when
ft occurs to bo solved by an appeal to
a higher court and the wheels of Justice
are blocked without uny real decision ot

hampering the gorernment In Its effort
to obtain Justice especially ngalnst
wealthy Individuals or corporations who
do wrong and may also prevent the
covernment from obtaining Jubtico for
wageworkers who are not themselves
able effectively to contest a case where
the judgment of an inferior court has
been against them 1 have specifically
In view a recent decision by a district
judgo leaving rallwuy employees with
out remedy for violation or a certain so
tailed labor statute It seems an absurd
ity to permit a single district Judge
against what may bo the judgment of
the Immense majority or his colleagues
an the bench to declare a law solemnly
enacted by the congress to be uncon
stitutional and then to deny to the
government the right to have tho su
preme court definitely decide the ques
tion
Crluiluul Prosecutions
ft la well to recollect that the real
efficiency of tho law often depends not
upon tho passage or acts as to which
there is great public excitement but
upon tlio passagu or acts of this nature
as to which there Is not much public
excitement because there Is Ilttlo pub
lic understanding of their Importance
while tho Interested parties are keenly
live to the desirability of defeating
thorn The Importance of enacting Into
law the particular bill In question Is
further Increased by tho fact that the
government has now dellnitely begun a
of resorting to tlio crlminnl law
fiollcy trust and Interstate commerce
cases where Mich a courso offers a roa
eonubio cliance of success At first as
was proper every effort wns made to on
force these laws by civil proceedings
but It has become increasingly evident
that tlio action of the government In
finally deciding In certain cases to un
dertake criminal proceedings was Justi
fiable nnd tho there have been some
onspicuous failures In these cases we
that basis that Is If this discrimination
In favor of this particular shipper was
made with an 18 Instead of u 3 cent
rate and the tariff rate was maintained
as against their competitors tho re
sult might be anil not Improbably would
be that their competitors would be driven
put or business This crime Is one which
In Its nature Is deliberate nnd premedi
tated 1 think over a fortnight elujsed
between the date of Palmers letter re
questing the reduced rate and the answer
of the railroad company deciding to
grant It and then for months ufter
wards this business was carried on and
these claims for rebates submitted month
after month and checks In payment of
them drawn month after month Such
a violation of the law In my opinion In
Its essential nature Is a very much
more heinous act than the ordinary
common vulgar crimes which come be
fore criminal courts constantly for pun
ishment and which arise from sudden
passion or temptation This crime In
this case was committed by men of
education and of large business experi
ence whose business standing In the
community was such that they might
have been expected to set an example
of obedience to law upon the main
tenance of which alone In this country
the security of their property depends
It was committed on behalf of a great
railroad corporation which like other
railroad corporations has received gra
tuitously from the state large and valu
able privileges for the publics conven
ience and Its own which performs quasi
public functions and which Is charged
with the highest obligation in the trans
action of Its buslneaa to treat the citizens
of this country alike and not to carry on
Its business with unjust discriminations
between different e4tlsens or different
classes of citizen This crime In Its
nature Is one usually done with secrecy
and proof of which It Is very difficult
to obtain Tne Interstate commerce act
was passed In VXl nearly 20 years ago
Ever since that time complaints of the
granting of rebates by railroads has been
common urgent Insistent and altho
the congress has repeatedly past legis
lation endeavoring to put a stop to this
evil the difficulties or obtaining proof
upon which to bring prosecution in these
cases is so great that this is tho first
case that has ever been brought in this
court nnd as I am Informed this case
and one recently brought In Philadelphia
are the only cases that have ever been
brought In the eastern part of this coun
try In fact but few cases or this kind
havn ever been brought In this country
oast or west Now under these circum
stances am forced to the conclusion
In n case In which the proof Is so clear
and the facts aro so flagrant It is the
duty of the court to fix a penalty which
shall In some degree be commensurate
with thi gravity of the ofTense As be
tween tlie two defendants In my opinion
the principal penalty should be Imposed
on tlie corporation The tiaflle manager
In this case presumably acted without
any udvnntage to himself and without
any Interest in the transaction either
by the direct authority or in accordance
with what he understood to bo the policy
or the wishes of Ills employer
The sentence of this court In this case
is that the defendant Pomeroy for each
of the six offenses upon which ho has
been convicted be fined the sum of 11000
making six tines amounting In nil to the
sum of JGOOO nnd tho defendant The
New York Central Hudson Hlver Hall
road company for eaeli of Hie six crimes
of which it has been convicted be fined
the sum of lk0o0 making six lines
amounting In tin- aggregate to tho turn
of JlosOOo anil judgment to that effect
will be entered in this case
IwinIoii by Technicalities
In connection with this matter I would
like to call attention to the very unsat
isfactory ftnte or our criminal law re
sulting in largo pait from the liabt ot
netting aside the Judgments of Infoilor
courts on technicalities absolutely un
connected with tlie merits ur the caso
and where tliero Is no attompt to show
that tliero has been uny failuro ot sub-
stantlal Justice I
It wouk
nrovl
act a law providing something to fh
effect that
No Judgment shall bo bet aside or new
trial granted hi any cause civil or crim
inal tin the ground or misdirection or the
Jury or tho improper admission or re
jection of evidence or for erroi us to any
matter of pleading or procedure unless
In tlio opinion or the court to which the
application Is made after nn examina
tion or the entire cjuso It shall utllrma
lively Hppear that tho error complained
01 has resulted In a miscarriage of
Justice
Injunctions
In my last message I suggested tho en
actment ot u law In connection with tlie
Issuance or Injunctions attention hav
ing been sharply drawn to tho matter
by the demand that tho right or apply
ing Injunctions In labor cases should bu
wholly abolished It Is at least doubtrul
whether a law abolishing altogether tho
use of Injunctions In such cases would
stand the test of the cnsirls In which
case of couise the legislation would be
Ineffective Moreover I believe It would
be wrong altogether to prohibit the use
of Injunctions It Is criminal to permit
sympathy with criminals to weaken our
hands In upholding tho law and If men
seak to destroy life or property by mob
have had many successes which have with oxtenio care and
evil doers whether the penalty Inflicted
was In the shape of flno or Imprison
mentand penalties of both kinds have
already been Inflicted by the courts Of
course where the Judge can see his
way to Inflict the penalty of Imprison
sent the deterrent effect of the punish
ment on other offender Is Increased
but sufficiently heavy fines accomplish
sauch Judge Holt of the New York
district court In a recent decision admir
ably stated the need for treating with
Jnit severity offenders of this kind Ills
pinion runs In part as follows
The governments evidence to estab
lish the defendants guilt was clear
encluslve and undisputed The case was
a flagrant one The transactions which
took place under this Illegal contract
Vera very large the amounts of rebates
returned were considerable and the
amount of the rebate Itself was large
amounting to more than une flfth of the
entire tariff charge for the transporta
tion of merchandise from this city to
Detroit It Is not too much to say In
soy opinion that If this business waa
earrled on for aconildRrable time
Jnary Injunction In a labor case If
granted without adequate proof even
jwhen authority ran b found to support
the conclusions of law on which It Is
founded muy often settle the dispute
between tho parties and therefore If
ansnmo a matter-of-fact courso granting
of a preliminary Injunction to bo the
ordinary and proper Judicial disposition
of such cases and tliero have undoubt
edly been flagrant wrongs committed
by Judges In connection witli labor dis
putes oven within tho last few yoars
altho I think much less often than In
formor years Huch judges by their un
wise action Immensely strengthen the
hands of those who aro striving entirely
to do away with the power of Injunction
and therefore such careless use of the
Injunctive process tends to threaten Its
very existence for If the American peo
ple ever become convinced that this
process Is hubltually abused whothcr In
matters affecting labor or In matters af
fecting corporations it will bo well nigh
Impossible to prevent Its abolition
Criticism of the Jiidlclnry
It may bo the highest duty of a Judge
at any given moment to disregard hot
merely tho wishes of Individuals or
great political or financial power hut
the overwhelming tide of public senti
ment and the Judge who does thus ills
regai d public sentiment when It Is wrotpr
nnu untunes asmc ttio plea or any spe
cial Interest when the pleading Is not
rounded on righteousness performs the
highest service to tho country Such a
Judge Is deserving of all honor nnd all
1 honor cannot be paid to tills wise nnd I
fearless Judge If we permit the growth
nn absurd convention width would
forbid any criticism or the Jude of an
other type who shows himself timid In
the presence or urrognnt disorder or
who on Insufficient grounds grants nn In
Junction that does giuve Injustice or
who In his capacity ns a eonslruer and
therefore In part n maker or the law
In flagrant fashion IhwnrtM the cause of
decent government Tho Judge has u
power over which no review can be exer
cised he himself sits In review upon the
acts of both the executive and legisla
tive branches or the government save
in the most extraordinary ensos ho Is
amenable only at the liar or public opin
ion nnd It Is unwUe to maintain that
public opinion in rererence to a man
with such power shall neither be exprest
nor led
The best Judges have ever been
jnost to disclaim uny Immunity rrom
xrltlclsm This has been true since the
dnys or tlio great English Lord Chancel
lor Parker who said Let all pcoplo
be at liberty to know what I found my
Judgment upon that so when I have
given it In unv cause others may be at
liberty to Judge or mo The proprieties
or the case were set forth with singular
clearness and good temper by Judge W

u I V
Sound lodgment nf the People
There Is 0110 consideration which should
be taken Into account by the good people
who carry 11 sound proposition to un ex
cess In objecting to nny criticism of a
Judges decision The Instinct of the
American people as a whole Is sound In
this matter They will not subscribe to
the doctrine that any public servant Is
to be above criticism If the best citi
zens those most competent to express
their Judgment In such matters nnd
above all those belonging to the great
and honorable profession of the bar
so profoundly Influential In Amercnn
life tnke the position that there shall bo
no criticism of n jvdge under any cir
cumstances their view will not bo ac
cepted by the American pcoplo as a

turn to and tend to uccept as Justifiable
tho Intemperate and Imnmner criticism
d lo well toenl ered by unworthy agitators Surely
l ls B misfortune to leave to such
cs a tunction rignt in itseir which they
are certain to nbuse Just and temperate
criticism when necessary Is a safeguard
against the acceptance by the people
as a whole ot that Intemperate antag
onism towards he Judiciary which must
bo combated by every right thinking
man and which if it become widespread
among tho people at large would consti
tute a dire menace to the republic
THE MOCUO PHOUIXM
President Sny Mob Lsn In u Menace
to the Country
In connection with the delays of the

epidemic of lynching and mob violence
that springs upf now In one part of our
country how In another Kach section

faults no section can with wisdom spend
Its time Jeering at the faults ot another

science and to supplement this by

Such criticism Is beneficial In proportion
as It Is fair dispassionate discriminating
and based on a knowledge or sound legnl
principles The comments made by
learned text writers and by the acute
editors or the various law reviews upon
Judicial decisions are therefore highly
useful Such critics constitute morn or
loss Impartial tribunals of professional
opinion before which each Judgment Is
made to stand or fall on Its merits arm

for If the law Is but
common sense tho nrn
test or many average men may evidence
ueieci in a judicial conclusion tho
based on the nicest legal reasoning nnd
profoundest learning The two Important
elements or moral character in a Judge
are an earnest desire to reach a Just
conclusion nnd courage to enforce It In
sorar as rear or public comment decs not
affect tlie courage or a Judge but only
spurs him on to search his consicence
and to reach the result which approves
itseir to his Inmost heart such comment
serves a useful purpose There are row
men whether they are Judges ror lire
or ror a shorter term who do not prefer
earn and hold the respect of all and who
cannot be reached and made to pause
nnd deliberate bv hostile nubile rrltlrUm
In the caso or Judges having a life tenure 1 Americans

It is tlie only practical nnd available In
struiuenl In the hands or a fret people
to keep such Judges nllvo to the reason

On the other hand the Linger of de
stroying tho proper Influence or Judicial
decisions by creating unrounded preju
dices against the courts Justifies and re
quires that unjust attacks shall lie met
and ansnered Courts must ultimately
rest their defense upon the Inherent
strength or the opinions they deliver as
tno ground ror their conclusions nnd
must trust to the calm and deliberate
Judgment or all tho people as their best
vindication
should renlltA
that the worst enemy or his race Is the
negro criminal nnd nbove nil the ne

as In the highest degree an olTenso
against the whole country and against
the colored rnce In particular ror a
colored man to rail to help the nlflcerH
of the law In hunting down with all
posslhle earnestness and zeal every
such Infamous offender Moreover In
my Judgment the crime of rape should
always be punished with death as Is
the case with murder assault with In
tent to commit rape should be made a
capital crime at least In the discretion
of His court and provision should be
made by which the punishment may
follow Immediately upon the heela of
the ofTense while the trial should be
so conducted that the victim need not
be wantonly shamed while giving tes
timony and that the least possible
publicity shall be given to the details
The members of the white race on
the other hand should understand that
every lynching represents by Just so
much a loosening of the bands of civ
ilization that tho spirit of lynching
Inevitably throws Into prominence In
tho community alt the foul and evil
creatures who dwell therein No man
can take part In the torture of a hu
man being without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered
Every lynching means Just so much
morn deterioration In all the children
who have any knowledge of It and

Xi ed for jYegro ICduentlou
There Is another rnntter which has
u direct bearing upon this matter or
lynching nnd or the brutal crime which
sometimes calls it rorth and at other
times merely furnishes the excuse for
Its existence It Is out of tlio question
for our people as a whole permanently
to rise b trending down any of their
own number Kven those who tliem
bclves for the moment profit such
maltreatment of their fellows will In j

class to prevent the education of an

good elementary education lies at tin
foundation of our whole political situ
ation In every community the poor
est citizens those who need the schnolM
most would be deprived of them if
they only received school facilities
proportionately to the taes they paid
This Is as true or one portion or our
country as of another It is as true
ror the negro as for the whlto man
The white man If ho Is wise will de
cline to allow the negroes In a mass to
grow to manhood and womanhood
without education Unquestionably ed
ucation such ns Is obtained In our pub
lic schools does not do everything to
wards making a man a good citizen
but it does much The lowest and most
brutal criminals those for instance
who commit the crime of rape uro In
the great majority men who have had
either no education or very litle Just
ns they are almost Invariably men who
own no pioperty for the man who
puts money by out of his earnings
like the man who acquires education
Is usually lifted above more brutal
criminality Of courso tho best typo
of education for the colored man ta
ken as a whole Is such education as
Is conferred In schools like Hampton
tnd Tuskegoo where the boys and
girls the young men nnd young wo
men aro trained Industrially us well

Itnllroad Kniloer Hour
I call your attention to the need of
passing the bill limiting th number
of hours of employment of railroad
employees The inensure Is a very
moderate ono nnd I can conceive of no
serious objection to It Indeed so far
as It Is In our power It should bo our
aim stendlly to reduce the number or
hours of labor with as a goal the
general Introduction of an eight hour
day There are Industries In which
it is not possible that the hours ot
labor should be reduced Just ns there
are communities not far enough ad
vanced ror such a movement to bo for
their good or If In tlie tropics ho sit
uated thut here Is nn analogy between
their needs nnd ours in this matter
On tho isthmus of Panama for In
stance the conditions are in overy way
so different from what they nro hero
that nn eight hour day would be ab
surd Just as It Is absurd so far ns tho
Isthmus Ih concerned where white la
bor cannot bo employed to bother as
to whether the necessary work Ih done
by alien black men or by alln yellow
men Hut the wageworkers of the
Inlted States nre of so high a grade
that alike from the merely Industrial
standpoint and from the civic stand
point It should be our oblect to do
whnt we enn In the direction of Hear
ing tlio gcnornl observance of un eight

hour law on our federal statute books
has been very scantily observed Now
however largely thru tho Instrumen
tality of the bureau of labor It Is be
ing rigidly enforced and I shall speed
ily be able to say whether or not
thero Is need of further legislation In
reference thereto for our purpose Is to
see It obeyed In spirit no less than In
letter Half holtduyH during summer
should be established for government
employees It Is as desirable for wage
workers who toll with their hands ns

Labor ot VVonten and Children
The congress at its last session wise
ly provided for a truant court for the
District of Columbia a marked step In
advance on the path of properly caring
for the children Let me again urge
that tho congress provide for a thoro
Investigation ot the conditions of child
labor and of the labor of women In
the United States More and moro our
are growlnir to recognize the
act that the questions which are not
merely ot lausmai out or social Im
portance outweigh all others and
these two queatlons most emphatically

Hmplojrra Liability
Among the excellent laws which tbe
congress past at tho last session was
R employers liability law It was a
marked step In advance to get the rec
ognition of employers liability on the
statute books hut the law did not go
far enough In spite of nil precau
tions exercised by employers there are
unavoidable accidents nnd even deaths
Involved In neurly every line or busi
ness connected with the mechanic arts
ThlH Inevitable sacrifice or lire may bo
reduced to a minimum but It cannot
bo completely eliminated It Is a great
social Injustice to compel the employee
or rather tho family of the killed or
disabled victim to bear tlie entire bur

words society shirks Is duty b laying
the whole cost on the victim win reaa

dustry If the entire trade risk la
placed upon the employer he will
promptlv and properly add It to the
legitimate cost of production and as
sess it proportionately upon the con

should plii e this entire risk of a
