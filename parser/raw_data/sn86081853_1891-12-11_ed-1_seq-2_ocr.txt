Speaker Crisp.
If there is any signficance in the
selection by the Democratic caucus
of Crisp for Speaker, it is all With
the anti Cleveland contingent. The
contest began between the candi
dates as men alone, but of late there
bae been a political flavor thrown
around it. While it is true that
some who ere opposed to Cleveland
have supported Mills and others
who have been friendly to Cleve'and
have supported Crisp, still the lines
have been fairly well drawn. Sen
ator Gorman has ased all his in
fluence for Crisp. So has Governor-
Senator Hill. On the other harid, j
the radical free tiade organs and!
Cleveland's warmest friends have j
given in their adherence to Mills. I
until to a considerable extent the j
contest has narrowed down to one |
between Cleveland and some other
candidate—Hill, for instance—and
the victory is thus with the anti-j
Cleveland following.
There will be explanations and ex- 1
cuses and all th»f, and the Cleve
land people will contend that there
is no significance politically in the
result, but nevertheless the follow
ers of David B. Hill will claim the
Victory as theirs and will proceed to
relegate Cleveland to the fear as a
Presidential candidate. It has been
a famous fight, and now that it is
ended the House will be able to or
ganize today and the President's
Message will be read probably this
week. The new Speaker will be!
given all the time'he needs to make j
up his committees, and thus having
been done the work of the session
will begin.
It will be interesting to fo'low the
proceedings. The House lias thus
far taken the advice of Governor
Hill. It is his victory If it is any
body's ontsidV of Crisp's. He has
already laid down a plan of action
for Congress to follow. This is to
pass bills repealing the McKinley
and the Silver acts, and to stop
there without any attempt at new
legislation on these points. If Hill
has his way ami his advice is fol
lowed he will become a controlling
factor in Washington, and will be
able to hold a strong hand in the
Presidential game to be play
ed at the Democratic National Con
vention. The play for position has
begun and Hill wins bhe preliminary
skirmish.—JFas.
Blslne'* True Condition.
Dr. J. Malison Taylor gives ft
a good account of James (i. Blaine.
The physician's lecture of physicial
training last night at the Franklin
Institute presented an opportunity
lor inquiries about that much-talked
of visit, when it was stated that the
Secretary came 1o this city on pur
pose to consult his physician.
Because Dr. Taylor when asked
about his interview with his late
patient spoke, favorably of his health,
it was inferred that Mr. Blaine had
been undergoing i medical inspect
ion at the Stratford, and that he
was anxious about his own condi
tion and came here on purpose to
have a talk with his pdysician. Dr.
Taylor, who ought to know, sa> s
he diJn't, and that he is free from
any organic affection and, in short,
as w. II as ever he was in his life.
*'ile didn'tcjuie lure to consult
the Uyolur.aud ho added :
"If he WAS out of health I should be
careful al>out answering vour qtiee
tions. As lie ia not I can afford to
speak plainly."
It appears, 'therefore, that in thoBC
who wish to retire Mr. fclaine from ,
actiVte life ard l»eHeve that he is not
in a to Wippor' ttoe fatigues
of a campaign thfe wish is father to
the thought Philadelphia, Inquirer,

Another Dynamite Cnink In New
York.
j The name of the latest dvnainite
crank is "Holy Smoke." That is
what he calls himself and be claims
jto be just ready to start out on a
'career similar to that of his fellow
i crank who attacked Russell Sage,
hut a couple of determined men'
armed with clubs dragged him out
jof bed at 'i o'clock Monday morning
and brought him up with a sharp
iturn.
j The r eal name of the crank is
; Oscar Wevrouch and he was arrested
'upon the complaint'of Conrad Har
ris, the retired wins merchant of N.
I Y.. who charged him with threaten
jing bis life. Wyrouch's name, trans
lated' from German into English,
I means incense, and hence he calls
himself "Holy Smoke." Saturday
>ifternoon he wrote a letter to Harris,
in which he stated that be is living
on account of the good he does hu
manity, but would not do it any
further. He, therefore, wished Mr.
Harris to give him SSOO with which
to buy a stationery store. The let
ter ended with a threat that if he
did not take notice of the request
Harris would"be the next man to
"Russel Sage, and I will blow your
bruins in the air without 1 hurt any
body else." He gave as his address
134 Sussex street* Jersey City, and
stated that fte expected an answer
by noon to-day.
HAD EVERYTHING? ALL RIGHT.
Harris went in great alarm to
Police Captain Carpenter, and the
latter declared he would not goto
bed until he ran down Mr. Holy
Smoke. He was arrested at a sa
loon in New York city, in whicu he
was drinking. When searched at
the police station he had a photo
graph of himself in his pocket, on
which was writteu "the greatest
chess player in America There
was also a document written in a
big, hand, which read :
My will t.» grave digger*. First—
i'letae do uoi iMflflie Ute tough before

Tire Chicago papers are accusing
the New York papers of hurting the
prospects of the World's Fair in
Europe. The Chicago papers should
understand by this that some—not
all—of the New York papers would
rather see any American enterprise
ruined than see' it succeed outside
of New York.

OUR MOTTO!
9 S 9
What does it mean ?
Square Dealing.
With less it would be folly to
be content, 112 r more than ihat it
is unreas nalile for you to ask.
Look out for lhe maD that says he
will give .y u m mpth'ng for
nothing, he will do no such tiling.
VV e i'on'l do anything of the kind,
we dOD't even pre end to, we will
give you MSrgood an you can get
elsewhere for your mi r.ey and
bt lti r tha>> you can get in most
pl.ict «. Well ve no use for silly,
meaningless aiguments. It is as
much to your interest to deal with
us as it is to curs.
New goods are constantly ar
riving and you will be petteed
with the style and finish of the
goods as well as the price we have
I put on them. Come in and see
them.
Respectfully yours,
J. V. RETTLNBURY.
