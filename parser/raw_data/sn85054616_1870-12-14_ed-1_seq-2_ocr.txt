The "Vounc Democracy" of Now York,

It is the general impression of Congress
men that the resumption of specie pay
ments is feasible within a year. Thus, the
results of the rebellion, one after another
are disappearing. With an honest collec
tion ftf the revenues, and their proper dis
bursement, the last vestige of our late na
tional "unpleasantness" the national debt
will also be wiped out in & comparatively
few year. This will Lc the crowning good
woik of the Republican parte.
The Washington Patriot, Democratic,
makes a pitiful appeal to all IVmocratic
Congressmen to reduce the army at the

that troops had been etrttioned in various

ocrats dismiss their rough-and-ready fraud- i
ulent repeaters, and permit honest men to
vote without molestation, and there will be
no need to station soldiers convenient to the

The President's Message.
We priut od the outside of to-day's pa
per, the second annua! message of Presi
dent Grant, and ask for h a careful perusal
by our readers. It is a plain, sensible, business-like
document, devoid of ail political
sophistry and chicanery; discussing the
subjects of present interest and future im
portance to the American people, in a cool
and deliberate, but in a Gnu and felicitous
manner.
The President makes a generous response
to the sparks of Republicanism that have
enkindled in France, calls attention to the
wrongs committed on American citizens by
the Spanish authorities in Cuba, argues
warmly for the purchase of San Domingo,
suggests a commission for the settlement of
the Alabama claims, enters a protest against
the seizure of American fishing vessels by
the Canadian authorities ; and in conclusion
urges a thorough enforcement of all laws, a
faithful collection of taxes, economy in all
departments of the government, prompt
payment of all national obligations, a re
duction of taxes and the tariff for tho good
cf fbc greatest number, fair dealing with
all naliou?, reform in Ir.',:an affairs and the
civil service, and the freedom of the e'.cc'ivc
franchise to all citizens irrespective of na
tivity, faith or color.
To show the spirit in which the message is
received by the papers throughout the
country, we append the following extracts :
The Pittsburch Dispatch says : "The
message must commend itselt very lavora-!
.!,. , ,l-.;L.;.r ,,-.-,,n,f nil n,-ti.. .is a !
calm, high-toned, dignified document, show- j
inir a statesmanlike grasp of the questions
atiecttng the prosperity of the country, and
a disposition on tho part of the President
to do all in bis power to promote the well
being of the entire people. A more dispas
sionate or comprehensive document has not
been submitted to Coneress for many years.
Better suggestions for the future prosperity
of the country could hardly have been made.
If the same spirit shall pervade Congress
as palpably controls the i 'resident, we shall
have, between this ai d March next, the
most popular session of Congress ever
held."
The New York Times says : "The mes
sage transmitted yesterday by the President
to Coneress is the best answer to those who
insist that the mission of the Republican
party is ended, or who impugn General
Grant's fitness for intcrpretimr the wishes
and promoting the inter.'ts of toe people.
The policy set forth is at oru-e positive and
practical"
The Nkw Paktv. The Rochester Demo
crat says of the "new party" agitation:
"The movement stands confessed by its
originators as nothing more nor less than
an invitation to a largo section of tho Re
publican party to commit suicide." The
same paper continues upon the subject of
revenue reform: "The Republican party
i by its past actions and its promises f r the
the future, the exponent a::d champion of!
genuine revenue reform. It has done all
that has been done in that direction. All
the great measures for reducing taxes, passed
by the last Congress, were opposed by the
Democra ic members. Not a Democrat in
the House of Representatives voted for the
bill passed last July reducing the taxes
$80,000,000. Not a Democrat voted for
the lunding bill, which is designed to save
$25,000,000 yearly on the interest of the
public debt. So as to the other measures
intended to reduce taxes. Let Republican
' revenue reformers' bs warned. They may
rest assured that if they aid the Democracy
in getting control of the Houc, that con
trol will be used not only to 'block every
scheme of the Protectionists,' as the World
says, but to blof k every measure of the Re
publicans, revenue refomi included."
SiNC-fiAPi.T Mystkmous. The Dead
Letter Oifiec is one of the most curiously
interesting branches of the government, and
the cause of it, or the necessity for such an
institution, is a mystery. It 's impossible
almost to conceive of the careles.-ness, stu
pidity and ignorance by which tnoro than
fourteen millions of Utters weio entrusted
to the post o!tice in a single year, for which
no destination could be found, in conse
quence of inaccuracies, imperfections and
fatal omissions in direction and upward of
S.000 have no address whatever. And the
mystery is the more rcmaikable when :i is
consilerc-d that these letters contained
money to the amount of at least $100,000,
in small sums generally, and in checks,
di-afto, etc., to the ctuottnt of $3,000,000
more. The property was of course returncl,
or ui"it of it, upon information obtained by
opening and examining the letters at the
dead letter office.
State Finances. It appears from a
statement of the Commissioners of the
Sinking Fund that there was in the Trea
sury, on the 30: h November, $1,230,995 82,
of which $254, 10S 30 was applicable to the
payment of overdue loans, relief notes and

Wonders Never Cease. It is stated
that the Democratic party in Kentucky is
about to divide and form two sections the
one liberal, recognizing the results of the
war and conforming to them, to be headed
by John C. Breckenridge and a few old
time leaders ; the other section strictly
Bourbonish, headed by modern Democratic
mountebanks refusing to recognize results,
and continuing, like Don Quixotte, to fight
I windmills and other imaginary obstructions
in their path to huipire. We can scarcely
credit the announcement that Breckenridge
belongs to and is leader of the liberate but
if it is so. it is certainly the njost astonish
ing thing that has occurred recently outside
of the Mormon Church and Spiritualistic
circle.

The Postraaxter General's Report.
The Postmaster General's report is con
cise and clear in statement. Interesting in
its statistics, and contains recomnieudations
which commend themselves to alb
He 6hows that the affairs of his depart
ment are in a hea!thy,and,in fact, a steadily
improving condition. Th revenues for the
fiscal year ended June 30, were $19,77-.-220
fi5, and the expenditures of all kinds
S23.99S.P37 03, leaving a deficiency of only
4,220.016 98 as against a deficiency of
$5,354,620 78 for tho fiscal year 1369. The
incrrase of revenue for tfie rear 1370 over
the year 1809 was $1,427,703 03 or 7.78 per
cent., and the increase of expenditures
$300,700 13, r.r 1.32 per cent., shoring a
net increase in revenue of $1,127,003 SO.
The incrceac in revenue for the year 1870
over the year 1SGS was $1,2CS,241 9S, or
5 57 per cent. The increase in revenue for
1S70, as compared with 1S69. was less than
the increase for 1S09, as compared with
1SCS, by $021,199 90; and he increase in
expenditures for 1870, compared with 1SG9,
was less than the increase for 1369, com
pared with 1808, by $000,832 72. The
increa'e in tho issue of stamps, stamped
envelopes and wrappers in thj fiscal year
1870 CT?r 1S09 was $1,395,068 50, ami the
value of stamps and stamped envelopes lost,
in the mails was $91 S 30, which is much
less than the amount of similar losses in
1309. .

'"crease the pay of railroad companies for
carrying the mails, and supports the rccom
mcndation by sound reasons. A contract
between a government and its citizens is or
should be free a transaction as a contract
between private individuals, and the fact
that many of the railroad companies find the
pay so inadequate that they have no desire
to tak the contracts for carrying the mails
results in an inefficient performance of the
work, which undoubtedly occasions a far
greater loss to the Department than can be
offset by the trifling saving of expenses thus
effected, besides subjecting citizens to great
inconveniences and annoyances through
irregularities and delays in the delivery of
the mails.
He favors legislation to encourage tho re
cstab!ihmcnt of American lines of trans
Atlantic steamships for the transportation
of the U. S. mails to Eitrnpe.
On the subject of the flanking privilege,
the Postmaster General does not seem to
have changed his mind. Ho still favors its
abolition, and expresses the opinion that if
it were repealed the department would soon
become self-sustaining, and in time prove a
source of revenue instead of a yearly burden
to the government.
Ho recommends the adoption of tho sys"
tern of "correspondence," or "postal
cards," which is in use us in Great Britain
and North Germany. These cards, de
signed to be used for short, open mes
sages by mail, are ruled on one side for the
address, on the other for the communica
tion, and are stamped. In Great Britain
their price is a half penny each, which in
cludes the cost of transportation and de
livery by the post office. If they could be
afforded at as cheap a rate in this country
the system might become popular, as it
would undoubtedly be, in a great many
cases, both convenient and useful.
The postal money order system has proved
a success. The number of money order of
fices has nearly doubled since the last fiscal
year ; and over thirty four million dollars
were, under this system, safely and promptly
transmitted during the present year. The
fees received for the issue of these orders
amounted to nearly a quarter million dol
lars, which w is an excess of ninety odd
thousand dollars over the e.-peiie of carry
ing on the system, so that while the money
order branch of the service is a very great
convenience to the community at large, it
is tlso a positive source of revenue to tb?
department. There are a number of other
interesting tacts stated and suggestions made
by the Postmaster General in connection with
ibis system .
The postage between Great Britain, the
Netherlands, Italy. Belgium, Switzerland
and and the North German Union lias been
reduced lrom twelve to six cents; which is
especially important in the case of Great
Britain and North Germany, between which
countries ai;d the Uuncd States a very large
amount of correspondence takes place. Di
rect postal intercourse with Fiance 1 as been
suspended since January 1. 1S70, inconse
quence of tho abrogation of the postal con
vention with that country. This, it is
hoped, will be remedied by the government
of France when peace shall be restored to
that country.
The document contains many other points
of minor importance, but we omit noticing
j them for want of space. Suffiec it to say
j that the report is a most excellent one
throughout, and we have no doubt the sug
gestions it contains will be generally ap
proved by Congress and the people.
Declines to Contest. Hon. I). J.
Morrell declines to co: test the election of
Mr. Speer in the Seventeenth Congres
sional District, lie says :
" Justice to myself requires it. By hunt
ing up the scattered fraudulent votes, over
one hundred of which have been reported
to me, I could doubtless make a successful
contest, but being fully satisfied that my
defeat indeed anything short of 1,000 ma
jority in the district is due to the base
treachery and debauchery of professed Re
publicans, I should spurn to hold the seat
at the cost of gathcring up the petty frauds
of ur opponents. You are aware how
much I have wished to get out of public
life, and how much my own interests, and
the interests of the Cambria Company, de
mand it, and cannot blame me for accepting
the present opportunity of doing so."
Mr. Armstrong, in the Lycoming district,
also declines to contest his seat, for nearly
similar reasons to those given by Mr. Mor

of both these gentlemen.

Toe War News. The Prussians have
taken Orleans.- Tin? defeat of the French
army at Orleans was more severe than was
anticipated, if the latest reports are reliable.
Ten thousand French prisoners are reported
captured, and the French army quite demo
ralized. The Prussians evidently gained
much the greatest success in the late battles.
A few more such, and it will not be possible
for the French to continue their defense.
The speedy suppression of all arm id resist
ance to the Prussians seems entirely pro
bable. The French army of the Loire is
reported retreating South. A forward move
ment of the Germans toward Havre is said
to be in progress. "Reports are current that
Paris cannot hold out much longer. The
secretary of Minister Wasbburne, it is said,
predicts the surrender of the city in three
weeks. Prince George of Saxony also tele
graphs to the king, at Dresden, that further
offensive movements on the part of the
French arc impossible. He is, however,
too confident. It is hardlv probable that
Trochu will capitulate without making an-
other desperate effort to cut through the
German investing line. That he will fail,
we have no doubt ; but that he will order
four hundred thousand men to lay down
their arms without one last struggle for
victory, is scarcely to be believed.
Cuba. If tbe report that Cuba has

expense and trouble of the war. It has

This drain cannot re endured much longer.

to find her way out of the difficulty as soon
as possible. Still the Cubans will not gain
