Milton Rawllngs fired tho fatal shotB.
Mrs. Rawllngs and hor two daugh?
ters visited the Husband nnd father
during the morning. They remalnod
in the jail but did not witness the
execution.
Story of the Crime.
The crime and conviction of Raw
Hr.gs and Moore presented unusual
features. .1. G. Rawllngs and W.
Carter were neighbors, twelve miles
from here. Roth were Baptist min?
isters. Several years ago, a dispute
arose as to the line between their
respective farms. Uttgatl?n and
had blood resulted. Carter wns
wcunded by a shot from ambush,
and had Rawllngs arrested on tho
charge of attempting murder. A
fev days later, on June 13, 1905
a night attack was made on the
Carter home. Two of the children,
Willie and Cnrrle Carter were shot
just outside the house and sh its
were fired without effect nt Carter,
ami his wife ami another daughter.
The wounded boy managed to drag
himself to the house nnd Inform
his parents that Milton and Jesse
Rawllngs had shot him. He died
th< next day. After shooting the
children the attacking party attempt:
ed to set fire to the house but were
flred upon and driven off without
further cnusutlcs. A coroner's jury
found that the crime hnd been com?
mitted by Milton nnd Jessie Rawl?
lngs and Alf Moore, a negro. The
latier confessed, telling of a plot
which had been planned 'by tho
elder Rawllngs for the murder of
the entire Carter family and the
burning of their home.
J. G. Rawllngs took no Immediate
part In the crime, having gone to
Valdosta to divert suspicion. The
trial which lasted two weeks resulted
In a verdict of death for the elder
Rawllngs. his sons Milton and .lesslo
and Alf Moore. A third son Leonard
Rawllngs, was given n life sentence
its an accomplice. Now began a
fight for life.
Every legal expedient was resort?.l
to, causing the day of execution to
be postponed from time to time as
?aeh successive temporary advan?
tage was gained by the defense. Tne
verdict In the case went to tho
highest state court, then the United
Stales supreme court then both to the
state supreme, court, on extraordi?
nary motion, add then to the board
of pardons. The first verdict was
sustained in each instance. Governor
Terrell refused on Monday to Inter?
fere with the execution of the death
sentence today, and this refusal de?
frayed the last hope of escaping
tho full penalty of tho law. The
nases of two Rawllngs boys, who are
sentence to be hanged Friday will
Come before the board of pardons
on Thursday.
