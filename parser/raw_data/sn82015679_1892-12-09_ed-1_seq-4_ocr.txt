It is entirely eafe to predict that no
message of Mr. Cleveland's tvill ever be
attacked or criticised by tbo British
press. .
When tbo monument commissioners
get through marring it they should label
it "A monument to everything in gen
eral and nothing in particular."
The free-trade papers in this country
and all the Democratic organs do not
like the President's message any better
than the British newspapers. They are
all of a kind. .
Tnz road congress has been a good
advertisement for Indiana, but a gen
eral system of good 'roads would be a
far better one. That would give the
State a genuino boom at homo and
abroad.
It is gratifying to Republicans to note
the fact that while Democratic papers
criticise President Harrison's message,
none of them eay that it is common
place, while several that aro capablo
of judging declare it is able.
TnE New York Post sneers at Postmaster-general
Wanamaker's business
fiy referring to his "bargain-counter."
Sneering at men engaged in trade may
be the correct thing for the Anglo
maniac, but it is bad form in this conn
try '
TnE official returns of the recent elec
tion in New York show that Mr. Cleve
land lacked considerable of getting a
majority of the votes cast. The total
vote was 1,858,413, of which Cleveland
received 654,500, Harrison C09.197, ' Bid
well (Pro.) 86,029, Weaver 17,674, while
the Socialists cast 16,433 votes, and there
were 23,703 scattering and blank. Mr.
Cleveland lacked 24,707 of a majority.
"It will be impossible to got a dollar
for new public buildings,'' Mr. Bynum
is reported as declaring in Washington.
He is doubtless correct in his judgment,
but why should ho make the announce
ment when he has a bill on the calendar
making an appropriation for a much
needed publio building in Indianapolis
a building whose construction is de
manded, not only by the convenience of
a largo city, but by practical economy?
Some commotion has been caused in
whisky circles by the announcement
that the trust has advanced the price
from $1.15 to $1.20 rer gallon. The ad
vance took effect on Wednesday, It
was at first supposed that it was a spec
ulation made in expectation of Congress
increasing the tax, but there is better
reason to believo it wus tho result of a
shrewd move on the part of the trust to
raise tho price of its product. It first
bought up nearly all the Kentucky
whisky in the market, which is pro
duced by distillers not in the trust, and,
having thus got a corner on tho market,
it advanced the price.
The indications are that pork will bo
higher this winter than it has been for
some years past. Hogs are scarce and
there is no reserve supply to be thrown
on the market, as there is of wheat and
corn. The low prico of hogs for tho
past two or three years seems to have
induced farmers to neglect them, henco
the present scarcity. Tho farmers have
erred in not raising enough hogs, just
as they have erred in raising too much
wheat. Hogs aro nearly twice as high
now as they were a year ago this time,
and average considerably lighter. Their
scarcity will make the packing business
light this season, and pork will bo high.
Governor McKinley docs not pro
pose to retire from politics, at least not
just yet. To a friend who asked him if
he would be a candidate for rehoniina
tion next year he replied that so far as
his own desires are concerned he would
prefer not to be, "but," he added, 'tho
present conditions force tho tariff as the
issue between the parties next year. If
the Republicans of Ohio como to think
that this should indicate my candidacy
for a second term I will not refuso to
lead them. Should a majority of my
party desire my renomination I would
accept, and would make tho most earn
est campaign of my life." William Mc
Kinley, jr., is a manly man ind has tho
courage of his convictions.
"The Lost Surplus" is the headline
which tho Louisville Courier-Journal
puts over the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury. "Tho lost surplus,"
which was accumulated for a political
purpose during the Cleveland adminis
tration and deposited in favored banks
without interest, has been applied to
reducing the public debt and interest.
The man who calls that losing money is
an idiot. President Harrison jut the
case well in his message when he said:
'If there are any who still think that
tho surplus should have been kept out
of circulation by hoarding it in the
treasury or deposited in favored banks
without interest, while tb&government
continued to pay to these very banks
interest upon the bonds deposited as se
curity for the deposits, I am content to
leave the argument where it now rests."
QOVEEHMEKT FIHAKCE3.
Whatever the political complexion of
the administration may be, every patri
otic American, be he Republican or
Democrat, must wish to see the govern
ment finances ably and successfully
managed. The credit of the govern
ment is something in which all are in
terested, and no ono can wish to see it
impaired by a failure to meet its obli
gations or to discharge its full duty to
the people. No one wants to see the
government cramped for means to meet
its legitimate expenses, and still less
does any ono wish to seo a deficit.
While a failure to secure the necessary
revenue or to meet the obligations of
the government might injure the party
in power it would also injure the credit
and prestige of tho government, and no
good citizen desires to see that happen.
In short, the management of govern
ment finances and the discussion of
Questions relating thereto should be
conducted on strict business principles
and without reference to partisan poli
tics. The incoming administration will find
the government finances in good condi
tion. True, there will be no largo sur
plus in the treasury, but a cash balance
of $20,902,000, exclusive of the reserve
fund of $100,000,000, which, it is esti
mated, will exist on the 80th of June,
1803, is a very healthy one, and if tho
present prosperous conditions continue
the available surplus at the close of the
fiscal year is much more likely to exceed
than to fall short of this amount. This
supposes that business will not be ma
terially interfered with or the present
revenue of tho government lessened by
new legislation.
Tho necessary expenditures of the
government will bo greater during the
present fiscal year than they were dur
ing last, and it will be necessary to pro
vide for more revenue. During the last
fiscal year the revenues from all sources
were $425,603,200.22, and tho expendi
tures for all purposes were $415,053,800.56.
It is estimated that the revenues for the
present fiscal year, ending Juno SO, 1893,
will bo $403,336,350.14 and the expendi
tures $401,336,350.14. These estimates
are based on a continuance of the exist
ing order of things, as obviously it
would be only wild conjecture to adopt
any other basis of estimate. It is the
business of a financier to deal with con
ditions and not with theories. The Sec
retary of tho Treasury presents the es
timated receipts and expenditures for
the present fiscal year in a few large
items, as follows:
Receipts from customs $108,000,000.00
From internal revenue 1U5,000,000.00
From miscellaneous sources.... 20,000,000.00
From postal service 80.330,350.44
Total estimated revenues $463,333,350.44
The expenditures for the same period are
estimated as follows:
For the civil establishment 9103,000,000.00
For the military ectablishment.. 40,000,000.00
For tho naval establishment.... 31,000.000.00
For the Indian service. 9,000,000.00
For penaions 153.000.000.00
For interest on the rublic debt,. 26000,000.00
For postal service bO.336,350.44
Total estimated expenditures.$4Gl, 336,350.44
The postal service will be nearly self
supporting this year, and, if all goes
well, will be entirely so next year. The
estimated receipts from this source for
the next fiscal year aro $85,121,305,
which, it is estimated, will exceed the
expenditures by nearly $1,000,000. It
will be observed that much the largest
single source of revenue is customs, or
tariff, duties. No material reduction
can be made in this without providing
for an increase from internal revenue,
which would probably mean an increase
in the tax on whisky. Tha? would be
the most natural way of providing for
an increase) of revenue, as it would bo
less felt and more easily collected than
any other. It would fall on a product
capable of bearing it and the machinery
for. its collection already exists. The
restoration of tho duty on sugar would
add very materially to tho revenues,
but it would be an unpopular thing to
do, and probably will not be done. The
great problem that will confront tho
next administration and none can deny
that it will be a very difficult ono to
solve will be how to reduce taxes and
still maintain or increase the revenues.
The government must have just so
much revenue every year, and tho
amount is likely to increase for many
years to como. The Democratic party
is under solemn pledges to tho people to
reduce taxes, and it is under a bond to
fate to raise not only as much revenue
as the Republicans have been raising,
but even more, for more will be re
quired. How to do it and how not to do
it is tho question that confronts them;
how to increase tho revenue without
increasing taxes.
MB. LASGSDALE'3 DISCOVEEY.
The defense, which Commissioner
Langsdale has made of the changing of
the purpose of the soldiers' monument
is painfully weak when his intellectual
acuteness is taken into consideration.
There is one feature that is decidedly
original, and that is found in the state
ment that "the Union cause would have
been lost but for the soldiers trained in
the Mexican war who entered the Union
army and helped to organize it." Now,
the world understands the real cause of
the overthrow of the rebellion if they
accept the infallibility of Captain Langs
dale. It is a fact th.it quite a number
of Mexican veterans helped organize
tho federal army in the States of Indi-'
ann, Illinois and Ohio, and their serv
ices were of tho highest value, but out
side of those States t uch men were few,
indeed, being chielly graduates of West
Point, who had retired, like Grant and
Sherman, but pressed to tho front at
the first call. But there is another diffi
culty with Mr. Langsdalo's theory. It
is well known that ten Mexican veterans
went into the confederate army where
one went into the Union army. If these
huudreds had not better organized the
Southern army at the outset than did
the tens who aided in the organization
of the Union army the latter could have
overthrown the rebellion in six months.
It seems, therefore, that Captain Langs
dale's Mexican argument proves too
much.
Commissioner Langsdale points out
tbo fact that in tho files of the Journal
can bo found the statement that two
sides of the astragal "will" bo devoted to
the Mexican war, 1840 1848." This is
said to bo in an advertisement, and at
tracted no attention at the time. In
Commissioner Langsdale's report to
Governor novey, dated Nov. 10, 1600, the j
following description of "Astragal No. 1" i
is given in a notice to contractors which
is signed by George J. Langsdale and
dated Sept. 23, 1S00:
This astragal is to represent tho years of
the civil war, and will be placed twelve
leet below the capital of the mam shaft,
extending entirely around its four sides.
Its dimensions shall be: Width, six feet;
length at bottom, inside measurement, for
eich face of the shaft, thirteen feet and
five and one-bait inches; top, thirteen feet
and one and one-half inches; total measure
ment of astragal at lower line, lifty-three
feet and ten inches. On each of the bv
eral faces of the monument one of the
legends. "18C1," "1SG2," "lso3," ISO." will
appear in the order named, the figures to
be oiutlicit-nt size to be read from the earth
beneath. Tho astragal is to be delivered
at the monument, ready for setting, by the
first day of March. lb'Jl.
. It is doubtless true that the above was
changed, and that some notice was
given thereof, but the first real knowl
edge that any veteran had of it was
when tho figures were put in place. If
the chango was officially announced in
any report to tho Governor it was not
made public before the figures were put
on the monument.
An net of Congress requires the pres
idential electors of each Stato to meet
In the capital thereof on the second Mon
day in January and cast their votes for
President and Vice-president. Before
this law was enacted most of the States
had laws requiring tho electors to meet
on the first Wednesday in December,
but of course the national law super
sedes the State laws. The Kentucky
electors, however, duly impressed with
the necessity of maintaining the dignity
of a sovereign State, met in Frankfort
on Wednesday and went through the
farce of casting their votes for Clove
land and Stevenson. A Frankfort spe
cial to the Louisville Courier-Journal
describes the proceedings and adds:
The electors decided to return here on
the second Monday in January and to go
through with the same proceedings, that
the federal law as well as the conflicting
btate law may be complied with. They
also privately advised their messenger to
delay carrying the vote to Washington till
after the January meeting.
Somebody should have informed the
electors that when a State law "con
flicts" with a United States law it does
not "go.M Perhaps, however, they only
wanteifan excuse for making two trips
to the capital and drawing per diem
twice. m'
It is reported that the ritie which was
adopted by tho officers of the Gorman
army as the best that could be found has
proved to be of no value little better
than 60 many clubs. Still the whole
army is armed with them, and the change
means a largo cost. This goes to show
that such things are not donebetter by
a government which exists by the al
leged divine right of kings than they
are done here. Our army officers have
not been quito so swift to adopt new
models, but it has secured ono of the
best arms in, the world. If it is true, as
reported, thatthe rifle of the German in-:
fantrv is worthless what a neriod this'
would bo for Franco to get even with its!
old conqueror!
The Sentinel of yesterday contained '
owi-r a column of matter devoted to an
attempt to ridicule such veterans as
Commander Chcadle, Commander Tuck
er and others who have taken a prominent"
part in regard to the Mexicaniziug of the!
soldiers' monument becauso they are offi-j
cial representatives of the Grand Army,
and the Union Veteran Legion. Mr.;
Cheadlo enlisted Aug. 18. 1802, and;
served until the close of tho war, and.
Mr. Tucker enlisted Dec. 11, 1801, and
served forty-seven months. It'is ques
tionable taste to sneer at men with con
tinuous accords in the ranks like tho
gentlemen named and others who were
alluded to.
Tun world's fair committee on woman's
work in Indiana have called a public meet
ing of women in this city to discuss the
various phases of the work and to urge act
ive co-operation on the part of all who are
interested in having an exhibit from this
Stato that will x compare well-with others,
and of which citizens may be proad. Id
some of the Eastern States, notably Massa
chusetts, women are preparing a display
whose extent and character will, they as
sert, be a surprise and revelation to that
part of the pnblio which has not ac
quainted itself with the part that women,
are taking in the arts and industries. In
diana is not behind any other State in the
enterprise, business qualities and achieve
ments of her women, and shonld not fail to
demonstrate this progress at the fair. The
committee, however earnest and active it
may be. cannot accomplish this end with
out the assistance of all concerned, and all
women should at least attend the meeting
to learn what is expected of them and
what it is proposed to do.

INFECTED WITH MOTHS.
California Flour-Blill3ubjeeteI to Great Loss
by a Fest That Spins Strands of Silk.
Sax Francisco, Cal., Dec, a Tho Morn
ing Call has been investigating the subject
of the presence in the flour-mills of this city
and State of the Mediterranean flour-moth,
and it deolares that it has already become
analartmng pest, resulting in the loss of
thousands of dollars to a number of large
establishments, and that it will result in
still greater loss before very long. The state
ments are based mainly anon interviews
with W. G. Johnson, professor of entomolo
gy in Stanford University, and with
r number of flour manufacturers.
They state that there is hardly
a mill in the State which is not affected by
the moth, and thai all efforts to eradicate
it have been unsuccessful. The moth is con
tinually spinning straudsof silk in great
quantities, which not only get into the
Hour but also clog the machinery so badly
that the mills are obliged to shut down
temporarily. Professor Johnson, who has
made a careful study of the subject, savs
he has discovered that the moth propa
gates more rapidly in this climate than in
Canada, the Eastern States and other
colder countries where it has appeared.
He expects that the disastrous etlects of
tins moth will be very apparent in nearly
all the mills of the Stato before the end of
another year.

PROPOSED POLAR EXPEDITIONS.
Two Scherfulrd to Start in the Spring and
Another Under Consideration.
New York, Dec. & Two expeditions are
scheduled to start on an exploring tour to
the polar basin next spring, and it may bo
that a third will be fitted out. A remarka
ble fact in connection with the proposed
enterprises is that no two of them will be
conducted on the same plan. Dr. Nansen
hopes to drift in tho ice to the desired lati
tude in a specially contrived eraft, Lieut.
Peary believes he can only succeed in reach
ing the edge of the ice-cap by sledging it
over the mainland,, while other arctic navi
gators incline to the opinion that the plan
that oilers the best possible results is that
suggested by Commander Cheyne. of the
English navy, viz.: sailing over the ice
peaks by balloon rather than through them
in ships. Tho first of the proposed expedi
tions to m ike for the frozen seas will be
that of the North Greenland Exploration
Society, which will be partially fitted out
by the Academy of Natural Sciences, of
Philadelphia, and will be directed by Lieut,

The .telegraph brings the interesting
news that Mr. Thomas Watson, of Geor

fully wrestled with a street-sweeping ma

Alabama, tbo transcendentalism who so
ably handled the question of the Where
nessof His Atness at the last session, was
on deck as "peart" and chipper as a jay
bird. All this is explained by the fact that
Thomas the Heformer has been given leave
to stay at home, right in the heart of Mr.
Cleveland's Cradle of Civil Liberty, while
the wicked Cobb is billeted for the haven

SUITS AGAINST UNCLE SAM
Interesting Points from the Annual Re
port of the Attornej-General.
War Claims Aggregating $400,000,000 Filed
Afjainst the Government, and thend lias
Not Been Reached Recommendations.
Washington, Deo. a Attorney-general
Miller has made a report to Congress in re
gard to the business of the Department of
Justice during the last fiscal year, show
ing that tbe business of tbe department is
continually and largely increasing. This
increase, he says, is most noticeable in the
business before the Court of Claims. The
reference to that court for investigation
and findings of claims for the taking and
injury to property of persons assuming to
have been loyal during the war, such
claims being already between niue thou
sand and ten thousand in number, and in
amount aggregating nearly 8 k)0. 000,000, and
still moc.0 recently the duty imposed upon
that court of trying claims for Indian dep
redations, such claims already hied being
over eight thousand in number, and ag
gregating over $33,000,000, are very sug
gestive of the growing work of the depart
ment. Mr. Miller reviews briefly the work of
the United States Supreme Court, and says
he is glad to be able to report that, as the
result of the organization of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, the' number of cases in
the Supreme Court is being reduced. He
also refers to the business before the Cir
cuit courts, and suggests that some pro
vision be enacted by Congress for tho pay
ment of district attorneys for services in
these courts, so that it will not be left to
the discretion of the Attorney-general.
The necessity for such discretionary oction.
he says, ought to be by legislation reduced
to the minimum. This whole eubject of
the management of the government's busi
ness in the Circuit Court of Appeals ought
to have the careful attention of Congress.
In regard to the business of the Court of
Private Land Claims, he says that there
have been tiled in that court since its or
ganization a total of forty-three cases, in
forty-two of which the government is de
fendant and iu one plaintiff. Of these cases
thirty-seven are from New Mexico and
three from Arizona. Tbe total number of
acres of land claimed m the .New Mexican
grants aggregates 2.00,05 acres; in Arizona
grants, t7,o'J5. Of these cases seven have
been tried and final deerees of confirma
tion rendered covering 2GS,o(l acres.

ernment in the Court of Claims other than that
pertaining to Indian depredations, a largely in
creased volume of work durlnc tho pan year is
shown. Under the act of March 3, 18 o, known
os the Bowman act, -48 cases were disposed of
durins: the year, the aggregate of claims covered
by said cases being '-'.dttfJ'JD. In 153 of these
cnes findings were made against the govern
ment for an atrsrexate sum of $485,546. The
claims of this claae, growing out of the alleged
tuking of supplies and other property during
the war. are asuiu1:r enormous proportions.
They already utr: rebate nearly -i JO.OOO.OOO,
and the department has reliable information
that a multitude of additional claims, aggregat
ing very larce sum., are being prepared to be
filed and pushed against the treasury. That a
very lare proportion of tnese claims have no
just foundation, cither in fact or law. beta? pre
sented by persons, or the representatives of per
sons, who were not loyal to the government dur
ing the war. is every day made clear in the ev
idence in their defense. Unless Congress shall
put some new barrier between the treasury and
these claims, it is impossible to predict the
amount the government may bo called upon to
pay thereon.
Under the general and SDeoial jurisdic
tions SS7 cases, claiming over $20,000,000,
were disposed of during tte past year. Iu
13 73 of these casos decisions were made in
favor of the claimants for an aggregate of
a little over 1 1,590,000. ;
TRENCH SPOLIATION CASES.
During thevpast fiscal year decisions were
made in the French spoliation cases in fa
vor of the claimants aggregating $SS9, 054,
and the total amount allowed up to this date
in 710 cases is $3,241 Tho total number
of the petitions which have been filed ag
gregate about $10,000,000. Up to Nov. 1
8,5'Jt claims had been filed under the Indian
depredations claims acts, representing in
all $33,151,050. The aggregate of such
claims die posed of it, $1,373, 757. The amount
of judgments recovered on such claims is a
little more than 33 percent. of the de
mand. Mr. Miller recommends that provision be
made for the construction of tbe three
prisons authorized by the Fifty-hret Con-
I gress. The total number of United Status
prisoners in custody during the year was
3,000. The number of convicts pardoned
by the President during tbe year was
seventy-one, out of 755 applications. Sen
tences were commuted in ninety-two cases.
The Attorney-general 6 ays the Texas
boundary case, involving tho title to 1,517,
000 acres of land embraced in the territory
lying at tbe southwest corner of Oklahoma,
is being pushed by the government as
rapidly as possible, and the defendants have
promised to assist iu speeding tho case to
final hearing. He reviews briefly the liti
gation in the Dell telephone case and also
the litigation for the enforcement of the
provisions ot the act of Aug. 7, 1888, re
quiring all railroads receiving subsidies
lrom the United States to establish and
operate their own telegraph lines. The
Attorney-geueral discusses the decision of
Justice Harlan in the case of the United
States against tbe railroads and telegraph
company pending in the Circuit Courts of
tbe United States tor the Northern district
of California. He says:
In view of the recent decision of the Supreme
Court of tho United states in the case of bhaw
vs. the Quincy Mining Company it may well be
questiouwd whether the broad proposition con
tended for relative to tbo inhabitancy of the
corporation will te finally sustained by the
Supreme Court. The result reached may be sus
tained upon another ground argued before Mr.
J ustioe Harlan, but not passed upon by him,
viz.. that tbe ordinary rule would not apply in
a case in which the United States i? a complain
ant. I desire to renew the recommendation con
tained in my last report that Section 1 of the act:
of Auk. 31, 18sS, bo amended by inserting the
proviso in italics, alter the word "inhabitant,"
in the following sentence, namely, "and no civil
suit shall bo brought before either of said courts
against any person by any original
process or proceeding in any other dis
trict than that whereof he is an
inhabitant. Provided, that any foreign corpora
tion may be sued in any district where it may be
found, process to he served as in iiko cases iu
the btaie where said suit or action is brought
touch an amendment would restore the law to
what it was for a century prior to the act of
March 3, 1837, and would impose on these
corporations a liability to be sued corresponding
to the right they enjoy to sue as plalnUffs. and to
remove suits in which they are defendants. In
many localities these great corporations have au
unwarranted influence among the people who
Hi e summoned as jurors in the Stats courts, and
it is not just that the Southern Fad Ho com
pany, which though chartered in Kentucky, docs
not own any property iu that tetate. and has no
olbces or ohlcers there, except a mere' clerk, but
which operates vast lines of railroads in tho
State of California, where it holds and ooutrols
millions of dollar ot property, and holds its di
rectors meetings and maintains its general otli
oes, shall be exempt from suit in the United
States couns in California and the litigant be re
quired to go to Kentucky to enforce his claims,
and after obtaining a Judgment there (if he is
fortunate enouch to tlnd any person upon whom
to obtain service), be compelled to go to Cali
fornia aud sue there upon the Judgment or de
cree in the State courts.
The Attorney-general details the action
takenby him for the enforcement of the act
"to protect trade and commerce against un
lawful restraints and monopolies,'' and
says:
It has been found In all cases Investigated that
great care and skill have been exercised in the
fonuation and manipulation of these combina
tions so a to avoid the provisions ot this statute,
and, as has been seen in the proceedings
growing out of the ludicttneuts in Massa
chusetts, those eflorts have not been without
success. It is hoped, however, that in the easts
commenced tho validity of this statute and IU
applicability to the abuses which have become
Very commou in the business of the country, un
der the uaine of trusts, may be demonstrated If
so. the investigation made and the evidence ac
cumulated incases where no proceedings have
been commenced will be raluable.
The only constitutional question of any
importance decided against tba govern
ment, the Attorney-general says, was tbe
one raised in tbe Counselman case, under
the interstate-commerce law. The Attor
ney-general renews the recommendations
made in his last annual report for federal
recognition of degrees in the crime of mur
der, for remedial legislation for Alaska,
for the correction of the evils of
tho fee system, and for tbe allow
ance of writs of error in criminal
cases. On this last mentioned subject the
Attorney-general nays that, as the law now
stands, it is in the power of a single dis
trict judge, by quashing an indictment, to
defeat auy criminal prosecution instituted
by tha government, and to annul a
against the government any criminal
statute enacted by Congress, and there ia
no possible remedy or way to right tbo
wrong.

day noon. A Long Branch train crashed
into tbe rear end of the Easton local, Jele
scoping the rear car, fatally injuring one
woman aud seriously injuring nine other
passengers of the same coach. Tbe aoci

The story ot the accident, as learned from,
tbe oihciuls of the road at -the actual
scene, is as follows: At half-past 11 o'clock
the Washington flyer, Easton local and
Long Branch express trains leave tbe foot
of Liberty street. A dense fog hung over
the river, and the terrv traffio was being
carried on with tbe usual carefulness. The
Central ferry-boat had reached midstream
and was steaming aloug slowly when sud
denly oneof the Central company's heavily-laden
transportation boats loomed uo
before the ferry-boat, and before the en
gines could be reversed there was a terri
ble crash. The passengers rushed wildly
about lrom side to side of the boat, and the
greatest confusion prevailed. (Quietness
was finally restored, and it was then dis
covered that. the front -rail of the ferry
boat had been carried away and a few win
dows broken. The panic-stricken passen
gers were huddled together iu the ladies'
oabin, shrieking and crying, when the cap
tain appeared among them and assured
them there was nothing to fear. The boat
proceeded more slowly to Communlpaw,
and arrived there fifteen minutes late.
Tbe tbr trains were quickly made up,
and the Washington flyer was The first to
draw out of the depot. Then followed the
Laston local, in charge of engineer Wol-'
verton. of Elizabeth. The Washington
train bad passed Dauforth avenue within
five minutes at a territio rate of speed. En
gineer Wolverton was running more cau
tiously, and had scarcely passed Danforth
avenue when a rear brakeman discovered
tbe body of a woman lying on the track, k
about hfty yards below the station. He
pulled the bell cord, and the crew hurried
back to care for the supposed injured wom
an. The discovery was quickly made that
the woman was sick, and had fainted and
fallen on the track, and had not beeu
strnck by the train. The crew returned to
the train, which lay about 150 yards below
the depot, and the signal to start was
given. The train was scarcely moving
when the Long Branch train rushed out of
the fog. and, before the collision could be
averted or warning given, crashed into tho
rear car of the Easton train.
JUMPED OFF THE UROOKLI.V BRIDGE.
Prrilons Leap of a Virginian That PesnUrd ia
Nothing Worse tban a check and Ducking.
New York, Dec. 8. Daniel McLaughlin,
a blacksmith of Koanoue, Va.a jumped ouT
'the Brooklyn bridge this afternoon into
the East river at a point just beyond tho
pier of tho Brooklyn side. "By a strange
coincidence the police boat Patrol was
coming along the river at the time. Police
men lially and Tully, who were on it, saw
the man as he leaped toward tie water.
When he 6truck. head first, tbe boat ba I
got within forty feet of the spot. As soon
as the man rose to the surface the patrol
men fished him up into the boat lie waa
unconscious. They then took him to tbe
police station, where, ho recovered con
sciousness. There were no bruises on Mc
Laughlin's body, but as he was faint, and
had presumably received lr al injuries,
he was removed to the bers-street
Hospital. Examination . hospital
developed the fact that ' ad not bus- .
taiued a mark as a resnl his perilous
jump. However, he is euttering from se
vere shock and from the effects of the water
in his system. The physicians say be will
recover within a day or two.
At 2 15 this afternoon the roan hired a
cab from the stand on High street. Brook
lyn, and asked the driver to take him
across the bridge. He paid his fare before
starting. When the vehicle was within -twenty
or thirty yards of the Brooklyu
tower tbe young man jumped out, scram
bled over the railing, and, balancing him
self fc? an instant, jumped. After re
peated attempts to get McLaughlin to tell
why he tried to kill himself, he muttered
out something abor.t persons being after
him, trying to take bis life. From this tbo
police drew the conclusion that he was in
sane. Silversmiths Form nv Trunt.

Ellis Island 1'mployra to 11 Reduced.
New York, Dec 8w There is consterna
tion on Ellis island to-day over tbe report
.that a number of tbe otucers and employes
are to bo removed on tbe score of economy.
The expenses of the immigrant bureau art
defrayed by the head tax on immigrants,
and since the twenty-day quarantine
order was issued the number of immi
grants arriving has dwindled so that tbe
tax is quite small. A big deficiency in con
nection with the island confronted the
Secretary of the Treasury, and be has de
cided something must be done to economize.
Establishing a Little Africa,
Kansas City, Dec. 8. Henry 1. Wolfe,
of Kansas City, Kan., a mem ler of tbo
Hoard of Trade, has bought one thousand
acres of land near that city on which be
proposes to colonize all ot the negroes ct
the town into a self-snpportina village.
The colored element of Kansas City. Kan.,
is in a bad way, and with the coming of
bad weather will be almost all dependent
on the city. Houses will . probably be put
up at once and in tbe spring gardens will
be set out. Forty thousand dollars has
been subscribed.
