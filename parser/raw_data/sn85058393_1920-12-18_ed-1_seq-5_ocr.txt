quarter to heed the advice of Washington,
wh" told us that "to he prepared for war Is
one or tho most effective means of preserv

Presidency John Adams, in a message to
Congress, said: "An efficient preparation for
war can alrr.o secure peace.''
All the.se years we have persistently Os

ing to an Associated Press despatch from
Tokln. It ftc-emed to be the consensus of
opinion or these young debaters thai while
the. legislation furnished sufficient provoca
tion for hostilities, yet as America was now
tetter prepared for war than was Japan it
would not be advisable for the latter to start
hostilities The leaders of both nation" n '

that "peace through preparedness" Im no Idle
cream
At a session of the League cf Notions at
Geneva, h few weeks ago. Senator Henri La
Fontaine one of the Peltrlnn atlegatet, made
tho declaration that the world was net jret
readv for disarmament. "It Is necessary to
Py frankly to t r people." he said, "that
the time for disarmament has not yet come.-'
I J ' Before the world could disarm, ha added.
"entirely different Ideas from those that t'i r-

Holds Lack of Preparedness
Is Equivalent to Disarmament
The world has had enough of war and
would be glad to reel that war was over for
all time. But It docs not feel so. and how
can It in view of present clay conditions? On
the Kast war, although on a reduced scale,
is atlll In progress, and conditions are such
that it may spread at any moment to alarm
ing proportions 1 the West. r,y r :n Japan
mass meetings have been held which seri
ously debate the question of "War with
America."
Surely in the face of this altuatlon no
-me man can advocate disarmament for
this country, and lack of adequate prepared
ness in these- days would be equivalent to
disarmament. In theac uncertain day 1 pre
paredness makes for peace and not for war.
and Washington, after all, waj right.
The most important provision in the Act
of June 4 Is the first aection Immediately
following the preamble, which provide):
"That the Arm the (Jjplted Suites shall
consist of the Regular Army, the National
Guard; while in the service f the United
Suites and tin- Organized Reserve. Includ;
; . : the Officers' Ileser vo Corps and the Kri
lis'.ed Reserve Corvs."
This act Is an nendment to the Act rf
June 3. 1916. which Is Known as the "Na
tional Defence Act.'" At that time O'ligres"
came very neur hitting the mark, but Just
ni .-.--il A 'comparison between the first
sections of the twi acts will show !-.iw far
the Act of June a. if:'0. 1- in advance f the
Act of June 3 I91C. Slid BOW It makes for
a definite military plan, whlrh the Act of
June 3, 1 ft 1 G. lacked The first section of
the National Defence Act reads as follows
"That tbe Army of the United Stat -s shall
consist of the Regular Army, the Volunteer
Army, the Officers Reserve Corps, the En
listed Reserve "orp. the National Guard
while In the service of the Unl ed States and
tUCh nlltrr Innrl lorcrs (is are HOf cr turfy l.r
hereafter authorized inn ."
The words in Italics show Jusl Wherein
tlu provision failed to establish a definite
plan of military organization, for it leaves
the whole mtll'ary extsbliphmcnt open to
future legislation Such other forces "as
ma hereafter he authorised by law" may
mean anything U is Just this leaving the
composition of the army Open to future
action and future p llcles. to be determined
after the arising of emergencies calling; for
ni Increase In the army that has found Ul
u .prepared for every war we have ever en
tered. Wc have never known just what our
amy was to be and of what It should be
composed, how raised and how organized
until after war has bee. declared.
United Stat' Peace Time Armies
Never Adequate to Meet Emergency
We h.ive never had a complete army or
ganization In time nf peace that was capable
of expansion in lime "f war. In each recur
ring occasion of war we have had to prac
tically create a new army In the civil war
wo relied at first upon the various Slate
militia forces then lirpe volunteer force
and linally conscription was resorted to In
the war with Spain the first thing we did
was to call for volunteers, and the National
Guard organizations which came Into the
Federal service came In as United States
volunteers the Government then having no
lower to draft the National Guard Into Fed
eral service. These volunteer forces were
temporary expedients and not part of any
regularly or permane-tiy organised military
establishment. Therefore much time and
money were expended in placing the i-onntrv
on a war footing We entered the world
war not knowing Just what our army was
to be, whether It was to t-c created by volun
tary enlistment alot-.e or bv voluntary enlist
ment and the draft. Neither was It known
definitely Just what part the National
Guard was to take In the war; whether It
was to be a part of the expeditionary or first
line forces or not. and the National Guard
iiad to be practically reorganized before it
could be made a part of the expeditionary
forces. Congress wisely declared Itself In
favor 'f the onl Just und democratic method
of raising an army In time of war, that of
compulsory military service or the aelectivo
draft.
So satisfactory were the results and so
. i
renml la now the feeling that the selective1
draft Is the only Just and equitable method
of raisins an army In time of war that it
can be said that the countrj is to-day com
mitted t.. the policy of th" selective draft.
Compulsory Military Service
Now One of Our Unwritten L ws
This fjci entered into the present plan if
national defence and while Congress unfor
tunately failed at the eleventh hour b
enact a law prosldiiuc that Immediately upon
a declaration of war selective conacrJptlou
should become operative, yet It Is apparent
that this method will be followed in ex
panding the present army to ar strength
at '. completing the Initial mobilisation con
templated by the act of June a. 1930. Indeed
It is not golns too far t eay that "com
pulatrry military service In time of war" is
now one of the unwritten laws f our lant
and necessarily enters lnt all plans and
policies having to do with the defence of
ihe nation
In section 3 of the a-'l of June 4 Ik another
Important prov ision for in t is section Con
grcas has provided that the orgajilzed peace
eatahllshnicnt of the army x-hall include all
of those divisions and other military organ

For purposes of administration, iratnin
and tactical control liie continental area of
the United States has been divided Into nine
corps areas, as shown by the imp These
corps areaa 11 ie to be organized to function
:i.n such in time of war as well as In time
of peace, r.nch corps area will contain

Cases army troops and troops for special ser

ing centre which shall Include organizations
and personnel sufficient to provide all ele
ments ncesary to procure and train re
cruit and replacement, to establish and
maintain all training camps and to carry
on such other activities as t lie corps area
commander may direct.
There hos always btcn more or less com
plaint about an alleged overabundance of
red tape at Washington and It can readily
he seen how much of this so-called red tape
or paper work nt tho War Department can
he eliminated by the establishment of these
varloys corps areas and having them func
tion as administrative units. For purposes
of inspection, of manoeuvres and of plans
of war the nine corps areas are grouped
Into three army areas, which ore also shown
on the map When considered deahable
army area commanders and .staffs may be
assigned to these nrruy areas.
For tho requited initial mobilization It Is
planned to have in each corps area one

divisions ot the Organised Reserve, together
with the nSOeSSary number of corps troop
and balanced percentages of tlcld army and
general headquarters rsssrvS Hoops. The
new tables of organisation have reduced the
peaco strength of an infantry division to
about 11,000 enlisted men. The total war
enlisted strength will be about 18.000.
The new tables of organization bring to
tin surface many of the lessons of the vsmld
war Noteworthy among the changes in or
ganization is the change in the regtmi p

rifle companies and three machine ;Un com

ot a rifle company will now be five officers

These now tables afford a subject for Inter
etlng discussion which cannot be gone Into
here.
The General Staff has proceeded upon the

National Guard's Future 4sr ed
With Praire for Its Fine Past pecord
The National Guard by Its record In the
world war fuuy Justified Its continued ex
latejice and earned a place for Itself In any
well considered .plan of national defence.
Iii the world war the National Guard fur
nished seventeen combat divisions, nearly
(101. cum officer and men Of the first five
divisions sent to France In 1917 three were
tfatlonal Guard: of the twerity-fpur Ameri
can divisions engaged In the ArgOIHia offen
sive or participating in British and French
operations al the time eleven were National
luard.
Another departure from ceir past lullltaty
policy was the provision In the act of June
t 1020. that nil policies and regulations af
fect, nr the organization distribution and
training of the National Guard should be
prepared and determined by " General Staff
comm)ttee, composed of an equal number of
Regular and National Guard officers, the
latter being made uddltiotuif members of the
Qeneral Staff for the time being.
For two months these committers have
been diligently nt work on the task allotted
tO them by law twelve officers from the
operations 'and War TMans divisions of the
War Department General Staff, working
with twelve Natinnnl Guard offleen holding
Reserve commissions and representing the
States of New York. Connecticut. Pennsyl

Colorado, Missouri. Oregon. Alabama and
Texas
These officers have been placed on the

not only am they participating to the full
