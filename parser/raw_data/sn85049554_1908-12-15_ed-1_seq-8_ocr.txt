Hurley, pastor of that church, on the
subject, "Masonry What It Stands
for." The address has received much
commendation from those in a posi

calculated to remove prejudice from
the minds of those who may havi
judged of the order without a knowl
edge of its principles and practices.
Mr. Thomas Kuller, of Chester, who
has been an Invajiri for many years, has
recently had added to his other phys

currence and violence of the attacks

stock judging. Both these men urged
very earnestly the formation of an ac
tive organization of the farmers, an 1
such a joining hands with the busi
ness men's organization of Grinnell as

course" here next year. Other speak
ers were Jacob Korns and J. D. Boyack.

ship Ralph Sherman, of Chester, and

venient one for the farmers, but, whili
not many were present, each one was
ready to vouch for a number of his
neighbors, and more than 100 have al
ready signed the application for charter
membership in tho organization.

given to the endowment fund by the
citizens and neai: neighbors of Grin

come in gifts of an even $1,0(1-0 each,
but when smaller gifts aggregate $1,

Hogs.
There was renewed activity, at
steady values, principally because to
day's run was fi.000 less than last
Tuesday. Scalpers and .shippers were
free buyers early, big packers holding
off until late.
If hog growers In the country are
desirous of aiding packers in -their bear
campaign they have only to keep the
market lnxpper tilled. With 230,000 hogs
at Chicago .last week imckcrs .were only
able to effect a depreciation of 25
cents per 100. On Saturday Armour put
up a drove of mixed at $5.50, which Is
50 cents per 100 above the Armour and
Cudahy forecast. Whether or not that
half dollar is to 1m_ taken off dejfeuds
on the grower. This week will furnish
a test, as the Pittsburg and Buffalo
markets will again 'be In operation, af
fording oa-steiYi shippers an oppor
tunity to buy at least a portion of their
droves nearer home. Growers must now
sell on a H-cent country basis and !t
remains to be seen whether they are
in tho humor to do that or not. Whllo
not as ravenous for hogs as a few
weeks ago packers nevertheless display
a willingness to buy them whenever
even a slight concession is made and
the big supply last week was well

How to Jieep from Taking Cold.
Habitual colds are due to an ill kept bkin
on the outside and dyspeptic mucous inent
brane'on the inside, the result of indigestion,
coupled with carelessness. Cold water, proper
food and common sense are the foundations
upon which a preventive must rest. A cold
sponge bath, one to three minutes long be
fore breakfast, with a brisk dry Tub, is ex
cellent—usually all that is necessary to keep
the cutaneous circulation alive and the skin
reactive to 6udden changes of temperature.
For those unaccustomed to cold water, tol
errthco can be gained in three weeks' time by
the use of water at any comfortable temper
ature, making it one degree colder each day,
until it can be employed without dread as
colli as it will run. Sea Bait may be added
to the water for its stimulating eflect.
Cold water intelligently used does not steal
vitality, but fosters it. It stimulates the
nerves that control the expansion and con
traction of the blood vessels and regulates
tho cutaneous circulation.
One should "keep moving" when wet or
chilly and not 6tand on a street corner or
elsewhere without taking deep breath. The
lungs used in this way act as a pump to drive
the blood along. This prnctice, with the
others named, wi'.l reduce to a shadow the

Roosevelt prepared to Go After
Congress Willi Vigor If
Nrcessary^
HEARST COLLECTl
ON TAP
They are wondering whether tho
president lias up his sleeve another
series of exposures which may prove
us sensational as those of William
Randolph Hearst during the recent
campaign.
Will Go* to Extremes.
It is now very well understood by
the leaders of congressional indigna
tion. that the president is in a frame of
mind to go to extremes if necessary in
order to "make good," with his charges
of improper motives for placing limi
tations on the employment of the
secret service.
'Mr. Roosevelt is a genius for the art
of being prepared. It is one of his
maxims that the way to avoid war is
to be ready for It. That maxim he ap
plies quite as rigorously to political
conflict a? to physical and interna
tional. He is the possessor of a mar
velous magazine of weapons and am
munition adapted to the contest which
congress has been threatening. That he
is determined to employ them to tho
very limit, if the issue be forced upon
him, is now accepted as beyond con
jecture.
"Prepared?" echoed one of the pres
ident's advisors when asked if tho
White House were ready for the fray:
"Well, I should say so. Haven't you no
ticed that we always are prepared?"
It is understood on excellent author
ity that the president is especially In
dignant against certain members of the
house appropriations committee who
took an active part in the legislature to
cripple the secret service, at the last
.session. He is said to have a fine ar
ray of material with which to enliven
the situation if the issue is pressed:
and he is so anxious for the showing
•McBride & Will Drug of strength that he is not disposed to
ret,ulre more than a very delicate slap
on the wrist in order to Induce him to
jump into the center of the arena with
the big stick in hand, and to lay about
him with even more than accustomed
vigor.
Will Play Ducks and Drakes.
Tt is predicted that if the chief exec
utive is invited into the ring he will
play ducks and drakes with a choice
collection of political reputations. For
seven years he has been watching de
velopments in connection with the In
nermost relations and influences that
are influential with men in public life.
He has a fine card index array of in-
formation which will make the most
sensational kind of reading if it is ever !Leml.er
transmitted in the form of a message.
The president doesn care tiro snap
of his finger for any such mild-man
nered action as the expunging of a
paragraph or a message. He knows
that the thing expunged will, by that
act, he 'brought to tho attention of the
country as nothing else would bring
it. He doesn't feel any concern about
specific charges, made in a public way,
being expunged from -the public's rec
ollection. Ho has been struggling with
congress for years in the effort to wrest
its leadership into a respectful atten-
tion to his demands. He is rather anx- old,
powerful railroad politician in his
district. Nobody else excer that rail
road manager could have been much
concerned. The public's interest plain
ly enough lay on one side the rail
road's on the other. The congressman
voted with the railroad interest. The
president, let it be assumed—and it
can be assumed as to some cases—has

Hearst collection, which Involved lead
ing republicans and als6 some demo
crats, were suppressed. Report, and
extremely circumstantial report, was
that it required tho exercise of -much
Ingenuity and effort to prevent the
publication of certain of these letters.
The president is understood to know
all about those cases, or some of them.
Likewise he Is said to have a line in
dependent array of evidence, and tie
lias had Chief Wilkle of tho secret
service at -work establishing the con
nection between certain curious things
in tho record and certain relationships
of public men to interests commonly
I assumed to be (powerful In framing
legislation. Newspaper files, tho Con-

(Special Correspondence.)
Washington, Dec. 15.—is the Roose­
velt. administration tr* end with a
struggle between president and con
gress. which will recn.ll tho history of
the day.4 of Andrew Jackson and An
drew Johnson?
The question will be a.nswered very
soon.
The announcement that tho presi
dent is prepared with specific cases
and illustrations to give proof of im
proper relations between members of
congress and big private interests con
cerned about legislation, has caused
something very like a panic among
statesmen who have been clamoring
for a rebuke to the chief executive.
.. Information have been laid under levy
That Would Put A Few Members of pr0(jUCo the evidence of these rela
Congrcss Into the Foraker-Haskell tionships.
It Is predicted by men who have a
pretty dellnito impression of tho pres
ident's plan of battle, that if he Is In
vited to turn loose his collection of in
teresting material, tho battlefield will
be strewn wilh tho wreckage of dis
tinguished reputations, and the Ananl
a,s club will receive accessions to its
membership which will make it look
like a roster of eminent publicists. No
body has evor accused the president of
any lack of resourcefulness and it is
known that he was never moro confi
dent of his ground than he 4s now, .sur
veying the ground which congress
seems to have picked as a field of final
battle with tho executive.
