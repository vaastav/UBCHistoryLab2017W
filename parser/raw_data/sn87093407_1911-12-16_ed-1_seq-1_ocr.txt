ONE YEAR SINCE GILLIAM
SENTENCED STAR EDITORS
FOR "CRIME OF CRITICISING"
It is one year ago today since Judge Gilliam dug up that antiquated old law
under which state judges can jail editors or citizens who happen to criticise them.
Cfi«ni sentenced the editors of The Star to jail for so-called contempt because
flw Star denounced and criticised his injunction against die Duwamish Valley
people in their long fight against the Furth Traction monopoly.
Since that time the supreme court abrogated Gilliam's injunction by deciding
the original rate case in favor of the people, and Jake Furth's concern is now pay
ing back to the people the money grabbed while the boosted rates were in effect.
The case of The Star editors, however, has made little progress and will prob
ably not reach the supreme court until the term of next spring.
Gilliam's use of the questionable contempt law was the first time in 20 years
H has been invoked in this state. It is known as the constructive contempt
law and gives judges arbitrary and czarlike power to silence free speech and
honest criticism.
Federal judges had this same arbitrary judicial club until 1831. Then some
federal judges, considering themselves sacred, jailed a couple of editors. And
then congress landed on the judicial necks with a thud and the federal judges have
since been deprived of this prerogative.
Most states have also abolished the measure and the state of Washington
would have blotted it off the books last winter had it not been for the corporation
flunkies who got into die legislature.

Sees Taft—Sulzer Gets In
dignant.
(By United Prtai Lm«4 Wlr«)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.—That
the resolution introduced by Con
gressman Sulzer of New York to
i abrogate the treaty of 1832. between
the United States and Russia, will
be considered as an "insult to Rus
sia" if enacted into law, la the sub
stance of a message conveyed to
President Taft by Secretary Knox
I today, following a conference be
tween Knox and Ambassador Bakh
meteff of Russia.
Negotiations Broken Off
The diplomatic negotiations seek
ing tho settlement of the passport
| question have been broken as a
result of Russia's dissatisfaction at
the action of the house of repre
sentatives In favoring Congressman
Sutler's abrogation resolution.
It was positively stated that the
message bv the Russian ambassa
dor was not a threat against Ameri
ca. The ambassador said that Rus
sia did no* object to the abrogation
of the treaty of 1832, but did object
strongly to the language of the
Sulr.er resolution flatly charging
Russia v !h bad faith, and violating
the terms of the treaty.
Leaves Taft In Air
Tho sudden termination of nego
tiations leaves President Taft be
reft of the means whereby he hoped
to forestall congressional action ob
the Jewish passport question. The
president summoned Chairman Cul
lom of the senate foreign commit
tee and urged him to amend the
resolution so as to eliminate the
language which Russia finds of
fensive. President Taft said that
the same result would be accom
plished by a "temperately-worded"
resolution.
