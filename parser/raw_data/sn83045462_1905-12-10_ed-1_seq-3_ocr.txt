slderable amusement In the course of the
evening. Great curiosity was manifested
over the curtained stage which atood in the
center of the east wall. The company was
not left long In suspense. When th6 oyaters
had been dispatched the lights in the hall
went out and the curtain of the stage was
drawn, disclosing a weird scene. It was a
cave in the inferno. A skeleton stood in
one corner, shedding a baleful gleam from
Its eyeless skull. In the other corner an
owl blinked at a demon perched on a rock.
Initiates Literally on the Gridiron.
In the center of the stage were three
large gridirons, beneath which a realistic
arrangement of electric lights gave the ef
fect of glowirrg coals. The "grand inquisi
tor," carrying the "big stick," was seated
in a chair and at his left stood his head
devil. Near them were three cowled figures
placarded as Secretary Root, Secretary
Shaw and Secretary Taft.
Down the aisle came three members of
the club recently elected who were to be
initiated, Messrs. E. G. Walker, R. V. Oula
han and J. H. Small, jr., escorted by a
representative of the club. The Initiates

OMIT NONE OF THE AMEN
were placed upon the giowing gridirons,
where they squirmed and groaned.
"Here are three candidates for admission
to the Gridiron Club," said the Interlocutor.
"They are In a sad predicament. Two Of
them were caught red-handed In writing
special dispatches on cabinet matters. The
third Is suspected of having voted the reg
ular republican ticket at the last election.
They are now in the hands of the grand
inquisitor and his cabinet. May heaven
have mercy upon them. They have been
doomed to torment until the Keep commis
sion makes good."
"Then their punishment is eternal," re
marked President Carson.
A warning flourish of the big stick em
phasized disapproval of this criticism.
"This man should be done to a turn," said
Secretary Root's proxy, prodding the un
fortunate Oulahan with a toasting fork.
"He dared to ask me if I had attended a
cabinet meeting. He has printed in hia
paper that our head devil owns stock in
the government printing office. His alleged
election was accomplished by a corrupt and
criminal combination masquerading as
Grldironers. Where does he stand on the
railway rate question?"
"Give him transportation and he cares
not who makes the rates," whereat the
grand Inquisitor nods approval and shakes
the big stick.
Almost Forgot Hia Muzzle.
Then Secretary Shaw's proxy advanced to
the squirming Walker, and after a vigorous
poke with the toasting fork, declared:
"Let Justice be done, though the markets
fall. This man came to the Treasury De
partment and asked me if it were true that
the grand inquisitor had instructed me to
give twenty-five millions to Wall street.
I was on the point of yielding when I
glanced at the head devil's letter of in
struction which I keep on my desk before
me. I showed no weakness and had no
pity for him, but Immediately sent for the
press association and told them a funny
story."
Secretary Taft then fell upon the writh
ing Mi-. Small with his fork and said:
"This is a George B. Cox republican. Had
I not been away on a trip I should have
gone home and voted against him. I would
swap my presidential chances for a seat on
the supreme bench before I would admit
him to the club. He is the product of a
corrupt machine."
"Hold on! You are very much mistaken.
This is a Gridiron daisy and was raised bq
hand. He is a flower of the Small and
Early variety."
Then, the grand inquisitor rising, said:
"G-e-n-t-l-e-m-e-n: This Is an extremely
embarrassing situation. There has been a
misunderstanding of orders all around. It
is all due to the blundering of my head
devil in sending you the letter I dictated.
It is needless to say that his mistake is in
excusable. (Turning to Oulahan.) You must
remember. Mr. Oulahan, that my head
devil is immune. You have been sufficiently
toasted Head devil, release him."
"Mr. Walker, you must take dinner with
me. I have a new book to discuss with
you. It is by James B. Reynolds and enti
tled 'If Fish were Hides, where would
Crane 1/odge?'
"Mr. Small, we will assign you to Secre
tary Wilson's department. He needs a
jractlcal man. He has too many experts
n his busirfess.
"Boys, we've had a bully time; let us ex
press our renewed relationship in a song.*'
With that the group marched out sing
ing,
"Give my regards to Moody,
Remember me to Oortelvou,
Tell Shaw and Taft and all the cabinet
We know* what to do.
Whisper to Hitqjicoek softly,
We'll practice on him anon;
We'll And a way to get the news.
No matter if the gag la on."
Topical Songs for All.
The Gridiron Quartet and Chorus fur
nished other topical Songs for the enter
tainment. There was one for Speaker
Cannon, sungMo the air of "Hang up the
Fiddle and the Bow," the chorus of which
ran:
"So lay the tariff Question In its gr-a-a ye
Along ?Ith railroad rebates 'neath the dome;
There won't be any work for Congress now to do;
You might as well all go borne.
Vice President Fairbanks had a song ded
icated to him also. It was to the tune of
"Everybody Works But Father," and the
chorus was:
"Everybody works but Fairbanks;
He sits there all day
Listening to tbe speeches
Made In tbe same old way,
Allison, Ijodge and Gorman
All are in the ranks?
Everybody works In the Senate
But Mister Fairbanks."
The railroad men present were handled
In a song, and then to the familiar air of
"Tammanee" rang out this chorus: .
"Beverldge, Beveridge,
You're a gay young Hooeler Boy,
You're the Senate's pride and joy;
Beveridge, Bererlde.
Fine debater, great o-rator?
Beveridge!"
Wireless Messages Received.
The "wireless" telegraph messages re
ceived during the evening were read to the
company by a member of the club. Some
of them were as follows:
"MADISON.

"Please advise me on tills point: Do you

Telepathic Demonstrations.
In the midst of the evening a club mem
ber arose and announced that one proposed
feature of the entertainment would have
to be omitted. A celebrated professor of
telepathy had intended to give some dem
onstrations of his art. but had fallen sick
in the lobby. However, the professor's
"lrt>y' was on hand, and as this club mem

self, he would utilize the boy and make a
few experiments.
The boy proved to be the tallest and
heaviest man In the club, rigged out In
Lord Fauntleroy costume. He passed some
slips for guests to write their questions,
two members of the club were brought up
and blindfolded and then the substitute pro
fessor held before their bandaged eyes the
alleged propositions by the guests, which
were read for the company's edification.
These were among the tests submitted:
Hitchcock?"I have several In my eye
right now."
Shaw?"I positively refuse to stay In the
cabinet after March 4, 15)09."
Loeb?"Nobody knows the trouble I have."
Taft? "What's sixteen millions between
friends?"
Wilson?"There's many a leak between
the cotton and the crook."
Moody?"One big trust litigation In hand
Is worth two years more In the cabinet."
Morton ? "Every insurance president
should have his own submarine boat."
Shonts?"Oh. where is my wandering

Cannon-?"There Is no tariff on foot ball,
so revise it all you please."
Beveridge?"I can make a better speech

George W. Boyd?"Free list positively

a pass by some other name may smell as
sweet."
J. Plerpont Morgan?"New York Life fas
cinates me."
A Peace Conference.
The entertainment closed with" a Gridiron
Club peace conference. Upon the sugges
tion of a member the chair appointed three
envoys from the club, with an interpreter,
to consider a number of cases of reported
extreme belligerency among public men.
The protocol of the bloody warfare exist
ing between Vice President Fairbanks and
Senator Beverldge declared:
"The attention of the Gridiron peace con
ference is called to the frightful struggle
that lias been going on in Indiana for many
years between Vice President Fairbanks
and Senator Beveridge. This has brought
about much distress and suffering along I
the banks of the White river. It has
caused Vice President Fairbanks to say I
things privately about Senator Beverldge
that would not look well in print, and has
led Senator Beveridge to think thoughts
that will have to be filtered before they
are used. Moreover, it has led to much
wear and tear on the body politic of In
diana who spend their time trying to find
out who is on top, so that the proletariat
may not get left, and are thus deprived of
opportunity to exercise their natural func
tion of writing historical novels, poetry
and plays and of skinning such suckers as
may come within the borders of their
state."
1 wo club members advanced as proxies
for Mr. Fairbanks and Mr. Beverldge and
scowled at each other. "Who are you?" de
manded Beveridge.
"I, sir, am the man who Invented Fair
banks scales. And who are you?''
"Ye Gods! What a question! I am the
man who invented soda water!"
Gorman and Rayner.
The chairman then read another protocol:
"It having developed recently that the
great concern of the two senators from
Maryland for the uplifting of the black
voters has caused them to fall Into a condi
tion of acute hostility, the Gridiron Club
peace conference is hereby asked to pacify
these belligerents and restore amity In
Maryland. The terrapin are In hid ng. The
canvas-back ducks are not lighting in the
Chesapeake; Gorman is sulking In his tent
at I>aurel and Rayner Is putting out state
ments at the rate of six an hour."
The proxies of these senators came for
ward.
"I'll never speak to him," cried Senator
Gorman's proxy. "He is the man who
wrote 'AH Coons Look Alike to Me.' "
"Yes, and-I'm going to write another, en
titled T Don't Care If You Never Come
Back,'' anwered Senator Rayner's proxy.
Secretary Taft and Senator Dick were
represented by proxies.
"At last I meet you face to face!" said
Senator Dick's proxy. "You are the man
who has sought to embitter my existence
and make me look like one of Tom John
son's 3-cent car fares!"
"Mr. Secretary, are you going to submit
to this tirade In silence?"
"I am a cabinet officer. Are there any
newspaper correspondents present?"
"The room is full of them."
"I am a cabinet officer," said the Taft
proxy, and he proceeded to tie a handker
chief over his mouth.
Champion Belligerents.
Senators Spooner and La Follette were
represented by proxies, and quarreled and
glared.
"We have assembled before us the world's
foremost belligerents," announced the chair.
"I submit that it is the duty of this honor
able conference to make every effort to
pacify them. If necessary, we must use
fore*?."
During speech evidences of hostility had
grown rapidly; angry murmurs filled the
air.
"Gentlemen, this Is a solemn hour. Every
body is at peace but you. The Gridiron
Club Is determined that amity shall be
universal, so that everybody can Join In
and soak the railroads. We have been ap
pointed to bring about a lasting and honor
able peace. We" beseech you "
The protests grew Into a veritable riot.
The proxies would not have peace At that
a fantastic figure, carrying a demijohn ap
peared, announcing this message from W
T.Jerome:
"To the Gridiron Peace Conference: I have
tTied all kinds of peace dope, and I desire
to indorse the hearer as possessing th<y only
reliable formula for reform In existence
And what is your brand of reform?"
pio-reform!" cried the newcomer.
"I hate to do it." said the chair, "but
its our only chance for peace. Take them
away, and the head chloroformer marched
away with his vlqtims.
Enlivened by Speeches.
Several delightful speeches during the
evening by prominent men enlivened the
proceedings. Mindful, perhaps, of the ad
monition that report*? are never present.
they spoke with great freedom. Vice Presi
dent Fairbanks was called to hta feet by the
?on* sung In hi* honor and made a abort
and facetious speech. Secretary Taft wu
routed from hi* *#at by hi* song and talked
to the company with his accustomed grace
fulness . Mr. Charles Emory Smith was
called up and voiced Ills pleasure In
mingling again with hie former associates
among statesmen and newspaper men.
Secretary Shaw made a very bright and
humorous talk, being provoked by m
monologue delivered by one of the club
men entitled "When Shaw Sleeps."
Speaker Cannon held the audience for
ten minutes and took occasion to make a
number of sly digs at those he termed
"reformers" In Pennsylvania, .Ohio and
Massachusetts politics, and had a good
word to say for the "standpatters."
Senator Beveridge defended the Senate
against the cabinet In a humorous talk,
and also had a fling or two at the reform
ers. Karon Rosen, the Russian ambassa
dor, snchanted the company with u
charmln* little speech. It wa-S his first
Gridiron dinner, and he liked it.

HOLLAND'S FUTURE DUBIOUS.
The Kaiser Exported to Be Covetous of
Her Seaports.
Syecial Cablegram to The Star.
THE HAGUE, December 0.?Belief every
where is growing that the German Kaiser
has cast longing eyes towards the seaports
of Holland and tjiat he has-inaugurated a
commercial and economic If not political
conquest of the nation, has given rise to all
sorts of speculation regarding the future of
this country.
It is only a few years ago that the hopes
of the people of Holland were pinned on
their queen. Much was expected from her
marriage, but the people, as well as the
queen herself, have been grievously disap
pointed.
A horse attached to a buggy, the prop
erty of R. A. Steele, ran away from In

PLEADED GUILTY TO MURDER.
Doctor Held for Serious Charge?Case
Under Advisement.
CHICAGO, December 9.?I>r. Oliver B.
Hart, who c&me to this city fr6m St. Douis
some months ago, pleaded guilty today to
the murder of Irene Klokow*.
The charge against Dr. Hart was mur
dering the Klokow girl, who was but twelve
years of age, by the administration of mor
phine. He was left alone in the house with
the girl, and exactly what happened has
never been known, but Hart called for an
other physician, who came and found the
girl dying, Hart vainly attempting to revive
her. She died In a few minutes and Hart
denied at the time, and until his appearance
in court today has always denied, that he
Kave the girl morphine in sufficient quan
tities to cause her death. He was asked
by Judge Barnes If he knew that under his
plea of guilty he could be sentenced to
death, and he nodded affirmatively.
It was agreed by the state's attorney and
by counsel for Hart to leave the case to
Judge Barnes for sentence, but witnesses
were Introduced to show that Hart was not
mentally responsible. Several prominent
alienists, one of whom pronounced him a
"high grade idiot," declared that Dr. Hart
was mentally Incompetent.
Judge Barnes took the case under advise
ment, declaring that he would hand down
his decision in a few days.
