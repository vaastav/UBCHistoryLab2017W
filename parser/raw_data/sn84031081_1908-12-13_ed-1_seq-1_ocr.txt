EXECUTIVE BY JUDGE
Pennslyvanian Denounces the
Rosevelt Attitude Toward
Judiciary as Marking Long
Step in Direction of Anarchy
Moraine JhihI NaMlal Imh4 Wlr
New York, Dec. 12. Indirect but
pointed criticism of Roosevelt's atti
tude toward the Judiciary was made
by Chief Justice Mitchell, of Pennsyl
vania, in nn address tonight at the
banquet of the Pennsylvania Society
of New York. The thief Justice did
not mention thu executive by name
hut left no doubt through his quota
timis and his allusions to various mat
ters of public knowledge as to the
object of hid criticism was.
The courts, the bar and the laws
of slates und nation, were discussed
from various viewpoints by the speak
ers, who, beside Justice Mitchell, were
Attornel General Honaparte, Jame M
Heck and Hampton L. Carson.
Chief Justice Mitchell expressed re
gret that an effort was making to
weaken the lines of distinction so ad
mirably defined In the .federal consti
tution. "For the cure of evils temporarily
prominent it is impatiently advocated
that the combined powers of the gov
ernment be centralized In the execu
tive," he said. "The only safety for
all is obedience to law as it is writ
ten, and not to a strained and dis
torted construction to make it mean
what It does not and never was in
tended to mean, but honestly and fear
lessly to carry out the real. meaning of
Its makers.
"The only Just criticism of a Judge's
law must come from court which
Knows the taw and ñas Jul IsUlctum m
declare It. Dessent from li is view
based on Individual opinion of what
the law ought to be, whether It comes
from an executive or hoodlum, leads
directly and by short steps to un an
archythe assertion of individual will
against the settled law. The ver?
librases so prominently put forward
of "judges who have lagged behind HTP
lines' and 'Judges who hold to a
twentieth century economic philoso
phy" betray not only Ignorance, but a
deplorable Incapacity to keep In mind
the fundamental principles of the Am
erican government. If the law as de
clared by the constitutional tribunal
Is not what the people want it to be,
then let It be changed, but let it never
be lost sight of that tha authority to
change it is legislative, not Judicial,
still less executive.
United Htates Senator Holes. Pen
rose and P. C. Knox were among the
guests at the dinner.
Mr. Heck quoted what he said were
speeches of Attorney General Hona
parte, jn, which Mr. Ponaparte was
represented as saying: "The tendency
toward combination exists in every
civilized country, and exactly In pro
portion to Its civilization."
Mr. Honaparte interrupted with a
protest that he was misquoted.
As Mr. Peck proceeded he again
quoted the attorney general as having
said emphatically: "No legislation in
restrain of combination is desirable."
Mr. Honaparte then said he bud
some time ago entertained similar
ideas, but he had fince been convinced,
he said, that it was a choice between
such legislation and revolution, and
he believed that the American people,
would choose wisely in legislation to
regulate the great combinations or
commerce.
Mr. Beck concluded the Incident by
saying that the attorney general, hav
ing voluntarily taken the stand, lie

Colon, Dec. 12. A giant blast of
dynamite was prematurely exploded in
the canal working at Has Obispo to
day. Ten men were killed and lilty
injured. It may be that others were
killed, for tne debris Is piled lip in all
directions.
Has Obispo cut is about thirty miles
from Colon and the shock of th
plosion was distinctly felt here.
Numerous reports are current as to
the cause of the accident but the of
flclal version from Culebra, whlc
gives an estimate of ten killed and
fifty wounded, states that during th
loading of the last hole of the blast
the dynamite in this cut was dis
charged anif the remaining twenty
two tons were exploded ty concuKsion
The holes had not been connected
electrically as the discharge of th
blast was set for D o'clock In the af
ternoon. The last hole was being
loaded under the supervision of oni!
of the most efficient powder men In
the employ of the commission.

Washington, Dec. 12 --The annual
fall dinner of the Gridiron club held
at the New Willard tonight, was made
flotable by the presence of a distin
guished company of guests. An ex
tended program made the night one
long to be remembered. The presi
dent, the vice president, the president
elect and vice president-elect, the sen
ators and representatives without
number, an English lord, diplomats of
this and other countries, newspaper
nun, captains of finance and industry
and men of nlfuirs were guesta of the
club and seated about the gridiron
sha tied table.
In an unusual degree the souvenir
of the dinner, a miniature steam roll
er, was urihiue. It drew particular at
tention to Chairman Frank H. Hitch
cock, of the republican national com
mittee, who was one of the notable
guests. The roller was a little bronze
affair with the name "Ta ft" on the
obverse and the Gridiron club on the
other aide.

Vice President-elect Sherman, E. H.
Harrlman, the distinguished finan
cier; champ Clark, the new minority
leader of the house; Vice President
Falrbunks and Governor John John
son, of Minnesota, were among the
distinguished guests, but a rule of the
club prevents any report of their re
marks. one of the most delightful skits of
the evening was furnished by a roll

Washington, 1 1. C, Dec. I The
miction of slates rights llgured
Pi fneiiily In the debate In the
limite today on the Mil providing for
the protection nf aliens In the Culled
States In accordance Willi treaties en
tered into Willi foreign powers. The
bill Is designed to relieve the liiited
Stales from what was stated no the
Moor by Mr. sberley or Kentucky to
'the embarassing and often liuuill-
l.'itlng position arising fnuu lis Inabil
ity to malic good the obligations of
Its treaties fur the protection of for
eigners In this country."
The opponents of the meusure prac
tically were a null In contending that
the laws of the several states ware
imple In meet the .situation whenever
it presented Itself. These forces'
were led by Messrs. Henry, Texas, and
Clayton. Mabaina.' Hutches, New Jer
sey, and DeA rmonil, Missouri.
Ill the opinion of Mr. Henry ll was
going too far to "lake a rli't-nitnus
route and confer on aliens, right"
which have not been conferred i il
them by the constitution." The bill
was too radical, lie said.
Mr. Clinton said there was not an
alien In the couuiry who had not al
ready a remedy in case he Is injured
or threatened.
Mr. Sbeiiev took Issue with Mr.
Henry and said there was no lave
granting th" aliens rights superior to
citizens.
After further discussion Ihe bill was
passed 100 to Ml). The vote was so
dose that the speaker ordered a re
capitulation at the suggestion of Mr.
Henry This disclosed that the vole
actually stood loo to inn. The tie was
broken bv the vote of the speaker iu
the iifllrmative which ugaln passed
the bill
Mr. DeArmond challenged the
speaker's vote on the ground that he
had no right to cast It after the vote
had been closed He contended that
the only duty of the speaker In such a.
ase was to announce the result of the
'capitulation.
In an labnrate dccl-dou. supported
by precedents which he read. tln
speaker held that h" had the abso
lute right to vote Riul he declaied
that his vote would stand.
"rum the speaker's decision Mr.
Vrinond appealed but In the nii'iin

On that proposition a roll call was
