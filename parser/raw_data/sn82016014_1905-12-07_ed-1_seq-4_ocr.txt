THE RQOSEVELT BILE.
While the rate regulation measure
that was introduced in the lower house
of congress Wednesday by Congress
man Townsend is said to be the Esch
Townsend bill revised, if. follows so
closely the recommendations and ideas
of President Roosevelt as to be in toto
a Roosevelt bill. It seems to be, and
undoubtedly is, purely an administra
tion measure.
In addition to following closely the
ideas end recommendations of the
president, the new bill supplies the de
tails which the president did not sug
gest in his message, but left to the
judgment of congress to formulate for
itself. The president did not specify
whether the commission to which
should be given the power regulating
rates should be the interstate com
merce commission or some other, but
he insisied that it should be a purely
administrative body. The new bill
gives the power to the interstate com
merce commission, but increases its
membership to seven and makes their
salaries $10,000 a year. This, it
is believed, will be high enough to se
cure the services of the best rate ex
perts in the country, and that is what
the commission needs. The length of
the terms of the members of the com
mission is also increased to seven
years, so that there will not be a con
stant change in the policy of the com
mission. Another feature, perhaps one of the
most important, is the provision for
expediting the business of the commis
sion and deciding controverted rates as
speedily as possible. At present the
commission is sometimes two or three
years in reaching a decision, and if the
railroads desire they can delay the
operation of its findings two or three
years longer by appealing to the
courts, 110 matter how just the findings
may be.
The new bill provides that the com
mission shall investigate rates alleged
to be unjust and render a decision I
within ninety days, and if they estab
lish a new rate, that rate shall become ,
effective within thirty days thereafter.
This would give a shipper relief within
four months from the date of his com
plaint. Provision is made for carrying a
rate into the federal courts, and when
this is done an "expedition court."
composed of three federal judges, shall
hear the appeal as soon as possible.
From their decision appeals can be
carried to the United States supreme
court. But in the meantime tne rate
as fixed by the commission shall re
main in force unless it is enjoined by
the court, and the courts will probably
be extremely careful about enjoining.
ex parte, a rate that a commission of
experts has decided is just and rea
sonable. Among other things the bill provides
against a railroad giving some favored
shipper a tip that a low emergency
rate will be established at a certain
time and allowing that shipper to
make preparations therefore.
JOHN SHARP W1LMA5IS' IDEA.
It is with considerable indignation,
feigned or otherwise, that Congress
man John Sharp Williams, who
marches at the head of the minority in
the lower house of congress, denies
that he is following President Roose
velt in the matter of railroad regula
tion. On the contrary he expresses the
idea that President Roosevelt is follow
ing him.
In other words, the brilliant con
gressman from the sunny south seems
to think that he is heading the pro
cession. Perhaps he is like the cow
catcher. But the cow-catcher, you
know, would never get anywhere were
it not for the force and energy and
power that comes behind it. If it will
give him any satisfaction there will
probably be no objection to consider
ing John Sharp Williams the cow
catcher of the rate regulation move
ment. -

In the Republican state convention of
1003. Mr. Bone was a candidate for at

ita!. What! Does the Capital presume to
say that its great and good friend, Mr.
Coleman, whose administration as at
torney geneial it has so valiantly up
held: whose record as a member of the
board of railroad assessors and the
school fund commission it has found
blameless does the Capital presume to
say that Mr. Coleman was named for
his job by the railroads?
Astounding!
CVLTII1E AT DODGE.
Carry the news to Alfred Henry
Lewis' Whisper it gently to Mr. Bat
Mastei-son! Dodge City, once the
rendezvous of the cow puncher and the
"bad man," Is, by the grace of Andrew
Carnegie, to attain the heights of cul
ture represented by a public library
costing something like ten thousand
dollars.
The pictures of Dodge portrayed by
the exceeding graphic pen of Mr.
Lewis, and the character of its inhab
itants as told in the stories of the
sturdy and strong Mr. Masterson, are
not true of the Dodge of today. During
the stone age Dodge was the ren
dezvous of the plains gambler and the
all-around tough. It was by no means
unusual for its citizens to die with their
boots on. The advocate of culture and
refinement in those days in Dodge
would have exposed himself to ridicule
if not to a rope with a noose in the
business end.
But those days are far gone. Mr.
Lewis and Mr. Masterson are no longer
citizens of Dodge but are residents of
the effete east, the one entertaining
and edifying the American people with
his virile pen or typewriter the oth
er an officer of the law in the nation's
metropolis. Dodge today is quiet and
peaceable. The averag-e intelligence of
its people is probably considerably
above that of the average New Eng
land village of its size. It knows
Shakespeare and economics. The pu
pils in its schools read of the cam
paigns of Caesar's legions and learn
the rules of rhetoric. And how it is to
have a Carnegie library!
Dodge is rearing a citizenship today
that will doubtless be "as great a credit
to it as that which it has sent forth in
the past. Its future citizenship will be
more conventional, and in some ways
it will be less masterful than that of
old. Perhaps we have lost something
of value in the passing of the old
Dodge. But the new Dodge, with its
Carnegie library and its culture away
out where the Short Grass grows, is
something Kansas is truly proud of.

will see that they are paid wages, and
it will introduce modern, enlightened

citizen. Existence will not be so sooth

An African Adventure.
In the World's Work for December
c- B- Schillings tells, in the storv- of
Gun and Camera in African Wilds,"
some thrilling adventures of photo
graphing big game in its native haunts.
Ihe following describes his encounter
with a rhinoceros:
In the course of a year I saw more
than six hundred rhinoceroses and the
tracks of thousands. The sight of
these gigantic beasts standing in the
moonshine on the snow-white steppes
is still vivid in my memory. I have
never encountered more than four at
one time, though I have seen as manv
as eight together. Their appearance
when in a sitting posture is very like
the stump of a tree. While resting,
the rhinoceros often resigns himself to
his feathered friends, who alight upon
his body and serve the double purpose
of freeing his skin from parasites and
giving warning of danger. It is a case
of partnership between an animal with
a keen sense of smell and birds with
keen eyes. The horns of the African
rhinoceros sometimes attain a length
of nearly five feet, and when he lifts
up his voice the whole world seems to
tremble. The sound is so tremendous
that the effect is startling in the ex
treme. Never shall I forget my first en
counter the uncouth animal mass
illuminated by the setting sun, its
mighty horns pointing upward and its
gigantic form outlined against the red
of the evening sky. At a hundred
paces I discharged my elephant gun
and he came snorting toward me; at
my second shot, when he was almost
upon me, he turned in flight, and the
apparent uselessness of my weapon
was so crushing that all previous im
pressions of the rhinoceros were
cha nged.
My greatest risks, however, were in
connection with efforts to photograph
the rhinoceros. The beast is most ac
tive when the sky is cloudy, and it is
difficult to get within range when the
light is favorable. Besides, it is trying
on the nerves (already unsteadied by
malaria) to hold a camera still. How
ever. 1 was successful, and it was a
genuine delight to watch the negatives
develop.
President Jordan's Views oil Football.
"I have liked many things about foot
ball, but the game has been improved
(save the mark) out of all semblance
of sport. It is an abnormallj; special
ized machine, and all spontaneity has
been carefully eliminated by the gentle
men who rule its destinies. Even the
bleachers must be organized after the
machine pattern, with yell leaders who
operate the so-called cheering after the
fashion of the automatic fog-signals in
San Francisco harbor. As a disgruntled
student once remarked to me:
" 'Sometimes I feel like yelling at a
game, and sometimes I don't. And when
I don't feel like it, I've got to open my
mouth and bark because a man waves
his arms at me, or be accused of having
no college spirit.'
"Football has bred many fine and man
ly young men, and it has developed
wholesome and sturdy qualities of man
hood in its day. I do not want to see
it killed by its alleged friends, and I
don't see how an open game will make
it less dangerous to play. But there is
no doubt that the game will kill itself
If left alone, it is doomed unless it can
be simplified and diversified. I cannot
class it as a college sport today. And
because of its arduous complexity, and
the extraordinary demands upon the
minds and bodies of the players, the
professional coach holds a position of
abnormal and demoralizing importance
in campus life. His Influence is often
bad and vicious upon the student
morale because his gospel of thought
and action is 'anything to win.' " From

and College World in The Outing Mag

THE EVENING STOR Y
Tlie Romance of a .Slipper.
(By Virginia Leila Wentz.)
When Miss Graham had finished her
letter and laid her pen down, she
sauntered indolently to the small win
dow and loked across at the pine
woods. (It was one of those country
windows, to open which demands
strength which is as the strength of
ten, and which, when opened, refuse
to be closed again save wiih "the
archaic force of a battering ram.)
"Even though I do live in a Harlem
fiat, pondered Kitty Graham, "l ye j
ui-cii uccuiomea to windows that re
mained up without any visible means
of support. Since I've come to the
Bcrkshires I've learned better. Seems
to me that one volume of Thackeray
doesn't keep the window up high
enough." She gazed searchingly about
the room. "I reckon one of my high
heeled slippers wil! about do it," and
she inserted a bit of personal prop
erty with no mean skill, so that the
heel raised the sash two or three
inches higher.
"That isn't much," she concluded, a
trifle warm with the exertion, "but it's
something. And how delicious that
pine fragrance is!" She bent her
pretty head so that her little nose
drew in long breaths of the sweet air:
then picking up her letter she went
down stairs.
"Mrs. Barnes," came Miss Graham's
silvery voice from the hall, "shall I
leave my letter here on the table! Or
is it too late for the butcher?"
"Sakes alive' yes. He was here 'fore
you was up," returned Mrs. Barnes
cheerfully, from her rocking chair 011
the front piazza. "But maybe there'll
be somebody along presently on their
way to North Adams. You might stick
it in the railing 111 case anybody does
come." she added.
Kitty sauntered to the fence and
leaned over the railing. But no one
was in sight.
"Suppose I walk over to North
Adams myself." suggested she. "Is it
far?" She tapped the belated en
velope against her small white teeth.
"Land, yes, child! It's "
The gate of the "other house"
creaked as it was pulled open. They
could always hear that gate creak.
Mrs. Barnes stopped rocking and look
ed up the road.
"Here comes Professor Thornton." she
said placidly. "But, of course, we
couldn't ask him."
"H'm!" murmured Kitty absently,
"why not?"
The professor was a tall, aristocratic
looking man of middle age. As he ap
proached, followed by a handsome col
lie, Kitty went to the ?rate and held out
her letter with a frank, winning smile:
' If you're going to the village would
you mind mailing this for me?" said
she gravely. "I should be very much
obliged.
Mrs. Barnes, from the rocker on the
piazza, looked at the girl with mild re
proach, but met no glance of apology.
Kitty's wide gray eyes were following
Professor. Thornton's aristocratic fig
ure down the road, and evolving dome
questions. She turned abruptly:
"Who is he? Why did you hesitate
about asking him? Don't you think
he'll mail it all right? It's to mother
and it's very important, and you don't
think he'll drop it, do you?"
And what Mis. Barnes theiupon told
her was. in substance, if not in words,
something like this:
He was Professor Hamilton Thornton,
of New York city, serving, as his mis
tress. Star-eyed Science. But of Woman
(with a capital W) and her Ways (an
other capital W) he was totally igno
rant. The iciest of iced water was
warm so rumor had it to the look he
bestowed upon women.
"And how ever you braced up spunk
enough to ask him to mail that letter."
concluded Mrs. Barnes, rocking way
back, "I don't know."
"Ho! hum!" yawned Kitty. "Well,
the woods for mine," and with a no J of
farewell she passed out of the gate.
Over the slippery needles rhe went
till she reached a tall tree whose shaft
went straight up, not bothering itself
with branches for thirty feet. Hire she
threw herself down and leaned back in
the embracing roots, pitying the people
in towns, and heaving a sigh of satrs
fact ion.
"If only dear mother could be with
me, though." said she mentally. "But
of course, it's impossible. Oh, this
povertv-stricken. worn-a-day world!"
She couldn't help thinking of the pretty
little estate in Virginia which yielded
nothing, and of the subsequent hard
shins which she and her frail, delicate
mother were enduring.
"Well, the doctor said if I'd stop
fretting and would try to enjoy every
moment of mv month here in these
fragrant hills, I'd be "U right for my
winter work. So I'm only going to
think of pleasure, and and Dracing
things." And while the resinous bark
gave f 01 tli its spicy smell, reclining
against the roots of the pine tree, she
lazilv watched the small and active In
sects which went pottering about the
needles and moss and soft earth.
"Oh it's delicious, and"Vestful so
restful!" sighed she, stretching her
arms above her head. ,.,,. ,,
That night, instead of lighting her
bed room candle, she went to the win
dow through whose uncurtained frame
the moonlight poured in 11 "s1''!
upheld bv the volume of Thackeray
and bv the high-heeled slipper. The
Octobe'r night air was quite chilly, there
was too much of it. Kitty thought,
while she was getting ready for bed
she'd close it from below, and profit
a"olWs?aying the sash with her right
shoulder, shf tried to extricate the slip
per and 'the book. But, a as! the slip
per eluded her and tumbled heel fiist
into the path below.
Kitty's first thought was to run and
fetch it back. But she was utterly
sleenv "Oh, phaw!" yawned she,
"what's the use? PU get it. in the morn
ing It isn't going to rain; the s
cram full of stars."
The next morning very early, Hnce

master, waving nis mu j ----
something at his teet
Then,

Pro?ess"fr Thornton looked at the
thing which Prince had deposited at his
tie feet women must have! Be -.t tM

PaHe:d seen things like this-hadn't
he'l-on blocks in shop windows? No,
not precisely like this, either . For this
had little curves a dozen of them
of individuality. Pretty little thing
but what nonsense for a shoe
He hesitated a second; then softlj
opened the top right-hand drawer of
his desk. "Mavbe some one will call
for it," thought he. "then I'll be sure to
know where it is."
He thought of this drawer several
times during the day. but did not open
it It was queer no one missed it.
That night, however, he set the tiny
finnr.ine his tawny
length
upon the
thinir un on his big mue uiouer. it
shone under the student lamp in shim
mering daintiness so sort, so sraootn
with such curves' Why, it looked al
most warm.
The professor leaned back in 1.1s re
volving chair and looked around his
room dim save for the desk's circling
light. The room seemed empty in spite
of its furnishings. Great cases of books,
rugs, antlers, a favorite gun and a gen
erous pipe-rack and in the midst of a
circle of light, a lonely man and a
suede slipper.
Yes. the professor felt lonely. He
picked up the slipper, turning it over
and over. Suddenly he cried; -
"Why, there's K. G. just as plain,
right on the lining. In silver letters!"
Prince sniffed at this illuminating dis
covery. Next day, as the profesor was pass
Mrs. Barnes' place, he saw a dainty
little figure in white at the gate. She
raised her lovely tired eves hi recogni
tion. .
"Would you mind inquiring for mv

Kitty Graham."
"Miss Graham Kitty Graham," re
peated he gravely, with a courtly bow.
then he stopped short, and regarded
the girl with absorption, a wonder
growing in his eyes. "Miss Graham,"
said he, "do you ever wear slippers''"
"What a question to ask a girl'"
laughed Kitty, some weeks later "nd
what an amusing way to begin a 'court
ship. (Copyright, 1903, by E. C. Parcells.)
