THE xortTinvEST CONSPIRACY.
The promised publication of the papers
relating to the "Northwestern conspiracy
created consternation among _ number of
prominent politicians and their friends, in
anticipation of a revelation which would
materially injure, if not totally destroy.
their future political prospects. Steps were
immediately taken to suppress the publica
tion of these papers, while, on account of the
public appetite being whetted by the efforts
to suppress them, the magazines andjmetro
politan newspapers redoubled their efforts
to secure them for publication. As weeks
and months passed by and the papers were
not forthcoming, the public settled down
into the conviction that they were to be
forever suppressed. It is an agree
able surprise, therefore, to find the
first chapter of the history of the
Northwestern conspiracy appearing in
the current number of the Southern Bivouac
with the promise of that journal that the
publication will be continued from month to
mouth until the whole series is laid before
the public eye. The preparation of the pa
pers is in competent hands. They are
edited by Judge Thomas 11. Hikes, of
Bowl ing Green, and Hon. Jonx B. Castle
max. of Louisville, who were active partici
pants in the conspiracy and, of course,
know all the inside history of it. Judge
Hikes was a rebel cavalry officer who
served on the staff of Gen. Jonx H. Moß
gak, the noted partisan leader. It was
Capt. Hikes who planned Mokgak's es
cape from the Ohio penitentiary, aud in
consideration of his valuable services as
scout and spy, he was selected by
the Confederate government at Rich
mond for special service in organ
izing the conspiracy In the Northwest.
Very little of the details of the conspiracy
are detailed in the first chapter. It is
mainly devoted to an explanation of the
causes which induced the Confederate
government to inaugurate such a move
ment. The gloomy outlook for the Con
federacy after the battle of Gettysburg and
the fall of Vicksburg impressed the rebe
authorities with the necessity for drawing
upon new ! resources in order to keep the
rebellion on its feet. The refusal of the
Federal government to exchange prisoners
of war had reduced the Confederates to still
greater straits. All the white men in the .
South capable of bearing arms had already
been conscripted into the army. There was
no way to recruit the depleted rebel ranks.
The only way to till the thinned ranks
was by recovering from the Nerthern
prisons the veteran \ soldiers with which
they were crowded. It was accord
ingly suggested that a movement
should be Inaugurated for that pur
pose, and as such a movement had to be
organized inside the Union lines. it re
quired tact and secrecy to accomplish it
At the same time it was represented to the
Richmond authorities that a feeling of dis
content bordering on outright mutiny and
rebellion against the Likcolk administra
tion prevailed in many of the Northern
states, on account of negro emancipation,
the drafts and the prolonged prosecution of
the war. The Richmond government de
termined to utilize this disaffection, if pos
sible. Accordingly, in March, ISG4, an
order was issued by the Confederate war
department detailing Capt. T. H. Hikes
to take charge of this special service. The
object of the undertaking, as defined by
the Confederate secretary of war, in his
letter of instruction to Capt Hikes, was
"to proceed to Canada, passing through the
United States under such character and in
such mode as you may deem most safe, for
the purpose of collecting there the men of
Gen. Morgan's command who may have
escaped, and others of the citizens of the
Confederacy, and arranging for their return
either through the United Stales or by sea."
Hikes is next instructed to place him
self in communication with Hon. James P.
Holcombe, who had been sent as special
commissioner to the British provinces, and
in his instructions directed to facilitate the
passage of men to the Confederacy. The
Confederate secretary then proceeds to tell
Capt. Hikes that in passing through the
United States it will be his duty to confer
with the leading persons, friendly or at
tached to the Confederacy, or who may be
advocates of peace, and to do all in bis
power to induce these people to organize
and prepare themselves to render such aid
as circumstances may allow. Under the
general authority thus conferred the ar
ranging of details were left to the discretion
and sagacity of the special agent, "to be
carried out as exigencies may dic
tate," Gen. Polk was directed to
transfer 200 bales of cotton to Mem
phis, from the sale of which Capt.
Hikes was to be provided with a fund on
which to draw for the purposes of his mis
sion. On the 27th of April. 1864, an order
was signed by Jefferson Davis appoint
ing Clemekt C. Clay, of Alabama,
James P. Holcombe, of Virginia, and
Jacob Thompson*, of Mississippi, com
missioners to proceed" to Canada, there to
carry out the instructions received from Mr.
Davis verbally "in such manner as would
seem most likely to conduce to the further
ance of the interests of the Confederate
States." The tirst chapter of this hereto
fore unwritten war reminiscence concludes
with the departure of the rebel commis
sioners from Wilmington. N. C, on board
of a blockade runner, of their pursuit by
the Un ted States war steamer Connecticut,
and of the narrow escape by reason of the
Connecticut's machinery failing. The sue- ;
cessive chapters, which will give in de- !
tail all that was done by Hikes and the i
commissioners, will be awaited with un- j
usual interest, a? this really promises to be j
the most entertaining scrap of war litera- j
ture that hat- yet appeared.
Capt. Hikes state., however, in an In- j
troductory letter, that a number of politi- |
cians in the Northwest who were concerned I
in the matter, will rather be benefited than j
injured by the statement of plain facts.
He thinks that time has so softened the !
asperities of the war that the good common
sense of the people is able now to appre
ciate and understand the motirss and pur
poses of the men who were concerned in I
this movement.
RIDICULOUS CIIITHC--MEN.
It will be remembered that ! the Apostle
Paul once rebuked the people of a, city, |
whither he had gone to preach, because |
their principal occupation seemed to be to I
gather on the street corners in search of !
something new. The Apos'.le Path, is j
badly needed in Philadelphia religious cir« !
cles just at this time. The Philadelphia
papers are discussing the peculiar jealous
ies and rivalries which exist between the j
congregations of two of the most fashion- j
able churches in that city. It is a peculi
arity of Philadelphia church-going people j
to want a sensation, and in consequence ;
the pulpit that can present the newest at- j
traction attracts the largest congregations. ;
Recently the church officials of one of the j
rival fashionable churches gave the rector ,
a vacation. ai.i he started off on a journey
to Palestine. As soon as the officers of the |
other church heard of it they at once con- J
eluded that it would never do to have the j
rival rector return with a budget of stories
about the holy land, as it would be a drawing •
advertisement. So they posted their pastor j
off in full ha^te with ructions to J
tarry not by the way, but to use every
effort to head his clerical competitor off and
get into the Holy City first Now it is a
nip and tuck race between the clergymen as
to which will finish the tour of Judea i
first and get back home to relate his experi- >
ence. In the meantime the rival congrega- )
tions are holding daily caucuses, appoint
ing committees and raising and forwarding
large sums of . money to their respective
shepherds to meet traveling expenses. All
Philadelphia society is in an uproar over it.
And yet the heathens are unconverted and
women aud children are dying in Phila
delphia from cold and . hunger. It is no
wonder that religious work makes slow
progress when religious people are guilty of
such ridiculous conduct. The Apostle
Paul is needed back here on earth, and
needed badly.
BLAINE AND LOGAN.
"Me and Jack" are out. The Washing
ton correspondent of the New York World
says that although Mr. Blame and Gen.
Logan were in Washington a few days
ago and both stopped at the same hotel,
neither of the distinguished Republican
leaders called on the other. This remarka
ble circumstance could only be accounted
lor upon the ground that a coolness has
sprung up between them. Coloring is
given to this view of it by the fact that all
of Gen. Logan's personal friends in Wash
ington take Mr. Edmunds' side in their
talk over the recent Blame-Edmunds epi
sode in New York. It is given out that
Edmunds looks kindly on Logan's aspir
ations. It is also stated that Mr. Blaink
has signified a partiality for Senator Alli
son, and in case he cannot win the nomi
nation in ISSB. it is thought his influence
will go to the lowa senator. But whatever
may be the result in 188S, from present in
dications it is safe to assert that the Re
publican ticket will not be Blame and
Logan again. The firm has dissolved
oartnership.

WIPE IT OUT.
Now that congress Is about to resume I
work at the old staud, It may not be out |
of place to call the attention of the senate
to the fact that the popular demand for the
abolition of that travesty on free govern
ment known as the executive session, is
just as strong as it was last, winter. Star
chamber proceedings are not suited to our
institutions. And, more than that, the
secret sessions of the senate are really the
hot-beds of the bulk of congressional cor
ruption. It is time that the infamy should
be wiped out. And. to make sure that it
shall be done in the near future, it would
be a good idea for the several state legisla
tures to adopt resolutions requesting the
senators to vote to abolish executive ses
sions. If the senators refused to obey the
instructions it would be at their peril.
MOURNING STALWARTS.
The New York Stalwarts are said to be
in despair because they have no Moses.
Since Conkling' retirement and Ar
thur's death they have uo leader. There
is no man among them who has the ability
to plan, or the strength to combine men to
gether to carry out a plan. It is a lamenta
ble state of affairs for the Stalwarts, but a
most wholesome condition for the country.
The New York Stalwarts are largely re
sponsible for the free use of the machiue
in American politics. Roscoe _o.v__ixr»'s
imperious leadership had a demoralizing
effect, in that it stifled independence in po
litical affairs. Conkling was free from
the suspicion of corruption, jet he was a
more dangerous man to our institutions
than other leaders who were notor.ously
corrupt It Is possible that Conkling may
be recalled to resume his former suprem
acy over the Stalwarts, but he will never
lead them to victory again. The days of
Stalwartism are numbered.
m
QUAIL EATING.
A Minneapolis man 13 down at Chicago
trying to earn a thousand dollars by eating
one quail a day for thirty consecutive days.
There is nothing more toothsome than a
nicely broiled quail, and the average epicure
cannot understand why an individual should
not eat one every day in the year. Wagers
have been made and lost from time im
memorial on the ability of the human
stomach to digest thirty quails in the space
of one month. There are only three in
stances on record where the gastronomic
feat has been accomplished. After the fif
teenth or twentieth meal of quail diets the
stomach rebels against it and will not longer
accept the delicate bird as legal tender.
Therefore the quail -eating contest now in
progress will be watched with interest. It
Is observable that bets are largely in favor
of the Minneapolis epicure. If any man
can eat thirty quails, it is safe to bet on a
Minuesotian. ..*.;

TOO SHAKY*
ft would not be safe to take the recent
boom in mining stocks as evidence of a tide
of prosperity that , is about to sweep over
the country. It is encouraging, to be sure.
to observe a rapid advance in any sort of
stocks, but as a rule these inflations in
stock values are more the result of shrewd
manipulations op the part of speculators
than from legitimate business prosperity.
A steady conservative increase in values is
evidence of general prosperous conditions,
but it will not do to rely on sudden spurts.
There is too much of the wild-cat dodge
about them.
C__T_anjs, the young Virginian who is

Had England no worse foes than Rossa, sbe
would be fortunate indeed.

Flower Men.
Flower- Fashionable for Varied So

A Heturn, From Following the False
Gods of Aesthetlclsin, Duck
to the Beautiful.
ASH ION has no firmer
hold on anything dear to
woman than the flowers she
years, and the arrangement
of her hair is not more a
matter of style than the
color and position of her
bouquet. Not only does
tho tickle goddess determine
what blossoms shall adorn
the person of my — she
also proclaims what shall
be used for her teas and
inceptions. There was a
time when the good dame
of Minneapolis and St. Paul each iiad in her
sunny window an assortment of geraniums;
happy was she who cou'd coax her pets to
bloom in the winter, and her daughter was
the envied possessor of the only natural
flowers at party or ball. But we have
passed the geranium stage, and may now
be said to be quite within the domain of
the flower dealer, who is an exponent, in
no small degree, of the luxurious refine
ment of the city where he dwells.
An afternoon among the flower dealers
of Minneapolis showed that a bouquet is
now an almost indispensable adjunct not
only of le grande toilette, but also of visit
ing, opera and afternoon costumes; and no
party is at all complete unless tables and
mantel are enriched with a wealth of na
ture's beauties.
At this season of the year the green
houses are fairly ablaze with gorgeous
Chrysanthemums. These are old favorites
of our great gradmother's time, but in the
large quilled Japanese sorts, white, cream,
yellow bronze, pink and red, the old lady
would scarcely recognize the plants that
bordered her kitchen garden. No flower
has reached such a remarkable development
in so short a time as has the chrysanthe
mum, and none is more worthy its great
popularity. Its blossoms appear at a time
when all other plauts are resting; its flow
ers last a long time and cut well, and it is
a prof use bloomer. In these days of "yel
low teas" the brilliant color of this autumn
favorite gladdens the heart of the enter
tainer and brightens her tea table and parlor
withal. It will never become so popular
lor the cordage, as it has not the graceful
habit of the rose; and besides, as one dealer
remarked, "it is too cheap" — a fact which
men will fail to appreciate, but which is
the very best reason a woman
could have for discarding it. The
large Japanese rose jars that
are now so much used for parlor decoration,
are never more effective than when filled
with great quilled chrysanthemums of one
color. Corsage bouquets grow larger with
the years, a few seasons ago it was the
proper thing for the fashionable girl to
wear a single rose in the bosom of her
gown, possibly as an index of the beautiful
simplicity of the feminine character, but
j either the feminine character has become
j wonderfully complex, or for no other rea
son than fashion's decree, maid and matron
now vie with each other in seeing who can
show the broadest expanse of buds — for
rose buds are pre-eminently the flowers for
the purpose. A corsage bouquet, to be at
all up to the times, must contain at least
two dozen large buds, the stems left long
ar.d foliage retained, and the more careless
and natural the arrangement the better.
If this thing keeps on we shall soon see
conservatories surmounted by a more or
less bewitching pair of eyes, and built on a
foundation of velvet, tulle or silk,
floating through our reception and
ball-rooms. In some few instances the ex
treme might be desirable, but most men
will sigh for the time when simplicity shall
again rule; this is particularly true of the
society girl's best fellow, and he will realize
it most as he deposits a $5 gold piece ou the
counter of the flower man, in payment for
the "perfectly lovely" roses behind which
his mistress intrenches herself.
It is not only the daughter of wealth,
however, who appreciates blossoms— the
innocent beauties are dear to all hearts and
are worn by all women. She who cannot
afford the aristocratic rose is happy in the
possess.on of the botirgeoise chrysanthemum
or the plebeian geranium— and the size and
make-up of her corsage bouquet may be
taken as a measure of the feminine purse.
And what custom of recent years has a
more sensible foundation or a more benefi
cent effect than this? Who cannot remem
ber the time when feathers or large gold
jewelry or horrible artificial flowers were,
the only articles of dress embellishment;
and who that remembers does
not prefer the fresh posies, with
their delicate tints and fresh
perfume, suggestive of all that is sweet and
pure in nature? The flowers have come
into our homes as well— at dinner parties
the center piece is no longer fruit alone,
brilliant poiuseuias, camel las, hyacinths,
accent its beauty, while trailing suiilax
droops from the chandelier above. Banks
of carnations, with their spicy fragrance,
hide the mantels, aud bear on their snowy
crests the date or name which makes the
occasion memorable. Great cornucopias
overflow with a wealth of bloom and vine;
balls hung in arch and doorway* suggest a
round of life and happiness; Cupid bow
or marriage bell o'ershadows the fair bride
and tells of love: horse, shoes and wishbones
speak of the kind hopes of friends— indeed,
there is no message that flowers cannot
speak in these days, when their own mean
ing is combined with man's ingenuity.
These are sentiments for the guests—
any rate, when the festive flower man sends
in his account next day, paterfamilias
ceases to muse on beauty, and his brow
contracts— and palms and ferns are
all very beautiful under the bright gas
light, but to-day where is the « 7 .0 value
in the mass of wilted, withered things that
last night was the admired cornucopia?
The palms and ferns have returned to the
green house, and the only reminder of
their presence is this good-sized item on the
plumber-like bill, and what <vii.ii can be
expected to be an enthusiastic supporter of
tue aesthetics as ento.) lied m -oral decora
tion at 575 a decorate? One might as well
contemplate a perennial season of spring
bonnets!
And then this mercenary man bethinks
him of the pleasure that beamed from his
dear wife's eyes as her guests complimented
her on the excellent taste she displayed in
choosing her flowers, and albeit he knows
| that the taste aforesaid could be duplicated
by the most prosaic of them all for an equal
investment, he pays the bill and thus the
flower trade is prospered.
A few years since, after the advent of
Oscar Wild*, the aesthetic daisy, with its
j single row of white rays around its tawny
■ center, was the ruler of the hour— nothing
| but what was conventional was "good
I form." The hyacinth was left
to bloom unseen. and the violet
hid her modest .head— even the
great queen of flowerdom was ignored by

To th© Editor of the Globe. .
Minneapolis, Dec. 5. — Please allow me |
i space for a few words concerning the fail- |
tire of A. P. Martin & Co., of Boston, j
Mass. The reason assigned is that the !
Knights of Labor had made unreasonable j
demands of said linn, which demands, hay
, ing been granted, threw the firm into bank- !
ruptey. The average weekly wages of
boot and shoe employes in Massachusetts
was (in 1883) 59.73, or 8505.96 yearly; {
Supposing the boot and shoe workers asked
i for and received and increase ot 10 per
cent, their yearly Income would then be '.
8556.55. We lind that the total average j
earnings of a mechanic's family (of rive ■
workers) is £803.47; total expense for liv
ing. $754,42; balance. 849.05—849.05 to
' buy luxuries, pay doctor bills, and for
1 charitable purposes, etc. It must cost the
1 boot and shoe employes as much to live as
• the mechanics. But they have not so
much pay by 8397.51, How do they get
i along? Now. if Martin & Co. are honor
' able men let th.mi acknowledge that they
have been bankrupted by many different
; causes, a few of which 1 will name.
First, by havi i_ to maintain too high liv
ing, in order t > rank as one of the elite of
Boston. Seco id, by having too pay too
high freight, to "pooled" railroads. Third,
by the laboringmen of America not being
protected against foreign contract labor,
which has forced the laborer's wages so
low that many cannot buy boots and shoes,
and only have some old cast-off tilings given
by some charitable institution; which, state
of affairs causes an under-consumption of
boots and shoes. Fourth, by having to
compete with states prison goods. Fifth,
ex-mayor! (That sounds like politics!) Mr.
Mai tin must have indulged in a campaign
or two, and. of course, had to chip in his
assessment — the same as the politicians in
Minneapolis have had to do. Workingmen
should be forced either to live on nothing
and work grans or commit suicide.

Of the twenty presidents who have passed
away. Gen. Arthur is only the fourth to be
buried within the borders of the Empire
state. James Monroe died at his daughter's
house in New York city, and was buried
with civic and military honors in the old
cemetery on Second avenue. His grave
was unmarked by a monument for several
years, and then the legislature of Virginia
had his remains disinterred and con
veyed to Richmond, where they were
afterward buried in Hollywood cemetery.
Martin Van Buren, the eighth president,
was bnried in the old church burying
ground at Kinderhook, and was the first of
the nation's chief magistrates to lind a per
manent resting place in New York. A
handsome granite shaft, erected by his
sons, marks his grave. Millard Fillmore's
grave is beside those of his two wives and
and daughters iv Forest Lawn cemetery.
Buffalo. The remains of Gen. . Grant,
whose funeral was . the most im
posing ever seen in the United
.States, lie in a splendid tomb at
ltiverside. and Gen. Arthur's body was in
terred in Rural cemetery, near Albany.
In point of age. Gen. Arthur was the sixth
youngest of the presidents. Gen. Grant
attained the dignity of chief magistrate at
the age of 47. Franklin Pierce was next
youngest, being 48 years old at the time of [
the inauguration. James K. Polk was
only 49 when lie attained presidential
honors. Garfield was inaugurated in his 49th J
year. When called to the noblest position
known to the American form of govern- J
ment Gen. Arthur had just turned 59.
President Cleveland was made chief ruler
at the age of 47. Gen. Arthur was the
tirst of the presidents who wore side-whisk- '
era None of the other presidents wore
any hair on their faces until Abraham Lin- '
coin's time, and Grant, Hayes and Garfield
were the only ones who had full beards. '
Presicent Cleveland is the first and only '
president who has worn a mustache only.
Gen. Arthur Was regarded as the best i
dressed of the nation's presidents. ■ - In '<
the matter of wealth. Gen.
Arthur comes about fourth on
the list. Washington died worth about
$350,000; Madison left at his death some
thing like 7 -60,000, and Van Buren. estate
was valued at $300,000. Jefferson was
wealthy when he became president but
died insolvent, as did also James Monroe.
Buchanan had about 8200.000 when he
died, while Lincoln left less than 8100,000.
Grant was ruined by the failure of Grant &
Ward. The sale of his memoirs, however,
has netted his widow half a million. The
estate left by President Garfield was not
worth more than -40,000. Numerous gifts
made to his widow have increased this*
amount tenfold.

Joseph Leighton and wife, of Miles City,
Montana, are stopping at the Palace hotel.
Mr. Leighton is one of the best known men
in Montana territory, among its wealth
iest He went there early and put money
in mines and cattle, and later on. in com
pany with a Mr. Jordan, put a line of
steamboats on the Missouri river, running
them up to Fort Benton, the head of navi
gation. The enterprise brought big returns,
and now he counts his wealth by the hun
dred thousands, estimating itat 51. 000.000.
Mr. Leighton. Gov. llouser. Delegate Ma
ginnis and Granville Stuart the most no
table In this portion of the country, are old
timers. They ail dealt in cattle, and were
making thousands, when newcomers rushed
in and hone and cattle thieves became
abundant These old-timers organized
a vigilance committee and strung
men up by the dozen. Gran
ville Stuart, who is also a millionaire, is <
yet president of the committee, and is cred
ited with passing judgment of death on
thirty-five stock thieves during 1885. These :
pioneers had their annual banquet about a '
month ago. when many exciting instances '
were discussed. One incident was very
curious. The vigilance committee was on ;
the trail of a half-breed, who had been :
committing depredations in stock. The
noose in the lariat was already tied, and the
men were all thirsty for the robber's blood. '
About sundown one day they came across
a man who was the ideal picture of a half
breed. His face was very dark and very
dirty, and his long coarse hair hung in '<
lavish abandonment over his shoulders.
IHe was driving some horses when '
lhe was commanded to halt, and the ;
} man with the lariat tossed it about i
j the half-breed's neck. They accused him i
iof beinir the thief, and were making tor the !
nearest tree. The man mad. a piteous plea
for his life, and assured them he was not ■ '
half-breed, but a full blooded Englishman. '
A Britisher who wan foremost among the
vigilantes thought he would, as a matter of
form, ask him a few questions. He asked
the seem ng half-breed what part of Eng
-1 land he came from. The answer was Lon
i don, and the university he attendod was ]
I Oxford. The wild man's Interrogator then
j asked him to repeat something lie had '
| learned there. The thoroughly frightened |
man repeated something of Virgil's __ueid .
' in Latin, and the Britisher threw up his j (
1 hat, hied off his revolver and disengaged (
1 his captor from the lariat They had a | ,
• good laugh over the matter afterward, and [ j
the Englishman who came so near being |
ushered into eternity is now more careful ,
in caring for his pers -mil nmwtranea. ,

' Mlnneapolilans Who Smoke Fra
[ grant Tobacco In the Court house. .
; Peculiarities in the Line of Choice of
the Weed and the i'ipe.
Did you ever watch the pale blue smoke
j of a choice cigar curl gracef illy toward the
| ceiling and draw on your imagination for
j pictures to lit the occasion? If not, you '
I have missed much of this world's pleasures,
providing you are a smoker. Tobacco acts
I iii different ways. To some it is a stimu
! lant, while to others it acts as a soother, and
i under its benign influence many persons
t have been known to do kind deeds without
; number. This refers only to tobacco smoke.
: and not to ei-nretfe smoke, for if any one
; caned a kind act while smoking one of
| those vile things, all he needs to do in or
| der to make a good living is to set himself
jupas a curiosity. At the Hennepin court
i house there are employed a number of gen
tlemen who sometimes indulge in the fra
grant weed, but let it be said to the credit
of the county that there are no cigarette
smokers among them.
Jud_e Rea is partial to a dark-colored
cigar, and while not on the beneb can be
found with a fragant Havana between his
.ips. He is not on- of those persons who
smokes just to see now many rolls of to
bacco he can consume in a given time; he
meditates or talks as he smokes and smiles
pleasantly as he sends blue clouds above his
Head.
Judge Lochren prefers a pipe to a cigar
when sitting in his private office, and it is
seldom indeed mat a visitor finds him with
out a big, higuly-colored meerschaum pipe in
his mouth. The kind of tobacco he smokes
he is particular about, and his room is al
ways fragrant with the fumes of "Dur
ham" ,or "Old Judge." Under the influ
ence of his pipe the judge relaxes to a con
siderable extent, and then talks politics or
religion with equal calmness.
Judge Yo ng nev.r smokes, but he has
no objection to any one Bin-king in his
presence, so long as it is not in the court
room and the cigar is a good one. Ed J.
Davenport, clerk of the court, is another
who never smokes. It is said that in his
early boyhood he tried it but after turning
himself nearly inside out to get rid of the j
suio c he swallowed gave it up.
Capt. C. B. Tirrel, deputy clerk, enjoys
a good cigar, and keeps a well- filled meer
schaum pipe and a small box of fine tobacco
constantly in his desk. He holds his pipe
as though it were going to slip away from
him. It is seldom, however, that he "tires
up" during office hours.
Clerk Dickey is a steadfast devotee of the
weed, and when not engaged in handling
court records or making out papers can be
seen puffing away on a 10 or 15 center.
Nothing is too good for him, and it's a
pleasure to see him smoke. There was a
time, long ago, when Mr. Dickey smoked
cigarettes, but this demoralizing practice he
has given up. He can teil a cigarette
smoker as soon as he comes into the room,
though.
George Tirrell. since he became of age,
sometimes indulges in a cigar. These oc
casions are rare, however, for he claims
that tobacco is harmful and causes weak
ness of the memory.
Deputy Clerk Altuow has a weakness for
light-colored cigars, good or bad, but for
some reason does not smoke as much as
formerly.
Sheriff Brackett smokes nearly all the
time, but the chances are about equal be
tween the cigar being lighted and unlighteii
Sometimes he smokes good ones, and some
times those of a cheaper grade. He has
never been known, however, to buy a poor
cigar. All those are presented to him.
Deputy Sheriff James Ege will smoke
any kind of a cigar that is offered him, but
When he invests he gets three for a quarter.
He is a nervous smoker, aud often meets
the fire half way; then he starts on a new
one and repeats the operation.
Deputy Sheriff Doran never refuses any
cigar that will draw. He enjoys anything
that will burn, but draws the line at pieces
of tarred rope, made to resemble genuine
Cab Bage de Le Ayes. In this respect Mr.
Doran resembles Deputy Sheriff Lou Ship
ley. Lou will smoke most anything except
a short clay pipe.
But Deputy Sheriff George Baxter is the
wonder of the sheriff's office. George will
hold up his best friend and go through bis
pockets with a dxeterity that comes only
from long practice. One corner of his sun
kissed mustache is always s nged. and he
declares that he will never again smoke !
short cigars. George "held up" a news
paper reporter a few days ago and found
what he thought was an elegant cigar. It
had been loaded, though, and now George
says an unfair advantage was taken of his
confiding nature.
County Superintendent of Schools Wraa
man is an inveterate smoker and whenever
he meets a friend always asks for a cigar,
He has even been known to ask a news
paper reporter for one, but it is not known
whether he got it or not The kind is im
material to him.
Judge of Probate Ueland smokes a fairly
good cigar, but holds it in his mouth as
though he were afraid it would burn. When
smoking be generally elevates his feet on a
chair or desk, and but for his manner of
holding the bit of burning tobacco would
form a perfect picture of contentment
A. M. Scott, clerk of probate, holds his
10-cent cigar in bis mouth on an angle of
about 45K degrees. This gives him a very
"tough" look, which greatly belies the gen
tleman, for. when smoking, he is as pleas
ant as a June morning. He always buys
his own cigars. and they are generally good
ones, too.
George Huhn, register of deeds, is one « f
the most dainty smokers at the court house,
and gazes at the cigar as a fond mother
would at her first babe. During office
hours he is never seen with a cigar in his
mouth, that is. not a lighted one. There
ate generally half a dozen empty cigar
boxes lying on his desk.
Deputy Plummer smokes nearly * all the
time and don't care whether his cigars cost
5 cents or 50 cents. He was never known
to refuse one, and as for giving one away,
well, he owes the writer one now. He won
several boxes on the recent election, and
treated the whole office.
County Treasurer Matt Walsh is not a
man who smokes a great deal, but when he
does he wants the cigar to be a good one.
He is very generous and makes glad many
a weary heart that is longing for a smoke.
County Auditor McDonald smokes con
siderably, and does not care so much for
the quality as one would suppose. He gen
erally throws his cigar away when half fin
ished, having too much to do to remain
still until it is smoked out. He don't enjoy
it as his deputy, Mr. Condit does. It is
seldom that Mr. Condit uses the weed, but i
when he does he wants a ciear, hand-made,
dark cigar, one that win not bum too fast;
in fact he wants it perfection itself.

Brooklyn Mairazine. i
All weddings' in Turkey, among Turks, ]
whether in provinces or cities, are arranged ! <
by old women, afid are complicated, tedious ■ l
affairs. The bridegroom holds fete several ! '
days at his home for his men friends, and j
the prospective bride at her home with her |
young friends— girls, of course. The night j
before the wedding the married women of j '
her acquaintance come and eat the married i I
woman's dinner with her, which consists j '
principally, as Sam Weller would say. of a ' !
"swarry" of leg of mutton and trimmings, j I
The next day the bride is taken to the ■ :
bridegroom's house in a sedan chair, with a
retinue of slaves carrying her wedding i
presents on trays on their heads, covered '
with colored tarlatan. The procession is I
sometimes quite imposing. The . bride's
female' relatives are also there in the new '
harem until nightfall, and they retire to 1
their homes, leaving the bride sitting on a
sort of throne, veiled. The bridegroom is I
then admitted, and he is to throw himself i
at the bride's feet and offer her his wedding
present of s«_ue handsome jewelry, and i
beg her to raise her veil and strike him i
blind by her beauty. Sometimes he is i
struck dumb by her ugliness, for he never ;
looks on her face until after the wedding, i
When a baby is ■ born in any house theie
is great rejo'rir.g if it b ■■ a boy, less if a
girl. The wife is proud for a while, but '-
Turkish women are not go.v mothers.
They are too childlike themselves. When
a girl is born to a sultan they .fire seven!
guns; when a boy. twenty- one. . The boyst
die early; the girls are apt to live. This is *
supposed to be a divine interposition of
Providence to prevent, too many claimants
to the throne. Babies are dressed like
mummies in • swaddling clothes for six
months; th en the boys are put in trousers,
some in generals' or colonels' unifoims, reg
ularly made. .
When the sultan takes a wife no cere
mony is considered necessary more than to
present his bride. The, new sultan inherits
all the widows and slaves of his prede
cessor, and every year of his reign, at the
least of the Kamazau. he receives a new
one from his mother, and takes any other
girl or woman to his harem who happens to
strike his fancy. Slaves who become
mothers are instantly promoted to the rank
of sultana. Six months before the feast of
Ramazau. the valide sultana orders that all
the young candidates be brought to her,
and she chooses fifteen and sometimes
more of the lot. These are immediately
put under diet and training, and
at the beginning of the great feast
she again chooses, and this time
the choice is final. At the evening of the
appointed day the sultan, upon retiring,
finds his new bride standing nude, with
folded hands and lowered eyes, at the foot
of his bed. After he has retired she must
lift the bed clothes at the foot and crawl
into bed in that way as a sign of subjec
tion. ". /;
Girls arrive at legal majority at 9 years of
age, and are frequently married at 10.
Children of I', and IS are often seen with
babies of their own. They are old at "35.
The old Turkish women have a hard lot of
it. Beyond a respect for age which they
contrive to inspire by tooth and nail among
other wives younger than they, their lives
are not happy. Still, they are provided for,
and as long as a man lives he feeds his
family, one and all alike.
J i: AN' .ME HE I ft ' 9 S D DEATH.
A Poor Girl \\ ho Supported Her Old
mother and little Brother* 1.. iil
Iter Fingers Could _No Longer Do
'their Work.
On Thanksgiving day, says the New
York Star, a girl poisoned herself for fear
of being starved to death in New York city.
In a five-storied house in East Houston
street in a small room just under the roof.
I Jeanni" Hem t'"T>d sh* 7 - cottl I not support
her mother, invalid sister and boy broth
ers, aim, .» n.ie ail iii_ .uihi.iy rejoiced in
obedience to the president's order, she took
poison and died in a • room just large
enough to hold the bed and its occupant.
The house. No. 335 Houston street, is di
vided int > thirty tenements, all occupied by
poor people. Perhaps the poorest of all is
the Hem family on the top floor.
The two rooms they occupy are about
eqial to »\ c ordinary small room, but small
as they are, they are too large for the furni
ture to till. The most prominent thing in
the larger of these rooms yesterday, was a.
1< ng, stained pine-box. In this box was
the body of Jeannie Hem. The swollen
hands were still at last over the quiet heart
that wis lately so troubled. Her face told
of a oleasanter Thanksgiving than she had
ever before enjoyed.
Jeanne held the unenviable position of
elder .-> s;er of the family. The father was
dead and the mother washed for the almost
as poor neighbors. The other sister was ill,
and the boys were of the marble-and-tojj
age. From childhood Jeannie did all that
older sisters of poor families are obliged to
do— to he p support the family and personally
sniper, me the younger members, idle never
entered s< c ety of any kind. She was a
p i n-ioo._i ig girl, used to hard work, and
sue never knew any other life. It was a
question of bread with her, and she duti
fully obeyed the voice of duty, to which
was added the touch of hunger. No beans
hovered around Jeannie Hem. While on
the stieet she had but one object to get to
her work of lace-making at a store on
Broadway as soon as possible and to get
home as soon as possible. She had worked
at lace-making from childhood, ami when
she died she was 27 years old. She could
do the daintiest kind of work, and at an
early a_e made some of the lace which
graced t•" belles of the German empire.
Wli n the em family came to Auieritca
Jean)) ea_.il. found employment in. ho
I lao -making establishments of New V,6 k.
As in Berlin she had known "pleasure
outside or the intricate beauties of the
work of her own hands, so in New York
the enjoyments of the idle were not for
her. Her joys consisted in Boeing her
mother and her sister and brothers eat the
fruit of her labors. She worked so hard
that her hands began to swell and felon.
|gew on them. The hands were not made
or such constant work. They were thin
and delicate and needed rest once in awhile
as much as much rougher hands. She could
no longer do the fine work in which she
had taken her only pleasure. Her em
ployer, t ugh inclined to be kind-hearted,
t d r ha she was only spoiling good
lace, and he put her on ordinary work, such'
» iced years ago. This broke her
pride. What she had been living for she
ha., ._■■._. Of course, her wages were cut
correspondingly to her work, and this
meant sa.ri.ices of such things as butter
and lea.
The young girl grew melancholy. She
tried to get other .employment by which
she could earn as much as formerly, but
she was unsuccessful. Her hands pained
her terribly, and she saw that she was use
less iii a world where none but ti.e wealthy
can afford to be useless, and the pain of
body and mind culminated on the day on
which everybody was supposed to be thank
ful for one thing or another. She seemed
to be thankful for the poison she adminis
tere I herself. Just after a scanty breakfast,
■which was all the Thanksgiving dinner the
fa nily could afford, Jeannie went into the
small room and reclined on the bed. Her
mother thought she was ordinarily ill aud
paid no further attention than to arrange
the pillow for her. But before that she
had taken poison— a cupful of paris green
— and before a physician could be called
she was out of the world, and the family
had lost its chief support.
"Yes. Jeannie was discouraged," said
her mother yesterday afternoon. "She
took a great deal of pride in her work, and
when she found she could not do the liner
parts she lost all interest as she feared we
would all starve to death. But 1 would
rather she starved to death with us thau go
off this way."
A few friends called at the top room of
the house. No. 285 East Houston street,
and looked at the still face in the cheap
coffin and said she was a good girl, and
that it was a shame that she should have
died in such a manner. The family awaited
the appearance of the coroner. before being
able to bury the girl, and at every knock
at the door it was anticipated that the dread
man of post-mortem examinations had ar
rived. But no official notice of the girl's
death had been sent to the coroner's office,
and she still lay in her coffin last right
The father of this family was Prof. Levi
Hem, a talented teacher of music, who, like
many other professional men. had more
talent than money, and when he died ho
left neither behind him. The two girls,
Jeannie and Delia, worked on lace at Canal
and Baxter streets, till Deiia became ill,
and then Jeannie was left with too heavy a
load upon her young shoulders. She suc
cumbed on the day of all the year when,
according to the governor's proclamation,
she should not.

A Popular Cricketer Dead.
Cricketers in this country will be sorry to .
learn that A. R. Cobb, the Oxford univer
sity wicket-keeper,, and wicket-keeper of
the. team of English gentlemen who visited
this country this year and last, is dead.
Soon after he r returned to England
from this country he became sick
with typhoid fever, and after a short
illness he died. He was captaiu of
the Winchester eleven in 1883. and
in October of that year went to Oxford.
After having seemed certain of his blue in
1884, he failed in the London matches,' and
had to give place to L. D. Hildyard. In y
1885 he did not take any prominent part in
Oxford cricket, but he got into the eleven
this year, and by his capital batting and
wicket-keeping contributed materially to
Oxford's victory, playing an invaluable
first ii.nings of fifty when the game was
going a_ainst his side, and making no fewer
than five catches.' Mr, Cobb was person
ally very popular..
