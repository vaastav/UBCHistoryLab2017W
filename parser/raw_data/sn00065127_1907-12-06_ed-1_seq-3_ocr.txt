COffSCMTTION IN ARMY
OB, MOEE PAY TO MEN.
Enforced Service Faces American
People, Declares Adjutant
General Ainsworth.
Unless radical measures are enacted
to induce men to enlist in the United
«/States army, conscription must be re
ported to^declares Major General F. C.
Alnsw orth, adjutant general, In his an
nual report.
Notwithstanding the most strenuous
^•efforts on the part of the War Depart
ment and the recruiting officers," says
-General Ainswortli, "it has been found
imiosaible wholly to make goed the
losses, to say nothing of increasing the
•enlisted strength to the authorized lim
it. If present conditions continue there
"will be nothing for the government to
,-xJo but meet this competition by mate-
Tially increasing the soldiers' pay or
to evade competition altogether by a
resort to conscription."
Never before has such a suggestion
•come from an officer clothed with the
authority to make recommendations.
•The Idea of compulsory enrollment of
^individuals for the military service has
'been held abhorrent to republican prin
ciples and the absence of such a law
Is one of the most forceful arguments
used in attracting desirable immigra
tion from Europe.
Officials of the War Department an
ticipate that the possible necessity for
•such action outlined by General Ains
wortli will prove efficacious In securing
•consideration by Congress of the in
crease of pay bill. It is with the great
est reluctance that army officers enter
tain the thought of conscription, but
•generally they agree with General
Alnsworth that It either must come to
that extremity or more money must
ibe provided for the soldier if the stand
ing of the army is to be maintained.
INDIANS TO FIGHT INDIANS.
Mexico Pits Yaquis Against Mayas,
Decreasing Both Tribes.
The Mexican war department, by di
rection of President Diaz, is trying the
•experiment of using the Yaqui Indians
to fight the Mayas. The uprising of
the Maya Indians against federal au
thority began several months ago, and
It has spread until practically all the
members pf that tribe are now In arm
ed rebellion. The Yaqui Indians, like
the Mayas, are waging a bloody con
flict against the government troops,
-and upon the peaceful settlers of their
territory in the State of Sonoro. The
government has been trying for several
years to put down the Yaqui rebellion.
It has succeeded in largely decreasing
the fi.rce of Indians by capturing hun
dreds of ther.i aiid deporting them to
the Qnlntana Roo territory, in what
•was formerly Yucatan. The Maya In
-dlans formerly occupied all of what is
now called Quintana Roo. They were
'brought under temporary subjection
About 19 years ago, and the new terri
tory created by the government
-and was opened up for settlement. The
Mayas soon went on the war path
-again, and there has been no settle
ment of the territory that was former
ly occupied by them. The government
•soldiers have had all that they could
-do to keep the territory from being re
taken by the Mayas.
The Maya Indians have been making
-such an incessant warfare upon the
federal troops that were sent against
them during the last few months that
the order .was given to augment the
forces of the Mexicans by organizing
the Yaquis who had been deported to
•Quintana Roo Into military companies.
It was believed that this experiment
•of pitting the Yaquis against the Mayas
would prove successful from the fact
that the few peaceable Mayas who had
coine into contact with the Yaquis
•seemed to show a natural hatred for
that race of Indians.

ROOSEVELT STANDS
FOR REGULATION OF
BIG CORPORATIONS
In Message Delivered Tuesday
He Urges a National In-
a
corporation Act.
MONEY REFORM IS NEEDED
He Leaves It to Corvgress to Select
Plan, but Inclines Toward Guar
anty Fund for Protection—
Many Points Covered.
•Washington. D. C., Deo. 3.—Pres
ident Roosevelt today sent his annual
message to the sixtieth congress, and
It was read in both branches of the
assembly. In part the message is as
follows:
The Senate and House of Represent
atives: No nation has greater re
sources than ours, and I think It can
be truthfully said that the citizens of
no nation possess greater energy and
industrial ability. In no nation are th-v
fundamental business conditions sound
er than in ours at this very moment
and it is foolish, when such is the case,
for people to hoard money instead oi
keeping it in sound banks for if. is
such hoarding that is the immediate
occasion of money stringency. More
over, as a rule, the business of our peo
ple is conducted with honesty and pro
bity, and this applies alike to farms
and factories, to railroads arnd banks,
to all our legitimate commercial enter
prises.
In any large body of men, howevc,
there are certain to be some who arv
dishonest, and if the conditions an
such that these men prosper or com
mit their misdeeds with impunity, their
example is a very evil thing for tha
community. Where these men ara
business men of great sagacity and of
temperament both unscrupulous and
reckless, and where the conditions pre
such that they act without supervision
or control and at first without effective
check from public opinion, they delude
many innocent people into mu-king. in
vestments, or embarking in kinds of
business that are really unsound. When
the misdeeds of .these successfully dis
honest men are discovered, suffering,
comes not oiily upon them, but upon the
innocent men'whom they have misled. It
is a painful awakening, whenever it oc
curs and, naturally, when it does oc
cur those who suffer are apt to forget
that the longer it was deferred the more
painful it would be. In the effort tu
punish the guilty it is both wise and
proper to endeavor so far as possible to
minimize the distress of those who
have been misled by the guilty. Yet it
is not possible to refrain because of
such distress from striving to put an
end to the misdeeds that are the ulti
mate causes of the sufferings, and, as
a means to this end, where possible to
punish those responsible for them.
There may be honest differences of
opinion as to many governmental poli
cies but surely there can be no such
differences as to the need of unflinch
ing perseverence In the war against
successful dishonesty.
(Here the president quotes from his
1905 message his declaration for the
square deal between corporations and
people and for the regulations of inter
state commerce to this end.)
I have called your attention in these
quotations to what I have already said
because I am satisfied that it is the
duty of the national government to em
body in action the principles thus ex
pressed.
Interstate Commerce.
No small part of the trouble that wo
have comes from carrying to an ex
treme the national virtue of self-re
liance, of independence in initiative and
action. It is wise to conserve this vit^
tue and to provide for its fullest exer-.
else, compatible with seeing that lib
erty does not become a liberty to
wrong others. Unfortunately, this is
the kind of liberty that the lack of all
effective regulation inevitably breeds.
The founders of the constitution pro
vided that the national government
should have complete and sole control'
of interstate commerce. There was
then practically no interstate business
save such as was conducted by water,
and this-the national government at
once proceeded to regulate in thor
oughgoing and effective fashion. Con
ditions have now so wholly changed
that the interstate commerce by water
is insignificant compared with the
amount that goes by land, and almost
all big business concerns are now en
gaged in interstate commerce. As a
result, it can be but partially and im
perfectly controlled or regulated by the
action of any one of the several states
such action inevitably tending to be
either too drastic or else too lax, and in
either case ineffective for purposes of
justice. Only the national government
can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise
the needed control. This does not
mean that there should be any exten
sion of federal authority, for
such authority already exists un
der the constitution in amp
lest and most far-reaching form
but it does mean that there should be
an extension of federal activity. This
is not advocating centralization. It is
merely looking facts in the face, and
realizing that centralization In busi
ness has already come and cannot be
avoided or undone, and that the pub
lic at large can only protect itself from
certain evil effects of this business
centralization by providing better
methods for the exercise of control
through the authority already central
ized in the national government by the
constitution itself.
There must be no halt in the
healthy constructive course of ac
tion which this nation has elected
to pursue, and has steadily pur
sued, during the last six years, as
shown both in the legislation of
the congress and the administra
tlon of the law by the department.
of Justice. The most vlt^l ne^d is
in connection with the railroads:
As to these, in my judgment there
should now be either a national in
corporation act-or-a law licensing,
railway companies to engage, in in
terstate commerce upon certain con
ditions. THE LAW SHOULD BE
SO FRAMED AS TO GIVE TO-.\
THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE
COMMISSION POWER TO PASS
UPON THE FUTURE ISSUE OF
SECURITIES. WHILE AMPLE
MEANS SHOULD BE PROVIDED
TO ENABLE THE COMMISSION,
WHENEVER IN ITS JUDGMENT
IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE A
PHYSICAL VALUATION OF ANY
RAILROAD.
Should Permit Pooling.
As I stated in my message to the
congress a year ago, railroads should
be given power to enter into agree
ments, subject to these agreements be
ing made public in minute detail and
to the consent of the Interstate Com
merce commission being flrst obtained.
Until the national government as
sumes proper control of Interstate com
merce, in the exercise of the authority
It already possesses. It will be impos
sible either to give to or to get from tilt
railroads full justice. The railroads and
all other great corporations will do well
to recognize that this control must
come the only question is as to what
governmental body can most wisely ex
ercise it. The courts will determine the
limits within which the federal author
ity can exercise it, and there will still
remain ample work within each state
for the railway commission of that
state and the National Interstate Com
ojgfcf commission will work In har­
mony with the several state commis
sions, each within its own province,
to achieve the desired end.
Sherman Anti-Trust Law.
Moreover, In my judgment there
should be additional legislation look
ing to the proper control of the great
business concerns engaged in inter
state business, this control to be ex
ercised for their own benefit and pros
perity no less than for the protection
of investors and of the general public.
AB I have repeatedly said in messages
to,the congress and elsewhere, experi
ence has definitely shown not merely
the unwisdom but the futility of en
deavoring to put a stop to all busi
ness combinations. Modern Industrial
conditions are such that combination
Is not only necessary but inevitable. It
is so in the world of business just as
It is In the world of labor, and it is
Idle to desire to put an end to all
corporations, to all big combinations
of capital, as to desire to put an end to
the combinations of labor. Corporation
and labor union alike have come to
stay. Each, if properly managed is a
source of good and not evil. Whenever
In either there is evil, it should be
promptly held to account ,but it should
receive hearty encouragement so long
as it is properly managed. It is pro
foundly Immoral to put or keep on the
statute books a law, nominally in the
interest of public morality, that really
puts a premium upon public immoral
ity, by undertaking to forbid honest
men from doing what must be done un
der modern business conditions, so that
the law itself provides that its own in
fraction must be the condition prece
dent upon business success. To aim at
Lhe accomplishment of too much usual
ly means the accomplishment of too
little, and often the doing of positive
dama ~e.
Forbid the Evil Combination.
(Here the president cited previous ex
pressions to the effect that the Sher
man anti-trust act is so framed that
the business of the country cannot be
conduct without breaking it.)
The antll-trust law should not
be repealed but it should be made
.: both more efficient and more in
harmony with actual conditions.
It should be amended so as to
tcri! I only the kind of combin
at.".. .-.ich does harm to the geri
.. i'uolic, such amendment to
ompanied by, or to be an
ineiv.^..t or, a grant of supervisory
power to the government over
these big concerns engaged in in
terstate business. This should be
.-•accompanied by provision for the
compulsory publication of accounts
and the subjection of books and
papers to the inspection of the
government officials. A beginning
has already been made for such
supervision by the establishment
of the bureau of corporations.
The anti-trust lav/- should not pro
hibit combinations that do no injustice
to the public, still less those the ex
istence of which is on the whole of
benefit to the public. But even if this
feature of the law were abolished,
there would remain as an equally ob
jectionable feature the difficulty and
delay now incident to its enforcement.
The government must now submit to
irksome and repeated delay before ob
taining a final decision of the courts
upon proceedings instituted, and even
a favorable decree may mean an empty
victory. Moreover, to attempt to con
trol these corporations by law suits
means to impose upon both the depart
ment of justice and the courts an im-'
possible burden it is not feasible to
carry on more than a limited number
of such suits. Such a law to be realty
effective must of course be admin
istered by an executive body, and not
merely by means of law suits. The de
sign should be to prevent the abuses
incident to the creation of unhealthy
and improper combinations, instead of
waiting until they are in existence and
then attempting to destroy them by
civil or criminal proceedings.
Condemns Trusts in Necessities.
A combination should not be tol
erated if it abuse the power ac
quired by combination to the pub
lie detriment. No corporation or
association of any kind should be
permitted to engage in foreign or
interstate commerce that is formed
for the purpose of. or whose op
erations create, a monopoly or gen
eral control of the production sale,
or distribution of any one of more
of the primt necessities of life or
articles of general use and neces
sity. Such combinations are
against public policy they violate
the commcn law the doors of the
courts are closed to those who are
parties to them, and I believe the
congress can close the channels of
interstate commerce against them
for its protection. The law should
make Its prohibitions and permis
slons as clear and definite as pos
sible, leaving the least possible
room for arbitrary action, or al
legation of such action, on the part
of the executive or of divergent
Interpretations by the courts.
Among the points to be aimed at
should be the prohibition of un
healthy competition such as by
rendering service at an actual loss
for the purpose of crushing out
competition, the prevention of In
flatlon of capital, and the prohl
bltion of a corporation's making
exclusive trade with itself a con
dltion of having any trade with
itself. Reasonable agreements be
tween, or combinations of corpora
tions should be permitted, provided
they are flrst submitted to and ap
proved by some appropriate gov
ernment body.
THE CONGRESS HAS THE POW
ER TO CHARTER CORPORATIONS
TO ENGAGE IN INTERSTATE AND
FOREIGN COMMERCE, AND A GEN
ERAL LAW CAN BE ENACTED UN
DER THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH
EXISTING CORPORATIONS COULD
TAKE OUT FEDERAL CHARTERS
AND NEW. FEDERAL CORPORA
TIONS COULD BE CREATED.
License as an Alternative.
An essential provision of such a law
should be a method of predetermining
by some federal board or commission
whether the applicant for a federal
charter was an association or combi
nation within the restrictions of the
federal law. Provision',should alsp. be
made for complete publidity In all mat
ters affecting the public and complete
protection to the investing public and
Che shareholders in the matter of Issu
ing corporate securities. If an incor
poration law is not deemed advisable,
a license act for big interstate corpor
ations might be enacted or a combi
nation of the two might be tried. The
supervision established might be an
alogous to that now exercised over na
tional banks. At least, the anti-trust
act should be supplemented by specific
prohibitions of the methods which ex
perience has shown have been of' most
service in enabling monopolistic com
binations to crush out competition. The
real owners of a corporation should be
compelled to do business in their own
name. The right to hold stock in other
corporations should hereafter be de
nied to interstate corporations unless
on apprc^al by the proper government
officials, and a prerequisite to such ap
proval should be the listing with the
government of all owners and stock
holders, both by the corporation own
ing such stock and by the corporation
in which such stock is owned.
To confer upon the national gov
ernment, in connection with the amend
ment 1 advocate in the anti-trust law,
power of supervision over big business
concerns engaged in Interstate com
merce. would benefit them as it has
benefited the national banks. In the
recent business crisis it is noteworthy
that the Institutions which failed were
institutions which were not under the
supervision and control of the national
government. Those which were uri3er
national control stood the test.
Would Help the Railroads.
National control of the kind above
advocated would be to the benefit of
every well managed railway. From
the standpoint of the public there Is
need for additional tracks, additional
terminals, and improvements In the
G&VV.

actual handling the railroads, and
all this as rapidly as. possible. Ample,
safe and speedy transportation facili
ties are even more necessary than
cheap transportation. Therefore, there
Is need for the Investment of money
which will provide for all these things
while at the same time securing as far
as is possible better wages and shorter
hours for their employes. Therefore,
while there must be Just and reason
able regulation of rates, we should be
the flrst to protest against any arbi
trary and unthinking movement to cut
them down without the fullest and
most careful consideration of all in
terests concerned and of the actual
needs of the situation. Only a spe
cial body of men acting for the na
tional government under authority con
ferred upon it by the congress is com
petent to pass Judgment on such a
matter.
Pure Food Law a Success.
Those who fear, from any rea
son, the extension of federal ac
tlvity will do well to study the
history not only of the national
banking act but of the pure food
law, and notably the meat lnspec
tlon law recently enacted. The
pure food law was opposed so vlo
lently that its passage was de
layed for a decade yet it has
worker unmixed and immediate
good. The meat inspection law
was even more violently assailed
and the same men who now de
nounce the attitude of the na
tlonal government in seeking to
oversee and control the workings
of interstate common carriers and
business concerns, then asserted
that we were "discrediting and
ruining a great American Indus
try." Two years have not elapsed,
and already It has become evident
that the great benefit the law cpn
fers upon the public Is accom
plished by an equal benefit to the
reputable packing establishments.
The latter are better oft under the
law than they were without It. The
benefit to Interstate common car
riers and business concerns from
the legislation I advocate would be
Incidentally, in the. passage of the
pure food law the action of the vari
ous state food a^d dairy commission
ers showed In striking fashion how
much good for the whole people re
sults from the hearty co-operation of
the federal and state officials in se
curing a given reform. It is prima
rily to the action of these state com
missioners that we owe the enactment
of this law for they aroused the peo
ple, first to demand the enactment and
enforcement of state laws on the sub
ject, and then the enactment of the
federal law, without which the state
laws were largely ineffective. There
must be the closest co-operation be
tween the national and state govern
ments in administering these laws.
Currency Reform Needed.
In my message to the congress a year
ago I spoke as follows of the currency:
"I especially call your attention to
the condition of our currency laws. The
national bank act has ably served a
great purpose In aiding the enormous
business development of the country,
and within ten years there has been an
increase in circulation per capita from
$21.41 to $33.08. For several years evi
dence has been accumulating that ad
ditional legislation is needed. The re
currence of each crop season empha
sizes the defects of the present laws.
There must soon be a revision of them
because to leave them as they are
means to incur liability of business dis
aster. Since your body adjourned
there has been a fluctuation in the In
terest on call money from 2 per cent,
to 30 per cent, and the fluctuation was
even greater during the preceding six
months. The secretary of the treasury
had to step in and by wise action put
a stop to the most violent period of
oscillation. Even worse than SUCH
fluctuation is the advance In commer
cial rates and the uncertainty felt In
the insufficiency of credit even at high
rates. All commercial interests suffer
during each crop period. Excessive
rates for call money in New* York at
traot money from the,, interior banks
into the speculative field. This depletes
the fund that would otherwise be avail
able for commercial uses, and commer
cial borrowers are forced to pay ab
normal rates, so that each fall a tax,
in the shape of Increased Interest
charges, is placed on the whole com
merce of the country.
"The mere statement of these facts
shows that our present system is se
riously defective.v There is need of a
change. It must never be forgotten
that this question concerns business
men generally quite as much as bank
ers esDecially Is this true of stock
men, farmers, and business me in the
west for at present at certain seasons
of the year the difference in Interest
rates between the east and west is
from 6 to 10 per cent,, whereas in Can
ada the corresponding difference is but
2 per cent."
I again urge on the congress the need
of immediate attention to this matter.
We need a greater elasticity in our cur
rency provided, of course, that we
recognize the even greater need of a
safe and secure currency. There must
always be the most rigid examination
by the national authorities.
Should Be Elaatio System.
Provision should be made for an
emergency currency. The emer
gency issue should, of course, be
made with effective guaranty, and
upon conditions carefully prescribed
by the government. Such emer
gency issue must be based on ade
quate securities approved by the
government, and must be issued un
der a heavy tax. This would permit
currency being issued when the de
mand for it was urgent, while se
curing its retirement as the demand
fell oft. It is worth investigating
to determine whether officers and
directors of national banks should
ever be allowed tt loan to them
selves. Trust companies should
be subject to the same supervision
as banks legislation to this effect
should be enacted for the District
of Columbia and' the territories.
Yet we must als6 rfemember that even
the wisest legislation on the subject
can only accomplish a certain amount.
No legislation can by any possibility
guarantee the business community
against the results of speculative folly
any more than it can guarantee an
individual against the results of his ex
travagance. When an individual mort
gages his house to buy an automobile
he invites disaster and when wealthy
men, or men who pose as such, or are
unscrupulously or foolishly eager to be
come such, indulge in reckless specula
tion—especially if it isv accompanied by
dishonesty—they Jeopardize not only
their own future, but the future of all
their innocent fellow citizens, for they
expose the whole business community
to panic and distress.
Tariff Revision Required.
The .income account of the nation is
In a most satisfactory condition. For
the six fiscal years ending with the 1st
of July last, the total expenditures and
revenues of the national government,
exclusive of the postal revenues and
expenditures, were, in round numbers,
revenues $3,465,000,000. and expendi
tures, $3,275,000,000. TJie satisfactory
working of the present tariff law has
been chiefly responsible for this excel
lent showing. Nevertheless, there is an
evident and constantly growing feeling
among our people that the time is rap
idly approaching when our system of
revenue legislation must be revised.
The Tariff.
This country is definitely com
mltted to the protective system and
and any effort to uproot it could
not but cause widespread industrial
disaster. In other words, the prln
ciple of the present tariff law
could not with wisdom be changed.
But in a country of such phenom
enal growth as ours it is probably
well that every dozen years or so
the tariff laws should be carefully
i*n
-.
&
"J
-V
scrutinized so as to see that no ex
:cessive ,or improper, benefits are.
"conferred thereby, that proper rev
enue is provided, and that our for
elgn trade la encouraged. There
must always be as a minimum a
tariff which will not only allow for
the collection of an ample revenue
but which will at least make good
the difference in cost of production
here and abroad that Is, the dif
ference in the labor cost here and
abroad, for the well being of the
wage-worker must ever be a card
lnal point of American policy. The
question should be aproached pure
ly from a business standpoint
both the time and the manner of
the change being Buch as to arouse
the minimum of agitation and dis
turbance in the business world, and
to give the least play for selfish
and factional motives. The sole
consideration should be to see that
the sum total of changes repre
sents the public good. This means
that the subject can not with wis-:
dom be dealt with in the year pre
ceding a presidential election, be
cause as a matter of fact experl
ence has conclusively shown that
at such a time it is impossible to
get men to treat it from the stand
point of the public good. In my
judgment the wise time to deal
with the matter is immediately af-
Ineome Tax and Inheritance Tax.
When our tax laws are revised th*
question of an income tax and an In
heritance tax should receive the careful
attention of our legislators. In my
judgment both of these taxes Bhould be
part of our system of federal taxa
tion. I speak diffidently about the In
come tax because one scheme for an
Income tax was declared unconstitu
tional by the supreme court while in
addition it is a difficult tax to adminis
ter in Its practical working, and great
care would have to be exercised to see
that it was not evaded by the very men
whom it was most desirable to have
taxed, for if so evaded it would, of
course, be worse than no tax at all
as the least desirable of all taxes is the
tax which bears heavily upon the hon
est as compared with the dishonest
man. Nevertheless, a graduated in
come tax of the proper type would be a
desirable feature of federal taxation,
and it is to be hoped that one may be
devised which the supreme court will
declare constitutional. The inheritance
tax. however, is both a far better
method of taxation, and far more im
portant for the purpose of having the
fortunes of the county bear in propor
tion to their increase in size a corre
sponding Increase and burden of tax
ation.
The government has the absolute
right to decide as to the terms upon
which a man shall receive a be
quest or devise from another, and
this point In the devolution of prop
erty Is especially appropriate for
the imposition' of a tax. Laws im
posing such 'taxes have repeatedly
been placed upon the national
statute books and as repeatedly de
clared constitutional by the courts
and these laws contained the pro
gresslve principle, that Is, after a
certain amount is reached the be
quest or gift, in life or death. Is
Increasingly burdened and the rate
of taxation is Increased in propor
tlon to the remoteness of blood of
the man receiving the bequest.
Behind the European Countries.
The principles are recognized already
In the leading civilized nations of the
world. In Great Britain ail the es
tates worth $5,000 or less are practically
exempt from death duties, while the
Increase is such that when an estate
exceeds $6,000,000. in value and passes
to a distant kirifcman or stranger In

an amount equivalent to nearly a fifth
of the whole estate. In France so much
of an Inheritance as exceeds $10,000,000
pays over a fifth to the state if It
passes to a distant relative.
The German law is especially interest
ing to us because it makes the in
heritance tax an Imperial measure
while allotting to the individual states
of the empire a portion of the proceeds
and permitting them to impose taxes
in addition to those imposed by the im
perial government. Small inheritances
are exempt, but the tax is so sharply
progressive that when the inheritance
is still not very large, provided It is
not an agricultural or a forest land,
it 1s taxed at the rate of 26 per cent,
if it goes to distant relatives. There is
no reason why in the U.iited States
the national government should not
Impose inheritance taxes in addition to
those Imposed by the states, and when
we last had an inheritance tax about
one-half of the states levied such taxes
concurrently with the national govern
ment, making a combined maximum
rate, in some cases as high as 25 per
cent. The French law has one feature
which is to be heartily commended.
The progressive principle Is so applied
that each higher rate is imposed only
on the excess ^bove the amount sub
ject to the next lower rate so that
each Increase of rate will apply only
to a certain amount above a certain
maximum. The tax should if possible
be made to bear more heavily upon
those residing without the country
than within It. A heavy progressive
tax upon a very large fortune is In no
way such a tax upon thrift or Industry
as a like tax wtrnld be on a small for
tune. No advantage comes either to
the country as a whole or to the indi
viduals inheriting the money by per
mitting the transmission in their en
tirety of the enormous fortunes which
would be affected by such a tax and
as an incident to its function of revenue
raising, such a tax would help to pre
serve a measurable equality of oppor
tunity for the people of the generations
growing to manhood. We have not the
slightest sympathy with that socialistic
idea which would try to put laziness,
thrlftlness and inefficiency on a par
with Industry, thrift and efficiency
which would strive to break up not
merely private property, but what Is
far more Important, the home, the chief
prop upon which our whole civilization
stands. Such a theory, if ever adopted,
would mean the ruin of the entire
country—a ruin which would bear
heaviest upon the weakest, upon those
least able to shift for themselves. But
proposals for legislation such as this
herein advocated are directly opposed
to this class of socialistic theories.
Our aim is to recognize what Lin
coln pointed out: The fact that there
are some respects in which men are
obviously not equal but also to in
sist that there should be an equality
of self-respect and of mutual respect,
an equality of rights before the law,
and at least an approximate equality
in the conditions under which each
man obtains the chance to show the
stuff that is in him when compared to
his fellows.
Enforcement of the Law.
A few years ago there was loud conl
plaint that the law could not be In
voked against wealthy offenders. There
Is no such complaint now. The course
of the department of Justice during
the last few years has been such as
to make it eviden^ that no man stands
above the law, that no corporation is
so wealthy that it cannot be held to
account. The department of justice
has been as prompt to proceed against
the wealthiest malefactor whose crime
was one of greed and cunning as to
proceed against the agitator who in
cites to brutal violence. Everything
that can be done under the existing
law, and, witlv the existing state of
public opinion, which so profoundly
influences both the courts and Juries,
has been done. But the laws them
selves need strengthening in more
than one important point they should
be made more definite, so that no hon
est man can be led unwittingly to
break them, and so that the real
wrongdoer can be readily punished.
"Moreover, there must be the pub
lie opinion back of the laws or the
laws themselves will be of no
avail. At present, while the av
etage juryman undoubtedly wishes
to see trusts broken up, and Is
quite ready to fine the corpora^
tlon itself, he is very reluctant to

find the facts proven beyond a rea
sonable doubt when it comes to
sending to Jail a member of the
business community for Indulging
in practices which are profoundly
unhealthy, but which, unfortunate
ly, tho business community has
grown to recognise as well night
normal. Both the present condl- S
tion of the law and the present
temper of juries render It a task
of extreme difficulty to get at the
real wrongdoer In any such case,
especially by Imprisonment. Yet
it is from every standpoint far
preferable to punish the prime of
fender by Imprisonment rather
than to fine the corporation, with
the attendant damage to stock-
Publio Opinion Must Help.
The two great evils In the execution
of our criminal laws today are senti
mentality and technicality. For the
latter the remedy must come from the
hands of the legislatures, the courts
and the lawyers. The other must de
pend for its cure upon the gradual
growth of a sound public opinion which
shall insist that regard for the law
and the demands of reason shall con
trol all other Influences and emotions
In the jury box. Both of these evils
must be removed or public discontent
with the criminal law will continue.
The process of injunction is an es
sential adjunct of the court's doing its
work well and as preventive measures
are always better than remedial, the
wise use of this process is from every
standpoint commendable. But where
it is recklessly or unnecessarily used,
the abuse should be censured,' above
all by the very men who are properly
anxious to prevent any effort to shear
the courts of this necessary power.
Accidents.
The loss of life and limb from rail
road accidents In this country has be
come appalling. It is a sublect of
which the national government should
take supervision. It might be well' to
begin by providing for a federal in
spector of Interstate railroads some
where along the lines of federal inspec
tion of steamboats, although not going
so far perhaps at flrst all that it
would be necessary to have would be
some officers whose duty It would be
to investigate all acidents on interstate
railroads and report in detail the
causes thereof.
Employers' Liability.
Congress should adopt legislation pro'
viding limited but definite compensa
tion for accidents to all workmen with
in the scope of the federal power, in
cluding employes of navy yards and
arsenals. In other words, a model em
ployers' liability act,-far reaching and
thoroughgoing, should be enacted
which should apply to all positions
public and private, over which the na
tional government has Jurisdiction.
The law should be made such that
the payment for accidents by the em
ployer would be automatic instead of
being a matter for lawsuits. Workmen
should receive certain and definite com
pensation for all accidents in industry
irrespective of negligence.
By the proposed law, employers
would gain a desirable certainty of ob
ligation and get rid of litigation to
determine it, while the workman and
his family would be relieved from a
crushing load.
The constitutionality of the employ
ers' liability act passed by the preced
ing congress has been carried before
the courts. In two jurisdictions the
law has been declared unconstitutional
and in three jurisdictions its constitu
tionality has been' affirmed. The ques
tion has been carried to the supreme
court, the case has been heard by that
tribunal, and a decision is expected at
an early date. In the event that the
court should affirm the constitutional
ity of the act, I urge further legislation
along the lines advocated in my ities
sage to the preceding congress. Since
1895 practically every country of Eu
rope, together with Great Britain, New
Zealand, Australia, British Columbia,
and the Cape of Good Hope has enacted
legislation embodying in one form or
another the complete recognition of the
princinle which places upon the em
ployer the entire trade risk in the
various lines of industry.
Eight-Hour ^aw.
The principle of the eight-hour day
should as rapidly and as far as prac
ticable be extended to the entire work
carried on by the government and
the present law should be amended to
embrace contracts on those public
works which the present wording of the
act has been construed to exclude.
Investigation of Industrial Disputes.
Strikes and lockouts, with their at
tendant loss and suffering, continue to
increase. For the five years ending
December 31, 1905, the number of strikes
was greater than those in any previous
ten years and was double the number
in the preceding five years. These fig
ures lndlcute the increasing need of
providing some machinery to deal with
this class of disturbances in the inter
est alike of the employer, the employe,
and the general public. I renew |rny
previous recommendation that the con
gress favorably consider the matter of
creating the machinery for compulsory
investigation of such Industrial contro
versies as are of sufficient magnitude
and of sufficient concern to the people
of the country as a whole to warrant
the federal government in taking ac
tion.
Tho need for some' provision for
such investigation was forcibly il
lustrated during the past sum
mer. A strike of telegraph oper
ators seriously Interfered with tele
graphic communication, causing great
damage to business Interests and se
rious inconvenience to the general pub
lic. Appeala were made tu mo from
many parts of the country, from city
councils, from boards of trade, from
cha.mberb of commerce, and from labor
organizations, urging that steps be
taken to terminate the strike. Every
thing that could with any propriety be
done by a representative of the govern
ment was done, without avail, and for
weeks the public stood by and suffered
without recourse of any kind. Had the
machinery existed and had there been
authority for compulsory Investigation
of the dispute, the public would have
been placed in possession of the merits
of the controversy, and public opinion
would probably have brought about a
prompt adjustment.
Employment of Women and Children.
No question growing out of our rapid
and complex industrial development Is
move Important than that of the em
ployment of women'and children. The
presence of women In industry reacts
with extreme directness upon the char
acter of the home and upon family life,
and the conditions surrounding the em
ployment of children bear a vital rela
tion to our future citizenship. Our legis
lation in these areas under the con
trol of the congress is very much be
hind the legislation of our more pro
gressive states. .A thorough and com
prehensive measure should bo adopted
art this session of the congress relating
to the employment of women nnd' chil
dren In the District of Columbia and
the territories. The investigation into
the. condition of women and children
wage-earners recently authorized and
directed by the congress is now being
carried on in the various states, and 1
recommend that the appropriation
made last year for the beginning of this
work be renewed, in order that we may
have the thorough and comprehensive
investigation which the subject de
mands. Thu national government has
as an ultimate resort for control of
child labor the use of the Interstate
commerce clause to prevent the prod-,
ucts of child labor from entering into
interstate commerce. But before using
this it ougiit certainly to enact model
laws on the subject for the territories
unOer its own immediate control.
The Really Dangerous Criminals.
There is one fundamental proposition
which can be laid down as regards all
these matters, namely 'While honesty
by itself will not solve the problem,
yet the insistence unon nonesty—not
merely technical honesty, but honesty
in purpose and Fplrit—is an essential
element in arriving at a right conclu
sion. Vice in its cruder and mote
archaic forms shocks everybody but
there is very urgent need that public
^MOSSk

J&:'
opinion should be lust as severe In con-'
demnalion of the vice which hides ltselfl
behlnd class or professional loyalty, or
which denies that it is vice if it can'
escape conviction in the courts. The
public and the representatives of
the public, the high officials, whether
on the bench or In executive or legls
latlve positions, need to remember that
often the most dangerous criminals, so
far as the life of the nation is con
cerned, ui*e not those who commit the
crimes known to and condemned by the
popular consciences for centuries, but
those who commit crimes only rendered
possible by the complex conditions of
our modern industrial life. It make*
not a particle of difference whether
these crimes are committed by a cap
italist or by a laborer, by a leading
banker or manufacturer or railroad
man, or by a leading representative of
a labor union.
Swindling in stocks, corrupting
legislatures, making fortunes by
the inflation of securities, by wreck
ing railroads, by destroying com
petitors through rebates—these
forms of wrongdoing in the cap
italist, are for more .Infamous than
any ordinary form of embezzlement
or forgery yet It is a matter of ex
treme difficulty to secure the pun
ishment of the man most guilty of
them, most responsible for them.
The business man who condones
such conduct stands on a level with
the labor man who deliberately sup
ports a corrupt demagogue and agi
tator, whether head of a union or
head of some municipality, because
he is said to have "stood by th*
union." The members of the busi
ness community, the eduoators, or
clergymen, who condone and en
courage the first kind of wrongdo
ing, are no more dangerous to the
community, but are morally even
worse, than the labor men who are
guilty of the second type of wrong
doing, because less Is to be par
doned those who have no such ex
cuse as Is furnished either by lgnor
ance or by dire need.
Farmers and Wage Workers.
The national government, through
the department of agriculture, should
do all it can by joining with the stat»
governments and with independent as
sociations of farmers to encourage the
growth In the open farming country
of such Institutional and social move
ments as will meet the demand of th«
best type of farmers, both for the Im
provement of their farms and for the
betterment of the life itself. The de
partment of agriculture has in many
places, perhaps especially in certain
districts of the south, accomplished
an extraordinary amount by co-operat
ing with and teaching the farmer*
through their associations, on their
own soil, how to increase their in
come by managing their farms better
than they were hitherto managed. Th»
farmer must not lose his independence,
his initiative, his rugged self reliance,
yet he must learn to work In tho
heartiest co-operation with his fel
lows. exactly as the busfness man has
learned to work and he must prepar®
to use to constantly better advantage
the knowledge that can bo obtained
from agvicultual colleges, while he
must insist upon a practical curriculum
in the schools in which his children
are taught.
The grain producing Industry of the
country, one of the most important
In the United States, deserves special
consideration at the hands o{ the con-,
gress. Our grain is sold almost ex
clusively by grades. To secure sat
isfactory results In our home mar
kets and to facilitate our trade
abroad, these grades should approxi
mate the highest degree of uni
formity and ccrtalnty. The present di
verse methods of Inspection and grad
ing throughout the country under dif
ferent laws and boards, result In con
fusion and lack of uniformity, des
troying that confidence which is nec
essary for healthful trade. Complaints
against the present methods have con
tinued for years and they are growing
in volume and intensity, not only la
this country but abroad. I therefor*
suggest to the congress the advisability
of a national system of inspection and
grading of grain entering Into Inter
state and foreign commerce as a rem
edy for tho present evils.
Inland Waterways.
Tho conservation of our natural re
sources and their proper use constitute
the fundamental problem which under
lies almost every other problem of our
national life. We must maintain for
our civilization the adequate material
basis without which that civilization
cannot exist. We must show fore
sight, we must look ahead. As a na
tion we not only enjoy a wonderful
measure of present prosperity, but If
tills prosperity is used aright it Is
an earnest of future success such as
no other nation will have. The reward
of foresight for this nation is great
and eusily foretold. But there must
GS the look ahead, there must be &
realization of the fact that to waste,
to destroy, our natural resources, to
skin and exhaust the land Instead of
using It so as to Increase its useful
ness, will result in undermining in the
days of our children the very pros
perity which we ought by right to hand
down to them amplified and developed.
For the last few years, through several
agencies, the government has been en
deavoring to get our people to look
ahead and to substitute a planned and
orderly development of our resources
In .place of a haphazard striving for..'
immediate profit.
Our great river systems should be de
veloped as national water highways
the Mississippi, with its tributaries,
standing dial lr, Importance, and the
Columbia second, although* there are
many others of Importance on the Pa*
cltlc, the Atlantic and th6 gulf slopes.
The national government should under
take this work, andT hope a beginning
will be made In the present congress
and the greatest of all our rivers, the
Mississippi,., should receive especial at
tention
From the great lakes to the mouth of
the r^isslsslppl there should be a deep
water way. with deep waterways leading
from It to the cast and the west. Such a
waterway would practically mean the ex-'
tension of our coast line into the very
heart of our country. The government
dams should be used to produce hundreds
of (huu»ands of horsepower as an inci
dent to improving r.avlgattbn for the an
nual value of the unused water power of
the United States perhaps exceeds the an
nual value of iho products of all our
mines. As an incident to creating the deep
waterway aown tue Mississippi, the gov
ernment should build along its whole
lower length levees which taken together
with the control of the headwaters, will
at once and forever put a complete stop
to all thrent of floods in the Immensely
fertile Delia region. I have appointed an
Inland waterways commission to study
and outline a comprehensive scheme of
development along all the lines indicated.
Later 1 shall lay Its report before the
congress.
Reclamation Work.
Irrigation should be far more extensively
developed than at present, not only in the
states of the great plains and the Rocky
mountains, but in many others, as, for
lr,--tance. In large portions of the south
Atlantic anil gulf states, where It should
go hand In hand with the reclamation Of
swamp land The federal government
should seriously devote Itself to this task,
realizing that utilization of waterways
and water power, forestry. Irrigation, and
the reclamation of lands threatened
with overrlow, are all intefde-^
pendent parts of ..ie same problem.
Public Lands.
Tho land law system w^ich was de
signed to meet the needs of the fertile and
well-watered regions of the middle west
has largely broken down when applied to
the. dryer regions of the great plains, the
mountains, and much of the Pacific elope,
where a farm of 160 acres is inadequate
for self-support. In these regions the sve
tem lent Itself to fraud, and much land
parsed out ,of the hands of the govern
ment without passing into the hands of
the home-maker. The department of the
interior ard the department of Justice
Joined in prosecuting the offenders against
the law and they have accomplished
much, while where the administration of
the law has been defective it has been
changed. But the laws themelves are de
fective. Three years ago a public lands
commission was appointed to scrutinise
lhe law, and defects, and recommend a
remedy. Tnelr examination specifically
showed the'existence of great fraud up«A
