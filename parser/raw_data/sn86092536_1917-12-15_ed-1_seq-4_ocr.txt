THE IMPROPRIETY OF DEMOCRATIC GLEE |
Under the eupgesttve head. "Wanted? An Issue," the Charleston Gazette j
of a recent issue proceeds In a gleeful spirit to descant on the alleged utter !
helplessness the Republican party finds itself reduced to In these stressful j
times of the country's peril: that it is hog-tiod and silenced by the political ;
perfections and exclusive patriotism of the administering Democracv. More ;
]
specifically it says: "Circumstances, coupled with the real leadership and j
constructive acts of a Democratic party, have robbed th? Republicans of an :
issue, and. for the first time since the reconstruction period, they are at sea
in an open boat, rudderless."
- That statement has a decided ex cathedra flavor. It is a clear reflection
of the flattering unction that glows in the solitudes of the White Hous? ;
cloister. The Gazette in referring to the "real leadership" means, of course, j
the arrogant personality -who has defined non-partisan action to mean any- j
thing that tends to his own self-aggrandizement or which promotes' the I
*
security of the entrenched position of the Democratic party in the possession
of the offices of government, and that it is bordering on treason to dispute j
the dicta of this imperial will, who was too proud to fight prior to the last j
presidential election, but who within thirty days after his re-inauguration
asked Congress to declare war. and who is now promoting that war with
the greatest rhetorical zeal known to history* as a personally conducted
adventure for the glorification of a sublime egotism, and incidentally for
partisan ends.
" The "circumstances- which the Democrats hare chosen adroitly to appear j
/
Jn conjunction with, anointed impeccability have shown the innate loyalty
of Republican profession, while at the same time they have bared the utter
hypocrisy of the Democratic confession of faith. The Republicans in Con
gress have faithfully kept the implied political armistice In the cessation of
all party activity, while the Democratic leadership" has utilized every re
source available for the party's advancement to greater power and advantage.
The loyal silence Of the Republicans has evidently been mistaken for con
cession of the Democratic deduction that the party has been bereft of Issues,
and that it is "at sea in an open boat, rudderless." And all of this partisan
jollification points to the Democratic belief, if not the hope, that the Repub
lican party organization has finally been "sunk without trace," torpedoed
by the most offensively partisan President that ever sat in the White House,
and effected under a flag of truce. If this were true it is nothing to boast
of. It is true, however, that such annihilation has been the persistent aicn
and the earnest devotion of this administration, which it has sought to
camouflage by a blatant appeal for non-partisan action.
* With a singular Ignorance of the trend of events, the Gazette continues
t6 exult over the apparent denuding of the Republican party of its Issues,
leaving it naked to its enemies, in this unfortunate citation: "The tariff Is
as dead as the one of slavery. The old cow, protective tariff, died with the
defeat of Mr. Hughes." Oh, did it? Then why was it that the Democratic
party was compelled to repudiate its dominant free trade principle in remitting
its intention with regard to admitting sugar free of duty, and providing a pro- ;
tective rate of duty for the dyestuffs industry? The quadrennial interment 1
of the tariff Question has been one of the mock solemnities of the Democracy
for the past fifty years, which has always been followed with the discovery <
that it has buried an. unidentified corpse. Nothing has tended to so vitalize .
the Republican principle of protection as the interposition of the war,' which j
has acted automatically in the place of protection to restore a prosperity ?
that was gasping its last breath under the blight of the discredited Demo- J
cratio economio policy. The memory of the people is not so short as to have ;
forgotten 'the days prior to the outbreak of this war. when the Industrial and 1
business Interests of the country lay prostrate and the bread line and the
soup house flourished.
Tlie tariff dead! It is more insistent than ever in the prospect of its
i
savin* virtues -when- the days of readjustment shall come with peace, and i
this country shall meet all the other nations fortified with protective ,
schedules.
I
The Gazette has Intruded Its gloating with great impropriety on a situa- I
tion that Is eo full of Democratic Inconsistencies and inefficiency that the
Republican* are more embarrassed -with issues than sustaining the impover*
lihment suggested. It overlooks the fact that in the first instance Its party
earn? Into power through the back door, and that its -whole course In office
Is strewn -with repudiated pledges and broken promises; that its assertive
demand for pitiless publicity has been resolved into concrete concealment
It went into the campaign of 1916 flaunting the hypocritical banner,
, "War in the East, peace In the "West Thank God for Woodrow Wilson!"
And that hypocrite, keeping up this deception, proclaiming the policy of
i, "Peace without victory," lulled the country Into a false security. Then,
whirling around, he plunged the country into a war. a country unprepared
through his negligence and the dallying of his party with the imminent peril
tliat every man of vision knew this great nation could not escape. The bugles
that once sounded the refrain, "He kept us out of war." were then employed
in blaring out the appeal, "Stand by the President" And then came the test. (
The Republicans forgot party In their duty to country, and rallied, not to I
the President, solidly to the support of the government he represented. They ?
laid down no obstacle n6r did they interpose any factious opposition to any ;
? 'of the measures that looked to the rapid preparation of the nation's fighting
force. It was the Democratic majority that balked and retarded. It was ;
the solfff Republican minority that saved important preparatory measures
from defeat. But why record further at this time the miserable record that
has been written by incompetency and punctuated with the offensive exploi
tation of the war for partisan ends by an alleged apostle of non-partisanlsm?
From "watchful waiting" to "too proud to fight" precious days were lost .
to preparedness, and finally when we were put' to the extremity where we j
either had to fish or cut bait, we were thrust into war helpless to defend
j
ourselves, but fortunately screened from disaster by the invincible fleet of I
Great Britain, and which today is the only adequate protection we have
against an enemy invasion. And now when the- foreign nations engaged, in
this war are marshaling the intelligent statesmanship and the largest abili
ties of their citizenship in their war councils and the administrative func
tions of government, without reference to their political opinions, the United
States, alone of the Allies, stands bound to the selfish service of party end*
through the ingrained purtisan obstinacy of an autocrat, as powerful as lh*
Kaiser and as great an egoist, who w^ll accept no counsel but that of "deserv
ing Democrats," and who has Ignored the ability and competency he might ,
have called to advise and administer with him..
The coalition cabinets of Europe are making progress. They are func- 1
tloning efficiently, while we drag along in :he groove and rut of partisan''
bXClusiveness with the Inept performance of incompetents. And there,'
wrapped in the so!!rude of Lis own self-satisfaction. holding himself aloof
from ail contact with real advisory energies and withholding the confidences ,
he should repose in the people and in Congress. Woodrow Wilson sits gloomy j
and peculiarly a sceptered hermit, while confusion runs riot. In the high [
and inefficiency mocks the efforts of co-ordination and co-operation, j

BUSTLE NOT HUSTLE !
It is a Fact That in America More Haste Often Means Less Speed.
Do Not Think You Have to "Make Good" Before Forty.
BY P. A. VAILE ?
Author of" Modern Tennis," "Modern Golf," "The Soul of Golf." etc
America la famous, amongst other
things, for Us hustle, but It Is op<*n
to question If it really dues hustle quite
as much as It thinks It docs. A dis
tinguished visitor to this country, a
member of the British house of pa"
llament. recently gave it as his opinion
that American really are a most leisure
ly peoplo.
This is a very strfwung statement to
emanate from an Englishman. hut he
was quite sincere In making it. He as
serted that much of what the. ordinary
American thinks is hustle Is merely
bustle.
There can l>e little doubt that mere
hurry has bccome u habit with ninny
Americano. It Is quite common tn set
people dodging frantically across a
street between motorcars and horses
only to saunter leisurely up the other
sidewalk.
Recently I saw a voting man alight
from a trolley-car. run round In front of
it, dodge, by an tnch or two. a col
lision with the elevated railway stand
ard. spring from under a mall-truck
coming down at about .forty miles an
hour, gain the sldevvallt and proceed to
stroll quietly along for a block before
he entered an apartment house.
Thfro Is another manifestation of the
hurry hahlt that Is psychological. Any
one who has done much business In
America must have noticed how diffi
cult it Is to pet many of the business
men to concentrate on the subject mat
ter of the Interview.
The writer has noticed this so often
that recently he decided "to try to shock
one of his friends out of the habit: so.
when ho saw the signs, he said sudden
ly: "For heaven's sake give up think
ing about that important appointment
that you have not got and attend to
me."
The absent-minded one "came hack to
earth" with a shock, laughed and ad
mitted the charge. He had not any
thing else that demanded ntteniion. bur
ho could not rid his mind of the idea
that he had. This peculiar phase of
the national habit is quite common, and.
Indeed, seems to be growing to such
an extent that It Is hardly too much to
say that it Is becoming a national trait.
The hurry habit has a very serious
, aspect' in" that it tends to shorten the
? American's life even beyond the years
that he himsfelf. by this means, out off
it. This is how It comes to pass: In
America a man Is expect-'! to hustle so
! that he does his big work before he is
thirty-five, or at most forty. If he has
j not "made good" by tlint time people .
! look askance at him.
At fifty t lie Rt. Hon. John Burns was
| "rioting" in Trafalgar Square. London,
and was. if I remember, imprisoned for
doing so. Nearly n quarter of a cen
tury Inter he was a British cabinet liiin
istcr for several years.
The nightmare that hangs over sn
many men in this country thai they
must do what they have to do within
u bout half the time allotted to nifcn of
oth<-r nations wherein to do the same
thing tends to produce much unneces
: sary baste, mere bustle that never is
?translated even into hustle, let alone
speed and efficiency; but nevertheless it
helps materially to break flown the men- ,
? lal and physical tone of the nation and
is a real danger.
In America it seems to be a religion
with most men to strive strenuously
foe the big priz", which generally means
money, and to he obsessed by the Idea
that the prize must be won by a time
' when n man should In reality be com
ing Into somo of the best years of his
life ? his actual prime ? namely between
forty and fifty.
j In other countries. Franco for Instance
| one does not find this restless, wearing,
nerve-racking struggle to do a. certain
tiling within a certain time thot in many
cases Is all loo short for the accomplish
ment thereof. There, so long as a man
does not give up the fight, he Is honor
ed and considered to have a chance In
the great battle of life, and innumerable
, Instances could be given where men
have achieved fam* nnd fortune In Paris
at an age that would have branded them j
as failures In this country.
Rodin struggled against adversity and !
ridicule until half a century ,hnd passed
over his head. Then ho took a place :
that Is unique amongst modern scuip
i tors, and sent his name down to imper-i
ishahle fame.
| Hustle, when necessary, is good: bus
' tie. that is so often mistaken for It, Is
never so. ,
Some of the results of the Wilson hierarchical system are coming out through;
the investigation now under way in the Senate. More are to follow.
The Republican party can afford to stand pat for Issues, while the stews ;
of party incompetency are stirred. Everything will come out in the boiling. |
INCLUDE FILTRATION
As the city council has determined
to launch a bond issue for the ap
proval of the voters' for the purpose
of supplying some .of the imperative
needs of the city, it would do well to
consider the propriety of including
provisions for the installment of an
effective filtration system.
Without question, ihe supply of
clear and pure water is one of prime
importance to the people of this com
munity. The filtration problem has
been discusscd to exhaustion. Its need
is popularly recognized. The health
of the people is contingent on the fur
nishing of pure water, and the respon
sibility for its coming rests upon tbo
prompt action of council.
The present bond issue can well
carry -with it a provision for the in
stallation of the filtration system as
approved by City Engineer Cooke and
others who have spoken with author
ity on the matter. The opportunity's
open to secure a clear, healthful sup
ply of water, adaptable for all uses.
The proposed bond issue will not meet
with the approbation of the voters if
rouncll neglects to take the forward
step that should appeal to it without
further urging.

son why you cannot' go to church to
morrow.
THE DUTY OF THE DOLLARS
In the personal interest way of man
ifesting our duty in this war is the ex
ercise to the limit of our contributing
capacity to the financial needs of the
government. You can be a more rep
rehensible "slacker" in this respect
than in dodging military service. Mr.
Frank A. Vanderllp, president of the
largest National bank of the country,
has gone Into the service of the gov
ernment for the war at the nominal
salary of $1 a year. lie Is the head
of the War Savings Certificates, a
| proposition within the ivach of the
j smallest purse. Besides his financial
'gumption, he possesses a great facul-;
| ty for making things plain to the j
?plain people. In a receut statement'
he said:
! "Thero are three things you can do
with R dollar." Tou cAn hsard It In- J
l vest It. or spend It. To hoard a dollar j
| is to make It Idle and unemployed. A;
dollar which Is not working: Is almost
jns much a drain on society as an Idle
' man. A hoarded dollar at this tlme>
i of war crisis Is a slacker. Still -worse,
however. Is the dollar which Is spent
for a useless purpose. Such a dollar
is an active factor to prevent our win
nine th'- war. It Is a traitor dollar be
cause the labor of men and women Is
? r:i|>li>yvtl modlossly to make usoless
jthinirs at a time when the government
needs that labor to make things that '
aiv i-ssentlal for our soldiers In winning
; the war."
j Those who haTe not yet contracted
I the indispensable saving habit and the
j habit of giving or lending money, will
' profit by these ringing words. The
strength of our soldiers will be made
that much more efficient by the sup
port of our dollars. Don't be satiB
i fled with giving or subscribing once
and imagine you have fulfilled your
full duty. You must give and sub
scribe as long as you have anything
to offer. As has been pointed out. be
I fore we reach the end of this fiscal
year there will be twenty billions of
the enlisted dollars, and most of them
: volunteers. For the slackers and
? hoarders and traitors there Is the pll
j lorj' of public opinion ready to teach :
them the duty to their country, which
i they seek to avoid.

j .
; RAILROAD WAGE PROBLEM
j There Is an angle of the railroad
problem that should not be overlooked !
by Congress In any contemplated con- 1
? trol it may assume over the transpor-l
tatlon lines of the country, and that Is j
the question of wages of railroad em- 1
ployes. This will be a constant men-;
ace to the efficiency of the railroads
until some definite settlement is pro
vided -which 'will bar any chance of
in interruption of the public business.
The railroads are regulated by law
and their rates are under government
controL This places the railway sys
tems in the class of public institutions
controllable by the government, and
with this understanding, why should
the employes be exempted from regu
latory measures that are applied -with
out question to their employers? Con
gress ought to provide a method of
fixing the wages of the employes of
railroads, by arbitration or otherwise,
so that the existing menace they now
hold In their hands Is removed. And
the railroads should also be obligated
to accept settlements made In this
way without dissent. If some solution
of this character is not effected there
can be no true adjustment of the rail
road situation, or any promise of per
manent peace in transportation ad
ministration.
A London watch-importing: house do
ing: a large business with Switzerland
haa Just sent & circular to its Swl?3
clients proposing to paj- them for orders
placed In 5 per oont British War-Lo.vi
bonds, redeemable In 6 years at 102.
Well, If the Democrats ever got that
method of trade adopted in the United
States they will buy our own people out
of their own Jobs with their own money.
Last winter the President demanded
as one of the neccssary conditions of
the pcacc to which, he could not then be
a party an autonomous and Independent
Poland. Now. in outlining the peace :o
which the United States must be signa
tory, he says that the Auatro-Hungarian
Empire must not be dlsmemtored. What,
then becomes of Austrian Poland?
A measuro has been introduced sub- I
mlttlng Congreasmen to the operations
of tho excess war profits tox. It will j
catch them for $1.1500, but every little bit j
helps. And why not the Congressmen? |
i
The greatest problem before the Am- j
crican people Is the Industrial labor '
problem. It received not one word of i
attention in the President's message -.o !
Congress.
Shopliiers should avoid confounding J
their practices with modern conserva- 1
lion ideas. It will savo them a lot of j
trouble. J
And again wo havo tho U-boat men-,
are not only checked, but under abso-j
lute control. That sounds good, but
wait.
