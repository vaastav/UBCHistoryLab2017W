The President's Message
Lift week we published, the Meeiege of
President Buchanan, and were prevented
from miking any remarks upon it at that
time on account of want of apace. It if,
like all of Mr. Buchanan's meninges, core-
: felly prepared and written with ability. The
great question, to which the attention of the
- country is directed, is ably discussed. He
denies the right of State to aecede, and
' counaela moderation. He blames ths North
for its aggressions upon the South, but doer
ot think that the mere election of a North-
'era man to the ' Presidency is cufiicient
ground for the threatening and revolution
irv attitude of the South. At the same
time, he defends the South in their preeer.t
position, to a certain extent, and eaya a!
they require at the hands of the North is to
be let alone.
What Mr. Buchanan saya is well esid, in
the main, yet it is obvious tbat he finds it o?
'difficult as others hove done, to suggest a
remedy. The advice which he gives, we
- fear has come too late; for, if we mny judje
of the progress of events in the South, and
the extreme position which the South has
taken, the discussion of the question whether
' accession is a peaceful and a constitutional
or a revolutionary ripht, is of little moment.
That point the South has decided for her
self. She has declared that, right or wrong,
she will resort to secession unless the hos
'lie legislation of the North shall be repeal
ed and the programme of the Republican
party modified. She demands new guaran
tees of ber rights under the Constitution,
and unless in a fraternal spirit of union, the
North grants them, lha attempt at secession
will be made.
. Our past has been full of glory, happiness
and prosperity, and disunion is a spectre of
most horrid aspect, which Mr. Buchanan's
message will not frighten from its position, i
The disunion feeling is growing, and there
is but little hope of the Union remaining
one and indivisable foT enother month. Mr.
Buchanan has done perhaps all he could hove
done with affairs in their present posture.
The time, when o Democratic President, at
the head of a Democratic party, could have
settled all these difficulties, has passed; end
although comparisons ore idle now, we do
not live in the dys of Jackson, nho, ahe!
,la dead. ,
Stitte Coercion.
- A State is nothing cpirt from the individ
uals that compose it. The people are the
State. ,The word Stnte, as the Statesman
truthfully observes, merely signifies the
people in a certain locality organized into a
separate ci immunity, yet subject in I hi is
country to 1- 5 country to the Constitution
and lawa of l.i United Ststej as the su
preme law.
President Buchanan say.', in his messige,
that he has no right to decide what shn 11 be
the relation between the Federal Govern
ment and South Carolina. Certainly not.
As he himself has conclusively shown, the
Constitution fixes that relation. It deter
mines that that relation is one of protection
pp. the part of the Federal Government, and
of tllegience and obedience on the part of
the State, or which is the same tiling, of the
people of Sssth Ccrolina ond of every other
State.
But our Chief Magistrate slrargely loses
sight of this relation, which he hos himself
clearly proved to exist, ond propounds to
Congress the singular question, whether that
body has the constitutional power to coerce
a seceding State into submission. It is un
questionably the duty of Copgrees, under the
oath of fidelity to the Constitution w hich
tbe members hove individually tnken, to co
operate with the Executive in enforcing sub
mission to the lows upon every State, thut
is, upon the propleof every S'.ot. whn m- y
refuse to obey them, or resist their execu
tion. President Buchanan answers his own
question. After much serious deliberation,
he comes to the conclusion that the Consti
tution has conferred no power upon Con
gress to declare or make war against a
. State. One would think that this conclu
sion might have been arrived at without very
long or very serious deliberation. Congress
has plainly no such power. If it had, it
would be treating a State as a foreign gov
ernment. Governments declare and mske
-war against foreign governments, not against
one or more of their own constituent parts.
- There is no special grant of power in the
Constitution to Congress to coerce a State
into submission by declaring war against it;
because such a grant would have been
acknowledgment that tbe States are foreign
' ana independent aovereigntiea, and that the
1 Gederal Government is not supreme over
all. But there ia no necessity for such a
grant, because the Constitution has solemn
ly bound the Executive to take care that tbe
' laws shall be faithfully executed, and made
it equally the solemn duty of Congress and
ot every department of tbe Government, as
v.. well as of every good citizen, to aid bim in
. lulfillipg tbat obligation.
Enforcing tbe law is not making war upon
State. To say eo, ia to misstate and befog
j,. tbs case. , A State of itself can commit no
. act of disobedience to toe laws, or or trea
r .son to the Federal Government, It Is tbe
people wbo do these things; and no matter
in what form or under what pretence tbey
.ijwsdooe, whether by citizens in tbe name
jryof. Slate or of a Cbpfederacy, tbe persona
committing ths crimlqa and treasonable
acta are to be held accountable to the lawa
and tribunals of tbe Union. And the Gov

Governor Gist, of South Carolina, indig
nantly repudiates in his message to the
Legislature, all ideas of a compromise with
the-North and of a conference with any
Southern State, before taking that leap in
the dark the leap cut of the Union, He
says thatsecession is the only alternative,
and that South Corolina, Fpeaking for her
self, without a conference ond without delny,
must declare herself on independent power,
and act cccordingly. In all probability, her
Slate Convention, which meets on the 19th
of December, will pnes the uctoi tecesfion,
unless something shall be done in the inter
val to prevent it. But Congress mny dj
something to arrest even South Carolina on
the very threshold of secession.

The mo.'t importont news we have frcm
Europe, is that Victor Emmanuel has ac
cepted the Sovereignty of the Two Sic.ilieF,
which virtually mikes him King of Italy.
Gariboldi has rrsignrd his Diclntursliip, and
retired to his island I ome in the Mediterra
nean. There he will remnin, most proba
bly, dui in the winter. What he may do
in the nf.t year remains veiled in the dusky
future, but he ia not a men to be idle when
heroic scMevements are to be performed.
Perhaps he may carry out his promise of as
sisting in a great attempt to restore the na.
tionality ord liberty ol Hungary.
A Inter arrival informs us that Garibildi
has received the appointment of General in
the Sardinian army. His farewell address
to his army is published. He urges his
countrymen to be watchful, and hold them
selves in readiness for great events next
Spring, when he exppcts to see an army of
1,000,000 men. The new Italian army is
to comprise 177 regiments of infantry, cav
airy and i-rtillery, and 4 battalions of Ber
snglieri. The Express Eugenie arrived in
London on the 14 h ult., imd remained there
in the strictest incognito. She will mnke a
visit to Scotland, in the hope of recovering
her impaired health.
OSrThc Washington correspondent of the
Philadelphia Press says:
'After visiting the Supreme Court-room
yesterday I had on interview with a person
high in authority, who informed me thut
Chief Justice Tanney would die in the liar
ness, and that persistent efforts had been
made to induce him to withdraw, in order lo
allow Mr. Buchanan to fill the vacancy by
the appointment of one of hia favorites. ' He
alleged that the Chief, although very feeble,
wu3 in as good health as he had been for
many yenrs past, and that, owing to his sim
ple bubits and quiet liie, he miylit survive lur
several years to come. His mind Is as cKar,
and his judgment as corre t, os it has ever
been. It gives me greut pleasure to be en
abled to state this fact."
O-Large numbers of free negroes are
coming North from North Carolina, South
Carolina and Georgia, in anticipation ol
hostile legislation by the Legislature of
those States, now in session. A letter
from Toursville, N. C, says;
In anticipation of this I saw twenty three
free negroes gel on the cara this morning to
leave tbe State, and it is a daily occurrence
to see numbers moving for tbe euuie pur
pose, Crlt is said that John Bell has prepared
an elaborate addreit to the American people
on the present crisis, taking atrong ground
againat tbe right of accession and tbe expe
diency of it, and demonstrating tbe ruin to
the border Statea which must follow the
Gulf Statea going out. Mr. Bell, it is un

Washington, on bis return to tbat city, on
Saturday evening last, and a brief sketch of
hia speech was given. Knowing tbat at this
particular juncture, the people of all partiea
will be anxious to see bis remarks in full,
we publish herewith the brief, but most hap
py speech of Mr. John F. Ennis, welcoming
Judge Douglas to Washington, with the re
ply of the latter:
MB. INKIS' SPEECH.
In behalf of the people, John F. Enni
Esq.' of Washington, addressed him as fol
lows: During the recent campaign, sir, a laree
number of the Democrats of this city, who
believed in the principles enunciated by the
Convention which nominated you at Balti
more, formed themselves into a political or
ganization called the Douglaa and Johnson
Democratic Association. I hey have come
here to-night to offer you a sincere and cor
dial welcome upon your return to this city,
ond to express to you their high admiration
of the noble and manly struggle yon have
made in defence ot those principles upon
which, they believe with you, rests the ex
istence and perpetuity of our institutions.
Cheets. But, sir, this welcome ia not
confined alone to your political friends,
You are surrounded by your personal friends,
neighbors, and acqnaintnnces who have re
sided with you in this city for years, and who
tike a pride in recognizing you almost as an
adopted citiuen of Washington, The rec
ords of Congress attest your claim upon
our gratitude. Cheer. Your voire wliich
has ever been heard in favor ol our glorious
Union, has never been silent when the Un
ion's capital wanted the hid ol s friend and
advocate upon the fljors of Cont'res.
'Good," and ' beers."
Fortius you hive the grateful thanks of
every citizen in this Diftriot. I need not
Miy to you that it is a pcurce of extreme
pleasure to us all to find you renewed rather
than impaired in health by your arduous Is
bors in the recer.t enmpaiijn. "Good" ond

prryer tlistyour life may be lung (-pared to
yr.ur country. Cheers. In the d ys of
its prosperity its destinies have often ben
guided by the wi-dom of your counsels, and
now, in the hour of its gloom and adversity,
we look trustingly to you (or your powerful
aid in dflivering us from the dangers and
difficulties which surround u?. Loud
cheers. May your life and atrengih be
ppsred tor this cdJitional effort. "Amen,"

SPEECH OF JUrcS DjUCLAS.
In reply, Judge Doughs siiJ:
Mr. Ennis, I tender to you, and through
you to those you represent, my sincere
thanks for this expression of your respect.
To be thus welcomed on my i.rrivnl by so
Ifitje.u number of citizens of Washington,
on fuch a cold and dreiry ni.-ht as this, U a
compliment of whish any mm miht well
be priiud, It ia true that I h' Vft lived among
you during the sessions of Congress 'or sev
enteen years, and have exchnnged with you
and ro(eived from you ac's of kindness which
rfmnin fresh in my hcort, and will Rlway
be cherished with pleasure. Chorrs To
be tliu3 received by those wlm know me
best, ai d who hav? bren person 1 witnesses
of liie mods in which I have heretofore di.
charged my public duties, I fully c-pprcc5 .te,
ar.d it inspires me with renewed energy to
(ullfil thote of the future. Cheers
It is true, as you have slid, tint from the
time the eanvnss opened I wns actively no
gaged in t'ho vindication of those rreat con
stitutional principles upon which I believe
this Union depends, and I was able to ftvr.v
my sentiments in the earne terms in the
Nor'h and in the Suuth, in the East and in
t lie Weft from Bangor, Maine, to JciferrtOii
City, in Missouri, and from the lufces to the
Gulf of Mexico. Cheers j So long as we
live under a Con:ti;uti n wh'cli is ths pu
prem9 Inw of nil the State, it ought to be
administered in. such a m-.nner as to impart
rq-.ial rights, cquM justice, ond equ'il pro'ta

'Thai'i right," end cheer I hold that
the integrity mid perpetuity ol this Republic
depend upon maintaining on the ulnverv
question that great principle -of non-intervention
which eays to every people, regulnte
your own domestic: affairs in your own way,
subject only to the Conatiimio i ol tho Uni
ted States. 'Good," and cheors. Thi
vexed question of slavery existed when our
fsthtrs framed the Constitution, as well as
now; and if we only curry out the principle
upon which they made the Government, we
can preserve the Union, and transmit it to
our latent posterity. "G.id b'ess you, and

I read in tho cars the other day, on my
wny to this city, the patriotic and eloquent
speech of the gallant Stephen of Geurgia.
"liurruh for Douglas and Stephens," and
lung continued applnure, and that speech
inspired me with the hope thai there was
still virtue enough left to save the Union.

and cheers.
These five propositions embraced all that
Georgia asked, ail thut,the Southern States
demanded, in the great contest o! 1850 '51.
I think they, were ju t then, and I believe
that the patriotism of this country, North
and South, will rally upon them now.
rCheers.
Mr. Stephens adds a sixth proposition, to
tbe effect that all State Legislation which
throws obstruction in the way of the faith
ful execution of the fugitive slave law, shall
be removed. I think these lawa ought to
bepealed, and furthermore tbat tbey never
should have been placed upon the statuts
books of any State of tbia Union. Cheers.
Tbe Constitution doclares tbat fugitive
slaycs shall be delivered up, : Tbs Supreme
Court has decie'ed tbat tbe Federal Govera
ment possesses the power,' and it Is Its dtrty ,
to surrender tbem op, and also tbat toe ex
elusive power of legislation upon tbat sub
ject is in Congress, and not in the States.
If that proposition be true and ao tbe Court
has adjudged it necessarily fortows, aa an
invariable rnle of conatitntional law, that a
doty imposed carries with it the means of
ita faithful execution. Great applause.
Hence I hold tbat it Is tbe duty of Con
gress instantly to remove all obstructions
whicb may be thrown in the way of the en
forcement of tbe Constitution and the laws,
whether those obettfetipps be imposed by
State legislation qr ?b "any other manner
whatsoever. Cheers.1 Let us, then, rally
around the Constitution as onr forefathers
made it, perform all our duties under it, pro
tect every right guarantied by it, and pre
serve the Union forever for our posterity.
Cheers.
Sir, you have alluded to my bearing during
tbe late political contest. I can only say
that I did no act and uttered no word during
the whole ol that csnvaea that my judgment
and my conscience doaat now fully approve.
"Good," and immense applause. The
contest is over, and let all the asperities, ill
feeling, and strife engendered by it be bu
ried with it. Let the pest be referred to
only as furnishing lessons of wisdom for the
future, and let all Union men, all Constitu
tion loving men, unite as a band of brothers
to save the country first, and quarrel after
wards aa to who shall govern it. Cheers.
It is true that the election ha terminated
in a manner unsatisfactory to the Union men
of the country. No man regrets the result
more than I do not from considerations
personal to myself, but aa affecting the
peace and safely of tlin country. That's
so," and cheers. But the question arises
whether it is the part of patriots to destroy
the bast Government that the sun ol Heaven
ever shone upon, merely because a man hns
been elected, and a party hns been triumph
ant, whose principles are obnoxious tit us
I declare thut the election ol any man by
the American people, according to the Con
Mi'.ution of our country, lurnish.es no cause,
n excuse, for dissolving the Union.
"Good." and rh-er Su long as ho ob
serves his oath of office, by seeing the liws
I ith ully ex'-cutpd, he should be supported
in all Conftitutional measures by all patri
otic men, and if he disregard his oath, vio
lates the Constitution, m'ikea wor up n any
section, or upon the rights of any man, he
should then bo held to the strictest account
ability provided in the Constitution.
Wha htirm can thi Republican President
do, even if he be so disposed ! He is in a
minority in both Houses ot Congress, he is
iii a minority ol tne people oi tne united
Slates, "ThVs so," mid cheers, mid he
has no power except that cosfernd by the
Constitution and the laws. Il he does not
strictly perform his duly we will impa ich
him. Cher.. What harm then, I rnp-at
cnnhedol He cm do no act except dis
tiibute the patronage of tlie Government,
and in the exercise f that power he is re
strained by the Senate, which cin confirm
or reject nil of his prinrip-.t appointments.
Cheers. Thn, fellow-citizens, 1 beseech
y.'i), withuut retereitce to torm-r pirty di
visions, to lay asids all politico! asperities,

A Domestic View or Secession.
The New York Tim-:s gives an extract
trom a private letter from a lady io Stuth
Carolina to her uncle in New York. The
letter says:
I thudder for the wives and mothers, sis
ters and bribes of S tith Carolina, as I con
template the immediate fu ure of the St- te.
You need not be curprised at any time to see
me and the children in your midst, lor no
argument could induce mo to remain here
an h ur longer than I should be compelled
to, il the worst should come to the worst.
We tremble in our own h 'mes in antici
pation and expectancy oi wh.it is liable to
hurit tortli m any momenta negro msur
rection Nut n nii:ht pusses thut we do not,
not only secun ly luck our field servnnts in
their quarters, but our most loved and valued
hou.-'f si.'rv:i..ts, who in erdlnorr limes we
wuu-d trust to any extent, are watched and
iu irdrd iigni ist with all the scrutiny and
c ire we possess. Our planters and owners
ot stuve. properly do not alow our servants
to huve i.ny intercourse with each other, and
the negroes are confined strictly to the prem
i.-es where they belong. We are ail obliged
to increase our torce of overseers to prevent
too free intercourse even among our own
servants. Tbe negroes feel, and notice
these new restraints, and naturally ask
' Why ie this!" But is unnecessary for them
to ask the question, lor they a,i comprehend
the cause an well as we who own them.
They have already learned nwayA to give
them an idea of what is going on tit the (State
and nation, and this knowledge they have not

U S. Treasury Report.
This reOort is so nnnenall hrlef iii?
ly to require an abstract. A few facts called
from it may illustrate tbs delightful condi-
iioa or toingson the SOtber June, 1860
The permanent national debt was $45,089 j
80S 08, and tbe outstanding treasury notes
19,690,500, making together 864.769,
703.03, aa the oett result of Mr. Cobb's
tinkering. Tbe deficiency of eatimated
etna for the service of tbe fiscal year end
ing June 80, 1801, ia 91,876,834.53. Tbe
Secretary telle us in his report that already
the treasury baa been seriously effected by
tbe commercial revulsion; that tbs receipts I
from customs have fallen off creatlv: that
the limited amount received fs composed
eacn a ay ot an Increased proportion of ire a a
ury notes not yet due; that the indications
are that such will, at least for the oreaent.
continue to be tbe case; that In consequence
of the failure of biddera for tbe late loan to
comply with tbe terms of tbeir bids, a por
tion of the ordinary revenues baa been with
drawn from the ordinary aourcea of expendi
ture to meet the payment of treasury notes
past due, and the interest thereon; end, fi
nally, tbat tbe-early action of Congresa will
be required to enable the department to car
ry on the operations of the government, and
at the aame time preserve the public credit
unimpaired. Mr. Cobb's measures of relief
are these : ,
To meet the remaining outstanding treas
ury notes and interest thereon there is yet
to be negotiated eleven millions of stock
authorized by the act of June 22,1860.
The statement just made of the difficulties
attending the payment for the stock already
aold, in connection with the fact that capi
talists in the present condition of the country
seem unwilling to invest in United States
stock at par, renders it almost certain tbat
this remaining eleven millions cannot now
be negotiated upon terms acceptable to the
government. The condition of the Treasury-is
such that no serious delay can be in
dulged. I recommend, therefore, a repeal
of so much of tbe act of June 22, 1860, as
authorizes the issuing of this additional
eleven millions ef stock, and that authority
be given for the issuing of treasury notes to
the same amount, to be negotiated at such
rates as will command the confidence of the
country.
To create that confidence, I recommend
thot the public lands be unconditionally
pledged for the ultimate redemption of oil
the treasury notes which it may become ne
cessary to issue. I make this recommend-
ation of substituting treasury notes for stock
the more readily from tbe conviction that
there should always exist in the department,
power to issue tre.eury notes for a limited
amount under the direction of the President,
to meet unforeseen contingencies. Il is a
power which can never be abused, us the
amount realized Irom such source en only
b used to meet lawful demmds uoon the
Treasury No Secretary of the Treasury
or President would ever exercise it, except
compelled to do so by the exigencies of the
public service. On the other hand, it would
enable the government to meet wi hout em
barrassment those sudden revulsions to
which the country is always liable, and
which cinnoc alwuys be anticipated.
I huve already sluted thut provision should
be made at onee to relieve the Treasury
from its present embarrissmenis, produ. ed
by the causes referred t . To do this, Con
gress sh mid autho izo the issuing ot an ad
ditional amount of treasury notes, not less
th.in ten millions of dollars. With these
means, the department will be enabled to
meet all lawful demands upon it for the pre
sent. The extent ol (he financial crisis
torouh which the cou itry is now passing
cm not now bo determined, and, until it is
butter known, no policy on be recommend
ed of a permanent character.

The present receipts from all quarters are

The Committee on Ways and Means meet
to morrow, to consider what form and what
mai ner of relief shall be needed.
The first question will be whether to con
vert the $12,000,000 of uncancelled loans
into treasury notes, and to give the Secreta
ry the $10,000,000 addition!, as asked in
his report, or to mnke a thorough investiga
tion of the treasury, and provide at once for
its full wants.
Information here states that a force of
3,000 strong was organized in South Caro
lina, for the purpose of taking the forta
there, whenever the Government shall re
fue to relinquish them after secession.
Notwithtnding the threatening attitude
rf South Carolina, there is reason to know
thitthe most discreet and trusted advisers
here have writtun to the managers there,
counselling against any demonstration what
ever, by which a collision might be precipi
tited or blood shed.

Mr. Hunter, as a matter of fact, will have

The telegraph a few days since noticed
tbe arrest of s train boy on the Chicago,
Burlington & Quiney R. R. for robbing the
mail. He baa bees committed for trial
He called himself Hudson, but bis real name
is John Campbell. Tbe Chicago Journal
says !
He is the so if tit Alexander Campbell, a
very worthy and esteemed Scotchman a
retired clergyman residing at Newport,
St. Clair Co., Michigan, on the River St.
Clair, midway between the lake of tbat
name and Lake Huron. He ia about twen
ty. one and of youthful appearance for bia
age. For tbe paat three months be baa oc
cupied the position oi train boy, in Which be
was engaged at tbe time of bis arrest.
During that time be has robbed the mails
of an amount of mail matter in face value,
reaching upwards of twelve thousand dollars.
He declared that he bad no accomplice, and
thia is made probable by the nature and value
of the stolen drafts and Land Worrarita found
in his trunk at the Marble Pillar Saloon near
the Illinois Central It. R. depot, whicb one
more expert in crime would undoubtedly
have at once realized upon in some manner,
instead of which, young Campbell bad bid
tbem away.
His manner of robbing the mail was to
select always one of the canvass sacks, in
too common use, and aa he lay upon the
pile, break up and crush apart the packages
in (he bag, then slowly work them down to
the mouth, where, by introducing a finger or
two, the letters would be drawn out. He
never opened a mail bag, and yet once ac
tually abstracted the entire contents of a bag
sent from Chicago to Quinccy, leaving no
thing but the wrapping paper and twine of
the packages within, to the greatest mystifi
cation of the Poet Office officials.
He makes a full confession, and indeed
everything is too clear against him to admit
of a delence. He is entirely broken down
by his terrible position, and wept bitterly.
