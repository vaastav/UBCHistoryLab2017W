t
Urne the committee should plve to the sub
ject the more thoroughly the public would
be convinced of the falrm-ss of Its position,
when ultimately taken. They dwelt at Pom?
length upon the charge that the attorney
general, previous to entering upon the
duties of that otllce, had Uen attorney for
the United States Steel Corporation and
the armor-plat manufacturers. In reply
to these accusations it was said that it was
legitimate for an attorney In private life
to represent any Interest in hi official
capacity, and it was argued that his posi
tion as coun.s-Ior for those Interests could
not be used legitimately against him in
connection with his nomination to a posi
tion under the present administration. So
lon as he had conducted himself with
propriety his relationship as an attorney
should not be ued to his injury as an of
ficial. The vote on the motion to recommit
was lost. The ballot stood U to 7. There
was no roll call on the motion to confirm,
which Immediately followed.
Other nominations confirmed were: John
C. Ames, United States marshal for the
Northern district of Illinois; Charles P.
Hitchcock. United States marshal for the
Southern district of Illinois.

between Secretary Hay and Mr. Rrun, the
Danish minister, the last obstacles of sub
Btance to the preparation of the treaty of
cession whereby the United States will be

The tieclsion of the Supremo Court in the

OIITAI.S AX IJLCTIO. ACiAIXST
LEA (l'E PRESIDENT SPALDING.
Court AIiio HefttrultiH Delivery of Rec
ortlt Spalding AkhIii Declare Ilia
Opponent Out of Haseball.
. NEW YORK. Dec. 1C Andrew Freedman
obtained an Injunction late this afternoon
in the Supreme Court through counsel to
restrain A. G. Spalding from assuming
the presidency of the National Raseball
League and from Interfering with the busi
ness of the National League In any way.
The order further restrains Nicholas E.
Young from delivering to Spalding any of
the books, records, or papers of the league.
The defendants are ordered to show causo
before Jude Holt Dec. 1J why the injunc
tion should not be made permanent.
In this action Mr. Freedman represented
the New York, Roston, Cincinnati and St.
Louis baseball clubs, these four being the
organizations, who-e respective presidents
left the meeting of the National League
magnates at the Fifth-avenue Hotel early
on Saturday morning. Mr. Freedman de
clares to-night that there shall be no
further controversy between him and Mr.
Spalding, who stands as the representative
of the other four clubs In the National
League Urooklyn, Philadelphia, Chicago
and rittsburg. He asserts that whatever
future action may be taken to settle the
light in the league will be taken In the
courts.
Mr. Spalding gave out In the evening
copies of telegrams he had received from
P. T. Powers of the Eastern League, and
Ran Johnson of tho American League, in
which these two men promised their co
operation to Mr. Spalding. Mr. Spald'ng
Is authority for the statement that the
final steps in the proposed process of put
ting Mr. Freedman out of the National
League, rests with the stockholders of the
New York club. "I am the president of
the National League," declared Mr. Spald
ing. "1 shall be present to preside at the
future meetings of the league. In view
of his actions I defy Andrew Freedman to
come to the meetings of the league. I
therefore declare him out cf baseball. The
Freedman incident is closed."
It was the opinion of many to-night that
the only means by which Mr. Freedman
could bo put out of the league was through
the disruption of that body. It was sug
gested that an amalgamation of the Ameri
can and National leagues might take place
and a twelve-club circuit adopted. Mr.
Spalding made what was taken to be a
significant remark to-day In connection with
this when he said: "It may not be so easy
to get playing grounds in New York, but
neither will it be so easy to cut streets
through grounds after Jan. 1."
When Mr. Spalding and his followers be
gan their meeting this afternoon, Mr.
Spalding read a letter in which he notified
Freedman of the hour of to-day'a meeting,
asked him to be present and offered to de
bate their differences. The closing para
graph was: "You may consider this a pub
lic challenge to meet me in public debate
on this baseball question. ' Freedman or
Spalding must get out of the game for
good. It's up to you, Mr. Freedman. 'Play
ball.' "
Then Spalding read a letter from a legal
firm of this city in which the lawyers taid
they had read the minutes of the meeting
at which Spalding was elected president
and gave it as their opinion that ha had
been regularly and legally elected presi
dent. Mr. Spalding then took up his firm's at
titude In furnishing baseballs to the league.
Tho contract with the league was made ten
years ago. A vota was taken and It was
decided that contract should be renewed.
The firm furnishes 150 balls to each club
each season free of charge, all others be
ing purchased at $15 per dozen.
During the day Spalding had received a
letter from Henry Chadwick, of Brooklyn,
In which Chadwick upheld his course.
Chadwick has teen getting a pension irom
the league of $,"0 a month and after his
letter was read Spalding moved that it be
made $luJ and this was done, the matter to
be finally passed at a future meeting.
W. II. Conant, of Roston, said to-night
he did not see how Mr. Freedman was to
be got out of baseball. "There is only
one provision in the constitution," he said,
"under which lie can be expelled non
payment of dues. I guess the thing won't
go much further." Mr. Conant said emi
nent counsel had declared Spalding's elec
tion illegal.
Mr. Soden, of Roston, said to-night: "We
took the matter into court so that we could
have an opinion as to the validity of
Spalding's election. The case Is entirely a
friendly one. We simply .want to know
where we stand that we may know how to
proceed."

inoperative from floods. Many districts are
inaccessible because of bad roads. Tele
graphic and telephone communication,
though interrupted between numerous
points, has stood the strain well.
Up to to-night one death has been report
ed, that of a German named Patten on the
Canadian Pacific Railroad, whose engine
plunged into a washout. A similar acci
dent on the Maine Central resulted In the
Injury of three persons, one of whom may
die. Madison, on the Upper Kennebec river,
sustained the greatest damage from floods
of any place, it being fully half a million
dollars. Logs and ice crushed buildings
and overturned many others, especially in
one section of the town, where there are
large mills.
The watt-r. when at its highest, was three
feet beyond the highest record in the great
"pumpkin freshet" of A million feet
of lumber was washed away. The. Great
Northern Paper Company's loss Is very
heavy. Its expensive electrical machinery
was ruined, and Ufte en carloads of finished
paper were destroyed.
FLOOD AM) COLD WAVE.
Had Night for PlttburRer Danger
Over Yesterday Morning?.
PITTSBURG. Dec. 16. The crest of the
flood and the lowest point reached this
winter . by the mercury were both regis
tered at the same time, S a. m., when the
Smlthfleld-street bridge marks showed
twenty-live feet eight inches of water in
tho Monongahela river, and tho govern
ment thermometer Indicated five degrees
above zero. Tho rivers are now falling
here and at the headwaters, and the tem
perature Is steadl.'y rising.
A flood and cold wave at the same time
Is almost unprecedented and only the sud
den drop In the temperature averted one
of tho greatest fiood In the history of
Pittsburg. As it was the lover parts of the
Point di.stiict and Du'iutsne and lowlands
nlon th Mononir.theli river. South Side.
were submerged. In Alleghany the river
front was entirely under water, including
lMttsburg & Western, Lacock t Robinson,
Hope. Balcan, Walnut, Cherry, Madison
and River avenues. The cellars In many
houses were flooded and people were com
pelled to move. Along the banks of the
Alleghany and Pittsburg it was the most
fearful night experienced in many years.
Similar conditions have been practically
unknown to this generation. Hundreds of
men tolled all night with the gigantic coal
tows, tied up to the landings on both sides
of all three rives, in the face of a bitterly
oold wind, drenched at times with the
splashes of foam, their clothes frozen on
them Immediately, and the suffering was
awful. Never in the history of Pittsburg
was there such a flood on such a night.
The rains and snow of the past three da'3
caused the upper tributaries of the local
rivers to swell, and the result was a rise
almost unknown at this season of the year.
Warning was sent out from the weather
bureau that a flood stage was possible, and
even probable, but the suddenness with
which the cold air descended on Saturday
night Influenced the minds of the men who
were guarding the big coal fleets, and the
rise came as almost a complete surprise
to them. Usually a cold snap takes all the
life and danger out of a flood. It failed
to do so vesterday and as a result the
freshet will cost hundreds of thousands
of dollars that might have been saved.
The damage to goods in the wharves In
warehouses, stores and private houses In
the two cities will never be known. It
probably will reach $'.000. In addition
to this many mills and factories along both
rivers were forced to close down tempo
rarily and thousands of men and women
will be out of work from one to three
days and much damage done to machinery
and finished stock
At midnight the Ohio river mark at the
dam registered 21.3 feet and falling six
inches an hour. Davis island dam is piled
high with wreckage of runaway coal
barges, but It is believed this will be suffl
ciently cleared away by Wednesday to al
low the passage south of about 15,000.000
bushels of coal ready for shipment on this
rise.
Ohio IllftliiK nt Cincinnati.
CINCINNATI, Dec. 16. The thermometer
registered 13 degrees above zero at 7
o'clock to-night, but tho Weather Bureau
predicts colder weather before morning.
The Ohio river has been rising rapidly at
almost every point between here and Pitts
burg. At Portsmouth it Is rising six
inches an hour and has already reached
a thirty-one-foot stage. At 6 o'clock
to-night the stage in thi3 city was
27 feet 8 inches, a rise of 4 feet and 6
inches since 6 o'clock this morning. The
river men here are of the opinion that 4√ú
feet will be reached by Thursday morning,
after which a fall is anticipated. The rise
above caught the river men unprepared
and many towboats were torn from their
fastenings, but nearly all of them were
recovered before much damage was done.
Half n Million Damage.
UTICA, N. Y., Dec. 1C The damage from
the flood in the valley of the West Canada
creek will reach RuO.000. From 75.000 to
100,000 logs were washed away from Nobles
boro. Hinckley and Trenton Falls. Four
expensive railroad bridges were destroyed.
One mill was taken down stream like a
paper box. and two others are badly
wrecked. The railroad in that valley can
not be operated for four or five days. The
electric power plant at Trenton Falls was
damaged about $3,000.

DANGER AVERTED BY COLD. A fall

the danger of flood in western Massa
chusetts. DAMAGE IN NEW JERSEY. More than
tlOO.OuO damage has been caused at Scud
der's Falls and South Trenton by the sud
den rising of the Delaware river.
FACTORIES CLOSED. Many industrial
establishments in South Harrisburg, Pa.,
have been forced to close down on account
of the freshet, the water in that locality
being higher than at any time sipce the
great flood of 1SS9. Cellars of scores of
houses in that locality are filled with
water and It was necessary to use boats
to carry food and fuel to many residents
who were unable to leave their homes.
WATER-BOUND DELEGATES. Com
munication with the outside world Is being
gradually opened up at Scranton, Pa. Yes
terday a train started for Philadelphia and
New York over the Delaware & Hudson
and the Pennsylvania Railroads via Sun
burg and Harrisburg. carrying some of
the delegates who had attended the Ameri
can Federation of Labor convention. The
others left to-night.
LOSS OF $100,000. Insurance and real
estate agents agree that the loss at Beth
lehem. Pa., where 200 houses and a score
of industrial establishments were inun
dated, will aggregate 1100,000. Silk mills,
electric light plants, water works and a
dozen other industries are so badly dam
aged that it will require another day or
two to get them into condition for re
sumption of operations. The town was
again in darkness last night.
SLOWLY RECEDING. The high water
in the north branch of the Susquehanna
river is slowly receding, says a dispatch
from Wilkesbarre, Pa. At 9 o'clock last
night it was twenty-five feet above the
low water mark or two feet and one inch
lower than the highest point attained Sun
day night. All the lowlands, however, are
still flooded, and the people living at West
more and the southern suburbs are unable
to leave their houses without the aid of
boats. The bursting of a dam at Parsons,
where water was stored for the mines in
the vicinity, did much damage.

ANOTHER SHALL FIGHT.
Colombian Faetions Meet nt TV ombre
De DIos Other Movements.
COLON, Colombia, Dec. 16. A schooner
which has just arrived here from a town
on the Caribbean coast called Nombre De
Dlos, brings the news that the Colombian
government troops, to the number of sev
enty, who left Colon a fortnight ago for
Viento Frieto, had an engagement with
the Liberal forces at Nombre De Dios last
Friday. The Liberals numbered 250 men,
chietiy recruits from along the coast. They
were badly armed, the majority carrying
nothing but machetes. They were fairly
well intrenched, however, and in the n
gaxement the casualties of toth shits
amounted to eighteen men killed and forty
wounded. The government troops suc
ceeded in carrying the entrenchments and
driving out the Liberals from th.j town
back into the hills.
Nombre De Dios is the center of Ameri
can manganese mining interests. Thre
Is a railroad running from this port nine
miles back into the country, but owln
to the unsettled condition of affairs traf
iic on the railroad and mining operations
have been suspended during the past
month.
The gunboat General PInzon, with 10)
troops on board, left here this morning for
Code, where the Liberal forces are fairly
numerous. She will try to rid this part
of the coast of Liberal bands and also
will be on the lookout to Intercept Gen
erals Porras and Lorenzo should they u.
tempt to reach any Atlantic port from
which, it is believed, they would sail to
Costa Rica in quest of reinforcements, am
munition, etc.
The Conservative soldiers landed here by
the General Pinzon, now garrison all the
stations along the railroad between Colon
and Panama in detachments of from twenty-five
to loO men.
INDUSTRIAL PEACE.
("CONCLUDED FROM FIRST PAGE.)
neany all or the large concerns that are
large employers of skilled labor.
"On the other hand, the workmen have
been educated to look upon capital as the
common enemy rather than a benefactor.
Capital has always fought organized labor
with a view to destroying their unions, and
the unions have felt that to exist they had
to keep up a constant struggle.
"No one coulu expect, under such condi
tions, anything but the long succession of
extensive strikes, that have cost many mil
lions of dollars in wages as well as in loss
of business. In the last two or three years
much progress has been made, and the
leaders of capital as well as the leaders of
labor have had their eyes opened as to
what may bo accomplished in the way of
getting together.
"I should call the presevnt .movement a
mutual disarmament in the industrial
world. To nothing can it be rnore aptly
likened than the disarmament of Europe. I
would disarm capital of its antipathy to
trades unions and of its ruinous policy that
has too often ruled in the past. I would
disarm labor of .its distrust of capital and
of it3 desire to'place union ahead of the
material welfare of the men who work."
"When did you first become interested in
this movement that has culminated in the
New York conference?"
"I first met some gentlemen who were
engaged in the work soon after the settle
ment of the anthracite coal strike in
I do not mind saying now that the settle
ment of that strike was brought about
through making the capitalists who owned
the coal railroads and the coal companies
see that it was to their interest to meet the
men and talk it over.
"Yes, I admit that I had something to do
with it, but the result is what I want to
speak of. These men who have been edu
cated to fight labor at all times, were
brought together to meet the leaders of the
anthracite labor leaders in J. Pierpont
Morgan's office in New York. The result
was that the strike was ended over night.
What was effected then brought the gen
tlemen who were Interested in the indus
trial bureau of the Chic Federation to ask
me to join in" their movement. They told
me they were trying to establish, in all
walks of industrial life, what had been ac
complished in the way of settling the coal
strike. I joined heartily with them, and
since then have been doing everything In
my power to interest prominent men in the
movement."
"Do you think a rule can be laid down to
which labor and capital will agree that will
result In preventing labor troubles in tho
future?"
"I do. It will be made a success If untir
ing effort can do it. The last great strike
we had was the steel strike. That could
have been prevented if it had been taken
in time. Rut mistakes had been made and
the matter got ia such a shape that the
strike had to go on. I don't mind saying
that the Amalgamated Association at one
time during that strike offered to leave the
whole matter to me as arbiter, but at that
time the strike had got. into such shape
that the other side, although they had the
utmost confidence in the proposed arbi
trator, could not arbitrate.
"I will say, however, that the strike was
finally adjusted through the efforts of the
Civic Federation. Men like Ralph M. Eas
ley, of Chicago, and Professor Jenks, of
Cornell University, brought the thing
about.
"The conference which terminated the
strike was not easy to be had. I went to
Mr. Schwab, of the United States Steel
Corporation, myself and urged him to at
tend another conference. He finally con
sented to seo Professor Jenks. As a result
the strike was declared off and Mr. Schwab
has frequently thanked me for bringing
him around on that subject.
"There Is another incident connected with
that strike which I will speak of more fully
some time In the future. I will refer to it
only briefly now, to show what may be ac
complished by conciliation when a grave
danger confronts the country.
"At one stage of the struggle between the
United States Steel Corporation and the
Amalgamated Association a Fympathetlc
strlko was threatened. It was gravely im
minent, and if it had been ordered it would
have tied up all of the transportation lines
of the country, and there Is no telling
where It would have ended or how exten
sive would have been the panic that would
have followed. In many lines of labor the
men were anxious to strike.
"A conference was held In Cleveland,
which was attended by officials of most of
the big labor organizations. Officers of the
Amalgamated Association were present. I
know just what happened, for I was there.
The latter leaders were told of the re
sponsibilities that they would have to as
sume If they took the extreme step con
templated. As a result of the efforts made
at that time, the sympathetic strike was
averted. I believe in the future we will be
able to accomplish great things in the way
of adjusting these disputes before they
reach the acute stage."
