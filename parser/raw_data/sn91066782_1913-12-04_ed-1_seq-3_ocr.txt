SAYS PRESIDENT
OF THE ROAD
Jtesis of Agreement with the
Department of Jus
tice Found
' Washington, Dec. 4. Conferences yes
terday between Attorney General Mc
Reynolds and Chairman Elliott of the
Kew Haven board developed a situation
which made both officials confident that
GAS OH THE STOMACH
Uae Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for This
Form of Indigestion, k
It is a poor treatment for stomach
trouble that treats the stomach alone.
Back of all your lack of appetite, sourness
of stomach, belching of gas, nausea, pains
after eating, heaviness and lump-like feel
ing in the stomach, is bad blood. The
food is fermenting m the stomach, only
partly digested, because the stomach is
weak.
Take Dr. Williams' Pink Pills and
notice the difference in your condition.
You will be able to eat three good meals
a day without discomfort.
The new blood, which Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills make, will restore the stom
ach to its normal condition, positively
strengthen the digestive organs and in
crease the flow of digestive fluids.
Do not put off finding relief a single
day. Get a box of Dr. Williams' Pink
Pills today and begin treating yourself.
a basis of dissolution would be agreed
upon.
This would restore competition in New
England transportation and meet the
government's demands in the near future
without a court fight.
All the parties to the conference, which
lasted several hours, mutually agreed not
to disclose what went on.
It was, however, understood that At
torney General McReynolds hopes for a
settlement of the problem which he re-
regards as one of the two most intricate
which has yet come before him, some
time during the winter. Whatever is to
be done is to be accomplished without
unnecessary hardship to the railroad or
the stockholders. ,
Further conferences will develop the
situation as it proceeds.
The government has been insisting on
the dissolution of the Boston & Maine
merger and a correction of practically
all the conditions which were assailed in
the recent report of the interstate eom-
nreree commission after its investigation
of the financial affairs of the New Haven.
Chairman Elliott and the attorneys for
the railroad and some of its allied lines
devoted several hours before the con
ferences began to going over points in
the originally proposed agreement that
were not satisfactory to Mr. McReynolds.

BANDIT KILLS BANK MANAGER.
Escapes with $10,000 but He Is Pursued

Plum Coule, Man., Dec. 4. A lone
masked bandit yesterday afternoon held
up the Bank of Montreal,- -stole $10,000
in currency, shot and killed the bank
manager, 1L M. Arnold, who attempted
o. follow him to the bank door, and

Lima, Tent, Dec. 4. Mrs. Theodore
Roosevelt and Miss Margaret Roosevelt,
her niece, who reached here Monday
evening, have left for Balboa, Panama.
They were received at the palace by
President Billinghurst earlier in the day,
and the president personally conducted
them around the gardens. They visited
the principal points of interest in the
president's automobile.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 4. The adop
tion of a resolution calling upon Presi
dent Wilson to send to Congress imme
diately a special message advocating an
amendment to the constitution, giving
the suffrage to women, was the feature
of yesterday's session of the National
Woman Suffrage association's conven
tion. Mrs. Med ill McCormick of Chicago, the
author, will take the resolution to the
White House to-day.
Beyond a doubt, the House committee
on rules, before which this week the
suffragists and the anti's are pleading
their respective cases, will grant the
reouest of the suffragists and create a
regular committee of the House on
woman suffrage. Such is the general
feeling on the part of the women them
selves, and nothing at the capitol has
come up to contradict this impression.
If President Wilson in his message of
Tuesday disappointed the suffragists by
ignoring their cause, it is expected that
the House will make up that political
deficiency and concede the desired com
mittee. The suffragists, as a matter of fact,
are already discounting this victory in
advance and are predicting that the new
committee may prove to be as capacious
and ready a "morgue" as has been the.

similar Senate committee. The suf
fragists say that the Democrats, in their
sharp competition with the Progressives
for popular favor in 11)14 and 1H10, real
ize fully that women have votes in
about a dozen states already, and that
the voteless women in the nun-suffrage
states are becoming more and more of a
political embarrassment to statesmen
who oppose them. One hears freourmt
reference, for instance, to Miss Marga
ret Foley's defeat of Levi P. CJreenwood
for the Massachusetts legislature, and
it is very plain that the women from
other states are preparing to carry on
the same kind of warfare at home. For
these reasons alone, it is believed that
the House will at least flirt with the
federal suffrage amendment "for some
months, if not years.
There are signs that the suffragists in
as well as out of their convention are
gradually turning their attention tooth
er activities than that of getting votes
for women. Government ownership of
railroads, for example, is already an is
sue favorably looked upon by many of
the delegates. Another issue is that of
white slavery, and a flier is being dis
tributed about town urging the women
to bring pressure upon the House to pass
the so-called Ketiyon red-light bill, the
object of which is to close the red-light
district of Washington by enjoining the
owner of property used for such pur
poses. This bill is in .effect in eleven
states and has Always been supported by
the women. It has twice been passed
by the Senate, but has been allowed to
die in the House. A group of the most
active women delegates will try to put
the convention on record as favoring this
legislation.

Defense in the Craig Murder Trial As
serts That Dr. Knabe Was
Too Masculine.
Shelbyville, Ind., Dec. 4. Dr. Helene
Knabe, the beautiful Indianapolis wom
an physician, whoso mysterious death
was followed by the indictment of Wil
liam B. Craig on the charge of murder,
will be pictured by the defense in the
murder trial here as a woman to whom
lovek in the commonly accepted sense,
was unknown.
This will be the answer of Dr. Craig's
attorneys to the charge made by the
prosecution, that the veterinarian's and
Dr. Knabe's friendship had ripened into
love, and that when Craig tired of Hel
ene Knabe he entered her apartments
at midnight and cut her throat.
In eross-examination of physicians,
close associates of Dr Knabe, who were
among the first to visit her apartments
on the morning of Oct. 24, 1911, after
an office girl had found the woman phy
sician dead in her bed, the defense took
every opportunity to emphasize her mas
culinity. Several physicians testified she
was so masculine that her associates
called her simply Knabe, as if she were
a man.
Coroner Durham of Marion county,
who persistently held to the murder the
ory in the face of the police declarations
of suicide, was the first witness to be
called to the stand when court convened
yesterday.
We expect to convince the mrv. too.
that a woman of the marvelous physi
cal development attributed to Dr. Knabe
could not have been murdered without
a violent struggle," said Attorney Spaan.
She would have put up a terrific fight
for her life. Vet there was no evidence
of a struggle. Everything points to
suicide."
Augusta Knabe, the school teacher
cousin of Dr. Knabe, and Katherine Mas
pherson, the office girl, who discovered
the body, are to follow the physicians
on the stand.
