The Legislature.
The Legislature of this State adjourned on Mon
day morning last, to meet again on the third Tues
day in May. .The late session occupied twenty one
days, and is the fourth session of this Legislature.
First, the regular session secondly, the aojourned
sesssion-thirdly, the called session fourthly, the
adjourned session, commencing November 23d, and
ending December 1 ii 1S3.
We publish to-day tiie closing proceedings of the
two houses, together wi.h the captions of the laws
and resolutions passed. Hereafter, as we can make
space for them, we shall publish in full all the im
portant acts and resolutions.
" We are under obligations to our Reporters, Messrs.
T. H. Hill and W. H. Finch, for the promptness and
accuracy with which they have made their reports
for the Standard.
We are glad that the Legislature has adjourned
to a day certain. That body owed it to itself to re
tain in its own hands the right to reassemble, to
act on questions which may come up for considera
tion. Nearly five months will intervene between
its adjournment and re-assembling in May; and
meanwhile the most important events are likely to
occur. The people will have ample time in which
to instruct their representatives, and we trust that
during this time their will may be publicly and un
mistakably pronounced.
It is a noteworthy fact that no resolutions were
introduced at this session endorsing the administra
tion of Jefferson Davis. If they had been, they
would have been promptly tabled.
Our columns are so much crowded to-day that
we have no space for Congressional proceedings.
But little, however, has been done thus far, though
a number of bills, resolutions of inquiry, &c, have
been introduced. Both houses have passed a bill
prohibiting substitutes in the army for the future,
and repealing all laws on the subject We shall
keep our " readers posted as to the action of Con
gress. Domestic Maxcpactcres. A friend has shown
us a gentleman's woolen shirt, knit byaJady in
Bertie, which is equal in all respects to the merino
article. The lady manufactured the'entire article
from wool produced in Bertie. The war has de
veloped much ingenuity and industry in the South,
especially aiming the ladies.
Mr. Walter J. Jones, of Caswell County, and
Mr. John C. Conrad, of Yadkin County, have
- been examined by the Supreme Court in Cham
bers, and admitted to the practice of the law in the
County Courts of this State.
We publish to day the scheme of the Secretary
of the Treasury for reforming the-currency. This
.scheme is endorsed by the President. The disease
is very bad, but the remedy is worse than .the dis
ease. Adopt this scheme, and the property of nine
teen persons will rapidly pass into the hands of the
twentieth. Instead of relieving the country, it will
add immeasuarably to its embarrassments Ad dis

amendment, that thi committee to whom was re

the enemy that their prisoners have not been given
Sufficient rations.
. Mr. Foote-said, tint, if the Yankee prisoners had
not got enough, it was the fjuit of the Commissary
General, Mr. Northrop, and his way of doing busi

Though he had injured the countrv more than the
enemy, he was retained in office. He was a pepper
doctor from South Carolina, and he looks more like
a vegetarian than any nmu he ever saw. He had

The President and his Favorite;.
In the House of Representatives, on Wednesday
last, Mr. Foofe, of Tennessee, submitted the follow
ing remarks on that part of the President's message
in which he ascribes our defeat at Chattanooga to
the want of courage .on the part of our troops. Tho
President, fn defiance of the wishes of tho whole
country, retains a favorite in command who has lost-
Tennessee, a part of Georgia, and a part of North
Carolina; and when inquiries are made as. to the
cause of the late great disaster at Lookout, and when
every ono is looking to the President for the truth
on the subject, he tells the country that his favor
ite is not to blamg, but that the responsibility for
the loss of that battle rests on a portion of our bravo
troops. But to the remarks of Gen. Foote :
" Mr. Foote moved, by way of amendment, that
tho committee to whom was referred that portion
of the President's message relating to military af
fairs be instructed to enquire into the cause of our
late disastrous defeat before Chattanooga, .and as
certain whether it was owing, as is formally stated
by the President in his message, to the want of valor
on tho part of our army, or to other causes.
Mr. Foote read from the President's message that
portion which alludes to the late battle before Chat
tanooga. He said he took issue with the President,
or with any one else who would charge our army
with a want of valor.- A more valiant body of
men the world never saw. Ho charged the Presi
dent with the responsibility of that defeat, and bo
could prove it When Bragg was in Kentucky he
said then he was incompetent and should be retired
from the array. At the battle of Perryville, when
he proposed to divide his army, a military council
was held and all his officers protested against it
More than nine months ago he had, with a number
of his colleagues, the wbvle delegation from his
Stale waited upon the President and respectfully
entreated him to remove General Bragg and place
Joe Johnson in command of that army. What was
the answer f It was not for him to Bay, but the
country knows. He had beon through the army in
Tennessee he had visited all the camps he had
talked with all the officers and he found nothing
but a feeling of distrust with Bragg. His army
had no confidence in him. He had driven all his
officers out of the army. He had mad a martyr of
Polk he had calumniated the gallant Breckinridge.
He was so constituted that he could not agree with
his officers. He was on bad terms even with Hardee.
This was well known. He had seen a letter from
Bragg to a member of- Congress a fact which could
not -be disproved in which he said that he could
not command that .army efficiently unless he could
get rid of twelve Brigadier-Generals and a regiment
of field officers.
The President had persisted in keeping Bragg in
office ag-.inst the protest of both the army and peo
ple. So he did with another favorite of bis Pem
berton. Although the Mississippi Legislature re
pudiated Pembertnn, and charged the loss of Vicks
burg to him," all the President ever did was to order
a court martial, which never did any thing but meet
for two days. Pemberton was still dear to the
President He was his bosom friend. While he
was here the President had entertained him in his
house. Nor was this all. What must he do, when
he goes South, but to take Pemberton along with
him. Wherever he went, Pemberton Was with him.
When he visited the army in Tennessee, and re
viewed it, he passed before our men with Pemb.er
ton on his side, but he was glad to know that, on
passing a portion of the army, a murmur rang along
tie lines, and the men pointed at Pemberton saying,
"There goes the traitor that sold Vicksbuig."
Just before the battle before , Chattanooga the
President agreed to dividing ai.d weakening the
army by detaching Longstreet s command, although
the enemy in front were, before Longstreet was sent
olf, far superior in numbers to our army. Our array
had been left but forty thousand men, as he learned
officially at the War Department while tho enemy's
force was estimated at one hundred to one hundred
and ten thousand. JlfJJLongstreet's command not
been sent away we should, in all human probability,
have won the battle. The President's visits to the
army had never brought out any good. They had
only been productive of disaster. Had he never
have gone up to tho army after the first battle of
Manassas our troops would hare taken Washington.
The President ordered Bragg to fight the battle of
Mt freesboro , and here again was the result of his
military counsels. Would to God' he would never
visit the army again.
The President had charged the army with a want
ofvalur, but he charged the President with gross
misconduct in retaining his favorites in office, and
with partialities and prejudices, which, if persisted
in longer, will prove fatal to our cause.
Mr. Foote said that the President hid charged his
(FooteV) constituency with a want of valor, and he
wanted the facts in the caso. If he was the only
man in the House who had the courage to cast a
vote of censure on the President for mihgningVir
brave army he should, at least, exercise that privi
lege. Mr. Miles, of South-Carolina, suggesting that tho
subject had best go to a select committee, for en
quiry, Mr. Foote withdrew his resolution."

Treasnrer's Report.
As the Legislature assembled soon after the close
of the present fiscal year, Mr. Treasurer Worth
thought it a suitable occasion to make an annual re
port to that body of the operations of his depart
ment ; and we have before us his report, copies of
which have been printed and laid on the .desks" of
members.
The receipts of the public fund for the year end
ing September 30th, 1863, amount to $16,208,440.
88, which,' together with the. balance due this fund
on the 30th. September, of $1,541,993 02, make
$17,750,373 90. Tho disbursements for the same
period were $15,078,922 97, leaving on hand on the
1st of October, $2,CT1,450 93. The receipts of the
literary fund for the same period were $508,782 54,
and the disbursements $281,591 43. These largf
receiptsnd expenditures' of the public fund are
mainly on account 6f the military establishment
maintained by the State for tho purpose of clothing
troops and purchasing supplies.
Statement A is an interesting and valuable table
prepared- by Mr. Worth, showing'the total amount
'of State bonds issued, date of issue, when due, by
what authority issued, and for what purpose. The
whole amount is $21,132,000, and of this amount
$8,949,500 were issued previously to the 20th
of May, 18G1, and are known as the old coupon
and registered bonds. The pSoda at which the
bonds of all kinds will fall due range from 1864 to
1893 ; the amount, however, which will fall due be
fore 1S82 is small, and will be easily provided for
by. the sinking fund. .
The'whole amount of the Stato debt is $26,226,
434 90, as follows : Bonded debt $21, 1.32,000,.treas
ury notes in circulation $3,329,828 90, Coupons
unpaid $1,156,183, temporary loans $608,423. The
whole amount of State treasury notes issued is $5,
235,075 05. Or these $1,905,246 15 have been
funded or otherwise withdrawn from circulation, leav
ing the above amount in circulation, of which $2,
145,043 90 are of small denominations, and unfund
able. Mr. Worth has issued as few treasury notes as
possible, but has used Confederate currency in all
his transactions when not positively directed by the
Legislature to pay out treasury notes. Tho result
is that while the treasury notes of other States are
only at par. North Carolina unfundable treasury
notes (ones and two)aresellingattwoforonc,and the
fundables at 250 to 260. In this, as well as many
other respecU that might be mentioned, he has ex
hibited eminent judgment and ability as a financier;
and it is fortunate for the State that she has such
an officer in this crisis.- We make the following
extracts from Mr. Worth's report:
TDE STATES INDEBTEDNESS,
Exhibit. A, shows the bonds outstanding against
the State, for what purpose, by what authority, and
at what date issued, when due, and amount. The
amount of these, bonds is $21,132,000, but in this
sum is embraced $l,500.t.0 J, deposited in England
as collateral security f r the delivery of cotton,
which tho State has contracted to deliver there.
The State h is purcbssed and fias on hand Cotton
probably worth as muth, ai the price agreed on, as
the debt we owe in EriUnd. The first clas of
bonds mentioned in this Exhibit, amounting to $ )3,
00'), I do not tiiiil mentionrd in tne reports of my
predecessor. They are over due, and I was not
aware that they were in existence until a number
of the class w-re presented for payment. At what
time they fell due I am unable to state, not having
been able to find any entry in the office showing
the da c of their issue, or the number and amount
issued. Thry are registered bonds ; and I find in
the office a book in which the holders of these bond
gave receipts for the semi-annual intetest, from,
which it appears that the total amount of them was
$37,000, The books show the payment of $3 17,
U0;, leaving unpaid $53,000.
Since the 1st of January last, I have sold to the
bank, tixyer cent, bonds, falling due January 1st,
1893, at par, to the amount of $2,665,500 in pay
ment of. this amount due to them for temporary
loans ; and as a means of supplying the Treasury
in January and February last, I sold to tho Com
missioner of the Sinking Fund, at par, out of the
same class of bonds, to the amount of $979,500 ;
and to others at an average premium of 3 percent.,
to the amount of $126,000.
The income of the Sinking Fund will probably
be much more than sufficient to pay the bonds fal
ling due in 1S64 and 1365.
The Farmer' Bnk and the Bank of Washington
say they have invested as much of their means in
stocks as their charters authorize them so to invest.
The latter bank, through us president, assures me
ol the willingness of tne bank to receivo the bonds
of the Statv if its charter were so amended as to
authorize it The latter expresses a preference that
the debt remain as it is, but says if compelled to
take payment in Confederate currency or the bonds
of the State, that the latter will be preferred.
I made known to the Banks of Wadesboro', the
Miners' and Planters' Bank and the Branches of
the Bank of Capo Fear at Salem and Washington,
in the early part of the year, my readiness to pay
them in Confederate currency or the 6 per cent.
bonds of the State, at par, at their option, and re
cently repeated the notice. The Bank of Wades
boro' postponed, in the first instance, to make any
decision, and does not respond to the second notice.
Ono of the directors of the Miners' and Planters'
Bank has lately assured me that they would shortly
present the note held y that Bank, and take State
bonds, and the two 1' inches of the Bank of Cape
Fear, upou a second 1. ,ticoto them some weeks ago,
reply that tho subject has been referred to the
principal Bink, from which I hive received no an
swer. All tho other Banks have accepted the State
bonds in satisfaction of the debits duo them for tem
porary roans, ammjnting to $2,665,500 ; the Branch
of .the Bank of Cape Fear, in this city, filed a pro
test, which was communicated to you at the Extra
Session in July last.
Exhibit F, shows the amount of Treasury notes
fundable 1st January, 1S66, or not fundable at all,
which this Department has been authorized to issue ;
the authority under which they have been or may
be issued ; their class ; when redeemable ; the
amount of each denomination authorized to be issu
ed ; the amount which has been issued, ancf the
amount which may still be issued. The notes,
which the Treasurer is still authorized to issue, are
as follows:
Notes fundable at pleasure of holder, $ 313,385
Notes fundable 1st January, ISC8, 2,795,280
N ti:.s of $1, $2 tnd $ ), not fnnd.bte, 1,050,80)
Notes of less denomination than $1, 319,161 95
' ' $4,528,629 95
Since the 15th February last, tho Treasury being'
amply supplied with Confederate money collected
from the Confederate givernment and other sources,
A have deemed it inexpe Heat to increase the indebt
edness of tho Sta'e by the issue of these notes,
excepting where required to da so. to certain coun
ties in posssssioi of the enemy, under the act pro
viding for the wives and families of soldiers in the
army ; and the denominations less than outs dollar,
which the necessities of business required for
change. As they all com band a considerable pre
mium over Confederate notes, if I were to pay them
to such claimants' as might prefer them, the whole
of them would be exhausted before I could use the
Confederate notes, and theJeSts of tho State un-
ecessarily increased, i n is policy will be continued

wise direct.
As an offsett to its indebtedness, the State holds
the bonds of the following Corporations, with which
she has exchanged her -bonds :
Western Railroad Company, $ 600,000
Wilmington, Charlotte ahd Ruther-
ford IL R. Co., ' 1,500,000
City of Raleigh, 48,000
Raleigh and Gaston Railroad Company, 100,000
Debt of Atlantic and N. C. R. R. Co. for
lofb under act of 1856, 400,000
$2. fl 19.000
Also, an unliquidated claim against trie Confederate
government, supposed to amount to about $4,000,-
000. The $1,500,000 sent to- Europe, as collateral
Security of cotton debt, in arriving at the real in
debtness of the Stateshould not be considered as a
debt because the State owns cotton, supposed to be
sufficient to pay the debt
In this connection it 6hould also be bome in mind
that the Commissioner's of the Sinking Fund hold
State stocks to the amount of $1,519,000, and Con
federate 7 per cent bonds to the amount of $300,
,Q00, and, besides the interest accruing on this Fund,
it is being rapidly increased by dividends from
Railroads.
I .have endeavored to co-operate in every legiti
mate way with the Commissioners of the Fund in
,n7.e81?S its income. The judicious manner in
" has been managed, ai.d its rapid increase,
derived from our large investments in works ot
internal improvements, gi?es the best assurance to
the holders of our bonds that they will bo punc
tually paid at maturity, and constitute one of the
chief elements of the high premiui which our
bonds command in the market The Commissioners
.of this Fund will probably report to you more fully
during your session.
- LCNATIC ASTLCM.
By the act of the first session of your honorable
body, the sum, of $125,000 was appropriated to the
support of the Lunatic Asylum for the years 1P63
and 1864, "provided the aggregate amount for such
year Bhall net exceed tho sum of $62,500,". Owing
to the depreciation of the currency, this sum proved
to be insufficient for the support of the Institution.
The drafts of the Executive Committee for the fiscal
year ending September 80th, 1863, which have been
paid, amount to 70,000; and since the 30th Septem
ber, 1863, their drafts have been paid to amount of
$45,000. Tt has happened, before, that the Treasu
urer has had to take the responsibility of over-pay.
ing tho appropriation for the support of this Insti
tution, and subsequent sessions of thj general As
sembly have ratified such payments.
At a period when currency and prices are so de
ranged, it is impossible to make estimates with rea
sonable approximation to accuracy, and it is a bad
practice lor the Treasurer to pay money not author
izedby law. I hope the General Assembly will
either authorize the Executive Committee to draw
for such sums as they deem necessary, or make such
other provisions as they may deem best to avoid the
evil.
APPKOPJUATION FOB TIIE SCPP0UT OP. SOLDIERS' FAMI
LIES. This appropriation of $ 1,000,006 contemplated tne
payment of ti.e whole sum at once. In January
and February last there was not enough money in
the Treasury to meet other drafts on it, and the on
ly means of raising this amount would have been
the sale of State bonds to an amount so large as
would have been likely to depreciate their value in
market Believing that the object of the appropriation
would be as well accomplished by paying this ap
propriation in Tour equal instalments, and that in
this way it could be met without recourse to the
sale of State bonds, I have adopted this course ; and
to save. expense and inconvenience to the County
Courts, I sent them drafts quarterly, and notified
them that if they would inform me in what bank it
would be most convenient to them to receive the
money, 1 would place funds in such bank Xo meet
the drafts. The banks have obligingly co operated
with me in cat ry ing out this plan.
These drafts have all been issued, but many of
them have not been presented for payment The
same is the case as to the warrants of the Comptrol
ler in favor of the Chairmen of the Board of Super
intendents of Common Schools.
It is believed that they are withheld in the hope
that at some future period payment may be had in
better currency.
BErTLEM :XT OP TUB STATE'S CLAIM ACAINST TIIE
SOUTHERN CONKEDEKACT.
Under the authority of the 5th section of the act
providing ways and means for supplying the Treas
ury, ratified 20ih December, 1862, I appointed P.
II. Winston, E-;q , of Bertie, to collect the debt due
to this State from the Confederate government As
soon as the vouchers could be put in order by the '
State Auditor, he went-with them to Richmond and
entered upon the duty, and has since diligently
proie-'uted it Much of it has been passed upon by.
the Confederate Auditor, and the work is now pro
gressing, and it is expected' that at an early day a
considerable part of the amount advanced by the
State in payment of her troops will be paid, and
that the whole claim will be passed upon by the
auditing officers at an early day. "It consists of a
vast number of items, sustained by a great many
vouchers, not always in the best shape, and neces
sarily requires much labor and research.
THE PAYMENT OP OUK KIOHT PEU CENT. BONDS.
Not having succeeded in collecting any of the
foregoing claim from the Confederate government,
I hafts not felt authorized to notify the holders of
our 8 ptr cent bonds, of my readniness to pay them,
or to give them 6 per tent, bonds, if they should
prefer them, in exchange for the 8 per cent, "bonds.
Tho salaries of the two clerks in this debarment
are lass than they should be if they were paid in
specie. They are the cashiers of the department,
and upon their fiJelity and skill depends theaccura
cy of the accounts to be kept in it. True economy
requires that they should at all times be paid a liber
al salary. Their present compensation is totally in
adequate to their support
It must be manifest to any one at all acquainted
with the duties of this department that it ought to
have two contiguous rooms: one for the Treasurer
and One for the clerical force. I respectfully submit
it whether another assignment of the rooms of the
capitol cannot be made to effect this end without
detriment or inconvenience to any other department
The office hours of the Treasury, as now pre
scribed by law, are from 9 to 12, and from 2 to 5
o'clock Nearly all the payments are made by
checks on the banks, which close at 2 o'clock in the
afternoon. The time from 12 till 2, wien the office
is now closed, is much more important I the pub
lic than from 2 till 5 p. m. The clerks should have
some time, with closed doors, to make up the cash
account, post the books, &c 1 respectfully submit
that it would be more convenient for the public,
and that the dutiesof the office could be better per
formed if the office were required to bp kept open
from 9 o'clock a. m. to 2 o'clock p. m., and tiosed
afterwards.
The act of 1856, chap. 16, authorizes the hold
ers of Stato bonds to have them registered. Very
many avail themselves of its provisions. 1 respect
fully submit that the assistant clerk of this depart
ment ought to be allowed a small fee for this service,
to bs paid by the party requiring such registration.
THE CTRKENCT.
It is manifest that if something efficient be not
speaddy done vastly to diminish the volume of Con
federate currency, thaMt will soon. cease to answer
the purpose of money. The Confederate Congress
alone can furnish the remedy, if the disease be' capa
ble of cure. 'It seems to me to be certain that it
will not be found in any plan which savors of repu
diation, nor in voluntary funding. If it be possible
to reduce the circulation to a tolerably healthy slate,
it must be done by taxation ; and if funding consti
tute a part of the plan, it should he done at a very
low rate of interest I recommend taxation to raise
the means to meet any considerable appropriation
you may deem it expedient to make. I deem the
ways and means now provided sufficient to meet
present appropriations, if the currency shall not
grow worse, and if the demands of the military de
partments of the Slate shall not be greater in the
future than they have been the past year.
Every Sheriff promptly paid tho public taxes due
on or before Octobor 1st 1863, amounting to $1,
808,399 93, excepting the sheriffs of the following
counties, which are believed to in possession of the
enemy, to wit: Beaufort Hyde, Chowan, Perqui
mans, Washington, Gates, Carteret, Pasquotank,
Currituck, Camion, Jones, Craven and Tyrrell.
The sheriffs- and tax collectors throughout the
State aoted with commendable promptitude under
your act of the extra session in July last; and
$1,564,100 was received in time, and funded in 7
per cent bonds of the Confederate States.
