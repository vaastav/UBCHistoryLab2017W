TELEGRAPHIC MARKET LETTER
Minneapolis, Dec. 17.—Wheat prices
in Liverpool this morning were %c
hnde£ the closing figures of yesterday.
Our market opened %c under yesterday
and for over an hour there was barely
anything done. The market keeping
within a range of ^c. There was a
toltal absence of influencing conditions
.,at first, other than heavy receipts in
the northwest. Later on the market
became stronger on fair buying. When
we consider the fact that Canada has
taken one-third of its late crop for
feeding purposes and that there is a
growing use of wheat with use in the
same direction, why should it not sell
much higher than at present. Near
noon some activity developed and
price on May worked up to 70%@.%c.
Market held steady for a short time
and on selling by scalpers prices re­
ceded Vic. There has been some good
support (to the market since midday
and it should work higher.
Corn was weak in the early trading,
selling %c under yesterday's close, but
on some good buying it soon regained
the loss and advanced %c. The buy­
ing has been for good people and corn
should take another spurt soon and
with a greater head of steam on than
it has yet had.
Oats were lower, too, but became
steady and firmer early.
Provisions opened at yesterday's
closing figures and advanced 12%c on
.buying by packers and held firm all
day.
FINANCIAL SUMMARY.
New York, Dec. 17.—The stock mar­
ket was more cheerful today than in
some time- A C. P. opened weak and
sold down to 60% but good buying de­
veloped in this stock and turned it up
to 64%c. The buying looked better
than at any time since the decline
started. Money rates were somewhat
easiej. The next two weeks will see
the end of tight money on account of
preparations for January-dividend dis­
bursements. After January 1st there
•will be plenty of money and stocks
should advance sharply. It would
seem to be good policy to pick up a
line of stocks on the dips between now
land January 1st.

MOVING DAY
AiGrENT SCOTT AND THE DEPOT
FORCE ABE TRANSFERRING
THEMSELVES TO THE NEW
BUILDING.
Today is moving day at the Northern
Pacific headquarters in the city.
Agenit S-cotit and the depot force aire
busy transferring their properties and
persons from the old to the new build­
ing. The ticket office was moved to
the new building this morning, the
waiting rooms opened, and tickets can
now be purchased in the new building.
The first ticket sold over the new win­
dow was disposed of to an Italian ped­
dler who dropped in just in time to ob­
tain that honor. The baggage and
express departments will be removed
tomorrow, Everything about the
building is spick and span and the
opening will be greatly appreciated by
the traveling public.
The old buildings that have been
been used temporarily, are being
hoisted off their foundations prepara­
tory Ito removal from the grounds.
The old depot building has had a
varied career. It was originally an
ice house attachment to the Sheridan
house. Thereafter it was used as a
gambling saloon, Restaurant, ice cream
parlor, and after the fire three years
ago it served as a postoffice building
for several months, winding up its
caree of usefulness as a depot build­
ing.
LAND TAX CLEARED UP
AUDITOR MOORHOUSE BELIEVES
THAT SIXTY DAYS FROM NOW
WILL SEE ALL TAXES ON
LANDS IN COUNTY CLERED
UP.
Auditor Moorhouse stated today that
he believed the next sixty days would
see all the delinquent taxes on lands
in this county cleared up. After the
recent tax sale and the issuance of
deeds for property sold for taxes three
years ago, there will remain no taxes
on lands unsettled. A large number
of the parcels of land, sold for taxes
three years ago, and on which final
notices of redemption were issued re­
cently, have been redeemed, both by
owners and local real estate men.
Quit claim deeds have been obtained
from the fee owners in many cases,
and with these real estate .men have
paid the taxes and redeemed the land.
Probably not over sixty tax deeds will
issue to the original purchaser of these
lands, out of several hundred notices
issued.
Auditor Moorhouse also calls atten­
tion to the fact that under the law, a
large number of city lots are now the
absolute property of the county and
can be sold at public or private sale
as the county commissioners may
direct. These are lots thalt were bid­
den in by the county in 1898 for the
taxes of 1897 and the Uaw provides
that after three years they become
the absolute property of the county
and shall be taken off the tax list
The list of these lots includes a num­
ber of good residence properties in the
city. The owners have until they
are sold by the county to redeem them.
If this is not done, the county may
issue an absolute deed under the direc­
tion of the commissioners. Under
the law no further notice is required

THE DONOVAN CASE.
The supreme court today handed

from Judge Fisk, who, after a judg­

in a former appeal, permitted Dono­

Fargo Forum: Andrew Floberg,

bald head, occasioned by hashing it in
muriatic acid this morning. Some
time since it appears that Ma/cnab, the
papular druggist of the city across the

some reason it proved unsatisfactory
and he ordered it returned. It was
taken to the N. P. freight depot and
left upon a barrel for a time. The

The first of the new century is gone
there are ninety-nine" years left for im­
provement. Messrs. N. W. Ayer &
Son. the Philadelphia promoters of ad­
vertising, have begun early in their ef­
forts to make the second year better
than the first. Their Twentieth Cen­
tury Calendar., issued about this time
last year, it was thought, approached
near the limit of the art preservative
and .the demands of utility—but the
1902 calendar is better. As usual, the
back-ground and main sheet of this
calendar is an art work, enhanced in
beauty by the tasteful colors of the contrary to the evidence and the
printer. The twelve sheets contain
ing the dates of the months have a
restful dark green baick-ground, the
large figures in white catching the eye
at a great distance. In each sheet are
epigrammatic sentences bearing on
the possibilities of business during the
year. Though this calendar marks
the passing of one year in a hundred,
it is in itself one calendar in a thous­
and for artistic beauty and real use­
fulness. The demand is always great,

Boers Said to Be Tiring of Life in the
Field.
New York, Dec. 17-—The correspond­
ent of The Time? at Pretoria says the
recen1. British successes occur oppor
tuinelj at a moment when the Boers
are Showing signs of discontent with
the life on commando, but the British
instead of congratulating themselves,
ought to put forth further efforts on a
bigger scale.
Another dispatch from the same cor­
respondent says that of the 800 Boers
collected north of Bethel under Gener­
al Piet Vilijcen, only two commandos
of a hundred men each remain in the
neighborhood. The rest, including Vil
joen, have gone to the northeast, to­
ward the DeTagoa ra'lway line.
"There seems," says the correspond­
ent, "no reas.cn to doubt that Acting
President Schalk-Burger and the 'Boer
government officials,' have crossed the
line north. After addressing a large
meeting near Carolina, at which he
told the burghers that they must be
steadfast, as foreign intervention was
certain before long, Schalk-Burger
seems to have decided that the coun­
try north of the Delagoa railway line
was more attractive than the high
veldt, where the British columns are
huntling the Boers incessently. He
probably is new in the neighborhood
of Pilgrim's Rest, where some 400
Boers have settled for the summer.
"Viljoen is the leading spirit in East­
ern Transvaal. After General Botha
had been busy encouraging the Boers
with tales of the withdrawal of British
troops and of Boer successes in Cape
Colony, his (Viljoen's) defeat by Gen­
eral Bruce-Hamilton should materially
increase the discontent which is very
rife among the Boers in these districts.

important points in Mayo and Ros­

both counties under the crimes act is
expected to be issued immediately.
This influx of extra police is unprece­
dented since the days of Captain Boy­

have been most active in Mayo and

For the river men and dwellers

Hundreds of men toiled all night with
the gigantic ccal tows tied up to the

The rain aid snow of the past three
days caused the upper tributaries of

was sent out from the weather busman
that a flood stage was possible, but it
was not heeded because a cold snap
usually takes all the danger out of a
flood. It failed to do so Sunidav and as
a result the freshet will cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars that might
have been saved.
