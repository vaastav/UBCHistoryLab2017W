been a net surplus of nearly one
hundred millions of receipts ov

that the nation should fix the
terms upon which the great for

harm to those who inherit them

Ckalmers.Detroit Automoliles
Tke Best $1500 to $1700 Car On Eartk
Buy a car that does tilings; one that you will he proud of; one that
holds the admiration and respect of the motoring world; a top notcher
in every contest.
In selecting a car to represent and sell to my friends and neighbors, it seemed to me to be more than a
question of how cheap I could buy, and how much profit I could make- I felt that should I make one sale or a
thousand, I should consider myself personally responsible as to quality, reliability, satisfaction, standard of
perfection and good name. Kansas people do not want to sport a second class car if they know it. They
want an automobile to have a high reputation among people who know. A man in selling such a costly thing
as an automobile of any price, should consider himself just as much the agent of his enstomer as of the manu
facturer who makes it. After all the investigations that it was ia me to make, after making the most pains,
taking comparisons as to quality and price, elegance and refinement, I became thoroughly convinced that the
Cnalmers-Detroit was in a class by itself, and it is upon this decision that I stake my reputation for good
judgement. A paving of two or three hundred dollars in the purchase price of a machine will never make you
feel just right, if after a while you come to realize that it is lame in power, speed, endurance, poputarity or high
class up-todateoess. You will not feel that your money had been well spent unless it continues to make good.
I have no intention of knocking on the machines of others, for I am thoroughly convinced that motor cars as a
general rule are now built on practical lines, lines that will not require much change from this time on, but there
will always be a difference in classes, the same as there is in vehicles. There are always people who buy the better
class, and this is the trade I wish to supply.
Some Things the Chalmers-Detroit has Done From Official Reports
Jkricho Sweepsteakes, on New Long Island Motor Parkway, October 10, 1908. H500 car wins, distance 140 7
