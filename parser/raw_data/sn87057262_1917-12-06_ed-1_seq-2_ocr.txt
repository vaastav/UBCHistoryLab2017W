Questions Are Simple Enough and At

Over Difficult
Plaoes.
At the meeting of the Keokuk at
torneys held yesterday afternoon in
the district court rooms, it was de
cided to have the lawyers at the
federal building commencing Monday,
December 17, to asisst the selective
service men in answering their Ques
tionnaires. The attorneys will be on
hand at 8 o'clock, and will aid the
selects in every possible way. It
planned to have them work in four
shifts.
The attorneys are on hand to f"1**
ish advice gratis to the men, and
also to protect the government, in
any Instance® where men are delib
erately falsifying, the training of a
lawyer will detect this, and he can
offer some advice to his client that
will be timely.
There is a penalty of two years in
the penitentiary for men who falsify
to their draft questions.
Chairman Scott told the attorney3
tHftt there was little trouble in the
first call, and he felt that tiers
would be little difficulty in this sec
and c*U- expecting none, and
jwith the help of the attorneys to
advise the selects over difficult por
tions of the questionnaire there will
he no difficulty experienced.
Classifying the Registrants.
After the questionnaire is in, the
local board will classify the men. ac
cording to the answers in the Ques
tion list. It Is understood that un
lees a wife is absolutely dependent
on her husband, he "will be certified
for service either In the first or sec
ond call. Where wives have inde
pendent Incomes, their husbands go

Men who were exempted In the first
examinations because of physical dis
abilities will he placed in class five,
the last class to be called. They
must answer the questions, however,
just the same as anyone.
A force of thirty-three young wom
en from the Keokuk offices and busi
ness houses is at work each night at
the court house getting out the ques
tionnaires for the local board. The
girts have to place the name of each
registrant in the proper place on the
blank, and they have to address the
envelope in which to enclose the
blanks. The work Is requiring con
siderable clerical work, and the
young women are volunteering as a
matter of patriotism to do this work.

IS NEAR FACT

many*8 lesser allies were weakening
in their support.
Flood her# read to the house an in
terview of yesterday with Bulgarian
Minister Panaretoff, in which the
envoy asked that the president's
message to congress be transmitted
to his country.
He said there were particularly
strong reasons why the United States
should remain on friendly terms with
Bulgaria.
Denying the presence in Wash

a menace. Flood emphasized that the
Bulgarian legation could not com
municate with Burope except through
the state department.
"Bulgaria is not fighting for lust
or world conquest," he said.
Favorably Reported.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The reso
lution calling for a declaration of a
state of war against Austria was
favorably reported to the hou^e by
the foreign relations committee to
day.
"The state of war between the
United States and Austria has been
'an actual fact for many months,'
the committee's report declared, "and
very little readjustment of affairs"
between the countries will therefore
be involved.
"Depredations on American lives
and rights by Austrian naval forces
has been small, compared with those
of Germany, but they have been in
dulged in in extent to constitute war
on this country," the report declared.
Socialist Peace Resolution.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—Represen
tative Meyer London, socialist, of
New York, today introduced a peace
resolution in the house. London's
resolution favors immediate estab
lishment by congress of an inter
I national league to secure a durable
peace.
The resolution follows:
"Resolved, by the senate and house
of representatives of the United
States of America in congress as
sembled, that the congress of the
United States shall initiate the or
ganization of an international league
to secure a durable peace and for
that purpose, shall through the pres
ident of the United States invite the
representatives of the parliaments of
all the countries now at war with
the central powers, to convene in
joint conference to be held at the
city of Washington, District of Co
lumbia."
Ruth Law in Congress.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—Women

army for any service the secretary
of war may designate and may re
ceive commissions as officers in the

duced in the house today_ by Repre

fusal of the war department to com
mission Hiss Roth Law, noted avla
tress for foreign service.
Just before tip house met at noon,
Hulbert escorted Miss Law to the
house chamber where she mounted
Speaker Clark's rostrum. Sitting in

for order.
She then held as informal levee in

She was dressed in air costume,

All Wires Down.
NEW YORK. Dec. C—The explosion
at Rockingham, near Haligax, N. S., in
which many persons are reported
dead, was caused by the collision of
two transports loaded with munitions
in the harbor, according to word re
ceived by cable officials here today.
All communication with Halifax by
both land and sea failed at 10:10 a.
m., the officials said.
Telephone officials here said all
wires were down to Halifax and the
city was utterly isolated. Efforts to
get in touch with the city by Canadian
Pacific telephone and telegraph wires
were likewise fruitless.
At Rockingham Bay.
NEW YORK, Dec.
and telephone wires Into Halifax are
down as a result' of the explosion at
Rockingham bay, the Western Union
clfices here declared today. Reports
received at that office said the front
of the Western Union office in Hali- ___
fax was blown in by the force of the i~
explosion and that several employes
there were injured.
Hospital Trains Rushed.
MONCTON, B. C., Dec. 6.—Four
hospital trains with nurses, surgeons
and supplies, are being rushed to
Halifax and another is enroute there,
carrying fire fighting equipment, an
official of the Canadian government
railway declared this afternoon.
British Cruiser Responsible.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.—A British
cruiser crashing Into an American
munitions ship caused the terrible
explosion in Halifax, according to re-,
ports received here this afternoon
by cable officials.
Forty or Fifty Dead.
TRURO, N. S., Dec. 6.—Forty or
fifty persons are dead in the Hali
fax munitions explosion, according to
fragments^ reports received here
this afternoon. There is no estimate
of the number of Injured.
Doctors and nurses, fire fighting
equipment and supplies are being
rushed to the Canadian naval port
from every port within sixty miles.
The northwestern portion of the city
is burning. From messages received
here it is evident the explosion came
when an American munitions steamer
was rammed amidships by an incom
ing vessel.
I Buildings three miles from the
scene were damaged. The roof of
the Halifax railway station was torn
off. So terrific was the explosion
that the report was plainly heard
here, sixty" miles from Halifax. It
probably will take several days to
restore telegraphic communication.
I War Department Interested.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The war
department is making inquiries and
endeavoring to get Information as to
the explosion at Halifax. Before
noon nothing had been received aside
from press dispatches.
All inquiries by the department
are being made by cable. Wireless
will not be called into play unless
fthls is found to be the only means of
I communication, owing to the desire
{of keeping any information that
