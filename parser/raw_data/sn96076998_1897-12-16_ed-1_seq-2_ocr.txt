LOVESING'3 PUNISHMENT.
Text of Oeneral Alger's Order Rtpri
N mandlas Captain Loverlaa.
Secretary Alger has made. ubll3 the
order reprimanding Capt. Lovtring of the
Fourth infantry at Fort Sheridan, who
was recently court martlaled, for hia al
leged ill-treatment of Private Hammond.
It reada as followa: "By order of the Pres.
CI00.000 IS REPORTED TO HAVE
BEEN STOLEN.
GREATMAIL ROBBERY LIlent .th0 Proceedings, findings and sen-
ieuce in me case or Capt. Leonard A. Ijov-
enng, fourth Infantry, are approved. It
la, however, disappointing that an offense
ao grave and aa an example ao far-reach
lng as thla should have beep visited with
ao light a Denaltr. There is no auestion
but that Private Hammond deserved pun
ishment for his conduct, but he should
have received It in a lawful way. The
military laws governing the army are ex
plicit. They prescribe the duties of offi
cers and enlisted men, with th penalties
for their violation. Under them "both hate
rights and obligations. "When, therefore,
an officer, with the intelligence and ex
perience with which Capt. Lovering is
credited not only violates these laws, but
exhibits such a lack of humanity aa Is
shown In this case, he should receive a
more severe sentence than a mere repri
mand. Committing such acts jjdegrades
me omcer more man the soldi1 ne pun
ishes and shows unfitness for the; care and
command of men. Under.excJteTnent men
frequently do things which iri'cooler mo
ments they recall with sorrow and regret,
but tbls case is aggravated by the fact
that after weeks of deliberation'' this offi
cer evinces no- regret for hlsVwrongful
nets."
"Registered Matter la Missing on a
Branch of tbe Cental Railroad of New
Jersey-One Postal Clerk Cannot He
Found IJurins Outlook.
Registered Mail Stolen.
Investigation, is now being made of
What Is supposed .to be oue of the biggest
robberies in the, history of the New York
postotflce. The robbery is said to be iu
the railway mail service and confined ex
clusively" "to' registered letters. The ex
act amount taken cannot be learned, but
it is stated unofficially to be In the neigh
borhood of $100,000. Thin figure is
thought to be excessive by some who are
Investigating the case, but all agree that
it is the largest amount ever takcta at
any oua time in the registry department.
The robbery., is confined, so far as inves
tigation has shown, to that section of the
Central Railroad of New Jersey which
Is known as the New York, Somorville
and Enstcn branch. The discovery was
made on Nov. I), but the secret was kept
by the postoflice authorities until now.
It is known, so the statement is made.
that $30,000, the total amount carried in
two bags, was taken. This sum was miss
ing on Nov. 0. How long the defalcation
had gone on prior to that time has not
been ascertained. On the day the robbery
was discovered Robert K. Lang, a clerk
employed on the New Y'ork, Somerville
and Easton branch, disappeared, and has
not been found. In addition to Lang
there were employed W. J. McLaren, P.
S. Tooker and J. D'Arcy. Since Nov. 7
hundreds of complaints have reached
postoflices making inquiries after regis
tered letters that never reached their des
tination. The chief inspector and his staff
at the potsofflce in New York have sev
eral files filled with these complaints.

DODGE THE EXCLUSION ACT.
Wholesale Traffic in Bogus Naturali

Commissioner of Immigration Fitchle
at New York has been notified by Com
missioner General Powderly . that the
State Department at Woshington has
been Informed by the United States am
bassador at Rome that a wholesale traffic
in fraudulent naturalization papers is be
ing carried on In Italy. The object of
these fraudulent methods,' Mr. Powderly
said. Is to effect the entry into" the United
States, under cloak of American citizen
ship, of aliens who otherwise would be
subject to exclusion. In view, of these
facts Commissioner Fitchie is ordered to
particularly investigate all naturalization
papers of immigrants, and especially those
from Italy. Commissioner Fitchie said
the task was an extremely difficult one.
From the large number 6f Immigrants re
cently landed he believed .there were
agents in Europe who, In. furtherance of
this fraudulent scheme, hail secured steer
age passengers under the threat that un
less they came at once they would not be
admitted nt nil, as Congress was about

Religious Excitement.
Religious persecutions In Quakcrtown,
a small village near Norwich, Conn.,
have reached such a point that a serious
climax may result. A month - ago the
members of the old families decided that
the present youth and maiden were being
allowed too much levity, and it was to
meet this want of seriousness that a re
ligious awakening was decided upon. All
went well for a time. Solomon Crouch, a
carpenter, who was the leader, is a
Quaker by birth, but not being a native
of Quakertown the young folks looked
upon him as nn outsider, and some of
mem distrusted him. He claims to have
special revelations from God, mid what
is revealed to him he preaches to the peo
ple. It is reported that Crouch went to
the borne of Lucy Whipple, wife of Allen
Whipple. She told the revivalist she did
not believe in his alleged revelations. At
this the revivalist is alleged to have be
come greatly enraged and struck her in
the faoe with a knife. The next morning
the Whipple house was burned ' to the
ground, while the neighbors looked on.
The following; night the older Quakers
met In council. The entire neighborhood
gathered at the outskirts of the village.
and decided to run Crouch out. . Armed
with shotguns, it is alleged, they sur
rounded Wntrous house nnd called for
Crouch to appear. He and his followers
made a stanch stand, nnd, it Is said, not
withstanding that charges of buckshot
were exchanged, nobody was seriously
hurt. During a lull In the fight, Crouch
and Watrous are reported to have, escaped
under the cover of darkness.

The Country Wants the Road.
The Secretary of the Treasury at Wash
ington has taken the first steps to qualify
on behalf of the Government as. a bidder
at the sale of the Kansas Pacific, Railroad
on Dec. 10. A transfer order for SDOO.-
000 was sent by Treasurer Roberts for
in a forcible manner, the destruction by
fire of the wooded lauds of the provinces
that has been going on steadily for years,
and which, unless checked, will in a few
years more leave the province (and Que
bec as well, but not to such sn extent)
stripped of its woodlands. Dr. Bell of the
geological survey at Ottawa last year
published a pamphlet enumerating the
vast tracts of land that have been burned
over during the past twenty years. Dr.
Bell claims that once Canada loses Its
forests, It will also lose, to a large extent,
its present beneficent rainfalls, and
drought will be frequent and extensive.
The doctor states more miles of lumber
have been burned in the last 100 years
than have, come under the lumbermen's
axes. Certain It la that every year many
miles of splendid forests are being char
red and blackened by bush fires.. ' Re
cently, near Ottawa, three villages, Cas-
selman, South Indian and Cheney, were
destroyed, and 1,200 people made home
less. JAPAN EXPECTS INDEMNITY.
Toru Iloshi Gives the Mikado's Posi
tion Regarding Hawaii.
Toru Iloshi, Japanese minister to the
United States, admitted in ao Interview
with a representative of the Associated
Press that the object of his mission to
Japan, from whence he has just returned,
was to ascertain the views of bis Gov
ernment on the proposed annexation of
Hawaii and to procure instructions from
the mikado relative to the course he was
expected to pursue in case the treuty shall
be ratified by Congress. Mr. Iloshi said:
"The Impression has gone out to the
American people that we propose to recall
the protest entered by Japan against the
acquisition of the Sandwich Islands by
the United States Government. This is
misleading and untrue. Japan has always
maintained amicable relations with the
United States, and it is not our purpose
now to take any steps that would lead to
a breach of mutual good will, but at the
same time Japan will stand firmly in the
maintenance of its rights nnd privileges
acquired under treaty with the Hawaiian
Government. If the United States decid
ed to annex Hawaii, we hope to be able
to enforce our demands for indemnity for
the violation of treaty rights in the ex
pulsion of Japanese immigrants from the
island and their exclusion from the rights
acquired under our treaty."
DEATH IN A SNOWSLIDE.
Two Miners Swept Into .Eternity in
Montana.
Word has been received at Helena.
Mont., that two miners, John Hassett
and Frank Weber, were killed in a snow-
slide nt the Hecla mine, ten miles from
Glendale. The men had been working
near the top of the mountain and started
down the 6lope toward the Hecla. One
of them dislodged a small quantity of ice
and snow and that started a regular ava
lanche, which carried both men down the
mountain. The accident was witnessed
by other miners and search'was at once
made for the bodies and they were recov
ered the next night. The country around
Hecla has for years been feared on ac
count of its snowslides, from which many i
deaths have resulted.

COUNT'S WICKED SCHEME.
Would Unite Europe in a Commercial
War on America.
Count Agcnor Goluchowskl, the Aus
trian Minister of Foreign Affairs who
desires to unite Europe in a commer
cial war on the countries of America,
has the reputation among; European
diplomats and statesmen of being a
peaceful man. His speech, In which he
almost violently advocated a concert of
Europe for Industrial warfare on the
United States and the South American
tepubllcs, would be startling were there
any possibility of the Count's plan be
ing put Into practice. Tbe Count Is a
man In the prime of life. He comes
from a family which has been power
ful In Austrian affairs for several gen
erations, and be holds one of the three
ministerial places within the gift of his
country. His only associates of equal
power and rank are the ministers of
war and finance. He has been regard

concerning It, of course; but thl much
may be said, at least: The girl who
behaves well, dresses well, nnd rldos
well because she enjoys the pastime,
and because she is In need of suitable
outdoor exercise may be sure of calling
forth respect and admiration wherever
she goes.

WOMAN'S EXPRESSION. '
The Peculiar Story It Tells to Those
Who Take Time to Observe It.
The faces of women one passes In the
'street form a curious story, says the
1' atnlly Doctor. One woman purses up
her lips, another screws her eyes into
uuuaturalness, while a third will wrin
kle up her forehead and eyebrows until
she looks absolutely ugly. The trick
Is an unconscious one, but Is none the
less a trick, and a bad one.
There is no reason why any woman
should look forbidding nid bad-tempered
Just because she Is annoyed about
something. Deep-seated trouble has a
way of writing itself upon the face
whether we will or not. Sickness, too,
has Its handwriting, and will not be
concealed by nrt. But the frown caus
ed by superficial trouble should not be
entertained by the face for nn Instant.
We should strive to look as pleasant
as possible for the sake of others; a
corresponding cheerfulness of tempera
ment will Inevitably result, and always
to tne sweetening of our nature.
We cannot afford to go about with
gloomy faces. To depress others Is not
for us; our work Is to cheer, to raise
up, to comfort, but we shall never do
this unless we cultivate a pleasant de
meanor, and the cheerful temper In
separable from It. This brings us to
that question of worry.
Can we put It more strongly than to
say that It is a duty to put cure, worry,
fretfulness behind one? The habit
must be learned, or we shall not "grow
straight In the strength of our spirit,
nnd live out our life as the light," as
Swinburne so well puts It. "It Is diffi
cult to do that," says someone.
We all know that it Is very hard, bnt
women are not afraid of dilflcultles.
The more difficult the right thing Is to
do, the greater reason for doing It. All
we need Is to make the first effort
strength will be born which will in
crease at each subsequent attempt, and
we shall conquer It In the end. Salva
tion for women lies In this not to be
overcome by troubles, but to overcome
them.
Vegetarians Found a Hospital.
Vegetarianism has taken a stand In
England which entitles it to respect
from people who are not entire believ
ers In the doctrine. The restaurants
of the vegetarians are clean nnd they
provide a menu of reasonable variety.
One of the latest steps In the line of
the work has been the founding of a
vegetarian hospital, which a writer In

Lesson for December 10.
Golden Text. "If we confess our sins,
he Is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins." 1 John 1:0.
The subject for study this week is
"John's Message About Sin and Salva.
tlon," found In 1 John If 5; 2: 0.
Introductory.
These are the last times of the apostles,
their last words, the final echo of that
great generation which had witnessed the
ijom coming and departure. Paul's spirit
had ascended to his Master In the fierce
storm of Nero's closing days, and Peter
had nlso borne a good Interest in death ns
in life. Many years after those mighty
voices were stilled, John lingered on, an
nncient nnd pathetic figure, but clothed in
gentle dignity quite inimitable nnd beau
tiful. As the years wore on, Jerusalem
lay in ruins, the other apostles dropped
from the paths of the living, the voices
grew fewer of those who had known the
Lord.
John, living as tradition says, in Ephe
aus, though traveling at times through
the East, began to wonder
"How will It be when no one saith, I
saw?"
He had already written a Revelation of
Christ, but something more was needed.

Q4QE ON CURRENCY.
pacretarr of the Treasury Present
Ills Annual Report.
The Secretary of the Treasury in his
annual report sent to Congress says that
the Dlngley act "has not been in force
long enough to determine fully its merits.
'out it is confidently believed that when
In full operation it will afford ample reve
nue for the ordinary seeds of the Gov
ernment." He, however, in his estimates for the
fiscal year 1898, places the total revenue
at $441,000,000; expenditures at $409,
000,000, or a deficit of $28,000,000.
For 1890 the revenues are estimated at
$482,000,000 and appropriations $504,
000,000, a deficit of $21,000,000. For the
fiscal year ended June 30 last, the receipts
were $430,000,000; expenses, $448,000,
000, a deficit of $18,000,000.
The Secretary says the enormous depre
dation In the commercial value of silver,
as compared with gold, has greatly in
creased the financial responsibilities of
the Government In its' demand liabilities,
and the logical consequences of the fact
should be boldly faced.
"The Treasury Department In all Its
operations has treated gold and silver
coins, and the paper representatives of
each, as of equal dignity as to value," he
ays. "It has operated to keep in con- .
current circulation on terms of equality
the two kinds of metallic money, notwith
standing the never ecu sing disparity be
tween the natural or commercial value of
one as compared with the other. Never
theless it must be recognized that this
undertaking involves a lurge financial re
sponsibility and requires proper and ade
quate legislative provisions for its con
tinued execution.
"The condition of the treasury in Its
relation to demand obligations requires
were Dy this time (80 or 85 A. D.) in cir- " one of two steps be taken. The one
culation, nnd had been for some years; m&y be a large re-enforcement of the per-
but there were inner mysteries of the manent gold reserve; the other may be an
truth which John had perceived during important reduction In the objectionable
those three wonderful years of his youth, ro"n of liabilities. The latter is in my
wuicn nad not yet been told. So he wrote
his gospel and sent it forth to all who
could read its simple and sublime truths.
Still the years hurried on. sin nnd error
fought desperately ngnihst the truth, but
the old mnn stood npart like one whose life
was already in the heavenly city, looking
on without fear or anxiety, warning his
"little children" against the dangers, not
of persecution, but of self-deceit nnd sin.
In these three epistles we have his last
words to the world (some suppose that
his gospel was written after Instead of
before them, however). They show a
strong resemblance in style to the gospel,
John's favorite words, "light," "love,"
"truth," "life," "darkness," being freely
useu.
Explanatory,
"The message which we have heard
from him": there is something intensely
personal In John's announcement of his
message. He feels with Increasing con
viction In his latest years the supreme
value of personal testimony.
To walk In darkness, in John's sense,
Is not to have thf soul clouded temporarily
by doubt or discouragement. So to inter
pret the verse takes nil the meaning from
it. John is not shaking of what we call
"Christian assurance." He is speaking
of conduct. We walk in darkness when
we turn wilfully away from the light.
"But if we walk in the light;" if, that
Is, we share his love for things good and
hatred for things evil, striving towards
the one and against the other.
How is this to be reconciled with 3: 0,
"Whosoever abideth In him sinneth jot;
whosoever sinneth hath not seen him,
neither known him." Tiere is eeltalnly
a verbal contradiction here. But If we
take each verse in its context, nnd remem
opinion the more desirable.'
The Secretary then recommends the es
tablishment of nn issue nnd redemption
division department to which $125,000,
000 in gold shall be Bet over to be used
for redemption purposes, and that the sil
ver dollars and bullion be passed to the
same account; that the $200,000,000
greenbacks be collected and placed in this
division to be disbursed therefrom only
in exchange for gold.
He also recommends the Issue of bonds
bearing 2V6 per cent, payable in gold, after
ten years, at the pleasure of the Govern
ment, to take the place of the outstand
ing loans, with an allowance for difference
in interest. There were a number of oth
er recommendations.
ODD WAY TO PREACH.
Object Sermons Now a Fad with Borne
Gotham Preachers,
Religion and religious methods seem to
be taking on a new form with the ap
proaching birth of Greater New York.
Doctrines. of heresy, political discussions
and other matters far from the old-fashioned
path of pastors, seem to be the only
questions now discussed in the houses of
worship. And the breuk-away from the
orthodox has affected churches of every
denomination.
The excitement caused by the reported
possibility of Father Duccy being disci
plined for expressing his approval of so
cialistic principles has given wny to talk
aroused by the action of Bev. Dr. Denni

many men rose to certain heights in the
world, but never got any higher. The
weight that kept them down, he explained,
,was a pair of handcuffs. Then the pastor

"An advocate with the Fnther": If John
were giving us dogmatic theology, we
should charge him with confusing the per
sons of the Trinity; for the word trans
lated "advocnte" is the regular term for
the "Holy Spirit," or "Comforter." Here
it is applied to Christ in heaven.
"The propitiation for our sins." The
scriptural conception is not that of appeas
ing ohe who is angry, with a personal feel
ing against the offender; but of altering
the character of that which, from with
out, occasions a necessary alienation, nnd

'Acachiuir Hints.
The childlike simplicity of John's epis
tles, like the crystal purity of a deep
spring, makes truth itself seem the most
natural nnd easy thing In the world. Ills
words are nppropriate to every age. They
nre loved by little children, they are read
with eagerness by old men. It should be
the most helpful lesson of the whole
year's lessons, which it closes. How nat
ural is the association with the Christ-
