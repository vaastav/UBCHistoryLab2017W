Important Opinion Given by
N. C. Supreme Court
RAILROAD REGULATION HURT.
Chief Justice Holds That Require
ment to Get Ticket for Mileage is
Unreasonable and Void-Fight
Coming in Legislature.
Raleigh, N. C.-The North Caro
lina'Supreme Court in Harvey vs.
Railroad, from Wilson county, prac
tically deals a "knockout"' blow to
the railroad mileage book -regu
lations requiring holders to procure
mileage, tickets in exchange before
boarding a train" in., its ruling just
made; Harvey is a traveling man
and attempted at Wilson three or
four times to procure a ticket in
exchange for mileage, being stood
aside each time by the agent in or
der that he might wait on cash pur
chasers of tickets. Finally the train
came, without Harvey having gotten
his ticket. He boarded the train
with mileage which thc conductor
refused to accept, putting him off at
.the first station. He recovered 82,
500'damages.
. -Now the Supreme Court, Associate
Justice Hofee writing-the opinion,
approves the judgment holding tri?t
Har^eyflfaci:the right, underthe cir
cumstances, to ride :on the mileage.
The court would not set aside the
verdict as to amount of damages ex
cessive, although Justice Brown and
Walker,-'while concurring that the
plaintiff' should recover, held ?hat.
the amount awarded was excessive.
Chief Justice Walter darli; in an
opinion concurring with Justices
Hoke 'and Manning in the controll
ing-opinion of the court, holds fur
ther that the requirement thal, a
holder of a mileage book shall ob
tain a ticket to exchange is a breach
of faith on the part of the railroads
at whose.-instance the special ses
sion of-'the General Assembly of
1908 was held to raise the passen
ger rate to. 2 1-2 cents upon the
proposition of the railroad com
panies that they would issue mile
age books at 2.cents, meaning, Chief
Justice Clark, declares, the-mileage
to which the public had always been
accustomed, whereby the mileage
had been pulled on the train by thc
conductor. The Chief Justice* also
holds that the requirement to get
ticket for mileage is unreasonable
and void and becoming hereio'fore
unknown in this State and still un
known except in this State and a
few adjacent States where the prin
cipal North Carolina roads extend.
It is a notable fact that in the last
General Assembly a bill passed thc
House by a large majority prohibit
ing th^--miretrife--ticket requirement
and that it failed in the Senate by
the deciding ,vote'of the presiding
officer after a tie vote of Senators.
The indications are that the ques
tion will be fought all over again
during the approaching session.

made permanent and that all future
revisions be made schedule by:
schedule. He vigorously opposes
another general revision.

means be fortified. An appropria
tion of ?19,000.000 is recommended
for this purpose.

Members of the House, including al
most the entire body, are threatening
to march to the Treasury Department
and make request of the Secretary
that he make an additional recom

Members of Congress who have
asked the Secretary for his viewa on ?
the subject have come away from
his office with the firm impression
that he is going to. -stand pat and
that he will not estimate for any of

think, these Representatives say, that
the Treasury is in any shape just now
to stand an additional drain of al
most- $30,000,000. '
Consequently the members to whom
these building aopropriations mean a
great deal, and this' comprises a large
majority of the House, are planning a
demonstration to induce the Secretary
