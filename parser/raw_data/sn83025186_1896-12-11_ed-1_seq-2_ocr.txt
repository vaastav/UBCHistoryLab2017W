Washington, D. C., Dec. 7.—Presi
dent Cleveland to-day transmitted his
annual message to congress. Con
densed, it is as follows:
To the Congress of the United States:
—As representatives of the people in
the legislative branch of their govern
ment, you have assembled at a time
when the strength and excellence of
our free Institutions and the fitness of
our cltlsens to enjoy popular rule have
been again made manifest. A political
contest Involving momentous conse
quences. fraught with feverish appre
hension, and creating aggressiveness
BO intense as to approach bitterness
and passion, has been waged through
out our land, and determined by the
fjs&t decree of free and Independent suf
&.'± (rage, without disturbance of our tran-
nullity or the least sign of weakness in
T#«our national structure. When we con
si*'.. elder these Incidents and contemplate
S$Z the peaceful obedience and manly sub
mission which have succeeded a heated
clash of political opinions, we discover
it abundant evidence of a determination
"f-i on the part of our countrymen to abide
by every verdict of the popular will,
and to be controlled at «11 times by an
abiding faith In the agencies estab
&?• lished for the direction of the affairs
of their government. Thus our people
exhibit a patriotic disposition, which
£x entitles them to demand of those who
undertake to make and execute their
|isf-, laws such faithful and unselfish ser
,f vice in their behalf as can only be
prompted by a serious appreciation of
the trust and confidence which the ae
ceptance of public duty Invites.
Us. In obedience to a constitutional re
i, ,' qulrement I herein submit to tho con
gross certain information concerning
national affairs with the suggestion of
81,0,1
legislation as In my judgment is
necessary and expedient. To secure
brevity and avoid tiresome narration, I
TV shall omit many details concerning
matters within federal control which,
though by no means unimportant, are
more profitably discussed in depart
mental reports. I shall also further
curtail this communication by omit
ting a minute recital of many minor
Incidents connected with our foreign
Relations which have heretofore found
a place In executive messages but are
now contained In a report ol the Treas
ury of State.

right to claim our protection on the
score of American citizenship. Our ef
forts in this direction will not be re
laxed but the deep feeling and sym
pathy that have been aroused among
our people ought not to so far blind
their reason and judgment as to lead
them to demand Impossible things. The
outbreaks of blind fury which lead to
murder and pillage In Turkey occur
suddenly and without notice, and an
attempt on our part to force ^Oh a
hostile presence there as might be ef
fective for prevention or protection
would not only be resisted by the Otto
man government but would be re
garded
soft-
interruption of their
plans by the great nations who assert
their exclusive right to Intervene in
their own time and method for the
security of life and property in Tur
key. I do not believe that the present
somber prospect in Turkey will be
long permitted to offend the sight of
Christendom. It so mars the humane
and enlightened civilization that be
longs to the dose of the nineteenth
century that it seems hardly possible
that the earnest demand of good peo
pie throughout the christian world for
Us corrective treatment will remain un
answered.
SPAIN AND CUBA.
.A Difficult Problem.
Th^" Insurrection in Cuba still con
tinues with all its perplexities. It is
difficult to perceive that any progress
has thus far been made toward the
pactflcation of the Island or that the
5L situation of affairs as depicted In my
last annual message has In the leapt
i^S^lmproved. If Spain still holds Havana
md the seaports and all the consider
able' towns, the insurgents still roam at
(will over at least two thirds of the
Inland country. If the determination
of Spain to put down the insurrection
-seems but to strengthen with the lapse
^s*'of time, and Is evinced by her unhesi
tatlng devo.tlon of largely increased
'military and naval forces to the task,
frS Hhere la much reason to believe- that
Y* the Insurgents have gained in point of
numbers, and character, and resources,
fl#and are none the less Inflexible in their
i^llrcsolve not to succumb, without prac
V'-ftlcally securing the great objects for
which they took up arms. If Spain
has not yet re-established her author
ity, neither have the insurgents yet
made good their title to be regarded as
an
Independent state. Indeed, as the
j-SV contest has gone on. the pretense that
fk-tclvll government exists on the Island,
asp except si far as Spain Is able to maln
i'4?tain it, has been practically abandoned.
Spain doea keep on foot such a gov
ff' ernment, more or less Imperfectly, In
the large towns and their Immediate
S-' suburbs. But, that exception being
Si made, the entire country is either
Sa^given over to anarchy or Is subject
Ajrrto the military occupation of one or
^Sthe other party.

With a view to possible protection by
this government, and not unnaturally
regarded with much indignation by the
country of their origin. The insur
gents are undoubtedly encouraged and
supported by the widespread sympathy
the people of this country always und
instinctively feel for every struggle
for better and freer government, and
which, in the case of the more adven
turous and restless elements of our pop
ulation leads in only too many In
stances to active participation in the
contest. The result is that this gov
ernHHflrtt'1a constantly Mljed upon to
protect American citizens to ciaim«am=
ages for injuries to persons and prop
erty now estimated at many millions
of dollars and to ask explanations and
apologies for the acts of Spanish offi
cials whose zeal for the repression of
rebellion sometimes blinds them to the
Immunities belonging to the unoffend
ing citizens of a friendly power. It
follows from the S£ini6 onuses Inst tli6
United States is compelled to actively
police along the line of sea-coast
against unlawful expeditions, the es
cape of which the utmost vigilance will
not always suffice to prevent. These
inevitable entanglements of the United
States, with the rebellion in Cuba, the
large American property interests af
fected and considerations of philan
thropy and humanity in general, have
led to a vehement demand 1n various
quarters for some sort of positive Inter
vention on the part of the Lnitod
States.

Is Indis­
pensable to life In the way or food,
clothing and shelter is so easily ob
tainable, especially by (hose born ana
bred on the soli, It Is obvious that there
la hardly a limit to the time during
which hostilities of this sort may be
prolonged. Meanwhile, as In all cases
of protracted civil strife, the passions
of the combatants grow more and
more inflamed and excesses on both
sides become more frequent and more
deplorable. They are also participated
In by bands of marauders who now
in the name of one party and now In
the name of the other as may best
suit the occasion, harry the country at
will and plunder Its wretched Inhabi
tants for their own advantage. Such
a condition of things would Inevitably
entail- immense destruction of proper
ty even if it were the policy of both
parties to prevent It as far as prac
ticable. But while such seemed to be
the original policy of the Spanish gov
ernment, it has now apparently aband
oned it and Is acting upon the same
theory as the Insurgent?, namely: that
the exigencies of tho contest require
tho wholesale annihilation of property
that it may not prove of use and ad
vantage to tho enemy.
Decay of Cuban Indmtiy,
It Is to the same end that In pur
suance of general orders Spanish garri
sons are now being withdrawn from
plantations and the rural population
required to concentrate itself in the
towns. The sure result would seem to
be that the Industrial value of the Is
land is fast diminishing, and that un
less there is a speedy and radical
change In existing conditions it will
soon disappear altogether. That value
consists very largely, of course. In its
capacity to produce sugar—a capacity
already much reduced by the Interrup
tions to tillage which have taken place
during the last two years. It Is re
liably asserted that should these Inter
ruptions continue during the current
year and practically extend, as is now
threatened, to the entire sugar pro
ducing territory of the Island so much
time and so much money will be re
quired to restore the land to its nor
mal productiveness that it is extremely
doubtful if capital can be induced to
even make the attempt. The spectacle
of the utter ruin of an adjoining coun
try. by nature one of the most fertile
and charming on the globe, would en
gage the serious attention of the gov
ernment and the people of the TJplted
States In any circumstances. In point
of fact, they have a concern with It
which Is by no means of a wholly senti
mental or philanthropic character. It
lies so near to us as to be hardly sep
arated from our territory. Our actual
pecuniary interest In It Is second only
to that of the people and government
of Spain. It is reasonably estimated
that at least from 130,000,000 to $50,000,
000 of American capital are invested in
plantations and In railroad, mining
and other business enterprises on the
Island. The volume of trade between
the United States and Cuba, which in
1SS0 amounted to about $84,000,000, rose
in 1893 to about $103,000,000, and In 1S94,
the year before the present insurrec
tion broke out, amounted to nearly $96,
000,000. Besides this large pecuniary
stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the
United States finds Itself Inextricably
Involved in the present contest In other
ways both vexatious and costly.
Not Now PobhIMP.
It was at first proposed that bellig
erent rights should be accorded to tho
Insurgents—a proposition no longer
ur«red because untimely and in prac
tical operation clearly perilous and ln
lurious to our own Interests. It has
since been and is now sometimes con
tended that the Independence of the in
surgents should be recognized. But im.
nerfect and restricted as the Spanish
irovernmeni of the island may be. no
other exists there—unless the will of
the military officer in temporary com
mand of a particular district can he
dignified as a species of government.
It is now also suggested that the Uni
ted States should buy the Island—a
suggestion possibly worthy of consid
eration if there were any evidence of
a desire or willingness on the part of
Spain to entertain such a proposal. It
is urged, finally, that, all other meth
ods falling, tho existing internecine
strife In Cuba should be terminated by
our Intervention, even at the cost of a
war between the United States and
Spain—a war which its advocates con
fidently prophesy could be neither large
In Its proportions nor doubtful in its
issue. The correctness of this forecast
need be neither affirmed nor denied.
The United States has nevertheless a
character to maintain as a nation,
which plainly dictates that right and
not might should be the rule of its con
duct.
gaya Tliat Wo Shonld Kcapect Spain.
Further, though the United States is
not a nation to which peace is a neces
sity, it is in truth the most pacific of
powers, and desires nothing so much
as to live In amity with all the world.
Its own ample and diversified domaiiw
satisfy all possible longings for terri
tory, preclude all dreams of conquest,
and prevent any casting of covetous
eyes upon neighboring regions, how
ever attractive. That our conduct to
ward Spain and her dominions has
constituted no exception to this nation
al disposition, is made manifest by the
course of our government, not only
thus far during the present Insurrec
tion, but during the ten years that fol
lowed the rising at Yara In 1868. No
other great power, It may safely be
said, under circumstances of similar
perplexity, would have manifested the
same restraint.,and the same patient
endurance.
It may also be said that this per
sistent attitude of the United States
toward Spain ih connection with Cuba,
unquestionably evinces
no
slight respeat
and regard for Spain on the part of the
American people. They in truth do not
forget her connection with the discov

Nevertheless, realizing that suspi
cions and precautions on the part of
the weaker of two combatants are al
ways natural and not always unjusti
fiable—being sincerely desirous, in the
interest of both as well as on its own
-aecount,-that the Cuban problem should
be solved with the least,.j5"osslble delay
—It was Intimated by/ihts government
to the government of Spain some
jnonthf prgo that, If a satisfactory
meJrt&rt!' of home ruie were tendered
the Cuban Insurgents, and would be ac
cepted by them upon a guaranty of Its
execution, the United States would en
deavor to find a way not objectionable
to Spain of furnishing such guaranty.
While no definite response to this Inti
mation has yet been received from the,
Spanish government, it is believed to
be not altogether unwelcome, while, as
already suggested, no reason is per
ceived why It should not be approved
by the Insurgents. Neither party can
fall to see the Importance of early ac
tion, and both must realize that to pro
long the present state of things for
pypn a short, period will add enormous
ly to the tfine HW1 latiui anil tinpcinJl*
ture necessary to bring about the in
dustrial recuperation of the Island. It
is, therefore, fervently hoped on all
grounds that earnest efforts for healing
the breech between Spain and the In
surgent Cubans upon the lines above
indicated may be at once Inaugurated
and, pushed to an Immediate and suc
cessful Issue. The friendly offices of
the United States, either in the man
ner above outlined or in any other way
consistent with our constitution and
laws, will always be at the disposal of
either party. Whatever circumstances
may arise, our policy and our Interests
would constrain us to object to the ac
quisition of the island or an interfer
ence with Its control by any other
power.
If Spain Fall*.
It should be added that it cannot be
reasonably assumed that the hitherto
expectant attitude of the United
Stales will be Indefinitely maintained.
While we are anxious to accord all due
respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we
cannot view the pending conflict in all
its features, ami properly apprehend
our inevitably close relations to it, and
its possible results, without consider
ing that by the course of events we
may oe drawn into such an unusual
and uni:recedented condition, as will
fix a limit to our patient waiting for
Spain to end the contest, either alone
and In her own way, or with our friend
ly co-operation. When the inability of
Spain to deal successfully with the
insurrection has becomc manifest, and
It Is demonstrated that her sovereign
ty Is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of
lis rightful existence, and when a
hopeless struggle for its re-establish
ment has degenerated into a strife
which means nothing more than the
useless sacrifice of human life and the
utter destruction of the very subject
matter of the conflict, a situation will
be presented in which our obligations
to the sovereignty of Spain will be
superseded by higher obligations,
which we can hardly hesitate to recog
nize and discharge.
Referring the choice of ways and
methods until the time for action ar
rives, we should make them depend
upon the precise conditions than exist
ing and they should not be determined
upon without giving careful heed to
every consideration involving our
honor and Interest, or the International
duty we owe to Spain. Until we face
the contingencies suggested, or the sit
uation is by other incidents impera
tively changed, we should continue In
the line of conduct heretofore pursued,
thus In all circumstances exhibiting
our obedience to the requirements of
public law and our regard for the duty
enjoined upon us by the position we
occupy in the family of nations. A
contemplation of emergencies that may
arise should plainly lead us to avoid
their creation either through a care
less disregard of present duty or even
an undue stimulation and 111-tlmed ex
pression of feeling. But I have deemed
it not amiss to remind the congress
.that a time may arise when a correct
policy and care for our interests as
well as a regard for the interests of
other nations and their citizens joined
by, considerations of humanity -and 'a
desire to see a rich and fertile coun
try, Intimately related to us saved
from .complete devastation will con
strain our government to such action
as will subserve the Interests thus In
volved and at the same time promise
to Cuba and Us Inhabitants an oppor
tunity to enjoy the blessings of peace.

most patriotic and enlightened of Span

and disposition of the Spanish govern

lic opinion In Spain, that this govern
ment has hoped to discover the most
promising and effective means of com
posing the present strife, with honor
and advantage to Spain and with tne
achievement of all the reasonable ob
jects of the Insurrection.
A Hint to Spain.
It would seem that if Spain should
offer to Cuba genuine autonomy—a
measure of home rule which, while pre
serving the sovereignty of Spain,
would satisfy all rational requirements
of her Spanish subjects—there should
be no just reason why the pacification
of the island might not be effected on
that basis. Such a result would ap
pear to be in the true Interest of all
concerned. It would at once stop the
conflict which Is now consuming the.
resources of the Island, and making
It worthless for whichever party may
ultimately prevail. It would keep In
tact the possessions of Spain without
touching her honor, which will be
consulted rather than impugned by
the adequate redress of admitted
grievances. It would put the prosper
ity of the Island and the fortunes of
Its inhabitants within their own con
trol, without severing the natural and
ancient ties which bind them to the
mother country, and would yet enable
them to test their capacity for self
government under the most favorable
conditions. It has been objected on
the one side that Spain should not
promise autonomy until her insurgent
subjects lay down their arms. But the
reasonableness of a requirement by
Spain, of unconditional surrender on
the part of the Insurgent Cubans
before their autonomy is conceded,
Is not altogether apparent. It ig
nores Important features of the
situation—the stability two years'
duration has given to the insurrec
tion the feasibility of its indefinite
prolongation in the nature of things,
and as shpwn by past experience the
utter and Imminent ruin of the island,
unless the present strife is speedily
composed above all, the rank abuses
which all parties in Spain, all branches
of her government and all her leading
public men concede to exist and pro
fess a desire to remove.
Facing such circumstances to with
hold the proffer of needed reforms until
the parties demanding them put them
selves at mercy by throwing down
their arms has the appearance of neg
lecting the gravest of perils and invit
ing suspicion as to the sincerity of any
professed willingness to grant reform.
The objection on behalf of the Insurg
ents—that promised reforms cannot be
relied upon must of course be consid
ered, though we have no right to as
sume and no reason for assuming that
anything Spain undertakes to do for
the relief of Cuba will not bo done ac

ter of the undertaking.

POSTAL AFFAIRS.
The Anuual Deficit, Ktc.
Our po8tofflce department is In good
condition, and the exhibit made of its
operations during the fiscal year end
ed June 30, 189G, if allowance Is made
for imperfections in the laws applic
able to it. Is very satisfactory. The to
tal receipts during the year were $82,
499,208.40. The total expenditures were
$90,626,296.84, exclusive of $1,559,898.27,
which was earned by the Pacific rail
road for transportation and credited on
their debt to the government. There
was an increase of receipts over the
previous year of $5,516,080.21. or 7.1 per
cent, and an Increase of expenditures of
$3,836,124.02, or 4.42 per cent. The de
ficit was $1,679,956.19 less than that of
the preceding year. The chief expendi
tures of the postal service are regulated
by law arid are not in the control of the
postmaster-general. All that he can ac
complish by the most watchful admin
istration and economy is to enforce
prompt and thorough collection and ac
counting for public moneys and such
minor savings in small expenditures
and in letting those contracts, for post
office supplies and star service, which
are not regulated by statute. An ef
fective co-operation between the audi
tors'office and the postoffice department
and the making and enforcement of
orders by the department requiring im
mediate notification to their sureties of
all delinquencies on the part of post
masters and compelling such postmas
ters to make more frequent deposits of
postal funds have resulted in a promp
ter auditing of their accounts and
much less default to the government
than heretofore. The year's report
shows large extensions of both star
route service and railway-mall serv
ice, with Increased postal facilities
Much higher accuracy in handling
mails has also been reached, as ap
pears by the decrease of errors In the
railway mall service and the reduc
tion of mall matter returned to the
dead letter office. The deficit for the
last year, although much less than that
of the last and preceding years, em
phasizes the necessity for legislation to
correct the growing abuse of second
class rate£ to which the deficiency is
mainly attributable. The transmission at
the rate of one cent a pound of serial
libraries, advertising sheets, "house
organs" (periodicals advertising some
particular "house" or Institution) sam
ple copies, and the like, ought certain
ly to be discontinued. A glance at the
revenues received for the work done
last year will show more plainly than
any other statement, the gross abuse
of the postal scrvlcc and the growing
waste of its earnings: The free matter
carried in the mails for the department,
offices, etc. of the government, and
for^congress, in pounds, amounted to
THE NAVY.

The work of the navy department sind
Its present*condltift are ftt!ly exhibited
In the report of the secretary. The con
struction of vessels for our new navy
has been energetically prosecuted by
the present administration upon the
genfal llhes previously adopted, the

factory. It haa been decided, however,
to provide In every shlp-bulldlng con
tract that the builder should pay all
trial expenses, and It has also been de
termined to pay no speed premiums In
future contracts. The premiums re
cently earned and some yet to be de
cided are featurea of—the contracts
made before this conclusion waa
reached.
On March 4, 1803, there were In com
mission but two armored vessels, the
double*
terreted Monitors, Miantono
moh and Monterey. Since that date or
vessels theretofore authorized there
have been placed In their first commis
sion three first-class and two second
class battleships, two armored cruisers,
one harb^r-defcpsc ram and five double
turreted Monitors* Including the Maine
and the Puritan, just completed. Eight
new unatmored cruisers and two new
gun-boats have also been commission
ed. The Iowa, another battleship, wui
be completed about March 1, ami at
least four more gunboats will be reaay
for sea In the early spring.
It Is gratifying to state that our
ships and their outfits are believed to
be equal to the best that can be man
ufactured elsewhere, and that such no
table reductions have been made in
their cost as to Justify the statement
that quite a number of vessels are
now being constructed at rates as low
as those that prevail In European ship
yards.
Our manufacturing facilities are at
this time ample- for all possible naval
contingencies. Three of our government
navy yards, those at Mare Island, Cai.,
Norfolk, Va., and Brooklyn, N. Y., aie
equipped for ship building, our ordnance
plant in Washington is equal to any
In the world, and at the torpedo sta
tion we are successfully making tne
highest grades of smokeless powder.
Three first-class private ship yards, at
Newport News, Philadelphia, and San
Francisco, are building battle slaps,
eleven contractors, situated in tho states
of Maine, Ithode Island, Pennsylvania.
New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and
the state of Washington, are construct

Two plants arc manufacturing large
quantities of first-class armor, anu
American factories are producing au
tomoblde torpedoes, powder projec

There have been authorized by con
gress since Man h, 1S93, five
ships, six light draft gunboats, sixteen
torpedo boats and one

of all of them have been let. f'1G.

l'eneions.
The diminution of our enormous pen
sion roll and the decrease of pension ex
penditure which have been so often
confidently foretold, still fail in niaterl
al realization. The number of Pension
ers on the rolls at the close of the fiscal
vear, ended June 30, 1896, was 970,678.
This"- Is the largest number ever report
ed. The amount paid exclusively for
the pensions during the year was $l«,
214,761.94, a slight decrease from tliat OL
the preceding year, while the total ex
penditures on account of pension#, in
cluding the cost of maintaining the de
partment and expenses attending pen
sion distribution amounted to $142,206,
550.59, or within a very small fraction
of one-third of the entire expense of
supporting the government during tho
same year. The number of new pen
sion certificates issued was 90,640. Of
these, 40,374 represent original allow
ances of claims and 15,878 Increases of
cximhg pensions.
The number of persons receiving pen
sions from the United States, but re
siding In foreign countries at the close
of the last fiscal year, was 3,781, and
the amount paid to them during the
year was $582,735.38.
The sum appropriated for the pay
inCTrofnreiiBWns~forttie current TISdill
year ending June 30, 1897, is $40,000.
000, and for thes ucceedlng year it is
estimated that the same amount will
be necessary.
Civil Service Hefurni.
The progress made In civil service
reform furnishes a cause for the ut
most congratulation. It has survived
the doubts of its friends as well as the
rancor of its enemies and has gained
a permanent place among the agencies
destined to cleanse our politics and to
Improve, economize sind elevate the
public service.
There are now in the competitive
classified service upward of eighty-four
thousand places. More than half of
these have been included from time to
time since March 4, 1893. A most radi
cal and sweeping extension was made
by executive order dated the 6th day
of May, 1896, and If fourth class post
masterships are not Included In the
statement it may be said that practical
ly all positions contemplated by the
civil service law are now classified.
Abundant reasons exist for including
these postmastershlps, based upon
economy, Improved service and the
peace and quiet of neighborhoods. If,
however, obstacles prevent such ac
tion at present, I earnestly hope that
congress will, without Increasing post
office appropriations, so adjust them as
to permit In proper cases a consolida
tion of these postoffices, to the end that
through this process the result desired
may to a limited extent be accom
plished.
TARIFF AND FINANCES.
I desire to recur to the statements
elsewhere made concerning the govern
ment's receipts and expenditures for
the purpose of venturing upon some
suggestions touching our present tariff
law and Its operation.
This statute took effect on the 28th
day of August. 1894. Whatever may
be Its shortcomings as a complete
measure of tariff reform, it must be
conceded that it haa opened the way
to a freer and greater exchange of
commodities between us and other
countries, and thus furnished a wider
markets for products and manu
facturing.
The only entire fiscal year during
which this law has been In force ended
on the 30tn day of June, 1896. In that
year our Imports increased over those
of the previous year more than $6,500.
000, while the value of the domestic
products we exported, and which found
markets abroad, was nearly $70,000,000
more than during the preceding year.
Those who Insist that the cost to our
people of articles coming to them from
abroad for their needful use should
only be Increased through tariff charg
es to an extent necessary to meet the
expenses of the government, as well as
those who claim that tariff charges
may be laid upon such articles beyond
the necessities of government revenue,
and with the additional purpose of so
Increasing their price In our. markets
as to give American manufacturers and
producers better and more profitable
opportunities, must agree that our tar
iff laws are only primarily justified as
Sources of tevenue 'to enable the gov
ernment to meet the necessary ex
penses of lts maintenance. Considered
as to Itti efficiency In this aspect, the
present law- can by no means fall un
der Just condemnation. During the
only complete fiscal year of its opera
tion It has yielded nearly $$,000,000
more revenue than was received from
tariff duties In the preceding year.
There wa£, nevertheless, a deficit be
tween our receipts and expenditures of
a little more than 925,000,000. This,
however, was not unexpected.

Us

mediate expenditure. With individuals

effort The application of an accumu
lated fund by tho government to the
payment of Its running expenses
is

Financial Legltlatlon Recommended.
This reference to the condition and
prospects of our revenues naturally
suggests an allusion to the weakness
and vices of our financial methods.
They have been frequently pressed up
on the attention of congress in previous
executive communications and the in
evitable danger of their continued tol
eration pointed out. Without now re
peating these details, I cannot refrain
from again earnestly presenting the
necessity of the prompt reform of a
system opposed to every rule of sound
finance and shown by experience to be
fraught with the gravest peril and per
plexity. The terrible civil war which
shook the foundations of our govern
ment more than thirty years ago
brought in its train the destruction of
property, the wasting of ou coun
try's substance, and the estrangement
of brethren. These are now past and
forgotten. Even the distressing loss of
life the conflict entailed is but a sacred
memory, which fosters patriotic senti
ment and keeps alive a tender regard
for those who nobly died. And yet there
remains with us to-day in full strength
and activity as an Incident of that
••emendous struggle, a feature of Its
.anclal necessities, not only unsulted
to our present circumstances, but mani
festly a disturbing menace to business
security and an ever-present agent of
monetary distress.
Becausc we may be enjoying a tem
porary relief from its depressing In
fluence, this should not lull us into a
false security nor lead us to forget the
suddenness of past visitations.
I am more convinced than ever that
we can have no assured financial peace
and safety until the government cur
rency obligations upon which gold may
be demanded from the treasury are
withdrawn from circulation and can
celled. This might be done, as has been
heretofore recommended by their ex
change for long term bonds bearing a
low rate of interest or by their redemp
tion with the proceeds of such bonds.
Even if only United States notes
known as greenbacks were thus retired
it is probable that the treasury notes Is
sued in payment of silver purchases
under the act of July 14, 1890, now paid
in gold when demanded would not
create much disturbance as they might
from time to time when received in
the treasury by redemption in gold or
otherwise be gradually and prudently
replaced by silver coin. This plan of
issuing bonds for the purpose of re
demption certainly appears to be the
most effective and direct path to the
needed reform.
In default of this, however, it would
be a step in the right direction if cur
rency obligations redeemable in gold,
whenever so redeemed, should be can
celled Instead of being reissued. This
operation would be a slow remedy, but
it would Improve present condition.
National banks should redeem their
own notes. They should be allowed to
Issue circulation to the par value of
bonds deposited as security for Its re
tirement of United States notes an'i
demption, and the tax on their circu
treasur.v notes issued under the law
lation should be reduced to one-fourth
of one per cent.
In considering projects for the re
Mrsmcr.t of United States notes and
treasury notes issued under the law of
1890, I am of the opinion that we have
placed too much stress upon the
danger of contracting the currency and
have calculated too little upon the gold
tliat would bo added to our circulation
If Invited to us by letter and safer
financial methods. It is not so much
a contraction of our currency that
should be avoided as its unequal dis
tribution.
This.might be obviated and any fear
of harmful contraction at the same
time removed, by allowing the organi
zation of smaller banks and in less
populous communities than are now
permitted, and also authorizing existing
banks to establish branches In small
communities under proper restrictions.
Another topic In which our people
rightfully take a deep interest may
here be briefly considered. I refer to
the existence of trusts and other huge
aggregations of capital, the object of
which is to secure the monopoly of
some particular branch of trade, in
dustry or commerce, and so stifle
wholesome
competition.

When these
UTC OeTended it's usually on the ground
that though they increase profits they
also reduce prices, and thus may bene

liowever. that a reduction of prices to
the people Is not one of the real objects
of these organizations, nor Is their
tendency necessarily in that direction.
It it occurs in a particular case it. is
only because It accords with the pur
pose or interest of those managing the
scheme.

Such occasional results fall far short
of compensating the palpable evils
charged to tho account of trusts and
monopolies. Their tendency is to crush
out individual Independence and to hin
der or preventt he free use of human
faculties and the full development of
human character. Through them the
farmer, tho artisan and the smalls trad
er is in danger of dislodgment from the
proud position of being his own master,
watchful of all that touches his coun
try's prosperity, in which he has an In
dividual lot and interested in all that
affects the advantages of business of
which he is a factor, to be relegated to
the level of a mere appurtenance to a
great machine, with little free will,
with no dutv but of passive obedience,
and with little hope of opportunity of
rising In the scale of responsible and
helpful citizenship.
To the instinctive belief that such Is
tho Inevitable trend of trusts and mo
nopolies Is due the widespread and
deep-seated popular aversion In which
they are held and the not unreasonable
insistence, that whatever may be their
Incidental economic advantages, their
general effect upon personal character,
prospects and usefulness can not be
otherwise than injurious.
Though congress has attempted to
deal with this matter by legislation the
laws passed for that purpose thus far
have proved Ineffective, not becausc of
any lack of disposition or attempt to
enforce them, but simply because the
laws
themselves as interpreted by the
courts do not reach the difficulty. If
the Insufficiencies of existing laws can
be remedied by further legislation It
should be done. The fact must be rec
ognized, however, that all federal leg
islation on this subject may fall short
of its purpose because of inherent ob
stacles and also because of the complex
character of our governmental system.
It does not follow, however, that this
Is the limit of the remedy that may be
applied. Even though it may be found
that federal authority Is not broad
enough to fully reach the case, there
can be no doubt of the power of the
several states to act effectively In the
premises, and there should be no rea
son to doubt their willingness to Judi
ciously exercise such power.
In concluding this communication.
Its last words shall bo an appeal to the
congress for the most rigid economy In
the expenditure of the money It holds
in trust for the people. The way tc
perplexing extravagance Is easy, but
return to frugality Is d'fflcult.
