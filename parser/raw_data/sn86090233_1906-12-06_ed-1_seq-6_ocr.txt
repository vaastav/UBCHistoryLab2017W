While the writer was urging action
on the part of those present at the
meeting of agricultural commissioners
and workers at Jacksonville, Fla., re
cently toward concerted action for
broadening the cotton market both at
home and abroad, and in discussing
the proposition to cover our cotton
with goods made from low grades and
making sacks for fertilizers and simi
lar uses from storm cotton, a distin
guished gentleman in the party took
issue and pronounced the proposition
a sophistry He further stated that
is was wrong to try to force manu
facturers of fertilizers to use goods
made from cotton if they did not want

years.
to do something for the farming class
es there is always some one to ob
jeot and claim that the plan is not rea
aonabie or just to the manufacturer.
They forget that the same manufact
do just as they please, forcing
the farmer what they choose and
he has no recourse in the matter.
Union labor in the plant, but when
the consumer, the cotton planter,
wants a little concession to benefit
himself in furnishing a market for
what he raises with the fertilizer
bought, there is a cry of forcing them
to do something they do not want to.
The trusts and combines have defend
ers everywhere that are always anxi
ous to take up the cudgel in their de
fense, many of them coming from
sources that should have supplied de
fenders for the agricultural people.
As the writer stated in his address be
fore that body, every interest has been
fostered by special legislation, dona
tions or concession except the fanners
and it is uow high time that they
were being recognized by a govern
ment that has its very foundation and
.sinews of perpetuation upon the
Iresults of their labor.

The dozens of supposed to be im
proved CoPon seeds that are being
offered planters at fancy prices bring
'to the front again the fact that any
fanner by the process of selection can
improve his seed and in a short time
make them almost if not quite so
good as any offered. By a system of
•neglect he can in the same short time
run down the best to ordinary cotton.
F. M. Berryhill of Aline, Amite county
verifies this fact in a letter to the writ
•cr of recent date. He says: "I write
you a few lines to let the thousands
who read your department weekly
•know what can be accomplished by a
system of seed selection in improving
i»or. crops. In the year 1898 I had my
entire cotton crop planted in what
'was known as the Brandon eotton. I
found a few stalks that were extra
.good and from these I carefully pick
ed the eotton, had it ginned separately
and planted in a patch to itself next
year. I have been doing the same
'thing every year since and now have
:a cotton that is very early and prolific
On good land and with proper cultiva
tion it will make two bales to the acre
*and a 500 pound bale from 1,200 to
: 1,300 pound of dry seed cotton. It
lhas small seed large bolls and is easily
picked. A neighbor this fall got a
♦530 pound bale from 1,270 pounds of
»seed cotton. I am a firm believer in
limproved seeds of all kinds and what
■*I have done can be accomplished by
.'any farmer that will take the time and
^precaution. I am still a young man,
only 39 years of age, have been farm
ling all of my life and exppcct to keep
fit up. I cannot see why so many young
men want to leave the country and go
to town when the farm offers so much
to those who will nse their energy
and brains in the right direction. I
prefer to live in the country, raise
fine cotton, good corn, dmoe jersey
hogs and rhode island red chiékens."
England made a total profit of 291
million dollars last year from the cot
ton manufactured of which the raw
material was bought in the South. Of
this enormous sum, 42 millions dollars
made from the cotton produced in the
state of Mississippi and exported.
More than half of what was received
by our planters for the entire crop.
Is this not an enormous' 6um to bo
allowed to leave us when it could and
should be kept here at hornet Our cot
ton should be manufactured right here
and this immense profit kept where
it rightfully belongs. It is high time
that our people were becoming alive
to the importance of such work and
interesting themselves in a movement
that should insure a change to oar
advantage.

Advices from Washington State that
$200,000 will be recommended by the
government engineers for improve

year. This is independent of the work
being done in deepening the pass al
Horn island and is significant of great
things for Pascagoula harbor. The
original project of expending five
million dollars on this naturally pro

in the world, will be carried out in
Che next few years. Mississippi ii

The several flower show given bj
communities in the state during thi
past three weeks were all reporte«
as splendid successes. The display)
were good and the attendance ail tha|
could have been desired. Mississipp
is well adapted to the culture of flow

people are finding the industry I
profitable one. There is a movement
now on foot at Jackson to organize
a company with a capital of $25,00C
to grow flowers for the trade. Sue!

success.

CARELESSNESS
OF OPERATOR
JAUSED THE FATAL WRECK ON
SOUTHERN RAILWAY.

peared and détectives are scouring
the country.
Lynchburg, Va., —The cause of the
vreck near Lawyers depot in which
President Samuel Spencer and his
jarty lost their lives, lies absolutely
it the door of C. B. Mattoax, the op
irator who was in charge of the block
elegraph station at Rangoon. Mat
»ax, who disappeared less than an
lour after the wreck, has not béen
îound despite the fact that the rail
oad detectives have scoured the
jountry in the vicinity of the rail
way and his home at Sandy Level,
.'orty miles from the scene of the ac
jident. An official cf the Southern
Railway said, late this afternoon, that
;he company is desirous of apprehend
ing Mattox to secure a statement
Jhat might throw some light on the
;auses that led him to allow the two
rains in the same block at the same
iqie. This official was dot prepared
0 state today whether or not the
ompany would take steps to prose
ute the missing operator, nor if he
ould be prosecuted under the laws
f the state of Virginia.
An examination of the telegraph
beets kept at the Rangoon and Law
yers block office, discloses the fact
that Mattoax allowed train 33, the
lacksonville express, upon the block,
the train passing his station and get
ting a clear track from his at 6:06
»'clock. The operator at Lawyers,
the next station ahead, claimed that
Mattoax did not ask him for a "clear
track" for No. 33, and he therefore
lid not know that the train had pass
'd Rangoon. The block sheet at Law
'ers bears out this elaim.
Supt. W. S. Andrews, of the Dan
ille division, explained that the re
sort that the engine of the forward
train had gone some distance ahead
>f its train when it became detached,
was erroneous, and that the engine
iras not more than twenty feet from
die train. The trouble which caus
ed the train to stop was the breaking
>f a knuckle of the drawhead on the
front end of the forward car. The
trainmen were repairing this when
he collision occurred.
General Superintendent E. A. Coap
nan states there is not the slightest
loubt but the flagman made every
possible effort to protest the rear of
the train, but he could not get around
1 sharp curve in time to prevent the
collision. As soon as Engineer Kinney
saw the signal he applied the emer
gency brakes aud remained at his
host to the laçt.
General Superintendent E. A. Coap
man, of the company, gave out the
following statement to the represen
tative of the Associated Press :
Investigation so far made and
the developments indicate that Op
arator Mattoax at Rangoon let train
No. 33 into the block and, disregard
ing the rules, failed to notify the op
erator at Lawyers depot of this fact.
When the first seetion of train No. 37,
the Washington and Southwestern
vestibuled limited, approached Ran
goon, Operator Mattoax asked the op
erator at Lawyers for the block on
No. 37. This was given by the op
erator at Lawyers, who did not know
that No. 33 had gone in on the block.
No. 33 broke down at the south
end of a curve and as soon as the
train stopped the flagman had pro
ceeded about 600 yards when No. 37
was in view on the curve. Engineer
Kinney saw the signal and applied
the emergency brakes, but he did not
have time to leave his seat before the
collision took place.
An inspection of the telegraph
sheets in each of the block stations
substantiated this belief. The sheet
at Rangoon shows that. No. 33 was
given the block by Operator Mattoax,
and the sheet at Lawyers shows that
Mattoax had not notified the opera
tor there that No. 33 was on the block
and entitled to it.
A fuller investigation will be
made as speedily as possible, but we
do not expgct to develop additional
facts. The company has a number of

Thoroughly Justified.
Washington—-Efforts of prominent
Corpany to get the State Department
stockholders in the Gulf Fisheries
to take action against the Mexican
government for seizing one of the
company's fishing boats met
failure. The delegation of stock
holders called on Assistant Secretary
Baeon and went ovei* the whole case
with him. They were told that in the
opinion of the department the Mexi
can government bad a clear case
against the Gulf Fisheries Company
aud that nothing could be done by
this government.
Some months ago the fishing smack
Lizzie Adams was caught within the
three-mile limit of the Mexican shore
of the Gulf by a Mexican naval
sei. The officers of this vessel ran
close to the Lizzie Adams in a fog
and carefully took the latitude and
longitude before boarding her. The
master of the Lizzie Adams claimed
that she was eleven miles from shore
at the time. The case went to the
lower Mexican court, which decided
it in favor of the Mexican govern
ment. The protests on the part of the
stockholders of the Gulf Fisheries
Company is to the effect that tha
higher court to which they have ap
pealed is likely to sustain the lower
court, and they would like to have
the State Department step in and pre
vent such affirmation. The State
Department, however, has made in
vestigations, and is of the opinion
that the Mexican government is
the right.

Nat GWodwin's Winning.
Nat C. Goodwin, the actor, must ap
pear before the grand jury at the call
of District Attorney Jerome to ex
plain when, where and how he suc
ceeded in winning between $30,000
and $40,000 in gambling in this town.
The only thing that will prevent the
actor's appearance before the grand
jury will be bis absence from the
city. If he is in town one of Mr. Je
rome's subpoena servers will get him
with a summons from the grand jury
room.
It was reported several days ago
that Goodwin had sat in a little game
which lasted for hours, and that
when the game ended he was any

Mr. Jerome knows the press agent
tale when he sees it, but he conclud

Goodwin's winning. The district at

train on the Yazoo aud Mississippi
Valley Railroad, From what can be
learned Hicks was seen on the track
when the train approached from
around a curve and struck him.
The Engineer said he thinks Hicks
was asleep and that he did not see
him in time to prevent the accident.

DRY ROUP CURE.
Take equal parts of alum, sulphur
and magnesia, mix and blow into the
throats of the afflicted fowls with a
small bellows. When roup becomes
epidemic in a flock, put a little car
bolic acid In the drinking water and
burn sulphur In the coops to thor
oughly disinfect them.—The Epito

KICKING COW CURED.
To cure a kicking cow let the
milker take a good, short whip under
the left arm, let him begin milking as
usual, and the moment the cow raises
her foot to kick give her one single
cut with the whip. Never repeat this
until she starts to kick again, and
each time resume milking with a
quiet stroking of the hand and a kind
word. Receiving one cut from the
whip each time she raises her foot to
kick the cow quickly associates cause
with effect and gives up an action
which produces a painful sting. This
method is wholly ineffectual if the
milker loses his temper and gives the
cow several blows, equally so if he
neglects to strike her with the whip
when her kick does no harm.
THE REAL FEEDING PROBLEM.
A good authority has this to
say about rations: It is easy enough
to compose any number of rations
that will ghre satisfactory results.
The real secret of success lies In the
ability of the feeder to devise a ra
tion from the most convenient ma
terials at the lowest possible cost
while keeping well within the limits
of normal quantity and quality, pay
ing proper attention to the question
of succulence so important in dairy
feeding. Each animal differs in the
amount of food she can consume with
advantage, and the chief difficulty lies
in determining the correct quantity
for the individual.
Many experi
ments along this line show widely
divergent results and it is impossi
ble to say of any one ration that this
has the best effect on milk produc
tion.
HOW TO SHARPEN DULL FILES.
To know how dull flies are very
easily sharpened is worth to the
farmer many a round dollar. There
are people who throw away flies
thinking they are worn out, but that'
is in many a case a large mistake.
There is known to me but one way
in which dull files can easily be sharp
ened and sometimes made like new.
The dullness of flies is produced by
the finely ground chips checking be
tween the teeth of flies. The secret
of sharpening flies is the following:
Take one part sulphuric acid and
five parts water. Mix both well to- *
gether and in this solution put dull
flies for 24 hours. Before using
flies after they have been sharpened
in this way wash off the files well
with soap and when dry rub in with
kerosene oil. This process will make
old dull flies like new. Be cautious
with this acid in handling as it is not
to make fun with.—Paul Katz, Rock
house, Tex.
BRAINS IN TRAINING HORSES.
The typical driver and trainer (one
and the same man) is a muscular
person of medium height and weight,
with a noticeably quiet manner and
voice. In fact, that one who, by
common consent, stands at the head
of the calling is known as "the Si
lent Man from Tennessee"—so averse
is he to undue exclamation or con
] «peéts. On the walls of a livery sta
tally in young horses, the correction
of faults of gait or of temper, the
gradual toning down of a spirit too
. bi « h or tempestuous for successful
racing—all this requires not only
( 8yn j pa thy and skill, but an almost
unlimited stock of patience and self
I control. The following was the con*
f elusion of a life-long experience, as
expressed by a famous trainer on a
Readville stable veranda: "It is all
education, and the longer a man
is engaged in taking a fbt of colta
and developing them so that they be
come fast and good race-horses, the
better and more gentle does he be
come as a man."—Boston Transcript,
, versation.
The fact is, the modern horsh is
altogether too highly organized and
too refined an animal to be dealt
with successfully by men who are
much inferior to him in these re
ble in New York where many Speed
way trotters and pacers are boarded
there is a printed rule that no loud
or rough language shall be used to
the horses.

Captain Dolly, of Fort Leaven
worth, has been struck by lightning
three times. He received his first
shock twenty years ago. At that
time one of his knees had been badly
crooked by rheumatism and one fin
ger was so badly out of shape that he
had planned to have it amputated.
After the stroke his Joints limbered
up and get well.—Kansas City Jour
