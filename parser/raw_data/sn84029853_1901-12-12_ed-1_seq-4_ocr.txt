THURSDAY, DEC. 12, 1901.
Eastern Colorado and Western
Kansas, within five years, will be on
the ground floor in the active devel
opment of natural resources.
Secretary Gage estimates that th
total government revenues for the
current fiscal year will amount to
$688,633,042. Out of this b figures
there will be a net surplus of $100,
O00.000. Some people regard the land sales
in Western Kansas as a "boom."
Hardly. Only the preparation for a
boom. When emigration sets in in
real earnest the speculative fever will
take deep root. Haw prairie are
now selling as high as seven dollars
an acre.
Western people are cheered over
the President's recommendation that
the Government control irrigation.
"Under a uniform system of develop
merit the rights of all people would
be protected. We can hardly im
agine the extent of the benefit to be
derived by the saving of the waters
of the mountains in the use of irriga
tion. The foe of the cigarette is out with
a big hammer this season. His first
declaration is that, "a cigarette is a
roll of paper, tobacco and drugs with
a small light t one end and a large
fool at the other. Some of its chief
enjoyments are condensed nightmare,
fits, cancer of the stomach; spinal
mengitis, softening of the brain, fun
eral processions, families shrouded in
gloom."
The official ballot next year will be
fully twice as large as any ballot
ever voted in the state since the en
actment of the original Australian
ballot law. There will be thirteen
state officers, a district cungressman,
a district judge, about nine county
officers, a complete township ticket,
including road overseers, and two
constitutional amendments on the
ballot. T3y the time half a dozen par
ties get their tickets on the ballot it
will be as large as a circus poster.
The plan to store the waste waters
of the plains is a simple one. Nature
lias provided natural reservoirs, and
by simply darning the draws, the
work is complete. The sub-irrigation
from this water storage would be felt.
All farmers know that below a pond
of water the earth is saturated with
moisture and vegetation thrives. The
diffusion of water by evaporation and
otherwise would increase humidity
and lessen the bad effects of dry
winds.
The News does not ordinarily call
attention to its own work, but it will
not be criticized for saying with some
pride that is the only daily newspa
per between Topeka and Pueblo that
published the President's message
the day of its delivery. From Hutch
inson to Colorado on the Santa Fe,
Missouri Pacific and Rock Island
railway systems the news went with
&Ir. Roosevelt's important message
twelve to twenty-four hours in ad
vance of any other paper. Hutchin
son News.
An Evangelist's Stor j.
'I suffered for years with a bronchial
or lung trouble and tried various, reme
dies but did not obtain permanent relief
until I commenced using One Minute
Cotigh Cure," writes Kev. James Kirk,
man, evangelist of Belle .River, 111. "I
have no hesitation in recommending it to
all sufferers from maladies of this kind."
One Minute Cough Cure affords immedi
ate relief for coughs, colds and all kinds
of throat and lung troubles. For croup it
is unequalled. Absolutely safe. Very
pleasant to take, never fails and is really
a f.-ivorite with the children. They like It.
Rath & Bai abridge.
A NEW RUSH TO KANSAS.
D. O. McCray, immigration com
missioner of Kansas, says the weekly
homeseekers' excursions which the
railroads are running, bring men to
Kansas who really come to buy land
and make their homes in the State.
In former years these excursions
have been of little value to the State.
This year they bring actual settlers.
The tide has turned from Texas and
Oklahoma to Kansas, and farm lands
are advancing in value in consequence.
The whole State, not any particular
part, is getting the benefit of this new
population.
F. J j. Martin, Mayor of Hutchin
son, confirms Mr. McCray. "Ijand
in Reno county," he said, "has risen
to $20 and $30 an acre, and is in good
demand. One man came up from
Oklahoma last week and bought six
quarters around Hutchinson. All
kinds of land is in demand in our
part of the State. Western farm land
brings not less than $5 an acre, and
the sand hill lands are selling at $1.25
to $2.50."

Several physicians said lie had consump

Dr. King's New Discovery for Consump
tion and writes '-it completely cured me
and saved my life. I now weigh 227

OUTLINING IRRIGATION.
Western members of Congress have
formulated a plan for irrigation as
proposed in the President's message.
A Washington telegram states that it
is believed that the bill will be one
providing for a survey, with a view
to the inauguration of an extensive
system of irrigation, which will
eventually contemplate the expendi
ture of more than $500,000,000. It
is not the intention to ask for legisla
tion looking to any such expenditure
by the national government. Instead
a survey will be asked. Later the
government will be asked to construct
reservo;rs at the headwaters of the
different streams. After the con
struction work is completed the bill to
be framed will contemplate state con
trol of the distribution of water.
Some provision will be made for
handling the necessary .interstate
questions. The feature of the New
lands bill, which provides for the
creation of a fund for irrigation pur
poses from the sale of public lands,
will be embodied in the new meas
ur. The receipts from this source
are now about $1,250,000 per annum.
Public land funds will be diverted and
expended for the building of reser
voirs, and the cost of surveying and
supervisory engineering. The con
clusions indicated are in direct line
with the recommendations of the
President's message.
A Good Gondii Medicine.
From the Gazette, Toowoomba, Australia.
I find Chamberlain's Cough Remedy is
an excellant medicine. I have been
suffering from a sevare cough for the last
two months, and it has effected a cure.
I iiave great pleasure iu recommending
it. XV. C. Wockner. This is the
opinion of one of our oldest and most
respected residents, xud bas been volun
tarily given in good faith that others
may try the remedy and be benefited, as
was Mr. Wockner. This remedj' is sold

"I learned a trick while iu the Phil
ippines in the matter of keeping birds
out of fruit trees," says a returned
soldier. "It -consists in hanging a
small mirror on the top limbs of the
tree. There should be at least six
inches of string to the mirror, so that
it can swing about as it is blown by
the wind. The flash of the mirror, it
appears, scares the birds away. One
or two 5-cent mirrors hung on a tree
is sufficient, though, of course, three
or four would be that much better. I
was told that this method had worked
in the Philippines successfully for
many years, and that the birds do
not grow familiar with it as they do
with a scarecrow. Since my return
here I find that the mirror scare is
not unknown here, and that it has
been used by Michigan fruit growers
for many years. ' I have tried it my
self in a small way and it is amusing
what a stir it creates among the
birds."

Some of the Meade people who
were driving , west of town a few
miles Friday afternoon saw a large
mountain lion quietly sporting him
self oyer the prairie with an air of
freedom and supremacy. The par
ties drove within 100 yards of
the big beast who atood his ground
waving his tail from side to side
like the ordinary cat. Dan Gerow
was one of the men who saw it and
says he has seen hundreds of these
animals and that there is no doubt
that it was a panther or mountain
lion. In an open country like this
there would be an . opportunity for a
little sport with dogs and a hunting
party should be on foot after such big
game. Such an animal tutned loose
among the cattle of the country would
necessarily cause considerable lost.

Learning to Spell.
At the Northwestern University at
Chicago the students have stopped grub
bing for Greek roots and are digging up
the little green spelling books, according
ro the Tribune. They are compelled to
go away back and sit down with the ru
diments of an English education because
of a ruling of the faculty that no student
will be allowed to graduate from the in
stitution who spells yield yeald," or
shadow "shaddow." The hoy who spells
villian "villan," may get a hundred iu
chemistry, but as spelling is a fundamen
tal process iu the ait of communicating
thought the university believes it will be
more useful to a young man in the battle
of life than knowing the formula of hy
drozincite. The fact is, we will have to go back
very close to the little country sehgol
house iu some of our educational ideas.
Not all the young men wbo are attending
the colleges will be able to hire steno
graphers and typewriters to do their
spelliug for them. Moreover, who is to
do the spelling for the stenographers and
typewriters? Leavenworth Times.

THE POEM.
I stood upon the ocean's sandy beach.
And with a reed I wrote upon the sand
these words :
"Agnes, I love tbee!"
But the winds came and the waves rolled
- mountain high,
And blotted out the' fair impression.
Cruel waves, treacherous sand, fragile
reed ;
Xo longer will I trust thee,
But from the highest mountain peak
I'll pluck the tallest pine.
And, dipped in the crater of Vesuvius,
with it I will write
Upon the high and burnished heavens
these words :
" A Wise Woman' is drawing the larg
est audiences ever known,
And giviDg an entertainment that will
take your breath away. '
Aud I would like to see any dog-gone
wave wash that out.

The president of one of the promi

with particular emphasis on the
necessity of making a good, appear
ance. "When you are looking for work,"
he said, 'be careful that you are pre
sentable. If you have only twenty
four dollurs in the world, spend
twenty dollars for a suit of clothes,
three dollars and a half for a pair of
hoes, fifty cents for a hair cut and
shave. Then walk up to the job,
wherever it is, and ask for it like a
man.
This advice was greeted with

great applause anu toe raiiroau presi
dent eat down amid a storm of
cheers.
The very next morning a dapper
looking young fellow walked into the
outer office of the orator, and hand
ing a note to the clerk said: "Please
give this to the president" The note
read as follows:
"I liave paid twenty dollars for
this suit of clothes, three dollars and
a half for a pair of shoes, and fifty
cents for a hair cut and shave. I
have walked from Harlem, and X
would like a job as conductor on your

The Ottawa Herald says that, Ed
Howe's "ante-mortem statement" is
a knock on religion. The Herald is
wrong. It is a knock on numerous

Howe's idea is that all men are jeal

wives former love . affairs they pro
ceed to kick the roof off, unsod the
yard, and do other wild and woolly
stunts. Howe's "hero" committed
suicide as a -result of wondering how
his wife behaved when she was en
gaged to another fellow. The night
he pulled the trigger he wrote a piece
