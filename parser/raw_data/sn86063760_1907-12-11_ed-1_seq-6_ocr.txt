SO EXPERTS REPORTS.
Charleston Owes O er Thirteen Hun
dred Dollars After Adjustment of
Account.-Farnum's Beer Estab
lishement Financed by the State,
Which Lost by Unauthorized Ac
tions.-State Wil Lose Heavily.
In its report filed with the State
dispensary commission the American
Audit Company charge chaotic con
ditions of bookkeeping, gross neglect
of duty, misapplication of large funds
and loose methods of conducting the
institution. Startling disclosures are
made and the report asserts that the
State lost many thousands of dollars.
The company says that with oppor
tunity of examining missing books dis
closures dwarfing those just made
would result. It submits a bill for $8,
000 for its services.
Many irregularities and criminali
ties are charged in the report, which
consists of 250 typewritten pages.
For one year alone arbitrary entries
aggregrate $100.000 and one book
over S30,000. Illustrating the loose
methods the report says:
UNAUTHORIZED ENTRIES.
"In order to illustrate more fully
'the extent to which unauthorized en
tries were carried, we refer in de
tail to two entries in journal 1, folios
123 and 124, for $5,000 each, under
date of September 30. 1906, made
for the purpose of transferring
$10,000 from the account of the Car
olina Glass Company to the account
of the Richland Distilling Comoany.
It appears that on April 11, 1904, the
sum of $5,000 was paid over to the
Palmetto National Bank of Colum
bia for credit of the Carolina Glass
Company and that on May 12, 1905,
an additianal sum of $5,000 was paid
to the bank cited, for a like purpose.
These amounts were erroneously paid
by the Palmetto National Bank to the
Richland Distilling Company.
"The cash items referred +e above
were charged on the di. ensary
books to the Carolina Glass Comp
any's account and the wrong appli
cation of the $10,000 was presumab
ly discovered by the auditor of the
Carolina Glass Company during the
fall of 1906. A refund from the Rich
land Distilling Company being unob
tainable, the entries mentioned above
were passed on the dispensary books
without the authority, so far as we
are able to ascertain, of the proper
officials.
"The characteristic inattention an
notated above shows that the physi
cal condition of the accounts was an
unknown quantity to the party or
psrties responsible for their keeping,
unresponsible times elapsing before
discovery and adjustment tootc
place."
Many of the original invoices are
not on file. The minute book of the
board for 1005 has been "misplaced."
In a test of the cash receipts of Com
missioner Crum and Tatumn, says the
report, misapplication is clearly es
tablished. Many items appear to
have been intentionally omitted from
the books and the company's repre
sentative asserts that losses reach in
to tens of thousands.
AS TO FARNUM'S ACCOUNTS.
The pages of the report are devot
ed to the account of the Consumers'
Beer Bottling Establishment and the
transactions of J. S. Farnum with
the State dispensary. "The account
is badly mixed up," says the report
"and it seems that agreements be
tween this establisnment and the
board of directors as to the amount
of royalty to be paid the State on the
beer sold were changed at intervals
without any records of such charges
being made.
"A critical observation of the man
agement of transactions carried on
with this company in succee ive stag
es dispels the idea that a fair profit
ever accured to the State out of
the sales and repurchases of beer.
"Beer supplied by this company to
disnensers and hotels for account of
the dispensary was billed to the lat
ter institution at prices apparently
agreed upon, although at intervals
additional invoices were rendered to
the dispensary, recharging State
profits on original purchases resold
to +he State as herein indicated.
fhat the dispensary o~iicials acquies
ced to a refund of State profits is
shown by the credits given for the
aditional invoices. No trace of the
authority room which this acquies
enee emanated could be found.
FINANCED BY THE STATE.
"The dispensary having abandon
ed these profits or royalties placed
the Consumers' Beer Bottling Es
tablishment in a positic . to realize
a profit on beer obtained at first cost
from and financed by the South Car
olina State dispensary.
"No -agreement or contract be
tween the State board of directors
and this company could be located,
and it was therefore impossible to
verify the correctness of the prices
and terms from which sales and pur
chases originated.
"A thorough investigation of this
account with the means at hand leav
es no doubt in our minds that this
company and its predecessor failed
to carry out the stipulations and con
ditions governing operations in beer
in the State of South Carolina.
"We recomxaead, in the interest
of the State, that the books and ac
counts of J. S. Farnum and his suc
ces-ors, tha Consumers' IBeer Bot
tiingr Establishmnent, be subjiected t'M
an examination with a view of dis
closins er extent of transactions fu
accoun. for in the statements filed
with the .s ate dispensary commis
sion."
In the account of the Atlantic
Beach Hotel, Sullivan's Island, the
books showed that a debit balance
of $320.95 was closed out on March
31, 1905, by transferring same to the
account of J. S. Farnum. The suc
cessors to Farnum denied any know
ledge of this account and refused to
pay it.
"It would appear that this ac
count, if not settied, had been neg
lected for a period of nearly three
years prior to its being buried by an
unauthorized transfer, resuking in a
total loss to the State.''

MONEY CAUSED CRIME.
Gold Tainted by Blood of Murder
Found Under a Floor.
Money which was the cause of a
brutal murder seven years ago was
found a few days ago by a carpenter
who was tearing up a floor in the old
Harvey mansion, five miles east of
Wheeling, W. Va. The money, safe
ly enclosed in a strong box, amount
ed to $11,000. Col. James Harvey, a
wealthy retired farme, was the vic
tim of murderers who entered his
home with the object of stealing the
money which was the purchase price
of a farm he had sold. Two men with
criminal records were arrested. con
victed on circumstantial evidence
and hanged for the crime. A. S.
Bell, who purchased the farm and all
of its effects claims that under the
contract the $I1,ooo belongs to him.
Misionary Slain.
Mutilated beyond recognition, the
body of Miss Agnes Templeton, the
only white woman missionary of the
Baptist Indian mission, at Valverde,
Rio Arriba county, N. M., was found
in a grove near the schoolhouse in
that place. Miss Templeton was
working under the Baptist Mission
ary board in New York city. Her
predecessor, a woman, was murder
ed in a similar manner. Either Mex
ieans or Indians are supposed to have
committed the marder, which is re
ported to have been preceded by a
criminal assault. One man is under
arrest as a suspect.
THE, chances now are that Roose
velt and Bryan will be the opposing
candidates in the next presidential
election. Bryan will win.
BRYAN was given an ovation by the
Democrats on the floor of the House
on Monday when he visited that body.
Bryan is a true blue Democrat, and
will always find a warm welcome
among real Democrats.

THE Newberry Observer says
"Col. William Jennings Bryan may
never be president, but he has fur
nished to the American people an ex

served, compliment.

service. This amount is based upon
the enforcement of section 7 of the
Brice law in counties which voted
out the dispensary under that act.
According to the report *but two
counties nave made the levy necces
sary to place funds with the State
treasurer for the purpose of dis
charging their obligations to the
dispensary in this particular. The
counties of Pickens and Newberry
have settled their indebtedncss,
amounting to $2,549.16, leaving

Saysthe report: "Practically all
purchases made by the dispensary

GROWS SECOND.
South Carolina Next to Massachu
setts in Cotton Manufacture.
The Cold Statistics of the United
States Census Reveals the Above
Facts.
The cold statistics of the United
States census bureau frequently re
veal some wonderful things. Among
these, in a bulletin jus;t issued, is
that South Carolina ranks second in
the number of cotton spindles in the
United States, being exceeded only
by Massachusetts, and that during
the past year South Carolina actual
ly increased the number of spindles
more than 150,000.
This interesting bulletin says:
Massachusetts exceeds every other
State in the number of cotton spin
dles, having 9,15S,3S9, or 34 per cent
of the total; South Carolina ranks
second, with 3,609,969, or 13 per cent,
and North Carolina third, with 2,
981,386, or 10 per cent. Rhode Island
has fourth place, Georgia fifth, New
Hampshire sixth and Connecticut
seventh. Massachusetts increased
its number of active spindles during
the year by 307,443, or 3.5 per cent
of the total for the State, while in
North Carolina the increase amount
ed to 262.652, or 11 per cent. The
increase in South Carolina was more
than 450,000 and in New York near
ly 100,000. According to Table 3
there were 1, 141,661 cotton spindles,
exclusive of renewals, added during
the year, thus indicating no cessation
in the progress of the industry. How
ever, the net increase in the total
number of spindles for the year is
1,127,734. This apparent discrepan
cy is accounted for by the fact that
a few plants were dismantled or
abaridoned, and to the reduction of
the spindle capacity in others.
In its annual investigation relative
to the cotton industry the bureau
makes no endeavor to segregate
frame and mule spindles; but if the
proportion between these spindles as
returned at the census of 1905, when
this was done, be applied to the stat
istics of active spindles in 1907 the
figures would be 20.427,395 frame
and 5,947,86 mule.
In addition to the spindles design
ed primarily to spin cotton, 751,251
have been returned as consuming
cotton mixed with other fibres. The
States which lead in the manufac
ture of woollen and knit goods na
turally lead in the number of these
spindles. Of the total number re
ported, 137,190, or 21 per cent, were
returned from Pennsylvania; 110,.
862, or 17 per cent, from New York;
170,462 from Massachusetts, 52,630
from Connecticut, and smaller num
bers from several other States.
Massachusetts leads in the con
sumption of cotton with 1,253,856
bales or 35 per cent of the total for
1 907, followed by North Carolina
Iwith 14 per cent, while South Caro
lina- takes third place with 13 per
cent. The fourth position is held by
IGeorgia with 11 per cent; New Hamp
shire takes fifth, Alabama sixth, and
New York seventh. As stated above,
a comparison on the basis of active
snindles gives some of the States a
shtlusfet rating. Although
Masschusttsincreased its cotton
spindles by more than 300,000, the
quantity of cotton consumed increas
ed lessthan 20,000 bales. If the stat
istics for South Carolina be examin
ed in a similiar manner it will be
found that the quantity of cotton
consumed during the year is 5,705
bales less, while the number of spin
dles operated increased more than
150,000. This would indicate a sig
nificant tendency during the year to
spin finer counts, provided, of course,
that the conditions prevailing in the
.wo years were similiar and the spin.
dies were operated in like manner.
In the mills of the cotton growing
States 970,039 spindles were report
ed as having been idle throughout
the year, which is 66 per cent of the
idle spindles returned for the entire
country. While the scarcity of labor
is largely responsible for this condi
tion throughout the country, it ap
pears more pronounced in the cotton
growing States However, as stated
elsewhere, a considerable number of
the spindles returned as idle from
the cotton growing States were not
infc dethroughout the year, but

MANY CHANGES MADE.
Where the Preachers of the South
Carolina Conference
Are Sent by the Bishop for the Next
Year.-Several Presiding Elders
Sent Into the Pastorate.
A dispatch says the closing (lay
of the South Carolina. Conference,
which met at Gaffney last week and
adjourned on MondLy, will be long
remembered by the Methodists in
South Carolina. It was expected
that there would be many changes in
the Conference, but the Bishop hand
ed out a number of surprises. Be
fore reading the appointments the
Bishop made a talk, setting forth his
reason for making changes.
He said that no one was reduced
because of inefficiency, but because
he believed in rotation of the min
isters both as to place and office. He
thought it right that presiding elders
should go back into the pasturate
and make some new sermons and
stay with their families. Seven of
the old presiding elders were sento
into the pastorate and seven new
ones were appointed. All the old
presiding elders who had been in
office four years and over were sup
erseded by new ones.
The Bishop said he had had all the
experiences of the pastorate and was
not giving any appointments which
he himself had not had. His talk was
well received. The Conference was
in a spiritual condition, having just
held an experience meeting. There
were songs and witnessing, and when
the Bishop arose to read the appoint
ments the body was in a tender
mood. The Bishop begged all to
take their work without complaint
and do the best work of their lives.

CAPTURES BURGLAR.
How a Plucky Little Woman-Saved
Her Valuables.
Mrs. Theresa Calona Finds Noted
Crook in Her Home, Turns Him
Over to Police and Faints.
Mrs. Theresa Calono chased a bur
glar down two flights of stairs in her
home, No. 74 Elder street, Williams
burg, Wednesday evening and cap
tured him after a struggle. Then she
handed him over to a policeman.
Admiring neighbors who called to
offer congratulations marvelled at
the pluck of the pretty, slender
young woman. They marvelled the
more when they heard that the man
was a desperate crook and that he
had-been released only recently after
serving a two years' term at Sing
Sing Prison. '
Mrs. Calono is the wife of Joseph
Calono, a well-to-do commission mer
chant. She is twenty-eight years of
age, and is much admired for her
beauty.
When she returned at 6:30 o'clock
from a shopping trip she was sur
prised that her rooms were lighted
up. She found every jet burning in
the dining room.
Hearingarustling inthenextroom,
she entered. A man, kneeling on the
floor, was packing articles he had
taken from a dresser into a bag. She
had not made the least noise, and he
went on with his work, unconscious
of her presence.
"What are you doing here?" she
demanded.
The startled burglar looked up,
sprang to his feet and dashed into
the parlor. The door leading from
that room to the hall was locked.
The man darted back again toward
the dining room. Mrs. Calono had
preceded him but, before she could
lock the dining room door, he. had
overtook her.
She grappled with him, but the
man struck her in the face, and,
shaking himself loose, ran along the
hall to the stairway and down to the
ground floor.
Mrs. Calono, unmindful of the
blow she had received, followed close
at his heels. In the ground floor hall,
she tripped him by interposing her
foot as he was springing for the front
door.
He recovered his balance, and then
she hit him a blow that sent him spin
ning backward. The burglar retreat
ed to the back end of the hall. Fear
ing he would go down to the base
ment and escape, the plucky woman
cornered him and again grappled
with him.
Then ensued a struggle that took
them from one end of the hall to the
other. The man gradually edged his
way to the front door and managed
to get it open,
He dragged Mrs. Calono through
it to the front step, and was about to
make another effort td jerk himself
loose when the policeman approach
ed. He relieved Mrs. Calono of her
prisoner, and she sank, almost faint
ing, on the doorstep.
There she was found by neighbors,
who, strange to say, had not heard
her cries during the struggle in the
hall. At least they had not respond
ed.
Mrs. Calono had a bruise on her
right cheek. The thief had pilled up
all of the silver and also all the loose
jewelry he could find in the house.
At the Ralph avenue police station
the man gave the name of Matthew
Endrick. He said he was thirty
eight years old, and had no home.
The police recognized in him and old
offender.
JUSTICE Brewer seems sorry te
have caused trouble, but he is not
going to take it back. He said .the
president was playing a game of
"hide and seek" with the nomina
tion, and adds that that is exactly
what he meant.' While we think it
in bad taste for a judge to criticise
the President as justice Brewer did,
we think he sized up Teddy just about
right. _____ __
PNEUMONIA GERMS.
Some Hints to People How to Avoid
the Disaese.
The. Chicago Herald says the
health department began its last
weekly bulletin with the aphorism;:
"Too much fresh air is just enough
--to prevent pneumonia." After
quoting some excellent authorities
on the need of fresh air, it concluded
its advice on this subject by saying:
"Ventilate, ventilate, ventilate-in
doors and out-outdoors by living in
the open air as much as possible."
These are days when pneumonia
threatens all persons who do not take
reasonable precautions against it.
The pneumonia germ is always with
us, but it gets better opportunities
for work under climatic conditions
than under others. When the days
come that people shut themselves up
indoors with closed windows instead
of seeking the fresh air the pneumon
a germ finds its victims.
It is a simple thing to escape the
peril of pneumonia. One does not
need to avoid hard work, but one
must avoid exhaustion from exces
sive exertion without proper relaxa
tion, whether that exertion comes
through work or through dissipa
tioa. One must avoid so far as pos
sible close packed gatherings of men
and women in ill-ventilated halls. If
one has perforce to stay awhile in
such a gathering, a vigorous use of
the lungs in the fresh air immediate
ly afterward should not be omitted.
The commissioner of health him
self took a two-hour walk in the rain
the other day and finished it at a
meeting in a public hall. Some one
regretted that he should have expos
ed himself to pneumonia so reckless
ly in the rain and his answer was
that two hours of open air under the
worst conditions was less. dangerous
than fifteen minutes in the hall he
was in. The story has a moral to
be remembered.

WAR COMES HIGH.
Russia sent a draft for $24,300,
900 to Japan on the 24th, in payment
of the last portion of the debt incur
red In her disastrous war to gobble
up Hanchuria, and incidentally, an
nex certain parts of the Japanese
empire. The draft was to cover the
cost of caring for Russian. prisoners
taken by the victorious Japanese.
The first bill for this was $75,000,
000, but this was offset in part by
a Russian bill of some $40,000,000
for the maintenance of Japanese
prisoners.
Wants Too Much.
The Charleston Post thinks that
"if Mr. Bryan should withdraw him
self from the field of Presidetial Pos
sibilities and support Judge Gray, of
Delaware, for the Democratic nomi
nation there might be something do
ing along the line of victory." ~That
may be true, but it seems to us that
it is asking too much of Mr. Bryan
when we consider what the Post says
further on in the same artlele.
The Post admits that Judge Gray
is a Gold Democrat and an imperial
ist, and goes on to say "if he were
nominated against the wishes of Mr.
Bryan he could not get the support
of the Bryan following, any more
than Mr. Bryan can get the support
of the Cleveland wing of the party,
to which Judge Gray belongs." The
relative strength of the Bryan and
Cleveland wings of the Democratic
party is in th'e proportion of about
ten to one, and The Post wants the
ten to surrender to the one in order
that we might be united. This is ma
jority rate with a vengeance, yet^ it
is the only way according to The Post
that harmony can be brought in the
Democratic party. We tried that
kind of harmong in 1904, and we all
know the result.
"But," says The Post, "if Mr. Bry
an himself should out forward Judge
Gray as the most acceptable candi
date for the Democratic party and
undertake to bring up his following
in support, it might be possible to
make something more than a good
showing at the polls. The conserva
tive Ropublicans, who are in revolt
against Roosevelt, would support
Judge Gray and if Mr. Bryan could
rally-his radicals to the standard a
majority might be rolled up that
would land the Delaware statesman
in the White House."
How in the name of common sense
could Judge Gray be the most ac
ceptable candidate for the Democrat
ic party; when The Post -admits that
he could not be nominated in the
Democratic convention without the
aid of Mr. Bryan. While Bryan polled
over six million votes in 1896 the
Cleveland wing as represented by the
almer and Buckner ticket in that
campaign did not carry but one pre
cinct. and yet The Post wants Bryan
and his followers not only to surren
der to the Cleveland wing, but to
nominate .and elect Judge Gray, a
Gold Democaat. who according to the
Post would not vote for Mr. Bryan
if he was nominated. This is asking
too much. Judge Gray will have to
go on voting the Republican or As
sistant Republican ticket as he did in
1896 and 1900.--Orangeburg Times
and Democrat.
The Maypole.
The Maypole Is still common in
many countries. It used to be general
throughout England. and the cutting
and decorating of' the pole was, one of
the reasons fo9r going a-Maying. Often
the pole was left standing until near
the end of the.year, and sometimes es
peially durable poles remained erect
for many seasons and were used In
successive festivals. The last Maypole
erected in London was -100 feet high
and stood in the Strand. Taken down
in 1717-18, it was removed to Wan
stead park, in Essex, where it was
made part of the support for a large
telescope which was set up by Sir
Isac Newton. 'The, May queen tradi
tionally-represents the.Roman goddess

The Black Death.
It has beene calculated that the terri
ble plague known as - the s'black
d eath" which began to ravage Eu
rope about the year 1340, killed at least
25,000,000 of people in Europe and as
many more in Asia and Africa. By
some the bubonic plague Is thiought to
be similar in nature to the "black
death," but It bas not been demon
strated that such Is the case.-New
York Journal.
Elks Lodge of Sorrow.
"I cannot and I will not say
that he is dead; he is just away.
FWith a cherry smile and a wave of
the hand
He has wandered into an unknown
land;
And left us thinking how wondrous
fair
It needs must be since he lingers
there."
Throughout the United States on
Sunday, wherever there is an organ
ization of the Benevelent and Protec
tive Order of Elks, a iodge of sorrow
was. held to commemorate the life
and work of the, brothers who has
passed away during the current year.
It is one of the most beautiful and
touching customs of the order and
the occasions are always characteriz
ed by services which make them pe
culiarly memorable. The warm side
of the heart is always turned to
wards humanity in gen'eral by this
noble organization, and when it is a
matter of their own brethren the ap
deal to their tenderness is deep and
snere.
"The faults of our brothers we
write ~upon the sands; their virtues
upon the tablets of love and mein
ory." These lines give expression to
the sentiment which appeared to
predominate in the annual memorial
services of Orangeburg Lodge, No.
897, B. P. 0. Elks,, Sunday after1
noon at their hall, an4 are in keepingl
with the well known guiding princi
ples of the order throughout. the
world; charity and brotherly love.
Impressively sad, simple and beau
tiful were the services, and they I
ould not fail to make a lasting im
pression upon the minds of those
who witnessed such a ceremonyv for
the first time, giving them a better
understanding of the work of the
order and the reasons for the pro
verbial loyalty of one Elk to another,

THE HOMESPUN DRESS
Famous Southern Song of The
War Time Period.
The Incident That Lead Lieutenant
Harrington . to Compose It.-His
Death Shortly After.
One of the most popular songs of
the Sorthern Confederacy was writ
ten by Lieut. Harrington, of Ala
bama. During the war the song was
sung all over the Confederacy in
camp and in the homes of'the pdo
ple. Below we print the words of
the- song and the circumstances un
der which it was written:
The Homespun Dress.
Oh, yes, I am a Southern girl,
And rory in the name;
I boast of it with greater pride
Than glittering wealth or fame;
I envy not the Northern girl.
Her robes of beauty rare,
Though diamonds deck her snowy
neek
And pearls bestud her hair.
CHORUS.
Hurrah, hurrah!
- For tqe Sunny South, so dear!
Three cheers for the homespun dress
The S.)uthern ladies wear!
Now Northern goods are out of date;
And, since old Abe's blockade,
We Southern girls can be content
With goods that's Southern made.
We send our sweethearts to the war,
But girls, ne'er do youmind
Your soldier love will not forget
The girl he left behind. 4
The Southern land's a glorious land,'
And has a glorious cause;
Then cheer,.three cheersfor South
ern rights
And for the Southern boys!
We scorn to wear a bit of silk,
A bit of Northern lace
But make our homespun dresses up,
And wear them with a grace.
And, now young.man. aword to you,
If you would win the fair,.
-o to the field where honor calls
-And win your lady there;
Remember that our brightest amilis
Are for the true and brave, '
And that our tears are all for those
Who fill the soldier's grave.
While Morgan's army was in Lei

gave a ball one night in honor of
Morgan's men. On this oeesion, it
is said, the women appeared in home

of Morgan's army, and who attend
ed the ball, *as'so deeply affected by
the flower of Kentucky's young wo
manhood appearing ats ball gowned
in homespun dresses. that he wrote
the words to the song, "The Home
spun Dress." During the evening
the young lieutenant met at the ball
a Miss Earle, and during those few.
hours there grew an attachment be
tween the two that was more than
friendship.
Miss Earle was an accomplished
musician, and improvised an air for
the young lieutenant's song-poem.
and payed and sang iton the piano*
during the evening. It is said that
all the men of Morgan's command
soon learned the words and the air
and .f ten sang, "The Homespun
Dress."
Lieutenant Harrington was killed
in the battle of Perryville, October
8, 1862, only a few- days-after the
ball in Lextington, Ky., where he
wrote the words to the song. .and.

died only a few years ago. She never
married. She kept the manuscript

prized it most hi-.dly.
