A failure to pass will result In seriously

do wrong; and may also prevent the

attending the performance of our In

sufficiently ample power, through I'nlted

the criminal nnd civil stat ites of the
I'nlted States be so amended and ad led

the t'nlted States government, which is
responsible in our International rela
