Romk. December i t.?A Papal bull of
much importance has just been issued in
the Holy City by Pope Pius IX.
The bull likes a strict seal of secrecy on
the prelates who are assembled in the'Gen
eral Council, and also establishes the regu
lation* for the guidance and rule of the pro
feedings of the assemblage. In the.exor
dium the Holy Father exhorts and adjures
the bishops to live in the spirit and prac
tice of the cardinal virtues of charity and
humility, with sobriety and a serious" con
templation of the dignity and reverence of
the oeca-ion during the entire time ot the
meeting. He declares that although the
assemhh d prelates and patriarchs enjoy and
have the right of making propositions to
the entire body at any time, the fact of ihe
< 'ouneil in its essentials belong only to the
Head of the ?'hureli, and the Sacred College,
ami Ecclesiastical 'Court of Rome, as ex
pressed iu the words ei nos et ad aancttim

the most reverend fathers to think and con

('ouneil. but only on the following condi
tions? viz :
Kir-a. That such propositions shall be
made in writing and submitted for scrutiny
privately, or before being placed for de
bate, to a council committee of bishop
named by the Pope beton'hand, and charged
with the duty of examining whether the
resolutions are jn accordance with* Church
discipline.
Second. That all propositions so ordered
-hall have lbr tin ir object, in some manner
-Piled, the general interests of the Church,
and not the intorest- of any one particular
diocese of the ( lunch.
Third. Th.'d each resolution shall lie ac
companied by a statement setting forth the
motives which intlueneed and led to it- pre
sentation.
Fourth. That the resolution or resolu
tions -ball in each instance be couched in
words and language and intent so as to be
made strictly conformable to the spirit,
teachings, and traditions of the Iloly Catho
lic < "hurcti.
His Holiness, by this bull, imposes a bond
of seereev on every p* rson concerned with
the cnnciliary labors. He also li.xes the rule
of older of precedence during the proceed
ings of the body, the prelates ranking in the
following degrees: Cardinal bishops, cardi
nal priests, cardinal deacons, patriarchs,
primates, archbishops, bishops, mitred ab
bot*. and generals of monastic orders.
The l'ope authorizes the appointment of

authorizes and permits them to reside out

WIFE, FOR THE ALLEGED SEDUCTION
OK THE DAUGHTER OF A FRIEND.
Special telegram to Hie Dispatch.
Ciiaki.ottevij.le, December lfJ, 18G9.
Our town was this morning shocked by
one of the most fearful tragedies that lia
ever startled any community. Dr. A. R.
Oliver, recently from England and promi
nent lv connected with emigration schemes,
was shot and instantly killed by Mr. George
S. Aver, of Loudoun county. Both parties
are of the highest respectability, and were
men of considerable meatus. Dr. Oliver
was, to some extent , known In Richmond,
having delivered one or more public ad
dresses in your city. lie was a gentleman
of fine appearance and prepossessing man
ners, of large information, and exceedingly
intelligent.
STATEMENT OF DK. OLIVER'S FAMILY.
Mr. Aver and Dr. Oliver had been on the
most friendly terms, Dr. Oliver having
loaned considerable money to the former.
This morning about sunrise Mr. Aver came
to the house and inquired for the Doctor,
who was then asleep in bed. Mr. Brown, a
brother-in-law, awakened the Doctor, say
ing " Mr. Averts here, and wishes to see
you/"' The Doctor came to his chamber
door in his night clothes, where he met
Aver, and extended liishand, saying "How j
are you, old fellow ? " Aver replied " I do I
not know that I can take your hand," or
something to that effect, and immediately
commenced firing. Oliver retreated into
his chamber, where his wife was in bed,
pursued by Aver, who continued tiring un
til his victim was slain. Four shots were
tired, one taking effect in the breast, another
severing an artery above the heart, and a
third lodged in the throat.
TUK STATEMENT OK MK. A YEP.
is to the effect that last May Dr. Oliver
and his wife came to Ayer's house in
Loudoun, where they were treated with
the utmost Kindness, and boarded for sove
ral months. While there Oliver treated a
daughter of Aver for consumption, and
availed himself of the facilities thus afforded
to seduce her. The ruin of his daughter
came to Mr. Ayer's knowledge only a few
days ago, and he immediately determined
upon vengeance. Comingto Charlottesville
last night, lie remained at the Central Hotel
until this morning, when he went to Dr.
Oliver's residence and inquired for lum.
Was invited into the house and met Oliver
at his chamber door, who extended his
hand. Aver said " I cannot take your
hand : 1 must have your blood for the inju
ries you have done me," drawing at the
same time a revolver and commencing to
tire. Oliver retreated into the chamber of
his wife and cot under the bed, aiul Aver,
-looping down, fired twice upon him in that
nosition.
THE ACCUSED SURRENDERS HIMSELF.
IIis victim (lead, Mr. Aver left the house
at once, and, going to a magistrate, of
fered to surrender himself; but the ma-i
gistrate did not put him under arrest. lie
then went to the house of the county jailor,
where he now is, waiting for the officers of:
justice to take some action.
Aver has been visited at the jail by many
citizens ot Charlottesville to express their,
sympathy for him, and justifying the act.,
.Several clergymen have called?unci among
them were Rev. Messrs. James IS. Taylor,
John E. Hong, and George 15. Taylor, Jr.,
of the Baptistdenomination, who seem to
have been previously acquainted with him.
GKOKQE S. AVER.
Mr. Ayer seems to lie about fifty years of I
age, and is a man of very quiet demeanor.
It is stated that he left home without the
knowledge of his family, as he did not wish
his sons to know what he was about to do,
preferring to to take the execution of justice
into his own hands. Alter lie killed Dr.
Oliver, he sent a telegram to his family, say
ing that he had done what he came to do.
and was lodged in jail. lie i> a man of
wealth and standing, and occupies a promi
nent position in the Baptist church. lie re

THE DECEASED.
Dr. A. It. Oliver is a Scotchman by birth,
but was for twelve years a practicing physi
cian in Birmingham, England. He came to
this country about two years ago 011 a pro
specting tour, and became well known
throughout the State as general agent of an
English company for the promotion of emi
gration to Virginia. Recently he deter
mined to make this State his home, and
was enthusiastic in the praise of his
udopted country. During the late State
Agricultural Fair he was in Richmond, and
delivered an address before the Agricultu
ral Society. At the Fair he had on exhibi
tion a self half-cocking, breech-loading,
double-barreled gun, said to be a fowling
piece of unusual merit, and by the sale of
which he expected to make a handsome
fortune.
Dr. Oliver was about forty years of age.
of prepossessing appearance, and very
agreeable in conversation. lie leaves a
wife, but no children. It is proper to add
that when he met Mr. Aver lie did uot
evince consciousness of having wronged
liini, and manifested great surprise at his
hostile attitude.
Mrs. Oliver witnessed the shooting, and
of course is now in a heart-broken condi
tion. She has the profoundest sympathy of
our people.
Altogether, this is a most distressing af
fair, aud to us it seenis that the families of
both parties to the tragedy deserve the sin
cerest sympathy. "When such occurrences
are as common as they now are, it shows a
terrible state of demoralization. Our law
makers should inquire into the condition of
the statute-books.
VERDICT OF THE JURY.
A coroner's jury being empanelled, after
a full hearing of the evidence they rendered
t lie following verdict :
" We dud that the said Anthony R. Oliver
was killed about 7 o'clock A. M. this De
cember Hi. 1S?>9, by a pistol in the hands of
George S. Aver." * Vidette.

Forrlyn Mail .Service.
The joint resolution offered in the Senate
iy senator Ramsey, Chairman Post-Ottlee,
fce.. Committee, is intended to carry out the
?revision- of the act of Congress July :17th,
Iso's, for transporting mails to Liverpool
ind Bivnv n. The object of the act \va?
plain enough, but the then Postmaster
lb neral placed such a construction upon
-oinc section- of the law that it became
impos-ible for tin- Commercial Steam Navi
gation Coinpain t" conclude the contract
contemplated. In the mean time our mails
have been carried by foreign steamships, of
which 110 arc now regularly plying between
European ports and New Fork, aggre
gating over .'5:2!? tons.
The joint resolution offered to-day looks
to the immediate c-taMi-linient of .-hips of
the New York Commercial Navigation
Company for mail service to Europe. The
company hu.- been recently reorganized,
and is said to represent sfcMUMkOOO, its
.stockholders and officers being men of large
means.
A I>eisio?*r?i Adioralos Ztcpmlia!ion?
Is fiehtilied by his Party.
The scene in I lie House this afternoon at
the conclusion of Mr. .Muni'i n's speech ad
vocating repudiation was at times exciting.
The Republican ineuihers left their seats oil
the wot side ot the hall and clustered
around the Democrats on the east side.
Munbelt advocated unqualified repudiation,
and though he announced that the
.opinions expressed were his own, and
I not intended as the sentiment of the
Democratic party, nevertheless Demo
cratic members deemed it proper to pro
claim 1 hell* unqualified disapproval of
repudiation of the public debt or anything
directly or indirectly tending to that end.
Their incidental arguments were to the
oii'eet that the Republican party were repu
diators?Mr. <'ox. of New York, claiming
thai refusing to redeem the greenback debt
is repudiation, and that the Radical party
have cither not the skill or the courage to
redeem this debt, and he denounced thi
and every other fo.'in of repudiation. Mr.
Woodward, of Pennsylvania, claimed that
the passage of the legal-tender act was not
only unconstitutional, but it was repudia
tion.
Cuban question.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee
have postponed the Cuban question until
after the holidays.
Paraguayan and ocean cable matters also
go over.
Consular Appointments.
The Senate Committee on Commerce has
requested a li-t of the consular appoint
ments from the State Department. The ob
ject is to discover how appointments are
apportioned among the various States. It
being claimed that New York lias received
nearly the lion's share.

tificial limbs for even* five years, or equiva
lent in inonev, to Union soldiers who failed
to be mustered on account of being wounded
iu battle or captured, cr from other cause j
not growing out of their own fault.

The Foreign Mission*?Salaries to be
Increased.

mission salary will be increased to ?17,000
per annum, and the probability is that this
mission and the missions to England,
France, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, will
all be fixed at ?20,000 per annum.

Within :i generation ploughs have been ao
improved that one horse can now turn no
much as two could.
In Imilriing burns, it is well to remember
that stock need -In Iter more than the crops,
and that hay-forks and threshing-machine?
have rendered the old-fashioned barn liooi
unnecessary.
Add all that is lost by selling too soon,
then add all that i- lost by holding, compare
the .-tuns, and the argument will be tor a
prompt marketing of ail farm products.
It has been ascertained by carefully-re
peated experiments that the lirst drawn
milk contains 5, the second 8, and the
lift.h IT .per cent, of cream. Thus, a cow
three-quarters milked is not half milked if
butter is Ihc object.
Chestnut makes more coal to the) cord
than any common wood, oak a little less,
walnut a little Jess; and so on down through
elm, willow, a-b, and birch, to pine, which
makes only two-thirds as much to the cold
as chestnut.
An Kngli?h farmer thus gives Lis con
densed conclusion* about guano : Powder
it, mix with plaster, apply broadcast; if
used in the hill or drill, mix largely with
loam ; l'i pounds of it are equal to a load of
average barn-vard manure.
