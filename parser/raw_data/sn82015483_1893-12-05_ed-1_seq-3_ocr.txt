OPINIONS ON THE MESSAGE.
It Is Disappointing to a Great many
of tbe Members of Coneress Wbat
Senator Piatt Says of It Ex-Speaker
Reed Is Outspoken In Regard to tbe
Tarts' Tbe New York Sun Sits on It
Wltb Great Porce Ensllab Hem
papers Commend It as an Able and
Porcible Document.
Washington, Dec. 4 The general ten'
timent among members of congress re
specting the president's message la doubt
less one of disappointment, not because of
what is said so mnoh as because of omis
sion to treat in detail many matters in
which the members of the houses are in
ierested. This particularly applies to Ha
wailan affairs. The treatment acoorded
the finanoial queBtlon was also disappoint
ingly general. Nevertheless the message
was generally regarded by democrats as
being an able document and one caloalated
to secure the united support of the party
for tho president; while the republicans
took It sue in soma of the more important
statements and particularly denonnoed his
utterances on the tariff. Mr.Wileon,dem.
of West Virginia, ohalrman of the ways
and means committee, said:
I am especially pleased at wbat be says
on tbe tariff queBtlon.'
Ex-Speaker Keed said: "mat part of the
message which relates to the tariff is most
surprising. It asseverates that the house
committee in charge of that enbject has for
mulated plans and devised methods of tax
ation which, as a member of the commit
tee, I have never heard even proposed. It
is a rather, nnnenal sensation to learn of the
deeds of the oommittee not in the commit
tee but from the president."
"It is bad enough to have a tariff bill
made up by a little coterie, bnt to have it
oommunioated to the president before it
reaches even the committee still less the
house shows a determination to be moved
by no facts and mollified by no argu
ments."
Senator Palmer, dem., Illinois, chairman
of the committee on pensions, said: "I
am inclined to think that the president's
idea concerning frandnlent pensions is
wide of tbe mark. I believe my acquaint
ance with old soldiers and the pension list
of the country is as extensive as that of any
one man, and I am prepared to say that the
number of the fraudulent pensions is ex
ceedingly small and the clamor that has
been raised has very little foundation. 1
do not believe that 2 per oent. of the pen
sions issued are fraudulent."
Senator Aid rich, rep . Bhode Island,
said: "The message is disappointing to
those who hold different views from those
of the administration on the tariff, and
muBt be more so to those who have been
In sympathy with the president's past at
titude on the subject."
Senator tlale or Maine, ealdt VitepnMl-
cans will certainly take issue with the
president on the tariff, bnt those, at least,
from the east will no doubt endorse his
suggestions regarding onr finances."
"Tbe only slgninoant thing about tbe
whole business," said Senator Chandler,
"is that the president endorses the Wilson
raid on protected industries in all its de
tails. We do not know what he has done
in Hawaii. I look npon the attitude of
the administration in connection with
Hawaii as a disgraoeful chapter in the
story of onr relations with other govern
ments."
Senator Piatt, rep., of Connecticut, took
marked exception to that part of tbe mes
sage which asserted that Mr. Blonnt'a re
port had demonstrated "beyond all ques
tion" that tne regular government 01
Hawaii had been subverted by tbe Interfer
ence of United States forces. As to the tariff
part Mr. Piatt remarked that the anthor
wno wrote a dook on -ropuiar ueinsions
ought to add another chapter on the delu
sions of tbe democratic party on the sub
ject of the tariff.
"They seem to think," he said, "that it
is possible to gWe away all our markets
and still retain them to eat our cake and
have It. too. I muat give them credit for
having the sincerity to express their on-
victions."
Boston, Deo. 4. The Herald, ind., says
of the president's message: "Mr. Cleve
land's message is of reasonable length, and
it is conoltely worded, it is clear and
frank in statement, and when we say this
we say wbat is equivalent to declaring it to
be cbaraoteristio of its author.
The message is well written, which is
likely to ensure its reading. It will in
crease the strong confidence in its author."
The Evening Record, rep., says: "As the
case now stands hla annonnoed program
towards the Sandwich Islands leaves to
congress but one dnty, but once before in
voked, and tnat in tne case or Andrew
Johnson. We sincerely hope that an ex
planation will be forthcoming, and that at
once. Congress should watt a reasonable
time for it to come. Then it nrust act.
The president is expressly forbidden by
the constitution from declaring or making
war."
The Post, 'dem., says: "Mr. Cleveland
has produced a message whioh, while as
broadly comprehensive as any stickler for
tradition may demand, is yet interesting
for the reason that some positive and plain
facta are advanced on each or tne many
topics considered. Business has been so
far advanced by tne repeal ot tne suver act
at the extra session and by the preparation
of the new tariff bill during the reoese that
there Is little novelty and no surprise left
for prodnetion in the president's massages.
Its resolutions have mostly been foreseen
and its statements are generally only a re
assurance of what Is already nnderstood if
not specifically declared."
Tbe Ulobe, dem., says there is no mis
taking the president's staunchness to his
convictions. He stands firmly, as always,
for tbe right as he sees It. There is no aid
or comfort in tbe message for faintheart
edness or timidity in tariff legislation.
Party considerations and the welfare of the
mnltitudinons business interests demand
that the line Indicated by Mr. Cleveland's
message shall be carried ont firmly and
faithfully.
The tilobe says that ur. uieveland s ref
erence to tbe Hawaiian situation is brief,
and that comment on this matter and the
president's action thereon may be well de
ferred nntil the promised special message
to congress is forthcoming.
New York, Deo. 5. The Sun says of
the message: Cleveland devotes more space
to what he regards as an excessive pur
ebase of seeds by tbe department of agri
culture than to the momsntus enterprise of
throne-building whioh he has undertaken
in Hawaii. He devotes almost as many
words to the condition of the North Amer
ican tribes as to the tariff, whioh occupied
all of his thoughts in 1887, and which has
become in 1893 an affair not merely of
promises, bnt of performance. For these
reasons the message may fairly be oritloised
as unsatisfactory in its range, if not actu
ally evasive In its intention. w
The personal note sounds as usual
throughout the message.
The Tribune says: "The first snow storm
and the message appropriately came to
gether to warn people that a hard winter
was coming. In its treatment of nearly
alt uomestio questions tne message is creel
itable in character, not more verbose than
is usual for Mr. Cleveland, and in the main
reasonable .in its suggestians. Bnt the
country will judge this message and the
president mainly by the position he has
taken regarding the question which most
vitally affects the industries and earnings
ot American wormngmen."
London, Deo. 5. The Post says of Pres
ident Cleveland's message: "There ia no
indication la it of party exaltation. Mr,
Cleveland leaves his countrymen to draw
the inferences from tbe facts detailed, al
though nearly every paragraph would be
lnetrnotlve reading if printed Id parallel
eolnmna with some of Ur. Harrison's high
sounding orations."
Commenting on the president's message
the Dailey Graphic oomllmenUltr. Cleve
land upon his con tinned firmness and con
sistency. The Times says: The message exhibits
olear and well reasoned views of policy as
well as mnch foroe of oharaoter. The por
tions bearing upon foreign affairs are oon
oeived in a highly creditable spirit and with
an adequate sense of national dignity. The
Times oommends with special warmth the
president's policy towards Hawaii.
The Telegraph says of Ur. Cleveland's
utterances concerning Hawaii: Snob a frank
and honest admission of a mistake and
avowal of the intention to reverse it
reflects the highest possible credit upon
the president, and, Indirectly, upon the
nation.
The Chroniole says: The president will
have the best wishes of every sound eoon
- Jn.1;
are on his side.
The Financial News: It is Impossible
not to be strnok with the earnestness of
Mr. Cleveland's convictions and his broad,
sound etatssmanshiD.
The Standard: From onr point of view,
despite Mr. Cleveland's friendly attitude
toward this country, the new tariff might
almost be pnt down as the work of an
enemy.
THET BOLD PASSES.
Clerks In lb Lake Sbore Road's Osnca
Do a Wbvleaale Fraudulent Raal
neas and Were Caafbt In tbe Act.
Clxviland, Deo. 4. Two clerks in the
office of General Superintendent Cantffe of
the Lake Shore road here have been doing
a large business in selling iree pisses,
forging tbe names of superior ofioers In
discriminate and by wholesale. They
have also forged oiAers on all the local
roads.
The passes were negotiated to scalpers
ty an out-of-town man, formerly clerk
In the same office. This latter party with
his attorney was at Lake Shore beadquar
ten trying to settle the matter Saturday.
The culprits have been watched several
weeks and were caught in tne aot.
The loss to the company will be heavy,
as the forgers have been at work for
months.
NO DILATORY TACTICS.
Tbe Republican members of tbe
Senate Bold Caacns and Discuss
Plans for Action.
Washington, Dec. 4. The republican
members of the senate took the initial
steps this afternoon to perfect organiza
tion for the session and for the campaigns
in the states. The canons was attended
by about ail the republican senators In the
city, and the chairman, Mr. Sherman, was
authorized to appoint a oommittee on order
of business or steering oommittee. This
committee will be made In the course of a
few days, and after matsrlng its plans will
report to a future canens.
There was a great deal of talk at the
caucus on tbe subject of the policy of the
minority. It was the general expression
of opinion that there should be no dilatory
trotios displayed by republicans against
any measure the democrats may bring for
ward. The bill to repeal tne federal elec
tions laws and the new tariff bill were dis
cussed informally.
There was not one voice raised in favor
of pursuing the methods in vogue during
the debate on the silver bill. Republican
leaders declared that they would insist
npon the fullest and fairest debate and
When that had been accomplished the vote
would be taken without hindrance on the
part of the minority. Suoh action will no
doubt be the recommendation of the steer
ing oommittee when it submits its report.
Fine Laboratory Destroyed.
Plattbburqh, N. Y., Deo. 4. The hand
some house of Dr. E. L. Trndeau, manager
of the Adirondack sanitarium at Saranao
lake, together with hie laboratory, one of
the finest in the world, was destroyed by

culated. Dr. Trndean, who is widely
known, is dangerously ill in New York
city.

AINSWORTH SUSTAINED. .
The District Court of Appeals Finds
Tbat the Indictment Was Fatally
Defective.
Wasbih GTOir, Dec. 4. The dlstrlot court
of appeals to-day sustained the demurrer
in the case of Colonel Alnsworth, ohief of
the bureau of pension records of the wsr
department, and three other persons, en
gineers and contractors, lndloted with him
for manslaughter in causing the collapse
of the old Ford's theater building on the
9th of June last, by -whioh twenty-one
clerks lost their lives and a number of oth
ers were Injured. The court held that the
lndiotment was fatally defective because It
did not ehow noon its face facts which
wonld enable the conrt to determine by
legal construction whether there was a
joint dnty created end imposed on all the
defendants alike.
This decision remands the case to ths
ortminal court, whioh will discharge the
defendants. Whether or not the dlstrlot
attorney will attempt to frame another In
dictment seems to be In doubt. It is stated,
however, that suoh is his intention.
