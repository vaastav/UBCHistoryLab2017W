The laying of telegraph wires
underground is now compulsory in
Germany, and tbeohange is hailed
with great satisfaction by tbe peo
ple. No good reason exists why
ths reform should not be oarrled
•nt In this country. The telegraph
companies make a great deal of
mosey, and the expense attending
the change would be a mere baga
telle to them. The Infinitely
greater convenience of tbe new
•ystem ie conceded on all hands.
In the large cities of the United
States wires are multiplying at
such a rapid rate as to threaten
confusion worse confounded. In
Ban Francisco tbey are numerous
and are often so interwoven tbat
the insulators are sometimes cut
through, with the result of setting
Ire to the telephone boxes and In
jury to the operators. The day is
not far distant when tbe public
will demand and the laws enforce
the change.
It must be admitted tbat, thus
far, President Arthur has conduct
ed himself with great skill and
good Judgment. Yet the question
constantly reours, how long can be
keepltup? The stalwarts, with
whioh wing of the party lie affili
ates, are oortain to push tbelr de
mauds upon their old comrade and
he Is quite apt to yield to tljem. A
test ease as to how far tbe Presi
dent Intends to have a mind of bis
own will be afforded by his treat
ment ef Judge Robertson. If tbat
gentleman continues as Col
lector of the Port of New
York during Arthui's term
ble administration will be pitched
In a conciliatory key, the Hon of
atalwartism and tbe lamb of Half
breedism lying down in peace to
gether, at least as far as that re
sult can be brought about by tbe
President. There are already omi
nous bints that Roberteon is about
to resign tbe Colleotorshlp, which
Is a euphemistic way of eaylng
- that he steps down and out to avoid
being kioked out. His displace
ment will be the signal for an out
burst of Half Breed Indignation
which will probably last during
tbe President's term and which
may result in a serious split In the
Republican party.
Or late our most famous million
aires are developing a disposition
to patronise art aod enrich their
houses with the works of men of
genius. Vanderbilt and Leland
Stanford, especially, ore eoiploy
"fog the brushes of the best artists
of France, and much of the best
work of Bouguereau, Odinot and
other famous living masters, is
finding its way to this country,
while tbe galleries of the world
are being ransaoked for autlque
works of art. There is one special
ly commendable feature about tbis
fervor for art, in addition to grati
fying their owners, every fine pic
ture or piece of statuary brought
into the country is a permanent
benefit, helping to form tbe taste
of our people aud giving higher
inspiration and nobler models to
onr artists. Tbey often Und their
way into public galleries as be
quests, and where tbey are still
kept In private bands a disposition
Is growing upon the part of collec
tors to lend their renowned works
of art to assist charitable and re
ligious objects. The late art loan
exhibition In San Francisco dem
onstrated tbe willingness of our
wealthy meu to allow tbe public
to enjoy their art treasures ss well
as showed tbat very extensive and
valuable collections already exist
upon the Pacific Coast.
. These have bees few incidents
In public life bo flagrantly indecent
aa the eoaree vehemence with
which General Grant permits him
ealf to assail Secretary Blame. The
patience of tbe latter gentleman
under these gross assaults is some
thing te marvel at. Ordinarily he
ia tbe most fiery of men, and his
power of invective has been rarely
equaled. Coneldering bow vulner
able Grant Is most people ate sur
prised tbat the Plumed Knight has
not literally burnt him up as a
scroll is consumed over a blaze.
Above all men Blame is the
most oompetent to do this,
and bis failure to bit baok is one
of the most mysterious things of
enrrent politics. Grant, of late,
has been aulte fastidious as to tbe
Otaaraetar ef our public men, and
his standard Is so high now that
one wonders tbat It could ever
have been low enough to Include
snob men aa Laudaulet Williams,
Belknap and a dozen others we
could name. Grant made one mir
aculous escape. Whan brave old
Andrew Johnson, after a gallant
struggle, got himself eleoted to the
United States Ssnate, the whole
couotry turned with expectancy to
the scene that was certain to fol
low. Nobody doubted that Johnson
would prove a good sized thorn in
tbe aide of tbe man wbo bad be
trayed him, but death came to the
resoue of the sull»n smoker of tbe
White House. He Is making an
equally happy esoape In Blame's
unacceuntable silence. It is just
possible that the Maine statesman
considers it inconsistent with tbe
dignity of tbe official position he
holds to engage In violent contro
versies, and that be is saving him
self up till be becomes a private
oitlzen, which will be lv a few
days. If so, General Grant's purga
torial experience is merely post
poned, not remitted.
The election of yesterday is a
straw tbat shows whioh way tbe
polltioal wind blows in this sec
tion. The Democrats made no
special efforts to win. On the con
trary, we have never seen a time
when so little of the "machine"
was visible at tbe polls. The result
Is largely traceable to a circum
stance which ought not to pass un
observed, viz., the action of oar
fellow citizens of German birth, a
large preponderance of whom have
hitherto been Bspublican In poli
tics. In local matters the Repub
oans can no longer depend upon
the allegiance of tbe Germans, wbo
see with disgust adlsposition upon
the part of tbe Republicans to re
sort to Sunday and sumptuary
laws. Thsy know that whenever
this party gets tbe power they will
exercise it in tbat direction, and
however muoh a certain element
efthe Republican party may de
sir* to control their neighbors the
Germans are determined not to aid
in welding their own fetters. Tbis
determination of tbeir* has reduced
the Republican majority in Wis
consin to next to nothing, it often
Insures euoh strong Republican
cities as Cincinnati and Chicago to
tbe Democrats, and it will hereaf
ter bave a marked influence In the
politics of both I.om Angeles city
ami county. Tbe existence of
slavery had much to do with mak
ing the Germuns Republicans.
Tbat Issue having beeu disposed of
lOBg ago, aud a strong imperialist
tendency having been developed
In the Republican party in the per
sons of the advocates of a third
term, the Germans are likely to
vote hereafter according to their
personal predilections. It would
not surprise a closs observer If the
Republican party were to Buffer
heavily through the defection of
this Important element of their
strength both in the country at
large, in California and in the
county of Los Augeles. Self-preaer
vatien is the first law of nature
with our German fellow-citizens
as with other people; and, as they
are very mucb attached to th* tra
ditional German ideas of a cheer
ful and uuobetructed Suuda.v and
free lager, tbey are apt to vote as
tbey teal. While, of course, this
whole matter admits of much dis
cussion on both sides, the practical
man takes oognizance of faots and
acts aouerdingly.

organized discountenancing po
lygamy and blood atonement. The
Quarterly Htvltw, a Mormon mag
asl'.e, in Us last Issue, oalls for a
dissolution of tbe partnership be
tween Churob and State, and tbe
formation of an anti-Tabernacle
party. The President's message
Inspires some hope among the
Gentiles, though many fear it will
all end in smoke as before. Tbe
time was never riper for crushing
out polygamy than now.

Washington, Dec. 6.—On tiie
opening of Congress tbe Presi.
dent's message was read. Tbe
message, after deploring tbe as
sßßSlnatien of Garfield, congratu
lates the country on its prosperous
and peaceful condition. Diplo
matic relations with various for
eign powers are mentioned In de
tail, and suggestions offered for
the guidance of Congress In tak
ing such action as will tend to pro
mote tbe international interests
and strengthen existing bonds of
amity and good will. It deplores
the lawlessness wbiob pre
vails along tbe Mexioan bor
der* and suggests Congress
ional intervention to sup
press tbe same. It congratulates
tbe country on the peaceable rela
tions between tbe United States
and tbe Sooth American States,
and suggests that tbe rights and
interests of American Government
be carefully guarded in tbe settle
ment by arbitration of the disput
ed question between Costa Rica
and Columbia. It congratulates
tbe Government on tbe fact tbat
tbe resent treaty with China has
been duly ratified on both sides,
The friendly spirit evinced by the
Chinese Government In conoediug
modifications should secure a care
ful regard for the interests and sus*
ceptlbilities of that peoplo in tbe
enactment laws regarding in,mi
gration.
While our relations with tbe
Hawaiian kingdom are very friend
ly, this government views with
concern the efforts being made to
replenish tbe rapidly diminishing
population from outward souroes
which threatens to Impair their
native sovereignty aud independ
ence. It commends efforts being
made both by the American and
Chinese governments to put a stop
to tbe demoralizing and destruct
ive opium traffic; also suggests
some desirable changes in the pres
ent system of consular jurisdiction
between this government aud
those of China and Japan. It re
grets that commercial interests be
tween tbe United States and Bra
zil, from which great advantages
are hoped, have suffered from the
withdrawal of American lines of
communication between Brazilian
ports anil our own. It suggests
tbat tbe diplomatic representa
tives be restored, even on a re
duced scale at Athens, Greece and
Quito Equador. It suggests tbe
propriety of Congress adopting a
new code of ioternatiol rules for
tbe prevention of collisions of ves
sels on tbe high seas, and men
tions ths purpose of tbo Emperor
of Japan to establish a constitu
tional government, aod parliamen
tary Congress, as a. remarkable
step toward a complete assimila
tion with the Western system, and
cannot fall to bring Japan into
closer aud more beneliclul rela
tionship with the United States.
The President concurs in tbe rec
ommendations of tbe Secretary of
the Treasury tbat the provision for
the coinage of a fixed amount of
■iiver for each year be repealed
and hereafter only bo much be
coined as shall be necessary to
supply the demand; tbat the issue
of gold certificates should not
for the present be resumed,
and that the National Bankß
may properly be fotbiddeu by law
to retire their currenoy, except
upon reasonable notloe of their in
tention to do so. The ordinary re
sources of the government from all
sources for the year ending June
SOtb, 1681, are, customs, $19,816,
--967,602; Internal revenue, $13,626,
--438,661; sale of public lands, $222,
186,847; taxes ou circulation and
of National Banus, $8,116,11872;
repayment of interest by Pacific
railroad companies, $810,833.80;
sinking fund of Pacific railroad
companies, $806,180.54; oustom
fees, fines end penalties, $1,226,
--614.86; fees consular, letters patent
and lands, $2,244,984.99; total or
dinary expenditures of tbe govern
ment, $260,712,687.59; leaving a
surplus revenue or $100,089,404.98.
Tbe President concurs in tbe Sec
retary's views iv recommending
the abolition of all the internal
revenue rates except on tobacco,
and distilled liquors, and excepts
special tax upon manufacturers
and dealers iv these articles. He
believes In the propriety and jus
tics of repealing tbe law by which
banks and bankers ure assessed on
their oapltal and deposits. He
commends a general revision of
the revenue law and concurs in the
recommendation of the Secretary
of War to increase the army to 80,
--000 enlisted men. He recommends
legislation to prevent intrusion
upon lands sot apart for Indians.
Hs reoommends increased strength
of fortifications and coast defenoes;
alao augmenting the efficiency of
the navy to place It on a footing
commensurate with the necessities
of ths government. He urges
the vigorous prosecution of
all persons found chargeable
of fraud upon postal service und
promises bearty co-operation iv
ady lawful measures to suppress
polygamy. He strongly endorses
tbe public school system and advo
oates popular education, recom
mending liberal legislation on
those subjects. Referring to tbe
cowboy nuisance and their Incur
sions Into Mexican territory, he
oonfesses the subjsot an embarrass
ing one, owing to the lack of juris
diction of the general government,
unless a territory applies for United
States protection. He thinks tbat
sucb acts are likely to embroil us
with a friendly oountry and might
perhaps be considered as an offense
against the United States. He also
tblnkstbat the army might be
used as a posse commutatus to as
sist tbe territorial authorities
without any practical Infringe
ment of the rsoent law forbidding
II to be sealed.
The questions growing out of tbe
Panama oanal are of grave national
importance. Colombia haa pro
posed tbat the European Powers
should join In tbe guarantee of tbe
neutrality of the oanal. Tbls
weald oontravene our obligations
as sole guarauteer of the Integrity
of tbe Colombian territory. Fore
seeing a probable rellanoe In Eng.
land Id tbe provisions of the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty, tbe President
has proposed to the British govern
ment a modification of the treaty
and an abrogation of suoh clauses
as do net oonform with the oblige
tions of tbo TJulted States toward
Colombia. Be reviewed the In
dian problem at muoh length and
reoommends tbe passage of an aot
making the laws of tbe various
States and Territories applicable to
the Indian reservation within
their jurisdiction.

WE DO NOT TREAT OUR CUSTOMERS A 8 IF THEY
were fishes, monkeys or wild animals. We do not trap our
oustomers, as the grabbers do, by giving baits. We do net
offer 25 yards of damaged oalloo for $1, and then charge $6 OOfor a $8.00
shawl. But we give full value for your money, and every article you
buy at the PEOPLE'S STORE yon get your moneys worth for every
cent's worth you buy.
We would say: Come to our store, prioe an artiole, then go to tbe
grabbers and price tbe same artiole and you will find tbis difference: At
our establishment you will find the prioe plainly marked on tbe arti
cle; at the grabbers you will find that doable or treble is asked, and If
you hesitate the grabber will commence to fall from tbe prioe, and If
this will not do be will ask you how muoh yon are willing to give, and
if be receives no bid will whine and offer the artiole at a loss. Poor
fellow! You are tempted to pity him and purchase. But, haying re
ceived the true prioe from tbe People's Store, you oan see through hie
little game and wonder how a man can look so straightforward and
humble and be suoh a great liar. You may turn away with a elgb or
relief and return to the People's Store and buy the artiole.
Another view Is this: Suppose you had been robbed and swindled
by this whining grabber, and after Aniline this out, you return the ar
tiole and demand your money. Tben thie humble grabber beoomrs
as hold as a lion. "Can't take It baok. Sold Is sold." Hepayerent;
be pays gas; be pays taxes, and he don't pay money baok. No, sir;
not he!
See tbe differenae: If you return an artiole to the People's Store we
cheerfully exobange it, and |f nothing is fonnd to suit, we return the
money without delay.
We place the poorest judge of goods on the same level as tbe sharp
est and closest buyer.' We do not ask you what you will pay. We tell
you our price, and we never come down from tbe prioe—not even one
penny.
" sT XT fS T I O 153 ! "
Is our motto, and we give you
Full Value for Your Money.
You oannot do better, but stand many ohanoes of doing won* else
where.
