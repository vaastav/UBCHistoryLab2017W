New Jersey's Republican pluiality 1b
23,918, against 8to5 in 1S9S, an example
or the expansive influence of expansion.
Our first duly a d plodgo'.in Cuba Is to
give the island a stable government. And
Uncle Sam a. ways lives up to his agi ce
ments. Tub question in Kentucky is whethar
tho state is to be run by a majority cf
voters or by a conspirator armed with a
trick election law contrived by himself.
Great activity in gold production con
tinues. Official reports indicate that the
1899 production of the yellow metal in
Australasia will be at least fl7,000,0J0
greater than that of last year.
The year 1SP9 will go down as a record
one In industrial history, especially as re
lates to substantial and widespread ad
vances in wages, and a general increase
and activity in employment.
Tha i the beef trust is not getting tho
whole thing is Bbown by the statement
appearing in Bradstreet's iast weok, that
"Three-year-old Texas shorthorn cattle
sold for fti.75 at Chicago stock-yaads
Monday, which is tho highest price paid
for Texas cattle since 1ST.2."
Of the nineteen Vice Presidents of the
Anti-Imperialist League elected in Bos
ton fifteen are prominent Democrats or
Mugwumps and almost the entire num
ber opposed the war with Spain. They
have a chronic habit of turning up
against the government on every public
question.
The gavel with which Speaker llen
dersou called the Fifty-sixth Congress to
order is made ot wood from the Spanish
cruiser Koitia Christina, captured by
Admiral Dewey at Manila. It is artis
tically carved, heavily niouuted in gold
and was presented to Speaker Henderson
by the Governor of Iowa.
J. I. V. Gridley, of Erie, Fa., son of
the late Captain Charles Gridley, who
commanded Admiral Dewey's flagship,
Olympia, in the battle of Manila has
been designated for appointment as a
lieutenant in the Marine corps. His ex
amination expenses have been borne
jointly by President McKinlev and Ad
miral George Dewey.
Every American citizen who has read
anythi ng on the subject of the Alaskau
boundry dispute believes that the United
States should hold onto every foot of
ground to which she is entitled. There
is not a dissenting voice to this propo
sition. And yet some years ago there
were a lot of people in the country who
opposed and (ought the Alaska purchase
and necused tho Government of Idiocy, if
not criminality, on account of it. The
caso has a strong parallel at the present
time.
Another ten per cent, advance in
wages of tue New Etigland mill ope'a
tives is announced. Notices of an advance
of ten per cent, in the wages of the Bor
den Iron Mills, to take effect December
wore posted on Thanksgiving morning,
and those lauiiliar with the s.tuation in
manufacturing circles of New Eng and
say that this advance by the Borden
mills, in which nearly 3,000 persons are
employed, will result in a similar ad
vanio in establishments employing fully
100,010 persons.
The President's message was delayed
one day in its transmission to Congress,
on account of the adjournment of the
S'-nate immediately after its organization
out or resect to the memory of the late
Vice President Hobart, hence we are un
able to lay this importaut and highly in
teresting document before our readers to
day. Wo hope to be ablo t do so next
week, however. Everybody is anxious
to see what the President has to say on
the momentous questions now before the
American people.
A.N evidence of tho increasing interest
which the United States has a right to
feel in the Pacific is found in the fact that
practically one-half of our enormous su
gar imports oi the present year came
from the Pacific, including Hawaii, the
Fhilippnus, and tho East Indies, whil
nearly one-half of the remainder cam
from Cuba and Porto Rico. From the
Philippine Islunds the amount for the ten
months ending with October is over 50,
000,000 pounds; from the Hawaiian
Islands, 531,000,000 pounds; from the
East Indies, over 1,000,000,000 pounds
and from Cuba 683,000,000 pounds.
"The time has passed for tho people
of tho United States to discuss tho ques
tion of what is to be done with the Philp
pines. We droye out the Spaniards who
had been the governing power nearly 400
years. For us to withdraw would leave
a condition of anarchy, and foreigners
wu own property in the country would
have certainly a strong moral claim
against the United States for their losses.
Americans will findthisan excellent field
for their energies and the wealth-produc
ing powers of these islands under Ameri
can iniluen"e will be great." Letter from
General Joe Wheeler in thj Philippines,
Two Committees of Pennsylvania Re
publicans have been appointed to foster
the project of holding the next National
convention in Philadelphia, at which
city in 18."6 the first National Convention
ol the Republican party was held,
and at which, in 1872, was held
tho last convention at which a Republi
can President was renominated who was
reelected to that office. It has been
brought to the notice of the members of
the Republican National Committee
which meets In Washington two weeks
hence to fix the timo and place for the
1!HK) convention, that Philadelphia has in
the buildincs of the Export Exhibition a
place suitable for the convention. If nec
essary, an auditorium accommodating
20,000 peopla could lie constructed under
the roof of the Exhibition main building.
It is pointed out that New York, Boston,
Baltimore and Pittsbnrg have not asked
fer the convention ; that Cincinnati and
Cleveland are politically unavailable, and
that Philadelphia will be the only large
Eastern city in the field".

nieuts. Major Powell's Report
Thereon.
The Wat D-partinert has made public
ttie results of the survey by Major Chas,
Q. Powell of the Allegheny river for the
extension of the slaokwator navigation.
Summed up his report shows that the
river is well worth the improvement
that it would make the entire valley one
chain of manufacturing towns from Oil
City to Pittsburg, and be the source of
fabulous wealth to Pennsylvania. Tho
annual haul is placed at 024,000 tons, and
the project contemplates 54 dims and
locks, to cost 113,705,000. The following
are exti acts of the report from a special
to the Pittsburg Dispatch :
The river was surveyed from Oil City,
Pa,, 134.7 miles above tho river mouth, to
Tarontura, under tne direction of Major
R. E. Hoxie, corps of engineers, or Ma
jor Charles F. Powell during the late
falls, when low water generally obtains,
in 1896 and 1S07.
The present navigation of tho river is
confined to favorable stages, which iu tho
aggregate do not occur moro than four or
live months in a year. Years ago pack
ets ran to Warren, !2 miles above Pitts
burg. Iu later yoars steamboats have
not attempted to go above Oil City and In
tho lost year a single beat only in ado a
lew trips from Pittsburg as far up as
Kittanning.
Portions of the Allegheny valley, not
ably on the CUrion river, below French
creek, and on the Tiouesta river aud
Hickory creeks, above Oil City, still
abound in timber. Parts of the cut and
barges aud coal bottoms built for the
Pittsburg river coal trade and loaded
with lumber, mine timbers, or tan bark
are rafted dowu tho river on raises. This
tralllo foots up aoout 200,000 tons yearly,
and comprises about all there remains
to-day of river business above the reach
of Pittsburg harbor business.
As.to the practicability of extending
the slack -water improvement on the Al
legheny river in Pennsylvania It is found
that the river is of ample width and
volume for the purpose. The Allegheny
forms the Ohio river, and is a larger
stream than the tributary Mouongahola
and Kanawha rivers, where slack-water
improvements are successfully operated.
iheba ks and the bed of the rtycr are
reasonably firm, making its course stable,
especially below Oil City, and a (lording
foundation for structures, although not
rock. A filling of pools is not to be ex
pe ted from the very moderate amount
of sedimeat carried by the river. An oh
juotiou to fixed dams is the destructive
action of frequent heavy ice gorges. The
very cold winters, rapid current and
shoal bars combine for forming the ice
gorges, but it is probable that the in
oreased depth produced by dams would
reduce the extent of the gorges.
A drawback which has been urged
against fixed dams is their interference
with rafting. Tho dams would give some
compensation for the disadvantage to
that interest by affording a mote reliable
depth of water than during the short
lived freshets, the opportunity of moving
rafts at any time during opon river, and
cheaper tying-up places in the pools
while awaiting sale than at Pittsburg
harbor.
The useful natural products along the
river, except coal, lies upstream from
Kittanning
In answer to circular letters Major Pow.
ell learned the following annual amounts
of named coinodities, exclusive of pres
ent rafting, would be accommodated uy a
slack-water improvement:

only originally opposed expansion, but
that he said to President McKinley.when

The extension of slack-water from
Monteray to Oil City, or French Creek
is not now deemed worthy. The further
extension from Oil City to the Pennsyl
vania State line, requiring 35 locks and
dams at an estimated cost of $7,980,115, is
also deemed unworthy and not justified
by the interests of commerce.
It is understood that persons who in
stigated the requirement for the survey
bad in view a canal connection from the
improved river to Lake Erie. To see
what this proposition amounted to three
possiblo canal routes were considered
and the route via French Cieek and Con
neaut Lake selected as tho most feasible
ono. This route is wholly in Pennsylva
nia. The canal would ascend French
creek uy dams for 19 miles from its
mouth, then parallel Conneaut Lakecreek
for six miles to the summit level, with
lockage of 111 feet; thence along the sum
mit lor 17 miles, including 2.5 nines
through Conn- aut Lake, and thence de
scend 503 feet for 10 miles to the mouth of
Elkcreek ; if the canal were extended to
Eriel3 miles would be added to its longth
the elevation of the summit level would
bo 1,07C feet above mean tide.
A sufficient water supply for a canal
giving eight feet depth in the locks, the
same as the projected enlargement of the
Erie canal, appears to be available by
means of a dam above Meadville on
French creek, and a nine mile feeder
from there to the canal. The total dis
tance ol such water route from Pittsburg
to Elk creek would be 186.5 miles, and
and the total lockage 870 feet ; these ele
ments aHd some commercial features
the canal route do not compare favorably
with the saino pertaining to the well
known route for a Lake Erie (anal from
the Ohio river, niar Pittsburg, via the
Beaver and Mahoning rivers. So that -it
may be remarked, only if the State
Pennsylvania build the French creek ca
nal, would the extension by the United
States of Allegheny river slack-water
from Monterey to French creek, 44 miles,
and preferable in that caso to Oil City,
eight miles further be justified.
