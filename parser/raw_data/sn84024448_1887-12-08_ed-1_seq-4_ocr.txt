or to the farmer from protection for his

Unit llio yellow dogs do more to curtail
the growth of wool Iu this country than a

to sco nml, nolens he is prejudieud, can tail

tho Slates that has made, our iuter-State
comineieu the uiurvel of tho world for its
t-noimmjii bulk and frroftthof proiortlous

Ntieh iimiiciihiliiu in every depurtment as
to leavo cnjiilnl or laUir but little oppor
tunity forsn attempt at the recovery of our
mui'h dt'plrteil Inter-national trade. If tho
a
nutiona of the earth stood tu each other, as
our States do one lo the other, so far us
trade Is concerned, thero ran be no doubt
that the sum of human happiness nnd
content would Ihj greatly im rean.-d, nnd
raco would le soured. Mnni'olti, the
granping few to whom government are
merely oriraiiiAiitions (or svlflah pur-hw-s,
a means to their ends, would
bo discontented. Tlw sum of their haj pi
ne ia fouud only In complete monooly
of some bmiK-li of iudiiatry that makes the

Why should we not come as near
lo manufacluiing nil our cotton ss wo
do to msnufocl tiring all tho Iron that
wo mine? And why should we net mnn
ufiicttno It all when, ns the Tmn
UdU it, our manufacturer ran nun
pete with Pnittand in her own cill nnd
undersell them lii HH'lid lines? If we en
Joyed as luryo a measure of frvo trade
ss i ennsistent wilh our necesxiii,
In revenue; If our revenue ss
tin hud not Ixvn ererted to
tho purposes of liiiooiihtltiitlonal subsidy,
we should today bo a hiinilrcd times more
of a competitor of Knand In rotlon man
ufacturrd goods, con trolling aa we Uo tho
best of the staple) nnd by far tho largest
crop raised in tho world. The cotton man
ufactories of the country have not grown
as fust as they uiiht, could or
should. They should at leant
havo kept a closer p.ico with
tho general projreM of tho
country. What would havo become of
England hud she exported her iron und
coul to another country, and then by her
necessities of growth In population havo
become Iho I fat customer for tho muiiu
Lii lured iron products of that country?
That is the position of tho United
Hiatus toward England iu regard
to cotton, lint coming nearer homo
and taking a mora restricted
ill UHtnition what is it that makes Chatta
nooga so desirablo a place for Iron manu
factures but Lor nearness to Iron and coal.
It is that ii'lvantnyre of position in tho cen
ter of great fields of iron and coul that will
give tliut city and Iliiminliaui and Annis
ton tho greatest advsulage when free trade
in iron shall havo oHtied tho w hole world
in competition to her manufacturers and
coal miners.
Tits New York Tritmne't reviewer says
nf Zola's latoht work, "La Terro," that it
is "un infamous Wik," tho "climax of
naturalism." The author propose to do
pii't the condition of the French peasantry,
but really ho depicts their exceptional
vices. "Tho French peasant is given to
filthy langunge; therefore M. Zola uiakos
him talk nothing else. Ho Is course and
gross In bis habits; thereforo M. Zola
makes hiin do nothing which Is not coarse
and gross. He is absorbed In the pawiou
of land-owning; thereforo M. Kola makes
him commit every crimo iu the calendar ut
the prompting of his rapacity. Ho is apt
to Ik- Immoral in nn rtnimal way; there
foro M. Kola makes him a salacious Wu.it.
Conceive, If jMisnible, a commuikity every
ini'inWof which i as completo nn Incur
nation of evil as the Mr. Hyde of Steven-
sou's story, und you havo M. Zola's jiict
tiro of a French village of somo 000 souls.
That we nuiy not Imj supei ted of ex.ij.ijer
ntit.n, we will stute the crime whiih
arc represented as being committed
(and every one unjniiiished) by
this dialsilieal commune. Tho list
include theft, arson, ndullery,
miH', Incest, mur-ler, mstricide, parricide
and snrorit'ide. Add to this general Infl-tli'lil-,
a worse thsnbrutish selibihnet and
Itiliuinsnily, an atmosphero of lewd and
ribald talk seasoned with perpetual calum
ny, backbiting and malice, and the gen
eral tone of tho wotk may 1 apprehended
quite as closely as is either needful or
edifying." And vet, wrhaps, despito this
just criticism, Zola will bo sought for and
re .id, and for the reason that be is natural
and serves up tho wuims of tho gutter
wreaking In sll their filth snd naMinr.

KLALNE ON TIIE MESSAGE.
INTEBVIEW WITH TUB PLUMBED
KNIGHT IN PABI3.
A Confflomeratlon of tbe Weakest State
ments, Not Arguments, Ever Ex
pressed by tbe Tattooed Statesman
He Say Tobacco la a Neoesslty.
Xkw Yomc, Dec. 7. Tlio Tribuno of to
morrow will contain a long interview with
tho Hon. JamosG. Illaino on President
Cleveland's message. It was taken in short
bund, under tho direction of the Tribune's
Puris correHpoiident, and sent by cable to
night. It is as follows:
"I have been reading an abstract of tbe
President's message, nnd havo been espe
cially interested iu tho comments of tho
London papers. Those papers all assumo
to declare the message is a free trade man
ifesto,' and evidently are anticipating an
enlarged market for English fabrics in tho
United States as a consequence of tho
President's reeomniondutions. Perhaps
that tact slumped the churaclcrof the mes
sage mora clearly than any words of mi no
din.
"You don't mean actual freo trade with
out duty?" ancried the reporter.
"No, replied Mr. ltlainu. "Nor do tho
Imdon papers mean that. Thoy simply
mean that the l'resnlent tins reconiineiiuei
what in the United States is known as
revenue tariff, reioctinsr the protective
feature as an object, and not even i?rmit
ting protoction to result freely as an inci
dent to rovemio dulit)."
"I don't know that I quite comprehend
that lust point," said the reporter.
"I mean," said Mr. lllalne, "that foi the
first timo in the history of the United
Slules the President recommends retain
ing the internal tax in order that tho tariff
muy be lorceU down even below tho lair
revenue standard. Ho recommends that
the tax on tobacco bo retained, and thus
that manviiiillioiisunnuallvshiill be levied
on a domestic product which would far
better come Ironi a taiitl on foreign
fubries."
"Then do you mean to Imply that you
would favor the repeal of llio tobacco
tax?"
"Certainly; I mean lust that." said Mr,
P.luine. "1 should urge thiit it be donn at
one, even lefore tho Christinas holidays.
It would, in tho lirst place, bring great re
lief to the growers nf tobacco ail over the
country, and would materially lessen the
price of tho article to consumers. Tobacco
to millions of men is a necessity. Tho
President calls ii a luxury, but it is a lux
ury iu uo other sense than tea and col Ice
sro luxuries. It is well to rcmcmlcr that
the luxury uf yestenhiT becomi-s a noees-
nit v of today. Watch, if votl nlen.se. the
number of men ut work on the larm, in
Iho coal mine, along the railroad, in tho
iron foundry, or iu any calling, and you
will find niuety-fivo to 100 chewing while
they work. After each meal the same
proportion seek tlio solace of a pipe or
u cigar. These men not only pay the
millions of the tobacco tax, but pay on
every plug and every cigar an enhanced
price, which the tax enable the manufact
urer and retailer - to impose. Tho only
excusu for such a tax ia tho actual neces
sity under which the government found
itself during the war and the years iuiiite
iliately following. To retain tho tux now
in onlcr to destroy tho protection which
would incidentally liow from raising tho
same amount of money on foreign itiisrls
is certainly a uns.t extraordinary indicy for
our government."
"Well, then. Mr. Plain, would vou ad
vis the reieal of the whisky tax?"
"No, I would not. Other considerations
than those (jf linsncial administration are
to Is? taken into account with regard to
w hisky. Thero is a moral side to it. To
rheajs-n the prico of w hisky is to iuvreane
the consumption enormously. There
would be no sense in urging 'the n-lonn
wrought by high license iu many SluUw
if tho national government neutralise the
K'ssd effect by making w hisky wflhin reach
oi vvvrvoue ut JO ivuts a gallon. Whisky
would bo every w hero distilled it the sur
veillance of thu government wcru with
drawn by tho remission of tho tux, and
illicit Miles could not then lo prevented
even by a olicy as rigorous and searching
as that with which Uussia pursues the
nihilist. It would denlruy high license
at once In ull the Mutes.
"Whisky has done a vast deal of harm
in Iho I Ulted Males. 1 would try to make
it tlosume gtsNl. 1 would use the tax to
fortify our cities on tho seuhourd. In view
of the powerful letter addressed to the
Ib iiuN'iwtie party on tho suhjwt nf forti li
ra Uoii by tho laio Samuel J. Tilden, in
1 am amused that no attention has
bevil paid lo the subject by the IVmisnitic
administration. Never Is fore in the his
tory of the world has any government al
lowed gn-ut cities on iho scshourd, like
PhiUdclphis, New York, lUa-ton, I'silli
more, New (hlenus and Sail 1 rsnclsco, to
remuiu di feii.hws,"
"Hut," said the reorlr, "yon don't
think we sro to have a warin 'uny direc
tionr' "tVrtainly not," said Mr. F.Iain.
"Neither, 1 presume, did Mr. Tilden wkeii
bo wrote bis reniaikiil.le letter. Hut wo
should change a nuimte chance into sn ab
soliite iinsiMTibility If our weak and ex
Mawd points were slnnigly fortiliiil. If to
day we bud by any chain even such a
wur ss we bad with Mexico, our enemy
could pns-ur immia.rs in Kunip that
would meiisco our gn-ut cities with de
strmiion or lay thrin under rontnlititioti."
"Hut would' not our fortifying now look
a If we ex ted wsr'''
"Why should it any moro than tho
fortillt ali-ui made seventy or eighty years
ago by our gni ml lat hers when they guard
M theiiiM'iyisi against siietsstsfnl allsck
from tlio armaments ol that tlsr. We
don't uece-artly xhvI a burglar ls-canso
wu lis k our tlisirs at night, but if by any
ssiliiliy a burglar comes it ronlributiw
vastly to our iicaec of mind and our bound
alerp lo f.vl liiat lie cstl't get ill."
"IlulaiU r the foilitlcMliiius should Ik)
roimirtii isl would you still uiaintain Iho
tux on w hiskv?"
"Yes," said Mr. Illaino. "So long as
there Is whisky lo lux I would tax it, snd
when the national government should
have no use lor the money 1 would divide
the lax among the Federal I'uion with
the niecilic olips. I of lightening the lux oil

ngo "
Afti ra few moments' silein-, Mr. Illaino
sdd.sl Hint, in bis Judgment, tho whisky
lax should Ih si lieslille.l sa to s rmll all
who iim' ptiii' ak-oliol in the aits or In uie
clianical piu-sults lo have II free of lax. In
ull sot h esse the tax could Is? omitted
without il inner of fraud, just us uow tho
tsx on pir:is exHirted is remitted.
"J'.t-id your general aud sweeping
opposition to tho President's recommenda
tion, - have you any further specific objection?"
xes, answered air. ui.iine, "i snouia
seriously ohWX to tho repeal of the duty
on wool. Tlio repeal that would work
great injustice to mnny interests and
would seriously discourage what we slmma
earnestly encourage, namely, tho sheep
culture among farmers throughout tho
Union. To bn'ak.down wool wowing and
bo dependent on foreign countries for tho
blanket under which wo sleep, anil the
coat that covers our barks, is not a wise
policy for tho national government to en
foreo." "l)o you think if tho President's recom
mendation were adopted H would Increase
our export trade?"
"Possibly in somo few articles of peculiar
construction, but it would Increase other
import trade ten (old as much in the great
staple fabrics, in woolen and cotton good,
in Iron, in steel, in all the thousand nnd
one shapes itt which they arci wrought.
How are we to export staple fabrics to the
markets of Europe, and bow aro we to
intinutucturo Uieiu cheaper than they do
in Europe, unless wo get che.iper labor
than thev have iu Eurnnc?"
"Then you think that the question of
labor underlies tho whole subject:
"Of course it does," replied Mr. Waine
"It is. in fact, the cntireciuestion. When
ever wo can forco carpenters, masons, iron
workers and mechanics in every depart
ment to work as cheaply and live ns poorly
in tho United States as similur workmen
in Europe, wo can, of course, manufacture
Inst as cheaply as thoy do in England and
'rnnco. Hut 1 am totally opposed to a
policy that would entail such results. To
attempt it is equivalent to a social nnd
flnonciul revolution, nnd Hint would bring
untold distress."
"Yes, but might not tho great farming
class lie benefited by importing articles
from Euro9 instead of buying thorn al
higher prices at bonier'
"Tho moment," answered Mr. Plaine,
"you begin, to import fredy from Europe
vou drive vour owu workmen from me
chanical and manufacturing pursuits. In
the sumo proportion they Wronio tillers of
the soil, increasing steadily the agricult
ural product and decreasing steadily tko
large homo demand, w hich is constantly
enlarging as home manufacturer enlarge.
That, of course, works great injury to the
farmer, glutting the market with his prod
ucts and tending constantly to lower
prices."
"Yes, but the forei;ru demand for farm
products would bo increased in like ratio,
would it not.'"
"Even supose it were," said Mr. Hlaine;
"now, do yuu know the source from which
it will bo supplied? Tho tendency in Rus
sia today and in Iho Asiatic possessions of
t.ngland is toward a largo increase ot mo
grain supply, the grain being, raised by tho
cheapest pobsiblj lalsjr. Manufaiiur-
iuir countries will buy their bread
stuff whero they can .et them
cheapest, aud tho enlarging of the
home market for tho American farmer
being checked, ho would search in vain
for ono of tho same value. His foreign
sales nro already checked by the gn-ut com
petition abroad. Thero never was a tunc
when the Increase of a largo home market
was so valuable to him. Tho liet proof is
that the tanners aro prosperous in propor
tion to the nuuriiess of mauuf-utnr
ing centers, and a protective turiT
tends to spread uianufactun-. In
Ohio !and Indiana, for example, thoivili
not classed as manufacturing Mates, the
annual value of fubries is larger than the
annual value of agricultural products.
"Hut those holding tbe President'
views." remarked the reiortcr, "nro al-
wuys quoting tho great pros rity of tie
country under the tariff of l.Mi."
"That tariff did uot invol'.e the distinct-
ivo jsjiut recommended bv the President,
namely: tho retaining of dinst internal
taxes in onler to nlsiliah indirect taxes
levied on foreign fabric. Hut the country
had pcculisr advantages nnder it bv th
fjriuie.m war involving t.iigland, hrsnce
and Itussis, nnd largwy iiupsiring their
trade; these luce tents, or aeridontrt, were
immensely stimulating to trade in the
United State, regunliess of the nature
of our tariff, liut mark Ihueml of this
European extMnieiu-e wilh the tariff of
ism, which for a time gave an illusory aud
deceptive show of prosperity. Its ennct
ineut was biuncdiutely followed by the
Mexican wsr, then, ia 1AIK, by tho great
convulsions oi J.urop; then, in ispj ami
succeeding years, by iho enormous gold
yield in t ttlifoniiu. Th powers made
Huee in 1K.V1, and at the same time tho
output ot gold in luliloniwi a n on. Im
mtxuuU'ly the Cmincial panic, of 1h,'7
caine uikjo - the couutry with dif
truu fore. Though we had in these
veara mirlod a vast amount of mild In
California every bank in 2ivw Y'ork was
romm-llcd to suspend sisrrio payment.
Four hunda-d mlllafiis in gold bad been
caiTted out of tho country in eight years to
pay lor lorrign jr-ssis that should have
Is-en uiantif.Kiliin d at home, sud we had
years of depn-ssion und dislreMea a an
stoticiuent lor our lolly, it is remarkable
that Pn-sident Polk recommended the
tariff of 1811 un pn-ciwdy the same ground
that Pn-sident Clcvcluiid recommend a
similur enactment now, iiiimclv: the sur
plus in tli tn-iistiry was menacing the
nwHTily of the country. History is re
peating iiself.
"r.y me wsy. sir. niaine aii.iiM, alter
a moment's n-lfivtion, "it is worth notice
that Mr. Polk insistitl on emptying the
tnustiry by a (re trade tariff, then Imme
diately rushed th country into debt by
UimiwingH'iO.'iU'.'K'iiforiho Mexican wsr.
I trust nothing muy occur lo rc?iit so dis
astrous a seoui'l to th policy recommend
ed by President Cleveland, i'.ut tbe uni
form (ale has Iss n for llfty yrsra past that
tho 1 Vims-ratio party, wdien it gia- out of
power, always leave ah empty treasury,
ami when it return to power alw ays lim la
a full treasury."
"Then do you mean lo Imply that there
should Iwt no reduction of tiie national
revenue?"
"No, what I have said Implies the re
verse). I would reduce it bv a prompt re-
IH-sl of tho tobacco tax, and would make
icre and there iuhiiu eiiungsi ia the tariff,
not to reduce protection, but wisely foster
It."
"Would you explain your meaning
fully?"
"1 mean,'' said Mr. P-lsiue, "that no
gn-ut system of revenue like our tariff run
oM-rsto with clhYlcncy snd equity uulew
the cliiiugi of trade bo cl.svcly w atched
and the law promptly adopted' to those
change. Hut I would iiiako no change
that should Impair the pnilertive
chancier of the whole, body of the
tariff law. Four year ago, In the
set nf IM.H.1, we ind chaiure of the
character 1 have tried to indicate. If such
rhanges were mad and lit fortifying of
our sciMSMist thus umterliiken at 'a vry
moderate annual outlav, no surplus would
tw found after thst aln-odr accuniulatol
ha I been dwmM-d of. 'Pbe outlay of
money on (oititlcaliiMis, w hile doing great
service to Iho country, would five good
work lo many men."
"Hit, whatalsiiit tlm existing surplus""
"The alisiract of tlio mesjuigo I hav
seen," n-phel Mr. Hlaine, "contains no
refer wee lo that point. I, thrn-fore, make
no continent Inrtuer thuu to Indorse Mr.
Fn-d Or.iul s n-tnsrk that a surplus it
always easier to handle than a delicit."
Tho reporter reported the question
wheiiicr tlio Pn-aitb-ut's reeommendstious
would not give us the advantage of a large
Incn-use on exports?"
"I only repeat," answered Mr. Illslns,
"thst it would vssily enlsrgo our imports,
while Uie only export It would seriously
increase would be our gold and silver."
BOBBING UP SERENELY.
A TIME-HONOBED PBEDICTION BEINO
HANDSOMELY VKBITIED.
Wild and Damaging Reports Concerning
the School Funds Held by the Taxing
District Facts and Figures, and the
Lesson Thoy Toach.
Whenever it ls?st serves a purpose to
distort facts and figures to create desired
impressions, thero are some people capa
ble of just that sort of unscrupulous busi
ness. Ever sineo the first bill against in
dicted Taxing District officials was filed in
the chancery court by the Stale there have
been wild nnd damaging rnmorsalloat con
cerning tho financial condition of the city
and the conduct of the officials. For ex
ample, ono section of tho last bill assert
thst tho public schools have been tho
heaviest sufferers from tho transfer
of funds from other accounts to that
of streets and bridges. .Distressing ro
mances have been built upon this bv the
element unfriendly to tho lludden admin
istration, and for hut purpose? They
know that the public schools are dear to
Iho heart of every intelligent man, woman
nnd child in the city, and if their interests
aro infringed uihdii and their usefulness
hampered, those fruilty of tho crimo will
sink under tho weight" of public displeus
urc. Put what sro the fuels? Tna Ar
I'kai. ycstenlay published tho receipt ot
Mr. 8. 11. Duiiscomb, tn-asurcr oi the
school board, for l.'.Uti'J 07, the full amount
of collections for school purposes, up to
Novemlier I. This receipt wiuj dated No
vember 30.
Another report gained circulation yes
terday that tho school board had
made a demand utwn tho Taxing
District for $J,L'7(1 03, due it on the build
ings and grounds account, but bud failed
to collect, because the Taxing District luuilt
account had been exhausted. Following
the receipt published yesterday morning
was an exiiluuntionof Ibis, to the following
effect: This balance wss ou hand to tho
credit of the school board, and notice of
the Isct bad been served upon it. An offi
cer of the board made application for the
amount on Saturday lust, but owing to the
absence of acting President Jamcl,ce, jr.,
w ho was nt Pudtinih, but exs.-cted homo
Monday, tho collector was unsuccessful.
President ll. D. Jordan visited Maj. J. T.
l'tttit, the remaining police and lirecom
missioner, who promised to sign the check.
Maj. Pettit, being newly elected, and
learning that ('apt. Lee would be ut homo
on Monday, concluded to withhold bis
signal uro and leave tho mutter to bis more
exH'rienced associate. Thi course could
work no hardship on Ihu puUic school in
terest, there being no demand so urgent
that a two-day'a delay could affect. Cnpt.
