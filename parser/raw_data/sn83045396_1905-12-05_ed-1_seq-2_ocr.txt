Merable laughter
Williams Fights Rules
Mr Williams (Miss i sought recognition
for amendment muking the rules ap
plicable for only thirty days. This was I
not permitted, but Mr W illiams Indulged
In u rrltlelcm nf tho nilnc r-nlllncr Ih.m
I manacles and appealing to the "minority
of the majority" to vote against their
adoption He remarked there was a great
difference of opinion gaining ground
imong Republicans as evidenced by the
LaFollette idea, the Cummlngs idea, tho
new Massachusetts free material Idea,
and all sorts of Republican ideas blown
In by every breese from the East and
West, ill looking to a revision of tariff
i-ehedules.
It Is explained briefly by Mr. Dalcell
that the rules offered for adoption had
irevalted substantially since the Fifty
first 'ongress On his motion for the
previous question Mr. Williams secured
f a roll call The vote was i for and 123
against ordering the previous question.
. The rules were then adopted on a viva
L voce vote.
Party lane Moved Over.
1 It was ordered that the dally session
hould begin at noon. The minority floor
employees were authorized, and copies
of the rules were ordered printed.
On Mr. Tawney's motion the drawing
for seats was begun. It was arranged
nfter svmc discussion, that the party dl
ision aisle should be made the llrst alMe
from the center on the Democratic side,
Instead of the center ntele, this being
necessary to accommodate the larger pro
portion of Republican rie mhi rs. The new
arrangement gives the majority part , the
first section of thirty-five seats nearest
the center aisle on the minority side,
ilso tho last section of eighteen Seats,
Known as the "Cherokee strip.' on the
minority side.
