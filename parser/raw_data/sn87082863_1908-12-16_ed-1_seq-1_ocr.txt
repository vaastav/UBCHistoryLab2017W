WASHINGTON. December 15. Dis-
ijrfftne from the published views of
lidrew Carnegie with regard to the
tt schedule of the tariff, Charles M.
xlmab, former president of AeUnited
Sites Steel corporation, gave teRti-
tonj before the house ways and means
tsanittee at the tariff hearing today.
flfle he practically admitted that the
seditions which existed nine years ago
isuld have permitted a reduction in the
frtl schedule at that time, he said that
Ae cost of every item entering into tho
utafacture of steel rails had increased
Ifcrach extent that conditions must be
lUSRea 10 permit liny iurm reduction.
"la fivo years there will not be a
IBeswmcr steel converting plant left in
it United States," Schwab predicted.
"Bessemer steel will be of no use,
tid the same is true of structural Btccl
u well as of rails. They will be made
W the Penhart process of manufacture,
ul costly changes in the construction
i the plant will bo necessary to make
it improvement in tho mothod of man-ifKtnre."
Sehwab also declared that within ten
twrs the "open hearth" process would
if japerfeded by the electric system of
iisnfaeture which is being developed
i Germany.
'These changes intbe process".' of
rfcanufaeturo will increase tho quality
rfrteel," he continued, "but they will
tio slightly increase the cost of pro-
ottion."
Sthwab said he was in favor of any
Ithage in the tariff on steel and steel
prodaets.
Another mining deal of importance,
because of the-high standing in mining
circles of tho prospective purchasers U3
much as on account of tho valuo of tho
property involved, was closed late Mon-
Uaynight, when the papers Tfcre signed
giving to Messrs. H. 11. Norland and
Hoval A. Smith and thoir associate, an
option on tho Kureka group of copper
claims, owned by D. I). Sullivan and
others. Three hundred thousand dol
lars is the price named in tho option
agreement, and payments of 0 per cent
annually are provided for. tho first
payment to be made in sixty days from
the date of the agreement. The bond
is to run threo years. There is a prob
ability, however, that the final payment
will be made long before its expiration.
Tho owners of the original Eurek'n
group aro D. D. Sullivan of Globe. Ariz-
J. Warren Young of Chihuahua, Mexico,
nntt xrank Tabinski and Patrick D. Sul
livan of Calumet, Mich. D. D. Sulli
van, who owns the majority interest,
has been in charge of tho property
for eight years, during which timo tho
value of tho ore shipped (most of it
within n comparatively short timo) was
nearly $250,000. Thero were, added to
this group and included in the deal sev.
eral claims various interests in which
are owned by Wm. Stevenson, J. J.
Keegan and W. D. Fisk of Globe.
Tho property optioned comprises ten
claims (about 130 acres) situated seven
miles southwest of Globe and near the
center of a section of the Globe mining
district that is attracting a great deal
of attention by reason of the phenom
enal ore developments on the property
west is tho Keystone group, now under
bond to the General Development com
pany, and which under former man
agements was a good producer of cop
per. Recent prospecting with churn
drills is said to have revealed sul
phides on tho Keystone property. On
the southeast tho Miami company has
an isolated claim, and adjoining on the
south is the Rerray and Hunt group of
claims. About one mile west of tho
Kureka is situated the Live Oak mine
nnd group of claims, which have also
been acquired through a bond by
-ui'sirs. jiovinnu and smith, and on
which they are now sinking a shaft in
low grade sulphide ore.
As already noted, tho shipments of
ore from the Eureka mino have totaled
nearly a quarter of a million dollars. On
tho Osceola claim of the Eureka group
thero is a bed of conglomerate heavilv
impregnated with copper, from which
has been shipped over 10,000 tons, thnt
averaged about 0 per cent. A short dis
tance fro this conglomerate bed thero
is n stopo following a vein from which
2000 tons of ore have been stoped that
averaged 5 per cent copper, and from
which nine carloads of 10 per cent ore
were shipped to the smelter at Silver
City, X. M. This stope is about 120
feet long, and now has a vein of ore ex
posed twenty feet in width that aver
ages 5 per cent copper. This working
shows about 13,000 tons of ore in sight.
There is a vertical shaft on the property
145 feet deep, situated 100 feet south
of this vein and located with the view
to crosscutting the vein at a greater
depth whero it is expected sulphides
will be uevelojKjd, as they have already

The Miami property has already been
developed into ono of thovcrv largo
low grade copper mines of the United
States, having now blocked out on four
levels more than 12,000,000 tons of sul
phide ore averaging close to 3 per cent
copper. Crosscuts driven toward the
south are breasted in oro near the Hife
of tho Eureka.
Adjoining the Eureka on the west
and north is the Inspiration property,
regarded as among tho most valuable
in Glpbe' district, and which has been
optioned to Wm. B. Thompson of New

Inspiration 1,500,000 tons of chalcocite,

While no plans "for the organization

agreement provides that Messrs. Hov-

shall expend from $30,000 to $50,000 an

ments prove favorable, tho outlay for
opening and equipping tho mine will no

WASHINGTON, December 15. Re
peated peals of laughter greeted the
reading of the opening paragraph of
President Roosevelt's message to con
gress on tho Panama canal charges to
day. As tho secretary read the statement
that the charges were" false in every
particular," Senator Bailey laughed
outright. Other senators on both sides
of the chamber joined with him, and
when tho reader reached the. statement
that a statement in a newspaper which
he mentioned, would not be believed,
thero was general merriment. There was
only a small number of senators pres
ent when the reading was begun and
it was hurried through, tho papers ac
companying the message not being read
at an, me message elicited tho great
est interest in tho house. Members gave
their close attention during its reading,
and there was a ripple of laughter over
tne president's characterization of
Joseph Pulitzer, the published of the
New York World.
Accompanying the president's mes
snge was a largo bundle of documents
bearing upon tho transfer of the canal
property to the United States. Many of
these wero in French without English
translations. There was nothing which
showed directly the persons who re
ceived the $40,000,000 pnid by the
United States, but thero was included
the names of about 7,000 stockholders
in the old and new Panama Canal com
panics, all of them citizens of France
and of the Colombian republic.
There was not one namo of a citizen
of tho United States in the list.
Tho postal saving bank bill was the
subject of speeches by Senators Carter
and Depew, both of whom advocated
the measure. The bill was made the un
finished business of the senate, displac

of the commodity clause of the inter
state commerce law.
On motion' of Senator Fulton, the om

NEW YORK, December 15. Tlu
World in the course of its answer to
President Roosevelt's reference to that
paper in his special message to con
gress today, says: "Mr. Roosevelt, is
mistaken. He cannot muzzle tho World.
While no amount of 'billingsgate' on
his part can alter our determination to
treat him with judicial impartiality and
scrupulous fairness we repeat what
has already been said, that the con
gress of the United States should make
a thorough investigation of the whole
Panama transaction, that the full truth

ple. "Tho World appreciates tho import
ance and significance of Roosevelt's
statement when ho declared to congress
that the proprietor of the World should
be prosecuted for libel by government
al authorities, and, that the attorney
general has under consideration a form
under which proceedings against Pulit
zer can be brought.
"This is the first time that a presi
dent has efer asserted tho doctrine of
lose majesty or proposed, in the ab-
fsenco of specific legislation, criminal
prosecution by the government of citi
zens who criticised the Conduct 'of the
government or tho conduct of individ
unls who may have had dealings with
the government. Neither the kinir of
Great Britain "nor the German emperor
would venture to arrogate such power
to himself. Jolin Adams' attempt to
enforce the sedition law destroyed the
federalist party in America. President
Roosevelt, in the absence of law, offi
cially proposes to use all the power of
the greatest government on earth to
cripple the freedom of the press on the
pretext that the government itself has
been libeled, and that ho is the govern-
jment."

A substantial majority in the houso

simply called for nformation trom tho
secretary of state, regarding what tho
British house of commons had done in
that regard. On a ruling by the speak

the character of the resolution in such
a way as to make it not privileged, and
was sustained, the resolution was then
laid aside on the table.

"Care Killed a Cat," and No Late Shopper Has Nine Lives.
OAKLAND, Calif., December 15.
Mrs. Isabella J. Martin was convicted
this afternoon of dynamiting the home
of Judge Ogden of the Superior court
of Alameila county on the night if
-March 1!), 1907. On that eveningj a
bomb was exploded On tho front pqrch
of the juduo's residence. I
The jury was out ten minutes. Judge
Wells has set 10 o'clock neyt Saturday
morning as the hour for pronouncing
sentence.
It was nearly a year after the ex
plosion at the Ogden home, that it be
came known who set off tho bomb.
"Baby John," the adopted son oi Mrs.'
-Martin, confessed to Deputy Sheriff
Wcavcrrillc that he set tho bomb off at
the instigation of hU foster mother,
who, he said, hought revenge ujwn
Judgo Ogden for sustaining tho demur
rer of the West Chester Insurance- com
pany in a suit she brought against it
to recover insurance for houses she is
said to have fired herself. t
Mrs. Martin. was then in custody on a
charge of arson in Trinity county. When
she learned that "Baby John" had
told tho authorities of the dynamiting,
Mrs. Martin claimed that he had com
mitted perjury. She also declared 'him
to bo the son of Princess Chimayfi but
the assertion was subsequently con
clusively disproved.
"Baby John," who, as nearly as
can be learned, was taken from a New
York foundling asylum, when he was an
infant, by Mrs. Martin, has also con
fessed to a number of crimes to the
commission ,of which ho asserts he was
driven by the woman, among them ar
son, grand larceny, and attempted
wholesale murder
, His confession was a sensational
story of crime.
