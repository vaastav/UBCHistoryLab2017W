Arid Land Question.
Washington, Dec. 3.-Not in many v
years have members of the house t;
listened with such rapt attention to o
the annual message of a president of a
the-United States as they did today to o
the reading of the first message of o
President Roosevelt. Every word was r
followed intently, from the announce- e
ment of the tragic death of President '
McKinley in the opening sentence to fi
the expression of the closing wish that n
our relations with the world would s
Continue peaceful. The reading oc- It
cupied two hours but not over a doz- a
en members left their seats until it ii
was concluded. Several times there t
was applause, and at the conclusion t
there was an enthusiastic demonstra- e
tion on the republican side. ii
On motion of Grosvenor of Ohio that a
portion of the message relating to the ti
death of the late president was refer- ii
red to a committee to consist of one o
member from each state to join a sim- e
ilar committee of the sentate to con- ii
sider and report by what token of re- t]
spect and affection it may be proper t
for congress to express the deep sen- r
sibility of the nation to the tragic a
death of the late president. The t:
speaker appointed the committee, a
headed by Grosvenor, and then as aA
further mark of respect the house ad- a
journed.
In the Senate. J
The senate listened to the message a
and adopted a resolution directing the
appointment of a committee to co
operate with a like committee from
the house to consider by what token !
of respect and affection congress t
might express the sorrow of the na- d
tion upon the tragic death of the late t
President McKinley. r
The message was delivered soon af- c
ter the senate met. The reading oc
cupied nearly two and a half hours a
and was listened to with marked re
spect by the senators. The first por
tion dealing with the Buffalo tragedy.
excited the most profound interest
in the senate.
At the conclusion of the reading of
the message Foraker, senior senator
from Ohio, presented the McKinley
resolution, and as a further mark of r
respect, the senate adjourned.. t
THE MESSAGE. i
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives: :
Tribute to McKinley. I
The congress assembles this year
under the shadow of a great calamity.
On .the 6th of September President 1
McKinley was shot by an anarchist
while attending the Pan-American ex
position at Buffalo, and died in that r
city on the 14th of that month. t
Of the last seven elected presidents
he is the third who has been mur
dered, and the bare recital of this fact
is sufficient to justify grave alarm t
among all loyal American citizens. I
Moreover, the circumstances of this,
the third assassination of an American
president, have a peculiarly sinister
significance.. Both President Lincoln
and President Garfield were killed by
assassins of types unfortunately not
uncommon in history; President Lin
coln falling a victim to the terrible
passions aroused by fQur years of civil i
war, and President Garfield to the
revengeful vanity of a. disappointed
office seeker.
President McKinley was killed by
an utterly depraved criminal belong
ing to that body of criminals who ob
ject to all governments, good and bad
alike, who are against any form of
popular liberty if it is guaranteed by
even the most just and liberal laws,
and who are as hostile to the upright
exponent of a free people's sober will
as to the tyrannical and irresponsible
despot. It is not too much to say that
at the time of President McKinley's
death he was the most widely loved
man in all the United States, while
we have never had any public man
of his position who has been so wholly
free from the bitter animosities in
cident to public life. His political
opponents were the first to bear the
heartiest and most generous tribute
to the broad kindliness of nature, the
sweetness and gentleness of character
which so endeared him to his close
associates. To a standard of lofty in
tegrity in public life he united the
tender affections and home virtues
which are all important in the make
up of national character. A gallant
soldier in the great war for the union,
he also shone as an example to all
our people because of his conduct
in the most sacred and intimate of
home relations. There could be no
personal hatred of him for he never
acted with aught but consideration
for the welfare of others. No one
could fail to respect him who knew
him in public or private life. The
defenders of those murderous crimi
nals who seek to excuse their crimi
nality by asserting that it is exercised
for political ends, inveigh against
wealth and irresponsible power. But
for this assassination even this base
apology cannot be urged. President
-McKinley was a man of moderate
means, a man whose stock sprang
Sfrom the sturdy tillers of the soil,
who had himself belonged among the
wage workers,- who had entered the
army as a private soldier. Wealth

f t he se rvice of the public
'. lhIrespoaulhle or
vidual. The blow was not aimed at
tyranny or wealth. It was aimed at
one of the strongest champions the
wage worker has ever had; at one
of the most faithful representatives
of the system of public rights and
representative government who has
ever risen to public office. President
McKinley filled that political office
for which the entire people vote, and
no president-not even Lincoln him
self-was ever more earnestly anxious
to represent the well thought out
wishes of the people. His-one anxiety
in every crisis was to keep in closest
touch with the people, to find out what
they thought and to endeavor to give
expression to their thought after hav
ing endeavored to guide that thought
aright. He had just been re-elected
to the presidency because the major
ity of our citizens, the majority of
our farmers and wage workers believ
ed that he had faithfully upheld Lneir
interests for four years. They felt
themselves in close and intimate
touch with him. They felt that he
represented so well and so honorably
all their ideals and aspirations, that
they wished him to continue for
another four years to represent them.
And this was the man at whom the
assassin struck! That there might
be nothing lacking to complete the
Judas-like infamy of his act, he took
advantage of an occasion when the
president was meeting the people gen
erally, and advancing as if to take
the hand outstretched to him in
kindly and brotherly fellowship, he
turned the noble and generous confi
dence of the victim into an oportunity
to strike the fatal blow. There is
no baser deed in all the annals of
crime.
The shock, the grief of the country,
are bitter in the minds of all who saw
the dark days, while the president yet
hovered between l.fe and death. it
last the light was stilled in the kindly
eyes, and the breath went from the
lips .that even in agony uttered no
words save of forgiveness to his mur
derer, of love for his friends, and of
unfaltering trust in the will of the
most high. Such a death crowning
the glory of such a.life, leaves us with
infinite sorrow, but with such pride
in what he had accomplished and in
his own character, that we feel the
blow not as struck at him, but as
struck at the nation. We mourn a
good and great president who is dead,
but while we mourn we are lifted up
by the splendid achievements -of his
life and the grand heroism with
which he met his death.
When we turn from the man to the
nation, the harm done is so great as
to excite gravest apprehensions and
to demand our wisest and most reso
lute action. This criminal was a pro
fessed anarchist, inflamed by the
teachings of professed anarchists, and
probably also by the reckless utter
ances of those who on the stump and
in the public press appeal to the dark
and evil spirits of malice and greed.
envy and sullen hatred. The wind
is sowed by the men who preach such
doctrines, and they cannot escape
their share of responsibility for the
whirlwind that is reaped. This ap
plies alike to the deliberate dema
gogue, to the exploiter of sensational
ism and to the crude and foolish vis
ionary who, for whatever reason,
apologizes for crime or excites aimless
discontent.
'·le blow was aimed .ot at -this
president, but at all presidents, at
every symbol of government. Presi
dent McKinley was as emphatically
the embodiment of popular will of the
nation, expressed through the forms
of law, as a New England town meet
ing is in similar fashion the' embodi
ment of the law-abiding purpose and
practice of the people of the town.
On no conceivable theory could the
murder of the president be accepted
as due to protest against "inequalities
an the social order ," save as the
murder of all the free men engaged
Sin a town meeting coula be accepted
Is a protest against that social in
qi.uality which puss a malefactor in
lail. Anarchy is no more an expres
sion of "social discontent" than pick
ing pockets or wife beating.
The anarchist, and especially tie
anarchist in the United States, is,
3 merely one type of criminal, more
dangerous than any other because
t he represents the same depravity in
a greater degree. The man who ad
vocates anarchy directly or indirectly,
t in any shape or fashion, or the man
f who apologizes for anarchists and

r accessory to murder before the fact

evil conduct of those who urge him
on, not in any failures in others or
iby the state to do justice by him and

else. He is in no sense, in no shape,
or no way, a "product of social con
ditions," save as a highwayman is
"produced' uy the fact that an unarm
ed man happens to have a purse. It
is a travestyupon the great and holy
names of liberty ana freedom to per
mit them to be invoked in such a
cause. No man or body of men preach
ing anarchistic doctrines should. be
allowed at large any more than if
preaching the murder or some speci
fied private individual. Anarchistic
speeches, writings and meetings are
essentially seditionF and treasonable.
I earnestly recommend to the con
gress that in the exercise of its wise
discretion, it should take into consid
eration the coming to this country
of anarchists or persons professing
principles hostile to all government
and justifying the murder of those
placed in authority. Such individuals
as those who not long ago gathered
in open meetings to glorify the murder
of King Humbert of Italy, perpetrate
a crime, and the law should insure
their rigorous punishment. They and
those 'like them should be kept out
of the country; and if found here they
should be promptly deported to the
country whence they came, and far
reaching provisions should be made
for the punishment of those who stay.
No matter calls more urgently for
the wisest thoughe of the congress.
The federal courts should be given
jurisdiction over any man who kills
or attempts to kill the president or
any man who by the constitution or
by law is in line of succession for
the presidency, while the punishment
for an unsuccessful attempt should be
proportioned to the enormity of the
offense against our institutions. An
archy is a crime against the whole
human race, and all mankind should
band against the anarchist. His crime
should be made an offense against the
laws of nations, like piracy and that
form of man stealing known as the
slave trade; for it is of far blacker
infamy than either. It should be so
declared by treaties among all the
civilized powers. Such treaties would
give to the federal government the
power of dealing with the crime.
A grim commentary upon the folly
of the anarchist position was afforded
by the attitude of the law toward this
very criminal who had just taken the
life of the president. The people would
have torn him limb from limb if it
had not been that the law he defied
was at once invoked in his behalf.
So far from his deed being committed
on behalf of the people against the
government, the government wasoblig
ed at once to exert its full police
power to save him from instant ceath
at the hands of the people. More
over, his deed worked not the slight
est dislocation in our governmental
system, ~nd the danger of a recur
rence or~suci deeds, no matter how
great it might grow, would work only
in the direction of strengthening and
giving harshness to the forces of or
der. No man will ever be restrained
from becoming president by any fear
as to his personal safety. If the risk
to the president's life became great
it would mean that the office would
more and more come to be filled by
men of a spirit which would make
them resolute and merciless in deal
ing with every friend of disorder. This
great country will not fall into anar
chy, and if anarchists should ever
become a serious menace to its in
stitutions, they would not merely be
stamped out, but would involve in
their own ruin every active or passive
sympathizer with their doctrines. 'Ine
American people are slow to wrath,

The Trusts.
During the last five years business
confidence has been restored and the
nation is to be congratulated because
f its present abounding prosperity.
Such prosperity can never be created
by law alone, although it is easy
snough to destroy it by mischievous
aws. If the hand of the Lord is heavy
upon any country, if flood or drought
comes, human wisdom is powerless
to avert the calamity. Moreover, no
law can guard us against the conse
quences of our own folly.. The men
who are idle or credulous, the men
who seek gains not by genuine work
by head and hands, but by gambling
In any way, are always a source of
menace, not only to themselves, but
to others. If the business world loses
its head, it loses what legislation can
not supply. Fundamentally the wel
fare of each citizen and therefore the
welfare of the aggregate of citizens,
which makes the nation, must rest
upon individual thrift, and energy,
resolution and intelligence. Nothing
can take the place of this individual
capacity; but, wise legislation and
honest and intelligent administration
can give it the fullest scope, the larg
est opportunity to work to good effect.
The- tremendous and highly complex
industrial development, which went
on with ever accelerated rapidity dur
ing the latter ._alf of the nineteenth
century, brings us face to face at the
beginning of the twentieth with very
serious social problems. The old laws
and the old customs, which had almost
the binding force of law, were once
quite sufficient to regulate the accumu
lation and distribution of wealth. Since
the industrial changes which have so
enormously increased the productive
power of mankind, they are-no longer
sufficient. The growth of cities has
gone on beyond comparison faster
than the growth' of the country, and
the upbuilding of the great industrial
centers has meant a startling increase
not merely in the aggregate of wealth,
but in the number of very large indi
vidual, and especially of very large
corporate fortunes. The creation of
these great corporate fortunes has not
been due to tariff nor to any other
governmental action, but to natural
causes in the business world, operat
ing in other countries as they operate
in our own. The process has aroused
much antagonism, a great part of
which is wholly without warrant. It
is not true that as the rich have
grown richer the poor have grown
poorer. On the contrary, never before
has the average man, the wage work
er, the farmer, the small trader, been
so well off as in tlis country and at
the present timne.- There have been
abuifes connected 'with the collection

cidental benefits upon others. Suc
cessful enterprise, of the type which
benefits all mankind, can only exist
if the conditions are sucai as to offer
great prizes as the. rewards of success.
The captains of industry who have
driven the railway systems across this
continent, who have built up our com
merce, who have developed our manu
factures, have on the whole done great
good to our people. Without them
the material development of which we
are so justly proud can never have
taken place.. Moreover, we should
recognize the immense inportance to
this material development of leaving
as unhampered as is compatible with
the public good the strong and force
ful men upon whom the success of
business operations inevitably rests.
The slightest study of business con
ditions will satisfy anyone capable of
forming a judgment that the personal
equation is the most important factor
in a business operation; that the busi
ness ability of the man at the head
of any business concern, big or little,
is usually the factor which fixes the
gulf between striking success and
hopeless failure.
An additional reason ror caution in
dealing with corporations is to be
found in the international commer
cial conditions of today. The same
business conditions which have pro
duced the great aggregations of cor
porate and individual wealth have
made them very potent factors in inter
national commercial competition. Busi
ness concerns which have the largest
means at their disposal and are man
aged by the ablest men are naturally
those which take the' lead in the strife
for commercial supremacy among the
nations of the warld. America use
only just begun to assume that com
mandiug- position in the international
business world whicb- we believe will
be more apd more hers. It is of the
utmost imtortance that this. posit..,
be not )eo~wu , especially atS
time when the overflowing abundance
of our own natural resources and the
skill, business energy and mechanical
aptitude of our people make foreign
markets essential. Under such a con
dition it would be most unwise to
cramp or to fetter the youthful.
strength of our nation.
Moreover, it cannot too often be
pointed out that to strike with ig
norant violence at the interests of one
set of men almost inevitably endan
gers the interests of all. The
fundamental rule in our national life
-the rule which underlies all others
is that, on the whole, and in the long
run, we shall go up or down together.
There are exceptions; and in times of
prosperity some will prosper far more,
and in times of adversity some will
suffer far more than others; but speak
ing generally, a period of good times
that all share more or less in them
and in a period of hard times all feel
the stress to a greater or less degree.
It surely ought not to be necessary
to enter into any proof of this state
ment; the memory or the lean years
which began in 1893 is still vivid and
we cannot contrast them with the
conditions in this very year which is
now closing.. Disaster to great busi
ness enterprises can never have its
effects limited to the men at the top.
It spreads throughout, and while it
is bad for everybody, it is worst for
those farthest down. The capitalist
may be'shorn of his luxury, but the
wage worker may be deprived of even
bare necessities.
The mechanism of modern business
is so delicate that extreme care must
be taken not to interferewith it in a
spirit of rashness or ignorance. Many
of those who have made it their vo
cation to denounce the great industrial
combinations which are. popuilarly,
although with technical ihaccuracy,
known as "trusts,"' appeal especially
to hatred and tfear. Fhes~ are pre

when combined with ignorance, which
unfit men for the exercise of cool and
steady judgment. In facing the indus
trial conditions the whole history of
the world shows that legislation will
generally be both unwise and ineffec
tive unless undertaken after calm in
quiry and with sober self-restraint.
Much of the legislation directed at
the trusts would have been exceeding
ly mischievous had it not also been
entirely ineffective. In accordance
with a well-known sociological law,
the ignorant or reckless agitator has
been the really effective friend of the
evils which he has been nominally
opposing. In dealing with business
interests, for the government to un
dertake by rude and ill-considered
legislation to do what may turn out
to be bad would be to incur the risk
of such far-reaching national disaster
that it would be preferable to under
take notning at all. The men who de
mand the impossible or the undesir
able serve as the allies of the forces
with which they are nominally at war,
for they hamper those who would en
deavor to find out in rational fashion
what the wrongs really are and to
what extent'and in what manner it
is practicable to supply remedies.
All this is true; and yet it is also
true that there are real and grave
evils, one of the chief being over
capitalization, because. of its many
baleful consequences; and a resolute
and practical effort must be made
to correct these evils.
There is a widespread conviction in
the minds of the American people
that the. great corporations k, nowa
as trusts are in certain of their tee
tures and tendencies hurtful to the
general welfare. This spritigs from
no spirit of envy or uncharitableness,
nor lack of pride in the great indus
trial achievements that have placed
this country at-the head of the nations
