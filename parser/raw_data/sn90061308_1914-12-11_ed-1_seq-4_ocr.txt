Young Men Engage in Snipe Hunt
Six of our young men went snipe
hnntinc Mondav nicht.
They went south to Wormington's
pasture and followed up the ravine
to a small pond where five of , the
sportsmen decided to make their first
drive.
The victim was given the usual in
structions as to how to hold thn sack
and also how to snap the necks of the
birds and lay them to one side so that
the sack would not become over
crowded. After the young man with the sack
had been sufficiently instructed and
admonished the conspirators depart
ed with the intention, as they said,
of driving the' snipes into the sack,
but with the intent to sneak oil home
and retire for the night.
The snipes did not matrialize and
at midnight the weary watcher had a
hunch that it was about the proper
time to hit the trail for town.

OFFICER DECKER SHOT
ATPEIRCE CITY
Strangers Attempted to Pass Coun
terfeit Money on. Peirce City
Merchants.
Sunday -night about ' nine o'clock
Feirce City was the scene of quite an
exciting time. As near as can be
learned the facts were about as fol
lows:
A man went into the rostoflice book
store, of which John Lucas is proprie
tor, and purchased from the Baleslady
Miss Pauline Le'Grande, bo me small
article, offering in payment a twenty
dollar bill. Failing to have the change
at the store the man paid for the ar
ticle with small coin and departed.
Previous to this the Peirce City offi
cers had been notified by Joplin ofli
cers to beware of two men who were
passing counterfeit money, and Mr.
Lucas, becoming suspicious of the
man's actions, notified the police and
also the other business men in town.
In a short time the man made his
appearance at Sheldrup's drug store,
purchased a soft drink and again of
fered a twenty dollar bill. Mr. Shel-
drup, under pretense of going into
the back room for change, went out
the back door and called Chief of Fo
lice Melvin Black and Night Watch
man Chas. Decker, who came and ar
rested the man. He asked the officers
to allow him to go to the station for
his grip and to notify his partner who
was waiting there for him. This was
agreed to and on arriving at the sta
tion they were informed by the man's
partner that their grips were down at
the westjend of the platform.
Sus
pecting nothing the officers allowed
the two men to precede them and
when they had gotten quite a dis
tance from the crowd the men sud
denly turned and began firing their
revolvers. Sixteen shots were fired,
but only one was effective, it causing
a slight flesh wound in Officer Deck
er's leg.
In the excitement the counterfeiters
made their escape and have not .t
been apprehended.
Floreth's and Walsh's Stores Robbed.
Sunday night Floreth's hardware
store was broken into and robbed.
The thieves made their entrance by
breaking the shutters from a rear
window. The safe was opened" but
nothing of value had been left in it,
so that the only money they secured
was about $2.00 in pennies and some
Mexican, Canadian and Chinese coins
taken from the cash register. About
a dozen and a half knives, a revolver,
a rifle and some cartridges were also
taken.
Someone also broke into Walsh's
grocery store and took some grocer
ies, but nothing of value was missed.
The Black Bros, bloodhounds from
Peirce City were sent for when " the
robbery was discovered, and they fol
lowed the trail almost to Peirce City,
but when near that placS lost the
scent and no further clue has been
found.

AUSTRIA HURRIES
TROOPS TO BORDER
OF ITALIAN REALM
Massing of Military Forces Is Franz
Josef's. Reply to the Declaration
Made by Premier in the Parlia
ment La3t Thursday "
Milan, Italy, Dec. 7. Advices from
the Austrian frontier are that the
statements of the Italian premier in
the parliament Thursday had an im
mediate echo in the Austrian military
circles. ' " .
"Friday night," the correspondent
says, "the railway lines poured troops
all along the- Italian border and also
into Polar the Austrian arsenal on the
reninsula of Isgria. It is estimated
that 200,000 men are stationed along
the border, and 100,000 at Pola.
"At the same time anti-Italian man
uestations took place at various
points. At one place 'Hungarian sol
diers spat into the faces of Italian
workmen and officers who witnessed
these attacks did not interfere." )
Benefit of Roads to Nonabutting Pro-
' perty Owners.
The road-building specialists of the
department, in Bulletin No. 136, en
titled "Highway Bonds," have the fol
lowing to say about the benefit of a
well-constructed highway to property
owners whose property is not directly
on the road to be improved:
In planning the highway system or
the main market roads it will be
found necessary to omit many roads
the improvement of which is greatly
desired by abutting land owners. The
fact that such property holders must
pay a tax for the bond issue is only
an apparent injustice, for if the high
way system is well planned the entire
county will feel the benefits of the
improvement. As a rule, main mark
et roads reach the majority of pro
ducing areas, and when they are im
proved all land values tend to in
crease.
The fact that cities and larger
towns are frequently taxed for bond
issues' to build highways outside of
their own limits is sometimes made
a point of debate in bond elections
It is argued that because a large part
of the county wealth is within the
corporate limit of such cities' and
towns highway bond money should
also be used to construct their streets.
It is even urged that the expenditure
should be made proportionate to the
assessed valuation within the city
limits. If the proceeds of highway
bond issues were distributed in thin
way, their way, their purpose in many
cases would be defeated. ' The pri
mary object of the county highway
bond issue is to build county market
roads and not to improve city streets,
althoueh a hiirh percentage of the
assessed valuation may be city pro
perty, It is now known that the ex
penditure of city taxes on country
roads in a sound principle and that it
is one of the best features of State
aid for highways. In Massachusetts
the city of Boston pays possibly 40
per cent of the total State highway
fund, but not a mile of State-aid high
way has been built, within its limits
New York "Cityalso pays about 60
per cent of the cost of the State
highway bonds. Some State laws
prohibit the expenditure of proceeds
of State highway bonds within cor
porate limits of cities or towns.
The improvement of market roads
results in improved marketing condi
tions, which benefit tbe city. Most
cities are essentially dependent upon,
the surrounding country for their
prosperty and development. The de
velopment of suburban property for
residence purposes is also dependant
upon highway conditions, and it is be
coming evident yearly that whatever
makes for an increase 4n rural popu
lation must be encouraged. Since
the introduction of motor traffic
country highways are used to an in
creasing extent by city residents.
In fact, the cost of maintaining many
country highways has been greatly
increased by the presence of city
owned motor vehicles. The general
advance in facilities for doing busi
ness from town headquarters when
roads are improved is no inconsider
able factor in the commercial life' of
the community.

COAST
IS SWEPT BY GALE
Huge Seas and Heavy Tide Smash
Houses, Wreck Boats and Flood
Villages
New York, Dec. 7. Huge seas,
backed by a mighty cide and a bowl
ing northeast gale, v battered che
coasts of New York today, smashing
houses, wrecking boats, flooding vil
lages, ' devastating summer resorts
I and forcing transatlantic and coast
wise steamers to remain outside San
dy Hook and fight the storm. .,
At Sandy" Hook the wind attained a
velocity of 68 miles an hour, driving
in a record-breaking tide and making
it impossible for pilots to board in
coming vessels. In New York harbor
the tide was the highest in 13 years
and the waves drove the New Jersey
ferryboats to cover and strewed the
shore of Staten Island with the wreck
of scores of small crafts. In New
York city the wind blew at 48 miles
an hour diminishing to 26 miles to
night, with a forecast of a shift in
the gale attended by more rain or
snow.
The worst damage in this vicinity
was suffered at Coney Island, where
the loss within the past 24 hours is
estimated at $200,000. Two or three
fine houses at Sea-Gate were wrecked,
despite the fight of a small army of
workmen to build defenses with hund
reds of sand bags. The waves threw
them aside, rolled in and tore the
' houses apart. Fifteen buildings along
i Coney Island had been damaged to
night, including big bathing pavil
ions and summer cottages.
At Brighton Beach the board walk
was demolished and the waves surged
around the Brighton Beach hotel and
wrecked several small buildings near
it.
