A VAST SHEET OF WATER
The Valley of the Stuckey Swept
by a Flood.
IMMENSE DAMAGE DONE
Ten Thousand Acres of Cultivated Land
Now Under Water - The
River Is a Raging
Torrent.
Tacoma , Wash.. Dec. 6.-Practically
the whole of the Stuckey valley is one
vast sheet of water. The river itself
Is a raging,flood, destroying thousands
of acres of the most productive land
in the state and threatening some sub
stantial dwellings. It is higher tban
ever known since the valley wds set
tied by white men. Several families I
in the vicinity of Sumner have been
compelled to move to escape the tor
rent.
The rise in the river since the recent
heavy rains has been the greatest and
most rapid ever known. Seventeen
inches in one hour is recorded at Sum
ner and now the water is between six
and seven feet above the ordinary high
water level.
At the county bridge just below the
town there has been recently built a
substantial breakwater for the protec
tion of the structure. A back eddy
has been formed there and the bank
is already cut away for more than 25
feet. If this action of the water con
tinues for a few more hours a new
channel will be formed and the large
amount of rich land known as the
Flats will be wiped- out of existence.
This tract has been used principally tv
the growing of berries and gardening
as is a greater portion of the land of
the entire valley.
The valley ef the Stuckey is about
10 miles in length and averages about
one mile and three-quarters in width.
Of this tract it is stated almost 10,000
acres are now under water. Many
ranchers are talking of leaving the val
ley unless some means can be devised
to either divert a portioh of the water
or dredge the channel as a protec
tion against future overflows.
At present the damage throughout
the valley as a result of the freshet
cannot be estimated.

STATE ORPHANS' HOME.
Annual Report of the superintendent
Made to the Governor.
Special Dispatch to the Standard.
Helena,. Dec. 6.-The annual report of
Wiley Mountioy, asuerintendent of the
State Orphans' Home, was received by
the governor to-day. The report covers
the period from Dec. 1, 1898, ts the first
of this month. It shows that Dec. 1 last
year there were 80 children in the institu
tion, that 54 were admitted during the
year, 31 were placed in homes, 1 died, .
returned to the home and therm were 105
in the home at the beginning of this
month. The increase in the number of
inmates was about 10 per cent over that
of the previ 'us year.
"This probably does not mean that
there are that many more destitute chil
dren," says the report. "but is due, part
ly at least, to the fact that the institu
tion is becoming better known and coun
ties are seeking more and more to obtain
its benefits."
That the home is a healthy institution
is shown by the fact that there have
been but three deaths from its estab.
lishment in September, 1094. since which
time 199 inmates have been received.
Since the retabliehment of the home Sil
ver Bow has furnished more inmates than
any other county. Inr all 44 orphans have
been sent there from the most poprlous
county in Montana, Madison is next, with
21: Beaverhead third with 19; Lewis and
Clarke fourth with 17, Cascade fifth. i4;
Jefferson sixth, 12. Deer Lolget has fur
nished 11 inmates. `allty hac sent but
one. The per capita cost per week has
been $2.18. The total expnoses for the
year, including improvement', repairs.
tools, beating plant, etc., were $2n,010. The
coat of maintenance for the year was
$13,446, of which $1,315 was paid in wages.
The value of the products of the farm
maintained in connection with the home
during the year was $1,65.
Four thousand dollars were expended
in putting in an Inagequate heating plant.
The report says that the institution
lacks room, and unless provision is made.
-dditional children will soon heve to be
refused, utnX'es some now there are fur
alehed homes elsewhere.

A RATE WAR.
It May Demoralize the Eastbound Pas
senger Business.
Chicago. Dec. 6.--AÂ°speclal to the
Record from Sioux City, Iowa, says:
W. B. McNlder, trallic manager for
the Sioux City & Northern railway,
announces that that road mnd the
Great Northern, its northern connec
tion, would go in with the Soo Line
and the Canadian Pacific in making a
rate for first class passenger business
to New York which would be $4 less
than the rate via Chicago and the
eastern roads. This move on the part
of the Hill road, railway men say, will
so demoralize the passenger business
eastbound that a serious rate war may
rtsult. For the present the Chicago,
Milwaukee & St. Paul, Illinois Central
and the Northwestern will not meet the
cut and will continue to sell through
tickets to New York for $28.75, while
the Great Northernr makes a rate of
$24.90.
THE GRAND JURY
IS IN SESSION
Not Expected That Any Matters of Ex
ceptional Importance Will Come
Up for Oonsideration.
Special Dispateh to the Standard.
Helena, Dec. 6.-The United States
grand jury summoned by Judge Knowles
was sworn in to-day and placed at work.
There are 22 members. A majority of the
members live la Helena. The jury is
conopsed of E.dward Oardwell. Cola

After the court had been satisfied as to
the qualiflcations of the jurors he se
lected Edward Cardwell of Cold Spring,
Jeffers i county, as foreman,. and then,
when the jury had been sworn, proceed
ed to inform them as to their duties The
court said that one of the jurors should
be selected as clerk to take the names of
witnesees, dates and places relating to
the eases investigated. Only what could
be called legal evidence should be heard,
hearsay evidence being discarded. This
did not prevent the jury from calling upon
persons who have heard of the commis
slon of some crime to give the jury
something upon which to work. The fore
man of the grad jury had power to ad
minister oaths. There was a clause in
the oath that could be invoked if neces
sary to prevent any witness from disclos
ing the nature of his testimony. The
United States district attorney has the
right to appear before the grand jury and
give such information as he may have
as to crimes against the government, but
he must retire when the jury is about to
ballot upon a proposed indictment. No
one else, save the assistant district at
torney, and, of course, the witnesses, can
appear before the grand jury. Twelve of
the jury can return a true bill: if less
than that number return an indictment
tihe case must be reported as no true bill.
The court especially cautioned the jury
as to secrecy outside of the jury room re
specting what transpired in the jury
room.
The court explained that a grand jury
is a secret inquisition required to act with 1
closed doors. The court would protect
the jurors from outside influences. No
indictment should be returned unless the
jury feels pretty certain that the evidence
would r.e..:t in a conviction at the hands
of a petit jury. The grand jury Is not
called upon to find that person is guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt; that is the
province of a petit jury. The court in
formed the jury that if any witnesses re
fused to testify the court would have
the jury to inform him. The question
that the recalcitrant - :tness refused to
answer should be reduced to writing and
presented to the court, who would then
investigate and take the proper steps to
punish the witness if deemed advisable.
Ti- court spoke of the laws the govern
ment had enact I for the protection of
the mails, the system of currency, the
Indians. etc.. and charged the jury to
taroeully l,,k into any charges that might
be presented as .a infractions of those
laws. The dl-trict attorney would advise
theu jury a, to thse, as the court had
no iknow.cldgo, of th.im.
The Jury rtirr d at t'-e conclusion of the
court's charge. Whtile it is not known
what cases will be preoented to the jury,
it seems to be uniderostcd that nothing
of great ttmpor:ane will be gone into.

MORE TIME IS ASKED'
For Railroads to Equip With
Safety Appliances.
A YEAR MORE NECESSARY
The Inter-State Commerce Commission
Grants a Hearing to Representatives
of tho Roads - Discreditable
State of Affairs.
Washington, Dec. 6.-The interstate
commerce commission gave a, hearing
to the representatives of the several
companies asking for a further ex
tension of the time allowed the rail
roads to equip their lines with safety
appliances. Two years ago the com
mission granted an extension until Jan.
1, 1900. The further extension asked for
at the present time is one year. The
representatives of various labor organ
izations were also present to offer their
side of the case. Representatives of
about a hundred roads were in attend
ance.
John C. Kowan, president of the Bal
timore & Ohio, representing, as chair
man, 88 other roads having 80,000 miles
of lines, made the opening argument.
He said that June 1, 1899, 211,268 freight
cars out of 2,226,000. engaged in inter
state commerce were not equipped with
safety atpliances. Since that time the
number had been reduced to between
150,000 and 175,000. The argument of
the railroads asking for an extension,
he said, was based upon the showing
made by the roads since the last appli
cation. The showing demonstrated that
the railroads had done as well as could
be expected and would ask no further
extension.
Wayne McVeagh, representing the
Pennsylvania and affiliated lines, joined
in asking for the extension. They had
equipped 148.000 out of 160,000.
President Knapp of the commission
stated for the benefit of those present
that of the roads petitioning for an ex
tension over 90 per cent were fully
equipped. ite said there was some mis
apprehension as to the meaning of the
law, which provided that not all the
roads should equip their cars, but that
afte. a certain date no unequipped cars
should participate in interstate com
merce. Fully equipped roads could not
therefore haul unequipped cars after
the expiration of the limit.
At this juncture President Knapp an
nounced that the president had sent
word that he would be glad to receive
the representatives of the railroads and
labor organizations present at the white
house at 1 o'clock. The invitation was
accepted. The committee recessed un
til 2 o'clock.
After the recess Mr. McVeagh again
addressed the commission, dwelling
upon the enormous progress already
made by the railroads, which, he said,
had spent $100,000,000 to comply with the
law. If the extension were not granted
he said the withdrawal of 175.000 cars
from interstate commerce would Inflict
a serious injury upon the business in
terests of the country.
Mr. Fly of the motive department of
the Pennsylvania railroad gave it as his
view that it would be entirely imprac
ticable for one road to equip all the for
eign cars on its line.
President Knapp at this point stated
that a travel!ng inspector of the com
mission who had been examining the
equipment of roads for some time lad
found an almost ideal state of affairs
so far as hand holds and standard
height of draw bars, but that he had
found a surprising state of affairs so
"Never Quit Certant
For Hope."

far as some of th!e lleged automatic
couplers were concerned. It was dis
creditable, he said. The appliances for
operating, the eouplers, especially the
unlocking mechanism, was found out
of order in 25 per cent of the couplers.
The couplers co'ld not be worked ex
cept by going betwe'en the cars and
were more danger' u" than the old links
and pins.
Mr. Ramsey of the Wabash protested
against the statement that 26 per cent.
of the couplers 'lec out of order. He
thought 1 or 2 per cent. would cover
the couplers out of mriler. The secre
tary of the comn.,ission said that four
lodges of raliroar conductors, eight of
locomotive engineers and one of firemen
had petitioned in favor of extedyslon,
and that 11 lodges of ra:lway trainmen,
10 of railroad conductors, three of fire
men and three of engineers had peti
tioned against extension.
E. E. Clark, prlsident of the Order of
Railway Conductors, said he had no
desire to embarrass the commission or
the railroads. The employes wanted to
be reasonable. The. inherent defect in
the law, he said. was that its enforce
ment would punish the innocent as
well as the guilty.
In 1898, said he, 1,959 railroad em
ployes were killed and 31,761 had been
injured. Of these over 600 had been
killed and over 6,000 wounded in coup
ling cars. If the law had been obeyed
and had accomplished its object not
one of those men would have been
killed or injured. As regards the cost,
of which the railroads had complained,
he said it was hard to strike a balance
between dollars and cents and lost
lives and injuries. Railroad organiza
tions during the past two weeks paid
out over $1,000,000 in death and sick
benefits. As men crippled in the serv
ice were debarred from further em
ployment by railroads, those organiza
tions wanted just as few men crippled
as possible. Speaking of the number
of couplers in bad order, to which at
tention has been called, he declared
that until the law became actually
operative it would be impossible to
compel the railroads to keep their coup
lers in good order. He called atten
tion ,to the fact that many roads which
were now completely equipped were be
fore the commission two years ago con
tending that it would be absolutely Im
possible for their roads to equip their
cars in less than five years. He said
few private car lines (owners of refrig
erator cars, etc.,) showed a disposition
to equip their cars. He thought sooner
or later all roads would be obliged to
equip the foreign cars on their lines.
While unwilling to take the position
that the law should be made operative
Dec. 31, he said the railroad employes
asked that their* interests be consid
ered. It seems probable as a result of
the hearing that the commission will
grant the railroads a further extension
of six months within which to comtly
with the safety appliance act.
RECIPROCITY TREATIES.
The eost Important Is That Between the
United States and France.
Washington, Dec. 6.-The reciprocity
treaties negotiated during the con
gressional recess were transmitted to
the senate to-day and in the executive
session were ordered printed and sent
to the committee on foreign rela
tions.
The most important of these treaties
is that between the United States and
France for reciprocal reductions of
tariff rates. The terms of this and the
other treaties are not yet officially pub
lic, either by the state department or
the senate.
Sparkling wines receive the same
benefits accorded to other European
countries.
The reductions allowed the United
States are understood to comprise all
the articles of the French minimum
tariff list, with the following excep
tions:
Horses, stallions, mares and colts:
eggs, cheese, butter, honey, clover seed
and luzerne; sugar, chicory root, feed,
type, porcelain, card board, tanned
hides, leather soles, boot and shoe up
pers, boots, shoes, belting; dynamo elec
tric machinery; machine tools, parts of
dynamos and electric machines.
The reciprocity treaties negotiated
with Great Britain are four in number
for Jamaica. Guiana, Barbadoes and
Bermuda, the Trinidad treaty having
been withdrawn. In the main the con
cessions to the colonies are on food pro
ducts, while reductions on manufac
tured goods, flour, etc., are understood
to be the chief advantage given to the
United States.

TO BE RUSHED THROUGH.
The Republican Members Agree on the
Finaneial Bill.
Washington, Dec. 6.-The republican
members of the house of representa
tives gave their unanimous appcoval
to-day to the house financial bill re
cently introduced, and recommended its
immediate consideration by the house
and passage after reasonable debate.
Mr. Overstreet of Indiana,. who intro
duced and who is in general charge of
the bill, to-morrow will submit a reso
lution asking that a special rule be re
prted for the immediate consideration
of this measure.
The terms of this special rule are
practically agreed upon and provide
that the debate will begin next Mon
day, with a final vote at the close of
the week.
The unanimous approval given tothe
bill came after two hours of discussion
and the adoption of two amendments
approved by the framers of the bill.
When the meeting began Mr. Cannon
of Illinois surrendered the chair to Mr.
Hepburn of Iowa in order to present
his views on some modifications he
thought desirable. These related to the
national banking features. of the bill,.
and Mr. Cannon gave it as his individ
ual opinion that this branch of the
subject might be modified or omitted.
He stated, however, that he supported
the bill as a whole and would vote for
It, and this was further shown when
he voted for the resolution of approval.
Mr. Cannon's suggestions did not take
the form of amendments, however, and
were not pressed.
The main amendment was proposed
by the framers of the bill to clear op
some ambiguity of the present law.
It is to be a new section numbered 9,
and is as follows:
Section 9. That section 10, of an act
approved July 12, 1.02, entitled "An
act to enable national banking associa
tions to extend their corporate exist
ence," be and the same Is amended so
as to read as follows:
"Section 10. That upon a deposit of
bonds as described in sections 5159 and
5160 of the revised statutes, the.asso
clation making the same shall be en
ttloed to receive from the comptroller
of the currency circulating notes of
different denominations in blank, reg
Istcred and countereigned as provided
by law. not exceeding the par value of
the United States bonds so trr.nsferred I
and delitverd, and at no time sha'll the
total amount of such notes issued to
any such association exceed the
amount at such time paid in of its
capital stock, and the provisions of 511i
and 5176 of the revised statutes are
hereby repealed."
Another amendment is to section 40
of the bill. inserting the word "re
domption" before "fund" to make more
plain where redeemed notes and certifi
cates are to be held.
Mr. Warner of Illinois offered an
amendment relating to that feature
known as the impounding of green
backs, but he was satisfied from the
explanations given that the amendment
was not essential and it was wlth
drawn. There were some other sug
gestions and tentative amendments,
but none of them was pressed *nd a
resolution of approval was then unan
imously adopted.
Mr. Overstreet and his associates who
framed ,the bill were warmly congrat
ulated on having been able to command
such complete unanimity and approval,
which is regarded as giving assurance
that the bill will be passed before the
Christmas recess.

SENATE CONTESTS.
A Meeting of the Committee on Privi
leges and Eleetions Called.
Washington, Dec. 6.-A meeting of
the senate committee on privileges and
elections has been called for to-mor
row to consider the protest against the
seating of Senator Quay upon the ap
pointment of the governor of Penn
sylvania and the memorial urging the
unseating of Senator Clark of Mon
tana and Senator Scott of West Vir
ginia because of alleged irregularities
in their respective elections.
It is probable an order will be made
for the taking of testimony in the
Clark and Scott cases and that there
may occur some delay in the consid
eration. No evidence, however, will
be taken in the Quay case, in which
only legal points will be considered.
Both sides of that controversy will be
represented by counsel.
Appointments.
Washington, Dec. 6.-In addition to
the new army and consular appoint
ments sent to the senate to-day there
were also a large number of appoint

were filed. Among the more import
ant were Elihu Root of New York, to
be secretary of war; Joseph W. Fifer of
Illinois, to be interstate commerce com
missioner; Bellamy Storer of Ohio, to be
minister to Spain; Lawrence Townsend
of Pennsylvania, to be minister to Bel

FILLS CUBANS WITH JOY
The President's Message Gives
Great Batisfaotion.
INDEPENDENCE ISASSURED
Oubans Rely Upon Congress to Realize
the Promise Made by McKinley.
They Fear the Power of
the Trusts.
.Havana, Dec. 6.-President McKin
ley's mesage to congress has been re
oelved by Cubans of all classes with
much satisfaction. Even the leaders
of the extreme party admit this and the
announcement that there will be no
civil government has cleared away the
clouds that have been hanging over
the Cuban political situation.
General Collaso says:
"The message will pacify the coun
try. The president's statements are
not very concrete, but if congress
guarantees the independence of Cuba
we need not ask for any specification
as to the time for the removal of the
American troops, although everybody
would be glad to see the black troops
go, because of the excesses they com
mit.
"Cubans fear the administration, but
they do not fear congress. The admin
istration represents the trusts. Al
though Cubans are as good business
men as Americans, they could not com
pete with the enormous power of the
trusts, which, by creating monopolies,
would eventually enslave the working
men. We wish to see each man own
ing some property, at least enough to
make it worth his while to behave as
a good citizen should, instead of going
to the woods."
Gualberto Gomez said:
"I had expected the message to be
encouraging, but I had not expected
such 'clearness of thought. Congress
will go further and will justify the hope
of the Cuban people."
* The Discussion says:
"President McKinley's message wilt
fill the hearts of all lovers of Cuba
with joy. His words 'Whatever be the
outcome we must see to it that free
Cuba be a redlity, not a name,' should
be written in letters of go:d over the
door of the Cuban white house. The
Cuban republic wilJ be bound to Lin
coln and 'McKinley by indissoluble
bonds of love."
The Patria says:
"Hurrah for President McKinley, He
could not have spoken in clearer tones.
It is impossible for the giddiness of
conquest to overpower the deep, nat
ural impulse of a noble and democratic
people."
The Cubano says:
"The message contains the clearest
words yet spoken by President McKin
ley and shows that justice is the guid
ing principle at Washington. Our
hearts, httherto bowed down by tre
mendous skepticism, are now relieved
and we may expect congress to .speak
still more clearly."
Quiet at Diamondyrlle.
Special Dispatch to the Standard.
Diamondville, Wyo., Dec. .--To-day
was another quiet day so far as the
strike situation is concerned. About
50 more deputies arrived and reported
for duty to Sheriff Ward. A great many
of the strikers have expressed a will
ingness to return to work if they get
an opportunity. To-morrow, however,
will no doubt bring about great
changes, as it is understood the com
pany will attempt to operate its mines
to-morrow. Some of the strikers will
surely try to prevent this.
