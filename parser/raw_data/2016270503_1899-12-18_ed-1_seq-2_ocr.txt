In speaking of the currency bill
Money says that In his annual report
the comptroller of the currency favors
the issue of notes of national banks to
the par value of the bonds deposited,
instead of to only 90 per cent thereof;
but he insists that this Increased circu
lation should be specially taxed. jOf
course the government has assumed
the responsibility for the ultimate re
demption of these notes, and should
be amply; secured; but the argument
against permitting note-issues to the
par of the bonds necessarily implies
J.k of faith by the government in its
own bonds; how could the government
be better secured than by its own ob
ligations, upon which it engages to
pay 100 cents to the dollar? The house
bill voices the sentiments of the peo
ple, that the bonds of the United
States should be held by the United
States to be at all times worth at least
par.
The opinion some people have of the
president's idea of trusts, notwith
standing his recent utterances in his
message, may be seen from the fol
lowing from one of the foremost
writers: "What a ridiculous farce It
is for President McKinley to recom
mend to congress the passage of
stringent laws for the restriction of
trusts. Mr McKinley knows that both
he and the members of congress con
stituting the majority of that body
are the beneficiaries of trust contribu
tions to Hanna's boodle campaign fund
of '96. Mr McKinley knows that the
party in power does not dare to inter
fere with the gigantic jobbery in
which the trusts are reveling. Mr
McKinley knows that more trusts
were organized under his administra
tion than under all other administra
tions combined. More than this, Mr
McKinley knows that there is a com
pact riveted with bolts of steel be
tween the trusts and his political man
ager, Marcus A. Haona, by which
these great combines are to reap the
reward of their munificent contribu
tions to the republican campaign fund,
and that as evidence of good faith on
the part of Eanna, he had McKinley
appoint a trust attorney from the
trust-ridden state of New Jersey at
torney general. Mr McKinley and his
party have been in full control of the
legislature and executive depart
ments of the government for the past
three years. Can anyone point to a
single act which could disturb the
plans of the trusts, or retard them in
their purpose of suppressing trade
competition? Mr McKinley mistakes
the intelligence and temper of the
American people when he supposes
they will be caught by such chaff as
constitutes that portion of his mes
sage devoted to trusts."
ENGLAND'S PERIL.
The many successful reverses given
the English army by the Boers, the
poor, insignificant Dutch farmers, as
some people term them, has given Eng
land something to think and talk about,
and it has also filled the whole world
with amazement. It was hardly what
the boastful English army looked for.
No doubt many of them thought the
mere putting of a big army into the
field would scare the Boers so that
they would lay down their arms and
go home. They reckoned without
their host however, for the Boers not
only stood their ground, but, as we
have said on a former occasion, there
is some danger of these sturdy South
African farmers exterminating ttie
whole English army. Already ihey
have given the greatest nation in the
world such a licking that it has been
shaken to its very foundation. ' Yes,
England, the great and mighty Eng
land, who has for so long ruled on
land and sea, has, it would appear.
reached the limit. Perhaps the God of
battle, the God of right and justice has
decreed that grasping England has
bulldozed and terrorized the weak na
tions in her power just long enough,
England has been a good deal like Ibe
big boy or bully in the school or col
lege, who treated his small chums In
such a manner that whenever the bully
asked for what they had, and what
rightfully belonged to them, they in
fear and trembling, gave it up. But
there came a time when the bully met
his match, , when the once weak and
timid boys grew up and asserted their
rights. And so it is with England
She has gone Just one step too far, and
that step may be the means of awak
ening her to a full sense of .her own
weakness. A glance at the following.
taken from the New York Journal, will
show the reverses England has thus
far met with, and why some one
should step in and save ber from worse
defeats; .

600 were taken prisoners.
.' Methuen: November 23, checked at

of" 195.. November 28, overcome at

ber 12, driven back in a rout at Ma
gersfontein with a loss of 832.
Buller: Commander-in-chief of
South African forces, who boasted that
he would eat Christmas dinner in Pre
toria,, attempted to cross Tugela river
at Colenso Saturday; driven back with
heavy loss. The New York Herald of
yesterday said more than 1,100 men
and officers were lost to Buller.
HEARD IN PASSING.
There are quite a number of repub
licans in congress who express, their
approval of the gold standard bill in a
way.,, that shows the words to be
forced, under orders. .
If Secretary Long persists in his de
mand that congress shall give Sampson
honor belonging to Schley, there may
be a new secretary of. the navy;
Schley's friends, in congress are nu
merous and influential. .
' 'The democrats intend pushing trust
legislation at this session of congress.
Senator Morgan of Alabama has in
troduced an anti-trust joint resolution
which he says he intends forcing to a
vote if it possibly can be done, and
Senator Chilton of Texas says the
same about the anti-trust bill he has
introduced. '
The appointment of General Leon
ard Wood, whose nomination to be
major .general of volunteers was con
firmed by the senate this week, to be
military governor of Cuba, is regarded
as the best thing that has happened
for the Cubans for some time, as he
nas shown by his management of the
province of Santiago that he thorough
ly understands how to get along with
them. '
Mr Quay is in Washington, making
a personal appeal to senators to vote
to seat him on' the governor's creden
tials. It 'is said -that if he -does not
receive assurances from sufficient
p. umber of senators to make it abso
lutely certain that he will be seated,
he intends to withdraw Ms applica
tion .and credentials, but there. Is a
doubt as to whether he could with
draw them. . '
KILLS WITHOUT HITTING.
What is lyddite? The high explo
sive thus called from the name of the
small Kentish town and gunnery cen
ter where the experiments with it were
made, is nothing less than picric acid
brought into a dense state by fusion.
Picric acid is a bright yellow substance
freely used in peaceful industries for
dyeing purposes. It is obtained by the
action of nitric acid on phenol or car
bolic acid. It burns very violently,
and owing to the tremendous blast
produced by the explosion the destruc
tive effect of a bursting shell filled with
it is some eleven times greater than
that of a shell filled with powder.
Common shells of forged steel filled
with; lyddite are used with 6 and 9.2
fnh breechloading guns, and with
howitzers; also with 4 to 6-inch quick
firing gunsi Now, we have none of the
first mentioned for land service proper,
guns of precision up at the front;
neither have. we yet dispatched any of
our field howitzer batteries. Therefore
the lyddite shells of which Joubert
complains must have been fired from
the 4 to 6-inch quick-firinff guns which
the naval brigade so opportunely
brought with them. In fact, the fight-
insr around Ladysmith on Monday, Oc
tober 30, must have witnessed the
Boers' first introduction to lyddite, for
the common shells fired by our field
batteries arid up till then the enemy
had not had to face any other kind of
gun are not charged with it, but with
powder. V'
All lyddite shells are equipped with
percussion nose fuses only; ( hence
their explosion takes place or impact
in the following fashion: The percus
sion fuse ignites a picric powder ex
ploder; 'which in turn ignites the burst
ing -charge of lyddite, the detonation
of the. fuse and of the two explosives
inside the shell being instantaneous.
The picric powder exploder, we should
add, is inserted in a recess left in the
lyddite for that purpose. Lyddite
shell is td, some extent less barbarous
than shrapnell exploded by powder,
for, though wide-spread, its death-dealing
effects are due more to air concus
sion than to the wounding effects of
the flying fragments. In other words,
in the case of a lyddite shell bursting
in a group of men, the gieater number
will be killed not by pieces of the Shell
but by the blow of the suddenly com
pressed air. Montreal Herald.
An Indian Death Feast.
BUFFALO, Dee. 18. A death feast
was held on the Cattaraugus Indian res
ervation at Gowanda Saturday afternoon
at the conclusion of the mourning period
in honor of David Stevens, the Wolf
chieftain, who died ten days ago at his
home near Lawtons. During this mourn
ing period fire and fresh food have been
kept on his grave, and a small excavation
to the body has been open to let the dead
chief's spirit absorb the spirit of the food
and warmth. The feast was held at the
late pagan's borne. The braves were
slow in assembling, but after a time the
pagan high priest, Herman Crow, arose
and, turning his back upon the people,
began to talk in "the native tongue, look
ing out of the open'; door, his eyes resting
upon the ground. After he had spoken
for a time the effects of the dead chief
tain were brought out, the speaker taking
piece .by pieceJ rtJking at length about
each one and giving them to the persons
appointed to receive them. This ceremo

A PROTEST,
J say, I knew a niggro once .....
A. lazy, wooly beaded dunce; v'
Who couldn't read, and couldn't write,
And couldn't sing or dance or fight,
Or couldnrt tune the old banjo,
And wouldn't dig and wouldn't hoet
Dr work at all to get in cash.
To keep his marm and kids in hash
And that dad-fetched, sheep-headed
moke,
Got up one Sabbath night and spoke
Right out in meeting, and he said:
"De wrath of God be on de head
Of sech as watah-millions steal
Furn out of Cyurnel Cyarter's fiel."
And so he hired this chap." instead,
And then the knock-kneed pious fraud
Assumed a partnership with God.
If that watch coon worked in the sun,
From dawn until the day was done; ,
He'd think that when the shadows
came
To veil the golden western flame, -About
how good. 'twould be to go
Just kind of sauntering like and slow
Across the hill and down the lane
To where that child of sun and rain ,
Was lying there, so cool and nice
Just tempting folks to haye a slice
Would he with pray'r guard foot and
hand'
And keep from off the colonel's land?
I guess not. All that he would see
Is watermelons ripe and free
And he'd go in and pile in tight,
And hide his face in pink and white.
He ain't no angel only days
Wljen he finds angel business pays.
' Albert Doyle in Pilot.
WHY POE KICKED THAT GOAL.
Princeton men have not begun to
tire of talking about the goal kicked
from the field by Arthur Poe, that
brought victory to ''Old Nassau" in
the game against Yale a week ago.
They never tire of it With every new
telling there comes a new version of
how it happened. So it may not be
amiss to tell how it all came about in
order to have the record set straight
for football historians.
Poe, as is well known, was not con
sidered one of the goal-kicking men of
the eleven. He was too useful as an
end player to have his abilities as a
kicker developed. It is a fact that he
was not used to kick for goals in' any
of the open games against the scrubs,
nor in secret practice. In fact, all the
training he had had in this direction
was that which he gave himself in in
dividual practice. He succeeded well
enough then to have considerable con
fidence in himself, though he said noth
insr of it to his fellows.
When Princeton's team was battered
almost to pieces the coaches on the
side lines decided that the only way to
avert the threatened defeat was to try
for a goal from the field as a last re
sort. "Biffy" Lea, head coach of the
eleven, then resorted to the tactics that
called forth a lot of criticism in some
quarters. He sent Duncan up to
Burke, who was playing at quarter in
the team, now made up chiefly of sub
stitutes, with the necessary instruc
tions, and Burke communicated them
to Captain Edwards. Those who re
call the incidents of the game will re
member that just after Duncan's brief
visit to the team there was a consulta
tion between the players.
In that consultation Captain Ed
wards -decided that Mills, who had
done most of the kicking of this sort
for the team, should make the trial.
The hard buffeting Mills had received
in the scrimmages in which he had to
wrestle- against Olcott. one of Yale's
strongest line men, had made him
nervous. He didn't like to try for a
goal and fail. As the man who tells
the story said. "Mills had a trifling at
tack of cold feet." Captain Edwards
was a bit nonplussed, and had decided
to make the attempt himself and take
whatever blame or credit should come
from failure or success.
It was then that Poe came to the
rescue. "Give me the ball and I'll
kick the groal sure," he said, quietly but
firmly. Edwards wasn't so sure of
Poe's" ability to kick a goal, but he did
know that Poe was always cool and
collected and never allowed himself to
get rattled under any circumstances.
So when the team lined up, with but
two minutes left in which to win or
lose, Poe dropped back toward the
quarter back and the half backs
moved over to his place at the end of
the line. Bannard passed the ball to
Pop. who cooly. as if lie had been used
to that sort of thing all his life, bal
anced the spheroid for an instant,
gauged the distance accurately and
then made the kick that brought the
victory. "
And-this is the true story -of how
Arthur Poe came .to be the football
hero of 1899. New York Times.
EVERY DOG IN TOWN.
The man who knows everybody, an.l
the way to every place in the town
where he lives is quite common. But
there is a(man in Washington who
was "born and raised here," as the na
tive Washingtonian speaks it, who
knows everybody's dog, and the dog's
name. He will stand on a corner and
point them out as they travel hither
and thither. He was in front of Wil
lard's the other day when a cur of low
degree poked his nose .around the cor
ner. "That's Beriah Wilkins's dog," he
said to his acquaintances who also
prides himself upon knowing a good
deal about everything in Washington.
"It looks more like Jim Riley's dog,"
said the acquaintance.
"Jim Riley's dog don't wear any col
lar," replied the authority.
" 'Cause that dog wears a collar it's
no sign he's Beriah AVilkins's dog."-
"No that's so. But Beriah's dog
has got a goitre in liis neck, and is a
little off in one eye.
The authority whistled to the cur
and when he came up familiarly the
authority showed his friend the marks
of Mr Wilkins's clog. This led to a
bet that the authority could name the
owner of every dog that passed the
corner, and in 30 minutes he called
the ownership of 14, and offered as
testimony of his claim to follow the
dogs home. It may have been a bluff,
but people who know say it wasn't.
Not only does he declare that he
knows these things, ' but ne offers a
wager that he can tell the ownership
of the dogs, by their bark. , .
