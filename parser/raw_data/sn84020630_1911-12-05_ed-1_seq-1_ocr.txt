SUPRLME COURT HAS SESSION
Chief
Clerk Alan R McCord
Will Remain at
Santa Fe.
It may be New Year, before the re
port of the official canvassing board
is in the hands of President Taft. Up
to last evening, ten precincts of Ber
anlillo county had been canvassed.
There is hope that Bernalillo county
may be completed by tonight. Berna
lillo county has twenty-two precincts,
and if it takes a 'day to canvass twenty-two
precincts, how long will it
take to canvass 600 precincts? The
precincts canvassed up to adjourn
ment last evening were: San Jose,
Del Rio, Alameda, Ranches de Atris
co, Ranchos de Albuquerque, Barelas,
Los Padillas, San Antonio, Los Grie
gos and Escobosa. . The Albuquer
que precincts with their heavy vote
! were tackled today. More irregular
ities are beginning to appear. In
Clayton the supply of Blue Ballots
was exhausted and about fifty voters
could not express their wishes on
'.: this question. In Socorro county, the
county commissioners opened sever
al ballot boxes to get the poll books
to be sent to Santa Fe and Probate
Clerk E. H. Sweet had to come to
Santa Fe to identify the books and
certificates.
Bernalillo County Completed.
At noon, the canvass of Bernalillo
county was completed. Three or four
slight discrepancies still needed ad
justment, but indications now are
that the canvass will proceed more
rapidly. All the candidates gained a
few votes over the unofficial returns,
but the advantage lay decidedly with
the Democrats who gained from 11 to
31 in their Bernalillo county majori
ties. If this ratio is maintained in
the other counties, then only a few
of the Republican state candidates
have pulled through. :
Territorial Funds.
The following sums of money were
received at the office of the territorial
treasurer: Tito Melendez, treasurer
of Mora county, $4,026.66; Thomas P.
Gable, game and fish warden, game
protection fund, $69.50. The quarterly
statement of Territorial Treasurer R.
J. Palen published yesterday shows
balances in the territorial treasury
aggregating $568,199.02.
Chief Clerk Will Remain.
Chief Clerk Alan R. McCord of the
office of the surveyor general, who re
cently had been ordered to Boise,
Idaho, has received orders that his
transfer has been cancelled and that
he will remain at Santa Fe. This will
be joyous news to his many friends
and associates in Masonic, church
.and social as well as business circles.
Insurance Matters.
Peter A. M. Lienau, deputy insur
ance commissioner, will leave tomor
row for New York City where he win
.attend the meeting of the Insurance

WOMEN OUT IN FULL FORCE
Socialists Claim Victory for Har
riman by 10,000
Majority
iBy Special Leasea Wire to New Mexican)
Los Angeles, Calif., Dec. 5. Kiec-
tton. day here dawned clear and bright j
and a heavy early morning vote was
polled. The various voting places,
235 of them, were opened at 6 a. M.,
and will remain open until 6 this
evening.
In those precincts where what is
known as the "labor vote" was heavi
est, the early voting was spirited.
Long lines of men and women were
waiting when the judges opened the
polls. Because of the heavy registra
tion of women, many of the precincts
were divided into two or three voting
places.
' No Signs of Disorder.
Though the early vote was heavy,
there were no signs of disorder. The
proportion of men and women voting
early seemed about equally divided.
Leaders for both the Good Govern
ment and Socialist forces claimed the
big early vote presaged victory for
their candidates. The Good Govern
ment forces declared it was simply
a matter of counting the majority for
Alexander, many of them not being
willing to admit that Harriman, So
cialist candidate for mayor, had even
a chance.
Socialist Claims.
On the other hand, Harriman lieu
tenants claimed he would win by not
less than 10,000. They based their
hopes, they said, on the large regis
tration of working women.
"We have more women registered
than the Alexander forces," said the
leader," and we only have to make up
a deficit of about 8,000 votes as
shown by the primary to elect Harri
man." 185,000 Registered.
', Both sides have many automobiles
in use getting out their full strength
and claim that more than eighty per
cent of the approximately 185,000
registered voters will cast their bal
lots. .

Sherman anti-trust law. Admitting
the truth of many of the contentions
set up in the complaint, the answer
denies that the defendant association
is engaged in restraint of trade in any
way and that its principal duty is the
dissenminatlon of. information of the
lumber business among its members.
The association contends that by
the natural .aws of trade retailers in
any line, object to wholesale selling
direct to consumers, and . that such
sales are made clandestinely. The

HE IS TRULY PENITENT NOW
His Brother Is Given Fifteen
Years at St. Quentin
Penitentiary.
By Special Leased Wire to New Mexican)
Los Angeles, Calif. Dec. 5 James
3. McNamaru, confessed murderer,
was sentenced to life imprisonment
here today by Judge Walter Bordwell.
His brother, John J. McN'amara, secre
tary of the International Association
of Bridge and Structural Iron Work
ers, who confessed to the dynamiting
of the Llewellyn Iron Works, was
sentenced to 15 years in the peniten
tiary. Twenty-one persons lost their lives
in the Times disaster. No one was
killed in the Llewellyn Iron Works
affair.
Murderer Pens Confession.
The imprisonment of both men will
be in San Quentin penitentiary. James
B. McNamara's brief confession, penn
ed by his own hand and bearing many
evidences of a man iittle skilled in
letters, follows:
"I, James B. McNamara, defendant
in the case of the People, having here
tofore pleaded guilty to the crime of
murder, desire to make this state
ment of facts:
Planted Sixteen Sticks of Dynamite.
"And this ie the truth: On the
night of September CO, 1910, at 5:45 p.
m., I placed in Ir.;: alley, a portion of
the Times building a suit cas? con
taining 16 sticks of 80 per cent dyna
mite, set to explode at 1 o'clock the
next morning. It was my intention
to Injure the building and scare the
owner. I did not intend to take the
life of any one. I sincerely regret
that these unfortunate men lost their j
lives. If the giving of my life would
bring them back I would gladly give it.
In fact, in pleading guilty to murder
in the first degree, I have placed my
life In the hands of the state.
(Signed) "JAMES B. M'NAMARA."
Murder in the First Degree.
After the reading of the confession,
Judge Bordwell asked:
"Is that statement correct?"
"It is," said McNamara.
"Then the court finds," said the
judge, "that the degree of guilt of the
defendant is murder-in the first do4
gree."
"James B. McNamara, you may
stand," he said.
"What is your full name?"
"James Boyd McNamara," said the
prisoner.
The court then began a formal state
ment, reciting the indictment for the
murder of Charles J. Haggerty upon
which McNamara pleaded guilty and
asked McNamara if be had any state
ment to make.
"I have not," he said.
"Have you anything to say?" the
court asked of District Attorney Fred
ericks.
No Dickering.
"There has been no dickering or
bargaining in this matter," replied
that official.
Counsel on the other side are well
aware of the usual custom of granting
clemency to persons pleading guilty.
This defendant by so pleading has
settled for all time a question which
otherwise would always have been in
doubt. He saves the state great ex
penditures and served the state in
other ways."
The defendant will arise," said
Judge Bordwell, and then commented
upon McNamara's declaration that he
did not intend to destroy life.
A Murderer at Heart.
The circumstances are against
that statement " he said. "A man
who will place 16 sticks of dynamite
in a place where you. as a printer
knew gas was burning in many places
and knew many were toiling, mu?t had
no regard for life; must 'have been
a murderer at heart and undeserving
ing of clemency."
For reasons other than such a plea
of noiWntent, Judge Bordwell Aet
clared, tie would impose the penalty of
imprisonment for life.
John J. McNamara came next. The
Llewellyn Iron Works indictment was
read to him by the judge.
Plea for Clemency.
He said he had nothing to say. Dis
trict Attorney Fredericks, however,
said that as in the other case, the
plea of guilty permitted consideration
but pleaded that the defendant John
McNamara, be given "a few years
at freedom at the end of his life."
Judge Bordwell declared that the
strictures against James B. McNamara
would also apply to him.
Clemency, he declared, was not be
cause of merit as to intent He then
imposed sentence of fifteen years in
San Quentin penitentiary, one more
year than had been predicted.
The McNamaras were taken from
the court room back to the jail.

E IS PROFITABLE
Great
Uneasiness Is Felt for
Future Safety of
Foreigners
(By Special ased Wire to New Mexican)
Shainghai, Dec. 5. Each day
brings keener apprehension that
China is drifting into a political
chaos.
The revolutionary juntas here are
now marking time, awaiting the arri
val of Dr. Sun Yat Sen. It is hoped
that he may prove to be the leader
whom every one is Beeklng. If he
can line up the various revolutionary
chiefs and unify the movement, a so
lution of China's troubles may be
hoped for. There are dissensions
everywhere among the rebels, espe
cially at the Wu Chang and Nanking
headquarters.
Wholesale Desertions.
The fall of Han Yang test week
proves to have been . due entirely
to wholesale desertions of rebel
troops enrolled in Hunan province.
The Rebel General Hunang Sing,
who was at Wu Chang as second in
command to General Li Yuen Heng,
left Han Yang a short time before
the imperialists regained that city.
He arrived in Shankhai this week
and immediately proclaimed himself
generalissimo of the revolutionary
forces, and assigned to Li a subsidi
ary place. Huang asserts that he
has been given the right to name a
temporary premier or educator to act
pending the election of a president.
He is now making plans, he says, for
an overland advance on reKing
through Shang Tung province.
Cost of Struggle.
The cost of the struggle thus far
has been far greater than is easily
realized. Apart from the losses of the
campaign and battlefields, it has
plunged a majority of the province
into poverty and famine, it has stop
ped all commerce and trade, crippled
agriculture and Industry and divert
ed practically every penny of tax rev
enue from the purposes of peace.
Brigand-ige Is Profitable.
Brigandage is almost the only prof
itablejrofessionie.fjLto a people hith
erto peaceable and orderly. Millions
are starving within a radium of a fc.w
hundred miles of Shanghai. In in
creasing numbers there are brought to
this city accounts or robberies ar.d vi
olence and ven the Killing of Euro
peans has ceased to be exception In
the absence of law and order. Close
observers are more and more uneasy
regarding the prospects for foreign
ers in the immediate future.
Both sides are financially close to
bankruptcy and realize that there
first need is to establish credit.

ter is available and the water sup
ply for this land has been provided at
a higher cost than previously had been
considered practicable.
"Such a condition means that the
land actually irrigated must bear the
expense for the idle land, or that the
investor in irrigation must wait in
definitely for returns upon his money.
His own legitimate burden is all the
new settler possibly can bear and con
sequently the investor must carry the
load. r'. '.' - ----
"There is little doubt that most of
our irrigation enterprises are practic
able and would succeed to the satis
faction of all concerned if all the land
for which water is provided were pro
ducing returns but one-third or one
half or three-fourths of the land can
not carry the whole load.
"The conclusion is obvious, what
the west needs now is not more irri
gation works but more Irrigating."
The total acreage irrigated in sev
enteen western states in 1909 was 13.-
739,499 as compared with 3,631,381 in
1889. In 1889 California stood first
with 1,004,233 acres, Colorado second
and Montana third. In 1909 these three
states still held the highest places with
Colorado first with 2 792,032 acres,
California was second with Montana
third, and Idaho a close fourth.
A fact brought out by the census is
that a large percentage of the acre
age was irrigated by co-operative, in
dividual and partnership enterprises,
about 84 per cent of the whole being
included in this character by the fol
lowing: United States Reclamation Service,
395,646 acres.
U. S. Indian service, 172,912 acres.
Carey Act enterprises, 288,553 acres.
Irrigation districts, 533,142 acres.
Co-operative enterprises, 4,646,039
acres.
Commercial enterprises, 1,444,806
acres.
Individuals and partnerships, 6,258,
401 acres.
A lengthy table showed thait in
1910, existing enterprises were ready
to supply 19,335,711 acres of land with
water. The larger part of this ad
ditional acreage was in five states.
Colorado reported over one million
acres, Idaho and California each re
ported a little less than a million
acres and Montana and Wyoming each
showed over half a million.
The acreage reported as. included
in projects is 31,112,110, an increase
of 17,372,611 over the acreage irrigat
ed in 1909. This additional acreage is
distributed among the states in about
the same proportions as in 1909, ex
cept that Oregon reports nearly 2, 000,
000 acres. Much of this land under
ditch but not yet irrigated is undoubt
edly in farms which are already taken
up but only partially irrigated.
