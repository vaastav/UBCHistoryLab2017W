Tfco lennaatatn Casusi,
He calls attention to the need of an
Isthmian canal, and says:
"Ita Importance to the nation is by no
me ana limited merely to its material ef
fects upon our business prosperity, and
yet with a view to theae effects atone It
would bo to tho last dearreo important
for us Immediately to begin it. While its
beneficial effect a would perhaps be most
marked upon tho Pacific coast and tha
gulf and south Atlantic atates, tt would
aUso greatly bone&t other sections. It is
emphatically a work which It la for tha
Interest of the enure country to beg.n
and complete aa soon as possible; It is
one of those great works which only a
great nation can undertake with proa
pec t a of success and which whan dona
are not only permanent aaaets In the na
tion's material Interests, but atandtug
monuments to Its constructive ability."
Of tha new treaty recently concluded
with England tia says; "I am glad to ba
able to announce to you that our negotia
tions on this subject with tireat Britain,
conducted on both slrtee In a spirit of
friendliness and mutual good will and re

lay oetore tne senate a treaty wnicn ir
ratified will enable us to begin preparations
for an Isthmian canal at any time and
which guaranteee to this nation every right
that it has ever asked In connection with
tho canal. In this treaty the old Olayton
Bulwer treaty, so long recognised aa in
adequate to supply the base for the con
structlon ar.d maintenance of a necessarily
American ahlp canal, ta abrogated. It spe
cially provides that the United Statea
alor.e shall do the work of building and
arsume tho resVonsMIItv of eefeguardlrg
tha canal and snail regulate Its neutral use
by ail nations on tens of equality
without tha guarantee or Interference
of any outside nation from any quar

ba laid before tha aenate, and If ap
proved tho congress can then proceed- to

Tfco Monro Doatrla),
The president sets forth the objects of
the Monroe doctrine, and tho spirit in
which It has been received by other
countries, and In connect ion with It aays
this nation has not tho sltehteat desire to
acquire any territory at the expense of
I any or our neignoore, and cites our atti
tude toward Cuba aa a guarantee of our
, good faith. He aays also that ' this
i doctrine haa nothing to do with tha cora
1 mere la 1 relations of any American power
j save that It In truth allows each of them
to form ueh as it iiree." That "we
! do not aak for any excluaivo commercial
trea'y with any other American state."
He Fay of thia:
"Tha Monroe doctrine ahoald be tho

Here is a book full of the real thing,

thing.
The models bere every one a com

the compiler to show what be would
say If be should happened to be called
on for a class poem, or an ivy song, a
valedictory, or an oration, a response
to a toast, an essay, a recitation, or
whatrnot Not at all! But every one
of these "efforts" In this book Is real
In the sense that it Is what someone
did do on the particular occasion when
he actually had to stand up and speak.
This entitles them to be designated
models in a genuine sense.
If you are called upon, for any oc
casion (no matter what) during your
whole high school or college career,
and wish a model to show how some
one else had risen to a similar oppor

by a glance at this list ot commence

Besides the above tbey publish also
