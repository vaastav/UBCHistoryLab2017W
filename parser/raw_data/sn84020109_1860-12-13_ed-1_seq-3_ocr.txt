Lea ven woiTB, Dec. ll.
We have information from the scene
of the late troubles. The troops from
Ft. Leavenworth had moved to Mound
City, there joining a force of ISO men
from Ft. Riley. Attempts were made to
arrest Samison, but neither he nor Moot-
gomery could be found. The rumors that.
Montgomery 13 prepared to resist, itc,
are simply absurd. The inhabitants of
Mound City and vicinity were much ex
cited, fearing harsh treatment frcm the
federal authorities.
Washington, Dec. 11.
House. Mr. Cobb.of Alabame, ex
pressed an anxious desire that the select
committee should commence their busi
ness and present their deliberations in
some tangible form. If anything was to
be done to save his state, it must be done
at once. The election of delegates to the
state convention takes place on the 29ih
inst, and the convention meets on the 7th
of January. Alabama would not remain
in the confederacy longer than thd 15th
of January unless something was speedi
ly done. He was not a secessionist. He
desired peace.
Mr. Davis of Mississippi briefly gave
his reason why he should serve on the
committee. He might be blamed or cen
sured, but whenever his conscience ap
proved, he defied the opinion of the
world.
The House voted and refused to ex
cuse Mr. Hawkins by 9 against 101.
Mr. Hawkins, lest silence would be
construed into consent, wished to say,
with all deference md good feeling, that
he would not serve on the committee.
Mr. Boyce asked to be excused from
service on the committee.

Mr. Buchanan has tendered the office
of Secretary of the Treasury to Guthrie,
who has accepted by telegraph. Tha
authority for this is reliable The busi
ness of the Treasury was entirely sus
pended to-day, the President not having

tant, to fill the office as in such cases here

signigcent.
