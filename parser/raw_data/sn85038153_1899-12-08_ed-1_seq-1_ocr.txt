Washington, Dec. 5. The annual
message of President McKinley was
Bent to congress at noon. It is an ex
haustive document, containing about
23,000 words, and is the longest execu
tive Instrument in the history or the
government An intelligent synopsis
follows:
To the Senate and Houro of Representatives:
At the threshold of your deliberations
you are called to mourn with your coun
trymen the death of Vice President Ho-
bart, who passed from- this life on the
morning of November 21 last. His great
bouI now rests In eternal peace. His pri
vate life was pure and elevated, while his
public career was ever distinguished by
large capacity, stainless Integrity, and ex
alted motives. He has been removed from
the high office which he honored and dig
nified, but his lofty character, his devotion
to duty, his honesty of purpose, and noble
virtues remain with us a priceless legacy
and example.
OUTSPOKEN FOR THE GOLD STAND.
ARD.
Increased activity in industry, with Its
welcome attendant a larger employment
for labor at higher wages gives to the
body of the people a larger power to ab
sorb the circulating medium.- It is further
true that year by year, with larger areas
of land under cultivation, the increasing
volume of agricultural products, cotton,
corn and wheat, calls for a larger volume
of money supply. This is especially no
ticeable at the crop-harvesting ana crop
moving period.
In its earlier history the national pann
ing act seemed to prove a reasonable ave-
ue through which neeutui auditions to tne
circulation could from time to time be
made. Changing conditions have appar
ently rendered it now inoperative to that
end. The high margin in bond securities
required, resulting from large premiums
which government bonds command in the
market, or the tax on cote Issues, or both
operating together, appear to be the In
fluences which Impair Its public utility.
The attention of congress is respectfully
Invited to this Important matter with the
flew of ascertaining whether or not such
reasonable modifications can be made in
the national banking act as will render its
service in the particulars here referred
to more responsive to the people's needs.
again urge that national banks be au
thorized to organize with a capital of $25,
000.
I urgently recommend that to support
the existing gold standard, and to maintain
the parity in value of the coins ol the
two metals (gold and silver) and the equal
power of every dollar at all times in the
market and in the payment of debts," the
secretary of the treasury be given addi
tional power and charged with the duty to
sell United States bonds and to employ
such other effective means as may be nec
essary to these ends. The authority
should include the power to sell bonds on
long and short time, as conditions may
require, and should provide for a rate of
interest lower than that fixed by the act
of January 14, 1875. While there Is now
no commercial fright which withdraws
gold from the government, but, on the
contrary, such widespread confidence that
gold seeks the treasury demanding paper
money in exchange, yet the very situation
points to the present as the most fitting
time to make adequate provision to in
sure the continuance of the gold standard
and of public confidence in the ability and
purpose of the government to meet all its
obligations in the money which the clvi
llzed world recognizes as the best. The
financial transactions of the government
are conducted upon a gold basis. We
receive gold when we sell United States
bonds and use gold for their payment. We
are maintaining the parity of all the money
issued or coined by authority of the gov
ernment. We are doing these things with
the means at hand. Happily at the present
time we are not compelled to resort to
cans to supply gold. It has been done in
the past, however, and may have to be
done in the future. It behooves us, there
fore, to provide at once the best means to
meet the emergency when it arises, and the
best means are those which are the most
certain and economical. Those now au
thorlzed have the virtue neither of di
rectness nor economy. We have already
eliminated one of the causes of our finan
cial plight and embarrassment during th
years 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1896. Our receipt:
now equal our expenditures; deficient rev
enues no longer create alarm. Let us re
move the only remaining cause by con
ferrlng the full and necessary power on
the secretary of the treasury and impose
upon him the duty to uphold the present
gold standard and preserve the coins of
the two metals on a parity with each
other, which is the repeatedly declared pol
Icy of the United States.
In this connection I repeat my former
recommendations that a portion of the
gold holdings shall be placed in a trusl
fund from which greenbacks shall be re
deemed upon presentation, but when once
redeemed shall not thereafter be paid ou
except for gold.
After pronouncing for a gold standard
the president urges aid for the merchant
marine.
TRUSTS.
Combinations of capital organized into
trusts to control the conditions of trade
among our citizens, to stifle competition
limit production, and determine the prices
of products used and consumed by the peo
ple, are justly provoking public discussion,
and should early claim the attention of the
congress.
The Industrial commission, created by
the act of the congress of June 18, 1898,
bas been engaged in extended hearings
upon the disputed questions involved in
the subject of combinations In restraint o(
trade and competition. They have not yet
completed their investigation of this sub
ject, and the conclusions and recommen
dations at wnich they may arrive are undetermined.
The subject is one giving rise to many
divergent views as to the nature and var
iety or cause and extent of the Injuries to
the public which may result from large
combinations concentrating more or less
numerous enterprises and establishments,
which previously to the formation of the
combination were carried on separately.
It Is universally conceded that combina
tions which engross or control the market
of any particular kind of merchandise or
tommodity, by suppressing natural and or
dinary competition, whereby prices are
unduly enhanced to the general consumer
are obnoxious not only to the common law
but also to the public welfare. There must
be a remedy for the evils Involved in such
organization. If the present law can be
extended more certainly to control or
check these monopolies or trusts, it should
be done without delay. Whatever power the
congress possesses over this most import
ant subject should be promptly ascertained
and asserted.
It is apparent that uniformity of legis
lation upon this subject in the several
states is much to be desired. It is to be
hoped that such uniformity founded in a
ise and just discrimination between what
Is Injurious and what is useful and neces
sary in business operations may be ob
tained and that means may be found for
the congress within the limitations of its
constitutional power so to supplement an
effective code of state legislation as to
make a complete system of laws through
out the United States adequate to compel
general observance of the salutary rules
to which I have reterred.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
A review of our relations with foreign
states is presented with such recommen
dations as are deemed appropriate.
The long-pending boundary dispute be
tween the Argentine republic and Chile
was settled in March last by the award
of an arbitral commission, on which the
United Stat 53 minister at Buenos Ayres
served as umpire.
NICARAGUA CANAL.
The contract of the Maritime Canal com
pany, of Nicaragua, was declared forfeited
by the Nicaraguan government on the 10th
of October, on the ground of non-fulfillment
within the ten years' term stipulated
in the contract. The Maritime Canal com
pany has lodged a protest against this ac
tion, alleging rights in the premises which
appear worthy of consideration. This gov
ernment expects that Nicaragua will afford
the prote3tants a full and fair hearing upon
the merits of the case.
The Nicaragua canal commission, which
had been engaged upon the work of exam
ination and survey for a ship-canal route
across Nicaragua, having completed Its
labors and made its report, was dissolved
on May 31, and on June 10 a new com
mission, known as the- Isthmian canal
commission, was organized under the
terms of the act approved March 3, 1899,
for the purpose of examining the Ameri
can Isthmus with a view to determining
the most practicable and feasible route
for a ship canal across that Isthmus, with
its probable cost, and other essential de
tails.
The great importance of this work can
not be too often or too strongly pressed
upon the attention of the cngress. In my
message of a year ago I expressed my
views of the necessity of a canal which
would link the two great oceans, to which
again invite your consideration. The
reasons then presented for early action
are even stronger now.
The portion of the message dealing with
our foreign relations shows no especial Inci
dent. The Nicaraguan canal is nrged. Our
trade relations with China are being
watched, and a good word Is then spoken
for the Paris exposition. In speaking of
Great Britain, progress of the Alaskan
boundary Is mentioned.
NEUTRALITY IN SOUTH AFRICA.
This government has maintained an at
titude of neutrality in the unfortunate
contest between Great Britain and the
Boer states of Africa. We have remained
faithful to the precept of avoiding en
tangling alliances as to affairs not of our
direct concern. Had circumstances sug
gested that the parties to the quarrel would
have welcomed any kindly expression of
the hope of the American people that war
might be averted, good offices would have
been gladly tendered. The United States
representative at Pretoria was early in
structed to see that all neutral American
interests be respected by the combatants.
This has been an easy task in view of the
positive declarations of both British and
Boer authorities that the personal and
property rights of our citizens should be
observed.
Upon the withdrawal of the British agent
from Pretoria the United States consul
was authorized, upon the request of the
British government and with the assent
of the South African and Orange Free
State governments, to exercise the cus
tomary good offices of a neutral for the
care of British interests. In the discharge
of this function I am happy to say that
abundant opportunity, has been afforded to
show the impartiality of this government
toward both the combatants.
The lynching of Italian subjects In Lou
isiana is referred to and a satisfactory
solution Is expected. The message then
qnotes from President Harrison's message
of 1891 concerning a law to punish crimes
against treaty rights. Congress Is urged
to take op the subject anew. The ex
changes of amenities between Mexico and
this country and Japan are detailed.
SAMOA.
Important events have occurred in the
Samoan islands. The election, accord
ing to the laws and customs of Samoa,
of a successor to the late king, Malietoa
Laupepa, developed a contest as to the
validity of the result, which issue, by
the terms of the general act, was to be
decided by the chief justioe. Upon his
rendering a judgment in favor of Malie
toa Tanu, the rival chief, Mataafa, took
up arms. The active intervention of
American and British warships became
imperative to restore order, at the cost
of sanguinary encounters. In this emer
gency a joint commission of representa
tives of the United States, Germany and
Great Britain was sent to Samoa to in
vestigate the situation and to provide a
temporary remedy. By its active efforts
a peaceful solution was reached for the
time being, the kingship being ab li hed
and a provisional government establish
ed. Recommendations unanimously made
by the commission for a Permanent ad
justment of the Samoan question were
taken under consideration by the three
powers parties to the general act. But
the more they were examined the more
evident It became that a radical change
was necessary in the relations of the pow
ers to Samoa.
The arrangement under which Samoa
was administered had proved impractic
able and unacceptable to all the powers
concerned. To withdraw from the agree.
ment and abandon the islands to Germany
and Great Britain would not be compati
ble with ou t interests in the archipelago.
To relinquish our rights in the harbor
of Pago Pago, the best anchorage in the
Pacific, the occupancy of which had be
leased to the United States in 1878 by the
first foreign treaty ever concluded by Sa
moa, was not to be thought of either as
regards the needs of our navy or the in
terests of our growing commerce with the
east. Wa oould not hare considered any
proposition for the abrogation of the tri
partite control which did not confirm us in
ail our rights and safeguard all our na
tional rights in the Islands.
Our views commended themselves to the
other powers. A satisfactory arrange
ment was concluded between the gov
ernments of Germany and of England, by
virtue of which England retired from
Samoa in view of compensations in other
directions, and both powers renounced in
favor of the United States all their rights
and claims over and in respect to that por
tion of the ;roip lying to the east of the
ne hundred an! seventyflrst degree of west
longitude, embracing the islands of Tutuila,
Ofoo, Olosenga.. and Manua. I transmit to
the senate, for its constitutional action
thereon, a convention, which besides the
provisions above mentioned also guaran
tees us the same privileges and conditions
in resnect to commerce and commercial
vessels in all of the Islands of Samoa as
those possessed by Germany.
THE PLEDGE TO CUBA.
My annual message of last year
was necessarily flevotea, in a great
part, to the consideration of the
Spanish war and of the results It wrought
and the conditions it imposed for the fu
ture. I am gratified to announce that the
treaty of peace has restored friendly rela
tions between the two powers. Effect has
been given to its most important provis
ions. The evacuation of Porto Rico hav
ing already been accomplished on the 18th
of October, 1898, nothing remained necessa
ry there but to continue the provisional
military control of the island until the
congress should enact a suitable govern
ment for the ceded territory. Of the char
acter and scope of the measure to that end
shall treat in another part of this mes
sage.
The withdrawal of the authority of
Spain from the island of Cuba was ef
fected by the 1st of January, so that the
full re-establishment of peace found the
relinquished territory held by us in trust
for the inhabitants, maintaining under the
direction of the executive, such govern
ment and control therein as should conserve
public order, restore the productive condi
tions of peace so long disturbed by the in
stability and disorder which prevailed for
the greater part of the preceding three de
cades, and build up that tranquil develop
ment of the domestic state whereby alone
can be realized the high purpose, as pro
claimed in the joint resolution adopted by
congress on the 19th of April, 1898, by
which the United States disclaimed any dis
position or intention to exercise sovereign
ty, Jurisdiction, or control over Cuba, ex
cept for the pacification thereof, and as
serted its determination when that was ac
complished to leave the government and
control of the island to its people. The
pledge contained in this resolution is of the
highest honorable obligation and must be
sacredly kept.
I believe that substantial progress has
been made in this direction. All the ad
ministrative measures adopted in Cuba
have aimed to fit it for a regenerated ex
istence by enforcing the supremacy of
law and justice; by placing wherever prac
ticable the machinery of administration in
the hands of the inhabitants; by institut
ing needed sanitary reforms; by spreading
education; by fostering industry and
trade; by inculcating public morality, and.
In short, by taking every rational step to
aid the Cuban people to attain to that plane
of self-conscious respect and self-reliant
unity which fits an enlightened community
for self-government within its own
sphere, while enabling it to fulfill all out
ward obligations.
After the Cuban question, the message
speaks of the resumption of diplomatic re
lations with Spain. In speaking of Turkey,
the president says the situation of
our citizens remains unsatisfactory. The
South American countries are then dis
cussed, the settlement of the Venezuelan
boundary question and the revolution in
Venezuela being mentioned. The Industrial
expositions at Philadelphia and Buffalo are
noticed.
INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.
In response to the Invitation of his
majesty, the emperor of Russia, delegates
from twentysix countries were assembled
at The Hague on the 18th of May, as mem
bers of a conference in the interest of peace.
The commission from the United States
consisted of the Hon. Andrew D. White, the
Hon. Seth Low, the Hon, Stanford Newel,
Captain Alfred T. Mahan, of the United
States navy. Captain William Crozier, of
the United States army, and the Hon.
Frederick W. Holls, secretary. The occa
sion seemed to be opportune for the serious
consideration of a plan for the pacific
adjustment of international differences, a
subject in which the American people have
been deeply interested for many years, and
a definite project for a permanent inter
national tribunal was included in the in
structions to the delegates of the United
States.
The final act of the conference includes
conventions upon the amelioration of the
laws and customs of war on land, the
adaptation to maritime warfare of the
principles of the Geneva convention of
1864, and the extension of judicial meth
ods to international cases. The Conven
tion for the Pacific Settlement of Interna
tional conflicts embodies the leading fea
tures of the American plan, with such
modifications as were rendered necessary
by the great diversity of views and inter
ests represented by the delegates. The
four titles of the . convention provide for
the maintenance of general peace, the ex
ercise of good offices and mediation, the
formation of commissions of Inquiry, and
international arbitration.
THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT.
Since my last annual message, and in
obedience to the acts of congress of April
and 26, 1898, the remaining volunteer
force enlisted for the Spanish war, consist
ing of 34,834 regulars and 110,202 volun
teers, with over 6000 volunteer officers, has
been discharged from the military service.
Of the volunteers, 667 officers and 14,831
men were serving in the Philippines, and
1650 of the regulars, who were entitled to
be mustered out after the ratification of
the treaty of peace. They voluntarily re
mained at the front until their places
could be filled by new troops. They were
returned home in the order In which they
went to Manila, and are now all of them
out of the service and in the ranks of
citizenship. I recommend that the con
gress provide a special medal of honor for
the volunteers, regulars, sailors and
rines on duty in the Philippines who vol
untarily remained in the service after
their terms of enlistment had expired.
By the act of March 2, 1899, congress
gave authority to increase the regular ar
my to a maximum not exceeding 65,000 cn
listed men, and to en'i' a fores of 35,000
volunteers, to be recr : . 1 from the coun
try at large. By vi-tu' of this authority
the regular army has been increased to
the number of 61,999 enlisted men and
2248 officers, and new volunteer regiments
have been organized aggregating 33.050 en
listed men and 1524 officers. Two of these
volunteer regiments are made up of col
ored men, with colored line officers. The
new troops to take the places of those re
turning from the Philippines have been
transported to Manila to the number of
581 officers and 26,322 enlisted men of the
regular army and 594 officers and 15,388
enlisted men of the new volunteer force,
while 504 officers and 14,119 men of the
volunteer force are on the ocean en route
to Manila.
The force a . in Manila consists of 905
officers and 30,57 regulars, and 694 officers
and 15..3S8 of the volunteers, making au
eggregate of 149 officers and 45,966 men.
When the troops now under orders
shall reach Manila the force In the ar
chipelago will comprise 2051 officers and
63,483 men. The muster out of the great
volunteer army organized for the Spanish
wr and the rieatiou of a new army, the
transportation from Manila to San Fran
cisco of those entitled to discharge, and
the transportation of the new troops to take
Vheir places have been a work of great mag
nitude well and ably done for which too
much credit can not be given the war de
partment.
The insular mall service Is next treated,
showing how It has been Improved by
United States postal authorities. The navy
Is praised.
PATENTS.
Our future progress and prosperity de
pend upon our ability to equal, if not sur
pass, other nations in the enlargement and
advance of science, industry and commerce.
To invention we must turn as one of the
most powerful aids to the accomplishments
of such a result. The attention of the con
gress is directed to the report of the com
missioner of patents, in which will be
found valuable suggestions and recom
mendations. PENSIONS.
On the 30th of June, 1899, the pension
roll of the United States numbered 991,
519. These Include the pensioners of the
army and navy in all our wars. The num
ber added to the rolls during the year was
40,991. The number dropped by reason of
death, remarriage, minors by legal limi
tation, failure to claim within three years,
and other causes, was 43,186, and the num
ber of claims disallowed was 107,919. Dur
ng the year 89,054 pension certificates were
Issued, of which 37,077 were for new or
original pensions. The amount disbursed
for army and navy pensions during the
year was $138,355,052.95, which was $1,651,
461.61 less than the sum of the appropria
tions. The Grand Army of the Republic at Its
recent national encampment held in Phil
adelphia has brought to my attention and
to that of the congress the wisdom and
Justice of a modification of the third sec
tion of the act of June 27, 1890, which pro
vides pensions for the widows of officers i
and enlisted men who served ninety days
or more during the war of the rebellion
and were honorably discharged, provided
that such widows are without other means
of support than their daily labor and were
married to the soldier, sailor or marine on
account of whose service they claim pen
sion prior to the date of the act.
The present holding of the department
is that if the widow's income aside from
her daily labor does not exceed in amount
what her pension would be, towit, 96 per
annum, she would be deemed to be without
other means of support than her daily la
bor, and would be entitled to a pension
nnder this act; while if the widow's in
come Independent of the amount received
by her as the result of her daily labor
exceeds $96, she would not be pensionable
under the act. I am advised by the com
missioner of pensions that the amount of
the income allowed before title to pension
would be barred has varied widely undei
different administrations of the pension
office, as well as during different periods
of the same administration, and has been
the cause of just complaint and criticism.
With the approval of the secretary of
the interior the commissioner of pensions
recommends that, in order to make the
practice at all times uniform and to do
justice to the dependent widow, the
amount of income allowed independent of
the proceeds of her daily labor should not
be less than $250 per annum, and he urges
that the congress shall so amend the
act as to permit the pension office to grant
pensionable status to widows under the
terms of the third section of the act of
June 27, 1890, whose Income aside from
the proceeds of daily labor is not in ex
cess of $250 per annum. I believe this to
be a simple act of justice and heartily
recommend it.
The next census, Pacific railways, pres
ervation of forests and the agricultural In
terests of the country are discussed, and
then the president deals with the Philip
pine question. He reviews the ceding of
the islands to the United States by Spain
and says that no opportunity was lost to
assure the people of the islands of our de
sire for their welfare. Events are re
viewed which led up to an outbreak, quo
tations being made from the report of the
Philippine commission.
THE PHILIPPINES.
The unfavorable circumstances connect
ed with an active campaign have not been
permitted to interfere with the equally
Important work of reconstruction. Again I
invite your attention to the report of the
commissioners for the interesting and en
couraging details of the work already ac
complished In the establishment of peace
and order and the inauguration of self-governing
municipal life in many portions of
the archipelago. A notable beginning has
been made in the establishment of a gov
ernment in the island of Negros, which
is deserving of special consideration. This
was the first island to accept American
sovereignty. Its people unreservedly pro
claimed allegiance to the United States
and adopted a constitution looking to the
establishment of a popular government.
It was impossible to guarantee to the
people of Negros that the con
stitution so adopted should be the ulti
mate form of government. Such a ques
tion, under the treaty with Spain and in
accordance with our own constitution and
laws, came exclusively within the juris
diction of the congress.. .The government
actually set up by the inhabitants of Ne
gros eventually proved unsatisfactory to
the natives themselves. A new system
was put into force by order of the major
general commanding the department, of
which the following are the most impor
tant elements:
It was ordered that the government of
the island of Negros should consist of
military governor appointed by the United
States military governor of the Philip
pines, and a civil governor and an advisory
council elected by the people. The mili
tary governor was authorized to appoint
secretaries of the treasury, interior, agri
culture, public instruction, an attorney
general, and an auditor. The seat of gov
ernment was fixed at Bacolod. The mili
tary governor exercises the supreme ex
ecutive power. He is to. see that the laws
are executed, appoint to office, and fill all
vacancies in office not otherwise provided
for, and may, with the approval of the
military governor of the Philippines, re
move any officer from office. The civil
governor advises the military governor on
all public civil questions and presides over
the advisory council. He, in general, per
forms the duties which are performed by
secretaries of state in our own system of
government.
The advisory council consists of eight
members elected by the people within ter-
ritorial limits which are defined in the or
I der of the commanding general.
The timer and places of holding elec
tions are to fixed by the military gov
ernor of the island of Negros. The qual
ifications of voters are as follows:
(1) A voter must be a male citizen of
the island of Negros. (2) Of the age of
21 years. (3) He shall be able to speak,
read, and write the English, Spanish, or
Visayan language, or he must own real
property worth $500, or pay a rental on
real property of the value of 1000. (4)
He must have resided in the island not
less than one year preceding, and in the
district in which he offers to register as
voter not less than three months Im
mediately preceding the time he offers to
register. (5) he must register at a time
fixed by law before voting. (6) Prior to
such registration he shall have paid all
taxes due by him to the government. Pro
vided, that no Insane person shall be al
lowed to register or vote.
The military governor has the right to
veto all bills or resolutions adopted by
Ihe advisory council, and his veto is final
if not disapproved by the military gover
nor of the Philippines.
The advisory council discharges all the
ordinary duties of a legislature. The usual
duties pertaining to said offices are to be
performed by the secretaries of the treas
ury, interior, agriculture, public instruc
tion, the attorney general, and the audi
tor. The Judicial power is vested in three
Judges, who are to be appointed by the
military governor of the island. Inferior
courts are to be established.
Free public schools are to be established
throughout the populous districts of the
island, in which the English language
shall be taught, and this subject will re
ceive the careful consideration of the ad
visory council.
The burden of the government must be
distributed equally and equitably among
the people. The military authorities will
collect and receive the customs revenue,
and will control postal matters and Phil
ippine inter-island trade and commerce.
The military governor, subject to the
approval of the military governor of the
Philippines, determines all questions not
specifically provided for and which do not
come under the jurisdiction of the ad
visory council.
THE SULTAN OF SULU.
The authorities of the Sulu islands have
accepted the succession of the United
states to tne rignts or spam, and our
flag floats over that territory. On the 10th
of August, 1899, Brigadier General J. C.
Bates, United States volunteers, negotiated
an agreement with the sultan and his
principal chiefs, which I transmit here
with. By Article I the sovereignty of the
United States over the whole archipelago
of Jolo and its dependencies is declared
and acknowledged.
The United States flag will be used in
the archipelago and its dependencies, on
land and sea. Piracy is to be suppressed,
and the sultan agrees to co-operate hearti
ly with the United States authorities to
that end, and to make every possible ef
fort to arrest and bring to justice all per
sons engaged in piracy. All trade in do
mestic products of the archipelago of Jolo
when carried on with any part of the
Philippines islands and under the Ameri
can flag shall befree, unlimited and undu-
tlable. The United States will, give full
protection to the sultan in case any for
eign nation should attempt to impose upon
him. rne united states will not sell the
island of Jolo or any other island of the
Jolo archipelago any foreign nation with
out the consent of the sultan. Salaries
for the sultan and his associates in the
administration of the islands have been
agreed upon to the amount of $760
monthly.
Article X provides that any slave in the
archipelago of Jolo shall have the right to
purchase freedom by paying to the mas
ter the usual market value. The
agreement by General Bates was made
subject to confirmation by the president
and to future modifications by the consent
ef the parties in interest I have con
firmed said agreement, subject to the ac
tion of the congress, and with the reser
vation, which I have directed shall be
communicated to the Sultan of Jolo, that
this agreement is not to be deemed in any
way to authorize or give the consent of the
United States to the existence of slavery
In the Sulu archipelago. I communicate
these facts to the congress for its informa
tion and action.
OPPOSES A PROTECTORATE.
Everything Indicates that with the
speedy suppression of the Tagalo rebellion
life in the archipelago will soon resume its
ordinary course under the protection of our
sovereignty, and the people of those favored
islands will enjoy a prosperity and a free
dom which they have never before known
Already hundreds of schools are open and
filled with children. Religious freedom is
sacredly assured and enjoyed. The courts
are dispensing Justice. Business is begin
ning to circulate In its' accustomed chan
nels, Manila, whose inhabitants were flee
ing to the country a few months ago, is now
a populous and thriving mart of com
merce. The earnest and unremitting en
deavors of the commission and the admiral
and major general commanding the depart
ment of the Pacific to assure the people of
the beneficent intentions of this govern
ment have had their legitimate effect in
convincing, the great mass of them that
peaco and safety and prosperity and stable
government can only be found in a loyal
acceptance of the authority of the United
States.
The future government of the Philippines
rests with the congress of the United
States. Few graver responsibilities have
ever been confided to us. If we, accept them
in a spirit worthy of our race and cur
traditions, a great opportunity comes with
them. The islands lie under the shelter
of our flag. They are ours by every titl
of law and equity. They can not be aban
doned. If we desert them we leave them
it once to anarchy and finally to barba
risrn. We Sing them, a golden apple of dis
cord, among the rival powers, ns one
which could permit another to seize them
unquestioned. Their rich plains and valleys
would be the scene of endless strife an
bloodshed. The advent of Dewey's fleet in
Manila bay instead of being, as we hope,
the dawn of a new day of freedom and pro
gress, will have been the beginning of an
era of misery and violence worse than any
which "has darkened their unhappy past.
The suggestion has been made that w
could renounce our authority over the is
lands and, giving them independence, could
retain a protectorate over them. This prop
osition will not be f .und, I am sure, wor
thy of your serious attention. Such an
arrangement would involve at the outset
a cruel breach of faith. It would place the
peaceable and loyal majority, who ask
nothing better than to accept our authority,
at the mercy of the minority of armed In
surgents. It would make us responsible
tor the acts of the insurgent leaders and
give us no power to control them.
would charge us with the task of protectin
them against each other and defendin:
them against any foreign power with
which they chose to quarrel. In short
would take from the congress of the Uni
ted States the power of declaring war and
vest that tremendous prerogative in the
Tagal leader of the hour.
FUTURE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT
It does not seem desirable that I should
recommend at this time a specific and final
form of government for these island;
When peace shall be restored It will be the
duty of congress to construct a plan
government which shall e.-tablish and
maintain freedom and order and peace in
the Philippines. The insurrection is sti
existing and when it terminates further in
formation will be required as to the actual
condition of affairs before inaugurating
permanent scheme of civil government.
The full report of the commission, now in
KMnflnitlnn will p.-n t a i n i r, f i : a ( .in antt
suggestions which will be of value to con
gress, and which I will transmit as soon
it Is completed. As long as the In
surrection continues the military arm
must necessarily be supreme. But there Is
no reason why steps should not be taken
from time to time to Inaugurate govern
ments essentially popular in their form as
fast as territory is held and controlled by
our troops. To this end I am considering
the advisability of the return of the com
mission, of such of the members thereof as
can be secured, to aid the existing authori
ties and facilitate this work throughout the
islands. I have believed that reconstruction
should not begin by the establishment of
one central civil government for all the
Islands, with Its seat In Manila, but rather
that the work should be commenced by
building up from the bottom, first estab-
shing municipal governments and then
provincial governments, and central gov
ernment at last to follow.
Until congress shall have made known
the formal expression of its will I shall
use the authority vested in me by the
constitution and the statutes to uphold the
sovereignty of the United States in those
istant islands as In all other places where -
our flag rightfully floats. I shall put at
the disposal of the army and navy all the
means which the liberality of congress and
the people have provided to cause this un-.
provoked and wasteful Insurrection to
cease. If any orders ol mine were re
quired to insure the merciful conduct of
military and naval operations, they would
not be lacking; but every step of the pro
gress of our troops has been marked by a
humanity which has surprised even
the misguided Insurgents. The
truest kindness to them will be a swift and
effective defeat of their present leader.
The hour of victory will be the hour of
clemency and reconstruction.
No effort will be spared to build op the
waste places desolated by war and by long
years of misgovernment. We shall not
wait for the end of strife to begin the
beneficent work. We shall continue, aa
we have begun, to open the schools and
the churches. to set the courts in operation.
to foster industry and trade and agricul
ture, and in every way in our power to
make these people whom Providence has
brought within our Jurisdiction feel that
it is their liberty and not our power, their
welfare and not our gain, we are seeking
to enhance. Our flag has never waved
over any community but in blessing. I be
lieve the Filipinos will soon recognize the
fact that it has not lost its gift of bene
diction in its world-wide journey to their
shores.
" PROBLEMS IN HAWAII.
Some embarrassment In administration
has occurred by reason of the peculiar
status which the Hawaiian islands at
present occupy under the joint resolution
of annexation approved July 7. 1898. While
by that resolution the republic of Hawaii
as an independent nation was extinguish
ed, its separate sovereignty destroyed, and
its property and possessions vested in the
United States, yet a complete establish
ment for its government under our sys
tem was not effected. While the munici
pal laws of the islands not enacted for
the fulfillment of treaties and not incon
sistent with the joint resolution or con
trary to the constitution of the United
States or any of its treaties remain In
force, yet these laws relate only to the
social and internal affairs of the islands,
and do not touch many subjects of Impor
tance which are of a broader national
character. ' For example, the Hawaiian re
public was divested of all title of the pub
lic lands in the Islands, and is not only
unable to dispose of lands to settlers desir
ing to take up homestead sites, but Is
without power to give complete title In
cases where lands have been entered upon
under lease or other conditions which car
ry with them the right to the purchaser.
lessee, or settler to have a full title grant
ed to him upon compliance with the con
ditions prescribed by law or by his partic
ular agreement of entry.
ALASKA.
A necessity for immediate legislative re
lief exists in the territory of Alaska,
Substantially the only law providing a
civil government for this territory Is the
act of May 17, 1884. This is meager in its
provisions, and is fitted only for the ad
ministration of affairs in a country sparse
ly inhabited by civilized people and unim
portant in trade and production, as was
Alaska at the time this act was pass
ed. The Increase In population by Immi
gration during the past few years, conse
quent upon the discovery of gold, has pro
duced such a condition as calls for more
ample facilities for local self-government
and more numerous conveniences of civil
and judicial administration. Settlements
have grown up in various places, consti
tuting in point of population and business'
cities of thousands of inhabitants, yet
there is no provision of law under which
a municipality can be organized or main
tained. FREE TRADE WITH PORTO RICO.
I recommend that legislation to the same
end be had with reference to the govern
ment of Porto Rico. -The time Is ripe for
the adoption of a temporary form of gov-
ercment for this island, and many sugges
tions made with reference to Alaska are
applicable also to Porto Rico.
LYNCHINGS. j
The love of law and the sense of obe
dience and submission to the lawfully
constituted judicial tribunals are embed
ded In the hearts of our people, and any
violation of these sentiments and disre
gard of their obligations justly arouses
public condemnation. The guaranties of
life, liberty, and of civil rights should be
faithfully upheld; the right of trial by
Jury respected and defended. The rule of
the courts should assure the public of the
prompt trial of those charged with crim
inal offenses, and upon conviction the pun
ishment should be commensurate with the
enormity of the crime.
The proposed centennial celebration at
Washington next year Is given a boom. In
regard to the civil service the president
says the modifications show the publio
jervlce has been Improved and the perma-
(ency of the merit system insured. The
president refers to the one hundredth an
niversary of the death of Washington,
which will be Dec 14. For a hundred
years the republic has had the priceless
advantage of the lofty standard of char
acter and conduct which he bequeathed to
the American people. I have been glad to
learn that in many parts of this country
the people will fitly observe this hlstorlo
inniversary.
CONCLUSION.
Presented to this congress are great op
portunities. With them come great respon
sibilities. The power confided to us In
creases the weight of our obligations to
the people, and we must be profoundly
tensible of them as we contemplate the
new and grave problems which confront
us. Aiming only at the public good, we
cannot err. A right Interpretation of the
people's will and of duty cannot fall to
Insure wise measures for the welfare of
'.he islands which have come under the
luthority of the United States, and Inure
to the common interest and lasting honor
f our country. Never has this nation had
more abundant cause than during the past
rear for thankfulness to God for manifold
blessing and mercies, for which we make
reverent acknowledgment,
