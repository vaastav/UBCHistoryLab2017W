1 lis ThlDE. A careful survey of
our paper will bring to the admiring
eyes of our readers a little advertise
ment of Herahiser & Myera. It occu
pies a little corner of the local page.
These gentlemen are liberal dealers
and they keep an endless assortment
of goods in their iine. Although uuch
is mentioned iu their advsrtiseiaent,
not one-half is told. The balance can
be seen at their Corner Drug Store.
The heavy wind of Monday after
coon did some damage along the rail
road. The cover of the bridge at Ken
ton wai blown otT, a freight car at
Carey was driven some distance and
thrown off the track, and a car at this
place was served in the same way.
At the depot here the wind earned a
board against the telegraph wire where
it enters the office, and the wire jerk
ed down the clock and It was smashed
to "Cinders."
ijTlcflltnre. We would like to de
vote a portion of our paper to agricul
ture. This we can do easily enough
'.by cutting from other papers long,
theoretical articles on the subject; but
it would amount to nothing. What
we want is ehort practical articles
trom onr own farmers. This would
be of utility, enabling oar farming
community to interchange ideas on
farming andiearn from each other the
best and most practical manner of
raising all kinds of crops, ; stockj etc.
- Who will try their hand at this.-:
Tie net profit of the Alumnal sup
per, last Friday night amounted to
$58 00, which was doing very well1
. we think. The entertainment was
one of the pleasantest ever held in
the city, doing credit to its managers.
The voting of a pair of slippers to the
most popular oacneior in l ima re
sulted as follows: Harry Cromwell
80, Thos. B. Tomb 25 ; L L. St John
S3 ; Jaa. Ralsinger 11 ; Chas. More
house 6 : Francis Le Baron 4; and
others ranging from 1 vote to 3.
Postponed. The St Marys Church
have postponed their Fair for an Indef
inite time. The committee inform
ns that they had fully Intended hold
ing a fair and had made arrangements
therefore, but that not to interfere with
the fairs of the Firemen they had de
eided to withdraw. We think this
the best way to arrange the matter.
This Church can hold a fair in the
future when there is no opposition
the field and receive the patronage
all the people. '
Stack Fair. As will be seen by ref
erence to the report of the Agricultu
ral Society Meeting, the Board
Managers of the Society have decided
to hold a Stock Fair in the spring.
In premiums we learn that about
$5,000 wCl bo given, wniie arrange
. taenta will be made to have a liberally
ranged premium list, good arrange
ments and a fair that we can be proud
of. Other societies in the State have
held such fairs, and have not only
found them profitable to themselves,
but also of great use in encouraging
farmers in improving their stock.
' T7e hope all will look upon this Stock
Fair In it- true light, and lend a help
&3 tzi to m&klcg it a aceeess.

cf
of
Taken Jo and Done For. a young
fellow named Jones, of Oberlin, on
his way to Xenia, was confidenced in
the following manner, Wednesday
last Tuesday morning he came to
Clyde bn the 1 o'clock train and stop
ped over. He fell in with a lot of
fellows, who got him into a saloon
and tried to get him to throwing dice,
etc. This be refused to do. but drank
with them several times. At one
time he complained of being sick, and
one of the parties prescribed for him,
and drugged him, as he afterward as
certained. He got on the morning
train, eoire south, at Clyde, and had
been seated but a moment when
fellow claiming to be a detective came
up to him and told him he must con
sider himself under arrest for passing
counterfeit money, and demanded all
the money he had. Jones said he had
no counterfeit money, but was order
ed to give it up, and told that they
were obliged to report at Tiffin to
chief detective, and that they would
goto a bank and ascertain if the
money was good. When they reach
ed this city, they went to the First
National Bask and the money, $83,
was pronounced good, The sham de
tective took poor Jonee out and told
him to wait a moment while he went
to the office of the chief detective.and
the matter would be fixed up all right
Jones waited, but the detective did
not return nor the money either.
Jones got out a warrant, but the fel
low could not be found.
Jones is thus badly sold. The drug
he bad taken made him so dazed that
he could not give a good description
of the man, but he is supposed to be
one of a Fremont band of robbers who
work east and west from that place.
To Melmore. On Sunday last
number of the Masonic Fraternity
this city went to Melmore to attend
the funeral of Mr. II. M. Becker. On
arriving at that place they went
the lodge room of the Masons, and
with ita members adjourned
the Church. Rev. Mr. Collier of this
city delivered an able discourse from
the words "In the sweat cf thy face
shalt thou eat bread, till thou return
unto the ground; for out of it wast
thou taken; for dust thou art, and
dust shalt thou return." The sermon
was llrtened to with intense interest
by an audience that filled the church
to its utmost capacity. This was one
of the largest funerals ever held
that place and evidenced the estima
tion in which the deceased was held.
The visiting masons, after partak
ing of a good dinner at the American
House started for home.

1 Talaable Work. Our citizens
will now have an opportunity of ob
taining one of the most valuable looks
that has been introduced in this place.
It is Dr. Kitto's Illustrated History of
the Bible, The ageut, Mr. C. M. Gal
lup, Jr., called on us, and we have
given our name- for a copy, and think
that few intelligent readers will be
able to resist the temptation to pur
chase so good a book. It is made ex
ceedingly attractive by about 300 illustrations,
many of them full-page engravings
by Gustave Dore, the most
eminent of living artists. The author
s a most celebrated biblical scholar,
who spent three years in Palestine
gathering material for this great
work. It is a royal octavo volume
750 pages, gotten up in the first style,
and made exceedingly attractive
well as valuable. It is confidently
commended as a book for the family
circle, and especially for those engaged
in the work of christian instruction.
It is meeting with wonderful success
wherever introduced. Over 200,000
copies have been sold already and the'
sale is constantly increasing.
An Interesting Crowd. At about
five P. M. Sunday last, "might have
been seen" some dozen persons slowly
and wearily coming in, in squads
three or four from Melmore. How
came "that this was thus" is follows:
These gentlemen went to Melmore
the band wagon. On their return,
when about one-fourth of a mile from
Melmore, the forward axletree of the
wagon broke and the gentlemen found
that they were in for a walk. There
upon Messrs, G. K. Brown, B. Atkins,
J. H. Frost, N. M. Barnes, P. Schieb,
E. White. J. P. Parks, Chas. Sours,
4c., shouldered blankets, coats and
shawls and like so many ' Weston
"lit out" for Tiffin. A more tired com
pany never reached home than this,
and they voted it at least forty miles
to Melmore.
We can imagine their feelings.

FIRE DEPARTMENT FAIR.
(
I
j
As the question has been often ask-
- .1 Ai.t. Af imnMrnDntl rift
you propone having at your Fire De-
partment Fair," allow me, througn
the columns of the Tribcne, to ex
plain jut what our arrangements are,
In the first place we have decided to
hold a fair, under the auspices of the
Tiffin Fire Department, the proceeds
of which are to be placed in the treas-
ury of the different companies consti
tuting said Department and thereby
avoiding, to a great extent, the drain
upon the City Treasury for keepii.g
up the incidental expenses of the dif
ferent compauies of the city. No tax
payer can fail to see the advantage in
this to himself and the city at large.
We have made arrangements with
our business men here to furniah us
with all the goods we may want.from
the smallest toy to a house and lot.
Persons in need of holiday present
will do well to give us a call. On Fri
day and Saturday before Christmas
we expect to be open to dispose of our
goods, some by lottery, some by auc
tion, and some by retail, giving all an
opportunity to get their presents.
The indispensable pop corn and candy
man will be on hand, during the fair,
with an endless supply. The halls
will be gaily decorated for the occa
sion, and everything will be done to
make it pleasant and agreeable for
those who may favor us with their
presence. We say to all, come and
ft i T- 1
see as. lioos- silver uornei naiiu ua
been secured for the occasion. The
committee on amusements propose to
make it lively on the stage. Don't
forget the place at City Hall, com
mencing December 23, 1870.
Ponltry. S. 8. Smoyer hands us the
following, from the "ew ork Pro
duce Market," relative to poultry and
the prospects:
The fears expressed in our last In
relation to dressed poultry have been
far more than realized. The stocs:
that arrived for Thanksgiving was
not all sold; a heavy stock was car
ried over, and a very heavy delaved
stock came in on top of it The
weather turned warm, too, and has so
continued. The result has been the
worst 'Sticker" we have had for sev
eral years. For two or three days
past receivers have been turning out
stock at any price the buyers would
offer. It is almost impossible to rep
resent the market in our quotations.
For stock that has been carried a few
davs or arrives soft the price is mere
ly nominal. The sanitary police have
taken many lots as unfit for food.
Fresh, bright and handsome chickens
have some demand for our best retail
trade: this is about the only kind the
seller attempt to hold with any firm
ness. AH appearances indicate that
the stock of poultry in the country is
very heavy and that low prices must
rule this season. Live turkeys and
chickens are very flat and heavy.
Live ducks and geese have a light in

The Butter Market. Tho following
remarks are from the Producer's Price
Current :
The great difficulty is that we have
so small an outlet for the medium and
common grades. All buyers, whether
from the1 East, South or local marKets,
want fine, and tine only, of State.
The second and third trades, as well
as iota for baking purposes, can be
had from the stock of Western. The
fact is, prices of butter have been and
are relatively high, and must come
down as all other thimrs come down
The sooner all parties realize this fact
the better it will be. Fresh Western
is in fair request, but favoring the
buver. Medium and low grades are
verv dull and unsalable. There is
Considerable stock here that is butter
only in name, it is really grease and
must be sold at greaee prices. The
very favorable fall season and the ear
ly stoppage of the cheese factories baa
increased the prospective supply
nne outier, wuue mat, ui vue w
erodes waa already too larsre. and the
consequence is a steadily declining
market amounting this week
le.(2,2a on tine, and 2c.&5c. on com
mon and medium grades. We reduce
ourouotafion this week for all grades.
but there is iio certainty that these
prices can be obtained.
