The Hoy Mayor's Latest Awakening-
Major McCaskrin came out of his
.-paMn. a last night's session of the
common council, long enough to make
sin:e admirable suggestions to the
aUlermanie assembly, which, had he
heretofore deiorted himself in a man
lier worthy of the respect of the 1 g-i-liitive
branch of the city government,
"onld have been apt to receive the at
tention they really deserve.
While hardly compatible with the
major's avowed policy of putting the
town to t lie bad and growing moss iu
i he streets, the recommendations are for
the inot part in line with what The Ar
gus hiis been urging for years. These are
i lie things that the mayor recommend
ed, in the form of a message in lit ll of
the expected document treating of his
Sunda closing crusade: An adequate
tire alarm system; a safe, up-to-date
hook and ladder wagon: a tire engine;
action relative to Koek Island arsenal;
a building commission: a stone pile;
the establishment of police and lire
commissions beyond the reach uf pol
itics, and declaring the counsel for
the city had blundered in the storm
drain case in taking advantage of the
exemption law in the premises.
In all the legitimate recommenda
tions of the major as to the fire alarm,
lnx'k and ladder wagon, lire engine,
i he building, police and fire commis
sions, the major covers ground that
should have been included in his in
augural message, and in each of the
named propositions he is correct to the
lett r. Had he at the very outset of his ca
reer set forth public needs and stood by
them witli an intelligence and con
sistency that would have won the r
siet and cooperation of the council,
instead of Hying about from one thing
10 another, he would have been nearer
the ideal that he promised the people
in the event of his election.
Tlie mayor's recomniendat ion which t he
council adopted looking to cooperative
action in view of the situation at Kock
Island arsenal, and sustaining the atti
tude of the Tri-City Press club, is of
course timely. The stone pile sugges
tion is hardly so important as any of
the others, while the declaration per
taming to the storm drain involves a
juestiou of prudence entirely. The
city employed counsel to defend the
city's interests in the long pending lit
igation, and their acts are a matter of
law and expediency. The lawyer is
as a rule eugaged iu much the same
spirit as the physician, is. for his expen
knowledge aud his caiability to cope
with such exigencies as may arise.
anil exhaustive manner in which the
president treats of every topic and de
tail, and there is evidence of the vigor
characteristic of the man. he is per
haps more conservative in some re
spects than he has been heretofore.
At the very outset he takes up the
subjects that are paramount in the
public mind the trusts and railway
rate legislation. As a curative expedi
ent, as far as rtie former is concerned.
he suggests federal supervision. The
question of railway rate legislation foe
handles with extreme caution, but pro
poses an administrative body with
lower to regulate evil charges. Hia
stand on federal supervision of trusts
is commendatory in the highest sense,
but whether or not his plan of railway
rate legislation is not simply in line
with the interstate commerce commis
sion, is to be developed.
Various other topics of which the pres
ident treats are labor, the revision of
revenues. The Hague conference. San
to Domingo, naval training, pensions,
immigration, the Philippines, which he
feels need help from congress, the
Panama canal, etc.
The president advocates an increase
iu coast artillery and defenses, more
seamen rather than more ships at pres
ent, deprecates class spirit as fatal to
all communities in which it has been
dominant, and again pledges his adher
ence to the principle of a square deal
to all.
The President's Me stage.
President Roosevelt's message to the
Gyth tougress. his first great state pa
per since iluctiou into the executive
office by his own right, as read to the
congress today, appears in complete
form in this issue of The Argus. The
document is a voluminous one. of 27
column, and. apart from the thorough
Shall a Woman Die on the Scaffold?
The supreme court of the United
States has decided that it has no juris
diction over the case of Mary Rogers,
the Vermont woman accused of the
murder of her husband to secure his
life insurance and marry another man.
Nothing stands between this woman
and death on the scaffold but the gov
ernor of the state, and that official has
declared he will not interfere.
The crime committed by this woman
was an atrocious one. but none the les.
there is a strong sentiment throughout
the country against hanging a woman.
There may have been no excuse for
this crime and nothing can palliate the
offense. It was fiendish. I5ut Mary
Rogers is a woman, and sentiment re
volts against the execution of a wo
man. Hanging, while brutalizing, is sup
jMised to deter others. In this case the
awful lesson will be lost, as Mary Rog
ers committed the crime over a year
ago. Had she been tried, convicted
and executed within reasonable time
after the crime was committed, it
might have had a deterrent eff"ct. So
long a time has elapsed that the crime
has been forgotten and sympathy has
been aroused for the miserable woman.
And Mary Rogers is a miserable wo
man. She is weak morally and men
tally. She is more of an imbecile than
a degenerate. To put this moral and
mental weakling to death would be an
inhuman act. It would have no ex
ample. The justice that requires it is
mistaken if not brutal. We ought to
be too far advanced in the scale of
mercy, refinement and humanity now
to gibbet a weak woman.
Mary Rogers should be saved this
awful death. The place for her is a
prison, where she should spend h?r
natural life. Such a disposition of this
friendless wretch would do credit to
the state of Vermont. Her execution
would forever disgrace that commonwealth.
The ChaugA la Inauguration Day.
The national committee on the pro
posed change uf inauguration day has
decided to recommend to congress an
amendment to the constitution making
the date of the presidential inaugura
tion the last Thursday of April. It
would be difficult lo say ju.-t wheu the
agitation for a change iu the date of
the inauguration of American presi
dents began, but it has been in pro
gress quite steadily for almost a cen
tury. The cases of illness and death
that follow nearly every inauguration
give impetus and force to the agitation
for a time, but while practically every
body is agreed that the date should be
changed, there has been until now no
systematized movement to bring it
about. After this year's inauguration
a formal movement was set on foot to
unite the whole country in an effort to
have the constitution amended so that
a less Inclement date might be fixed.
The list of casualties last March, al
though the day was an exceptionally
pleasant one for the season, gave spe
cial impetus to the movtment. Sena
tor Hate of Tennessee. Judge Weldon
of the court of claims, and the Mexican
ambassador died because of exposure
during the exercises.
It is not an easy matter to procure
the adoption of an amendment to the
federal constitution. Amendments may
be proposed by two-thirds of both
houses of congress, or on the applica
tion of the legislatures of two-thirds
of the states calling a convention for
promising amendments. Amendments
so proposed will be valid when ratified
by the legislatures of three-fourths of
the states or by conventions in three
fourths of the states, as preferred by
congress. In regard to the proposed
change of inauguration day. :i is be
lieved that there will be no great diffi
culty in inducing congress to propose
the necissary amendment. The senate
has already on two occasions adopted
the required joint resolution by a
unanimous vote. Itis failed in the
house either t hronXltlack of interest or
because of the pressure of other business.

DAILY SHORT STORY
HOW THE CHURCH WAS BUILT.
Original. J
The people of Fireaway City were
emerging from barbarism. Some of
them were already getting ashamed of
the city's name, though this was by no
means outspoken. At any rate, the
frequent shootings which gave rise to
the appellation had somewhat fallen
off. Some of the older, more settled of
the population advocated a church
They called a meeting of the citizens,
and Deacon Snell called deacon be-
cause he was the only man in the place,
who had never had a "scrap" with any
one made a speech announcing that
the meeting had been called for the(
purpose of taking measures to build a
church. -A church." be said, "would
be useful in a number of ways. In the
first place, it would benefit our ini- i
mortal souls. In the second, it would ,
tend to the respectability of the place
by redueiug the number of shooting!
affairs." ,
The eitizeiis were unanimous that ,
they wanted a church. There was no ;
about to be opened when a man called
Slippery Sam. from the fact that he
had managed to kill every movement
for reform that bad thus far taken
place, called the attention of the nieet
iug to the fact that the raising of funds
for the church might be used to stop
the shooting that was still nourishing,
lie proposed that the first niau who
killed another be obliged to build the
church.
The proposition took the assembly
like a sudden change of wind. There
was no opposition, but the idea was so
novel that it required thought. Pete
Hawkins, who bad many notches in his
gun. asked if the man who might lose
iu the game would be allowed to put
up the money to build the church or
must build it himself. The proposer of
the scheme said that he Intended that
the loser should do the work himself.
This would make the ioualty all the
more effective. The building of u log
church big enough to hold. say. fifty
people was no easy task. Slippery
Sam's proposition, with the amend
ment, was adopted, and the meeting
adjourned with a vote of thauks to the
author of the scheme, who had for once
apieared ou the side of reform.
Fireavvay City suddenly lui'anie a
highly Christian town. At least so it
appeared. The day alter the meetiug
IMck Kvaus called Hank Williams a
cheat over a game of cards. Hank got
his gun out before Ii k, whoso holder
had got twisted, and was about to
shoot when he remembered the church
building. "Forgive me, brother," be
said. "I was wrong." Then, as the
game prociM-dcd. be remarked casual
ly: "I wish some galoot "d git plugged.
Theu u feller could do his shoot in" with
out bein interrupted."
During the next few weeks there
were live cases of apology that, with
out the penalty, would have been shoot
ings and any number of small make
ups, the issue of which would have
been uncertain. Then it began to be
remarked that Slipitery Sam hail killed
the church after all, for it was evident
tbat no one was going lo shoot any one.
thus bringing on himself the penalty of
building it.
Slippery Sam began-to grow unpopu
lar. It was not that be opposed reform,
but that he had proposed a scheme
which was found to be irksome. At
the Alhiimbra saloon tone morning the
matter of forcing thefuuthor of the an
noying plan to end the embargo by
shooting some one himself was dis
cussed. The difficulty in the way was
that it n J' one inducing him to shoot
must get shot. The parly was ready
to do most anything to put an end to
the situation, but no one was willing
to be the victim.
It was finally decided to draw lots as
to who shouhl insult Slippery Sam and
get killed for !he benefit 'of the whole.
Pete Hawkins drew the red poker chip
that had lccu put into a bat with a
dozen or more white ones. He asked
if it was optional with hint to Ie killed
or to kill Sam and suffer the penalty
of building the church. A conference
followed, at the end of which he was
informed that when the lots were
drawn it was understood that the loser
was to be shot. It would not be fair to
those whose lives had been risked in
the drawing to now permit the loser to
save his life by building the church.
Hawkins turned a trifle pale at this
decision and bade farewell to them all.
taking each by the hand. Then be
went out to find Slippery Sam. In ten
minutes a succession of pistol shots
were heard, and the citizens congre
gated about the bodies of Slippery Sam
and Pete Hawkins, who had killed
each other, thus leaving the communi
ty in the same fix as before, for neither
had been left to build the church.
A meeting was called to settle the
question whether the conditions still
held good. The resolution read that the
first person to kill a man must put up
the building. The first man to kill was
dead. Should it now 1h understood
tbat the next man to kill should build
the church. When the question was
put. thjjre was a shout of "No!" from
those who bad affairs to settle. The
peace party voted "Yes." Deacon Sneil
aroe and said:
"ThU yere penalty has got rid o the
two men in Fireaway City tbat always
done the most damage. Slippery Sam.
who was agin reform, and Pete Haw
kins, who did the most killln. Now.
I've a double proposition to make that
we hang the next man tbat shoots and
ail take hold and build the church."
The proposition was received enthu
siastically by the peace men, and, as
for the shooters, they were overawed.
They left Fireaway City for more con
genial ground.", and those who remain
ed built the church.
