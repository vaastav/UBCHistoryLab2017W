TUE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Presideut Cleveland's message to
Congress, delivered yesterday, is up
to date in regard to its length, and
in this respect will compare favor
ably with previous messages.
message opens with a brief analysis
of the recent election, iu which the
patriotism of tho American people
is commended. Speaking of foreign
affairs, he declares that the disturbed
condition iu Asiatic Turkey has
assumed a less hideous aud bloody
aspect during the past year, and
says:
"I do not believe tho present
sombre prospect in Turkey will be
long permitted to offend thesightof
Christendom. It so mars the humane
and enlightened that belongs to the
close of the nineteenth century that
it seems hardly possibly that tho
earnest demand of good people
throughout the Christian world for
its cerrective treatment will remain
unanswered."
In dealing with tho Cuban situa
tion, he unalterably opposes the
recognition of the insurgents as
belligerents. He believes the situa
tion to be too delicate for any inter
vention on the part of the United
States at tho present time, although
his message strongly bints that the
ultimate outcome may require an
aggressive stand on the part of this
government. With the greatest deli
cacy he devotes a large portion of
his message to a review of the situa
tion, and points as a solution of the
problem the offer to Cuba on the
part of Spain of genuine autonomy.
It has been intimated to Spain, and
that country does not seem unwill
ing to adopt the suggestion, that the
United States act as mediator in
bringing about this result. At the
the same time, Spain demands that
the insurgents lay down their arms
before a compromise will bo con
sidered, and the Cubans insist on
something more definite than a
promise of autonomy before they
will consent to do so. In any event,
the president says, the United States
should make no attempt to acquire
the island, and should prevent anv
other power from acquiring it. if,
however, the ability of Spain to
demonstrate its sovereignity be
comes manifest, the United States
should not hesitate to recognize and
and discharge its duties without, in
any way, meanwhile, stimulating a
disregard to duty or ill timed ex
pression of feeling.
Briefly touching on the Venezue
lan boundary question, and the
Behring Sea complications, the pres
ident then demotes himself to inter
nal affairs.
In reviewing the war department,
the president does not recommend
an increased army, and he says, tho
organized militia numbers 112,57!)
men and costs $33)0,000 annually
which should suffice. He believes
both tho regular army and militia
should aave more money for equip
ments. Regarding the navy, the president
recommends the expenditure of
money for coast defenses, declares
his belief in the ability of the gov
ernment to build its own vessels
and equipments, is opposed to pav
ing any further speed premiums and
recommends a plan for laying up
ships in xeserve, so as to reducu the
cost of maintaining our vessels
afloat. Eight new cruisers and
twenty-eight new gun boats have
been commissioned, ana tno chief
executive says American ships are
eaual to any that float.
The president thinks federal of
fenders should be confined in gov
ernment prisons.
The postofEce department, ho
savs, is in gooa condition, witn a
deficit of $8,000,000 owing to reduc
tion in postal duties, and tho in
crease, witnout proportionate rev
enue, of the lew class matter.
He demands the settlement of the
Pacific railway loans and grants,
aud especially the foreclosure of the
Union Pacific mortgage. He shows
that in tho agricultural department
that the valun of farm products
in 1S96 amounted to fo70,000,000.
He is opposed to the further gratu
itous distribution of seed.
The inter state commerce and
civil service laws are highly com
mended. While admitting a deficit of a
little more than $25,000,000, he de
fends the Wilson tariff bill as hav
ing opened up foreign markets and
stimulated trade with othar coun
tries. The present bill, he says, will
yield sufficient revenue if given a
fair trial, but the deficit was to be
expected in the face of the business
depression of the past two years.
In this connection, he defends the
drafts made on the reservo fund, as
he says it is immeasurably better to
appropriate our surplus to the pay
ment of justifiable expenses than to
allow it to become an invitation for
reckless appropriations and extrava
gant expenditures.
He alludes to our financial meth
ods as weak and vicious and asks
prompt reform of the system which
is opposed to every rule of sound
finance and shown by experience to
be fraught with grievous peril and
perplexity. He refers to the late
contest as being a greater menace to
prosperity than the late war. He
declares financial peace cannot be
secured until the government cur
rency obligations, upon which gold
may be demanded, are withdrawn
from circulation and cancelled. He
advocates their exchange for long
term, low interest bonds, and their
redemption with the proceeds of
such bonds.
Summing up the financial situa
tion, the president says: "The entiro l
case maybe presented by tho state
ment that the day of sensible and
sound finaucial methods will not
dawn on us until our government
abandons the banking business and
the accumulatioa of fuuds aud con
fines its monetary operations to tho
recoipt of tho money contributed by
the people for its support aud to

tho peoples benefit. Our business ;
-w T I-, O
for a rest from feverish agitation,
and for tho inauguration by the
government of a reformed financial
policy, which will encourage enter
prise and make certain the rewards

H denounces t hot undone v of tho
and monopolies, tho tendency of
which, tho president says, is to crush
out industial independence and to
hinder or prevent the use of humau
faculties and tho full development
of human character.

SLIGHTLY EGOTISTICALLY lCLIN
El The Phonix Republicau recently
has had two or three very commend
able articles iu it in regard to the
rebuildibir of Fort Whipple. It is
highly gratifying indeed to see at
least one of our Phenix contem
poraries advocating something for
the benefit of Prescott,as it is some
what of an innovation on the policy
heretofore pursued by the press of
tha. city. The editor of tho Repub
lican, though, in his advocacy of this
measure, exhibits a freshness which,
if uot curbed, is liable to do the
cause more harm than good. He
seems to think that ho has struck a
new lead, one that the people of
Arizona have been treading over for
years without haciaCTprospectea it.
He writes as though an idea had
been born in his brain which would
never have come to life had he not
been born, in all of which he not on
ly makes himself appear ridiculous,
but be subjects the cause he advo
cates to ridicule as well. Here is a
a sample of his self exultation:
aThe proposition of The Republi
can that a determined effort be
made this winter by tho people of
northern and southern Arizona to
bring about the enlargement of
Fort Whipple, is meeting with much
favor, if the letters received at this
office are anv indication. We con
fess to a feeling of surprise that the
Prescott papers do not appear to
take kindly to the proposition."
Why bless the fresh soul of the
writer of the above; tho Prescott
papers have printed acies and aeres
of argument on the above subject
before the present editor of The
Republican ever heard of Arizona.
The press and people of Pre3colt
have worked assiduously for y ars
to prevent the abandonm?nt of tie
post, and the best means to prewi.t
its abandonment is te have it rebuilt
permanently. The fiat had gone
forth on-e, and the order had be?n
signed for its abandonment, when
the press aud the citizens of Pres
cott took up the fight and prevailtd
on tho authorities to hold back the
order and uot issue it. Their desires
wero accomplished in so far as pre
venting its abandonment was cor-
cerned, but its permanency was not
fully established by having it re
built ot even permanently repaired,
The strategic advantages it as
sesses, the healthful climate of the
mountainous couutry in which it is
Ino.itod. the mutual advantacrs it
possesses socially, both to tho tB
cers and ladies of the garrison and
thecitizensof Prescott, theexcolleut
railroad facilities it enjoys, whereby
troops can bo forwarded on a mo
ment's notice to the most remote
parts ol the territory, its proximity
to a great transcontinental railroad
and the importance of haviug
military post so located, the pt-ssi
bilities of danger with the Navajo
Indians or Mohave-Apache Iud.ans,
(the latter formerly having had
their homes in this section), in e ise
of the withdrawal of troops f-om
this post, the only ouo now iu ibe
northern part of the territory all
of these and a thousand ana one
arguments of minor importance,
havo been gone over, written and
rewritten, by Prescott papers, Miffi
cientlv to fill a large Tolume. Pres
cott papers have been advocating
this for years. It is quite a piece of
egotistical assumption for our ew
neighbor then, of Tho Republican,
to assert or intimate that "the Pres
cott papers do not tako kindly to
tho proposition."
Tho JorsxAL-MiXER was the first
paper m tho territory to copy and
comment favorably upon Ueneral
Wheaton's report, advocating the
rebuilding of Whipple, and it took
our egotistical Phenix contemporary
about two weeks after its publica
tion in this paper, to -"catch on,"
and then only did so, apparently,
after having its memory "jogged"
from other sources.
A CONFl'MON OT HUMPS.
The proof asked for by tho Jortt-xal-Mixeb
recently, iu regard to the
Yavapai Railroad and Redemption
Bonds having been sold in Now York
for ten or fifteen cents on tho dollar,
and that certaiu parties who now
favor the payment of these bonds
were the purchasers, has not been
forthcoming. While, as previously
stated, if this transaction has taken
place, it would make no difference
as to the legal status of the ques
tion, yet, so far as tho moral obliga
tion is concerned, there is no doubt
that mauy might be influenced by
it. It would eliminato the "inno
cent purchaser" from tho transac
tion. Investigation of tho questiou
leads us to the honest conviction
that no speculation has takon place,
as charged. That tho bonds are
stiU heId b tho original purchasers,
T , f fa anypart of
them, ever took place at ten or
fifteen cents on tho doUar. Now, if
any one is in possession of any facts
contrary to this statement, we would
like to see them. It is a fact that
very many people hero do not know
tho difference between the real,
genuine P. & A. C. bonds and the
so called P. it A. C. bonds, but
which in reality are known as tho
Yavapai County Redemption and
Railroad Bonds, the word Prescotts
aud Arizona Central Railway not j
... .1 ii r I .
appearing on muni ai an. uoou i
evidence of this assertion will appear i
later iu this article. I
When Mr. Uullook built his road, )
he received $10,000 in bonds on the
completion of each ton miles of it,
or, at the rate of $1,000 per mile.
Wheu the toad was completed, he
bonded tho road for Sl.SW.WO, or a
little over $20,000 per mile. Of this, i
$775,000 was issued as tirt mortgage
bonds and $775,000 in s-e-'oud mort
gage bonds.
It will bo remembered that aftur
buildiug seeral miles of the road,
he practically forced upon tho peo
ple of Preseotb about $50.(XX1 of
j thes, boiuJ hv ropre.M.utiu g that he
was unable to meet ins obligations,
and this sum of money was uwea
sry to euable him to uompIne it.
A subscription was taken up, and
something less thau the above
amount was paid and the subscribers
afterwards received tho bonds in
exchange. A few years later, Mr.
Bullock had one of his agents pur
chase all the bonds he could, the
price ranging from forty cents
upwards. One mau, who is a keen
and shrewd business man, too, re
marked only a few days ago, when
the question of the P. & A. C. bonds
selling for ten or fifteen cents on tho
dollar was being discussed, remarked
that bo had received seventy-five
cents on the dollar for his. What
ho had was a genuine P. fc A. C.
bond, whereas tho bonds now upper
most in the minds of the public are
the Yavapai Couuty R. & R. bonds.
The P. it A. C. bonds did sell at one
time, and wero so quoted in finan
cial papers, at teu cents on the dol
lar, and the entire issue of them,
amounting to $1,550,000, is uot now
worth ten cents.
It can be readily seen how tho
quotation of tho P, & A. C. bonds
has been confounded with the
Yayapai Co. R. it R. bonds and how
the ten-cent story was started.
PHARISAICAL JOURNALISM.
The "I am holier thau thou." press
has broken out again iu a fresh spot.
It is amusing to the fraternity and
must bo equally amusing to the
reading public to witness the ex
pressions of self righteousness and
egotistical assersions of self honesty
indulged in by a nowspaper here
and there, now and again, the
assertion always being coupled with
an insinuation that every paper dis
agreeing with it on any propositio
has been purchased or is actuated
from mercenary motives. Such self
righteous papers are, of course.
comparatively few, but their dema
gogical aspertious on tho press
the couutry are totally unwarranted
We believe that the newspaper busi
noss of tho couutry, both of the
metropolitan press and couutry
press, is conducted.on as houest busi
ness principles as any other business.
Wo believe that the men engaged in
it, as a class, are as conscientious and
s honest as any class of business
men. Thev no doubt have tho same
frailties and human weaknesses
other men, their judgmeut may not
be any better, and they make mis
takes, but we believe that they are
actuated from as pure, unselfish and
conscientious motives as tho average
business man. In all professions
and in all business, an occasional
exception to the general ruld
honesty is lounu, and the samo
oocurs in tho newspaper business.
and hence occasionally a man
found in tho business who is a black
mailer by instinct, who is dishonest
from principle and who adopts this
profession as more congenial to him
than others. A man who is found
honest aud upright in his ordinary
dealings with his fellow men, will be
found houest iu his business. When
ver you see an individual proclaim
ing against the honesty of hi fellow
citizens, it is generally a safe propo
sition to watch him closely in any
business transaction. The same rule
will apply to newspapers which
make general proclamations against
tho houestv of the press, while
perching themselves on self built
pedestals of honesty and upright
ness. It is true that all individuals
are moro or loss influenced by their
environments, but the truth'of this
is no moro evident as applied to
nowspapers than thau to any other
branch of business. Tho true man
in any business seeks to elevate his
calling, rather than to bring it into
disrepute by decrying the motives
of all others engaged in it except
himself. Who over heard of
preacher or a lawyer declaiming
against tho honesty or integrity,
generally, of those engaged in these
professions? Why is it then that it
remains for those engaged in the
newspaper business to bring dis
credit on thoir calling by unfounded
accusations and insinuations against
others engaged in it? The man who
does it simply makes a case against
himself iu so doing, as the public,
if convinced by what he says, does
not stop to discriminate in his favor,
but, iu making up its mind, includes
him with all others in tho profes
sion. The salo of tho Coconino Sun to
the Flagstaff Democrat, aud the
consolidation of the two papers as a
democratic sheet, is quite a loss to
the republican party. Mr. Funston
has published a most uncompromis
ing republican sheet, and the sale
of the paper leavos Coconino county
without a republican paper. Re
publicans as a rule in this territory
are not as enthusiastic in the sup
port of their party papers as the
opposition.

TILL CEXSOKIOUSLY I.NCLINKD.
"Tho Prescott Jocknal-Mimxr
makes a most ridiculous confession.
'The Prescott papers,' it says, 'have
printed acres and acres of argument'
on the subject of tho restoration of
Fort Whipple. Yet in spito of these
'acres' the post has steadily gone
to decay. Probably the 'argumont
was of the Tariety employed in tho
Jocbxal-Mlvkr's attack' upon the
Republican. We are sorry that
petty jealousy impairs the Jocrnal
Mixer's usefulness iu the present
emergency. Hassayamper methods
will not bring about the enlarge
ment of Fort Whipple." Phonix
Republican.
Replying to the above, the argu
ment used by Prescott papers in
faror of the rebuilding of Whipple,
and of making it a permanent and
large military post were the same
as that recently used by our Phenix
contemporary. So far as any attack
on the Republican by tho Jocrnal
Miner is concerned we were not
aware of any having been made. A
false aspersion ou the papers of
Prescott, by the Republicau was re
sented, but no "Hassayamper meth
ods" wero used and no petty jeal
ousy shown. If our contemporary
will extract the beam from its own
eye, before attempting to ceno
riously, pull the motes from others'
eyes, it will probably discover that
the petty joalousy, if it exists at all,
is found at home. The Jocrxal
Mixer, instead of possessing any
jealousy toward any one which will
help to build up the iuterests of
this section, has but the kindliest
feelings for them.
Our usually affable and amiable
contemporary, tho Phonix Herald,
jumps on tho Journal-Miner, with
its hob nailed boots, claiming that
we intimated "that tho policy of tho
press of Phenix has been antagonist
to Prescott." No such intimation
has ever been published in the
Jocbnal-Miner and our Phenix con
temporary must bo sensitive in the
extreme to construe such a meaning
from the language used. The iuti
mation was that the press of that
city is so devoted to the advance
ment of local interests that they
seldom found space or time to ad
vocato any special measure advanta
geous to other sections of tho terri
tory. Tho notice was a compli
xnont rather thau a criticism fo
their devotion to their local inter
ests. Nothing was said about thei
being antagonistic to Prescott or
any other section, no intimation of
such a thing was mado and the lan
guago used is not susceptible o
such construction. The article
which the Herald criticises was ono
commending a Phonix paper for
making a special effort ou behalf o
tnts section, and it was referred to
"as somewhat of au innovation o
tho policy heretofore pursued by
tho press of that city," the policy re
ferred to being outlined above,
Our contemporary ahould.know tho
Jocr.val-Miner well enough to
know that when it has anythiug to
ay on any subject it says it in lan
guago which cannot bo mistaken,
and not by intimation or insinua
tion. Next.
Iu its discussion of the Yavapai
railroad bonds tho Journal-Miner
has aimed to be just and fair. Our
contemporary now says that "should
tho P. & A. C. bonds be refunded,
the entire burden of their payment
would fall on Yavapai county, with
the chances that hould Coconino
county win its suit, tho taxpayers
of Tavapai would have to go down
into their pockets and pay an ad
ditional one hundred thousand dol
lars in tho promises." This statH-
mentof the case is misleading, in
asmuch as Yavapai countv ha
already received from Coconino one
third of tho amount of the bonds.
Should the courts declare tho bonds
valid, Coconino would not press her
suit against this county, as she
would have no valid claim. But in
caso the bonds wore declared valid,
and Coconino county should also
sustain her suit, & condition whollv
unlikely, it would only mako Yava
pai county responsible for the full
original amount, and uot for tho
amount of tho bonds plus $100,000,
as the latter sum has alroady been
received on them.
The Phenix Gazetto seems sorao-
what alarmed lest tho next legisla
ture which is overwhomlingly dem
ocratic may be corrupted by repub-
icans. It says, "a powerful republ
ican, lobby is preparing to entrench
itself in Phonix this winter for the
purpose of corrupting the legisla
ture." Tho claim has always beeu
made by democrats that democrats
are incorruptible.

Thu Journal-Miner has never at
tempted to give any advice on the
railroad bond questiou, and certainly
it has never advised any action on
any question which might smack of
repudiation. It has discussed tho
bond quostion from the stand point
of ono who finds it exceedingly diffi
cult to meet the yearly dues de
manded of it in taxes, amounting, in
round numbers, to $2500 per month.
It has discussed it impassiouately,
and without resorting to insinua
tions or abuse of any one. It has
discussed it from a business stand
point solely, eliminating all preju
dice and demagogy, but appealing
to the intelligence, rather than the
prejudices, of its readers. It asks
no one to endorse or adopt its
opinions. In its discussion it has
. aimed to be fair, honest, just and
truthful, and we think tho public
generally will admit that it has been
successful in this respect, whether
agreeing with its deductions or not.
c . .
oomo people appear to be sur
prised to know that about the first
official act of President McKinley
will be the calling of au extra ses
sion of Congress to pass a protec
tive tariff bill. Why, we cannot

publican speaker during the cam

very thing should be done, and
certainly there is no one thing which
tho country stands iu more pressing
need of thau a tariff law which will
produce tho revenue needed and at
the same time protoct every class of
American produces. The only regret
is that the legislation cannot be
had before next spring. But, by
calling an extra session, and by
attempting to furnish relief through
legislation, tho republican party
will manifest its earnestness in the
matter, somethiug the democrats
failed to do when they went into
power in 1S93.
Whitelaw Reid and family arrived
in Phenix on Tuesday afternoon to
peud the winter. Mr. Reid recently
published a very interesting article
on Arizona in the New York Tribune
and which has been extensively
copied. It is one of tho most com
prehensive articles that has come
under our notice, covering, as it
does, every point which would bo of
interest to parties intending to come
to the territory. It is written in a
very interesting and entertaining
style, too, and is bound to prove of
groat benefit to the territory.
During tho recent campaign, Mr.
Bryan, himself a newspaper man
and a cohorts of his shouters and

occasion. And now we find some
of the prst campaign echoes on tho

it into wecond childhood.
