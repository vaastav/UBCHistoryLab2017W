t'B'j. until, hy further litigation, tho Court of
f'B'V Appeals shall havo decided whether tho
St H'' construction sought will or will not entail
K ? upon the city a debt exceeding tho const!-
K flt': tutlonal limit.

J& Bj ' Republican member :

v&f , India Demands Self-Government.
flf The British Government seems to have
, awakened to the fact that It has something
fi more to deal with In India than a mere
, passing wnro of discontent. It has been
j..- j$ forced to recognize that it has to fnco a do-
-1 mand on the part of the people of British
"S I India for some share In tho government of
s their own country, soino voice in the way
i their taxes shall bu raised and expended.
It 'j At the present moment they have neither
V- I one nor thu other.
i On different occasions, notably In 1858
; after the mutiny of tho natlvo army had
& J" given the British Government the oppor-
'W 'X tunlty to assume tlu direct administration
F t of India, the. people of India havo been as-
(jj . cured by royal proclamation that the
& sovereign recognized no distinction be-
x f tween her llrll.lsh subjects and her natlve-
S horn subjects, In tho proclamation of Nov.
tt i, 1858, which the peojilo ot India regard
5' I as the great charter of their rights, the fol-
ij f lowing special clauses occur:
WMi. "Wo hold ouraelves Iwund to the natives of our
iGf ' Indian territories by tho saino obligations of duty
WW t, which bind us tu all our other subtects, and thoge
m ' ; bllgstlons, by the blessing of Almighty Qop, we shall
ti. . stalthfully anJ conoclrntlnusly fulni,
'IS' "Abdnt Is our further will that, so far as may be,
m i our subjects, of whatcr ruce or creed, be freely
. suid Impartially 4lnilttcd to ofltces In our service,
'. L the dutli-s of wbl-h they may be quallAed by their
f : l education, ability and Integrity duly to discharge.
' "In their prosperity n 111 be our strength, In thslr
, S1 eontentmetit our security, and In their gratitude our
S- f test reward. Ami may OoDgrauttous, and to those
Br V In authority under us, atreniith lo carry out tlieso
S L our withes for the good of our people."
ft f Nothing could bo moro explicit than this.
l ', It was received lu India with public re-
' W Jolclng, fireworks, Illuminations, and tho
, r. tiring of cannon. On tho faith of It, thou-
i sands of young Indians set to work to qual-
Ify themselves for ofllcial posts lu the nd-
-i: i ministration and government of their
S. I country, only to find that all tho lino
S' promises of tho royal proclamation wcro
1 Illusory, and that, whatever was the inten-
I ' tlonof Itsframers, It had been studiously
; nulllfled In execution,
v l Suon after this proclamation was Issued
VS. ft committee was appointed by the Secre-
tutj of Stato for India, composed of flvo
i j" Anglo-Indian members of his own Council.
r 5 They madd their report on Jan. L'O, 1800.
t ! T In It they found that whllo theoretically
s' j J there existed no positive disqualification
V ' I and the natives of Iutliuwero not excluded
I from tboclvll service of India, In practice
f ,f they were excluded. Tho dilUettltics en-

almost Impossible for a tiatlto success
fully to compete at tho periodical examina
tions, which are held In England, Tho
committee recommended that ln order to
remedy this, examinations should be held
simultaneously ln England and India,
Identical In their naturo, the competitors
being Anally classified In one list, accord
ing to merit, by the Civil .Service Com
missioners. This vory fair and just solution was re
jected, as It would have endod tho monop
oly that has been enjoyed by British-born
subjects for over forty years of employment
In tho Indian civil service. Its rejection
blighted the hopes ot tho Indian people,
and has contributed, along with the spread
of education, to rouse them to demand,
with a voice described by English reac
tionary Journals as " seditious," tho fulfil
ment of the promises successively mado by
British Governments In 1833 and 1858.
In 1807 the question was brought before
tho Government of tho day In England, and
much show was mado of considering how
natlvo Indians could bo admitted to share
In tho administration of their country, but
all Instructions Issued were thwarted by
what Lord Lyttoh called "subterfuges,"
and with great Ingenuity.
In 1870 a law was passed reiterating and
confirming tho rights of natlvo Indians to
employment In tho government of their
country, but, llko tho royal promises that
had preceded It, It was enacted only to be
come a dead letter.
What may bo the ultimate Issue of the,
strugglo now begun In India for only a
moderate measure of self-government, Is In
volved In obscurity. Tbo present Govern
ment of England has at Its bead a states
man who, a few years ago, said that tho
only policy for India was one of drift and
blood-letting. But that policy Is now
stranded ; and It Is not Indian blood only
that Is flowing or Indian money only that
Is being spent.
The admitted failure of the military ex
pedition against tho Afrldls to accom
plish Its object, with the consequent dim
inution of tho British prestige, ts itself
a material addition to the strength of tho
Indian demand. British rule has existed
ln India for a century and a half, and not a
promlso mado to Its people by Its alien
rulers has yet been fulfilled. The overtaxa
tion of tho wholo people, numbering some
240,000,000, has becomo bo burdensome
that It Is a question whether tho world
may not witness ono of tho most glgantlo
bankruptcies of history, only in less degree
disastrous to the conquered Indians than
to their British conquerors.
In 1883, Lord llAnTlNOTON, now tho
Duko of DcvoNsninE and a member of
tho present British Cabinet, warned tho
British people of tho danger of the self
ish policy that was being followed In
India, and of tbo effect It would have In
exasperating tho peoplo against British
rule. He Is now lu a position to make his
influence felt, If it is not already too
late. Influential Indians in their despair
aro openly asking each other whether the
condition of their country could be worse
under Russian rule, and one in particular
has gone so far as to warn tho English
Government that there aro features In Its
Indian administration which Russian
emissaries could urge with great plausi
bility upon tho minds of the masses of the
Indian peoplo against tho English, If ever
the Russian Government contemplated dis
turbing England ln India,
Tbo Proper Christmas Gift.
A letter from Brooklyn asks of us a ques
tion which, doubtless, ts perplexing the
minds of many thousands of tho readers of
Tub Sun at this time, when 'ho season for
giving gifts Is so near at hand. The lines
of public transportation are crowded dally
even In the hours when usually the lessened
demand on their accommodations favors
tho comfort of the remaining travellers,
and a great part, If not tho majority, of the
women who occupy chiefly the seats and
cling to the straps of the cars aro loaded
down with parcels indubitably containing
Christmas gifts.
It Is a Bight which increases respect for
human naturo and Is altogether touching.
Wo may describe It as an outward and
visible sign of an Inward and spiritual
grace, using without Irreverence the words
of the Catechism's definition of a sacra
ment, for It affords a conspicuous manifes
tation of tho self -sacrificing human affec
tion which Is so closely akin to the very
essence of religious sentiment. Mr. Stead
of London puts New York In the regions
under tho special rule of Satan, but the
great enemy of souIb must feel that a dan
gerous rebellion against bis diabolical au
thority Is going on hereabouts In these
holiday days.
The letter of Inquiry to which wo have
referred Is to this effect:
" To tiik KnrroB of The Snx sir: Kindly mention
a few things, either of which you consider appropri
ate to offer to a young lady as a hoUday gift. I have
only been aoqualnted with the aforesaid about three
months. Ehe works where I do, and at a press. One
day she accidentally cut bar anger so badly aa to pre
vent her from resuming the same work for about five
weeks. During that time I bad her ln my charge In
another branch of the business.
"I have escorted ber home almost nightly for six
weeks i and have been out with her on several occa
sions aitarwaid. and am very fond of her company,
as you will readily detect.
"About three weeks haveelapeed since the death
of her sister, to whom she was so closely attached
that she seema to Imagine that there la little or no
Joy In llfo for her,
"If you will please respond at onoe I shall feel
greatly obliged to you for your extreme kindness,
"Drookltx, Dec, la."
Tlio multitude of gifts proper for Christ
mas Is endless In variety, and, happily, It
Includes numberless articles whoso prices
are within tho means of every giver, no
matter how light his purse. Tho cheapness
of many really beautiful manufactures Is
amazing. Our friend, however, It is evi
dent, desires that his gift shall represont
and signify In Ita importanco and appropri
ateness tho great depth of his affection
and sympathy for tho woman of whom
ho Is enamored. Most of all, ho wIsIicb
that It should touch her heart and rovcal to
her tho richness of his sentiment toward
her. But magnitude In the Rift Is not
requisite for that purpose It Is the giving
rather tlian tho mero material form of tho
gift which expresses that feeling. Tho gift
Is only tho outward and visible sign ; tho
emotion that prompts tho giving is the In
ward anu spiritual grace.
Hence It Is not of much matter what the
gift Is, so long as ho gives It and sho ac
cepts It as a revelation of that spirit. If It
is possible for him to discover what she
desires particularly, that will bo an ap
propriate gift; but so also will any gift bo
appropriate. It, Is not the gold In tho wed
ding ring which makes tbo matron cherish
It through llfo with an almost superstitious
regard, but the marrlago It typifies and
symbolizes. The veriest trlflo may be en
riched beyond price by the Inward grace ot
vblch It Is tbo outward expression. Dia
monds and rubles can tell no more of that
spiritual Boutlincnt than the cheapest arti
cle at the bargain counter. The two have
no relation. The only value worth con
sideration Is In the feeling1. '
Great complaint is mado of the unequal
distribution of the blessings of life, but
the organization of the social system does
not cause any inequality In the distribu
tion of tbo greatest blessing of all. Affec
tion is Independent of poverty or riches;
It bears no relation to material circum
stances. Everybody gets of It the full
share ho deserves, since the blessing is
rather in tho bestowal ot the affection than
In tho receiving of It.
Accordingly, wo do not need to suggest
to our Inquiring frlond any particular gift.
Whatever ho gives to the girl will be glo
rified by tho affection it symbolizes and
to which It appeals.
Japan and Klao Chou.
The mingling of anxiety and caution
which tho Mikado's Government shows
regarding Germany's seizure of Klao Chou
Bay Is suggestive Tho Inquiries which Its
representatives at various European courto
and at Pekln, according to tho despatches,
havo been Instructed to make, aro as to
Germany's chief object In that seizure;
whether It la to bo temporary or perma
nent ; whether Germany, France, and Rus
sia consented to it beforehand, and how
China regards it.
These Inquiries show that Japan not only
know nothing about tho move, but Is still
completely at sea on tho subject. Her
questions go to tho root of the matter, and
Involvo what we all want to know; but
they also Indicate that sho has not been
consulted by any other power, and Is com
pelled to make advances In order to ob
tain elementary Information.
There Is Uttlo doubt that Japan feels
keenly the German encroachment In China.
It was Bald, at tho closo of her great victory
over that country, that sho was anxious to
form a league with her against European
aggression; and, however that may havo
been, it Is clear that in Russia's attitude,
practically oausing her withdrawal from
the mainland, and regulating the character
of her protectorate In Corea, she recognized
that Europe was a bar to any notions of
conttnontal aggrandizement.
In tho absence of an agreement between
China and Japan for mutual support, tho
capacity of tho Celestial Kingdom for
blundering is so enormous that Japan would
hcsltato to link her destiny with that of her
neighbor. Japan's future points to growth
and greatness, while China may any day be
broken to pieces. Not only China's military
and naval weakness but also her fatal habit
of procrastination exposes ber to constant
peril, Japan wisely refrains from stand
ing by her now until after sounding tho
European powers as to what thoy think
and will do.
This policy, also, avoids the danger of a
rebuff which Japan might get should sho
protest on her Individual account against
Germany's conduct. Such a stop ln tho
dark might be a severe blow to her slowly
growing prestige Japan bos too lately
como out of the list of negligible nations
for very posltfvo self-assertion. Sha is
steadily growing Into a power that must
be reckoned with In International affairs,
but she knows the riak ot presumption.
Meanwhllo oho becomes spokesman for
the rest of the world In regard to what we
all want to know. If the answers to the
questions which her Foreign Minister Is
roported to have drawn up, are frank and
prompt, and are made public, all needed
light can be thrown on ways now dork at
Kiao Chou.
Tho " Sneer " of tho Speaker.
An anecdote concerning Speaker Reed,
printed tho other day in the Providence
Journal, represented him as saying that
the fact that a certain bill had passed
the Senate without a dissenting voice was
" tho very best reason why it should not
pass tho House."
Our esteemed contemnorarv. the Boston
Herald, regards this remark as of serious
importance, and It rebukes the Speaker for
what it calls "his reported sneer at tho
Senate."
It is Mr. Heed's fortune or misfortune to
bo credited with many utterances of which
ho Is entirely innocent. Like other states
men who havo fairly won a reputation for
InciBlve wit and chain-llghtnlng repartee,
ho has becomo In his turn a convenient
hook on which to hang all sorts of pleasan
tries, both modern and ancient. Ho can
only suffer and be silent.
Perhaps ho never said It.
Perhaps If ho did say It, ho did not mean
It In any sense disrespectful to the Senate,
a body bound to bia own House by living
flesh, even as CnANO was bound to End.
Tho speaker is a philosopher, even before
ho is a wit. Is It not true that a measure
which entirely escaped scrutiny ln one of
two coordinate legislative bodies, ought
for that reason, first of all reasons, to bo
regarded attentively by tho othert
Tho Blcyclo Noso.
It would be unfair to medical science
and to mankind at largo If tho year were
allowed to end without proper attention to
the latest aflllctlon said to bo caused by
bicycling. A recent number of the British
Medical Journal contains this statement
by a physician :
" As a consld-rsble majority of the patients who
have lately consulted me for nasal trouble have com
plained that the sensation of obstruction baa either
cotunit-need or considerably Increased slnoe they have
taken to the bicycle, the question arises: Are we to
plaoe this otherwise healthy and almost necessary
mode of locomotion among the causes of nasal mis
chief? It Is quite conceivable that the qulok rush
through the air. Inhaling large quantities of dust on
the country roads, and all sorts and conditions of dirt
on the London ones, might cause considerable Irrita
tion to the nasal mucous membrane."
So It appears that John Bull has got a
"bicycle nose," and also that tho peculiar,
overstrained countenance known as tho
"blcjclu face" has again been subdivided.
Tho doctor has failed to say whether tbo
blcyclo noso Is peculiar to any ono class ot
wheelmen, but, Inasmuch as It Is supposed
to be produced by " a quick rush through
tho air." It is doubtless mainly character
istic of tho scorcher. Therefore, the blcyclo
face, so far as It distinguishes that loose
Jointed Individual, now embodies four dis
tinct features, namely, tho blcyclo nose, tho
blcyclo eyes, tho bicycle ears, and the
blcyclo jaw.
Perhaps tho differentiation of tho bicycle
noso Is not altogether surprising In view of
somo other developments reported from
over tbo sea. Only a abort time ago Dr.
Destot, ln an account ot his cycling ad
ventures published In the Qazctle des ttopU
taux, declared that "after a long ride he
experienced paresthesia In the fourth and
fifth fingers, with Impaired sensibility, and
paresis In tho intcrossct, lumbrlcales, and
tho adductor polllcls," and that "this
paresis was followed by distinct atrophy in
tho affected muscles."
There Is no reason to suppose, however,
that there is anything bo serious about the
bicycle nose as Is to be found in the alarm
ing condition of Dr. Destot. In this conn-1
try the scorcher had a merry time of it
before thn days of bicycle policemen, yet
he never developed anything worso than (
tho " monkey back " and the " ostrich
neck," Tho only sort of bicycle nose to be
found over here Is the " noso for business "
possessed by tho American whcelmakers.
That peculiarity has its homo hero, and to
Its rapid growth in tho past two years is
duo tho fact that tho American bicycle ts
almost as popular In Europe and Australia
as It Is In the United States.
Tbo blcyclo noso that affects tho nasal
membrano is a total stranger to us. So is
" paresis ln the tutcrossol, lumbrlcales, and
tho adductor polllcls." If they should over
visit tho Greater New York thoy will be
promptly and pitilessly handed over to tho
proper authorities.
A Billy Plooo of Impudenoo.
With comical assurance tho little cllquo
engaged In tho effort to divide the Repub
lican party In this city and State demand
that thoy bo represented in tho appoint
ment of Republican Commissioners ln Ihe
now Police Board. Section 270 of ' tho
Greater Now York charter provides that
of tho four membors of that board "no
moro than two" shall "belong to the same
political party or bo of tho same opinion on
Stato and national politics."
Tho disorganizing cllquo mako their de
mand on tho pretence that thoy are " tho
representatives of tho majority of tho Re
publicans of tho city," and that the genuine
Republican organization "docs not repre
sent tbo Republican party." But who mado
them the representatives of anybody ex
cept themselves, Republicans or otherwise!
Thnv urn Rnlf.nTinnIrtr.ed nnlv ! nnv other
llltlo coterie of Individual Republicans
would havo as much right as they to assume-
to bo tho Republican party.
Tho Citizens' Union movement, in which
these would-bo mischief-makers took part,
expressly disavowed political partisanship.
It had no party color whatever, according
to Its pretensions, but denounced the Intro
duction of " opinions on Stato and national
politics" Into a municipal contest as a
grievous moral and political sin. It was
mado up of Democrats, Mugwumps, and
Republicans, and It nominated a ticket
without any authority entitling it to
representation as a political party
under the provisions of tho charter.
It represented tbo Republican party
no moro than tho Democratio party, and
neither of them, save ln tho volunteer sup
port of Individual Republicans and Demo
crats Independently of their partisan "opin
ions on Stato and national politics." Its
nominations wcro made by a self-appointed
committee, of Democrats, Mugwumps, and
Republicans.
Mayor Van Wyok, therefore, would be
as much justified in yielding to a demand
from tbo Citizens' Union peoplo to appoint
Democratic Police Commissioners ot their
selection as to pay any heed to the resolu
tions passed on Thursday evening that
these bolters should havo the Republican
representation In the bi-partisan Police
Board. Tho resolutions are simply a silly
piece of impudence

TUB EAST Jtimn PARK.
A Project to Oeairay Its Beauty and Charm
and loterrere wlih Its Proper Vae.
To the EoiTon of TnK Sun Sir; I see by the
dally pnpers that at tho last meeting of tbo Park
Commissioners several associations for the
amelioration of tho condition of tho poor and
for tho promotion of nthlotlcs have applied for
tbo use of tbo lovol portion of East River Park,
north of Elgbty-slxth strcoi, as an open-air
gymnnslum.
Tho tract referred to, as I understand, llos just
south of tbo mansion on the north ond of East
River Park, and consists of a lovel piece of
grocnswnrd dotted with largo shade trees of
considerable age. From this point of vantage
tho best views of tbo river are obtained north,
cast and south. On this territory the benevolent
socletios propose to construot a running track,
parallel bars, traDczcs, swings, and all the para
phernalia of an open-air gymnasium, A high
fonco must nccossarlly bo erected around this
tract In order to keep out tho children who can
not bo accommodated within, as well as to pro
tect the little girls who are to uso tho gymna
sium every other day.
Now, I do respectfully protest against the
uso of East River Park lnanyaucb manner as
abovo described, and I do It In full cognizance of
the great value of the benevolent work proposed;
and Its entire practicability as shown by tho
success of the open-air gymnasium In Boston on
tho Charles Hirer. East Rtvor Park is a
nrk of river view, of shaded banks where
thousands of women, little children, and men
tathor to rest and enjoy tho cool of tho evening
or early morning and the charm of tho sur
rounding landscape B iby carriages and moth
ers abound more here than In any othor park of
Blmllarelze In the city. It is a park for rest
nnd quiet snjoyment abovo everything else.
Does It seem fair to theso people, who have
been accustomed to occupy this park, to Intro
duce ths discordant eleraont of the tramp nnd
tho shouting of half-grown boys on running
track and jumping bars penned within a high
fence, shutting out charming views I
It seems to mo, moreover, an lll-odvlscd and
unnecessary desecration of ono of the nios
unique Hnd attractive park landscapes of tho
city. Tbo space It is proposed to occupy covers
onlv about half nn aern and is tho kav nnlnt nf
all the views. It Is covered with grconsward,
chnrmlng to theoyo. and has largo shado trees
on It that ore euro to be injured by tho stress of
gymnasium work.
On tho other band, thero aro park territories
slsenhorothitaro unimproved, havo no shade
trees, no grconswnrd, no views. Ho lovel. and
among a dense population of poor peoplo. Thero
is such a place recently taken by tho city at

-BlsaaUstaetten -a-IIm the Pallor or Both Grant
and Hi-Klnlci.
To ttiis Editor or Tub Scn Sir; Those
who. In other lands, havo taken up arms to re- '
lease themsolves from oppression bnvo always
had the cordial sympathy ot tho peoplo ot tho
United 8tatcs.
The last and most striking proof of this la to
bo found In tho platforms ot tho ranks upon
which the candidates for national ollkcs stood
during tho last Presidential election in respect I
ot the struggle which tho peoplo of Cuba havo
so long and so successfully maintained against '
Spain In behalf of tholr Independence. Upon
every other point tho conventions nhlch oroctod
'those platforms dtftcrod radically. In tholr sov
eral Interiors, discussions upon many othor sub
jects were divergent and bitter, but upon tho
Cuban question tbo convontloiis wcro all unani
mous. They nil agreed that tho peoplo of that
Island should bo free.
This declaration has found expression on tho
hustings, lo Stato Legislatures, in tba halls of
Congress. Tho resolution offered by Senator
Cameron recognizing tho tndopondoncoof tbo
Island was supported by the numerous prece
dents which ho cited, Tbo concurrent resolu
tion which passed tho Senate granting to tbo
combatants tho rights of bolligoronts Is ponding
in tho Houso.
Anomalous as It may appear to those who en
tertain tho opinion tb it ours is a representative
Government whoso duty It is to carry out tho
commands of tho peoplo, tho fact Is that not
withstanding, Indood In desplto of the popular
voice, and notwithstanding what has boon our
course In respect of othor countries, wbero
Cuba has been coticomed the executive branch
of our Government has not only novor been
friendly to that Island, but baa been, on tho con
trary, practically tho ally of Spain. Men and
money. Indeed, havo not been sent to her, but
everything clso necessary to carry on a war sho
has beon permitted to obtain from our shores
without stint.
Her spies havo been allowed to Infest our
ports, ond on their reports our officials have
taken proceedings against tboso who, by them,
have been dcernod guilty of an Infraction of our
neutrality laws. United Statos vessels havo
beon kept on patrol duty to prevent the expedit
ing of supplies to tboso whom sho was fighting,
thus blockading our own porta and coasts
against our own vessels and commerce All this
In behalf of a nation whose form and principles
of government differ entirely from ours, and
against a peoplo who have been pursued vin
dictively by their mother country, who havo
been despoiled by nor nnd have never enjoyed
any right of citizenship except that of paying
taxes.
This. too. when there seems to have boon not
only no obligation, but no excuse for such con
duct. For the ports of Cuba havo always been
open, and Spain has always contended tbat
thero has boon no war on tho Island. If, accord
ing to ber, thero has been and Is no war, there
can be no contraband of war. Taking ber at her
word, therefore, any vessel bad, and has, tbe
right to clear from any port ln this country for
any port in Cuba, carrying no matter what
charactor ot cargo or what numbor of passen
gers, and to proceed on ber voyage unchal
lenged. Should she meet a United States vessel,
that vessol should. If necessary, afford ber as
sistance and protection, and not capture ber or
turn her back; and no vessel belonging to Spain
would have tho right to binder or molost ber
while sho was on high seas.
The ships of our navy were nover Intended to
act as a coast guard for other nations. Ii ts not
our province to eoe that their laws are not vio
lated within the limits of tbelr own jurisdiction.
Yet this is precisely tbe uso to which many of
them have been put.
If it be said that these vessels so used were
nocessary to Intercept any hostile expedition
which might sail from onr Bhorcs, the answer Is
that no hostile expedition could be organized
except In ono of our ports, and this could not be
done without tho knowledgo of tho law officers
of tbe Government, wbocould easily brosk It up.
Tho proof of this answer Is found In tbo fact
thU no such expedition has been organized hero
since the present rebellion In Cuba broke out
Many acts of omission as well as of commis
sion were charged against President Grant dur
ing bis administration of the affairs of the
Government. Of them all the most conspleuoua
was his refusal to acknowledge the belligerent
rights of the Cubans, who were then In revolt
against Spain and Qghtlng for Independence.
nis message ln support of his courso ahowed a
lack of appreciation of the facts, nnd did
not state tho law as It Is laid down by Inter
national Jurists of authority. It was against
precedent. Our people could not understand
President Grant's logic, which, vrhilo It admlttod
that fighting bad been going on for ten years,
denied that war existed. They believed
tbat If war existed, tbe parties tboreto were
equally entitled to belligerent rights, and tbat
the hospitality of our country should not be
enjoyed by out of the combatants exclusively.
Thoy consldcrod that tho facts and tho law were
both against him. They also believed that ho
had violated the precedents sot by President
Monroo, who, under circumstances similar to
those which were boforo blm, not only granted
to Spain's South Amorican colonists belligerent
rights, bu neknowlodgod their Independence;
and that be nad forgotten likewise tho prece
dent set by Spain herself when she hastened to
accord belligerent rights to tbe peoplo of the
South when our troubles thero began.
One ot tbe principal arguments Gen. Grant
used In support of bis courso was that the
Cubans had possession of no port. Ot what use
would one have been to them I If they bad
captured one, It would have been rendered un
tenable by Spanish war vessels, or so closely
watched that tbey would not havo received any.
thing through It. Bcaldes, tbey bud no vessels
and would not have been allowed to sail under
a flng If they possessed them, and this because
of their non-recognition as belligerents. Con
sequently tho seas were prohibited to them and
no port would have availed tbem anything.
The question was not whether tbey bad vessels
on the seas or whether there Hero ports open to
their ontry, but whether they were combatants
with an army In tho Held, A ten yoars' war
answered that question,
It Is not, thcroforo, surprising that many of
President McICinley's best friends aro disap
pointed that ho Bhould have followed so closely
the course pursued by President Grant, opposite
as It waa to tho ono pursued by President Mon
roo, This Is tho more disappoint Inc. because
tbo facts under which President Grant actod
resemble only as a molo bill resembles a moun
tain the facta as they exlstod when President
McKinley Indited bis message.
It Is true that In Prcsldout Qrant's message
he stated tbat numerous engagements had
taken placo between tho Insurgents and tbo
Spanish troops, and that much property had
been destroyed, but ho roushlorod that theso
engagements had not raised tho Btrugglo tu
tbo Importance of a war; and It Is a fact that,
notwithstanding tbCBO em.'ngcnicnts nnd de
struction of property, our comiucrco wllb tho
Island had not beon disturbed materially. We
