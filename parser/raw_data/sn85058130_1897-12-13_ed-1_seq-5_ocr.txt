DR RAVLIIsS LECTURE
DB
The doctor prefaced his address by
replying to a criticism made by an
ev ening paper on his last Sundays lec
ture He challenged a debate upon the
theory that Adam the man God was
or was not the result of the evolutions
in natures laboratories
i Dr Ravlin elaborated upon his views
of the principles underlying the mole
cular construction of worlds and the
Darwinian theory of evolution and
followed with an exposition of his be
lief in the necessity and opportunity of I
establishing his church in the local
field When in the midst of his themS I
feid tw theI
ht declared that the principles taught I
lj Jesus Christ were socialistic com I
munistic and humanitarian and that
they were broken up in Jerusalem by I
the same influences that were trying to
disrupt the United States today by
arraying the rich and powerful against
the poor and weak The history of
American jurisprudence he likened to
that of a family of Shylocks
Mr Ravlin enlarged upon the cardi
nal principles set forth in the resolu
tions He asserted that the organiza
tion not church theologically
> tcn was a theologicly
speaking and he expressed the belief
that fully a thousand free thinkers
were in this city and would identify
themselves with the body a organized
it they cared naught for the slighting
remarks of those who saw fit to criti
cise them
The meeting commenced by the doc
tor announcing The assembly will
sing America My Country Tis of
Thee etc a it used to be and as we
trust it will he again
At the close a brief benediction was
pronounced Several announcements
were made one that a musical and dramatic
matic entertainment would be given at
Unity hall Tuesday evening for the
benefit of the church

Idaho and Wyoming and in the terri

ments at 3 number of places notably
at Springville and Heber City in Utah
have marked the week just passed
Many new applications during that
time will result in a material increase
of the Rocky mountain membership in
the near future
F A Taylor of Montana will soon
take charge of the state of Idaho as
state deputy and as the sir knight has
made an enviable record as an organ I
izer under the general direction of Sir
Knight Newell of his state the work I
in the state of Idaho will be in good I j
hands and much is expected in the
way of advancing the order in that
mountain state
A special effort will soon be made to
spread the order within the state of
Nevada All towns on the line of the
Southern Pacific within the state will
doubtless be visited by deputies during
the winter now upon us and by the
early spring the establishment of the
order in that state will be assured and
well advanced
The general deputy supreme com
mander Mr Wright of this city will
doubtless visit Ogden and Carbon I

Evergreen lodge No 151 Fraternal
union met last Monday The officers
must have felt flattered at the large
number present for it is a wellknown
rule that with poor or unpopular of
ficers of a lodge in power the members
stay away from the meetings The
hal was filled in fact the attendance I
is so phenomenal at each meeting that
the lodge took action to secure a
larger meeting place commencing
with Jan 1 1898
I After this month the order will re
turn to the Odd Fellows temple and
meet in the large hal on the second
floor The advantage to the lodge is
recognized when it is stated that there
is every convenience for a large as
semblage supper room and all con
veniences connected therewith ample
space when an entertainment is given
and nearness to street cars in every
direction
A large number of members were
initiated Monday and seemed espec
ially gratified at their entrance into
the order The insurance features are
such that all members are anxious to
secure all they can as in addition to I
the protection to their little ones it I
also provides accident benefits to the
insured without extra cost Tonight I
another large number will be initiated
000
While not receiving as large acces
sions to the ranks of the Grand Army
of the Republic as many of its san
guine members predicted for the past
year there has been quite an increase
in the rolls of McKean and Maxwell
posts showing that some of the com
rades have been zealously working for
that object and i is estimated that
the increase during the coming year
will be far greater than that of any
previous year Many of the comrades
I who are locating h Salt Lake City and
I vicinity have indicated that as they
I make their homes here they will iden
tify themselves with one or the other
I of these posts of which determination
the Salt Lake comrades should not al
low themselves to fail in carrying out
This evening will be an Important
I one for James B McKean post as the
annual election of post officers and
representatives to the sixteenth de
partment encampment will be held and
in order to meet with success the of
ficers who will be elected to conduct its
allairs the comIng year should be ac
tive energetic comrades who will
I make personal sacrifices that the post
may prosper and that such shall bs
assured the presence of every member
will be necessary this evening
> < j > < i >
Why is it that so many Odd Fellows
fail to attend lodge
There is a cause or perhaps many
causes for this One of the causes is
the lack of attention to the social side
I you read the various articles which
are written if you listen to the vari
ous addresses which are made in the
different lodge rooms you will find
they all bear one refrainthey are
all pregnant with the same spirit
work We hear work we see work
we talk work until the very air Is
permeated with it and even breathing I
becomes laborious Does the conduct
of the business of our lodges and the I
general welfare and advancement of
the order require incessant and un i
remitting work Is it necessary for
our material advancement to labor incessantly
I
cessantly Many will answer with
out hesitation i is Granted But
does work include merely the confer I
ring of degrees In our judgment we
have paid and are paying too little
attention to the social side of our
work No person in a position to
know will deny that the attendance at
the Rebekah lodges is much better
than at the subordinates They pay a
great deal of attention to the social I
functions and they mingle business
and pleasure gaiety and gravity and
the result is better attendance better
results greater social enjoyment and
more and better work
Man is a social animal He re
quires and will have relaxation and I
if we can furnish it to him in the Icdtro
room we will secure his presence and i
if we cannot he will seek it elsewhere j I
I is not sufficient to say the order is I
not a vast social club that it is not I
designed to furnish amusement True
but it is designed to promote the wel
fare of its member socially morally
and intellectually
intelectualy
Have them as often as possibleonce
a month at least and you will find that
not only Avill your attendance be bet i
tel but you will be surprised how I
much latent energy and Intellect had i
lain dormant in your lodge unde
veloped for lack of opportunityJ B

Her Famous Trial For Murder
Kansas City Star Now that Mrs Min

vindicated by the Chicago coroner and
appears in a fair way to obtain the
thousands left by the late Mr Ketcham
her attorney Thomas Fenlon of Leaven
worth who defended her in Kansas most
famous DoisonluET trial has grown re
miniscent While there were prospects of
another trial Mr Fenlon was extremely
reticent His memory on this particular
case was poor it was only one case of
hundreds he said in which he had In 40
years practice acted as one of the at
torneys and moreover it was an incon
venient time to answer ciuestiom But
since there Is no promise of another ex
perience in court for Mrs Ketcham he
nas recovered his faculties of recollection
recolec
tion amazingly and is now shedding his
tory like a longshelved politician Yes
terday he quite unraveled himself
I shall never forget the day 1 arrived
in Emnorla after being culled to take
charge of Mrs Wallaces side of the case I
At the station there was n howling mob
of excited men They had heard I was
coming and seemed determined to lynch j
the womans lawyer preparatory to giv I
ing the woman a similar experience j
They dldnti touch me however but
di
followed me up to the hotel and yelled I
and threatened some more When 1 went
over to the jail I thought it was all up
this time The mob was frantic The
sheriff and his deputies began loosening
up their belts so as to get at their guns
easr We vere all frightened but the
woman She was our savior and her own
as well She said Let me see them
The sheriff led her out of her cell and
to a window Well I wouldnt have be
lieved It i I hadnt seen i but you
should have seen that mob quiet down
Every man of them shut his yelping
mouth as if he had been whipped for i
Thev stopped their howling and after
Mrs Wallace was taken back to her cell
they crept away You know shes a
beautiful woman you can see that from
her pictures even i youve never seen
her She had mar nerve than any man
I ever defended While she was at the
window shb ottly stood and looked out
I wasnt defiance nor content it was
something in the woman dont know
what it was but it certain mde that
mob feel small
I was that way all through the trial
The people vacillated between a danger
ous state bordering on riot to a condi
tion that almost made them tear down
the jail doors and set hor free Theyd
have strung her up half an hour after
wards Ive no doubt The trial only
lasted ten days and when the jury said
Not guilty you could have heard the
cheers in Topeka if youd had good ear
When I started home from Em > oria
that same mob that ten days before was
read to lynch me unhitched the horses
from mi cab grabbed the tongue arid
pulled me down to the train I tell you

They say that Seattle is making claims
of advantages that are altogether un
founded the fact being that from Salt

to Portland the rate is the same as to I

The S P Will Mot Hold Its Trains
at Ogden
San Francisco Chronicle Manager J
A Filbnore of the Southern Pacific Is on
the warpath He declared yesterday that
he will force eastern roads to change
their timetables or else he will hereafter
pull westbound passenger trains out of
Ogden on schedule lime and leave the be
lated trains of other roacis In Ogden and
take the full and deserved blame for their
inability to make their runs from Chicago
on advertised time J
I am tired of these delays he said
and I mean t put an end to them right
here They have been occurring regularly
for over three months past
The fault Is with the Denver Rio
Grande and the Rio Grande Western to I
gether as connecting roads and with the i
Union Pacific Seventylive per cent of
the time the Southern Pacific is kept
waiting at Ogden for one or the other of I
these lines When one is on time the
other is late I we come away from Og I
den without waiting there is a howl and j
to would be one howl and then the other
so oeu have rt JWl I
The Union Pacific is not BO bad as the I I
Denver Rio Grande but it is bad
enough I
The whole cause of the trouble is that I
those lines have faster schedules than I
they can make I Is all for an advertis i j
ing record I is not possible for them to i
come through on pcnedule time except I
under the most favorable circumstances I
r1rer ought to leave Chicago two hours
earlier i
This subject has been a matter of con
troversy between myself and the mana
gers or those roads for the last three
months Each would blame the other but
I I proved that some of them were deliber
ately lying and i sent back their several
claims and left them to fight it out among
themselves
I have asked them to start from Chi
cago earlier but they will no nothing
Now I am going to do something
The Southern Pacific has been get
ting the blame for trains arriving here
late But I know whose fault it is We
get the record of every day from Og
den showing just when these trains get
in there
Ninetyfive per cent of the recent ar
rivals here on time was due to the mak
ing up of time by the Southern Pacific
from Ogden to this city But this fast
running must stop It is not safe In win
ter and over our mountainous and rough
I sections of road I shall not permit it I
I after this Our trains will come through
j I on schedule time but they will not take
i chances tryin gto make up for the other
i roads delays beyond Ogden
We might change our schedule to as
to leave Ogden three or four hours later
but that would bring our trains into Oak
land after the last night ferry A spe
cial boat would have to be fun the street
cars here would not be running and the
passengers would not be satisfied
No the change must be made at the
other end and if we have to pull out of
Ogden with empty cars or with passen
gers that arrive too late to catch our pre
ceding regular train
The Denver Rio Grande the Rio
Grande Western and the Union Pacific
may deny that they are to blame for all
these delays but it they do deny It they
are lying for I have the records here

The Bails Spread
Gilroy Cal Dec 12The local north
bound passenger train running between
Hollister and Gilroy was wrecked at a
point about four miles south of Gilroy
about 1 p m today The train which
was in charge of G W Clark a veteran
conductor had just slowed up to pass
over the long trestle spanning the Pajoro
river and had just began to make good
headway when the ngine pulling the
train jumped the rsak on an embank
ment about 15 feet nigh toppled over on
its side into the bottom of the ditch En
gineer S J Lynch and Fireman Madison
Rockfeller remained at their posts and
ware thrown violently to the ground The
engineer was not hurt but Fireman Rock
teller sustained severe injuries He was
taken to San Francisco for treatment He
will probably recover The passengers
were not injured The accident is at
tributed to spreading of the rails
Another Wreck
Wilkesbarre Pa Dec 12A heavy
freight train crashed into a train of
empty coal cars in the Vossburg tunnel
on the Lehigh Valley railroad this morn
ing blocking the tunnel completely The
wreck took fire and burned furiously all
day Engineer John Thomas and his
fireman James DeF Egan ware terribly
hurt The other trainmen escaped injury
but they had the greatest difficulty in
making their escape from the tunnel
crawling for SOO fest
THE FRAUD ZAWOLL
Facts About the Antecedents of the
Crooked Barber
New York Dec 12 Charles Zanoll
who is suspected of having killed four
of his five wives and three other per
sons for the purpose of collecting in
surance money on their lives is still a
prisoner at police headquarters He
continues his protestations of inno
cence of foul deeds In his conversa
tion Zanoli expresses himself as being
more than ready to help the detectives
toward the solution of all doubtful
questions and Chief Detective Mc
Cluskey acknowledges that the prisoner
has offered him assistance in clearing
some of the details of the investiga
tion which have cost much time and
trouble
The police have learned that the
young woman who had been selected by
Zanoli as his fifth wife just before his
arrest on Thursday last is Barbara
Holfner 25 years of age a resident of
Brooklyn She had answered an ad
vertisement of Zanoli under the name
of C Wagner
Zanoli has a smattering knowledge
of medical things which he gained in i
his apprenticeship for the trade of bar j
ber in Germany He is able to pull i
teeth and to perform the operation i
known as cupping and is familiar with
the blister raised after the cupping
process It is possible Chief Mc
Cluskey thinks that he may be pos i
sessed of the same general knowledge
of deadly drugs
The police are now satisfied that Za
noli did not make away with the child
Lena Werna daughter of one of the
prisoners dead wives The girl is now
in Germany with her relatives The
body of Jennie Schlessinger the fourth
wife will be exhumed tomorrow
NO HOPE FOR CARR
Child Murderer Will Be Executed On
Dater Fixed
Jefferson City Mo Dec 12 Govern
or Stephens today in replying to Rev
Lee Ewing of Liberty Mo who pre
sented a numerously signed petition
I asking a postponement of the execu
tion of William Carr the child mur
derer said he could not interfere un
less a stay of execution was asked bry
the trial judge and prosecuting attor
ney He thought it best said Rev Ew
ins to a reporter to inform Carr that
there is no hope for him that he had
best prepare to meet his God on Dec
17 Preparations for the execution are
progressing It is not believed that the
court officials will intervene
The Pope and Canada
Rome Dec 12It is reaffirmed here
that Sir Wilfred Laurier the Dominion
premier asked the Vatican to establish
a nunciature in Canada Baron
Charles Russell lord chief justice of
England came to Rome about the end
of last month to repeat the request
It is probable therefore that the denial
of the report issued from Ottawa was
for electoral considerations and leads
to the supposition that nothing will be
done in the matter
