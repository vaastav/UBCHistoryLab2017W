THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
For logic, force, and skillful arrangement, the message delivered 'by
President Wilson before Congress last Tuesday is perhaps unequalled by
any other state document ever uttered by a governmental head. While
abruptly and unequivocably asking Congress to declare this country in a
state of war with the Austrian government, again the President recites the
tsauses that led us into the greatest of all conflicts, and again disavows any
selfish purpose of America to encroach upon the German nation beyond forc
ing the annihilation of the present "unspeakable" regime. That the '
President is unalterable in his determination to prescute the war to a suc
cessful finish is summed up in the brief paragraph of his message, which
1adS" "The cause being just and holy, the settlement must be of like mo
tive and quality. For this we can fight, but for nothing less noble
or less worthv of our traditions. For this cause we entered the war,
and for this cause will we battle untfl THE LAST GUN IS FIRED."
To some it may not be clear why the President' failed to embrace
Turkey and Bulgaria with Austria in asking for a declaration of, war, as
he acknowledged that the logic of the situation naturally called for such
action. Austria has become an ally and tool of Germany in the war. Tur
' key and Bulgaria likewise are tools of Germany. "But," says President
Wilson, "they are mere tools, and do not yet stand in the direct path of
our necessary action." Continuing, he says: "We shall go wherever the
necessities of this war carry us, but it seems to me that we should go only
where immediate and practical consideration lead us, and not need any
others."
There can be no doubt that the country will be unanimous with the
president in what he has asked of Congress in his latest message, and that
body will grant in full measure what has been asked of it. Indeed It seems
; likely that the declaration of war may be made to include Turkey and Bul-
garia, as well as the Austrian-Hungarian empire, regardless of the execu
tive suggestion. v
. " """" """""
Reports have gained currency from time to time that certain Medina
boys now in France have been captured by the Germans. Such reports in
the absence of opportunity for verification are aggravating, to say the
least, to the relatives of the boys, as well as to their friends at home. It
should be known, however, that every casualty, at home or abroad, is im
mediately wired or cabled to officials at Washington, being relayed ftm
there without loss of time to the emergency address of the soldier or sailor
affected. It is also at once released for publications in the newspapers. No
news of casualties has or will be held up.

COURT HOUSE NEWS j I
'
"Conquest and Kultur Aims of the Germans' in their own words," is
the title of a government publication just issued by the committee on public
information, a copy of which has been received at the Sentinel office. It
Is a book of nearly 200 pages, devoted entirely to quotations from the
Kaiser, German statesmen and scholars and the German press, during the
past half dozen or more years, proving conclusively that the present war
was welcomed and even sought by the Teuton government with the sole
view of ultimate world domination. A few extracts will indicate the tenor
of each and all of the others:
"The whole history of the world is neither more nor less than a
preparation for the time when it shall please God to allow the affairs
of the universe jx be in German hands."
"We are morally and intellectually superior to all, without peers.
It is the same with our organizations and with our institutions."
"Still and deep in the German heart must live the joy of battle
and the longing for it. Let us ridicule to the utmost the old women
in breeches who fear war and deplore it as cruel and revolting. No,
war is beautiful."
