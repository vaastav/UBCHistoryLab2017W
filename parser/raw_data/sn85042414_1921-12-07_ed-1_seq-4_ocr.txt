Following the constitutional provision that the '3:~
president sha^l from time to time inform congress
of the state of the nation, President Harding ha& ad

of its regular session. It is natural that he should

international agreement for limitation of armament
and for the elimination of causes likely to produce
war. This work has been very near the president's
