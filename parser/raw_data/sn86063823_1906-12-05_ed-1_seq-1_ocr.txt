HAGERMAN
WORKING AT WASHINGTON TO
SECURE THE GOVERNOR'S
REMOVAL.
DISORGANIZED PARTY
Democratic Gains - Charged to His
Efforts-for - Good Government.
President Roosevelt to Be Petition
ed to Oust Him. Andrew to Man
age the Campaign.
St. Louis Republic Special.
Santa ' Fe, N. M., Dec. 2. Herbert
J. Hagerman, New - Mexico's 1 young
millionaire Governor, known through
- out the Southwest as tde Territory's
first reform Governor, is to be ousted
from his office. If the plans of the
old political leaders are successful.
President Roosevelt is to be peti
tioned to remove Hagerman for the
"good of the party," because it is
charged, he has disorganized the Re
publican party by his reform move
ments. Other charges will be made
in the bill of particulars, which will
"be filed with the President, but this
one is the most serious offense laid
against Mr. Hagerman, and is one
upon which the leaders rely to se
cure action from. President Roosevelt
The fight upon Hagerman Is to
be relentless, and to end only when
he has been forced out of office. It
will be managed by W. H. AmJrews,
..Delegate to Congress from New
Mexico, and H. O. Bursum, chairman
of the Republican Territorial Com
mittee. Major V. H. H. Llewellyn, a
former officer in Roosevelt's regi
ment of Rough Riders, will conduct
IKatiAttla of tho Whftn Hniiso It la
-said the war on Hagerman will also
have the moral and financial support
of Sol Luna, National Committeeman
from New Mexico. Thus far Luna
Cias failed to show open hostility to
-ae present administration.
The battle to seoure Hagerman's
scalp, which will be transferred from
New Mexico to Washington within
the next ten days, has been in prog
ress for months, but has just become
public. It began when Governor Ha
german called for the resignation of
Chairman Bursum from the suoerin-
tendeney of the Territorial peniten
tiary. Hagerman. charged irregulari
ties in Bursum's accounts, and an
expert's testimony showed an appar
ent shortage of nearly $10,000.
Bursum's removal was followed by
the ousting of several Territorial of
ficials, including the Attorney Gen
eral. These have all joined the anti
Hagerman movement.
Campaign is Begun.
Andrews has been selected . to
manage the campaign In Washing
ton, with Major Llewellyn's assist
ance, while Bursum will look after
the fight In New Mexico. Bursum is
; to flood the White House with peti
tions from New Mexico, calling for
Hagerman's resignation. Already the
old organization has begun a system
atic campaign to secure names for
f the petitions.
- Andrews has been selected to look
: after the congressional end of the
fight, because he claims that he will
' have the solid support of the Penn
sylvania delegation in Congress. He
; formerly lived in Pennsylvania, and
for years "was a political leader there
before coming to New Mexico. About
a year, ago 'he received much notorl
5 .ety when the Enterprise National
, Bank of Pittsburg failed.
At the recent election Andrews
was chosen for a second term as the
New Mexico delegate to Congress by
a majority of fifty-five. The normal
, Republican majority in New Mexico
Is 6.000 to-10,000. The small majorf
"mty received ty Andrews will be the
principal argument used by Governor
" Hagerman'a enemies to secure a
promise from the President '. to oust
f Hagerman. Andrews came so near
'defeat that his Democratic rival Is
. going to contest his election, charg
ing gross frauds in the count of je
ballots. His nearness to defeat is all
blamed upon Governor , Hagerman,
ana u nu oe representee - to jar.
Roosevelt that it was the" Governor's
"fool" reforms that almost caused
New Mexico being lost to the Repub
licans. Hagerman's friends are prepared
to combat these claims. They declare
Andrews was cut by the Republicans
of the Territory because of his rec
ord, and his close associations with
Mr. Bursum, and that his vote cannot
be taken as the normal Republican
vote. They also say that Governor
Hagerman was not responsible for
the slashing of the ballots, and point
to the landslide of otfeer candidates
of the Republican party.
Statehood Vote an index.
Hagerman's, supporters declare the
statehood vote must be the one tak
en as an example of the real Repub
lican sentiment in the Territory.
This, President Roosevelt's pet mea
sure, carried by a . majority of more
than 11,000. The majority was en
tirely due to the efforts of Governor
Hagerman, for when he was aiKint
ed, less than a year ago, all the
leaders of the party were opposed to
jointure with Arizona, and the Terri
torial Central Committee pase
resolutions against the proposition.
Through Hagerman's work a plank
was inserted In the Republican plat
form, pledging the support of the
party to statehood. That it carried
in spite of the opposition of the
bosses, who are now hunting the
Governor's scalp, is declared to sig
nally and vividly illustrate the senti
ment of the people of the Territory.
Should the efforts of the party
leaders to oust Hagerman fail, the
fight will not be dropped. It will be
carried into the Territorial Legisla
ture. The bosses claim to control a
working majority in the Legislature,
and they say If President Roosevelt
refuses to act upon their recommen
dations, they will pass measures at
the next session depriving the Gov
ernor of all his patronage and power,
except that vested in him by the
Federal organic act. and taking away
the appropriation for the contingent
expenses of rals office.

COUNCILMAN JUMP WALKED
OUT OF THE MEETING.
There was to aaVe been- a city
council meeting last night. In fact,
a meeting whs opened, but t did not
continue long. Wiien the sessiou waa
warming up right on the paving
question a svid.lc quietus was put
to the proceeltngs by Councilman
Jump deliberately walking from the
room and leaving the council, then
without a quorum, stricken dumb
with . consternation and in a quanda-1
ry as to what to do and even as to
what they COULD do. The final out
come was that fhe body adjourned
subject to the call of the Mayor,
The councilmen in attendance, were
Wyllys, Whiteman, Bell, Jump, Wise
ley and Church. After the reading
of the minutes Mayor Stockard call
ed for the reports of committees. The
chairman of the finance committee
was absent. Chairman Wiseley, of
the streets and alleys committee,
said that the streets were speaking
for themselves just now, but that the
report of City Engineer Dills, on the
matter of estimates and opinions on
the paving of Main street, called for
at the last meeting, would be ap
propriate at this time. Accordingly
the report was read. The adoption
of a resolution, as provided by law,
calling officially for this report and
for a consultation with the property
owners as to the quality of street
improvement desired, was under con
sideration when the "walk-out" oc
curred, Although all the members
present seamed to be in favor of
street improvement, there were - sev
eral minor points that brought out
discussion, and these remarks drag
ged over considerable ' time. One
point was as to whether the coun
cil would make the resolution read
in a way to make the paving sub
ject to the will of the majority of
property owners affected. It was
Councilman Jump's idea to make
this condition appear in the resolu
tion, but the condition was eliminat
ed. Councilman Whiteman wanted
the resolution' to read not only to
pave Main street from Alameda to
Fifth and Fifth from Main to the
depot, but also to pave the cross
streets fn that district one block each
way from Main. This amendment
was brought up several times by
Councilman Whiteman, and the last
time he rose to present it for a vote
was the signal which started Coun
cilman Jump to his feet. Without a
word he passed out of the room.
A Record reporter questioned him
as to the cause of his sudden depar
ture, and he said that 'he was tired
of listening to the wrangling, and
that If the councilmen were going
to spend the evening talking, he had
more important business to attend
to. After Councilman Jump's depar
ture, the remainder of the body con
sidered taking the means provided
by law of 'having him returned by
force, but It was decided best to
wait until another night for a meet
ing. None of the bills were paid and
none of the important business plan
ned for the evening iiad come up and'
the councilmen were incensed - at
Councilman Jump's action, and upon
their advice Mayor Stockard repri
manded Mr.1 Jump this morning.. The
meeting will be resumed Thursday
night, when arrangements will be
made to have a quorum present.
The. report of City Engineer Dills
will be printed in -full tomorrow.
The U." D. C. will meet with Mrs.
R. L. Bradley corner of Penn and
Fifth street, Thursday afternoon at
fhree -o'clock. The place of meeting
has been changed on account of ill
ness in Mrs. Williamson's family. A
full attendance is desired. Mrs. B.

Flames.
Chicago, Dec. 5. Train No. 63 on
the Monon road, which is the fast
limited of that line between Cincin
nati and Chicago, was derailed early
today two miles " north of Frankfort,
Indiana, by a broken rail. Eighteen
passengers out of a total of 175 on
the train, , were injured," but nobody
was killed, and it is not believed that
any of 'the injured will die. The
train was going at a high rate of
speed and a- rail broke beneath the
engine, which, however, passed the
place in safety. All the baggage and
mail cars, coaches and sleepers left
the track and some of them were
badly damaged. There is no embak
ment at the scene of the accident,
and the cars merely plowed their
way along the ground at the side of
the track for a considerable distance
before being brought to a stop.
-. Conductor Mort Mason, of Indian
apolis was bruised. The five passen
gers most seriously injured were
Frank Kelly, Frankfort, Ind., cut
and bruised; M. L. Davis, Frankfort,
Ind., wrist broken ; David Mabbctte.
Mason, Ind.,. bruised and cut about
the head. All the injured were en
route to the Chicago Fat Stock show.
They were taken to Cambria.
Explosion in Match Factory.
Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 5. Eight
girls ' were perhaps fatally burned
and crushed in the panic caused by
an explosion in a match factory in
West Indianapolis today.
Ten girls were at work on the
second floor of the factory when an
explosion in the fire proof storage
vault forced the door and hurled a
sheet of flame across the work room.
They rushed for the stairway which
soon became choked with the strug
gling girls, screaming and. fighting,
with blazing hair and clothing. Three
girls penned in by the flames and
unable to reach the stairway jumped
through windows to the ground. At
the stairway several girls fell and
were trampled upon. Two girls made
an unsuccessful effort to get to the
Are apparatus, and then devoted
their efforts ,to beating out the fire
on their fellow employees. The fore
woman of the factory reached the
telephone and while calling the fire
department others smotherd the fire
on her burning clothes. The injured
were taken to their homes in am
bulances. WOMAN ON TRIAL
CHARGED WITH MURDER.
Hazelhurst, Miss., Dec. 5. The tri
al on the charge of murder of Mrs.
Angie Bird song, a young member
of one of the most prominent fami
lies in Mississippi, begins today. The
choosing of the jury was nearly com
pleted yesterday.
Mrs. Bird song shot and killed Dr.
T. H. Butler, , also a member of a
prominent family and nephew of
former Governor Longino of Mississ
ippi, Nov. 25, 1905. The shooting oc
curred at Dr. Butler's office, in Mon
ticello, Miss., where Mrs." Birasong
resided. The young, woman went to
his office, waited until a patient com
pleted an interview with the physi
cian and then entering Dr. Butler's
presence fired five shots. Going to
the street, she remarked to the ga
thering crowd that-(they would find
the result of - her work up stairs In
the doctor's office, and then surren
dered herself to the sheriff. r Although
admitting the shooting, 'she -has not
let her line of defense become
known, and interest in the case has
been heightened by the subsequent
Indictment of her husband on . the
charge of being accessory. He will
not, however, be tried-at the present
term of couTt.
A few days : before the shooting
Mrs. Birdsong attempted suicide. At
the preliminary hearing her mother-in-law
testified that the prisoner had
experienced extreme mental agita
tion over rumors concerning her
e". aracter. The. prominence of both
families in the case and the intense
j Taeling . in Monticello caused change
of venue to be granted. Mrs. Bird
song is about 22 years of age, and
her youth and the presence in court
of two small children have already
exerted, a strong sympathetic effect
on the case, making the choice of a
jury difficult. Among the special
counsel present at the trial are Sen
ator McLaurin and former Governor
Longino.
SIXTY LIVES LOST IN
FLOOD AT CLIFTON, A. T.
Denver, Colo., Dec. 5. A special
to the News from Phoenix, Arizona,
says : "Private railroad dispatches
received here say that sixty lives

Arizona Copper Co. and tearing out
miles of track of the Arizona and
Mexico railroad.. Clifton, which lias
about 3,500 people, lies in a narrow
valley near the eastern line of Ari
zona. The less prosperous of the in

years ago twelve lives were lost in
the canyon, and immense damage
was done by the rise of the San
Francisco river.
