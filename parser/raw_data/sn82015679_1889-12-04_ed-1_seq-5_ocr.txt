HOW IT WAS RECEIVED.
Democrats and Republicans Alike Speak
Favorably of the President's 3Iesage.
Special to tl.A Indianapolis Journal-
Washington, Dec 3. President Harri
son' message received a very thoughtful
hearing in, Congress to-day. In the Senate
it was observed that the oldest and most
sagacious of the statesmen listened to the
reading of the document with tho greatest
interest. Senator John Sherman scarcely
took his eyes off the Secretary from "the
time he began to read the message till the
last word of it was uttered. Messrs. Kvart,
Hawley, IngaUs. Allison ami tho Nebraska
Senators were among thone on the Kepnb
lican side who sat almost motionless during
the readicc, and drank in every word of
the document. It was interesting to
note the facial expreasson of the Senators
on the Democratic side during the reading
of the mesnafre. Vest of Missouri, Jiutlvr
and other long-headed Democrats Were
compelled by the business tact and states
rnanship displayed in tho message to treat
it with tlit greatest possible consideration.
One could have heard a pin drop at almost
any period while the message was being
read.
In the House of Representatives, a body
containing S30 members, many of whom
have never bad any trjing experience in
public life, there was not as much thought
fulness shown while the message was be
ing read as in the other branch of Congress,
but it was observed that ail cf those who
have served in a past Congreai. or who are
noted as successful business men or poli
ticians, listened to every word of the read
ins. i here is but one comment made upon the
President's message to-niuht, and it is that
of commendation. The message is referred
to as a common-sensH, terun, concise, in
cisive, business document. Even the most
virulent Democrats acknowlege. the
wonderful comprehension of the man who
prepared the message, and especially his
ability to gra.p tho mot complicated
questions and tre;t them in a manner so
timple that tho ordinary citizen cau under
stand. Usually-public men have expressed
opinions upon i'residents' messages very
Irtrcly, but thou who heard its reading this
afternoon hesitate to express themselves,
fcjvinc tbey have not had timo to digest it,
nrl that it covers so many subjects a Rec
ord reading will be required by most per
sons to fully comprehend the document as
a whole.
Special comment is made upon the pen
mou question, and soldiers in and out of
Congress arc greatly pleasjd with it. The
President has demonstrated that ho intends
to maintain the position he occupied dur
ing the campaign last year, and in tho ex
ecutive mansion stand by the soldier ns he
did in private life. Those who are inter
ested in pensions nro now fully convinced
that tho removal of Corporal Tanner, in
stead of being a detriment to them, will
operate as a blessing, sinco the President
1ks renewed his vowa in favor of tho pen
sioner and Commissioner Katim has almost
trebled the capacity of the Pension Office
iu oispoMDKoi applications.
The- declaration respecting the with-kawalof-government
iunds deposited in
national bauks is approved on every baud.
Men in Congress will back tho President
nu in this policy, and insist that the reduc
tion of )oaus to banks shall be made swift
and brought down to the minimum. In a
word, the message is so favorably received
hy men in Congress, and is so complete that
vit is accepted a. a fair outline of the gen
eral legislation Congress will enact at tho
present session.
Tho message was handled by the pres3
associations very conveniently and iully.
It was put into type at tho Government
lrinting Office on Friday, and the tirst
roof was pulled on Saturday morning.
'J he President corrected the proof-sheet on
Saturday afternoon, and yesterday it was
riuted. Ninety copies ivero placed in the
lands of Colonel Crook of the Whito liouse
start" of clerks, who took them to New
i ork, whence the message was distributed
throughout the country. The admirable
manner in which the message was laid be-.
fore the country through the prer.s and the
telegraph is duo to Private Secretary Hal
lord, who has given the work his personal
attention.
Kepresentative OT)onnell of Michigan,
thinks President Harrison's message on
the whole a strong document. He approves
the recommendation to revise the tarirl
and enlarge the free list, and thinks it
wonld be wise to remove the duties on
such articles as do not come in competi
tion with products of our farms and fac
' tones. He docs not, however, indorse the
lresident's recommendation to abolish the
tax on tobacco. lie thinks the people can
pay that tax easily, and he would rather
repeal the duty on 6iigar.
Comment of the London lr.
London, Doc 4. The Morning Post says:
'If President Harrison carries out in
practice the peaceful and progressive prin
ciples indicated in his message, the whole
'world will be gainers thereby."
The Times welcomes the extradition pro
posal, and expressed surprise that the
"Western States do not revolt tgaiust tho
Leavy exactions of taxation imposed for
the benetit of the cotton and iron-workers
of the Atlantic States. It says: "Presi
lint Harrison probable had this in mind
when ho suggested that the protective
principle should be applied to farm prod
ucts." The Standard thinks that tariff reform
may mean something real a conplo of year
hence. Half tho preseut expenditure is
mere extravagance that can bo dispensed
with when the people decido to crush the
spirit of Tammanv Hall in Washington as
they scotched it in New York.
Ihe News says: "President Harrison's
proposals for the redaction of the surplus
can be only palliativo measures." It warns
English authors and publishers not to ex-
fett too much from tL copyright agitation,
t regards the referenco to the fisheries as
the most satisfying part of tho message.
The Telegraph is doubtful whether any
important practical result can How from the
Pan-American project, and considers that
it -will be interesting towatch tho reception
of the edncational proposal.
The Chronicle says: "The extradition
proposal shows a courteons recognition of
an honorable international obligation
-"which should be reciprocated here. The
proposal touching surplus is timid and
tame."
SURRENDERING DEPOSITS.
National Ranks flatten to Comply with Sec
retary YVIndom's llr-urt.
Washington, Dec. 3. Secretary Windorn
to-day received letters from three national
bank depositories in respose to his notice of
the withdrawal of 10 per cent, of their de
posits Jan. 15. One of tho banks surren
dered the entira amonnton deposit, SolO.OOO,
and offered to sell tho C00,0(X of four-percent,
bonds held by the United .States
Treasurer as security therefor to the gov
ernment at $1.27. This is a Postou bank and
is of the class known as "surplus.' or "in
active aero an ; bauks." Another one of the
bitters whs irorn an "active bank," and
odered the department &"',onj four-percent.
at ?1.27. This represents the entire
amount of the withdrawal from thU bank
under tlte plan adopted towards
active account" banks, meaning banks
with which the department has
dealing in tho transaction of cur-
rent business. Both offers wero ac
cepted and are included in to-day's pur
chase of bonds. Tho third bank heard
from is an "inactive account" bank. It
expressed its purpose of waiving the 10 per
cent, privilege in the matter of with
drawals, and Its intention to sell to the
government its security bonds, aggregat
ing SllU.OtX). at the prevailing rate. It is
said at the Treasnry Department that the
prompt and nnexpectea action of these
banks in selling their bonds is probably
due to the fact that there will be reduc
tion of 1 per cent, in the premium paid on
four per cents, after the 1st of January,
when the next quarterly interest falls due.
The bond oilers accepted to-day were:

TWO CAUCUSES.
Futile Attempt of House Democrats to Ap- '
point a Steering Committee.
Washington, Dec. 3. The Democratic
Representatives held a caucus to-night, in
pursuance of the. order made at the ad
journment of the caucus yesterday. There
was a food attendance, more than one hun
dred members being present. Upon motion
of Mr. Springer of Illinois, Mr. Hohnan of
Indiana was elected chairman of the cau
cus, to enccevd the late Kepresentative Cox
of New York, Mr. Carlisle having declined
the post. Following a time-honored cus
tom, the Republican majority had signiiied
their willingness to allow tho Democratic
minorty to retain one of their party in the
employ of tho Door-keeper, andiho
caucus to-night selected Isaac Hill,
now an assistant eergeant-at-arms
as the employe who should be so retained,
and made it his duty to preserve tho secrecy
of the caucus. Messrs. Wilson, of West
Virginia and Blancbard of Louisiana wero
re-elected secretaries of the caucus.
When these preliminaries had been dis
posed of Representative Oates of Alabama
offered a resolution providing fur the ap
pointment of a committee of fifteen mem
bers, with ex-Speaker Carlisle as chairman,
to undertake the care of the political in
terests of the minority, or to discharge the
duties of what is commonly known as a
'steering committee."
Opposition immediately developed. Rep
resentative Blount of Georgia stronuly ob
jected to the delegation of individual
powers and rights to any committee, and
found a number of other reasons why tho
resolution should not be adopted. Mr.
lreckinridt:e of Arkansas was also opposed
to tho resolution, andj moved that it bo
laid on the table.
Mr. Breckinridge of Kentucky suggested
the appointment of a committee ot three
members, with powers corresponding to
thooof an executive committee,from whoso
decision an oppeal might' be taken to the
committee of uftten. which, in turn, might
call the raueus together.
Mr. Crane of l exas moved, as a further
Mib-titute, the appointment of a committee
f live member to keep the Democratic
Representatives advised of the movements
and plans of their opponents, and to call
the caucus together when necessary.
Finally all of the motions were laid aside
for the present, and the caucus adjourned.
Republican Senatorial Caucus.
Washington, Dec. 3. At a meeting of
the Republican senatorial canens. this aft
ernoon, the reorganization of committees
was the only matter under discussion.
After an interchange of opinion it was de
cided to continue the canens committee of
last session, including Senators Flatt,
Quay, Allison, Evarts and Manderson. The
committee has been given charge of the
subject of a general reorganization of the
committees. There are several on the
present list of select committees that will
probably be dropped, and one or two of tlte
standing committees, the reasons for their
being called into existence having passed
away. Among the probable new commit
tees will bo one on immigration and natur
alization and one on the world's fair of
lbfJ2. as provided for in Senator Aldrichs
resolution on the subject, introduced in
the Senate yesterday, to which will be re
ferred all matters pertaining thereto." Noth
ing was said about electing new officers.
S ERG E ANT-AT-A RSI S HOLMES.
Ills Duties and Responsibilities A ropular
House Official.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
Washington, Dec. 3. Major Holmes, of
Iowa, the new Sergeant-at-arms of the
House, was at the Capitol this afternoon,
getting himself in readiness to assume the
duties of his official position. He stated to
your correspondent that he would not take
hold of his office for two or three days, or
nntil he selected his assistants, and the
books of the present Sergeant-at-arms wero
arranged so as to turn over the official ac
counts of the offioe. The Sergeant-at-nrrs
handles between a million and a half and
two million dollars a year, and, in fact,
operates a private banking institution for
tho 330 members. The employes are paid
by the Sergeant-at-arms, and it is quite a
responsible and busy positition, requir
ing the assistance of soveral clerks.
The Sergeant-at-arms has soveral deputies
and appoints the capital police force. He
is required to give a bond of about 35,000.
Major Holmes is very popular in Washing
ton, where he made many friends during
his services as a member of the House. His
selection by the caucus without a canvass
has proved to be highly satisfactory to
those who brought it about. Tho oldest
members say they cannot recall that a man
was ever before made Sergeant-at-anns
without seeking the position.
SENATE AND HOUSE.
The- President's Message Read Before Roth
Bodies, After Which They Adjourn.
Washington, Dec. 3. Immediately after
the reading of yesterday's journal a mes
sage from the House was preseuted by its
clerk, Mr. McPherson, announcing the or
ganization of that body. Then Mr. Ed
munds, on the part of the joint committee
to wait on the President, reported that it
had performed that duty and had been in
formed by the President that be wonld
communicate with the two houses by a
message in writing immediately. Ames
sage from the President was announced at
12:0$'. The message was received and tho
Secretary of the Senate, Mr. McCook,
proceeded to read it. The reading of the
message was concluded at half-Dastl, hav
ing occupied about an honr and twenty
tivo minutes. On motion of Mr. Sherman,
it was laid on the table, and ordered print
ed, and then the Senate, at 1:30, adjourned
until to-morrow.
Immediately after the reading of the
House journal, the committee appointed to
wait upon the President, and inform him
that the House was organized and ready to
proceed to business, appeared in the main
aisle, and, through its chairman, Mr. Mc
Kinley, informed the House that
it Lad performed its duty, and
that the President would com
municate with the House in writing
forthwith. Mr. Prnden, one of the Presi
dent's secretaries, then delivered the ms
sago, which was immediately read by tho
Clerk. The reading consumed nearly two
hours. The message was ordered printed
and referred to the committee of the whole.
Under authority given by the last sundry
civil appropriation bill, the Speaker ap-
Eointed Messrs. Rayne. Hitt, Carter, Cul
erson (Texas) and Cummin gs as a com
mittee on the centennial celebration. The
House then, at 2:15, adjourned until Thurs
day. .

Government Lands in New States.
Washington, Dec. 3. Assistant Attorney-general
Shields, of the Interior Do-
.partment, has given tho Secretary of the
Interior an opinion as to the effect of tho
seventeenth section of the act admitting
the new States, which refers to the act of
1SU (the original pre-emption net), and re
peals the same as to new States, lie holds
that, taking the whole section together, tho
intent was not to repeal the pre-emption
laws, but to make a grant of lands in lieu
of the eighth section or the act of 1U, gen
erally known as the internal improvement
grant, ami to repeal that section as to tho
new fetates; that the act of le4l was carried
into the Revised Statutes, and repeated in
l!sT5; that if Congress had intended to re
peal the pre-emption laws, it could have
done so by repealing the sections of the
Revised statutes appertaining theieto, or
by apt words so declaring, and not by a
repeal of the old act of 141; and that the
pre-emption laws so contained in the Re
vised Statutes, except as to the internal
improvement grants, are still in force in
the new.

BUSINESS E31BARRASSMENTS.
New Derelopments in the Case of Lewis S.
Cox & Co., of Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, Dec. 3. There were no
important developments to-day in the sur
prising failure of Lewis S. Cox cfc Co.,
beyond the action of the sheriff of Mont
gomery county in levying upon tho resi
dence and other personal property of Mr.
Cox, at Ogontz, under execution on the
8185,000 judgment note of George Victor,
trustee for the creditors! Mr. William M.
Siugerlv, whose only interest in the busi
ness was that of a large creditor, and who
was not embraced in tho list for whose
benefit judgment was entered yesterday,
went into court to-day and secured a stay
restraining the sale of the goods in the
store at No. 1220 Chestnut street, which
were attached under a writ issued against
Lewis S. Cox and Lewis S. Cox & Co. No
assignment wa.s recorded to-day. Mr. Sing
erly in his affidavit for the injunction de
clars that Cox's debt to him exceeds all his
Cox's other debts combined.
Other Failures.
Chattanooga, Tenn., Dec. 3. The Cen
tral Elevator Company, of this city, T. A.
Cheek, president, has assigned. Their
schedule shows $160,298 as liabilities and
about an equal amount as assets. The
failure is the largest that has ever occurred
here, and was precipitated by the de
preciation of grain in their elevator. It is
reported to-night that the warehouse re
ceipts are duplicated in several instances,
and there is some excitement in conse
quence. Leadville, Col., Dec. 3. The Assasize
Mining Company, represented, principally
by Eastern capitalists, made an assignment
last night to Charles Hill, giving that gen
tleman power of attorney to sell and dis
pose of their property and settle all debts.
The liabilities are placed at 8114.000; assets,
$joo,000. Tho assignment has caused great
consternation here. !

HORRIBLE RESULT OP A SPREE.
An Old Woman Found Dead in Her Room with
Her Pace Half Eaten by Rats.
Denver, Col., Dec. 8. A horrible dis
covery was made here late to-night which
may yet prove to bo a tragedy. About a
year and a half ago a Mrs. Ritchio, an old
gray-haired woman about sixty years of
age, came here from Cheyenne, W3'. T ac
companied by a young man of twenty-five,
whom she represented as her son, and
a deaf and dumb daughter, about fifteen.
They lived in various parts of the city, un
til about two months ago, when they en
gaged apartments at 1521 Stout street, where
they lived a very retired life. Three weeks
ago, tho mother- and son went on a pro
tracted debauch. Tho old lady had not
Seen seen for several days, and
the landlord, becoming alarmed, broke
open tho door of her room to-night, and
was horrified to lind the woman dead, lying
upon the floor by the side of her bed. with
her face almost entirely devoured by rats.
The body was taken to the coroner's. The
son was fonnd in an adjoining room,
in a beastly state of intoxication,
and wan taken to the station-home, whero
he now lies unable to speak or give any ac
eonnt of himself. The dead woman had on
deposit at the FiTst National Bank $'!0,000.
The family went to Cheyenne from Texas,
and while living in Wyoming, a son was
mysteriously murdered. It is said that
the deaf and dumb daughter knows who
committed tho crime, but refuses to di
vulge the secret, and no arrests have ever
been made.

Newark, N. J., Dee. 3.-Thieves smashed

some jewelry at the time are believed to bo
accomplices of the scoundrels.

BURIAL OF THE VICTIMS.
Three Funerals at MinneapoUs Yesterday
Relief Fund Giwimj Coroner's Inquest.
Minneapolis, Dec. 8. Three funeral
were held to-day qver all that was mortal
of three of the victims of Saturday night's
disaster at the Tribune building. Milton
Pickett, of the Pioneer Press, was buried
at Lakewood, his pall-bearers being col
leagues on that paper, and the services
being in charge of Rev. H. M. Simmons, of
the First Unitarian Church, and President
Northrup, of the ; State University.
Floral tributes were furnished by the
newspaper men ' of the two cities.
Funeral services over the remains of Prof.
Kdward Olsen were held at the home of his
brother this afternoon. Among the mourn
ers were a number of the students from the
South Dakota University, of which de
ceased had been president. One of the
dead printers, Robert McCutcbeon, was
buried from Warner's undertaking estab
lishment, the interment being in the Typo
graphical Union lot at Lakewood. Ihe
hody of K. J. Jenkinson, the father of the
Tribune chanel, was taken to Sioux
City by relatives this morning. The other
three bodies will be buried to-morrow.
Owing to the dangerous condition of .
the ruins, no attempt was made to-day to
get at the presses and to search for other
bodies further than to see that the presses
seem not wholly destroyed. Measures for
the relief of the bereaved families aro
rapidly going forward, and enough has al
ready been subscribed to relieve their im
mediate necessities, and it is hoped much j
more will be etcured. The Times fund
this afternoon passed $1,000, and is going j
up rapidly. The Chamber of Commerce
has raised over one thousand dollars for
the family of operator Igoe, having known
him as manager of their telegraph oflice. '
The coroners inquest still continues, the
testimony being more of the same as here
tofore given. The builder of the structure
says that when he was building it wooden
stairs were ordered put in, instead of iron,
on account of a difference in expense of
about 5,000. Building Inspector Hazen had
never considered the building a safe one,
and said three months ago that a committee
called on him to complain, because they
feared the building might fall down at any
time without any warning. He considered
it an unsafe building and very inadequately
provided with lire-escapes.
Nothing is more dehnitely known as to
the possible victims in the ruins. That
several more bodies are still to betaken
out. is iirmly believed by a srreat many peo
ple, while many others are hoping that the
full extent of the calamity, as to loss of
life, has been learned.

o bad with eczema that he lost all of his hair.
His scalp was covered with eruptions, which the
doctors said was scall-head, and that his hair
would never grow again. Despairing ot a cure

Kemedies, and I am hapny to say, with the most
