Democratic Messenger.
LITTLETON DMtyiS. EDITOR 4 PUBLISHER
Snow Hilt, Md., Dec. 9th , 1882.
The President’s Message.
The message of President Ar
thur, sent to Congress on Monday,
is not Tory long, nor is it very
short. It covers a variety of top
ics, and seems to indicate upon the
whole that the President under
stands from the late election, that
the wisest thing he can do is to
talk reform. It has a queer sound
tehear Chester A. Arthur con
demning assessments for political
purposes,and yet, his message dues
this as far as it decently can, con
sidering the President’s own past
record. He also does another queer
thing in his message, considering
his record "" sptrHs politician
while Collector of New York,
which is to declare himself in fa
vor of civil service reform. The
President thinks there should be a
revision of the present tariff sys
tem, —not too much revision—not
enough to do away with protecting
the interests of certain favored
classes. He recommends the aboli
tion ot internal revenues save the
tax upon tobacco iu various forms,
and upon fermented and spiritu
ous liquors. He mentions the em
barrassment of the national treas
ury from a large surplus ot assets,
and the lack of means of freeing
the treasury of this embarrass
ment. He does not directly men
tion, however, that the 47th Con
gress did its level best to take all
this embarrassment off the hands
of the secretary of the treasury, by
votiog the surplus io sums ot hun
dreds of millions of dollars to pay
every manner of trumped-up pen
sion claim and to sustain almost
every other measure that came be
fore that body asking for money.
The message will be found in full on
the first page of this paper.
Questions to Come Before Con
gross.
The tariff question is undoubt
edly to be a prominent one before
the present and the next Congress.
A tariff commission was appoint
ed last spring, which has still beeu
junketing over the country, pro
bably doiog very little aside from
bolding receptions, and eating
eumptuous dinners. Whatever the
report of this commission may be,
the question will undoubtedly be
• prominent one before Congress.
Public opinion will demand a re
vision of the preseut schedule,and
just now, Congress dare not fly
into the face ot public opinion.
Internal revenue reduction is
another mutter that will come up
for attention. The report ot com.
missioner Raurn recommends a re
daction nmounting to some sixty
or seventy millions of dollars.
Civil service reform will also
be talked about, but civil service
reform is as yet a very ticklish
question.
The United States Navy will
again be tha favonts joke of the
eeaaion.
River and harbor appropriatieo
bills will not be popular e'.oug
Congressmen.
“ More pensions." will also show
its head. But even the Republican
members will probably be chary as to
how they vote more pensions.
Amono the lumbermen there is
an old saying that a man who can
ateal a log out of the baik and
leave the owner standing on the
bark, without knowledge ot bis
loss, has a sure prospect of being
able to make bis own way in this
world. Some of the Western
ranchmen seem, however, to hare
improved even upoo this peeuliar
method of making one** way iu
this world. They have stolen an
entire county nod put a post and
wire fence around it before the
government officials suspected
whgt was going oq. The uiodiu
operand! was to have the eutiieb
made by cowboys who turned the
said entries over to their employer.*
immediately afterward. Tim dm
covery ot the frauds was made by
bona-fide settlers who were driven
off the land by the rascally ranch
men. The government is engaged
t present in determining what it
going to do about, it.

THE SUN.
MEW YORK. HR.
More people bora read Taa Sea during
the y-ar just now passing than ever Datora
lioca it wm 6nt printed No other Dew*,
paper published on th<s aide of the earth baa
been bought and read in an/ /ear b/ ao
man/ men and women.
We are credibly informed that people bu/,
read, and like Taa Sea for the following
reasons, among others ;
Because its news columns present in at*
tractive form and with lbs greatest possible
accuracy whatever has interest for human
kind. The events, the deeds and misdeeds,
the wisdom, the philosophy, the notable let*
1 y, the solid sense, the improving aoaseoeo—
a)i tLe aews ol the busiest world at prassot
revolviog io spare.
Because people bave learned that io it’a
remarks concerning persons and affairs Ten
Sett makes a practice of telling them tbs ex
act truth to the bast ol its ability three hun
dred sod sisty-five days in the year, befora
election ms well as after, about the wbalas as
well as shout the small fish' in the faoa of
dissent as plaiulv and fearlessly as whan
supported by general approval. Taa Sea
has absolutely no purposes So serve, save tbs
information of its readers and tbs further
ance of the common good.
Because it is ever) body's newspaper. No
man is so bumble that tbs Bun is iodiffeiant
to bis welfare aod to bis rights No man is
so rich that it can allow injustice to be doae
him. No man, no association of men, is
powerful enough to be exempt front tbs
strict application of iu principles of right
and wroug.
because in politics it has fought for a do
tn years, without intermission and some
times almost alone amoug newspapers, the
tight that I’M resulted ia tbs recent over
whelming popular verdict against Roheeon
ism aud lor bo lest government. Nu matter
wh-t party is io power, the Sun stands and
will continue to stand like a rock tor the in
terests of the people against the ambition of
bosses, the encroachments ot monopolists,
aod the dishonest schemes of public rub
bers
All ibis is whutare told almost d-rly by
our friends. One man holds that The Sun
is the best religious newspaper ever publish
ed, because iu Christianity is undiluted with
can. Another bolds that it is the best Re
publican newspaper (rioted, because it baa
already whipped hatful the rascals out of
that party, and is proceeding against the
other half with nndimiuisbed vigor. A third
trlieves it to be the beet magazine of general
literature in existence, because its readers
m iss aoibitig worthy of uolice that is cur
rent in the world ot thought. So every Iriend
of The Suu discovers one of tU many sides
that appeals with particular force to bis in
dividual liking.
It ou alretdy know The Sun, yon will
observe that iu IBd3 it is a little be ter than
ever before. It you do not already know
The Suu, you will flud it to be a mirror of
all human activity, a storehouse of the
choicest products of common sens* aud itu*
iginalion, * m mislay tor the cause if hon
est government, aseotiuel for genuine Jeffer
s< nian Democracy, a scourge for wtekedaces
ol etery species, an uncommonly good
luveitmeut lor the cjmiug year.
