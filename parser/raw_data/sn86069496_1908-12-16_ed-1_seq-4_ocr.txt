FOR CIRCUIT JUDGE
We are authorized to announce tha t
N H W Aaron of Casey county is a
candidate for Circuit Judge in this the
J 29th Judicial district subject to the
action of the Republican party
I
+ The deficit in the National
Treasurery under Republican
rule seems to 3 be lightly consider
t ed by Republican publications
yet under Mr Cleveland these
s me journals were howling
y every day and drawing the dark
est pictures The way out of
the trouble hasalready been an
nounced issue bonds It is now
contemplated to place another
large bond issue to tide over the
trouble and yetwe are told that
the future is brightning that
safe and sound gQvernment man
agement is in forcesMany of
the people believe the statement
but many are apprehensive and
believe that amore economical
poll y shouldcircumscribe the
governments course Already
I
the present administration has
placed many millions of dollars
in bonds and now it is to be re
peated High living in Wash
ington extravagance rampant
and the government plunging
v into debt do not forebode good
r nor indicate permanent pros j
> perity With no wars without
and no feuds within with the
productive powers of our coun
try increased and the markets
4
of the world open for our surplus
such a degree of extremity can
i not be justified and such a course
can not be endorsed for in the
end it must all come from the
people through taxes The
f peo
pIe of this section and this State
would not even agree to bond the
country or the State for the pur
1
r > pose of securing badly needed
1
improvements and yet many of
them are endorsing National in
r debtedness for maintaining in
J
s increasing National extravagance

direct to the people Up to date
nothing has been done by the
National Government to improve
the public highways This
1the I
would be of far greater worth to
the country to inland commerce
II
to the entire people than any I
other improvement on the long
list of needs and desires To
bond the country for this pur
pose ought to meet the approval
of all the people it would be
ford
a few big developments where
but few comparatively enjoy the
C
benefits is npt evenhanded jus
tice not fair to the people and
ought to be condemned
The crime committed last
week in the neighborhood of
Russell Springs elsewhere given
1
in this issue isone that shocks
and horrifies every individual
who hears of it In the cata
logue of crime in the depth of
human depravity it marks the
extreme limits of beastly lust
and destruction No country
has ever had a more horrid mur
der and nodemon has ever ex
ecuted a more hellish crime A
sweet little girl not quite eleven
years of age innocent and pure
as a new born flower happy and
joyful nearing her mothers side
after a day in school almost at
the door step of her home seized
by a brute in human form car
ried to the woods outraged and
then murdered to hide the crime
No punishment is adequate to
compensate no court of justice
too speedy to inflict it A prec
ious life in its budhood blotted
out in the most barbarous man I
ner at an unexpected hour with
in the shadow of a school days
twylight almost within the grasp
of her parents That human
vengence should be arroused to
the highest tention could not be
otherwise that mercy should be
shown to the murderer could not
bs imagined and justice speedy
and sure must be handed out
Appauling and shocking as the
crime is as just deserving of
death as the slayer is and as cer
tam as the people are that they I
I
have the guilty party in the
clutches of the law so sure ought
they to be willing to let the law
apply the punishment No rash
act should be committed for
there is no avenue of escape for
the guilty party when convinc
ing evidence of guilt confronts
a jury Without such evidence
guilt can not be established in or
outside of court and no people
would be y true to good judgment
Vise of action or justified pun1
ish suspicion The motto
rshould enforces
the law speedily
