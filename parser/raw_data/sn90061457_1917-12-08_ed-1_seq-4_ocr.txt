TUT TRIUMPH OP OF.HMA.V
INTIlUilli:
In the pint two weeks we lme licon
treated a real display of German
Intrigue' over Russia -In fact that In
trlguo has dealt a death blow to the
Kre.it Russian nation and now It Is
but a chaos of dismembered
treed, ruees and nationalities drifting
no one Known whither.
These races nnd creeds have set up
lie and various governments. Tho
Cossacks and Ukr.inlnns and the Fin
nls have set up governments of their
own and Slberin l on the same road
and the bolshevlkl government con
trols Petiogrud and Moscow and Po
land Lithuania and the Baltic pro
Mines are under Herman control, und
the 10 Mcms now no posslbllltj that
these Hcattered and dismembered unite
can ever be again assembled which
brings tho unpalatable admission that
German diplomacy and Intrigue have
scored u great triumph and It did
so from tho fact that It understood
tlie Russian psychology much better
linn have Its enemies, liven so wise
and trained a statesman as Ellhu
Ilnol came uvvav from Petrograd with
what Is now proved to be an entirely
mistaken conception of conditions,
and the le-iysurlng messages brought
bv himself nnd members of his mission
were misleading sud harmful.
Hut Instead of this being the end
of Herman Intrigue In Russia, It Is
onl the real beginning, for the
bolshevlkl government u.s its willing
and convenient cut's-pay It will now
hull Itself ngalii"t (leriuani's remain

Into other countries. The plan is
frankly disclosed by the lolshevki
niouthpleie, which declares thut If tl'e
governments of other countiies tvtll

ri e against them. Just as they did in
It i-sla, and force presumably, the
sime kind of "peace" with Germany
ttiat disgraced and ruined Rus.sU Is
uiklng now. If this could bv any
i '-nihility be accomplished the victory

If iv Missouri high school boy hid

debating society he would havo been
Jeered from the rostrum- think of
Trotzky, one of the present foremost
Russians, making such use of his
brain!
In the very first place every propo
sition he offers Is radically wrong, and
untenable. How could American cap

for her enormous capital" when under
nn extreme under Trotzky's extreme
socialist government all capital would
be abolished? and with Trotzky and
his associates already having about
abolished nil capital In Russia or else
have forced It Into hiding?
And how could the United States as
a "capitalist" country anxious to de
velop a great European market be
anxious for the exhaustion of all Eur
ope, for where could profits come
from If nil of Russin's wealth was dis
sipated and destroved?
The resumption of unrestricted sub
marine warfare was the culminating
wrong thut drove us Into war and the
decision did not "rest with Wall street"
for It rested with all of the Ameri
can people, all of whom hid been in
jured and outraged by the announce
ment that rightfulness was to be em-
ploved to drive our commerce from
the seas.
And It Is equally true that American
"capitalistic Interests" could not af

Of course Teddy had to break Into
print again as he Is always doing with
his spot-light loving propensities and
here Is what he says In the Metropoli
tan Magazine for the current month:
"We have started to train several
hundred thousand of Infantry. But
we have actually trained only one
division, some 20,000 men. They Hre
the only Infantry who are at present
rairiv ready to be pitted against our
foes."
The United States, In little more
than six months, has collected a fight
ing force of more than two million
men. Of these some 370,000 are In
the regular army, and have had the
benefit of the thorough training that
goes with that branch of the service.
There is a national guard army of
470,000 that has been mustered int.)
the federal sep'lre, and a national
army of over Cdl 000, and both of
them have been undergoing extensive
and thorough training for ncprly
three months.. . The latest dispatches

Fair and rational criticism that Is
meant to be helpful and constructive.
Is nt all times Justifiable. But such
criticism as Col. Roosevelt pour3 out
In one continuous stream, belittling
our army and military preparations
and seeking to dilute the people's faith
in their government, all of It prompted
by personal pique and resentment nnd
by partisan bias, ," nothing less than
reprehensible.
That Col. Roosevelt's heart Is In the
war no sane man questions. Why,
then, cannot he postpone his quarrel
with Woodrow Wilson, and his vendet
ta with the democratic party, for a
more propitious occasion? When the
house Is on fire Is not the time to
continue a family quarrel.
