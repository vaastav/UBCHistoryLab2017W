More Trouble Over Mexico.
Several times during the last few months It
has been asserted the administration at Wash
ington Is deliberately suppressing Important
facts in connection with the situation in Mexico.
These charges have been circumstantially made
by responsible persons, and the only official at
tention paid to them was through a recent out
burst from Private Secretary Tumulty, who flew
Ic defend Carranza from accusations brought
against him from sources certainly entitled to a
hearing. More serious charges are now being
made, so far as suppression of tbe true condi
tions in Mexico la involved.
A newspaper correspondent, who represents
two of the really conservative great papers t
the country, the Chicago Tribune and the New
York Son, gets word home to his papers that it
Is almost impossible to send out tbe truth from
Mexico. This is because of strict censorship on
the cable at Vera Crux and other points, and be
cause the only way to get mail out of the City of
Mexico is to send it unsealed in the United States
pouch, which goes direct to Washington, there
to be censored. Such charges as these, defi
nitely made by responsible persons, support the
allegation that "watchful waiting" bas not been
altogether without Its other side. That, while
our government may not have "buttedMn." an
the president puts it, on Mexican affairs, it has
exerted some influence, and still is, in behalf ot
Carranza.
At any rate, so long as the United States la
at peace with the de facto government of Mexico,
why should communications between the citizens
of tbe two countries by subjected to censorship?
What is there to conceal from the people?
Peace on the Peace Ship.
"Many men of many minds" runs the old
nursery ditty to the end that "many men do dis
agree." And this is receiving, a beautiful Illus
tration Just now in the experlence'reported from
Mr. Ford's peace ship. Each of the delegates
aboard ship is bent on a great humanitarian
mission, and Is thoroughly commit teed to the
ideals of "peace on earth and good will toward
men." Unfortunately, each individual also has
his own view as to how this desirable end la to
be attained, and neither feels called upon to en
tirely submerge his individuality for the purpose
of bringing about unanimity.. As a result, the
Ford party is breaking up into groups, and when
the shores of warring Europe are reached, tbe
rulers of the nations will be perhaps confused by
the multiplicity of plans suggested for "getting
the boys out of the trenches by Christmas." One
can almost imagine the chancelleries of Europe
suggesting to Mr. Ford and his associates that
they reach some agreement between themselves
before they undertake to adjust the muddled af
fairs of a perverse world.
The Irish Saved the Day.
For the first time since the war began British
military authorities. .make adequate acknowl
edgment of the deathless valor qf the Irish reg
iment onthe far-flung battlefront.. Whatever
foundation exlated for complaints on this score
are disposed of by the details of the heroic
battle to the death of the Royal Innlskllllnera
against tbe Bulgars on the ridge of Kevls Crest.
Rear guard actions usually are fierce, deadly
combats, especially for the defenders of tbe, re
treating army. The Innlskllllns breasted the
oncoming . victorious foe, overmatched, ten to
one, and held tbe Bulgars at bay for hours and
until the retreating army reached the appointed
line of defense. Almost to a man they paid the
price with their lives, but they "saved the day,"
Tbe action and the aacriflce is character
iatically Irish. It la the same spirit of valor and
sacrifice exhibited at Yellow Ford 600 years ago,
at Clontarf and Limerick, in the Peninsula
campaign under Wellington, at Cremona and
Fontenoy. Every war for liberty, every attack on
tyranny, at home and abroad, is marked with
the fighting Irish spirit shown in the Balkans.
It runs through the history ot the revolution and
the civil war, and reached the maximum of
slaughter In the fruitless successive charges of
Meagher's Irish brigade on Marye'a Heights.
"Cursed be the laws which deprived me of
such soldiers," exclaimed the second George of
England when the Irish brigade at' Fontenoy
turned the tide of victory to France. It- has
taken England two and a half centuries to learn
the lesson and make partial amends to Ireland
and her sons.
Great Britain's latest Move.
John Bull haa always been known for thrift
and Is now beginning to exhibit' prudence and
foresight, as well. In witness of this we present
the fact that Reginald McKenna ia now busily
engaged in exchanging British war tasues tor
American stocks and bands at the markrprteV.
As was pointed out by The Bee some time ago
tbe British holdera of American securities were,
making a very handsome profit by this exchange,
although the total amount had not reached a
very high figure. lie tendency of the private
owner ot American securities to bane onto them
lb natural, and that It should be shared in by
tbe British government is not at all astonishing.
Mr. McKenna's assurance that he has BO inten
tion of flooding tbe American market by throw
ing on it a large volume of securities to realise
cash was unnecessary. Ths stable character ol
American atocka and bonds is such as to make
them the most desirable investment known to
the world today, and the British government la
merely showing good sense In exchanging its
own for the Yankee securities.

A Modern Macbeth
James Walter anUtk la Bee ton Traaaerip
HAD been reading a book called "A Royal Tra-
I &)." and had Just turned a page. Then I atopred
to think. . The passage I had teen reading ran as
follows:
"The door opened slowly.' There stood King Alex
ander and Queen Draga, both of them hastily and In
sufficiently dressed, aa they had sprung from their
bed. They found themselvea facing a dense group of
officers. It waa a historic but terrible tableau! Klnrf
Alexander stepped forward In front of the queen, aa
if to shelter her. looked straight at the tratlors and
aald: 'What la It you want? and what of your oath
of fidelity to me?' There waa a aeoond or two of
deadly silence. They looked at each other aa if
mesmerized. Then lieutenant , who before en
tering the army waa a teacher In a village school,
cried out: 'What arc yoti standing gating at? Hero
la our oath ef fidelity to him!' Paying thia bo
fired on the king, who aank Into the arms of Draga
In a moment aeveral revolVere were fired on the fall
ing king and on the queen. They both then dropped
on the floor. The enraged conapiratore continued for
a few seconds firing their revolvers at the royal cou
ple, bleeding and groaning on the floor. Then then
drew their swords, and began to dash them In all i
direction. The poor woman. Queen Draga. wn
especially the object of their revolting cruelty, t
Fortunately the poor woman waa killed Instantly by
the first volley aimed at her. King Alexander, al
though pierced by aeveral bulleta. waa not dead. He
groaned In agony. In a pool of blood. It la not certain
that he waa conscious. Lieutenant Colonel Mlshlch
suggested that the bodies of the king and queen
ahould be thrown out of the window. Into the Tower
garden, that the-eoldler surrounding the palace
ahould see that thy were dead. He opened the win
dow. Bending over It he ahouted: 'Long live King
Peter Karageorgevitch, king of Perrla!' The officer
In front of their eoldlera echoed his cry by shouting:
Long live King Peter!' ('Zlveo KralJ Peter!')"
When the newa of the Belgrade murders flashed
acrosa the world. King Peter waa living the plain and
peaceful life of a pretender on the bank of LaX
Geneva. The romance of youth had departed from
him, for he waa 63. and there waa nothing unlesa ie
himself knew of It that threatened to disturb the
even current of his existence. He waa known to
everybody In Geneva a plain Prince Peter Kara
georgevitch. His trim, alender, medlum-etsed figure,
and Ma fierce military muatachee and fiery eyea, wero
aa familiar to the children in the streets as they wer
to the frequenters of the moat exclusive . Genevan
clubs and salona. Although his house In the Rue
Ballot was elegantly furnished, the prince lived In sim
ple style. He waa not a rich man. and malntalnel
no entourage, more, probably, because he could not
afford it than because of ausplcloua which the exig
ence of a prlttcely retinue might arouse. A woman
servant named Mathilda and a valet named Albert
attended to his dally wanta, and a governeas, on
Mile, I-agler", Used frequently to coma In, either to
answer the old man'a letters or to give Instruction to
the children when they were In Geneva. He was a
skillful chess player, and when the children were
home he used to play with them every evening. Fo
Serbians paaalng through Geneva he Vept an open
house, and though ordinarily a silent man, he coulj
always be roused to tell stories of his military ex
ploits. He waa a great lover of black coffee, and
smoked bushels ef cigarettes. He waa fond of shoot
ing, for he had taken prises at the target and had
been a member of the awagger shooting club In Paris.
II was also fond of riding, but even at that time hi
rheumatism waa troubling him, and he could not lido
with hi old-time enjoyment. So far aa hla mental
attainments were concerned, he had nothing out ot
the common beyond a fine knowledge ot languages
and history. Hla favorite authors were Michele:,
Thiers and Henri Martin. He had made special atudlea
of the Uvea of Catherine the Great and Bismarck, and
knew considerable about the Napoleonic period. Ha
had translater Into Herbian John Stuart Mill's essay
"On Liberty," and for hi aervloe In Introducing' the
great English economist work the prince had en
Joyed a generoug meed of praise from hla-countrymen.
It hum never been proved that Prince Peter was
directly connected with the murder of Alexander ani
Draga. - The world auspected It. however, and half
the world Still remalna convinced of his guilt. It waa
algntflcant that the day on which the murder took,
place June 11, IWS waa the. thirty-fifth anniversary
of the aaaaaslnatlun of King Alexander's grand-uncla,
Michael, by Alexander Karajreorgevltch, and doubly
Significant that Prince Peter. seemed ready for iiq
Immediate departure from Geneva on the day after
the murder, or aa aoon as new arrived that tne
regicides were willing to make him king. Prince
Peter, knowing that theae suspicions of his connection
with the conspiracy were widespread, took Immediate
occasion to deny hla reaponalbllity.
Whosover the guilt, the prince ' waa formally
chosen king on June It, and on the S2d ha took ths
train for Belgrade. It had been remarked for montli
in Geneva that he had looked careworn, and hla ap
pearance at th station oa the day of hla departure,
surrounded by a crowd In which the faces ef soma Im
portant officials were absent, did not strengthen the
general feeling that th Journey waa being made with,
out misgivings.' He should have been happy, for lie
waa returning to hla beloved 8erbla, after an exile of
forty-five years, but he waa oppressed by the knowl
edge, not only that ha Was under a cloud of suspicion,
but that he waa going horn to a country In tha
depths -of distress, rent by political strife and hate.
Hi own life, he knew, waa not too aafe, and he
probably remembered that, of all the klnga whoii
Serbia had had. one only had been permitted to die
peacefully in bad. If there waa any comfort at all in
hla thought, it mutt have eome to him from the fact
that af (alra at Belgrade could not be worse than th y
were and he had aa opportunity, so long aa he re
mained a atrlctly constitutional monarch, that ha
might bring back to hla kingdom peace and prosperity
and a better place In the world'a regard.
. Belgrade gave Peter a splendid welcome, but the
people were a llltl , disappointed In hla peiaonal ap.
pearance. He did not look like a king, for he n
amall and thin, and even his fierce mustaches did not
aave him from a certain amount of contempt. He
waa gray and wore piincenea and he bore his fifty
seven years rather heavily. The coronation waa a
brilliant function, but there were few dtplomatlat
present, and tha new king knew all too quickly that
the official world and the outaide nationa, with one or
two exceptions, had given him the boycott. It waa a
long time before ha could be brought to repudiate the
regicides who had called him to the throne, and even
then the repudiation waa only a half-hearted one,
forced upon him by the abaolute determination of one
ef the great powers not te recognise his kingship until
the repudiation-had been made.
That was twelve yeara ago. Pefore he left Geneva
the prince gave to tha Serbian people the assurance
that he would faithfully support aay constltuliu't
which the Serbian gave themselves. Since that as
surance was given he haa conducted himself aa a
strirtly constitutional monarch, and. although he ha
naturally been under tha domination of the mtlltaiy
party, and has bom himself with credit during th.;
wars In which his country haa been engaged, he has
been little more than a figure-head. Several timea
tha last In May, 1913 his abdication haa been reported,
and In June of laat year the crown prince waa ap.
panted regent. It waa believed at the time that th
king's difficulties with the army had worn him out,
although In the royal proclamation Illness and inabil
Ity to perform his duUea were given aa th reasons for
confiding the government to his hair.

CREIGHTON, Neb., Dec. 14,-To the
Editor of The Bee: The season is at
hand when tha congress of the United
Statea la again in ae salon. For more than
a century that body haa created lawa
that have governed one of the thus far,
most peaceful and enlightened nationa
cf the earth. Figuratively speaking the
cyea of the world are turned thla way
because their action wllL shape the future
destiny of men and nyaeurea that will
propagate peace or ' precipitate a spirit
that will undermine our present literary
and religious Institutions, overthrowing
the highest Ideals of the fathera and
founders of a constitution Intended for
the life and liberty of thoae following
tn the wake of civilisation' a morn:
Perhapa tho greatest question la that
of preparedness; and the question arises,
"preparedness for what?" There la but
one answer. A peace propaganda that
will silence the guns of powers, princes
and potentates ' of the world. To auc
cesafully prosecute the work of promul
gating peace, preparedness la needed at
an estimated coat of at least IISO.OOO.OOO.
Take It for granted thla sum la raised,
tha next move will be to build navies and
guna a little bigger than tha other fel
low. With the spirit that prevail now,
what will be the result? The productive
soil of the husbandman will run red
with human blood, with bone and sinew,
enriching the mother earth. Our ; high
seas colored with gore! for the sake of
protecting honor, home and native land.
The eet and hand of coming m'lllon
must be taxed to protect thoae who
rule the earth and commercial lnter
eata. Will we stand for it? Let the "Jingo"
build his cross of gold. Let the would
be statesman who claims to be ataodtng
at Armageddon battling for the Lord,
battle away. Let the evangelist who
deal In fires of eternal torment for mer
cenary motives brighten corners for the
hottentot and hot headed heads of war
ring nationa of the other landa. Let the
military spirit of earth be given a death
blow without the shedding of human
blood. Let honest toll with reasonable
reward become one of the fundamental
principles of our Industrial system. Let
us return to "mush and milk" and first
principles and there la no doubt, but the
world will grow better If not wlaer.

PLAIN VI E3W, Neb., Dec. 14. To the
Editor of The Bee: President I Wilson's
message to congreaa la a aurprlae to a
great many people of the union, the
only one of Ita kind In tha history of
the United States. No president before
Wilson urged "preperedneae." which
meana militarism In time of peace. No
president ever attacked an entire nation
of "hyphenated Americans." ss he terms
them, for aome improper acta done
maybe' by some spies or hirelings- Tha
"hyphenated Americana" condemns un
lawful acta of any kind as well aa Mr.
Wilson, but feel insulted by utterances
of the Wilson kind.
We fear Mr. Wllaon la digging tho
grave for the democratic party. A man
who cannot control hla feraonal feellnga
la unable to lead a political party sue.
ceasfully and la undesirable aa the head
of a big nation compoaed of different
nationalities. Hla measage la liable to
prepare a aeed-bed for diaharmony
anion the different natlonalitlea In thla
country, which a wise president should
try to avoid Instead of furthering it. The
people of this union are peaceable and
It la safe to say that Wllson'a ''pre
paredness" bill would be voted down- If
put before them.
Whom does Mr. Wilson suspect a our
enemy? .
We know we can handle England be
cause we did It before. Japan la feared
by aome, but could be handled with our
present fleet if a few submerinee would
be added. It aeema aa if Mr. Wilson'a
conaclence are not clear toward Germany,
but the Germane will bother nobody if
left alone. All they aak la their plaoe

With never a whimper of pain or hate
For the sake of those who at home await.
