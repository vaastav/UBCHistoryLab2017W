Washington The passage ef tha
appropriation bill* and aa llttla other
general législation as possible. Much
In brief Is the forecast for the short
session of the Fifty ninth congre**,
which began at high noon Monday.
Thera has not yet been time for aa
general an exchange of view* among
member* a* I* ordinarily desired by
leaders before ex pressing their views,
leaders before expressing their
«town, but all seem* to regard tha
present alt union a* so simple a* to
seed comparatively little Intercourse to
arrive at an understanding, it la evi
dent for various reasons that It will not
he possible to do much on the appro
priation bill before the holidays, and
the circumstance may have the effect
of condensing tbs consideration of
tha fourteen large supply measures
Into two months. Considering that
th* aggregate of the appropriations to
be considered will spproxlmat* one
billion dollars, some senators and mem
bers express the opinion that congress
jeannot do better than glva all of Its
'time to these measures.
Th* rsport on tbe ship subsidy bill
probably will be an exception to the
rule for ao general legislation. The
friends of that tneasura have never
been more Insistent than now. They
are extremely hopeful and yet very
apprehensive.

PRESIDENT'S VIEWS.
Members of Both Houses of Congress
Liston to Annual Msssags.
Washington - President Rooaevelt's
annual message to congress occupied
tbe attention of the senate for two
and one-half hours Tuesday, to the ex
clusion of nearly all other business.
The exception to this was the intro
duction of a resolution on the Japan
ese situation by Senator Rayner of
Maryland and the adoption of appro
priate resolutions regarding those
members of the house of representa
tives who have dted since the last
session.
The reading of the president's mes
sage consumed two hours and twenty
flve minutes In the house, and was fol
lowed closely by a large number of
members, while the crowded galleries
gave close consideration.
While the house waited upon the
secretary to the president to appear
with the message. Speaker Cannon
appointed Robert O. Cousin*, of Iowa,
chairman of the committee on foreign
affairs to succeed the late Robert R.
Hitt, of Illinois. He also appointed
Representative Frank O. Ixiwden to a
place on the same committee to fill
the vacancy caused by the death of
Mr. Hitt.

Washington—In his annual report,

government Is without water trans
portation facilities In cases of emer
gency In tbe movement of troops He
cites the case of army of pacification
In Cuba, and says that the lack of
such transportation facilities was
severely felt. "Had there been a
small fleet of transports In reserve on
the Atlantic coast the movement could
have been accomplished much
sooner."
Fraise Is given to the army as a
whole for Its adaptability and re
sourcefulnevs when dealing with novel
and unprecedented conditions. Gen

Utah Coal Companies on the Grill and
Sensational Evidence Secured
Againet These Corporations.
Salt Lake City.—The conclusion of
the interstate" commerce commission
on Friday was no less sensational
than the entire proceedings have been
The Utah Fuel and allied coal com
imule» were on the grill, and the evl
dence secured against these corpora
lions was uglier. If possible, than that
secured against the Union Pacific

day that the Utah Fuel and allied
companies with the Rio Grande rail
road system, not only secured control
of the coal deposits of Utah by Win
chester peisuaslon, but for years held
full sway over the wires of the West
ern Union, thus holding all possible
means of getting relief which might
be sought by the would-be independ
ent producer.
Testimony was submitted which
showed that the combine of Rio
Grande and Rio Grande Western and
their allied coal companies secured
the largest portion of the vast coal de
posits in southern Utah; owned the
only means of transportation, thus
controlling the supply on Utah mar
kets. and was dictator supreme of the
Utah coal situation
Armed thugs. It was asserted, were
hired by the coal companies in Car
bon and other counties to keep on
any would-be Independent producers,
and these thugs played their part well.
Shooting was common during the
fights and feuds over [»»session ot
coal lands and the courts were laughed
at by the men placed in charge of the
deposits.
Secret rates were described. Charles
Livingston, a former employe of the
Utah Fuel company, asserting that his
company enjoyed a one-half cent pet
100 pounds per mile rate on freight
This rate, which was rar below tbe
regular tarifT rate, was enjoyed uni 1
