THE GREAT RUSSIAN VICTORY.
In yesterday's dispatches we find the fol
lowing :
Bucharest, Dec. 10. After a severe enage
nient yesterday before Plevna, Osman Pasha,
who was wounded, surrendered uncondition
ally. The Turks in Plevna were dying of
hunger and cold. There is great joy here.
Bucharest is covered with flags. Plevna is
now in the hands of the Russo-Roumanian
armies. The Agence-Russe makes the follow
ing announcement : "Osman Pasha attempted
to break through in the direction of Widin.
He was attacked in front and rear and was
compelled to lay down his arms after a glori
ous struggle, in which lie was seriously
wounded. All with one voice praise his conduct.
This cumes toward the realization of the
long, long dream of the Muscovite. He seems
near his inheritance. Inheritance? In the
long night which has brooded over the Greek
Church since the City of Constantine fell into
the hands of the Saracen, have not the custo
dians of the Christian faith longed for the res
toration ? The Turk is to Europe what the
American savage is at the United States,
His occupancy of Constantinople is as incon
gruous a tiling as would be the occupancy of
Xew York by the Sioux or the Nez Perces.
Think of Red Cloud at the mouth of the Hud
. son, or Joseph a recognized ruler at Xew Or
leans '. One is reminded of the old French war
and the other wars which lay along our bor
der with a wily European foe to furnish
, a ,. ... ...
arms ana information to tne rea skins. H.111;-
land, in some bitter day3, did this office. The
murdering and scalping of settlers, the blaze
of burning cabins and the shrieks of ravished
women and brain-battered children told only
too well what were the qualities of Saxon cun
ning and greed and cruelty. Somebody with
a warning voice wrote, a few years since, a
story called 'The Battle of Dorking." It was
at once a prophecy and a check. It was a
wise supplement to the Crimean War. Brit
ain had winked at Louis Napoleon's bloody
boulevards ; but Kinglake, like another seer
dealing with a new Loehiel or a later proph
etess upon the blasted heath, told but too
truly the story of that butchery. Since then
England has seen her unnatural ally once
her subject and once her dictator crushed
by the iron hand of that power which stalks
through the nightmare of the aforesaid Battle
of Dorking, and the Uhlan shakes his hand
across the German Ocean in direful threaten
ing. There is some hearty recollection in the
Court of Berlin of the stout days when Peter
the stalwart, the amorous, the rude, was ad
mired of the Potsdam Giants and their Com
mander. Indeed, since the days of Alarick
and Attila the Teutons have had an alarming
weakness for Trans-alpine raids. They have
sought the Southern sea ; they have hun
gered for that dominion which seems the heir
of strength and courage. Russia is the com
ing power. Prussia cannot afford to be the
false friend of this tremendous giant. The
"tiwht little isle'' finds itself in a dilemma
which is all the worse for the inconsistencies
of its professions. To be sure the Greek
Church is even farther away from the Angli
can establishment than the Mother herself ;
but Christianity is, or ought to be, the em
bodiment of better stuff to-day than it was
when Richard smote the Infidel. The Turk
murders and ravishes and sells into slavery
and all in the name of the False? Prophet.
He flies the flag of Mohammed and flaunts it
in the face of the orifiamme of Oriental Chris
tianiiy. Say what Mr. Disraeli will, the
. watchword on his side of this fight is Allah, il
Allah! Our Parent Country has not been
either consistent or humane, in all his deal
ings. His attitude toward the Union was but
feebly atoned for by her fifteen millions of
dollars. The Trent and Maximillian, Louis
Napoleon and the hard hearted House of
Hapsbunr, these are to be reckoned in the j
count. The Morxixg Appeal hopes that the
stalwart Northern will mow his way to the
Mediteranean and sweep out of existence the
foul blot, which, with bowstring and basti
nado, with dogs and vermin, with lechery and
murder, obstructs the march of civilization
aud "snarleth in the gentle eyes of Teace."
THE FALL OF PLEVNA.
OSMAN PASHA AND HIS ARMY PRISONERS.
Bozot, Dec. 11. At 9:30 Sunday morning
Osman Pasha's entire army attacked the
Russian granadier corps holding the line of
investment on the left bank of the river Vid
endeavoring to force a passage. The attack
was made with desperate energy, and a por
tion 01 tne x urmsn troops aid m tact pene
trate the line of entrenchments and batteries,
but all attempts to break through the position
grenadiers was inaffectual. After five hours'
severe fighting the Turks were defeated.
osman irasna, surrounuea on all sides, was
compelled to surrender with his whole army,
Up to the presnt time it is impossible to esti
mate the number of Turkish prisoners or the
quantity of war material taken. We only
know that everything in Plevna has fallen
into our hands. The Russian leases are in
considerable compared with the result ob
tained.
Bucharest, Dec. 10. After a severe engage
meiit before Plevna yesterday, Osman Pasha,
who was woundod, surrendered uncondition
aliy. Ihe Turks in Plevna are dying 0f
hunger and cold. There is great joy here.
Bucharest is covered with flags. Plevna is
now in the hands of the Russo-Roumanian
armies.
The Agence-Russe makes the following an
nonncement: "Osman Pasha attempted to
break through in the direction of Widin. He
was attacked front and rear and was com
pelled to lay down his arms after a glorious
struggle, in which he was seriously wounded. "
A'l wiih one voice praise his conduct.
St. Petersburg, Dec. 11. The news of the
fall of Plevna occasions great rejoicing here.
The theaters are celebrating the victory by
additions to the usual programmes. Enthusi
astic popular demonstration in honor of the
Imperial family and the army are made in the
streets and public p'aces, where great crowds
are assembled cheering and singing the na
tiona1 anthem. The city is partially illumin-
aeii.
London, December 11. This day will wit
ness scenes of the wildest excitement in Lon
don. All the morning papers print a dis
patch from Bucharest, dated at 9 o'clock last
night, declaring that Osman Pasha surren
dered Plevna on Sunday, and that all the
Turkish fortifications are in possession of the
Russians and Roumanian armies. All the
pent up anxiety and hope of the friends of
Turkey in England will come to an end to
day. A cruel and crushing blow has been
dealt to blatant paneg3-rist who have for
month past been telling of the prowess of the
Turkish troops. Osman w ill cease to be a
hero, although the reports from official Rus
sian sources speak of his courage in the hour
of defeat. Still he has failed, and the Tmk -philes
of England will never forgive him.
The following strange item in relation to
the examination of the murderer, Pierce, i.-.
from the Silver State of Saturday:
The preliminary examination of W. II.
Pierce for the murder of M. B. Hayes w as
concluded last Thursday, and the case was
taken under advisement by the grave Justice,
who will decide whether or not he should be
Jield.
Thk Rei Foxes at Washjxc.tox. On the
2d of December, in Washington, Secretary
Schurz was disagreeably surprised by the un
announced apparition of a delegation of Fox
Indians a tribe never very welcome at the
Interior Department, which is sufficiently
human not to patiently brook the presence of
people it has in times past grievously injured
Mr. Schurz was sufficiently curious to ask
these Foxes why they had come to Washing
ton, and was immediately snubbed by being
told that they had nothing to say to him
about it, but would inform the Great Father.
The Secretary sharply responded that they
must pay their own expenses, to which the
red men rejoined that they had paid their
railroad fare from the reservation, and felt
able to settle their hotel bills. The story of
the Sacs and Foxes, says the N. Y. Sun, car
ries us back about half a century to the days
of Black Hawk, and the bloody war he fought
with the whites. After this famous warrior
had been subdued, and shown around as a
captive in Eastern cities, he was succeeded in
authority by Keokuk, who was followed by
another chief of the same name, quite famous
for his faithful and friendly disposition during
more than twenty years. The united tribes
of the Sacs and Foxes were moved further
and further West, with the advances of civil
ization, first being placed just beyond the
Mississippi, and then far out in Kansas. The
invested proceeds of the sales of their easterly
lands netted the two tribes an annual income
of about 850,000, which, of course, proved an
enormous attraction to the Government
agents and traders, who so managed that for
a long time a great portion of it went into
their own pockets. As the constant "civili
zation of these Indians m reservation lite
and the healthfuj arts of agriculture, in addi
tion to war and pestilence, had reduced their
numbers greatly, so that from numbering over
ten thousand before contact with the whites
thev became fewer than a thousand, the
annual income gave each quite a sum to ex
pend, and as we have seen makes their chiefs
very self-sustaining in the matter of hotel
bills.
Precisely what grievance has brought them
to Washingtoiais not yet clear; but, despite
the unaccountable failure of Mr. Schurz to
inspire them with instant confidence on
showing them his face, it has been learned
that these Foxes complain of wrongs done
them since the sale of their Kansas lands and
the retaining of the proceeds.
If any doubt exists as to the fate deserved
by the Old Doctor Jacob Townsend of the
Sazerackers the following will dispel it: A
lady was pushing a baby perampulator along
the sidewalk on Main street this morning,
when one of the wheels struck a piece of four
thousand dollar ruby ore, which some care
less person had dropped on the walk, and the
vehicle was instantly upset and its infantile
contents unceremoniously dumped out on the
sidewalk. A gentleman standing by observed
the disaster, and with the true gallantry of
his sex, rushed to the rescue, and as he right
ed the carriage and felt the baby to see how
many of its bones were broken, he said to the
lady: "Madame, why is this catastrophe like
one of the important towns involved in the
present bloody and disastrous war now being
waged by the Russian Bear against the Sick
Man of the East ?" She said she gave it up,
and wondered if the baby was hurt much.
"Because," said he, "it is a Tirnova." In
her own mind the lady found excuse tor him
on the ground that he must have been drinking-
In New York, as well as in our own city, the selection of
Mi-. Welsh for he English mission is highly approved on
all grounds. Journal of Commerce.
Especially on the ground of Mr. Welsh's
extraordinary wisdom and his miraculous
ability to conduct diplomatic affairs, as illus
trated in his semi-idiotic speech in Philadel
phia, and the general kissing scene which pre
ceded his departure. A less unanimous
reason for admiration over his appointment is
found in the fact that at one time Mr. Welsh
was a joint owner of the Purlo sugar estaLe in
Cuba with 138 slaves; so that he is either a
slaveholder now, or, if he has disposed of his
estate, as has been claimed, he is a slave seller.
This is not regarded by everybody as consti
tuting so clear a title to be Minister to Eng
land as the fact that he is afflicted with the
en;tremest silliness of egotism and vanity, and
has not sense enough to conceal it. N. Y. Sua.
Pres-pent Hayes in Favor ok Woman's
St ffkaoe. On the 3d of the present
month, as we learn from a dispatch in the N.
Y. Sun, Mrs. J. Spencer and Mrs. Sargent,
fe of the Senator, had an interview with
the President. They asked him to recom
mend in his annual message legislation by
which women should be recognized in for
eign as well as domestic appointments. Also,
that he recommend an amendment to the
constitution to secure women's sufferage in
the States. The President replied that at a
future time he might state, in writing, his
views on the subject, but would now say that
if Congress should recommend for adoption
by the States such amendment to the Consti
tution it would meet with his approval.

Letters that Require Restampixo. Dec.
11. The Postmaster General has issued the
following instructions to Postmasters: Under
a uniform ruling of this Department the right
to forward letters by mail to a second desti
nation without additional postage applies to
such letters only as have not left the custody
of the postal officials. When a letter carrier
calls at a hotel with letters for parties who
have given the proprietors instructions to
forward their mail to another address, the
proprietor should at once redirect such letters
and return them to the carrier, in which case
they may be forwarded without additional
postage; but if the carrier is allowed to leave
them at the hotel, or if they are taken out of
his presence, they are regarded as having
been legally delivered and they cannot again
be mailed without prepayment anew, of at
least one full rate of postage, three cents, by
stamp affixed.
Twins and Triplets. In Xewark, N. J.
on the 3d instant, there was a baby show,
which included 241 single babies, 17 pairs of
twins, and one set of triplets. The majority
of the mothers were young and pretty, and
most of them were Americans. The Centen
nial baby born on July 4, 1S76, was a favo
rite, but the novelty was a mite of a baby
shown by the mother, Mrs. Dorset, who
weighs fully 180 pounds. The babe weighed
lj pounds at birth, and now weighs 3 pounds.
It is 6 weeks old. Another baby weighed
18 pounds at birth. Mrs. Mclntyre of 121
Belmont avenue, is the mother of Amelia,
Lottie, and Lizzie, bouncing triplets, aged
one year.
A clerical friend urged Whately much for
an opinion as to his reading of the church
service, and he said at last, M ell, then, if
you really wish to know what I think of your
reading, I should say there are only two parts
of the service you read well, and those you
read faultlessly." "Which are they ?" "They
are, ' Here endeth the first lesson,' and
' Here endeth the second lesson ;' for those
are the only parts which you read in your
natural voice and manner, which are very
good ; the rest is all artificial. "
