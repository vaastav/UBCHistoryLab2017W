NEGRO TROOPS
PROVED GUILTY
ROOSEVELT REITERATES DECLA
RATION WITH REGARD TO
BROWNSVILLE RIOT.
FEW EXCEPTIONS NAMED
In Special Message Recommends Thai
Those Not Guilty Who Divulged
Knowledge Be Allowed
to Re-Enlist.
Washington, D. C. President
Roosevelt, in his special message
Monday accompanying the report of
Investigator Herbert J. Browne into
tho shooting up of Brownsville, Tex.,
reiterates his former declaration that
tho shooting by colored soldiers has
been "established beyond any possi
bility of doubt."
Ho again recommends the passage
of a law by congress offering tho dis
charged soldiers an opportunity to re
enlist In the army if they can clear
themselves of responsibility for the
murderous attack to the satisfaction
of tho secretary of war.
The investigation will be continued,
the president says, in order to sep
arate the "less guilty from those
whoso guilt was heinous," for ho be
lieves there were hardly any Innocent
among the colored men stationed at
Fort Brown.
Among tho documents accompany
ing Brown's report are the confession
of Boy Conyers, a private in Company
B, Twenty-fifth Infantry, who claimed
to be a leader in the affair; tho affi
davit of William Lawson, a detective
to whom Conyers made his confes
sion; a summary of the testimony in
volving Conyors, Private Carolina de
Baussure, Sergt. J. R. Reld and oth
ers, and the opinions of experts as to
the identity of the ammunition used in
the raid.
The letter which is incorporated in
the message" follows:
"To the Senate: I inclose herewith
a letter from the secretary of war
transmitting a report of the investiga
tion made by Mr. Herbert J. Browne,
employed by the department In con
junction with Capt. W. G. Baldwin to
investigate as far as possible what
happened at Brownsville on the 13th
and 14th of August, 190G.
"The report and documents contain
some information of great value and
some statements that are obviously
worthless, but I submit them in their
entirety.
"This report enables us to fix with
tolerable deflnlteness at least some of
the criminals who took the lead In
the murderous shooting of private cit
izens of Brownsville.
Negroes Did Shooting.
"It establishes clearly the fact that
the colored soldiers did the shooting;
but upon this point further record was
annecessary, as the fact that the col
ored soldiers did the shooting has al
ready been established beyond all pos
sibility of doubt.
"The investigation has not gone far
enough to enable us to determine all
the facts, and we will proceed with It;
but it has gone far enough to deter
mine with sufficient accuracy certain
facts of enough importance to make it
advisable that I place the report be
fore you.
"It appears that almost all the mem
bers of Company B must have been
actively concerned in the shooting,
either to the extent of being partici
pants or to the extent of virtually en
couraging those who were partici
pants. "As to Companies C and D there
can be no question that practically
every man in them must have had
knowledge that the shooting was done
by some of the soldiers of B Troop,
and possibly by one or two others in
one of the other troops.
"This concealment was itself a
grave offense, which was greatly ag
gravated by their testifying before the
senate committee that they were ig
norant of what they must have known.
"Nevertheless, it is to be said in
partial extenuation that they were
probably cowed by threats, made by
the more desperate of the men who
had actually been engaged in tho
shooting, as to what would happen to
any man who failed to protect tho
wrongdoers.
"Moreover, there are circumstances
tending to show that these misguided
men were encouraged by outsiders to'
persist in their course of concealment
jind denial.
.."I feel, therefore, that tho guilt of
the men who, after the event, thus
shielded tho perpetrators of the wrong
by refusing to tell tfifr truth about
iKem, though serious, was in part due
to, the unwise and Improper attitude of
titude of others, and that -some meas
ure of allowance should' lie made for
the misconduct.

ROOSEVELT INQUIRY
REPRESENTATIVE PERKINS SUP
PORTS RESOLUTION.
EVERY MEMBER VOTES FOR IT
Lloyd of Missouri, With Others, to
Decide Just What action Shall Be
Taken Text of Resolution.
Washington, D. C. Representa
tive Perkins of New York spoko to
tho house on the resolution appoint
ing n committee to tnke the secret
service paragraph in the president's
message Into consideration, In tho
midst of a silence and an attention
thnt were both strained and dramatic.
Tho applause that greeted the end
of the speech was subdued. Tho mem
bers and galleries seemed to appre
ciate the gravity of tho matter in
hand.
The resolution was adopted by a
unanimous vote, and these members
pere appointed by the speaker to mem
bership on the committee:
Representative Perkins of New
York, Denby of Michigan, Lldyd of
Missouri, Williams of Mississippi arid
Weeks of Massachusetts.
Text of Resolution.
This Is the text of the resolution:
"Whereas. There was contained in
the sundry civil appropriation bill,
and which passed congress at its last
session and became a law, a provision
In reference to the employment of the
secret service in tho treasury depart
ment; and,
"Whereas, In the message of the
President of the United States to the
two Houses of Congress, it was stated
in reference to that provision: 'It is
not too much to say that this amend
ment has been of benefit only, and
could be of benefit only to the crim
inal classes only,' and it was further
stated, 'The chief argument in favor
of the provision was that congress
men did not themselves wish to, be in
vestigated by secret service men,' and
it was further stated, 'But if this is
not considered desirable, a special
provision could be made in the law,
prohibiting the use of the secret ser
vice force in investigating members of
congress. It would be far better to
do this, than to do what actually was
done, and strive to prevent, or at least
to hamper action against criminals by
the executive branch of the govern
ment.' "Now, therefore, be It
"Resolved, That a committee of five
members of this house be appointed
by the speaker to consider the state
ments contained in the message of the
president and report to the house
what action, if any, should be taken
In reference thereto."
Perkins Takes Floor.
In presenting the resolution, Mr.
Perkins said:
"I arise to a question of the privi
lege of the house.
"I do not believe in oversensitlve
ness to unfavorable criticism, whether
upon an individual or upon a public
body. But, while there may be undue
sensitiveness, st also there may be
undue obtuseness, which might argue
a lack of propel self-respect.
"It is of importance to the republic
that all of the co-ordinate branches of
the government should possess, in a
high degree the confidence and re
spect of the people.
"I yield to ho one in my respect foi
the chief executive of the United
States, and I yield to no one in my
respect for the congress of the United
States. To the congress is granted
great power, and upon it are imposed
great responsibilities.
"The dignity of this body should not
be punctiliously insisted upon, but it
should be properly maintained.
"The statements made by the presi
dent of tho United States cannot be
lightly disregarded. These may be so
construed by the public as to lessen
tho dignity and thereby impair the
usefulness of the congress of the
United States. It can be justly said,
I think, that those expressions were
unfortunate.
"Whether it Is enough to say this or
whether some more formal action
should be taken, It will be for con
gress, exercising a wise and dlscreot
judgment to decide."

Washington, Dec. 12. With great
enthusiasm the congress of rivers and
harbors at its concluding session hero
Friday placed itself on record in favor
of tho issuance of government bonds
for tho improvement of the great

clared for an authorized issue by con
gress at its present session of $500,
000,000 worth of bonds, the proceeds
to be used in the payment exclusively
for such river and harbor work as may
be authorized by congress, provision
for the issue to bo similar to the
Panama canal bonds.
A committee presented to Vice

to be able to silence the Venezuelan
shore batteries in a short time.
Ready to Fire Any Moment.
Caracas Venezuela Wednesday
Is prepared for war with Hol
land, and the first unfriendly act by
any one of the Dutch warships will
be the signal for the, beginning of hos
tilities. Anticipating bombardment by the
Holland men-of-war, which have made
a naval demonstration along the Vene
zuelan coast, the minister of war has
hurried to La Guayra to assume full
command of the government forces
there.
That tho government has resolved
to open Are upon tho first Dutch war
vessel that commits an unfriendly act
is evidenced by tho fact that the min
ister of war took with him to La
Guayra 30 carloads of ammunition.
The situation Is regarded as serious
and the greatest excitement prevails
here. It is the general belief that war
Is inevitable, and preparations for a
clash are being made everywhere.

New York, N. Y. The attack on
James E. Sullivan, president of the
A. A. U., and American commissioner
to last summer's Olympic games, by
an English writer, may result In an
international athlete war. Sullivan
and Gustav Klrby, who was also at
tacked, are now preparing a bomb to
toss Into tho British athletic camp,
and when this missile explodes it is
expected that tho reputation for
sportsmanship of tho British Isles will
suffer. Sullivan's annual report of
10,000 words to the A. A. U. delegates
at the recent meeting was a bitter
pill for the Englishmen to swallow,
and was responsible for the English
Amateur Athletic association author
izing Henry La Bouchere's attack on
American athletes.

Miss Express Car.
In tho darkness tho bandits failed to
note that the first car was the mail
car, the second the baggage car and
that the express car, which contained
the desired booty, was third in the
train. Perrin realized the robbers'
mistake and quickly took advantage
of it.
In spite of the menacing revolver
held close to his head, he cut off tho
mall and baggage cars, leaving the
express car attached to the dead train.
The robbers then left tho engineer
and fireman with tho train and board
ed tho locomotive and themselves ran
It several miles east, where they
brought it to a stop, rifled the mall
car, then again boarded tho engine,
uncoupling it from the cars, which
they left on tho track, and proceeded
three miles to Mead. There a convey
ance was awaiting them and they
made their escape. Mead is only 10
miles from Spokane, and It is sup
posed that the bandits, have made
their way back to Spokane. -The
amount of their booty is unknown.

IN CANAL CHARGES,
HINTS AT DEAL ARE LIES
Declares Charges Made In New York
World Are Baseless and Gives ,
List of Share Owners In the
Panama Canal.
Washington, D. (3. In languago
probably moro 'emphatically denunci
atory than has even been used before
In such n document, President Roose
velt Tuesday, In a special messago
to congress, arraigns Joseph Pulitzer
of tho New York World, In particu
lar, and other critics of tho admin
istration in general, for their recent
charges with respect to tho purchase
of the Panama Caunl.
He characterizes tho accusations as
scurrilous, libelous nnd false, In every
essential particular; submits docu
mentary evidence to support his con
tentions; brands Mr. Pulitzer by name
as a vlllifier of the American people
and declares his purpose of bringing
a governmental action for libel. Tho
message, In part, reads as follows:
"In view of tho constant reiteration
of the assertion that there was some
corrupt action by, or on behalf of, tho
United States government, in connec
tion with tho acquisition of the title of
tho French company to the Panama
canal, nnd of the repetition of tho
story that a syndicate of American
citizens owned cither one or both of
the Panama companies, I deem it
wise to submit to congress all tho in
formation I have on the subject.
To His Attention From Indianapolis.
"These stories were first brought to
my attention as published In a paper
In Indianapolis, called tho News, ed
ited by Mr. Delavan Smith. The sto
ries were scurrilous and libelous in
character and false in every essential
particular. Mr. Smith shelters him
self behind the excuse that he merely
accepted the statements which had ap
peared in a paper published in New
York, the World, owned by Mr.
Joseph Pulitzer.
"It is idle to say that the known
character of Pulitzer and his newspa
per are such that the statement In
that paper will be believed by nobody;
unfortunately, thousands of persons
are ill-informed in this respect, and
believe the statements they sco in
print, even though they appear in a
newspaper published by Mr. Pulitzer.
A member of congress has actually
introduced a resolution in reference
to these charges. I therefore lay all
the facts before you."
Charges Recited by the President.
Here the president recited the 'vari
ous charges, including those against
Charles P. Taft, brother of William H.
Taft, and Douglas Robinson, the presi
dent's brother-in-law, of participation
in the $40,000,000 purchase fund.

ROOSEVELT TO HIT BACK.
"Bulletts" for Congress if It Rebukes
Him for Secret Service Message.
Washington. "President Roosevelt
never shoots In the air," said a.
member of congress Saturday
to another who was asking If thero
was any thought that the president
had bullets as well as powder to Are
hack at the house and senate if they
should rebuke him in a resolution sav
age enough to bring a quick Are re
sponse. The belief is that tho president has
material which is contained in offi
cial but unpublished reports, which,
if made public, would cause conster
nation lr. some fairly high places.
It is not to be conceived that Roose
velt wants to use this material if he
has It, but, for the thousandth time,
It must be said he Is a fighter, and will
hold that self-defense does not consist
merely in parrying.
One of the most prominent repre
sentatives said Saturday that ho had
no doubt at all that there could he a
response from tho White House to
any censure that congress might In
flict, and that ho believed some men.
would bo hurt.
