It can be easily seen from tho forogolng
that Hungary Is naturally the ally ot Rus
sia but Hungary will novcr forget tho
action ot Russia In crushing out tho rebel
lion of 1849 when It was Just about to as
sumothotormof a successful revolution
and Is now only too pleased to bavo tho op
portunity of Indicating her revengo by tho
prompt and energetic support of Ilttlo Bul
garia
Tbo Austrian portion of tho emplro Is
almost purely German and by nature race
language and geographical position tho
enemy of Russia In case of tbo saltans
western empire going to pieces Austria
still controlling Bosnia und Herzegovina
and on fraternal terms with Scrvb Rou
mania and Bulgaria has tho high road to
Constantinople If Russia should dlsputo
tho path tho sword of Bismarck or ot his
successor will bo thrown lu tbo scalo on be
half of Austria verifying Kalnokys recent
utterance that although tbo Germans ot
Austria and of Prussia havo many opposing
Interests they nro ono In heart In language
and In race and wo may add ouo also In
designs upon tho south of Europe nnd In
opposition to tho further extension of
Russian territory upon the European side
It Is then quite upon tho cards that Bul
garias temporary mtsfortuuo has given
Austria an opportunity which may lead to
a permanent and unexpected triumph for
tbe people of tbo many tongucd emplro
There aro many points ot view from
which tbo great subject may bo recorded
but to tho student of history or tho Intelli
gent observer of nation making currents
there can bo tow such Interesting problems
as tbo position which Austria Is likely to
assumo when tho tlmo comes tor another
readjustment of tbo map ot Europe

80 per cent nd valorem
fl per cent ad valorem
In March 1875 25 per rent nd valorem was
added to theso figures aud In Amjust lU
this 25 per cent ad valorem was taken oft
leaving tbo duty as It was fixed In 1870
Thus It will bo seen tbat from tbo first
meeting of Congress until tho beginning ot
the rebellion thero was a heavy Import duty
on sugar except during thirteen years tbat
alter tbo acquisition ot Louisiana our only
sugar producing country that this duty
was largely Increased and that In 1600 out
of 415000 tons of sugar consumed 130000
tons or 35 per rent was mado In this coun
try
Louisiana produced nearly all ot this
sugar n email quantity being mado In
Texas and Florida Tbe war of tho rebel
lion totally destroyed sugar production so
that In 1C0 the year of Its close only
8C0O tons wero produced out of 391000
tons consumed
Hut tbo heavy duties levied In 1803
solely to produco rcveuuo becauso thero
was not a pound of sugar raised In tho loyal
states stimulated tho production lu Louisi
ana so tbat In four years It was nearly 80
000 tons Instead of 8500
In 1870 Louisiana having again taken Its
place In Congress tbo rate of duties were
cbarged somewhat to afford It still greater
protection and In 1875 uhen Congress be
came Democratic 25 per cent was added to
tbo already high rate of duty for tho pur
pose of helping tho Louisiana sugar
pantcre Louisiana tbat year produced
one eleventh ot tho sugar consumed In tho
country and It docs not produco quite
that amount now
Tbo effort mado by tho Republican party
to stlmulato tho production ot cana sugar
by a protcctlvo tariff has now lastoil twenty
years When It began tho country pro
duced one eleventh of the sugar consumed
ancTat tho close of tho twenty years It pro
duces one twelfth of tho amount consumed
During that timo tho government has
collected ono thousand million dollars from
tho pcoplo upon ono of the ncccssirles of
life and Is to day collecting ouo dollar a
year from every man woman and child In
tbo country to aid tbs Louisiana sugar
planters
For each pound ot sugar raised In Louis
iana during theso twenty years tho paoplo
havo paid alter paying for tho sugar they
use nearly tnenty ntnecenti
Averaging tbo population at 45000000
each Inhabitant has paid tucnty two dollars
lax on sugar to aid the Louisiana sugar
planters
Is It not tlmo to stop this foolishness J
Tbo pcoplo could betterafford to take every
sugar planter In Louisiana and board him
nnd his family at tho St Charles Hotel In
New Orleans during tho winter and at tho
Grand Union at Saratoga In the summer
than to contlnuo tho present method of
keeping them
It Is very desirable tbat tbo country
should produco food clothing and arms
for homo consumption and a protcctlvo
tariff becauso of tbo countrys great variety
of cllmato and soil and Us varied mineral
resources will Coubtlcss cuablo It do so
with all articles not of tropical growth
But the experiment has failed so far ns
sano sugar Is roncerned and It Is tlmo to
call a halt as tho government do6s not any
longer need tbo revenue derived from tbo
duties on sugar
In disposing of this EUbJect Congress
should consider ono fact and that Is this
that tho family ot tho poor man who earns
bis bread by tho sweat ot bis brow will In a
year consumo as much sugar and molasses
as tbo family of tho same slzo ot tbo mil
lionaire who clips tbo coupons from govern
ment nnd railroad bonds or collects tho
rent from a thousand tenements
An Autonomous Administration
Iu speaking ot tbe land of Mallctoa tho
President Informs Congress that with n
cbango in tbo representation of all tbreo
powers Germany Great Britain aud the
United States and a harmonious under
standing between them tho peace prosper
ity autonomous administration and neu
trality of Samoa can hardly fall to be se
cured
This Is a pleasant dream superinduced by
a conscrvatlvo slumber Tho truth Is
Samoa ono ot theso days will bo merged
Into tbo German colonial possessions so
suddenly and effectually that It will stay
thero In pplto of tho growl of tho Hon and
tbo screech of tho caglo Tho flrstand most
Important steps havo already been taken to
sccuro this result Tho Hamburg mer
chants havo placed their commercial yoko
upon tho trade of tho Island and havo for
ears virtually controlled tho local govern
ment This commercial lnfluonco sus
tained by tbo almost constant prcsenco of
German war vessels Is gradually working
out tho deep laid plans which characterize
Bismarcks colonial aggressions aud an
nexation Is coming Just as sura as tho
Camcrun incident camo
The American pcoplo will awako somo
morning to find that tho autonomous ad
ministration of Samoa which tho President
so modestly hopes for Is under tho complete
control of tho Hamburg commercial and
Berlin political authorities
Mn C M Cady ot Atlanta Co has an
Interview In tho Galveston Kews In which
ho suggests a novel and somewhat striking
Idea on tbo subject of river and harbor Im
provements Mr Cady proposes that In
all cases w hero tbo federal government Is
called upon to furnish tbo money for Im
proving rivers or harbors tho cities or
states to bo Immediately benefited should
undertake to pay ono belt tho cost ot tho
proposed undertaking For example sup
posing It would cost eight millions to se
cure deep water In tbo harbor of Galveston
tho state ot Texas and tha city ot Galveston
or both should undcrtako to supply one
half of tbo sum Thus It Is suggested tbo
federal treasury would bo called upon to
help only tboso who aro willing to help
themselves and besides thero would It Is
believed bo much greater caro and watch

Sieakino ot tho estimates of expendi
tures for tho noxt fiscal year tho Albany
Join mil notices that It Is proposed to
spend 30000000 on river nnd harbor Im
provements of which over 7500000 Is
devoted to tho Mississippi river and re

Tho Mississippi river Is tho rival or tho
water system of which tho Erlo canal Is an
essential part Thero la tho greatest Injusllco
In spending so large a sum for tho benefit or
ouo system of water transportation whllo tho
competing Bjstem Is left to Bhlfl for Itself
Every patriotic man wishes to sco every part
of Iho country prosper and thero is certainly
trado enough from tho west to rcqulro both
the I Mississippi and Erlo canal routes to tho
seaboard Thero should bo at least nn ap
proach toward fairness In tho treatment of
theso two waterways by Congress
Onoot theso highways Is tbo work of

molasses cheaper than they can bo obtained
frcm tho Sandwich Islands China to diy
produces a largo quantity of sujar on her owu
territory below tho frost lino ou which resldo
sixty millions out of her population of four
hundred millions China does not ovou at

rcople Tha trado with China I as Importint
to us as Iho reciprocity treaty with tbo people
of tho Hawaiian Islands With both peoples
and governments It Is tho act of statesmanship
to maintain tho most friendly rcUtlons
Tbo American pcoplo ara dctermlucd that
thero shall bo no Importation of any class of
lcrvllo labor under a contract aystom which Is
akin to slavery In Joint this they do not
deslro to destroy or to placo nn embargo upon

and lntcrcourso with tha pcoplo of CMua or
of Italy both nations having furulshol a class
of contract labor which we cannot tolerate any

Tho press of tho Dominion of Canada takes a
deep Interest In that rortof your messag
which refers to them Your attention Is
especially Invited to tho speech delivered In

Island to Capo Brctou on tho Atlantic from
which latter point steamers lo Liverpool will
speed across Iho ocean In about four days
This great artery has opened up a territory
largcrtban tho United Btatcacxcludlng Alaska
In this connection your attention Is alto In
vited to tbo map lu this Issuo setting forth tho
projects of England ono year ago which then
a prophecy aro now becoming a reality
Intllrh statesmen havo a commercial policy
which they execute no matter what adminis
tration Is In po cr Tho Dominion of Canada
w 111 toon to bound by commercial tics with
tbo mother country nt tho highway
for tho trado of China Japan Australia and
tho Islands of tbo raclflo ocean Their ln
tcrctlo sovriU ami mutual will prevent tho
adoption by Canada of a reciprocity treaty with
tbo Vnlted States which they would now
gladly make aud center her trado and travel
into tbo Atlautlo ports or this nation In re
turning tler cars would bo filled with our
manufactures nnd merchandise
Gi n Grant was right In ono of his messigcs
