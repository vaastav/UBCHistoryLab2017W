WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—Some of the political

TELEGRAXATIC.—The intrinsic value of a vast pro
portion of the sensation items sent over the wires
to the fast New York journals, may be in some
measure estimated from Ihe following despatch in
yesterday's Tribune:
CHARLESTON, December 2. — Governor Gist has
received a letter from Maj. Lees, commanding the
Baltimore National Volunteers, a light horse regi
ment, thirteen hundred strong, saving that the
regiment has unanimously resolved to support with
their lives any State or States in secession from
this accursed league, and tendering their services
in the event of coercion.
The "National Volunteers" got off a very gallant
procession here a few nights before the election,
one feature of which was about seven hundred men
mounted on horse, which looked very well by
torch-light. We doubt, however, whether any
warlike purpose was ever entertained bv three
dozen individuals of the whole body, which looked
about as much like a "light horse regiment" as it
did like a polk of Cossacks.
IMPORTANT FROM PARAGUAY. —News from Asun
cion, Paraguay, is to September 20. Improve
ments of various kinds were progressing. Houses
are going up in all directions, the streets are well
lighted, several workshops have been added to the
arsenal, the railroad is advancing to completion,
and there is a new steamer on the stocks, built en
tirely by Paraguayans. There is every confidence
that the United States claims will be settled with
strict justice, but the relations with Great Britain
are not so satisfactory; that Power refusinsr to
abate one jot from her original demands. Busi
ness has not been so brisk, owing to the short to
bacco crop. Exports for July and August amount
ed to $430,000, and imports to only SIBO,OOO. Dou
bloons are worth fourteen hard silver dollars,
and the dollar is worth $1.25 American currency.
JOHN BROWN THE SUBJECT OF A SERMON. —On Sun
day night a sermon was preached at Sbiloh Church
by the Rev, Henry Garnett, on the subject of the
death of John Brown, that day being, as they
stated, "the anniversary of his martyrdom " The
service was opened by the Rev. Mr. Ambrose
(white), who a:so offered up prayer, and the Rev.
Mr. Constantine (also white) read the 58th chapter
of Isaiah. The Herald, says: The preacher was
more than usually excited in his remarks, at one
time causing a slight attempt at applanse, which
was repeated, and several times eliciting hearty
tittering. The church was filled to overflowing",
more than half the congregation being white. The
Rev. Mr. Prime (colored) delivered the benedic
tion.
The Hon. Caleb Cashing says that whatever may
have been done on board the dames Gray in regard
to the Palmetto flag, was done "without any orders,
knowledge or privity on the part of either ot my
brothers or of myself; and that our first and only
knowledge of the matter at the time was derived
from the telegraphic statement as it appeared in
rarious shapes in the newspapers of Boston."
THE DAILY EXCHANGE.
CITY INTELLIGENCE
THE PAGODA ONCE MORE. —[The accuracy ef our
reporter having been called in question, in his ac
count of this place in yesterday morning's Ex
change, we were induced to send a different one
last night, and the following is the result of his ob
servations. The first visit was on Thanksgiving
evening, and we have no doubt it was described
with perfect truth.— EDS.]
The reporter was very politely treated by every
body, sentinels to the citadel or pagoda, and pro
cured a very good seat. The hour of his arrival,
however, was rather early, only a few of the gas
burners of the establishment being in operation, and
these principally about the bar, in the south-east
corner of the twenty-cent apartment. The first
thing attracting the attention of the observer, af
ter taking a nice seat, was a voice behind, saying:
"Let's have something, Jack; I don't owe nothing
now; bv God! it is the first time " Barkeeper
responds quietly, and puts out a bottle of whiskey.
The young man who spoke of his non-incumbrance
then caught the bottle, and poured out a horn, his
friend, who seemed to be-an employee, took lager,
they touched glasses and swallowed.
The audience began to increase. The ten-cent
tier filled up more rapidly than the parquette. Its
visitors were mostly boys and lads from fourteen
to sixteen years of age, the greater part of them
smoking cigars, and as they entered, calling out in
improper language to such friends as they esoied
in other parts of the bouse. In the parquette there
was not much of a crowd. The audience here was
composed apparently of countrymen and boatmen
from the Eastern Shore, a few seemingly genteel
individuals there evidently from curiosity, some
youths smoking cigars, and a great many Baltimore
loafers. A considerable time was spent by the au
dience listening to the music of the band out on the
balcony, and some impatience was manifested by
those who had "paid their money" to have some
"physic" up stairs. This desire was expressed by
whistling, yelling, and singing out, "any other
man."
At the hour announced for the performances, a
supe came out to light the stage lamps, and was
| received in a most enthusiastic manner, by calls or
"supe," "skeleton," "go it," "that aint the bill!"
"Ob, ain't that pretty?" In a few minutes
the orchestra was seated, the first fiddle smoking a
long cigar. The performance commenced by Uic
playing of the overture from "11 Trovatorc," very
creditably done. Curtain rises. The "Star Span
gled Banner," by the whole company. The first
singer, a male, with moustache and beard, occupied
the centre, holding the American flag in the left
hand. On his right, was a young lady dressed in
shorts, with a small show of legs, looking at both
sides of the house at the same time. She was sup
ported by two younger females, the right being
held by an individual in a grey suit, assuming the
position of the first Napoleon, as gotten up by the
plaster figure makers. On the left of the man
with the flag, there was the same support of fe
males and a male. The song was sung and encored.
Time for lager.
On this evening the female waiters described in
yesterday's Exchange were re-placed by boys, in
shirt-sleeves, flying around, inviting to lager by
their pleasant (?) countenances. Not much busi
ness. Music again. Two maidens come forth and
dance a Highland jig—then enter a nigger dancer,
and song, "Oh, Lord, gals, don't you see us ki
ting." The veiled songstress follows. The "song
stress" is dressed in a white skirt, black bodice and
a flowing black scarf. A black mask hides every
thing but the mouth, from which sounds issue
which so please the audience that she has to re
turn, hut following the true operatic style, she
changes ber song and giyes something which the
audience did not expect, and did not want. She
retires amid great applause and cries of "any other
man," some "lagers," Ac., and the boys in shirt
sleeves skip about more lively.
The bell rings again, and out comes a male, in
tended to represent a Yankee, and a female, in
tended to represent his sweetheart. They com
mence a duet, and they do it with a vengeance.
The man calls the woman "Sal," and he telis her
to " lay low tor ducks," and Sal tells him to get
on his knees, and asks him "if he knows how to do
it," and he says " what ?"—[great applause]—she
says "pucker up, and I'll show you;" then the
male makes a face, which the female laughs at •
she then makes a face, and oilers to kiss him, hut
instead slaps him in the face. The crowd then
shouts, and the curtain falls. At this the
reporter retires.
MEETING OF THE SOUTHERN VOLUNTEER ASSOCIA
TION.—The Southern Volunteer Association met
last night in Saratoga Hall, corner of Saratoga
and Calvert streets. The attendance was not large,
and those present, with but few exceptions, were
young men, not out of their twenties, and some of
them in their teens. A few of them wore cockades,
of various colors, some on the hat and some on the
coat. When the hour arrived to call the meeting
to order, the President was not present, and a de
lay of half an hour took place, when finally a young
man named M. E. Price, stepped on the platform
and called for order. The accommodations for the
President and Secretary were limited in the ex
treme. The platform was small and a large piano
occupied it principally. On the wall in the rear
was a flag bearing the colonial arms of Maryland.
" he figure is a shield, with a man on the right car
rying a fish, and one on the left with a spade in his
hand. An eagle with outstretched wings stands
upon the top of the shield, and the whole rests on
a scroll, which bears the words, "Crescite et multi
plicamini." This flag was stnbtched over the
"Stars and Stripes," the corners of which were ex
posed, and above the colonial colors was a litho
graphic portrait of Washington.
The assemblage was called to order, and the min
utes of the last meeting read and approved. The
President called for the report of the committe on
permanent organization. Radney R. Brooks, as
Chairman, stated that the committee was not ready
to report and asked for further time, which was
granted. Dr. Nickerson moved that the Committee
on Organization be empowered to draft a constitu
tion. When this was put there was quite a number
of "yeas and one "nah !" There were then cries
of "Marriott," "Brooks." Mr. Frank Brook moved
that a temporary Treasurer be appointed, and that
a Mr. Waters be selected. Dr. Nickerson moved
to refer the matter to the Committee on Organiza
tion; carried. The cries for "Brooks," and "Mar
riott," were repeated, when the former gentleman
took the platform and spoke for a few minutes in a
very weak tone of voice. He complained of fatigue
—of much labor, and closed by apologizing for the
small gathering. He also congratulated those pres
ent that there were no bullies present, hired to
break up the. meeting as there had been on a for
mer occasion. He hoped those present would not
lose any of their enthusiasm for the good cause,
but that they would go out among their friends and
bring them up to the work by thousands.
\\ hen Mr. Brooks took his seat there were cries
for "Marriott," and that gentleman stepped for
ward. He made a good speech, and glowingly pic
tured the wrongs which the South has suffered at
the hands of the North. Mr. Marriott was fre
quently interrupted by applause. At the close of
his remarks Mr. Brooks again stepped forward,
apparently more excited, and commenced a bar
rangue. His voice was immensely stronger than on
his previous effort. Maryland's son (meaning Mr.
Marriott) had fired his blood, and he must speak.
He said all the North wanted was an anti slavery
Bible, an anti slavery Constitution and an anti
slavery God. He continued for sometime, and was
followed by Mr. Price, who made a few remarks,
when the meeting adjourned until next Monday
night.
MILITARY.— The Putnam Phalanx of Hartford,
Conn., on their icay to Mount Vernon. —This after
noon at four o'clock, the Putnam Phalanx, the
principal military of the city of ilartford. Conn.,
will arrive in this city, en route for Mount Vernon,
to visit the tomb of Washington. The corps has
gained much military celebrity, and is composed
for the most part of the active business men of
Hartford, who have passed the meridian of life.
Their drill and discipline are said to be of the high
est character, and in all that appertains to strict
military deportment and gentlemanly bearing, they
enjoy an enviable reputation. The following is a
list of the officers:
Horace Goodwin, Major Commandant.
Gen. Lloyd E. Baldwin, acting Adjutant lor the
Excursion, by appointment of the Major Com
mandant.
Staff Officers.— Joseph 1). Williams, Adjutant;
Eugene B. Strong, Quartermaster; James B. Cros
by, Paymaster; Penning Mann, Commissary; Hen
ry C. Iteming, Assistant Commissary; I. W. Stew
art, Judge Advocate; Asher Moore, Chaplain-
Thomas Minor, Surgeon; D. P. Francis, Assistant
burgeon; William Isham, Sergeant Major; Charles
1. Martin, Quartermaster Sergeant; Julius M.
Sexton, Secretary.
Captains. —Allyn S. Stillman and Alexander M
Gordon.
The corps numbers over two hundred and fifty
men, but on this visit there will not be more than
one hundred and fifty muskets. On their arrival
here they will be received by the Baltimore City
Guard, under command of Maj. Joseph P. Warner,
attbe corner of Eastern Avenue and Broadway—a
salute will be fired upon their arrival at Canton, by
company A. Eagle Artillery. The route will he
then taken up as follows:—Along Broadway to
Laltimore street, along Baltimore to Calvert, thence
to the Cniversalist church; where the visitors will
be formally received by Mayor Brown. After the
ceremony of reception at the church, thev will be
escorted by the City Guard to the Gilmor House,
where they will dine, and remain until Wednesday
morning when they leave for Washington.
The church will be opened at 3 o'clock for the
admission of ladies; the galleries being reserved
for them exclusively.
THE BALTIMORE COUNTY NORMAL SCHOOL.—Yes
terday morning, the Baltimore county Normal
School convened in the Newton University Hall,
No. 7 Lexington street. At half-past 10 o'clock,
l'rof. A. F. Allen arose and entered into a lucid ex
planation of the objects of the school. No Institu
tion in the community was better worthy of the
confidence and support of society than the Public
Schools, and on their success and prosperity de
pended in a great degree the welfare and happiness
of the people. He then stated that it was not his
intention to instruct by giving lessons or lectures.
Ihe school was more a gathering of teachers for
the purpose of an interchange of views in regard
to the manner of teaching the several branches, and
of imparting their knowledge to the pupils. By
this, much good would be derived. The good points
in the different systems of instruction could be se
lected and combined together to form a more per
fect system. Much more importance than is usually
conceded should be attached to the elementary
branches cf education. Many teachers were able
to explain thoroughly any principle connected with
the science of Philosophy or Chemistry, yet they
were sadly deficient in a thorough knowledge of
the rudiments of Orthography and Etymology,
when, without this knowledge, no person is capable
of taking charge of a school. Prof. Allen treated
the subject with much ability. At night, Key. J.
F. McJilton delivered a lecture, taking for bis sub
ject the Common School System.
PROPERTY SALES.— Yesterday Col. Samuel H.
Gover, autioneer, sold at the Exchange Salesrooms,

VESSEL ON HlßE. —Yesterday morning abont five
o clock, the galley of the schooner Mary Eliza.
lying at Light street wharf, near Barre street, ac
cidentally caught fire from the careless use of
matches by one of tho crew. Officer Summers
being near, with the assistance of the crew and
some persons passing along the wharf, extinguiahed
the flames without causing an alarm.
TOM THUMB AND HIS TURN-OUT.— A few minutes
before 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon, quite an ex
citement existed along Baltimore street, between
Light street and the Maryland Institute, ntuong tlie
juvenile portion of the community. At that hour,
General Tom Thumb left the Fountain Hotel for
the Institute, in his coach drawn by lilliputian
ponies, and attended by two boys, apparently be
tween six and seven years of age, in livery. The
General was carried from the entrance of the hotel
and placed in the caniage, and the doors closed, so
that it was impossible to get a sight of him. On
arriving at the Institute, the crowd numbered
several hundred. The juveniles manifested fully as
much interest to get a sight of the General as"did
older persons to see Baron Renfrew.
CH,\ROE OR MUTlNT — Bearing Before the United
Estate* Commissioner. —The seamen who were arrest
ed on Friday by the United States Marshal, on
complaint of Capt. Swasy, of the ship Sylvia,
charging them with mutinous conduct on her voy
age from Glasgow to this port, had a hearing yes
terday before,U. S. Commissioner Haoan. The evi
dence was of such a character that the Commission
er deemed it necessary to have the case examined
by the Grfcd Jury of the United States District
Court, and accordingly committed to jail William
Harding, John Cross and James Miller, three of the
sailors, to await the action of that body. The wit
nesses for the United States gave bail for their ap
pearance.
TRIAL OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. —Yesterday af
ternoon, about four o'clock. Mayor Brown, accom
panied by the Board of Fire Commissioners and a
number of gentlemen, repaired to the corner of
Bond and Jefferson streets, where the Mayor gave
an alarm from box 25, and in less than eight min
utes three of the engines—Nos. 3, 4 and s—were on
the spot. No. 1, Paca street, was then called, and
she was on the ground in twelve minutes from the
time the signal was given. The engines went to
work and made some excellent throwing.
HARD UP. —We regret to learn that a number of
officers of the Navy and others were unable yester
day to get the pay due them by the Government,
the Treasury Department, for some reason or other,
having failed to furnish the Agent here with the
means of meeting the demands upon him. .
ACTION OF TUB CORN AND FLOUR EX
CHANGE ASSOCIATION ON THE DEATH OF
JOEL TICKERS, ESQ.
At a meeting of the members of the Corn and
Flour Exchange this morning, tl. M. Warfield'
Esq., President, in the Chair, J. M. Parr, Esq.,
appointed Secretary, the President announced the
decease of their late venerable and highly esteemed
member, Joel Yickers, Esq.
r * Warfield in a feeling manner said it was
again his painful duty to announce to the Associa
tion that another of their most worthy and valued
members had been taken from them by death.
The venerable Joel Yickers, at the advanced age
of eighty-seven years, had departed this life. For
halt a century he had been known to our commu
nity as a merchant of great respectability, un
swerving integrity and irreproachable character,
and it was proper that some suitable action should
be taken of the sad event by the Association, of
which he was a valued member from its organiza
tion.
Wm. Crichton, Esq., rose and said he cordially
endorsed the sentiments of the President. The
venerable Capt. Vickers had departed, and thus
another of the link that bound us to the past, had
been severed. The name of Capt. Joel Vickers was
a household word in our city for all that consti
tutes the upright merchant. His many virtues
Avore best known to those who enjoyed his acquain
tance. His charities were of that character that
permitted not "the left hand to know what the
right doeth." May his example not be lost upon
us. in his ripe old age he has been gathered to
his grave, and it only remains for us to express the
loss which we have sustained, and bear testimony
by our action hero to-day, of the appreciation in
which the memory of his many virtues is enter
tained by this Association.
Mr. Crichton moved that a Committee of three
be appointed by the Chair to draft resolutions ex
pressive of our loss on the death of Mr. Vickers,
that the same be entered on the minutes of the As
sociation, and a copy forwarded to the family of
the deceased.
I. M. Parr, Esq., seconded the resolutionin some
very feeling remarks, and moved that the Associa
tion meet at their rooms at half-past two o'clock
this afternoon, and attend the funeral of the de
ceased in a body, the resolutions were unanimous
ly adopted. The Chair appointed Messrs. Wru.
Crichton, Jas. E. Tyson, I.M. Parr, and dames
VV arden, a Committee to draft the resolutions.
At the appointed hour, a large number of the
members of the Association met in the saloon of
the Exchange, and proceeded to the late residence
ol the deceased, from whence they accompanied the
remains to their last resting place in Greenmount.
LA W INTELLIGENCE.
CRIMINAL COURT—JUDGE BOND.
The case of Stephen Jury, indicted for the mur
der of m. J. Smith, mate of the schooner John
Cooper, on the night of the 12th of October, 1859,
was fixed for trial yesterday. After the call of the
witnesses, Mr. Whitney stated to the Court that
two witnesses who were before the Grand Jnry,
and whose names were on the back of the indict
ment, were returned won est. He would on that
account like the case postponed for a day or two to
enable the State to get these witnesses. He under
stood that the counsel for defence desired to trv
the indictment before the Court, and therefore it
would be unnecessary to keep the jurv. Moses

Chesnut, Clay, Gwin. Hammond, Harlan, I vers on,
Johnson, oT Arkansas, Mallory, Johnson, of Tonnes
see.Pugh, Sebastian, Slidell, Ten Eyck, Thompson,
Toombs and Wilkinson. The galleries were well
filled.—After prayerby the Chaplain, Mr. BRIGHT
moved an order that the Secretary inform the
House that a quorum of the Senate were assembled
and ready to proceed to business. Adopted. On
motion of Mr. BIGLER it was resolved that a com
mittee of three of the Senate, and such as may be
appointed by the House, wait on the President of
the United States and inform him that a quorum of
each House were ready to receive any communica
tion he may he pleased to make. -The PRESI
DENT appointed as such committee Messrs. Big
ler, Mason and Collnmer. Mr. FITZPATRICK
moved an order that the hour for the daily meeting
of the Senate be 12 o'clock until otherwise ordered.
Adopted. A message was received from the
House concurring in the Senate's resolution, and
appointing a committee to wait on the President.
Mr. CLINGMAN moved to take a recess for
half an hour. Mr. TRUMBULL said he was in
formed that they should not get the Message to
day. The Senate then, at ten minutes past 1
o'clock, adjourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
The House was called to order at noon and about
two hundred members responded to their names.
Mr. McKENTY, of Pennsylvania, appeared in
the place of Mr. Sehwartze, deceased. Mesprs.
BARRETT, of Missouri, and JOHN Y'OUNG
BROWN, of Kentucky, severally appeared and
qualified. A message was received from the
[Senate announcing the appointment of Messrs.

consider the vote by which the Homestead hill, re
| ported from the Committee on Agriculture, was
referred to the Committee of the Whole on the
State of the Union, and he moved the pre
vious question. Mr. PHELPS said that
the gentleman from Pennsylvania could call
up the motion any other day, and it should
not now be insisted on as several members were
absent. Mr. GROW explained that his reason
for calling up the motion now was that they might
have business before the House, for gentlemen knew
that there were special orders for the first three or
four weeks this session. Mr. GROW yielded to
a suggestion to postpone the motion for the present,
in order that members might proceed to draw for
their seats. On motion of Mr. FLORENCE, the

from the vacancies which may occur, which will be
filled by him. Mr. Washburn was then excused.

said, to allow an opportunity for that puipose?
Mr. WASHBURN, of Illinois, said he understood
that the President's Message would not come in till
to morrow, and he moved to adjourn, which was
carried, and at half past one o'clock the House ad
journed.
LETTER FROM MR. WHITEFIELD ON THE
SUBJECT OF SLAVE LABOR.
The following letter is a verbatim copy of one
written by the Rev. George Wbitefield, the famous
preacher, and printed in the London edition (1771)
of his collected works:
BRISTOL, March 22, 1751.
Reverend and very Dear Sir .*
I lately received your last kind letter, and am
glad to find that you are enabled to joy in tribula
tion, and to say, "Father, not my will, but Thine
be done." May the Lord increase your faith, and
it you should be called to give up your Isaac, your
dear yoke-fellow, may you, Aaron-like, hold your
peace, and, by an undissembled resignation to the
divine will, glorify your God! My wife has been in
pitiable circumstances for some time. The Lord
only knows what will be the issue of them. This is
my comfort, "all things work together for good to
those that love God." He is the Father of mercies,
and the God of all consolation. He can bring light
out of darkness, and cause the barren wilderness to
smile. This I trust will be verifiad in Georgia.
Thanks he to God, that the time for favoring that
colony seems to be come. I think now is the season
for. us to exert our utmost for the good, of the poor
Ethiopians.
We are told that even they are soon to stretch
out their hands unto God. And who knows but
their being settled in Georgia may be over-ruled
for this great end? As for the lawfulness of keep
ing slaves I have no doubt, since I hear of some that
were bought with Abraham's money, and some that
were born in his house, and I cannot help thinking
that some of those servants mentioned by the Apos
tles in their epistles were or had been slaves. It is
plain that the Gibeonites were doomed to perpetual
slavery, and though liberty is a sweet thing to such
as are born free, yet to those who never knew the
sweets of it, slavery perhaps may not be so irk
some. However this be, it is plain to a demonstra
tion that hot countries cannot be cultivated with
out negroes. What a flourishing country might
Georgia have been had (be use of them been per
mitted years ago. How many white people have
been destroyed for want of them, and how many
thousands ot pounds spent to no purpose at all!
Plad Mr. Henry been in America, 1 believe he
would have seen the lawfulness and necessity of
having negroes there. And though it is true that
they are brought in a wrong way from their own
country, and it is a trade not to be approved of,
vet as it will be carried on whether we will or not,
I should think myself highly favored if I could pur
chase a good number of them, in order to make
their lives comfortable, and lay a foundation for
breeding up their posterity in the nurture and ad
monition of the Lord. You know, dear sir, that I
had no hand in bringing them into Georgia, though
m . v judgment was for it and so much money was
yearly spent to no purpose, and 1 was strongly im
portuned thereto, yet I would not have a negro
upon my plantation till the use of them was pub
licly allowed in the colony. Now this is done, dear
sir, let us reason no more about it, but diligently
improve the present opportunity for their instruc
tion.
The trustees favor it, and we may never have a
like prospect. It rejoiced my soul 'to hear that one
of my poor negroes in Carolina was made a brother
in Christ, llow know we but we may have many
such instances in Georgia ere it be long ? By mix
ing with your people, 1 trust many of them will be
brought to Jesus, and this consideration, as to us,
swallows up all temporal inconveniences what
soever. Thus, my dear sir, I have opened my mind
to you on this head; if it satisfies you, I shall be
glad; though I suppose what holy Mr. Z n has
already written has been sufficient. Hit heart seem*
touched with a sympathy for these poor creatures, and
in the fall, God willing, I intend seeing what can
be done towards laying a foundation. Lord, pros
per this work of our hands upon us; prosper thou,
O God, our handy work I 1 am now entering upon'
my spring campaign, and long for the time to em
bark for Georgia. This I believe will shortly
come. BlesSed be God, the work on this side in
creases daily. You will help me with your prayers,
aud you will remember me in the kindest manner
to your colleague, your wife and dear congrega
tion, and beli-v© me to be, reverened sir, vour
most unwortf >, but affectionate brother and fellow
laborer in the kingdom of our Lord, G. W.
I From the National Intelligencer. December 3 ]
The Ke-opknixo op Congress.—There-assembling
ol Congress, appointed for this day, occurs at a
time which gives to its deliberations a solemn in
terest that has not been exceeded at any former
period in our civil history. The eves or the whole
nation will naturally be directed with intense anx
iety to the proceedings which shall mark its earlier
sessions,and the prayers of patriotic hearts through
out the land will invoke for its members a spirit of
wisdom and conciliation. At every period ol simi
lar doubt and perplexity in our annals there have
been statesmen who,rising above the spirit of party,
and extricating themselves from the passions ofthe'
hour, have been able, with calm intelligence, to
point away ot escape from the perils which threat
ened our civil existence. Can it be that the spirit
of counsel and moderation has so far departed from
the public men of the present day that no pi j of
accommodation can be concerted for the pacifica
tion of existing dissensions ? Are the difficulties
which beset a pacific adjustment of our present dis
contents greater than those which have been sur
mounted by the sages and patriots of our
Government at successive periods in its history?
Are they greater than those which were encoun
tered by the men who framed the Articles of Con
federation, or by those who brought symmetry and
beauty out of civil dissolution in 1789, or by those
whe repressed sectional animosities, and at the
same time prosecuted a successful war against the
first Power of the world in 1812, or bv those who
stayed the hand of civil war in 1832, or by those
who composed the agitations of 1850 in a pact of
compromise which rallied to its adhesion the sup
port of the people in all sections? We think not;
and so believing, we should be loth to do so much
discredit to the wisdom and patriotism of our
contemporary statesmen as to doubt that they
will prove equal to the emergencies of the present
crisis.
Let there be, above all things, no words of crim
ination or recrimination uttered on tbe floor of
CoDgrass. The time calls for calm and sober re
flection, not for the language of bot debate. Let
the Representatives of all parties and ol all sec
tions blend their counsels and their labors in a
hearty and earnest effort, which shall look to tbe
restoration of peRCe, order and fraternity on an
enduring bc.sis. Upon those who shall be first in
this labor ot love tbe whole country would delight
to bestow its choicest honors, while the pen of his
tory would record their names lor the admiration
and homage of unnumbered generations, not only
among our own posterity, but among the patrons
of civil liberty throughout the world and to the
remotest ages.
Billy Mulligan, the notorious New York bruiser,
has been sentenced to tbe State prison for four
years and six months, for a felonious assault on an
officer.

MILLEDOEVILLE, Dec. 3.—On motion of Mr. Holt,
of Muscogee, a preamble and resolutions, submitted
by him, were made tbe special order for Tuesday,
proposing a Conference of all the Southern States
at Atlanta, on tbe 20th of February, to counsel and
advise as to the mode and manner of resistance to
be adopted under tbe existing exigency. The pre
amble takes strong grounds in favor ot having all
sectional questions finally settled, and objects to
separate State action.
THE GEORGIA RETALIATORY BILL.
MILLKDGEVILLE, Dec. I.— Mr. Sprayberry, of Ca
toosa, moved to amend the retaliatory bili, as fol
lows; "And whereas, a compact broken by one
party is no longer binding, politically, socially,
legally or morally, upon tbe other parties to it; and
whereas, in the opinion of the General Assembly,
the States enumerated in this bill have grossly
violated the compact of tbe Union, by refusing to
deliver up fugitives; be it enacted that the State of
Georgia withdraws its confederated faith
troin all States which interpose obstacles
to the recovery of our rights under the
Constitution; and be it hereby further enacted
and decreed, that all officers of this State, civil and
military, who have taken an oath to support the
Constitution of the United States, are hereby re
lie ed and absolved from the obligations of such
oaths, in all cases, in the limits of this State, where
the States, or citizens of those States, who refuse
our constitutional rights are parties, or are other
wise concerned."
This amendment was lost—ayes, 36; nays, 89.
The retaliatory bill, however, passed the House.
SECESSION MEETING AT MOBILE.
MOBILE, Dec. I.—A large and enthusiastic seces
sion meeting was held to night, at which delegates
were nominated to the State Convention.
GOVERNOR HOUSTON DECLINES TO CONVENE THE TEXAS
LEGISLATURE.
NEW ORLEANS, Dec. I. — A committee of citizens
of Texas petitioned Governor Houston to convene
the Legislature. The Governor responded that
viewing the proposed measure a? unwise he couldn't
call the Legislature, but if a majority of tbe citi
zens of the State petitioned for it, he couldn't stand
in tbe way. The secession feeling strongly pre
dominates.
ENTHUSIASM IN CHARLESTON.
CHARLESTON, Dec. 1. —A tremendous open air
gathering was held in front of the Charleston Ito
tel to-night.
Col. Bilbo, of Tennessee, made an encouraging
speech, and said that Tennessee would secede with
in thirty days after South Carolina.
Speeches were also made by Messrs 11. J. Whale,
Smith, Prirtgle, Gourdon and others.
Mr. Richardson alluded to the rumored attempt
to garrison the harbor forts. He said he did not
advocate taking tliem immediately unless troops
come to occupy them; but if these forts were man
ned, they would be stronger than the Malakoffand
Uedan.
THE LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
COLUMBIA, Dec. X. —The proceedings of the Le
gislature to-day were confined principally to mat
ters of local interest.
The bill to provide a military force was post
poned till Monday. It will certainly pass next
wee k.
A resolution was introduced declaring that it is
inexpedient to fill tbe vacancies in the United States
Senate from South Carolina. It will be adopted
on Monday next.
The Legislature is preparing a large number of
bills in relation to free negroes, itinerant salesmen
and travelling agents.
The police regulations of the State will be made
more stringent, and effective measures are being
perfected for tbe purpose of putting the coast in a
state of defence. In every way preparation is
going forward in order to be fully prepared to back
the Convention which shall declare the State out
of the Union.
A Governor will be elected next week, perhaps
on Wednesday. Among the names mentioned in
connexion with this office is that of Hon. F. W.
Pickens. He addressed the Legislature last night
in the House hall. He declared for immediate ac
tion, and made a strong argument in favor of the
position assumed by Lne State, lie said the recent
speech of Hon. A. H. Stephens was calculated to
mislead, and declared that secession could be exer
cised only by each State separately. If South
Carolina went out the other cotton States would
follow.
NORTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE.
On Tuesday, Nov. 28, in the North Carolina Sen
ate, Mr. Thomas, of Davidson,introduced the follow
ing resolution :
Resloyed,That the Committee on Finance be and they are
hereby instructed to inquire into the expediency of levy
ing a high tax on all goods, wares and merchandise,
brought into tliig State from any Northern which
have passed the Personal Liberty Laws, and thereby nul
lifying the Fugitive Slave law, and that they report by
bill or otherwise.
Mr. Thomas said that he would take this oppor
tunity of stating his opinions on the distraction
situation of the country. He said that he had com
ferred with the most intelligent men of his section,
and that he would with them stand firm in the Un
ion—that the passage of this resolution would
touch the North in the right place. He entertained
the hope and belief that this glorious Union would
yet be preserved.
In the House of Commons, on the same day, Mr.
Mebane introduced the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Committee on Finance be and they
are hereby instructed to inquire into the expediency of
imposing a high rate of taxation upon ail goods, wares
and merchandise brought inro this State from anyofthe
Northern States whicli have nullified the Fugitive Slave
Law, or in any manner obstructed the regular execution
thereof, and that they report by bill or otherwise.
Mr. Gaither offered the following resolution on
Federal afl'airs:
Resolved, by this General Assembly, that North Caro
lina is ready at all times to pledge every dollar of her
treasure and the blood of her sons for the maintenance
and defence of her rights, from whatever quarter they
may be invaded.
Resolved, That there does not exist, at this time, any
sufficient cause for a dissolution of this Union, and that
we will listen to no counsel and countenance no measure
that tends to the dismemberment of this great republic.
Mr. Wilkerson introduced the following:
Whereat, It is important that North Carolina take some
position upon the great questions that are disturbing the
country; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we regard the election of Abraham Lin
coln by purely a sectional party, as a very-great calamity,
though not sufficient cause in itself for the dissolution of
the UnioD. 2d, That the true policy of the State is to pre
pare for the worst, and quietly await the inauguration
and the policy set forth in his inaugural 3d, That after
taking the oath to support the Constitution, he shall
pledge himself to carry out the principles of that sacred
instrument in pooil faith, to enforce the Fugitive Slave
law, and to abstain from interfering with slavery either
in the States or within the jurisdiction of the United
States, we are for the Union. 4th, If he shall indicate a
course of policy in violation of the Constitution and hos
tile to the interests of the South, then we are for resist
ance to the very last extremity.
CONSULTATION AMONG THE SOUTHERN MEMBERS OF CON
ORESS—THE MEETING OF THE UNION MEMBERS POST
PONED.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—There is a consultation in
progress among the members of several of the Con
gressional delegations from the Southern States
to-night. Their object seems to be to secure the
co-operation of the border States in the secession
movement.
The Treasury Department to-day was enabled to
pay only about 25 per cent, on the mileage due
Congressmen.
The projected meeting of the Union members of
the House and Senate, which was to have taken
place to night, has been indefinitely postponed at
the request of Hon. Mr. Crittenden.
WHAT THE WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENTS SAY.
[Correspondence of the N. 1". Herald ]
A number of prominent, non-political, influen
tial Southern planters and merchants of the high
est respectability arrived here on Saturday mors
•nß> in [accordance with a previous arrangement
among themselves, and, I am informed, called up
on the President; after which a private caucus
meeting was held in the parlors of the Union Club
House, on Thirteenth street, where an address was
prepared warmly endorsing the President. This
address is to be printed in the form of a petition
and sent to friends in all of the Southern States,
after which they are to be sent to their respective
representatives in Congress here, who will be urged
to sustain Mr. Buchanan and the Union. These
gentlemen, who appear to be quiet, unassuming,
thoughtful men, I am told represent slave proper
ty to the amount of $4,000,000, which, while in the
Union, they believe to be comparatively safe, while
out ot the Union they contend there is no safety.
The majority of them left here for their home 3 last
evening, and hope to return in a few days with
unmistakable evidence of the predominance of the
conservative and Union sentiment of the South.—
This mnch I am permitted to communicate to the
Herald, whose coarse as the great pacificator was
never more fully acknowledged and appreciated
than at the present trying time.
The South Carolina delegation are all here. They
have not determined whether they will take their
seats. They are conferring with the representatives
of the cotton States upon the propriety of such a
step. They will not decide before to morrow morn
ing.
The South Carolina delegation would prefer that
none of the representatives of the cotton States
take their seats in either House. They fearsome
reasonable compromise may be attempted, which is
just what they do not want. They do not wish to
secede alone.
_ [Correspondence of the World.]
The city has to-day been the scene of unusual
excitement in consequence of the meeting of Con
gress. Most of the Southern delegations.including
South Carolina, are here, uiost of whom agree that
the secession of from one to three states is inevita
ble. Porcher Miles and Keitt openly proclaim that
South Carolina will secede, no matter what may be
the tenor of the message, or what propositions may
be made by Congress. Men of conservative pro
clivities, like Hardruan, of Georgia, state that se
cession is certain.
A large number of Republicans met in caucus to
night, to consider Thurlow Weed's proposition,
made in the Albany Journal. A vote was taken,
after a brief consultation, and a majority of the
Republicans voted affirmatively.
Mr. Boyce, of South Carolina, says he declined
being a candidate for the Convention, because be
thought it best that their delegation should come
to Congress with others, and there declare the sev
erance of that State from the Union.
The friends of Mr. Seward state that he will soon
make a speech in the Senate of a pacificatory tend
ency, and proposing terms which must meet the
views of all parties.
Mr. Breckinridge is not in favor of immediate se
cession, but for general co operation of the South
ern States in demanding their rights, and certain
conditions, which, if refused, would be followed by
secession, which he will then uphold. The extrem
ists do not agree with him.
[ From the Washington Star, of last evening.]
SOMEWHAT AMAZED.
1 he Republican Members and Senators were evi
dently unprepared for the state of things they find
existing at the South. Not on in ten of theui had
the least idea of it ere reaching here on Friday or
Saturday last. The almost entire unanimity of the
whole South in Congress in demanding new consti
tutional guarantees as the only alternative of dis
union, which is the mildest position held by any
portion of them, has really astounded the Republi
can party of the body. Ais yet we see nothing to
induce the impression that' they will meet that
proposition of the border slaveholding-State Repre
sentatives promptly and frankly, as it must be met
to make it possible to prevent other States from
following immediately in the wake of South Caro
lin?i. Nevertheless, we by no means despair of
such a consummation within a fortnight from to-
for few of^them —the Republicans of Congress
fail to appreciate the tact that disunion is griev
ously to affect the interests of their constituents.
APPROACHING SECTIONAL CONFERENCES.
Three or four or more plans to cure the evils of
the times will doubtless be initiated in both Honse
and Senate in a day or two, by individual members
of both Houses of Congress, without concert of
action. In a day or two afterwards Conferences
will bring about the necessary concert of action.
The first will be between all the members and Sena
tors from the South, if they can be brought to
gether; and then will follow similar Conferences
between parties authorized to act and speak for
them, and the portion of the Republican party
professing conservative proclivities, out of which
it is to be hoped that something favorable to the
continuance of the Union may grow. But, at
present, we are constrained to sav the future looks
dark and gloomy indeed, so far as reliance on Con
gressional action to initiate a settlement of the
troubles i 3 concerned.
CO-OPER.ITION OF THE SOUTHERN STATES.
The members from the cotton States do not gen
erally seem to relish the idea of permitting the
States that are expected to be immediately injured
by the ascendancy of irrepressible confiictism in
the Government, to share in their counsels and
influence their action in the premises. Those rep
resenting the latter States, on the other hand, seem
to be almost unanimous in demanding unanimity of
action on the part of the South. We have so far
found but one of them disposed to surrender the
interests of the border slave States in the crisis,
into the keeping of South Carolina, by justifying
her so evident purpose of compelling the whole
South to follow her example, by leaving them no
alternative but to do so, while ' faintly profession
that she is acting but for herself.
THEIR DETERMINATION.
The Republican members of both Houses of Con
gress have already tacitly agreed to remain for the
present as still as death upon the slavery question.
Even Messrs. Sumner and Lovejoy have determined
to join in that policy. Its effect will be to increase
rather than decrease the distrust felt throughout
the South, concerning the tendency of the policy
of Lincoln's administration. It will not, as de
signed, generate the belief there that they are less
determined to wage the irrepressible conflict, than
ere Lincoln's triumph at the polls.
THE TONE OP MEMBERS FROM THE COTTON STATES.
It is clear to us that nearly all the Democratic
representatives from the cotton States seem bent
upon precipitating events as fast as possible, appar
ently dreading lest a pause in the action of South
Carolina may defeat the purpose of the secession of
the cotton States on or before the 4tli of March.
We have conversed with few of them who do not
intimate in effect that they regard the election of
Lincoln as being but the opportunitv long desired,
rather than the cause why they desire the dissolu
tion of the Union.
CONGRESS RRON SECESSION.
We have devoted much of the two past days to
the labor of ascertaining the sentiment and views
of the members of Congress of all parties upon the
current political state of tfie country, and confess
frankly that; as yet, there seems to be little hope
of that moderation of counsel necessary to aid in
delaying action on the part of the cotton-producing
States, until reason may again resume its place in
their councils that passion lias so manifestly'
usurped.
THE PROBABLE POSITION OP THE BORDER SLAVE-STATE
REPRESENTATIVES.
It is evident to us that those who represent the
border slave holding States (in Congress) will
promptly demand that their constituents shall be
properly heard in the emergency, and that the first
struggle in the Ilalls of Congress is to be between
them and the Representatives of the cotton-pro
ducing States.
Great quantifies of arms have been ordered in
tlie North by parties in the South. In many of the
States the authorities are placing all the important
points on a war footing. In alt of the armories
there is work enough for a vear. So great is the
demand beyond the capacity of labor, that South
ern agents report it impossible to have all their or
ders filled.
Much solicitude is felt as to the next advices
from Europe by capitalists and politicians. If the
drafts of our merchants are thrown out, and hold
ers of American securities should take the alarm,
and propose to sell at a sacrifice, there will be a
double calamity. We shall get very little specie,
and be compelled to pay out large amounts to for
eign bondholders.
There is no truth in the report which has been so
industriously circulated, that Judge Black is to be
nominated for the existing vacancy in the Supreme
Court. It is understood by his friends, who ought
to be best informed, that he proposes establishing
himself permanently in Washington after the fourth
of March, for practice in the Supreme Court and
the Court of Claims.
Mr. Caleb Cushing may be nominated for the
vacant seat of Judge Daniel, and if he should be,
he may be hung up for reflection, as was dono in
thecaseof Mr. Crittenden, under the Administra
tion of Mr. Adams, and of Mr. Badger, under that
of Mr. Fillmore.
THE POSITION OF THE GOVERNOR ELECT OF PENNSYL
VANIA.
In Philadelphia, on Saturday evening last, a din
ner was given in honor of Col. A. K. McClure,
chairman of the Republican State Committee. Nu
merous speeches were made,and one by Mr. C'urtin,
the Governor elect. In the course of his remarks,
he said :
The law-making power of this State has never
designedly placed upon our statute book laws to
contravene or obstruct the execution of any act of
the Federal Government; but if there bo any sta
tutes on our book which, in effect, do contravene,
or conflict with any legislation of the National Gov
ernment, or obstruct the execution of any law of
the United States, upon being fully satisfied that
such is the fact, let us repeal it. [Earnest and pro
longed cheering.] Let us show to the South and
the North, and all the world, that while Pennsyl
vania vindicates her own interests and rights, she
is faithful to the Union; and that the right of no
State or man in the nation shall ever be interfered
with, restricted or limited by any act of the people
of Pennsylvania.
SERENAPE TO SENATOR DOUGLAS—SPEECH ON THE
CRISIS.
The Douglas and Johnson Association, and other
citizens, numbering some two thousand, waited on
Judge Douglas at Washington, Saturday evening,
accompanied by the Marine Band of the Associa
tion, and complimented him with a serenade.
Judge Douglas was welcomed back to Washing
ton in a few felicitous remarks by Mr. John F.
Ennis, President of the Association, after which
the Senator was introduced and received with
tumultuous applause.
In the course of his remarks Judge Douglas said,
that to be thus welcomed by those who knew him
so well, inspired him with new energies in his pub
lic efforts. He referred with pride to the fact that
during the past canvass he had been able to avow
his sentiments in all parts of the country, in the
North, South, East and West. From Bangor to
Missouri he had advocated the principles of equal
rights, equal justice, and equal protection to all
citizens. He believed the perpetuity of the Repub
lic depended upon the triumph of the principle of
non-intervention. He said the Federal Government
had no power to interfere with slavery anywhere,
except in causing the return of fugitive slaves
agreeably to the law and Constitution. He held
the Fugitive .Slave law to be binding upon all good
citizens; and if it had been carried out in good
faith the Republic would not now be in peril and
danger.
Referring to Hon. A. H. Stephens' late speech,
Judge D. said he endorsed every sentiment it con
tained, and it inspired him with'the hope that there
was a party yet strong enough to save the country.
He accepted the Georgia platform in all its features.
The Personal Liberty bills should never have been
upon the statute books of any State. He believed
Congress had power to remove all obstructions to
the Fugitive Slave law, whether resulting from
State or any other legislation. Judge 1). remarked
he had said nothing during the canvass that did
not meet the approval of his conscience. He urged
all Union men, all constitutional loving men," to
sink their bickerings and unite to save the country
first, and quarrel, if they pleased, afterwards. Mr.
Lincoln having been elected according to the Con
stitution, he must be inaugurated according to that
Constitution. What is there to fear? Congress
will be against him. If he violates his oath,
violates the Constitution, or makes war upon
the rights of any section or anybody, he can be
impeached, for the Senate still enjoys the con
fidence of the country. He again exhorted his
friends not to indulge in recrimination; to let by
gones be bygones, and to unite for the preservation
of the Union. He concluded bv saying that on
Monday he should resume his seat in the Senate,
without prejudice or ill-feeliDg towards any one
except the foes of his country. Judge Douglas was
repeatedly cheered enthusiasticly. He was follow
ed by Hon. John Young Brown, of Kentucky, in
an eloquent Union speech.
The band then proceeded to the residences of
other gentlemen. A number of speeches were
made, and the affair was kept up until a late hour.
This was the most lively Union demonstration that
has occurred in Washington for a long time.
LETTER FROM A VIRGINIA OLD LINE WHIG.
The Richmond Enquirer of yesterday, publishes
a letter from an Old Line Whig, Robert E. Scott,
Esq., of I auquier county, on the questions now agi
tating the country. We make the following ex
tracts :
Under present circumstances, separate action
evinces discordant counsels, and leads to the suspi
cion of an attempt to coerce others into acts of re
volution that ought to proceed only from common
interests, common purposes and accordant counsels,
and is but too well calculated to engender antagon
isms from which evil cot sequences are likely
to flow.
For myself, I am unalterably opposed to that se
cession which would leave a diminished number
?h , T ?kolding States exposed, defenceles--, to
the r ederal power; and I am equally opposed to
any form of secession which would leave the
present Federal Government installed at Wash
tugton. *. * * * *
The position of Maryland connects her,especially,
with the fate of Virginia, and I think we should
determine upon no ultimate action, without a con
ference with her people. Should that State unite
in the act of withdrawal, the resumption of her ju
risdiction over the District of Columbia would
oust the Government at Washington, and the ac
commodations in that citv would at once afford all
the conveniences for the Capital of the Southern
Confederacy. * * * * *
I can but think that a peaceful solution of ali
present difficulties is fairly within our reach, and I
may venture to express the hope that the Conven
tion of Virginia will address its efforts wisely to the
accomplishment of that end. individually, I think
the solution can and ought to be found in the Union,
there are terms of settlement compatible with the
eqnfl r 'Khts, the equal interests and the equal honor
of all the States; but whether these can be obtained
depends, unfortunately, not upon the action of Vir
ginia or any of the States, but upon the concur
rent action of all. It is the misfortune ot some, in
the heedless obstinacy of others, to be dragged into
the conditions of a common fate.
LETTER FROM JCDOE MAORATH.
To the Editors of the Charleston Courier :
GENTLEMEN: —I have been for several days absent
from the city, and have not seen the questions ad
dressed to those who have been nominated for the
Convention. The answers, however, which 1 have
seen, are so explicit, that they inform me sufficient
ly of the nature of these questions.
-n h l"'' l 1 be selected to sit in the Convention, I
will there vote in strict accordance with those sen
timents which I have enforced in all parts of the
State wlgtre I have addressed the people.
Immediate secession—complete and final separation
oj the State —no political alliance hereafter with ami
out slaveholding States.
In these cardinal principles can we find the onlv
safeguard for that "peace, safety and happiness,"
to secure which, in the language of the Constitution
of our State, free governments are instituted.

THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE ON THE REPEAL OF THE ANTI
FUGITIVE SLAVE LAWS.
The New York Tribune, of yesterday, in an arti
cle on the demand of the South to repeal the North
ern anti-Fugitive Slave laws, says:
"We are opposed to any such back-down. We
share Falstaff's repugnance to rendering even rea
sons on compulsion, and we have even more dislike
to making concessions under duress. If the South
desires any change in the laws of Northern States,
and will request the same in the spirit that sent
Mr. Hoar from Massachusetts to Charleston to test
in her own Courts and those of the Union such laws
of South Carolina as bear hardly on citizens of
Massachusetts, we shall be very glad to meet her in
that spirit, and have all laws, whether North or
South, that contravene justice and the Federal
Constitution, simultaneously repealed. We would
do whatever is right, but a little sooner and more
graciously in the absence of threats than in their
irritating presence.

MYSTERIOUS MILITARY ORGANIZATION AT NORFOLK.
NORFOLK, Dec. I.—A paper is being mysteriously
circulated here for some days for signatures. From
the source whence it is said to have originated, 1
have no doubt that something serious is contempla
ted. Those whose signatures are canvassed, are
chiefly young men who are skilled in military tac
tics, and are known to he thoroughly Southern in
feeling. 1 obtained a slight clue to the contents of
this document. Itis simply a pledge to bereadv,
at a moment's warning, to start for a given point-
Richmond, as I understand—and there join a force
of chosen men, who are to battle in the front ranks
in defence of Southern rights. It is supposed that
a similar movement is on foot in every part of the
State. It is surmised that this picked force will
visit Washington the dav of the inauguration. This
organization is distinct from the regular military
organization of theState.— Correspondence iV. York

THE KANSAS TROUBLES.
IMPORTANT NEWS FROM MISSOURI IN RELATION TO THE
OPERATIONS OF MONTGOMERY.
WARSAW, MO., Dec. 1, 1860.
A special messenger who arrived here to-night
brings tho following important intelligence from
the West. It is from a reliable source, anil there
fore full confidence can be placed in it :
CLINTON, Henry county, Dec. 1, iB6O.
That the public mind may net bo misinformed,
and misled by the many emissaries the abolitionists
are running to and fro through the country, east of
this place, as we are informed, and to justify those
who have the dark designs of the abolition marau
ders under the notorious Capt. Montgomery, in
Kansas and on the border, we beg leave to state
the following facts, in addition to those heretofore
given :
The armed abolitionists have continued their
murderous operations in Bourbon and Lynn coun
ties, Kansas, bunting down and driving from the
Territory all men who have disapproved of their
robbing and murdering, and who have acted in any
manner to sustain the laws.
The roads leading eastward from the Territory
have been crowded with wagons and persons, male
and female, escaping from these liends.
On Monday of this week a Mr. Bishop,who lives
on the Osage river, about twelve miles north of
Fort Scott, having been aroused by a noise in the
night, upon going to the door to see what was the
matter, was instantly shot down and killed. His
body was found to have been pLrced by several
balls.
We have seen here for the past few days wagons
loaded with goods, furniture, Ac., passing through,
not only from the territory, but (rom Westport,
in this State, and other places within the line.
Families living on and near the old Jackson
place, within this State, have been notified to leave
their homes, by these outlaws, and having no
means of defence, have fled to Butler and places in
the interior for security, leaving their homes and
effects behind them, unprotected. Yesterday, slaves
owned by those living on the line, some twenty-five
miles or more within the State, arrived here for
safe keeping.
Thus have the citizens of Dates and Vernon coun
ties, since the commencement of this insurrection,
been threatened with the destruction of life and
property, without adequate means of defence or
protection. Up to this time this state of things has
continued.
Capt. Doak, of Dutler, has arrived here, on his
way for arms, and ammunition, and aid, from whom
we have learned some of the above facts.
D.C.STONE, H. It. QCORLS,
W. A. DCNCAN, JOHN A. Room-:
R. K. MCRRELL, B. HALCOMB,
J. WILLIAMS, WM. H. DOAK
JOSEPH DAVIS, B. (1. BOONE,
J. M. COCLE, G. It. WORTH,
JosF.ru BOND.
Captain Doak states that the citizens of West
port, fearing an attack from Captain Montgomery
and his band of Jay-llawkers, held a meeting a few
days ago, and directed that a call be made on the
Sheriff of Bates county to raise a force for the pro
tection of the border.
Capt. Doak, who is Deputy Sheriff of Dates
county, upon this despatched forty muskets to the
citizens there, who stand upon guard every night
to prevent a surprise. This is also fhe case at Pop
pingsville and all the border towns.
A large meeting of the citizens of this county
(Henry county) was held to-day to take into con
sideration the border troubles. O. H. Worth was
chosen President and Joseph C. Alexander, Secre
tary.
Speeches were made by Colonel J. O. Davis, Col.
Tutt, Judge Williams, R. R. Murrell and a number
of others.
WARSAW, Dec. 2. —General Frost's brigade en
camped last night between Calhoun and lielmont.
They are moving slowly, having become foot-sore
from marchiDg on the rough roads.
Uen. Parsons passed through Calhoun yesterday
on a secret mission to the border.
At the last accounts Montgomery was encamped
near Fort Scott, and defied the world to take him.
It is thought that he will leave when he hears of
the approach of Gen. Harney and Gen. Frost.
The people in all the border counties strongly
endorse the action of Gov. Stewart in sending out
troops. If they can only catch Montgomery, a
general day of thanksgiving will be held in the 03-
age valley.
General Frost's command will encamp to night
at Calhoun. Two suspicious characters, supposed
to be Montgomery's spies, were seen[yestcrdav in
the northern part of Henry county, making tracks
in the direction of Fort Scott.
Montgomery's men are all through the country
giving out reports to mislead the people. These
frequent outrages in the West by abolition bands is
kindling in that section a strong disunion spirit.
FROM FORT SCOTT. —The Washington Star say 3
that the Interior Department yesterday morning
received a despatch from the Register of the Land
Ollice at Fort Scott, Kansas, dated November 25th
ultimo, saying that the business of the Land Ollice
there had not been interrupted, and was not likely
to be; and that much of the previous week's ex
citement had been without a reasonable cause.
A LADY IN COURT. —We observe that in the Eng
lish Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes, a
case lately on trial was argued and managed to
some extent by a lady. The case arose on a peti
tion (Shedden vs. Patrick,) for a declaration of
legitimacy, and was one which involved the honor
of the parents of the lady in question, who was
one of the petitioners. The cause came on too
early, as was alleged, for her counsel to make them
selves familiar with it,and as a postponement could
not be obtained, they withdrew from Court, and
the lady, Miss Shedden, being prepared a3 it would
seem for the emergency, proceeded at once to open
the case herself. Her address wa3 delivered in a
distinct tone and without hesitation, with clear
statement and correct diction. She observed at the
outset that it might be said that it wasa bold thing
for a woman to come into that Court and plead.—
"It was most painful to her, but it was her duty to
defend her father and her mother from the imputa
tions which had been cast upon them. It might
also be said that she was making a precedent for
ladies to plead their own causes; but this was an
unparalleled case, and she was sure that no one who
knew how painful was the position in which she
was placed would willingly follow her example."
It is worthy of note that having occupied two days,
the lady had not, at the date of our last advices,
concluded her opening address.
\Yno is JAS. S. BIUSBIN?—This question is an
swered by the Blairsville (Pa.) Record, as follows :
It will be seen below, that James S. Brisbin,
well known to many of our citizens, has written a
letter to Gov. Letcher, ol Virginia. Brisbin, when
here, was regarded as a conceited, vain, silly fel
low—and prided in the cognomen of the "Irish
Orator," —who went abont the country soliciting
persons to permit him to make addresses at school
examinations, &c. His addresses were fustian and
bombast. He pretended to be a Democrat in 185 S.
Had Gov. Letcher known his man, he would not
have deemed it necessary to make any reply to his
letter. It is very laughable to think of "Jim"
Brisbin commanding 200 Virginians. He has not the
courage and capacity to head n corporal' 3 guard of
little urchins, with paper caps and wooden swords,
in a raid upon a hen roost. Wo can confidently as
sure Gov. Letcher, that he represents the sentiments
of nobody in Pennsylvania, unless it be a few crazy
fanatics like himself. The people of Pennsylvania
are highly conservative, and warmlv attached to
the Union.
At an adjourned meeting of the cotton and wool
len dealers, held in Pittsburg on Saturday, a reso
lution was adopted recommending the running of
the mills upon half time for the present. It was
stated that over-production was as much the cause
of the present heavy stock on band as tfle influence
of politics.
PRICE TWO CENTS.
. the Presbyterian.]
A I REPOSITION FOR THE TIMES.
I Our fathers (irmly believed that God designed,
through us as a nation, to bless the world. The
ev. r. Robert Smith, of Pequea, Pennsylvania,
closes a sermon which he preached on Decembt
' ' i.i . appointed by Congress as a day of
general thanksgiving, with these words:
r raise him, all ye faithful confederate States,
iron Massachusetts to Georgia; for 'ye shall beat
into - into ploughshares, and your spears
the AlUnr 2 '! 10 "^ 1 ' , From North t0 rom
Amerioa • 1 * Western Ocean, let all North
you a Uree'anVt'f for he ia * bout to
basis of ifhorfi? r x " UB empire, founded upon the
o i iter* in 811 blessings
ot this life,and the richer blessings of the Gospel of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ! Ye shall im
port the merchandise of every nation, and export
your produce to every market. And with your
produce the enlarging privileges of the Gospel may
be transmitted to many nations that sit in dark
ness, to proclaim liberty to those captives, and the
opening of the prison doors to those who have been
long hound in chains of ignorance and error."
It will be seventy-nine years the second Thursday
of December next since the great and good man, in
he infancy of our nation, preached that sermon.
We have lived to see every word of it fulfilled.—
us not forget the past way by which we have
been led. The same Hand only can lead us safely
on. it we submit to his guidance, obey his com
mands, walk in his statutes, and seek to do that for
w inch he has designed us, no weapon formed against
us can prosper.
Is it not a proper time for us, as Christians, to re
view and consider the hand of God in our history ?
in another part ot Dr. Smith's sermon he says:
*' i ou have lonjj been addressed by the politicians
of the day as citizens; I now address you upon the
same topics as Christians and professors of the reli
gion of Jesus Christ. The cause of America is the
cause cf Christ; and as such 1 wish to interest you
more deeply in it, by drawing you to a more full
and religious improvement of his providences to us
as a nation, in this view, repentance and gratitude
are among the chief improvements required of us."
Who can doubt but that if we do earnestly, in
faith, so seek unto our God, he will blow away the
clouds which have gathered, and give ns calmness
and peace, with confidence in its stabilitv. Our
Fathers used constantly to pray that this land might
be "Immanuel's land—a mountain of holiness—a
dwelling-place of righteousness." Will we not con
tinue the prayer ?
UNSEEN LABOR. —"Caustic," the able corres
pondent of the London Weekly Dispatch, has the
following pithy paragraph in his letters :
" The unseen labor of London is worth a hundred
fold ol that which is seen. That unseen labor be
comes visible enough in its fruits, though those are
rarely traced to their origin. Mental labor feeds
London bodily. Take .away the earnings bv
tbo brain lrom this metropolis, and the
earners by the hand would soon see how much less
they may find to do. Two thirds of their bread
would be wanting to them. The brain-work helps
mightily to create the demand as well as to supply
the means. It was calculated that by merely
writing his novels, Walter Scott found employ
ment and pay for what would be a town of thirty
or forty thousand inhabitants; and those directly
benefited, the suppliers and tho professional depen
dent on the workers, were not, I believe, includ
ed. 1 take this as the most familiar instance.
Dickens, no doubt, contributes as much or more to
the public prosperity. Take a newspaper like tho
one whose editor I am addressing; its krain-work is
the life of hundreds of industrial families."
A WOMAN BURNED TO DEATH WHILE AT PRATER.
—1 he Lafayette (Indiana) Courier says: Airs.
Catharine Gray, a widow ladv, eighty years of
age, residing in the southern part of the town, was
burned to death last week under circumstances of
a peculiarly distressing character. On Thursday
evening she invited a little boy in the neighbor
hood to keep her company for the night, and after
tucking him warmly under the covers, kneeled down
at the bedside to say her prayers. While in that
position her dress took tire from the candle, and in
an instant she was enveloped in Haines. The fire
communicated to the curtains of the bed, and in
tent upon the preservation of the child and forget
ful of herself, she fought the flames until herhands
were burned to a blister, and succeeded in dragging
the little fellow into the middle of the room.—
The atlrighted boy broke from her embrace and
ran to tho nearest neighbors. The alarm was
promptly given, but before aid could be procured
the poor woman had been burned past recovery.
THE NEW ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH. —The following
interesting announcement appears' in Saunders's
New* Letter, an Irish paper:
Her Majesty's ship Bulldog arrived unexpectedly
in K illy begs harbor on Sunday afternoon, under
the command of Captain Sir Leopold McClintock,
having encountered very severe weather on her re
turn from the Arctic regions and North America.
We understand that the important work intrusted
by the government to the charge of our distingu
ished fellow-countryman has been carried out to
his entire satisfaction; and we may therefore hope
that when his report of the several soundings be
tween this country and America, via the Arctic
coast, has been laid before Parliament, the long
looked-for telegraph, by means of which the Old
and the New World will be united, will be a work
of mere mechanical nature. Sir Leopold McClin
tock will probably pass through Dublin on his way
to London.
"A NEW W AV RO I'AVOLO Duns."—The Natchez
( Miss. ) Free Trader proposes as a remedy for the
times, that every citizen owing money to Northern
people shall pay the same to the State Treasurer,
the Mate to issue her bond for the indebtedness,
payable when hostilities are over. Whereupon the
Courier remarks:—"lke idea ol more Mississippi
bonds is rather peculiar. She issued two sets and
repudiated them both; she was sued in her own
courts upon them, after she had invited suit, and
judgment rendered against her, and she has repu
diated payment of the judgments; and to crown the
whole, we understand, after she employed counsel
to defend these suits, she repudiated their counsel
fee* was sued upon that claim—judgments ob
tained and f hose judgments remain unpaid to this
hour.
A DBAO LETTER INCIDENT —The utility and accu
racy of the dead letter oflice was last week thus
strikingly illustrated: Assistant Postmaster Eve
ral Zevely, of the finance division, addressed a let
ter to Auditor Tate, ol the Treasury, stating that
dead letter 11, No. 15k. 3, written by Mrs. Adaline
IHobbs, addressed to Dr. Joshua T. Hobbs, New
l ork city, which appears by the record to contain
two ten dollar bank bills, was sent on the 28th No
vember, 182s, for delivery to the writer on the Gth
February, 182f>; the postmaster of New York not
beinjj able to find the writer, returned the letter
with its contents, to the dead letter ollice. After
a lapse ot thirty-one years, the letter is now claim
ed by the person addrcsed—l. T. Hobbs, Mount
Vernon, Ohio, and a draft for the money is accor
dingly remitted on the very day of the application.
PROPOSED KKUUCITON IN IIII: WARES OF OPERA
TIVES.—Some or the manufacturers of this city are
proposing a reduction of the wages of operatives
of from ten to twenty per cent, as was done in 1857,
and considerable feeling has been created in conse
quence. Should the proposition be carried out, it
is thought that a general strike would be the re
sult. At present prices, weavers of cheeks, ging
hams, Ac., cannot make more than $5 a week, and
many of them do not earn so much as that. Child
ren, employed as bobbin winders, do not, it is said,
earn more than from S2.SD to $3 a month. A re
duction oi twenty or of even ten per cent, to such
would be severely felt.— PA,7. Ledger.
THE "NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER." —In contradict
