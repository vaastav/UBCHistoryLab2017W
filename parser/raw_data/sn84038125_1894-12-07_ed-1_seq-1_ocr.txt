A VICTORY FOR DELLA
A VERY SATISFACTORY DECISION IN
THE HERSHFIELD CASE.
The Marriage of Della Hogan and Aaron
Htershfield Declared Legal by the Fargo
Court-The Fair Victor Given an Ova
tion-An Appeal Threatened.
FAino, N. D., Dec. 1.--The Ilershlfield
case is ended and the young bride of the
Montana millionaire has been declared
by a court of equity to be a legal wife.
Judge McConnell gave the decision,
denying the application of Aaron Hersh
field for the annulment of the marriage
contract immediately after the conclusion
of the arguments of the counsel. The
decision was given orally, the Court stat
ing that he did not care to point out that
the testimony was unworthy of credence.
The plaintiff's claIm, he said, that two
armed men forced him to accompany the
defendant to the office of a Justice of the
Peace, where they were married under
duress, must be substantiated so clearly
that there was little room for doubt, or it
must be shown that the plaintiff's mental
condition was such that he was incapable
of miuking a contract. The first position
he did not think was clearly sustained.
Ite believed Aaron I ershfield a changed
man, but not to the extent that he could
be held to be irresponsible. Ite had tak
en careful evidence; had followed each
witness closely and was confident he had
lost no ipoint that would ibe of benetfit to
the plaintiff, and saw no other way in
justice than to hold the marriage contract
valid and deny the decree.
The judge had warned the spectators
that there was to be no applause, and the
crowd respected the colmmand, but
when he said "I deny the decree," the
sigh of relief that went up swelled to
murmuris of applause. But outside tle
court, where nothing could prevent
the jubilation of the crowd, womten wit
had never seen the defendant until she
catme to Fargo, pressed forward to grasp
her hand before 1eavint the room.
"I am a happy womani again, for the
first time in a year," was all salhe could
say.
In the afternoon Mrs. L. 11. Hlershfield,
whto appeared in court for the lirst time,
was put on the stand for a few n moments,
denying parts of the conversation with
iMrs. Aaron Ilershtfield. ('losing argu
mients were made lrd then thie .udge de
livered Iris decision.

There has been a general oxodlus from

twenty trunks were carried to the depot

There is no doubt that the closing of the

discovery was made on the Monitor com

a shaft in the tunnel when they encoun
tered eight or ten inches of ore literally
covered with gold and which will run
thousands of dollars to the ton.
The letter concludes with: "Your cor
respondent has seen the ore and knows
that it is true, and that there is no exag

will also probably secure the Revenue
mill, which has been held for some time
by Butte parties, and resume the treat
ment of ore by cyanide process, this mill
being the first in the state to use this now
famous process of treating gold ores.
