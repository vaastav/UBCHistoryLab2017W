EDITORIAL COMMENT.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
The synopsis of the message of President Theodore Roosevelt to"
the sixtieth congress of the United States, now beginning its second
session, published on another page of this paper, is well worth the
attention of all our readers. We believe a synopsis better than
giving the message verbatim in this case, for in each section of the
message the president elaborates upon his theme, making a long
document. Theodore Roosevelt is perhaps the most versatile man
who has ever been in the presidential chair not, perhaps, that he is
our greatest president, for Washington, Grant; the beloved man of
sorrow, Abraham Lincoln; and our late revered McKinley, all rose to
great crises in a manner which has made the name of "American"
respected by all nations. Roosevelt has not been face to face with,
and through, any such crises as were these men, but his attention
has been turned more to economic and business conditions and de
velopment. And in handling the peace conditions of the country he
has shown a capacity for work, a quick understanding, and a gen
eral and correct knowledge of what was going on in all sections of
the nation and in all departments of his government which
has been at once the marvel and in some parts of congress, the
despair of that body. His messages are masterpieces and fearless.
In the present message, It is significant of the absolute honesty
and fairness of the man that while making broader recommenda
tions for the protection and welfare of the laboring man than any
prior president has ever done, he at the same time scores some of
labor's leaders for their attack upon the judiciary of the United
States and their attempt to legalize the blacklist, the boycott and
personal violence in the name of a "strike." In no uncertain words
he states that the great interstate corporations must be so super
vised that they observe both the letter and the spirit of the law, and
yet must be given opportunity to develop their various industries
to the greatest extent in a legal manner.
He states that the administration of justice must be prompt, and
sure, that the workingman may be on an equal footing with the
capitalist in the courts of law. And some of his most ringing sen
tences are to the effect that in sickness, in disability, or in old' age,
the man who has given himself, body and soul, to the government
service, or the service of the great corporations worn out or crip
pled himself .in that service shall be cared for by those to whom
he has devoted his best years and efforts. That is not politics, it is
not law, but it is right. It is Socialism which has been purified from
Socialism; Republicanism refined to troy weight, the utterance of a
man who feels for his fellow men.
The president's message also shows that he sees that the pros
perity of a nation is measured according to the development of
natural or acquired resources; that he sees that the natural re
sources of the United States are greater than those of any other na
tion of the world, that they must be developed, but at the same
time be developed in such a manner that they are perpetuated for
the benefit of generations yet unborn. And these resources, this
natural wealth, must be guarded so that no nation will ever try to
tresspass upon it. It is for this reason that he urges the construc
tion of a navy which can not only hold its own, but defeat the navy
of any other nation of the world, and an army which can equally
well protect its borders. It is for this reason that he believes the na
tional guard should be brought to the efficiency of the regular
army, practically a huge body of patriots trained in military man
euvors and discipline, fully armed and equipped, ready at practical
ly a moment's notice to take the field, armed, provisioned and train
ed for actual combat. All this is not for war, but for peace. The
banker does not leave his gold piled on his counters, but surrounds
it with intricacies of steel, electricity, and cunning mechanical de"
vices so that the would be thief is repelled, not attracted. Our
army and navy is but a gigantic safe, warding off calamity.
Roosevelts last letter all his letters show him not to be the
Roosevelt of the "big stick," hut the man of peace, but who, like a
skilled physician, applies the knife to business, political and civic
tumors, not in anger, but in sorrow; not In warfare, but that healing
and peace may be the ultimate result;, who applies precautlonary
measures rather than to try to cure after a plague has broken out.

MINING CAMP
Judge Ray Has Made a rive-Day Study of
me Camp and the Properties There and
says it is all to the GoodT.G. Murphy
Tells of Some New Strikes.
Judge L. O. Ray returned yester
day afternoon from Clifford, where
he spent five days in examining the
properties in the district. The judge
was greatly enthused over the show
ings of the Broken Hills Mining com
pany and stated that it was nearly
impossible to find words to describe
the mine properly.
"I had the privilege of going
through the property," said Mr. Ray
last evening, "and was astonished at
the huge ore bodies. Every where
they are working in the mine they
have ore. On the main ledge they
have sunk for a distance of thirty-
five feet in the ledge and are not
through it yet, so it is impossible to
determine the extent of the body.
The ledge is twenty-seven feet in
width and assays about $60 a ton.
There are veins of high grade In this
body that go up in the hundreds. It
is this that they are shipping.
"The hoist was unloaded there last
night and will be erected as soon as
possible and then sinking will re
sume on the ledge, which seems to
be getting richer with depth. This
mine has the promise of being one of
the greatest in the state. Yesterday
fifteen tons of high grade left the
camp for this city and there are fifty
tons waiting for ths wagons. The ore
teams are kept busy continually and
then they can not get the ore out of
the way, as men are at work sacking
the ore as fast as it is brought to the
surface.
"In the vicinity Tjf the Broken
Hills property there are ten leases
rushing the work as fast as possible
and every leaser is satisfied that he
will encounter the ledges with a
little depth. The Smith brothers'
lease struck a vein of ore at a depth
of 65 feet which gives excellent val
ues. On the Belmont lease they are
down ninety feet and expect to un
cover the ledge soon.
"There is still a great demand for
the town lots and many are sold
daily. A great number of the orders
are coming from outside points,
which shows that the district is at
tracting some attention."
NEW STRIKES REPORTED.
Thomas G. Murphy, who is inter
ested In the Helena townslte at Clif
ford, is in from that district and re
ports several new strikes by the
leasers there. On the lease of the
Broken Hills Consolidated company
a two-foot ledge has been found on
the surface of its property. They
had started a shaft about thirty-five
feet from this ledge and had walked
over it a number of times. Its dis
covery was purely accidental and
now in all probability they will sink
directly on it. The values at the sur
face average $50 a ton. The Helena
Broken Hills lease also made a sur
race strike which is believed to be
the continuation of the big ledge that
is being worked in the main shaft. It
is situated 300 feet from the main
shaft and the values are good. The
ledge is nearly seven feet in width.
"Mr. McCormack is now waiting
for the figures on the cost of the con
struction of a pipe line, the average
results of the ore tests and the cost
of the proposed mill, and when these
are received the work of erecting the
mill will be started arid rushed to
completion. There will be no delay
in getting the machinery into the
camp, as the company has a sufficien
cy of teams to expidite the hauling.
"In the town of Helena there are
now between eighty and 100 estab
lishments and of these twenty7two
are frame buildings, the rest being
tent houses. A number of dwellings
are being erected and inside of sixty
days the place will have the appear
ance of a pioneer mining camp."
Mr. Murphy left yesterday after
noon for Goldfield and will return to
Helena today.
