noble act, and in receiving the grateful

sufferings they have relieved.
Foreign Relations The Alabama
Treaty.
The relations of the United States with
foreign powers continue to be friendly. The
year has been an eventful one in witjpssing
two great nations, speaking one language
and having one lineage, settling by arbitra
tion disputes of long standing, and liable at
any time to bring those nations in bloody
ind hostile conflicts. An example has thus
been set which, if successful in its
final issue, may be followed by
other civilized nations and be the final
means of returning to productive industry
two millions of men now maintained to
settle tbe disputes of nations by the bayonet
( and broadsword.
I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty
alluded to, which has been concluded since
the adjournment of Congress with herBrit
anic Majesty, and a copy of the protocol of
the conferences of the Commissioners
by whom it was negotiated. This treaty
provides methods for adjusting tfie ques
tions pending between the two nations, and
various questions are to be adjusted by ar
bitration. I recommend Congress at an
early day to make the necessary provision
for the tribunal at Geneva, and for the
several Commissions on the part of the
United States called for by the treaty. His
Majesty the King of Italy, the President
of the Swiss Confederation and his Majesty
the Emperor of Brazil have eacli
consented on the joint request of
the two powers to name an ar
bitrator for the tribunal at Geneva. I have
caused mvthanxs to be suitably expressed
for the readiness with which the joint re
quest has been complied with by the ap
pointment of gentlemen of eminence and
learning to these important positions. HU
Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, has been
pleased to comply with the joint re
quest of the two Governments, and has con
sented to act as the arbitrator of tbe dis
puted water boundary between the United
States and Great Britain. The con
tracting parties in the treaty liave
undertaken to regard as binding be
tween themselves certain principles of pub
lic law, for which, the United States has
contended from the commencement of their
history. They have also agreed to bring
these principles to the knowledge
of the other maratime powers and
to invite them to accede to them.
Negotiations are going on as to the form of
the note by which the invitation is to be ex
tended to the powers. I recommend the
legislation necessary on the part of the
United States, to bring into operation the
articles of the treaty relating to the fisheries,
and to the other matters touching the rela
tions of the United States towards the
British North American possessions to be
come operative as soon as the proper legis
lation shall bo had on the part of Great
Britain and its possessions. It is much to
be desired that this legislation may become
operative before the fishermen of the United
Stales begin to make their arrangements for
the coming season.
State Action.
I have addressed a communication, of
which a copy is transmitted herewith, to the
Governors of New York, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Blinoh and West
Virginia, upon the governments of those
States, respecting the necessary action on
their Dart to carrv into effect the object of
the article of the treaty which contemplates
the use of the canals on either side con
nected with the navigation of the lakes and
rivers forming the boundary in terms of
equity by the inhabitants of both countries.
It is honed that the importance of this ob
ject and the benefits tov flow therefrom will
secure the speeuy approval auu legislative
sanction of the States concerned. I renew
the recommendation for an appointment
for determining the true position of the
forty-ninth parallel of latitude where it
forms the boundary between the United
States and the British American jiosses
sions, between the Lake of the Woods and
the summit of the Rocky Mountains. The
early action of Congress in this recom
mendation named would put it in the
power of tbe War Department to place a
force in the field during the next summer.
France and Germany.
The resumption of diplomatic relations
between France and Germany have enabled
me to give directions for the withdrawal of
the protection extended to Germans in
France by the diplomatic and consular
representatives of the United State in that
country.
It is just to add that the delicate duty
of this specidation has been performed by
the Minister and Consul General at Paris,
and the various Consuls in France, under
the supervisions of the latter, with great
kindness as well as with prudence and tact.
Their course has received the commenda
tion of the German government, and has.
wounded no susceptibility of the French.
The government of the Emperor of Ger
many continues to manifest a friendly feel
ing toward the United States, and a desire
tonarmonize with moderate and just policy
which this government maintains. In its
relations with Asiatic powers, as well as
With the South American republics I
have given assurance that the friendly
feelings of that government are fully shared
by the United States.
Austria and Italy.
The ratification of the consular and natu
ralization connectiahs with the Austria
Hungary empire have been exchanged. I
have been officially informed of the annexa
tion of the States of the Ghurch to the
kingdom of Italy, and the removal of the
capital of that kingdom to Rome.. In con
formity with the established policy of the
United States, I have recognized this
change. The ratification of the new treaty
of commerce between the United States
and Italy have been exchanged; the two
powers have agreed in their treaty that prop
erty at sea shall be exempt from capture in
case of war between the two potfers. The
United States have spared no opportunity
of incorporating this rula into the
obligations of nations.
Spanish Claims.
The Forty-first Congress, at Its third
session, made an appropriation for the
organization of a mixed commission
for adjudicating upon tho claims of
citizens of the United States against
Spain growing out of the insurrection in
Cuba, and that commission has since been
organized. I transmit herewith the corre
spondence relating to its formation and its
jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this
commission will afford the claimants a com

Japan.
With Japan,we continue in samewhat inti
mate relations. The Cabinet of the Mikado
has since the close of the last session of Con
gress selected citizens of the United States
to serve in offices important in several de
partments of the government. I have rea
son to think that this selection is due to
an appreciation of the disinterestedness
of the policy which the United States has
pursued toward Japaif! It is our desire to
continue to maintain this disinterestedness
and just policy with China as well as with
Japan. The correspondence transmitted
herewith shows that there is no disposition
on the part of this government to swerve
from its established course.
Corca.
Prompted by a desire to put an end to
the barbarous treatment of our shipwrecked
sailors on the Corean coast, 1 instructed
our minister at Pckin to endeavor to con
clude a convention with Corea for se
curing the safety and inhumane treatment
of ,such mariners. Admiral Rogers
was instructed to accompany him
with a sufficient force to protect him in case
of need. A small surveying party sent out
on reaching the coast was treachously at
tacked at a disadvantage. Ample ' opportu
nity for explanation and apology for the in
sult was given; but neither came. A force'
was then landed. After an arduous march
over a rugged 3Hd difficult country, the forts
from which the outrages had been commit
ted were gallantly assaulted and destroyed.
Having thus punished tho criminals, and
having vindicated the honor of the flag, the
expedition returned, findingit impracticable
under the circumstances to conclude the de
sired consummation. I respectfully refer
to the correspondence relating thereto here
with submitted, and leave the subject for
such action as Congress may see fit to take.
Mexico Zona Libre.
The republic of Mexico has not yet re
pealed the very objectionable law establish
ing what is known as the free zone on the
frontier of the United States. It Is hoped
that this may yet be done, and also that
more stringent measures be take by that
republic for restraining lawless persons on
its frontiers. I hope that Mexico, by its
own action, wilj soon relieve ' this govern
ment of the difficulties experienced from
these causes.
The Tcneznclan Claims.
Our relations with the various Republics
of Central and South America continue,
with one exception, to be cordial and
friendly.
I recommend some action by Congress
regarding the over due installments under
the award of the Venezuela Claims Com
mission of 1SG0. The internal dissentions
of tins Government present rib just occa
sion for absence of effort to meet their
solemn treaty obligations.
.- Nicaragua.
The ratification of an extradition treaty
with Nicaragua has been exchanged.
Brazil Ejnnncl pa tloa.
It is a subject for congratulation that the
great Empire of Brazil lias taken the initia
tory steps toward the abolition of slavery.
Our relations with tliat Empire, always cor
dial, will naturally be more so by this act.
It is not too much to hope tliat the govern
ment of Brazil may hereafter find it for its
interest as well as intrinsically right, to ad
vance toward entire emancipation more
rujlly than the present act contemplates.
The true prosperity and greatness of a
Ration is to be found in tne elevation and
education of its laborers. It is a subject
for regret that the reforms in this direc
tion which were voluntarily promised by the
Statesmen of Spam have not been carried
out in its Indian colonies. The laws and
regulations for the apparent abolition of
slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico leave most
of the laborers in bondage witii no hope of
release until they become a burden to their
employer.
American Slavclloldcrs Abroad.
I desire to direct your attention to tho
fact that citizens of the United States are
large holders in foreign lands of this species
of property forbidden by the fundamental
law of their adopted country. I recom
mend to Congress to provide by stringent
legislation a suitable remedy against the
holding, owning or dealing in slaves, or be
ing interested in slave property in foreign
lands, either as owners, hirers or mortgagers
by persons of the United States.
Tho Cuban Rebellion
It is to be regretted that the disturbed
condition of the Island of Cuba continues to
lie a source of annoyance and of anxiety.
The existence of a protracted struggle in
such close proximity to our own territory,
without apparent prospect of an early term
ination, cannot be other than an object of
concern to a people who while abstaining
from interference in the affairs of other
powers, naturally desire to see every coun
try in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace
ami liberty, and the blessing of free insti
tutions. Kelattons with Spain.
Our naval commanders in Cuban waters
have been instructed in case it should be
come necessary, to spare no effort to protect
the lives and property of bona fido Ameri
can citizens, and to maintain the dignity of
the flag. It is hoped that all pending
questions with Spain, growing out of the
affairs of Cuba, may be adjusted in the
spirit of peace and conciliation which lias
hitherto guided the two powers in their
treatment of such questions.
China and Japan.
To give importance, and to add to tho
efficiency of our diplomatic relations with
Japan and China, and to further in re
taining the good opinion of those people,
and to secure to the United States its share
of the commerce destined to flow between
those nations and the balance of the com
mercial woild, I earnestly recommend an
appropriation be made to support at least
four American youths in each of theso
countries to serve as a part of the official
family of our Ministers there. Our repre
sentatives would not even then be placed
upon an equality with the representatives
of Great Britain and som eother powers. As
now situated our representatives in Japan
and China !(,ve to depend for interpreters
and t ranslators upon natives of those coun
tries who know our language imperfectly,
or procure for the occasion the services of
employees in foreign business houses or the
interpretation to other foreign Ministers.
I would also recommend liberal
measures for the purpose of sup
porting the American lines of steamers
now plying between San Francisco and Ja
pan and China and the Australian line, al
most our only remaining line of ocean
steamers, and of increasing their service.
The KiiHonnl Debt
has been reduced to the extent of $S,0.Yf,
120.SO during the year, and by the n'"tia
tion of national bonds at a lower lat of in
terest, the interest on the public debt has
been so far diminished that now the sum to
be raised for the interest account is nearly
$17,000,000 less than on the first of March,
1S69. It was highly desirable that this
diminution should take place, both to
strengthen the credit of the country and to

Bat in view of the accomplishment of
, these desirable ends, of tha rapid develop-
ment. w tne resources or tne country, Its
increasing ability to meet large demands
and the amount already paid, it is not de
sirable .that the present resources of the
country should continue to be taxed in or
der to continue thb rapid pavment.
I therefore recommend a modification of
both, the tann ana internal revenue tax
laws. I recommend that all taxes from in
ternar (sources .be .abolished, except those
on spirituous, vinous and malt ,iauors. to-
fbacco ,'invits various forms, and from
stamps.
In readjusting the tariff, I suceest that a
careful estimate be made of the amount of
surplus revenue collected under the nresent
laws after providing tire current expenses of
tne liovernment. tua interest juwmnf. nnri n
fsinfing- fund, and that this, as surplus, be
reuucea in sucn a manner as to atlord the
greatest relief to the greatest number.
There are. many articles not mroduced
IJatiome, such as medicine and compounded
essences ironi wiucn very little revenue is
derived, but which enter into general use.
All such articles I recommend to be placed
on the free list. Should a further reduction
prove advisable, I would then recommend
that it be made on those articles which can
bear it without disturbing home production
or reducing tho wages of American labor.
I have not entered Into figures, because to
do so would be to repeat all that is laid be
fore you is the report of tho Secretary of
the Treasury.
The Collector System A Premlnm on
Dishonesty.
The present laws for collecting the reve
nue pay Collectors of Customs small salaries,
hut provide for shares in all seizures, which,
at the principal ports of entry particularly,
raise the compensation of theso officials to
a large sum. It has always seemed to me
as if this system must at times work
perniciously. It holds out an in
ducement to dishonest men, should
such get possession of those offices, to be
lax in their scrutiny of goods entered, to
enable them finally to make large seizures.
Your attention is respectfully invited to
this subject.
Onr Unstable Currency.
The continued fluctuation in the value of
gold as compared with the National cur
rency, has a most damaging effect upon the
increase and development of the country in
keeping up prices of all articles necessary in
every day life. It fosters a spirit of gamb
ling on the National finances. If the ques
tion can be met as to how to get a fixed
value to our currency, tliat value constantly
and uniformly approaching par with specie,
a very desirable object will be gained.
Tho Army.
For the operations of the army in the
past year, the expense of maintaining it,
the estimates for the ensuing year, and
for continuing sea coast and other
improvements conducted under the
supervision of the War Department, I re
fer you to the accompanying report of the
Secretary of War.
I call your attention to the provisions of
the act of Congress approved March 3,1SC9,
which discontinues promotions in the stair
corps of the army until provided for by law.
I recommend that the number of officers in
each grade of the Staff Corps be fixed, and
that whenever the number in any one grade
falls below the number so fixed that the
vacancy may be filled by promotion from
the grade below. I also recommend that
when the office of Chief of a Corps be
comes vacaut the place may be filled by se
lection from the Corps in which the vacancy
exists.
The Xavy.
The report of the Secretary cf the Navy
shows an Improvement in the num
ber and efficiency of the naval force,
.without material increase in the expense of
supporting it. inis is due to the policy
which has been adopted and is being ex
tended as fast as our material will admit,
of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the
several stations. By these means we have
been enabled to occupy at once a larger ex
tent of cruising ground, to visit more
frequently the posts where the presence of
our fla? is desirable, and generally to dis
charge efficiently the appropriate duties of
tbe navy in time of peace, without exceed
ing tha number of men or the expenditures
authorized by law. During the past year
this navy lias, In addition to its regular
service, supplied the men and officers for the
vessels of the coast survey, and has com
pleted the surveys authorized by Congress
of the Isthmus of Darien and Tehauntepec,
and under our authority has sent out an ex
pedition completely furnished and equipped
to explore the unknown ocean of the North.
The suggestions of the report as to the ne
cessity for increasing and improving
the material of the navy and the
plan recommended for" reducing
the personel of the service to a peace stand
ard by the gradual abolition of certain
grades of officers, the reduction of others
and the employment of some in the service
of the commercial marine are well consid
ered, and deserve the thoughtful attention
of Congress. I also recommend that all
promotions in the navy above captain be
by selection instead of by seniority. This
course will secure in the higher grades
greater efficiency and hold out an incentive
to young officers to improve themselves
in the knowledge of their profession. The
present cost of maintaining the navy, its
cost compared with that of the preceding
year, and the estimates of the ensuing year
are contained in the accompanying report
of the Secretary of tho Navy.
Tho Postollicc.
The enlarged receipts of the Postofflce
Department, as shown by the accompany
ing report of the Postmaster-General, ex
hibits a gratifying increase in that branch of
the public service. It is tbe index of tho
growth of education and of the prosperity
of the people, two elements highly condu
cive to the vigor and stability of republics.
With a vast territory like ours, much of it
sparsely populated, hut all requiring the
service of the mails, it is not, at present, to
be expected that this department can be
made self-sustaining; but a gradual ap
proach to this end, from year to year, is
confidently relied on, and the day is not far
distant when the Postollicc Department of
the Government will prove a much greater
blessing to the whole people than it is now
Postal Telegraph.
The suggestions of the Postmaster-General
for improvements in the department
presided over by him, are earnestly recom
mended to your special attention, and es
pecially tho documents and a favorable con
sideration of the plan for uniting the tele
graph system of tho Umted States with the
postal system. It is believed tliat by such
a course the cost of telegraphing could be
much reduced, and tho service as well, if
not better rendered. . It woidd secure
further advantage by -extending the tele
graph through portions of tho country
where private enterptize will not con'
struct it. Commerce, trade, and above
all, the efforts to bring a people
widely separated into a commuity of
interests, are always benefitted by a
rapid intercommunication. Education,
the ground work of Republican institutions
is encouraged by increasing tho facilities

country. The desire to reap tho benefit of
such improvements will stimulate educa

tions of last year, and for comparative state
ments of results with former years.
The Ka-Klnx.
There has been imposed upon the Execu
tive branch of government the execution of
the act of Congress approved April 20, 1671,
and commonly known as the Ku-Klux law.
In a portion os the State of South Carolina
the necessity of the course pursued will be
demonstrated by the report of the commit
tee to investigate Southern outrages. Un
der the provisions of the above act I issued
a proclamation calling the attention of the
people of the United States to the same and
declaring my rel uctance to exercise any of the
extraordinary powers thereby conferred
upon me, except in case of imperative ne
cessity, but making known my purpose to
exercise such powers whenever it should
become necessary to do so for the purpose
of securing to all citizens of the United
States tlie peaceful enjoyment of t 'hts
goarantecd to thorn by custon 6
TUESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1871.
-
laws; After the passage"" of 'thjs law, infor
mation was received from time to time that
a combination of the character referred to
in this law existed, and were powerful in
many parts of the Southern States, particu
larly in counties in the State of South Car
olina. Careful investigation was made and it
was ascertained that in many counties of
that State such combinations were active
and powerful, embracing a sufficient portion
of the citizens to control the local author
ity, and having aiqong other things the object
of depriving the emancipated class of the sub
stantial benefits of freedom and of liberty,
and the free political action of those citizens
who did '-not -sympathize with their -own
views. Among their operations were frequent-scourgings
and occasion?!- assassina
tions, generally perpetrated at night by dis
guised persons, the victims in' almost all
cases being citizens of fllfferent political
sentiments from their own, or free persons
who had showa a, disposition to claim equal
rights with" other citizens. Thousands of
inoffensive and well disposed citizens were
the sufferers by this lawless, violence.
Thereupon, on the 13th of October, 1871,
a proclamation was issued in the terms of
the lawj calling upon the members of the
combination to disperse within five days
and to deliver to the marshal or military
officers of tha United States all arms, am
munition, uniforms, disguises and other
means and implements used by them for
carrying out their unlawful purposes. This
warning not having been heeded, on the
17th of October another proclamation was
issued, suspending the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus in nine
counties in that State. Direction
was given that within the counties so des
ignated, persons supposed upon creditable
information to be members of such unlaw
ful combinations should be arrested by the
military forces of tbe United States and de
livered to the marshal, to be dealt with ac
cording to law. In two of said counties,
York and Spartansburg, many arrests have
been made.
At the last account the number of per
sons thus arrested was one hundred and
sixty-eight. Several hundred, whose crim
inality was ascertained to be of an inferior
degree were released for the present. These
have generally made confessions of their
guilt. Great caution has been exercised in
making these arrests, and notwithstanding
the large number, it is believed that no in
nocent person is now in custody. Tho
prisoners will ba held for regular trial in
the judicial tribunals of the United States.
As soon as it appeared that the authorities
of the United States were about to taka
vigorous measures to enforce the law, many
persons absconded, and there is good ground
for supposing that all of such persons have
violated the law.
A full report of what has been done un
der this law will be submitted to Congress
by the Attorney General.
Hormonism.
In the United States there still remains a
remnant of barbarism repugnant to civili
zation, decency, and to the laws of the
United States. Territorial officers, how
ever, have been found who are willing to
perform their duty in the spirit of equity
and with a due sense of sustaining the
majesty of the law. Neither polygamy nor
any other violation of existing statutes will
be permitted within the territory of the
United States. It is not with the
religion of the self-styled " saints
ttt we are now dealing,
bflt their practices. They will be protect
ed in the worship of God according to the
dictates of their consciences, but ihey will
not be permitted to violate the laws under
the cloak of religion. It may be advisable
for Congress to consider what, in the exe
cution of the laws against polygamy, is to
be the
Status of Plural Wives
and their sttspring. The proprietyof Con
gress passing an enabling act, authorizing
the territorial Legislature of Utah to legiti
matize all born prior to a time fixed in the
act might be justified by its humanity to
these innocent children. This is a sugges
tion only, and not a recommendation.
The Indians.
Tho policy pursued towards tho Indians
has resulted favorably, so far as can be
judged from the limited time during which
it has been in operation. Through the ex
ertions of the various societies of Christians,
to whom has been entrusted the execution
of the policy, and the Board of Commis
sioners authorized by tbe law of April 10,
1S09, many tribes of Indians have been in
duced to settle on reservations, to cultivate
the soil, and perform productive labor of
various kinds, and to partially accept civil
ization. They are being cared for
in such a way, it is hoped, as
to induce those still pursuing their
old habit of life to embrace the only oppor
tunity which is left them to avoid extermi
nation. I recommend liberal appropriations
to carry out tbe Indian peace policy, not
only because it is humane, Chistian-like and
economical, but because it is right.
Indian Territory.
I recommend to your favorable considera
tion, also, the policy of granting a Territorial
Government to the Indians of the Indian
Territory west of Arkansas and Missouri,
and south of Kansas. In doing so every
rieht Guaranteed to Indians 'by treatv
should be secured. Such a course might bo
the means of collecting most of the Indians
now between the Missouri and Pacific and
south of the British Possessions into one
Territory or one State. The Secretary of
the Interior lias treated upon this subject at
length, and I recommend to you his sugges
tions.
The Public lAuds.
I renew my recommendations that the
public lands be regarded as a heritage to our
children, to be disposed ot omy as required
for occupation and to actual sutlers. Those
already granted have been in great part dis
posed of in such a way as to secure access
to the balance by the hardyettler who may
wish to avail himself of them, but caution
should be exercised in attaining so desirable
an object. Tho educat!onal interest may
well be served by the grant of the proceeds
of sale of public lands to settlers. 1 do not
wish to be understood as recommending in
the least degree a curtailment of what is
being done by tho general goverment for
the encouragement ot education.
The Census etc.
The report of the Secretary of the In
terior, submitted with this, will give you
information collected and prepared for
publication in regard to the census taken
during the year 1870, the operations ti the
Bureau of Education for the year, the
Patent Office, the Pension Office, the Land
kOffice and the Indian Bureau.
The Agricultural Bureau.
The report of the Commissioner of Agri
cultures gives the operation of his depart
ment for tho year. As agriculture is the
ground-work of our prosperity, too much
importance cannot be attached to the labors
of this department. It" Is in the hands of
an able head, with able assistants, all zeal
ously devoted to introducing into the agri
cultural productions of the nation all useful
products adapted to any of the various
climates and soils of our vast territory, and
to giving all usefid information as to the
method of cultivation of plants, cereals or
other products adapted to particular locali
ties. Quietly but surely the Agricultural
Bureau is working a great national good,
and if liberally supported, the mors widely
its influence will be extended and the less
dependent we shall bo upon the products of
foreign countries.
Increased Salaries.
The subject of compensation to the heads
of bureaus and officials holding positions of
responsibility and requiring ability and
character to fill properly, is one to which
your attention is invited. But few of the
officials receive a compensation equal to the
respectable support of a family, while their
duties are such as to involve millions of in
terest. In private life sen-ants demand
compensation equal to the services rendered.
A wise economy would dfState the same
rule in the government service.
- Estimates.
I have not given the estimates far the
support of the government for the ensuing
year, nor the comparative statement between
the expenditures for the year ju3t passed
and the ono just preceding, because all
these figures are contained in the accompa
nying reports or in those presented directly
to Congress. These estimates liave my
approval. ' : '

then arrayed against each other, the one for
the preservation and the other for the de
struction of the Union, it may well be con
sidered whether it is not now time that the"
disabilities imposed by the 14th Amendment
should be removed. That amendment
does not exclude the ballot, but only requires
the disability to hold office of certain classes.
When the purity of the ballot and secure
majorities are sure to elect officers reflect
ing the views of the majority, I do not see
the advantage or propriety of excluding
men from office merely because they ware
before the rebellion, of standing and charac
ter sufficient to be elected to positions
requiring them to take the oath to sup
port the constitution, and admitting
to eligibility those entertaining precisely the
same views, but of less standing in the
communities. It may be said the former
violated an oath while the latter did not.
The latter did not have it in their power to
do so. If they had taken this oath, it can
not be doubted they would have broken it
as did the former class. If there are any
great criminals distinguished above all oth
ers for the part they took in opposition to
the Government, they might in the judg
ment cf Congress be excluded from such
amnesty. This subject is submitted for
your careful consideration.
The condition of the Southern States is
unhappily not such as all true, patriotic cit
izens would like to see. Social ostracism
for opinion's sake,personal violence or threats
Tho Temper of the Kontb
towards persons entertaining political views
opposed to those entertained by the majori
ty of the old citizens prevents immigration
and the flow of much needed capital into
the States lately in -rebellion. It will be a
happy condition of the coifutry when the
old citizens of these States take an interest
in public afiairs, promulgate ideas honestly
entertained, vote for men representing their
views, and permit the same freedom of ex
pression and ballot to those entertianing
different political convictions.
Tbe Territory of Colnmbin
Under the provisions of tho act of Con
gress approved July 21, 1871, a territorial
government was 'organized in the District
of Columbia. Its results have thus far ful
ly realized the expectations of its advocates.
Under the direction of territorial officera a
system of improvements have been inaugu
rated by means or wlncn Wasmngton is
rapidly becoming a city worthy of tbe na
tion's capital. The citizens of the .District
of Columbia havinz voluntarily taxed them
selves to a large amount for the purpose of
contnbutinc to the advancement or the seat
of government,! recommend liberal appropri
ations on the part ot congress in oraer tnat
the government may bear its just share of the
expense ot carrying out a jmucious system
of improvements.
Chicago.
By the fire in Chicago the most important
of the government buildings in that city
were consumed. Those burned had al
ready become inadeqate to the wants of the
government in that growing city, and look-
ins: to the near ruture were totally insuui
cient. I recommend, therefore, that an ap
propriation be made immediately to pur
chase the remainder of the square on which
the building stood, provided it can be pur
chased at a luir valuation, and providing the
Legislature of Illinois will pass a law author
izing its construction for government pur
pose, and also an oner ol as much money
as can properly be expended towards the
erection of new buildings during this fiscal
year.
Imrai ir rants.
Tho number of immigrants ignorant of
our laws and habits and coming Into ou:
country annually have become so great and
the impositions practiced upon them so
numerous and flagrant that I suggest Con
gressional action lor their protection, it
seems to me the affair is a subject of legis
lation by Congress. I cannot now state as
fully as I desire the nature of the complaints
made by emigrants of the treatment they
receive, but will endeavor to do so during
the session of Congress, particularly if the
Sliuject suouiu reccivu yuur aiicuiiuu.
Civil Service Reform.
It lias been the aim of the administration
to enforce honesty and efficiency in all pub
lic offices. .Every public. servant who has
violated the trust placed in him, has been
proceeded against with all the vigor of the
law. If bad men have secured places, it
lias beonthc fault of the system established
by law, and the custom of making appoint
ments, or tne lauit oi tuose wno recom
mended for government positions, persons
not sufhcientiy well known to them person
ally, or who give letters indorsing the char-
actor or oihce-seeKers, witnout a proper
sense of the grave responsibility which such
a course devolve upon them. A civil ser
vice reform which can correct this abuse is
much needed.
In mercantile pursuits the business man
who gives a letter of recommendation to a
friend to enable him to obtain credit from
a stranger is regarded as morally responsi-
. . . . 1 C 1 1 1
ble lor toe integrity oi nis menu auu uis
ability to meet his obligations. A reforma
tory law wliich would enforce this principle
against all endorsers of persons for public
place would Insure great caution in making
recommendations. A salutary lesson has
been taught the careless and the dishonest
servant in the great number of prosecutions
and convictions of the last two years. It
is gratifying to notice the favorable change
which is taking place throughout the coun
try in bringing to punishment those who
have proved recreant to the trusts confided
to them, and in elevating to public office
none but those who possess the confidence
of the honest and virtuous, who it will al
ways be found comprise the majority of the
community in which they live.
In my message to Congress one year ago
I urgently recommended a reform in the'
civil service of the country. In conformity
with that recommendation Congress in the
ninth section of an act making appropria
tion for sundry civil expenses of the Gov
ernment and for other purposes, approved
March 3, 1871, gave the necessary authority
to the Executive to inaugurate civil service
reform, and placed upon him the responsi
bility cf doing so. Undsr the authority of
saM law I convened a board of gentlemen'
eminently qualified for the work, to devise
rules and regidations to effect the needed
reform. Their labors are not yet complete,
but it is believed that they will succeed in
devising a plan which can be adopted to the
great relief of the Executive, the heads of
Departments and members of Congress,
and which will redound to the true interest
of tho public service. At all events tha
experiment shall have a fair trial.
Conclusion.
I have thus hastily summed up the opera
tions of the Government during the last
year, and made such suggestions as occur
to me labe proper for your consideration.
I submit them with a confidence that your
combined action will be wise ana statesman
like, and in Uie best interest of the whole
country. U. S. Gbant, President

A that Didn't Come OfC
CnyccRfATi, Dec 4 The misunder
standing between Gen. Uurbridge and Col.
O'Neal, of Covington, resulted, it is said, in
a challenge by the latter. Burbridge ac
cepted, whereupon O'Neal treated it as a
joke. It is expected tho correspondence will
be published to-morrow.
Later. The hostile correspondence be
tween Gen. O'Neal and Gen. Biirbridge
consisted of five letters: On Dec 1 O'Neal
wrote to Burbridge, "My love for vour fam
ily precludes my challenging yon," and
adds, "it is with you to waive such matters.
I demand satisfaction." Gen. Biirbridge
replies: "I am ready to afford you satisfac
tion, and waive family considerations."
O'Neal responded: "Name the time and
place." Burbridge answers : " I have
placed the matter entirely in
the hands of Col. W. G. Terrell." O'Neal
asks time till Dec 2, to select a friend.
On Dec 2 O'Neal announces the choice of
Capt. J. M. Tisdale as his friend. An ap
pointment was made for the seconds to
meet at the Clifton House, Covington, at
10 o'clock in the forenoon, but the meeting
did not take place. The following notes
conauueu me matter :
To Col. Terrell Dear Sin I am author
ized by Col. O'Neal to say tliat if Ids com
munication of yesterday was construed into
a cliaiienge, that the construction is erro
neous. J. M. TISDALE.
To Capt. Tisdale Sir : If Col. O'Neal
does not mean by his reiterated demand for
satisfaction from Gen. Burbridge and his
request that Gen. B. should fix a time and
place ot meeting, wliat did he mean? Please,
therefore, see Col. O'Neal without delay and
ascertain more precisely the meaning of the
note, which my friend understands to be
a cliaiienge. W. G. Terrelt..
To Col. Terrell: I am authorized by
Col. O'Neal to say that the object of his
communication yesterday was based on tlie
hypothesis that Gen. Burbridge liad done
him injury, and he "desired to
know from him if he was witting to
render satisfaction to him so as to enable
Wm to know ho w to act In the future. The
satisfaction he desires is such as two gen
tlemen would say was due him under the
crcumstances, without reference to the
code of honor. Jas. M. Tisdale.
Mr. Tisdale: Sir: I have no authori
ty to act as a peace commissioner in this
business, and I shall advise Gen. Burbridge
to pay no further attention to Col. O'Neal.
W. G. Terrell.
Here the correspondence ended.
Heavy Damages.
Ciscixxati, Dec. 4. Laura Sweney,
daughter of Wm. Sweney, a well-known
lumber dealer of Xenia, Ohio, entered suit
Saturday against Rev. Thos. Winters ami
wife and II. II. Eavey and wife, claiming
5iu,wj damages in each case.
CHICAGO.
Mayor 3Iedill's 31etaso.
Chicago, Dec. 4. The new ilayor and
other city and county officers were inaugu
rated tnis evening. .Mayor iledill s mes
sage places the total loss of city propertriy
the fire at $2,500,000. The estimated
amount of tase tliat will be due under the
present assessment, after making rebate for
loss oi property by tire, is SS-'jUOO, from
which reasonable deductions must be made
for delinquencies and resistance of payj
ment.
Tho ilayor refers sharply to a class of
property nolders who have acquired the bad
habit of contesting in the courts the pay
ment oi au taxes, ana ha missing the city
with appeals, injunctions and other devices
whereby the city is defrauded out of large
sums oi money justly due it:
By a decision of the Suprer. Court
since its organization under new Constitu
tion, special assessments are decltreduncon
stitutional. This in the opinion of the
Corporation counsel so unsettles the law of
assessments as to render it impossible for
tlie city to contmuo its Improvement under
the present charter unless hereafter the cost
of all street opening, widening, or improve
ments, and or side walks, shall be paid by
general taxation. Under the decision of
the Court there seems to be no other prac
ticable way.
Tho ilayor says the realization of reve
nue from tha sale of bonds is cut ofT by the
new constitution and the lavish expendi
tures which have characterized the gast
must now be replaead by rigid economy
Ilerecommends a reduction of salaries and
suggests the appointment cf a committee to
ascertain where expenses may be re
trenched. An interesting part of the message Is a
review of the combustible character of the
city. He says: Hereafter buildings shoukl
be built of the thickest stone, and he b op
posed from this time forward to tho erec
tion of a single wooden building within the
limits of Chicago. He recommends a bet
ter supply of water in adopting the plan in
vogue in New York and other cities, in the
construction of subterranean reservoirs at
6trcet corners.
In conclusion, the Mayor points with
pride and admiration to the gigantic efforts
our people are putting forth to rise from tlie
ruins and rebuild Chicago. All. are inspired
with an ambition to prove to the world that
they are worthy of its sympathy, confidence
and assistance, and to show how bravely
they can encounter disaster, how quickly
repair losses, and restore Chicago to her
high nrnk among the great cities of Uh
earth.
Liqdoi: La'w. Michigan appears to be
the champion temperance State. Under
her amended liquor law, now in force, any
person found drinking in a saloon, tavern,
or public place, or in the streets, is liable to
a fine of live dollars and costs, or Imprison
ment for not more than twenty days. No
countenance, much less aid and comfort, is
;iven to the great enemy of our social
peace, aucii a measure is eqnaiiy sounu as
a principle of political Conomy, and as a
conservator of morals.
Value of Fences. It is said that the
improved lands in South Carolina are worth
$20,000,000, while tho fences that inclose
them have actually cost $10,000,000. The
fences in New York have cost 144,000,000
those of Ohio $115,000,000; and according
to an estimate made by Nicholas Biddle,
thirty years ago, the fences of Pennsylva
nia had then cost $i'JU,UUU,UOU. The fences
of the whole Union are estimated at $1,-
300,000,000.
Hate-fins. There is but one hair-pin
manufactory In the United States: but that
one turns out an average of fifty tons per
month. They are jobbed to tbe wholesale

The I-!te Trafredlea FJfht Citizens
Shot Down by It a III ills' Volunteers.
New York, Dec. 4. Havana letters of
the 28th give details of the troubles thsr
and the execution of eight students, show
ing tliat the only desecration to the grave of
Castanon consisted of breaking the glass
cases covering the niche of the tomb and
substituting wreaths of garlics instead of
immortelles. At tlie court martial the chap
lain stated it was only a student's frolic and
did not deserve severe sentences, but tha
clamors of the volunteers overruled every
thing eke, and eight were condemned to
death, eleven sentenced to sis years in the
chaia gang, nineteen to four years in the
same gang, four to six months' imprison
ment, and two were liberated.
The sentences were immediate
ly executed, those murdered
not being allowed an hour's respite to see
friends. The volunteers raided through tho
streets all day, shooting eight Cubans.
Business was entirely suspended, and quiet
only partially restored after the executions.
The students were all quite young, mere
boys, but met their deaths bravely, in the
presence of an immense throng. Their
parents offered large sums of money to save
them, the father of one offering one million
dollars, but all wen: vain. The Captain
General, Valmaseda, was absent at tho
time, but fully snstainHl tbe murders on his
return. The authorities appear perfectly
impotent in the presence of the volunteers.
PitAcriCAL, Science. Not long since,
on a perfectly calm day, with a clear sky,
about fifty vessels were seen lying at anchor
in one of our liarbors, on account of a com
ing storm predicted by the AVeather Bureau.
How many lives were saved by this single
prediction, it is impossible to say, but one
such occurence alone is sufficient to justify
all tlie expense the Government has incur
red in establishing and mafotaiarog the ser
vice. It has beenfetearty shown tliat, if we
had had cable communication with tho Is
land of St. Tliomas, and a signal station
there, we should have known of the cy
clone's recent visit to tlie FlonVla coast
three days in advance of its coming, and
most of the vessels which encountered It
would have taken refuge in time in some
arbor. Tlie service, as it is already or
ganized, is of incokkbk advantage to far
mers and seafarers; but its possibilities,
when it shall become International in its
sphere of action, are siwrti as to warrant its
extension, at almost any cost, to every por-
tion of tlie earth with which wc are in tele
graphic communication. y
