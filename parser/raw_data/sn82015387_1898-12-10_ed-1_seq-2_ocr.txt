The English meteorologists are
talking of making weather predic

hours. They believe that such pre

the conditions must be carefully
watched in order to determine the
character of coming weather. "These
are in central Europe, over Iceland
and Greenland and over the Azores.
Meteorologists believe that if they
can obtain accurate data from these
regions they will be able to predict
days ahead.

Poll Tax Suffrage Clause.!
The coutention is being made by
some, chefly politicians, that the
payment of the poll tax for two
years preceeding an election, which
is requisite, in order to enable
registered voters to cast a ballot,
does not take effect until after the
year 1900, and, therefore, it cannot
be applied to the presidential and
congressional elections in 1900,
but can only go into operation two
years after 1900, or in the con
gressional election of 190".
The people who are holding to
this notion are Democrats; while
the Republicans understand that
the law applies to the Federal elec
tions of 1900. The constitution
says that the section in regard to
the poll tax payment as a requisite
to the casting of a ballot "shall
not go into operation until after
the general State election to be
held in the year 1900." Can this
mean that the section is to be in
operative until after the general
State dlectiou in April, 1900, or
until after the end of that year?
The general Louisiana State
election will be held in April, 1900.
The election for President of the
United States and for Representa
tives in Congress will be held in
November, 1900. Taking it for
granted that the law means what
it says, and that since the consti
tution was made to eliminate as
much of the negro as possible, and
the negro vote is more formidable
in Federal than in State elections,
because the former are held under
the authority and control of the
'National Government, it was de
signed, in framing the poll tax suf
frage clause to mate it apply to
the federal elections in November,
but not to the State elections in the
previous April. Thus the poll tax
provision, while it passes over the
State election in April, in all hu
man certainty applies to the na
tional election in November.
At any rate, it will be very
dangerous to disregard this view
of the matter should Democrats
generally in 1900 vote for Con
gressmen without complying with
the poll tax requirement. The
Congressmen so elected wAill be cer
tain to have their seats contested,
and they will be unseated by Con
gress on the ground that they were
chosen by voters who violated their
State constitution, and, consequent
ly, had no right to cast their bal
lots in the said election.
This matter of unseating will be
entirely in the power of Congress,
and out of that of the Louisiana
authorities. It would be an ex
tremely biting jest upon the Louisi
ana Democrats if, after making, a
constitution to shut out the negro
votes, they should, by disregarding
that constitution, shut out their
own. The party managers would
do well to give this matter the at
tention it deserves and take no un
necessary and unwarranted risks.
Voters who have reached the age
of 60 years and over are exempted
from paying a poll tax as a requisite
for the casting of a ballot.

Southern Treatment for4
Pear Blight.
F..a La COTE AND KIKEFER. PuAs
When a pear orchard is hbadly
blighted, the owner writes to every
body who claims to know anything
on the subject, and everyout. will
write to him to prune, prune, prune,
when really the truth is that the
more he prunes the worse will be
the blight. Wlhen an orchard is bad
ly blight-e1, the thing to do is to
let it alone as completely as possi
ble. Don't prune a limb, don't
plow it. or do anything else to it
that will stimulate the trees. 'he
trees ;re certainly in bad shape
for two years. Let them alone
till tlhe trees miake but a small
growth. Don't cultivate the liud.
'liheu fertilize with phosphoric
acid and potash (no nitrogen.)
Kaiuit aund acid are good forms.
Apply broadcast 300 pounds of
each to the acre; less wdill d. good
ilow it in lightly, say three to
four inches. Lhis shuult be done
in the "inter between December
1 and January 15. It done ea lier
vegetation is too much llt the way.
If done later there will be danger
of caualng the trees to bcom.
In May give the orchard another
cultivation, must advantageously
done with cutaway harrow, plowing
about the same depth as before.
l'he season following give the same
fertilizers and the same plo"ings.
If the trees are rather vigorous
leave off the May plowing.
Slieu 3ou have starved out the
blight, and have got the trees to
where they make but a small growth
annually, which will be just before
you commence the fertilizing and
plowing described above, then is
the time to prune, prune, prune
Dmon't prune with a knife or shears,
but with a saw. Saw off the worst
blighted limbs, the stragglinhug limbs,
the chafsg limbs, and the very tall
limbs; cut them half in two, re
ducing the tree nearly one-half.
Apply kamuit and acid annually,
give the orchard two plowings,
never Plant peas, beggar weeds, or
turn under a heavy crop of any
vegetable growth. Then count
blight a blessing, for you will have
the requirements of pear trees, sup
plied their needs, and recognized
them as perrennials instead of au

Why Not Better Schools?
Editor St. Tammany Paaxna:
St. Tammany boasts - of being
the healthiest spot in the United
States. She boasts of her vast tor
ests of pine, and of her commercial
enterprise. But we regret to say
that she caanot yet boast of her
public schools. Not ijitil lJt sum
mer did the parish show any signs
of progressing educationally, when
a high school was established in
the town of Covington. We were
proud to see this move in the cause
of education, sod earnestly hope
success will crown the effopts of
the people. In the rural districts,
however, there are no signs of
progress. Many people do pot
take the advantage they have of
sending to a public school. ISuch
people are neglecting their duty to
their parish, State and country.
They are robbing their children of
their right and privilege, and are
failing to perform. Irir God-given
duty. We know young men that
have grown up in the lust few years.
that can not read and write. Now,
can such make the highest type of
American citizens9 Their useful
ness will be limited to a small
circle.
The object of an education is to
so train and develop the child into
a noble man or woman, that he
may be able to bear his duties and
responsibilities ably and intelli
gently. A nation can never hope
to be great as long as its people
are ignorant, but as the people be
come more enlightened the nation,
progresses. Should not the citi
zens of the United States use their
opportunities? They ought to try
and make greater opportunities.
Let as wake up and have better and
longer schools all over the parish.
When that is accomplished, St.
Tammany will occupy her proper
place.. Xx.
Rural Free Delivery.
First Assistant Postmaster Gen
eral Heath, in his annual report
on rural free delivery, pub'oishes
reports from two stations in Louisi
ana, where the system has been
given a trial. The postmaster at
Thibodaux, one of the stations al
luded to, highly commends rural
free delivery, and advises that the
people of the parish desire its con
tinuance by all means. There has
been a gratifying increase in the
delivery of both mail and news
papers, and the people have availed
themselves of the anthorisation
given carriers to deliver parcels.
The only drawback to the service
is bad roads. Ernest Roger of the
Greenwood Sugar Factory, La
fourche parish, has a number of
objections to urge against the sys
tem. He says that if these are not
overcome it would be preferable to
re-establish the local postoloe that
was eleald om account of free do
livery. .
