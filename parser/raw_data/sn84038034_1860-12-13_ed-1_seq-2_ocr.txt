such expeditions may never receive countenance

It would be a useless repitition to do more than

earnestly directed to this tubjent fro the fact that

for the service ot the Post Office Department, and
I was then forced to consider the beat remedy for

however, I ascertained that fifteen outct the thirty

TUX CTC3IVK.
In this respect I desrrcto reiterate the recomer.
dati n co. t ined in my last two annual messages,
in favor of : mroi it g specific instead of ad tmlorrm
duties on all imported articles to which these can
be properly applied. From long observation and
experience, I am convinced that specific duties arc
necessary, both to protect the revenue, and to se
cure to our m usafaetartag interests th it amount of
incidental encouragement which univoidib!y re
sults from a revenue tu iff. As an abstract propo
sition it miy bo admitted that a valorem duties
would in theory, be most just and equ.il, bat ir' th -
experience of this and of all other commercial na
tions has ilemonstratel that such duties canstot be
asked and collected without great frauds upon the
revenue, then it i the part of wisdom, to resort to
specific duties.
Ireleed, from the very nature of an
ad rri.'nrrm i:ity this mnst be the resiut under it.
The inevitable consequence is that foreign goods
will be entered at less than their true value. The
Treasury will therefore lose the duty on the differ
ence botw'uiba their real and fietitioin value, and to
this extent wo ar defrauded. The temptation
which a i valtrrm duties present to a dishonest im
porter, -re irresistible. His obct is to p.vss h i
goods throngh the custom house at the very lowest
valuation necessary to save them freniconfiseaMon
in this he very often su'jce is, in sito of l'io vi-

thc circumstances under which Cornelius Vandcr
bilt; on my request, agreed, in month of July last,
to carry the Ocean ami's between the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts. Had he not thus acted, this impor

postages would fall short of an adequate compen

Vanderbilt, in a commendable spirit, was willing
to rely upon the justice of Congress to make u
the deficiency, and I therefore, recommend, that
an appropriation be granted for this purpose.
I should do creat injustice to tho Attorney
General, were I to omit the mention cf his dis
tinguished services in the measures adopted and
prosecuted by him for the defence of the G rem
ment against numenms and unfounded claims to
land in California, purporting to have been made
by the Mexican Government, previous to the trea

The successful opposition to these claims has
saved to the United States public property worth
miny millions of dollars, and to individuals holding
title under them, at least an eiual amount.

forty applicants, according to the Demo

of their own number, and accordingly cast

drew the shortest straw.

Mr. Hale moved to reconsider the vote

a speech attacking it as failing to look the

Mr. Brown said if yon of the North will

Mr. Iverson The States withdrawing

Mr. Wigfall thought the President's

Tho House by 68 against 125, refused
to lay on the table, Mr. Grow's motion to
reconsider the vote by which the Home

thc Union. The nonse then reconsidered
tho vote. The Bill was then brought up
for action.
Mr. Grow said he did not desire to dis
cuss this measure, tho principle involved
having been before tho country for thc past
ten years. This hill, however, avoids the
prominent objections of President Buch
anan's veto mesoage. It docs not propose
to donate lands, but requires payment of 5

Mr. Hawkins, of Fla., asked to be ex
cused from serving on the Committee, ac
companying thc request with the lesson,
which was that he believed the time for
compromise has passed forever.
Mr. John Cochrane, ol New York, said
he had heard with a great deal of regret,
his fiiend asked to be excused from serv
ing on the committee, and went on to speak
at some length in favor of the preservation
of the Union. During its delivery he was
applanded in the galleries.
Mr. Garnet hastily rose, saying I trust,
in our grave del ibcrat ions, the Chair will
stop applause, whelher on ihe floor or in
the galleries. I will give notice here (he
was met with hisses from the galleries.)
I now more that the galleries be cleared.
(Renewed hisses.) Those disgraceful
blackguards who violate tho rules of the
House, and the decorum and dignity which
are due to the Representatives of the peo
ple, should be forthwith expelled from the
House.
The Speaker said ho had no donbt the
suggestions of the gentleman Irom V irgm
ia would ba sufficient for a respectful au
ditory, and insure quiet.
Mr. Cochrane resumed his f-peech and
on its conclusion, Idr, Hawkins demanded
the previous question.
Mr. Millson moved to adjourn, which
carried, 104 to 92. Thc House had pre
viously decided that it should be till Mon
day. Dec. 10. Sknate. On motion of Mr.
Bigler the standing committees of last ses
sion were ordered to be continued.
Mr. Sumner offered a memorial from
Thaddens Hyatt, praying that relief be
nrnr idad for the sufferers in Kansas. Mr.
Sumner cited similar instances and sug-1
gested that thc relief called for be offered
either by an appropriation oand or mo
r. y. Referred to the Committee on Ter
ritories. The Homestead bill passed fts first read
ing. Mr. Powell's resolution on Federal af
fairs was called up. Mr. P. urged prompt
action to save thu Onion. The eleventh
amendment to tho Constitntion was made
in 1794, and in 1803 the lfcth was made.
Our fathers acted in emergencies and so
can we.
Mr. Collamer moved to strike ont pert

reasons why he had asked to be excused
fror serving 01 the Union select Comftaü
tee. Florida is a smstfV fctttf 4rtt nJfm
theless is entitled to all the rights and im
munities of the other States. Sho cannot
be forced to remain in tho Union, and the
Southern States are pledged to defend her
fn the event erf attempted1 coercion. He
was satisfied of unanimity pervading thnjl
State to seek retlress of its grievances in Its
own way and by means other than Con-
gressional compromises, which latter have

In conclusion, he gave fnir warning that
Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
and South Carolina, wore certain to secede,
:nd to he followed by Arkansas, Louisiana
and Texas.
Mr. McClernand remarked that a trou
blesome future opened up before as, but ho
did not believe our government can be dis
solved by tho consent of anyone of its par
ties. There was more strength in thc gov
ernment than w.vi generally believed. He
was amazed that the entire Democracy of
the North should bo excluded from the
committee, but wa3 not willing to excuse
Mr. Hawkins.
Mr. Sherman, from thc committee on
Ways and Means, reported a bill authori

to be completed early in thc spring. Some
idea of the iuiniensc amount of grain whudi
may be ltandlcil in them, may be gathered
from tljc fact that they are to he furnished
with near thirty of Fairbanks' 400 bushel
and 500 bushel Hopper Scales, which are
by tiniveral consent the bot in u-e. nnd
that each of these scales, so perfect will be
111. in Ai-liin.irv ran Jul Inn !t,l tn its full en-
pacity, and the grain discharge-! again from
tho Hopper, in less than ten minuter. In
view of the immense and fertile countrv
hH r .-' i '!'
by numerous railriids having their centre
here, and of onr present an 1 ine.eased facil-
itics for receiving and shipping grain, ami
'
the experience and enterprise of our Lusi
ness men, it is reasonable to expect Chicago
will bo in the future, as now, tho groat
grain market of the world.

-fVasHixoTON, Dec. 10. There
seems to be no donbt that Mr. Cobb
resigned tho Secretaryship of the Treasu
ry. His friends say ho will repair to
Georgia on Thursday, he being a candidate
for member of tho State Convention, te
assemble on the 7th of January. He did
not attend the three last Cabinet meetings.
Secretary Thompson will soon follow
Mr. Cobb. Heenteiel his office to-day,
but did nothing more than look over a
few letters on his table.
t3T The Rnrch case has at last been
decided, the jury bringing in a verdict in
favor of Mrs. Bnrch, tho defendant.
