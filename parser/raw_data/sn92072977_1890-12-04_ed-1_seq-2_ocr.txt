THE REAL PURPOSE
FORCE HILL.
OF THE
Now that it is admitted that the Re
publicans are determined to pass the
Force bill, the question arises: Why ?
On the day after the election, the Chron
icle pointed out the dilemma which con
fronted the Republican party. On the
oue hand they saw that the Force bill
had been repudiated throughout the
whole country, and J hat it wr.s danger
ous to further irriKto ihu ptoplo by the
kind cf leglslati :i ugaiass which they
had protested. On the other hand,
could they hope to control the govern
ment without help from the South?
Many of the Northern States are lost.
If the Republicans, we argued, believe
thatlllinois.New York, Indiana and other
States are lost beyond remedy they will
pass the Force bill; if they believe that
it is a temporary repulse, they
will not feel it necessary to
pass the Force bill. The action of the
Senate shows that the Republicans re
gard their losses in the North as either
permanent or almost so, and they are
seeking to get additional strength in the
South. If so, tbe:r plans will fail. The
Force bill is loaded, and those who fire
it will have cause to say :
"Some gnns there are that so contrive it,
To miss their game whate'er they aim at,
-And whether ctiargtfd for duck or plover,
Fly back and kick their owner over,"
But it is seriously argued by the able
and astute National Democrat that the
Republicans do n t desire to pass the
Forco bill in order to gain strength in the
South, or secure to the negroes in the far
South the "fair ballot" they prate about
so Icudly. The Republican leaders know
perfectly well, says the Democrat, that
if such a law could be passed it c mid
not bo enforced. The Democrat's posi
tion is striking, and is worthy of con
sideration. Its position is:
But it could be used to keep up sectional
bitterness and and to fool the negro
voters of the Northern States into the
belief that ultimately in some States of
the Union South Carolina, Mississippi
and Louisiana the spectacle might b9
again presented of negroes ruling white
men. To keep the negro vote solid for
the Republican party in the Northern
States is the real problem of Lodge,
to be used in pv ing pensions snail dq
derived from a tax levied upon all in
come which exceed $10,000. He has
not yet peifected the details of his bill
which, if passed, would have two good
effects:
1. It would compel the very rich to
contribute their just share to the bur
dens of government. Many of them
grow rich out of the jobs and trades in
cident to the war, and because their in
comes ara largely derived from non
taxable bonds they escape taxation. An
iucome of tax would make them pay in
proportion to their wealth the only just
system of taxation.
2. It would cause a more careful ex
amination into the transactions of the
pension bureau and the wealthy thinkers
of the country would soon expose the
schemes which are now allowed to b3
carried to completion through the greed
of pension agents who are not exposed
by timid Congressmen.
Ia the last session of the House, Hon.
Alfred Rowland, of North Carolina, in
traduced a bill to pat a tax on incomes.
He was on the right line. Year by year
men of lame fortune have found new
ways of escaping taxation, and if legis
1-Uors compel them them to pay their
.hare of the burdens, there will have to
ba newT methods adopted. The income
tax is the best yet presented.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
It is very gratifying to us that the
New York Herald took the same view of
the President's Message that the State
Chronicle tooK. we mate a lew ex
tracts:
From N. Y. Herald:! From State Chroni
cle:
Mr. Harrison's mes- The message is
sage does not risej neither able, judic
above the dull mo-iial nor statesman-
notonvof platitude, like, but is a corn-
It lacks the merit of
either rhetoric or
logic, will be read
from courtesy, but
without interest. As
an exhibit of states
manship it is a seri
ous disappointment,
tor it conveys an im
pression tnat tne
writer has no con
victions or thioks it
impolitic to express
them.
But Mr. Harrison
in the latter part of
his message shows
himself to be the
head of a party rath
er than the Presi
dent of a people. He
reminda Congress
that this is their
short session and
calls upon them to
push certain purely
partisan bills with
vigor and celerity.
The Reapportion
ment and Force bills
must receive imme
diate attention.
These are in the in
terest of the party
and should not be
neglected.
monplace, clear and
plain presentation of
matters or impor
tance and a partisan
plea for the acta or
the Republican par
ty. As we read every
line from the begin
ning, we hoped to
see a cintillation of
greatness s o m e
where in the ponder
ous document, and
hoped that in some
particular he would
rise above the nar
rowness and section
alism of his party
and show himself
worthy to be Presi
dent of the whole
people. But we were
not to be rewarded
by our Bearch. Ihe
further we read, the
greater was our dis
appointment. His
climax is a specious,
unfair, sectional and
partisan argument
for the passage of
the Force bill.
Of this number there are five lawyers in
the Senate and eleven in the House.
We shall make corrections from time to
time, and will thank otlf friends to help
us perfect this list.

SaMisf Jno. H. Ball says a long and pain
ful illness in the spring let her nervous
system completely prostrated: her diges
tion out of order. The use of three bot
tles of Royal Genneteur regulated diges
tion, gave a splendid appetite and gained
ten pounds in flesh.
Mrs. W. F. King: "I had been a great
sufferer from Dyspepsia and Indigestion.
I took Royal Germeteuxand it relieved me
in a short while."

R. Judson Buffaloe: "I have been usinc:

if it would have spasms. We began giving

It is to keep these 1384844 voters solid
for the Republican party that the Force
bill has been framed, and it is to fool
them into the belief that by its passage
and enforcement, tho negro cau rule

the coming session of the Senate in or

The Republican party has ruled the
country ever since the war because it
controlled the negro vote. It means to
continue to rule by that vote even if
civil war should re3ult from the enact

of the Democratic Senators to defeat the

HOW TO DEFEAT THE OBJECTS
OF THE FORCE BILL.
If the Force bill passes it ought not to
take the people of the Southern States
but a few weeks to change the time of
the election of all State and county offi
cers from November to August, and give
to the Legislature in each State the
power to elect the Presidential Electors.
Electors are State officers, and Congress
cannot regulate the method of their elec
tion. This is lawful, and will be neces
sary as a means of self-protection. The
objects of the Force bill must be de
feated at any honorable co3t.
. .
Mb. Blaine has not yet telegraphed to
Mr. Parnell that "trusts" (sacred re
lations that exist between all honorable
men) are private matters with which the
public has nothing to do."
