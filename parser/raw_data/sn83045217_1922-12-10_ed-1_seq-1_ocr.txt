<)
Greeley, Colo., Dec.
Lowe was found guilt
district court here Saturday night of
first degree murder for the death of,
his sister-in-law, Miss Edna Fern
Skinner of LeRoy, Illinois, last July 2.
The verdict was returned at 10:20;"''
o 'clock. The case was given to the jury
at <1:30 o'clock Saturday night.
Lowe had retired for the night and
was sound asleep when a bailiff went
to his cell to summon him to tiie
court room to hear the verdict of the
jury. Judge Bradfield granted the de
fense 30 days in which to file a mo
tion for a new trial.
Judge Bradfield congratulated the
jury on its verdict. He declared they
had brought in a just and fair finding
in the case.
Under the instructions given the jury
by Judge Bradfield the verdict of first
degree murder was the only one which
could be brought in aside from

acquittal.
The penalty for first degree murder
in Colorado, on conviction upon cir
cuinstuncial evidence, is life imprison
ment.
The state charged that Lowe killed
Miss Skinner in the Lowe home with a
»nachine hammer which was found in;
the house shortly after the discovery)
of lier body, and then set fire to the
body and house, after dismantling a
gasoline stove in the kitchen to make
it appear as though it had exploded. |
The state claimed that Lowe hoped |
to collect $2.000 life insurance which
he had sold Miss Skinner and in which
he was named as beneficiary and on
which he had paid the premiums.
The defense pleaded that Miss Skin
ner was killed by the force of an ex
plosion of the gasoiline stove which
she was lighting preparatory to heat
ing water to take a bath and the sub
sequent fire which partially destroyed
the Lowe home.

Welcomed by Cheering

* Philadelphia, Dec. 0.—(By The As
sociated Press.)—Georges Clemenceau,
the grizzled French war premier. Sat
urday ended his formal speaking Mis
sixn to America before the Philadelphia
Forum in the academy of music, with
the bsoad intimation that he believed
he had accomplished all of the three
purposes for which he forsook his cot
tage by the sea in France.
Of two of them, he evinced no doubt.
Ile was confident he had convinced
America that France was not a mili
taristic nor an imperialistic nation.
He was equally sure he had spread
! conviction that France intended to pay
i her war debt to America—not immedi
lately, perhaps, but ultimately. ,
He quoted again a paragraph from I
{President Harding's annual message to
; congress Friday as an indication that
the third point—bringing America back
to the side of France and England
also was being accomplished.
The paragraph was the president's I
comment on the four power pact which j

would find its way toward us. And I

Several times lie was interrupted by

Clemenceau spoke after he had been

Weston told authorities that Stevens
and himself were engaged by U. L.
Kirtley, representing the Black River
Land company, near Vieksburg. to go
to Duckport to get four or five negro
families who were to work on the land
company's plantation.
Accompanied by Si evens and sev
eral others, he rau his boat to a point !
near Duckport. Fifteen or twenty j
white men and negroes were ou the
river Lank.
They hailed the boat and headed for '
the landing, when the men on shore i
opened fire with automatic guns and I
pistols. Weston said.
Stevens had a revolver and returned
the fire, according to the story. A j
second fusillade of shots from the men
on shore brought Stevens and two oth
ers on the barge down. Weston said
he cut the boat loose from the barge
and drifted down with Dangerfield. He !
d the men on shore continued to i
•e at his boat until it was out of '
range. j
Sheriff Andrew Sever and District '
Attorney Jeff Snyder, of Madison par- !
made an investigation of the |
shooting and the latter declared he
would prosecute the men who engaged i
Weston and Sevens for going to Louis- j
iana K.et. labor for trespassing nul!
fur shooting. j
j The district attorney said the men
■ arrived at a place between Delta ami i
Duckport at midnight. They went to j
negro quarters of a plantation and j
: attempted to persuade tlie negroes to
l p!| ve and raised a disturbance. The
I'^Rroes sent word to the planters, and j
' n a short time several planters had j
come upon the scene and asked what !

firing at the plant, and. according to j
the district attorney, the planters re-| by
turned the fire. ;
