USUAL TALK IS ABANDONED
Legislative, Executive and Judicial
Appropriation Bills Are Passed
With Little Debate and Hardly
Any Revision.
WASHINGTON. D. 0, Dec. 11.-
A new record for transaction nf
business was established by the
House of Representatives today.
Legislative, executive and judicial
appropriation bill which usually ex
cites considerable discussion, was
passed with little debate. An un
usual feature was that no member
asked for time to indulgeln a gen
eral talk. The bill carries an appro
priation of $31,335.
The House immediately after con
vening adopted a resolution for the
appointment of a committee of five
to consider the reference to a secret
service in the President's message
and to suggest what action should
be taken in the matter.
Hawley, of Oregon, today Intro
duced a bill authorizing the secre
tary of the interior to place on the
pension "roll under the same terms
granted to officers and soldiers of
other Indian wars the naraea of offi
cers and soldiers of the Bsnneck
War which occurred in Oregon and
Washington in 1878-9.

a climax in the kidnapping of Eddie
Cudahy, made his debut last night as
an evangelist before an audience In
Evanston. The meet was held under
the auspices of the W. C. T. U.
Prison Reform League. Crowe grew
eloquent in a plea to citizens to aid
in prison reform and stop the manu
facture of criminals in reform schools
and penitentiaries.' As he spoke a
baby's voice in the rear of the hall
frequently interrupted him..
"That's my baby making that
noise," Crowe explained. "I hope I
can live to give it a good education
and make of it a good citizen."

CHICAGO, Dec, 11. -Childish
dreams of toys and dolls as well as
pleas for the sick and needy, sent to
Santa Claus through the mails will be
granted if Assistant Postmaster Hub
bard has his way. ,
He made an appeal to the Wash
ington authorities for power to open
Hbout 600 letters to St. Nicholas
which have accumulated within the
last few days and expects au answer
tomorrow.
If this permission is granted it is
his intention to have the missives read

quests are from worthy children,"
said Mr. Hubbard, "I will turn them
over to charitable institutions and
charitably inclined people."

Panama officials made elaborate
plans for protecting the sailors af
ter President O'Baldia made ,'t
known that Panama should avail it
self of an opportunity to demonstrate
its friendship for the United States
is sincere. The alleged order of Pres
ident Roosevelt has dampened the
odor and chances are if the report
true, instead of It warm hospital

same as for the Panama Canal bonds.
The committee then presented to
Vice-President Fairbanks-and Speak
er Cannon, the bond resolution.
Fairbanks expressed a favorable
opinion of the -proposition but Can

suBffestions for more than two hours.
Heburn said he desired it know than
all members invited to the meeting
with the exception of Representative

say they will need but 24 Republi
cans. Three members were present
tonight, Hepburn, Pollard and Ellis,,
will not be members of the next
congress. While several of the in
surgents are for Cannon for Speaker,

desired a change in the rules. None
of those presented stated whether it
was Intended to bring the matter to
an issue in the present session of
congress or to wait until the new
congress.

lying about the floor wounded, one of
the latter a woman. His weapon

LOVER OP ANIMALS.
Remarkable Story From the Lake
City of Interest To AIL
CHICAGO, Dec. ll.-Friends , of
Cy de Vry, head animal keener of
Lincoln Park, fear that he will incur
the displeasure of President Roose
velt as a result of some statements
he made about animals last nitrht.

of the Church of Our Savior, on "In
the Jungle.
J)uring his talk ss he recounted the
almost human traits of "Miss Dolly,"
the celebrated ourang outang who
died some years ago, he betrayed
emotion. The animal keener said
that Miss Dolly was more human in
her actions than many a person he
knows. .
Bnut it was when he told about
snake eating and cow elk eating the
antlers of male elk while the latter
slept that his auditors, nearly all of
them personal friends, sat op end
appeared incredulous.
