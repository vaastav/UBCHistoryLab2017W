IiliSTOIiATION 01' THE SOrTHHliN STATICS,
III my message of the -1th ot Decem
ber, 18115, Congress was informed ot tho
measures whiuli had been instituted by
the Kxeuiive with a view to tin.' gradual
restoration of the States in which the
insurrection occurred to their relations
with the General Government. Provi
sional Governors hud been appointed,
Conventions called, Goeiiiois elected,
j Legislatures assembled, "nnd Senators
'and ltepiis in nines chosen to tho t on

I been opened tor the enforcement f laws

been removed, custom houses re. estab

ini.ii u.iiLiiuuiu iw iiic nairoiai incoilie,
1'ostnl operations had been renewed, -md
efforts were b dug maili' to restore ihem
to iheir former cc million of eflioiuiuiy
The States thein.-elves h d been asked
to take part in I e high function ol
amending the coi.stitution, and of thus
sanctioning the extinction of Alriean
slavery as one of the legkimalo rcsuliu
ol our lnteniecino struggle
Having progressed thus far, tlio Ex
ccutivo Department found that it hud
accomplished nu:uly a'l that was within
lliOHUopu of its iRmst national authoiity.
One thing, however, yet remained lo bo
done betol'H the work ot recotisti notion
could be completed, and that was the
admission to Congress of loyal Senators
and Itepreseniatives Iroiu ihe Stat' h
whoso people had rebelled apamst the
lawful authority of tho General Govern
ment. This question devolved upon the
respective Houses, which, by the -Constitution,
are mado tho judges ot the
election, returns, and qualitioatioi'.s ot
their own menibors; and its considera
tion ot once engaged the attention ot
Congress.
lu the meantime, the Executive. De
partment no other plan having been
proposed bv Congress continued il
effort!) to perfect, as tar as was practi.
cable, the restoration of the proper re
lations : etween tho citizens ot llio re
spective States, the Slates, and the Fed
end Government, extending frc.-m time
to time, ns the public, interests seems to
require the judicial, revenue, ard postal
system ot the country. With the ad
vice and consent of the Senate, tho ne
cessary officers were appointed, nnd ap
propriations Hindu by Congress for the
pay.ientof their salaries. The propo.
sition to.umend the Federal Constitution,
so us to prevent the existence ot slavery
within tho United Males or any pl.ieo
subject to their jurisdiction, was ralilied
by the requisite number ot state1 ; and
on the lbth day of December, 1BG.", it
was officially declare.! to have become
did as a part of llio Constitution ot
the United States All ot tho Stales in
which tho insurrection had existed
promptly amended their Constitut oni
s as to make Ihi m conform to
the great change- thus atl'ected m
tho organic law of the land ; declared
null and void all ordinances and laws id'
secession ; repudiated all pretended debts
and obligations created for the revolu
tionary purpo-ics ot tho insurrection i
and proceeded, in good faith, to the en
actment ot measures tortho protection
and amelioration ot the condition ot the
colored race. Congress, however, yet
hesit. led to admit any of these States to
representation i and U was not unlil to-
wards mo eiosc oi mu eigmii inouiii oi
, ., i -i.i... .; i. . i i. z
tho session that an exception was made
in favor ot Tennessee, by tlie ndmission
of bur Senators and Representatives.
""'" " ! "
I deem it a subject of.profound regret
that Congress , has thus tar failed to ad -
mil to seats loyal Senators an. I Kepro-
sentalive from the other states whoso
inhabitants . toiruther, wiih those
nt Tennessee, had engaged in rebellion.
Ten Stales, mote than one fourth ot the
eulire number, remain without represent . and the permanency ot our torm of Uuv.

Coiiaress to accept their credentials.
l'lietr adimsKioii, it is believed, would
havo accomplished much toward llio
rencA'til and strengthening of oty rela
tions as one people, and removed serious
cause for discontent ou tho part ot the
people of '.hose states. It would havo
accorded with the great principle enun
ciated: in tho (leehiriilion id' American
Independence, that no people ought
to bear tho burden of taxation and
yet be denied the right of representation.
ItVouId hivo been in consonance with
the express provisions of llio Constitu
tion that each Stuto shall l ave nt least
one representative, and that no Statu
without its consent shall bo deprived id'
equal eutlVago in tho Semite These
provisions were intended to secure to
ever)' Stale t,:o right of representation
in Congress, and so important was it
deemed by the t'rninoM ot the constitu
tion that the equality of tho States shall
bo preserved in the Semite; that not even
by an amendment of the constitution can
any State without its consent be denied
avoiioinlhat branch ot the National
legl-latttre. It has been assumed Unit
these Slates, by rebellion, became ter
ritories; but till departments of the Gov
ernment, wi ll great distinctness, refus
ed to sancli' ti an a-'sninpliou so incom
patible tvitli tho nature of our Kepub
lieau system ai.d tho professed objects
ef the war '1 hroughoiit tho recent
legislation of Congress, thu undeniable
fact makes itself apparent that these ten
political communities are nothing less
than States of this Union. At tho very
commencement of iho rebellion, each
house declared with tin unanimity ns re
markable as it was sigmlicant, that the
svar was not 'waged, up,.ii o r part, in
any tqiiril of oppression, nor for any
purpose ot conquest or subjugation, nor
purposu of o,ei throwing or interfering
with tlie rights or established institutions
ot those S nes, but to ileKnid aud main
tain thu supremacy of the Con-tii lilion
and all laws made in i-ui'suaiice thereof,
and to preserve thu Union with nil thu
dignity, equality, and rights of the soy
oral Mates unimpaired ; and Hint as soon
as the-e objects were arcomplisl.e 1
tho war ought to ceasu." In some in
stances, Senators were permitted to con
tinue their legislative function, while
in ,tlu-i' i i.Miiiiu.c-a Ki-,i L-Hi'jilul u ch wero
elected and admitlcd lo souls iifu.-i- their
States had t rinally declared their rights
lo withdraw ti'Mii the Union, and were
endeavoring to maintain that right by
force ot arms. All ot iho Sta'cs whose
people iv i re in insurrection, ns Stales,
were included in the apportionment ot
the direct lax of twenty millions ut dol
lars annually laid upon tho United Stales
by ' hu Act approved oth August. 18GI
Congress, by the Act of March 5. 18ii2,
and by the ai poinlinent ot repiescnta-
ilon thereunder, also recognized their
presence as States in the Union ; and
they have,, for judicial purposes, been di
vi led into distifcts, ns States alone can
bo divided. Thu sa.ne recognition ap
pears in tho recent legislation in refer,
once to Tennessee, which evidently rests
upon the lact that thu functions ot thu
Statis were not destroyed by the rebel
lion, but mere y suspended ; and that
principle is of course applicable to Chose
State which, like Tennessee, attempted
to renounce'their place in the Union.
Tho action ot the Executive depart
ment of the Government upon this sub
ject has been equally definite and uniform
ami the purpose of tho war was ppeci
lieally stated in the I'roclaniali in issued
by my predecessor ou tho 22d day of
September, 1 8ti-2 It v. ns then Kohuni
ly proclaimed and declared that "here-utter,-
ns heretofore, tho war will be
pro-ecuted tor the o'ject of practica'ly
res'.oiing the constitutional relations be
tween the United Slates and each o! the
States aud the people thereof, in which
Slates that relation is or may bo sus
pended or disturbed."
Thi! recognition ot tho Stales by the
Judicial Department of the Governiicnt
has also been clear and conclusive in all
proceedings iiflecling them ns Status,
had in thu S promo, Circuit and District

ou tlie contrary th ir correctness has

If the admission of loyal members to

it is not less wiso and expedient now.
It tins) anomalous condition is right ; if

Tho Constitution makes it tho duly
ot the 1'iesideiil lo recommend to llio
consideration id' Congress such meas
ures as ho shall dot in expedient. I
know (d no measure, more imperatively
demanded by every consideration ot
national interest, sound policy aud eipial
justice, than the admission ol loyal
menibors from thu unrepresented Stales.
This would eonsutnuio the work of
restoration, and exert a most salutary m
llilence in life reestab ishment of peilco.
lii!tT..ony and fraternal feeling It woi.l.l
lend greatly to renew tho confidence of

the inherent nrd recuperative power of
a Government lounded upon the will of
the people, and established upon the
prim iplus of liberty, justice and intelli-.
gtnee. Oar iuciea-ed strei.gth and en
hanced p'rosp illy would irrcfnigibly
demonstrate the fallacy ol ihe iitguinents
against free institutions drawn from our
recent national disotders by Ihe enemies
of republican goveinnunl. The ad
mission of loyal members from the St tea
now excluded from Congress, by a'lay
lttg deiibi and apprehension, would turn
capital, now awaiting an opportunity for
investment, into thu channel ot trade
and industry. It would alleviate the
pteseiit troubled condition of those
States, and, by inducing emigration, aid
in the settlement of t.-rlilu regions now

In our efforts to preserve Mho unity

to bring legislation within the bouii

and to return to the ancient landmarks

Thu rep' i t presents a much moro at

one year ago the most sanguine could
have anticipated During thu fiscal
year ending the 3nih ol June, 18(15, tlie
last year id ihe war, I he public debt was
increased 0 1 1 ,!)02,"37, and on the Slst
ol October, l8(io, it amounted to $2, .

5,"i 1, 3 1 ll,()00, llio diminution, during a
period of f .iii teen months, commencing
September 1st, 18(15, and ending Octo
ber 31st, 157(1. having been S2.)U,07!),
505. In thu last am ual report on iho
state ol tho finances, it was estimated
that during tho three duarters ot tlie
fiscal y. nr ending the 3dth ot June last,
tho debt would bo increased Si 12,1 01,
917. D ring that period, however, it
was rod need S'51,l'Jii.387, tho receipts
of tho year having been !j8!),!)U5, 1)1)5

During the lisnal year ending the 30th

For the li-eal year ending Juno 3d, 1808,
it is estimated that the receipts, will

expenditures will bu !?350 217,1141
snowing an excess ot 85,75.350 in ta

after all necessary reductions shall havo
been male, llio revenuo of tho present

sufficient to cover all legitimate charges
upon iho Treasury, nnd leave a larco

stem now to bo no good reason why
