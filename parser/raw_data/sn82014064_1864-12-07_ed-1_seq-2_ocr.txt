WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 7, 1861.
THE NAVY EEPOBT.
The report ol the Secretary of tbe Navy,
the material portion of which we arc enabled
to print this morning, is a document of great
public interest. Being tbe concluding report
of the four years Executive term, Hr. Welles
has given a resume of the operations of his
Department, which enables the people to
measure the success or failure of bis efforts
by the means placed at Ms disposal, and by
the amount ol work required at Ms hands.
We think it must be admitted by
candid men that the building up
of the American navy to its pres
ent standard of 671 vessels, mount
ing 4,610 guns, of an aggregate burthen of
•610,396 tons, upon on average expenditure of
$72,000,000 of currency per annum for all the
disbursements of the Department, has been a
very great achievement, not suffering by com
parison with every other work that the Gov
ernment and people have set their hands to
since the beginning of the war. We have ex
pressed, as we believe the public have felt,
some impatience at the failures of the block
ade at Wilmington. The Secretary sets forth
the reasons why the blockade has not proved
so •fflclcnt as could be desired at that point,
and we commend our readers to give
them a careful perusal. Sixty-seven
steamers, we are informed, have been cap
tured or destroyed while seeking to enter or
deport from that port, wMch is now the only
point on the Atlantic coast not effectually
scaled up. The amount of prize money dis
tributed since tbe beginning of the war is
about sl4,ooo,ooo—the portion coming to the
Government being invested in interest-bear
ing securities, and furnishing an income more
than sufficient to meet all demands on the
jiavfcl pension fund. Mr. Welles refers to the
capture of the Florida and her subsequent
loss in Hampton Beads, without comment,
leaving the question of tbe right or wrong
of the business to be discussed and adjusted
elsewhere. He urges the erection of the rank
Of Vi&i-Admirdl as •. reward for the
services of Admiral Farragut, In which recom
mendation we join. He closes with a heart
felt tribute to the officers and seamen of the
navy for their valor and devotion in the ser
vice of their country. The report is well
written, and the subjects treated are of uni
versal interest. We trust no one will be de
terred from reading It by reason of Its length.
THE CIVILIZATION OF EXGL&ND.
We print elsewhere tbe shocking details of
the execution of Muller, at London, and the
still more fearful scenes tii at transpired about
the scaffold on that occasion. With the per
ticnlars of tbe murder, the flight of the doom
ed man, liis capture at New York, hi* trans
portation to England, and his trial, our read,
ers are familiar. Be wgs sentenced to be ex- ;
ccntcd on Monday, Nov. 15, at Newgate. All
Sunday night the gin houses In the vicinity
swarmed with the scum of London, and thou
sands of people gathered to witness the sub
lime moral spectacle, and resolutely held tbeir
places in spite of the tailing rain, that they
might hare an advantageous position. Dawn
broke npon a motley crowd. Onehundred
thousand old men, lads, women, cbildrenand
infants, gathered together to see a fellow
being launched into eternity; black
guards of tender years; thieves and their
mistresses; dandies with cane and cigar;
sleek familiar family parties with ‘their lun
cheon -, tradesmen, noblemen and membtrs of
Parliament; pickpockets, street walkers,
gorroters and prize fighters; preachers, peers,
mechanics and gentlemen: brawling prosti
tutes, mothers of families, sewing girls, girls
and babies all edified alike, all exhibiting
that bidden, morbid lust for blood which is
one of the most frightful phases of poor hu
man nature and all revelling in Ahe moral
debauchery of the gallows that is more ex
clting than wine, more terrible than the
•gaming table.
This was the crowd, and how did they spend
their time until the hangman claimed
Ms victim ? Women and girls swilling
beer and filling the air with ribaldry and
obscene ballads; pickpockets rifling trades
men of their money; hundreds of men gar
roted and robbed in the open daylight;
thieves and courtezans plying their vocations
with utter impunity; bullies and prize-fight
ers pummeling each other to jellies for the
edification of women and children; preachers
distributing tracts, and ballad-mongers filthy
songs, side by side ; noblemen and gentlemen
exulting over the pleasures of the people;
drunkenness, obscenity, blasphemy, robbery,
pugilism, g&rrotings,—these were the sports
of the English people until the hour when
the solemn bell announced that the victim
was to undergo the sentenceof-deaih. He is
led out, and there is a momentary silence in
the crowd. A clergyman is at his side, and in
a scries of cross-questions which would bet
ter have befitted a Tombs lawyer, evokes a
dubious confession of gnilt from him. The
wretched man has not finished his statement,
but the hangman and the crowd
arc In haste, and he is driven into eternity
before the clergyman can catch his conclud
ing words. The clergyman hurries off. His
work is ended. The hangman, his ghastly
office concluded, slinks away amid hisses and
jeers and obscene questions, and there is
nothing left but the black frame and the
corpse and the crowd. They have gratified
their brutal curiosity with the brutal sight;
and the rioting, the fighting, the gambling,
the garroting, the blaspheming, the drinking,
and all the horrible debauchery of the fiend
ish crew commence anew.
Wc are not writing of the days of PLilip of
Burgundy, when such crowds gathered to see
beggars lashed at cart-tails by hangmen,
women drowned in the Seine, and
men broken at the wheel, for steal
ing; nor of the days of Robespierre,
when let ettoyennes and their dames flockcd'To
see the blood flow from the guillotine, bat of
a great moral feast set forth by the English
Government for its people! a day’s sport for
the constituents of My Lord Mayor of Lon
don! a sublime 'spectacle for women and
babes 1 This was in London, the metropolis
of the world, the vaunted center of commerce,
learning, morality and religion, tbo focus of
the world’s civilization—not in Dahomey,
Where the King may slaughter so many
year, nor in China, where rebels
arc tom to pieces with wire brushes. They
arc barbarians, and but little better could be
expected of them. It was England, the mis
tress of civilization, that can rival China and
Dahomey, that permits such spectacles,whose
noblemen aad working men crowd to bang
ings, cock fights, dog fights, and prize fights.
The nation that can suffer such spectacles as
the hanging of Muller Is eminently capable Of
siding with rebels and traitors to free govern,
meut, and should hereafter keep at least a
respectful silence when civilization is con*
cemcd. .
ss7* In speaking of the project of arm
ing the slaves at the South, tbe London
Svncs innocently remarks; “The South has
no reason to doubt that the negro will fight
just as bravely in support of the cause of
• slavery, vdileh is tl*e cause of his master, a* he
wai in the cause of liberty.” And It adds of
; its particular friends tbe rebels: “The man
who would submit without a mnrmertothe
<: impressment of his horses or Ms crops, may
very -likely shrink back with a species of
' superstitious horror from the attempt of bis
own Government (at Richmond) to deprive .
him ofwose very slates for i chum 7te has already
foufffdc long aud desperate iccr.”
The Time* confesses that this insurrection
is an effort to save slavery; and tbe paper
whose asserted pride it is to defend “Mrplay 1 ’
—the representative of the aristocratic gov
erning class of England—deliberately sup
ports as a manly assertion of an undoubted
right the armed effort of a body of men to
overthrow a Government, which they do not
pretend has ever wronged them, merely Tor
the sake of preserving slavery. Docs any

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
ftUow-tUtzcns of the Stnaie and Route of Itepre
tentative*:
Again the blessings of health and abundant
harvests claim bur profoundcst gratitude to
Almighty God. , _, .
The condltloH of our foreign affidrs i* rea
sonably satis&ctoiy.
Un tnoys with Mexico.
Mexico continues to be tbe theatre of civil
vex. While our political relations with that
country have undergone no change, wo hare
at the same time strictly maintained neu
trality between the belligerents.
THE JNTEB-OCXAKIG TRANSIT ROUTE,
At the request of the States of Costa Bica
and Nicaragua, a competent engineer has
been authorized to make a survey of tbe river
Ban Juan and the port of San Juan. It is a
source of much satisfaction that the difficul
ties which for a moment excited some politi
cal apprehensions, and caused a losing of the
inter-oceanic transit route, have been amica
bly adjusted, and that there is a good pros
pect that the route wQI. soon be re-opened,
with an increase of capacity and adaptation.
W r c could not exaggerate either the commer
cial or the political importance of that great
improvement.
RELATIONS WITH THE UNTIED STATES OP CO
LUMBIA.
It would be dolug injustice to an important
South American Slate, not to acknowledge
tbe directness, frankness and cordiality with
which the United States of Columbia have
entered into Intimate relations with this Gov
ernment. A Claims Convention has been
constituted to comple the unfinished work of
the one which closed its session in 1861. The
new liberal Constitution ofVenezuela having
gone into effect with the universal acquies
cence of the people, the Government under it
has been recognized, and diplomatic inter-'
course with it has been opened in a cordial
and friendly spirit The long deferred Avis
Island claim has been satisfactorily paid and
discharged. Mutual payments have been
made in the'claims awarded by the late joint
commission for the settlement of claims be
tween the United States and Benz. An earn
est and cordial friendship continues to exist
between the two countries, and such efforts
as were in my power have been used to re
move misunderstanding and avert a threaten
ed war between Peru and Spain.
RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AMERICAN STATES.
Our relations are of the most friendly na
ture with Chili, the Argentine Republic, Boli
via, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Son Salvador and
HaytL During the jiast year no differences
of any kind have arisen with any of those
Republic*, and, on the other hand their sym
pathies with the United States arc constantly
expressed.
The claim arising from the seizure of the
cargo of the brig Macedonian in IS3I has been
paid in full by tne Government of Chill
Civil war continues In the Spanish port of
San Domingo, apparently without a prospect
of an early clo*c.
PROGRESS OP LIBERIA.
Official correspondence has been freely
opened with Liberia, add it gives ns a pleas
ing view of the social and political progress
in that Republic. It may be expected to de
rive new vigor from American influence, im
proved by the rapid disappearance of slavery
m the Uuitcd States. 1 solicit your authori
ty to famish the Republic a gunboat at a mod
erate cost, to be reimbursed to the United
States by installments. Such a vessel is
needed for the safety of that Slate against
the native African race, and inLiberianuands
it would be more effective in arresting the
African slave trade then a squadron in our
own hands. The possession of the least or
ganized naval force would stimulate a gene
rous ambition in the Republic, and the confi
dence which we should manifest by furnishing
it, would win forbearance and favor toward*
the colony from all civilized nations.
THE OVERLAND TELEGRAPH.
The proposed overland telegraph between
America and the way of Behring
Straits and Arctic Russia, which was sanc
tioned by Congress at the last session, has
been undertaken under .very favorable cir
cumstances by an association of American
citizens, with the cordial good will and sup
port, as well of this Government as of those
of Great Britain and Russia. Assur
ances have been received from most of the
South American States of their high appre
ciation of the enterprise, and their readiness
to co-operate in constructing line* to that
world-encircling communication.
I learn with much eatiiiaciion that the no
ble design ei a telegraphic Communication
between the eastern coast of America and
Great Britain has been renewed, with full ux
pectation of its early accomplishment. Thus
it is hoped that, with the return of domestic
peace, tbe country will be able to resume
with energy and advantage her former high
career ol commerce and civilization.
EGYPTIAN ATT AIRS.
Our very popular and estimable represen
tative in Egypt died in April lost. An un
- pleasant altercation which arose between the
temporary incumbent of the office and the
Government of the Pacha, resulted in a sus
pension of Intercourse. This was promptly
corrected on the arrival of the successor of
• the Consulate, purrelatlons with Egvpt, as
well as our relations with the Barbary Power*
arc entirely satisfactory.
CHINA.
The rebellion which has so long been in
progress in China has at last been suppressed
■with tbe co-operating good offices of this
Government and of the other foreign com
mercial States. The judicial consular estab
lishment Las become very difficult and oner
ous, and it will need legislative regulation to
adapt it to tbe extension of our commerce
and to tbe more intimate intercourse which
Las been instituted with the Government and
people of that vn#t Empire. China seem* to
bcaccepting with hearty good will the con
ventional laws vhich regulate commerce and
social intercourse among the Western na
tions. ..
RELATION- WITH JAPAN.
Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan
and the anomalous form of its Government,
the adtion of that Empire in performing treaty
stipulations is inconsistent and capricious.
Nevertheless, good progress has been effected
by the Western powers, moving with enlight
ened concert. Our own pecuniary claims
have been allowed, or pnt in coarse of settle
ment, and the inland sea ha* been reopened
to commerce. There is reason also to believe
that these proceedings have increased rather
than diminished the friendship of Japan to
ward the United Slates.
Opening rebel ports.
The’porta of Norfolk, Fcmondlna and PeU J
sacola nave been opened by proclamation. It
is hoped that foreign merchants will now con
sider whether it i* not more safe or profitable
to themselves, os well as just to the United
State*, to resort to these and other open ports
than it is to pursue, through many hazards
and at a vast cost, a contraband trade with
other ports which are closed.
LEGISLATION AGAINST SLATS TRADERS.
Por myself, I have no doubt of the power
and duty of the Executive, under the law of
nations, to exclude enemies of the human
race from an asylum In the United States. If
Congress should think that proceedings in
such cases lack the authority of law, or ought
to be further repudiated by it, I recommend
that provision be made for effectually pre
venting foreign slave-traders from acquiring
domicil and facilities for their criminal occu
pation in our country.
RECOGNITION OP SOUTHERN PIRACT.
It is possible that if it were a new and an
open question, the maritime powers, with the
light they now enjoy, would not concede the
privileges of a naval belligerent to the insur
gents of the United States, destitute as they
arc, and always have been, equally of ships
and of ports and harbors. Disloyal emissa
ries have been neither less assiduous normore
successful during the lost year than they were
before that time in their efforts, under favor
of that privilege, to embroil our country in
foreign wars. Nevertheless, unforeseen polit
ical difficulties have arisen, especially in Bra
zilian end British ports, and on the northern
boundary of the United States, which Lave
required, and arclikclyto continue to require,
tLc practice of,constant vigilance and a just
end conciliatory spirit on the part of the
United States, as well as of the nations con
cerned, and their Governments.
adjustment or CLAIMS.
Commissioners have been appointed under
the treaty with Great Britain on the adjusts
incnt of the of the Hudson Bay and
Puget’s Bound Agricultural Companies In
Oregon, and are now proceeding to the exe
cution of the trust assigned to them.
TUB CANADIAN RAIDS,
In view of the insecurity-of life in the re
gion adjacent to the Canadian border, by
recent assaults and depredations committed
by inimical 1 and desperate persons, who are
harbored there, it has been thought proper to
give notice that after the expiration ol six
months, the period conditionally stipulated
in the existing arrangements with Great Brit
ain, tbe United States must bold themselves
at liberty to increase their naval armament
upon the Lakes, if they shall find that pro
ceeding necessary. The condition of the bor
der will necessarily come into consideration
In connection with the question of continuing
or modifying the rights of transit from Can
ada through the United States, as well as the
regulation of exports, which were tempora
rily established by the reciprocity treaty of
the sth of June, 1854. 1 desire, however, to
be understood, while making this statement,
that tlm colonial authorities are not deemed
to be intentionally unjust .or unfriendly
■ towards the United States, but, on the con
trary, there Is every reason to expect that,
with the approval of the Imperial Govern-'
ment, they will take the necessary measures
to prevent new incursions across the border,
EMIGRATION.
The act passed at the last session for the
1 encouragement of emigration has, as far as
was possible, been put into operation. It
•cans to need amendment, which will enable
; tbe officers of tbe Government to prevent the
practice of frauds against the emigrants while
on their way and on their arrival m tbe ports,
so as to show them here a lair choice of avo
cations and place of settlement. A liberal
, disposition towards this great national policy
; is manifested by most of the European States,
» and ought to be reciprocated on our partly
giving the emigrants effective national pro
tection. I regard our emigrants as one of-thc
principal replenishing streams which are ap
pointed by Providence to repair the ravage*
of Internal war and iU wastes of national
strength and health. All that is necessary is
to secure the flow of that stream in its pres
ent fullness, and to that cud the Government
must In cvciy way make it manifest that it
neither needs nor designs to impose involun
tary military service upon those who corn*
from other lands to cast their lot in oar coun
try.
The financial afihirsof the Government hive
been successfully administered during the
last year. The legislation of the last session
of Congress has beneficially affected the reve
nue, although sufficient time has not yet
elapsed lo experience the full effects of seve
ral of the provisions of the acts of Congress
imposing increased taxation. The receipts
duting the year from all sources upon the na
sis of warrants signed by the Secretary of the
Treasury, including loans and the balance in
the Treasury on the Ist day of- July, ,TS33,
82,871
verts $139,479,000,763, and the aggregate dis
bursements upon the same basis were $123,-
805,810,169,1eaving a balance in the Treasury,
as shown by warrants, of $0,673,990,573. De
duct from these the amount of the principal
of the public debt redeemed and the amount
of issue in subs itution therefor, and the ac
tual operations of the Treasury were:
receipts, $884,076,(540.77; disbursements,
$865,234,037 86, which leaves a cash balance
in. the Treasury of $18,842,558.71. Of the re
ceipts there were derived from customs, $102,-
316,152.99; from lands, $588,833.39; from di
rect taxes, $47.564.896; from Internal reve
nue, $109,7-0,184.10; from miscellaneous
sources, $4,751,141,810: and from loans ap
plied to actual expenditures, including for
mer balance, $623,443,939.13. There were
disbursed for the civil* service, $37,505,599.46;
for pensions and Indians, $7,517,930.97; for
the War Department, $60,791,813.97; for the
Navy Department, $85,733,293.70; for interest
of the public debt, $53,685,42L69-—making an
aggregate of $865,234,087.86, and leaving a
balance in the Treasury of $18,843,558,71, as
before stated.
For the actual receipts and disbursements
for Die first quarter, and the estimated re
ceipts and disbursements for the three re
maining quarters of tbe current, fiscal year,
and the general operations of the Treasury in
detail, I referyou to the report of the Secre
tary of the Treasury. I concur with him in
the opinion that the proportion of the mo
neys required to meet tbe expenses conse
quent npon the war derived from taxation
should be still further increased, and I ear
nestly invite your attention to this subject,
to the end that there may bo such additional
legislation as shall be required to meet the
just expectations of the Secretary.
THE PUBLIC DEBT.
The public debt on tbo first day of Jnly
last, as appears by the hooks of the Treasury,
amounted to $1,749,690,439.49. Probably,
should the war continue for another year,
that amount may be Increased by not far from
$500,000,000. Held, as it is. for themostpart,
by our own people, it has become a substan
tial branch, of National though private pro
perty. For obvious reasons, iho more nearly
tMs property can be distributed all the peo
ple, the better. To favor such a general dis
tribution, greater inducements to become
owners might, perhaps, with good effect and
without injury be presented to persons of
limited means. With tins view 1 suggest
whether it might not be both expedient and
competent fur Congress to provide that
a limited amount of some future Issues of
public securities might be held by any bona
jlde purchaser exempt from taxation, from
seizure for debt, under such restrictions and
limitations as might be necessary to guard
against abuse of so important a privilege.
Ibis would enable prudent persons to set
aside a small annuity against a possible day of
want. Privileges like these would render
the possession of such securities, to tbo
amount limited, most desirable to every per
son of small mcanswho might bo able to save
enough for the purpose. Thegrcatadvaniage
of citizens being creditors as well as debtors,
with relation to the public debt, is obvious.
Hen readily perceive that they cannot be
much oppressed by a debt wMch they owo
themselves.
The public debt, on Ibo Ist day of July
last, although somewhat exceeding the es
timates of the Secretary of the Treasury,
made to Congress at the commencement of
last session, lulls short of the estimate of that
olhcer made In the preceding December, as to
its probable amount at the oeglnnlngof this
year, by the sum of $3,995,019.83. This fact
exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct
of the operations of the Treasury.
THE NATIONAL BONK SYSTEM 1 .
The Rational Banking system is proving to
be acceptable to capitalists and to the people.
On the 25ih of November; five hundred and
eighty-four National Banks had been organ
ized, a considerable number of wbicb were
conversions from State Banks. Chaugesfrom
the State system to the National system are
rapidly taking place, and it Is hoped that very
soon there will be in the United States no
hank of issue not authorized by Congress,
and no honk note circulation not secured by
the Government. That the Government and
the people will derive general benefit from
this change in the banking systems of the
country, can hardly he questioned. The Na
tional system will create a reliable and per
manent'influence in support of the national
credit, and protect the people against losses
In the use of paper money. Whether ormot
any further legislation is advisable for the
suppression of the State Bank Issues, It will
he tor Congress to determine. It seams quite
clear that the Treasury cannot be satisfactorily
conducted unless the Government can exer
cise a restraining power over the bank note
circulation of the country.
THE WAR DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of War and the
accompanying documents, will detail the
campaigns of the armies in the field since the
date of the last annual message, and also the
operations of the several administrative
bureaus of the War Department during the
lost year. It will also specify the measures
deemed essential for the national defense, and
to keep up and to supply the requisite mili
tary force.
THENATT.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
presents a comprehensive and satisfactory
exhibit of the afialrs of that Department, and
of the naval service. It is a subject of con
gratulation and laudable pride to our country
men, that a Navy oi such vast proportions
hoe been organized in so brief a period, ana
conducted with so much efficiency and suc
cess. The general exhibit of the ‘Navy, in
cluding vessels under construction on the
first of December, ISO 4, shows a total of 071
vessels, carrying 4,010 guns, and 510,390 tons,'
being an actual increase during the year, over
and above all losses, by shipwreck or in bat
tle, of 8S vessels, IC7 gnns. and 42,427 tons.
The total number of men at this time In the
naval service, including officers, is
about 51,000. There have been cap
•tured by the navy during the
year 324 vessels, and the whole number of
iiaval captures since hostilities commenced is
1,300, of which 207 are steamers. The gross
proceeds arising trom the sale of condemned
prize property, thus far reported, amounts to
$14,3%,200 51. A large amount of such pj o
cccds is still under adjudication and yet to be
reported- The total expenditures of thi
Nvy Department, of every description, in
cluding the cost of the immense squadrons
that have been called into existence from the
4th of March, 1801. to the Ist of November,
1804, arc $233,047,202.35. Tourfavorable con
sideration is invited to the various recom
mendations of the Secretary of the Navy, cs
.pocially in regard to a navy yard and a suit
able establishment for the construction and
ycpalr Of aO® vessels and the machinery and
armature for 6Hr fhips, to which reference
was male in inylast annual jn e '* s P£f« Your
attention is also invited to the views ex-
Srcsscd in the report in relation to the Icgis
ition of Congress at the last session in re
spect to prizes in our inland waters. I cor
dially concur in the recommendation of the
Secretary as to the propriety of creating the
new rank ofTiceAdmhal in our naval service.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
Tour attention is invited to the report or
the Postmaster General for a detailed account
of the operations and financial condition of the.
Post Office Department. The postal revenues
for the year ending June 30th, 18G1, amounted
to $12,438,253.78, and the expenditures to
$12,044,76020. The excess or expenditures
over receipts being' 5206,052.42. The views
presented by the Postmaster General on the
subject of special grants by the Government
in old of the‘.establishment of new lines of
ocean mall steamships, and the policy he re
commends for the development of increased
commercial intercourse with adjacent and
neighboring countries, should receive the.
careful consideration of Congress.
THE NEW STATE.
It is of noteworthy interest that the steady
expansion of population, improvement in
Governmental institutions over the new and
-unoccupied portions of our country have
scarcely been checked, mnch less impeded or
destroyed by our great civil war, which at
first glance would seem to have absorbed al
most’the entire energies of the nation.
The organization and admission of the State
of Nevada has been completed, in conformity
with the laws, and thus onr excellent system
is firmly established in the mountains which
once seemed a barren and uninhabited waste,
between the Atlantic Slates and those which
have grown up on the coast of the Pacific
Ocean.
THE TERRITORIES.
The Territories of the United States are
generally in a condition of prosperity and
rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason
of their great distance and the interception
of communication with them by Indian hos
tilities, have been only partially organized,
but it js understood that these difficulties are
about to disappear, which will permit their
Governments, like those of others, to go into
speedy and full operation.
DEPARTMENT OP THE INTERIOR.
As intimately connected ■with and promo
tire of this material grown of the nation, I
ask the attention of Congress to the valuable
information and important recommendations
relating to the public lands, Indian affairs, the
Pacific Kailroao, and mineral discoveries con
tained in the report of the Secretary of the
Interior, which Is herewith transmitted, and
which report also embraces the .subjects of
patents, pensions, and other topics of public
interest pertaining to his Department.
Ihe quantity of public land disposed of
during thefive quarters ending on the 80th of
September last, was 4,221,842 acres, of which
1,538,614 acres were entered under the Home
stead law. The remainder was located with
military warrants and agricultural scrip certi
fied to States forrailroads and sold for cash.
The receipts from sales and location fees
were $1.019,446. Theincomefromsalcaduring
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1861, was
$67,800,721, against $63,607,705 receipts dur
ing the proceeding year. The aggregate of
acres surveyed during the year has been equal
to the quantity disposed of, and there Is open
to settlement about 133,000,000 acres of sur
veyed land.
PACIFIC RAILROAD.
The great enterprise of connecting the At
lantic with the Pacific by railroad and tele
graph.lines bos been entered upon-with a
vigor that gives assurance of success. Not
withstanding the embarrassments arising
from the prevailing high prices of materials
and labor, the route of the mam line of the
road has been definitely located for 100 miles
westward from, the Initial point at Omaha
City, Nebraska, and a preliminary location of
the’ Pacific Railroad of California has been
made from Sacramento eastward to the great
bend of Mucker river in Nevada.
'HINES.
Numerous discoveries of gold, silver and
clnlbar mines have been added to the many
heretofore known, and the country occupied
by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains
end the subordinate ranges now teem with
enterprising labor, which is richly remunerat
ive. It is believed that the products of the
mines of precious metals in that region has,
during the year,- reached, if not exceeded
$100,000,000 in value.
XKHIAX SYSTEM.
It was recommended in my last annual mes
sage that our Indian system bo remodeled.
Congress, at Its last session, acting on the re
commendation, did provide for reorganizing
the system in California, aad.it U believed
that under the present organization the man
agement of the Indians there will be attended
with reasonable success. Much jet remains
to be done to provide for the proper govern
ment of the Indians in other parts of the
country, to render it secure for the advancing
settler, and to provide for the welfare of the
Indian. The Secretary reiterates his recom
mendations, and to them the attention of
Congress is invited.
PENSIONS.
The liberal provisions to the invalid sol
diers and sailors of the Republic, and to the
widows, orphans, and dependent mothers of
those who nave fallen in battle or died of dis
ease contracted or of wounds received in the
service of their country, hare been diligently
administered. There have been admitted to
the pension rolls during the year ending the
80th day ot June last, the names of 16,7(0 in
valid soldiers, and of 271 disabled seamen,
making the present number of army invalid
pensions 22,767, and of navy invalid pension
ers 712. Of widows, orphans, and mothers
22,198 have been placed in the • army pension
roils, and 248 on the navy rolls. The present
number of army pensioners of this class is
25,433, and of navy pensioners 7D3. At the
beginning of the year, the number of Revolu
tionary pensioners was 1,430; only 12 of them
were soldiers, of whom 8 have since died; the
remainder arc those who, under the law, re
ceive pensions because of relationship to
Revolutionary soldiers. During the year
ending the 30th of June, 1864, $0,501,616.92
have been paid to pensioners of all classes.
LOCAL INSTITUTIONS.
I cheerfully commend to your continued
patronage the benevolent institutions of the
District of Columbia, which have hitherto
been established or fostered hy Congress, and
respectfully refer for information concerning
them and in relation to the Washington ac
queduct, the Capitol and other matters of
local interest, to the report of the Secretary.
AGRICULTURE,
The Agricultural Department, under the
supervision of Us present energetic head, is
rapidly commending itself to the great and
vital interest it was created to advance. It
is peculiarly the people’s department, in
which they feel more directly concerned than
in any other. I commend it to the continued
attention and fostering care of Congress.
PROGRESS OP THE WAR.
The war continues. Since the last annual
message all the important lines and positions
then held by our armies have been main
tained, and onrarmlca have steadily advanced,
thus liberating the States left in the rear, so
that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and
parts of other States, have again produced
reasonably fair crops.
GEN. SHERMAN’S MARCH.
The most remarkable feature in the milita
ry operations ofr the year is Gen. Sherman’s
attempted march of three hundred miles di
rectly through tho Insurgent region. It tends
to show- & great increase of oar realtive
strength, that our General-in-Chief should
feel able to coufiont and hold la check every
active force of the enemy, and yet to detach
a well appointed army to move on such an ex
pedition. The result not yet known, conjec
ture in regard to it is not here indulged. o
REORGANIZATION OP STATES.
Important movements have also occurred
during the year to the effect of molding so
ciety lor durability in the Union. Although
short of complete success, it is much in the
right direction that 12,000 citizens In each of
the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have
organized loyal State Governments, with free
Constitutions, andare earnestly struggling to
maintain and administer them. The move
ment in the same direction, more extensive,
though less definite, in Missouri, Kentucky,
and Tennessee, should not be overlooked; but
Maryland presents an example of complete
success. Maryland is secure to liberty and
Union for all the future. The genius of
rebellion will no more claim Maryland ; like
another foul spirit, being driven out, it will
seek to rend her, but It will woo her no
more.
THE TOTAL ABOLITION’ OF SLAVEDT RECOiI-
MENDED.
At tlic last session of Congress a proposed
amendment of the Constiiutlon, abolishing
slavery throughout the United States, passed
the Senate, hut failed, for lack of the requisite
two-thirds vote, in the House of Representa
tives. Although the present is the same Con
gress and nearly the same members, without
questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those
who stood In opposition, I venture to recom
mend the passage of the measure at the pres
ent session. Of course the abstract question
is not changed, but an intervening election
Las almost certainly indicated that the nest
Congress will pass the measure, if this does
not; hence there is only a question of time as
to when the proposed amendment will go to
the States for their action, and it is to go
at all events, may wo not agree that the
sooner the belter. It is not claimed that the
election has imposed a duty on members to
change their views or votes, any further than
as an additional element to be considered.
Their judgment may be affected by it. It is
the voice of the people, now for the first time
heard on the question. In a great national
crisis like ours, unanimity of action among
those seeking a common end is very desira
ble, almost indispensable, and yet no ap
proach to such unanimity is attainable unless
some deference shall be paid to the will of the
majority, simply because it is the will of the
majority. In this case the common end is the
maintenance of the Union, and among the
means to secore that end, such will, through
the election, is most clearly declared in favor
of such constitutional amendment. The most
reliable indication of public purpose in this
country is derived through our popular elec
tion.
THE MEANING OF THE ELECTION.
Judging by the recent canvass and its re*
suits, tho purpose of the people within the
loyal States to maintain the integrity of the
Union was never more firm nor mpre nearly
unanimous, than now. The extraordinary
calmness and good order with which the mil
lions of voters met and mingled at tbe polls,
gave strong assurance of this. Not only all
those who supported the Union ticket, so
called, but a great majority of tbe opposing
party also, may be fairly claimed to be actu
ated by the same purpose. It is an unanswer
able argument, tbat no candidate for any
otficc whatever, high or low, has ventured to
seek votes on the avowal that he was forgiv
ing up the Union. There has been much im
prgning of motives and much heated contro
versy as to the proper means and best mode
of advancing the Union cause, but in the dis
tinct issue of Union or no Union, the politi
cians have shown their instinctive knowledge
that there is no diversity among the peo
ple. In awarding the people the fair oppor
tunity of showing one to another, and to the
world, this firmness and unanimity of pur
pose, the election has been of vast value to
the national cause.
THE NATION GAINING STRENGTH.
Tlie election has exhibited another fact, not
less valuable to be known—the fact that wo
do not approach exhaustion in the most im
portant branch of the national resources—
that of living men. "While it is melancholy
to reflect that the war has filled so many
craves and caused mourning to so many
homes, it is some relief to know that, com
pared with the surviving, the fallen have been
so few. While corps and divisions and brig
ades and regiments have formed and fought
and bkd and gone out of existence, a great
majority of the men who composed them are
still living. The same is true of the naval
service; the election returns prove this. So
many voters conldnot else he fonnd. The
States regularly holding elections, both now
and four years ago, Jo-wit: California, Con
necticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, lowa,
Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts.
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hamp
shire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon,
Virginia and Wisconsin, cast 3,982,011 votes
now against 3,870,222 cast then, showing an
aggregate now of 3,393,211, to which is to be
added 33,7G2 cast now in the new States of
Kansas and Nevada, which States did
not vote In 1809, thus swelling the
aggregate to 4,075,773, and the net Acreaso
during the three years and a half of war, to
145,751. A table is appended, showing
particulars. To this again should be added
the number of all the soldiers in the field
from Massachusetts; Rhode Island, New Jer
sey, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois and Califor
nia, who, by the law of those States, could
not vote away from their homes, which num
ber cannot be less than 120,000. Nor yet is
this all. The number in the organlred Ter
ritories is triple now what it was four years
ago, while thousands, white and black, join
us as the national arms press back the insur
gent lines. So much is shown, allirmatlvely
and negatively, by the electron. It is not
material to inquire how the increase has been
produced, or to show that it would have
been greater but for the war, which is prob
ably true. The important fact remains de
monstrated that we have more men now than
when the war began—that wc are apt ex
hausted, nor in nrCccss of exhaustion—that
we are gaining strength, and may, if need be,
maintain tlie contest indefinitely.
ABC3TOAKCB OF MATERIAL RESOURCES.
This as to men. Onr material resources are
now more complete and abundant than ever.
The national resources, then, are unexhaust
ed, and, as wc believe, inexhaustible. The
public purpose to re-establish and maintain
'the national authority is unchanged, and, as
we believe, unchangeable. The manner of
continuing the effort remains to choose. On
carcfnl consideration of all the evidence ac
cessible. it. seems to me that no attempt at
negotiation ■with the Insurgent leader could
result In any good. He would accept of
nothing short of the severance of the Union.
His declarations to that effect are explicit and
’oft-repeated. Ho docs not attempt to de
ceive us. He affords us no excuse to deceive
ourselves. Wc cannot voluntarily yield it.
Between him and us the issue is distinct, sim
ple and inflexible. It is an- issue which can
only be tried by war. : and decided by .victory.
If we yield, we are beaten. If the Southern
people fellhim he is beaten. Either way, it
wouldbcthevicloryand defeat following war.
now tttb iLtr iiatb pxace.
'What Is true, however, of him who heads
the insurgent cause, is not necessarily true of
those who follow. Although he cannot rc-ac-'
cept the Union, they can. Some of them, wo’
know, already desire peace and re-unlon.
They can at any moment have peace simply
by laying down their arms and submitting to
the National authority, under the Constitu
tion. After so much, the Government could
not, if it would, maintain war against them.
The loyal people would not sustain or allow
Jt. If questions should remain, we would ad
just them by the peaceful means of legisla
tion, conference, courts and votes, operating
only in Constitutional and lawful channels.
Some certain and other possible questions
are and would be beyond the Executive power
to adjust. For instance, the admission of
members Into Congress, and whalever Bright
require the appropriation of money. The
Executive power itself would be greatly di
minished by the cessation of actual war. Par
dons and remissions of forfeiture, however,
would still be within Executive control.
In what spirit and tempenthis control would
be exercised, can be fairly judged of by the
past. A year ago General Pardon and Am
nesty, upon specified terras, were offered to
all except a certain designated class, aad it
was at the same time known that the except
ed dosses were stili withln contemplation of
special clemency. During the year .many
availed themselves of the general provision,
and many more would, only, that the signs of
bad feith in some led to such precautionary
measures as rendered the practical process
less easy and certain. During the same time
also, special pardons have been granted to in
dividuals of excepted classes, and no volun
tary application has been denied. Thus,
practically, the door has for a full year been
open to au such as were not in a condition to
make free choice—that Is, such as were in
custody or under constraint. It Is still open
to all. But the time may come—probably
will come, when the public duty shall de
maud that it be closed, and that, In lieu,
more vigorous measures than heretofore shall
be adopted.
SLAVERY.
In presenting the abandonment of armed
resistance to the national authority, on the
pait of the insurgents, as the only indispens
able condition to ending the war on the part
of the Government, I retract nothing hereto
fore said as to slavery. I repeat the declara
tion made a year ago, that while I remain in
my present position I shall not attempt to
jetract or modifv the Emancipation Procla
mation, nor shalTl return to slavery any per
son who is free by the terms of that procla
mation or by any of the acts of Congress. If
the people should, by whatever iftode or
means, make it my executive duty to re-en
slavc such persons, another, and not I, must
be their instrument to perform It.
In slating a single condition of peace, I
mean simply to say that the war will cease
on tie part of the Government whenever it
fibni| have, ceased on the part of those who
began it. Abraham.Lincoln.
Gen. Slienuan’s Progress.
Swlnton, of the New York Time* thus sums
up the progress of Gen. Sherman, and what
he has accomplished:
What, then, has been the actual progress
of Gen. Sherman, thus far, in the execution
of his purpose ? First, we know from the
testimony of tho Richmond journals of yes
terday, that he has successfully transferred
his whole army over the Oconee, tho only
river he had to cress crc reaching an outlet
on the sea. Wc know, secondly, that he is
moving far south of Augusta, on the lino con
necting that city with Savannah, and on
which they both depend.' We know, thirdly,
that he had, at last advices, pushed forward
so far that he was able to throw out a cavalry
column to communicate with the fleet. Wo
know, fourthly, both through the confessions
of tho Richmond and Georgia press, and
through the declarations of Gen. Grant, that
the rebels have no hope of being able to
thwart Sherman. This despair is strikingly
manifested in the tone of angry comment
which the Richmond press heap on Jeff. Davis
for his policy in sending Hood’s army on a
fruitless raid into Tennessee, instead of re
taining it where it could check the advance
of Sherman.
A Disappointed Audience.
[From the Philadelphia Enquirer, Dec. 3.]
An .Intelligent audience of ladics'ond gen
tlemen assembled last evening, In the halt of
the University of Pennsylvania, to listen to
an address tram Hon. John Cadwalader,
Judge of the United States District Court.
Charles E. Lex, Esq., presided, and intro
duced to the audience the orator of the eve
ning. Judge Cadwalader said that he had
prepared a somewhat elaborateaddresson the
sources of improvement in a constitutional
Government, but unfortunately for himself,
if fortunately for the audience, be had had a
hole in his overcoat pocket, and through it
his manuscript had dropped out. He baa dis
patched a messenger to intercept the car, but
the conductor said he had noticed another in
dividual lift it up and put it in h!s pocket, so
he must respectfully apologize to the audience
and take ms scat. After being entertained
for some time by a band in attendance the
audience dispersed.

There was a good attendance on ’Change to-day,
and the general markets were firmer.
There was a much better feeling In the Provis
ion market, and prices had a strong upward ten*
deucy. Mess Pork was held at $35.00, with some
inquiry at $34.00, frime Mesa Pork was in active
demand, and the market advanced fully 50c brl,

with the “Washburne chills,” and prices fell
abont 4c per gallon, with sales of about 1,100 brls

$1.79.
The inquiry for Oats was limited, but the favor
able nows from New -York gave a strong tone
to the market, which ruled firm at the outside fig
ures of yesterday. About 30,000 bu changed
hands at CS@63jc for No. 1, and 61@02 for No. 2-
closiug firm at «3jc for fraeh receipts ofNo. 1.
The advance in gold to-day strengthened the
views of holders of Flour to tbo extent of 10@12Jc
per brl, but operators Aowed no disposition to
come forward at the advance, and even at yester
day’s figures they showed no inclination to effect
purchases The transactions were confined to
the flying of email orders and the wants of the
city trade. About 480 brls changed hands at $10.50
©ll.OO for white winters; $8.32* for choice spring
extras, and $6.25 for spring supers.

and $1.53 for No. 9 Spring. The market closed
firm at $1.72©1.72* for No. 1 Spring.
The inquiry-for new Corn was very limited, and
the market ruled dull and rather irregular, owing
mainly to the location of the receipts—prices how
ever being about the same as the range of yesterday.
There was nothing' doing In Old Com, which is
doll and neglected. Ear Com .was very quiet.
The sales foot up some 10.000 ba. at 73@79c for

LUMBER—The receipts of Lumber daring the past
week have been more liberal than was anticipated‘
owing to the arrival of a l&rga number of cargoes o'
rafted lumber from Grand River that it was not sap.
posed would be shipped before the ensuing spring.
The market bos been marked by considerable firm
ness, and Us activity has only been restricted by the
supply. On the transactions reported for the week It
will be seen that prices have generally been high, and
to-day we note an advance of SI.OO 9 thousand feet.
Most of the vessels ore now laid up for tho winter;
a few are, howeverTsUH expected from near points;
bat for anytldng like a regular or important supply
there Is no prospect.
SHINGLES—The receipts during the past weekhavo
been comparatively large, and the market bos been
correspondingly acUvo and firm, but with no advance
on previous rates.
lath—With a (Mr supply* trade has been moder.
otoly active, and prices steady at previous rates.
