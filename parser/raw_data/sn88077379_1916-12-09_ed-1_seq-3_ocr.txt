"In the first place, it seems to me
imperatively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action should
be accorded the remaining measures of
the program of settlement and regula
tion which I had occasion to recommend
to you at the close of your last session
in view of the public dangers disclosed
by the unaccommodated difficulties which
then existed and which still unhappily
continued to exist, between the railroads
of the country and their locomotive en
gineers, conductors and trainmen.
"I then recommended:
"First, immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied in
the bill recently passed by the house of
representatives and now awaiting action
by the senate; in order that the commis
sion may be enabled to deal with the
many great and various duties which arc,
with its present constitution and means
of action, practically impossible.
Eight-Hour Dny Tssucs Again IScfoi-c

"Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wakes in the employ
ment of all railway employes who arc
actually engaged in the work of operat
ing trains in interstate transportation.
"Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small

body of men to observe the actual re
sults in experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day in railway transpor
tation alike for the men and for the
railroads.
"Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration b) the inter
state commerce commission of an in
crease of freight rates to meet such ad
ditional expenditures by the railroads as
may have been rendered necessary by
the adoption of the eight-hour day and
which have not been offset by adminis
trative readjustments and economics,
should the facts disclosed justify the in
crease. "Fifth, an amendment of the exist
ing federal statute which provides for
the mediation, conciliation, and arbitra
tion ofsuch controversies as the present
bj adding to it a provision thai in case
the methods of accommodation now pro
vided for shall fail, a full public inves
tigation of the merits of every such dis
pute shall be instituted and completed
before a strike or lockout maj lawfully
be attempted.
"And sixth, the lodgment in the hands
of the executive of the power, in case
of military necessity, to take control of
such portions and such rolling stock of
the railwajs of the country as may be
required tor military use and to operate
them for military purposes, with au
thority to draft into the military service
of the United States such train crews
and administrative officials as the cir
cumstances rccmirc for their safe and
efficient use.
"The second and third of these recom
mendations the congress immediately
acted on; it established the eight-hour
day as the legal basis of work and wages
in train service and it authorized the
appointment of a commission to observe
and report upon the practical results,
deeming these the measures most im
mediate! needed; but it postponed ac
tion upon the other suggestions until an
opportunity should be offered for a more
deliberate consideration of them.
Power of Commission To Increase
Untes Is Clear.
"The fourth recommendation I do not
deem it necessarj to renew. The power
of the interstate commerce commission
to grant increase of rates on the ground
referred to is indisputably clear and a
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem to
draw in question the scope of the com
mission's justice when there is no rea
son to doubt cither.
"The other suggestions the increase
in the interstate commerce commission's
membership and in its facilities for per
forming its manifold duties, the pro
vision for full public investigation and
assessment of industrial disputes, and
the grant to the executive of the power
to control and operate the railways when
necessary in time of war or other like
public necessity I now very earnestly
renew.
"The necessity for such legislation is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
entrusted us with the responsibility and
duty of serving and safeguarding them
in such matters would find it hard, I be
lieve, to excuse a failure to act upon
these grave matters or any unnecessary
postponement of action upon them.

"Not only; (Joes the interstate com
merce commission now find it practically
impossible with its present membership
and organi7ation, to perform its great
functions promptly and thoroughly, but
it is not unlikely that it may presently
be found advisable to add to its duties
still others equally heavy and exacting.
It must first be perfected as an admin
istrative instrument.
"The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound industrial disturbances for
lack of additional means of arbitration
and conciliation which the congress can
easily and promptly supply.
"And all will agree that there must
be no doubt as to the power of the ex
ecutive to make immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
nation wherever they are needed and
whenever they are needed.
"There is a program of regulation,
prevention and administration cfficicncv
which argues its own case in the mere
statement of it.
"With regard to one of its items, the
increase in the efficiency of the inter
state commerce commission, the- house
of representatives has already acted; its
action needs only the concurrence of the
senate.
Compulsory Arbitration Xot Fa
vored Uy President.
"I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the Congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should I make
it, that any man in any occupation should
be obliged by law to continue in an cm
plomcnt which he desired to leave.
"To pass a law which forbade or pre
vented the individual workman to leave
his work before receiving the approval
of society in doing so would be to adopt
a new principle into our jurisprudence
which 1 take it for granted we arc not
prepared to introduce.
"But the proposal that the operation
of the railways of the country shall not
be stopped or interrupted by the con
certed action of organized bodies of
men until a public investigation shall
have been instituted which shal make
the whole question at issue plain for
the judgment of the opinion of the na
tion is not to propose any such prin
ciple. "It is based upon the very different
principle that the concerted action of
powerful bodies of men shall not he per
mitted to stop the industrial processes
of the nation, at any rate before the na
tion shall have had an opportunity to
acquaint itself with the merits of the
case as between employe and employer,
time to form its opinion upon an im
partial statement of the merits and op
portunity to consider all practicable
means of conciliation or arbitration.
"I can see nothing in that proposition
but the justifiable safe-guarding by so
ciety of the necessary processes of its
very life. There is nothing arbitrary
or unjust in it unless it be arbitrary
and unjustly done.
"It can and should be done with a full
and scrupulous regard for the interests
and liberties of all concerned as well
as for the ncrmancm interests of society
itself."
