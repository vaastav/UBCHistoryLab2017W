Tiik woods are full of candidates for
governor. -
Fifth district papers are advocating
the selection of Hon. John A. Ander
son as riumb's successor, and say that
district will send to the legislature a
solid Anderson delegation.
A new commercial enterprise has
been developed in southwestern Kan
sas. A Wichita man Is engaged in
gathering up torn cats which he ships by
the carload to the rat-infested towns of
Colorado.
A 8 ad looking man has been visiting
farmers in Western Kansas and asking
them to sign a pledge not to kill any
song birds for a year. Afterwards
these pledges are returned in the shape
of promissory notes.
Counterfeit postal cards have been
discovered in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania,
which are so skillfully executed that
their detection is very difficult. This
is the first attempt to put spurious pos
tal cards in circulation. It is thought
they come from New York.
The Iowa prohibitionists claim that
as the union labor ticket was nomin
ated on a prohibition platform, its vote
should be added to the republican vote
when estimating the majority against
the liquor democracy. This would give
a prohibition majority of 27,492.
If the trains are on time and the
plate telegraph paper has good luck,
the possibilities are that it may have
the presidents message this evening.
The News was the only paper in the
county that gave it to its readers yes
terday, a few minutes after its delivery
to congress.
PEN8I0N8 BEFORE REDUCTION .
From a free trade and partisan stand.
point, yesterday's message of President
Cleveland is a very able and plausible
document. But, when we remember
that it was bis hand that wrote the
message vetoing the bill to pension
union soldiers over a certain age who
were unable to make a living for them
selves, while in almost the same breath
he freely signed another somewhat sim-
lar but more liberal measure for the
benefit of veterans of the Mexican war,
we must be of the opinion that the doc
ument of yesterday is, to a certain ex
tent, a. strictly old-style democratic
document, and that It will be riddled
and torn to pieces ere congress gets
through with it.
When President Cleveland has con
sented to measuvs that shall put the
soldier who risked his life for his coun
try ,on a par with the money loaned by
bond holders, then it will be time
enough to talk of reducing the revenue.
But until every measure is taken to
equalize this injustice, no reduction
should be made as it is not necessary
until then.
For every dollar that the' bond hold
ers loaned the government they have
received back the face value in gold,
with interest on interest.
How Is it with the soldier? ne
loaned 'the government his life, the
lives of his . family whom he left at
home; and the bond given him was
that he should receive from $13 to $16 a
month, and that his family should be
well taken care of in case he returned
not.
Have these promises been filled? No.
Not one of them. Even the wages he
was paid were given him in a currency
depreciated so that it took nearly three
dollars of it to buy one dollar of the
kind of money the bond-holders were
paid in. And yet thia man who wants
a revenue reduced because it is causing
an accumulation in the treasury that
threatens to endanger the entire
country, refused to sign a bill calcu
culated to do only partial justice to
these soldiers who saved the country
which he has the honor to preside over.
But we venture to predict that Mr.
Cleveland will take time to think ere
he dares veto the pension bill that will
be handed to him for his signature
before the next presidential election.

In a conversation with II- Parkman,
superintendent, and Mr. Patten, the
contractor, we learned that the . indi
cations for gas were better now than
they ever have been, and both gentle
men were very hopeful of soon being
able to announce its discovery in pay
ing quantities. This last strong indi
cation is the the third that has given
thm encouragement, and they feel
quite certain that they are pretty close
on to it. The following is a carefully
prepared list of the various stratas

One of the means resorted to by
the anti-prohibitionists, during the re
cent campaign in Atlanta, was the
printing and distributing of thousands
of circulars containing the following:
Prohibitrfon will work great injury to
the cause of temperance. It is a spe
cies of intemperance within itself for it
goes beyond the bounds - of reason, in
that it attempts to control a man's ap
petite by legislation, and in making
crimes out of things that are not crimes.
A prohibitory law strikes a blow at the
very principles on which our govern
ment was founded. I have always
been found laboring to protect the
weaker class from the stronger, and I
can never give my consent to such a
law as you propose to enact. Until my
tongue oe suencea in aeatn i win con
tinue to fight for the rights of man.
These sentiments, ascribed to Abra
ham Lincoln and printed beneath a
picture representing the great emanci
pator in the act of striking the chains
from the limbs of the slaves, decided
the issue against, the prohibitionists,
The colored people, actuated by a feel
ing of gratitude, positively refused to
vote in favor of what their liberator
had denounced, and as they yielded
the balance of power, the anti-prohibi
tionists carried the day. In politics
appeals to sentiment are frequently
more potent than appeals to judgment.

HiacK state
An express agent on the Santa Fe
states that the shipments of whisky
and- wine by express to Emporia, for
yesterday alone, amounted to "one
hundred and eighty-seven gallons. And
yet some people claim that prohibition
prohibits in Kansas. Why. it does not
even restrict in Emporia.
The short-sighted view taken by the
president, or tarin measures as a pro
tection to our manufactures because
our manufactures are so few as yet
, seems hardly a good argument, when it
is understood that unless fostered we
will soon have still fewer, while, if en
courged, the probabilities are strongly
favorable for the United States becom
ing the manufactory as well as the
storehouse of the world.
The decisions rendered yesterday by
Justice Harlan at Washington settles
a long-standing question, and may be
accounted the grandest victory so far
gained by the prohibitionists. The
effect of the decision is to declare valid
the prohibition laws of Kansas, which
destroyed an immense amount of prop
erty in the shape of breweries, and re
lieves the state from liabilities as com
pensation for damages caused by such
destruction.
Now that we have a law
in Kansas that allows people to take a
little "for their stomach sake and their
many infirmities," they are becoming
quite regular in their habits. Among
the many names registered as pur
chasers of liquor, however we fail to
find that of one of the ladies who
signed the petitions for permits.
This seems queer to some. But the
possibility is that the ladies and gentle
men who signed the petitions are real
temperance people, although not fan
atics. iii
It is asserted by Philadelphia papers
that President Cleveland is on a par with
any alien, so far as his right to vote is
concerned; that for two years past he
has not voted, and that as he gave
up his right to vote in Buffalo at the
time he gave up his residence there,
he therefore cannot cast bis ballot, the
residents of the District of Columbia
being like Susan II., deprived of suf
frage. This is something that has never
heretofore happened to any president
of the United States. The cause is
said to be spite on the part of Cleve
land because the citizens of Buffalo,
and even in his own ward and precinct,
where he should be best known, refuse
to indorse him or his party at the ballot
box.
Some
Englishmen have a good deal
more sense on the tariff question than
many Americans. Henry Labouchere
of the London Truth says: "I am no
fanatical free-trader; I am one geo
graphically. If I had been an Ameri
can I should have been a protectionist.
Being an Englishman, I am a free
trader. If I were a Canadian I should
advocate a tiistoma union with the
United States, although, as an English
man, I should be sorry if this union
were effected. The mistake of politi
cal economy is to suppose that it is
based on principles of universal appli
cation. My reason, as an Englishman,
for being a free-trader is not any theo
retical admiration for free trade, but
because we should lose more than we
should gain by protection."
Since the publication of the names
of purchasers of liquid poison at our
drug stores, it has been suggested that
the prohibition sentiment in Emporia
is somewhat of the same order as that
of the Irishman who had been induced
to sign a temperance pledge while at
tending an exciting temperance revival
under the leadership of the famous
Father Matthew. The reverend gen
tleman met his convert early next
morning staggering along under a pretty
good load of "bug juice," and, accost
ing him, asked if he had not signed the
pledge the previous evening. "Faith I
did, your honor, but then I'd have yez
know I'm no fanatic," replied Pat, as
he staggered off for another bowl.
RET. BERNARD KELLY AND THE
8 SNA T0R8HIP.
In the Fort Scott Monitor we find the
following article on our Elder Bernard
Kelly and his candidacy for the gov
ernorship. Believing it would be of in
terest to many of our readers, we re
produce it in full:
The numerous paragraphs going the
rounds of the press, in which the name
of the gentleman mentioned in the
head of this article is being used in
various ways connected with the gov
ernorship of Kansas, has set us to re
flecting upon the certain reward which
attends a well directed and usefnl life.
Rev. Bernard Kelly removed to Kan
sas from Ohio, where he was a
member of the Cincinnatti con
ference in 1870, and has therefore
worked in the ministry in Kansas for
seventeen years. For an idle man
this would seem a long time, but for a
busy man such as Mr. Kelly has been, it
is a very short span. Mr. Kelly first
located in Emporia, where he now re
sides, as presiding elder. After three
years' successful ministry he left there,
and has since filled the pulpits of sur
rounding cities. Few men, whether in
or out of the pulpit, have wielded a
more decided influence for good in Kan
sas than Mr. Kelly, and it is but fair to
him and the people to assume that the
frequent mention of his name in con
nection witn ine nignest omce in ine
state is due to that fact. So far as his
ministry is concerned we have never
known a more loyal man to his chosen
work. His zeal and energy is prover
bial wherever he has served as
pastor, while his prominence in
the church attests bis ability. A strik
ing characteristic of Mr. Kelly as a
minister consists in the fact that his
Christian faith is so slightly tinctured
with theology. After faith in the
atonement, lie looks for works, and it
is this trat of character that has led
him into the thickest of the fight at
times to help the cause of religion and
morals by the enactment of more
wholesome statutes. Bein g a minister,
I he has been criticised at times for his
activity in this direction, but for our
own part we see no objection to a min
ister who is loyal to his church
and people pointing out the means
of helping the state to reform
abuses. The logic of thid belief
is that a minister might with pro
priety accept a political trust of such
(Mufoiuiol with his conviction ol dm v.
in the case of Mr. Kelly we are per
sonally cognizant of the fact that his
love for the church is stronger than his
interest in politics. It may safely be
set down that he is in no wise respon
sible for the frequent mention of his
name for governor, except so far as he
has make himself, through his min
istry, apotent factor in shaping the
policy of Kansas republicanism upon a
higher plane, worthy of its past record.
Recently the writer thereof was
thrown with an intimate friend
and admirer of Mr. Kelly, when
naturally the discussion of the gov
emshipcame up, with the possibility
of Mr. Kelly being a candidate. Said
he, "I am in a position to know, and
I assure you that Mr. Kelly is in no
wise responsible for the use of his
name, he is not a candidate, and
would not under any circumstances
allow his name to be used." Whether
this friend spoke by the card or not
we know not, but we are certain he is
a gentleman in position to know.
This does not alter the complimentary
fact that Mr. Kelly's candidacy has
had many warm supporters 'from
among that class who like to see in
tegrity, purity of character and ability
combined in the man who fills the
highest office in the state. It may be
set down, however, that Mr. Kelly will
not be a candidate.
Ex-Gov. St. John , of Kansas ex
presses himself as quite satisfied with
the working of prohibition in his state
and with the prospects of his party, and
is emboldened to declare that high li
cense is a fraud and a sham. There is
a strong probabilty that high license
would at least accomplish the
purpose . at which it aims
If it could be. : enforced it would
largely reduce the number of saloons
and drinking places, and it would com
pel the liquor traffic to pay a large part
of the public expense which its conse
quences entail. So far it would be
what it pretended to be, and therefore
not a fraud, and it would accomplish a
useful purpose, and therefore would
not be a sham. Prohibition does not
do what it pretends to. do; it causes a
tremendous amount of violation of law
and contempt of .Jaw; it promotes
sneaking evasions,-and it is doubtful
if it materially lessens the amount of
drinking. 'If either policy is a fraud
and a sham it seems to us to be that
which falls so far short of accomplish
ing its own oDjects. .a . x . j. imes.

The Fort Scott Monitor says Ber
nard Kelly's love for his church is
greater than his love for politics, and
we believe the Monitor is right.
Elder Kelly is undoutedbly a patriot
and a lover of his country, as the Bears
on his body, received in her defense,
will certify. But if any state in the
union can show a more zealous servant
in the cause of The Master we have
failed to see him or hear of him. That
religion and patriotism should go
hand in hand is taught in the book of
all books. But patriotism and politics
are not synonymous. Mr. Kelly is not
a politician in the offensive definition
of the term. No one can say he has
ever asked for any of the loaves and
fishes, and if his name has been
mentioned in connection with the
candidacy for governorship, we
certain it was not at his request.

It has come to a pretty pass in a
f re country that when a lady goes to
a drug store and purchases medicine,
by order of her family physician, for a
dying child, that a foreign fanatic, and
possible anarchist as both are of the
same breed should publish her name
to the world as a whisky drinker. Yet
just such an injustice has been per
petrated In our midst, and the author
of it is attempting to pose in the atti
tude of a martyr to the cause of tem
perance, while In really his being a
"fanatic" is his only stock in trade.
Such a blackguard scheme, if Btarted
in every city In Kansas, would defeat
prohibition in less than no time.

Many people are unable to distin
guish the difference between anarchism,
socialism and communism, and for this
reason Webster's defination of these
terms becomes a matter of interest.
Anarchy, he says, "is want of
government; the state ot society where
there is no law or supreme power, or
where the laws are not efficient, and
individuals do what they please with
impunity; political conf u sion."
Socialism is "a theory of society
which advocates a more precise, or
derly, and harmonious arrangement of
the social relations of mankind than
that which has hitherto prevailed;
communism.''
Communism is "the reorganizing of
society, or the doctrine that it should
be reorganized, by regulating prop
erty, industry, and the sources of live
lihood, and also the domestic relations
and social morals of mankind; social
ism; especially the doctrine of a com
munity of property, or the negation of
individual rights in property."
It may be said that a majority of
those who profess to be anarchists,
socialists and communists have about
as indeflnate an idea of what they
want as those who believe in the
existing order of society have of their
purposes.

Ihe State Normal School.
W. H. Caldwell, editor of the Beloit
Courier and who is, also, a member of
the board of regents of the State Nor
mal School, on his return home from a
recent meeting of the board, writes as
follows in regard to the work that is
being done at this institution:
The editor answers at roll call, this
week. Last week he was absent, but
accounted for. On Sunday, the 20th
ult., we went to Emporia, to attend a
meeting of the directors of the State
Normal School, and were in that city
nearly all week. It was expected that
the board would be called upon to re
ceive the new addition to the building,
at this meeting, but circumstances
have been such that its completion is
delayed at least one month, and per
haps longer. All the stone, brick and
carpenter work is done, excepting in
terior finishing, and the roof is on;
plastering was begun, but the intense
cold snap that sprung upon that part
of the country, stopped that kind of
work, and it became necessary to make
some provision for heating the new ad
dition in order that it might
be pushed on to completion.
Happily this was accomplished
by agreement between the con
tractor, Mr. John Hammond, and the
steam heating apparatus and plumbing
contractors, Messrs. Sheehan & Jacobs,
so that, doubtless, the entire worK will
be finished, as above stated, in four or
five weeks. It is badly needed, as the
attendance at the school is greater in
numbers than ever before, and acces
sions being daily made, so that, by
Christmas the roll of pupils will con
tain no less than 800 names unpre
cedented in the history of any of the
state educational institutions. And,
unless some unforeseen accident occurs,
the board of regents will have the
proud distinction of turning over to
the state indisputably the best and
largest building, for the money appro-
Sriated, that has ever been built in
ansas, and without asking the legis
lature for one dollar of deficiency. The
legislature appropriated 25,000; out
of which sum there has been erected a
building at least 75 feet square,
as an addition to the old part, four
stories in height, including basement,
the first story of large, heavy stone,
the other three of fine brick; the lum
ber all first-class, and all the workman
ship like the lumber; the steam-heating
apparatus and plumbing, including
a new boiler; the architect's designs
and specifications and superintendency,
and all the furniture (which includes
about 600 fine opera chairs) and every
thing to complete the work. The
commonest comment is, How can it be
done ? And the only answer to that
interrogation is, It has been done !
The design of the building is very at
tractive, aud the details are compli
mentarv. indeed, to the architects.
Messrs. Hadley & Cooper. We do not
claim that the board of regents should
reap any special srlory from the matter,
but only claim that its members have
done well in management, and they
are to be felicitated upon
selecting two of their number, the
President, Mr. W. M. Rice, editor
of the Ft. Scott Monitor, and the Sec
retary, Mr. II. D. Dickson, democratic
postmaster at Neosho Falls, also a
practical printer, as a committee to
represent the Board during the progress
of work, who, together with that su
perior executive manager, Dr. A. R.
Taylor, President of the Faculty, were
faithful and diligent and watched
everything that went into the con
struction of the edifice with interest
and concern, and, taking all things to
gether, we are safe in saying that it is
a remarkable transaction for the State.
The building is an honor to the State,
standing as an imposing magnificent
monument to the intelligence of her
people, a beautiful structure that at
tracts the attention of everybody, and
in its thorough management by an
able corpse of teachers, is ranked
among the best in the Union.
While in Emporia we had the pleas
ure of meeting Senator Plumb, who in
formed us that he had high hopes of
the complete recovery of his wife from
what was expected to be until quite
recently her fatal illness. The Senator
is in his usual robust health and genial
disposition. He feels quite sanguine
of the success of the republican party
in '88, and while a great admirer of
Mr. Blaine, is conservative, and hopes
to see the convention name the winner
in a calm, business like determination
to go into the field to win. He is im
pressed with Mr. Allison, of Iowa, as
a talked of candidate for President,
while mentioning the names of several
other prominent gentlemen. He will
persist in trying to get through con
gress his bill to break up the
vice of gambling among army
officers, and also his other bill to
break up the favoritism that con
signs certain army officers to soft
places for definite periods and leaves
others as indefinite in places less desir
able. We do not believe that he looks
with much favor upon the postal tele
graph project: however, he is open to
conviction.
At Kansas City last Saturday even
ing, we were surprised by ex-Gov.
John P. St. John bustling into tho din
ing room and sitting down to supper
at the table just in front of us. lie
was on his way to Chicago to make a
speech, so he told us, and from thence
to some other point, and wonld attend
the meeting in Topeka about the mid
dle of next month, after which he
would return to California, where his
family are stopping. His parting
words with us were, "Well, well, God
bless yon, old fellow; you republicans
will all be with us in less than four
years." We asked him, "Why,
are you coming back to us
He replied, "No, I'm sroing," and
seized his hat and scarf and rushed out
just in tune to catch the train moving
away. We like that old man, person
ally, but think he has done us enough
damage now to conpensate for all the
meanness our party did him, and he
ought to let up.
While in Emporia we also met Hon.
Bernard Kelly, who is looming up
greatly as a possible candidate for
governor, and if everybody came away
from him as wise as we did, then no
body on earth knows whether he will
be a candidate or not. He is a good
man; an eminent preacher of the M. E.
Church, and a rattling G. A. R. com
rade, now holding the position of chap
lain of the department.

ted. The warrants were made out and
read to them in the jail Wednesday
Some are held on one charge, some on
two and some on three. These
thefts were committed on
November 20 and 30, and December 1,
but the work has been going on for
some six or eight months. The stolen
articles consist of boots, hats, shirts,
cigars, raisins, soap etc. Many of the
articles have been found, and the
Santa Fe special agent, Henry Mayer
and Marshal Doherty are still on the
lookout for the remainder of the stolen
goods.
By request of the Santa Fe special
agent and the city marshal, the trial
was postponed till next Tuesday. The
boys who are held as prisoners

given an opportunity to secure bail.
The boys were fifed in about half

fastened together with "iron bracelets"
to keep them from taking to their
heels. The charges against them were
read and explained by the justice and
the bond for each offense was fixed at
