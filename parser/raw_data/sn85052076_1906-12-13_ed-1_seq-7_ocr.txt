Zoncsvlllo 0 Doc 7A helpless
young woman was cremated la her
own homo two miles from Now Con
cord and thero ore evidences that she
was tho victim of ono of tho most
Klrocloun crimes over committed in
Musklngum county
The decadent Is Miss Sarah Wile
tho invalid daughter of a widowed mo
ther Mrs Mary Wllay who with hor
son John manages a large farm near
Now Corcord the mother and tho two
children living taro alono
Tho farm is Isolated to a certain ex
tent tho nearest neighbor living almost
9 ratio away and thero are no houses
Jn light of tho Wlloy home
Mrs Wiley has always been con ld
ed welltodo and It has been tho opin
ion of the neighborhood that her home
contained considerable wealth In tho
form of valuable papers and money
Mrs Wiley and her son drove several
miles away from their homo on a busi
ness mission leaving Miss Wiley alone
at homo She was a hoipluss paralyt
ic unable to move about In tho rooms
Thoy loft her sitting In an Invalids
chairReturning
Returning home late Mrs Wlloy and
hor son wero horrified to find tho
greater portion of tho house reduced
to ashes In the debris they found
tho charred remains of Sarah Wiley
The Interior of tho room In which
she wan loft was wholly destroyed
but ho position In which the charred
body wan found indicates that she
had been brutally tortured and ma
liciously burned to death by some un
known person
The theory II that robbers entered
the homo after discovering tho ab
once of tho mother and son and loot
ed all tho rooms in search of valuables
It Is further believed that they
sought by all manners of cruol means
to oompol tho invalid girl to disclose
the hiding place of the supposed vrJ
uablos and money and that upon her
refusal or Inability to satisfy them tho
lends HI fire to the bod and other
Inflammable article In the room
Tho familys coal oil onn was found
Jut outside tho door empty and It II
surmised that tho content of this can
were used to start the blase
Tho girls body was found several
feet from tho Invalid choir It Is not
known whether tho burglars secured
any valuable Mrs Wiley Is unoom
municative on this subject besides
the bowie having been burned she Is
In doubt ae to what may have boon

None of the neighbors learned of

whether Mr Storer deserves to be

phasizes the fact that tho Cincinnati
man was dismissed from the diplomat

A Trick That Will Amuse an Evening
Company Immensely
Public entqrtatncrs of alt kinds am
always anxious to get on good terms
with their audiences One of the Sur
est methods of attaining this Is to de
ceive tho spectators with some appar
ently genuine trick and to then as
it were allow them to discover that l
the feat Is really a bogus one
A good example of this Is afforded
by a conjuror who putting a plate oa
top of pedestal places a billiard ball
upon it Facing the audience bo steps
in front of the pedestal then stepaj 1
aside again and Uv and behold the
billiard ball has disappeared
The performer searches for the
ball and soon pretending to see it
dropping from the clouds he catches
it and holds it aloft In his catchesI
for all to see
In reality tho performers left armr
flxed in front of himIs from elbow
downwards a dummy ono and It is
with his real left hang that ho picks
up the billiard ball behind his back
