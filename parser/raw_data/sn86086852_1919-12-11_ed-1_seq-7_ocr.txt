Washington, Dec. 2. —President Wil
son’s message to the sixty-sixth con
gress was read to that body today.
The text of the message follows:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives ;
I sincerely regret that I cannot be
present at the opening of this session
of the congress. 1 am thus prevented
from presenting in as direct a way as
I could wish the many questions that
are pressing for solution at this time.
Happily, I have had the advantage of
the advice of the heads of the several
executive departments who have kept
in close touch with affairs in their
detail and whose thoughtful recom
mendations 1 earnestly second.
In the matter of the railroads and
the readjustment of their affairs grow
ing out of federal control, 1 shall take
the liberty at a later date of address
ing you.
Asks Budget System.
I hope that congress will bring to a
conclusion at this session legislation
looking to the establishment of a bud
get system. That there should be one
single authority responsible for the
making of all appropriations and that
appropriations should be made not in
dependently of each other, but with
reference to one single comprehensive
plan of expenditure propeny related
to the nation’s income, there can be
no doubt. I believe the burden of
preparing the budget must, in the na
ture of the case, if the work is to be
properly done and responsibility con
centrated instead of divided, rest upon
the executive.
The budget so prepared should be
submitted to and approved or amend
ed by a single committee of each
house of congress and no single ap
propriation should be made by the
congress except such as may have been
Included in the budget prepared by the
executive or added by the particular
committee charged with the budget
legislation.
Audits on Expenditure.
Another and not less important as
pect of the problem is the ascertain
ment of the economy and efficiency
with which the moneys appropriated
are expended. Under existing law the
only audit is for the purpose of ascer
taining whether expenditures have
been lawfully made within the appro
priations. No one Is authorized or
equipped to ascertain whether the
money has been spent wisely, eco
nomically and effectively.
The auditors should be highly
trained officials with permanent ten
ure In the treasury department, free
of obligations to or motives of consid
eration for this or any subsequent ad
ministration, and authorized and em
powered to examine into and make re
port upon the methods employed and
the results obtained by the executive
departments of the government. Their
reports should be made to the con
gress and to the secretary of the
treasury.
Problem of Taxation.
I trust that the congress will give
Its immediate consideration to the
problem of future taxation. Simpli
fication of the income and profits tax
es has become an immediate necessity.
These taxes performed indispensable
service during the war. They must,
however, be simplified, not only to
save the taxpayer inconvenience and
expense, but in order that his liability
may be made certain and definite.
With reference to the details of the
revenue law, the secretary of the
treasury and the commissioner of in
ternal revenue will lay before you for
your consideration certain amend
ments necessary or desirable in con
nection with the administration of the
law —recommendations which have my
approval and support. It is of the ut
most importance that in dealing with
this matter the present law should
not be disturbed so far as regards
taxes for the calendar year 1920, pay
able in the calendar year 1921.
War Time Rates May Be Too High.
The congress might well consider
whether the higher rates of income
and profits taxes can in peace times
be effectively productive of revenue,
and whether they may not, on the con
trary, be destructive of business ac
tivity and productive of waste and
Inefficiency.
There is a point at which in peace
times high rates of income and profits
taxes discourage energy, remove the
incentive to new’ enterprise, encourage
extravagant expenditures and produce
Industrial stagnation, with consequent
unemployment and other attendant
•vils.
The problem Is not an easy one.
▲ fundamental change has taken place
with reference to the position of Amer
ica in the world’s affairs. The prej
udice and passions engendered ny
decades of controversy between two
schools of political and economic
thought—the one believers in protec
tion of American Industries, the other
believers in tariff for revenue only-

must be subordinated to the considera
tion of the public interest in the light
of utterly changed conditions.
Pre-War Trade Balanced.
Before the war America was heavily
the debtor of the rest of the world
and the interest payments she had
to make to foreign countries on Amer
ican securities abroad, the expendi
tures of American travelers abroad
and the ocean freight charges she had
to pay to others about balanced the
value of her pre-war favorable bal
ance of trade. During the war Amer
ica’s exports have been greatly stimu
lated, and increased prices have in
creased their value. On the other
hand, she has purchased a large pro
portion of the American securities
previously held abroad, has loaned
some .$9,000,000,000 to foreign govern
ments and has built her own ships.
Our favorable balance of trade has
thus been greatly increased and Eu
rope has been deprived of the means
of meeting it heretofore existing.
Europe can have only three ways of
meeting the favorable balance of
trade in peace times: By imports into
this country of gold or of goods, or by
establishing new credits. Europe is in
no position ac the present time to ship
gold to us, nor could we contemplate
large further imports of gold into this
country without concern.
Must Have Outlet for Exports.
The time has nearly passed for in
ternational governmental loans and it
will take time to develop in this* coun
try a market for foreign securities.
Anything, therefore, which would
tend to prevent foreign countries from
settling for our exports by shipments
of goods into this country could only
have the effect of preventing them
from paying for our exports and there
fore of preventing the exports from
being made.
The productivity of the country,
greatly stimulated by the war must
find an outlet by exports to foreign
countries and any measures taken to
prevent imports will inevitably curtail
exports, force curtailment of produc
tion, load the banking machinery of
the country with credits 1 to carry un
sold products and produce industrial
stagnation and unemployment. If we
want to sell, we must be prepared to
buy. Whatever, therefore, may have
been our views during the period of
growth of American business concern
ing tariff legislation, we must now ad
just our own economic life to a
changed condition growing out of the
fact that American business is full
grown and that America is the great
est capitalist in the world.
isolation Policy Won't Do,
No policy of isolation will satisfy
the growing needs and opportunities
of America. The provincial stand
ards and policies of the past, which
have held American business as if in
a struightjacket, must yield and give
way to the needs and exigencies of
the new day in which we live, a day
full of hope and promise for American
business, if we will but take advan
tage of the opportunities that are ours
for the asking. The recent war has
ended our isolation and thrown upon
us a great duty and responsibility.
The United States must share the
expanding world market. The United
States desires for itself only equal op
portunity with the other nations of
the world, and that through the proc
ess of friendly co-operation and fair
competition the legitimate interest of
the nations concerned may be success
fully and equitably adjusted.
Recognition and Relief to Soldiers,
There are other matters of impor
tance upon which I urged action at
the last session of congress which
are still pressing for solution. I am
sure it is not ne essary for me again
to remind you that there is one imme
diate and very practicable question
resulting from the war which we
should meet in the most liberal spirit.
It is a matter of recognition and re
lief to our soldiers. I can do no bet
ter than to quote from my last mes
sage urging this very action:
“We must see to it that our return
ing soldiers are assisted in every prac
ticable way to find the places for
which they are fitted in the daily
work of the country. This can .be
done by developing and maintaining
upon an adequate scale the admirable
organization created by the depart
ment ol labor for placing men seeking
work; and it can also be done in at
least one very great field, by creating
new opportunities for individual en
terprise. The secretary of the inte
rior has pointed out the way by which
returning soldiers may be helped to
find and take up land in the hitherto
undeveloped regions of the country
which the federal government has al
ready prepared or can readily prepare
for cultivation and also on many of
the cut-over or neglected areas which
lie within the limits of the older
states; and I once more take the lib
erty of recommending very urgently
that his plans shall receive the imme
diate and substantial support of con
gress.”
Protection for Dye Industry.
In the matter of tariff legislation I
beg to call your attention to the state
ments contained in my last message
urging legislation with reference to
the establishment of the chemical and
dyestuffs industry in America:
* “Among the industries to which spe
cial consideration should be given is
that of the manufacture of dyestuffs
and related chemicals. Our complete
dependence upon German supplies be
fore the war made the interruption of
trade a cause of exceptional economic
disturbance. The close relation be
tween the manufacture of dyestuffs,
on the one hand, and of explosives and
poisonous g: ses on the other, more
over, has given the industry an excep
tional significance and value. Although
the United States will gladly and un
hesitatingly ioin in the urogram of In-
THE DEMOCRAT, MINERAL POINT, WISCONSIN.
temational disarmament, It will, nev
ertheless, be a policy of obvious pru
dence to make certain of the success
ful maintenance of many strong and
well-equipped chemical plants. The
German chemical industry, with which
we will be brought into competition,
was, and may well be again, a thor
oughly knit monopoly capable of exer
cising a competition of a peculiarly
insidious and dangerous kind.”
Increased Production Is Vital.
During the war the farmer per
formed a vital and willing service to
the nation. By materially increasing
the production of his land he supplied
America and the allies with the in
creased amounts of food necessary to
keep their immense armies in the field.
He indispensably helped to win the
war. But there is now scarcely less
need of increasing the production in
food and the necessaries of life. I ask
the congress to consider means of en
couraging effort along these lines. The
importance of doing everything pos
sible to promote production along eco
nomical lines, to improve marketing
and to make rural life more attractive
and healthful is obvious. I would urge
approval of the plans already proposed
to the congress by the secretary of ag
riculture, to secure the essential facts
required for the proper study of this
question, through the proposed en
larged programs for farm management
studies and crop estimates.
I would urge, also, the continuance
of federal participation in the build
ing of good roads, under the terms of
existing law and under the direction
of present agencies; the need of fur
ther action on the part of the states
and the federal government to pre
serve and develop our forest resources,
especially through the practice of bet
ter forestry methods on private hold
ings and the extension of the publicly
owned forests, better support for coun
try schools and the more definite di
rection of their courses of study along
lines related to rural problems; and
fuller provision fsl* sanitation in rural
districts and the building up of needed
hospital and medical facilities in these
localities. Perhaps the way might be
cleared for many of these desirable
reforms by a fresh comprehensive sur
vey made of rural conditions by a con
ference composed of representatives of
the farmers and of the agricultural
agencies responsible for leadership.
Unrest and Its Causes.
I would call your attention to the
widespread condition of political rest
lessness in our body politic. The
causes of this unrest, while various
and complicated, are superficial rather
than deepseated. Broadly, they arise
from or are connected with the failure
on the part of our government to ar
rive speedily at a just and permanent
peace permitting return to normal con
ditions, from the transfusion of rad
ical theories from seething European
centers pending such delay, from
heartless profiteering resulting in the
increase in the cost of living, and last
ly from the machinations of pessionate
and malevolent agitators. With the
return to normal conditions, this un
rest will rapidly disappear. In the
meantime it does much evil.
It seems to me that in dealing with
this situation congress should not be
impatient or drastic, but should seek
rather to remove the causes. It should
endeavor to bring our country back
speedily to a peace basis with ameli
orated living conditions under the
minimum of restrictions upon personal
liberty that is consistent with our re
construction problems. And it should
arm the federal government with pow
er to deal in its criminal courts with
those persons who by violent methods
would abrogate out time-tested institu
tions. With the free expression of
opinion and with the advocacy of or
derly political change, however funda
mental, there must be no interfer
ence, but toward passion and malev
olence tending to incite crime and in
surrection under guise of political
evolution there should be no leniency.
Legislation to this end has been recom
mended by the attorney general and
should be enacted.
To Reduce Cost of Living.
In this direct connection I would
call your attention to my recommenda
tions on August 8, pointing out legisla
tive measures which would be effec
tive in controlling and bringing down
the present cost of living, which con
tributes so largely to this unrest. If
the government's campaign is to be
effective, it is necessary that the other
steps suggested should be acted on
at once.
I renew and strongly urge the neces
sity of the extension of the present
food control act as to the period of
time in which it shall remain in opera
tion. The attorney general has sub
mitted a bill providing an extension
of this act for a period of six months.
As it now stands it is limited in opera
tion to the period of the war and be
comes inoperative upon the formal
proclamation of peace. It is impera
tive that it should be extended at
once. The department of justice has
built up extensive machinery for the
purpose of enforcing its provisions,
all of which must be abandoned upon
the conclusion of peace unless the
provision of this act are extended.
During this period the congress will
have an opportunity to make similar
permanent provisions and regulations
with regard to all goods destined for
interstate commerce and to exclude
them from interstate shipment if the
requirements of the law are not com
plied with. Some such regulation is
Imperatively necessary. The abuses
that have grown up in the manipula
tion of prices by the withholding of
foodstuffs and other necessaries of life
cannot otherwise be effectively pre
vented. There can be no doubt of
either the necessity or the legitimacy
of such measures.
The failure of other nations to con-
sider this matter in a vigorous way
has produced bitterness and jealousies
and antagonisms, the food of radical
ism. The only way to keep men from
agitaiing against grievances is to re
move the grievances. An unwilling
ness even to discuss these matters
produces only dissatisfaction and gives
comfort to the extreme elements in
our country, which endeavor to stir
up disturbances in order to provoke
governments to embark upon a course
of retaliation and repression. The
seed of revolution is repression. The
remedy for these things must not be
negative in character. It must be
constructive. It must cqmprehend the
general interest. The real antidote
for the unrest which manifests itself
is not suppression but a deep consider
ation of the wrongs that beset our na
tional life and the application of a
remedy.
Capital and Labor.
Congress already has shown its will
ingness to deal as the standard in
every field of labor. It has sought to
find a way to prevent child labor. It
has served the whole country by lead
ing the way in developing the means
of preserving and safeguarding lives
and health in dangerous industries.
It must now help in the difficult task
of finding a method that will bring
about a genuine democratization of in
dustry, based upon the full recognition
of the right of those who work, in
whatever rank, to participate in some
organic way in every decision which
directly affects their welfare. It is
with this purpose in mind that I called
a conference to meet in Washington
on December 1 to consider these prob
lems in all their broad aspects, with
the idea of bringing about a better un
derstanding between these two in
terests.
The great unrest throughout the
world, out of which has emerged a
demand for an immediate considera
tion of the difficulties between capital
and labor, bids us put our own house
in order. Frankly, there can be no per
manent and lasting settlements be
tween capital and labor which do not
recognize the fundamental concepts
for which labor has been struggling
through the years. The whole w r orld
gave its recognition and indorsement
to these fundamental purposes in the
League of Nations.
The statesmen gathered at Ver
sailles recognized the fact that w r orld
stability could not be had by revert
ing to industrial standards and condi
tions against which the average work
man of the wmrld had revolted. It is,
therefore, the task of the statesmen
of this new day of change and read
justment to recognize world conditions
and to seek to bring about through leg
islation conditions that will mean the
ending of age-long antagonisms be
tween capital and labor and that will
hopefully lead to the building up of a
comradeship which will result not only
in greater contentment among the
mass of workmen but also bring about
a greater production and a greater
prosperity to business itself.
Justice in Labors Demands.
To analyze the particulars in the de
mands of labor is to admit the justice
of their complaint in many matters
that lie at their basis.
The workman demands an adequate
wage, sufficient to permit him to live
in comfort, unhampered by the fear
of poverty and want in his old age. He
demands the right to live and the right
to work amidst sanitary surroundings,
both in home and in workshop, sur
roundings that develop and do not re
tard his own health and well-being,
and the right to provide for his chil
dren’s wants in the matter of health
and education. In other words, it is
his desire to make the conditions of
his life and the lives of those dear to
him tolerable and easy to bear.
The establishment of the principles
regarding labor laid down in the cove
nant of the League of Nations offers
us the w r ay to industrial peace and
conciliation. No other road lies open
to us. Not to pursue this one is longer
to invite enmities, bitterness and an
tagonisms, which, in the end, only lead
to industrial and social disaster.
The unwilling workman is not a
profitable servant. An employee whose
industrial life is hedged about by hard
and unjust conditions, which he did
not create and over which he has no
control, lacks that fine spirit of en
thusiasm and volunteer effort which
are necessary ingredients of a great
producing entity.
Let us be frank about this solemn
matter. The evidences of world-wide
unrest which manifest aheraselves in
violence throughout the world bid us
pause and consider the means to be
found to stop the spread of this con
tagious thing before it saps the very
vitality of the nation itself. Do w T e
gain strength by withholding the
remedy? Is it not the business of
statesmen to treat these manifesta
tions of unrest which meet us on
every hand as evidences of an eco
nomic disorder and to apply construc
tive remedies wherever necessary, be
ing sure that in the applicaaion of
the remedy we touch not the vital
tissues of our industrial and economic
life?
There can be no recession of the
tide of unrest until constructive in
strumentalities are set up to stem that
tide.
Governments must recognize the
right of men collectively to bargain
for humane objects that have at their
base the mutual protection and wel
fare of those engaged in all indus
tries.
Labor must not be longer treated as
a commodity.
It must be regarded as the activity
of human beings, possessed of deep
yearnings and desires. The business
man gives his best thought to the re
pair and replenishment of his ma
chinery, so that Its usefulness will
not be Impaired and its power to pro
duce may always be at its height ami
kept in full vigor and motion. No
less regard ought to be paid to the hu
man machine, which, after all, pro
pels the machinery of the world and
Is the great dynamic force that lies
back of all industry and progress.
Old Standards Unthinkable.
Return to the old standards of wage
and industry In employment is un
thinkable. The terrible tragedy of
war w’hich has just ended and which
has brought the world to the verge of
chaos and disaster would be in vain'
if there should ensue a return to the
conditions of the past Europe itself,
whence has come the unrest which
now holds the world at bay, is an ex
ample of standpatism in these vital
human matters which America might
well accept an example, not to be
followed, but studiously to be avoided.
Europe made labor the differential,
and the price of it all is enmity and an
tagonism and prostrated industry.
The right of labor to live in peace
and comfort must be recognized by
governments, and America should be
the first to lay the foundation stones
upon wdiich industrial peace shall be
built.
Labor not only is entitled to an
adequate wage, but capital should re
ceive a reasonable return upon its in
vestment and is entitled to protection
at the hands of the government in
every emergency. No government
worthy of the name can “play” these
elements against each other, for there
is a mutuality of interest between
them which the government must seek
to express and to safeguard at all
cost.
The right of individuals to strike is
inviolate and ought not to be inter
fered with by any process of govern
ment, but there is a predominant right,
and that is the right of the government
to protect all of Its people and to as
sert its power and majesty against the
challenge of any class.
Defends Rights of People.
The government, when it asserts
that right, seeks not to antagonize
a class, but simply to defend the right
of the whole people as against the
irreparable harm and injury that
might be done by the attempt of any
class to usurp a power that only gov
ernment itself has a right to exercise
as a protection to all.
In the matter of international dis
putes which have led to war, states
men have sought to set up as a rem
edy arbitration for war. Does this
not point the way for the settlement
of industrial disputes by the establish
ment of a tribunal, fair and just alike
to all, which will settle industrial dis
putes which in the past have led to
war and disaster?
America, witnessing the evil conse
quences which have followed out of
such disputes between the contending
forces, must not aiimit itself impotent
to deal with these matters by means
of peaceful processes. Surely there
must be some method of bringing to
gether in a council of peace and amity
these two great interests, out of which
will come a happier day of peace and
co-operation, a day that will make for
more comfort and happiness in living
and more tolerable conditions among
all classes of men. Certainly human
Intelligence can devise some accept
able tribunal for adjusting the differ
ences between capital and labor.
Hour of Test and Trial.
This is the hour of test and trial
for America. By her prowess and
strength and the indomitable courage
of her soldiers she demonstrated her
power to vindicate on foreign battle
fields her conception of liberty and
justice.
Let not her influence as a mediator
between capital and labor be weak
ened and her own failure to settle
matters of purely domestic concern
be proclaimed to the world. There
are those in this country who threaten
'direct action to force their will upon
a majority.
Russia today, with its blood and
terror, is a painful object lesson of
the power of minorities. It makes lit
tle difference what minority it is;
whether capital or labor, or any other
class; no sort of privilege will ever
be permitted to dominate this coun
try.
We are a partnership or nothing
that is worth while.
We are a democracy, where the ma
jority are the masters, or all the hopes
and purposes of the men who founded
this government have been defeated
and forgotten.
In America there is but one way by
which great reforms can be accom
plished and the relief sought by class
ed obtained, and that is through the
orderly processes of representative
government. Those who would pro
pose any other method of reform are
enemies of this country. America
will not be daunted by threats nor
lose her composure or calmness in
these distressing times. We can af
ford, in the midst of this day of pas
sion and unrest, to be self-contained
and sure. The instrument of all re
form in America is the straight road
of justice to all classes and condition#
of men. Men have but to follow thifc
road to realize the full fruition of
their objects and purposes. Let those
beware who would take the shorter
road of disorder and revolution.
The right road is the road of justice
and orderly process.
Start Health Crusade.
That the children of the world shall
be “physically tit” Is the ideal of the
modern health crusade of the Junior
Red Cross and Anti-Tuberculosis asso
ciation. In one small Ohio town 7,000
toothbrushes are at work on teeth that
had never been cared for until it was
made one of the “chores” of the cru
saders.

MINERS ARE OFFERED 14
PER CENT INCREASE
Raise in Price of Coal Is Prohibited In
Decision of the Gov
ernment.
Washington, Nov. 27. —Acting under
instructions from the cabinet. United
States Fuel Administrator Garfield
told the coal miners and the operators
that the wage increase for the miners
should be 14 per cent and that the
price of coal to the public should not
be raised.
This declaration, coming from the
government as a basis for settling the
wage controversy, was received with
great dissatisfaction by both the
miners and the operators.
Some of the miners’ representatives
declared that the offer of a 14 per cent
increase, in the face of the fact that
Secretary of Labor Wilson had of
fered them 31.6 per cent, was an In
sult. They declared that the miners
would starve idle rather than go back
to the mines at this wage increase.
The operators, who have been ex
pecting that the government would see
them through on any wage increase,
declared that their margins would not
permit them to give the miners the 14
per cent out of their own pockets.
They said that it would break many of
the weaker mines and that it meant
ruin and sacrifice of years of earnings
and savings.
The operators for the most part
bore their disappointment in silence,
but from the miners came denuncia
tion after denunciation of the govern
ment’s solution. Without reservation,
and without mincing words, the miners
questioned Doctor Garfield and,
through him, grilled the government
for more than two hours.

TAX EVADERS FACE PENALTY
Warning Given by Commissioner Ro

Washington. Nov. 29. —Warning was
given tax evaders by Revenue Com
missioner Roper that those who have
falsified or made incorrect returns
may expect “to be called upon any day
for an accounting.” No leniency will
be shown corporations or individuals
who have attempted to defraud the
government, the commissioner said.
The government’s drive on fax evad

$200,000,000 more than the amount
called for by the returns filed early In
