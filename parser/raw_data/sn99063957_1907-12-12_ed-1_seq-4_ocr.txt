Chicago teaohors have strayed too
far from tho "little old rod school

nnd 'rlthmotlc." The trouble start
ed whon oneof tho trustees told of
tho failure of pupils In tho eighth
and ninth grndos to spoil such simple
words as "frlond," "medium," and
"rival." Horo are a few of the
longer words that wero successfully
misspelled by the pupils: "opera

"Intorrupt," "attempted," "exercise,"
"anxiety," "experiment" and "Invin

not ono of 43 fifteen-year-old nunlls
