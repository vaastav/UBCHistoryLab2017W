We would direct attention the ad
vertisement of 'Mr. Peter Bacon, who
has just commenced business in our
midst. Persons wishing to have
anything done in the way of ma
chinery, should give him a trial.
Cotton is being brought in our city
pretty freely, and seems to meet with
a ready sale. Cotton, wool and hogs,
is all that seems to engross the minds
of our merchants.
Subscribers who fail to get their
paper regularly, will please notify us
of the same.
The editor of the Nacogdoches
Chronicle, is desirous of adding to
his list, the names of 500 cash sub
scribers. Let an example be made
of him.
Why is it that we do not get the
Vickburg Sun more than about three
times a week ? Is paper getting
ecarce neighbor? The Shreveport
package always arrives when due, but
we seem to be slighted. The Whig
never fails, why should the Sun ?
Our folks now enjoy themselves at
night, by going to hunt o'possums.
Between the blowing of horns and the
yelling of hounds, a person unused
to the noise would imagine the devil
and his imps were holding a levee.
Our postmaster informs us that he
has received.the long needed postage
stamps. This will prove quite a re
iet to our people who may desire
mpT. letters when the postoffice is
mot-dpen.
The Voice of Teanessee.
On the, 10th inst. Mr. Cardwell, of
Weakly county, introduced the fol
lowing resolutions, which we clip
from the Memphis Appeal, they are
in response to that ridiculous propo
sition of Saulsbury, of Delaware, rel
ative to appointing Commissioners of
Peace to confer with others to be ap
pointed by the Confederate States,
laid before the U. S. Congress not
long since, and informally placed
over by that body.
The resolutions offered by Mr. C.
were referred to the Committee on
Confederate relations, and will, of
course, says our cotemperary, be una
nimously passed :
A RESOLUTION,
Expressive of the opinion of the Legislature
of Tennessee in regard to our ftiture policy
and determination to maintain our Dec
laration of Independence of the old gov
ernment of the United States.
Resolred by the General Assembly
of the State of Tennessee, As its
unanimous sense, that any and all
propositions of the Congress of the
(so-called) United States of America
to reconstruct a Union which they
have prostituted to the base purposes
of annihilating the liberties, tramp
pling upon the rights, destroying the
lives and plundering the people of
the Confederate States, thus driving
them to the assertion of their inde
pendence and the formation of a new
Confederacy, for the maintenance of
their inalienable rights and the pres
ervation of their sovereignty, is but
another form which our enemies would
subjugate the South and reduce us
to the despotism of their degraded
doctrines, and that we cannot view
any such proposition of reconstruction
iu any other light than as a crowning
insult to our intelligence and man
hood, to thus approach us after the
acts of rapine, murder and barbarity
which have marked tlhir inhuman
invasion of our territory; and that
ally such proposition shiould be met
lpromptly and unhlesitatingly with
our indignant rt:ejecti,,n.
ITsresalr, T'Ihat the secret sympa
tlhizer.- of Lincolnism in the South,
if any th.re be,, who may favor any
such insulting approach of our enemy,
deserve to be branded as traitors to
the South and enemies to their coun
try.
Resolred, That any commissioners
appointed by the Lincoln Congress
at Washington to the goverment of
the Confederates States, having for
the object of its mission a reconstruc
tion of the old Union, should be at
once promptly rejected by the gov
ernment of the ('conftlerat,: Sta;.s.
llesol'cd, T'I',hat the" ('o)ltederate
States and their leople ar,lIt.i ly de
sire a peaceful solution of existing
difficulties with the N'orthern States,
and that honorable pe:e, guara:intete
ing ourindepmend-m-t.e, wonhil hI.hniled
bly our peo,1le with joy and satisfac
tion, hut. that having taken ti up arms
to achieve our independence of a
governmIent whichli has cruelly perse
cuted anl olrl,r.ssed us, and which
has shown a deter.rmination to over
rlnl ev-, gol:Nar:tette of our constitu
tion'l rights, by a long train of
abuses and usurpations, the people of
Tennessee cannot with honor and
safety to themselves, and security to
their posterity, consent to any treaty
which shall not recognize our entire
independence of any political con
nection with the government of the
(so-called) United States.
Rsoltved, That thie Governor be
requested to forward a copy of these
resolutions to each of our Represen
tatives in Congress, and also a copy
to each of the Governors of the Con
federate States, with a request that
they be laid before their respective
State Legislatures.
Arms oIiarn EI gI for the Coafed
eoate States.
The New York Herald publishes a
letter from London, dated November
9th, addressed to its editors, and
signed by George Francis Train.
We take therefrom the following in
teresting extract:
I have seen one, two, three vessels
load under my very face with cannon,
riflesshoes and blankets for the South
ern conspirators.
Tussier took in eighteen large
rifled guns, two one hundred and
twenty pound Whitworths, 7500
Enfield, 18,000 Belgian rifles, 90,000
pairs of shoes, and 90,000 overcoats
in the Bermuda. The Fingal left the
Scottish shore a fortnight since with
a duplicate cargo. The Thomas
Watson, I am glad to see, has been
sunk off Charleston. One or two
other vessels are now due at the pirate
rendezvous; but this letter, made
public through your columns, is to
make sure and stop the Gladiator,
eighty horse power, 600 tuns; steam
packet, held by Bake, Adam & Co.,
loaded by the "Private Joint Stock
Company" (unlimited) of English
and southern Secessionists, with
600 cases rifles, cannon, shoes, blan
kets, provisions, and a large quantity
of gunpowder, wich she took in last
night at Erith. She clears to-day
for Teneriff and Nassan.
I have given all these particulars
to N. B. Marchand, Esq., commander
of the United States war steamer
James Adger, just arrived at South
amupton, via Queenstown and Fal
mount.one hundred and sixty-three
men and nine guns. who is fully alive
to capturing this English pirate-
estimated value of cargo £60,000
having on board the requisites for an
army of 25,000 men. The chief men
in the company are reported to bel
Sabel, passenger and ship broker,
Liverpool; Capt. W. D. IHughes,
southerner; I'rielard, Charleston firm
of Frazer, Newholm & Co, Liverpool;
Bake, Adam & Co., purchasers and
dispatches of the steamer ; and Iasc,
Campbell & Co., army outfitters,
Germyn street, London. The busi
ness is done in shares and so profita
ble that if two ships are taken the
Bermuda's profits will cover the loss
of the others. Capt. Bird will go in
eommand, Ilorrop as mate, Hugher,
as supercargo.
I learn that the Secessionists are
negotiating for the Punjaub and
Assayo, 1800 tuns each, 500 hore
power, and Malabar Steak, three
deckers; steam eleven to fourteen
knots; would cost to build $1,.00,
000; price asked for them. £80,000.
They are East India men-of-war, and
government asks bonds for $8800,000
that they shall not go to America.
What does this mean! (ioverumnnt
has also lately sold, or offered to sell
nine condemned sloops-of-war, such
as the Carysfort, to a party who is
said to have sold them to the south
ern navy department.
From Tylce.-The steamer Ida
arrived last evening from Fort ]'ulas
ki, but brought no intelligence of in
terest. We learn that the Yankeesc
have sunk two of their old hulks
abreast of the big light, where they
serve as a kind of a wharf. They
engaged a part of Yesterday in land
ing something from the beached ves
sels, but it was impossible to see
what they were bringing on shore.
They had four drays and horses en
gaged in hauling their articles from
the beach.
During the day a small party of
them visited Mr. King's phee, and
were seen driving off four of his cows.
There were four men-of-war inside
the bar, and some fifteen or more old
vessels.
Early yesterday morning a number
of their sailing vessels passed over
the bar, but in the course of a few
hours all of them returned to their
former position. '.Jle report that the
federals were engaged in erecting
fortifications on the island is not con
firmed, and the impression among in
telligent persons is that they are
waiting for reinforcemennts. No for
tifications have been thrown up on
Tybee, as far as our scouts can dis
cover.-Savannah News D)ec. 10.
Reported Capture of a C onfl;:l,,/rat,
S'py.-T''he Washington telegraphic
correspondent of the New York
Times, dated December 4th, says:
A Confederate spy, who lhas been
in the habit for a long time, as he
himself acknowledges, of visiting our
lines for the purpose of obtaining in
formation for the Confederates, was
captured yesterday, about six miles
below Alexandria, by parties selt
out from Gen. Jamison's brigade.
His moodus operandi was as follows:
Crossing the Occoquan river in a
small boat, he managed to sink it to
.revent its being discovered, at the
same time hiding the oars in the
woods. At night time lie would
emerge from the woods and elude the
pickets, arriving in Alexandria, where
ie would get his budget of inforuma
tion, together with tlhe- New York and
ither papers, anld leave at once for the
Confederate lines. lie is now in the
posse.ssion of Gen. leinzelhnan, and
will be handed over to the Government.
Lincoln's illessaa, in IVanseingtun.
-The following dispatch is taken
from the New York Times of the 4th:
The nnivertal topic of conversation
in Washington to-day is the Presi
dent's message. Opinions about it
differ as widely as do the partisan
preferences of the people. The ultra
abolition element in Congress is sorely
disappointed by the utter failure of
their efforts to engraft their principles
either in the President's message or
in any of the Secretaries' reports.
T'his class of politicians declare the
message to le ttame and ineffective.
)On the other hand, the moderate men
of all parties are highly pleased.
They are quite enthusiastic in praise
of Mr. Lincdn. Knowing the tre
muendous pressure that has been
brught to bear upon him to swerve
him fromn his plnrpose, they declare
that he is now fully tried, and found
the man of firmnless necessary to his
posit ion.
In these days of strife, when
every mail is expected to bring start
ling particulars of s',nme kind, how
sadly disappointed is the intelligent
public at thei nin-receipt of anything
tending in that way, true, we are
inforimed ly every telegram that an
engagement is hIourly elxpete'J, which
we are free to admit, has a powerful
teuldencv o(,f allaying the crushed
hcpes of the eager news-seeker. For
the past few days we have not been
placed in possession of any passing
events worth the time occupied in pe
rusing them.
Northern accounts received" only
recount particulars of the imbroglio
between the F]ederals, which by the
way, will not help our cause in the
least, as some of our wiseacre predict
and so interpret to the edification of
a few listeners. The dispute between
the politicians and the leaders is not
concerning what shall be done, but
how it is be done, for they all aim at
the one and same thing.
We report a slight rise in the river
at this point; weather remarkably
pleasant.
