?Washington, D. C, Dec. 6, 1897.
President McKinley t-o-day sent Iiis
annual message to Congress congratu?
lating it upon reassembling under
felicitous conditions, calling for grate?
ful acknowledgement to a henellelent
providence which hns so signally
blessed and proBpered us as a nation.
PeAce and good will with nil the na?
tions of the earth continue unbroken,
he says. He also expresses genuine
satisfaction at the growing spirit of
fraternal regard and the unification of
all sections of our country, upon the
universal spirit of patriotism and the
lifting of great puhllc questions above
party prejudice and sectional differ?
ence. V.
Contrary to the usual custom which
has led to the treatment of matters of
foreign relations in the beginning of
tbe message, President MclOnley de?
votes his attention first to the financial
question, of which he says:
"The extra session of this Congress,
which closed during July last, enacted
important legislation, and while Hs full
effect bas not yet been realized, what
It has already accomplished ?assures
u.i of Ms timeliness and wisdom. To
test Its permanent value further time
will be required, and the people, sat?
isfied with Its operation and results
thus far, are In no mind to withhold
from It a fair trial.
THE CTJRRiBKOY QUESTION.
?'Tariff legislation having been set?
tled by the extra session of Congress,
the question next pressing for consid?
eration In that of the currency.
"The work of putting our finances
upon a sound basis, (lltllcult as It may
seem, will appear easier when we r?.
oall the financial operations of the
Government since 1800. On the 13lh
day of June of tha<t year we had out?
standing demand liabilities in the sum
of I72S.86S.4-I7.71. On the 1st of Jan?
uary, 1879. these liabilities had been
reduced to $443.889,49r..ss. Of our Inter?
est-bearing' obligations the figures are
even more strlkln*. On July 1. lSCti,
the principal of the Interest-bearing
debt of the Government was $2,332,331.
208. On the 1st day of July 1893, this
sum had been reduced to $isr>,037.100,
or an aggregate reduction of $1,747,294,
108. The Interest-bearing debt of the
United atnles cn 'the 1st day of l>fcem
ber, 1897. was $817,300.020. The Govern?
ment money now outstanding U'ecom
h?r 1) consists of ?346.081,010 of United
States notes, J107.793.2S0 of Treasury
!"! notes Issued by authority of the law of
18?0, $384,963,604 of sliver certificates
and $61,280,781 of standard silver dollars.
"With the great resources of the
Government ami with the liofioraTTle
example of |the past before us, we
ought not t<> hesitate to enter upon a
currency revision which will make our
demand obligations loss onerous to the
Government and relieve our financial
laws from ambiguity and doubt.
?The hrlef review of what was ac?
complished from the close of the war to
1893 makes unreasonable and ground?
less any distrust either of our financial
ability or soundness, while the situation
from 1893 to 1897 must admonlBh Con?
gress of the Immediate necessary of so
legislating as to muke the return of the
conditions then prevailing Impossible.
"There are many plans proposed as a
remedy for the evil. Before we can
find the true remedy we must appre?
ciate the real evil. It Is not That our
currency of every kind Is not good, for
every dollar Of It Is good?good because
the Government's pledge Is oul to keen
It so?and that pledge will not be
broken. However, the guaranty of our
purpose to keep the pledge will ho best
shown by advancing toward Its fulfill?
ment.
"The evil of the present system Is
found in the great cost to the Govern?
ment of maintaining the parity of our
different- forms of money, that Is, keep?
ing all of them at par with gold. Wo
surely ennnot be longer heedless of the
burden this Imposes upon the people,
even under fairly prosperous condi?
tions, while the past four years have
demonstrated that, It Is not only an
expensive charge upon the Government,
but a dangerous menace to the national
credit.
"It is mnnlfest th.-vt we must devise
some plan to protect the (iovernment
agstlnst bond Issues for repeated re?
demptions. We must either curtail the
opportunity for speculation, made easy
by the multiplied redemptions of our
demand obligations, or Increase the
gold reserve for their redumption. We
have $'J00,000,000 of currency, which the
Government by solemn enactment has
undertaken to keep flit par with gold.
Nobody Is obliged to redeem In gold but
the Government. The banks are nod.
required to redeem In gold. The Gov?
ernment Is obliged to keep equal with
gold all Its outstanding currency and
coin obligations, while Its receipts arJ
not required to be paid In every kind
of money, but gold, and the only means
by which the Government caet with cer?
tainty get gold, Is by borrowing. It can
get It In no other way when It most
needs IL The Government, without any
fixed gold revenue, is pledged to main?
tain gold redemption, which It has
steadily and faithfully done, and which
under the authority now given It will
continue to do.
"The law which requires the Govern?
ment after having redeemed Its United
Stats notes to pay them out again as
currency funds, demands a constant re
plecilsihmcnt of the gold reserve. This
Is especially so at limes of business
panic and when the revenues are In
sufilclcnt to meet the expenses of the
Government. At such times the Gov?
ernment has no other way to supply!
Its deficit and maintain redemption but
through the increase of its bended debt, t
as during the administration of my
predecessor, when $202,31.1,400 of four
and a half per cent, bonds were Issued
and' sidd and the proceeds used to pay |
the expenses of the Government In ex?
cess of the revenues and sustain the
gold reserve. While It Is ?true that the
greater part of the proceeds of these]
bonds were used to supply dWlclrait
revenues, a considerable portion was
required to maintain the gokl reserve.
"With our revenue equal to our ex?
penses, there would bo no deficit re?
quiring the Issuance ofhootds. But if
the g.u 1 reserve falls below $100,000,000
how will It be replenished except by
selling more bonds? Ts there any other
practicable way under existing law?
The serious question Iben Is shall we
con Unite the policy that has bei?i pur?
sued In the past; that Is. when the gold
reserve reaches the point of danger. Is?
sue more bonds and supply the needed
gftld. or shall we provide other means to
prevent the.se recurring drains upon the
gold reserve? If no further legislation
Is had and the policy of selling bonds
Is to be continued, then Congress
should give -the Secretary of the Trea?
sury authority to sell bonds nt long or
short periods, bearing a less rate of in?
terest than Is now authorized by law.
"I earnestly recommend as soon as
the receipts of the Government are
quite sutllclent to pay all the expenses
of the Government, that when any of
the United States notes are presented
far redemptlcm. In gold, and are re?
deemed In gold; such notes shall be
kept and sot apart and only paid out
In exchange for gold. This la an ob?
vious duty. If the holder of the United
States notes prefers the gold and gets
It from the Clovernment he should not
receive back from the Government a
United States note without paying gold
In exchange for it. The reason for
this Is made all the more apparent
when the Government Issues an Inter?
est-bearing debt to provide gold for the
redemption of United States notes?a
non-lnterc?.t~benr>ig debt. Surely II
should not pay them out again except
on demand and for gold. If they arc
put out In any other way they may re?
turn again, to be followed by another
bond Issue to redeem them?another In?
terest-bearing debt to redeem a non
Interest-bearing debt.
"In my view, It ia of the utmost Im?
portlance thai: the Government should
?be relieved from the burden of provid?
ing tall the gold required tor exchange
and export. This 'responsibility Is alone
borne by the Government without any
of the usual and necessary banking
powers to help Itself. The banks do not
?feel the strain of gold redemption. The
whole strain rests upon Ohe Government
and 'the size of the gold reserve in the
Treasury has come to be, With or with?
out reason, the signal of d'tnger or of
security. This ought to be stopped.
"if we are to have an era of prosperity
In the country, with suflloletv! receipts
for the expenses of the Government, we
may feel no Immediate embarrassment
from our present currency; but the
danger still ex'.-vs and will be ever pres?
ent meiaaclns ussci long as the existing
system continues. And besides it 1s In
times or adequate revenues and busi?
ness tt-anqullity that! the Government
should prepare for'the worst. We can?
not avoid without serious consequences,
the wipe consideration and prompt solu?
tion of this question.
"The Secretary e.f the Treasury ha;>
Outlined a plan In great detail, for the
purpose *of removing the threatened re
currence of a depleted gold reserve, and
save us from future embarrassment:, on
that account. To this plan I Invite your
careful consideration}.
"I concur with t'he Secretary of Uie
Treasury in Wb recommendation that
national banks be allowed to Issue notes
to -the face value of the bonds which
they Waive deposited for circulation, and
that -tihe tax on circulating notes secur?
ed by deposit of .such bonds be reduced
to one half of one per cent, per nnnun\.
I also Join hilm 1n recommending that
authority be given for Wie establishment
of naitlonal banks with 'a minimum capi?
tal of $25,000. This will enable the
smaller villages and agricultural regions
of the country to be supplied with cur?
rency to meet the.tr demands.
"I reoommrcend that the Issue of nation?
al hank notes be restricted to the de?
nomination of terr dollars and upward-".
If l-'he suggestions I have berein made
shall have the approval of Congress.
Milien I would recommend that national
hanks be required to redeem their notes
In gold." v.
CUBA 'A7sTD SPAIN.
Turning to foreign affairs, the Presi?
dent devotes a great part of his message
to a consideration of the Cuban ques?
tion which, lie sa.ys is the most import?
ant problem wltlh which this govetn
merrt Is now called upon to deal pertain?
ing 'lv> tts foreign relations. The story
of Cuba haa, for many years, been one
of unreal ant} for no enduring period
has it ceased to cause concern to the
United States. Briefly summarizing
t'he history of former outbreaks and of
the part played by Geqieral Grant. In the
last war, the President, coming down
to the present Insurrection, speaks of its
remarkable Increaoe, *ts tenacious ex?
istence against the enormous forces
massed by Spain, the widespread de?
struction of property, and the disregard
of tbe civilized code of war no less by
t'he Spaniards than by tbe Cubans. He
says:
"Tbe existing conditions cannot but
fill the Government, and the American,
people, with the gravest apprehension.
Teuere Is no desire on tbe part of our
people to profV. by the misfortunes of
Spain. We have only the desire to see
the Cubans prosperous and contented,
enjoying That measure of self control
which Is the Inalienable right of Man,
protected In their right tOTeap the bene?
fit of the exhaustless treasures of their
country.
Continuing, the President says Iflia-t
?the offer made by his prcrtocensor In
April, 1896, of the good office." of this
government failed. The cruel policy of
concentration was Initiated -in February,
1S96. It has utterly failed ns a. war
measure. H was not civilized warfare
?It was exilbrrrrinatlon, says the Presi?
dent. Against this abuse of the rights
of war he his felt conj'tralned on re?
peated occasions to enter the firm and
earner protest of this government. He
made in.stant demand fi>r the release or
speedy trial of all American citizens un?
der arrest, and before the change of the
Spanish cabinet in October last, twenty
two prisoners, citizens of the United
States, h'3'tl been given their freedom.
The inert ru at tons to Minister Wood
ford directed him to impress upon the
Spanish Government the sincere wish of
the United States to lend i:? aid towards
vhe ending of tbe war by reaching a
peaceful and lasting result. Just and
honorv.ible alike to Spain and the
Cu-Hin people. It was also
asked whether Spain of her own
Violation, moved by her own Interests
and sentiments of humanity, should not
make proposals of settlement, and It
was said thai we could not contemplate
an Indefinite period for the aeeompllsh
ment of this result. No solution was
proposed to which the flllghitest Idea of
humiliation to Spain could attach. All
that was asked or expected, was that
some safe way might! be speedily pro?
vided and permanent peace restored.
The President ref?rs to the change In
the Spanish eablnent about this time
and continuing, says:
"The reply ?? our note was in the di?
rection a better understanding. It
appreciates the f lendly purposes of this
Government. It ?rtmitn oh at our coun?
try is deeply affected by the Cuban
wa r.
"It declare." that the present Spanish
Oovernimen! Is bound by every consid?
eration te> a change of pulley that should
MHtlsfy Wie United States and pacify
Cuba wtth>lri a reasonable time. To (this
end Spain has decided to put into e?f_oct
the politicl-l reforms heretofore advo?
cated by the present premier, without
halting f\>r any consideration In the
path "which In Its Judgment leads to
peace. The mill Hary operations, lit Is
sold, will continue but will be humane
and conducted with all regard for pri?
vate rights, being accompanied by po?
litical action leading to She autonomy of
Cuba while guarding Spanish Sover?
eignty."
It further suggests that Spain be left
free to condu^i' the mllMory operations
and grant political reforms while the
United Slates for Its patrt shall enforce
neutral obligations ami "etui off the as?
sistance wnieh. It h* asserted, the In?
surgents receive from this country. The
supposition of nn Indefinite prologatllon
of the war Is denied and complete and
early pacification Is hopvil for ivtolch,
wlWi the .Immediate amelioration of ex?
isting condition.* In Cuba, would remove!
en tine for any change of attitude on the;
part of the United States. Spain shows j
an apparent disposition to charge us
with failure to meet International du tie? I
.md this charge, says the President, isi
Without any bawls of fact. Tt could not
have been made If Spain had been cog?
nizant' of the constant efforts this gov?
ernment has mti.de at the cost of mil?
lions and by the employment of the ad?
ministrative m&ohtnery or the nation to
perform Us full duty. That It has sue-;
cessfuMy prevented the departure of a1
single military expedition or armed ves?
sel from our shore In violation of our
laws would seem to be a sufficient an?
swer and due response to this charge

(Special Dispatch to The Virginian.)
Richmond, Va., Dec. C. 1S97.
One bill of local interest 'to the Nor?
folk section was Introduced in the
House to-day. It wits by Mr. Oooke
and amends the charter of the Norfolk
and Atlantic Terminal company by ex?
tending iHie .time two years from -the
passage of this act for work to begin
on the toll bridge over Tanner's Creek.
Work is to be completed within five
years from the passage of the bill.
Most of the members from the Nor?
folk section spent Sunday at '? shie, but
all were In their scats when Senate
and House met to-day. In Senator
Maynard, w'ho Is to become chairman
of the Important Committee on Roads,
and Senator Foster, Delegates Cooke,
Bland, Klzer, Newbernc and Sncad the
Norfolk section has representatives
who will be among the most lntlucnllnl
members of Uie two houses.
There was not very much of general
interest dctio in either body to-day.
One of the most Important Hills offered
was one by Delegate Charles O. Klzer,
of Norfolk, to establish a bureau of
labor and Industrial statistics and de?
fining the duties of the some. Similar
bills have been offered at previous
sessions, but have failed to pass be?
cause their patrons fell no peculiar In?
terest in the matter. Mr. Klzer thinks
such a bureau Is really needed aind he
intends to make a tlg'ht In committee
and on the HOor for his bill.
The retrenchment and reform fever
Is Still spreading and Is assuming such
proportions as to greatly alarm some
of the office-holders. Senator Darks
dale offered a bill to-day to nbollsh Die
Office or Register of Hand Olllce and to
have the Secretary or Ih" Common?
wealth discharge the duties of that
position without any extra compensa?
tion or any fees. The measure was
referred.
In the House Mr. Tttrple had a reso?
lution passed looking to the appoint?
ment or a committee to investigate and
report as (o whether or not the otllee of
Secretary of Commonwealth. Second
Auditor and Register of Hand Office
could be dispensed with.
As soon as the standing committees
are appointed they will have many
propositions to deal with looking to
cutting down the number of offices and
reducing salaries. Retrenchment and
reform are certainly popular with the
law-makers at this time. One distin?
guished member says he fears the
General Assembly will go reform mad
and there will be necessity Jf reform?
ing the formers. Many measuroe
looking to abolishing offices and cutting
down expenses will be Introduced this
week. The average member feels that
he is not carrying out his pledge to
his people unless he makes a proposi?
tion -to abolish some one's office, it
must be remembered that in a few
years the St ile will 'have to meet ah
increase or J1SO.00O a year In the" Inter?
est on the State debt.
Delegate diaries Smith, of North?
ampton, offered a bill of general In?
terest; H contemplates the suppression
of trusts, combinations or other con?
tracts or agreements tending to restrict
or restrain trade. The bill declares
unlawful and void all arrangements,
contracts, agreements, trusts or com?
binations between persins or corpora?
tions designed or Which tends to re?
duce or advance the price of products
or articles produced or manufactured.
The Senate committees will be named
to-morrow. That Is, they will be re?
pined to a caucus or Democratic Sehr
storS arter the Senate adjourns, and
the list will be submitted to the Sen?
ate on Wednesday. S|x?aker Ryan ex?
pects to have the House committees
ready by to-morrow. Both houses will
be in good working shape by Thursday.
A Joint resolution ottered by Dele
pate W. H. Mann passed both bodies.
It provides ror electing a Fciited States
Senator on Tuesday, December 14th.
Senator Daniel Is expected to bo In the
city on that date.
The following was offered by Mr. Ople
In the Sen-ate:
He It resolved. That the Auditor o?
Public Accounts be", and Is hereby In?
structed, to report to the Senate as fol?
lows:
1 The amount of funds now In the
State Tfrea?ury.
2. The amount of annual revenue of
the State.
Tihe amount >-i annual expendi?
tures of tlie State;
4. What amount will be required to
meet the interest of the State debt due
and payable in the year 1?01.
Mr. Ople asked for the immediate con
Bldcraiti it of the paper.
The vote on suspending Mio rules was
ayes, 10; noes, 10; anil -the motion was
lost.
A resolution was offered by MY. Mason
In the Senate providing for a Joint com?
mit teee to Invkte the State of Maryland
to co-operate wflth Virginia In establish?
ing 'and settling the true boundary line
between 'the two State? along the Polo
mac river from the Great Falls to the
mouiii of river.
Mr. Mushbao.h called attention to the
fact that the District of Columbia was
affected by a part of till Is boundary line,
and suggested tiir.vt It would be well to
nmend the resolution so as to meet this
condition. Mr. Mason withdrew the reso?
lution temporarily in order that such an
amendment might be prepared.
Delegate T. C. Plloher. of Fauqiiicr,
Introduced the following bill, which, un?
der ?uspenslon of the rules, was placed
on the calendar:
"To ineor|>orate the Vlrglnln Alaska
Gold Mining Company." The bill names
as corporators the following well
known gentlemen; A. S. Buford, Rich
mond; Tasewel) Elicit, Richmond; J.
Thompson Brown, Nelson county; A. D.
Watklns, Prince Kdwaird county; Tt. C.

mond. The capital stock Is to l>e not
less i:hau $20.000 nor more than $100.000,
and the company may operate In any
Slate or In any foreign county. When
Mr. Pllcher announced the title of the
bill Mr. Merrltt T. Cookc arose to ob
Jecil to any action being taken on It at
this time, but he was Informed that tbe
required cheek for I'he oha'hrtor fee had
?been banded to the clerk. The bill,
therefore, went on 'the calendar.
The HtOUSC pas.=ved Senate bill repeal?
