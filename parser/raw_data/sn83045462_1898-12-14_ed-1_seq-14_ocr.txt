THE TRUE STORY
OF THE
Confiding Woman, the Cynical Man
and the Bearded Lady.
The scene is a comfortable sitting
room. Mr. Lovegood is buried in a j
book and his wife is scanning the ad
vertisements in the evening paper.
Suddenly Mr--. Loveg'iod savs, "Sav!
dear, in a voice that made Mr.
Lovegoml almost drop his book.
"Well, what is it.-'" lie savs with a
laugh, "another real genuine bar
gain offer."" "I don't know that
you d call it that," his wife replied.
"Hut. yes. you might.'* she continued,
"for it i- a bargain offer of free medi
cal advice." "Let's hear all about it.
my dear," said her husband. "But
you know I'm a little dubious about
your bargains. Your "swans so of
ten turn out to be geese. Well.
then, it's an offer bv a woman (phy
sician) to give free medical advice bv
letter, and it savs it's better to write
to a woman, because a man can't
understand a woman, just because
he s a man, and it says, too. that it's
just revolting to go to a man physi-!
cian. anyhow. And Mrs. Love
good stopped because she was out of
breath.
'I bet you," said her husband,
"that the advertisement don't say
she's a woman physician." "Why,
yes it does," said his wife, as she
looked at the advertisement again.
W ell. no. 1 guess it doesn't sav she's
a physician, but it means the same
thing, for it says that "it is a woman
whose experience in treating wo
man s diseases is greater than that
of any living physician, male or fe
male. Mr. Lovegood chuckled and
said. That s what I love about vou,
my dear. ^ on arc so ready to be
lieve without question when there's
a bargain in view. If you were a lit
tle fish. I'd catch you every time with
a rubber worm if I put a bargain
sign above the hook."
(>h! do be serious for once." cried
Mrs. Lovegood. "Then, to be
serious, he replied, "this woman
(loesn t claim to Ik' a physician. She
would claim to be a phvsician if she
could, because she is trving to con
\e\ the impression in every other
way than by a direct claim that she is
a phvsician. She is not therefore a
phv sician and can never have prac
ticed medicine. et not being a phy
sician and therefore never having
practiced medicine, she claims to
have had 'experience in treating wo
man s diseases, greater than anv liv
ing physician. Xow the question
i";. since she n ver practiced medi
cine, where did she get that experi
ence?"
W ell. that is so." Mrs. Lovegood
somewhat reluctantly admitted, "but
then she is a woman." "I'm not so
sure about that even," said her hus
band. " It looks to me as if some
mar was 'working' the woman with
the 'bearded ladv' act." *
bearded lady act! Do vou mean
to say they have dime museum
freaks for doctors.-' Why. vou must
he foolish, or else amazingly pre
judiced," cried his wife.
^ on. are too liberal, my dear,"
said Mr Lovegood. "What I mean
by the 'bearded lady" act is that some
man is posing as a woman, writing
over a woman's signature or using
a woman as a stalking horse, assum
ing a woman's character to mislead.
1 he bearded lady of the show is al
ways a freak and generally a fraud.
1 he point in this advertisement we
are discussing is that you are asked
to write to a woman,' the implica
tion being that the woman is com
]>t Hut to give and will give vou quali
fied and valuable medical advice.
But as it isn't specified that the wo
man i- a physician there's no in
fraction of the law. The probabili
ties are that there isn't a qualified
doctor around the place, and the
whole so-called "medical correspond
ence' is done by a lot of girl cLrks."
, , Mrs. Lovegood interjected,
"that's what it means then when they
say that 'onl\ women see the cor
respondence." "
"Exactly, my dear." continued her
husband, "and suppose the woman :
hi the advertisement is a real wo- j
man and not the "bearded lady.' I
there's your dressmaker, who is also I
a woman, not to speak of Mrs. Flan- j
nigan. the cook s mother, who is a
really excellent woman. If a wo-1
man's not a doctor then one woman's
as good as another and it's foolish
going to a stranger hundreds of miles
distant for the sympathy which
friends at home can better supply.
And as for a man not understanding
woman's diseases because he's a
man, that is the cheapest sort of clap
trap. W ho have done the doctoring
in the past two thousand years? The
men. Where must the modern wo
man physician go for her knowl
edge? To schools taught by men I
and books written by men. If this
woman, who claims men don't un
derstand woman's diseases, should
ever take to the study of medicine,
she'd have to be taught everything
she knew by the men who don't
know anything according to her
opinion. The problem is. how a man
who don't know anything about wo
man's diseases can teach a woman
to know everything about them. I
give it up.*'
"Then you wouldn't write," said
Mrs. Lovegood, doubtfully.
"Write; what for?" said her hus
band. "Write to a woman? What's
the use of writing to a woman? If
you want to write, write to a doctor.
The first question in sickness is not
a question of sex. but a question of
medical ability and qualifications.
There's no sex in medicine anyhow.
If you want to write why not write
to a man of medical standing, a spe
cialist like I )r. R. Y. Pierce of Buf
falo, X. Y. You know he's a regu
larly graduated doctor. You know
he's a good one and at the head of a
great medical institution. You know
he's had thirty years* experience, and
has. with the aid of his staff of nearly
a score of skilled specialists treated
more than half a million women, who
freely confided in the integrity of the
man and the skill of the physician.
President ?iarfield once said of Dr.
Pierce, 'he is one of the best men in
the world, and he is at the head of
one of the best medical institutions
in the world.' There's nothing new
about this free consultation by letter,
my dear, it has been a feature of Dr.
Pierce's practice for years, in fact,
for more than a quarter of a century.
Write to him, .because you'll get the
best advice and no string tied to it,
so to speak."
"But," queried Mrs. Lovegood,
"do you think even though Dr.
Pierce is a qualified physician, and
ranks so high as a specialist, he can
treat disease bv correspondence?"
"I don't see why not." answered
Mr. Lovegood. "Medical science is
wheeling :nto line with everything
else, and dropping the hocus pocus
of the middle ages. The 'divinity
that hedged in" the priest and physi
cian is a thing of the past. A man
is taken for what he is and what lie
can do. (>f course the members of
the profession who are not specialists
would naturally fight an innovation
which took away their patients and
their profits. But when a new idea
makes for public good it can't be de
stroyed. They used to say no steam
er could be built to cross the At
lantic. She couldn't carry coal
enough. ()ne prominent English
man, then leader in the house of
commons, in the heat of a debate de
clared that if ever any steamer cross
ed the Atlantic he'd eat it. machinery
and all." 1 take it that the objections
to treatment by correspondence have
as little foundation in fact as the ob
jections to the possibility of steam
ships crossing the Atlantic.
"It reminds me of that story about
the man who had been arrested for
some offense, lie sent for a lawyer,
who. when he had heard the storv,
said: '\\ hv, man alive, they can't ar
rest you for that!'"
"But." said the prisoner, "they've
done it."
"It does not seem any use to argue
about the possibility of being treated
successfully by correspondence with
Dr. Pierce when there are thousands
of people to stand up and say, 'We
have been successfully treated, we
have been entirely cured by Dr.
Pierce and his staff of specialists." "
"1 hen," said his wife, "it doesn't
follow that any and every body could
treat successfully by correspondence.
It is a movement in advance of or
dinary practice, by those specially
qualified who have given special
study and -special effort to some
branch of medicine. Is that your
idea?" j
"Precisely, my dear," Mr. Love
good answered, preparing to continue
his reading. "You have got the whole
thing now. It isn't because some
one advertises to give medical advice
by correspondence that you can
necessarily assume the advice will be
valuable or helpful. Anvbodv can
make such an offer. It is wise to go
behind the promises and the claims j
made and see if they bear investiga- j
tion. In Doctor Pierce's case the |
closer the examination of his claims
and record the greater the confidence
which he will inspire. Dr. R. V.
Pierce is at the head of the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, at Buf
alo, X. Y.. a medical and surgical in
stitution. which, in its scientific
equipment, its laboratory, its staff of
nearly a score of experienced physi
cians and surgeons and its variety of
daily practice, is on a footing with
any medical and surgical institute in
the country."
And just here the infant heir of the
house of Lovegood voiced a mes
sage to "a woman" who was in every
way qualified to give him the desired
I sttention, which she promptly did.
COL BRYAN ON EXPANSION
Democratio Leader Defines His Attitude on
Political Situation.
Bids His Soldier* Good-Dye After Re
eelvlns Notification of Acceptance
of Hln Ren lunation.
Col. W. J. Bryan of tho 8d Nebraska
Regiment, now at Atlanta, Qa., received
notification of the acceptance of his resig
nation yesterday afternoon. lie bade a
personal farewell to each man of his former
command and Rave out the following state
ment regarding his attitude in matters
political:
"My res son for leaving the army was set
forth in my letter to the adjutant general
tendering my resignation. Now that the
treaty of peace as been concluded, I be
lieve that I can be more useful to my coun
try as a civilian than as a soldier.
"The people of the United States, having
rescued Cuba from foreign control, may
now resume the discussion of the domestic
problems which confront this nation and
the consideration of the new questions aris
ing out of the war.
"1 may be In error, but, in my judgment,
our nation is in greater danger just now
than Cuba. Our people defended Cuba
against foreign arms. Now they must de
fend themselves and their country against
a foreign idea?the colonial idea of Eu
ropean nations. Heretofore greed has per
verted tin* government and used its instru
mentalities for private gain, but now the
very foundation principles of our govern
ment are assaulted.
Contrary to American Ideas.
"The imperialistic idea is directly antag
onistic to the idea and ideals which have
been cherished by the American people
since the signing of the Declaration of In
dependence. Our nation must give up the
intention of entering upon a colonial policy
such as is now pursued by European coun
tries, or it must abandon ihe doctrine that
governments derive their just powers from
the consent of the governed.
"We may believe that governments come
up from the people, or we may believe that
governmpnts come down to the people from
those who possess the heaviest cannon and
the largest ships, but we cannot advocate
both doctrines.
"To borrow a Bible quotation, 'A house
divided against itself cannot stand."
"Paraphrasing- Lincoln's declaration. I
may add that this nation cannot endure
half republic and half colony?half free and
half vassal. Our form of government, our
traditions, our present interests and our fu
ture welfare all forbid our entering upon a
career of conquest.
"Jefferson has been quoted as in favor of
imperialism, but our opponents must distin
guish between imperialism and expansion;
they must also distinguish between expan
sion in the western hemisphere and an ex
pansion that involves us in the quarrels of
Europe anil the orient. They must still fur
ther distinguish between expansion which
secures contiguous territory for future set
tlement and expansion which secures us
alien races for future subjugation.
No I nr- for Remote Territory.
"Jefferson favored the annexation of nec
essary contiguous territory on the North
American continent, but he was opposed to
wars of conquest, and expressly condemned
the acquiring of remote territory."
When asked how the colonial policy couid
be prevented, Col. Bryan said:
"Some think that the tight should be made
against the ratification of the treaty, but 1
would prefer another plan. If the treaty is
rejected negotiations must be renewed, and
instead of settling the question according to
our own ideas, we must settle it by di
plomacy. with the possibility of internation
al complications.
"It will be easier, I think, to end the war
at once by ratifying the treaty, and then
deal with the subject in our own way. Tin
Issue can b>' presented directly by a resolu
tion of Congress declaring the policy of the
nation upon this subject. The President
says in his message that our only purpose
in taking possession of fuba is to establisii
stable government and then turn that gov
ernment over to the people of Cuba. Con
gress could reaffirm this purpose in regard
to Cuba, and assert the same purpose in re
gard to the Philippine Islands and Porto
Rico. Such a resolution would make a clear
cut issue between the doctrine of self-gov
ernment and the doctrine of imperialism.
?VV e should reserve a harbor and coaling
station in Porto Rico and the Philippines in
return for services rendered, arid 1 think
we would be justified in asking ilie same
concession from Cuba.
Might Annex Porto Hico.
"In the case of Porto Rico, where the
people have as yet expressed no desire for
an independent government, we might with
propriety declare our willingness to annex
the island, if the citizens desire annexation,
but (he Philippine Islands are too far away
and their people too different from ours to
be annexed to the United States even if
they desired it."
Col. Bryan lest Savannah last night for
Washington. L>. C.. and will arrive there
this afternoon. He intends to enter
actively into the tight against the colonial
policy. In fact, it is evident that this was
the main cause that led to his resignation.
l)A/./.M\0i ASSORTMENT.
Ca?tell>er|['H Endless Variety of Pre
dion* Stone* for ClirivtiiinM.
Castelberg. the bargain giver; Castelberg,
the Jeweler; Castelberg, the gem expert,
and Castelberg, the man who first intro
duced the easy payment plan on jewelry
in Washington, are synonymous terms
with Castelberg, the Washington jeweler.
In a few years this house has reorganized
the jewelry trade.
For the holiday trade Mr. Castelberg has
to all purposes bodily taken the wealth of
the Indies and displayed it at his mam
moth establishment, !M5 Pennsylvania
avenue. Even if you are not in search of
a Christmas present, drop in and let your
eyes feast upon the wonders of the Mother
Earth. Every precious stone known to
science is here in endless variety, and there
are comprised in the stock many actual
gems, stones which have a reputation and
are known as well as famous race horses
throughout the world. Take the three
diamonds and live rubies that came from
the estate of the Rajah of Trekuz as an
example. It does not tak" an expert to
appreciate these marvels of the gem world.
They scintillate with a brilliancy that re
calls the stars and tremble with their
myriad lights' as if they were alive. But
the diamonds do not glitter nor the rubies
sparkle with greater effect than the as
tonishing low prices that greet you on all
sides. And you wonder as gazing about
this dazzling palace how one llrm can have
such a collection. And when you are in
formed by one of the clerks that any of the
stock Is yours for the asking, and that you
will only be required to pay a small deposit
down and then pay the rest at your con
venience, you rub your eyes in wonder
ment and say, "How can he do it?" You
know he does; that in the short time he
has been in Washington he has sold to the
very best people upon exactly these terms.
Then it (Joes not become such a puzzle
when you realize this.
The daintiest of gold jewelry, and ac
ceptable silver trinkets, clocks, watches,
rings. In fact, everything a first-class
jeweler should have, Castelberg has. The
optical department has made a name for
itself. and the good citizens of Washington
have b*en saved hundreds of dollars in
glasses. In this department all the latest
effects are shown in gold-rimmed glasses,
and there Is nothing that makes a more ac
ceptable present. There is a line of opera
glasses here also as dainty as they are fine,
for Castelberg handles only tlie best of
everything. His line of watches is really
exceptional. Gold and silver timepieces in
all the leading movements are embraced in
the stock, which is one of the finest ever
displayed in the city.
Sues for Divorce.
Suit for divorce has been instituted by Ar
villa McDonough against Patrick J. Me
Donougn. The couple were married in Au
gust, 1H03. at Columbus, Ohio, but later re
moved to this city. According to the peti
tioner. her husband deserted her and dur
ing the period of desertion has contributed
nothing to her support. The husband is

less than Ten Dollais p?r volume. The Committee on Distribution
has. however, undertaken distribute the work at a trifle over the cost
of manufacture and distribution. If it is necessary to increase the
price to meet expenses, it will be done later, but not on applications
during month of December.
