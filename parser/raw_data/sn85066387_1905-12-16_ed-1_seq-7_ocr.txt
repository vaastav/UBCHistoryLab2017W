ilultitudinous.
While ia search of a court order to per
mit him to see his children. John H. Mc-
Coy ran afoul cf an o!d order of arrest
fcr nonpayment of alimony yesterday,
&sd before he kntw it he was explaining
to Judge Graham how it happened- More
thaii a year ago McCoy was divorced by
Hose McCoy and he was ordered to pay
her JSII a month fcr the support of their
children. .
McCoy only paid Jl9 a month under the
order, however, and finally left the city.
Recently he returned and went to the
family home to see his youngsters. Mrs.
McCoy refused to permit him io see the
children, with the result that he applied
to Judge Graham for an order. Then the
court informed him that an order of ar
rest in his case had long been awaiting
\u25a0 service and that unless he paid Mrs. Mc-
Coy the full sum due her he would be
severely dealt with next Tuesday. McCoy
agreed to obey the court, and went away
announcing, however, that after he has
paid the alimony due he -wrili renew his
appeal for permission to see his children.
Acdie E. Thompson, who lives at 223
Liberty street, secured an order from
Judg* Seawell yesterday directing her
husband. James, to pay her $-59 a menth
alimor^r pending the hearing cf her suit
for a permanent allowance of $13 a
month. Mrs. Thompson asserts that her
husband makes £50 a month and has a
large raa of ratssey in bank. She says
his crtreJty drove her to leave him and
that since theu be has refused to con
tribute to her support.
Decrees of divorce were granted to Ade

to the Posi-Inielligencer from Vancouver.

A tragedy of the woods ended to-day in.
the death of a pretty little girl three
years old. For raGre than a year she had
been living with the half civilized In
dians that inhabit the almost impene
trable forests cf Northern Canada. From
village to village the police hunted and
trailed her. With the instinct born of
life forest the Indians passed her from
village to village and at last, as a more
effectual method of disguising her. paint
ed her little body with a concoction of
roots and herbs which stained her skin
to the dusky brown of the natives. She
was at last located by the police and
taken to the home of the Children's Aid
Society in Vancouver. But the concoc
tion "Kith which she had been painted had
poisoned her. Doctors worked on her in
effectually and she died last night.
The chiid was the daughter of a Scotch
man and a quarter breed Indian girL
The girl gave the* child into the keeping
of her distant Indiaa relatives in order
to be free of it. The baby was very fair
and was first seen by hunters in a village
north of Alert Bay. Tfaer reported the
matter to the authorities who investi
gated the case, finally rescuing the baby.
