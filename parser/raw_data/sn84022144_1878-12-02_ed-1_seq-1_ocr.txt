THE PRESIDENT'S MESSACE.
The fearful spread of this pestilence has
awakened a very general public, sentiment
iu favor of a national sanitary administra
tion, which shall not only control quaran
tine, but have sanitary supervision ofinte^
nal commerce in Map** of epidemics and
hold an advisory relation to-state and mu
nicipal authorities,' with 'power to deal with
whatever endad^ers.public health and which
the municipal nnd.etate authorities are un
able to regulate.
Tbe national quarantine act approved
April 29th, 1878, wlttcfc 4m passed too
Ute in the lett session of OODgrekS to pro
vide mews for carding ioto practical
operation during the putt Mason, is a atcp
in tb0:direction here indicated. In view
of tbraeoesatty for tbe mo^MTecthe meas
ures by quarantine and other means for the
protection «f our seaports and tbe country
generally from this and other.epidemics, it
is recommended thai congress give to the

ati»o.
THE EOUTHKHN qOKSTIOM.
The pernaueotpacification of the
country by the complete protection
of all citicens in every civil and political
right, continues to be of paramount interest
with the great body of our people. Every
sUp,in tfeis direction is welcomed with pu&
He approval and every interruption of a
steady, and uniform progress to the desired
consummation awakens general uneasiness
and widespread condemnation. Recent con
gressional elections have furnis)ied a direct
and trustworthy test of the advance thus
far made in Ihe prscticsl establishment of
the right of suffrage secured by the
constitution to the liberated race
ia the aoutbsrn states. All disturbing in
fluences, resl or isssginary, had been re
moved from all tkese states. The constitu
tional amendments, which conferred free
ddm find eqpality of civil and political
rights on tlfe colored people of the south,
were adopted by the concurrent action of
the great body of ^ood citixeos who main
tained the authorities of tbe national gov
ernment'and the integrity and perpetuity of
the union, J|t. Hflsh a, co»t of Ueaaure and

Washington, Dec. 2,1878—Teilow Citizens
of the Senate and House of Representatives:—
Our heartfelt gratitude i» due to the Divine
Being who bold* in his hands the destinies
of nations for His cont^uued bestowal, du
iug the last year, of countless blessings up
on our country. We are at peace with all
other nations. Our public credit has great
ly improved and is perhaps now stronger
than ever before. Abundant harvests have
rewarded the labors of those who till the
soil. Your manufacturing industries are
reviving and it is believed that the geueral
prosperity which has been so long anxious
ly looked for is at last withiu our reach.

fatal pestilence of yellow Ipver in some por

emergency which called. fc.r prompt and ex

appeared as an epidemic at New.Orleans
and at other places on the lower Mississippi
soon after midsummer. It was rapidly
apread by fugitives from the in ected cities
and'towfe* -and did notdiinpf ear until early
iu November. The states of Louisiana,
Mississippi and Tennessee have suffered se
verely. About one hundred thousand
cases are believed to have occurred,

to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It Is

suffering and destitution thst resulted ex

from every quarter to the assistance or tbe
afflicted. Communities voluuUt.y contri

by providing teuts, medicine and food

the confident expectation that this action of
the executive would receive the saoction of

PUBLIC FINANCES.
The report of the secretary of the treasu
ry furnishes a dotailed statement of the op
erations of that department of the govern
ment and of the coniition of the public
finances. The ordinary revenues from
all sources -.'' for tbe fiscal year
ending June 30th, 1878, were $257,763
878.70, The ordinarv expenditures for the
same period were $236,964,326.80, leavng a
surplus revenue for the year or $20,799,
551.90. The receipts for Jhe present fiscal
year ending June 30th, 8179, actual and es
timated, are as follows: Actual receipts for
first quarter, commencing July 1st, 1878
$73,389,743.43 estimated receipts for the
remaining three quarters of a year, $191,
110,156.57 totsl receipts for current fiscal
year, actuaj and estimated, $264,500,000.
The expenditures for the tame period will
be, actual and estimated, as follows: For
quarter commencing July 1st, 1878,
actual expenditures, $73,344,573.27, and
for the remaining three quarters,
of the year expenditures are estimated at
$166,755,426.73, making tbe total expendi
tures $240,100,000 and leaving an estimated
surplus revenue for tbe year ending June
30th 1378, of $24,400,000. The total ra
ceipta during the next fiscsl year, ending
Junei 30th 1880, estimated according to ex
isting laws, will be $264,500,000 and the es
timated ordinary expenditures for the same
period will be $236,320,412.68, leaving a
surplus of $28,179,587.32 for that year The
foregoing statements of expenditures actual
and estimated show no amount allowed for
the sinking fund provided lor by the set
approved February 25,1862, which requires
that one per cent, of the accrued debt of tbe
United States shall be purchased
or paid with in each fiscal yesr,to be set apart
as a sinking fund. There hss been, how
ever, subitsntial complisnce with tbe con
ditions of Isw. By its means the public debt
should bave been reduced between 1863 and
the close of tbe last fiscal yaar $£18,361,
808.28. _The sctua! reduction of the aecer
tained debt in that period has beeu $720,
644,730.61, being in excess of the redaction
required by tbe sinking fund act $202,282
933.33. Tlaeam iunt of tbe public deb?, less
cash in the treasury November 1st, 1878,
was $2,024,200,08318, a redaction since the
same date lasl year of $23,150,617.30.
The progress made during the last year
in refunding the public debt at low rates of
interest is very gratifying. The amount of
four per cent bonds sold durine the presed
year, prior to November 23, 1878, ia $100,
27t')!K)0 and six per cent, bonds, commonly
known as five-twenties, to an equal amount,
have been, or wjll be, redeemed on call at
maturity.
It has been the policy of the department
to place four per cent, bonds within the
easy reach of every citizen who desires to
invest his savings, whether small or great,
in these securities. The secretary of the
treasurv recommends that the law be so mod
ified that small sums may be invested and
that through the postoffices or other agents
of the government the freest opportunity
be given -to all plrts of tba country for such
investments.
THE BEiT MODE SUGGESTED
is that ibe department be authorized to is
sue certificates of tbe denomination of ten
dollars bearing interest at tbe rate of 3-65
per cent per sonum snd convertible at any
time within one year alter their issue into
the 4 per cent nds authorized bv the re
funding act, and to be issued only in ex
change lor United Sutes notes sent to the
treasury by mail or otherwise. Such
provision of law, supported by suitable re
gulations, would enable any person readily-,
without cost or risk, to convert his money
|nto interest bearing securities of the Uo
ited Stat i, and money so received could be
applied to the redemption of 6 per cent
bonds.
MOSEY COINAGE.
The coinage of gold during the last fiscal
year was S52.70S 080. The coinage of silver
dollars, under the act passed February 28th,
1878, amounted, on the 23d of November,
1878, to $19,814,550, of which amount $4,
9S4,947 are in circulation and the balance,
$14,S29,003, are still in the pessession of the
government. With views onchanged with
regard to the set under 'which the coinage
Tjtf silver proceeds, it' baa been-the pnrpsse
of the secretary faithfully to execiite the
law and to afford a fair trial to the measure.
In the present financial condition of
the country I am persuaded that the
welfare of legitimate business and
industry of every description
ill be best promoted by abstaining from all
attempts to make radical changes in the ex
isting financial legislation. Let .it be un
derstood during the coming year that the
business of the country -will be'undisturbed
by government interference with the lawa
aflecting it, and we mav confidently expect
that the
RESUMPTION OK SPECIE PAYMENT,
which will take plaee at the appointed time,
will be successfully and easily maintained,
and that it will be followed by a healthful
and endnring revival of business prosperity.
Let the healing influences of time, the in
herent energies of our people, and the
boundless resources of our. country have a
fair opportunity and relief from preeent dif
ficulties will surely follow.
THE ABMY.
Reports of the secretary of war show that
the army has been well and economically
supplied tbat the small force has been ac
lively employed and has faithfully perform
ed all tbe services required of it. The mor

during the year. The secretary reccommends:

ing June 30th, 1880, are $14,562,381.45 ex
ceeding the appropriations or the present
yesr only $32,949 75 which excess is occs
sioned by the demand or the naval acade
my and tbe marine corps, as exrlained in
the secre ary's report. The appropriations
for tbe present fiscal yesr are $14,538,43170,
which, in tbe opinion of the secretary,
will be ample for all the curreut
expenses of tbe department during
the year. The amonnt drawn from
the treasury Trnm July 1st to November It-t
1878, Is $4,T40,544 14 or which $70,980.75
has been refunded leaving as tbe exprndi
t*1*1 period $4,559,563 89,
or $o20,899.24 lesi than for the correspond
ng period of the last fiscal year.
THE FOSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The report of the postmaster general em
braces a detailed statement of the operations
of the postoffice department. The expendi
tures of that department for the fi«cal year
ending June 30, 1878, are $34,165,084 49.
The receipts, including sales or stamps,
money order buainess snd'official stamps,
are $29 277,516.96. The sum of S290,436.70,
included in the foregoing statement of ex
penditures is changeable to preceding years.
The actual expenditures for tbe fis
cal year ended June 30th, 1878,
are $33,874,647.60. This amoant
drawn from the treasury on appropriations,
in addition to the revenues of the depart
ment, were $5,037,652.82. The expendi
tures for the fiscal year ending June 30th.
1880, are estimated at $36,571,900 and the
receipts from all sourws at $30,664,023.90,
leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out
of the treasury of $5,907,879.10. The re
port calls attention to the fact that the com
pensation of postmasters of railroad* for car
rying mail is regulated by law, aod tbat the
failure of congress to appropriate the
aiqounts required for these' purposes does
not relieve the government of the responsi
bility, but neceosariJy increases tbe defi
ciency bills, which congresi will be called
on to pass in providing for postal service.
The following questions are presented.
Shall congress anually appropriate a sum
lor its expenses largely in excess tn its reve
nues, or should such rates of postage be es
tablished is would make the department self
sustaining
Should postal service be reduced by ex
cluding from the mails matter which does
not pay its way?
Should the number of post rou es be
diminished?
Should other methods be adopted which
will increase the revenues or diminish the
expense of the postal service?
The international postal congress which
me'.*t
Paris, May 1st, 1878, is continued in
session till June 4th or the same year. It was
composed or delegates from nearlv all the
civilized countries of the world. It adopt
ed anew convention to take theplace of the
treaty concluded at Berne, October 9tb,
1874, which goes into effect the first of April,
1879, between the countries whose delegates
have signed it. It was latified and ap
proved, with tbe consent of tbe president,
August 13th, 1878. A synopsis of this uni
versal postal commission will be found in
tbe report of the postmaster general and
the full text in the appendix thereto. In
its origin the postal union was comprised of
twenty-three countries having a population
of 350,000,000 people. On the 1st of April
next it will comprise fortr-three countries and
colonies with a population of more than
650^000,000 people aod will soon, by acces
sion of the few remaining countries and
colonies which maintain organized postal
services, constitute in fact as well as in name,
as its new tf lie indicates, a universal union,
raulating upon a uniform basis of cheap
pestagie rates, the postal intercourse between
civilised nations Some differences have
arisen out of conflict between the customs
laws of this country and. the provisions or
the postal convention in regard to tha trans
tnission of-forelgn books and newspapers to
this country by mail. .It is. hoped
congress will be abls to deviae some mesas
or reconciling tbe difficulties wbicb have
thus been created so as to do justice to all
pirties involved.
THE SUPREME COURT.
The business or the supreme court and of
courts in many of circuits has increased to
such an extent" during the paat year thst
additional legislation is imperative to re
leive and prevent tbe delsv of justice and
possible oppression to suitors which is
thus occasioned. Tha encumbered condi
tion of these dockets are presented in there
port of the attorney general and a remedy
is suggwtoJ and earnestly urged for con
grMsional action. The creation of an ad
ditional circuit judge, as propose J, would
anord a complete remedy and would involve
an expense£*t (be pleaent rate of salaries, of
not more than $60,U00.

NOTES ON EDUCATION.
Nebraska has a school population of 102,
727.
Union College has two Indians among her
students. Not a single case of hazing has
occurred this year.
Johns Hopkins University has now 116
studentf, forty-three of tbese being new ad
missions this session.
Several of the Illinois schools have adopt
ed, wilt excellent results, tbe resding and
discussion of newspapers as a class exercise.
Examinations of applicants for state cer
tificates will be begun December 19, at tbe
Normal schools at Albany, Brockport, Buffa
lo, Fredonia, Cortland,Geneseo, New York,
Oswego and Potsdam.
At the L. A. examination held by tba
University of St. Andrews, the papers in
political economy sent in by the ladies were
far better than those rumixhed by the ordi
nary students, while those in history were of
exceptional merit.
A msjority report recommending the re
tention of the old devotionsl exercises in the
Schools has been adopted by the New Haven
board of education. This action was in ac
cordance with the wish of the people ex-
gy
reased at the polls. The manual prepared
the committee of clergymen is therefore
set aside.
It is asserted tbst hundreds of the coun
try schools io Ohio are inferior both in
pupils and in teachers to tbose of twenty
yesrs ago, many ot tbe schools having a
very small average attendance, and proper
qualifications in tbe teacher being over
looked in tbecate of such light attendance.
Consolidstion of the smaller districts Is
recommended as a remedy.
Matthew Arnold has been very much
struck with tbe superiority of secondsry
education in France to secondary education
in England. He looks at France, with its
81 lyceet. Its 292 communal colleges, its
803 eccies til/res, and ita total of something
like 160.000 scholars receiving a solid edu
cation, and then he turns, with a reeling
near akin to despair to England, with at
most 20,000 scholars "under secondary in
struction which may be called guaranteed,"
including among tbese all the boys at tbe
grest public schools, many of whom belong
in no sense to the middle clsss.
A speaker at tbe recent meeting of the
Detroit teachers said tbat children should
be taught grammar when they are evsn too
young to read, but tbat tbe teaching of
technical grammar should be reserved until
tbe last year at the high school. He held
tbat no one ever changed from a bad speak
er to a good one by correcting his sayings
by the rules of grammar. It is constant
practice tbat causes correctness. There is
a great deal of truth in this who that has
ever attended a country school but remem
bers bow the talk of the pupils, in spite
of ceaseless recitations in grammar, ie
mained crammed with blunders?
The professors in the East Indian medical
schools complain or the listlessness and ig
norance displayed by the junior department
generally. Tbe principal or tbe Xagpore
school of medicine also reports very unfa
vorably upon the general character of the
students. This unsatisfactory state of things
is ascribed to the system recently inaugura
ted by government, under which students
are selected by a military committee after
passing the prescribed test in reading, wri
ting and arithmetic, and are then sent for
one year's preliminary training at a civil
hospital before entering the medic il school.
This system deters educated and energetic
men from entering the service, while it at
tracts the idle and worthless.
This apt presentation of the salary ques
tion comes from The Sterling (111.) Gazette
"The kitchen girl can save more than the:
teacher. Lady teachers in Sterling receive,
on an average, about $40 per month, which
for nine months amounts to $360 fifty-two
weeks board, at $4.50, $234 forty weeks
washing, at $1, $40 clothes, $100 inciden
tal expenses, $20 total. S394 salary, $360
loss, $34. Kitchen girl: fifty-two weeks, at
$2, $104 board, nothing washing, noth
ing clothes, $50 incidental expenses, $10
balance, $44. The above figures will show
a balance in favor of the kitchen girl or S78
per annum. The teacher cannot, if she
would, do her washing or sewing during the
school year. The teacher must dress well,
or she cannot hold her situation. She must
spend time and money to prepare, for her
work. The only preparation the kitchen
girl needs is a strong arm, a sinewy hand,
and a willing heart."
SflLL ANOTHER USE FOR ELECTRICITY.
Electricity has been added to the duck
ing-tub as a mode of punishment in tbe
Columbus (Ohio) penitentiary. The pris
oner is first stripped of his clothing, then
blindfolded and tak°n into the room where
the tub is kept. There he is ordered to sit
down in water three inches deep, and one
pole of the battery having been placed in
tbe water, a sponge is attached to the otber.
With this sponge the body of the prisoner
is touched rapidly in several places. Not
knowing where he is to be touched, as his
eyes are still kept blindfolded, bis suffering
becomes the greater. The pain sometimes
produced is (aid to be great, and causes the
risoner to shout in loud ana piercing tones.
Tulesa a careful physician is employed to
direct the use of the electricity, people will
be led to question the wisdom and humanity
of this innovation.
SWEETENING THE ENGLISH.
Honey sent to England in tbe comb a
month ago for tbe first time reached Liver
pool aafely on tbe 5tb, and tbe experiment
is pronounced successful. There were
eighty tons In one abip—stored, saya The
Pall Mall Qaaatte, with some curiosity, "by
American beea themselves into hair a mil
lion neat little glass-aided boxea." That
paper learna tbat tbe honey waa the partial
product of 12,000 awarma of beea, in which
large mercantile Iras ia interested and
wbicb are diatributed throughout tbe hon
ey producing sections of tbe United States
in spiaries, of 100 awarma each. "There
seems to be no limit," it says, "to tbe pro
visions with which America ia prepared to
supply us. Tbe first experiment or bring
ing honey in the comb on a large aeale to
Europe from America having proved suc
cessful, It will no doubt be repeated. Honey
will even perhaps become with us, aa it waa
with tbe ancients, an important article of
food."
