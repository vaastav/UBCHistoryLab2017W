A call has been issued by H. A.

2S, of next year. All members of the
association, and all livestock associa

generally are urged to attend, as many
questions of the greatest importance
to the industry will come up for con-
ideration. The probability of some

ft 101 SENDS REPORT OH
S

Washington, Dec. 14 President
Roosevelt today sent a message to
congress inclosing a letter from the
secretary of war transmitting the re
port of the investigation made by
Herbert J. Brown, employed by the de
partment in conjunction with Captain
V. G. Baldwin to investigate the
Brownsville rioting affair on August
13 and 14, 1906. The message in part
follows: .
This report enables us to fix with
tolerable definlteness at least some
of the criminals who took the lead in
the murderous shooting of private citi
zens at Brownsville., It establishes
clearly the fact that the colored sol
diers did the shooting. The investi
gation has not gone far enough to en
able us to determine all the facts,
and we will proceed with it. It ap
pears that almost all members of com
pany D must have been actively con
cerned in the shooting, either to the
extent of being , participants or to
the extent of virtually encouraging
those who were participants. As to
companies C and D there can be no
question that practically every man
in them must have had knowlenge that
the shooting was done by some sol
diers of B troop, and possibly by one
or two others in one of the other
troops. -

HARRIMAN NEED NOT
ANSWER QUESTIONS
Washington, Dec. 14. In an opinion
by Justice Holmes in the Supreme
court of the United States today it
was held that B. H. Harrlman and
Otto Kahn, the latter a New York
banker, should not be required to an
swer the Interstate Commerce Com-;
mission's questions concerning their
dealings in stocks between Union
Pacific and other roads, to which they
refused to make response when the
subject was under investigation in
New York.
The questions which Harriman re
fused to answer sought to ascertain
whether he owned any Chicago and
Alton stock which was purchased by
the Union Pacific and whether the
Illinois Central stock was acquired
by' a pool of which he was a member
with the view of selling it to the Un
ion Pacific and whether the Union Po-
cific directors were interested in New
York Central stosk which was acquir
ed by the Union Pacific and how much
Santa Fe stock was owned by Union
Pacific directors. The circuit court
declared that Harriman must answer
these questions and its decision was re
versed today by the supreme court.
TIMBER GRABEERS TO
BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL
Washington, Dec. 14. The supreme
court of the United States today, In
the main, reversed the verdict of the
United States district court for the
district of Colorado discharging from
custody a number of persons who had
been arrested on a charare of conspir
ing to defraud the government by en
tering on timber and coal lands con
trary to law.
There were four cases in which mis
appropriation of -timber land was!
charged, F. W. Whitted, Robert For
ester, Charles E. Herr and George C.
Franklin being defendants and three
coal land cases, Charles H. Freeman,
Edgar M. Biggs and Alexander T. Sul

and consiplring to procure for corpora

Enrollment Growing.
Under the direction of Prof. GlU
and the able management of the Board
of Regents, consisting of Judge J. E.
Wharton of Alamogordo, president,
Dr. G. C. Bryan of Alamogordo, secre
tary and treasurer, and Messrs. W. A.
Hawkins of Three Rivers, Oscar C.
Snow of Las Cruces, and W. F. Bu
chanan of Tucumcarl, the Institute is
making splendid progress, and is do
ing a great work among the blind
children of the territory. When the
school opened September 10, lflOO, it
had but one pupil, but before the end
of the school year 21 were enrolled.
In the following year the enrollment
eached 32, and this year there are
30 enrolled, and the two who are acj
companying Prof. Gill will make 32',
with a prospect of several others be
fore the end of the school year.
The enrollment this'year is exclu
sive of Pine pupils, who were in the
Institution last year, and who did not
return. Five of these were barred by
age, and three of them had so far re
covered their sight under the treat
ment received at the institution that
they were able to enter the public
schools at their home. This fact calls ,
attention to a most important part of
the work at the Institute, and that is
the attention of a trained physician
and an oculist who are in attendance
at the school and by whose efforts
many partially blind children are en
tirely restored to their sight.
Parents Are Indifferent.
The officers of the Institute find that
in order to get pupils it 13 'necessary
for some one to go into the homes of
the parents of the blind children and
explain to them the importance of an
education for their offspring, and
urge them to take advantage of the
school's opportunities for instruction. ,
Notwithstanding the fact that the
school provides free board, tuition and
training, many parents are slow to
take advantage of it, either because
they do not understand how pupils
are to be entered, or from careless
ness. The instruction includes a complete
English course, piano, vocal culture,
sewing, fancy work and betfd work
for the girls, and piano tuning, broom -making,
hammock weaving, chair seat-
ing and mattress making for the boys..
Prof. Gill himself instructs the boys
in handicraft, and the teacher of mu- '
sic is the instructor of the girls in
their domestic arts. Thus by doubling .
the work of the faculty a maximum ;
amount of instruction Is secured at a
minimum of expense.
Legislature Liberal.
The legislature two years ago was
very liberal with the Institute, and
provided sufficient funds to run it com
fortably, With the few pupils It then
had. The investigations of the board
of regents, however, have shown that ;
there are still -at least 100 blind and
partially blind children in New Mex
ico who should he in the school, and
it is hoped that 'the coming legisla
ture will make sufficient provision not
only for the maintenance of the
school, but for the bringing in and
for the education and maintenance of
these 100 children who are growing
up with no practical training. They ,

matter , of common humanity and
Christianity, - but also as a policy of
