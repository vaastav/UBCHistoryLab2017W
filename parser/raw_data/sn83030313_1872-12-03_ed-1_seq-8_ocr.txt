MONEY ACTIVE.
The money market was unsettled and active.
The earlier business was at "sharp" 7 per cent
to that rate In coin or in addition to a com
mission of 1-32. After two o'clock there was a
?udden relaxation to plain T per cent, and a
tow transactions occurred at as low as 0 per
?ent; but the brokers who came out to supply
themselves with money In the subsequent Interval
to the close of banking hours had to pay 7 per
cent coin, and In a few instances as high as 1-32
?gain. The demand for mercantile paper con*
Unties fairly active and a good many out ol town
fcrokera are in the market with a view to making
? ?election for an Investment during the Winter
Bonths. Prime paper is quoted 10 a 12 per cent -
discount.
ADVANCE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE.
The demand for foreign exchange Incidental to
the closing of accounts at this season and the
scarcity or commercial bills arising out or the
dearth of freight room at this port Just now,
enabled the drawers of foreign exchange to ad
vance their rates a quarter per cent lor bills on
Kurope. The following were the closing quotations,

the tone of the foreign exchanges, and advanced

speoulatlvc movement in the aiarkct, which, most

STOCKS UN8KTT1.ED AND LOWER.
The stock market opened strong In sympathy
with an active upward movement in Pacific Mall,
which Is In the hands of the Stockwell party for a
lively speculation, after the fashion of Northwest
ern, and a "corner" upon the "shorts," if there bo
enough of that kind of speculators to make tho
game worth tho candle. In default of a "short"
interest, to be squeezed after the Northwestern
method, the pool, when loaded up with the stock,
will declare themselves a three per ccnt quarterly
dividend early In the Spring, or put In effect the
legal authority they possess to buy in the stock
with the company's money, and thus
I MAKE A MARKET
for their holdings. The price advanced from 84V
| to 89V, and receded at the close to 87V. Erie, on
a rise in tho London market, advanced to 63V, bnt
fell off with the general market late in the day. An
active movement in Rock Island, which advanced
the price np to 112V. was thought by many to be
tho beginning of "the great advance" which Is to
take that stock to 150 a 200 (V), but the impression
was discouraged by tho subsequent decline to
HIV. Western Union was weak all through, on
account of the unfriendly tone of the report of
THE postmaster GENERAL
as regards this corporation, and especially because
or his assertion that a line equal to tho Western
Union can be built for the government postal tele
graph service tor about twelve millions of dollars,
whereas the capital of Western Union is over forty
millions. The street was fnrnlshcd by one
o'clock with sketches of the mossage and report
of the Secretary of the Treasury, the financial mat- I
ters In which served to depress the stock market I
and cause an eventual decline of v a lv per cent '
from the highest prices prevailing In the buoyancy
of the forenoon. The President's deprecation of
any further
REDUCTION OP THE TAXES
and Mr. Boutwell's estimate of a margin of only
thirty millions of excess of receipts over expendi
tures of the government in the ensuing fiscal year
(which does not begin until July l, 1873,) were,
more particularly, the depressing influences, the
former because of the Innate human desire tor no
taxes at all, and the latter because It proposes less
bond-buying lor Wall street and a less abundantly
supplied money market. As to Mr. Boatwell s mar
gin of thirty millions, it Is his habitual way of di
verting the attention of Congress every session
from his enormous bond purchases, which he has
managed to run up to
A HUNDRED MILLIONS EVERY YEAR,
although he has nsnally persuaded Congress that
the expenses or government were going to be
large enough to swallow np nearly every dollar
or the Treasury income. Our word tor If. his thirty
millions or excess will stretch out enough betore
the closc of the next fiscal year to enable him to
buy in three times thirty millions of the public
debt. The question of contraction he leaves to
Congress entirely, and takes relnge behind the
Uunsbylsm that specie payments will be reached
either by contracting the currency or by limiting
the currency to a fixed amount and allowing the
country to grow to resumption, "If so be," Ac.

Monday, Dec. 2?e p. M.
The trade movement oontinued fair to-day, and
'tue marketB were quite generally buoyant. There
was no especial activity In any department, how
ever, but a fair trade wan consummated in nearly
all the principal articles of merchandise. On
'Change there was almost no Inquiry for flour for
export, but a good demand prevailed for wheat,
transactions In which were restricted by the en
hanced views of sellers, by whom the choicer goods
were held with increased firmness. A fair
business was done, however, mainly on the
basis of Saturday's prices. Corn was In fair re
quest, but the market was depressed by
the unusually heavy receipts, and closed
heavy. Oats were Irregular, closing doll, how
ever, at Saturdays quotations. Whiskey, under a
continued fulr demand and light receipts, again
appreciated. The pork market was slow and un
satisfactory. The fact that the entire stock Is held
by one firm preclude!* the possibility of speculation
and even of large transactions, so that but little
business is looked for until the new crop shall have
gut fairly started. Lard was dull, without change
in prices. The freight movement was steady and rates
?were much tho fame both tor freight room and charter*.
Cotton watt only in moderate request and about fteady.
Coffee was active, while other groceries were quiet, but
the general market was firm. Petroleum remained dull
and entirely nominal. There wm a fair business in
spirits of turpentine at slightly easier prlccs, but rosin
was quiet and somewhat weak.
CorrKK.?There has been quite an active demand for
Rio to-day, but other descriptions wero neglected. The
market closed firm for all descriptions. We heard of sales
ot 1,(Mi bags, ex Foreninnigan, on private terms; 4,200
bags, ex Earnest, to arrive at New Orleans; 6,800 bags to
arrive, ex Dipton, at do., and 2,000 bags, ex Say bio, to a r

In the United States circuit Court yesterday the
case of George Washington Bo wen vs. Nolson
Chase was called on before Judge Shlpman. This
Is an action, as the public kuow from the fre
quency with which it lias been reported, on an
ejectment to gain possession of a large tract ut
property in the neighborhood of Fort Washington,
and which property cume into the hands ol the de
fendant under the-will and the settlement of the
affairs of the late Mme. JuineL After some discus
sion between counsel on both sides the caave was
adjourned until Monday next at eleven o'clock.
Mr. Sidney De Kay has resigned his post as as
sistant in the otltce of the United States District
Attorney, and lnteuds to go Into the practice of law
in this city.
The case of The People vs. William M. Tweed, for
defrauding the city ol a large amount of lands,
having been set down for hearing yesterday, there
was a large attendance of counsel on both sides In
the Court of Oyer and Terminer; but in conse
quence ol a murder trial having been proceeded
with, which lasted until the hour for closing the
Court, the case was fixed for this day.
In the Court of Oyer and Terminer yesterday the
trial of James Tully and John Smith for the murder
of Gustave Brown, on the night of the 8th of Jnne
last, was heard before Judge Ingraham and a com
mon jury, which resulted in the acquittal of both
the prisoners, there being no evidence to connect
either of them with the ailray.
Thomas Cobb, indicted for the homicide of his
wife* pleaded guilty of manslaughter, and was sen
tenced to imprisonment with hard labor in the
State Prison for four years.
Various others pleading guilty were sentenced tO'
the State Prison.
Judgo Fancher, of the Supreme Court, before
whom application was made for a stay of proceed
ings in the case of Henry Rogers, convicted in
King's county of the murder of Policeman Dono-.
hue, of Brooklyn, and scntencea to be hung next
Friday, announced his decision yesterday, relnxing
to grant the stay. lie presented a lengthily written
opinion in the case, fully sustaining the rulings
and charge of Judge Gilbert, before whom the trial
took place. Rogers' counsel said that be should
renew his application before some other judge ana
in case of failure should ask a respite from Gover
nor Hoffman.
An Important decision has been rendered by
Jndge Freedman, of t,no Superior Court, in a suit
brought against the Third Avenue Railroad Com*
pany. The case was where a passenger was
ejected from a car because he did not have a trans
fcr ticket and refused to repay his fare. A verdict
for $500 damages was found against the company.
The case was carried to the Superior Court General
Term, and the present decision Is in confirmation
of the jhdgment in the lower Court.
Another of our city fire Insurance companies has1
succumbed to the Boston lire. The last thus far in
the list is the Corn Exchange Fire Insurance com
pany. Yesterday Judge Leonard, holding Supreme
Conrt Chambers, on application of one of the di
rectors, appointed Mr. William R. Foster a receiver ?
to wind up its affaire. The capital WOS stated at
$200,000 and surplus at $30,000. ltd twees in the
Boston fire are given as $140,oou and Other liabili
ties, including premiums, $30,000 additional.
A verdict for $5,000 damages aeainst the city was
rendered yesterday in a jury trial before Judge
Van Brunt, holding trial term of the Supreme
Court. The party obtaining the verdict was Miss
Liddy Pocdtull, and the ground of It injuries she
sustained in stumbling over a stone left on the
sidewalk. One or two more such verdicts will bo
likely to insure a little more care on the part ol
the city in the matter ol sidewalk obstructions.
A motion was made in the General Sessions yea*
terday to quash an indictment against Hugh
Smith and others, on tho ground of the alleged
illegal extension of the November term. Recorder
Uackett reserved his decision.

Opinion on the Points liaised by Sur
rogate Hatchings.
The will ol the late Judge John McCunn was
yesterday admitted to probate by surrogate
Hutchlngs. In the subjoined decision of the Sur
rogate tho points raised by the contestants to the
will are reviewed at length, and present a cleaf
statement of the grounds of their opposition and
the law In the case upon which the will has all
length been admitted to probate.
Sl'SROOATK IUTCniNQS' DECISION.
fn tho matter or the estate of John II. McCnnn certain
persons claiming to be heirs at law and next ol kin of tho
dcccdent have appeared in this proceeding to contest,
and do contest, the probate of the instruments pro
fiounded as his I ant will and codicils thereto. The rela
toushtp of those persons, and their right so to contest,
?re denied by the proponents; but I have So far allowed
them a stand'ng In court, as to permit them to take part
in the proceeding* for probate. Their written objections,
on Ale. to the admission ol' the will and codicils to pro
bate contain, also, several ohlcctlons to the validity of
Bortlons thereof, and, among others. In general terms, that
le propounded will is void as creating an unlawful
suspension of alienation, and as also directing
au accumulation of rents and profits of land in
violation of law. and. further, that the instrument is
void for uncertainty. The proponents have rested in
their evidence, and now it is claimed bv the contestants
that the questions referred to respecting the validity of
some ol the provisions of the will and codicils are pro
perly before mo for my lurlsdictlon and determination,
under section il of chaitor *>? ef the laws of IS79.
The counsel for tho executors and of such ef the legatees
and devises* at have appeared In the proceedings of
probste d*ny that the persons on whose behalf siicn ob
jection* are made are heirs at law or next of kin, and
they also decline to unite in any submission, assent to or
acquiescence In a hearing, or any action on my part,
upon such objections or question* of tho validity, con
struction or effect of any of the provisions ef either the
