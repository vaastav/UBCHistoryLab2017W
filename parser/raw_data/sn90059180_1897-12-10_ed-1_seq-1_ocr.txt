by Trustee Eaton, who as a pro
pounder of intricate school ques­
tions shows a tact that bespeaks
great knowledge of such matters
especially sc| ..hen one considers
that Mr. Eaton rarely visits the
school, and that Prof. Wheeler,
though taketa wholly unaware,
passed the examination admira­
bly and to tVJe apparent satisfac­
tion of all present. While we
were an attentive listener during
the entire course of sprouts, we
have gleanek much from the Vir­

evident interest which we failed
to note at tie time.

time adv:rtising should be the
heaviest. You want to get the
people in to see what you have
to sell, and you must advertise
to do that. When the times are
good they come of their own ac­
cord. But I believe in advertis­
ing all the time. I have tried all
kinds of advertising and have
spent a great deal of money in
posters and bills, but 1 gave that
up long ago and think newspaper
advertising is by far the best."
