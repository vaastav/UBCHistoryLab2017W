Sboretary-Treasurer of Ironworkerk'
Union, Who " Cinriot' Be Truited by
Anybody," Resigns-President Ryan
Takes 8tiind and Dinies Knowledge
of Any Dynamiting.
Indianapllis, Dec. 2.-Argument that
only those wh& have confessed had
caused the illldal transportation of
explosives on passenger trains to
H:low tp noi'-uilon irbn and steel jobs,
was advanced today at the "dynamite
conspiracy" trial qf Frank M. Ryan,
president of the International Associ
ation of Bridge & Structural Iron
workers.
After the testimony of its five hin
dred and forty-ninth 'witness, the
government closed its case and on its
motion had :four of the 45 defendants
dismissed oh the ground that the
charges against themn were not sus
tained.
Before taking theista.d as the first
witness for 'the defense, F. .f. Ryan
announced the resignation of Herbert
S. Hockn 'as sedietary-treasurer of
the union. Hockin, a defendant, was
sitting in court. in custody of bailiffs,
having been unable to obtain in
creased bonds ordered nine days ago
by the court after witnesses des
cribed him as a spy who had helped
.the McNamaras organize the "dyna
ailting crew" and then had given in
formation to the government and de
tectives after quarrels with the con
fessed dynamiters. Mr. Ryan said
Hlookin's resignation was voluntary.
J. E, McClory, of Cleveland, suc
ceeds Hockin.
Knew Nothing of It.
Mr. Ryan testified that neither he
nor the executive board members
knew of any money having been ex
lended by McNamara for dynamiting
'purposes. All 4he letters written 'by
him tdo bttinesn agents in various
cities, which, the government charges,
conta~nel' veiled inl'tructions about
jobs to be blown up, Ryan said, simp
ly referied to work upon which non
union men were employed and upon
which it was desired to put union
men.
"Did you ever talk to Ortie E. Mc
M&anigal about d3ynamiting, or tell
him to change his appearance so that
he would not be recognized?" Asked
Attorney William Harding.
"I hardly knew MoManigal and cer
tainly never knew he was employed
as a dynamiter for McNamara or
- anyone else:"
Mlr. Ryan said he never had visited
a vault in the ironworkers' head
quarters in Indianapolis, where nitro
glycerine and dynamite had been
kept, and he never had proposed, as
charged, that t. J. McNamara, then 1
secretary of the" union, take Hockin'si
place as head of the "dynamiting
crew." He deified he had urged vio
lence in the union's strike called
seven years ago, and which is still
on,
Questioned why he had' enclosed in
a letter a newspaper clipping giving
an account of the' explosion, he ex
plained it -wUs sent' to McNami)ara as
a matter of pnews. .He denied he had
told Edward Clark, the confessed dy
namiter, about blowing up a job in
Cincinnati..
The dismismal of the cases leaving
41 labor union officials still on trial,
came when Charles W. Miller,. Uni
ted States distloet attorney, announc
ed that the government's evidence was
all presented and that the government
rested its c`lae.
IMr. Miller then moved dismissal of
the following:

SALT LAKE YOUTH
DIES TO SAVE
OTHERS
Salt Lake City, Dec. 2.-Rather
than injure and perhaps kill some
smaller boys who were in the path
of his sled, Allen Rosslyn, aged
15, chose death for himself today.
He was coasting on a steep hill in
this city." Finding no other way to
avoid a colision, he turned his
sled sharply into a' water culvert
and sustained internal injuries,
from which he died soon after.

THE 1AR
JEALOUSY ARISES BETWEEN
HELLENE8 A.ND BULGARS AND
MAY GR.W WORSE.
London, Dec. '2.-The imperial
chancellor's statement on the' Euro
pean situation, together with that of
Herr Von Kiderlen-Waechter, the
Germany foreign secretary, confirm
ing the fact that Great Britain and
Germany are co-operating amicably in
favor of peace, is regarded in E'uro
pean capitals as reassuring and like
ly to have an effect when the peace
delegates begin to discuss terms.
Dr. Von Bethmann-Hollweg's dec
laration of the solidarity of the triple
alliance, which it is reported has just
been renewed for another term of
years, and his announcelment of the
determination of Germany to uphold
Turkey in an economic sense, is like
ly to influence the delegates of all
countries concerned to discuss peace
conditions in,. e spirit of moderattqc
already show n the armistice nego
tiations.
Although there is no change tonight
in the actual situation, some misgiv
ings are beginning to be expressed
with regard to the attitude of Greece.
Various reasons are assigned for
Greek reluctance to sign the armis
tice. Accordiing to the Greek minister
at Paris, Greece opposes the pro
posal that the besieged garrisons
shall be provisioned during the armis
tice and thinks that the allies ought
to have insisted upon their surrender.
There is no doubt that jealousy ex
ists between Greece and Bulgaria,
Greece asserts that the Greek fleet
played an important role in the war
and especially in preventing Turkey
from moving her troops by sea and
that without her naval assistance, the
allies could not have achieved such a
brilliant success. The race between
the Greeks and the Bulgarians for the
occupation of Saloniki, and the inci
dents that followed have increased the
ill-feelings and the Greeks now con
sider their interests are being sacri
ficed in the peace negotiations.
It is expected the armistice protocol
will be signed some time tomorrow,
but it is possible this may be delayed
further.
Some Points Settled.
Sofia, Dec. 2.-The plenipotentiaries
held a. meeting at 3 o'clock this morn
ing at Baghtche sbut it was considered
doubtful whether, any definite con
clusion regarding the armistice would
be' reached before Tuesday night or
Wednesday.
The important points of the armis
tice have been settled, such as the
retention of the respective armies of
the positions they now occupy.

OF SIXTY-SECOND CONGRESS
As the house of representatives looks when in kession. Speaker Clark is seen at the extrema right,
Washington, Dec. 2.-The senate and
house settled down to work today for
the high pressure session that is to
end the Sixty-second congress.
Speaker Clark, wielding his emblem
of authority with ever-increasing
force, succeeded in breaking two gav
els ,before he had 'brought the enthus
iastic members through an hour and
10 minutes of business. The sessions
in both houses served to complete the
preliminary work of organization and
left congress ready,for legislative busi
ness tomorrow.
The senate, depressed by the recent
death of Vice President Sherman and
!Senators Heyburn and' Rayner, was in
session 22 minutes.
Both houses adjourned as soon as
the preliminaries of organization were
concluded, out of respect for 'officers
and members who had died since the
adjournment in August.

ISS MUCH MONEY
FOR UNCLE SAM
TO EXIST
ESTIMATES OF DEPARTMENTS
IFORECAST ANOTHER BILLION
DOLLAR SESSION.
Washington, Dec. 2.-It will cost
$823,415,455.14 to conduct the affairs of
the government for the fiscal year
ending Jung 30, 1914, according to the
estimates of the various department
heads, submitted today to the speaker
of the house by the secretary of the
treasury. This amount, which does
1 not' include any provision for the pos
tal service, which is expected to be
I self-supporting, is an increase of $72,
073,248 over the approprialions made
for the present year bLy the last con
gress.
Of this increase, $28,312,220 appears
in the estimates of the secretary of
the navy, and $20,597,297 represents
the increase asked by the navy depart
ment in the appropriations for 'build
d ing and equipping new vessels. The
r estimates would ,provide for three new
battleships to he laid down during the
year. This would make up for the
e lapse of ole ship from the two-bat
f tleships-a-year program caused by the
action of the democratic house in pro
vidi g for but a single ship in the last
ses ion.
Ahother $20,000,000 or more of the
total increase is shown in the esti
mates for the paylment of pensions.
The amount asked for is $185,220,000.
Last year but $0165,416,470 was ex
pende.d for pensions. An increase of
about the same amount appears in the
estimates for public works for the
year, The construction of public
buildings planned for the year shows
an increase of $1,012,530 over the ap
propriations of the present year, $8,
D .772,200 being asked for that purpose.
The work to be done during the year
on the Panama canal will cost $30,
174,432, which is $1,130,567 less than
the appropriations for the current
year.
A Billion-Dollar Session.
Of this sum, $6,769,522 is asked for
n the pinrpose of building fortifications
e and military barracks in the canal
st zone. This year but $2,325,000 was
appropriated for fortifications at
Panalma. The estimates forecast an
oe ther billion-dollar session of congress,
for in addition to the $823,415,455,
which is the total estimated, the post
d master general estimates $281,791,508
will be necessary to conduct his de
partmient for the year. This amount
will be supplied out of the postal rev
enues and will bring the total esti
t mate for the year up to $1,105,206,963.
Jiast how these estimates will fare at
the hands of the democratic majority
in the house is the subject of consider
md able conjecture. Some difficulty in
passin appropriatiori bills may follpw

Enthusiasm. t
Boisterous enthusiasm greeted the
return to the house of Spe.aker Clark, I
former Speaker ('annon and other I
members whose names long have been i
associated with the important affairs
of that body. i1Formier Speaker I'annon
was given a rising greeting when his

IN POSITION
MANAGER OF LOCAL POWER DE
PARTMENT WILL BE A GEN
ERAL SUPERINTENDENT.
Sydney It. lnch has resigned his po
sition as manager of the electric
power department of the Missoula
Light and Water comt)pany and at the
end of this month will leave Missoula.
Mr. Inch goes to Salt Iakoe to boe
come genr'ai suplerintendent Of t.he
Utah Light & Power cimlany.
The Missouliatn yeslterdaly morning
printed ai news story of Ihe electrifi
cation of the Denver & Itio Grande
railway lines. The !lath LigJht &
Power company will supllply the power
for this electriflcaetln, which is one
of the most imnportant electrical un
dertaklings ever attemptled in tilhe west.
The power conlpany is a now cor
popation--a consolidation of a number
of small companies in C:olorado, Utah
and Idatho. It conltrit s more than
100,000 horse'lower viith w\atelr avail
able for more than lwier thati quan
tity. The principal power plants of
the company are nl 'lTlluride, Col.;
Logan, Ohnlsted, Jorsanll Narrows and
Battle Creek, Utah, :and at Grace,
Idaho. There are more than 1,000
miles of transmission lines connected
with the plants.
rSr. Inch was seen yesterday by a
Missoulian reporter, relative to his
proposed change. The reporter asked
if it were true that Mr. Inch had re
signed his Missoula positioln.
A Good Place.
"I have sent my rtesignation to Mr.
Clark," said Air. Inch, "and I expect
to leave Missoula at the end of the
present month. The whole matter has
r been very sudden and you are hardly
more surprised than v was. The offer
1 of the position in Utah came unex
t pectedly and it was so flattering that
I could not well decline. The field is
larger and the salary is enough larger
to be a material argument in favor
of the change. The development of
I the plans of the Utah company offers
an opportunity which is unusual and,
t though I much regret to leave MIs
soula, I do not see my way clear to
refuse the chance.
"I have been in Mlssoula almost
ten years. Seven years of that time;
8 I have been connected with the Clark
- properties. It has become so much
t my home that the change of location
.presents many unpleasant features. I
have many personal and business
friends here whom I dislike ,much to
,t leave. I have become much attached;
y to the city, which T have seen develop'
from a village into a metropolitan
n place. I shall always remember pleas-,
g antly my stay here."
d Mr. Inch said he had received no
e intimation as to what arrangement
- would be made to fill his place with
the Missoula company;
zer, New York; Cox, Ohio; Robinson,
Arkansas, and Hanna, North Dakota.
No business was transacted by the
senate, but a number of bills and reso
lutions were introduced in the house.
A joint committee was named by the
two houses to notify President Taft
that congress was ready to receilve his
comunlllllllioations. Senaitor Bacon, pres
itdent of the senate, appointed Sena

N(w York, Dec. 2.-Witnesses from
several statles tihiiifted today some
of the "perisol:l lettel rs" which Julian
Ir;awthorno wrote urging them to in

for the alleged promotion of which,
through the mails, Hawthorne, Joslahi
Qutney of oIst on and others are on

George ýM. Walker of Indinnapolls
testified that he had bought $450
worth of stock inl response to sonic
of Ilawthorni's letters, in one of
which IHawthorne said:
"Of course, I assume a certain nmor
atl responsibility in urging you to in

In another ]ie wrlle: "liAl Rrose and
other 'obalt mines are pyitig 12 per
cent, but w\e hav\e 20 such properties
in our T'emanugnmi holdings. Itne thing
my frllHs imay tin suro of is that I

Cass tlake, Minn., who said lhe was the
owner of 10,000 shares in the Itaw

thorno which said:
"We already have sold 450,000
shares and could sell from 2,000,000
to 3,000,000 between now and Christ

shares will be sold. I want to make
it clear that T am not a promoter.
You need have no fear about theI
mine,"
John 13. Collins, a retired comino

Chicago, Dec. 2.-Indictments and
arrests of more than aL score of per
sons in Chicago and the middle west
are expected soon as a restult of the
arrest of Dr. Nicholas It. Kern, Dr.
Edward It. Stalhutte and two alleged
accomplices, charged with being Inemi
bers of the largest hand of thieves
ever organized in this ,part of the
coulntry.
It developed today that every rail
road entering Chicago has been the
victim of the systematic thefts of val
nables from freight cars. At least
one large department store in Chi
cago and many smaller merchants
and commission men are expected to
be drawn into the case as receivers
or purchasers of the stolen goods, in

3UYING OF SOUTHERN PACIFIC
STOCK BY UNION PACIFIC
KILLED COMPETITITION.
DECISION IS IMPORTANT
Ilan Must Be Submitted Within.Three
Months for Breaking Up of Combine
and Restoring Stock to Original
Owners-Ruling for Basis for Other
Federal Suits.
Washington, Dec. 2.---The great
larriman mnergerl created when the
o'lon Pacific Railway company
oiught -I; per c'lnt of the stock
' the Soull ellrn Pacific system,
'ras split today by thie supreme court
if the United States as at violation of
h'e Sherman aoti-trust law.
Then, with the elld of thll mnrger
ibefore' it, the couirt sent forth its p-r
Itltolst declrator;tlt that "wlhile the
ilaw iti nott, he ahle to enftorce
'oinpetliitti, it can reach cotimbinations
that rhender competition impractic
ible."
Jus rtle Day announced the unant
mous opinion of the court. Justice
Vandevanter took no part In the con
sideration of the case today, but his
principal finding, when he was a cir
euit judge, to tihe effect that the two
roads were not competltive and there
fore no violation of the law, had re
sulted in the purchase, was reversed
and annulled.
Instead of following the reasoning
tof Justieii Vandevaniter and Judges
'anllhorn and AdamsltiH, the court in sub
stanet approved thie minority holding
tC JIldgie Itook that the roads were
co'ipetitors and that it. was just as
mnulh a, violatiton of the law for one
road to buy the controlling stock of
a cm ipetitor as it was for ia holding
company, as it twas In the Northern
Seculrities case, to ltury the controlling
stock of Itw ctmpetitint (t complanies.
As the Northernl Sectlritles company
plan failed nearly 10 years ago, so the
Iarrinian plan fell totlay.
Thle cirulli court of the District of
Utah was directed to supllervise the
separalion of the two roads after
hearings and in emergency to appoint
aI reolIver to sell the stock. The
tnion lPaciflc, If the circuit court sees
,proper, may retain control of the old
'entral Pacific line fromn Ogden to
S11n iFrancisco.
'itho decision iof the lower court that
