An Unparalleled Offer
Tie News and Citizen and the
Weekly Tribune for
$2.00.
Now is lie Tie to
We have made arrangements
with the publishers of the New
York Weekly Tribune to offer that
paper and the News and Citizen
the coming year to new subscribers
for the exceedingly low sum of
$2.00. Although we have a large
circulation, there are many families
in this county who do not take any
paper, and it is to reach these fam
ilies that we make this offer. For
$2.oo we give you the leading Re
publican Weekly of this country
and News and Citizen one year.
Tke-Tribune contains all the latest
news, the market reports, and de
votes much attention to farm topics.
It also gives considerable space to
the home circle. It is just the
paper for the farmer who wants
more general news than he gets in
the local paper.
We need not mention in detail
the merits of the News and Citi
zen. It is essentially the locai
paper of this section. It has e
correspondent in every section of
the county and the surrounding
towns, from whom we hear almost
every week. It gives all the prin
cipal local news items, and, taken
in connection with the Tribune,
enables the farmer to have all the
news both at home and abroad.
This offer is only made for the
month of December. It may and
may not continue in force after
January ist. Old subscribers may
have the Jrtbune and this paper
at the same price by paying al
arrearages.
So liberal an offer has never be
fore been made by us, but we wish
to largely increase our circulation
in Lamoille and vicinity, and to
accomplish the end have concluded
to offer this special inducement.
This offer is not extended to pres
ent subscribers of the Tribune.
Now is the time to subscribe.
There is no reference to the Pan-
Electric scandal on the part of Mr
Cleveland's message. But what could
he say that would be true and not
confess and condemn his failure to
free his Administration from a wretch
ed and corrupt scandal? No more
unsavory subject has ever been passed
over in silence by a President.
The old proposition is revived for a
" Steering Committee" of the major
ity in the House, to facilitate the
transaction of business. But the first
thing for the Democrats to do, says
the World, is to decide upon the
course which they want steered, and
to agree to support the Captain and
piipt in following it.
Our patrons are furnished this week
with a supplement, giving the laws
passed by the present Legislature, in
full. It will doubtless be found in
teresting reading matter for many of
our readers. It would be a good plan
to fold the sheet and keep it for future
reference.
The second trial of Boodle Alder
man McQuade is in progress in New
York. The probabilities are that the
prisoner will be acquitted, as Alder
man Duffy, one of the "squealers,"
as admitted that he lied in his testi
mony on the previous trial.
The women who want to vote can
not complain of neglect. "Wednesday,
the third day of Congress, Senator
Blair (Eep.) moved the consideration
of the select committee's proposition
in regard to Woman Suffrage and
made a speech in ita favor.
FROM WASHINGTON.
From our Regular Correspondent.
Washington, D. C,
Dec. 4, 1886. j
When Congress meets on Monday
next, the President's message will be
ready to be placed before it. It is
probable, however, that the document
will be withheld until Tuesday, when
both Houses will be ready to hear it
read. Ex-President Arthur, Senator
Pike, and Representatives Beach and
Arnot have died during the recess,
and if the announcement of these
deaths is formally made after the roll
call they will be followed by adjournments.
It is possible that the House of
Representatives will begin a much
needed reform by proceeding with its
business up to a late hour in the af
ternoon, when the fact that these mem
bers have died can be mentioned and
the body then adjourn.
Thiar would be a peculiarly fitting
occasion on which to inaugurate such
a reform, for it was no other than one
of the deceased members, Mr. Beach,
of New York, who had so much to
say last session against the time wast
ed by Congress in adjournments out
of respect for deceased members, and
in eulogies over them. He asked Con
gress to adopt a resolution relegating
memorial services to Sunday during
the session in order to correct the
tvil of the present system, and ad
journments out of respect to the dead
he thought should never be in order.
According to a time honored cus
torn, when the death of a Senator or
Representative is formally announced,
an adjournment is always taken for
that day. That is one day lost. Then
another day is lost when the memorial
services are held, and sometimes these
memorial days come towards the close
of the session, when it seems almost
criminal to spare time from the pub
lic business.
The Senate Chamber and the Hall
of the House are in readiness. The
doors of both are draped in mourning
for the late ex-President, and chairs
and desks in both indicate by their in
closing folds of blat;k that their form
er occupants are dead.
Members of both Houses of Con
gress arrive on every incoming train,
and many of them are busy just now
in looking around for winter quarters.
Col. Morrison has been here for sev
eral days, but declines to be inter
viewed, on the ground that he has
talked too much already since the
election. He charges up his defeat
to the White House apathy, however, !
and drops the remark that he found
defending the administration a very
unpleasant task. His defeat has not
changed his course, and he will spring
up his tariff reform bill again at the
first opportunity. His hair and beard
have whitened rapidly of late, and he
has surprised the Jiabitues of Pennsyl
vania Avenue with a brand new silk
hat, the first, I believe, for ten years.
But while Mr. Morrison will appeal
for the acceptance of his tariff bill, as
usual, he has no expectation of suc
ceeding. He. realizes that harmoni
ous Democratic action would be nec
essary to secure any tariff revision
this winter, and be sees no reason to
hope for such concentration of force
on any measure accomplishing mate
rial reductions.
Senator Mahone is delighted at the
prospects of a Republican victory in
Virginia in 1888. Said he, "When
every vote cast in the Slate can be
honestly counted, Virginia will show
a majority of 40,000." The Demo
crats, he say3 have already lost the
while districts and he does not see
much for them to expect in the future.
The President's recent bad temper
and irritable state of mind was ex
piaineu oy an onicial announcement
that he wa3 suffering from an attack
of rheumatism in his knees. His
malady is quite painful and annoying,
as ne cannot walk, but only shuffle
around the room with the assistance
of a cane. No physician has been
called to see him yet, and he has not
had lime to relax work on his mes
sage.
Mr. Hearst, the California million
aire, whom the Governor appointed to
fill the vacancy made in the Senate
last session by the death of Senator
Miller, will not come back to the Sen
ate this winter. The Legislature elec
ted Tn his place a Mr. Williams, a
merchant who is friendly to the Cen
tral Pacific railroad, to serve out Mr
Miller's term, which expires in March.
The Legislature which meets this win
ter will elect a Senator for the full
term, and the Central Pacific will do
its utmost to elect its man. Mr.
Hearst, whose wife is socially ambi
tious, and who himself enjoyed his
experience here last winter, will fight
the railroad, backed by a certain
$30,000,000 firm for whom he did
good service as a mining inspector
iiiis clash or millionaires for a seat
in the U. S. Senate will be watched
with interest.
The posthumous review of the war
by General McClellan has appeared,
and as the work of a man who played
a conspicuous part in the early years
oi ine war, it will attract attention.
The radical differences of opinion in
the ISorth concerning McClellan's mer
its will be revived by the book, which
treats savagely of the contests be
tween McClellan on the one side, and
Stanton and Ualleck on the other.
with Lincoln as the umpire between
them. McClellan returns to his
charge that the Republican leaders
did not wish him to bring the war to
an end in 1862, for they were deter
mined to prolong it, he says, until its
settlement should involve the abolition
of slavery. Over this point, which
McClellan claims explains his removal
from the command of the army, a
renewed controversy will doubtless
spring up, as in other disputed mat
ters upon which he presents his argu
ments, and in which, unfortunately,
he does not agree with other author
ities equally reliable and trustworthy.
It is definitely ascertained that the
Democratic majority in the House of
Representatives of the Fiftieth Congress
will be 15. neat a come-down from
1881!

We publish below Senate bill 79,
together with the Governor's veto
message, which has been the subject
of some unfavorable comment among
those who were not familiar with the
bill and have not had an opportunity
to read the message. The Governor's
reasons for the veto would seem to
be sufficient to satisfy all reasonable
people of the correctness of his posi
tion :
It is hereby enactedby the General As
sembly of the State of Vermont:
That the nature of alcoholic drinks
and narcotics, and special instruction
as to their effects upon the human
system, in connection with the sever
al divisions of the subjects of physi
ology and hygiene, shall be included
in the branches of study taught in the
common or public schools of the State,
and shall be studied and taught as
thoroughly and in the same manner
as ofher required branches are in said
schools, by the nse of text books in
the hands of pupils where other
branches are thus studied in said
schools, and by the pupils in every
grade in all schools under public con
trol throughout the State.
Sec. 2. The object and intent of this
law being to teach the reasons for total
abstinence from alcoholic drinks and
narcotics, therefore text-books to be
used in obedience to section one by
pupils in primary, and intermediate
grades 6hall give at least one-fourth
of their soace to the consideration of
the nature and effects of alcoholic
drinks and narcotics, and for high
school use the text-book shall contain
at least twenty pages or matter re
lating to this subject.
Sec. 3. It shall be the duty of the
proper officers in control of any schoul
described in section one of this act to
enforce the provisions of this statute ;
and any teacher who shall neglect or
refuse to comply with the requirements
of this act shall be discharged and the
vacancy filled as in other cases ; and
any such officer, school committee or
superintendent who shall neglect or
fail to make proper provisions for the
instruction required and in the man
ner specified by the first and second
sections of this act, for all pupils in
each and every grade of all schools
under his or her jurisdiction, may be
cited before any Judge of the Supreme
Court upon complaint of any voter in
such town, and upon hearing, such
Judge shall make such order in the
premises as will secure & full compli
ance wit'i the piovisions of this act,
and may punish any disobedience of
such order a.s in cases of contempt,
iso public monev 3hall be paid over
to the treasurer of a union or other
district unless the register of such
district shall show that the nature and
effects of alcohol drinks and narcotics
have been studied by the pupils in
each and every grade of the school ol
said district.
Any town superintendent making a
false certificate in the foregoing par
ticulars shall be fined a sum not ex
ceeding one hundred dollars and not
less than twenty-five dollars, to be re
covered upon indictment or informa
tion. Sec. 4. Text-books on physiology,
in use in the schools when this law
goes into lorce, that do not comply
with its letter or spirit shall be
changed for such books as are de
scribed in section two of this act.
without reference to previous legisla
tion forbidding the change of school
b oks for a given period, except where
c'M tracts have previously been made.
Sec. 5. All acts or parts of acts
heretofore enacted referring to the
study of "physiology and hygiene
which shall have special prominence
to the effects of stimulants and nar
cotics upon the human system," or to
the selection of text-books to be used
in the pursuance of that study are
hereby repealed, except those refer
ring to the examination of teachers in
this branch.
Sec 6. This act shall take effect
from its passage, but the penalties ap
pertaining thereto shall apply only to
cases of non-entorcement occurring
after March 1st, 1887.
THE GOVERNOR S MESSAGE.
To the President of the Senate :
Sir: I have the honor to return to
the Senate, whence it originated, Sen
ate bill No. 79, entitled "an act to
provide for the study of Scientific
Temperance in the public schools ol
the State of Vermont,", without the
executive approval.
It is a matter of great regret that
an act having for its purpose an object
and end of great merit and applicable
to a subject of unequaled public solici
tude and concern, should be so framed
as to be obnoxious to well founded
principles of law, but believing it to
be so obnoxious, and being so advised
by the best authority at hand, my
course in the premises is plain and in
exorable.
Passing over many minor objections
that might be well taken to other parts
of the bill, I confine my objections to
section three.
There is no provision as to how the
alleged offender is to be cited before
the Judge, or whether the complaint
shall be written or oral.
The tribunal before which the trial
is to be had is not known to our sys
tem of law, or our constitution. A
Judge of the Supreme Court is not of
himself a court.
This section contemplates a sum
mary hearing by a Judge without or
dinary process, and apparently with
out jurisdiction. A party alleged to
have violated a statute is entitled to
a jury trial, which this act denies him.
There is no provision for any record
of the process, the pleadings or the
proceedings ; there is no clerk of the
court provided, but the Judge is to
decide the matter off-hand, construe
the law according to his best jud
ment, without revision or right of ap
peal, and is to punish disobedience of
his own order as in cases of contempt.
In a proceeding of contempt there
is no limit upon the amount of fine or
the extent of imprisonment which a
Judge may impose. Proper cases for
the exercise of this power are rare,
and it docs not naturally or pioperly
apply to the enforcement of statutes
Such a method of administering jus
tice might perhaps be efficient in re
spect to all our laws ; it would appar
ently be as proper in respect to other
statutes as to this, but it would be
decidedly novel in form and rather in
accordance with the oriental methods
than with the principles of constitu
tional government.
These considerations are of special
weight in view of the fact that the
first and second sections are certainly
susceptible of construction which
would require the pupils of primary
classes to be provided with text-books
before they have mastered the alpha
bet, and that these text-books should
be kept in their hands and in daily
use year after year, in every grade of
the school system.
As 1 have before 6aid, the object of
the bill ia highly commendable, but I
believe it is encumbered by a provis
ion that is unconstitutional, and which
is certainly a violation of well recog
nized principles which lie at the foun
dation of our government.
I can but conclude that the bill, as
to the features and provisions to
which your attention is hereby called,
passed the two houses without a full
understanding of them.
Therefore, I return it without my
approval. Ebeneezer J. Ormsbee.

REPORT OF GRAND JURY.
To the Hon., the Co. Court, within and for the
County of Lamoille, now in session:
The Grand Jury in attendance upon said Court,
have the honor to submit that in our judgement
we have diligently examined all matters pre
sented to us, or coming within our observation
throughout the county, and within our province,
and have made such findings as is wise, in the
due execution of the criminal law.
We have also examined the Jail and find it
warm, cleanly, and apparently safe, and the
prisoners as well provided for as the circum
stances demand. II. A. Waterman, Foreman.

Resolutions.
At a meeting of the Lamoille Coun
ty Bar Association held on Saturday
action was taken on the death of two
of its members, G. L. Waterman and
C. C. Burke. Messrs. Wilkins, Gleed
and Brigham were appointed a com
mittee to draft suitable resolutions,
which were adopted at the afternoon
session of court, and ordered printed
in the News and Citizen and entered
upon the Clerk's record. As a mark
of respect the court took a recess ol
one hour. Following are the resolu
tions :
GEORGE I. WATERMAN.
. ...... That I ti t Twl daafli if nnr irAt1i a.
UUUUtlil'l 111.1, ... i.v. i. ill ill 11 ii i iii.iiiii i ,
ftenrce L. Waterman, we realize that the Bar
of this State, and especially of this county, has
lost one of Its Drigntesi ornaments.
He was a ripe, good scholar in all the learning
of tue schools, ana posse sseu a minu so consti
tuted that he readily grasped and fully compre-
nenuea an me leauuig principles ot general
jurisprudence, and was enabled to apply them
with the greatest readiness and accuracy to
cases, as thev arose in practice, so that he per
ceived at once all there was of a given case,
which was the secret of his extraordinary skill
and success in the trial of cases. Though he
was familiar with the reported cases, he was no
mere case lawyer; but to him the light of prin
ciple shea its clear illumination upon tne most
complicated combination oi iacts, anu tne solu
tion was not difficult or uncertain.
In all the relations of life, private and public,
he habitually manifested those qualities which
characterize the real gentleman. As a profes
sional man, witn singular constancy anu cer
tainty, his opinion was the law. As a member
of society, his bearing and deportment towards
his bretnern and to all others was mat of a man
of the kindliest nature, improved and beautified
by the highest culture.
The good and the great, as well as those less
distinguished, must fall before the scythe of
the great Destroyer. Our grief is only assuaged
by the reflection that their places may be filled
by those of honorable and high aspirations
coming alter tnein.

Petroleum V. Nasby on Socialism
I bate a capitalist, no matter how
he becum one. I hate the meen-spir-ited,
grovelin retch wich will work ten
or more hours a day, deprivin hisself
of beer, and terbacker, and cards,
and bilyards, and hos racin, and sich,
savin peny by peny til he hez ground
enough out of the world to hev a shop
uv his own, and to employ other men
te slave fur him, and thus go on accu
mulatin till he owns things. Smb.
men are monopolists, and the enemies
of labor, and grinders.
I hold that the possession of a ten
dolar bil ma'tes a monopolist, and al
sich should be crushed. Ez havin a
ten dolar bil makes a man a monopo
list, his monopolism increases jist in
proporshen to the ten dolar bils he
hez. The owner uv a factory is a en
emy to the human race, and es fur the
man who bilV.s a railroad, he
"Is a monster of such hidgus meen.
That to be hated needs but to be seen."
My natred or railroad managers is
intens. It commenst the first time
wuz droped off the hind platform uv
a trane for not paying fare, and hez
increst with every repetishun uv the
ofeuse, which generally happens every
time I want to so anywhere. I lothe
the ralerode monopolist.
A gnndin monopolist is any man
wich hez anything. Whenever a man
hez saved anythin, he becomes a cap
italist, and ez capitalists are danger
ous to labor, he should be made to
divide it up, so ez to be on an ekality
with them which never saved nothing,
The mechanic or workinsman wich
saves so ez to own a house or a farm,
beeomes a capitalist, and consekently
a gnnain monopolist, and accumola
aliens are dangerous to labor, wat he
liez shud be confiskated and divided
up among us wich hezn't anything
Property ez a crime.
I aint jist shoor that I hev got the
socialistic doctrine down fine enuff,
but I think these definisbuns will do.
espeshly when you howl'om under a
red flag, to luver3 uv humanity wich
