speaker desired to have recourse to Ilia proper
measure* to evert such a calamity.
According to the very highest authority, in
cluding the President, the Secretary of War,
the General of the Army. (Jen. Orel, and nil the
©Akers on duty on the Texas frontier, there Is
NOT TUB SLIGHTEST DANGER
of nnv outbreak with Mexico. How the exag
gerated stories of any trouble obtained circula
tion these gentlemen are tinnßleTo tell. The
members of the Military Committee are not loss
positive In their assurances to the snrrto effect.
Three members of that Committee, repre
senting both political parties, said to-day
that they haa no apprehensions what
ever of any angry discussions between
tho two Governments. The Committee nas
been engaged three weeks, and have examined
the Secretary of War, (leu. Slicrman, Gen.
Ord, (Jen. Mason, Oen. Clliz, CapL .Johnson,
and others, besides the papers and reports from
officers on the frontier and War Dcnartmcnt
documents. The Committee learn that the Rio

tieths oi tho Inhabitants on the Texas Itordcr
arc .Mexicans; that tlm raiders arc nearly all In
dians, with a tew outlaws and fugitives; that
they make Incursions on our soil, rob and
steal, and hide among the chapparci, or
with the half-breeds, and that they did Dlls
quite as much flUcen years ago as now. Tho
Committee consider Diaz friendly to tho Utiitcd
{States, but, that owing to complications, he;
CANNOT CONTROL TUB RORDBRS.
Tho Committee Is satisfied that tho troops
noar the border are intended to prevent rather
than provoke hostilities. The Committee do
not understand why Dla* has not been rec
ognised b; the Administration. Tho order to
(ten. Ord, Issued Juno Ist lost, to pursue mar
auding parties across the border, or a
fresh trad, has resulted, according to Informa
tion before the Committee, In three raids, In
which wero captured seventy-two head of
horses, and where four Indians were killed.
This was the whole story from which there has
been so much oulerv. ’The Secretary of War
aavs to-night that neither ho nor the Govern
ment desire war nor expect on outbreak. The
representative of tho Diaz Government here
has been informed that tho Committee
WILL HBAR HIM
If ho desires, and ho has given notice that he
will he present at the meeting to-morrow. The
incmi>cr* of tho Foreign Affairs Committee
have already heard Gen. Ord and some other
army officers on Ihe *nbjcct of the possibility
of International difficulties with Mexico. A few
of them, from the evidence taken and from
facts known to everybody, have expressed
opinions of the members of tbo Committee.
Sam Cox Is represented as being very appre

Hamilton, of Indiana, who is a very pro
nounced Bourbon, shares these views. Bcnlclch
cr, of Texas, has long been apprehensive of
serious disturbances, unless our force on tho
border should be increased. Monroe, of Ohio,
does not think there bas been any evidence to
warrant the inference that war Is probable, and
ihe majority of tho Committee agree with Mon
toe. Marsh, of Illinois,—a member of the Mili

taken by that Committee, there Is uo reason to

Mr. Matthewa tuun called up from the table tho
concurrent resolution submitted by him on Thurs
day last, declaring the right of the Government to
pay the principal and interest of bonds In silver
dollars containing 412 H grama standard silver.
Mr. Matthews said the Houeral Assembly of (be
Slate of Ohio at Us session last winter adopted a
resolution favoring the restoration of the silver
dollar. This resolution wo* possod with great
uoammUy, there being bnt three negative votes In
(he Uouao of Representatives end one in the
bensle, and he had no doubt that It expressed tho
considerate and deliberate opinion of the people In
that btate on (bo subject wltn the same unanimity
as was evidenced br their representatives in tho
passage of the resolution. He had been moved In
part by that resolution to submit Uu one now be
lore the Senate, ibungb bis resolution did not
cover the whole ground. That of tho
Üblo Assembly expressed the opinion Must such
restoration of (be silver dollar was domsnded by
true financial wisdom, and declared It would be in
pursuance of the proper public policy to do so. It
was nut his purpose now to discuss the prop
osition as to what would oe expedient and politic lor
the Government and people to do, uni what would
be right to do. In his opinion it would be rlgnt for
the Government to do so, and be used the word
right Id It* legal, equitable, and noral sense. It
ws* bis purpose 10-dav hrlelly to show that by (he
teller and spirit of the law tbu Guvvroimmtbad the
right to restore lhe silver dollar, and would be
Justified Id doing so, and further to show that,
outside of tho law, Using In view alt the clrcutu
stances of tbu cose, every Incident of financial leg
islation, the restoration of the dollar would
nut bo a violation of the declaration of public
honor, public Justice, or public equity.
He then quoted from the act to strengthen tha
public credit approved March lit, Ihdu, sud argued
that the word • * cola " as asud In this act must not
be Interpreted to refer to gold cum alone. If U
must be so interpreted then It would be ju*l as die
hußoraulu. Just as Illegal to pay the United States
Treasury notes pow circulating os money In any- I
thlnx else but gold com as it would bo to pay I
bunds with anything but such coin. There were I
Senators here who were familiar with clrcum- |
stances auendiutr tne passage of this law, and the
history of the legislation antecedent to Us passage.
The question that 1. was designed to solve wo* not
a doubtful one (the greenoucks had tuaue
Ivaal-teiUir fur ull debts and demands, puollc ami
private, except Interest on the public debt
and fur customs duties. The question had there
fore been agitated a* to whether thepr.ncipul of the
dsht might nut lawfully be paid In greenbacks,
and to meet the question, to answer it in the
negative, tbu puollc cteuit act of Ibtill was passed.
In uls uolnlou the original ludebteoncss of the
country could never have bueu liquidated with suy
other currency than coin dollar. It would nut

He then referred to tho specie Rcsnmp-
Hop act of 187 fl. and stated that prior
to the passage of that act. hut sub
sequent to the act of 1870, to-wlt: hy the act of
1873, a now coinage was established which dropped
from the list of authorised coins of tiio I nltcd
States what had always been known to oor law n*

not affect holders of bond*. The recital* contained

Justified the conclusion that It was necessary fur
the OnveniMHil to retrace its slew*, and restore
tno law a* it was prior to 1873, pat buck tho silver

all bonds,and. to do so would not be In violation of

pnblte creditors. The Government, In order to
keep Itself in a position to perform tue contract
according to it* letter and spirit, should restore
the silver dollar ami keep U lust as it was, u full
and complete legal-tender. Senators were not act

private or individual Interests: they were here aa
representatives of a great pnono interest; they
were here as trustee* of the nation, trustee* of It*
honor ns well a* bf It pecuniary Interest, but
bound to act a* trustees according to the universal-
ly acknowledged principle* of right and law. \\ hat
right hud Senators to giro away one particle of
that great tm.»llc domain of power which consti
tuted Urn public rfclitl They were the conserva
tor* of It. The President of tbo United btstes
could only speak for the people In the limited
channel* marked oat for him by tho Constitution.
When he (Mutilicwsi heard tho talk that it was
the expectation of tho purchaser of tho bonds that
bceanso he pnld gold for tbem he must receive
gold, he asked who had given oat snch expecta
tion. Where bad the people so spoken.—through
what channel, through what agency? Lot tho
record bo produced.
There wero consideratlone of another nature
which Invited discussion, and into which perhaps
tho Senate ought to go, into which perhaps eomo
who wonld take part in the discussion would nec
essarily go. but he wonld only briefly refer to
them. It had been said tnat silver had depredated
in valnc. How was the loss measured? Uy gold.
Why not say gold bad opprcclated in value?
Mr. Eaton—Ua* not silver depreciated In tba
purchase of every product?
Mr. Matthew*—l answer silver can to-day bay
more of every known product of labor than It
could in July, ißTO.nore and In Asia. Nowhere
in ihe world has silver depredated the breadth ofa
hair. On the contrary, it hits maintained it* posi
tion. It can buy to-day more land, more houses,
more calico, more everything, than It could in
1870.
Mr. Eaton said he agreed with the Senator that
It could in America, cut It could not abroad.
Mr. Matthews—What have wo to do with abroad?
What have wo to do wtta the inquiry whether lunds
and houses abroad have appreciated or not? W'ho
I* there who docs not know from actual personal
observation that evorytntng haa gone down, and
that gold slooe ha* gone ul. Nothing could pre
vent persons from seeing that but the blindness of
those who had Joined the conspiracy to exalt gold
as the king of money.
Mr. Edmunds euid, taking tho remarks of tbo
-Senator to ho true about silver and gold, wny would
not bla philosophy apply as well to copper ami
gold.
Mr. Matthowa—Wo did not agree to pay in
copper.
Mr. Edmunds then asked if the Senator from
Ohio woe quite sure cold had appreciated, and if
the price of silks In France In gold was ao high as
fire years ago.
Mr. Matthews, resuming his argument, said be
had the testimony of his own personal experience,
tbo testimony of tho list of Iwmcmptcies tarough
out the country, tbo testimony of tho list of
sheriffs* sale*, to tho effect that everything but
gold bad depreciated in value. What else meant
all this cry of discontent? What else meant all
this murmur of dissatisfaction? The distress of
tbe country now was beyond oil historical com- |
parlsoo in our country, and It would take nut a few i
more turns of the wheel tu throw tbe great mass i
of our people Hilo bankruptcy. i
In conclusion Mr. Matthews argued that If tula
appreciation of gold shall continue, the best in
vestment possible would bo to lock It un and wait i
Its appreciation. t
Sir. Morrill said If the Senator from Ohio bad in- i
troducud this resolution and asked its reference to i
tbe Committee on tbe Judiciary, he might have i
understood bis purpose. The question raised by i
bis resolution was a legal one. Whenever tbe ,
main question came up as to tbe remonetisation of i
silver bo (Morrill) would be prepared to express i
his views upon it. and be boned to oe able to show <
that It would bo cheaper and bolter for tbe United
btatos to pay its debts in gold. . .
The Senator rrom Ohio (Matthews) bad set out
with the declaration that wo bad thu equitable ami
lejal right to pay our bonds In silver, it must bo
known to that Senator that for forty years tbu i
country had nut coined silver dollars except for i
exportation, and only a small amount i
for such purpose. During all this i
time the Government hud been In
receipt of gold from customs duties, every dollar of j
whicu was pledged for the psyment of the puollc i
debt. Could it bo possible now that Congress i
could soy » debt so contracted ci>a)d be paid In
anything else hut gold! He quoted from tbe act
of tbo ufltb of Feoraary, 1 Stiff, to establish a sink
ing fund, etc., and sold If that act should be ear
ned out tbo whole deal of tbe Government would
jo paid In a very short time, it did seem to him
that the public filth had been pledged to pay the
bonds In gold coin. Our Secretaries of tnu
Treasury had given Such pledges, and their acts
bad never been repudiated oy Congress. Ho
quoted from Bcc. 4 of thu Fourteenth Amendment
to the Constitution of tuo United States lu regard
to the validity of tbe public dent, and said that
amendment was taunted to prevent those from
tne Southern Mutes questioning lu validity, omt
not to tight the heresies of Ohio. Now In this
time of reconciliation. when Southern repre
sentatives Uso been robaptwed in patriotism, he ap
pealed to thorn to reject the proposition of too
Senator from Ohio.
There were various other points of that Senator's
speech to which bo would llxe to refer, but ouo
point In particular he could not pass. The Senator
spoko of locking up money to order to gum there
by. Did ho not know tout there never bad been a
time In the history of the Government when money
could be obtained more readily or at less Interest?
He moved the reference of the resolution to the
Committee on the Judiciary.
Ur. Conklingsald be wished to submit an amend
ment brfore Us reference. and that was to strike
out the words: “lie it resolved, by lbs Senate, the
HouseoflUcpresontalives concurring therein,” and
insert In Ilea thereof the words: *♦ Resolved by
the Senate sad House of Representative*.” He
•aid bis purpose was to make It a Joint resolu
tion instead of a concurrent resolution, so. If It
was adopted. It would go to the President for his
signature. The National Executive bad deposited'
with him one-sixth of the legislative power, and.*
In a case of such Importance as this be thought
there should be an expression of tne full legtsla

By Mr. Kelley—A resolution amending the rules
of the House so that tt will only be In order to sus
pend tho rules upon the second ami fonrth Monday
in each month, and during the last six days of tbo
session.
Mr. Wood. Chairman of the Committee on Wnya
and Means, reported tho usual resolution’ for tne
distribution of the President's annual message
among Ihe various committees. The subjects re
ferred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs are the
war between Russia and Turkey, the rcuowal of
tbo treaty between tho United States and Italy,
questions as to naturalization* and commerce
between tho United states and Germany, tho
French Exposition, extradition articles of tho
treaty of 1842 between tho United States and
Great Britain, a treaty with Great Britain for the
protection of trade-marks, recognition ofprealdcnt
Dlbj! of Mexico, and difficulties on tho Uto Grande
border, tho Insurrection tn Cuba and interference
therein with Ihe rights of American citizens and
other unsettled questions with Fpa.n, the unset
tled claims of American clttxon* Against Venezuela,
relations with the Central ami Sooth American
States, and thu proposed recognition of the Gov
ernment of the Samoan Islands.
Mr. Hewitt (N. Y.) moved to amend tho resolu
tion In reference to (he Committee on Foreign Af
fairs by adding toll these words: “And that tbo
Committee ou Foreign Affairs take into Immediate
consideration the best means of removing existing
and impending causes of difficulty between Mexico
and the United Slates, and of confirming and en
larging commercial relations between the two
countries, hy treaty or otherwise, and hare leave
to report tho result of Its deliberations, by resolu
tion or otherwise, to the House at the earliest
practicable day.”
He went on to say: Tho peculiar language em
ployed hr the President in speaking of this matter
attracteu mv attention when tho message was read.
I venture to call the attention of the House to the
peculiar phraseology employed. Uis as follows:
'•While l do nut anticipate an Interruption of
friendly relations with Mexico, yet 1 cannot but
look with some solicitude upon a continuance
of border disorders as exposing tbe' two
countries to Initiations of popular feeling and
mischances of action wnlch are naturally anravor
sole to complete amltr. Firmly determined
that nothing shall be wanting on my part to pro
mote a good nudurstanding between tbe two na
tions. I yet must ask the attention of Congress to
tho actual occurrenees on tbe border, that the lives
and property of oar citizens may bo adeuuately
protected ond peace preserved." And Mr. Hewitt
continuing, said: ‘‘This passage looks in two di
rections, Janus-like, either toward peace or to
ward war. and if by any possibility we should bu
plunged into hostilities with our neighbor, it will
be alleged that Congress had duo notice and should
bare token acttunln tho premises. This consider
ation has induced mo to examine with some care
tbo message of the President which was transmit
ted to this House on tho hth of November, and
which was referred tJlhc’Commlltcc on Foreign
Affairs. Tho perusal of tbo documents accom
panying that missive will convince tbo House
that onr relations with Mexico nre In a very
critical condition. Already several detachments
of troops, acting nndcr tho orders of the President
transmitted to Con. Uni, have Invaded Mexican
territory against the protest of the de facto Gov
ernment of that country, which, although it has
been in power lunger than tho present Administra
tion, has not yet been formally recognized by our
Government. At this present moment a detach
ment of American tru 'ps Is npon Mexican soil, but
where no one knows, and if It should turn out that
it has been captured, or that a conflict lias toaun
between it and the Mexican troops whereby
has boon abed, It must bo acknowledged tbat
tbe danger of war will be very imminent. If not
unavoidable. Wo cannot shut our eyes to these
dangers. The country does not want war. It do
■ires a time of rest io recover from tbe losses of
war. It desires an opportunity io strengthen it
self In order to meet tho obligation* which It hue
Incurred daring n lung and dunUuctlvo strug
gle. A new war will add to these ob
ligations, and make the burden of debt and
pressure of taxation intolerable. What tho coun
try desires Is to make them loss, and there Is no
method of reducing these Durdens so effectually as
to enlarge our trade with the neighboring coun
tries. Mexico offers the moat Inviting fluid, as
well as tbo nearest nrenue of sucu extension of
trade. Our people desire to cultivate jwaceful re
lations with a customer so near and valuable, und
all will agree that iiiu establishment of better com
mercial relations will be tbe eurest guarantee of
peace. If a system of uescoful exchange ot com
modities ujion terms of reciprocity could be estab
lished along the borders of the Ilia (iramie, Instead
of tbe present system of raids and repnsols, hostile
collisions would euon be replaced by friendly com
petition, and angry recrimination* by kindly
greetings. This Mexican question must Ihi mot
and solved la some way, cither by war, which no
one duslres, or bt n protectorate, which
line been discussed and condemned hy the general
Judgment of the country, or, by closer commercial
relations, enlarging the ties of mutual interest
and cementing the natural harmony which should
exist between nations producing products so dis
similar us to invite and compel exchanges favor
able to both. >Vo have no right to toko the risks
of war when the paths of ponce sru open to us.
At least, ae the stronger and older notion, we are
bound by obvious cuiidderetlone of uiijmnnlmUv
to exhaust every effort towards a peaceful eolation
of the ousting troubles, and a substitution
through treaties of reciprocity of mutual Interest
for antagonism of passion and plunder. The dan
ger is that, if tuts Congress should adjourn with
out devising some peaceful solution, wemuy find
ourselves, when we cumo back again, compelled
to vote upou questions of supply tor military op
erations wblcu wo cannot cofnao to make without
an imputation upon oar patriotism and public
spirit.
Mr. lisle—l hope the amendment offered by the
gentleman from New York (Hewitt) will bo
adopted. It is in Ihe right direction. The coun
try does not want war on anyfwoe ihxl has been
tailed or in likely to oe raised.
Mr. Reagan agreed that it was not well to Invoke
war, and that It was the duly of the (Jovemmeut,
If the way was open, to resort to peaceful inodes,
and to Improve Ihe commercial ana friendly rela
tions of the bulled Katesaud Mexico rather than
to resort to any plan looking to war. lie intimated,
however, that the existence of what ts known as
the ••free 2anc," in Mexico, was an obstacle to
commercial intercourse.
Mr. Cox jN. Y.> favored Iboamonimant.
Mr. Stephen* said: “I have looked upon this
question of border trouble* tu Texas with acep
Interest. I believe tbe fouling pervades Hit* whole
country. If war can be prevented It ought tube.

since he has been In Washington there had been an

him occasionally, to the effect that the

Involved In war with Mexico, and he was clad to

aure tbo country did not want war with Mexico,
and did not wish to treat a weak sister Republic
with less generosity than tt treated a great State.

OIIOITLS,
Boeeial nuonlcfi io TfifChlettm Tribune.
Cmsvei.asd, 0., Dec. 10.—As two (gentlemen
were passing through Lake View Cemetery, In
this city, yesterday afternoon, they discovered
that a newly-made crave had been opened, and
thatthn head and shoulders of the corpse of an
old lady protruded above ground, bent over the
edge of the grave. The face was half-burled tn
the loose dirt which bad boon thrown'out of
the grave. After tbe horror of the first mo
ment was dispelled, tbo'men hastened to the
village and related their discovery* In a few
moments a curious crowd was at the cemetery.
The police were promptly on hand to keep or
der and secure anv evidence that might
bo of value.. Tbo body-snatchers had
opened the grave at the head, and, digging
down and around the coffin, bad sawed away
the’wood from Just below the shoulders, and,
fastening a book In the mouth, had drawn the
body out of tbo coffin and nearly out of the
grave, when, It Is surmised, the earth must
have caved In, and so wedged the body In the
grave that It cottld not be got out. They must
have struggled hard to remove their horrible
plunder even then, for a terrible gash, extend
ing from tbe mouth across one cheek, ’ showed
where tbo hook had slipped and torn and man
eled the corpse. The men must have either
been frightened or discouraged then, as they did
nut attempt to dig awav the earth that had
caved In. The police found a shovel and a saw
used ia opening the <*ulllu. The body was that
of Airs, bear Williams, was 08 years of age, and
who recently had a tumor weighing eighty
pounds removed from her person, She is sup
posed to have died from the affects of the opera
tion.* Mrs. Williams died m Massltloli, 0., and
her remains wore brought on and Interred here
Friday last. A plalu gold ring which was on
her Anger at the time she was
burled •Is missing, which would go
to show that the work whs
dune cither by professionals or mea hired for
tho work. It Is rumorul that Mrs. Will
iams was suffering from another tumor at the
time of her death, and that this proved the In
centive for the violation of the grave to those
who hud herad the report. A young man who
was passing through tho cemctcrv Saturday
night says bo saw two men nm away from tho
direction of this snot, and thinks they were then
frightened irom tuolr work.

Nbw YonK, Dee. 10.—Uobcrt L. Case's conn*
sol, who have worked every means known to
tUc law, to-day succeeded In getting .* stay of
execution, which will probably leave the sen
tenced man In the Tombs for some months. In
regard to this result the Timet says: "The
looseness of our Judicial system* when applied
to the punishment of men guilty bf breaches of
trust, was turned to good account by the coun
sel ot Robert L. Case. Judge Brady having de
cided adversely the motion for a stay of exe
cution, Judge Dykoman, of Wustchcstor,
was again found ready to grant It.
Judge Brady very properly remarked that
If the exercise ot Judicial discretion la such a
matter were madu to depend on caprice Instead
of the dictates of duty, the odinltdsiralltfh ot
criminal Justice would bo deprived of Us cblef
elements—promptitude of arrest and trial and
cortamtv In the consequences. Whatever be
the motives of Judge Dykman's course, it bos
pro.iscdv the effect Indicated by Judge Brady,
and it affords a very emphatic reminder of the
necessity ot -so amending the rides of Judicial
procedure as to render Impossible the interfer
ence of the Judges ot one district with the de
cisions of those ot another."

business. Its proprietors bod been endeavor
ing to secure so accession ol capital from an
Eastern party wbo thought of going Into busi
ness with them, but lulled to do so, sad, there
upon. they determined to go into voluntary
liquidation. Tbey thought Ibis a more equita
ble fnclbod toward all their creditors
than to go on with an unprofitable
business, subject to the contingencies of a panic
or run which might leave some of them out in
the void altogether. It was thought best,
therefore, to have a Receive* appointed, and, on
application to the District Court, in euuiormlty
with tbo eipressed desire of a largo number of
the creditors, Mr. J. 8. Crew was appointed lie
