In regard to Ihe "Kn Klux Laws" the

Detailed ststements ef the disburse

will be famished by the report of the At

been somewhat increased by the recent
sets of

the laverai States of the Union, end to
enforce the provisions of the Kourtccth
Amendment to the Constitution of the li
nked States end the amendments thereto,
I cannot question the necessity and salu
tary effects of those enactments,
less and lawlsss men, I regret to say, have
associated themselves together in some lo- \
calitiea to deprive other citixena of these
rights, gtlaraateed to them by the Consti
tution of Ihe United States, and to that
end hav* committed deeds of blood and
violettes, bat the prosecution and punish
ment of many of these person* have tend
ed greatly to tha repression of such dis
orders. I do not doubt that a great ma
jority of tha peopla in ill parts of the
country favor the fall enjoyment, by all
cluses of perions, of thoso rights to which
they are »milled, under the Constitution
and laws, and I invok* the aid and in
fluenae of all good eitixens to privent or
ganisations whose objects are by unlaw
ful means, to interfere with their rights.
I look with .confidence to the time, not
far distant, when the obvious advantages
of good order and peace will iuduce
abandonment of all combinations prohib
ited by the seta referred to, and when it
will ba annaeesury lo carry on proeeou
