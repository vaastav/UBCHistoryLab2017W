Payments of stockholders* money to polltl
cians for campaign contributions, to E. H. Har
rinian to help combat the constitutionality of
t> . eicrht-hour labor law, and to reimburse dl
rectors for contributions to Adelphi Academy
i by Timothy L. Woodruff were disclosed
yesterday in the PubJlc Service Commission's
• -ieation of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit
Company. Two payments amounting to §4,000
were shown to have been made to Jacob Bren
ner, chairman of the Kings County Repub
lican Committee at that time. Various other
j»ayments which passed through Sheehan and
Collin. and in which Anthony N. Brady had
K»ir.e part, were suspected by William M. Ivins
to have been Us»ed for political purposes — appar
ently in these oases Democratic — and Colonel
Timothy P. Williams, vice-president of the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit, acknowledged appear
ances -.inte'i to it.
Besides the payment toward fighting the eight
hour law. X H. Harriman. through Harrlman
& Co., appeared in the records as receiving
510,000. for which th« voucher was blank.*" At
the request of Timothy L. Woodruff, now Re
pabttcaa state chairman, the Brooklyn Rapid
Transit paid .<20,0» toward Adelphi Academy,
now Adelphi College, in which Mr. Woodruff
was much interested. August Belmont received
$5,000 for his National Civic Federation, but the
amount was not charged as an asset, as a simi
lar contribution by the Metropolitan was
charged.
The study of certain vouchers by Mr. Ivina
proved exceedingly fruitful. On October 1, 1002.
there was one for |SS,<tM for reimbursement of
expenses by H. H. Porter. This went through
Flower & Co. Colonel Williams said at that time
experts were Investigating: the condition of the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit. Edwin W. Winter,
mow president, said that at that time he was
one of the investigators employed. He Investi
gated, and advised the executive committee. Ha
received, he thought. $5,000. perhaps $20,000.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO ADELPHI.
On October 20, 1902, there was a voucher for
£20,000 paid to Flower to reimburse certain
directors for expenditures. This was for the
contribution to Adeiphi.
"Mr. Valentine, one of our directors, web
largely interested in that institution," declared
Colonel Williams, "and Timothy L«. "Woodruff
was also. They both appeared before our board
of directors an*2 requested, as I recall it. that
the company make a contribution, to that acad
emy. They were trying to raise a considerable
amount at that time for an endowment. Certain
of the directors gave assurances that the college
would receive $20,000.** This wm ' paid to
Flower & Co.
'There is a strong moral differentiation be
tween this case and the Perkins case?" asked
Mr Ivins.
"I don't recall the Perkins case. Do you mean
a political contribution?" asked Colonel Will
lams. "This was for educational purposes, and
I presume the other was also.**
The next item -was $30,^)0. on October 23.
1902. This. Mr. Williams thought, consisted of
more payments to Mr. Porter. Mr. Ivlns could
not Bee why Mr. Porter should not pay for his
own examination. Co'.onel Williams 6aid be
didn't know either, save that the executive com
mittee passed the resolutions. Mr. Porter was a
director at that time. His investigation resulted
In much benefit and many good suggestions.
1-, January. 1302. there appeared a voucher for
510,000. paid to E. H. Harriman, "0.-X.'d" by
Anthor.y X- Brady. Mr. Brady at that time was
the chairman of the board of directors. Th*
witness did not know what this represented.
Then Mr Ivins brought forward a series of
vouchers paid by Mr. Brady — r.ne of $200, in
October. l»O0, charged to g-eneral expenses;
515.000. in October, 1901. with no explanation:
: 000, in September. 1902. on account of the
American Railway Trafnc stock, which Mr. Ivins
said ■nr.o thoroughly explained In the street
cleaning Investigation: 54.500. in October. 1903.
paid to Brady and charged to general disburse
ments, and in October, 1905. 87,500. charged to
eundry expenditures.
Colonel Williams admitted that some of these '.
looked like campaign contributions.
"If you find a voucher to Jacob Brenner in
October. 1901. for 53. «00. you would not have
*ny doubt about what that was paid for?" asked
Mr. Ivins. Mr. Williams said he could guess
within a reasonable limit, especially when Mr.
Ivins said the check was Indorsed by Mr. Bren
ner as chairman. A cond voucher, for 1,000,
in November of 1902, was made to Mr. Brenner.
The check for this was indor?- dto tho or<3» of
Timothy L. Woodruff. He never rendered any
service to the company. Colonel Williams said.
Neither did Brenner.
BRENNER DENIES RECEIVING FUNDS.
When Jacob Brenner was asked last night
about the campaign contributions brought out
at the hearing, he Raid he knew nothing of
them.
Last Eummer a payment of $5,000 was made
to the Civic Federation, tho check made out to
August Belmont and remitted to Anthony N.
Brady. It was charged to general expenses.
The payment was authorized by the executive
committee. A payment of $1,350 to E. H. Harri
man for the fipht against the eight-hour law
was part of a general railroad campaign. Colonel
Williams believed. W. G. Guthrle made the
argument, he thought. The examination con
tinued:
Q.— find an Item, October, 1899. $15,000 to Bfcee

QUASDAM OF COLLEGE
By Abolishing Sports Srcari.hm.ore
Can Gain a Million.
Bwarthmore, Perm., Dec. 2. — At a meeting of
the board of managers of Swarthmore College
th!s afternoon the committee appointed t.> ex
amine the coal lands bequeathed to tho college
in the will of the late Anna T. Jeanes. of Phila
delphia, on condition that the college abolish in
tercollegiate sports, made a. report In which it
said that to determine the value of the lands Jt
would be necessary to ongage a coal enßineer,
and that the committee would make a conclusive
report on the second Tuesday in March. The
committee stated that the hiring- of an engineer
would involve a large expenditure of money,
and that they had requested the Philadelphia
yearly meeting of Friends, who will reoetve the
property in case Swarthmore does not accept th«»
bequest, to advance the necessary money with
the proviso that it would be returned in case
Swarthmore refused to aboUsb sports. Dr.
Joseph Swain, president of the college. In a
statement in which he reviewed the entire sub
ject and in which he held that the question was
not one of abandoning Intercollegiate sports,
but was one of college policy, said:
"I doubt the wisdom of accepting without
qualification the conditional gift of Anna T.
Jeajßßß, even if the projterty is worth $1,000,000
or more. But I am willing and even anxious to
try the experin • nt."
Dr. Swain said that "in the thought that the
question discussed >s one touching the policy of
all the colleges and universities of this and other
countries," be bad sent out twenty-five letters to
representative presidents of colleges and uni
versities, i.skin^ for their opinions. The ques
tions were as follows:
1. In your opinion, have the trustees of v
college the right to bind for all time an institu
tion of learning by such a restriction as the one
mentioned In the foregoing?
2. If so, if the principle of accepting condi
tional gifts be approved, should the gift be ac
cepted in case it amounts to §1,000,000 or more?
3. If the gift should be $50,000. what then?
A summary of the answers shows tho follow
ing results:
1. Eleven negative, seven affirmative, flvo
non-committal, two yes legally, n<> morally.
2. Thirteen negative, Feven affirmative,'; four
non-committal. "i;e unanswered.
Question No. .'; -Seventeen negative, four non
committal. four unanswered.
President Woodrow Wilson of Princeton
wrote:
I have many times argued with myself about
tho peculiar question which Swarthmore has
bow to decide, and have never come to any
satisfactory conclusion. 1 fear that my counsel
would be of no value to you. It is a most
puzzling and singular question.
President Butler of Columbia was also non
committal. He wrote:
Nobody has offered to cive us any money on
tl.e condition named in yours of the 23d, and I
cannot crosi that particular bridge, even by
proxy, until I come to it. If you will turn over
the beo/i]<-st and its conditions to us we will take
the matter un seriously. ;
In opposition to the principles involved in the
acceptance of the Jeanes gift. President Eliot
of Harvard wrote:
I do not know whether under the statutes of
Pennsylvania and the decisions of its courts
the present trustees of Bwarthmore College have
a right to bind the college for all time to go
without all forms of intercolleuiate athletic
sports lam dear, however, that it is inex
pedient for the present trustees to undertake
to so bind the trustees of fifty or a hundred or
two hundred years hence.
President Schurman of Cornell said:
On geatsral principles I am convinced that
our colleges and universities should be centres
of unrestricted fPtodom I sea no reason why
v board of trustees which limits that freedom
in one direction should not by parity of reason
be justly expected to limit it in another. If a
college prohibits Intercollegiate athletics for, all
time why should it not prohibit military drill,
which I think a most beneficial and important
feature In our Cornell scheme of education.
And it would be difficult, I think, to limit such
restrictions to the field of physical training.
Might not a college which puts restrictions on
physical training be reasonably expected to
accept a gift of millions of doll irs on condition
that it oppose socialism or free ootnage of sil
ver or free trade or materialistic philosophy, or
what not?
President Judson of . Chicago University
•■-'■' '■ ■"
writes:
It seems to me that a board of trustees could
hardly bind their successors on a matter of this
kind" Of course if tho condition of the gift is
such as fully accords with the views of the
trustee- and in their opinion ought to be
adopted as a matter of permanent policy for the
college they might feel free to accept the gift
on tboye terms. Otherwise I should think the
matter would at least cause serious hesitation.
The prevailing beli.-f is that tho ««Uege will
not accept the legacy.

FACES PERJURY TRIAL
IIEGEMAN INDICTMENTS.
Seven for Forgery in Third Degree
Dismissed by Court.
The seven indictments for forgery in the third
degree which were returned against John R.
Hegeman. president of the Metropolitan Ufe In
surance Company last May, were Quashed yes
terday by Juetleo Dowllng in the Criminal
Branch of the Supreme Court. The three Indict
ments for perjury which gTew out of false state
ments Mr. Hoßemnn is alleged t^ have made to
the Stnt« Banking Department were RUFtained.
Tho motion to dismiss tho indictments was
argued before the just ire. by Morgan J. O'Brien,
John <t. Mllburn and DeLancey Xicoll, counsel
for the iif insurance president. Unless an ap
peal from Justice I ling's <!oH>*iri. which it
Is said will be made, Is successful. Mr. Heg<*nan
will have to stand trial for perjury.
Tho exact nature of the testimony that re
sulted in all ten indictments wns brought out in
tho opinion that Justice Dowitns; hunded down
yesterday. In the Hughes-Armstrong Investiga
tion Mr. Hegeman testhVd that the fcfetropott
tan was accustomed at the end ofeach year,
just before making Its report to the Btate Insur
ance Department, to seH all its coUateral loans
to its officers, friends and to Vermtlye & Co.,
thus removing them from the books. The first
business day of each year these loans were re
purchased. Mr. EXegeman explained that if the
company did not follow this plan Wall Street
bankers would bother him by callmg up on the
telephone nr»'i trying "to borrow a million or
two."
Thf- Indictments for forgery were returned h.-
cause certain Of these transactions were not In
dtcated in certain books of the company. En the
annual reports t<> the State Superintendent of
Insurance for the years l!»02. 1903 and 1904.
which are verified by Mr. Hegeman, stnfomcntn
as to the validity of these year-end transactions
are made, while any reference to syndicate par
ticipations or loans made <>n collateral is omit
ted. These statements and omissions, together
with a statement at one time that there were,
no sums, except a specified amount, not drawing
interest, when, in fact, there were two additional
deposits of $100/iOO each on which no interest
was being paid, constitute the grounds for the.
perjury indictments, according to the opinion of
Justice Dowttnd
En reviewing the. case the Justice recognizes
that false entries were made on the books, but
does not llnd in them any intention to defraud.
With regard to the indictments for forgery, tho
justice holds that the quesion to bo decided is
whether the year-end transactions constituted
actual sates, and that this cannot be determined
as a matter of law. And in regard to . tho
grounds for perjury indictments the justice
says: "Whether those statements were actually
false, whether they were, material, ■ and. if so,
whether they were knowingly and corruptly
made, are questions that cannot be disposed of
on this motion, but must await trial."
The opinion of the justice goes at length into
the various transactions of the kind mentioned
actually made. He points out that on December
30, 1902, the insurance company was carrying
on its books as actually owned 296 shares of
Federal Trust Company stock, a temporary loan
to William A. Read of -$200,000, sundry syndicate
participations amounting to $1,401,943 25 and
temporary loans to James P. Moran and others
aggregating $13R.055. These loans were all se
cured by collateral. In December, 1902, the de
fendant gave to the company hiH check, drawn
on tho National Shoe and ; Leather Rank, for
$138,055 to take up the temporary. loans referred
to. The receipt of the check was entered in the
ledger and the check was deposited and col
lected.
On January 2. 1903, these loans wero received
back by the Insurance company. Mr. Hegeman
returned the securities and received a check
from the insurance company for the same
amount as he had drawn. When this amount
was entered in the cash book It was entered in
the names of seven different people who had re
ceived the various temporary loans. Thla
formed the basis for one Indictment. •• .'.

Canadian Pacific Steamer Mount

[By Telegraph to The Tribune.]
Halifax. Dae. 2. — With 732 passengers and
crew aboard, the big Canadian. Pacific Railway
*team< r Mount Temple, from Antwerp, bound to
St. John, X. 8., ran ashore on Ironbound Inland
In a blinding snowstorm early this mnrnln*.
To-night she is piled, a hopeless wreck, or. th«
rocks at the mouth of La Ilavn River, fif
teen miles from the town of Bridgewater and
sixty miles from Halifax.
The fti." immigrants who comprised her pas
senp^rs were landed safely, after a thrilllnir ex
perience that has not been paralleled in recent
shlpwre* ks on thn coast of Nova Pcotla.
Ironbound Island is Fix miles off the mouth
of La Have River. There is no llf« saving
with one llphth'iiise. There, is no life saving
station at that point, and the tugboats which
went t'> the assistance of the doomed vessel
were unable to approach owing to the breakers
jtnd the h.-avy seas.
Th" M"'int Temple struck th>-> rocks shortly
after midnight in a heavy snowstorm and south
east gale, i was Impossible to see a ship's
length ahead. Stw> was fully thirty miles out
<pf her course to St. John. She had been in
shoal water for several hours, and when sho
struck she went broadside on th« rocks.
The raKinp seas swept over her. and when the
passengers rushed upon the decks they were
waist deep in water. Then cam« panic and a
pandemonium <~t cries and prayers In many dif
ferent languages. Captain Boothby and his
crew of ninety-nine were prompt in res tot teg
order.
First every one was supplied with a life pre
server Then when rescuers camn th*» women
and children were transferred to land in baskets.
Xext the men wero taken off in boats. A great
deal of suffering was experienced.
When all were landed safely upon the island
Ores had been lighted and everything possible
was done by the lighthouse keeper and his fam
ily to make the immigrants comfortable. The,
women and children were soaked to the skin
and paralyzed with fear and cold.
Owing to the heavy s»»as tho work of getting
the passengers to tho mainland has been slow.
This afternoon ono hundred and tifty were,
taken to Brtdgewater. where they aro quartered
in the. courthouse. It is not likely that the. pas
sengers and crew left on Ironbound Island will
be removed to the mainland before daybreak.
Officers of the Canadian Pacific «ay it is not
definitely known just how badly tho Mount
Temple is damaged, but tho chances of floating
her from her dangerous position are regarded
as unfavorable, for It Is thotight that many of
her plates have been pierced by the jagged
ledges Tho continual pounding which she will
receive as long as she. remains on the rocks will
add to the damage, and should a storm develop
she will undoubtedly be smashed" to pieces
within a short timo, as the point where she
struck is "n 0 of the most dftnK ° roufi on tne
Nova Scotia coast.
The Mount Temple is a British vessel of the
twin screw type, built of steel, <;,oml net tons.
Her length Is 485 feet aad her breadth W> feet.
The vessel was built at Newcastle. England,

TREASUBERB TROUBLE
: Chehca Savings Bank of Detroit
Will Close Doors To-day.
Detroit. Dec. 2— State Banking Commissioner
Zimmerman announced to-day that in order to
avoid a threatened run on the bank to-morrow
and to afford all depositors and creditors an
equal chance in the settlement of the affairs
of the Institution, the Chelsea Pavings Bank
would not open for business to-morrow. The
president of the bank b* Frank P. Olazier, State
Tr<- t-Mirer. wnn has deposited in the bank ap
proximately $r»54.000 of the funds of tho State
of Michigan. Attorney General Bird said to
night that the state is protected by the State,
Treasurer's bond of $100,000. and the bank's
bond of $200,000. so that th*» state would not
suffer any l"«s unless the assets of the bank
Should fail to pay 50 cents on th* dollar, which
is considered altogether iniproba-ble.
The announcement that the bank would not
open to-morrow came at the doos of a confer
ence here late to-day between governor Warner.
Banking Commissioner Zimmerman. Attorney
General Bird and representatives of tive Detroit
banking concerns— the People's State Saving's
Bank, the Old Detroit National, the First Na
tional, the Citizens' Savings Bank and tha
T'nion Trust Company.
Tt la asserted that the Banking Commissioner
h;is been closely scrutinizing the afTalrs of the
Chelsea Savings Bank for some time in con
nection with the private business of Stato
Treasurer Glazier and that of tho Glazier Stove
Company, of Chelsea. The uimwsslwn was held
that if Mr. Glazier could pull these latter in
terests through the bank would not BLLisoaißf
fall into dilflcult Us.
The five Detroit banks above mentioned, how
ever. In to-day's conference announced a de
cision to petition for a receiver for the Glazier
Stove Company to protect approximately HM.
000 of paper which they are reported to have
been carrying for Mr. Glazier and the stove
company. This action by tho banks, it was
thought, would cause a run on Mr. Glazier's
bank to-morrow, and ths» closing of tho bank
was decided upon by Banking Commissi- ner
ZimnicrniiW to protect all interests alike. Tho
bink is capitalized for $100,0^0 and has a sur
plus of about $100,000. Mr. Glazier is reported
to be sick at his homo in Chelsea, and was not
present at to-day's conferences.
Governor Warner gave out the following
statement to-night: 'From the information
furnished to Attorney Geneml Bird and myself
this afternoon rt seems probable that th.< dif
ference between the amount of Mr. Glazier's
b-nds an.l th.> amount of stato funds on deposit
with the Chelsea Savings Bank wiH be more
than made up by the amount the stato will be
entitled to receive on liquidation of the bank;
5... as tho matter now looks, the state would
suffer no loss."

Both Houses.
ITrom The Trth';r Bureau.]
m Washington. Dec. 2. — The Snth Congress opened
at noon to-day. With large Republican majori
ties In both houses there Is promise of a buai
nesslike and not protracted session, unmarked
by radical or spectacular legislation and chiefly
noted for its conservative tone and wise appro
priations for maintenance of an ever growing:
nation.
The subject certain to command the most
careful and thorough consideration Is the finan
cial measure which the leaders conrtdently ex
pect to inscribe on the statute books before final
adjournment.
Charles Warren Fairbanks and Joseph G. Can
non will preside over the respective houses,
and the old leaders, with few changes, notably
the loss of Senator Spooner, will control tha
more important committees and guide the course
of legislation.
The quiet harmony which manifestly exists
between the executive and legislative branches
of the government and between the majorities
in the two houses of the latter Is regarded as
promising well for the session which precedes
the Presidential election and for the party in.
power. The view is generally expressed that th<>
Republican members of Congress will be in,
greater sympathy with the President's forth
coming message than has been the case with,
any message aince President Roosevelt's first
official communication. The reception and read
ing of the message were deferred until to
morrow, because both houses adjourned imme
diately after organization to-day.
IN THE SENATE.
Ths bright hued costumes of the hundreds ofl
handsomely attired women who crowded tha
Senate galleries made a brilliant setting for tho
sombre gathering which slowly assembled ia.
tho chamber below. Senator«Platt. with hl3 ac
customed promptness, was the first to enter tha
hall, and he was soon followed by Senator De
pew. At first slowly, then more rapidly. tha>
members filed Into the chamber, until there was.
a comparatively full attendance some time be
fore noon. There were many hearty greetings,
numerous cordial congratulations and introduc
tions of new Senators, but It was notiee'able that
in almost every instance some reference to tha
death of Senators Morgan and Pettiis or some
expression of regret for the absence of Senator
Spooner gave a sober turn to the conversation,
and there was less laughing and joking than tsj
usual at the beginning of a Congress.
Among the interested spectators in the diplo
matic gallery was the Russian Ambassador, and.
Just back of him the Japanese Ambassador waj
represented by two attaches of his embassy.
Mrs. Fairbanks, wife of the President.
with her son and daugtiter-ln-law. llr. and Mrs.
Warren Fairbanks, occupied seats in the Vice-
President's gallery-
One minute before noon the tall forra of th*
Vice-President entered from the lobby, and on
the stroke of twelve his gavel fell and the Senat»
came to order. Chaplain Edward Everett Halo
read the Invocation, and his deep-toned "Amen"
