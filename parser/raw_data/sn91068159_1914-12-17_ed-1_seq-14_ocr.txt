SHOULD THE UNITED STATES :
INCREASE AB2IT AJTD ; JTA Y Y.
Hih Officials Glye Expert Testimony
on Subject of Preparedness of
War; Authorities Differ.
- In his message to - congress; last
-week, President Wilson said: .
"It is said in some quarters that we
are not prepared .for war.-; What is
meant by being prepared? Is it
meant that we are not ready upon
hrlef notice to put a " nation in the j
lield, a nation of men trained to arms?
Of course we are not ready to do that; '
.and we shall never be in time of peace,
so long as we retain our present polit
ical principles and institutions."
Proclaiming the people from the
United States, 1 "champions of peace
and concord," the President . emphati
cally .opposed a great standing army,
and was again cheered when he as
serted that in time of national peril,
the . country must depend "upon a
citizenary trained and accustomed to
arms."
U. S. Well Prepared.
Washington, Dec. 9. The ability of
the American navy to successfully
meet the war fleet of any. nation ex
" cept Great Britain ,was asserted today
by Rear Admiral Fletcher, commander-in-chief
of the Atlantic fleet, before
the house naval affairs - committee.
The possibility of conflict with Great
Britain was so remote, the admiral
said, that he did not believe in a naval
policy designed to control the oceans
as against that country. .
Examined all Day,
Admiral Fletcher was under exam
ination all day . by the committee at
the first public hearing on a naval
appropriation bill held in many years.
He was plied : with - maijy questions
about conditions of the navy, judged
by lessons of the European war. Al
though confidently- declaring the
American navy was overmatched only
by that of England, he added,, that if
this . country continued to build only
.two battleships a year, Germany on
basis of her present construction pro
gram, soon would be far in the lead
The admiral said he had no 'doubt
In the ability of the United States to
control the seas in a naval conflict
with Japan, but when questioned
specifically he would not say that the
American fleet alone could success
fully defend the Philippines and Ha
waii against a Japanese expedition.
Ultimate naval success, Admiral
Fletcher contended, must rest with
dreadnoughts. Submarines, he de
clared, would not seriously affect the
vital principles of naval warfare. H
admitted, however, that from a foreign-
navy viewpoint it was possib'e
to send submarine across the Atlantic
to attack warships on the American
coast.
In the event of war. he said all
American battleships available could
he made ready for action within a
week. i'iI
Sec Garrison Wants Increase.
; Washington, Dec. 9. That the Unit
ed States army be immediately re
cruited to its full war strength, which
means the addition of 25,000 men and
1,000 officers, is urged by Secretary
Garrison, of the war department, in
Lis annual report presented today to
President Wilson.
Such an increase would give ths
regular army a total of about -125,000
r.en, of whom 50,000 would be availa
ble as a mobile fighting force in the
continental United States. The pres
ent mobile strength of 31,000, the sec
retary put, soon will be cut in half
by additions to the garrisons in the
canal zone, and the Philippines.
The present full war strength of the
United States is summarized by the
report as follows:
"The organized militia of the vari
ous states totals 8,323 officers and 119,
087 men. The enlisted men therefore
required, in order, in order to obtain
the financial aid which congress au
thorizes the secretary of war to ex
"tend under certain conditions to at
tend twenty-four drills ' a year and
i?ve days annually in the field. If all
cf the national guard could be sum
moned in the event of war and should
all respond (an unconceivable result),
and if they all found fairly efficient
in the first line that Is, the troops
who would be expected to immediate
ly take the field we could summon
a force in this country ot regulars
and national guard amounting the
9818 officers and 148,492 men. (This
Tsould include only regulars of fight
ing force stationed in the United
States proper.)
And this is absolutely all. The
other resources would then be volun-
A. !- J A . . A 9
veers, ana u equip, organize iram,
and make them ready would take, at
the smallest possible estimate, -six
months.
"Anyone who takes -the slightest
trouble to investigate will find that
In modern warfare a prepared enemy
would progress so far on the way to
success in six months, if his antag
onist had to wait six months to meet
him that such unprepared antagonist
might" as well concede defeat withput
contest,"
i . Of the efficiency of the present
army Mr. Garrison says:
"While our existing organization is
of the exceedingly small numbers al
ready mentioned, it is unquestionably
?n as excellent condition as any sim
ilar number of men in any other mil
itary establishment in the world.
Were it not for a desire to avoid in
vidious comparisons I should say that
nan for man,-it is better than any
similar existing military establish
ment in the "world. I do not. believe
that anyone will - dispute the state
ment that the army has never been in
better condition than it is today, from
the most recently enlisted man up to
the - highest officers. There is an
esprit de corps, an eagerness to con
. rtantly strive toward perfection, a
willingness to undertake and satisfac
torily perform any. and every duf
that is most commendable and en
couraging." Passing to the need for a larger
army, regular and reserves, the sec
retary discusses at some length peace
ana tne use of the word "militarism,"!
touching npon tne "mooted question of
V7hethermilitary .preparation tends : to
prevent war, ;.;v: .-v:;-'-.
" ' Bryan Opposes Preparedness.
Richmond, Va., . Dec. .9 Secretary
of State William: J;' Bryan was the
chief - speaker this!, evening before the
executive , committee of the Federal
council of the : Churches of Christ in
America which convened here today.
Secretary Bryan's subject was "un-,
versal peace' '..
Secretary Bryan addressing the
federal council ' tontgnt spoke . l
strong praise of the president on the
question of preparedness in his annual
message. ' " - . . :. "
"W are not at liberty to discuss the
causes of war' Mr. Bryan said. ."That
would not be neutral. The president
has asked us to be neufral and Jt : is
important that we should be. ' Why
should we sit, In judgment, when it Is
so Important . that - we maintain an
attitude that will make it possible for
us ' to help them when the time ar
rives. ' "" ; ----- ...
"It has been a ;long while in this
country since anybody praised war as
a blessing but we have had some who
thought the wayto prevent it was to
get ready for it and preparedness has
een the basis of the argument upon
which men have relied for increase in
army and navy. If preparedness, pre
vents war I want to be present at the
next international meeting when some
body suggests that preparedness pre
vents war there would be no war Jn
Europe, f or they were prepared. . - r
They had been preparing for a long
time with different degrees of prepar
ation, but they were all preparing.
The fallacy is exposed. Preparedness
may help you if you get into war, but
It will not keep you out of war. More
than that, preparedness will almost,
with absolute certainty lead you into
war. Why? Because you cannot pre
prae for war unless you either are
afraid of somebody, or hate somebody.
The people will not bear the burden
of taxation. You can not make them
bend their backs to the load unless
you can make them believe it is nec
sary, and how can you make them be
lieve it is necessary? You have got
to have somebody to whom you cau
point and say:
""If you don't get, ready they wil
catch you unprepared.' You have got
to teach them to. hate somebody and
hate and hate until they get a chance
to lick them. That is what prepared
ness means and I am glad that our
president has took his stand on the
other side.
Daniels Says Don't Wny.
Washington, Dec. 10. Military pre
parednes of the nation was again the
dominant subject of congressional at
tention today. Secretary Daniels, be
fore the house naval committee, de-.
fended his two battleships a year con
struction program and declared the
sentiment of the people of the United
States opposed turning the country
Into a great military power. - Mean
time a free-for-all national defence
aebate occupied the house itself.
Mr. Daniels during an all day ex
amination' said that country already
had a powerful navy and that while
"with abundant revenue" he might
favor the general board's four battle
ship plan. -
"When the war is over," he said,
"those countries will be so exhausted
in their resources and burdened, with
debt that there will be a great revul
sion against war. I expect the revul
sion will be so great that we will have
r.n international conference on arma
ment more possible now than eve"
before and that we will get some ac
tion by which the navies of the world
powers will be used only to carry into
execution the agreements the coun
tries reach."
Gardner Heard.
Representative Garnejri precipitat
ed the military discussion on the house
floor with a speech criticising the ad
r.dministration for "laying the. cold
hand of death" on his proposal for
special investigation of military and
naval conditions. He assailed the
rules committee for refusal to grant
him a hearing, and the naval and mil
itary committees for failure to sum
mon before them former cabinet offi
cials and other witnesses he wanted
examined.
"If war were to break out today,"
said Mr. Gardner, "it would be found
our coast defenses have not sufficient
ammunition for an hour's fighting."
Representative Fitzgerald of .New
ork, replied briefly, and promised to
make a complete statement later
which would make "notoriety seeking
ex-secretaries" less anxious to discuss
the national defense. Representative
Dies, of Texas,, ridiculed the thought
of impending danger of attack. Rep
resentative : Sisson "of " Mississippi.
c barged the" war propaganda" to the
manufacturers of war material. Rep
i esentative Prouty, of Iowa, pleaded
for international, disarmament, arbi
tration, and an International . police,
declared a force of trained squirrel
shooters, could prevent the . landing of
a hostile force on American soil:
To Minimize Agitation.
New York, Dec. 9 To voice a pro
test against "agitation for Increased
armament to this country," a commit
tee comprising Bishop David H. Greer,
Oswald Garrison Villard,' Nicholas
Murray Butler and a score of others,
tonight . issued a , call for a meeting
here December 18 to organize a na
tional anti-armament association. -
"There has been presented to the
United States an unexampled oppor
tunity for constructive moral and po
litical leadership in the work of the
world," this committee declares in a
statement, "to take advantage of this
opportunity it Is necessary not only
to maintain our strict neutrality and
to preserve relations of- friendship
with the belligerent powers, but it alsm
ic necessary to refrain from policies
which will arouse in their minds or" in
the minds of our own people the fear
that we have reason to protect ourselves-
against . attacks. .,. We -prefer
that our nation should be the first
moral power In the world rather than
it should rank high on the -role of
military and naval powers." : "

MODERNIZING COUNTY HOME.
County is to Install" Running Water in
Home; Enjoying Hot Air Heat.
The county commissioners and Road
Supervisor P. F. Patton went to the
county home last Wednesday morning
and made a survey for a water system.
It was found that two springs about
1,100 feet from the home could be
used, giving a fail, of 43 feet. Two
reservoirs will be built at the springs
end the water will be .piped into the
home, where the inmates are now en
joying the comforts of a hot air heat
ing system.
' John Johnston, who had charge of
the home during the past year, has
done a great deal toward making this
a self-sustaining institution. . Ap
proximately 600 bushels of corn were
raised, two hogs weighing 450 pounds
each were killed, leaving brood sows
and pigs. A quantity of molasses
was 'made and the pantry or storage
room Is well supplied with canned
goods and eatables of various kinds.
Considerable improvement has been
r.-ade on the place in the way of roads
and ditches. The commissioners are
veil pleased with the work done on
the county farm this" year, which Is
understood to be a big improvement
ever previous years.
