Xhat it declare to be tlie policy ol tlie
IVHdetil m 4eafceg with tin Rebellion :
' Mr. Lincoln nys lhat in the policy
adopted toward the Insurgents he has coo-I
tined riiHKir.ro Inr nossih lei. to, lha

great question connected with the war,
Mr. Lincoln declares in favor of colonizing
them in soma congenial climate. He ad
vocates no general emancipation, but his
lanruaize clearly implies thai he consid
ers all slaves belonging to rebel roasters,
Who are in anv wav emoloved to aid the
rebellion, as 'liable lo confiscation. Of!
thexe, and of those who have escaped to
our lines, we have now a gieal number
o many that something must be done'
with ihem. It is recomTnended that suf-;
ficienl territory be acquired on which (o
colonize these,, also tret colored perron.
"Having practiced, the acquisition of ter
ritory for fi'ly years, it is too laic to dis
cuss its consiituiionality." Ha coniders
that this is case of absolute necessity, if
we would perpetuate our Uoveronieut.
Abolition in Western Virginia.
The following resolutions aro under con
sideration In the State Contention of West
ern Virginia, or Kanawba, now in sossion at
Wheeling:
Whereas, Negro Slavery is the origin
And foundation of our national (roubles
and the cause of the terrible rebellion in
our midst, that is seeking Io overthrow
our Government ; and whereas, slavery
is incompatible wnn me Word ol Uod and
detrimental to (he interests of a free peo
ple, as well as a wrong to (he slaves them
selves ; therefore
Iteso'ved, That (he Convention inquire
into (he expediency of making llie pro
posed new Stale a free State, and lhat a
provision be inserted for the gradual eman
cipation of all (he slave. wMhin the pro
posed boundaries of the New M(Me, to be
submitted to the people of the same, lor
their approval or rejection. Referred lo
the Committee on fundamental and gen
eral provisions.

Secretary Chase.
"The Xationul Inteliitenctr pays the
following high praise to Secretary Chase :
"The columns of lliis journal have re
corded the financial transactions of the
lovernmen(softlie Old World as well as
the New for a period of half a century.
Ve feel a pride in declaring that we ran
una no parallel in the history of any Eu
ropean Government, and cerlninlv not in
our own, of transactions of such magni
tude carried to a successful termination by
any financial Milliner, surrounded as Mr.
Chase has been, by a giantio rebellion
and civil war at home and an almost en
tire absence of sympathy from abroad.
"It is true, as we learn, (hat several
propositions from abroad, having refer
ence lo Q alleged desire of the people of
Europe to participate in (his loan, and va
rious proposals fortho disposition o! largo
rum abioad bavo been received, all of
wbioli have been respecifully declined.
"To llie financial bkill of Seoretary
Chase and the largo and comprehensive
patriotism of the Bank Manauers of the
North are we indebted for our continued
ability to meet promptly, in coin or Us
equivalrnt.lrie extraordinary demands up
on the Treasury. And all will admit thai
the integrity as also (he energy with
which the aU'nirs of (he Treasury Depart
ment have been administered, notwith
standing ibe overwhelming duiiei de
volved upon it, have justly inspired that
confidence io its management which has
elicited the generous and patriotic response
of the whole people, when appealed lo by
ibe Secretary lor financial support."
This is remarkably high praise, but we
oelieve it is strictly deserved. Certainly
it but expresses iho universal opinion.
Congressional.
Both branches opened on the 2d, with
a quorum prttent. In the House. Mr.
Ma)iiaid.of TenutBsec, appeared and was
worn in. He is a Union man, ar.d was
wlenteu by a large majority in Katt Ten

Foster, of North Carolina, was referred
to ibe Committee on Elections. So was
the case of Mr. Segur, ltepreseutalive
from Accomac and Nun hum pi on counties,
Va. Wr. Blair, of Western Virginia, suo
eestoi to Mr. Carlile, was quahfjed. The
memorial of Mr. Beach, ol Va., asking to
be admitted lo a seat in the House, was
relerred. Jno. W. Ried, of Misnouii, in
the Rebel army, was expelled by resolu
tion. A joint resolution was adopted in
the Konse tendering the thanksol Con
gress to Capi. Wilkes for his arrest of
JJsiorj and Sliilell ; and a resolution was
taop'ed requesting the l'reident to have
Mr, Mason confined ami treated in the
same manner as Coi. Corcoran U by the
Rebel. Slide) j also lo receive the
same tresimeol as Col. Wood. This is
doing the matter up promptly and well.
In the Senate, Mr: Trumbull, of llli
siois, at once gave notice ol a bill to con
slseat the property of Rebels, and give
ireeaom io persons in the HUve biates ;
ahd MrVilkinson, of Minnesota, of a bill
so abolish the diuiinetion between regular
pd o)uo;er forces.
-, Tb movement of Mr. Trumbull is one
"of mucb importance, and will probably
toad lo considerably discussion. The sub
ject has also been introduced in the House,

The "ambassadors" are allowed to con
verge freely with oilier political prisoners,
but we doubt whether their conversation
very Jilin. or the story ol' llieir ex
peril nces very cheeting. Mr. Moreliead,

now appears in his oiiginal character as a

severe on General Lee because he ean'l

and Wise both made llie same effort, yel
were equally unMiccemiu1, but Lee is
more fiercely attacked by the Sxumintr
because more was expected from him, and
lie is accused ol milking elaborate procla
mations, felling umber, and marching
columns with great pomp for no other
pin pone than lo lake a good look al the
enemy position, wiuie uoseacrans was

A Thrilling Prophecy
. In last February Alabama aeceded I
Thai brave old man, Senator Clemens,
who had, until then, breasted all the
storms ol wild fannticism, and clung to
Ihe U ig ot our Union, yielded (o (he pop
ular climor, and utishea'.lied ilia sword in
a cause he haled, and ooe he knew could
not succeed. He wrote the lolloivinj; to
a Irit-nd :
He are out ; we have bid a lien to the
Slurs and Stripes, and abandoned llie
Liyli privilege of calling ourselvet Amer
ican citizens. 1 am not ashamed lo con
less thai I could not restrain my tear
when the old banner which I have fol
lowed through so manv d insera, was torn
down, and the flag ol Alabama was raised
in its place ; 1 cannot restrain ihem now
when I am writing ; but the deed is done
a new era has dawned, and all thai 1
can promise is, thai no Hurl of mine bi1
spared on my part lo prevent it becoming
an era of disgrace. If ire are not in
volved in a war we soon shall be. There
is no hope of peaoe ; and he is little bet
ter lhan a m id 111 an who dreams of long
exemption from invasion. 1 shall meet ii
when it comes, as a soldier should, and
light through 11 as lung as a hope re
mains. Wnen eveiyihing is lost, as I
(ear it m ty he, unless wiser counsel
should prevail than those which have
heretofore directed us, shall drag my
body to the nearest bailie field, and Iy
down a life which has lost its value."
How swiftly has his pred.ctioo been
verified,
X3T Mrs. Qreenhow, the female spy,
arrested al Washington, for giving iu
formation to the rebels, is still confined in
the female prison, corner of Thirteenth
street and the Avenue, and is as bold and
defiant as ever. She does not receive
her meals Irom a fashionable leuauruni,
as formerly ; and when eatables Irom
sympathizing seccsh do not come, she i
compelled to mastioute the good anil
wholesome condiments of soldiers' fare,
which is much belter lood thun ibe traitor
ess deserves. . .
lT A distressing casualty occurred
during a prairie fire at Ileal Point, Ne
braska, on the 7ih ult. The dwelling
house of Mr. Kaup, a wealthy German
farmer, was burned while hirnsoll and
wile were absent trying to arrest the fire
sweeping over the prairie, and (heir
daughter, aged one, and son of three
years, perished in the burning building.
Mr K. also lost bis barns, feucos, ciop
aud stock,

iiuvian Remedies. whoru he ean obtain
thorn, and why thoy aro called ''Scandi
navian," and we are frequently asked tbe
sumo questions. Scandinavian is the an
cient nuino of Sodoti and Norway, and a
Scandinavian, lhat is, a Swode or Nor
wegian. uO'octiniiutoly calls bis country
"Scandinavia," in iho same sense as wo
spoak of ' Columbia'' or tbo ''Uuion." By
iho way, there aro over nine thousand
Scandinavian families in Dano County,
Wisconsin. Although a eitixon of this
country fur many years. Dr. Rnback Is a
Swunu by birth, aud compounds his Modi
01 ties of Swedish herbs.- We think the nam
s vory. apprnpriato. We have ihe very
highest opinion nf (he Modicinos, and of
Dr. Rnback himself, who is not only a sin
gularly skilllul physician, but a goutlomaa
of the O il School, as we knew personally.
