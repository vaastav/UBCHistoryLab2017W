THE EQUATORIAL MUDDLE.
It is interesting, in view of the news of hostilities between Peru and
Bolivia on the boundary question, to note the reccipt-by last mail of a
pamphlet giving a resume of the boundary controversy between Ecuador
and Peru. It was written by Alfredo Florcs y Caaniano, first secre
tary to the legation of Ecuador in Washington, for the information ot
the press of the United States. - Fourteen pages of argument, citing his
tory and treaties, concludes with these omnious words: "Ecuador, for
the sake of humanity, earnestly desires peace and exerts all legitimate
efforts in order to preserve it unaltered; but, in the case of a just war
of recovery, the blame for bloodshed shall not fall upon it."
Why. in the name of civilization the question naturally occurs do.
not these little countries at t'nc equator come-together in a peaceable fe
deration? Why should they have boundaries, at least other than as
local self-goveriimg states of one commonwealth, capable of becoming
a "reat nation? With the resplendent examples of the United States,
Gennany, Canada, Australia and South Africa all within a period long
succeeding the European colonization of South and Central America
before their eyes, it might be imagined that these Latin peoples should
bv now have acquired some degree of world-sense. The time is com-
ing when the United states wm icci cancu uijuu, i am- aiauu;
es the power, to put an end to fiatricidal nonsense among air of her
southern neighbors.
'Local capitalists who have started cqcoanut plantations here are like
ly to have a good thing, if they persevere in the enterprise. , .There
would seem to be a boom in copra just now, m the European market,
which almost rivals the recent furore in rubber. Probably the demand
for copra will be more steadfast irt relation to the supply than that for
rubber, as the regions where the cocoanut will flourish are likely not
comparable in Vastness with congenial habitats of the rubber tree. At,
all events, cocoanut lands in the South Seas have taken a tremendous
jump in value, and Fiji anticipates that its sugar w.ill be supplanted by
its copra industry.
Mr. Parsons, a New York democrat of prominence, is quoted in a
London interview; for sensible remarks on the elections at home; His
deprecation of further piling up of legislation, while existing statutes
are' on trial arid public" opinion is much confused on important pending
questions, will be echoed by the common-sense of the nation. It is 'in
teresting to haye such views from a democratic politician antedating
President Taft's message with which they prove to be harmonious.
.- Secretary Wilson believes that the yield of sugar beets to the acre
fcan be doubled, and that when that condition is reached the United
States will not require to import any sugar. Even if such a tune should
arrive, it will not necessarily meah the extinction of the American cane.
Si-ear industry. Prices will still govern the amount of sugar, beet
plantingand sugar-is a commodity that must always hold an equable
j-atio of prices with other foodstuffs. v
f Judge Cooper lias taken the right stand -with regard to offenses
acainst women, in declining to ratify compacts of leniency between pro
secuting ,and defending lawyers. In the absence of law to provide re
lief for the innocent dependents, .of culprits, such as is being advocated
now by some prison reformers, sympathy for sueh unfortunate persons
must not be allowed to defeat the ends of justice. j
Mr. Macfarlane's suggestion that artists should be among the Floral,
Parade judges is worthy of attention. There is considerable chance of
wrone selections being made when outsiders are appointed. All strang
ers are not necessarily angels and possibly not every angel is a con
noisseur in matters of taste.
It appears to be as hard to obtain good men for the federal supreme
bench as it is, when vacancies occur, for the supreine bench of Hawaii.
There is no word as yet of calling on the, national bar association by
President Taft to make the selections for him.
- Mr. Thurston and others, at the Hilo public meeting' reported bv
telecranh, take the same view as The Star has done about important
athendments of the Organic Act. They snould be submitted to the legis
lature befoce being promoted in Washington.
Ta'coma has taken a radical step against saloon evils by adopting an
ordinance to prohibit treating. There is no doubt that treating is res
ponsible -for the major amount'of excess, m the conventional sense of
the ferm, which prevails, among users of stimulants.
'Mr. Keefc may have difficulty in locating any federation of labor in
'Hawaii. If there is such an organization it has not made a noise like
aay thing alive since anybody can remember.
, j-Iilo is showing a public spirit of metropolitan size in guaranteeing a
subsidy of $5000 a year for a federal experiment farm in its neighbor
hood. , Queensland this year has a crop of cane sugar which has gone far
above the estimate. The fact is evidence of the success of cane sugar
raising by white farmers upon small holdings in that country.
The Mexican revolt does not stay suppressed any longer than the"
news about it.

ARTISTS FOR PARK.
Mnnager Congdon m pursuance of
his laudablo efforts always to get
something good for the numerous pat
rons of the Park Theater, has Btruck
an entirely new chord by securing
for a short season tho three Modores.
Every member of the team is a stur,
and something decidedly novel Is pro
mised. They nre sketch artists df a
high-class; their turn is a thoroughly
refined one, and Manager Coijgdon Is
certain that it will hit the popular
taste. Tho Medorns appear first In a
bicycle comedy sketch that is original
and clever, and at the conclusion of
the turn Mr. Medora will turn out an
oil painting five five feet by four in
tho remarkably rapid time of eighty
seconds. Sandarie, the third member
of the team, as her name implies, Is
a sand artist. She has a large col
lection of colored sands, and in an
incredibly short space of time, she
has some beautiful pictures worked
cut. As she finishes each picture,
a jolt of the frame leaves by a mass
ot colored sands and a feeling of
disappointment that the . picture
should have been so ruthlessly de
stroyed. Tho Melnotte Sisters are
still In the bill, and tonight they will
present a change of program.
SAVOY GETS JOHNSON.
The Savoy theater Is Tortunate for
tonight and for Jhe balance of the
week to be able to present Jack John
son to its natrons. That is "Tho Ar
rival of Jack Johnson' is the title of
a jtarco (sketch which the Malan
Magarth Company will put on to
night, in whlc,h Jim McGarth will
play the role of Jack Johnson. Ma
grath Is a premier in darkey imper
sonations. In fact he seldom appears
In any but darkey roles and his sal
lies of wit are laugh-makers. His
make-up causes a ripple of laughter
all over the house and he keeps the
audience In smiles continually. Malan,
who has been impersonating a broken
down tragedian of the comic-paper
make-up, wil have, an evcel
lent role as a support to Jack
Johnson, while Nellie Howard
and Dot Raymond, supply the femi
nine features. Dot .Raymond, will
also sing new songs, and In her" selec-."
tions for the week-end she has some
which bring her baby-drawl to the
front to the best advantage.
(The Savoy management, which has
secured management also of the Em
pire theater'' has ''closed the latter
house for ten .days to make altera
tions and change tho appearance of
the entrance, has cabled to San Fran
cisco ior new uuent, , wnicn may ar
rive on the Lurllne, to reopen the re
modelled Empire.
SO
iiflH
T
BECAUSE SHE
STRUCK
HM
in order to have revenge upon a
woman who had left him for another
Nagano a Japanese, shot at Tazu, a
Japanese woman aged 46 years. Tho
shooting took place near the corner
of Beretanla and River street at 11.30
last nigh t,Nagano firing two shot
at the woman, one of which entered
her face on the left side nnd passed
out nt Jhe right. Tho sound of the
reports brought a large crowd and
when Officer Peter Kaal arrived on
the scene, which was only a few sec
onds after the actual shooting, he
found the woman bleeding profusely
from the face and mouth' and vainly
endeavoring to staunch the flow of
blood with paper napInB. Nagano had
disappeared and the bystanders all
declared that they knew nothing of
the details of the shooting.
Tazu was taken to Queen's Hospital
in the pollco patrol and In a state
ment sho accused Nagano.
Nagano did not rcmnln at liberty
long,' for within an hour aftor the
shooting he presented himself nt the
pollco station nnd surrendered. For
soniol time all efforts to get his story
failed but this afternoon, after being
nuesUoned at length, he gradually
Unfolded hl&. story. Ho and Tnzu, ho
said, had lived together In IIllo for
four years and afterwords were to
gether In Honolulu. Ho had on vari
ous occasions given her money, even
After sho had left him, but sho had
spoken badly of him to his friends.
For the past two nnd a half years ho
had been unnblo to work, owing to his
legs being very weak and he had been
unable io give her any money. In or
der to llvo ho had taken to gambling
and whenever he had money and Tazu
know, she Would enter his room,
search his clothes and take away one
or two dollars.
Among his friends Tazu spread the
report' that he was a police spy and
apparently this was the last straw to
Nagano, for he then bought a revol
ver, a 32-callber Iver-Johnson wea
pon, for seventy-five cents and car
ried' It with him, in order to shoot
her If she did not stop talking. Nagano
made this admission this afternoon
after being asked his reason for car
rying the revolver.
. hast night, said Nagano, when he
was on his way home he saw tho
woman together with another Japan
ese mat, and she approached him and
wanted to talk with hlnv. Ho told
her sho could go home with him,
whereupon she struck him In the face.
He then struck her and she hit him
i. second time. Then Nagano drew
his revolver and fired at her. He de
clared that he did not Intend to shoot.
her. but lost command of his senses
when she struck him the second time."
Nagano Is being detained In the
police court pending further Injulr
ies. The woman Is In hospital but In
no danger of losing her life.
