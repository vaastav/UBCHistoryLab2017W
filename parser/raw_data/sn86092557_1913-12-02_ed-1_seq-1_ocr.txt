i] CINCINNATI, Deo. 2.?The Chesapeake

in the United atSets circuit
court of appeals here today when it
ordered back to the district court

of the district courts in which the
heirs of Thomas McKell of Chillicothe,

V;$.100.00.0 against the railroad for al.

Kt Ajfsed all Its local facilities hauling
own coal, leaving MbKell no way

CUBAN CONGRESS CALLED UPON
TO STAMP OUT THE PRACTICE
OF WITCHCRAFT.
HAVANA, Dec. 2. ? A sensation
was caused |iere by tli'e discovery of
an alleged extensive organization
among tlio negroes of Cuba for the
pructlee of witchcraft or " "voodooism."
It is said, the negro wizards
constitute a powerful "trust." i
The revelation was made as a se- i
rjnel to the recent murder of a white
girl, years ago. in connection with a i
mysterious method of healing a sick i
negro woman to whom the child's
lilood was said to have been adminis- i
tered. i
It is generally reported tlipt til?
"voodoolsts" have relations with,
politicians who control their votes 1
and protect them against punish-1
mont. I
Several crini9s.of a similar nature
to the one whiclfr led. to. the discovery
of the voodoos have been committed
recently in the islands and in most
cases flie criminals have gone unpunished.
The newspapers now call
on congress to find a remedy. j
