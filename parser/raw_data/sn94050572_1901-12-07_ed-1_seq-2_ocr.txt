THE PRESIDENT ON IRRIGATION.
Undoubtedly the first work in Irrigation
which the government should undertake is
the construction of a dam on the Uila River
at San Carlos, in Arizona, because this im
provement would not only brine under cul
tivation a large area of arid land for the
use of white settlers, but would also relieve
the urgent needs of thousands of friendly
Indians, who are now in a starving condi
tion because the water upon which they
have been dependent for centuries has been
diverted by white settler above them.
This improvement would be not only a strik
ing object lesson of the advantage of irriga
tion en a large scale, but also an' act of
mercy and justice. Los Angeles Times
Editorial, Feb. 12, 1901.
A NEW" INDIAN POLICY.
News cornea from Washington tbat
the Secretary of the Interior and the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs have re
solved to adopt a new policy regarding
the Indiana. The plan is, according to
Washington dispatch, to "give them
an opportunity for self-support by fur
nishing them water for irrigating their
crops, then throw them on their own
resources and enforce a realization of
the dignity of labor and the importance
of Vnilding and maintaining hoses for
themselves."
For seven years the Tbieunk has been
earnestly laboring to this end, and
cow that its efforts have been crowned
with snccess, it has reason to feel
jubilant. While a member of the 19th
Arizona Legislature the editor of the
TuiBtTKK introduced a memorial to
Congress, which was unanimously
.adopted, in which the following para
graph occurs. It is the exact policy
that has just been adopted regarding
the Indians, and shows that those on
the ground best understand the situa
tion. It is a source of congratulation
to all concerned that the recomminda
tious of the Arizona Legislature have
at last been listeued to. The memorial
reads aa follows:
"The Indians should be gathered on
the reservations, have lands allotted to
them in severalty, be furnished witli
farming implements and an inexhausti
ble supply of water for irrigation of
their lands, to the end that tbey may
become self-supporting. By this means
will a home life be furnished for the In
dian and he will more rapidly advance
in civilization as a consequence, lie
will abandon his nomadic life; his
children will be kept at home and
educated in neighborhood schools, in
stead of being sent to large Indian
schools at a distance where they are
kept (as it would seem) for mere pur
poses of show. After being instructed
in the arts of civilization for a time
they are returned to savagery, to be
come more unhappy and discontented
than if they bad never received the
questionable advantages. We feel that
the present policy of the Indian da
partment is all wrong in this regard."
Ikrioatios is the most momentous
problem of the west. In the east, the
chief desideratum is American ships,
says the Chicago Live Stock World. In
the west it is the water to build np the
crops which supply the sinews of
finance to the whole union. Vast
areas, and by vast we mean millioos of
acres of western ground, are at pres
ent noproduztive because of the lack
of water, yet billions of gallons of the
nourishing and productive lie id are
going to waste in other parts of the
world. Congress owes no greater duly
to itself nor to the nation than the
adopting of measures solving this great
problem. A -hundred millioos or mor
spent in its proper solution would be of
general benefit, where the Nicaragua
canal, as much as it may be needed,
would benefit only a few.
The message sent to Congress this
week recommends that the government
should construct und maintain reser
voirs for the storage of water to irri
gate the arid lands. "The distribu
tion of the water, the division of the
streams among irrigators, should be
left to the settlers themselves in con
formity with State laws and without
interference with those laws or with
Tested rights.
"At the very beginning the govern
ment should make clear, bcyoud shadow
ofdouut, its inteuliou to purtue this
policy on the lines of the broadest
public interest. No reservoir or canal
should ever be built to satisfy selfish
personal or locsl interests; but only in
accordance with the advice of trained
experts, after long investigation has
shown the locality where all the con
ditions combine to make the work most
neeeded and fraught with the greatest
usefulness to toe community asa whole.
There should be no extravagance, and
the believers in the need of irrigation,
wi.l most benefit their cause by seeing
to it that it is free from the least taint
of excessive or reckless expenditure of
the public moneys.
"Whatever the Nation does for the
extension of irrigation should harmo
nize with, and tendtto improve, the con
dition of those now living on irrigated
laud. We are not at the starting point
of this development. Over two hun
dred millions of private capital has al
ready been expended in the construc
tion of irrigation works, and many
million acres of arid land reclaimed . A
high degree of enterprise and ability
has been shown in the work itself; but
as much cannot be said in reference to
the laws relating thereto. The
security and value of the homes
created depend largely on the stability
of titles to water; but the majority of
these res ton the uncertain foundation
of courtdecisions rendered in ordinary
suitsat law. With a few creditable ex
ceptions, the arid States have failed to
provide for the oerta in and j ust division
of streams in times of scarcity. Lax
and uncertain laws have made it possi
ble to establish rights to water in ex
cess of actual uses or necessities, and
many streams have already passed into
private ownership, or a control equiva
lent to ownership.
"Whoever controls a stream practi
cally controls the land it renders pro
ductive, and the doctrine of private
ownership of water apart from land
cannot prevail without causing endur
ing wrong. The recunitiun of such
ownership, which has been permitted
to grow up in the arid regions, should
give way to a more enlightened and
larger recognition of the rights of the
public in the control and disposal of
the public water supplies. Laws
founded upon conditions obtaining in
humid regions, where water is too
abundant to justify boarding it, have
no proper application in a dry country.
In the arid Stales the only right to
water which should be recognized is
that of use. In irrigation this right
should attach to the land reclaimed and
be inseparable therefrom. Granting
perpetual water rights to other than
users, without compensation to the
public, is open to all the objections
which apply to giving away perpetuttj
franchises to the public utilities of
cities. A few of the Western stales
have already recognized this, and have
incorporated io their constitutions the
doctrine of perpetual State ownership
of water."

Secretary Uitehcoek of the Interior
in his annual report endorses the con-I rf's What yOU nCedj SOTTie-
Affairs regarding the present system
in the following terms. He says:
"The management of the InJian serv
ice in the field and schools, while sat
isfactory uader existing conditions, is
not deemed to be the best for the wel
fare of the Indians, and different meth
ods nil) hereafter be adopted. This
policy contemplates requiring the
working by Indian allottees able to do
so of a f .ir portion of lands allotted
them, and the contributing by their in
dustry to their own support of all not
entirely disqualified by actual dis
ability, physical or otherwise, the di--couliDuauct
of the issue of rations to
those able to support themselves, and
the extension to the latter of every
possible aid for their weil-being and
encourugemeut ; the ioauguaration of
industrial traia'ng in all schools which
are now established so that such In
dians of both sexes may be tauclit
trades or industries adapted to their
circumstances."
The income of the various Indian
tribes from all sources aggregated $5,
388,880, a falliog-off of $200,952, moatly
due to the expiration of treaty obliga
tions. The curriculum - of Indian
schoo.s, the Secretary says, should be
restricted to the common school course,
and the further extension of non-res
ervation schools should not be per
mitted. In the future, full leasice
privileges will be confined to thoVe
whose disability or inability disqualifies
them from working any part of their
allotments, and in a lesser degree to
those whose disability prevents their
working more than a small part of
their allotments, all other allottees to
be required to work at least forty acres
of their allotment.
FOKESTB ADO WAT KB.
The report says that the act of June.
3, 18S7, known as the timber and stone
act, if not repealed or radically
amended, will result ultimately in the
complete destruction of the timber on
the unappropriated and unreserved
puulic lands. '
The time has arrived, according to
the Secretary, when reservoirs must be
built and managed as a part of a n
tioual system of forest and water con
servation. They cannot be successful
if maintained, however, without a thor
ough system of forest protection. The
introduction of practical forestry on
the forest reserves has now begun.
The general policy, asaonououei in an
outline memorandum to the Commis
sioner of tha Lind Oiice, is that ad
ditional forest reserves, with bound
aries drawn to liberate the smallest
amount of scrip, should be created dur
ing this winter.
The good will of the residents in or
near the reserves should be gained,
forest fires guarded against and the re
sources of the reserves should be made
available for the conservative use of
the people. Systematic investigation
aeslgued to make theui accessible sod
useful should be undertaken, and each
forest reserve and par; thereof should
be dealt with ooitsown merits.

ABID REGION
Qa the question of reclamation of the
rid re;ion, the secretary says: "The
investigations which have been carried
on demonstrate that there is no one
question now before the people of the
United States of greater importance
than the conservation of the water
upply, and the reclamation of the arid
lauus of the West and their settlement
by men who will actually build homes
and create communities."
It i reCJmmeuded that construction
at once be beun as follows: "The
San Carlos storage reservoir in Ari
zona, reclaiming 100,000 acres or more
of public Und at an estimated cost of
$1,040,000; reservoirs in the Sierra Ke-
vadasin California, for reclaiming des
