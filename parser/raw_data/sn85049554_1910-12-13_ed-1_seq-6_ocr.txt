IOWA IS PAYING A DEBT.
Some explanation of :he causes of
Iowa's census figures may he found in
tl~ose of western Piates. Colorado has
trade 50 per cent increase. California 50
per cent. Oregon 62.70 per cent. Ne
vada 93.4 per cent, and Idaho has more
than doubled. Other western and
northwestern states have largely in
creased. The Dakotas ought to show
astonishing figures. Montana has
grown. The whole west has taken on a
new aspect and learned a new hope in
the decade from 1900.
Iowa has furnished her quota over
and over to the growth of these states.
There has been a continued procession
of box cars leading west and northwest
out of Iowa. The younger men are fol
lowing the trail of their fathers, going
with their accummulations to the
cheaper lands. Idaho, California, Ore
gon, Montana, the Dakotas, what
neighborhood in Iowa has r.ot sent its
representatives to swell their popula
tion and justify their hope?
a
state publicity bureau will do weil if
it will exploit Iowa's rural advance
inent and not give its whole attention
to the building up of the cities."
"Iowa is the b=-st state in the union,
I-et"s convince the world of that fact,
A united and determined effort will do
it."
President McDonald of the Des
Moines Ad Men's Club advocated an
Iowa advertising campaign as neede
to bring Iowa's wealth and population
up to the standard. He pointed out
the pertinent figures that 2.000 schools
in the state have an average of four
pupils: that Iowar.s own or control
land and mortgages on land eoual to
the acreage of two states of the sizc
of Iowa and that 1400,000,000 of Iowa
money has been invested outside the I
state.
There are several salient points in
he above argumentation. The condi
tion of rurai schools is one but the
peculiar condition exists that the rural
districts are not doing the most com
plaining about rural schools ar.d the
fact exists that the younger heads of
families who are are moving west and
r.orih with their children are worrj
ing less over the schools they shall
find than over other opportunities and
drawbacks of the new country. Would
the best of schools situated on the
crossroads of the best farming dis
tricts of Iowa tend to largely increase
population and how? Schools are in
cidental to an increase of population
rather than an antidote for race sui
cide and are those who would oe fi
nancially able to divide an Iowa farm
at *200 an acre with the owner who
much more anxious to buy more land
than to sell any of his holdings likely
to largely increase the rural school
population?
The rural districts are not worryin
over loss of population. They want
more transient help. They are not ap
parently desirous of resident help. If
they were they would build attractive
tenant houses and compete with the
city for its supply of resident labor.
The truth is that the average Iowa
farming community is disposed against
the permanent settlement in consider
able numbers in their communities of
foreign peasantry such as are being
cheaply used in the beet fields, etc.
It Iowa
is
to increase
largely in pop­
ulation—and it might be noted with
wisdom that Iowa is doing very well
as it is—she must use the millions at
home which are now going afield. Too
much Iowa money is working outside
the state, paying wages and for im
provements in other states. The Iowan
is slowly realizing that there are other
•ale and thrifty investments besides
buid. The money seta, not carried, out
of Iowa to coniroi the vast acreage
mentioned is for investment of a spec
ulative nature. H* wants bis money
working for him and "land is a safe
investment." "SVTieii the Iowan

Iowa will increase in population, city
population and the population closely
contiguous to cities and along interur
ban lines.
Young men who have done well are
responsible for the loss of population.
Thi-y have tone on seeking new op
portunity. Older men who have made
money—much money—are responsible
for the- lick of population to fill the
void. They have sought investment
outside the state Th' men who are
complaining most of the loss are the
ones who are doing least to replace it.
The merchant who wishes th- popula
tion W"Uid double hurries with his ac
cumulations to buy wi-stirn or Can
adian iands. It is entirely natural that
he should do so. Land speculation,
land development, increase of land
prices have been the principal bus
iness of Iowa since the rirst furrow
was turned in her soil. We are upon
th- vt-r-e of eh.tr.ge. And when the
change of investment tendency be
comes manifest the population figures
will indicate it. Advertise, certainly
advertise: but why not use our
money
at home? That would be the best of
ail advertising.
GETTING CIVILIZED.
China is to have a navy department
and will set about building and buying
a real r.avy, China is becoming civil
ized. reaSy to full into step with the
higher civilization, we are now inform
ed. When she arrives at the dignity of
a dreadnaught. ar.d the efficient ca
pacity to use dynamite with judg
ment as to where it will kill the most
men and thus do the most gO"d. China
may reach hands across the seas and
.-ay 'shake" to the higher civilisation
of the Anglo-Saxon and other highly
developed races.
Perhaps a sunken mine is the symbol
and a .sixteen-inch gun the union label
of civilization, but it ought not to be
so. Perhaps the nation which can
shoot straighter and furthest is the
highest civilized but there is some
thing about the ciassifcation that
sounds faulty. .Maybe if China had a
navy big enough to destroy c-verv other
on earth she would be the greatest na
tion in the world, but it's hard to be
lieve.
The fact is that a corn plow—a walk

bird than all the eagles of war. A fat
hog pound for pound is of more use

"The young man who is too good for

Looker-On In Ioiva
Traer, Dec. 13.—There's an expert
down east that proposes to tell the
railroads how to save millions, and
thus make an advance in freight rates
unnecessary. The Chicago Great
Western has a sign hung up in their
depots offering old ties for sale. But
the other roads persist in the unwise
extravagant plan of piling them up on
the right of way and burning them.
Near Beile Plaine as the train passed,
or.e could see a pile of old hard wood
ties as big as a freight car, the sec
tion hands were burning according to
orders. There was hard wood enough
in that pile to supply some poor man
with fuel all winter. If the railroads
don't care to sell them, why not turn
-them over to some united charities as
sociation. At present prices of fuel
it's a crim* for any individual or cor
oration to thus absolutely waste one
of the necessities of life—in Iowa.
The automobile besides becoming a
factfr in accident insurance circles is
still a Hve question with our Iowa
bar.a».rs. One of them wrote an east
ern correspondent %s follows
"Automobiles are cutting a figure.
Men able ar.d men not able are even
straining their credit in making this
fascinating investment. The invest
ment is pe-rma.ient and the funds sel
dom go back into the bank deposits or
to -y the bank's note. If the machine
is sold, it Is but to buy a more ex
pensive machine. The real and serious
cause, however, of the growing demand
for loans and the extensive use of
funds, to answer specifically your ques
tion, is. without doubt, the wide use
of credit to which the people have be
come accustomed and the generous
credit which the banks have accorded
them—the past few years. The custom
is running riot. It i* a common thing
now for men to go out and buy prop
erty. make deals and draw heavy
chicks, and then go to the bank .ar.d
give tht'r notes—without even previ
ously arranging for such loans. The
banks have been able to take care of
these demands and the custom has in
sidiously grown. With thus unlimited
and unrestrained credit you can readily
see what volume of credit would at
times be used. These borrowers are
good rr-'-n and their paper is choice, but
it counts just the same in the volume
of demand.
"I think I make the point clear. Many
men now do not stop to consider
whether they have the funds or can
spare the funds. The question is.
rather, shall I buy? Will it pay me to
buy? And now they use their credit
rather than their bank balance, for
they may not have a bank balance.
The custom has grown up innocently
enough, but it has grown up. It is
forcing banks to carry more loans than
they would otherwise carry. The
banks have in thin sense and to this
extent lost the power to control and
limit their loans. Further this ability
to command credit at a moment's no
tice and the growing habit of thus
using and depending upon it, has re
sulted In men giving less care to build
ing up and sustaining bank balances
against their need.?. Thev are borrow
ing more and depositing less, using
their credit In place of maintaining
bank balances from which to draw."
The small decrease in the population
of Iowa, a condition easily explained
by our enormous "settling up" of the
southwest and north, Is used by some
to point out other loss to our state.
Such persons forget the tremendous
I Improvements going on here, every

of that state during the year 1909, and
the total, as reported by the auditor of
state, is 38,680,164 rods, costing, no
doubt, as much as $10,000,000. This Is
only a part of the expenditure for
drainage. The cost of large open
ditches, constructed by drainage dis

pleased to notice that the captain gen

KKNTON WON'T DO.
[Webster City Herald].
State Senator L,arr.abee announces
that he will present Hon. W. S. Ken
yon as a candidate for United States
senator. Mr. Ktnvon has already been
expensively featured in the press in
commotion with the Dolliver vacancy.
Without in ar.y way discounting his
abilities, it may be truthfully said, that
if Senator Cummins" advice is to be
taken. Mr. Kenyon is not one who an
swers to the description of a real pro
gressive. He has never been in the
fight for any of the measures, which
make up the progressive program, the
primary, the anti-pass, two-cent fare,
etc. He opposed Cummins for a third
term, which was the crucial period for
the progressives in Iowa. Mr. Kenyon
had be«*n a personal friend of Cummins.
So had Carroll Wright, but when
Cummin? bid an open defl to the rail
roads. both of theso friends opposed
him. The same thing happened In a
senat'-ria con'est which followed. The
were against Cummins.
Mr. Kenyon is now a member of the
Taft administration, and is prosecuting
the Chicago beef trust. That Is com
mendable but it does not make him a
rregressive. President Taft never yet
appointed a nr^c-essive to oflffce. There
is not one in his cabinet nor anywhere
else. Mr. Kenyon was appointed by
Taft on the recommendation of Mr.
Dickinson, secretary of war who had
been ger ra! counsel for the Illinois
Cent-a! ra:?~oad and Mr. Kenyon had
been one of his aids.
In Iowa. President Taft until recently,
has refused to appoint even postmas
ters becai-se they were progressive, and
for no other reason. No man from
Iowa has been appointed because he

Under Suspicion.
(Washington correspondence of the
New York Herald).
Representative William W. Wilson, of
Illinois, and Representative John \V.
Dwight, of New York, the republican
"whip," met in the capltol corridor to
day.
"How large was your majority?" ask
ed Mr. Dwight of his republican col
league.
"Fifty-seven." answered the Illinois
member.
"Pretty close shave, eh?" observed
the "whip."
"Do you know?" said Mr. Wilson
confidentially, "I've got an idea that
any republican who got more than a
majority of fifty-seven in the last elec
tion did It by bribery and corruption."
The Message.
'Christian Scier.cc Monitor).
One may search in vain thru the 30,
000 words in President Taft's last regu
lar message to the Sixty-first Congress
for a startling passage or a striking
phrase. The document is hardly one
that will invite entire perusal. It
covers a wide range of subjects, han
dles some of them exhaustively, and,
it should be said, with clearness but
the impression left upon the mind is
that the executive is reviewing mat
ters with regard to which the public Is
already sufficiently informed, rather
than offering new topics for popular
discussion. The amount of space given,
for instance, to conservation, reclama
tion and the disposition of mineral
lands, in the United States proper and
In Alaska, might have been fully Jus-

the windows in a room open all day
in winter, and when you close them
apply a match to a Perfection Oil
Heater and heat the room to any tem
perature you desire in a few minutes.
The Perfection Oil Heater is finished in japan or nickel. It burn* for.
nine hours. It has a cool handle and a damper top. It has an ••tomatte*
locking flame spreader* which prevents the wick from being turned high
enough to smoke, and is easy to remove and drop back so that the wick can be
quickly cleaned. An Indicator always shows amount of oil in the font /'•}«,
The filler-cap does not need to be screwed down. It is put in like a cork
In a bottle, and is attached to the font by a chain. ..
The burner body or gallery cannot become wedged, because of a new':!,,
device in construction, and consequently, it can always be easily unscrewed in
an instant for rewicking. The Perfection Oil Heater is strong, durable, we!!J t|
made, built for service, yet light and ornamental.
