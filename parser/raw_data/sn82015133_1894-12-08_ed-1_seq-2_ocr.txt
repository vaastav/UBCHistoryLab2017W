REPUBLICAN PLATFORM FOR
CUT ELECTION.
The republican party are desirous of
securing the election of upright, pro
gressive men for the municipal offices,
who are willing to devote their time and
intelligence to the interests of the city
of Tucson.
In this laudable undertaking we are
confident we shall receive the hearty
support of our citizens irrespestive of
party.
The republican party, true to its paet
glorious record, is the first to advocate
municipal progress.
We propose to advanoe the material
welareof our city by every feasible
means withoct further taxation on
property, utilizing the present oity re
sources to that end.
We further undertake to practice
the strictest economy in our munioipal
affairs to the end that we may have
available means for the improvement of
our streets, sidewalks, parks, supply of
water for city purposes, and the build
in? of sewers when it becomes feasible
to undertake the work.
In the matter of increasing our rail
road facilities, manufacturing industries,
and the securing of public buildings,
sanitariums, and the development of
water, and redemption of lands, which
will contribute to the prosperity of the
city, we pledge our party candidates to
use their best endeavors in this direc
tion, to the end that every available
means within the power of our munici
pal government may be brought to bear
for the advancement of Tucson's ap
pear an oe and prosperity.
RESULTS OF THE POLITICAL
EDUCATION OF WOMEN-
The work of the women, says Dr.
Mary Putnam Jacobi, in the December
Pornm. who intend to continue the
systematic agitation for the suffrage in
the state of New York will be now main
ly directed to efforts for the systematic
political education of women. Suffrage
leaguee, as hitherto organized, have
been apt to addasss themselves too little
to education, to much to "campaign
speeches." It is indeed difficult to per
n&de average citizens, either male or
female, to study anything for which
they have no immediate use. When
the utility becomes obvious, the energy
and interest are promply forthcoming.
The women of Colorado organized, all
over the state, olubs for the study both
of politics and of political science. The
effective assistance, which, at the last
election, the women of Colorado lent to
the work of defeating the blatherskite
candidate for governor, shows an excell
ent practical result of euoh studies. In
New York City, curious object-lessons
upon "women in politics" have been
offered by the organization of groups of
women, many of whom had pronounced
themselvee "anti-suffragists," to aid
in the work of a reform election, under
the leadership of men who had previous
ly opposed, with considerable emphasis,
the mixture of women in politics.
Women who had been told that they
should not vote were not urged to
instruct men how to vote, or at all
vents to stand by them and see that
thev did their duty in voting. No more
theoretically incongruous but practic
ally admirable situation could have
been devised than this, which followed
so promptly upon the defeat of the
claim by women to be allowed to exer
cise the rights of oitixenship. It was a
complete give-away and the most
elaborate explanations can make noth
ing else out of it.
China cries enough to Japan and ap
. peals to Uncle Sam to pull the little
fellow off.
The democratic party nas been in
power but a little over two years and
the national debt has increased one
hundred million dollars. It costs almost
as much as a big war to keep such party
in power.
In the Pennsylvania legislature there
are but 28 democrats against 17C repub
licans. The republicans have on joint
ballot 181 majority. It is almost need-
lees to add that Pennsylvania went re
publican.
China is on her knees suing for peace
while Japan is on her muscle and is de
manding money or blood, The battle
between the pigmy and the giant has
been one sided. The latter was whipped
and howled for mercy almost before the
little fellow bad began the march
againet his big feet.
The president in his long and windy
message failed to say one word commen
datory of silver. This omission, how
ever, would cut no figure with the Ari
zona democracy. If called together to
day they would endorse him and shout
themselves hoarse over the beauties of
his administration.
The Tucson democracy endorse the
democratic platform of 189L What
rot. We venture to say that not one in
ten knew what he was voting for when
he shouted his endorsement. The Chi
cago platform may please a well fed dem
ocrat, but to the hungry millions it is
worse than poison.
A democrat a well known business
man said yeeterday whea discussing
the merits of the two tickets now before
the people, said: "Well, I confess the!
democratic ticket is not much, and like
a good many others I know of, I intend
to split off the big half on election day."
The Arizona Populist advises sedi
tion and insurrection. Its proprietors
having cot a cents worth of realty in
the country, and the paper having
neither stock, type, press nor character,
its manipulators might turn a lawless
condition of society to their personal
benefit had they the ability to create a
lawless condition. However they will
find the people of the region of country
with sympathy. There is too much
good, sound sense here to recognize
these frothing attempts to gain no
toriety and anarchy. Herald.
x he Columbia has been ordered to
the Bluefields. She will get there too
late to be of service. Great Britain al
ready has her finger on tbe plum and
as usual she knows how to keep what
be gets held of. The Columbia is sup
posed to protect our interests, and this
I promises to be no berculenian task, for
as it now looks, there will be nothing to
protect when she gets there.
Arizona Lodge No. 1, A. O. U. W.,
is in receipt of a draft for 82,000 to be
paid to Mrs. W. II. Prinoe, whose hus
band died in tbe hospital a short time
since. The promptness with which the
order of the A. O. U. W. pays its death
losses is commendable. No man who
has a wife and little ones can make a
better investment in their behalf than
by carrying a policy in the above order.
The membership of this order in this
city, although large, would be at leaBt
double its present size if but one half
the virtues of this beneficient institu
tion were properly understood.
The action of the president in placing
under the Civil Servioe rules the large
body of incompetent and worthless
phifa of division now drawing salaries
in the departments at Washington
would seem to be on a par with his
other attempts at greatness during his
present term. The changes in this force
have been sweeping, and with few ex
ceptiona the new chiefs, selected for
purely partisan reasons and largely
from the south that sunny storehouse
o back numbers have shown no capao
itv for their leeitimate duties, and
have resented the intelligence and know
ledge of their experienced subordinates
far too deeply to learn anything from
them. Consequently they have don
little except prance about the offices
cracking the whip of the slave-driver
over the heads of hard-working clerks
who regard them with the mingled
amusement and terror inspired by an
escaped lunatic. However, in 1897 the
inefficient chief will probably discover
that "Civil Service" protects him no
better than it protects the victims of
his malice and stupidity under the pres
ent recime. He will go. not by secret
6tar-chambcr methods, but on plain
oharges signed by the proper authorities
and as clear and effective as was the
voice of the people in the late election
in denouncing the sickening spectacle
of democratic incapacity for govern
ment. New York Tribune.
A lot of defeated democratic congress
men thought they had a nice little snap
to get sums running from $1500 and up
wards for each man from Uncle Sam'i
coffers, without even making a pretense
of earning it. Present indications are
that the enap will have to be abandoned
as unworkable. These men concluded
that they would not go to Washington
to take part in the short sess;on of con
grese, but would utiliza the time in
trying to "catch on" to something out
of which they could live, meanwhile
continuing to draw their salaries as con
gressmen $41G.6G a month until the
3rd of next March. But that was not
enoueh for them. They actually had
the audacity to write to the6ergeant-of
arms oi the nouee, directing mm to
forward them checks for the mileag
which would have been due them for
coming to Washington and returning to
their homes at the close of the session
That demand has probably broken up
the whole scheme, as the sergeant-of
arms Las very properly refused to pay
mileage to members who do not go to
Washington, and a movement is on foot
to stop tbe salary of members who re
main away from Washington except
when compelled by eickoess to do so,
The president takes occasion to punch
ud the old soldier in his message to
congress and almost sincerely expreeres
the hope that the limit of life has been
reached and that from now on they will
begin to die off. He, however, makes
no mention of the substitute he eett to
the war instead of going himself.
that the young republicans of Tucson
were at the front at the mass meeting of
republicans is evident by the nomination
oi Mr. l'aul lieermans as city assessor
and when the young active republicans
nominate a man, they have the reputa
tion of putting their e boulder to the
wheel and electing him. In this good
work all Republicans will join. Mr
Ueermacs is an active business man in
all that the word implies. .For years he
has beecjeonnected with the business
department of the Citizen and knows
intimately the people of Tucson. Mr.
Heerruans is capable of attending to all
the details of the office he seeks in a
business like manner, calculated to give
the utmost satisfaction to the property
holders, and those interested in peeing
city affairs well conducted.
In Henry Buehman the republican
party have endeavored to give the citi
zens of Tucson a mayor equal to the
emergencies that are liable to confront
us during the nest two years. In seek
ing a candidate it was a conceded fact
that tbe man selected must be identified
wun me ousiness enterprises or our
pueblo, and must be a man above re
proach and ripe in the experience of
our necessities. Mr. liuebmnn ruled
this bill to a nioety, being an old time
citizen who had carefully observed the
various changes in our municipal affairs
for the past twenty years, and who had
taken an active part in the important
measures at that period. He is a man
pre-eminently above reproach, and no
one will doubt that bisbervices, if elect
ed, will be direoted to advance our in
terests. Anticipating, as we do, the
coming of the North and South road.
we want a man in the high office of
mayor who will be equal to securing all
the advantages that can aocrue from
this important factor in our affairs, and
Henry Buehman is the man of the hour
BEATING A NEWSPAPER.
There are some men who think it
smart to beat a newspaper out of a few
dollars. Most any man can beat a paper
out of a year's subscription, or out of a
small amount of job work, but it never
pays them in the end. They, however,
consider they have gotten ahead of tbe
paper and are happy to think there is 60
little kick from the owners. The bills
are usually small, and it don't pay to sue
the delinquent subscriber or the man
who swindles us out of a few dollars'
worth of work, but the paper bides its
time. Sooner or later the man desires to
get public recognition of some sart or
kind, and now comes the other's innings.
If the man i3 a small fry he is simply let j
alone, and unable to get bis name before
the public, he fails in his subject. If,
however, he is some importance, he
learns too late that his little swindle in
which he beat the paper has cost him all
that he coveted in public life. Oroville
Register.
Cuabl.es T. Connell, the present re
corder, is a candidate for the office he
at present occupies at the coming city
election. During tbe past year the
office of recorder became vaoant. The
mayor with a foresight that distinguised
his entire conduct of official matters,
nominated Mr. Oonnell to fill this vacan
cy and the council elected Mr. Connell
recorder. The office could not have
fallen into worthier hands, as the new
recorder soon demonstrated himself a
recorder to the manor born; during the
time that Mr. Connell has been the
incumbent of the office the hard times
have prevailed and at times our oity
has been overrun with persons of disso
lute character, capable of almost any
crime, who has infested our city like
birds of ill omen, these men heve felt
the inbospitality of Mr. Connell as a re
presentative of Tucson and their stay
in our midst have been of short dura
tion. In the office of recorder it requires
a man of rigorous discipline, and at the
same time a man of careful discernment.
These qualities Mr. Connell possesses to
the extent that he will not suffer an
imposition not perpetrate a wrong,
popular to a fault the party could not
have put up a better man for the office
of reoorder.
Mb. Thomas Wilson, our candidate
for councilman from the second ward,
is too well known to need any introduc
tion at the hands of the Citizen. Tuc
son can congratulate herself in securing
a candidate of the caliber of Mr. Wilson.
For years past we have had no more
prominent citizen than our nominee for
the second ward. Every important
move that has been made in our city af
fairs for years has received the consi
deration axd advice of Mr. Wilson, and
whenever our citizens have been called
upon to step to tbe front with financial
assistance, Mr. Wilson's name has been
one of the first on the list. As a busi
ness man he has few equals in Pima
county. With a mind endowed with
ricn resources, ne is recognized as one
of our oracles in all matters of public
welfare, and the city can safely trust its
most important affairs in the hands
gentleman long since singled out for his
ability and integrity.
Ocr city nominee for city treasurer
has never been defeated at the poll
Mr. W. E. Felix is one of the most
favorably known young men in the
city of Tucson. For years Mr. Felix
was cashier of the great firm of L. Zeok
endorf & Co. Lieavicg this important
bussinees, he established and became
the proprietor of the large mercantile
house at the corner of Congress and
Church streets, where he conducts
heavy dry goods business. Mr. Felix
is tbe present treasurer of the city, and
has conducted his office with the regula
rity and efficiency of a banking itstitu
tion. No flaw can be picked in his
official record, and no reason can be
assigned why W. E. Felix should not be
re-elected treasurer of the city.
None of our citizens will contend that
we can better our condition by a ohange
in this office, all business having been
conauctod to the entire satisfaction of
all classes of our citizens. The young
republicans will give this youegman
sapport that is irresistable.
Fok city marshal the republican party
has nominated in the person of Robert
E. Paul, one of the most efficient city
officials that Tueson ever had. Some
months since Marshal Paul was nomi
nated by the mayor and elected by the
council to fill a vacancy in that import
ant office, and his excellent conduct of
the business intrusted to him deserves
an election at the hands of his fellow
citizens next Monday. The citizens in
tereeted in tbe good name of our city
can form the best impression of the
work of Marshal Paul by attending the
sessions of the recorder's court. From
the superficial observation of our cityi
affairs a person can form but an inade
quate idea of tbe conglomerate mass of
humanity that is gathered together each
twenty four hours to give an account of
their doings to the reoorder. That an
eagle eye is kept on this class of incom
ers is due the fact that we are compara
tively free from the series of crimes that
are the outcome of such temporary
sojourners in our midst. Mr. Paul has
endeavored to serve the people in
manner that would secure their proper
ty interests. He is a hard working
conscientious officer whom no labors tire.
as long as he has work: to do, and the
people appreciate his merits as city mar
shal.
Mr. Pedro Lopez the contractor and
builder, who was for years, identified
with Mr. L. M. Prinoe in his business of
contracting and building, has been
nominated by the republican party for
councilman at large of this city. Care
fully educated, a perfect master of bis
trade sober conscientious and ictelli
gent. Mr. Lopez soon acquired a busi
standing that enabled him to branoh
out in depended tly and today; some of
the most important contracting work in
tbe city is conducted by our councilman
at large. Mr Lopez is a real estate
owner, and appreciates fully that the
time has come for Tucson to step to the
front and secure all the benefioial re
sults thut can accrue to tbe city from
intelligent action in its municipal affairs
we are of tbe opinion that question can
beet intrust its interests to men identifi
ed with its business and subject to its
uture prosperity and Mr. Lopez is a
man of this kind. D uring the cam
paign recently past it was a demonstra
ted fact that our councilman at large
was a public speaker of merit able to
clearly set forth his ideas on public
matters in a clear and comprehensible
manner and we feel assured if Mr. Lopez
is elected Tucson will have a progres

Washington, Deo. 2. An official in a
position to know, says Japan has made
a reply favoring China's offer present
ed through United States Minister
Denby. It still remains for China to
make it plain that she can and will
exeoute what she has proposed. Until
then there will be no cessation of hos
tilities. The terms of the offer is said
to be about $125,000,000 cash indemnity
and China's relinquishment of suzerain
ty over Corea. There is said to be no
surrender of China's territory.
Managua, Deo. 2. All Zelaya and
Baas efforts are to preserve peace, but
it is believed this is impossible. There
are a number of small bands whioh the
government insists upon calling ban
dits. It is believed this government is
making too many concessions to Eng
gland and English partisans of Ortiz are
most active iooiting the people. Troops
have been and are now sent to Nicara-jruan-Honduraa
frontiers, where a large
number of deserters from both armies
congregate and raid alternately on first
one and the other country and the gov
ernment of Honduras has been advised
that it must take some steps to stop
this. The government, in view of the
threatening difficulties, is promising
mny reforms.
New York, Dec. 2 Japan has aug
mented her navy by the purchase of the
crack Chilian oruiser Esmeralda. . Tbe
deal was consummated here within the
last few days and was managed with
great adroitnee, Chiii first selling the
ship to Ecuador, and tbe later country
transferring it to Japan. To further
disguise f acts, a report was given our
rency that China had bought the ship.
This was to avoid suspicion until the
ship was well eut of danger of being ap
prehended on tbe high seas. She is now
on her way to Japan by way of Tahits.
Tbe purchase price was over $1,000,000
gold cash. The sale by Chili violates
no neutrality law, as Chili has no treaty
with China or Japan and moreover her
sale was to Ecuador, who is also with
out a treaty with either of the beliger-
ents.
Washington, Dec. 4. The annual
report of the secretary of the treasury
on the state of the finances was sent to
congress today. It shows the revenue
from all sources of the government for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1891 was
$372,802,498, and expeditures $442,605,
758 thus showing a deficiency of $60,803-
200.
As compared with the fiscal year for
1893 the receipts forl894 fell off $88,914-
082.
During the year there was a decrease
of $15,952,674 in tbe ordinary expenses
of the government.
From customs that were received
$16,000,000; from internal revenue $16-
500,000; from miscellaneous sources
$1,500,000; from postal servioe $84,427
743.
Total estimated revenues $424,427,748.
Expenditures for same peroid esti
mated as follows; For civil establish
ment $919,960,000; for military estab-
liahnent $53,350,000; for naval estalish-
ment $325,000,000; for indian services
811,500,000; for pensions $140,500,000;
interest on puplio debts $315,000,000;
postal service $84,457,749.
Aotai expenditures 9ili,rzi,lis, or a
total deficit of $2,000,000. It is estima
ted that on the basis of the existing
laws revenue of the government for
fiscal year 1896 will be from customs
8185,000.000; from intern revenue $19,
uw.uuu; rrom miscellaneous sources
$15,000,000; from postal servioe $86,907
407; total estimated revenue $476,907,4
07.
The most interesting portion of the
secretary's report is that devoted to the
subject of currency reform. He says
there are well known the defects in our
financial system and the serious nature
of the evils, threatened by them, have
done more during the last two years to
impair the credit of the government and
people of the United States, at home
and abroad, and check our industrial
and commercial progress, than all other
things oombined. He then reviews the
circumstances tending to the two issu
ance of bonds which he shows to have
been due to a withdrawal of gold from
the treasury through the presentation
of treasury notes for redemption.
On August 7th, 1894 the surplus of
gold from the treasury amounted to $52-
189,500. The second issuance of bonds
sold for 2,878 per cent; he wants congress
to give him the pewer of issue bonds on
a short time and at any time he may see
fit. He then outlines the financial
scheme he proposes as follows:
Repeal the laws authorizing the
deposit of United States bonds as
security for circulation and permit
national backs to issue notes to the
amount of 75 per cent of their paid up
capital, upon their deposticg 30 per
per oent of their circulating notes, out
standing. Stockholders are to be indi
vidually liable. The circulating notes
to constitute the first lien on the assets
of the banks.
An impose tax of one half of one per
cent per annum, on the average amounts
in circulation will be imposed.
No national bank note is to be less
than ten dollars denomination and said
notes are to be redeemed at the banks
own offices.
Five per cent per annum on the aver
age circulation of each bank notes are
to constitute a safety fund for a redemp
tion of the notes of failed banks. When
a bank fails its guarantee fund, held on
deposits to be turned said into the safety
fund. If the fund is Impaired it shall
bs replenished by an assessment on the
other national banks according to the
amounts of their outstanding oircula
tion.
The safety fund is to be invested in
United States bonds.
The secretary wishes a repeal of all
provisions requiring tbe banks to keep
a reeerve on account of its deposits. The
circulation bank notes are to be exempt
from all other taxes than those herein
pecified.
The secretary says his plan is to gra
dually retire all paper money without a
shock to the finances of the oountry and
make banks responsible for redemption
of their own notes.
Washington, Dec. 4 In all parts of

that nothing more than mere talk will

Bebea, Ky., Dec. 4. W. D. Cocdee
and Walter Lyman, white students at
Berea college, when about to retire laet

who overpowered them and tied Ly

near tbe entrance to tbe college, they
produoed a dynamite bomb and ordered
him to light it and throw it in the
entrance. When he refused they
tied his hands, threw bim en
a wood pile, lighted it themselves, threw
it in the entrance and ran away.
Condee got loose, seized the bomb and
threw it in a barrel of water. He then
released Lyman. When tbey examined
the premises, another bomb was found
near tbe wood pile. The feeling against
tbe college is because the inetition
admits white and black students. The
attempt to to blow up the college was
malicious.

ted the revolt by attacking Mueelemen

gall, of Elloitt county, for moonshining.
and was examining Tom Atkins, of li.Ui
ott county, witness for tbe defense,
when the shooting commenced. Wil
ham Watkics, an enemy of Sturgall
became enraged at tbe evidence that
Atkins was giving in favor of Sturgall
and drawing his gun rushed towards
tbe witness stand, firing at Atkins as
he went. The shooting became general
and the court and audience went to
cover to protect themselves from the
flying bullets. Atkins was mortally
wounded. A bullet had entered his
abdomen, and his death is a matter of
only a few hours. Watkius was arrest
ed and taken to jail. Court adjourned
abruptly. The shooting is the result of
an old feud between two different
mountain factions. Watkins says that
Atkins perjured himself on the stand in
order to injure him and that be shot
him for that reason. Atkins-friends
denounce the affair as an asaeesination
and promise to retaliate. More trouble
is feared, as the friends of Watkins are
preparing to protect him.

other pledges in proportion to the de
mands of Japan. It must be stipulated
that the Japanese power is absolute.
Washington D. C. Deo. 3 President
Cleveland in his annual message to
Congress commences as follows:
The assemblage within the nation'
legislative halls of two bodies charged
with the duty of making laws for the
benefit of a generous and free people
impressively suggests an acting oblige
tion and an inexorable responsibility in
the volume of their task. At the
threshold of euoh labor, now to be uc
dertaken by the congress of tbe United
States and in the discharge of the ex
ecutive duty enjoined by the conetitu
tion, I submit tnis communications for
such kgilation as seems to me necessary
and expedient"
Tbe president hret calls attection to
our foreign relations and says "the his
tory of our recent dealings with other
nations, and our peaceful relations with
them at this time, additionally demon
etrates the advantage of our consis
tently adhering to a firm but just foreign
policy, free from envious or ambitious
national scemes and characterized by
honesty and sincereity."
He refers to the request of the
Chinese and Japanese governments

The president says he felt constrain
ed to offer tbe'

in settling the differences with rpgard to
Korea but the Koreans precipitated an
actual hostilities and defeated this
kindly purpose and while deploring
the destructive war between the two
most powerful eastern nations. "I

intervention for honorably term ia ting
hostilities if same would be acceptable
to both beliegrents.
He refers to the German prohibition
against the importations of American
cattle and fresh meats and attributes
this aotion to the German contention
that our new customs laws in placing a
duty on imported sugars is a violation of
their treaty rights. In the interests of

HE RECOMMENDS A REPEAL
of so much of statute as imposes a duty
on suoh sugars.
With regard to Hawaii's he says "since
communicating the volumious corres
pondence iu regard to Hawaiia and the
action taken by the senate and house of
representatives on certain questions
submitted to the judgment and wider
discretion of congress, the organization
of a government in the place of the
provisional arrangement, which follow
ed the deposition of the Queen has been
announced with evidence of its effective
operations. Recognition usual in such
cases has been accorded th new the gov
ernment. The president reviews the unhappy
state of affairs in Samoa and says "I in

The president reviews the reports of
the cabinet officers and refering to

that the grade of Lieutenant General
be revived for the benefit of Major Gen
eral Schol field, who would thus be able
to retire with a rank befitting his
merits.
The appointment of an additional
circuit judge from each district is com
mended to the attention of congress.
He urges the necessary legislation to
secure a reorganization of the Union
Pacific railroad on a basis as regards
private industries and as favorable to
the government as existing condi
tions will permit.
Speaking of the navy, he says: "If
we are to have a navy for warlike oper
ations, offensive and defensive, we cer
tainly ought to increase the number of
our war ships and torpedo boats.
He oonours in the opinion of the sec
retary of the interior that the commis
sioner of the general land office should
be relieved from the duty of deciding
litigation in land cases and that a
NON PARTISAN COURT
ehould be appointed to pass on such
cases, and that the decisions of this
court should be final.
The Indian question is reviewed at
length, and the president is of the opin
ion that tbe allotment of land to Indians
should be made very carefully.
He gives some peasion statistics and
saysjthat tbe commissioner of pensions is
of the opinion that inasmuch as the
year 1895 is the thirtieth year after the
co6e of the war of the rebellion, it must,
according to all sensible human calcula
tions, see the highest limit of the pen
sion roll, and after that year it must be
gin to decline.
BABE FACED AND EXTENSIVE PENSION
FRAUDS
have been exposed under the direction
of the courageous commissioner, now at
tbe head of the pension bureau, and
leaves no room for the claim that no
purgation of our gension rolls was need
ed, and that the continued vigorous and
prompt action will not end. Accusa
tions that efforts to restrict the pension
frauds is evidence of unfriendliness to
our worthy veterans and a denial of
their claims to the generosity of the gov
ernment, suggests an unfortunate iudif
ference to the commission of an offense
which has for a motive the procuring
of a pension and the indication of a wil
lingnees to believe in the existence ef
mean and treacherous crimes which h
can lay upon his democratic friend and
belittle the patriotic impulses of a grate
ful people.
The report of the Secretary of Agri

The tariff act passed by tbe last ses

IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS.
"I am still in favor of putting coal

sugar schedule is concerned I ehould be
glad to see every particle of duty on re
fined sugar striken out of the tariff laws.
If with all the favors now accorded to
tbe sugar refining interests it still lang
uishes to the extent of closing the re tin
eries and discharging thousands of
workmen, it would seem to present a
hopeless oaee for reasonable legislative
aid."
In order to stimulate commerce the
president recommends the prompt
repeal of the law denying American
registery t? ships built abroad and
owed by Americans.
The president refers to the new issue
of bonds and says "Nothing could be
worse cor further removed from sensible
finance than the relations existing
between tbe currency our government
has issued and held for redemption and
tbe means which must be resorted to
for a replenishment of such redemption
fund when impaired. These obligation
when redeemed in gold are not cancelled
but are re issued and may do buty many
times and in this way draws gold from
tbe treasury. Thus we have an endless
chain of operations. Operations which
are
CONSTANTLY DEPLETING THE TREASURY
of its gold and never reaches a final
rest, and as if this was not bad enough
we are held by a statutory declaration
that it is the policy of the government
to maintain a parity between gold and
silver. Tbe force and momentum of
this exhausting process has added
argely to our currency obligations by
claiming that it is pecuiary a gold re
demption. It is palpably plain that
the only way under the present condi
tions by which this reserve, so danger
ously depleted, can be replenished, is
through the issue and sale of the bonds
of the government for gold. And yet
oongrest has not only so far declined to
authorize the issue of bonds, as best
suit this purpose, but seems diposed, in
some quarters, to deny both the neces
sary and the power for issue of bonds at
all. I cannot for a moment believe that
any of eur citizens are willing the gov
ernment should default in its pecuniary
obligations, or that its financial opera
tions ehould be reduced to a silver
basis. At any rate I could not feel that
my duty was done if I omitted any effort
I could take to avoid such calamity.
As long, therefore, as no provison is
made for tbe final redemption of our
corrency obligations, and as long aa no
better authority for a bond issues is
made than at present exists, such atbor- j
ity will bo utilized whenever, and as
often, as it becomes necessary to main
tain a sufficint gold reserve and in
abundant time to save the credit of the
country and make good tbe financial
obligations of our government.
All questions relating to our bonds
and currency are closely connected
with the subject last referred to and
they also present some unsatisfactory
features. Prominent among them are
lack of elasticioity in our currency cir
culations and its frequent concentration
in financial centers, when it is most
needed in other parts of tbe country;
the
ABSOLUTE DIVORCEMENT
of the government from tbe business of
banking is the ideal relation of the gov
ernment to the circulation of the coun
try. This condition cannot be immedi
tely reached, but it is a step in that
direction, and as a means of securing a
more elastic currency and obviating all
objections to the present arrangement
of back circulation.
The secretary of the treasury pre
sents in his report a scheme modifying
the presents banking laws and provides
for the issue of circulating notes, free
from taxation, under certain limitations.
The secretary explains his plan so plain
ly and its advantage, as developed by
him, with such remarkable clearness
that any effort on my part to present an
argument is its support would be super
flous. I shall, therefore, content myself
with unqualifiedly endorsing the views
of the secretary in the proposed changes
in the laws.
It is proposed to repeal ell laws pro
viding for a deposit of United States
bonds as security for circulation and to
permit national banks to issue a circul
atingnote, not exceeding the amount of
seventy five per cent of ther paid up and
uninpaired capital, provided they deposit
with the government as a guarantee
fund in United States legal tenders,
other notes, including treasury notes of
1890, a sum equal to the amount of 30
per cent of notes they desire to issue,
this deposit to be maintained at all times.
But when any bank retires any part of
its circulation, a proportionate amount
of its guarantee fund shall be returned
to it In addition to the guarantee
funds it is proposed to provide a safety
fund for the immediate redemption of
the circulating notes of failed banks
by imposing a small annual tax, say one-
half of one per cent, on the average cir
culation of each bank until the fund
amounts to fivs per oent of the total
circulation outstanding.
When a bank fails its guarantee fund
is to be paid into this safety fund, thus
augmentng any impairement of eaid fund
to be made good by the immediate va
luable cash assets of said bank, and if
these should be insufficient such impair
ment to be made good by a pro-rate
assessment among the other banks,
their contributions constituting a first
lien upon the assets of the failed bank
in favor of the contributing banks. As
a further security it fa contemplated
that the existing provision fixing the
individual liability of stockholders is to
be sustained and a bank's indebtedness
of account left to its circulating notes,
is to be made a first lien on all its assets.
It further provides that there shall be
no national bank notes issued of a less
denomination than ten dollars. Anoth
er very important feature of this plan is
the exempting of state backs from tax
ation by the United States in cases
where it is shown to the satisfaction of
tbe Secretary of tbe Treasury and Con
troller of Currency, by banks claiming
such exemption, that tbey have not out
standing their circulation notes, ex
ceeding 75 per cent of their paid up
and unimpaired capital; that their stock
holders are individually liable for the
redemption of their circulating notes to
the full amount of their ownership of
stock; that the liability of said banks,
upon their circulating notes, constitut
ing under their statute laws,
A FIRST LIEN UPON THEIR ASSETS;
that such banks have kept and main
tained guarantee fund in United States
legal tender notes equal to thirty per
cent of their outstanding circulating
notes, and that such backs have prom
ptly redeemed their circulating notes
when presented at their principal or
branch officer. It i quite likely that
this schema may be usefully amended
in soma of its details, but I am satisfied
it furnishes a basis for a very great im
provement of our present banking and
currency system. Ia concluding this
communications and fully appreciating
the reepocsiblity ot all legislation
affecting the people of the United
State rests upon their represedtatives
in congre?9, and assuring them that
whether in accordance with the recom
mocdation I have made, or not, I shall
be free to cooperate in pefeoting any
legislation that can add the prosperity
and welfare ot our couutry.

HOUSE.
Washington, Dac. 3. The house was
called to order promptly at noon. Many

SENATE.
Washington, Dec. 3 Promptly at 12
o'clock vice-Preeident Stevenson called
the senate to order and Chaplain Mil

referred feelingly to the critical illness
through which the daughter of Steven

president that tbe senate was in session
Cockrell (Missouri Democrat), Chair
man of the Committee on Appropria

adopted, providing that daily sessions
of tbe Senate begin at 12 noon.
Roll call developed the presence of
66 senators, considerably more than a

Breaktrt Ahead!
Prudecoe, foresight, that might have
saved many a good ship that has gone
to pieces among the breakers, is a qual
ity "conspicuous by its absence among
many classes of invalids, and among
none more notably than persons troubled
with inactivity of the kidneys and blad
der. When these organs fall off in dnty
grievous trouble is to be apprehended.
Bright s disease, diabetes, catarrh and
stone in the bladder, are among the dis
eases which a disregard of early sympt
oms confirm and render fatal. That sig
nally effectual diuretic, Hoetetter's

Safe Breaking-
The safe in the office of the Tucson
Lumber company was blown open last
night.
Tbe safe is a large one, about 3x1 feet.
The outside doors were left unlocked,
with tbe inner doors of Bteel half an
inch thick, locked. Powder was used,
and evidently a fuse. Two holes, about
three-eights of an inch in diameter, were
drilled in nearly between the doors.
The powder was then let in, and a fuse
no doubt applied. The work was not
very professional. A hole was first
drilled in tbe top of tbe safe, but that
availed nothing. It was probably then
found that the big outside doors were
not lecked, when the drill was turned
on the inner doors. The outside doors
were left open because of difficulty with
the combination. Sixty-five dollars was
the size of their raise.
Tramps are though to have done the
work.

Captured a S15.0O0 Fugitive-
A man named Hillman, who has been
sought by officers since 1379, was captur
ed by Sam Finley and Under Sheriff
Owen Gemmiil, of Li Junta, Col. Hill
man killed a compauion who strongly
resembled him in 1379, in tbe Buffalo
mountains, Texas, and then took tbe
name of the dead man and impersonated
him. Vbere was SS0,00O insurance on
the lifd of Hillman and Mrs. Hillman
put in a claim for it. Tbe insurance
companies thought all was not right and
put out detectives. Tbe body was found
not to be Hillman's and Hillman be
came a fugitive with 315,000 reward for
his capture. He is now io a fair way
for the gallows. He was captured in
the Salvation army mining camp, in the
Huachucas. on Thanksgiving day. It
was learned by Deputy Sheriff Gemmiil
that Hillman was in Sonora, and he and
Finley have bten on bis trail since thee.
He has been followed from Magdalena
to Altar to Prescott, to Mesa City, Old
Glory and finally the Salvation Army
camp. He is in j-iil at Tombstone
awaiting extradition papers. Sam
Kin ley will probably come in for a third
of the 815,000 reward.
A Coming Camp.
From Sam Watt, who returned yes
terday from Oro Blanco, the Prospector
learns that the mill whioh has been in
course of construction on the Montana
mine is about ready to run. A dam is
being built across a narrow point in a
canyon which wiil after comp'etion hold
sufficient water to run tbe mill 3G5 days
ia thev ear after being once rilled. The
character of the bottom of tbe reservoir
is rock in its natural formation. This
will be cemented as well as the sides. It
is hoped that a sufficient amount of
water will be stored before 60 days hare
passed to make buecess certain. The
lack of water has been the only draw
back to this camp's prosperity.
The wagon ruad being constructed to-
Nogales is about completed and will
assist materially in bringing the new El
Dorado iuto quick communication with
the outside world.
The Griffin mills which have been
