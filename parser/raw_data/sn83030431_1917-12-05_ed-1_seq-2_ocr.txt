seeking to make conquest of psaes by
ftf im.
I believe that t speak for them
when t eay two thing:
First, that thli Intolerable Thins of
which the masters of Oermany have,
shown us tha UKly face, this menace
of combined Intrigue anJ force, which
we now see to clearly as the Uerman
.power, a Thing without conaelenca or
honor or capacity for covenanted
peace, muat be crushed and If, It b
not utterly brought to an end, at .
least shut oit from tha friendly In
tercourse of tha nation"; and,
Second, that, when this- Thing and
tta power are Indeed defeated and the
time "comes that wo can discuss peace
when the German peoplo hava
spokesmen whose word wo can bellevo
and when thoae ipokeimen are ready
In the name, of their people to accept
tha common judgment or tha nation
no to what ahall henceforth be tha
bases of law and of covenant for the
lire of the world wa ahall be willing
and glad to pay the full price for
peace and pay It ungrudgingly. We
know what thai price' will be! It will
be full. Impartial justice Justice done
at every point and to every nation
that the final settlement must afreet,
our enemies as well aa our friends.
Voter of llaiaaaltr Speaking.
Ton catoh with me the voices or
humanity that are In the air. They
grow dally more audible, more articu
late, more persuasive and they come
from the heart or men everywhere.
Thar Insist thai the war ahall not
tad In vindictive action of any kind;
that no nation or people ahall be
robbed or punished because the Irre
sponsible rulers of a single country
have themselves done deep and abom
inable wrong.
It U this, thought that haa been
expressed In 'the .formula, "no annexa
tions, no contributions, no punitive In
demnities." Just because this crudo
formula expresses the Instinctive Judg
ment as to right of plain men every
where It haa been made diligent use
of by the masters of German' Intrigue
to lead the people of Russia astray,
and the people of every other country
their agents could reach. In order that
a premature pence might be brought
about before autocracy has been
taught Its final and convincing lesson
and the people of the world put In
control of their own destinies.
But the fact that a wrong use has
keen made of a Just' Idea Is no reason
why a right use should not be mado
of It It ought to be brought under
the-patronawVof Its real friends. Let
It be said again that autocracy muat
first be ahown the utter futility of Ita
claims to power or leadership In the
modern world. It Is Impossible to ap
ply any standard of Justice so long aa
such forces are unchecked and unde
feated ns the present masters of Ger
many command. Not until that has
been dono can Right be set up as
arbiter and peacemaker among the
nations. But when that has been dono
as, God willing. It assuredly will be
we shall at last be free to do an
unprecedented thing and thla Is the
time, to avow our purpose to do It
W shall be. free to base peace on
generosity and. justice, to the exclusion
r all selfish claims to advantage even
on the part of the victors.
Nothing? Shall Tarn Vm Aside.
Let there be no misunderstanding.
Our present and Immediate task Is to
, win the war and nothing shall turn
us aside from It until It Is accom
published. Every power and resource
we possess, whether of men, of money
or of material Is being devoted and
will continue to be devoted .to that
purpose until It Is achieved. Those
who desire to bring peace about be
fore that purpose Is achieved- I coun
sel to carry their advice elsewhere.
We .will not entertain K. We shall re
gard the war only as won when tha
German people say to us, through
properly accredited representatives,.'
thft they are ready to agree to a set
tlement based upon Justice and the
reparation of the wrongs their rulers
have done. They have done a wrong
to 'Belgium, which must be 'repaired.
They have established a power over
other lands and peoples than their
own over the great empire of Austria-Hungary,
over hitherto free Bal
kan States, over Turkey and within
Asia which must be relinquished.
Germany's 'success by skill, by In
dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise,
we did not grudge or oppose, but ad-
- mired rather! She had built up for
herself a real empire of trade and In
fluence, secured by the race of the
crld. We wero content to abide the
rivalries of manufacture, science and
coi7ercc that were Involved for u.i
In her uryvw and stand or fall as we
had or did noi iWVttVtJns and the
Initiative to surpass her. dl t the
moment when she had conspicuously
won her triumphs of peace she threw
them away to establish In their stead
what the world will no longer permit
to be established, military and politi
cal domination by arms by which to
oust where she could not excel the
rivals she most feared and hated.
Mast Break Prussian Menace.
The peace we make must remedy
that wrong . It must deliver the once
fair lands and happy peoples of Bel
"eiuni and northern Franco from tho
Prussian conquest and the Prussian
menace, but It must also deliver the
peoples of Austria-Hungary, the peo
ples of the Balkans and the peoples
of Turkey, alike In Europe and In
Asia, from ths Impudent and alien
domination of the Prussian military
and commercial autocracy.
We owe It, .however, to ourselves to
say that we do not wish In any way
to Impair or to rearrange the Austro
Hungarlan Empire. It In no affair of
ours what they do with their own'
life, either Industrially nr politically.
Wo do not purpose or desire to dic
tate to them In any way. We only
desire to see that their affairs are
left In their own hands. In all mat
ters, great or small. We shall hope
to secure for the peoples of the Bal
kan peninsula and for the people of
the Turkish 'Empire the right and op
portunlty to make their own lives
safe, their own fortunes secure against
oppression or Injustice and from the
dictation of foreign courts or parties,
ami our attitude und purpose with re
gard to Germany herself are of a
like kind. We Intend no wrong against
the German Empire, no Interference
with her Internal affairs. AVe should
deem either the one or the other ab
solutely unjustifiable, absolutely con
trary trt the principles wohave prof eased
to live by and to hold most sacred
throughout our life as a nation.
Germans Deceived by Starters.
The people of Germany are being
told by the men whom they now per
mit to deceive them and to act as
their masters that they are fighting
for the very life and existence of
their empire, a war of desperate self
defence against deliberate aggression.
Nothing could be more grossly or wan
tonly false, and we must seek by the
utmost openness and candor as to our
real alms lo comlnce them of Its
falseness. We are In fact fighting for
their emancipation from fear, along
with our own, from the fear as well
as from the fact of unjust attack by
neighbors or rivals or schsmers afte
world empire. No one la threatening
tho existence or the Independence or
the peaceful enterprise of the Ger
man Empire.
The worst that ran happen to tho
detriment of the German peoplo Is
this, that If they should still, after
the war la over, continue la b. obliged
to live under ambitious and Intriguing
masters. Interested to disturb the
peace of the world, men or classes of
nvn whom the other peoples of the
world rould not trust. It mlM h i.
poMMl,-to admit them to the vartner
iftdp of nations which must hence
forth guarantiee, the world's peace, t
That partnership must bo a partner- I
ship of peortJtlS n a mere partner
ship of governments. It might lie Im
possible also, in such untoward cir
cumstances, to admit Oermnny to the
froo eronomliCInlercourno which must
Inevitably soring out of the other
partnerships ."of a. real peace. But
there would be no aggresnlon In that ;
and such a, situation, Inevitable be
cause, of distrust, would, In the very
nature qf things', sooner or later cur
itself by processes which would as
suredly set In.
TJ wrongs, the, very deep wrongs,
cohYrnlttod In this war will have to
be righted:- That or course. But
they cannot and must not be righted
by the commission of similar wrongs
against Germany and her allies. The
world will not permit the commission
of similar wrongs as a means of rep
aration and settlement. Statesmen
must by this time have learned that
the opinion of the world Is everywhere
wide awake" and fully comprehends
the Issues Involved. No representa
tive of any self-governed nation will
dare disregard It by attempting any
such covenants of selfishness and com
promise as wsre entered Into at the
congress of .Vienna.
Must Hear Plain People.
The thought' eT tho plain people
here and everywhere throughout the
'World, the- people who' enjoy no priv
ilege and have very simple 'and un
sophisticated standards of right and
wrong. Is the air all Governments
must henceforth breathe If they would
live. It la in the full disclosing light
of that thought that all policies must
be conceived and executed In this mid
day hour of the world's life.' '
German rulers have been .able to.
.upset the peace of the world only
because the German people were not
suffered under thejr tutelage to share
the comradeship of the other peoples
of the world either In thought or In
purpose. They were allowed to have
t no opinion of their own which might
bo set up as a rule of conduct for
those who exercised authority over
them. But the congress that' concludes
this war will feel the full strength of
the tides that run now In the hearts
and consciences of free men every
where. Its conclusions will run with
those tides.
All these' things have been true
from the very beginning of this stu
pendous war, and I cannot help think
ing that If they had been made plain
at tne very .outset the sympathy and
enthusiasm of the Russian people
might have been once for all enlisted
on the side of the Allies, suspicion
and distrust swept away and a real
and lasting union of purpose effected.
Had they believed these things at
the very moment of their revolution
and had they been confirmed In that
belief since, the sad reverses which
have uecently marked the progress
of their affairs toward an ordered and
stable government or. frco men might
have been avoided.
The Russian people have been poi
soned by the ' very same falsehoods that
have' kept the German people In the
dark, and the poison has been ad
ministered .by the very same hands.
The only possible antidote Is the
truth. It cannot be uttered too plainly
or too often.
Price of Justice Great.
From every point of view, there
fore. It has seemed to be my duty
to -ipeak those declarations of purpose,
to add these specific. Interpretations
to what I took the liberty of saying
to the Senate In January. Our en
trance Into the war haa not altered
our attitude toward the settlement
that must come when It Is over. When i
I said In January that the nations
of the world were entitled not only to
i free pathways upon the sea, but also
1o -"assured and' unmolested access to
thoo pathways, I 'was thinking, and
I am thinking now, not of the smaller
and weaker nations alone, which need
our countenance and support, but also
of the great and powerful nations and
of our present enemies as well as our
present associates In the war. I was
thinking, and am thinking now, of
Austria herseir, among the rest, as
well an of Serbia and of Toland.
Justice and equality of rights can
be hnd only at a great price. Wo are
seeking permanent, not temporary,
foundations for the peace of the
world nnd miist seek them candidly"
and fearlessly. As always, the right
will prove to be the expedient.
What shall we do then, to push
this great war of freedom and Justice
to Its righteous conclusion? We must
clear away with a thorough hand all
Impediments to success and we muat
make every adjustment of law that
will facilitate the full and free use
of our whole capacity and' force as a
fighting unit.
n very' embarrasilng obstacle that
staRaw'r on r way Is that we are at
war with ..'Jj.-ren.v but not with her
allies. I therefore. earDAsM
reeommesd that the Congress imnedl
ately declare ths United States) la a
tale of war with Aaitrta-Hnngary.
Doca U seem strange to you that
this should bo the conclusion of the
argument I have Just addressed to
you? It Is not It Is In tact the in
evitable logic of what I have said.
Austria-Hungary Is for the time being
not her own mistress, but simply the
vassal of the German Government.
We must face the facts as they are
and act upon them without sentiment
In thla stern business. Tho Govern
ment of Austria-Hungary Is not act
ing upon Its own Initiative or In re
sponse, to the wishes and feol'nga of
Its own peoples, but as the Instrument
of another nation.
We must meet Its forco with our
own and regard the Central Powers
as but one. The war can be success
fully conducted In no other way. The
same logic would lead also to a decln
ration of war against Turkey and Bul
garia. They also are the tools or
Germany. But they are mere tools
and do not yet stand In the direct
path or our necessary action. We shall
go wherever the necessities or this war
carry us, but It seems to me that we
should go only where Immediate and
practical considerations lead us and
nor heed any others.
The financial and military measures
which must bo adopted will suggest
themselves as the war and Its under
takings develop, but I will take the
liberty of proposing to you certain
other acta of legislation which seem
to me to be needed for the support
of the war and for the release of our
whole force and energy.
Legislation Mast Be Extended.
It will be necessary to extend In
certain particulars the legislation of
the last session with regard to alien
enemies ; and also necessary, I believe,
to create a very definite and particu
lar control over the entrance and de
parture of nil persons Into and from
tho United States.
Lrglilatlon ihoold he enacted de
fining as n criminal offence every wi.
fnl ilnlatlon of the Presidential proc
lamation! relating to enemy aliens
promulgated under lertlon 4007 of
the revised statutes nnd providing an-
propr'nte pnntthmrntsi and women as
well as men should be Iselnded under
the terms of the acts placing restraint
upon alien enemies. It Is likely that
at time goes on many alien enemies
will be willing to be fed and hoased
at the expense of the Government In
the detention esinps, and It would he '
the purpose of the legislation I hare
..suggested to eontlae offenders among
tti em In penitentiaries aid other slml.
lur Institutions, where they ronld be
made to Work as other criminals do.
Recent experience haa convinced me
that the Congress must go further In
authorising the Government to set
limits to prices. The law of supply
and demand, I -am to s.iy, has
been replaced by ' the law of unre
strained selfishness, While we hava
eliminated profiteering In several
branches of Industry It still runs
Impudently rampant In others. The
farmers, for example, complain with
n great deal of Justice that, whlln the
regulation or rood prices restricts their
incomes, no restraints are placed upon
tho prices or most or the things they
must themselves purchase, and similar
Inequities obtain on nil sides,
It Is Imperatively necessary that
the consideration of the full use of the
water power of tho country and also
the consideration of the systematic
nnd yet economical development of
such of tho natural resources of tho
country as are still under the control
of the Federal Government should be
resumed and affirmatively and con
structively dealt with at the earliest
possible moment The pressing need
of such legislation la dally becoming
more obvious.
Forelun Trade Xrrta Attention.
The legislation proposed at the last
session with regard to regulated com
binations among bur exporters. In
order to provide for our foreign trade
a more effective organisation and
method or cooperation, ought 'by alt
means to bo completed at this ses
sion. And I beg that the members or the
House or Representatives will permit
me to express the opinion that It will
be Impossible to deal in any way but
n very wasteful and extravagant fash
Ion with the enormous appropriations
of the public moneys which must con
tinue to bo made. If tha war Is to be
properly sustained, unless the Houso.
will consent to return to Its former
practice or Initiating and preparing
all appropriation bilks through a
single committee, In order that re
sponsibility mrty be centred, expendi
tures standardised and made uniform
and waste and duplication as much
as possible avoided.
Additional legislation may also be
come necessary before the present.
Congress adjourns In order to effect
the most efficient coordination and
operation or tha railway and other
transportation systems or the coun
try; but to that I shall, ir circum
stances should demand, call the at
tention or Congress upon another oc
casion. ir I have overlooked anything that
ought to be done for the more ef
recllve conduct or the war, your own
counsels will supply the omission.
What I am perfectly clesr about Is
tha In the present session or the
Congress our whole attention and
'energy should be concentrated on the
vigorous and rapid and successful
prosecution or the great task or win
ning the war.
Wo can do this with all the greater
xeal and enthusiasm because we know
that for us tnls Is a war or high
principle, debased by no selfish am
bition of conquest or spoliation; be-cau-e
we know, and all the wxrld
knows, that we have been forced Into
It to save the very Institutions we
live under from corruption and de
struction. The purposes of the Cen
tral Powers strike straight nt the
very heart of everything we believe
In; their methods of warfare outrage
every principle cf humanity and of
knightly honor: their Intrigue has
corrupted the very thought and spirit
of many of our people: their sinister
and secret diplomacy has sought to
take our very territory away from
us and disrupt the union or the State.
Our pafety would be at an end, our
honor forever sullied and brought'
Into contempt were we to permit their
triumph. They are striking at the
very existence of democracy ond liberty.
Intent Should Be Irreproachable.
It Is because It Is for us n. war of
high, disinterested purpose, In which
all the free peoples of tho world aro
banded together for the vindication
of right, a war for the preservation
of our nation nnd of nil that It has
held dear of principle nnd of pur
pose, that wc feel .ourselves doubly
constrained to propose for Its outcome
only that which Is righteous and of
Irreproachable Intention, for our roe's
as well as for our friends.
The cause being Just and holy, tho
settlement must bo of like motive and
quality. For this we can fight, but
for nothing les noble or less worthy
of our traditions. For this cause we
entered the war and for this cause
will we battle until the last gun Is
'fired.
I have spoken plainly because this
seems to me the time when It Is
most necessary to speak plainly, in
order that all tho world may know
that een In the heat and ardor of
the struggle and, when our whole
thought Is of carrying the war
through to Its end we have not for
gotten any Ideal or principle for
which tho name of America haa been
held In honor among the nations and
for which It has been our glory to
-ontend In tho great generations that
Vint be'vre us.
A supreme moment of history has
corse. The eyes of tho people have
been opened nnd they see. The hand
of G,-4 is laid upon the nations. He
will s.nw them favor, I devoutly be
lieve, -ily If they rise to the clear
heights uT v.wn Justice and m-rs,..
"BEAT GERMANY FIRST."
Gerard Says That la the Moral of ,
President's Address.
James W. Gerard, tormerly American
Ambassador to Germany, made this
statement la-rt night, arter reading Pres
ident Wgson's nddres to Congress:
"As an American I am proud or the
clear, splendid statement or 'our great
President. Only thon possessed or
vliiion llko the President or or those
who have been In Germany during the
war can appreciate the nearness or the
dnngcr which still threatens the world
Beot Oermany first and talk afterward
that Is the moral of the President's
address, and with all those who wish
that result I feel that It Is the duty of
every American to let the President run
the war nnd direct not only the fighting
but the talking. Therefore I have noth
ing tn say on the subject except to re
Iterate my admiration for the address,"

A'eto York morntnp newspapers com

WOULD Unquestionably tho Presi
dent has voiced the sentiment of the
American people both In his definition
of the kind ot peace that can bo ac
cepted and In his; call for the most vig
orous prosecution of the war of which
the nation Is capable. We bellovo, as
well, that hef has voiced the sontlment
of all the great peoples who are spilling
their blood and treasure In resisting the
domination of the moot ruthless mili
tary autocracy known to modern his
tory'. I" him the democracies nf the
world have round a leader whoso eyes
look, steadily and unflinchingly toward
the light
TIMES The President's address itnt
once lUumlnating nnd Inspiring. It
throws the clear light or truth and
reason upon the path which we are pur
suing, It answer questions, dissolves
doubts, It Justifies. It will Inspire the
American people to new courage. It will
strengthen their resolve. It will fortify
them to endure the burdens and losses
of war. It Is a uniting utterance. Its
rplrlt Is that of the people of the coun
try, of the whole people. To our allies,
with other evidences so abundant, it
gives the assurance that the people of
the United States, solidly, unflinchingly,
with clear knowledge of what they have
undertaken and with full determination
to achieve that purpose, give their
united support to the President in his
consecration of all our resources of
men, of money, or material, or courage
and or fortitude to the purposes or the
war.
TRIBUNE President Wilson's mes
sage to Congress breathes the country1
truo purpose In' prosecuting the war.
However much wo may define and re
define our attitude toward diplomatic
settlements at the end of tho war, our
main purpose remains clearcut and un
mistakable. The after the war settle
ments are secondary and subsidiary.
They are for the future and. will depend
not on what we think or say now
but on what the situation Is when the
war Is finished. So long as we accom
plish our one definite purpose, which
is to overthrow tho militaristic autoc
racy now intrenched In the Central Eu
ropean States. It Is of minor
conseouence to us what particular re-l
adjustment of territorial boundaries In
Europe. Asia and Africa may coma out,
of a peace congress.
ir. rn.nn a . tnr
LAst January, before we declare a war.
"pecc without victory." Since we seek
victorv now that man has become lnan- .
comnetent for the United Htates to an- .
prove last January the formuU of no In- i
demnltles and no annexations. But as a
belligerent It Is imprudent for us to tie
ourselves down to BUCh a formula. We
cannot be true to our main purpose of
exterminating Ilohenxolleralsm and
Ilapsburglsm and at the same time dep.
recate Interference with the territorial
boundaries or "Internal affairs of Ger- I
many and Austria-Hungary."
We do Interfere In nn extreme sense
with tho "Internal affairs" of Germany
and Austro-Hungary when we dcclaro
that we mean to expel the German and
Austro-Hungarlan Imperial houses and
to subvert both the efficient despotism
ft Germany and the inefficient despot
Ism of Austria-Hungary.
' STAATR-ZEITUNG Summed up and
totalled, what Air. Wilson will accept an
a basis for peace with Germany and
Austria-Hungary appears to be the elim
ination of tho present German Govern
ment and the destruction of Its Influ
ence beyond Its own borders.
This and certain reparatory demands
la apparently all that stands between
these countries and peace to-day. How
long It will be permitted to stand de
pends upon their own peoples.
"The President Is a man who keeps his
woid, and It Is a strong word that he
uttered before the Congress yesterday.
NEW YORKER HEROLD The strik
ingly outstanding point In the Presi
dent's message lo Congress Is the state
ment that a declaration of war on Austria-Hungary
Is the logical demand ot
circumstances. R Is reported tho Presl-

The san.; logic, the President ex-
plains, demand a declaration of war
on Bulgaria anJ Turkey, but ruch a
step, he added, wv not necessary at
thin moment, since aa regards trese two
nations different mlllt.t. cons!dTat!ons
obtain. For the balance, if .Lzrcars
breathes firm determination to continue
the wir until the alms and purposes of
the United States have been attained
and realized.

This view we did not, however, desire
to place In the forefront, for It Is still
a question whether tho President did
allude to that, an It Is equally a question
whether he regards the alleged secret

HERALD As the President holUs out
hope to the German people for admis

once they have proved themselves free,
so he has no hesitancy In showing them
what will happen If they continue to per
mit themselves to live under ambitious
and Intriguing masters, men or classeH
of men wltom the other peoples of the
world could not trust. If they are to
continue the tools of the militarists now
In control or their Government they
necessarily will be excluded from the
partnership of nations, for that partner

PLAIN DEALER (Cleveland) The
outstanding feature of the President's

tion that Congress ..shall at once de
clare a state of war betweon this Re
public and the Empire of Austria-Hungary
a move which Americans will In
dorse without equivocation. Tne oniy

V7E3TLICHB POST (St. I.oui)
President Wilson In his annual message
to Congress advocated an Immediate
declaration of war against Austrl.i-IIun-
gary, thus placing himself in full accord
with the exoressed views of most of the
Jeadlng members of the Senate and the
House of Repreentatlvcs. This Is ns
It should be, for the recent stato of af
fairs could not havo been Indefinitely
maintained any moro than could have
the relation between .Germany nnd Italy
two years ago after' the latter had en
tered the war against Austria.
Looking at It from every point of view
the President's action can be taken and
considered only a a nntural, yes, Inevit
able, step In the development of events.
In fact, such action should hae been
taken long ago. It Is our opinion that
if this war Is to be won It can be won
only by the United Htates of America,
and we must not hamper nor handicap
ourselves by maintaining neutral or
friendly relations with any Power that
may be an ally or Germany.

Washington, Dec 4. Declaration of

United States and the Dual Monarchy
because the state of war, which Con-.
gress Is about to declare exists, actually
has been a fact for many months,
Scores of Austro-Hungarlan subjects ,
suspected of being enemy agents In this
country will be arrested within a rew
hours after a declaration or war. Many
or these men have been under surveil
lance by Department or Justice agents
for months but have not been taken Into
custody becauso ot lack of definite evi
dence. When Congress adopts President Wil
son's recommendation that a state of
war against Austria-Hungary be de
clared unnaturallxed subjects of the Dual
Monarchy automatically .U become
enemy aliens and be subject to sum
mary arrest and Internment.
Recent Exodus of Anstrlans.
For several months Government agents
have been gathering Information on ths
hostile activities of Austrlans, who were
not subject to the restrictions Imposed
on unnaturallxed Germans by the state
of war with Germany. Those caught Ir
Illegal acts were arrested arid tried
technically within the law.
Government Investigators recently re
ported an exodus ot educated Austrlans
from the United States and It Is believed
they fled In anticipation of a formal dec
laration of war against their country.
Among them were known to be men who
had been connected with hostile Inter
ests. Consequently a declaration of war
at this time would be too late to permit
the apprehension of some or the most
danorermis: leaders nf the enemv esnlon-

There havo been no such number ot
depredations on Amerkran lives and
rights by Austrian military forces as
has been the case with Germany, but
Austria, an the willing or unwilling ally
of Germany, has gradually come Into a
position where officials of the American
Government have realised more and
mere clearly that she mut be Included
with Germany as an enemy. This was
apparent even before tho Teutonic In
vasion of Italy made the Austro-Itallan
front literally a part of the western
front, on which American forces are
operating.
There has been no outstanding "overt
act" on the part of Austria against the
United States: there have been rather
a series of ads short of being classed
as cause for war. They go back to the
beginning of the European war.
