CONDITIONS IN WALL STREET.
IT is now almost the middle of December and the winter lull in
trade which usually appears about the last of November has
not yet appeared, except here and there. On the contrary, the
reports to the different commercial agencies speak of a continually
expanding volume of domestic commerce, with a holiday trade which
bids fair to exceed all previous records. The bank clearings testify
to this, the total in November being the largest ever recorded for
The immediate result of this brilliant exhibit has been to lead
the public into all sorts of speculations, based upon a widespread
optimism which no admonitions appear to shake. This is seen in
continued excitement in Wall street, where the daily sales have run
about on an average of 1,500,000 shares per day, with prices rising
on the whole, and some stocks advancing by leaps and bounds, in
several instances from $5 to $10 per share a day.
The situation in this great mart has become very peculiar. Gen
erally a violent advance in the interest rates for call loans has been
sufficient to check undue speculation, but the rule is no longer work
ing at present. Like a deranged clock, it has stopped. With a
money market ranging from 10 per cent in the morning to 27 per
cent in the afternoon, closing at 4 and 5 per cent, and the same
wild fluctuation repeated on the very next day, speculation in rail
way and industrial shares has gone on with an expansion which
savor 6 of recklessness. In fact, the violent advances in the interest
rates have been received by the street with defiance and incredulity,
and many doubts of their genuineness have been expressed.
Prominent and posted operators have loudly proclaimed that
there is no reason for any such rise in rates, and that they are
merely the manipulation of the money market by financiers who
want to discourage speculation at present. This is as loudly denied
by opposing interests, who assert that the advances are genuine and
caused by an actual scarcity of funds, which are being used to move
the crops, and by the refusal of Secretary Shaw r to come to the re
lief of the market with some $25,000,000 or $30,000,000, as he, was
expected to do several weeks ago. The Secretary in his turn says
that he is willing and ready to relieve the market whenever he finds
:t necessary, but that thus far he does not see that the market ac
tually needs his assistance.
The situation seems to be that large financial interests are ar
tificially advancing the interest rates to restrain the present feverish
speculation, but that they are not succeeding. The cry of continued
prosperity and more to come, with a persistent expansion of-trade
based on large crops and a brilliant statistical situation, is the re
sponse of the speculating public to the warnings of the banks and
financiers, and the long interests have fhe whip in their hands and
are lashing the horse into a gallop. It is remarked in this connec
tion that the very interests who are warning the public not to get
excited into excessive buying are quietly unloading their large hold
ings of securities on every advance, and thus making hay while the
sun shines. At the present pace the public will soon have all the
stocks and incidentally the experience, and the great bankers and
other large holders of stocks, having got rid of them at boom
value?, will sink back in their office chairs and with a broad smile
of satisfaction wait to see what the market will do next. It is not
hard to guess, the result.
Aside from this wave of speculation in Wall street conditions
throughout the country continue encouraging. The bank clearings
still show an increase over corresponding periods last year, and
while the weekly gains of late have been smaller, the volume of *the
clearings has run high, generally over $3,©00,000,0003 ,©00,000,000 per week.
Those last week were $3,436,575,000, and the net gain in the coun
try was 1.6 per cent, most of the important cities and towns showing"
an increase. The money in circulation is reported at $88,000,000
more than at this time last year. While funds are expected to rule
high the rest of the year, there is a general agreement among posted
observers that relief is in sight: that while speculation has defied
-all rules during this remarkable year the bankers say one precedent
still holds good, and that is the January return of currency from the
interior to New York. But this may be offset by the large demands
upon the market then for the usual January interest and dividend
disbursements.
The staples have been rather more interesting during the week.
Continued estimates by the Government and Southern associations
as to the volume of the cotton crop have kept the cotton market
excited and fluctuating with the general tendency toward advancing
prices. Hides are quieter, as the leading tanners have supplied their
needs for the time being. Wool is also quiet, the high prices check
ing the demand for the raw material. Provisions show no features
worthy of remark. Trading in grain at Chicago has developed no
striking features beyond an immense demand for oats and a good
export movement in corn. Dun's reports an advance in its index
number for commodity prices to $105,312 on December 1, against
8103,858 the preceding month, and the past week has brought still
another advance.
Conditions on this coast at the moment are largely hinging on
the weather. While the recent rains have enabled the plows .to
start in many localities the current cold nights and frosty mornings
have kept green feed and other vegetation back, and the general
desire now is for more rains and softer weather. Otherwise condi
tions are fully as promising as at any time during the past six or
eight years. .
THE CHICAGO RATE CONVENTIONS.
RATE-MAKING is the one clear cut issue which caused a split
among the delegates who went to Chicago to attend the as
sembly called by President Bacon, with an intent to impress
upon Congress the demand of the people of all parts of the country
for legislation outlined in the President's last annual message. So
explicitly did the call make plain that the meeting was to be an
indorsement convention of the President's rate-making. policy that
the break awa3' of a, minority of the delegates to form a non-indors
ing and adverse convention was manifestly absurd.
To make this plain it is necessary only to quote some words,
from the speech of the leader of the dissenters, D.-M. Parry, presi
dent of the National ; Association of Manufacturers, who said :
"Rather do I prefer to believe that this crusade to endow a political
commission with a socialistic and czar-like power to fix transporta
tion prices is what is popularly and very aptly termed a hot-air
movement." "I am more inclined to take the view that Government
rate-making is an impracticable and dangerous scheme." "A propo
sition that is not a whit better than Government ownership." "It is
from the populace 2nd demagogues that we have come to, expect
propositions that the Government shall interfere with the rights of
property." •
For a reply to Parry, we get it briefest and best from Governor
Van Sant of Minnesota, who said: "The President is right The
people will not submit to the misuse of the vast powers of corporate
wealth : it will not long submit to the dictation of its creatures. The
great trust corporations exist, in fact their life depends, upon special
privileges granted them in the various . States." He quotes with
approval this: "You cannot disguise the fact that it is to be either
Government ownership or Government control."
Among the Republican statesmen who arc not in favor of a third terra
for President Roosevelt doubtless may be counted Senator. Foraker of

that it was as bad as the Philadelphia "gang."— Chattanooga Times.' ,'

MONKEY SHINES OF MARSELEEN
SIR MOREL MACKENZIE AND THE SHREWD BELGIANS.
Sir Morel Mackenzie once received a
wire from Antwerp asking' him his
charges for a certain operation. He
replied £500, and was told to come at
once. When he stepped upon the dock he
was met by three men in mourning, who
informed him sadly that he had come
too late; the patient had died that morn
ing; . . , ''Z^~^mZu± -;.
"But," said the spokesman of the party,
"we know that you did what you could,
and we do not intend that you* shall bo
out of pocket a shilling. v We shall pay you
your full fee." And they did. "And now,"
said the man? "since you are here, what
do you say to visiting: the City Hospital'
and giving a c.inic for the benefit of our
local surgeons? It Is not often they have
an opportunity of benefiting by such
science as yours."
Sir Morel said he would gladly comply.
He went to the hospital and performed
many operations, among which were two
of a similar " nature to that for which
he had been called over. When he finished
all thanked him profusely. On the steam
er going home he met a friend who had
a business house in Antwerp.

LOAN OF A SON.
The monotonous diction of birth no
tices, says the London Express, was
yesterday varied by the following:
"JONES— On the 2d inst, at Cae-
Cla%vdd, Sanderstead,, Surrey, to Mr. and
Mrs. William Roger Jones, the loan of
a son (Victor Rowlatt)." \V
The proud father explains that he and
his wife resard their children as being
lent to them by God to be educated for
his service as medical missionaries or
in other similar capacities. * ,
POWER KNOWLEDGE REALLY IS.
"As the fellow said, knowledge is
power," I ventured to remark.
"Wind-power," said the old man, kind
of sad. "That's one of the things I found
out while I was acquirln' it. Look at
me— me who has studied all my life and
learned most everything, gettin' old and
likely' to die most any time, and all I'll
leave behind is my wife, a clearin' and
grandpa's rifle. The facts I've got to
gether won't be of any use to my widder.
Why, if- 1 started to give 'em to her she
just wouldn't listen:"
"You mowt write 'em down, Peter,"
I says. ;
At that old Pottipher laughed like ne
would die. "Write 'em down— the Idee!"
says he when he could speak audible.
"Don't you understand that if I tried to
write down all I know'd I'd have to live
over a hundred year to finish up?"
"Well, since it won't do you any good,"
I asks, "why are "you botherin' about how
fur you are from that cloud?"
Peter, he smoked quiet like and studied.
Then after a bit, he says, says he:
"Knowin* is a habit. If a man has
brains, the more he puts in 'em the more
they demands. \u25a0 The other day I seen
in the county paper the flggers tellin'
how fur we are from the sun. It didn't
say how it was found out, but I judge
it took a heap of studyin' and squintin'
and sightin* and calculatin*. What good
does it do us to know how many miles
is it to the sun if we ain't intendin' to
walk it? Not a bit; yet it's a nice thing
to know."
"Which goes to prove," says I, "that
knowledge is a luxury.not a ne-cessity."
"Exact," says Peter/
"So the most ignorantest man can get
rich in dollars while the most smartest
is gatherin' only interestin* facts," says I.
"Pre-clse," says Peter; "you've studied
some yourself. .
"Some," I answers, "but not too much,
as I prefer the happy mejum. When I
see you flggerin' over clouds I am more
concided than , ever that ignorance is
bliss, as the fellow ' says."— From "The
Man "Who Studied Cont'nual," by Nelson
Lloyd, in the December Scrlbner's.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
THE PUBLIC DEBT \u25a0 — Subscriber,,
City. On November 1 of 1904 the out
standing principal of the public debt
of the United States was J2.304.697,
418 64. "r-y.'-^c'^j-:^::
CERTIFICATES— C. H. S., City. The

MUGWUMP— P. 8., San Jose, Cal.
"Mugwump" Is from the Algonquin In
dian tongue. , Originally it signified a
head chief or a person of Importance in
a tribe. The "palefaces" applied the
word as a term of derision to a per

ment of wisdom and importance, or
who, as modern slang has it, "has the
big head." It was" in this sense that
the word was used In politics.

The same pretense that we are sheep,

The same rank affectation of the thing

CLEAR THE MIND FOR ACTION
Dorothy Fenimore
YOU know him, don't you, the man
who is always ready for emergen
cies that never arise? He carries,
stowed away, about his person, a set of
pocket tools, a corkscrew, a fruit knife,
a nut pick, pencils, a fountain pen, books
and a. city guide.
His traveling outfit is something formid
able, with its eating paraphernalia. It 3
flasks, the rubber cushions which he takes
to sit upon and to place behind his back.
He wears books out by carrying them
around, although he never opens their
covers; their weight and bulk have be
come so much a matter of necessity to
him that he would feel uncomfortable
and half-dressed without them. /.
He prides himself upon being ready for
emergencies.
Is he? Ninety T nine cases out of a hun
dred he isn't. An emergency is an unex
pected situation— one that you, are not
prepared for. It is an occasion which
tests your Ingenuity.
In order to be ready for emergencies
you do not need tools In your pocket so
much as you need ideas in your head.
Under the former circumstances you are
a slave' to opportunity; under the latter
you are the master, and opportunity is
your genius of the lamp.
The old-fashioned housewife was one
whot stored all kinds of things away in
her attic and cellar, in the hope that they
might come in handy some day. Every
spring she tired her back looking them
over and dusting them off. Usually her
heirs inherited them and sold them for
junk, not appreciating in the slightest
degree her foresight or the dollar or two
which tho sale of them brought.
The new-fashioned housekeeper clears
out of her house all the useless stuff pos
sible. She wants time tollve. Her prob
lem Is, not how she shall prepare for
emergencies which perhaps may arise,
but how she shall fit herself to be equal
to the perplexities of to-day.
The acquisition of useless Information
amounts to the same thing. Only a ge
nius can afford to be a walking reference
library. Brains gather dust when they
are overcrowded. Just as bookcases or at
tics do.
