WILSON'S MESSAGE
President's Address to Both
Houses Is Quite Short.
HAIL TROUBLES COME FIRST
Further Legislation on That Line Is
Strongly Recommended Bill Giv
ing Foreign Commerce Promo
ters Free Hand NeccsGary.
Washington, Dec. C President WIN
on today delivered his message to
tooth houses of congress In Joint bcs
lon. The nddrcss wns ns follows :
3entlcmen of the Congress:
In fulfilling nt this time the duty laid
upon mo by the Constitution of com
municating to you from time to time
information of the state of the Union
and recommending to your considera
tion such legislative measures ns may
t)0 Judged necessnry and expedient I
ehnll continue tho practice, which I
tiopo has been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the reports of tho scvernl
beads of the executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed tieeds f
the public service and confine myself
to those mnttcrs of more general pub
lic policy with which It seems neces
sary and feasible to deal nt the pres
et session of the congress.
I realize tho limitations of time lin
ger wlilch you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
entlons as few ns possible ; but there
'were some things left undone nt the
last session which there will nqw be
time to complete and which It seems
necessary In the Interest of the public
to'do nt once.
In the first place, It seems to me Im
peratively necessnry thnt the earliest
possible consideration and action
should be accorded the remaining
treasures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you nt the close
of. your last session In view of the pub
lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom
modated difficulties which then existed,
-an
fe
y 0
and which still unhappily continue to
xlst, between the railroads of the
untry and their locomotive engineers,
conductors, and trainmen.
Railway Troubles First.
I then recommended:
First, Immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the Interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
In the bill recently pnssed by the house
ot representatives nnd now awaiting
action by the senate ; In order that the
commission may be enabled to deal
with the many great and various duties
now devolving upon It with n prompt
ness and thoroughness which are, with
Its present constitution nnd means of
action, prnctlcally impossible. x
Second, the establishment of nn
Ight-hniir dny as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages In tho cmploy
i ment of all railway employees who are
Actually engaged In the work of oper
ating trains In Interstate transporta
tion. Third, the authorization of tho ap
pointment by tho president of a smnll
tody of men to observe the actual re
sults in experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour dny In railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by the In
terstate commerce commission of nn
.'' Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
. ronds ns may have been rendered nec
essary "by the adoption of tho eight
hour day and which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
end economies, should the facts dis
closed Justify the Increase.
Fifth, nn amendment of the existing
federal stntute which provides for tho
, mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
" of such controversies ns the present
by ndding to it a provision that, in case
tho methods of accommodation now
provided for should fall, n full public
Investigation of the merits of, every
such dispute shjUl be Instituted nnd
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully bo attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment in tho
hands of the executive of the power,
In enso of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railroads of the coun
try ns may bo required for military
use nnd to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft Into
tho military service of tho United
States such train crows nnd adminis
trative officials as tho circumstances
require for their safe and efllclcnt use.
Renews His Recommendations.
Tho second nndthlrd of theso rcc
' smmendntlons the congress Immediate
ly acted on: It established the eight
' hour day as tho legal basis of work
and wuges in train service and It au
thorized the appointment of a com
mission to observe and report upon tho
practical results, deeming theso the
measures most immediately needed;
but It postponed action upon tho other
suggestions until an opportunity should
bo offered for a raoro deliberate con
sideration of them. Tho fourth rec
ommendation I 'do not deem It neces
sary to renew. Tho power 8f tho in
terstate' commerce commission to grant
a Increase of rates on the ground re-
rred to Is Indisputably clear and a
nkJf 1
rr At
(commendation by tho congress with
gard to such a matter might seem to
draw in question the scope of tho com-
Bolwlon' authority or its inclination to
do Justice when there is no reason to
doubt either.
Tho other suggestions the Increase
In tho Interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and In Its facilities
for performing Its mnnlfold duties, tho
provision for full public Investigation
nnd assessment of Industrial disputes,
nnd the grant to the executive of tho
power to control nnd operute tho rail
ways when necessary In tlmo of war
or other like public necessity I now
very earnestly renew.
The necessity for such legislation Is
manifest and pressing. Thoso who have
Intrusted us with tho responsibility
nnd duty of serving nnd safeguarding
them In such matters would find It
bard, I believe, to excuse n failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action
upon them.
Not only does tho Interstate com
merce commission now find It prnctl
cally Impossible, with Its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
Its great functions promptly and thor
oughly, but It Is not unlikely that It
may presently be found advisable to
add to Its duties still others equally
heavy nnd exacting. It must llrst be
perfected ns un administrative Instru
ment. The country cannot nnd should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound Industrial disturbances for
lack of additional means of arbitra
tion nnd conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of tho execu
tive to make Immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
nation wherever they are needed and
whenever they nre needed.
This Is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative elllcleticy
which argii.es Its own case In the mere
statement of It. With regard to one
of Its Items, the Increase In the effi
ciency of the Interstate commerce com
mission, the house of representatives
has already acted; Its action needs
only the concurrence of the senate.
For Control and Operation.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should I
make it, that any tuiln In any occupa
tion should be obliged by law to con
tinue in nn employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass a law which
forbade or prevented the Individual
workman to lenve his work before re
ceiving the approval of society In do
ing p would bo to adopt a new prin
ciple Into our Jurisprudence which I
tnko It for granted we are not prepared
to Introduce. Hut the proposal that
the operation of tho railways of the
country shall not be stopped or Inter
rupted by tho concerted action of or
ganized bodies of men until n public
Investigation shall have been Instituted
which shall make the whole question
at Issue plain for the Judgment of the
opinion of the nation Is not to propose
any such principle. It Is based upon
the very different principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop the In
dustrial processes of the nation, nt any
rate before the nation shall have hud
an opportunity to acquaint Itself with
the merits of tho case as between em
ployee nnd employer, tlmo to form Its
opinion upon an Impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
sider nil practicable means of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I can see nothing in that proposition
but tho Justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessnry processes of
Its very life. There is nothing arbi
trary or unjust In it unless it be arbi
trarily and unjustly done. It can nnd
should be done with a full and scrupu
lous regard for the Interests and liber
ties of all concerned nscwell as for the
permanent Interests of society Itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital importance
awult the action of the senate which
have already been acted upon by tho
house of representatives: tho bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to thoso engaged In pro
moting the foreign commerce of tho
country than is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the laws
against monopoly; tho bill amending
the present organic Inw of Porto Rico ;
and tho bill proposing a more thor
ough and systematic regulation of tho
expenditure of money in elections, com
monly called tho Corrupt Practices Act
I need not labor my advlco that these
measures be enacted Into lnw. Their
urgency lies In tho manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but neces
sary. Even delay would seriously
Jeopard tho Interests of tho country
and of tho government.
Immediate passage of the bill to reg
ulate tho expenditure of money in elec
tions may seem to bo less necessnry
than tho Immediate ennctment of the
other measures to which I refer; be
causo ut least two years will elapse
heforo another election In which fed
eral offices are to bo filled ; but it would
greatly relieve the public mind If this
Important matter wero dealt with
while the circumstances and the dan
gers to tho public morals of the pres
ent method of obtaining and spending
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent observation and tho methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied In
tho light of present experience ; nnd a
delay would have the further very se
rious disadvantage of postponing ac
tion until unothcr election was at hand
and some special object connected with
It might bo thought to bo in tho mind
of those who urged It Action can bo
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
I shnll not argue at length tho desir
ability of giving a freer hand in the
mutter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those who shall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade.
That enterprise will
presently, will immediately assume,
fins Indeed already assumed, n magni
tude unprecedented in otir experience.
Wo hnvo not the necessary Instrumen
talities for its prosecution; it ,1a
deemed to bo doubtful whether 'hey
could be created upon nn adequato
scale under our present laws. We
should clear away all legal obstacles
and create a basis of undoubted law
for it which will glvo freedom without
permitting unregulated license. Th
thing must bo done now, becauso tha
opportunity Is hero nnd may escapo us
If wo hesitate or delay.
Porto Rico's Needs.
Tho argument for tho proposed
amendments of the organic law of Por
to Itlco Is brief nnd conclusive. The
present laws governing tho Island nnd
regulating tho rights and privileges of
Its people are not Just. We have cre
uted expectations of extended privi
lege which wo hnvo not satisfied.
There Is uneasiness among tho peoplo
of the Island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our Intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
tho pending measure would happily re
move. Wo do not doubt what we wish
to do In any essential particular. We
ought to do It at once.
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the two houses of which It Is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
nnd action taken upon them.
Inasmuch as this Is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion I shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth congress, I
hope that you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure and satis
faction I have co-operated with you In
the many mensures of constructive pol
icy with which ydu have enriched tho
legislative annals of the country. It
has been a privilege to labor In such
company. 1 take the liberty of con
gratulating you upon the completion of
a record of rare servlcoubleness and
distinction.
Bound to Make Good.
The well-dressed stranger stepped
Into the drug store nnd, passing by
the boy who usually attended to casual
customers, approached the proprietor,
who was arranging some goods In tho
show case.
"Mr. C , I presume?" he re
marked, pleasantly, and the druggist
turned and bowed gravely. "I hnvo
heard my friend, Mr. Quorn, speak of
you often," said the brisk niun. "Ho
told me if ever I needed anything in
this line to come to you. He spoke of
you us a man on whom one could rely
with perfect confidence, who bad only
the best of evrythlng and with whom
Ifwap always a pleasure to deal."
"Mr. Quorn is very kind," unswercd
tho other, beaming with gratification.
"He Is one of by best customers. What
can I do for you this mornlng7"
Well er this morning, us It hap
pens," said the strungcr, with Just a
little briskness, "this morning I should
like, if you will atlow me, to consult
your directory."
"Certainly," was tho calm reply. "Wo
also have a good selection of one and
two-cent stamps as well as railway
tlmo tables, f you need anything of
that kind."
Franklin Objects Seriously.
Sho Isn't very large, that's true, but
being a county seat, and boasting of
a college, several factories, flour mills,
railways, lnterurbans nnd her lately
acquired Masonic home, Franklin feela
thnt she is not a town to be passed
lightly by, in fact, sho knows her Im
portance, nnd thought that everyone In
the Btato realized It until she was
taken down a bit lately. During tho
big conference of the Methodist
churches held recently in the town a
meeting of tho Indianapolis presbytery
was in session at the same time at
Hopewell, a country church In a pros
perous farming community a few
miles out Ono of tho Presbyterian
delegates, on leaving the train Joined
In tho throng headed for tho Method
ist church. When It came to regis
tering, some of his Inquiries caused
someone to suggest thnt probably he
was In the wrong place, and ho asked
innocently: "Isn't this Hopewell?"
"No, this b Franklin," was the proud
reply. Indlnnapolls News.
Rather Embarrassing.
Irvin Cobb, tho war correspondent
homo from Europe long enough recent
ly to get his breath and look over the
proof sheets of a new book, attended
an authors' banquet In Now York.
A deaf man sat next to Cobb. Far
ther down tho table another man told
a funny story, and when ho finished,
tho deaf man laughed and applauded
louder and. longer than any of the
rest.
"Good old boyl" shouted the deaf
man. "That reminds mo of n story,'.' ho
added to those near by?
"Get up and tell it, Charlie," cried
several. Tho toastmuster sanctioned
the suggestion.
Then the deaf man got up and told
tho same story tho other man had told.
He Was on the Job.
The undertaker arose and said to
the mourners assembled:
"If anyone present wishes to say a
few words of tribute to the deceased,
now Is tho time, when the family will
be glad to hear such."
A stillness prevailed, and after a
fow moments of sllenco It was broken
by a young man, who aroso and
usked :
"Do I understand that no ono wishes
to make any remarks?"
"It would appear bo," replied tho
undertaker.
Then," asked tho young man, as a
light carao into his eyes, "may I be
permitted to make a few remarks
about southern California and its woo-
dwrful climate?"

LESSON FOR DECEMBER 10
FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH.
LESSON TEXT-ltov. 2:1-17.
GOLDEN TEXT-Ho thou faithful unto
donlh, nnd 1 will glvo thoo tho crown ot
llfo.-ltev. 2:10.
This passage most wonderfully illus
trates that dominating purposo of
Paul's life. Moro than most lessons
n map will bo necessary to locate dis
tinctly the places mentioned. There
nre Interesting stories In connection
with each of the seven cities nnd
churches. It might be wise to glvo to
seven different peoplo the task of bring
ing Information to the class regard
ing each one mentioned.
I. Ephesus, whose love Is waning
(vv. 1-7). The key word to theso incu
Kitges Is the word "overcometh." In
each of the messages our Lord de
scribes himself In u different way ac
cording to tho peculiar needs of thnt
pnrtlculur church. Hero ho Is repre
sented us holding tho stnrs (messen
gers of tho churches, Ch. 1 :20) In his
right hand, nnd keeping them secure,
controlling them while he walks In tho
midst of the seven golden lamp stands,
literally churches. Tho symbolism of
"lamp stand" Is used becauso tho
churches wero intended to bo light
licnrcra ns they held forth tho light
given by thu oil of tho Spirit (Math.
5:10; Phil. 2:10; Zecli. 4:2-0). Ephesus
was tho capital of n province said to
bo one of tho richest in the Homun em
pire. In It was tho great templo of
Diana. Here Paul had labored and
had vurlous experiences, und to Ephesus
ho hnd wrltteu n letter (Seo lesson 8,
third quurter), but thero were good
things to bo found in this Epheslun
church (vv. 2,3). Forty years nfter be
ing founded, tfohn writes this message.
He knew their "works," their genurul
moral conduct, especially Its nctlvo nnd
passive sides through Its trials, its
dealing with Impostors nnd its prac
tical energy nnd enterprise ; nnd its pa
tience (literally steadfast assurance)
In bearing witness for Christ Jesus
knew of their never wearying endur
ance. Surely theso things would Indi
cate pretty nearly n model church.
Jesus says, "No, there Is something
seriously wrong," so seriously wrong
that utdess repented of he would re
mote them out of their plucc.
II. Smyrna, the church with a crown
of life (vv. 8-11). Smyrnu wns 40 or 60
miles from Ephesus, nnd at this time
a city of 250,000 Inhabitants. To this
church tho Son of Mun (Ch. 1:11)
sends another message. It 1b interest
ing to note that this church und the
one air Philadelphia received from the
Muster unqualified praise. It had
works, activities; It also hud tribula
tions, riches nnd poverty (for thou art
rich) rich In good works, rich toward
God, rich In treasures laid up In
heaven; however, It was In tho midst
of persecution. It was hero that Poly
carp labored, who afterward, as bishop
of Smyrna, was martyred (seo v. 10).
Of Polycarp It Is Bald that rather than
save his life by renouncing Christ he
cried out, "Eighty and six years have I
served him, and he has done mo no ill ;
how then can I blnsphemo my king
who hath saved me." Tho crown is
eternal life, tho crown of victory. The
second death Is the final condemna
tion which sinners undergo at tho Judg
ment seat of God.
III. Pergamos, the church In strosfl
hold of faith (vv. 12-17). Our glorified
Lord knew that tho church in Pergamos
wus in a peculiarly difficult situation,
that it was Satan's headquarters, his
"throne" (v. 18) ; hence they were In
especial' need of a defender nnd tho
Lord Is represented as "he that hath
n sharp, two-edged sword," tho word
of God (Heb. 4 :12-13 ; John 5 :22). Per
gamos was almost fifty miles north of
Smyrna, a city of about 17,000 lnhabi-'
tunts, and tho capital of the province.
To it wero brought many of tho early
Christians who wero compelled to suf
fer martyrdom. Again wo have a
church whoso works aro commended,
whoso steadfastness Is mentioned in
that they "held fast to my name, and
uot denied tho faith" martyrs (w,
18). However, dangers threatened
them for there had been a compromise
with tho world and with other sys
tems of faith, what wo would call to
day liberality In doctrine and breadth
In view in teaching: (1) Some of their
number had accepted nnd practiced
the doctrine of Baalim (Judo 11 ; Num.
81-10). (2) Theso teachings cast a
stumbling block before the children of
Israel (r. 14). This was done by per
suading tho Israelites to join in tho
Idolatrous feasts and revcllngs of tho
heathen, and also their Impurity of
worflp.
In tho remaining part of the chapter
we have somo glimpses of the remain
ing four churches, the good that wus
to be cherished and tho evil that was
to be overcome.
Perhaps tho most suggcstlvo of all is
that of Laodleca, tho lukewarm
church.
Lukewarmness is ono of tho most
deadly evils to overcome, and henco
tho highest and most glorious of all
the promises suggested ends with "I
will glvo him to sit down with mo In
my throne as I also overcame and sat
down with my father In his throno"
(Am. R. V.).
