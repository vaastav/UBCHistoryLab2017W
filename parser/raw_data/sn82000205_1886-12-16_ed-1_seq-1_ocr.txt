In commenting on the opposition to thu

antagonizing thu Interests of tho people
"What are tho facts In thu case f" ho said,
"Hero Is a school system about which thero
Is no complaint whatever. A number ot
Intel ested parties come forward, organize
a so-called citizens' movement and seek
a change In tho system. T'hoy want twenty
four trustees instead ot nine. What would
bo the result? What Is the experi
ence ot the District with large school
boards? How about the last? Was
not that experience sufllclent?
Now, I do not approve this Mil because I
desire to protect tho present superintendent,
Mr. Powell. On tbo contrary, Investigation
bos shown lo mo conclusively that tho bill
was a mistake. Tlio District Committee
arc, I am sine, acting as they think for tho
lest Interests of tho schools. Tho Commis

Ho said: "We havo completed tho work
wo intended doing tills winter, and our cir

through Ninth to I) street. Along that
lino wo already havo forty business men
who have signified their deslru to use our
heat. Wo havo expended on this work
$50,000, employed 200 men In tho District,
and now, when about to realize something
from our labor aud expended money, wu
aro Informed that we cannot tear up thu
streets to make connection with the build
ings aloHg the route. Can anything bo more
unfair? Tbey Invito progressive men with
an Improvement to luvcst their money lu

and $50,0C0 Is burled in tlio city streets,
coolly Inform us that wo can go no farther;

"Now, tho fact ot tho matter Is that this

tearing up tbu streets comes late. And It
Is not biougbt, as thoso Interested would

Itulwuen Cabinet nnil Konillo,
Tlicro Is not any great need of much
controversy over tho prccedenco which
must bo accorded either tlio Cabinet or
tlio Scnato, for, llko many moro Im
portant ceremonials In our peculiar
social Institutions, It Is entirely regu
lated by circumstances, Last year, M
It may bo well remembered, tho Cabi
net ladles held a caucus, and tho out
come of their deliberations was that,
following tlio old custom, they would
pay tho first call ou the ladles of tho
Senatorial circle and return nil first
calls by card, It look most of them,
with tho multitude of social matters
claiming their time, nearly tho whole
winter to accomplish their first Sena
torial calls.
It Is a well known fact that two
thirds of tho Senatorial families waived
this formality and called themselves
first. It looks like a small matter tn
thoso uninterested, but as ono of tho
Cabinet ladles did tho brunt or the eu
tcrtalnlng last winter, nnd It Is not
good form to ask people to parties with
whom your previous communication
has btcn by llrlstol board, It follows
that It was rather shrowd diplomacy
to walvo tho question of precedence,
and putoncssolf In a position where In
vitations would bo plentifully received.
Ladles who havo been In thu Cabinet
cliclu say that as a mutter of conveni
ence and the promotion of tho friendly
feeling which Is supposed to underlie
our social Intercourse, It would be
wiser If the Scnnle pay first calls on
tho Cabinet. None of the laws aro so
explicit but that they can bo broken
and nro broken dally, but are easily
forgiven when the olfciulers arc those
In high position. Cards have been
piled up nt one olllelal lesldeucu In pir
tlculnr by callers of high and low de
gree for several seasons past, and there
has not yet been sent In return tho mi
nutest acknowledgment.
Ono of tho best features In tho wholo nf.
fair has been tho thoroughly candid way In
which tho subject, though usually forced
on thoso interrogated, has been discussed.
Thu Diplomatic body, that has beeu ac
coiiUd tbu cream ot tho best hospitality,
and which, with a few notable exceptions,
inukca but small return, has come In for Its
share of criticism. As far us precedent
gois, tho secretary of State, who comes
nearest the foreigners In business relations,
Inviitlably presents them on occasions of
ceittnony, such as the Prosldcut's recep
tions, ufter tho Cabinet officers, not as
mere ngtir, oui as a ceuticsy.
A Cabinet lady, one whoso manners are
simply tho perfection of good seuse and
good tnsle, paid tho other day: "Wo aro not
especially wonted over what the Diplo
matic Corps may think of our lino ot prece
dence. I know in my own bouse I never
outrank a homo olllelal hy a lorelgn utpin
mat. 11 1 glvo a dinner, nt which both aro
guests, the foreigner may escort mo to tho
table as a courtesy, but if the Chief-Justice
should be present, ho has thu scat of
honor."
2:1111, it Is claimed that there ought to ho
some established rule whether or not the
Cublntt, even with thu blissful suggestion
ot probublc succession to tho Presidential
chair, cau tako prccedenco of tho Scnato or
Judiciary. No wise uiau will hurry, though,
to foimulate inch a law ot social ethics, tor
if it would gain six or seven adherents, now
In Cabinet elides, who would feel gratified
by thu ranking, there Is no couutlng tho
ci.emles he would make. Personal feeling
and Interest, together with a modicum of
good feme, w 111 legulatu for tbo future, as
It has for thu past, questions of this kind.

Tlio Ilcsiilt of An Iralo I-'athor's Trip

The rather deliberate and cold-bloodod
manner lu which Detective Haft brought
ulout n marriage last Monday morning Is
Interesting. At an early hour on that
morning a tall, aged gentleman,' of refined
apptarar.ee, accompanied by his duugkter,
a bamUc-mc girl of IS years, madu their
way from thu B. uud P. Itailroad station to

wcio lowed down In grief. They had Jour
Lcjtd all thu way from Connecticut in

here against the ctliuo of which tho young

father and daughter went to a certain type
writing agency nnd thu officer culled for tho

wheu Haft asked hhn If he was aware that
theiowas a law in Connecticut against a
certain offense.
At this moment Lo caught sight of tho
young lady and her father, and tbey shook
hands nud tho detective ictlrcd a few stups.
Ho was soon recalled lo Inform them whero
a priest could ba obtained to mairy tho
young couple. Two or thtoe Catholic
churches were visited, but the priests would
not perform tho marrlagu so summarily.
They finally compromised on Dr. Sunder
land, but ho was not homo. They theu
went across tho street and found Dr. Ad
dison, who mado them man and wife. Tho
old man wanted to show his gratltttdo by
bujiug something costly for the officer.
Ho was overjoyed, and wanted to shower
seme ot his wealth on him, but, to his
rbugiln, ho was Informed that a Washing

acncrnl W. T. Sherman has been
prominently Identified with matters af
fecting tho world's history Indepen

olllelal report to tho Government of thu
United Stntes of tho great discovery of
gold In California, which icport at
once electrified tho continent, while
tho subsequent Immunso production of
the precious inctnl in a few years revo
lutionized property values throughout
tho cntlro commercial world, nnd gave
'in unprecedented Impetus to Industries,
enterprises and general prosperity,
THE IIISCOVEIIV Or 001,11.
Gold was discovered In California in tho
spring of ISIS, about sixty miles above the
present city of Sacramento. General Mason
was, at that time, lu command ot the
United States forces In California and acted
as military Governor, with headquarters at
Monterey, the Capital ot thu 'Punitory.
General Sherman, then a young lieutenant
of the Third Artillery, was the adjutant of
General Mason's stall, Verlie lluena, now
tho great city of San Francisco, was then
but a hldo-trodlng port of 403 native In
habitants. As soon as gold was discovered
Captain Sutter went down to Monterey
with a quantity ot samples ot thu precious
metal for the Inspection of thu military
authoilllcs.
(IENE1IAI. SllEll.MAX'S ItECOLLECTIONH.
General Sheiman, In a conversation with

torical event so pregnant with results af
fecting thu wholo world substantl illy us
follows: "Cnptnln Sutter brought Into Gen
eral Mason's oillco soveral small packages
of samples and spread them out beforo us,
Thu specimens presented varied In size from
fish scales aud Bpllt peas up to tho size ot
beans. General Mason asked It I know
how to test whether this stuff was gold or
not. I said certainly, and Immediately
tried my teeth on a lump nnd madu an In
dentation which Impressed mo that it was
malleable. I then sent out for a hammer
and an ax und pounded several pieces out
nat, tins was a cruuo nut practical test,
but wo then applied acids, which verltlod
tho fact that tho samples were genuine gold.
THE OrriCIAI. ttEPOIlT.
"I was at once sent up to tho diggings
and mado a thorough examination ot tho
gold discoveries which were rapidly being
found In new localities and In wonderful
tniounts. I returned to Monterey with a
quantity of specimen samples and drew up
the olllelal report to tho Government,
which was signed by General 'Mason. This
report, accompanied with a quantity of
samples ot gold, was forwarded liy a special
bearer of dispatches, who was no other thau

ernor ot this District ot Columbia. He was
sent off in a small sailing vessel with In

"We had not then been advised of tlio

There Is considerable talk lu pollco cir
cles regarding tho release ou $10,00J ball ot
Walker, who shot Johu C. Miller a week
ago. Prior to tho death of Miller ball was
fixed at $20,000, which was furnished, but
now tho District Attorney consents to a re
di ctlou ot one-half ot tills amount.
Several lawyers conversed with this
morning on tho subject thou -lit that thu
defensohad been very lucky thus far In the
conduct of tho case. Attention was called
to tho Sickles case, which was similar In the
circumstances of shooting, for Geucral
Sickles waited for Philip Barton Key to
come out of tho club houso ou Lafayette
Piece. Application was mado for his re
lease on ball, but the Court denied It, aud
Sickles was sent to jail.

After somo consultation It was decided to
