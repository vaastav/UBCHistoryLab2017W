_ V An Evening Echo.
Country 18 not a mere zone of territory.
Th.e true country is tbe ideal
to which It gives birth; It is the
thought^of love, the sense of comjnunJon.''
which unites in one all sons
of the r territory.?JOSEF# MiAZzini.
- : ?
No -one has beard of the present
Adamsthn Administration's being a
brilliant success. There are Ulcely
to be some radical changes out there
within about three more full moons.:
Some.,of the bridge approaches in]
tlae. suburbs' of the city are pronounced
unsafe and at other ]
bridges,-;there Is no protection to
pedestrians. whatever. Those in]
authority should look after these at;
once, t . i
v 'Negotiations seem well under;
way tor a street car line to North- ]
view. It Is hoped that they will be'
successful. That bustling suburban 1
'town is entitled to easy access to
the city and a street car line to
Northview certainly would start
that place to (booming rapidly.
Harassing Jurors.
It Is reported that criminal court {
furors are being harassed by per-;
sons who make it their particular
business to reprimand jurors after
verdicts have been returned. These i
alleged jbusy-bodles have their own
Ideas as to what should happen to i
men.on trial, and if juries fail to
return verdicts conforming to such1
ideas, the jurors are told by them j
that they did not do their duty.'
There ought to be some way to pro-<
tect men from such insults. reprimands
and harassing who are
commanded by the state to do jury;
duty. They are not there of their i
own lrep will as a usual thing and
most of them would prefer not to doj
Jury duty. Why should they be
made victims of adverse criticism'
because their verdicts do not sult-j
designers and meddlers? The
pracblca is a -peril to justice as
there may be men on juries some- !
times who tbus finding themselves ]
criticized by men who ought to,
know better may be Influenced Ifij
later trials to act to some extent at
least so as to allay such further;
criticism.
. 'Especially. is this true in the.
trials, of colored and foreign-born;
persons. These busy-bodies engender j
class hatred. fTbey should be given
to understand mat jurors are uu
important part of a court and that
persons have no more moral right at
least to approach and reprove them |
tor their verdicts than such persons
or anyone else would have to reprlimand
the trial judge because they
differed from him as to Mai
sentences.
Shopping at Home.
The duty tb do Christmas shopping
early is not nioro imperative
than to do-Christmas shopping and
all other kinds of shopping at home,
if possible. C'.lvlc patriotism Is discredited
every time anyone runs
away from Clarksburg to buy goods
elsewhere. ,
To do shopping at home is a thing
dictated also toy aelf-lnterst: for
there la no' form of bus!ness or
professional life that Is not indirectly
benefited by loyalty to local
tores. The more goods home
merchants sell, the more work
?here Is for every one whose prosperity
depends upon the wealth,
the size and the activity of Clarksburg.
United we stand, divided wo
iali. All for each and each for all

Anti-Trust Records.
>An appendix to President Taft's
message to the ICongreee on the
antl-trnst subject Is of more than
ordinary importance as it Is a concise
review of what the court! and
! various administrations have bees
and are doing under the Sherman
anti-trust law.v.
Beginning with tbe administration
of President Hajr'son, (President
Taft shows that the department of
justice' brought' Seven suits under
that law and won three. {During
the second administration of Grover
i Cleveland the government prose!
cuted eight, suits and won four. Un
! der IMcKinley three suits were instituted
and two- won. "With the!
Roosevelt Administration forty-four
i suits were instituted and the gov-]
[eminent obtained favorable action;
, on twenty-three of them with aev- j
dral pending.
Thus far within the Taft adminls
tration thirty^seven court actions j
have be en. brought under the Sherman
anti-trudt~1aW. Many of them;
are of too - recent date . to be at the.
stage of decree in both the lower and
higher courts, hut there haa ibeen
favorable action In eight or ten
cases and combinations have been
dissolved in several instances. Besides
in* the neighborhood of $200,000
in Ones has been imposed, thei
major portion of Which has been col-!
lected. In
view of this record, it Is not a I
matter of trufTT to say that thej
trusts have not been vigorously;
prosefuted under the anti-trust law.;
especially during the administrations
of former President 'Roosevelt
and .President Taft. Those who
have any conception of court pro-j
cedure at all must confess that the
department of justice has been very
busy and the success attained emphasizes
the vigorous manner employed
in breaking up combinations
and monopolies.
The anti-trust records of # Roose-:
velt and Taft are not to be despised
by any except those in sympathy
with trusts and monopolies.
Away Ahead.
On the score of progressiveness;
.k.ni.nrh ih. Ahnnnp] nf nn alert board
I.** ?V 14^1* IMV v. . .
of trade, Clarksburg has gone away
ahead of most AVest Virginia cities, j
The DIspatctHXewa at Parkersburg
admits this in respect to Parkers-'
burg and refers to that city's posl-;
tion in the premises as a shame and |
a disgrace. The Parkersburg newspaper
also recognizes that there is
much more to be gained through
the united effort of a large number
of business men of a community
than through the efforts of only a'
few and in this both new and old
members of the Clarksburg Board,
of Trade have cause for gratification
and encouragement. ISays the ?.lspatch-Newj:
'
The people of'Huntington, Charleston,
Clarksburg, Morgantown and
Fairmont have rallied magnificently;
to the support of their chambers of
commerce or boards of trade, hundreds
of business men in each town
joiulng Just to help ont~'wlth a}
f membership fee. And yet, the
board of commerce of Parkersburg,
goes plodding along with less than
one hundred paying members, and
: doing as succeasful work for >Par.
kersburg as any. of these richer conj
temporaries have done or are doing
for their respective cities. It is aj
I shame and a disgracl; tho Tarkers
burg board of commerce should
[have-a memberslflp of 1.000, and
<every application to.belong should
ibe accompanied by d check dor a
year's dues.

F The Pittsburg (Dispatdb declares
'such a course would be humane,
I Just and creditable, and comments
I thereon as follows: ' ' ?

"Mamma, what's a seal?" asked
eight-year-old Mary, looking up from
the paper, whose black headlines she;
was laboriously deciphering. .
"A seal is a little animal that lives !
in the ocean. We use its fur for coats
and wraps." was the enlightening an- ;
dwer of the parent.
Mary puckered her brow. for.some j
-minutes. and again interrogated. J
"Mamma, will seals stop plagues?" f
referring perhaps to same of the ;
Biblical narratives she had heard told
in Sunday -school.
"Stop plagues! Why. child, what
are you talking about?" cried the
mother In amazement.'
"Why here it , says, 'Red Cross
Seals Stop White Plague," triumph- j
antty holding up the paper.
Then mamma explained to her lit- i
tie girl that the Red Cross Seal Js a
tiny' stamp-Iiko sticker which - Is j
placed on the back of letters and i
packages coming from Santa Claus i
and others. Every seal costs a .penny.;
and every penny goes to fight and '
cure" consumption, which Is the -real
name of the white plague, and which .
is an awful sickness. Mamnia told
her of u little girl in their own neighborhood
who hnd consumption, but
who was given a chance to get well
because the people had bought Bed
Cross Seals.
Mary listened attentively, and finally'to'uched
by the closeness of the op- i
peal,, said, "Mamma. I think I'd
rather have some of those seals than '
a new dolly."
