one of the most delightful drives
out of Pgdfti would btj alone a high
way through the upi&nda at the
south end of this city, and on over
the bench to a connection with the
Uncoil, highway, Bj extending Wasb
ington avenue direct!; south three or
tour miles, the most beautiful scenery
would be brought to the view of ;hose
traveling the road. The highway has
suiticient elevation to bring Into the
pmorama of mountain and valley, all
of Ogden and, far I the west, the
shimmering surface of Great Sal?
Lake. That picture of a city iu its
building, with most picturesque en-j
v'rnnmtni, would be of inestimable
value to Ogden as an advertisement,
if, during the coming year, when
thousands arc to travel bv automobile

A group or our most prorainen. busi

pective boulevard and pass judgment
on it, and, if they br impressed, the '
road should be constructed without
delay.
I MEXICANS CONTINUE TO
SHOOT AMERICANS
President Woodrov. Wilson made
no reference In his message of Tues
la to the withdrawal of American
troops from Vera Cruz. The head of
the nation made no reference to the
problems in Mexico. Has Mr. Wilaon
wearied of watchful waiting and
reached the conclusion that the whole
Mexico embroglio is something be
yond his understanding?
On April 9, 1914, an officer and
men from the Dolphin were arrested
at Tair.plco by Mexicans. The next
day Admiral Mayo demanded an
apology salute of 21 guns, which was
refused by Huerta On April 14, the
entire Atlantic fleet tailed for Mex
ican waters. Then President Wilson

asked congress for authority to use
armed forces, and next day American
troops landed and begun fighting at
Vera Cruz. Then General Fuueton
.id army regulars arrived on the
scene and remained until November
2" when Vera Crui was evacuated.
So far the 21 gnns have not been
fired and today no greater respect
exists for the United Stales than
when Huerta defied this government.
H present the warring forces are
engaged In the amusing pastime of
firing across the border at Naco, kill
ing Americans and laughing at our
threats to put n stop to this disre
sped For American rights.
When will the President of the
United States wake up to the fact
:hot to deal successfully with the
Mexican a strong hand must be used
and every warning must be translated
Into strenuous action''
SINKING OF THE SQUADRON
OF ADMIRAL VON SPEE.
On November 1, a German squadron
made up of the Scharnhorat, Qnel
senau, Lelpzie. Nurnberp and Dresden,
fought a battle off tho ooaat nf Chile,
in which the British cruisers Good
Hope and Monmouth were sunk and
the Glasgow was injured, with n loss
of 1500 men. That German naval vlo
tory evidently stirred Admiral Fisher
of the British fleet, and caused to
he sent to South Atlantic waters a
very powerful squadron. Not only
were ships directed to the south, but
i squadron made for the Atlantic 'n
tranee to the Panama canal and was
dp watch at that point when the Ger
man raiders were sighted off ' the
Falkland Island on the morning of
December S. t the same time n
Rritich-Japanese squadron was moving
Jown the coast of Chili There was
10 escape for the ships under Admiral
on Spee
That the loss of the Good Hope
and Monmouth stung the British naval
men is shown by the sweeping cam
paign which they inaugurated in order
to avenge the death of Admiral Chris
topher Cradock and his men
The death knell for Admiral Von
Spee was sounded off the Falkland
Islands, 300 miles to the northeast of
the Straits of Magellan. The Ger
man ships had traveled about 2000
miles since the engagement five
Weeks ago. Part of that time must
have been spent In the German ren
dezvous at Juan Fernandez the
island nf Alexander Selkirk, the
Scotch 9ailor who was shipwrecked
and remained four years before being
rescued Had they made greater
speed, the British fleet from the home
waters might not have intercepted
them What the plans of Admiral
Von Spec were are not disclosed He
may have been on his way to break
through the British - patrol which has
the German fleet bottled up. although
this would be a most desperate un
dertaking The Indications are that
he aimed to either menace British
shipping along the Atlantic coast of
South America or, proceeding to the
east, was once more to enter the In
dian Ocean.
Either an overwhelming British
squadron was brought into action or
the British displayed the same re
markable skill as was shown by the
Germans in the naval conflict off
Chile. With a loss of only three men
killed, Admiral Von Spee and 1800
men were sent to the bottom Our
guess is that Vice Admiral Sir Fred
erick Sturdee had one or more of Eng
land's mighty battleships of the
Dreadnought type, which outranged
and destroyed the Schnrnhorst and
Grheisenau before those cruisers could
do any damage. As a naval achieve
ment, a victory of that nature would
count as nothing in determining the
relative merits 0f the two warring for
ces mnn for man and gun for gun.
and yet this Is n most important tri
umph for the allies, as it almost com
pletely clears the seas of German
armed ships, the only cruiser still
unaccounted for being the Karlsruhe.
l;;st reported off the coast of Brazil,
busily engaged in capturing English
merchantmen.

WHAT WAR INFLICTS
ON A PEOPLE.
Answering Rernhardi. the German
advocate of war ss a biological neces
sity, Dr. .1 A Macdonald In the
G.ohe of Toronto. Canada, declares:
"Never since the days of the Stu
arts has Scotland, and especially the
Scottish Highlands, been free from
the toll taken bj the recruiting ser
geants for Britain's army. The his
tory o. the Celts is. In one sentence:
''Forever they went out to battle,
and forever they fell." The clan fol

TO STOP FIGHTING FOR
TWENTY DAYS.
Senator Kenjon has introduced a
resolution in eor.pxess, calling on the
warrinr, nation?, in the name of the
congress of the United States, to de
Clare a twenty-day tnio"1 during the
Christmas period.
A n; nst commendable appeal, but
one certain to moel sith rejection.
The allies could nell afford to
giant a twenty-day truce, during
which lime the trpt ches would be
evacuated and the aitillery cease to
crah. but with Germany time is ev
erything. Everv day's delay helps
spell Germany's defeat.
But what a pleasing diversion it
would be for the soldlen at the front
if they could go bono to loved onet
at Christmas' We wonder what
would happen If the men from tlw
contending armies vcre allowed to
fraternize during the lull in the battl"

they were seeking the blood of each
other, while their l;un!lles so sorely
were in need of their helping hands?

KAISER'S ILLNESS.
(Salt Lakp Tribune )
The illness of Emperor William will
win lor him widespread sympathy out
side the nations now at war. The
Htraln of the mighty conflict is prov
ing too great for a monarch whose
health never has been robust All
his intellectual and physiqlal energies
have been exercised to the utmost
since he took upon himself responsi
bilit for beginning the world's mott
terrible war
The very fact that his Imperial pow
er was so vast in deciding the ques
tion of peace or war has placed upon
him a responsibility such as no mon
arch ever before sustained. As a
Christian monarch he realizes that
hi part in the war is a question of
conscience Even if he thoroughly
satisfied his conscience at the outset
his soul cannot but be torn bv hor
ror and doubt at times when he looks
out unon the battlefields of France
and Poland and sees the thousands
and hundreds oi thousands of killed
and wounded. Such scenes meant
little to that prince of skeptic?. Fred
erick the Great, who conducted wars
of aggression with cheerful disregard
for human rights or the particular
righis of nations. The present Ho
henzollern emperor is of a differenc
m"ti!.j. He has been noted for his
personal efforts in behalf of peace,
for a sincere religious spirit and for
a somewhat genial and kindly na
ture. To such a man the war must
necessarily be an excruciating experi
ence. Moreover, he feels a sense of
overwhelming responsibility to his
Buhjerts. He hai told them that the
wnr is righteous, that the sword was
forced into his hand, and that Ger
many is fighting for her national ex
istence. Having given his subjects
this assurance of good faith, ho feels
that he must leave nothing undone
to help them win the war. The con
sequence has been that he has taken
upon himself a general supervision of
the campaigns in the east and the
west Ur has passed from France
to Russia and from Russia to France
in his special train every few days.
He has Investigated all branches of
the military service; he has been
untiring in his efforts to see that the
soldiers were well fed and well
clothed; he has taken keen Interest
in the torturing questions of strategy
and he has experienced the pain and
depression of seeing his most splen
did plans turn awry and often fail ut
terly. Small wonder, then, that this re
markable ruler should have broken
down under the strain. If he were
the Gothic superman, of whom the
modern German philosophers delight
to talk, he might have borne the re
sponsibility v'ith the composure of a,
god. Unfortunately there Is no such
thing as a superman, and even so
great a monarch as the present emper
or of Germany must sink under a
v. eleht too heavy for any human flesh
The cold and cruel Napoleon might
have endured the stress bettor, but
he was a sort of aventurer. and never
felt the moral responsibility to his
people that is felt by Emperor Will-lam.

WORLD'S MARKETS
New York, Dec. 10. Out of ten dif
ferent bond issues traded in during
the opening ten minutes of today's
market, the only two showing any
change whatever were St. Paul con
vertibles and American Tolephoue
convertible 4 l-2s, which gained slight
fractions.
All the early transactions were in
small lota, with the exception of
Cnlted States Steel 5's in which a
block of $21,000, face value, changed ,
hands. (
The chief feature of the afternoon
bond market was Its irregularity with
a similar undertone In stocks. New

CHICAGO GRAIN
Chicago. Dec. 10 Wheat suffered
a material decline in price today
largely a3 a result of the British vic
tory in the south Atlantic, removing
most, if not all danger of German
interference with expected big Argen
tine shipments to Liverpool Com
jaratively steady cable quotations,
lowever, and reports that frost had
caused serious crop damage in Ar
gentina led to some hesitancy here
at the start. There were also advices
that Emperor William's condition
had improved. After opening l-81-4c
lower to 18c higher, the market ral
lied a little, but then slid downgrade.
Con. developed strength owing to
rough weather that diminished re- J
ceipts. Demand though was not of
an urgent character. The opening
which varied from a shade off to a . ;
like advance, was followed by a mod
erate general advance.
Shorts and exporters buying stead
ied the oats market. Trade, as a
whole, however, lacked volume.
Lower prices for hogs weakened
provisions. Buyers were acarce.
The wheat market became oversold
on baseless rumors that Emperor Wil
liam was do id. A rebound followed
that wiped out all tho decline. The
close was unsettled l-8l-4 to 3-8o
above last night.
Inquiry from exporters tended later
to harden corn quotations. The close
was steady at l-43-8 to 3-8c net ad
vance. Chicago, Dec. 1. Wheat, 2 red,
