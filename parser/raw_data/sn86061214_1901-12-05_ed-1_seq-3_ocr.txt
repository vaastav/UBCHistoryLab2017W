:. Opening Session of Both Branches of
Congress.
Washington, Dec. 3—In anticipation
of the receipt of the first message of
•i" President Roosevelt, members of the
Senate and House assembled early de
•.$ spite the cold, penetrating rain. The
si galleries were well filled with interest
ed spectators.
yf. At 12 o'clock Speaker 'Henderson
called the House to order. After the
j* journal was read and approved, Coop
er, of Texas, and Wood, of California,
who were not present yesterday, were
sworn in. On motion of Payne, of

its duty and the President said he
would at once communicate with the
two houses in writing.
Two minutes later Major Pruden ap-

"The American people are slow to
wrath, but when that wrath is once
kindled it burns like a consuming
flame," there was a burst of demon
stration.
Deep Attention on Trust Paragraph.
Probably no other portion of the
message attracted so much attention
as that relating to trusts. No demon
stration was evoked "by the reading
of this portion of the message, but the
recommendation for the re-enactment
of the Chinese exclusion law drew ap
plause from both sides 5f the house.
The reading of the message was con
