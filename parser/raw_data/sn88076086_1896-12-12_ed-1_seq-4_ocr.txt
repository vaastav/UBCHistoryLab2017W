SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1896.
FRED FALLEY, editor of tbe Wahpe
ton Globe and Secretary ot State elect,
Was married on Thanksgiving day.
THE CoufiANT congratulates Fred.
WELL, Bro. Tuttle, you of The Man
dan Pioneer, better let up on the Kent
case. The thing's done and you can't
undo it—and we don't believe you
would if you could.
CONGRESS met Monday and now we
Will have the usual grind until the 4th
of March when the new regime will
take charge of affairs and turn on the
wheels of prosperity. President Cleve
land delivered his farewell message—
It very able document. His treatment
of the Cuban question was statesman
like, and thoroughly American. He is
receiving deserved encomiums on
every hand.
THE Grand Forks Plaindealer Is still
aimlessly pawing the air, seeming ob
livious of the fact that it has the medal
for being tbe Ananias of thePopocratic
press of the State. Really now, we
Wonder if the P. D. actually thinks
that any one pays any attention what
ever to any of its wild braying! Come
off, Caruth, and quit expressing 3'our
selt We had too much of that during
the campaign, and all have come to
believe that you couldn't hit the truth
if jou really tried hard
Iw tbe contest over the office of
Hegister of Deeds of Pembina County,
the Hon. N. C. Young, of Bathgate, is
attorney for A. H. Johnson, Republi
can, of Drayton, in his contest against
JL M. Chisholm, fusioniBt. The returns
•bow Chisholm to have a plurality of
4jdout 70. One point in the case is of
interest, as it involves the legality of
the election of almost every fusionist
In the State. The point is, briefly, that
Mr. Chisholm was nominated by a
Democratic convention and his name
placed in the Democratic column on
the ballot. He was also nominated by"
an Independent convention, and his
name was placed in the Independent
column. He received a number of
votes as a Democrat he also received
votes as an Independent. The judges
©f election then, without authority,
combined the two votes which gave
him a majority. Mr. Young claims
that this is illegal, and that if Mr.
Chisholm is elected it must be as either
Democrat or an Independent, but not
as both. The case will probably go to
the Supreme Court.
THE Grand Forks Herald, The Grand
Forks News, The Fargo Argus, The
Fargo Forum and some of the lesser
fights of the Republican press, are en
gaged in making a United States Sena
tor (on paper), without any regard to
the incoming sc-ssion ot the Legisla
ture, the rights of the members there
of, or their opinions in the premises.
I'o is all well enough to discuss the
merits of candidates at the proper
lime, but all this hue and cry now, and
tbe starting of an excitement at this
incipient stage, augurs no good for the
Republican party. Feelings of bitter
ness axe being engendered that will
have its effect when the time comes for
*ution that bodes no good to tbe suc
cess of Republicanism. Members elect
to the Legislature are being flooded
With these publications and an attempt
made to "influence" them in their ac
tion as legislators for this or that in
dividual. North Dakota has plenty of
good timber for a United Slates Sena
tor and we have faith enough in the
Republicanism of the members elect of
the Legislature to use some of it in
filling the place in tbe Senate. At the
proper time and in the proper way
THE COURANT will shy its castor in
tbe ring.

THE WATERS RECEDE.
ft'vsr
at Chippewa Falls Has Dropped
More Than Four FMt.
CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis., Dec. 8.—
True to its past traits the Chippeva
rose 10 inches during the night, but be
gan its downward course at daylight.
At 6 p. m. the water is gone six inches
lower than at any time since the flood.
A fall of 51 inches is indicated. Tbe
universal opinion is that the worct has
been met and a feeling of security is
once more settling over the city.
Should the weather remain at all mod
erate it is thought the ice gorge be
tween this city and Eau Claire will' be
rapidly eaten away by the strong our
rent which prevails between these
points. The Wisconsin Central has a
force of men at work chopping its
tracks and depots on River street out of
the ice and generally repairing their
damage. The Milwaukee people are
doing likewise, while the inundated
buildings and sidewalks are being
Cleared of Tbelr Weight of Ic*.
Street Commissioner Ackley proposes
to begin with men and teams at once to
remove the ice from the flooded streets.
Many of the merchants who were
driven out by the flood are getting
back into their old stands, the sight
seers are migrating, electric lights once
more illuminate the benighted streets
of a once threatened city, and there is
every sign that we are to be spared a
time longer. Monday the city was full
of sightseers from St. Paul, Minneapo
lis, Milwaukee and, in fact, from every
other place along the several lines of
railroads entering the city. The Cen
tral had an excursion from Medford
and intermediate points for this pur
pose alone. Railroad trafilo is resumed.
The reports in certain papers that gen
eral distress and suffering reigns as a
result of the flood is absolutely untrue
and on a par with the many other reck
less dispatches published with reference
to the high water here.
A RIVAL OF CARNEGIE.
Rockefeller aid the Standard Oil Com
pany Going? Into Steel BniineM.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7.—A morning news­
paper makes the following announce
ment
John D. Rockefeller is seeking to out
do Andrew Carnegie as the iron king,
and has plans already matured and
about to be carried out aiming at that
end. The Standard Oil company, di
rected by Rockefeller, will be the foe of
the Scotchman. The company has pur
chased in South Chicago along the
shore of Lake Michigan and at the
mouth of the Calumet river a plot of
ground several acres in extent and with
a water frontage of 3,200 feet. On this
it is said roller mills will be erected to
cost $10,000,000, possibly twice
that amount. With this plant for man
ufacture, with the
Vut Mines In the Mesaba Region
for the raw product, and with 18 huge
lake vessels to carry the ore to the very
doors of the works—all owned by the
Rockefeller company—that corporation
may be able to dictate terms to Mr.
Carnegie and his associates instead of
being dictated to.
The new mills at South Chicago will
not be confined to the manufacture of
steel rails but will make structural iron
of all sorts as well. It is stated fur
ther and on good authority that Mr.
Rockefeller may even go into the armor
plate business also. The site of the
new works is ideal for a mammoth roll
ing mill.
Mr. Horr Will Recover.
PLAINFIELD, N. J., Dec. 7.—The
condition of ex-Congressman Roswell
G. Horr is much improved. No com

Board of Canvatsera of South Dakota Fa
to Decide oa Electors.
PIERRE, S. D., Dec. 7.-At the after*
hoon meeting of the state canvassers
the board canvassed the returns from
Lincoln county, but declared there
were no returns from Lawrence and
Butte counties and unorganized coun
ties attached to Butte and adjourned to
Dec. 17, in which time the secretary of
state is instructed to secure duly certi
fied returns from those counties bear
ing the required seal of the auditor.
The canvassing board on national offi
cers was called to order at 9 a. m. All
returns were accepted and counted with
the exception of the votes of Lawrence
and Butte counties, and the unorgan
ized counties attached to Butte, which
the board refused to count and decided
to send the secretary of state as a mes
senger to the counties named for prop
erly authenticated returns of these
counties. The governor, in a statement
of the matter, said that while there is
no provision for securing corrected re
turns there is
No Lav to Prevent Such Acilon,
and the board had decided to take such
action that all parties who have a ma
jority of the votes will receive certifi
cates. Mr. Stewart, for the Republican
candidates, demanded on resolution
that the candidate shown to have a
majority of votes now received be
given a certificate. Just what, if any,
legal moves will be made by either side
is yet an open question. Application
for mandamus by both sides to compel
the board to issue certificates are ru
mored, but there is nothing positive
yet.
The total vote, including the coun
ties thrown out by the board, gave
Bryan 41,224, McKinley 41,022. By de
ducting the vote of Lawrence, Butte
and the unorganized counties, which
was temporarily thrown out by the can
vassing board, the result is reversed.
The vote of these counties was: Mc
Kinley 2,769, Bryan 3,559, which leaves
the totals, McKinley 88,258, Bryan 87,
665, a plurality of 588 for McKinley.

MILWAUKEE, Dec. 8. —Positive proof

No deaths have occurred as a result of
the foul deed, but nearly 200 people's
