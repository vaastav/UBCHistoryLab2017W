"I RECOMMEND THAT INDIAN TERRITORY AND OKLAHO
MA BE ADMITTED AS ONE STATE. THERE IS NO OBLIGA
TION UPON US TO TREAT TERRITORIAL SUBDIVISIONS,
WHICH ARE MATTERS OF CONVENIENCE ONLY, AS BIND
ING. US ON THE QUESTION OF ADMISSION TO STATEHOOD.
NOTHING HAS TAKEN UP MORE TIME IN CONGRESS DUR
ING THE PAST FEW YEARS THAN THE QUESTION AS TO
THE STATEHOOD TO BE GRANTED TO THE FOUR TERRI
TORIES ABOVE MENTIONED, AND' AFTER CAREFUL CONSID
ERATION OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE DIS
CUSSIONS OF THE QUESTION I RECOMMEND THAT THEY
BE IMMEDIATELY ADMITTED AS TWO STATES. THERE IS
NO JUSTIFICATION FOR FURTHER DELAY; AND THE ADVIS
ABILITY OF MAKING THE FOUR TERRITORIES INTO TWO
STATES HAS BEEN CLEARLY ESTABLISHED.
"IN SOME OF THE TERRITORIES THE LEGISLATIVE AS
SEMBLIES ISSUE LICENSES FOR GAMBLING. THE CON
GRESS SHOULD BY LAW FORBID THIS PRACTICE, THE
HARMFUL RESULTS OF WHICH ARE OBVIOUS AT A
GLANCE.
Washington, D. C. Dec. 5. Presi
dent Rooseveit was notified at eleven

consisting" of Senators Allison and
Morgan and representatives McClea
fy, .Littauer and Williams, that con

cation at the convening of congress,
and requested the committee to pre
sent his compliments to the two
branches and to say that he would
communicate with them at once In
writing.
' The President's message was read
soon after the convening of the sen
ate. There was an exceptionally
large attendance of senators, and the
most of them followed closely the
reading of the message by Secretary
Bennett and his assistants.
The reading of ths President's mes
sage in the House; began at 1:25.
Printed copies- of the message were
at once distributed to members, and
the reading was followed with atten
tive interest.
Representative Hepburn, of Iowa,
will at the conclusion of reading the
President's message: ask unanimous
consent of the House for considera
tion of the emergency Panama Canal
appropriation tomorrow. This pro
gram has been agreed upon by the
Republican leaders.'
;
President's Message. In Part.
To the Senate and House of Rep
resentatives: ,
The people of this country contin
ue to enjoy great prosperity. Un
doubtedly there' will be ebb and flow
In such prosperity,! and this ebb and
flow will be-felt more or-less by all
members of the community, both by
th deserving and1 the undeserving.
Against, the wrath of the Lord the
wisdom of man can not avail; in
times of flood or ;drought human in
genuity can but partially repair the
disaster. A general failure of crops
would hurt all of; us. Again, if the
folly of man maws the general well
being, then thos5 who are innocent
of the folly will tiave to pay part of
the penalty incurred by those who
are guilty of folly. A panic brought
on by the speculative folly of part of
the business community would hurt
the whole business community. But
such stoppage (Of welfare, though it
might be severe, would not be last
ing. In the long run the one vital
factdr In the permanent prosperity
of the country is the high individual
character of the average American
worker, the average American citi
zen, no matter ; whether his work be
mental or manual, whether he be farm
er or wage-worker, buiness man or
professional man.
In our Industrial and social system
the Interests of; all men are bo close
ly intertwined jthat In the Immense
majority, of cases a straightdealing
man who by 'his efficiency, by his in
genuity and Industry, benefits himself
must also benefit others, wormauy
the man of gre.t productive capacity
who becomes rich by guiding the la
bor of many other men does so by en
abllng them to - produce more than
they could produce without his guid
ance; and both; he and they share the
benefit, which comes also to the pub
lic at large. The superficial fact that
never blind, ua -to the underlying fact
of Congress.- Stands Pat
Would Prohibit Campaign
terblind us to the underlying fact
that there is this sharing, and that the
benefit comes in some degree to each
man concerned. Normally the wage
worker, the man of small means, and
the average consumer, as well as the
average producer, are all alike helped
by making conditions such that the
man of exceptional business ability
receives an exceptional reward for
his ability. Something can be done
by legislation to help the general pros
perity; but no such help of a perma
nently beneficial character can be giv
en to the less able and less fortunate
save as the results of a policy which
shall inure to the advantage of all in
dustrious and efficient people who
act decently; and this is only anoth
er way of saying than any benefit
which comes to the less able and less
fortunate must of necessity come ev
en more to the more abie and more
fortunate. If, therefore, the less for
tunate man is moved by envy of his
more fortunate brother to strike the
conditions under which they have
both, though unequally, prospered, the
result will assuredly be that while
damage may come to the one struck
at, it will visit with an even heavier
load the one who strikes the blow.
Taken as a whole we must al! go up
or down together.
Corporations.
Yet, while not merely admitting,
but-insisting upon this, it is also true
that where there is no governmental
restraint or supervision some of the
exceptional men use their energies
not in ways that are for the common
good, but in ways which tell against
this common good. The fortunes
amassed through corporate organiza
tion are now so large, and vest such
power in those that wield them, as to
make it a matter of necessity to give
to the soverign that is, to the Gov
ernment, which represents the people
as a whole some effective power of
supervision over their corporate use.
In order to insure a healthy social
and industrial life, every big corpora
tion should be held responsible by,
and be accountable- to, some sover
eign strong enough to control its con
duct. I am in no sense-hostile to cor
porations. This is an age of combi
nations, and any effort to prevent all
combination will be not only useless,
but in the end vicious, because of the
contempt for law which the failure
to enforce law inevitably produces.
We should, moreover, recognize in
cordial and ample fashion the im
mense good effected by corporate
agencies in a country such as ours,
and the wealth of Intellect,, energy,
and fidelity devoted to their service,
and therefore normally to the service
of the public, by their officers and di
rectors. The corporation has come to
stay, just as the trade union has come
to stay. Each can do and has done
great good. Each should be favored
so long as it does " good. " But each
should be sharply checked where it
acts against law and justice.
So long as the finances of the Na
tion are kept upon an honest basis
no other question of internal economy
with which the Congress has power
to deal begins to approach in impor
tance the matter, of endeavoring to
secure proper Industrial conditions
under which the individuals and es
pecially the great corporations do
ing an Interstate business are to act.
The makers of our National Constitu
tion provided .especially that the re
gulation of "interstate commerce
should come within the sphere of the
General Government. The arguments
in favor of their taking thi3 stand
were even then overwhelming. Bat
they are far stronger to-day, in view
of the enormous development of
great business agencies, usually cor
porate in form. Experience has
shown conclusively that it is useless
to try to get any adequate regulation
and supervision of these great car-
porations by State action. .Such reg
ulation and supervision can only be
effectively exercised by a sovereign
whose jurisdiction is coextensive with
the field of work of the corporations
that is. by the National Govern
ment. I believe that this regulation
and supervision can be obtained by
the enactment of law by Congress.
If this proves impossible, it will cer
tainly be necessary ultimately to con
fer in fullest form such power upon
the National Government by a pro
per amendment of the Constitution
It would obviously be unwise to en
deavor to secure such an amendment
until it is certain that the result can
not be obtained under the Constitu
tion as it now is. The law of the Con
gress and of the several States hith
erto, as passed upon by tne couns
have resulted more often in showing
that the States have no power in the
matter than that the National Gov
ernment has power; so that there at
present exists a very unfortunate con
dition of things, under which these
great corporations doing an interstate
business occupy the position of sub
jects without a sovereign, neither any
State government nor the National
Government having effective control
over them. Our steady aim should
be by legislation cautiously and fare
fully undertaken, but resolutely per
serveii in. to assert the sovereignty
of the National Government by afir-
mative action.
The first consideration to be kept
in mind is that the power should be
affirmative and should be given to
some administrative body created by
the Coneress. If given to the present
Interstate Commerce Commission or
to a recognized rnterstate Commerce
Commission, such commission should
he made uneauivocally administrative
I do not believe in the Government
interfering with private business
more than is necessary. 1 do not De
lieve in the Government undertak
ing any work which can with proprie
ty be left in private hands. But nei
her do I believe in the Government
flinching from overseeing any work
whea it becomes evident that aDuses
ire sure to obtain therein unless
there is, governmental supervision. It
's not mv Drovince to indicate the
exact terms of the law which should
be enacted: but I call the attention
of the Congress to certain existing
conditions with which it is desirable
to deal. In my judgment the most
Important provision which such law
hould contain is that conrernng up
on some competent administrative
body the power to decide, upon the
case beina: brought before it, wnetn-
er a given rate prescribed by a rail
road is reasonable and just, and if : it
is found to be unreasonable and un
just, then, after full investigation of
the complaint, to prescribe the limit
of rate beyond which it shall not be
lawful to go the maximum reason
able rate, as it is commonly called
this decision to go into effect within
a reasonable time and to obtain from
thence onward, subject to review by
he courts. It sometimes happens at
present, not that a rate is too high
but that a 'favored shipper is given
too low a rate. In such case the Com
mission, would have the right to fix
this already established minimum
rate as the maximum; and it would
need only one or two such decisions
by the Commission to cure railroad
companies of the practice of giving
improper minimum rates. I call your
attention, to the fact that my propo
sal is not to give the Commission pow
er to initiate or originate rates gener
ally, but to regulate a rate already
fixed or originated by the roads, up
on complaint and after investigation.
A heavy penalty should be exacted
from any corporation which fails to
respect and order of the Commission.
I regard this power to establish a
maximum rate as being essential to
any scheme of real reform in the mat
ter of railway regulation. The first
necessity is to secure it; and unless
it is granted to the Commission there
is littlle use of touching the subject
t all. -
"Illegal transactions often occur un
der the forms of law: It has often
occurred that a shipper has been told
bya traffic officer to buy a large
quantity of some commodity and then
after it has been bought an open re
duction Is made in the rate to take
effect immediately, the arrangement
resulting to the profit of the one ship
per and the one railroad and to the
damage of- all the competitors; for
it must not be forgotten that the big
shippers are at least as much to
blame as any railroad in the matter
of rebates. The "law should make it
clear so that- nobody can. fail to un
derstand that any kind of commis
sion paid on freight shipments, wheth
er in this form or in the form of fic

Pull the Drop.
Elk River, Minn., Dec. 5. C. D.
Crawford, who was convicted of the
murder of Heine Lunden in a box
car near here on Nov. 20, 1904, was

River, collapsed and was unable to
pull the drop. Sheriff Bernick. of St.
Cloud then pulled the drop and Craw
ford was hanged. Thirty persons wit
nessed the hanging, but no one rep
resented Crawford, not even his at

was a violation of the law.

subject, and the Sultan is said to be
awaiting unanimity on the part of
the ministers before sanctioning
their action.
