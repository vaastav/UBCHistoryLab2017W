Winter, seems to have begun business at

derangements of the throat and lungs, as
Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral. Tills wonderful '
medicine affords great relief i i consumption i

brilliant and entertaining satire under the
title of‘‘Mrs. Harold Stagg.” The story is j
told with tlie amusing and quiet cleverness
wliieh h-'.s made the auhor’s reputation, and
cniiiains many striking ideas which will cause '
Society's backbone to creep. Like “The An
gloniamaes,’ it places its heroine under a

iug hist, in the presence of a large eongrega- :

access to the auditorium, and stood without
during the long service.
The Kidder Church is a historic spot to the j
Reformed and Lutheran Churches of this
county. A hundred and twenty-six years j
ago congregations of these denominations
were organized and erected a small log
structure, in which they worshipped alter
incly until 180f>, when it became too small to
accommodate, the increasing membership,
mid u larger buck building was erected, in
which the union still continued until about
a year ago. It then became neiesßarry to
rebuild, and the people who held the church
conjointly determined each to erect a place
of worship. Both are completed, and it was
the Reformed which was dedicated. — West

VVhat Does This Mean?-Mr. Oliver j
Morrison is our authority for the following : !
Some time recently Peter Gerhart, tenant on
Morrisons farm at the “Old Factory’' post
ed notices on tlie place warning hunt- j
er.-t not to tresspass thereon. One day re- j
centlv Gerhart found a placard on the post,
or. which was a threat of some kind, to be
carried out in event that the trespass notices
were not removed within a certain limit of
lime. Several days ago a reaper in one of
the fields was set on fire and burned, and Mr. |
Morrison looks upon this as a carrying out, of
tin; threat.. Tlie story as told to us is too
vague for an intelligent report, but novel I he- 1
less, he is considerably agitated oyer the
matter. Howe er it is well enough for the
person or persons who put up the notice to
know that even if it was done in a Joking
manner, they are trifling with what may ;
prove a serious matter. As regards the
burning of the reaper, Mr. Morrison says that ,
really did occur, but tic failed to say why
the reaper was in the field. 1 f the grain crop
b ready to harvest out there at lids season,
can it lie called early or late? Perhaps they
will tie the -h avis with icicles.— Cluuni

The President** Message,
What the Press of the Country Thinks
of it.
Washi nylon Poet-. The message ns a whole
is to he commended for its tone and temper.
Those who were expecting from the president
a wail of despair over the recent political
reverses of his parly or a frantic appeal for
help in ludiilf of a Union endangered by
Democratic success, will find themselves dis
appointed. Tlie President takes a serene
and hopeful view .if the situation.
Philii. Press: The message throughout
m lint das with earnestness an I hroa i judg
men I. the policy and principles upon which
the Administration came into power. What
has been don ; was ia pursuance of that poli
cy, and because it was elected on a platform
r -ipiiring it to do those very things. The
President's courageous and dignified adher
cnee 11 that course will eommati! the risped
mid cordial support of Ins parly throughout
the c-unity.
Thila I.cdyrr: Those who read it cure- |
fully can hardly fail to award it the credit of j
In ing a plain dispassionate and business like ,
document ; unless Huy are itu-linej to be :
b yperei itieal.
X. Y. Herald: Mr. Hat risou is an lion, si >
man; but a thorough partisan. We have!
never questioned his motives or his integrity
..illy Ids judgment. This last work of Ids -
pen will add nothing to his reputation, and
there is no reason why it should. It is cau
tious t-i the verge of timidity, and therefore '
inconclusive. The message is tediously long j
hut perhaps that mav lie ailrinui.-d to the
f.ci that tlie writer had very little to say.
X. 7 San : The principal tiling in Presi- -
dent Harrison's message is a zealous ret on- 1
meudalion that the Force Bill shoul 1 be tak
en up mid passed through Congress. This,
scheme should he resisted determinedly, mi- j
yieldingly, uncompromisingly by every I
Democrat. If necessary every means of .It; j
lay and obstruction should be resorted to in |
Congress. Toe mischiefs that are sure to j
arise from such a political revolution are so |
great iqid so grave as to overshadow every
oilier questiou .
y. I”, li Wld.: Iu brief the message is a
thoroughly partisan but otherwise colorless j
document who- e attlher writes it not bee mse i
he has anything to say or suggest, hut tie- i
cause, in the course of Ins routine duly, lie is j
required to scud a message to Congress at ,
tins lime. It makes no effort to grapple witli |
the problems of the time or direct legislative ;
policy lit harmony with the needs and asptr- j
atious of tlie people. It is not a Stale paper, 1
hut a perfunctory and ly no means candid
review of departmental reports, conceived in
the spirit of a Bourbon and expressed in the
tone of a Pharisee.
.V. Y. Times: The President lias forgotten
little and learned nothing. He meets the !
Congress in which his party provoked detent !
on its reassembling with a tediously urgent I
exhortation to remedy none ot tlie mistakes
already made, to press forward in Hie same
line mid trust to that Providence which Hie
French say watches over “Americans and
fools.''
V. V. Tribune : It Is a message eminently
titled to recall the Republican voters of 188S
to n s.-use of their responsibility and to re
mind them that the national policies f>r
wliieh they then declared deserve their un
wavering support.
P/iila yurth American : President Hand
son has prepared nothing for cranks, kite
flyers and doctrinaires in Ids annual message
to Congress. Ho has taken the view of a I
practical business man, and ids message is a 1
business statement to a community ol prae- I
ticai men of business.
Phila. Inquirer: The issues made by the j
present Congress must be stuck to, ami iip.iti (
them the next Presidential campaign must be
tonight. There is to he no halting and hack
mg. That is the meaning of the President's !
message. 1
y. Y. Press: Conspicuous above its coin-;
pletcness of detail concerning the tilings Hud
the public wants to lie informed on, and I
equally eonspieious above the clear-headed
manner in which he discusses reasons and
makes needed distinctions, shine Hie perfect [
integrity of the man’s intention Justice is |
a strong trait of President Hairison’s cliarac- I
ter, and the evident honesty of Ids guardian
ship of the public interests must strengthen |
him before the country.
y. Y. Star: Fashioned after tho tradi
tional pattern us to subject discussed and
the order in which they are mentioned, in
literary and forensic merit it barely rcae.ies
mediocrity, while, politically, it is a purely |
partisan plea in extenuation of Hie course of
the administration and the Congress which 1
the people have just decidedly e >ndemued.
j A’. Y. Mail and J^.rpress: In its details the !
message is remarkable for thoroughness, l
simplicity and vigor. In its spirit ii j s fear
lessly Republican, while it is broadly Ameri
can and patriotic. It is a document
worthy of the great and grave emergencies
that Congress has to meet And theßepuh
■ lionn majority should be inspired with new
I courage and determination bv the message.
KAll.ltO.4l> KSIIiDIKU.
| On Paper ami Otherwise.
j There are three distinct rnilroad projects
| now being eni ncsilv considered by’the people
of this comity two of which have the appear
ance of being in accord, with the third utter-
I ly ignored by both, and yet I lie third covers
I the section of country lying between these
two.
We refer to the Eminitshnrg movement
(ora road to Oellyshiti'g and the Middletown
Valley movement, an the two on the face of
affairs as being in afford, and the M. V. &
P. R. If. (extension of the M, V.) as the third
movement ignored by the other two.
Now, it is our purpose, in this article, to
amplify a statement made in these columns
several weeks ago, and prove, beyond cavil,
that the proposed route from Middletown to
Gettysburg, via Rocky Ridge and Emmits
burg, as compared with that one via Ca'.octiu
Furnaces, Mechimicstown and Emmilsburg
is wholly impracticable, viewed cither from
the standpoint of cost of construction or
from that, of (laying traffic when completed.
First: the Rocky Ridge route will be the
longer of the two ; again, a survey has been
made by the former route and this need only
he compared with any possible route via
Rocky Ridge to show that in the matter of
bridges and approaches to the three streams,
Fishing Creek, Hunting Creek and Owens
Creek, alone, the lower route is impractica
ble. These stieams on any line reaching
Rocky Ridge are hounded on one or both
sides by immense ridges of red to k, the
valleys great depressions and the interlying
spaces irregular summits everyone of under
lying red rock to any depth necessary to go
to secure the grade; to bridge and approach
the three streams alone, by the lower route,
would, in the Judgment ot one conversant
with both routes and informed in mutters of
this kind, more than build the road bed
from Catoelin Furnaces to Yellow f-prings.
A glance at the map of any geodetic survey
ill convince any one of the evenness of the
lines of equal altitude at the immediate base
of IheCatoetin Spur and every one acquaint
ed with the section knows how wonderfully
broken and displaced is the entire red rock
strata. In the matter of road bed construc
tion and bridges, the lower route by compar
ison therefore is impracticable: this puts
two items against it, distance and cost of
const ruction.
Again; in the mutter of traffic,everything
is in favor of the upper route, for necessarily,
so far as local traffic is concerned, the prop >s
: I’d road should consider freight rather than
' passenger traffic. How do the the two routes
Island? What is to lie expected from the
lower route, which throughout would secure
lint the farm products of a not over-prodne- j
live licit? Practically hut little. What
recommends the upper route? An unbroken
lied of minerals from Yellow Springs almost j
to Emmttshnrg, in t one lon of which ore can
find a market, except a railroad passes inline- i
dialely by it. From Yellow Springs to within 1
three miles of Kmmitshnrg on the upper'
route lie a succession of rich deposits ot
magnetic, specular and hematite ores, ochres
and Mints, which will he marketable and
outweigh, twenty to one, the shipments of
the lower route. In addition to lids the coke
and iron tinffieof ('atoeiin Furnaces, winch
may naturally he expected to come under a |
more energetic management ere long, of
itself is a fair set-off agdnst the traffic over
ihe lowi r route. And the hulk of the local
traffic that the lower route won d secure, ’
would come to the upper route anyhow.
The development ot the mineral resumces of
the county can only he secured by the upper
route and we have shown that this alone
must he looked to for paying ti utile. This;
makes the third item in favor of the upper
route, i
Now, we " ill consider (lie sole inducement
that the lower route oilers and that Is the
seven mlhs of railroad from Rocky Ridge to
Emmitshurg. it is losayesome of the money
that lias been invested in that road, that the
people of Middletown Valley and Monucaey
Valley are asked to come to it over unpro
ductive hills and across the deep-sunken beds
ol Fishing, lliintingand Owens Creek. The
W M H R. eagerly seeks to operate every
branch road that it can get its hands on if
there is promise ot profit m it, yet we call
attention to the suggestivo fact that it does
not operate the E. R R , and why? Because :
it can not he made to pay and that same
seven miles of road will not pay the propos- ;
eil road, while its parallel from Mechanics- i
town to Emmitshnrg will not only pass by,
immense and valuable magnetic ore beds, hut ;
will he within a stone’s throw of Ml. St. j
Mary’s College and will cross Toms Creek j
simply at a high water elevation and by easy ,
approaches.
To sum up, we desire to see the two routes j
surveyed and estimates laid liefore the people |
of Middletown Valley and the other sections
interested and when that is done wo shall he
content to have both our judgment and lion- •
esty of purpose impeached if it does not I
appear that the lower route Is wholly imprnc- i
tumble.
Railroads are readily built on paper and '■
the Middletown Valley people may he relied j
upon to consider both routes, before they ,
finally adopt either. We do not understand |
that the publication in divers daily and |
weekly newspapers, of their intention to I
build a railroad to Rocky Ridge fixes the:
matter; iu fact, it does not fix it, hut we
believe that, if after due examination of the
two rotiles, that cia Rocky Ridge should
prove to he the more practicable, then via
Rocky Ridge it will he built, for we believe
Middletown Valley will build a road to the
Western ,Maryland and that the present
movement will he the one to do it.
The following extract from an article on 1
the subject, published in the last issue ot the i
Valley Register, gives an idea of the condition
of things over there :
‘ Should the road Ik* constructed from ,
Middletown to Rocky Ridge, ahd the Em- ;
mitshurg road extended to Getlyshuag, (here
would he a direct line from Gettysburg and \
the North to Middletown, crossing the
Western Maryland road at Rocky Ridge. j
We arc glad to say that wc have never
seen our people more united or more enthu
siast ic over any previous railroad project
that Ins been sprung here, linn they are
over Ihe present one. We think the time,
lias at last conic when the people of Middle- i
town Valley are about tired of being com
pelled to haul all llicir produce from 8 to 15 i
miles over the mountain to Frederick or to ,
Claggetl’s Station, Washington county, in
order to reach a railroad station, or to go the
same distance whenever they want lumber, j
phosphate, lime, coal, merchandise, Ac. Let
everybody lend a helping hand and the roijd
will he built.”■
