WashinKton. Dec. 6. ? This might wft! '
t* called Inauxural week in the national
capital. Tho festivities anil crrnnony ,
will come on March 4. but to all Intents ?
*nd purposes the arrival of lYesldont .
?>lect Harding marks th>- beginning of i
the new regime. The Republicans are ,
il ready in control <?f both hi -uses of con- '
cress and aro fully organized so they ?
need only tAke their cue for the present
session from the new leader of the
party.
"When Mr. Harding, moreover, apjniints
his cabinet, me iie? neana of the depart- |
rnents will be able to get familiar with
the executive bureaus of the government
without waiting for March T. But the j
important thins about this week is the 1
ttpirit with which the Republicans are
appr* aching the r new responsibilities. ;
They realize that much progress can be
made by way of public hearings and
committ'e* meetings in formulating a
basic program of legislation for the
extra session of congress to be called by '
Mr. Harding immediately after he takes ?
the oath of office.
So Obstruction I I
There is already a disposition on the !
part of the Democrats to defer to the , .
Republicans and to put no obstructions ? (
in their path. Thus the session of con- 1
cress which hits just opened may be
more productive than was rtrst anticipat- ?
?^1. It Is only in the executive mansion :
Itself that the element of mystery and ;
doubt remains, l.'p to noon when eon- ;
cress convened the oewspaptr corres- . *
pondents were unaware whether tho ,
President would send his message to ' >
congress or come to the capital himself J
and deliver it. Indeed, the mesage itself1
had not even been sent to the printers .
or advance copies of it given to the
various press associations to be held for |
release a?s has been the custom In the j
t*ist. t
Back of all this is a drama which the j (
public Is not permitted to see. Woodrow ;
\Vilson is strucgling against the advice J
of physicians who have n<>t thought it .
wise for him to appear In person In
Congress. It was against the advice of ,
physicians th:it ho took the famous,
western trip which resulted In his nerv- |
? >ua. breakdown. His advisers say he Is?;
well enough to deliver the message but , ]
they see no r'-ason to take the risk the , .
'?xcitement of which may bring on a re- ; <
lapse. I I
Wants Action oa Treaty i
Still cherishing the idea that he may,
In- able to round out his administration
with a concrete achievement for world 1
i>e?ce. Mr. Wilron wants actton by the 1
present congress on the treaty and I
league of nations covenant. He h?s been ]
urged to send it back to the senate with
compromise -suggestions. Most of his
idvisers favor such a course. They do- 1
>-lare that tho Republicans may ignore ;
the tr<*ty but that the record of
l>?moeratic administration will thus 1
have b'^n complted. ?
< 'huracterlstlcally. Mr. Wilson haa '
kept his own counael and given no ink- '
iinjc rit his plans to anyone. Even while . *
iioui'e officials rffwwd absolute Ignor- i '
in.-f of the |?r?-sid--nt's Intentions and I
lid n<'t say as thoy have so often In the j 1
nost that " they but were forbidden to ? '
tell. The fact of the matter Is that the ?
' rag.-dy of the White House is the single
cloud that overhangs Washington as tne |i
new congress convenes. Pew people ; '
*now how the presdent is retting along. 1 1
>>nly the vacuest kind or information;
??omes from the White House, chiefly be- ?
?auso there Is little to tell. Mr. Wilson j
?lrifts along with a minimum of work
?ind a maximcm ? ?? rest and quiet. He '
is more solitary than ever. He holds few ' .
??on Terences, sees his cabinet ofTlcers ; '
Tirely and transacts business in the In- k '
ner sanctum without any outer evidence. .<
His recommendations to Congress are J
made up by his cabinet officers, who are '
-eallv running the government. Sympa- >i
*hv for the President is growing as he ? I
struggles to overcome obstacles of ill {
iealth and finish out his term. He is
said to be In much befter condition than jl
i year ago and better able to function as , I
function as head of the government than <
he was But he Is necessarly inactive. |i
Me had hoped to go to congress for a ' i
'arewell address and a farewell plea for ' 1
'he league of rations. His indomitable <
*?111 remains with him. He thinks he is (
?veil enough to go to congress. Will his j
;>hysiclan? or his own will win out? The i
inswer will be given tomorrow.

Financial Aid Cut Off
Athens, Dec. fi. ? ( 1 ty the Associated,
Press.) ? -Great Britain will extend no ,
further financial aid to Greece In ease
Former King Constantlne returns to the
throne, accord i hk to a note prcsciuca
the Greek government today by Ksri
Granville, British minister in this city. ?
The French minister also presented a
note to the government, demanding the j
payment of outstanding loans.
Both the notes forbid the issuance
by the National Bank of paper money ,
already printed against a loan of 4t'0.- ;
000,000 drachmas, which was arranged
during the regime of Former l'remier ;
Venizrlos.
"?\V?. can only do what the people
wain," xald l'remier George Kliailis in
speaking of the two communications. ,
Thi regent has no word from Coustan- i
tine. I will reply in a few days to the
British and French notes."
Vota a Triumph for Constantlne.
Athens, I'ee. 6. ? Keturns from the .
plebescite held throughout Greece yes- (
eiday which was to decide wheiher^the .
.Jreek people would reclaim Former King
'onsiantine to the throne made vacant i
>y the death of lrtu son. King Alexan
der. appear to indicate an overwhelming !
majority In favor of Constantino resum- .
ng power as king.
Th% vote is being counted as a matter
if formality, for the plebescite was con
jidered farcical in this city and in the
rountry at large. Kcports for the na
tion generally indicate a majority of
>00.000 In favor of the return of Con
stantlne. and claims are made that the
?ntire electorate of si?0.0iu> voted for
Htm. De finite returns from l'iraeus
?show 13.000 in favor of Constant ine and
>nly 900 against him. Four million bai- I
lots wore printed for the plebescite. I
Arrangements have made for the re
turn of Onstantine from Switzerland,
[t Is pointed out In this city by adher- ,
?nts of the former king that the allies
'do not understand that the people de
mand Constantlne, and are losing time
writing notes."
Wild Scenes Staffed.
The wild scenes w filch marked the de
parture of former Premier Veiuielos on
November IT were attain enacted last
ivening in celebration of the result of
the plebiscite, which was known before
the vote was taken.
A crowd estimated at 20. 000, In which
there were babies, children, women,
civil servants, girls, peasants, women
from court circles, sailors and soldier*,
cathered in Place De La Constitution,
near the king's palace, converging on
that square by all streets. Some v?.>re
walking, some riding In carts and auto
mobiles. and all worked themselves into
x perfect freniy, waving flaics of all u?
tions, olive branches and paintings and
d holographs of Constant ine.
A large part of the crowd was com
posed or women, who clamored for per- ,
mission to vote. As they marched
ilong, they chanted madly: "Constan-.:
tine ha?? yromlstff us the vow."
A demonstration was made in favor of
Princess Anasiasta and a handsome
woman gowned In pale yellow satin ap
peared upon a balcony above the famous
L*fe De Bresil. While the people ap
plauded she clapped her hands and cried.
'Constantlne Is coming Pack." "Long
live the dollar princess," was the ans
wering shout. ...
The votes cast in the plebescite prob
ably will be counted in detail today.
Those engaged In counting them quit
work last night in order that they might
join in the carnival, in which soldiers
*nd women formed rings like children
[lancing "ring around a rosey" the wom
pn throwing confetti over their com
panions. . . ...
It is planned that the liner Patris
arill meet Constantlne at Brindisi late
this week.
Constantlne Oats Keports.
Lucerne, Switzerland. Dec. t>. ? Ex
King Constantino this morning received
:he first direct returns from the plebis

preventing civil war down there, and
in bringing to an end the murders and
the sniping that have been going on; In
stopping the dynamiting of property and
the lawlessness that has prevailed, it
was for that purpose that I brought
bark federal troops Into the county and
asked that It be put not under mart la!
law but under temporary military con

"The troops arc helping t>> collect

drasi from the floor of the aanata. j
Though disclaiming any drslre to !
crltlciaa the present administration,
Mr. Harding daclared It ona of tha
ambitions of hla four years aa chief
executive to ineure better team work
between tha two branches of tha
government.
The bulletin speech, which <1 1<1 not |
j touoli ori detailed questions of policy, j
; was delivered by the president-elect in ;
response t?> art ovation that greeted him '
when lit* went to the senate chamber y<
his capacity as senator and answered to

Senator Har.ling rose t?> sjwak utter*
(Senator Lodge. of Massachusetts, the/

formally to his presence und asked that .
the be recognized by the vice president. {
"I am pleased at this Erecting, my ;
i fellow members of the senate," said Mr. j
Harding.
"There |s still greater satisfaction 11 1
; having 'his opportunity to say to you!
informally some of the things in my J
heart which 1 could utter in 110 other |
way. I recognize that I am here today 1

to this senate that I came here with

I "I like the freedom, the association.

which abides here, I am conscious of'
' the great place which confess holds un- J
I der our constitution and particularly
1 sensible to the obligations of the senate. |
1 When my responsibilities be?;in in the|
: executive capacity. 1 shall be as mind-,
; ful of the senate's responsibilities as I
? have been zealous of them as a member. !
1 but 1 mean, at the same time, to be just j
as insistent about the responsibilities of!
the executive. Our governmental good [
fortune does not lie in any surrender at'
either end of the avenue, but in the CO- i
*1
ordinal Ion and cooperation which be- j
comes the two in a great and truly rep- I
resentative popular gmernment. .
Cox'a "Oligarchy" XaxmJeaa Fiction. |
"This brings me to the thought par-)
ticularly in mind. Something has been)
said about the 'senatorial oligarchy.' Of'
course, every otic here knows that to be |
a bit of highly imaginative and harmless [
fiction. Hut 1 do recognize how essential i
is th?- helpfulness of the senate in the
making of a successful administration.!
"I want to express today the wish of',
a colleaguo for the conlidence and the,
.cooperation of the members of this body i
in the four years which begin next
March 4. I do not limit this sincere re- j
quest to tills side of the aisle. One can
not promise agreement In all things;
with . . opposite party which is some!
times insistently wrong, but we may find
common ground in the spirit of service, ,
and 1 hope for that agreeable and cour
teous and oft times helpful relationship'
with tiie opposite which has added to the
delights of fellow service during the I
past six years.
Btjr Problem to Solve
"We are facing no easy fctsk. We
have our full part in tile readjustment
of human affairs. aJter the world tu- j
mult. We have our tasks as home, we
have our iwtrt in the inevitable work
??f the civilized world. I am sure that ;
the necessity of wise solution will in- j
spire us to work topr?thor, to take com- |
moil counsel, to be tolerant of one an- i
other and give the. best which is In 1
all of us to attain the ends which be- I
come (>ur republic at home and will !
maintain its high place among the na- i
Hons of the earth.
Makea no BufTiTertlona
"With propriety I cannot venture upon
any sugsestons now. even though 1 am
speaking as a member of this body.
Three months of the prtsent adnilnlstru- ,
tlon remain, and 1 would have house !
and senate join cordially in making j
them fruitful rather ihann wasted j
months. There is so much to be done
and we have alr'iady had so much of i
delay, that 1 should like unanimous rec- j
ognition that there are no party ends to '
serve, but precious days are calling for 1
service to our common country.
"I cannot resist the repetition of my
regret that my association on this floor
and in coinniitt?e rooms is ending to- 1
day. It lias been a happy and a proud
experience. Let me express the hope, '
to one and all. that, though there cymes
a change in official relationship, it will j
not Interrupt our coop? rations, nor de- j
prive us of the personal fellowship
which I have found to be a great com- ,
pensation for the sacrifices of conscien
tious public service."
Before beginning his address, from
the vice president's rostrum. Senator
Jlarding holding ins eyeglasses and a |
yopy of his prepared address In his 1
nand. gave a brief extemporaneous
statement of gratification over his re- !
ception. He said it afforded him an '
opportunity "to say to you rather in- j
formally some of the things that I want j
to say that I couid probably utter In I
no other way." j

Washington, Dec. 6. ? (By The liM
ciated Press) ? Speculation about tfc 'S
possible cabinet selections of the Incodte -
lng administration was cast Into raoft
definite lines today by consultations h*?
tween President-elect Hardinr and lea i
ers of his party in and out of congreqp.
Three names which stood In the fore
ground tonight iraoqg the many dt|*
cussed as possible cabinet membtM.
were those of John W. Weeks, of W>M' -if
aehusetts, for sccratary of the Mfy;
Will H. Hays, of Indiana the RepubR
can national chairman, for postmastafr- >
general, and Harry M. Daugherty, of
Ohio, the Harding nre-convenUon man*
ager, for attorney-general. *
Other* Mentioned.
Prominence also was given by tiM ^
day's conferences to the possible iiliii
tion of David Jayne Hill, of New- Terk,
former ambassador to tie.rmany, as S?
retary of state, although such leadara-'jift >>
Charles Kvans Hughes, Ellhu Root, , ?*-!
ator Philander C. Knox, Senator H4WT
Cabot Lodge, Senator A. B. Fall Asp
opiers, still were prominently men*
tioned for the portfolio in some quar- , ?
ters.
Regarding the other places in the ne$r
official family, gossip was less deflnltfe jfL
and the list of possibilities was wld*Nf<
rather than narrowed by the day's 4^' . ,
velopments.
That no formal offers had been mads ? .
was emphasized by Mr. Harding himself
tonight, as the only comment ha wy /j
willing to make on reported selections
or on his discussion of the subject Wltll
Republican leaders.
Wo Places Offered.
"No place has been offered to utfy ' >
one," the president-elect said. "Bo
yond that, I can only reply to questlrac .
about the cabinet with a sweer lng
surance that I have nothing to say " ' ?
Mr. Hays. Mr. Daugherty and Mjr,
Weeks, all were present at tod*. 's *
ferences with Mr. Harding on this,
other subjects. Throughout the -
patgn. these three wore asdon*
Harding's closest advioers on qr~
