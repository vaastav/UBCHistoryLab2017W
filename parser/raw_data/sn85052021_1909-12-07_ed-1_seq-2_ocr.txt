The Interior Journal.
K. C. WALTON
We see from an Interview given out
by Congressman Harvey Helm on his
return to Washington that he will In
troduce bills for the erection of public
buildings at the following towns in his
district: Shelbyville, Lancaster nnd
Harrodsburg, running from $100,000 for
Shelbyville to smaller appropriations
for the other two named towns. As the
Lancaster postofllce receipts are not as
large as Stanford's by several thousand
dollars, and Stanford's about the same
as Harrodsburg, tho Interior Jour
NAL would liko to know if Stanford,
the home of CongressmanlHelm, Is not
a part of tho Eighth Congressional dis
trict and entitled to fair consideration
at that gentleman's hands from a pub
lic building standpoint? We are for
tho upbuilding of Stanford and for tho
betterment of Lincoln count and we
propose In the future, as well as in the
past, to continue to preach that doc
trine to the best people that God ever
let the sun shine upon. We have plen
ty of beautiful sites, especially the old
Seminary grounds on"Main Street, to
locate a handsome structure upon,
which in the days to come we can point
to with pardonablo pride and which
would put a loyal constituency under
lasting obligations to the one who caus
ed it to be erccted'in one of the best
towns on the map and splendid officials
officials to occupyj it. When Senator
James B. McCreary, of Richmond, was
in Congress, among other of his good
traits, was the fact that ho was ever
loyal to his home people first, which
endeared him to their hearts always.
He had placed in that beautiful city a
public building at a cost of $125,000 or
more and it willfever be a monument
to his memory when he has crossed
over the river to restjunder the shade
of the trees. We would like to know
why Stanford- is not deserving of a
beautiful publicbullding that would, in
evary way, be commensurate with our
little city, her High School building and
the handsome new $35,000 court-house,
which is now nearlng completion. We
wo lid not pluck from the brows of any
of the above towns any laurels they de
serve, but we would crown Stanford
with that wreath of gold she is so just
ly entitled tojwear. How about it, Mr.
Congressman?
In his annual report Secretary of Ag
ricuiture Wllsonjshows how the con-
iu tier has beenlgouged by the meat
sellers, but hisstatement was unneces
sary in face of the fact that Armour &
Co. alone made a gross profit for tho
year of $10,582,000 on a capital stock of
$2),000,000.and a net dividend of 35 per
cent. The packers' committee recent
lymade the statement that the packer
being obliged to pay a higher price for
live stock passed on the additional cost
to the dealer, who inlturn shifted it to
the consumer. Even this fails to ac
count for the increase in two years of
$5 a barrel formessbenf. The concern
that makes 35 per'rent. off its patrons
can only do so byjthe rankest extortion
What's the matter withjgiving the beef
trust a tisto of the Standard Oil medi
cine? Kentucky is noted forjother things
besides blue grass'land, 'pretty women
and fast hones. She leadslall tho oth
er States in tobacco growing, producing
more than one-third of the crop of this
country and one-ninth of the entire
crop of the world. Some tobacco is pro
duced in almost everyllState, but less
than one per cent, of 'the country's crop
Is grown west of the Mississippi river.
Texas is the only trans-Mississippi State
in which the industry hasgained much
importance. Thclargest)crop of to
bacco ever raised was 'this'year. More
than 50,000,000 pounds ofcigar tobacco
and four times that quantity of other
kinds of tobacco is the estimate of the
axriculturalTdepartment.
A Washington dispatch says that
Attorney Lewis L. Walker, of Lancas
ter, has been agreed on for district at
torney of thelEasterndistrict of Ken'
tucky, and that Sawyer Smith, of Bar
bourtille, will be his assistant. We ob
ject to the latterrproposition seriously,
as we want to seeillon. George M. Da
vison, of thisplace, retain his present
position. Hisrecord in office has been
clean andlhe is In every way fitted for
the place. We hope the Department of
Justice will retain the clever assistant
district attorney from Lincoln county.
Kentucky ranks third in the list of
Internal Revenue payments with Illi
nois first and New York second. In
tho total of $246,212,719.22 Kentucky
contributed $28,130,420.31, which is
only J400.000 less than New York.
There was a decrease of over five and
a half millions In the revenue due In
large measuro to the prohibition move
ment. Deer production also decreased
while the tax on tobacco largely in
creased, showing that peoplo must
have stimulants of some kind, at least
they seem to think so.
A New York multi-millionaire gave
the man whq saved him from drown
ing, $5,000. In this valuation of him
self, tho gentleman displays little of
the characteristics of Harry K. Thaw,
who was decided by the court to suffer
from an aggravated case of exaggerat
ed ago.
Tire family residence at Washington
of John G. Carlisle, Secretary of. the
Treasury under Cleveland. Whs at
tached by an United States marshal
for a claim of $2,385 for diamonds and
other jewelry. The Itemized list In
cludes a three-stone diamond ring and
a soltaire diamond valued at $1,200,
another diamond ring $500, a ruby and
diamond ring $200, another diamond
ring $275, gold and diamond links
$150 and a string of gold beads $60.
The question naturally arises what did
Mr. Carlisle want with so much jewel
ry and why with his salary then and
large law practico since he doesn't pay
for It?
Fearino a trade war with Canada
some of tho leading Congressmen will
try to havo the tariff on wood pulp
and print paper modified as soon as
Congress meets. If tho law-makers
had been as sensible as they seem to
have been anxious to put a tariff on
knowledge they would have obviated
the danger in the first place.
Senator R. L. Huddle will intro
duce a bill In the next Legislature, tak
ing Casey county out of the 11th dis
trict and putting It In the 8th district,
thereby giving the gallant and fight
ing democrats of Casey a chance to be
factors in Kentucky politics. It is n
good bill and we hope the Senator will
be able to pass it.
The farmer is nearly always inde
pendent, but this year each one of them
is a king. Secretary Wilson in his an
nual report, says that this year's crop
Is worth $8,760,000,000, a gain over 1908
of $869,000,000. Everything the farmer
has to sell is in demand at higher prices
than ever. Who wouldn't be a farmer
if he could ?
The Louisville Herald has reduced to
one cent a copy, a decided innovation
in newspaperdom at the Fall City. A pa
per like the Herald can not be produc
ed for a cent and it Is foolish to sell It
at that price. We have heard of no
one kicking on the price of newspapers.
They are certainly cheap enough now.
In Missouri a pistol "toter" was
sentenced to two years in tho peni
tentiary, under the new law making
it a felony to carry one. That is a
pretty stringent law, but when it is
considered that most men who carry
pistols have murder in their hearts it
is not too severe.
A St. Louis jury broke the will of a
millionaire because It was proved that
he took five drinks before making it.
Unless he was mighty used to it, we
should say as a matter of fact that he
was not capable of proper distribution
of so much money.
'We have just made a pleasant dis
covery. Fifty-three pay days in 1910,"
says the Louisville Times. This is evi
dently from the hired editor's stand
point. The boss is certainly not going
in raptures over it.
Gertrude Atherton. the novelist,
says she would rather go t" hell than
to Chicago. It would doubtless be the
same to her if Christ should come and
order all to the lower place who belong
there.
Armour & Co. earned $7,126,924 net
on its $20,000,000 capital stock during
the year closed Nov. 1, a profit of 33
per cent. No wonder meat sums are
high and still advancing.
President Taft's message to Con
gress, which convened yesterday, lorms
perhaps the most vital and Interesting
source of news in the United States
during the present week.
A school for husbands with a course
in hooking dresses up the back is pro
posed. It might be a good idea if the
masculine fingers could be made not to
act as nil thumbs.
Cranderries are the cheapest things
on the market. Thoso who can not af
ford turkey can make a show at a part
of the necessaries at any rate.
A New York man got an injunction
against his wife for incessant talking
over the telephone. Most husbands would
do the same thing If they dared to.
POLITICAL.
Senator W. 0. Coleman, of Henry
county, has withdrawn from the race
for prison commisioner.
Gov. John F, Shafrotb, of Colorado,
in a speech at New York before the
Equal Franchise League, said woman
suffrage has proved a success in Colo
rado and predicted that it would be
come universal in the United States.
Representative Itansdell, of Louisi
ana, president of the National Rivers
and Harbors Congress, which meets at
Washington next Wednesday, conferred
with thePresIdent about the speech the
Chief Executive will make upon tho
opening of the Congress.
R. L. McCormlck, the richest man
In Tacoma, Wash , wants to succeed
Senator Piles, as he prides himself on
being a self-made man and on the fact
that he never has had on a necktie.
Those are two points against blm.
The self-made man is too often proud
of the job and tho other claim makes
him All the bill of what Sut Loving.
