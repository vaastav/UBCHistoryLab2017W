DOUBT IF WILSON
WROTE MESSAGE
Washington, Dec. 3.-I?<Congfress
K>k the Wilson nMnin n? , nmal
ith an outward show of scorn inifference
and even captions doubt
3 to the true authorship of. the
Dcument, but with an inWard recoption
of certain fundamental issues
hich the president had raised that
)uld not very well be side-stepped.
No better illustration perhaps
ave been given of the conception
hich the two rival parties have nowlays
of tiie nature of their public
tterances than the comment that was
sard in the message. Instead of
iving a careful analysis of the cominnication
and criticdxing it con*
rructively or destructively in the
tnse of offering an ^opposite point
I view the approach of the 1920
olitical campaign makes* it theorti
any necessary for the Republicans
> toss off teh whole, thing as of
ouibtful authenticity while the Demcrats
simrfltaneonely issue ecconims
of praise for' thephrases of
leir White House leaders.
Many Republicans preferred to
impress wonder whether Mr. Wilson
rote his own message. Others
lought the message altogether toO
rilsonian. They recognised too
le familiar phrases, toe "guttering
eneralities," and the excessive
mdneBB for tell viewpoint of labor
lat has so often characterised the
iTllson state papers. Nor did certain
r the thoughtful Republicans doubt
sr a minute that the tendency to*
ardward free trade exhibited by the
resident was indoubitably a .product
f the Wilson mind. These evidences

PRESIDENT URGES
SESSION TO ENACT
CONSTRUCTIVE LAWS
Washington, Dec. 2.?General recommendations
in legislation to comjbat
the cost of living, labor unrest,
radicalism and readjustment of the
'natioh to peace-time basis, were the
If^atnres of President Wilson's an
jftual message to congress delivered
today.
The peace treaty, the president
toid congress, will be discussed in a
sefoifrte inessage later, as will the
railroad question.
I^^the second time only, since
the president established the practice
of addressing congress in person,
his message was read today by the
m?
mendation3 were: v
Establishment of a budget system
for (the national finances.
Reorganization of tbe taxation aystUMrith
simplification of th, income
and excess profits.
?%. .? a a'- ? ?m m
readjustment or toe tartxx system
if tfectsaary to meet changed world
conditions and make the system con*
form with the fact that the United
states is "the greatest capitalist in
the world."
i .ijfccognitioh and relief for veteran
soldiers of the Wprid Var, particularly
in the way of government farms
as proposed oy Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to loste? the dyestuffs
industry bttilt up during the
I war to keep tfye United Sttit^a imle
pendent of foreign supply, .j
An enlarged program for rural development,
in recognition , of the
farmers' part in the war.
Treaty Delay Harmful
Measures which "will .remove the
causes" of "political restlessness in,
lout body politxi."
I At this Doint the oresident made
his most extensive reference to the
$eace treaty by eayinjr tjhe caused for
the unrest "are superficial. rather
than "deep-seated*' and that they
?azise froj or are cozu^ecfcsd with the!
fftftttre on the government
to arrive speedily at a just and permanent
p^ee permitting return to
normal condition* from the transfusion
of radical theoxlfes from seething
European centers pending such
delay, fromheartlesa profiteering reMilting
from-the increase of the cost
of>living, and lastly from the machinations
of passionateand malevolent
agita? oris. With the retarn to normal
conditions this unrest will rapidly
i w
disappear." - . |
' The president renewed his re commendationa
for legislation to deal effectively
with "those persons who by
violent methods would abrogate our
time-tested institutions.
' - Several recommendations, some renewals
of previous ones, were made
by the president to bring down the
cost of living. Among, them were extAnidon
of the food control law to
peace times for the emergency; regulations
for transportation of foods
in interstate commerce; a cold storage
lay? modeled after the law in New
Jersey; a law requiring marks to show
the length of time foods are kept in
storage and a law to secure "competitive
selling and prevent unconscionable
profits" by federal license
of corporations selling food in interstate
commerce.
A lone nortion of the messacre was
devoted to a discussion of the condition
and rights of labor. "A definite
program to bring about an improvement
in the conditions of labor" and
bring about "a genuine democratization
of industry" was recommended.
"The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances is to reImnve
fho om'omnpd# " afliH f.ViA nrpfri.
dent's message. At another point it
declared "the seed of revolution is
repression."
Activities of Reds
"The establishment of the principles
regarding labor, laid down in the
covenant of the League of Nations,"
said the message, "offers us the way
to industrial peace and conciliation.
No other road lies open to us. Governments
must recognize the right of,
men tn hnrtrnin cnllonHvolr fnr
humane objects . . .Labor must
no longer be treated as a commodity.
HOME SERVICE TO
BE CONTINUED BY
RED CROSS HERE.
The executive committee of the
Red Cross held an interesthig and
enthusiastic meeting Wednesday
afternoon in the Red Cross rooms, at (
which time Hiss Annie Doty, field
secretary of the Home Service Department,
made an address on the
work of her department She told of
the woii accomplished, the purposes
of the department and the plans for
the future. She also outlined the
needs of such a department in a
small city.
At the tiasinesfr session of the
executive committee it was decided

secretary with an automobile in order
for her to attend to her work in
the county.
From the report of the secretary
Mrs. M. T. Coleman, it was shown
that the work' of this departmenthad
grqwn to such proportions here, that
if it were to be done, it would be necessary
to get transportation in order
that any point in the bounty might
he visited.
The report of the secretary, Mrs,
0. C. Gambrell, showed that the Roil
all in Abbeville County brought in
about f1,600. Half of this sum belongs
to the local chapter. This a:
mount with the funds already on
hand were deemed sufficient to continue
thi home service tfannrim?tfr
for another year. 1 y

the shops was discussed and was

' "Ttte rigllt oz individuals w i
is inviolate," continued the menage, 1
"and ought not to be interfered with 1
by any process of government, "but i
there , is a predominant right and that I
is the right of the government to pro*
tect all of its people and to assert its '
power and majesty against the chal- I
lenge -of any class."
The president was referring to the
covernment'a recent injunction
against the coal strike. ]
The message closed with a pointed ;
reference to radicalism, and < red ,
doctrines and referred to "Russia to- ]
day with its blood and terror" as a ,
"painful object lesson of the power j
of minorities." . ,
"There are those in this country,
said the message, "who threaten direct
action to force their will upon
a majority. . .It makes little difference
what minority it is; whether
capital or labor, or ^ny other class; no
sort of privilege will ever be permittetd
to dominate this country.
Orderly processes, the message de*
- i n - ?
ciarea, were ine oniy ones Dy wmcn
relief and reform could be obtained.
"Those who would propose any
other method of reform are enemies
of this country," the message said
. . Let those beware who take
the shorter road of disorder and
revolution."
