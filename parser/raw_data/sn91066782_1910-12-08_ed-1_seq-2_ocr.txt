THE BAR HE DAILY TIMES, DECEALBEil 8, !!;().
BANK TAX LAW
MAY REMAIN
That's the Prospect in the
Senate at Present
IS REPORTED FAVORABLY
Idea of Final Adjournment of the Legis
lature Ts Fast Being Lost in Belief
That an After-holiday Session
Will Be Required.
The Semite bill which proposed to cut
down the tax on savings t.'t pottits in 'sav
ings hanks and trust companies and na
tiojiiil banks from 7-10 ot one per cent,
to y of one per cent, is iK)t likely to
' pass, although it has been reported fa
vorably b)' the committee on banks.
The bill came up yesterday, and when
the committee was questioned by Sen
ator Gordon the fact was developed that
although the decrease in the tax .would
cut down the revenue to the state, the
banks expected to raise their interest
rate to lour per cent, and thus attract
enough more deposits to more than make
up the decrease. As a matter of fact,
if there were no increase in deposits the
change proposed by the bill would mean
a loss to the state of over $155,000 an
nually, to ofiset which would require sev
eral millions more in deposits. In l!MKi,
when the law limiting the amount that
could be deposited in a savings bank
exempt from taxation was aniendVd so
that .$2,000 that wan in any or every
bank in the state was exempt, it was
thought that it would so largely increase
deposits that the state would be a large
gamer. trie eliange orougni rue siaie
in about $15,000, and this fact is con
sidered to have some bearing on what
would happen if this Senate bill should
become law.
The idea of a final adjournment before
Christmas seems to have been pretty
much given up. The progress this week
in disposing of business has been slow,
and when the House yesterday speni
over two hours discussitig a measure to
allow towns to vote to have the road
commissioners appointed by the select
men, it about put an end to any linger-
ing idea that anyone might have had
of getting through before the holidays.
With only 13 more working days left,
it seems an impossibility, even if night
sessions were resorted to, for with the
amount of committee work remaining
this would not help matters any.
The bill to change the shire town ot
Kssex county from Guildhall to Brighton
is pretty sure to be reported adversely
by the committee on town lines. At
the hearing held on the bill, only three
of the thirteen towns in- the county fa
vored the change, and the committee is
not disposed to recommend any change
unless it is sntislied that a majority of
the people of the county demand iv.
There seems to be little doubt but what
there are belter facilities for holding
court at Island Pond than at Guildhall,
anil the trouble connes from the inac
cessibility of Islam! Pond to tile ten
towns that oppose the change. Then,
too, there is a feeling in the rest of the
county that there is too much of a pre
ponderance of Grand Trunk interests In
Island Pond to make it a healthy place
in which to hold the court in which so
much railroad litigation is tried.
A neat dodge was tiled in the Hours
yesterday, when the bill granting the
right to the Champlain Realty company
to run logs in the Ottaquechee rivi
fame up with an adverse report. An
amendment was at once proposed, which
strikes out all alter the enacting clause
in the bill and substitutes practically
what was struck out, but in a littlo
different language. This eonies pretty
near violating one of the House rules
and will probnblv not serve to save
the bill. If this bill is killfl, the com
pany will not probur.'y make an attempt
to push another bill granting it similar
rights on the .Mad river.
The Senate and House committees on
railroads will be taken to Brattleboro
next Tuesday, to look over the situation
there with reference tr the charter asked
for by tho Boston & Maine road to build
from Brattlebro to South Vernon. Thu

discharges, running of the nose, soreness,
stiffness and rheumatic twinges.
Take this harmless Compound as di

anv druggist in the world can supply.
Pape's Cold Compound is the result of
three years' research at a cost of more
than fifty thousand dollars, and contains
no quinine, which we have conclusively
demonstrated is not effective in the
treatment of colds or grippe.

Gov. Mead has signed the following
Washington, Dec. 8. Bombs are hour
ly being plucked from President Taft's
message, as that remarkable document
is studied more at leisure. One that
will explode loudest is the very clear
threat of the president of the removal
of the lumber duties. W hue the hear
iugs of the ways and means committee
were in progress and thereafter, t
strenuous attempt was made to discov
cr the existence of a so-called lumber
trust, hut it failed and the lumber men
exultingly pointed out to Congress that
no trust condition prevailed in the in
dustrv hence no removal or reduction
of the duties would be warranted on that
score
President Taft, however, appears not
to have been contented to leave the sit
uation in this shape and in his message
he showed that while no trust or com
bination in the manufacture of lumber
exists, a direct investigation made by
the commissioner of corporations of
eighty per cent, of the privately owned
timber demonstrates that one-half of
tho timber in this area is owned by two
hundred individuals and corporations and
fourteen per cent, is owned by three
corporations. the commissioner discov
ers, ulso, a very extensive intcrow tier
ship of stock and other circumstances
pointing to such friendly relations
am-nnif the owners as .might easily lead
to a combination to hold up prices. The
president regards these relations as eir
cumstances "very detrimental to the
public interest," and they would, he
says, "create the neccMty of remov
ing all tariff obstacles to the freo ira
portation of lumber from other coun
tries."
These significant lines have alarmed
the lumber interests as represented in
Congress and have correspondingly en
couraged statesmen of one kind or an
other to bring some glory to the lie
publican party, bv achieving a little
tariff revision at this session. Tho lum
ber dtuies are comparatively simple and
the administration, if it were wiling
to encourage anv tarff action in the
near future, might not feel tinder ob
ligation to await a special report of the
tariff board before consenting to action.
The president's words at least, are a
hint to the lumoer industry that if too
high prices are found to prevail, without
any break along the line, evidence enough
has already been adduced from official
sources to warrant a removal of the
protection which the unbroken line of
nigh prices jtelf would prove to be un
necessary. An even more sensational paragraph

This action at least invites a popular
