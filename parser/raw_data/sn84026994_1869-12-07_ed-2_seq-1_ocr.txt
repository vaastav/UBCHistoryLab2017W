opinion that this number Is "necessary for
tho proper caro of thc Senate and attention or
tho senators, " recommend that they bc retain?

Tbs Code of Procedure which Corbin, Mont?
gomery und Whipper, after a year's selling,
hatched out, ls, as Corbin remarked, a "bug?
bear to thc Senate." It innkeH a very large
volume, and thc senators ure not uiixlous ta
wade through tho various readings, amend?
ments, substitutes, ic., which ure necessnry
before lt bo made a law. Corbin has drawn it
np in the form of a "bill to revise, simplify and
abridge tho mles, practice, pleadlugs and
forms of tho courts of this State," and on Wed
nesday stated that it seemed to be Impossible
te got tho members to lake lt up during Un
I regular hours, and moved that night sessions
be held to spoclally consider lt, commencing
Thursday night. Thc motion WM carried
unanimously. Thursday night came, l.ealh

Senate chamber at tho honr appointed, ant
' tho Sergeant-at-Arms was instructed tu lool

Senate. Ho looked for them everywhere, ex

l al LCSIIU'B ball-consequently tho few who mc
. to attend to their duty had to adjourn withou
" accomplishing anything. Yesterday, whei
thc hour to adjourn for tho day arrived, John

1 This brought Corbin to lils tuet. He sal
- he had one or two foolish ideas tn his head
- and ono of thom wits that tho senators wer

ted to BOC a disposition on thc part of some t
t shirk their duty, and he would u l ve notice Um

"looked down In the monlh," and tho looks (
i- ail betokened that they would bo moro pun?

complacent look. The hour for thc night sci

Tho House did not concur In tho rceolnlio

.Hilson persisted in lils motion, and further
opposition being made by Leslie, called for thu

Leslie to become Irritated, and, willi ti vexed
tom of voice, said: "Why hut defeat the hill nt

WASHINOTON, December ti. j
Thu President's message was delivered lo
both Houses of Congress to-dny, sud la us fol?
lows :
To r?ie Se?al? and Rouse'ofRepreaentatlvt* :
In comlug before you for thc llntt time as thc
Chief Magistrate of a great nation, lt li With
gratitude to thc Giver of All Good for thc many
benefits wu enjoy. Wc are blessed with peace al
home, without entangling alliances abroad to
forebode trouble, with a terri, jry unsurpassed in
fertility, und or area equal to thc abundant sup?
port of live hundred millions of people, abound?
ing la every variety of useful mineral, in quantity
sulllclcnt to supply tho world for gcucrultonB,
with exuberant crops, with a variety of climate
adapted to thc production of every species of thc
earth's riches, suited to thc habits, tastes aud re?
quirements of every living thing. Wc have a
population of forty millions of free people
spcuklug ouc language. Wc have facilities
for every mortui to acquire au education;
our institutions closing to none the ave?
nues to fame, or any blessing of fortune
that may bc coveted. Freedom of tho pulpit,
presa aud schools: n revenue flowing luto the
National Treasury beyond tho requirements of
thc government. Happily, harmony is being
rapidly restored within our own borders. Man?
ufactures, hitherto unknown in our country, arc
springing up In nil sections, producing a degree of
national Independence, unequalled by any other
power. These" blessings, and countless others,
aro entrusted to your care and mluc fur safe?
keeping, for tho brief period of our tenure ol
om cc. lu a abort time wu must each of ua rcturu
to tho ranks of thc people who have conferred
our honors, and account to them for our steward?
ship. 1 earnestly desire that neither you nor I
may bo condemned by a freo and enlightened
coDstltucney, nor by our own' consciences. ?
RECONSTRUCTION.
Emerging (rom a rebellion of gigantic magni?
tude, aided, us it was, by thc sympathies and as
sistance of nations with which we were at peace,
eleven States or the Uuton were, four years ago,
left %\ itbout legal State governments. A national
debt had been contracted; American commerce
was almo a driven from Hie sens; tho Industry ol
one-hair of thc country had been taken from the
control of thc capitalist, and placed where all
labor rightfully belongs-In the keeping of thc la?
borer. Thc work of restoring Stntc governments
loyal to Hie Union, of prelecting und fostering
free labor, or providing means for paying thc In?
terest on thc public debt, has received ample at?
tention from Congress. Although your efforts
has not met with success In all particu?
lars that might have been desired, yet, on tho
whole, they have been more successful than could
have been reasonably anticipated. Seven States
which passed ordinances or accession have been
fully restored lo their placea in thc Union; the
eighth, Georgia, held an election at which she rat
Hied her constitution, republican in form, elected
a Governor, members of Congress, a State Legis?
lature, and other ofllcers required. The Governor
waa Installed; the Legislature met and performed
all the acts then required of them by tho Recon?
struction acts of Congress. Subsequently, how?
ever, In violation or Hie constitution which they
had Just ratified, as since decided by thc Supreme
Court of tho State, they unseated thc colored
members or thc Legislature, und admitted te
scats some members who aro disqualified by thc
t'iird clause of thu Fourteenth amendment, an 'ar?
ticle which they themselves had contributed to
ratffy. Under these circumstances I would sub?
mit to you whether lt would uot bo wise, without
delay, to enact a law authorizing thc Governor ol
Georgia to con vene thc members originally elected
to tho Legislature, requiring each to take the oath
prescribed by thc Reconstruction acts, sud none
to bo admitted who aro ineligible under thc third
clause ofthe Fourteenth amendment.
Thc freedmen, under thc protection which they
have received, aro making rapid progresa In
learning, and no complaints aro heard of lack ol
industry ou their part, when they rccclvo fair re?
muneration for their labor.
Thc means provided ror paying tho Interest on
thc public debt, with all other expenses or Hie
government, arc moro than umplc. Loss or our
commerce la only the remit of tho late rebellion,
which has not reeclvod sufficient attention from
yon. To this subject I call your earnest atten?
tion. I will not now suggcat plana by which this
object may bo effected, but will, if necessary,
make lt the subject of a special message, during
Ihn session of Congress.
V1ROINIA.
' it thc March term, Congress, by a Joint r?solu
I .on, authorized the Executive to order elections
in thc States or Virginia, Mississippi ami Texas,
to submit Hie new conallt'.iTu&s which each
had previously framed, and to submit thc consti?
tutions either entire orin separate parts, to ha
voled npon nt thc discretion of thc Executive.
Under thia authority tho elections wera colled.
In Virginia thc election look place on thocth of
July. The Governor and ' Lieutenant-Governor
havo been installed. Tho Legir luiuro met and
did all required by this resolution and hy all Hie
reconstruction nels of Congress, and abstained
from all doubtful authority. I recommend that
her senators and representatives bc promptly ad?
mitted to their seats, and that tho state bo fully
restored to Its placo in tho family of Stales.
MISSISSIPPI AND TEXAS.
Elections were called in Mississippi and Texas,
to commence on the 30th November; two days In
Mississippi and four days In Texas. Tho elections
havo taken place, but tho resnlt ls not known.
lt ls hoped that the acts of tho Legislatures of
these States, when they meet, will be sachse to
receive your approval, and thus close the work of
reconstruction.
THE OnRRHNOY AND DEBT.
Among tho evils growing ont of the rebellion,
and uot yot referred to. ts that of an Irredeemable
currency, lt ls an evil which I hopo will receive
your most earnest attention. It ta a dnty, and
one of thc highest duties of a government, to
?ccu rc to tho citizen a medium of exchango of rix
ed and unvarying vainc. This Implies a return
toa apodo basis, and no substltnte for lt can bo
dcTiacd. lt should bo commenced now and reach?
ed at tho earliest practicable rnomont, consistent
with u mir rvgu.nl (otho Interests ol thu debtor
etas?, hmm ?iluto rvRuiopiioii, it" practicable,
would not bo desirable, lt wonlil -compel Hie
debtor class io pas beyond their contrails tho
premium on gold at tho iluto or their purchase,
and would bring banlsruptay and ruin to thou?
sands, fluctuations, however, in Hie pnpt r value
or thc measure or all values-gold-ls ilctriUiorttnl
to thc Interest or trade, ll make* Hie mau or
business nu involuntary gambler, for iu ali Huies
where ruturo pay meut is to be mmle, both purlies
speculate im to what will be the value or Uro
currency to bo paid ami received. 1 earn
cally recommend lo you, then, such legisla?
tion as will insure n gradual return io
spcele payments, aud put un Immediate slop io
fluctuations In thc value ur tin; currency. Tho
methods to secure tho ronner ur these results are
ns numerous us speculators on political economy.
To secure thc latter I sec bul one way. mid I hut
is to utlthorizo the treasury lo redeem Us own
paper at a fixed price, whenever presented, and
lo withhold from circulation ali currency so re?
deemed mn il sold ugain for gold. Thc vast re?
sources or thc nailon, both developed and un?
developed, ought io make our credit tin
beal on earth. With a less burden or luxa
Mon than tho cltlr.cn has endured fur six
years past, thc entire public debt could bc pahJ
in len years. Hut ll is not deMruhlc that the peo
plc should bc taxed to pay ll In that time. Yent
by year thc ability to pay increases lu a rup!?
ratio, but thc burden of Interest ought to bc re
duccd us rapidly ns ll can bc without n VlolatlOl
of contraer. Thc public debt is represcute?! li
great purl by bonds having from live to twent)
and from ten to rorty years lo run, bearing lu
tcrcst al the rate ot six aud Uve percent, rcspec
lively. It ia optional with thc government tu pu}
these bonds at any period after thc expira
Hun or thc least time mentioned upon theil
face. Tlic time has already expired when a great
part may bc taken up, and ls rapidly approach
lug wheu all may bc. It ia believed thal all whlcl
arc now due may tic replaced by bonds bearing t
rate or interest not exceeding roar mid n huir pei
cent., and as rapidly ns thc remainder become
due thal they may bc replaced tn thc same wny
To accomplish this, it may be necessary to au
thorlan, tho interest to ba paid at cither three o
roar or tho money centres or Europe, or by an;
assistant treasurer or thc United States, at th
option ol the hohler oj thc bunds. I suggest till
subject for thc consideration of Congress, nm
also simultaneously with this, thc propriety u
redeeming our <;urrcncy, aa before suggested, a
its markot value, at thc lime thc law goes Int
effect.
TAXATION.
Thc subject of tlic tariff and internal taxatio
will necessarily receive your attention. The ron
nues or thc country ore greater than its requin
mcuts, and may with safety bc reduced; bul, s
thc funding or thc debt in a four and a ronr-nui
a-hair per cent, loan would reduce tho anim
current expenses largely, thus, arter funding. Ju
il fj lng a greater reduction or taxation than woul
bc now expedient, I suggest thc postponement i
this question until the next meeting ol Congres
It may bc advlsablo lo modify taxation and Hi
tariff In lustanccs where unjust or burdcuson:
discriminations are made by present laws; bi
a general revision or thc Inwa regulating thia sui
Ject 1 recommend to bc postponed ror thc presen
I also suggest thc renewal or thc taxation or it
comes, but at a reduced rate, say three per cent
and tilla tax to expiro iu three years. Willi tl
funding Of thc national debt, as here suggcstei
I feel sarc in saying that tajfea and revenue fro
Imports may be reduced safely from sixty i
eighty millions per annum at once, and may 1
still ru i thur reduced from year to year as thc i
sources of thc country aro developed.
WAYS AND M SANS.
Tho report or Hie Secretary or Hie Trcasu
shown thc receipts or thc government for tl
fiscal year cudlng seth June tu bc $370,043,71
expenditures, Including Interest, bounties, Ai
to bc $321,400,507. The estimates for thc cnsuii
year arc moro ravorahlo lo thc government, ai
will, no doubt, show a much larger decrease
thc public debt. Tho receipts in Hie Trcasu
beyond thc expenditures have exceeded t
amount necessary to place to the credit ol t
sinking lund, as provided by law. To lock up t
-?rpliis In thc Treasury and withhold it from c
c .lalion would lend lo such a contraction of t
i currency as to cripple trade and seriously nfft
tho prosperity or thc country. Under these c
cuinstanccs, thc Secretary or thc Treasury ai

1 TnR ALABAMA CLAIMS.

u and circumstances aticudiug the negotiation ol
1 Hint treaty were unfavorable to its acceptance by
. Hie people or tho Uuitcd Stales, aud its provisions
1 wcic wholly I n adv ipi a te for a settlement or the
f grave wrongs sustained by this government, and

e urdu lu treasure and in lives, of lu suppression,
y could not bc adjusted and satisfied as ordinary
'f commercial claims which continually arise bo
>r tween co ni me rda', nations. Amt yet the couveu
II Hon treated them simply as such ordinary claims,
e from which they differ more widely In thc gravity
11 of I heir character than In tho mngnttudo or their
!' amount, great even as ls that difference. Not a
word was found in thc treaty, aud not un iufer
. ence could bc drawn from lt, to remove tho sense
of thc unfriendliness or thc course of Great Britain
'" lu our struggle for cxlstcnoc, which had so deeply
e and universally impressed itself upon the people
11 or this country. Relieving that a convention thus
misconceived in Rs scopo and inadequate in its
'" provisions, would not have produced thc hearty
c and cordial settlement or ponding questions
8 which alone ls consistent with tho relations w hielt
I desire to have firmly established between the
1 United States and Great Britain, I regarded the
actiou of thc Scuato in rejecting the treaty to
have been wisely taken in thc Interest or pence,and
'. as a necessary step In thc direction or a perfect
s aud cordial friendship between Hie two countries.
1 A sensitive propio, conscious of their powor, aro
1 more at case under a great wrong wholly nna
' toned, than under tho restraint of a settlement
1 which satisfies neither their ideas or just icu nor
' their grave sense or the grievance they have sas
r tallied. Thc rejection or the treaty wns followed
" tty a state of publlu feeling on both sides, which I
' thought not favorable to ail immediate attempt
' at renewed negotiations. I accordingly Instructed
thc minister of the United States to areal Brltaiu,
and round that my views lu this regard wore
r shared liv her Majesty's ministers. I hopo the Hmo
I may soon arrive when Hie two governments can
