A WORD ABDUr THE LEADING
EVENTS OF. THE WEEK.
Close of the Football Season.
Thanksgiving day, Pennsylvania de
feated Cornell at Philadelphia, 12 to 4.
Saturday, at the same city, Annapolis
beat West Point, 6 to 0. These are the
final games ot the season, which has been
the most interesting and best patronized
of any season. The new rules, encourag
ing open play, have removed much of the
danger and roughness, and have made the
game more pleasing to witness. Of the
big college teams Yale is considered to
have won highest place, having been
beaten only once, by West Point, early in
the season. Pennsy, despite her bad
beating by Carlisle, ranks second, for she
beat Cornell, who beat Princeton, who
beat the Indians. ' The latter was the on
ly defeat suffered by the Indian, who
played a remarkable game, defeating
Pennsy, Harvard, Chicago aud Minneso
ta. Dartmouth had an unbeaten team
that pat it over Harvard and many other
antagonists.

The Food for Poultry in Winter,
Much time and moaey have been spent
in what seems an almost vain endeavor
to make hens produce eggs in cold weath
er. ' It requires but little experience with
poultry to learn the fact that, under or
dinary circumstances, hens cannot pro
duce as many eggs in winter as in sum
mer. Summer is the natural time for the
laying of eggs, and in order to increase
winter production there must be repro
duced for the fowls as nearly as possible
conditions that exist in summer. Wal
ter E. Crawford of North Vassalboro,
Me., has apparently tried to do this, so
far as feeding his fowls is concerned.
Here is a letter from him: " 'Page'a Per
fected Poultry Food' is better than you
claimed it was, and 1 would not try to
keep hens another winter without it."
Anyone sending his address on a postal
card to C. S. Page, Hyde Park, Vt., and
mentioning this paper, will receive by
mail, free, postpaid, a sample package of
"Page's Perfected Poultry Food."

home for him and his little daughter, but
the day before her death was removed to
the house of her daughter, Mrs. Newell
King, on Water street.
Mrs, Waters, who had reached the age
of 78 years, was torn in Middlesex, but
for a quarter of a century bad resided in
Randolph. She first married Lewis 1L
Esters and the children of that onion are
Charles E. Esters of Nashua, N. 11., and
Mrs. Abbie Spencer of Barre. Her sec
ond husband was Robert Taussey, by
whom she had one daughter, Mrs. Kate
Com stock of South Barre. The children

of Charles Esters and Edgar Waters.
Coming thro' the Rye.
The roach-heralded comic opera com
pany, "Cjpming thro' the Rye," was at
Chandler aMuaio hall Wednesday night
and, naturally, was greeted by a large
and more-or-less critical crowd.
Comic opera is rather of a novelty in
Randolph, and a ballet is considerable of
departure from the old Puritan stand
ards in which we have been educated to
shudder at a shuffling of feet to the scrap
ing of a wicked fiddle. A few of our peo
ple have occasionally escaped to the city
long enough to learn something of the di
versions of a metropolis, but advanced
ideas in Terpsicborean art have not here
tofore been engrafted on our scheme of
pastoral joys.
'Coming thro' the Rye" is brilliantly
staged, not burdensomely costumed end
has a fascinating ragtime sort of music
Nott, the tailor, was by all odds the
brightest star and shone at his best in the
Irish song of Clancy of Donegal. The
soloists were not singers of surpassing
merit, but the chorus was good. The pony
ballet was all that was promised a little
white horse surrounded by capering fillies
of a supposedly higher order of creation.
Rye was not a predominating element
in the mixture of the piece and seemed
merely to provide an attractive title for a
light and airy composition.
A Missionary of Japan.
Miss Alice True of Amesbury, Mass.,
for eight years a missionary in Japan un
der the auspices of the Christian, society,
spoke in Bethany church Sunday morn
ing and evening on Japanese character
and ideals. Her addresses were exceed
ingly interesting as embodying the con
clusions reached by personal intercourse
with the Japanese, whose Orientalism is
a good deal of a mystery to Western peo
ple.
Tuesday arternon, Miss True met the

Ladies' Missionary onion of Bethany
church at the Parish house and explained
the scope and nature of missionary labors
in the tlowery kingdom and told what a
woman can do in Japan. Forty-two la
ides were present and at the close of Miss
True's remarks, tea and wafers were
served by Mrs. Fraser Metzger, Mrs. E.
W. Tewksbury and M.iss Kate Howard,
arrayed in Japanese costumes.
Miss True, who is now a licensed
preacher, has been in this country about
a'year but expects to return to Japan in
March and will move her headquarters
from Tokio to a place farther north. She
was a fellow student of Rev. Mr. Metz
ger in the theological seminary at Htam
fordville, N. Y.
The Ladles' nnlon, which rabed about
50 for home and foreign missions last
year, held its annual meeting Tuesday
and elected Mrs. Metzger president; Mrs.
Mary Golddbury, vice president and cor
responding secretary; Miss Kate Howard,
recording secretary, and Mrs. E. A.
Thomas, treasurer.
Evening of Hawaiin Music.
The Honolulu Students, six in number,
appeared in Chandler Music hall Monday
evening and gave an entertainment some
what out of the ordinary line of musical
programs. The students, whose manipu
lation of the English language had none
of the cold rrispness of the North, were
evidently native Hawaiians and, though
not dark-skinned, had bair black , as a
raven's wing and were becomingly as
well as picturesquely clad in white, enliv
ened by red saaues and coral necklaces.
The only lady in the troupe, Madame
Anehila, is the possessor of a powerful
contralto voice of a peculiar quality that
makes ita very distinct albeit harmoni
ous member of a chorus. She bad a co
qettisb little way with ber and played a
native instrument that seemed to require..
no more than a perfunctory sweep of the
string i at regular intervals.
Another vocalist was William Holona, a
baritone singer of exceptional merit as
well as a skilful player of the guitar, lie
and Madame Anehila in the duet of a
Hawaiian love song enacted a tender
scene admirably and at the same time in a
way to suggest that moonlight and its
madness do not vary much the world
over.
La Thompson Keouli is an unusually
good violinist and his solo, "Gsvsleris
Rusticana," was an artistic performance.
He is also a good singer and showed a
some talent for comedy. The flutist,!
Fr xt Kahea, made his instrument add
not a little to the orchestral effort and to
be beard with pleasure in solo.
The native music of Hawaii seems to be
in a minor key sweet, but with the
touch of sadness that ia so often detected
in plantation melodies. Naturally the
minor strain entered especially into the
"Farwell Song," composed by LUioaka
lan I, ex-queen of the itlands, that was the
finale of the concert. The inconsequen
tial manner in which the students wan-.
dared onto the stage fur the different
numbers, playing their instruments ss
they walked, had an odd effect that
helped to increase the impression of
something unique snd foreign about the
company.
Between the parts of the program some
really beautiful, dissolving view of Ha
waii were shown with the advantage of
lighting effects by an expert operator,
Frank Bean. The descendants of Boston
missionaries sppear to be the dominant
class in the islands snd in their troubles
with the natives succeeded in bringing
about annexation with the Cnited State.
One curious fact was mentioned that the
pslms on the islands came originally
from this country.
