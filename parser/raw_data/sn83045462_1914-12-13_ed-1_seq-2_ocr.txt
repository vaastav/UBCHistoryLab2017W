London Opinion Is That Stout Ad

Will Not Sacrifice Hen Against
Fortified Works.
LONDON. December 12.?There is J
wide disparity between French ant
y Oerman accounts of the battles ii
Flanders and France. It is apparen
from both, however, that the allies
have assumed at least a partial of
fensive. The French announce tha
this movement is meeting: with success
while the Germans assert that the at
tacks of the allies have been repulse*
with heavy losses in killed, wounde*
and prisoners.
The general impression here is tha
the allies, with artillery and occasiona
infantry attacks, are preparing th<
way for a general offensive, and in do
ing so are meeting with the usua
stubborn resistance from the Germans
who are firmly established in intrench
ed positions.
The advance, if it is possible, must
therefore, be slow, as Gen. Joffre, th<
commander-in-chief, is not likely t<
sacrifice the lives of his men in an at
tempt to storm fortified works.

DISARGEE ON STRATEGY
Falkenhayn Is Criticised for Failure
in Western Theater Since Fall
of Antwerp.
THE HAGUE, December 12, via London,
4:45 p.m.?German newspapers
which have just been received here show
that the German press, although prohibited
strictly from criticising any
acts of the government during the war.
is much displeased by the sudden
change in the leadership of the German
military forces. They state that
Count von Moltke has been "politely
sidetracked" as chief of the general
staff and that supreme ecommand has
been given to "a war minister whose
behavior toward the reichstag in the
Zabern incident was Insulting."
In the short biographies of Maj. Gen.
von Falkenhayn, which the newspapers
are permitted to print they refer in the
1 most guarded way to what they term
,f his failure up to 'the present time in
? the operations on the western front.'
"Von Falkenhayn was appointed tem.
porary chief of the general staff Oct
tober 25," says the Berliner Tageblatt.
r "He therefore has held the position
t since the fall of Antwerp. During this
period have occurred the battles of the
Yser and Dixmude. In this serious time,
therefore, von Falkenhayn has been
uniting all the functions which during
107A kotn-oon
Uic Wfll Ul loiv nvit ui.iuvu vvv.. vvu
von Moltke and Roon."
Friction Is Intimated.
It is intimated in these newspapers
that there has been friction between
Emperor William and Count von Moltke
owing to a difference of opinion concerning:
the conduct of the campaign in
the west, it being understood that
while von Moltke favored energetic
operations against the French center,
the emperor was strongly inclined toward
pushing the advance in the direction
of Calais.
As a result of this conflict of opinion,
it is said. Count von Moltke retired tc
take the cure at Homburg, being, however,
in actual need of medical attention.
Gen. von Falkenhayn then continued
the operations in Flanders under the
direction of the emperor, with results
which are described as not wholly
pleasing to the German public. Announcement
was made Ave days ago
that Gen. von Falkenhayn would remain
at the head of the general staff,
but that Count von Moltke might be
given another mission.
Criticised by Kaiser.
The plan of campaign of Count von
Moltke, as originally outlined, was to
advance on Paris as rapidly as possible,
and this led to the swift movei
ment toward the French capital by
~ Gen. von Kluck and Gen. von Hausen
? in August and September, which was
ended by the forced retreat to the
3 positions now occupied by the Gerf
mans in France. It is stated that fricl
tion between Emperor William and
Count von Moltke first occurred at this
s time, the emperor taking the ground
e that the move tactically was futile.
After the capture of Antwerp it was
von Moltke's desire, according to these
reports, to concentrate efforts upon the
Verdun?Toul line, while the emperor,
pointing to the possibility of an envel
-1? hv the allies of a
upuip; ? ?- ? - -?
break through the wedge which von
Moltke proposed to advance, favored
the continuation of operations against
the forces of the allies in Flanders.
This is the situation, it is now said,
which finally led to von Moltke's trip
to Homburg and the installation of von
Falkenhayn as chief of the general
staff.

MEASURES FOR DEFENSE
TO HAVE FEW CHANGES
Secretary of Wavy and Commander
Sterling to Appear Before Home
Committee Tomorrow.
Hearings on the preparedness of the
national defense have progressed far
enough at the Capitol for members of
the naval and military affairs committees
of the House to forecast that there i
will be very little change In the navy '
and army appropriation bills when
they are reported to the House. There
is little probability of a change of any
consequence in the navy building program,
and there is as little likelihood
at present of a change in the army program.
|
There Is, however, considerable I
chance that changes in the legislation !
concerning the personnel of the army
and navy will be offered either in the
appropriation bills or by special measures.
A navy personnel bill is slowly
developing in the naval committee, the
object being to shift grades and promotions
so that officers can arrive at
responsible positions before their age
begins to tell on their capabilities.
Secretary Daniels is expected before
the naval affairs committee again tomorrow,
and Commander Sterling, in
charge of submarines, will tell why
there is a shortage of these interesting
craft, and explain the troubles he has
with them.
Urge Preparedness.
Meantime the National Defense
Deague, whose officers include a number
of representatives in Congress, Is
conducting a propaganda to stimulate
preparedness. Representative Knowland
of California, a director Of the
league, in a statement yesterday pointed
out that wars come suddenly, that
jingo would have been a mild term to
have applied to the individual who a
year ago had predicted the present
European conflict. He contended that
the Mexican situation is more chaotic
today than at any period, and that
"the American people, while not favoring
militarism, do not favor unprepa
redness such as China presents." ?
He said the movement for international j
disarmament should be continued, but
national defense, meantime, strengthened.
He asserted that the coast defenses
were inadequate, and that the
general board's recommendation for
four battleships received but scant consideration.
War Strength of Europe
in Aircraft is Indicated
by Navy Department Report
The present strength in air warcraft
of the European countries is indicated
in official estimates submitted by the
Navy Department to the House naval
committee and made public yesterday.
It shows that Austria-Hungary thi3
month has 100 aeroplanes and S dlri
gibles; Belgium 60 aeroplanes, no dirigibles;
Great Britain 900 aeroplanes,
12 dirigibles; France, 1,400 aeroplanes,
30 dirigibles; Germany 1,400 aeroplanes,
60 dirigibles; Italy 300 aeroplanes,
4 dirigibles; Japan 20 aeroplanes,
2 dirigibles; Russia 1,000 aeroplanes,
20 dirigibles.
In a supplementary written statement
to the committee, Rear Admiral Victor
Blue, chief of the navigation bureau,
said the navy was suffering more from
a shortage of officers than from shortage
of men.
"There are altogether 4,565 men and
203 line officers short of the number
necessary to man 'the vessels of military
value which could be used in time
of war," the statement adds. "While
there is little doubt that this demand
would be met by the ex-service men
now in civil life, confusion and delay
would result unless an organization
was perfected prior to the outbreak of
war.
Supply Is Limited.
"Shortage of officers in the total required
is more serious than that of
men. It will necessarily be several
years before the requirements can be
met, as the supply of officers is regulated
by the Naval Academy yearly
output. From captain to admiral officers
are being promoted at an age that
will permit of very little service in the
latter grade before retirement. A
board which has been considering these
conditions is now preparing its re- 1
port." c
Of the expense of campaigns carried e
on across the water at any great dis- E
tance. Admiral Blue said:
"I worked out the figures some time
ago and found that in order to keep f
our fleet supplied with fuel and pro- a
visions while operating 5,000 to 6,000 r
miles from its base in the United d

Conference between governors of the o

Three reserve banks, those in Chi-"

have undertaken clearances to a

uled to report the middle of January. a
Although this committee Is expected to v
go into the question at clearings he- d
tween different reserve districts, it was o
i
he opinion in some quarters tonight
hat it also might report the observaions
of the workings of the three
tanks now engaged in partial clearng
house operations. In the meantime
t ip possible the board will not direct
my other reserve banks to begin clearngs.
It was pointed out last night that the
nembers of the governor's committee
tre for the most part from the larger
:ities. where the clearing house associations
are strong and where clearing
>rivileges mean much to banks. It
ias been asserted often in Congress
hat the larger banks are able to domllate
through clearing house associaions,
and officials are inclined to beieve
that many banks are loath to see
federal reserve banks take up this
vork.
No controversy developed, however, in
he sessions here. The opinions of
)oard members were reserved for the
future. In official circles no forecasts
were made as to how far the board
iltiraately would be willing to go in
his direction, possibly in opposition
:o the desire of many member banks.

Infantry Distinguishes Itself in
Terrific Battle for Ferryman's
House.
PARIS, December 12.?An official re>ort
of the principal happenings on the
>attle front from November 27 to December
5 has been given out in Paris,
t is, in part, as follows:
"The period between November 27 and
lecember 9 was not marked by operaions
of any great extent, but observa;ons
made during these days showed
hat along the entire front we had taken
he ascendant over the enemy, with our
irtillery as well as with our infantry.
The French artillery, without suffering
severely from the fire of the German
annon. was successful at a number of
joints in silencing batteries of the cn:my,
and even in demolishing several of
hem. Our infantry, showing a sustained
spirit of offense, made progress everywhere,
and at no point was this in'ar.try
progress followed by retirement.
"Several infantry engagements are
worthy of special mention. The engagement
which resulted in giving us
ffie house of the ferryman, the posiion
of which has been indicated in
jrevious official communications, was
jarticularly brilliant. Several German
:renches were occupied, one after the
>ther. The operation of which this
jrilliant feat of arms was an episode
was one of the most laborious accomjlished
by our troops. It was a ques:ion,
in short, of driving away from
he left bank of the Yser the Germans
who had succeeded in installing them elves
for a distance of 1,800 yards.
The main difficulty arose from the fact
hat the Yser canal is flanked at this
joint by an impassable swamp. As a
esult the attack could be made only
>y following along the bank df the
:anal and against a very narrow front,
furthermore, the right bank of the
:a.nal, where the enemy was Installed
it a distance of less than 150 yards,
lominates the left bank, which is unier
the fire of machine guns.
Germans Courag-eous.
"The assault on the house of the fer yman
was undertaken by a detachnent
of 100 volunteers from the Afri;an
battalions. Our soldiers fought in
:he water up to their waists, and in a
violent rainstorm. The Germans gave
jvidence of the greatest courage. Our
nen found it necessary to kill an ofIcer
and fifteen soldiers who refused
:o surrender. In the house of the ferryman,
now effectively arranged as a
field fort, we found thirty-five dead
nen, including two officers, who had
jeen killed by our howitzer shells. In
iddition we counted 200 German dead
it this place, scattered among the debris
of their machine guns.
"The French attack on tne park ana
the chateau of Verraelles was no less
remarkable. Two detachments of Algerian
cavalry, operating on foot,
armed with rifles and bayonets, together
with three companies of infantry.
were assigned to this operation.
"The morning of December 1 the
German forces, assailed from all sides,
led from the park, endeavoring vainly
:o screen themselves in the rooms of
he chateau. The next day, and the
lay following, every counter attack of
:he enemy was repulsed. One of our
pieces of artillery, audaciously rushed
:o the front, demolished several groups
>f houses which were serving as
jhelter for the Germans. Our infantry
:aptured during these days several
nachine gun carriages, a quantity of
ifles and war material of all kinds.
"Further to the south another attack
>n the town of Fay also served to give
>roof of the spirit with which our men
jndertook offensive operations. Novern>er
28 French troops reached the first
>arbed wire entanglements of the
snemy, and cut them with wire shears,
rhey at once intrenched themselves
n ground thus gained. All that night
he enemy did not cease a constant
usillade in our direction.
Continue Destruction.
"Our sharpshooters and our pioneers
levertheless continued the destruction
>f the wire entanglements of the
memy, making use of shears and
nelinite bombs. November 30, alter
taving been successful in passing the
irst set of entanglements, they found
. second series of wire defenses. By
ising hand grenades the Germans all
lay inflicted heavy losses on our men.
Notwithstanding this we were successul
in protecting and holding the conluered
ground, which represented an
dvance of 400 yards.
"Mention should be made also of the
lagnificent infantry engagements
vhich took place between November
8 and November 30, to the north of
Scurie. In the capture and the reapture
of a very strong system of
renches oUr soldiers gave evidence of
, courage and a tenacity that is above
,11 praise.
"The German general staff has
laimed that on December 1 it realized
very considerable success at the
urest of La Grurie. As a matter of
act, this success consisted in the blowig
up of a French trench, which had
>een mined by the Germans. The i
orapany of soldiers which occupied j,
riis xreiicu a.t liic tunc t?l mc
'as almost annihilated, but the compaies
nearby retained their position in
heir trenches, thanks to the successful
utcome of a hand-to-hand fight, and
re succeeded in re-establishing- our
ne in a new trench, exactly twentyix
yards back from the trench detroyed
by the enemy.
French Take Crest.
' On December 2 we took possession
t a point to the south of the Col du
tonhomme of Mount Tete de Vaux, on
tie crest of which the enemy had es- :
iblished an artillery observation point *
rom which he dominated the upper '
alley of the Muerthe. Our cavalry- 1
?en were successful in taking possesion
of the crest in two hours, but !
ley suffered very serious losses. The
pirit with which they entered this ;
ght was magnificent. The trumpets
minded the charge, and our men went
jrward singing the Marseillaise.
"One of them carried a flag, and he
lanted it on the summit of the moun- 1
ain. 1
"To the northwest of Senones, near s
.a Mere Henri, all the counterattacks
f the Germans were repulsed. It is at
his point that we retained possession
f a blockhouse less than thirty feet ]
istant from the trenches of the
nemy. The French sergeant and the J
our men who have taken up their (
ositions in this blockhouse are kept
upplied with food by their comrades {
i the following manner:
"Loaves of bread are hollowed out 1
nd inside is placed meat or cans of
rater. Then at certain times of the 1
ay these food projectiles are thrown 1
ver the walls into the blockhouse." j

44 VICTORIA X O HIERTA." j
VERA CRUZ, December 12.?"If the
United States employs force to atop the
firing by Mexicans across the international
boundary line at Naco it will be
considered an unfriendly act, notwithstanding:
the friendly motives cloaking:
the act."
In this manner Gen. Carranza made
answer in a statement to the Associated
Press to the formal notice
served by the United States on both
Provisional President Gutierrez and
Gen. Carranza that unless such firing
ceased force would be employed to protect
American territory.
Carranza's reply to the American
note, which is expected to reach Washington
tomorrow*, is in general a repudiation
of responsibility for any
shots that have crossed the line, and
clearly sets forth that he and his government
will regard intervention at
Naco as hostile and unfriendly.
Is Not Perturbed.
At no time since the receipt of Secretary
Bryan's note, in which attention
was called to the repeated wounding
and killing of residents of the
town on the northern side of the line,
has Gen. Carranza appeared perturbed
"Gen. Hill, who is commanding the
constitutionalist forces at Naco, is on
the defensive," continued Gen. Carranza,
"and since his back was to the
line it Is difficult to see how he could
be responsible for the firing in question.
The fact is that Maytorena's inen
have been the attacking party, and
therefore it appears reasonably clear
that they, and only they, could have
been to blame.
"As a matter of fact. I do not know
that the rights of American citizen*
have been violated. It seems to me
that it would be well for the State Department
to investigate this question
in order to fix the responsibility.
"As to the use of force, of whic
Mr. Bryan talks, that is something the
gravity of which I fear he does no*,
fully appreciate. He says it would
not mean an invasion of our territory
nor a violation of our national sovereignty.
It would. And moreover, it
would certainly be an act directl
against the constitutionalists, who now
hold the town, and in favor of the
Villistas. who would be left free to
continue their operations. It would he
simply tieing Gen. Hill's hands and
leaving Maytorena free."
Street car service in Vera Cruz ha?= '
been suspended by military order, the
authorities taking the stand that the
lives of pedestrians were endangered
by incompetent men who were hired to
replace regular employes after a dis
pute regarding salaries.
EL PASO, Tex.. December 12. -A second
warning from the Washington government
to Gov. Maytorena was received
here today, demanding that
Maytorena withdraw immediately from
the range of the American border
town.
NACO, Ariz.. December 12.?Jose
Maytorena. insurgent governor of
Sonora. who has been besieging the
Carranza garrison of Naco, Sonora.
since September, issued a statement today
declaring that he had received no
order from Provisional President
Gutierrez to stop firing in order to prevent
bullets striking in American territory.
Until he does receive such orders
he will continue his attack. He
is preparing for a final assault on
Naco Tuesday night.
Americans arriving here from Cananea
reported today that W. G. M cDuffe,
who operated an automobile
stage between the border and Cananea.
was arrested by Mexican officials Dt
cember 8 and is held incommunicado.
The case has been reported to Fredei ick
Simpioh, American consul at Nogales,
Sonora.
Brig. Gen. Tasker H. Bliss, commander
of the United States troops
here, revoked tonight all passes fo*
crossing the international line.
Gen. Bliss, it was stated, intended to
break up repeated efforts of both
Mexican factions to send agents into
Arizona for recruits and supplies.
The belligerents were as acti\e as
usual tonight in exchanging shots. Gen.
Hill received today two seventy-fivemillimeter
maxim guns, which were
placed in position after dark.
.State Department officials were satisfied
last night that orders from Provisional
President Gutierrez to desist
from his attack on Naco would reach
Gov. Maytorena in ample time to prevent
his carrying out his intention of
resuming operations Tuesday night. A
