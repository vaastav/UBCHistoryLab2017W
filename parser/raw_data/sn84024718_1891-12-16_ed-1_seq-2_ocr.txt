So Occasion lor War-
President Harrison's rather aggressive,
not to say menacing, tone in dealing with
the Chilian question in his message to Con
gress has called from the Chilian Minister
of Foreign Affairs a.circular letter to the
legations of that country in Europe.
The New York Herald of tho 13th inst,
publishes this document, and says of it
that, "in a less bellicose spirit than that of
the President's message it claims that the
Chilian side of the matter has been mis
represented, not only by sensational de
spatches to the jingo press, and especially
London papers, but also by official state
ments sent to Washington.
There is no telling what may result from
this unfortunate controversy if either side
acts rashly or obstinately. But there is no
necessity or occasion for a breach of the
friendly relations between the two coun
tries, and there will be none if common
sense, moderation and patriotism prevail on
both sides.
Controversies of this kind are common.—
We have had several with China. We
bave had them with Great Britain and
Spain. We now have one on hand witb
Italy. Ail have been amicably settled ex
cept tbe last, and that is on the highwaj
to settlement. .There is no reason why the
present Chilian dispute should prove ar
exception.
Chili oan well afford to make an apology
to the United States and offer to pay an in
demnity, and its government will aot un
wisely if it fails to do so. Under the cir
cumstances it can take this course grace
fully and without any sacrifice of national
honor or dignity. It can justly and witb
credit disavow the Valparaiso affair, be
cause, in the language ot Senor Matta's
ciroular to the Chilian legation abroad, it
"took place in a bad quarter of tbe city,
the 'maintop of Valparaiso,' and among
people who are by no means models of dis
cretien and temperance;" and becanse at
that time the nation was without a per
manent government, the people were ex-
Pand a condition of affairs bordoiiog
taking this wise course Chili would
ie following the example set by the
d States. When China called us to
account for tbe Chinese outrages in tbe
West our government deprecated their oc
currence and volunteered an indemnity,—
So also Italy was informed that the gov
ernment deplored the New Orleans out
break, and was given to understand that
Congress wonld provide for an indemnity
if justice demanded it.
While it would be a mistake for Chili no'
to take this coarse, it would be equally nn
wise for the administration at Washington
to enter upon a rash policy which might in
volve the country in war. It is to be re
membered that Chiii bas been racked by
internal war, her government overthrown,
her people harassed. Ii) is also to be re
membered that in her struggle she bad
much ground for real or fancied grievance
against the United States. Our Minister
was an unconcealed partisan of the hated
Baimacedan regime, against which the
people rose in aims. Onr Legation wa.
turned into an asylum for supporters of the
overthrown dictator. Oar naval force
there, as tbe Chilians complainod, did not
maintain that strict nentrality demanded
S.tional law and courtesy. Finally,
;ealcus seizure of the Itata was
illegal acd unwarranted by our
iary.
Ie all this does not justify or ex
ttack on the men of the Balti
le streets of Valparaiso. But it
d good reason why the present
y should be conducted with
n, patience and magnanimity,
i wise course be pursued it can
lead to a settlement satisfactory
able to both nations,
r Mr. Harrison or Secretary
the republican party may feel,
believe that the American peo
enjoying the blessings of peace,
and oontentment, are eager to
unnecessary war npon a small
pnblic at tho imminent risk of
jto serious trouble with one or
jpean Powers. President Harri
io himself more credit and the
i greater service by successfully
ith the issue diplomatically than
g the matter before Congress in
special message."
GOV. McKINNEY AND THE OYSTER
Interest.—On Wednesday last, the 9tb
inst., Gov. Mclvinney sent a special mes
sage of somo length to the Legislature on
the oyster interests of the State. The
message is accompanied by a bill, the
passage of which, tbe Governor thinks, will
effectually protect the oyster interests and
largely increase the State's revenues. Tbe
Governor thicks "the hope of tbe oyster i:
Virginia is in tbe planter, who should be
offered reasonable inducements, because he
produces and protects." Governor Mc-
Eincey says tbe Legislature should not
pass any law which violates the compact
entered into by the State of Maryland and
Virginia on the 28th of March, 1785, or
any existing laws of either States, "but if
on consideration, the Legislature deem it
best tbat any of tbe agreements existing
between the States should be repealed or
modified, there should be a conference
asked, and such action should be taken a.
will be best for tbe interests of both
States."
West Virginia's World's Fair Build
ing.—Mr. Wm. N. Chancellor, one of tbe
World's Fair commissioners for West Vir
ginis, says tbat tbe plans sbow up hand
somely and give a comprehensive idea of
what the representative building of tbat
State will look like at the World's Fair
There wil' be ample room in the building,
and all the apartments are conveniently ar
ranged. On tbe first floor there will be
two spacious parlors on either side 33 by 34
feet. Tbe verandas on either side wi) l
have a radius of 23 feet and 8 inches. There
will also be two committee rooms on tbr
first floor, 12 feet 4 inches by 12 feet 6
inches. There will also be spacious ball
ways, alcoves and toilet rooms on tbif
floor. On the second floor there will be a
large assembly hall, 33 fret by 77 feet and
4 inches, and two committee rooms and
several smaller apartments. The building
throughout is most conviently arranged.
Tbe wife and infant obild of Albert Cole
man, colored, Vicksburg, Miss., were
asleep batuiday nith', wben some un
known person entered ibe bouse and poured
molten lead in ber ear and spattered a large
quantity of it on tbe child. Tbe woman's
ear is burned out mid rb<> physicians tbink
she will die. Tbe child is terribly burner),
bat may recover.
STAUNTON SPECTATOR AND GENERAL ADVERTISER —
Optimistic Message.—The Baltimore
Sun says that there is a fine flavor of
political optimism, not to say a tono of self
oomplaoency, pervading the whole of tbe
President's message, and that in view of
the fact that within a few months the
national convention ofthe republican party
will assemble, and that a few months later
the presidential election will take place,
the message is undoubtedly a olever and
ingenious production. It is not unjust to
say that both those events were clearly
present to the mind of the writer. It is an
elaborate attempt to show that there can
be no possible jastification for a change of
administration when everything is going
on so nicely and the whole country is pros
pering under the present Executive. It is
a plausibly-urged bid for a renomination —
a cleverly-conceived campaign document
for tbe republican party.

Suit foe Heats- Damages.—The Rock
bridge News says that the Peyton Camp
bell company, proprietors of the Rook

Killed at Lowmoob. —The Valley Vir
ginian says that "Mr. C. R. Sheppard, an
old gentleman seventy years of age, living
at Lowmoor, lost his life on the track at
that place about three o'clock last Saturday
week. The old gentleman was crossing
the track, which is a double one, in front
of a train. In order to avoid a train he
stepped from the track he was on, but only
in time to be struck by an engine on the
other, which he did not see. He was in
stantly killed, his skull being badly
crushed."
Arm Amputated.—The Greenbrier (W.
Va.) Independent says that on Thursday,
the 3rd Inst., "Mr. John Hedrick, of Irish
Corner district while clearing the sawdust
out of the pit of a saw-mill while the same
was running, accidentally threw his left
•inn against the teeth, which so badly lace
rated it that amputation was necessary.—
Dr. C. W. Miller, of Alderson, performed
the operation, taking tbe arm eft above
the elbow. Mr. Hedrick is a young man,
about 25 years old, acd is a son of Mr.
Sam'l Hedriok, who lives near Fort Spring
depot."

Horrible Tragedy.
A few days ago, Mr. Frank Paokwood,
who lives in Florida between Smyrna and
Oak Hill in Florida, about' 7 miles from

all the members of bis household were
horribly and brutally murdered, some being
shot in the bead acd others having bad
their throats cut. This horrible scene of
murder was discovered at 10 o'clock on
Saturday morning. Tbe murdered were
Mrs. L. D. Hatch, formerly of Maine and
her younger son, Miss Adalaide Bruce, of
New York oity, and Frank Packwood, Jr.
Great excitement prevails, and hundred*

Location of Courthouse Changed.
The Courthouse of Pocahontas county,
W. Va., will in future ba at tbe new town
ot Marlinton instead of Honlersville, as
heretofore, the question having been settled
by popular vote, with about three-fourths
of the vote in favor of the chauge of loca
tion. The new location is more central
than the old, and it will be an important
paint on the projected railroad. Now
there will ba a boom at Marlinton and prop
erty will go up, and speculation will be
rife, and some will make and others will
lose. Those who own property there now
will be greatly benefitted.

A Romance in Real Life.—A romance
in real life became public in Tacoma, State
of Washington, a few days ago, wheu Wil
liam Lurty, clerk of the municipal court,
was quietly married to Lucy H. Lurty.—
Once before, away back In Virginia, in the
year 1878, these same parties were united
in marriage and three children were bore
to them. The marriage proved unhappy,
however, and in 1887, one year after their
coming to Tacoma, they separated by mu
tual oonsent and were divorced in tbe dis
trict court, though Mr. Lurty continued to
provide for the mother and children and
was an occasional visitor at their home. —
Last April Mrs. Lurty and her children re
turned to Virginia. They stayed but four
months. Returning to Tacoma, they were
established in a snug home on the hill pro
vided by Mr. Lurty, and the marriage last
Friday reunited the family. Mrs. Lurty
was Miss Lucy Davidson, daughter of the
late James G. Davidson of Rockbridge
oounty, Va.
They resided in Harrison',nr_; for a nnrn
ber of years, during wbich peri d Mr. Lur
ty was cleik of the U. S. District Court for
this District.

Speaker Chas. F. Crisp wag a Soldier in
the Stonewall Brigade.
Tbe able and distinguished gentleman
recently elected Speaker of the House of
Representatives was a gallant solider in the
Stonewall Brigade. He volnnteered in
Page oounty, Va., when about 16 years of
age, and was a member of Capt. R. S.
Parks' company "X" in the 10th Virginia
infantry Regiment. His condnot at the
battle of McDowell whan his Captain was
, shot down is related by Capt. Parks as
given by a Richmond correspondent of tbe
Baltimore 'San', under date of Dec. 3th, as
follows:—
"Captain Parks of Luray, who command
ed Company X, Tenth Virginia Infantry,
in which Hon. Charles F. Crisp, the Speak
er of the House of Representatives, served
durirg the war, is here today looking after
tbe oandidacy of judge of Shenandoah
county to be elected by the Legislature.—
The Captain tells how Mr. Crisp, who was
a mere strippling, weighing little more
than a hundred pounds, probably saved tbe
former's life at tbe battle of McDowell in
the mountains of Viiginia in 1862. In that
engagement tbe Captain was wounded and
could not get eff the field. Private Crisp
undertook to carry bim to a place of safety,
but finding the burden too great bad to
place bim upon the ground. The young
fellow determined to save his commander's
l'-fe, threw himself in front of him to shield
him from the perfect storm of bullets and
shells that were Hying and whipping over
that part of tbe field. After tbe conflict
was over Captain Paiks was removed to a
place of safety, where his wound was treat
ed. Some years after the war Captain
Parks called upou bis friend Crisp in Wash
iogton and introdnced himself. Tbe inci
dent of the battle of MoDowell was of
course tbe chief topic between tbe two gen
tlemen while together."

ENSLIBH BONDHOLDERS WILL NOT AGBEE
to the settlement.—lt teems that the
English holders of Virginia bonds are op
posed to th. settlement agreed upon by the
Ole ott Committee. This is to be regretted,
both on account of the interests of the
bondholders and cf those of tbe Slate. It
wonld be bad for both not to have this
matter settled now.
A from London dated, Deo.
13th says;—
"The L>ndon advisory board of Virginia
State debt bondholders bave declined to re
commend that the holders accept the Ame
rican committee's scheme for tbe settle
ment nf claims against Vugiuia. The Lon
don committee have c invoked a meeting to
decide on a course of action. Meanwhile a
section of the bondholders representing
bonds amounting to five millions will ao
cept the Amerioan committee's scheme in
prinoiple, hoping to get modifications."
Cruelty to Animals.—The Mayor and
magistrates are to be oommended for
promptly inflicting tbe penalties of the law
upon any person who bas beeu proven guil
ty of cruelty to animals. There is no ex
cuse for this form of crime, and tbe only
pity is tbat tbe law, —the general sentiment
of the people—oaunot reach it, aud punish
it more effectively.— Lynchburg Advance.
We heartily endorse tbe sentiment ex
pressed above and say "Ditto to Mr.
Burke." A man who is cruel to animals
is beneath and more of a brute than tbe
animal he abuses, and should be severely
punished. It is low, mean, and cowardly,
and the man who would do It is the bond
slave of his satanio majesty, and 'deserves
to be kicked t > death by blind mules, or to
be confined In a kennel of mad dogs, or to
be ever kept from sleeping by a concert of.
