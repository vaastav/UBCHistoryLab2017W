dred millions of dollars.
He negotiated with the associated banks
to the eastward two loans of fifty millions
each, on the condition that they were to be
reimbursed, as far as practicable, from the
amounts to be subscribed by individuals to
the national loan, based on an issue for three
years of Treasury notes bearing an interest
for that period of 7.30 per cent., which bonds
were subsequently to be merged into stock
of the United States. A third loan was ne
gotiated for fifty millions with the same par
ties in November last, by agreeing to issue
to them fifty millions of dollars in six per
cent, bonds at a rate equivalent to par for the
bonds bearing seven per cent, interest. The
amount of demand notes put into circulation
up to the 30th of November last is stated to
be rather over twenty-one millions of dol-
S u 't. The aggregate realized from loans in
ious forms is said to be one hundred and
ety-seven millions two hundred and fifty
two thousand five hundred and eighty-ehrht
dollars.
The receipts from customs for the past fis
cal year have dsappointed expectations. He
estimated the receipts at fifty-seven millions
jof dolla.-s-tbe returns show but thirty-two
milhons-but including the direct tax of
i twenty millions, and minor sources of reve
j nue, the aggregate revenue, it is supposed,
will amount to some fifty-four and a half
j millions of dollars. In view of the increas
|mg demands upon the Treasury, he urges
j retrenchment aud reform in every depart
ment of the government.
He suggests the propriety of depriving the
banks of the country of the authority to cir
culate notes of their own issue, and to sub
stitute in their stead notes issued by the gov
ernment. Two plans for accomplishing this
are suggested. Ist. By a gradual withdraw
al from circulation of the notes of corpora
tions, and of the issue in their stead of Uni
ted States notes payable in coin on demand.

shaH distribute the notes of the bank to lo*
cal banking institutions, to be secured by the
pledge of United States bonds. He favors
the adoption of the second plan.
An i ncreaße of the dire<jt tax to
millions for the loyal States is regarded as
absolutely necessary, as is also duties on
| stdls, distilled liquors, tobacco, bank notes,
i carriages, legacies, .paper evidences of debt
I and instruments for conveyance of property'
and other like subjects of taxation. The
proposed income tax, it is suggested, shall
