A Balck of Coanterfeil.
A bask officer has submitted to ns a batch of
counterfeit Treasury notes which wore stopped
yesterday. Tksy were from Kentucky, and, as
it is possible ethers may find their way out
hero, it will be well te call attention to 'them.
All these counterfeits are wood engravings with
printed signatures and tailing.
Anyone conversant with printing will easily
detect them, and any typo may do the earns by
noticing the irregularity ef tho script, which
cannot be as woll made upon wood as on copper
plate or stone. In these bills the words "Six
months" after the ratification of a treaty of
peace, etc., are much'her.vier, and in more irreg
ular characters than the genuine. Wherever
there is a doubt, a comparison here will detect
wood cut counterfeits to a certainty.
The 100 in this cue is a clear open liie en
graving, fighter and better shaded than the gen
uine Hoyer &. Ludwig. All the filling is printed
in, and note that the characters in writing are
larger, bolder and more irregular than the good
bill.
There a.e three different kinds of twenties
two of Hoyer & Ludwig, to which the same re
mark offers the most ready clue to detection. A
third in colors resembling tho good bill, but nolo
that the red ground in the centre of the bill is
made ap ef mere shading, while in tho genuine
it is composed of tbo word " twettty " many
times repeated.
So of the tens tho ground work is mere
shading wbtie that ef the genuine is msde up of
the word "ten" repeated.
Tho fives, green and black, are too coarse-and
badly printed to deceive anybody.
Wo repeat that everybody should narrowly
examine all notes tendered to them. Mncon

" a case in short hand," the New York Express
quite as pithily answers- the Tribune's pith:
The Tribune is pithily showing the cane as of
the war, and th&t great cause te bo " slavery,"
thus sums up: '
1. Xne rebellion bas broken out only in tbe
slave States.
A mistake. It first broke out in Massachu
setts, which nullified, the .Constitution ef the
United States and tho laws of Congress in so
called personal bills j
2. It commenced in South Carolina, tbe most
intensely pro slavery of them all, and mastered
State aftir Stale In exact proportion to their in
terest in and devotion to slavery.
Another mistake ! It began in Boston in
rescues from United States marshals in Syra
cuse, in the Jerry rescue case In Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, in tbe Booth case

Strength of the EsEitr'a E toiM ekts
The fiichmond Enauirer. of a lato date, says :
A gentleman who had the opportunity made
observations which enabled him to make a near
approximation to tho strength of Sumner's army
corps when it masoned for Fredericksbnrg. He
counted the men lu many of the regiments as
they marched past Tho regimonts of new
troona were verr full: but the old regiments
were so thin, that ,an average strength of four
hundrodUo a regiment, is an allowance rather in
excess of fact, Sumner's corps comprised thirty
rotrlmiwitn. which nnts, his stroneth at twtlre
thousand men. JIa had a krgo supply of artil-
8rf3ur informant noticed that one of tho new
regiments armed with guns that hid not lost
the first freshness of tho varnish was followed
by a guard with fixed bayonets, and the regulars
were nlaeed in the rear ot the column. ""It was

lorce and potency at tbis time. We most carnt
estly command thorn to tho attention of all thoso
who wish to ston a useless effusion ot oiooa
and restore the Union as it was framod by our
patriotic fathers.
Clearfield, Px, Novombor 1st, 1862.
Dear 6rR : In reply to your favor of tho'
30th ultimo, I have to say that you hsvo beori
nrbtly informed, .1 do not iutond to bs a can
didats for Unnrd States Senator at tbe coming,
election, anil have 'tf& expressed -myself to
friends on all proper occasions. I hare a num
her of reasons, public and -p'rivato, for this
coarse, one of which Is that the .Eastern and
Northern sections of the State make speciat
claim to toe senator, at this time, on tbo ground
that we nave ono in the West, rccantlv elected,
and cannot reasonably claim both for bo ion? a
term.
The other asestion von ait. " what can bo
doae to save the country T " is not so eorilv an
swered. Th usual rsponso is, " God knows.'
Few of our best thinkers seam to have any
clear yiows on tho question ; and it is not even
cMtaiu that the adminstration at Washington
has a well dslintd policy to that end. I have
some thoughts on thosubjsct. which I do not
hesitate to eivo von. Thev raav seem to be
crude, and on soma points oven novel and
startling; bat they ara tho result of some re
flection. The sword is tho onlv atrencv at work. But
the sword cannot do aU. Ilia an azent of de
struction. It can tear down, but cannot build
up. It may ch&stiso and sileneo the rebels in
tbo neld, but it cannot make a umen of States,
it cannot restore confidence and fraternity
among a people estranged and alienated from
each othjr. IF the war was against tho leaders
in the South only, as many at the besinnintr
supposed, then tho sword might pat thorn down,
and the-masses return to their alleeiaueo. But'
tbe conilic'. turns out to be with the whole mass
Of the people within the revolted States, old and
young, mle and fomale, numbering many ail
lions. With such a posror, sooner or later, wo
shall have to treat and -negotiato. Tho iword
alone will never restoro this people to the Union.
ion welt enow that when the present calami
ties menaced tho- nation, I was for peaceful
racn3 to avert tho blow. Thoa our present
suffering and sacrifices could have been avoided,
and, as I believe, the unity of tho States pre
served for generations, without tho sacrifice of
principle, or honor, or conscience on either side ;
passion, prejudice and fanaticism only would
nave been required te give way; and-1 still
think, nuy, I Am sure, that .other means beside
war aro cecessary to save onr country our
whole country from present afflictions and im
pending ruin.
I know how easy it is to talk about war and,
carnage; about stratagotic positiors and bril
bant victories ; about tho prompt subjugation of
the Sjuth by the North ; even how pleasant it
may ha to some to float in the common current
of excitement and pajsion ; and especially how
unpleasant, if not unsafe, it is to stem this tide.
Bat the time is coming, if it be not now, when
the public man who would render his country
a substantial service must do this. He must
look at the whole work beforo us, and strike for
the right, regardless of clamor or consequence
to himself personally.
We hate had the warfor eljhteea month the like of
whlci the rorW haijHora wUaeiaed before, loiacto.in:
riwca naiwnai aeoi oi ii&rtucg magtutade, wtuca
mnit hrac orer potterity tons Into the future, has aU
ready been created, and more than a qnarter of a mlt
Jln of invaluable Urea saenCctd. en the Union stdo
clone. In addition to the many tioniindi that bare been
crippled or diteaaed far life; aadyat Utile, tf any, anb
itanUal progTeia haa been made In the food wort of ret
eitabtiahinff the Union, or eren of maintaining thsfed--eral
authority vrithin the roToltod State. Haa not,
then, the experiment of war, as a maana of extrlcAting
the country from the present deplorable 'condition, been
already tested tested at least to such an extent m to
prove ltintter futility, unaldad by other meant.
It was a happy thought cf President Lincoln, ex
pressed In his Inaugural, that If we want to war we could
not ficht always j "and when, after much less on both
aides, and no gela on e ier, you cease fl jhtlnr, the ldn
tical old questions as to -wnns of lntereaurre ara epalu
upenyon." Thia prophetlo and highly significant sen
Uinent shows that erect Mr. Lincoln, before the war be
gan, anticipated the tlms, In case It did begin, when It
would be neeesiary to put the sword to rest, at leaitfer
a season. In order te resume the identical old qneslIons
about intercourse and settlement. It does not teem to
hare occurred to him that the sword eould do the whole
work, but thattnetiuby we woul hare to com a back
to the original peint, to compromise and sett!. If, then,
we cannot figh- always, what amount of fighting Js ns
cessary to maice it proper to prepare to eeaae or autpend,
In order to consider taraa of reconciliation t Thtre has
already "been much lost on both sides, and ne gain on
either," and. whilst the time to cease fighting may not
be yet, the period has surely come when other means
besides the sword should be employed In the effort to
sare the government and country.
Ortalnly the object of the war, and the extent to
which It is to go should be defiantly known to the coun
try. If I be intended to sabngate the States In rebel
lion and hold them, not as States la -the Union, but as
conquered provinces then the sword must be kept la
constant molfou, and war and carnage must be the order
of the dsy. Xew la r lei and fresh supplies may be
p-oprly raised, for it will require a formidable' army in
each ef the aeeadad States to execute and maintain this
scheme. If extermination be (he object, then the sword
should haTe unn-stralned lleenis to deal death and de.
Btructkm among the rebels In M parts of their country,
reeardlcFa of sex, age or condition. But neither of these
jurpesef, if practicable, would re establish th Union,
aiinougn mere wouja remain n union composed oi cer
tain States. Hut, whan the Union Is re-establlthed, the
South as well as the North must be lull; the fatally of
the Sta'es must exist as heretofore, else It will not be the
Union about whieh we have talked so much, and for
whieh so many Brave men have offered np th6lr llyes.
'ine pnyiieai inumpn oi xne norm orer me rjeutn, in
the field, as tbe North, In the end, may triumph, la not
me wnoie oi me tasic ine estates must b Drought to
gether; the feelings of the peop'e of both seasons must:
be so constrained and moderated that thev ean fratarnlr-e
aad lire together, else the Union is gone forerer.. To
subjugate tne saytnem states, and s bold them, eeuld
subserve no good end to either section, and In so way,
that I can discover, advance thVeifare of the North;
for, si lone as the South was so held, their hate of the
North would Increatei and, whilst the North n held the
South. It eould do but little else : meanwhile l's material
Interests must languish, and d e. But, in addition, such
a work It utterly inconsistent with the genius of our In
ttltutions, and eould scarcely fait to lead to their nttar
Derrarsisfli and ultimate overthrow, addinc to the calam
ities of disunion, the sacrifice of free government. Con
quest and erap're, however magnificent, could not com.
pensate for such a last.
To exterminate the Inhabitants of the South would be
a deliberate emasculation of the Union, rendering its re
construction at ones jmpraeueaoie ana Hopeless, ana
would Involve a work of barbarity from whieh the
Northern Dconle would shrink In horror. The existence
of the Southern States, in some form, with their Inhabi
tants, and on some terms of Intercourse, Is algfaly essen.
tlaL nay, I will sty, lad'spansable tq the welfare qfhe
Xorth. I am, therefore, against extermination, anq
against the pouay oi noiaing me soumern states as eon
quered provinces. (This ground can be to easily main,
talned on purely selfish considerations for the North,
which wilt oceur to all, and I need not trouble yod with
their prestntaUon on this occasion. I am for re-establishing
tbe Union as It was, or making a Union as similar as
practicable, the States to be equals, and to be sovereign
to the extent the States now , eaeh ' hTB aad enjoy
such domcstle Institutions as U may ehoqse, and, Vfere I
tn Congress, I would' ustala that measure of war, and
that only, that would clearly tend to theaeeomiUsbnient
or meseenos; dui nq war ot cuojugauon or extermina
tion. I know that It may be tId In reply to all this, then let
the Southern people lay down their arms and come back
tnto the Union, and all will be right again. Would to
Uod tbey eould lit induced so to do I There is no
guarantee in reason that I would not be willing to grant
them.' But do we see any Indications of such a return
to reason and duty t I can see none, and I expect to tee
none, so lo'ng at tho sword Is unaccompanied, by agents
for settlement and ptace. When our army went to Uex;
leo It was accompanied by a peace commission in order
to embrace the earliest dpperruclty for settlemeat In
God's came, I would aaV, ahould we do less when en
gnged In a war amongst ourselves t It it idle, and worse
than idle, to delude ourselves about the nature of the
conflict la which we are engaged. Wecarjuot m,a!r.o a

The French Proposals of Mediation in- Foreign

The. following it the despatch of the Kranoh mlnistor

France at-London and St-Pe'erjburg:
Paris. October 30, 18S2 Eprppe watahej with pain
ful Interest the struggle which has ben raging more
than a year upon th American continent. The bos I ill
tics have provoked sacrifices and efforts certainly of a
nature to inspire the Mghest idea of the perseverance
and energy of the two population. Bet thia apeotae'e,
whieh does so much honor to t elr courage, It only given
at the prlt efnamberleas calamities arid a prodigious ef
fusion ef bleod. To these results of civil war, which,
from the very first, assumed vast proportions, there is
atilllo be added the apprehension of servile war, which
would b the culm'nating point of so many irreparable
disasters. The snffartng of a nation toward which we
have always professed a sincere friendship, would have
snutces to excite tne sincere solicitude or the Emperor,
even tladwe oursclvet not suffered by the counter blow
cf these evetts
"Under the Influence of Intimate relations which ex
tensive Intercourse has nnlllplid between the various
regions of the globe, Europe Itsalf has suffered from the
consequences of the en'sli, which has dried Up one of the
cost fruitful sources of public wealth, and whieh has be-'
come, for the great centers of labor, a cause of most sad
trial.
At you are aware, when the .conflict commenced, we
lield It our duty to observe the most strict neutrality In
eoneert with other maritime powers, and th Washing,
ton Cabinet has repeatedly acknowledged the honorablo
manier with which we adhered to that line ef conduct.
The tantlmentt dictated to us have undergone no chaaga
but f a benevolent eb-' cter. That neutrality, Instead
of Imposing upon the poweri the attitude which might
resemble Indlffsrer.ee, eqght rather to make them of ser
vice to the two parties by helping them out of a position
whieh seems to have no issue.' From the eomraoneement
of the war an armed force was set on foot by the bellig
erents, which, since then, has been almest cnstaitly
kept up. After so much bloodshed they are now iuthat

tb presumption that more) deelslve military operations
will shortly occar.-accordlag to the last news receiyed Ir)
Europe. The two 'armies, on tho contrary, yj-cro Ju a
condition that would not allo-jf either party to bop
within a brf&f delay fir any decided advantage to turn
the balance and accelerate the conclusion of a peace,
AU these circumstances, taken together, point to -tbe op
portunity of an armistice, to which, moreover, under the
present circumstances, no strategical objection can be
made. ,
The favorable dispositions toward peace which are
beginning to manifest themselves in tho North as well as
the South might; on the other hand, seeocd. (es that
might be mada te recommen d the idea of truce. The
Emperor ban (bought that the occasion has presented
Itself of offering to th belligerents tbe support of the
good ofllces-ef the maritime powers, tnd"hls Majesty has
charged me to make the proposition of this governmant
to her Britanle Majesty, as well as to the court of Rus
sia. The IhraecablneU would exert their Influence 9;
Washington, as well as with the Confederates, to obtain
an annistlee for li; m&nths, during whieh every act of
war, direat or Indirect, should provisionally cease, on
sea as well as on Und, and it might be, if ncemry,
ulterforally prolonged.
The overtures, I need not say. sir, wonld-not iaply, on

Theto-lsimuch food for reflection in the fol
lowing article which we clip from thilJichmona
Examiner of the 5th lust. : There an be no
doubt but that the enemy" are concentrating the
greater portion of their energies or the occupa
tion of tho Mississippi Valleyduriug the winter
and spring. Having tbis iii 'their possession,
the Confederacy will bsrent is twain, and it
well bohooves bout tbo government; and the
peopl'o to look tho danger in the face and to pre
paro for it. The Emmuttr. says :
Although the Southern States have -little roa
son to be afraid of aught tho enemy can do' to
their detriment at the present moment, or duriDg
tho t wo month Io come, they should notforget
that preparations have been made, toil are still
makiag, for their subjugation ono far greater'
scalothan ever before. Tho United Statoa ia
.about to put forth an effort of invasion far ex
ceeding any we have, yet resisted. Bitrnside's
advance upon Fredericksburg-, HkerMsCIellan's
reviews at Centerville last winter, is'onlya tub
thrown out to amuse iho popular whale. To
ward the close of this wintor tho mot t gigantic
arnvr over seen in modem times will bs actually
ready to advance upon us. Whatever maybe
the fate of the Bifrnside oxpeditiori ; whatever
chances may occar in tho political relations of
theXJnios, and whatever may be the comnj'er
cial and financial disturbance, nethicjj now can
prevent that army from being set upon "us, and
that advance actually occurring.
Fiom the beginning of this War, tbo forces V
the Confederacy have been mansgod, more or
less, in accord with tho supposition that the, war
would virtually end in sixty days more Jlxpe.
dienls for tho moment, without fore tijjht for the
futuro, have once 01 twico nearly ruined tho
Southern Confederacy; and, on this occasion,
its organization will be most probably destroyed,
unless effectual provision is mtde at once
ogainst the great danger which approaches with
tho slow but suro tread of irresistible fao.
We havo perhaps two mqnths oj wearily and
opportunity 8,tijl left for preparation. Tho ox
jstonco of th's Confederacy depends ontirely
upon tbo condition of tho Southern army at the
end of those two months. If at thq ond of that
time, the men already enlisted are, k large part,
rambling about in a stato ef scmi-d-aertion, or
at their homes on surreptitious furloBgb.QracaU

lot day or this interval that ntrw passes is
not more important than any battlo which has
yet been .fought. Every day of this interval
listlessly,, occupied in listening to bows and
speculating on the duration of fca wr i Jiot
less to ba deplored. than any defeat yet suffered
by the Southern armies. Now ij the time for
the Confederate authority to mtko. its greatest

i.bere was a tims whoru we slioWa have bad so
hesitation in taking tho , popular side cf this
question ; but that time lias passed, and the cir
cumstances which would have influenced our
decision no longer exist.
While it is probable that suck a movement,
under the right military auspices,, would have
be;n crowned with mccess, still we aro now
satisfied that, under tho circumi'tancss.'lt Is not
a safe move-, aad, therefore, notawkeono. Thk
may be easily determined by a tritemilitary
maxim ot universal odd ication. It will ho
found in tho edllecfion of maxims oT Naboleon.
republished jn this country under the nsph:eV
of Lleatenant-General Scott, and h from Slonte.
cueulli, ono of the greatest military, authorities
of the ago. It is to this effect : " That the cir
cumstances under which a battle 13 to be
avoided or declined, are, when there ts greater
danger to bepprehended from defeat than &i:
vaniages to bo corived from victory,"
Now, let ns test tha wisdo'in of thia proposed
advance by tbis maxim. It is admitted that at
least. outfOQ' men .ore. or rather were, seeessary
for the dsfensa of Washinetoa whan tha last
advance was made upon Blchmond by tbo way
of he Peninsula. Tiis force was evidently
considered adtquato to meet the force likely to
V pent against ub .with our army meaaaiog
Richmpnd, for it was, deemed BufEcieut, iviti
the fortifications, to defend this city.
Tho raid of Jiskson aud Lee into Maryland.
with the wholo army of the Potomac and of
Virginia in tho immediate- vicinity, demon
strates the fallacy of such an idea.
The invasion of the rebels shows' that three
times tho number of troops is required fer th
defense of Washington, if assailed by the
wholo- rabel army.
The question, it appears to ns, which now
presents itself is this 1. Can we spare from the
army of tk Potomac a sufficient fores' fer the
defense of Washingtoi, and still have a saffi-
cient forco to advance upon Richmond.
If tho srovornrnent aud the Union eenarala
can safely finswer thb auestion in the sffirma-
live, then thoy msy safely offor battlo to the
rebel army between this city and Rtchruond;
without violating thq cardinal maxim ef war
quoted above. If they entertain tha, least doubt
upon the subject, then thev move on at tbnir
-peril, for, while their triumph over rebels should
go but a little way toward ernshing the rebel
lion, their defeat would inevitably involve' the
fall of Washington, and tha consequent (riawph
of Vt rehillion. Tho victorious rebel army
would luroly follow bacV onf routed and do
moralized legions, overwhelm tha army of tho
defense of Washington, capture It, and, with
tho'supplies and munitions which they get bore,
and the prostigo they would thus acquire, push
on ta,thq,bauks of, thaSasquehannaand even
te the Hudson.
But it may bo suggested thia reasoning be
correct, that the army of tho Iotomao will never
be able to move, as the robels will only have to in
crease their force between this and Richmond to
perpetual! hold us ia check. As this may bo true,
and still tho army of tho Potomac play an im
portant part, and even decisive part, in the can
test. Tho armyof the Potomac is, properly an
army of-obervation and defonoe oombined;
thatja to say, an army to defend Washingtou
and men.co IJ'chmnnd whenever ilia rebels re
duce their forco sifflcioritTy to enable us, con
sistently with the cardinol mrfftary mnxim to
which we have referred, tr do it. As kng as it
compels tho robels to keep up their force, and
protects Washington, it does all that it ought to
do. under present circumstances,
It is tho right wing and tbe vulnerable center
of this gigantic military position of tho jajbel
S-atcs which ought to bo assailed and carried.
The remaining wfng may then be simultaneously
assailed on both sides, and the front must finally
succumb.
Irtt us illustrate by arranging tho combatants
upon a battlo field precisely a4 they are now
arranged by their geographical location. Let
us suppbse that the Federal left now rested upon
fortifications which, while it, the left, acted
strictly noon tho defensive, rendsred it not only
impregnable, but supplied r rallying point for
tho discomfited center and right W;ng, but that
tho moment it-assumed thtf ofjen-ive it became
useless ; would any military man in Europe or
Amorica, advise that our left wing should attack
befcro tho enfimy's center and left should have
been "carried 1
Wo. think not. Yet thia appears 1014s to.be
the exact policy of an advance of the-.army of
the Potomac, under existing circumstances.
Possibly tho fortunes of war might favor us in
sqob, t movement. Still, we know that three
times already has tho tide of battle beea against
us in this disastrous campaign.
Wo shall havo more to say upon this important
topic' hereaftor. 4

It is also an important fact tht the greater
portion of the available capital of this country
is employed in trade and business, and H thu
used for the profit it will earn, instead oi an tin

This condition of oar OMHtry k kneton ttfus

of our paopl ; and hence wo esteem those evi
deuee of debt moit valaaWe thac possess tbe
meet oonvettible.cbaraeter while they contain
thfr intrinsic merit of certaia, valaie.
In consequence of these fajoUaad coneksions,
yorir tnemoriaKsts" desire to present to you a
system of Arneiiai finance- which will conform
to the cotiditiea and genius of our people, and
whiuh will make the burden of a heavy debt
bear as lightly as. possible npou all interests, by
aaiustiBg it to the shooldew of traders bankers
and capitalists,
Iu our eountry, " money" is that artiele which
tho Federal government should declare to be a
legal tender, and the public will take this money
so - long aa trade aadfbssiness may demand t
trade will employ mosey so lose as the ase ef
it wiU produeea profit greater thaa tlw amount
of interest paid for its use. When we wish to
Heat niore money than can be profitably era-
p ley pain iiaae.iwemust maice it beer an iater

It is sot the quantity -of bonds beasistt fetec
est that creates inflation or over-issues, but tbe
large quantity of irredeemable bills forced upon
the public as currency that bears no interest.
The principle we now propose te embrace in
our national finances, we trust, may be one that
will preserve the credit and life of the nation,
and alleviate tho fears of these who oeeeider a
national debt an unmitigated evil.
Your m-morialiets, therefore, respectfully re
quest you to authorjs and direct the Treasury
Department to issue cupoa bonds, having
twenty years W rort, of the domination of
tweety, fifty, eae feasOred, five hundred, ow
thousand, aad five thotuaud dollars each, bear
ing an interest of four and one-half per oeatuca,
and to make such bends n legal tender.
Your memorialists represent that these bonds
wiU be takerr and hM by aU classes of oar peo
ple, and especially by merchants, traders and
mantifaatiwers, to a very largo exteat, and that
tha Introduction of these beads will kid am
business men to use more capital and less per
sonat frecKt in their business, because surplus
rapital invested in these interest paying bonds
will still ba money in the hands of the holder.
We propose foer and ene-haM per cent, inter
est, because we Had. by a careful estimate ef
current values, that four per cent, would be tco
low and five per ' mt. too high ; and that four
and one-half per Cent, with the legal tender
clause, making tbe bonds - money, wiir make a
merebairtable as well as legal par value. This
will cause them to be freely used in tbe general
businees of the country, in place of bills of ex
change, bank credits and individual accept-
Aaetwsr important advantage will flow from
this system of. finaaeje. The rata of interest ea
government bonds will net so seriously depreci
ate mortgage aaeuritiea er the current value of
teal estate a3 therate of siiand'seven per eeat,
now being paid by the treasury upon its issued
bonds.
And, again, these bonds, being money, bear
ing interest, will soon take the place or, as well
aa absorb the irredeemable demand notes, be
cause those bonds; will possess all the eharaatot
is'.ics of money, and bear interest. "
By adopting this system the treasury wttt sot
be compelled to ask anotherdoaa ; for as these
bonds will be a legal tender, tbe treasury may
use them as other money in payment to public
creditors. Thus wHI the national credit be pro
tected a ' aiust dishonor,, to- whieh it is bow ex
pesed by thepktn cf demand aete aad ftal or
Bhortleans.
II is probable that these bonds may be ab
sorbed in the business of tbe country, without
materially sobering values, to the extent of more
thxn one thousandtBilTions within six poonfbs ;
and, by allowing a sbert time to bring about a
proper, appreciation of the vales, of this new
money, bearing interest, and gradually placing
tha bonds into the hands of tha publio, it is not
unlikely that two thousand rsiHfons may be
profitably taken in onr country.
By issuing theso, bond3, that will tako tha
place of thu irredeemable demand notes, the
treAscjy wHI bo enabled to resume specie pay
