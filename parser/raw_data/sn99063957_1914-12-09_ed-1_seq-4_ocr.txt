WHY THE PEOPLE VOTED WISELY.
The proposed commission form of government was
beaten in Salem because it deserved to be. The voters
were intelligent enough to see that the benfits which
might come from some of its provisions would more than
likely be off-set by ethers which were vicious in the ex
treme. One of the latter was the following section, re
quiring a two-thirds vote to authorize the commission to
purchase or construct any public utility within the city:
"(I. To contract for public utility service for tlie supply and use of the
city mill its inhabitants; to lease, purchase or construct nnii to maintain and
operate liny public utility, either within or without the corporate limits of the
city, The power to lease, purchase or construct any public utility shall not be
exorcised without express authority being conferred by a two-thirds vote of tho
legal voters who may vote at any general "r special election upon the sub
mission to them of the question of leasing, purchasing or constructing a public
utility under the power and procedure of the initiative and referendum in
force in the city; to issue, general obligation bonds to finance nay authorized
public utility enterprise either for initial lease, purchase, construction, or nd li
lion or extension, upon the (pie.stion being submitted under the powers of the
initiative or referendum ami niilhorio I by u two thirds vote of the legal
voters voting nt either a general or spo-ial election.''
. This section must have been inserted in the proposed
charter with the deliberate purpose of blocking any at
tempt by the people in the future of acquiring their own
water, light and power, or gas plants. Always more than
one-third of the voting strength of a community may be
depended upon to rally to the support of a private corpor
ation, no matter how oppressive its acts may become to
those who are dependent upon its service.
We do not accuse the members of the charter commit
tee with a deliberate attempt to deceive the people, be
cause we know there were men and women upon it who
stand always for good citizenship, but nevertheless some
body slipped something over on them when they inserted
this section. Who its author was we do not know, but we
do know that its adoption on Monday would have worked
irreparable injury to the community in the future by
barring the people from any movement designed to
emancipate the city from the monopoly which is always
conferred with every franchise granted to a private
corporation engaged in public utility service.
Salem ought some time in the future to own its water,
light and power plants, and steps in that direction ought
to be taken at once. The Capital Journal does not now
and never will advocate the confiscation of capital invest
ed in private utilities, and will always favor purchase ii
tlx price and terms asked are fair and reasonable. It' not,
it believes in going ahead with construction, and the pri
vate corporation must take its chances for business in
competition with the municipal plant.
Water, lights, power and gas, as furnished by private
corporations to corporate cities, are necessities of modern
life (they are no longer luxuries), and no individual or
privately owned corporation should have the right to set
the price with a view to excessive profit, or dictate the
quality of service of such necessities. That has become a
recognized principle of government to the extent that most
.states have sought to place such corporations under tin
control of a public utility commission. This safeguard ol
the individual right has proven quite frequently .of doubt
ful value because of the subserviency of such commissions
to the power of corporate influence. The only real rem
. edy is public ownership.
The city of Eugene, in our own state, has made a won
derful success of public utilities. Its water, light and
power plants are owned by the people, and the latter has,
in the face of strong corporation opposition, reduced the
lighting rate from 15 cents to 8 cents per kilowatt in the
course of two years of operation. It is taking care of the
interest on construction bonds, providing for payment
of these bonds through a sinking fund, and each quarter
the books show a handsome surplus over and above oper
ating expenses. A further reduction of the rate is in
prospect.
San Francisco, Seattle, Tacoma and Pasadena are oth
er coast cities which have successfully tried out the prin
ciple of municipal ownership of public utilities. Other
cities are starting the movement in that direction, since
in municipalities of the class of Los Angeles and Portland
the bills of the private corporation for street lighting
alone have become a burden under which the taxpayers
can scarcely stagger.
A decade since and few cities owned their own water
plants now a large majority do, and nearly all are work
ing to that end. In another decade the same will be true
of light, power and gas plants, because the principle in-'
volved is the same. -j
Salem voters did well to veto an insiduous attempt to
induce them to surrender the most valuable rights they :
possess, and it is safe to say that no charter will ever be
submitted to the people again containing a provision
framed solely to perpetuate the monopoly by private cor
porations of those utilities which furnish the necessities
of modern municipal life. Should such an attempt be
made at any time again, the Capital Journal will promise
to turn the spotlight of publicity upon it in such a man
ner that no voter will be inveigled into supporting it un
der the specious guise of "commission" government or
any other subterfuge employed to catch the unwary.
President Wilson's message strikes the right keynote
in declaring opposition to a large standing army. A mili
tary government, and that is what large standing armies
always mean in the end, is incompatible with our popular
institutions and ideals. Our impregnable position be
tween two great oceans, making invasion next to impos
sible, calls for little in the way of "military preparedness"
beyond the fortification of our principal harbors, backed
up 'by a creditable naval establishment. If we must go
to war, the citizen soldier, with ninety days training, will
quickly establish his superiority over the regular of the
European war machines, just as volunteers have always
done at all times and in all countries. The intelligent citi
zen who volunteers to fight for his country because
its rights or honor as a nation is assailed, makes the best
soldier in the world. The gold lace and decorations of
the standing army are distinctly out of place in a re
public like ours, and the president's position will be gen
erally endorsed.
Villa and Zapata present the strange spectacle of two
Mexican leaders meeting and agreeing, and, stranger still,
agreeing to step down and out without asking to be made
president or given any other position. It is almost unbe
lievable, but must be accepted as true, as must their asser
ions that they have only the good of their country at
heart. Should they carry out their program and set their
people an example of self-denial, of putting the good of
all above the personal aggrandizement of one, they will
deserve to go down in Mexican history as the first real
patriots Mexico ever produced. If, on top of this, they
fan inaugurate a reign of peace, and give their magnifi
ceat country a chance to take the place in the world it is
justly entitled to, they will deserve and have as warm a
place in the hearts ot their countrymen as has our own
immortal Washington in ours. It really looks as though
the impossible had happened.
Little Holland has set the world an example of charity.
With a territory no larder than Belp'inm ;inrl with Vim-
commerce practically ruined and her industries crippled.

ionic idea of her task can be gained by pointing out that
f America should take on herself the support of as many
lersons proportionately she would have fifteen million
lolpless people on her hands. It would mean that every
