Senator Millard and Mr. Uurkett called

"I havo come to tho conclusion that tho
trusts have come to s.tny, but I would hnvo
tnem reguinteu anu neiu in sucn resiraini
as wouiu stop tnem irom injuring tno peo-
pie. Tne friends of tiio trust claim tnai
free competition Is commercial warfare nnd
that every success of one man means tho
defeat of another; that competition will
bring Insolvency. The waste duo to un-
restrained competition would go far to pay
expenses. The nvowed object of tho trust
Is to reduce expenses and lncrcaso values,
Tho trust utilizes tho mcst modern mn-
chlncry nnd distributes In largo quantities
sale and distribution. High wages and
steady employment nro tho results of loss
of competition. Great Industrial concerns
can Inaugurate old age pensions nnd profit-
sbarlng. at tho samo tlmo giving tho con-
sumcr better goods nt lower wages. Tho
trust will cnablo tho Amerlcnn mnnufac-
turer to enpturo tho markets of tho world,
It will glvo a snfo Investment for capital,
Wbllo men of grent wealth will bo- largo
holders, much capital will bo held by tho
great mlddlo class. o ono need bo injured
by over-capltnllzoUon.
"I hnvo given about nil thnt can bo said

serious objection to tho modern trust Is
that It has been organized In tho Interests
of promoters nnd stock Jobbers rather than
tho reduction of expenses. Tho dazzling
advantages ot theso corporations have
caused a furore In tho Interest of corpora'
Hons. The sugar trust was dissolved In
Now York nnd later appeared as a slnglo
corporation of New Jersey. Tho success of
the sugar trust brought many othcru Into

It Is this conspiracy on tho part of pro.

Into ono corporation which appeals most to
tho people."
The speaker read nn advertisement of tho
United States Steel corporation promising

SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 5. Two hundred
nnd eighty-five delegates, representing moro
than 1,500,000 workmen, responded to tlu
roll cull at the opening session ot tho
nnnual convention of tho American Fed
eration of Labor, which was culled to ordor
by President Samuel Gotnpcrs In St
Thomns' college hall at 10.30 o'clock thU
morning.
Tho convention Is said to be the largest
congress of workmen evor held rn this
country. Organization, settlement .of ques
tions Involving contested scats nnd thi
reading of tho annual reports of tho presi
dent, nccrotnry and trensuror ook up tint
entire tlmo ot the convention.
During tho rourso of tho day there wai
ono surprise sprung on tho delegates nnd
ono Important decision was also made.
Tim surprlso camo In tho form ot an ob
jection to the seating ot tho United Mine
Workers' delegates, becauso of nn nlleged
nrrcurngo In their per capita tax. Tho
objection was overruled by nn almost unani
mous voto of tho delegates.
Settlea Colored Question.
Tho Important question decided related
to tho contested seat of tho dclegntcs from
the Central Labor union of Richmond, Vn.,
which body refused lo admit negro work
men to Its organization. Tho dispute was
ndjustod by seating thn Central Labor
union rcpteseutnttvo and Instructing thn
oxecutlvo board of the American Federation
ot Labor to form a separate central union
for colored men.
Tho dolcgatcs to tho convention mnrchod
In a body from convention headquarters at
tho Hotel Jcrmyn to tho placo of meeting
nnd wero bended by a band.

ica wero roncned in tno roil cnu a stir was
caused by C. L. Shamp of Chicago, Inter
national secretary and treasurer of tho
Brotherhood of Stationary Firemen, object
ing to their being seated. Ho maintained
that tho mlno workers wero not entitled to
representation becauso tho per capltu tax
ot Jt.OOO had not buen paid to tho federa
tion. President Mitchell of tho mine workers
replied that his organization was not ask
ing for spiiclnl privileges. Soverol thou
sand of its members wuro on strike almost
continuously for tho last two years, nnd he
snld ho had naked tho executive board to
remit tho levy becuuso tho miners had paid
an assessment ot $5,000 tor the uld ot tho
machinists. Ho said If tho convention de
cided that his organization was In urrcars
ho would Immediately draw a chock for thu
amount due.
Ciuil Miner Are Seated,
Tho matter went no furthor and by n
unanimous voto tho coal miners' representa
tives wero seated.
Tho negro question camo boforo the con
vention In tho shape of u roport from tho
committee on cteduntlals. W'llllum E. Seal
wiik elected by the Central Labor union of
Richmond to represent tt at tho conventlou.
It appears that tho Richmond central body
refused to ndmlt to mnmhomhlti negro work
men belonging to colored tobacco workers'
unions In Richmond. Honry Fischer, presi
dent of iho Natlonnl Tobacco Workers'
union, was Instructed by two local colored
unions of Richmond to opposo tho seating nf
Seul on tho ground Hint tho organization bo
represented drew tho color lino.
The committee heard both shies and reu-
nmmcndi'd that Senl bo seated and also rec-
ommonded that thn execntlvn board of tho
Amorlcun Federation of Labor bo Instructed
to form a central union In Richmond.
Tho recommendations were accepted by
the. convention without opposition.
.More Triiuhlr ArUrn,
Tho content botween tho Amerlcnn Feder
ation of Muulcluns nnd tho Detroit Contrnl
Labor union over tho seating of tho lattor's
delcgato was settled by tha Central Inbor
union bolng recognized. The decision In
thlH cnuo was nccnmpanlod hy recommonda-
tlniis looking toward an amicable adjust
ment of tho dllturencoH betwoen tho Cen
tral l.-itior union and tho miiolcluns' union

Tho reading of the annual report of Pres
ident Gonlpors consumed threo hours. Sec
rotury Morrison's report nnd that ot John
B. Lennon wero also rend. They woro re
ferred to committees.

Tho purposo for which tho slrlko of tho
