canals was blocked by the refusal ot
William Nelson Cromwell to answer the
most pertinent questions of Senator
Morgan of Alabama. Since that time
nothing ha3 been done because after
Senator Morgan's death there was no
successor to carrv on his great work of
revealing the truth about Panama cor
ruption.
'"The Indianapolis News said in the
editorial for which Mr. Iloo-evelt as
sails Mr. Smith:
As to President's Answer.
''It has been charged that the Unit
ed States bought from American citi
zens for $40,000,000 property that cost
those citizens only $12,000,000. There
is no doubt that the government paid
40,000,000 for the property. But who
got the money!'
"President Roosevelt's reply to this
most proper question is for the most
part a string of abusive and defama
tory epithets.
"As to the detailed distribution of
the Panama loot, only one man knows
it all, and that man is William Nelson
Cromwell. The two men who were
most iu Mr. Cromwell's confidence are
Theodore Uoo-evelt, president of the
United States, and Elihu Root, former
secretary of war and now secretary of
state.
'It was they who aided Mr. Cromwell
in consummating the ranania revolu
tion, arranged the terms of the pur
chase of the Panama canal, made the
agreement to pay $40,000,000 on the ca
nal properties and an additional $10,-
000,000 for a manufactured Panama re
public, every penny of both of which
sums was paid by check on the United
States treasury to .T. P. Morgan & Co.
not to the French government, as Mr.
Roosevelt says, but to .1. P. Morgan &
Co.
Cromwell's Contract Powers.
"If congress can have all the docu
ments in the case, as Mr. Roosevelt
says, let congress mane a eorapieie in
vestigation of the Panama canal at
fair, and in particular of William Xel-
son, troniwelis relation wiiu mc
French company, with Panama and
with the government ot the united
States. Let congress oilicially answer
this question: 'Who (Jot the Monevi'
"What Mr. Cromwell represented was
the new Panama canal company. th"
American Panama Canal Company, and
the $.'5,000,000 syndicate which he form
ed to finance the new companies.
"The basis on which Mr. Cromwell
was 'exclusively empowered' in this
contract was that an American Panama
Canal Company, with a capitalization
of $00,000,000 preferred and $45,000.01 M)
common should be ordered to take over
the Panama canal concessions and all
other property belonging to the New
French Panama Canal Company, which
had liouglit the same from the old lie
Lessops company. This company was
incorporated in Xew Jersey with dum
my directors. There was also incorpo
rated in Xew Jersey with dummy di
rectors the Interoeeanic Canal Compa
ny. "Senator Morgan unearthed a eopy
of the $5,000,000 syndicate agreement
which provided that the subcrilHTs
should contract with William Xelsou
Cromwell to pay in $5,000,000 in cash
and to take their several allotments
in the enterprise.
Where the Money Went.
"Following that, to quote from Mr.
Cromwell's testimony, 'in May, 1904, 1
representing ,tlie new Panama canal,
and Judges Day and Russel, represent
ing Attorney General Kunx, consum
mated' the transfer and sale to the
United States.
"Mr. Roosevelt says 'the government
paid this $40,000,000 direct to the
French go eminent.'
Mr. Cromwell testified that the Uni
ted States paid the money to J. P.
Morgan & Co.
"Mr. Roosevelt says "the French gov
erment distributed the sum.' Mr.
Cromwell testified as to how he distrib
uted it.

"As to Mr. Roosevelt's statement
that 'there was no syndicate' he could
have read the 'syndicate subscription
agreement' on page 1150, vol. 11, of the
testimony liefore the committee on in
teroeeanic canals if ho had cared for
the truth.

WASIIIX:TV,., Dec. 15 At the top
of the list of things that cost money
stands the modern, battleship. The
vncht of the multi-millionaire as a con
sumer of money stands nowhere in
comparison with the so-called bulldogs
of the navy. The estimate of $4.154.5(HI
submitted to Congress by the Xavy De
partment to eowr repairs to le made
to a numlK-r of ships during the focal
year that will ln-gin on July 1 next, is
not even a bagatelle in comparison with
the cost of the world-girdling cruise
that will end on Washington's Rirth-
dav.
During th eruie not less than 27,
500.000 good Aiiiprica.ii dollars will have
vanished with the smoke from the fun
nels of Admiral SperryV sixteen bull
dogs and the auxiliaries accompanying
them. Careful estimates how that it
costs about $17,107,000 to maintain the
battleships of that fleet, and that tiie
maintenance charge on account of the
auxiliaries is not less than $5,000,000.
The ships will lie gone for substantially
one and a fourth years. In round num-
lers therefore, the cost will lie substan
tially $27,500,000.
Well on to $60,000,000.
The estimate as to the cost of the
cruise does not include charges that
could reasonably 1k put to the main
tenance account. To make the cost ap
pear just as it should would necessitate
an estimate to be made of the propor
tionate share each ship should bear of
the whole expense of having and main
taining a navy. Under such a. system
of accounting the cost would probably
run well on to $60,000,000. because the
licet constitutes nearly two-thirds of
the entire navy. It embraces more than
two-thirds of the real fighting strength
