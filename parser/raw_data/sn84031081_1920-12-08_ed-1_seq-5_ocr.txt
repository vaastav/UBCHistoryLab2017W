SYSTEM AND INDEPEHDEIiCE FOR
PHILIPPINES URGED BY WILSON
Message Is Transmitted to Congress By Mes
senger; Is Silent on the League of Nations;
Soldiers' Bonus Not Endorsed; Favors
Economy and a Budget System.
(BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)
Washington, Dec. 7. President
Wilson's concrete recommenda
tions to congress in his annual
message to 4ay were:
Ilevision of the tax laws with
simplification of the income and
profits Jtaxe9.
Independence for the Philippines.
A loan to Armenia.
Economy in government appro-
priations and expenditures and
creation of a "workable budget
system." .
Cold storage arTd other laws af
fecting the cost of living, and the
federal licensing of corporations as
recommended in previous mes
sages. Rehabilitation and training of
disabled soldiers and sailors.
The president did not endorse a
bonus.
silent on Iipaeue.
Nowhere did the president refer
o the league of nations or tne
peace treaty fight, except perhaps
tv inference in jus oleums
right makes might, and in that
faith let us dare 10 do our duty
as we understand it."
The house listened to the read
ing of the president's message in
silence until it was concluded,
when the democrats arose and ap
plauded. There was some applause
also from the galleries where
crowds had gathered in anticipa
tion of the possibility that Mr.
Wilson might at the last moment
determine to read his communica
tion, in person.
In the senate arrival of the
White House messenger, with an
armful of communications, includ
ing some 17,000 recess and other
appointments and with the an
nouncement, "several messages in
writing from the president," caused
laughter on the floor. Debate on
farmers' relief measures was in
progress and it was half an, hour
before the clerk began reauing u c
liters toi-
n ivarrranii Tvh w.ii mirni i.-e re
garded as a valedictory, saying:

which await national action ic the
days to come, whether in Amjrica
or elsewhere."
"Democracy," the president said,
"Is being put upon its final test.'

Lincoln's "Let us have faith tbat At its close the president wrote
M
How a prospective
'mother prepared
for babyS comind.
Of all the vital adventures in life, the birth of a baby is
the climax of nature s most woruleriui evolution.
During this period, nature is supposed to be preparing
the internal organism of a woman for a safe and speedy
delivery; but it is more the exception than the rule when
nature, unaided, performs her part at the crisis in a
manner to relieve pain and contribute to comfort.
"I was afraid," writes' a prospective mother, "until aft
experienced mother told me about Mother's Friend,"-
but now J cannot recommend Mother's Friend tod,
highly for 1 know it helped me wonderfully, and I can
almost say my baby was born without pain. At tha
present time 1 am using it again, as I do not want to go
thru the ordeal without it."
Three generations of prospective'fnotbers have used
Mother's Friend. When gently applied, during the
period of expectancy, it soothes the fine net-work of
nerves, lubricates the broad, flat, abdominal muscles
and prepares the way for an easier, quicker and practical
delivery.

"In response to what I believe
to be the Impulse of sympathy and
opinion throughout the United
States I earnestly suggest that the
congress authorize the treasury of
the 1'nited Slates to make to the
struggling government of Armenia
such a loan as was made to several
of the allied governments during

Two wavs "in which the United

the president. They were:

were filled, and several diplomats
were present.
Taking up the subject of appro
priations, I'residont Wilson eaid:
The relation between the current
receipts and current expenditures
of the government during the pres
ent fiscal year, as well as during
the last half of the last fiscal
year, has been disturbed by the
extraordinary burdena thrown up
on the treasury by the transporta
tion act, in connection with the re
turn of the railroads to private
control. Over $600,000,000 has al
ready been paid to the railroads
under this act $360,000,000 dur
ing the present fiscal year, and it
is estimated that further payments
aggregating possibly $660,000,000
must still be made to the railroads
during the current year. It is ob
vious that these large . payments
have already seriously limited the
government's progress in retiring
the floating debt. ,
Revision of . Tax IjOws.
"Closely connected with this, it
seems to me, is the necessity for
an Immediate consideration or tne
revision of our tax laws. Simpli
fication of the income and profits
taxes has become an. immediate
necessity. These, taxes performed
an indispensable service during
the war. The need for .their sim
plification, however, is very great,
in order to save the tax: payer in
concoxivenience and expense and
in order to make his liability more
certain and definite. Other and
more detailed recommendations
with regard to taxea will no doubt
be laid before you by the secre
tary of the treasury, and tho
commissioner of Internal revenue.
Care of Disabled Men.
"It is my privilege to draw to
the attention of congreas for very
sympathetic consideration the
problem of providing adequate fa
cilities for the care and treatment
of former members of tho military
and naval forces who are sick or
disabled as the result of their
participation in the war. These
heroic men can never be paid In
money for the service they patri
otically rendered the nation. Their
reward will lie rather in realiza
tion of the fact that they vindi
cated the rights of their country
fnrtinrdine civiliza
tion. The nation's gratitude must
be effectively revealed to them by
the most ample provision for their
medical care and treatment as
well as for their vocational train
ing and placement The time has
come when a more complete pro
gram can be formulated and more
..tiuf.MArllv administered for their
treatment and training and I earn
estly urge that tne congreiw bi
the matter its early consideration,
mu. .nn.A,af-u Af th trfi.'iKurv and
the board for vocational education
will outline In tneir annual rrpn
proposals covering medical care
and rehabilitation which I am sure
will engage your earnest siuuy uuu

support.

iDk.mit mn tn emnhasize once
more the need for action upon cer
tain matters .upon which I dwelt
at some length In my message to
the second session of tne sixty-
sixth congress:
'The necessity, ror example, oi
encouraging the manufacture of
js.iiiffa unit related chemicals;
the Importance of doing everything
possible to promote agricuuumi
production along economic lines,

and to make jural life more at

for a law regulating cold storage

during which goods may be kept
in storoge, prescribing the method
Aiannaintr nf th.m if kent be
yond the permitted period, and re
quiring gooas reieasea irum
age in all cases to bear the date
of their receipt. It would also be
most serviceable If It were provid
ed that all goods released from cold
storage for Interstate shipment
should have plainly marked upon
each package the selling or mar
ket price at which they went into
storage, in ordea that the purchaser
might be able to learn what profits
stood between him' and the pro
ducer or the wholesale dealer. In
deed. It would be very serviceable
to the public if alt goods destined
for interstate commerce were made
to carry upon every packing case
whose form made it possible a
plain statement of the price at
which they left the lhands of the
producer. I respectfully call your
attention, also, to the recommend
ations of the message referred to
with regard to a federal license for
all corporations engaged In Inter
state commerce.

BELIEVES IT WILL BE
UNLAWFUL TO BUILD A
FIRE IN CITY LIMITS
(By The Associates' Pnaa)
Philadelphia, Dec. 7 Dr. Charles
A. Stelnmetz, electrical "wizard of
Schenectady," believes it will be 11.
legal to build a fire In the limits of
the cities of the future, which will
be smokeless and dustless. He
made this prediction at a dinner
of the Bala-Cynwyd Neighborhood
club In this city. He painted a
word picture of a present-day city
in the throes of an "electricity
strike" and showed how a city
depends on electricity In transpor
tation and manufacturing.
"But," said Dr. Stelnmetz. "al
though we are absolutely depend
ent on our electricity today we
have still only begun to use it.
"In the city, present methods of
manufacture will be replaced with
electrical ' methods. The present
city with Its dust and smoke will
be unknown. It will be against
the law to have a tire in the city
limits. Life then will be worth liv
ing in cities."
