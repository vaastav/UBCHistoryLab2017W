THE SOLDIER'S VOW.
BY FLORENCE SPRAGUE.
The young soldier stood by the fireside
Of hie own bright happy home.
At be bid farewell to the loved ones
Ere far away he would roam.
His eye wai dimned by a trembling tear
And a sigh straggled up from hi. manly breast, .
Which in mo he tried to stay. 1
That he quicsiv amnea away,
1 r i F
6, that was s proud and noble youth,
Handsome in form and face, .
And each movement waa characteristic
. Of a bold and careless grace.
None loved so well their friends and home
Aa that brave, true-hearted boyj
Jle was their doted pride and hope,
Their light and lile and joy.
But the fire of patriotism burned
Deep in hia young, brave heart;
And now he was leaving his childhood t home,
Manly to act his part.
O, weep not for me, mother, he said;
Weep not for your warrior son,
fori shall return to yon again
When the victory we have won.
I am going forth to battle, father.
For my country'a liberty.
To fight for our glorious stripes and stars,
. The standard of the great and tree,
0, may ita shining, starry folds
Float proudly on the breezy air;
And may it ever consecrated be
4 By a nation's grateful prayer.
0, how I could freely and gladly
Lay down my life to-day,
Could I but know that my heart's blood
Would wash this strife away.
Butoureonntry ia in danger now;
The rebel forces are thick and atrong;
O, may kind Heaven smile on uur cause.
And teach the Southerners they are wrong.
Ill fight bravely for the Union,
And most willingly I will die
For my own beloved country,
If so 'tis willed on high.
I'll help to drive the rebels back.
Like chaff before the breeze;
And I'll gain my crown of laurels
Fighting for home and peace.
Should I e'er again to you return,
I'll hring with me a name
That shall shine for future ages
Bright on the scroll of fame.
From the Indianapolis Journal, many years
ago.
PATRIOTIC AND BEAUTIFUL.
When Freedom, 'neath the battle-storm.
Her weary head reclined.
And round "her fair, majestic form
Oppression fain had twined;
Amid the din, beneath the cloud,
Great Washington appeared;
With daring hand rolled tck the shroud,
And thus the sufferer cheered:
"Spurn, spurn despair, be great, be free;
With giant strength arise;
Stretch, stretch thy pinion., Liberty,
Thy flag plant in the skies.
Clothe, clothe thyself in glory's robe,
Let stars thy (winner gem;
Bule, rule the seas, possess the globe.
Wear victory'a diadem."
"Go tell the world a world ia born.
Another orb gives light.
Another sun illumes the morn,
Another star the night.
Be just, be brave, and let thy name
Henceforth Columbia be;
Wear, wear the oaken wreath of fame,
The wreath of Liberty!"
He said, and lo! the stars of night!
Forth to her banner flew;
And more, with pencil dipped in light,
Her blushes on it drew.
Columbia's Chieftain seized the prize,
All gloriously unfurled,
Soared with it to his native skiea,
And waved it o'er the world.

monwealth says:.
The editor of the Louisville Journal
seems to have argued himself into a
perfect freniy over the President's
message, but so far as we can learn,
bis diatribes have had no effect upon
any one else. He commence'! bis lec
tnres upon a telegraphic mistake, but
be is so escorted and elated over his
wounderiul articles that he has not
time to discover his mistake, and proba
blj. if he should discover it, making
the proper correction would oe too hu
miliaiing at this time, before the ink in
which his denunciation are recorded is
dry. We think he had better go ahead
and not stop this side of the Confederate
lines.

ABSTRACT OF THE TREASURY REPORT.
; The Secretary of the Treasury after,
referring to the recommendations eon- j
tained in hi J Iy report, gives the man
ner in which he obtained loans for the
various purposes of the Government. . .
The immediate exigencies were pro
vided for by issuing 914.019,034 in six
1 1 n XreMnr- ,,, Md
' .v,u
912,877,750 in the same notes paysble
sixty days. His next care was to pro
vide for disbursements for the war, and
he adopted the plan to engage the bank
ing institutions of the three commer
cial cities of the seaboard to advance
the amount needed in loans for three
years 7 3-10 bonds to be reimbursed
from the proceeds of similar bonds sub
scribed for by the people, hoping thus
to combine the capital of the banks and
the people with the credit of the Gov
ernment, so as to give efficiency to ad
ministrative action, and competent sup
port to publie credit; and the result
has fulfilled the hope. Heathen rehear
ses the agreement entered into between
the banks and himself, by which the
former agreed to take the loans. The
history of the first two loans has been
made public. The second loan was
negotiated with the banks on the 16ih
of November, by which he agreed to
issue to them fifty millions in six per
cent, bonds at par for the bonds bearing
seven per cent, interest. This agree-
tnoni xnnnloil with ha arrantrement I
" I." VUMJIKU . O
for reimbursement, and entailed no ex
pense except the preparing and issuing j
the bonds. This was also complied j
with, the option to the banks, that on :
or after the first of January a fourth
advance of fifty millions should be;
made on the same terms as the first or j
second, if required. In addition toj
these loans, 821,145.220. up to the) j
30th of November, were issued in
Treasury notes, of 5's, 10's. and 208,
payable on demand, and 83.385,105 re- j
mained in the Treasury. This amount
may be regarded as a loan from the
people. The aggregate realised from I
loans, in various forms, is 8197,742.-j
588. The revenue receipts have nolj
fulfilled his expectations. He says an
act modifying the rates of duties differed
from the measures he submitted to:
Congress. In most of tl'ese particu-,
lars especially in diminihe.l duties on
tea, coffee and sugar, and exempting
goods in warehouse and on shipboard
the difference was disadvantageous to;
the revenue, while a potential caue ofi
reduced receipts may be found in the 1
changed ciicumstances of the country '
proving unfavorable to foreign com-'
merce. These circumstances compel
him to reduce his estimates for 1862
from the revenue from 857.000,000 to.
832.198,602. The estimates from re
ceipts from lands and miscellaneous
sources, he reduces from 83,000.000
to 82,304,062. The only other sour
ces of revenue is a direct tax author
ized by Congress, which if increased to
the limit proposed by the Secretary and
assumed by Slates, the further sum of
twenty millions may be expected. The
aggregate of revenue may thus be es
timatf d at 854.552.660, which is 825,
447.334 less than the estimate of July.
The Secretary stales the estimates for
July were based on the raising of 250,
000 volunteers and an increase of the
regular army by eleven regiments, but
after that report had been closed. Con
gress authorized the acceptance by the
President of five hundred thousand
men, besides additional companies and
officers. This large increase has, and
must necessarily augment the expendi-
tures far beyond the limit indicated by
the original estimates, which will be I
still further extended by the increase of I
the navy and additional appropriations1
are asked, for of these additional appro- j
priations 847,935.566 were authorized .
by acts of Inst session and 8 143. 1 30,- J
927 are now asked for, making an ag
gregate including 822.787.933 for in-j
definite appropriations of 82 1 3,994.427. j
To provide these large sums, retrench-:
ment and reform are indispensable.
Contracts should be subjected to strict j
supervision, and contractors to rigorous
responsibility. All unnecessary offices
should be abolished and salaries and ,
pay materially reduced. While thus re-'
commending retrenchment he feels
himself constrained to renew sngges-l
lions heretofore submitted by him, that
property of rebels should be made to
pay, in part, at least, the cost of rebel-1
lion. Property of great value in loyal j
Slates is held by proprietors virtually
engaged in a guilty attempt to break
up the Union, which is justly forfeited)
to the people, which should be subjec
ted lo sequestration or confiscation and
the proceeds applied to the satisfaction
of claims arising from the war. Prop
erty of rebels in rebel Slates should be
treated in the same manner. Rights to i
services under State laws must of ne-'
eessity form an exception to any rule of
confiscation. Persons held by rebels
under such laws to service as slaves,
may, however, be justly liberated from j
their constraint and made more valua-'
ble in various employments through
voluntary and compensated service than
if confiscated as subjects ol property.
The Secretary says that the moat
sacred duty of the American people
now requires consecration of all their
energies and resources to the establish
ment of the Union,' and sound policy
would seem to suggest no extension of
foreign trade, but more absolute reli
ance on American labor, Americas
skill and American soil. He recom-
i
j
;
i
mends duties on tea, coffee and sugar
be . increased ' to 8fe per pound on
brown, 3c on clayed, fOe on green tea,
6c on coffee, and that no other altera
tions of the tariff be made, unless fur
ther experience shall demonstrate the
necessity. He deems it necessary to
Increase the direct tax, so as to produce
from loyal Stales a revenue of at least
82.000,000 estimating such duties on
stills, distilled liquors, tobacco, bank
notes, carriages, legacies on paper, evi-
dences of debt and conveyances of
property, and other like property, is
will produce an equal additional sum.
1 ne income lax win pniunoij proooceii
810,000,000 more, making an aggre
gate of 850.000.000. The Secretary
is aware that the sum is large, but see
ing no probability of the revenue ex
ceeding 840,000.000 during the current
year, he feels that he must not shrink
from a plain statement of the actual ne
cessities of the situation. Two-fifths
of one per eent. on real and persona
property of loyal States, will produce
844.000.000 the proposed income ad-
ding 810,000,000. The Secretary
recommends a plan for a national circu-
lation of notes, the features of which
are a circulation of notes bearing a
common impression, and authenticated
by eommon authority. The redemp
tion of these notes by associations and
institutions to which they may be de-
livered for issue, and the security of
redemption by pledge of United
States slocks, and an adequate provis-
ion of specie. An important advan-!ye
tage lo the people by this plan would :
be in the increased security of the ,
Union, springing from common interests
in its preservation, created by distnbu-

that the modification made by the Pres

It has become a grave question for

All after that was erased, and the

It is already a grave question what

control at that point is very considera
ble, and simitar cases will probably oc-'

Can we afford to send them forward to

labor may be useful lo us; withheld

W There was one "nubby" little
paragraph in the early dispatches con

tion but is very significant. It wss
stated that when the commandei of the
English .steamer showed fight and de
fied the power of the frigate. Captain
Wilkes immediately "placed the Sao
Jacin'o in a convenient position."
This wss a mild way of putting it, but
inasmuch as the "convenient position"
probably brought the frigate's broad
side into view, the English skipper no
longer had any choice. Our navy
generally is getting into convenient po
sitions, snd with equally excellent re
sults. .

The eternal fimess of things is consult
ed in the consignment of James M. Ma
son to a prison in Boston harbor, with
unquestionable Yankees for his keepers.
What has always tended to make Ma
son especially obnoxious to those who
suffered his society, has been his ex
ceeding shallow capacity, presumption
and affection of contempt for Northern
people and institutions. It was Mr. R.
C. Winlhrop, of Boston,' who. a few
months ago, asked the Virginia Senator
when he wou'd visit Boston. The re

Three Motes Equal to a Fire.
The old saying lliat three removals are
aa bad as a firer is a pretty true one.
The rebels are rspidly moving toward
a conflagration. They moved their
Capital from Montgomery to Rich

fire in the rear which will expedite
the third move, snd thus prove the

there are fully three thousand five hun

No attention is given to the payment
of the troops, and the soldiers hive been
so accustomed lb that sort of neglect
that they do not expect to receive re
(numeration for their services, being but
too glad if they can obtain sufficient
subsistence to keep their, souls and ho

sixteen dollars in his pocket, the re

he carried witb hira from this city to

consequence of the death of five offi
cers, caused by earing poisonous fungi,
the French Army Board have bad lb
following instructions published:
Fungi afford man an agreeable and
'nourishing food, and therefore in some
provinces ol France they are consumed
to a great extent. The soldiers seek
them, but unlortunately they often con
found the poisonous with edible ones,
and Ihus expose themselves to the
gravest accidents. It is important,
therefore, that they should be taught,
as far aa science is able, to distinguish
the wholesome from the injurious spe
cies, and at the same time be made ac
quainted with the proper means to com
bat the poison. It is with this view
that the Board of Health have drawn
out the present instruction. Edible
fungi grow usually in elevated and airy
places in waste ground; whilst the dan
gerous species aie found in woods, and
in dark damp places. The edible spe
cies have a compact, brittle flesh; while
those with a soft and watery flesh should
always be rejected.
Wholesome fungi have an agreeable
odor, akhough this character is also
found in some injurious species. A
powerful and diagreeable odor is the
certain indication oi noxious qualities.
We ought at once lo reject fungi which
secrete a milky juice, and those which
present an acrid, astringent, bitter acid
or sail taste.
We should suspect fungi which have
a bright lint. red. green or blue, of
which the gills are colored brown or
blue. The flesh of the edible species
is in general white; nevertheless, a
beautiful red fungus, the orange agarie,
is considered as the finest and most
delicate species. Wholesome fungi do
not change color by contact -with the
air after being cut; those ol which the
flesh then acquires a brown, green, or
blue tint, are poisonous. We ought to
regard as dangerous those which insects
ill not touch.
It is proper lo abstain from fungi.
whatever may be their apparent quali
ties, when they exhibit anv sins of
change; when even they have been col
lected more lhan twenty four hours
the poisonous properties being capable
of development when the fungus dries
up.
