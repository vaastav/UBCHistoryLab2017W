the county when the certificate is r e leenv 1,
and when the County Hoard choose to
have the list printed in a German pap r.
they must pay for it, which they have
done under the laws of this State,
even without Mr. llorcherdt's permission.
Now, lot U3 inako a statement of f:> < s

such reason for yelping “Stop tlii- f!"
1 ndcr a resolution r i the County Hoard, at
its annual ses on of November, l>7*h to
let it? job printing to tiio lowest hi Id. r,
Mr. Boreherdt put in a bid at CO con's ( .!f
from legal rates, which was accepted by a
Democratic board, and a contract drawn
up and signed by the proper parties.
Tndcr this contract Mr. Boreherdt ha
presented three hills, amounting in all to
something ov-'r <701.00, the last one,
amounting to about -to 16.00, being pre
dated at the special session hold in S, | .
tember. The committee, to which said
bill was referred, reported that th‘*v
thought said bill too high, but had not
time to inquir into the matter: an 1, as
Mr. B. plead poverty and begged them to
pnt it in shape to pass at that session, thev
reported it back to the Board for their
joint consideration. Mr. Boreherdt went
to the Board, individually and collectively,
claiming that he was poor and needy, but
honest; that the bill was all right, and
that they might write to Ma lison and find
out what prices were paid the State print
ers, and if his bill was found in esc- s of
>gn! prices, and f>o cents off. he would re
fund to the county every cent. 1! . a ;i

he abhorred *i am many. Two 1, Connelly
and all other voucher thieves; and. with a
wave of his hand and with one of those
smiles that arc “childlike ami bland.” be
aske.l them to pass the bill and accept the
thanks of honest Fred. Boreherdt. \\>
are sorry to record the fact that horcst
Democrats took stock in this Christian
“Chinee," and passed the bill and he re
ccivoil his pay in full. Before the 1! ,ard
Adjourned, they appointed a commit roc,
consisting of ,J. IV. Barnes and K C.iu
way, to post themselves in regard to prie >s
paid the Suite printer for such work, an 1
to take Mr Boreherdt’s bill and nscer; ii.*
what he was justly entitle 1 to under >a j ;
contract, and report the same to said

presented, showing Mr. Boreherdt to he

Allowed and paid by the ConntyV.. r.
According to the committee's r.; ort, Mr.
Boreherdt Las been overpaid
“So childlike and bland!” \V e cu U,

did nut agree to refund only on the last
bill, and by promising to pay 5.040,1;* if
taken in printing, he managed to slip out of
half his iu.lebteJae.se, getting the matter
thus settled by the Board finally accepting
kia offer. But as soon as the

Now, Uncle Fred., wo wduld ask are
you such an oid ninny as to suppose that :
you can throw such dirty slops as the
above to vour r *aders without having its
slime and dirt spatter back in your face ?
Why assume that your readers are such
consummate fools as to take any stock in
such hcaddle, so soon after being caught
defrauding the county out of $.71d.00 in a
bill for job work of <701.00 ? Such impu
dence can only emanate from old sinners <
who are “childlike and bland,” and we
L 1 ’ * cuppose
that, if your printing bill presented to the
City Council was looked after, the same
ratio of fraud would there be found.
Many of our tax-paying citizens in this
city remember of your a-king and receiving
SS.MO per day for carrying chain for F.
Armshy, while surveying out the new citv
grade some time ago. Plenty of men
could Lave been hired for <1.25 per day, at
the most, quite as useful as Borchcrdt:
but ho was poor, needy and “ truly

bying that bill through; yet, so “ blano,
he begged it through, and we have heard
of no inquiry as to how long the tax-pay
ers would stand such corruption to sup
port a Republican city a hninistration.
I rule Fred., Connelly is in Ludlow street
jail, an i Tweed ought to be. They have
stolen their five or ton millions of New
\urk city and county money, while you
have got ahead of Manitowoc city and
county as many hundreds. Vet, consider
ing too Qiiicrenco in Drains ana opportuni

"f the conference of Hie Commission-1

fins t *caty provides methods for adjust

justed by arbitration. 1 recommend to
Congress, at an early day, to make the ne
cessary provisions for the tribunal at Gene

the part of the I'm ted States called for hv
the treaty. Ilis Majesty, the King of Italy',
the President of the Swiss Confederation,
and His Majesty, the Kmperor of Brazil,
hate each consente 1, on the joint request
of the two powers, to name an arbitrator
lor the tribunal at Geneva.
1 have cruised my thanks to be suitably
expressed for the readiness with which the
join* request has been complied witli hv
too appointment of gentlemen of eminence

resentatsyes of th i Stat . u tin*:
• ; i' just t I that the
duty of this protection halt been performed
by the Minister and consulate in Paris, an 1
the various consuls in France, under the
suj • rvision of the latter, with great k;nd
n.-ss as well a? with prudence and fact.
Their cours*' has received the commenda
tion of the German government, and has
wounded no susceptibility of the French.
The government of the Emperor of Ger
many continues to manifest a friendly
feeling toward the United States, and a
desire to harmonize with tho moderate and
just policy which this government main
tains in its relations with the Asiatic
powers, a< well as with the South Amer
ican Po nubile- I have given a.—uranee
that the friendly feelings of that govern
ment are fully shared by the United
States.
RELATIONS WITH aTSTRIA.
The ratification of the consular and nat
uralization connection with the Austro-
Hungarian Empire has been changed.
ITALIAN TNITV.
I have been officially informed of the an- ;
nexation of the States of the Church to the
Kingdom of Italy, and the removal of tie
capital of that kingdom to Home. In con
formation with the established policy of
the United States I have recognized this
change.
TREATY or COMMERCE WITH ITALY.
The ratifications of the new treaty of
commerce between the United States and I
Italy have been exchanged. The two i
powers have agreed in their treaty that j
property at sea shall be exempt from cap- i
tore in case ofwar between the two powers. !
The United States have spared no oppor- ;
tunityof incorporating this rule into the
obligations of nations.
AMERICAN CLAIMS AGAINST SPAIN.
Tt.f. r ■- r . V.nrr.fit utr-nn-l *
scv-ion, made an appropriation for the or- 1
ganization of a mixed commission for ad- •
indicating upon the claims of citizens of
the 5 uited States against Spain, growing !
out of the insurrection in Cuba. That i
commission has since been organized. I
transmit a copy of the correspondence !
relating to its formation and its juris fiction.
It is to b ■ hoped that this commission .vill
afford the claimants a complete reined* for i
their injuries.
If has been made the agreeable duty of
tin- United Mates to preside over a con
ference at Washington between the pleni
potentiary of Spain and the allied South
American republics, which has resalte 1 in .
an armistice, with the reasonable assurance *
of a permanent peace.
RELATIONS WITH RI sSIA.
The ultimate friendly relations which
have so long existed between the Unite !
States and l!it>-i.i centime s undisturbed.
The visit of tlie third son of the Emperor
is a proof that there is no desire on the
part of Ins government to diminish the
cordiality of those relations. The hospita
ble reception which lias been given to the
Grand Duke is a proof that on our side
we share the wishes of that government.
The inexcusable course of the Russian
Min.* rat Vv ashington rendered it neces
-ary to ask his recall, and to decline
longer to receive that functionary as a dip
lomatic representative. It was impossible,
with a just regard for the dignity of the coun
try to permit Mr.Catacazyto continue to hold
inteniows with this government after his
abuse of government officers, and during
his persistent interference, through various
means, with the relations between the
United States and other powers, in ac
cordance with my wishes, our government !
has b.-rn relieved of further intercourse |
with M. Cataeazv and tho management
of the affairs of the imperial legation has
passed into the hands of a gentleman en
tirely unobjectionable.
RELATIONS WITH JAI’AN.
With Japan wc continue to maintain
intimate relations. The cabinet of the Mi
kado has, since the close of tiie last session
of Congress, selected citizen© of the United i
Matt s to serve in offices of important dc
i-artmer.ts of the government.
I have reason to think that this selection i
is due to an appreciation of the disinterest- !
edne-s of the policy which the i nitrd States
have pursued towards Japan. It is onr
desire to continue to maintain this disinter
ested and just policy wiili China as well as
Japan.
the Coreav TRornr.ES.
The correspondence transmitted b~re- i
with shows that there is no disposition on
the part of this government to swerve from i
its established course, prompted by a dc- i
sire to put an end to the barbarous treat- I
ment of our shipwrecked sailors on tho i
Corean coast.
I instructed our Minister at Pekin to en
deavor to conclude a convention with Corea,
for securing the safety and humane treat
ment of such mariners. Admiral Rodgers
wa- instructed to accompany him. * *

THE NATIONAL DEBT.
The national debt has been reduced to j
the extent of $80,057,120.80 during the)
year, and by the negotiation of national
bonds at a lower rate of interest, the inter- ,
est of the public debt hash *eu so far diinin- |
ished, that How the sum to be raise 1 for
interest account is nearly $17,(100,000 less !
than on the Ist of March, 1800.
It was highly desirable that this rapiid
diminution should take place, both "to 1
strengthen the credit of the country and |
convince its citizens of their entire ability ;
to meet every dollar of liability without
bankruptcy; but in view of the accomplish
merit of those desirable cuds, of the rapid ;
development of the resources of the countrv, j
and its increasing ability to meet the largo
demands, and the amount already paid, it
is not desirable that the present resources
of the country should continue to be taxed
in order to continue this rapid payment, i
1 therefore recomend the modification of;
both tariff and tax laws.
GOLD AXD CrKKEVCV.
Continued fluctuation in the value of
gold, compared with the national currencv,
has a most damaging effect upon the increase
and dcvelopement of the country, in keep
ing P prices of all the articles neeessarv
in every day life; it fosters a spirit of
gambling prejudicial alike to national mor
als and to national finances. If tiio ques
tion can be met as to how to got a fixed
value to our currency, that value constantly
and uniformly approaching par with specie,
a wry desirable object will be gained.
the armv.
For the operations of the army in the
past year, the expense of maintaining, esti
mates for the ensuing year,an 1 for continu
ing s. a coast and other improvements con
lucted under supervision of the War De
partment I refer y >u td tiio accompanying
report of the Secretary of War.
I cad your attention to the provisions of .
■ ■ • ■ of Congress, approved March i.
Fn which discontinues promotions in
staff corps ~f the army until provided fur
by law. I recommend that the number of,
officers in each grade of staff corps In; fixed, ’
and that whenever the number in any one |
grade fails below the number so fixed, that
the vacancy may 1m? filled by promotion ‘
from the prude below.
1 also r.-commend that when the office of
chief of corps becomes vacant, the place :
may be filled by a selection from the e rps
in which the vacancy exi-ts. The report
of the Secretary of the Navy shows im
provement in the navy, and efficiency of
the naval force, without material increase
in expense of supporting it. This is due
e> the policy which has been adopted an 1
is being extended as fast as our material
w ii! admit of using smaller vessels as cruis
ers on the several stations. By these
means wc have been enabled to occupy at
once a larger extent of cnii.-ing ground,
to visit more frequently the posts where
the presence of our flag is desirable and
-•-•'ura yto discharge in *r. eiricieutlv the
app.opriatt duties of the navy in time of i
peace without exceeding the 'number of
men or the expenditures authorized bv law.
Faring the past year the navy has. j n
t a•J it r _ ... . •
men an 1 oJScers and the vessels of the
cfast survey, and lias •••■inpktt 1 the -ur
veys authorized by Congress of the I -th
iini' of Darien and Tehauntepee; and un
der like aathoritv has sent out an expedi
tion completely furnished and equipped
to explore the unknown oc< an of th<- N orth.
The suggestions of the report as to th
necessity for increasing and uiq r ving the
material of the nary, and the plan recom
mended for reducing the personnel of th -
service to a peace standing by the gradual
abolition of certain grades of an !
reduction of others, and the employment of
some in the sen ice of the commercial ma
rine, are well considered, and deserve the
attention of Congress.
I also recommend that all promotion? in
the navy above the rank of captain he by
selection instead of by sonority. This
course will secure in the higher gra b s
greater efficiency and hold out an incentive
to your officers to improve themselves in
the knowledge of their profession.
The present cost of maintaining the
navy, and its c>st compared with that of
preceding years, and estimates fur the en
suing year, arc contained in the accompa
nying report f the Secretary of the Navy.
THE POST OFFICE.
The enlarged receipts of the Post Office-
Department, as shown by the accompany
ing report of the Postmaster General, ex
hibits a gratifying increase in that branch
of the public service. It is the index of
ilso growth of education and of the pros
perity of the people, two elements highly
conducive to the vigor and stability of re
publics, with a vast territory like ours,
much of it sparsely populated, but all re
quiring tiie services of the mail. It ;■> rot

THE KC-KT.LX I.AW.
There has been imposed upon the execu
tive branch of the government the execu
tion of the act of Congress, approved April
20th, I<S7l, and commonly known as the
Ku-Klnx law.
In a portion of the State of South Caroli
na the necessity of the course pursued will
bo demonstrated by the report of the com
mission to investigate southern outrages.
Under the provisions of the above act 1
issued a proclamation calling the attention
of the people of the United States to the
same and declaring my reluctance to exer
cise any of the extraordinary powers there
by conferred upon me, except in case of
imperative necessity, but inakim* knows
my purpose to exercise such
powers whenever it should become
necessary to do so for the purpose of
securing to all citizens of th Unit 1 States
the peaceful enjoyment of the right- guar
anteed to teem ty tiic const it Ua a and fa.,
laws.
After the passage of this law, informa
tion was r •• ive i from time to time*!
iMmblii.n ions of the el tract or r rre ito
in this law csisti lai .\\ . p
many parts of the southern states, j artir i
larly in certain counties in tlie state of
South < ’arolina. Car ful investigation
was made, and it was ascertained (hat in
nine c • mties of that Stnl such • mb,sa
nations wore active and powerful, embrac
ing a sufficient portion of citizens to control
the local authority, and having, ante:,
other things, the object of ■] nriving th
emancipated class of the su!-taut; il
benefits of free loin and of the privilege of
the free political action of those citizen •
who did not sympathize with their views.
Among their operations wore frequent
semirings and occasional assassinations,
generally perpetrated at night by i.i.aii ■■!
persons, the victims in almost "all cases
being citizens of different political senti
ments from their own, or f; i-e persons who
had shown a disposition to claim equal
rights with other citizens. Thou of
inoffensive and well-disposed citizens wort ■
the- sufferers by tins lawless violence.
Thereupon on the 13th of Oct., I*7l, a i
proclamation was issued in terms of the

THE INDIAN rOEUV.
The policy pursued towards the Indians
has resulted favorably, so far as can bo
judged from the limited time during which
it has been in operation. Through the ex
-1 ertions of the various societies of Christians,
to whom it hii* been entrusted the execution
oi the policy, and the board of commision
ers authorized by the law of April Dub,
l > b'J. many tribes of Indians have boon in
duced to settle upon reservation, to culti
vate the soil, and perform productive labor
■ °f various kinds, and to partially accept
civilization. They are being care 1 for in
sin h a way. it is hoped, as to induce those
still pursuing their old habits of life to em
brace the only opportunity which is left
them to avoid extermination. I recommend
liberal appropriations to carry out the In
dian peace policy, not only because it is
human, Uhri-tiandike anil economical, but
because it is perfectly right. I recommend
i to your favorable consideration, also, the
policy of granting a territorial government
to the Indians, in the Indian Territory
west of Arkansas and Missouri, and south
of Kansas. In doing so, every right must
be guaranteed to tlie Indians by a treaty.

-1 ceived up to the hour of going to press.]

THE COLD SHAr.
BCn Effect upon l!ie Shake.
from the Milwaukee Wisconsin, l)e . 5.
Few persons imagined yesterday while
w Iking our streets, ami thinking of the ter
r. iiO snil ring wbieli {lie cold weather must
cause some of the inhabitants of our city, in
whata distressing condition the shipping in
our harbor and along our lake coast,, w-re
placed by the intense cold and furi-ms gales
which have prevailed during the past twen
ty-four hours.
To bo on bin 1 in such weather a = we have
experienced, where one can seek the refur
of a comfortable office or dwelling, is bad
enough, but to be exposed upon the water,
to the intense suffering which accompanies
such a situation, w here life itself depends
upon out door exposure and where the safety
of the vos? I demands the utmost exertion of
every member of the crew, is something,
which, only those who have experienced can
realize the tcrriblcness of.
Quite a fleet of vessels, among them sever
al lower lakers, were outside du ing the col l
snap, and much anxiety is felt for the safety
f tho-e which have not alr. ily male their
appe rune? here.
Shortly after noon yesterday a schooner
was discovered at anchor in the bay, an I lie
tug American Eagle pro eed and to her assis
tance. She proved to be the Transit, bound
from Uhicag ■ to M anitowoc with a cargo of
supplies. As soon as a line could be made
f,.st to the tug the cable of the large anchor
was slipped. The tow line was p-rted twice
by the tug and ruined. The vessel's main
and fore sheets wore substituted, and these
in turn parted just as the harbor j iers were
reached. It now became nece-ee.ry to send
the tag to Norris' for a now line. In her
absence the small anchor was let go, bu!
faile ! to hold the vessel, and before the re
turn fth g she had and fted a cousi ler i
b'e distance e-.t into the bay. The small
an< - Ii -r was s. .pe l upon the return ■ f the
L pie, and the ves-M brought in without fur
ther trouble The is covered with ice for
ward and on deck, and h:s some running
ge\rus-dap. Her crew suffer. 3 severe!',
fr in the cold, several of them being frost
bitten.
