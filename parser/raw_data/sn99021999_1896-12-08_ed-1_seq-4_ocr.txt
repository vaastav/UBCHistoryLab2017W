Tlio fourth nml farewell annual men-
sago of I'rcHldent ' Cleveland can be
commended ns n clear and adequate
prescnlntlon of public , questions. It
very properly begins with n. reference ,
entirely optimistic In tone , to the result
of the late political contest , In which
the president finds rcnson for fnlth In
the good sense and patriotism of the
people. What Mr. Cleveland sayw In
this connection offers no encouragement
to those who are still disposed to doubt
whether the people can be trusted to do
the right thing In a great emergency.
The position of the president on the
Cuban question , which Is the one of
{ omiunndlng Importance in our foreign
relation- * , will be approved by the con
servative Judgment of the country. It
should also be satisfactory to th Spnn-
Isli g .vernment , since It gives assuraneo
that the course thus far pursued by our
government will be adhered to by the
preAcnl administration If the conditions
In Cuba continue as they have been.
These are not of n nature , In the opinion
of ihe president , to justify any change
of lutttude on the part of the United
States. He conclusively answers the
proposals regarding belligerent rights
and the recognition of the Independence
of the Cubans , saying with respect
to the former that It would be untimely
and Injurious to our Interests. Un
doubtedly to accord belligerent rights
would result In destroying what remain
ing trade we have with Cuba , because
It would be followed by Spain block
ading every Cuban port. As to recog
nising the Independence of the Insur
gents , the president points out that they
have no government and that fact Is
sutllclent to dispose of the proposition.
As to Intervention , even at the cost of
war , Mr. Cleveland observes , while evi
dently believing that war between the
United States and Spain would speedily
end In victory for this country , that
"the United Stales has nevertheless a
character to maintain as a nation , which
plainly dictates that right and not
might should be thu rule of Its con
duct. " lint the president points out
that circumstances may arise that will
compel our government to take action
for bringing the contest In Cuba to an
end. lie remarks that "it cannot be
reasonably assumed that the hitherto
expectant attitude of the United State : ?
will be indefinitely maintained. " and he
describes a possible situation In which
our obligations to the sovereignty of
Spain "will bo superseded by higher
obligations which we can hardly hesi
tate to recognize and discharge. " In
his treatment of the Cuban question
Mr. Cleveland shows a clear and sound
understanding of the obligations and
the Interests of the United States and
It ought to make a good Impression
abroad.
Mr. Cleveland still has faith In the
adequacy of the present tariff law for
providing revenue. He admits that It
has shortcomings as a tariff reform
measure , but he thinks that if allowed a
fair opportunity it "will , in the near
future yield a revenue which , with rea
sonably economical expenditures , will
overcome all deficiencies. " A tariff law
that has been In operation more than
two years has certainly had a fair op
portunity and to continue it In face of
the record of uniform monthly deficits
would be supreme folly. What the
president offers In defense of this act
Is extremely weak and his idea that
making deficits Is not a matter that
need excite or disturb us will not com
mend Itself to the approbation of prac
tical men. It Is true that thu treasury
has n considerable sum of money on
hand , most of It obtained by the sale
of bonds , but this does licit warrant the
government In continuing to Increase
Its Indebtedness. The policy In the
past , under republican rule , has been
to provide enough revenuu to reduce
Indebtedness and there must bo a. re
turn to this policy If the solvency of
thu government is to be maintained.
Mr. Cleveland seems to be entirely
oblivions to this duty of the govern
ment. As a matter of fact the govern
ment is now living beyond its Income
and It should stop doing so as soon as
possible.
In regard to ( lie currency , Mr. Cleve
land again urges the retirement of the
greenbacks , offering no new argument
In support of the proposition , which It Is
needless to say will receive no consider
ation from congress. In this connec
tion he niaues a suggestion that merits
attention , which Is that of allowing the
organization of smaller banks anil In
less populous communities than are
now permitted. A bill for this purposu
was Introduced at ( lie last session of
congress , Intended to provide better
banking facilities In localities where
such facilities are inadequate.
Mr. Cleveland urges further legisla
tion against the trusts , existing laws
having proved Ineffective , and he con
cludes his message only the most Im
portant features of which we have here
noticed with an earnest appeal to con
gress for rigid economy In expenditures
that ought to be heedud.
Thu latest statistics regarding thu ex
ports of manufactures show a steady
progress. This evidence that the
products of our manufacturing Indus
tries are finding larger acceptance In
foreign markets attests the superiority
of American skill and .workmanshl.i )
and Is therefore very gratifying , Tlr.'re
Is no .question that In some lines the
nmnufaelurcni of the United .States ex
cel those of nny other country and this
with the greater cfllckMiey of American
labor ought to j > nable us to make con
tinued progress In the worlds' neutral
markets.
With regard to thu Increased exports
of the past year , the dllllculty Is to de
termine whether it has been really
profitable. The probability Is that much
of It has not hi-cn , that owing to ( lie
depression In the home market our
manufacturers have sent goods abroad
to be sold at prices which were unprofitable -
profitable , preferring to turn them Into
money even at a loss rather than hold
them. Hut the Introduction of Ameri
can goods Into foreign markets may bu
expected to have beneficial results , pro
vided we are able to make them at n
cost allowing competition with the
products of cheaper labor.
Uut what American manufacturers
wnut la more of the home market. Kor
the past two ycnrs they have been los
ing the share In the home market they
formerly had and they need to have
this restored to them. They may con
tinue to cultivate the foreign markets ,
but It Is here they must look for a fair
return on their Investments ,
< 1 ACCKl'IS.
The opinion expressed by Mr. Cleve
land In his message , that Venezuela
would assent to the treaty submitting
to arbitration the boundary dispute be
tween that country and Great llrltaln ,
was well founded. The secretary of
state has been Informed that the
Venezuelan government lias accepted
the agreement and has called n special
session of congress to consider It. Un
doubtedly the congress will approve the
action of the government and thus re
move from further controversy a matter
which has been n menace to the peace
ful relations of two great nations. The
president says of the treaty , which pro
vides for three arbitrators , that it is
eminently just and fair and a result
satisfactory to the countries concerned
Is to bu expected from It. The consum
mation of this agreement Is of great
Importance : us a precedent ami It Is
pretty safe to say that hereafter any
boundary disputes that may occur be
tween Kuropean nations and countries
In this hemisphere will be settled by
arbltiatlon. Kuropean governments ,
there Is every reason to bplleve , will
not hesitate to recognize this. Ger
man and French newspapers have pro
claimed that the acceptance by Kng-
land of the Monroe doctrine , under
which the United State's asserts Its
right to interpose In behalf of coun
tries In this hemisphere having foreign
controversies , has no binding force
upon other nations of Europe. Unques
tionably that Is true , but none the less
they will follow Kngland In this if ever
another exigency shall arise requiring
the assertion of the Monroe doctrine
ami there can bu no doubt that In time
the world will accept that doctrine as
u part of International law. They must
now understand that , this country will
never surrender It , even If a demand to
do so came from the combined powers
of Kurope.
The present administration has doup
nothing more creditable to It than the
consummation of the agreement for set
tltng the Venezuelan boundary dispute
by arbitration.
KXCOUllAdl !
The growth of the leading Amerlcai
cities has been chiefly due to the de
velopmunt of manufacturing Industry
Commerce alone will not support a
great population. Swapping Jackknlves
or speculating In corner lots doe.s no
create material wealth , although some
prople may make a living by It. Tin
true foundation of prosperity must In.
the opportunity offered , for employmen
to wageworkers. Our greatest cities
therefore , are the greatest manufaetur
Ing centers and the city that succeeds ii
attracting capital for niiuuifaclm-in ; ,
enterprises Is the city of.-greate.s
promise.
These fundamental truths should bt
kept constantly before thu men .inter
csted In promoting the growth 'am
prosperity of Omaha. The exporlenci ,
of all manufacturing centers lias beei
that their great concerns have rise !
from small beginnings. While present
Industrial conditions make It very dlf
Heult for small factories to compote
with large establishments backed bj
unlimited capital , yet tln y may ' bj
thrift , skill and business tact not onl.\
hold their own , but eventually reach a
level with their wealthier competitors
I'Jverythlug depends up/m the en
couragements offered those who are
seeking a location In which to venture
In manufacturing enterprise. In many
respeeN Omaha presents advantages
over other western cities as a location
for certain classes of mills and factories.
It has : i)0n,000 ( ) people within a radlu ; <
of UOO miles whose patronage can be
secured. The territory tributary to It
produces raw materials that can be
profitably worked up Into finished
products for which there Is a steady
demand. It offers laboring men cheap
living ami comforts which they cannot
get farther west. All that Is needed to
give Oirxha new factories and mills Is
such assistance from local capltali.s's
and property owners as will counter
balance Inducements offered to Investor ; ?
In other cities.
ICvery republican leader In congress
recognizes the fact that the popular
demand Is for a protective tariff , but
for a protective tariff framed upon cou
sin vat Ivo lines. Thu people have given
ovldi'tice that they oppose extremes In
tariff legislation In both directions. At
the same time they have condemned the
present Wilson tariff law and will not
be satisfied until It Is supplanted by a
law affording adequate protection to
American industries and Insuring lln-
government the revenue required to de
fray necessary expenses.
According to thu report of the Iowa

The district court of appeals at Wnshlng

company Is liable for blunders of Its em
ployes. A New York firm tclugraphed to a
customer that It would sell potatoes at 53
cents a bushel. As delivered the telpgran
read 45 centB. Two carloads were ordered
and customers wore found for half of the
consignment. Then the mistake was dis
covered and ho refused to accept the con
signment. Ife brought fiult to recover the

M. Carroll formerly represented a French

ment grunt It a concession when It wan
really English companies Vrhlch Intcrforred
to build the railroads ? Whereupon M.
.Mlehelln moved that the government grant
the railway concession to a French company
without guaranteeing Interest or granting

M. Lebon answered that the circular abol-

M. Guycsse. remarking that M. Mlcholln
had spoken of "English gold. " pointed out
that the English missionaries have been tin
ilrst victims of the disorders. Xo Important
change , lies been made since M. I.aroche
left tlie Island and General Galllcnl , the
president general of Madagascar , had" not
expelled any of the foreign missionaries.
M. de JInhy maintained that M. Laroche
had disobeyed the "bible" societies , who had
piotcctod him. adding : "These societies
are working thp ruin of our Inlluencc and
stealing our possessions. They arc to be
found throughout French territory , carrying
out political work. " In conclusion , M.

if ho approved of the action of General

"occult Influences. " ( Cheers. )
M. Hound- moved that the government

Eventually M. Mlehelln withdrew his mo

ENGLAND IN THE SOUDAN.
M. Delonclo proceeded to discuss the
Soudan , which , ho claimed , had entered on a
new plinsa. Would Franco , he asked , allow
an Anglo-Egpytlan expedition to go to Khar
toum ? In any case , lie remarked , If England
went there , cho would not stay , ao the
Dervishes , repulsed by the Congo Free State ,
Urn French and the English would reform
between Lake Tchad and the Upper Nile ,
causing trouble until the Khedive's authority
was restored by the neutralization of the
entire Nile basin. He penuted tlio idea of
in entente cordlale with Great llrltaln. who.
ho n. ertc.l. led Franco Into the t-loije ot
Antwerp , the Crimean war and the loss of
Syria. Franco , continued M. Delonele , must
make Great Britain rorpcct her rights.
Treaty ami diplomacy could bring that about.
Nevertheless he. M. Uelonclo , would vote for
the 200,000,000 francs asked for to Inciease
the ctrenglh of the French army.
I'rlnce d'Aronbcrg remarked that no

the loyal court chamberlain. He was nr-
rnetcd In June , 1391 , charged with l.a\ng !

LONDON , Dec , 8. The llorlln correspond
ent of the Dally News saya : An uneasy
feeling still exists that there immt be some
high perFonago behind Von Tausch. Mmij
names nro mentioned , but It would not be
fair to repeat them. The trial has , there
fore , failed to attain the chief object. Hut
It has been n political and personal success
for Ilaron Marschal von meliorate-In , who
has suddenly gained n place In the fore
front of Ocrnmiiy'fl statesmen. Ho has
purliled the political atmosphere nnd has
swept the Aegean stables of the political
police.
LONDON , Dee. S. The Dally Telegraph's

rent that while Von Tausch wna on his waj

out there will bo a trial In comparison with
whleh this Is mere child's , play. "

Deo. 7. ( New York World Cablegram Spe-
vlal Telegram. ) A terrible epidemic , known
In Spanish aa "mtiermo , " Is spreading
among the government cavalry horses.
About 10 per cent of the horsca and cattle
attacked recover.
The typhus fever prevalent among the
Spanish troops garrisoned along the western
troclia and at 1'aloclos nnd other I'luar del
Hlo towns , is attributed by physicians to the
eating of meat tainted by the dreadful
mucrmo , which first appeared some months
ago In adjacent cattle districts. The dls-
c-aso Is puzzling the beat of the Spanish
medical talent. Here in Havana several
pel sons , Including ono person of local Im
portance , have been attacked by It , dying
with all the tiymploms ehown In the anlm.il
v lil I ins. The butchers have been warned
ofilclally against killing cattle from the
Infected districts , and the once popular beef
steak Is seldom called for In Havana liotelj
and restaurants.
