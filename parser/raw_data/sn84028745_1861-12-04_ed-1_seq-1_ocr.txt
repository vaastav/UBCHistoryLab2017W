THE NUMBER OF SICK SOLDIERS.
The number of Union soldiers now on the

the country is estimated at sixty thousand,
which is in itself a great army ; but the per

in each hundred. Toe sanitary regulations
of the army are pronounced very defective

CAUSE OF THE QUARREL.
to
The warmth andkindnessof their greeting
somewhat surprised and disarmed us. "vvny,
gentlemen," said we, "for what possible
cauee are you and we talking the eaaie
language, sprung from the same ancestors,
professing the same faith, glorying in the
same history this day clutching at one an
other's throats, and striking at one another's
hearts?"
"Why," said one of them, "you have come
down upon us with a great army, invading
our soil, threatening our homes with fire and
our fields with desolation. What could we do
lesBthan meet war with war?"
" You struck the first blow," we replied.
"We were all living in profound peace a few
months ago. That peace it was the wish
atd the interest of the North to perpetuate.
Perhaps we were willing to make even too
large a sacrifice to avoid collision. All of a
sudden, without the shadow of provocation
from the North, except the quietly putting
their votes into the ballot-box, and electing
Abraham Lincoln, yon severed the Federal
bond, and seized on every ship, fort, mint
and arsenal belonging equally to us both,
within your reach. Even that, so inert and
averse to hostilities was the North, was pas
sively endured. The world began to think
us poltroons, and we half suspected it our
selves. At that hour there was undoubtedly
a great party at the North perhaps the
majority who were willing to say, 'Go in
peace, we will wait till you come to a better
mind, or do without you.' But a few scores
of brave men were left in one fort, who still
held fast to their allegiance to the old and
whole republic. They bought their daily
food in your market till you denied theui
the Dhvileee. The Government then
sent an unarmed vessel with supplies to
tbem. You fired on that unarmed vessel
end on the national flag that waved over it.
Even vet the North trembled and shrunk
back as it looked down into the fiery abyss
civil war. But you went further. You gir
dled that fortress with batteries. Without
the discbarge of a gun to provoke an attack,
vou assailed that handful of brave men with
odds of a hundred to one, and poured in shot
and shell npon them till the glorious flag
ourcountry went down on a mass or oiaes
ened rnins. Then the nation awoke. The
fall of Sumter, like the shock of an earth
quake, shook the Republic to its center.
Every feeling of reluctance, every partisan
division, vanished like a dream. A stern
determination to put the old Hag back on
everv tort, shiu and arsenal whence it had
been taken down, to reconstruct the old
Union just as it was took; possession or tue
American people with a unanimity which
there id nothing like in the history of nations.
And rely upon it, gentlemen, the sword that
was drawn then will never be sheathed till
the old flsg is restored to all its honors and
tbe old Union counts again Its thirty-three
States."
"Well," was the answer, "you may rest as
sured that jou can never conquer the South.
You may shut np our porta, you may out
our trade, yon may compel us to wear plain
clothes, but subdue us never 1"
Tbe maker of this last remark was Colonel

The Elements of Success Possessed by the
Rebels.
The Southern States, like their army, are
inferior in numbers and material. Tney are
certainly In want of ready money. The
Secretary of the Treasury their Minister of
Finance demands a loan of cash from the
planters, who ask him to purchase their cot
ton. And cash is scarce, for the Treasury
Notes have become the principal currency of
the country. In war, the want of bullion is
almost as bad as tbe want of bayonets, and
it will no doubt entail great difficulties and
embarressment on the Confederate Govern
ment. But Austria has carried on war while
in a state of semi-insolvency, and we doubt
not tbe ability ot the Confederate States to
do the same, supported as their Government
ib uy toe eniDusiasm ot tbe people, and con
ducted by sober and capable men. The men
of the Sonth are terribly in earnest. They
are passionate race, and they hate the North
with fraternal intensity. They are proud
and sensitive, and tbey despise tbe charac
ter and resent the boastfulness of tbe North
erners. Tbey are resting on a powder-magazine,
and they know tnat a Northern vic
tory would fling a lighted torch into its
midst. They would not for any considers
tion submit; and they dare not if they conld.
They darn not let their slaves see theta
beaten. Tbey are fighting not for profit, for
vengeance, for policy, for empire whatever
mnj have been the original motives of se
cessionbut for the security of their homes,
tbe honor of their women, for all that men
hold dear and SAcred. Invasion, plunder,
burring, murders in cold blood, incitements
to servile insurrection, contumely, outrage
and violations of all tbe laws of war such
as the trials of their seamen for piracy have
roused the whole South to bitter indigna
tion and unchangeable resolution, and no
material superiority can countervail the
moral advantage possessed by men who are
fighting on their own soil for liberty, prop
erty, borne, family and very life. It speaks
well for the rulers of the Confederate States
that, in the face of invasion, they have not
had recourse to tbe extraordinary usurpa
tions of power which the invading Govern
ment has found necessary in its provinces.
They have not suspended tbe habeas corpus,
tbey have not gagged the press. Within
the lines of their arm v the Richmond Whig
continnes to abuse Sir. Jefferson Davis as
securely and as virulently as the Globe abuses
Mr. Disraeli. It signifies little that half a
score of malcontents have sought tbe pro
tection of the Union at Cape Hutteras.
Twenty times as many would Hock to tbe
standard of tbe Confederates if it were raised
at New York or Baltimore. The union of
the South is proved by the conduct of its
Government, by the strength ot its armies.
v and by that absence of all information which
tiewiiders tne northern uenerals as com
Tifeiely as the division of sentiment in the
Norths is proved by the violent courses of

vacillation, make up for a vast inferiority in
numners ana resouces, ana leave tne Daiance
so even that no prudent man will venture to
expect a speedy issue to the equal oonllict.
How long the war may last it is impossible
to guess, but it seems to ns further from its
ecd than on tne day wnen the northern
nimy first crossed tbe Potomac.
Duty of Officers.
of
An officer should never be guilty of nro'
fanity or vulgarity, for it is not only forbid'
in ia .'artifice ftf urar 11 rmt tf to ar
detrimental to discipline and his own inter
esta that, if he is wise, he will entirely eschew
it himself, and strictly forbid it in his com
mand. If he does not heed this rnle he will
lose the respect of bis men, and, if that is
lost, every thing else is of but little value
he loses all command.
He should not be haughty, arrogant and
overbearing, but always evince a spirit of
sociability and frankness. He should freely
mix with his men while off duty, for volun
teers do never like tbeir orhcers to be too
reserved. He should frequently inquire into
their wants, and sympathize with them in
all their afflictions. He should encourage
cheerfulness and a friendly, brotherly feeling
among them, and act toward them like a
father toward his children. While he is
strict, be should be kind. He should carry
himself bold, erect and sprightly, without
falling into the common error of appearing
affected.
He should always be careful to show his
superiority in drill and in the rules and re
quirements of the army regulations, as well
as in the above mentioned qualities; and,
for this purpose, he should apply himself to
study, to become as near perfect in these
things as possible, for be will fall lower in
the estimation of his men with every serious
error be commits. He should cause all tbe
movements in tactics to be thoroughly ex
plained to the men, and Bhould do it himself
it ne is tnorougniy acquainted wim mem;
but if he is not, he should leave it to some
body else. Uniformity in the movements
and manual of arms Bhould be strictly ad
hered to, for nothing looks so bad as a va
riety of exercises in one company or regl
ment, and a variety of ways in the move
ments can not be tolerated at alL
All tbe duties of a soldier Bhould be thor
oughly impressed upon the minds of the men
by officers. Instructions should be given
deliberately, oautioasly. and minutely, espec
ially wben tbe men are placed on special
duty. Persons net acquainted with field
duties can not be aware of the importance
cautiousness, and do not know upon now
little a thing tbe lives ot tnousanas ot sol
dicis may be depending.

March of a European Armv. The fol
lowing picture of the German Army, on
march against the French in 1800, shows
that veteran officers and veteran troops
not always preserve a machine-like pre
cision of movement, any more than volun
teers :
The village of Auerstadt, through which
we had to pass, offered a picture of the
indescribable disorder. Infantry belonging
to the most varying regiments had come
on a march, and among them
powder-carriages, led-horses and the great
number or useless oaggage ana paca-ani-
mals, which blocked up most shamefully
roads along which the troops had to march.
In the midst of this turmoil could be
and heard shouting and oursing field
ficers, who could hardly hold their horses
in. and Adjutants, trying to foroe their
through and unable to suooeed; tne
varying orders were given by the most
persons at the full pitch of
lungs, which no one thought proper to
and ourses as powermi as the uerman
of that day knew were
about, mingled with the yells
shouts of many Poles belonging to
Prussian regiments, who were considerably
intoxicated. To this must be added
sound of the drums and fifes, the clashing
of the bugles, and the louder-growing
of the cannon : in short, it was a
fusion and disturbance such at I never
or heard again in my many later
paifns. ,

neetown Mr. Carl Stelnman visited Mount IT wit, in
Iceland, jast before the terrible eruption in
1845, and the following is his narrative of a
fearful adventure which hsppe ned to him upon
that sublime and desolate elevation:
Having secured a guide I set off, at an early
hour, on the morning following my arrival in
Balsun, (at the foot of ihe extlnot volcano,) pray
ing for fair weather, good luck, and a safe re
turn. The scenery, even from the first, was so dif
ferent from any I had ever seen outside of Ice
land, as to be worthy of a better description
than I am able to give. Suffice It to say that.
as you push on, ascending summit after summit
on your way to the great and awiai center or
all, ;ou find tbe danger, dreariness and desola
tion increase to the most terrible lublimt'y, till
at last, when yon do finally stand on the high
est point in this nnltvlng world of chaos, you
Ipstitctivtly pray God with an icy shudder
shivering through your miserable frame, to re
store yon to the life you seem to have left for
ever behind you.
OhI how shall I attempt to convey to any
niibd Ihe awfnl scene of desolation that sur
rounded me when at last I stood more than
four thousand feet above the level of the sea,
on the highest peak of the barren Heel. 6ix
monal hours three on horseback and three on
foot bad I been clambering upward from the
world below; and now, among the very elonds
that rolled ana swept around me, I stood In a
oild of lava mountains, ice and snow the
lava b ack as midnight, the snow ef blinding
whitrness and not in all that region a tree, a
but b, a shrub, a blade, or even a solitary living
thing, excepting self and guide.
far as tbe eye could reaon, wnen tne moving
clouds permitted me to see, was a succession of
block rugged runs, snow crowned peaks, gnt
t'TiLf; glaciers, and ice-bound streams, into
TtVisn ir animate solitude no human foot had
ever penet- ii'ed a world without plant or life
the very rci-olii'lon ot desolation niled wttn
yawning chn?tr.s, dreadful abysses and mid
night caves wnich have never echoed any sound
but the ihunders of Heaven, and the groanings
and convulsions of earth. So wi'd and terrible
was the scene that I felt a strange thrill, like
madness, rush through my Bhivering irame,
and quiver about my dizzy brain, and I
shtnted, to break the stillness of death, and
beard my voies come dismally back in a hun
dred echoes, till it seemed to be lost in the
bowels of the unproductive earth.
Wrapping one of tbe blankets about me, to
protect me from tbe freezing cold, and cau
tiously using my pointed s ick to try every foot
of ground before me, 1 now began to move
about over blocks and heaps, and hills of lava,
and across narrow chasms and pitfalls, and
pa'otaos of snow and ice, my faithful guide
keeping near and often warning me to be care
fnl of my steps. In this manner I at length
arceiided a ridge of considerable elevation,
stumbling my way to the top, and now and then
displacing fragments of lava that rolled crash
ing down behind me. As yet I had seen no
signs of the mouth of the crater, which, eighty
years before, bad vomited forth Its terrific and
desolating streams ot melted black sand; out on
reachibg the summit of this ridge I looked
down into a sort of basin, open at the lower
side, and having some three or four deep seams,
or chasms, in its center, into whiohthe melting
mow and ice on its sides were running in small
streams. A peculiar and not very agreeable
odor came np with a thin, smoky vapor, and I
fancied I could hear a distant sound, sometuipg
between a gurgle and a rumble. "
"I nippose this is the original crater," I said,
taming o the guide.
The fellow was as pale as death, and every
feature expressed surprise allied to fear.
"W bat is tbe matter?" 1 quickly demanded,
"have you never Been this spot before?"
"I have sees this place before, mister," he
replied, "but never any thing like this. When
I washere last there was no hollow here, bat
only a level plain of snow and ice."
'Indeedl" exclaimed I, feeling strangely tn
forested; "what, then, do you infer? that there
is about to be a fresh eruption?"
"I fear so, master; what el Be can have eaused
tbe chnnge7 You see there is heat below
which has melted tbe thick glaoier; and only
few streaks of ice now remain ! npon the upper
part of the sides, while all the center is gone."
"And tbe ground here has a slight eolcgjoti

laid my band npon it.
"Let us leave, master," returned the fellow,
hurriedly, looking around with an expression
of alarm. "I do not like to remain hore;
may be destroyed at any moment. Let us hasten
down and reportwhat we have seen."
"Nay," said I, feeling strangely interested
and fasoinated by the perilous novelty, "I -do
tbink there is any immediate danger, ior
snow and ice, as is plain to be seen, have melted
slowly, and before 1 go away, never to return,
I should like to venture into this baiiln and look
down into one of those ohasms."
"Oh, on, master!" replied the guide, with ner
vous anxiety, "do not do itl it might eost
your lifel"
"At least l win risk u it you wiu agree
wait for me." said I. fully determined on
venture, even though I were to go without
consent.
"I will wait." he answered, "but remember.
master, you go down against my advioel"
The ora'er or hollow was about fifty feet
dep-h, wi h gently sloping sides; and axing
pointed stiok with the greatest care, I forth

the temper of the lava with my hand, and find
ing it gradually grow warmer as I proceeded,
thniiBh not autiioientiv sc to exoite any aiarm.
In a short time I reacned tne nottom,
stood on the verte of one of tbe seams
ebasms. which opened far, far down into
heart of tbe mountain, it was about, lour
in width; ilgzag in shape, and emitted strongly
tbe peculiar odor before mentioned. A imau,
trickling stream, from a melting layer of
above, was running into n; out i oouia
see that it was lost in tbe deep darkness below,
from whioh came up a kind of hissing, boiling,
sn ruin ir annnd. with something use a mmoiiug
shook at Blight intervals, and puffs of heated
air.
The place, the scene, and withal the sense
danger eonneotea wita it, neia me mora wiva
sort of magnetic fasoination. and I soon
myself strongly tempted to make a fatal plunge
into the awful abyss. Knowing by experience
that reason Is not always able to govern
eontrol the aotions in such eases, l forced
self back a few feet, bat still remained near
opening, deaf to the entreaties of my frightened
guide; who now began to implore me to
before it should be too late. As the dread
eano had not been in aetion for more than
fears before his birth, I believed that he
Vnow no more of the danger than myself,
therefore preferred to aot from the diotates
my own feelings rather inan nut reare; ana

little disnosed to be hurried from a place
bad oost me so muoh time, money, and
to visit
Olvlnir no heed, therefore, to his earnest
licitations, I resolved to sound, if possible,
depth of the chasm before me, and then
to intfteot the others; and for this purpose
pried on from a larger one a suuau oiooa
lava, and advancing to the vary edge of
chasm, dropped it down, ana iisieaea to
hntlnw reverberations, as ll went Dounaiog
from side to side, long after it was lost to
eve. The depth was to immense that I
it for more than a minute; and then the
Mimed rather to die out from distance, than
eease because of tbe block having readied
destination. It was an awful depth, and
fully impressed me with the terrible: and
luny impross.il mm win wsnu.wi uv
draw hank with a shudder, a tntt Of hot,
phurous air rushed and roared upward,
bv a steam-like vapor, and a heavy,
sound, as If a eannon had been disoharged

and I had already turned for the purpose, when
suddenly there osme a sort of rumbling orah,
and the ground, shaking, heaving and rolling
under tn", began to erumble off into tbe dread
ab)is. I was thrown down, and, en my bands
and knee, praying God for mercy, was scram
blingover It and upward, to stye myself from a
most horrible tate, when twe blocks, rolling
together, eanght my feet and legs between
tbem, and, without actually ormhlng, held them
ai if in a vice. Then came another crieo and
crumble, the lava Slid away from behind ms,
and I was left upon the very verge of the awful
gulf, now widened to some fifteen or twenty
feet, down into which I looked with horror
g'rained eyes, only to see darkness ani death
below, and breathe the almost soffooatlng .va
pors that ruiheoTup from that seemingly bottom-
ess pit. ,
Oh. the horrors of that awful realizitionl
what pen er tongue can portray tbem? there,
a helpless but conscious prisoner, suspended
over the mouth of a black and heated abyss, to
be hurled downward by the next great throw of
trembling Nature.
"lielpl help! helpl for the love of God, holpl"
I screamed, In the very agony of a wild de
spair. I looked up aed around to catch a glimpse oi
my guide; but he was gone, and I had nothing
to rely on but the meroy of Heaven, and I
prayed to uod, as I never prayed before, for a
orgiveness of my sins, that they might not
ollow me to judgment. It might be a second.
it might be a minute, it might be an hour, that
I should have thus to undergo a living death;
but be the time long or shore, I felt there was
no escape from a doom that even now makes me
grow pale and shadier when 1 think of it.
Above me was a clear blue sky beneath ma a
black and horrible abyss around me sickening
vapors that made my brain grow dirsy. Ram
bling and hissing sonnds warned me that
another convulsion might oocnr at any moment,
and another would be the last of me. Home
and friends I should never see again, ani my
tomb would be the voloanio Heolal I strove,
with the madness of desperation, to disengage
my Imprisoned limbs, but I might as well have
attempted to move a mountain. There I was
fixed and fastened for tbe terrible death I was
awaiting. Oh, God of mercy I what a fa'el
Snddmly I beard a shout, and, looking
around, I beheld, with feelings that I can not
dosctibe, my faithful guide hss'enlng down the
mgged sides of the erater to my relief. He had
fled in terror at the first alarming demonstra
tion, but had nobly returned to save me, if pos
Bible, by risking his lile for mine. May Uod
reward him as he deserves!
I warned you, masttr," he said, as he came
np psnting, his eyes half starting from his head,
and his whole countenance expressing com
mingled terror and pity.
"loudidl you didr'oned 1, "bat, oh! forgive

You are alreidy forgiven, master, aid I
will save yeu if I ean save jou or perish with
you.
Instantly be set to work witb his iron-pointed
stick to break tbe lava around my limb, but
had scarcely made any proeress when again
tbe earth trembled, and the blocks parted, ons
of them rolling down into the yawning chasm
witbadull, hollow sound. 1 sprang forward
I seized t- hand of the guie we both struggled
bard, and tbe next moment we had botn fallen,
looked in each other's arms, upon the solid earth
above. I was free, but still on the verge of the
pit, and any moment we might both be bur ed
to destruction.
.. "Quick, master!" cried the guide, "up! up!
and run for yonr lif'l"
r ll staggered to my foet, with a wild cry of
hope and fear, and, half supported by my faith
ful companion, hurried up the sloping sides of
the crater. As we r ached the ridge above, the
ground shook with a heavy explosion; and,
looking back, I beheld with horror aditk, smok
ing pit, where we had so lately stood.
And then, without waiting to see more, turn
ed and fled over the rough ground as fast as
my bruised limbs would let me, We reaohed
ourhotsesin safety, and hurrying down the
mountain, give the alarm to tbe villagers, who
joined us in our night across the oountry uu

The Secretary of the Confederate States Navy
invites proposals for the construction ef four
sea going, iron dad and ballproot steam ram
ships, to oarry at least four heavy guns each.
Abe JNBuhviiie correspondent oi tne Argus,
in a letter dated November 19th, says :
Events are crowding on us very rapidly.
Battles must be fought soon in Virginia and
Kentooky. In the next few days, in all prob
ability, a battle will have been fought at Ma
nassas, at Howling Ureen and Columbus. Kich
mond'B fate depends on the first, Nashville
tbe cecond, and Memphis on the third,
Impression now is, Memphis is in more danger
than either of the other cities. The question
very naturally arises, will the Confederate
States neglect the Mississippi Valley ? Will
they not reintorce Polk at Columbus, and save
Memphis and tbe Valley Y 1 trust they will.
One thing is certain, the tug of war has eome.
From this time on the war will be no child's
play. Look out for great events."

five miles, for the admitted purpose of protect

"Bisolved, Tbat tbe Sergeant-at-Arms be

has accrued since me close ot tbe extra ses

pare and submit a proposition, something like
an obituary notice of his colleague. Laugh

declared, in armed rebellion, but heads a
provisional government in Kentucky a rev

the treatment of this Government to main

of his State, be ( Burnett) has assumed the
important duty of organizing another gov

Simon Buckner, who is not only somewhat
assimilated in name, but in tbe deeds of
Simon Girty, who once headed the Indians
in Kentucky.
Tbree times bag tbe gallant state of Ken
tucky declared, by overwhelming majorities,
she would not leave the United States to run
after strange gods, or for the so-called Southern
Republic. Notwithstanding her repeated
declarations for the Union, and in violation
of the well known sentiments of the people
of Kentucky, tbey had been told tbe object
of tbe Convention and of the so-called South
ern Confederacy was to relieve them from
despotism, and to protect their rights, and
we were deceived. We were told by the
Executive of this so-called Southern Confed
eracy, it was intended to respect the condi
tion of Kentucky, which it was pretended
would not be done by the Government
the United States. Tbe Union men of Ken
tucky never did deny the right of the Fed
eral Government to occupy its soil for the
exerciEe ot the purposes implied by the Uon
fct tntion.
Kentucky did acknowledge her obligations,
and expressed her intention to fulfill them.
The proclamation of the Governor of Ken
tucky deceived the people, but tbe Legis
lature denounced it. Two messengers

was intended to be done with Kentucky.
