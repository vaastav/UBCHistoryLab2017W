FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1889.
Jkffkrsox Davis is very ill, and it
is evident that his days are numbered.
COXURKSS has commenced its ses
sion. but who can say where it will
end!
Thk office- seeker is swooping down
on the Congressman like a wolf on the
fold.
Notwithstanding the great quan
tity of foul weather this fall, turkeys
are scarce and chickens high.
Thk Democrats made a pretty fair
start in Congress by electing one offi
cer of the House? the Chaplain.
This lias been a wet year, but Bos
ton and Lynn have suffered more
from the opposite element than they
have from water.
Thkrk has been no relative of the
President appointed to office this
week yet? probably waiting for some
of them to grow up.
All the Democrat!" Congressmen
from West Virginia whose seat* are
conte>t??d were sworn in without any
di>turhance on Monday.
It is believed by many that Hon.
Samuel J. Randall will never recover
from his present illne>s. He has not
been able to appear in Congres.- yet.
A t( LORKI) woman has been ap
pointed postmistress at Eola. in Lou
i>iana. and the people of that com
munity are raiding a big row about
it.
Thkrk is one consolation, anyhow
?if Congress shall follow the Repub
lican idea a- to pensions there need
be no fear of extravagance in any
other direction.
Thk Republican majority in Con
gre-;. ha? but a Reed to depend upon,
though, fortunately for them, it i? a
very stout one. Nevertheless it may I
be broken before winder is over.
This Congress should not go too far
into investigating committees. it i?
a kind of work that costs much and
results in little. ? Baltimore American, j
Dox't want your party found out. i
It is now said that the gubernato
rial contest committee will have its
report ready next we^k. They say |
the report will be very exhaustive?
probably to correspond with the ex- j
hausted state of the public.
A BLOODTHIRSTY mob in W isconsin j
laj-t week lynched a poor insane man j
in the most fiendish manner siuiply ;
because they wanted to get rid of !
hiin. Northern papers will please I
note that this outrage was not com
mitted in the South.
Wk take pleasure in noting the
election of Mr. Charles W. Adams, of
Sharpsburg. as doorkeeper of the
House of Representatives. We know
of no Republican whose success in
this connection it would give us
more pleasure to record, and there is ;
no doubt that he will prove a eapa- !
ble and trustworthy official.
Evkn the Republican leaders are j
beginning to sp^ak in favor of a re- i
vision of tariff, and they say a tariff
bill will be passed by the present
Congress. But the country wants a
tariff bill formed by the friends of j
the laboring people and the consu- i
mers. not by the colleague? of the
rich manufacturers and monopo- ,
lists.
The other day a delegation waited
on the Postmaster-General to urge
the appointment of a certain gentle
man for postmaster at Baltimore. ,
They described in glowing terms his I
many good points as a (j. A. R. man
and went intoecatacies over his record
as a political manager. Then they
gracefully bowed themaelver away
without having said a word as to his
business qualifications.
Compared with the original, cour- i
ageous and interesting state papers
of Mr. Cleveland, President Harrison's !
message isa fiat failure. There is no
ringing declaration for the welfare
of the people, no bold stand against :
the many corporate evils and trusts
that imperil our free institutions, j
Like the author, the message is nar
row and partisan, and elicits nospark
of admiration from even his party as
sociates.
COSGRKSS was formally opened on
Monday last. Vice-President Morton
presided in the Senate, where little
business was done except to swear in
the new Senators from the recently I
adiuitted States. Mr. Reed, of Maine,
"was elected Speaker of the House of
Representatives by the Republicans,
the Democrats casting their votes for
Mr. Carlisle. The Republicans elect
ed their caucus nominee for clerk
Edward Mcpherson, of Pennsylvania;
A. J. Holmes, of Iowa, Sergeant-at.
arms; and Charles W. Adams, of Mary
land, door keeper. Several Republi
can members bolted the caucus nom
inee for chaplain, and Rev. Mr. Mil
bum, the blind preacher, was elected.
Thk Chariest own Spirit of Tuesday
?ays: Our brethren of the Republi
can household of faith had a meet
ing in the court-bouse at this place
last Saturday. It purported to be an
Executive Committee meeting, but
as to what it really was a Kilkenny
cat fight was nowhere? if what we
learn about it be true; and our infor
mation is from a source not to be
doubted. In addition to squabbles
about other matters. Col. Black and
Jas. D. Butt. Esq., claimed in be
half of the colored voters of the party
that as that element largely prepon
derated in its strength, it should be
represented irksome degree at least in
its benefits? *. that all the appoint
ments should not be given to the
small minority of the party in this
county, and the great majority left
entirely out in the cold, without
a single sop to soothe its hunjrry maw.
If this practice was to continue, it
was asserted, Jefferson county would
at the next election give two thousand
Democratic majority. The colored
brother was again, nevertheless, left
out in the cold, and his enthusiasm
for the g. o. p. fs reported on the
wane.
The President's Massage.
The President's message to Congress
is admirable in form and comprehen
sive in scope, referring in dignified
and well-CDOsen phraser to all- the
topics of domestic and foreign con
cern that now occupy the public
mind. In substance it is, for the
most part, a paraphrase of the
Chicago platform. Protective
tariff views are presented in uncom
promising language, and a strengthen
ing of the strong arm of the federal
government, with the object of con
trolling Southern elections, is
urged with partisan zeal. The mes
sage opens with the usual review of
our foreign relations, which are de
scribed as in all cases amicable and
cordial. The presence at Washington
at our invitation of representatives
of thirty-three nations iu attendance
upon the meetings of the Maritime
aud Pan-American Conferences is ap
propriately recognized. Canada's
conduct toward our fishermen dur
ing the past year is referred to in
complimentary terms, and it is recom
mended that * a treaty with Great
Britain, enlarging the list of extradi- 1
table offenses, be ratified. This
changed attitude since the republi
can party's acquisition of power is
emphasized by further recommenda
tions looking to more harmoniuus re
lations with our northern neighlor. j
Claims of our citizens in Peru and at
Lisbou are mentioned as having the
strong sympathy of the administra- j
tiou. The important announcement
is made that our recognition of the
Brazilian republic is to be deferred
until the majority of the people of
Brazil shall have signified their assent
to its establishment. Returning
within the sphere of domestic con- :
Cerns, the President finds a general ;
condition of prosperity prevailing in
the United .States. The excess of re
ceipts ever expenditure.- in the pa-t ;
fiscal year, after provision for the |
sinking fund, was $57,470,129. In the
present fiscal year the estimated sur
plus is ?-13.678.883. In the fiscal year ,
ending June 30, 1881, there will be, it :
is estimated, a surplus of receipts |
over expenditures of $43,569,522, with |
a prospect of even larger figures, j
This actual and prospective excess of
receipt.- requires, sa\ s tiie President,
"the attention of ? 'ongres.-, with a
view to reducing the receipts of the
treasury to the needs of the govern
ment.*" A reduction of taxation is
not ur.'ed. as it is practicable to "re- |
du<-e receipts" by increasing tariff ;
taxes to the point" of prohibiting im- j
ports that compete with our favored
ludu-tries. Tlie President does not |
adopt Mr. Cleveland's phrase. "L'n- I
necessary taxation is unjust taxation." j
but puts it more mildly. "The collec
tion of moneys not needed imposes." |
he says, "an unnecessary burden." j
A change in his opinion as to the
proper use to be made of treasury
surpluses is manifested in the state
ment of his message that "we should
not collect revenue for the purpose
of anticipating our bonds." During
the presidential campaign of 1888 he
held in numerous speeches that the
purchase of bond- with the surplus
was the best possible use to be made
of the money, and that a reduction
of taxation" was therefore entirely
unnecessary. Mr. Cleveland's device
to put the money raised by unneces
sary taxes back into circulation by
loaning it to the banks in various
sections of the country Mr. Harrison j
still condemns, though he does not ;
tell how, in default of 4 'anticipating '
our bonds," a dearth of circulation '
was to be averted. The deposits still ;
with the banks, after so long an in
terval, will accordingly, it is announ
ced, be gradually withdrawn. To "re
duce receipt.-." the President recom
mends "a revision of the tariff law,
both in its administrative features
and in its schedules." It does not
appear that he favors a reduction of
tariff taxes. "The inequalities of the
law," he -avs. "should be adjusted,
but the protective principle should
be maintained." There shouldbe.it
seems, a leveling up rather than a
cutting down of taxes. Tin-plate, j
wool aud woolens, for example, pre- j
sent "inequalities." according to pro I
teciionist views, by being taxed too 1
little under the existing tariff. The
specific changes recommended are an !
extension of the free list by putting |
on it classes of articles not made in |
the country, and the removal of the
internal tax on tobacco aud on whis
ky used in the arts.
With respect to silver the President
i- rather non-committal. He affirms
that no harm has come of the larire
coinage of silver dollars since 1878.
but thinks "we should not tread the i
dangerous edge" of the peril that j
may come of "any considerable in- j
crease of the present rate of coinage."
Upon the whole, however, he is dis- i
posed to think favorable of Secretary
Window's plan for the issuance of cer- !
tificates upon the deposit of silver bul- !
lion at its market value. The Presi
dent is evidently indispo-ed to "tread
the dangerous edge"' in politics by
taking a decided course on a question
having so equivocal a future. He is
more explicitly favorable to a large
appropriation for forts, ships and
guns and for the improvement of our
rivers and harbors. A few large
work- at a time is, he thinks the wiser
plan. The question of drastic legisla
nun ior lue ouuni is approacueu
through a recommendation. suggest
ed by the Terry-Field case, that fed
eral officials be withdrawn from the
jurisdiction of the States courts.
"Events." he continues, "happening
in other parts of the country" suggest
that law* should be passed to protect
witnesses from intimidation or from
injury on account of their testimony
in the United States courts. The *-a
crwdness of government officials here
proposed and contempt of local opin
ion of witnesses would be approved
doubtless by the present regime in
Ireland, but we can hardly desire
that a section of this country of the
extent of the South should be con
verted for party purposes into anoth
er Ireland. Such unquestionably
would be the result of the legislation
the President recommends in a truc
ulent tone for the supervision and con
trol of elections in South. The color
ed population of that section, he al
leges, is "deprived of any effective ex
ercise of their political rights and of
many of their civil rights." This is in
ferred, it appears, from the fact that
the negro of the South does not send
republican representatives to Con
gress to support theprotective policy.
This neglect on his part the President
terms a "flagrant evil," calls it a "prob
lem," and a>ks rhetorically "when is
, he to have those full civil rights which
have so long been his in law?" Con
gress is "earnestly invoked" to use its
powers "wisely but firuilv" to protect
the colored man "in all his relations
to the federal governient, whether as
litigant, juror, witness, elector for
members of Congress or as a traveler
on our interstate railways." From
the bloody shirt question the message
proceeds to the question of subsidies,
and it is recommended that such ap
propriations be made for ocean mail
service in America, China and Japan
| "as will be liberally remunerative"
and "will encourage" American ship
owners. To aid further this artificial
stimulus to our steamships, as against
oursailingships.it is proposed that
we shall also give a subsidy to all
steamers constructed in such a man
ner that in case of war they can be
1 converted into cruisers. Other meas
ures recommended to the favor of
Congress are the Blair education bill,
the civil-service commission's appeal
for more clerks, an appropriation to
promote the world's fair of 189-?, a sep
aration of the weather service from
the War Department and its incorpo
ration with the Agricultural Depart
ment, a bill to pension every ex-soldier
who is dependent on his exertions for
support and is for any reason unable
to earn it, a territorial government
for Oklahoma, and an investigation
i into the jurisdiction of the federal
I government in relation to trusts. It
is also recommended that intermed
iate courts having final appellate jur
isdiction of certain classes of cases be
created for the rel'ef of the Supreme
Court, which is now overwhelmed
with business. The message is. upon
the whole, a clear and concise discus
sion of the matters treated, but of the
breadth of view and national spirit it
betrays the less said, perhaps, the bet
ter. - Baltimore Sun.

do better work this term than last,
as we begin under more favorable
circumstances.
Two new names have already been
added to the roll for this term. Miss
Julia E. Lucas and Mr. Oscar M.
Lucas. We hope more people will
show their appreciation of the good
school they have so near them by
seuding their children.
The Calisthenic Class is now taking
the advanced course with wands.
If there is any one who would like to
take they may begin at any time.
