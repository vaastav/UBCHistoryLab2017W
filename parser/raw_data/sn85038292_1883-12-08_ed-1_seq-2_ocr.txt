SATURDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1883.
Position of the Democracy.
Those Republicans who were counting upon
Democratic blunders in Congress for success
next year must feel depressed over the first
move of the Democracy. The election of
Hon, John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, by so
overwhelming a vote, is an aggressive step on
a platform of revenue reform. Mr. Carlisle
is an able and consistent revenue reformer,
ile is not a free-trader, for free trade by the
nature of oipj government and the opposition
of the people to national direct taxes, is an
impossibility; but ho is for reducing the pub
lic expenses to the lowest limit consistent with
an efficient public service, and the reduction
of the taxes to an amount only sufficient for
the needs of the government. Just how this
will be effected, has not yet been settled, and
there is a difference of opinion among Demo
crats. Some are for a reduction of the tariff
—not a radical change, but a gradual one, the
periods of reduction set a considerable time
ahead. Others favor an abolition of the in
ternal revenue. Mr. Carlisle, himself, favors
a revisloujof the tariff, at all events —an equal
ization—as the present one is discriminating in
its character, and some of its provisions are
simply buncombe. We doubt not that under
Mr. Carlisle’s leadership a genuine revenue
reform, such as the people declared for in
1882, when they changed a Republican ma
jority of about twenty in Congress to a Demo
cratic majority of seventy-six, will be accom
plished—at least the policy of the government
will be set in that direction, for it will take
some years of gradual approach to bring the
government back to the ante-bellum days of
economy and frugality.
Although Mr. Carlisle has been in Congress
but six years, his ability, sincerity and sound
tariff and financial views have given him a
national reputation. He has always been
outspoken on revenue reform, and his large
vole shows that the country accords with his
views. To his one hundred and six votes
should be added the thirty given to Mr. Cox,
making one hundred and thirty-six to fifty
two for Mr. Randall. Even that does not
show the strength of Mr. Carlisle s position on
revenue reform among Democrats, for Mr.
Randall received some votes —four from Ma
ryland, at least—on personal grounds. His
vote was mainly from the Southwest and the
great West, though he got a vote from Massa
chusetts, two from California and the only
vote from Nevada. Mr. Cox, who stood on
a platform very similar to Mr. Carlisle s, re
ceived his thirty votes from the following
states —one from Alabama, three from Cali
fornia, one from Illinois, one from Indiana,
one from lowa, two from Massachusetts, two
from Missouri, thirteen from New York, five
from Ohio and one from Tennessee. It is
thus seen that Mr. Carlisle’s platform is en
dorsed by every section of the country.
What is thought of Mr. Carlisle’s election
and the position of the Democratic party on
revenue reform may be learned from the ex
tracts from leading Democratic, Republican
and Independent papers throughout the coun
try published in this issue. It will be ob
served that the New York Times, the leading
Republican paper in the couutry, says that
Mr. Carlisle’s views are endorsed by a great
many Republicans as well as the Democratic
party, and warns its party that if it resists j
revenue reform it will go before the country
next year obviously weak.
The Issue of 1884.
Revenue Reform will be the leading issue
of 1884. The Democrats have made it so, j
and they will go before the country on that |
platform confident of success. It will be an j
aggressive campaign, fought upon principle.
Tariff for revenue was a plank in the last
Democratic national platform. Although the j
party shrmik.from its discussion, the Repub
cans took it up and made their whole fight |
upon it. Yet, while they lost the Presidency, [
the Democrats had a majority on the popular .
vole, and would have elected their candidates j
but for the wholesale corruption of voters by
money in Indiana, Ohio and New York par
ticularly, and throughout the country in gen
eral. Tariff for revenue won in Ohio last
October, and will win in nearly every Western
state next year. The South with Ohio, Indi
ana and Illinois, with their 210 electoral votes,
can elect a Democratic President without
the aid of any Northern, Eastern or Pacific
state. Yet both New Jersey and New York
can be carried on the platform of revenue re
form, also California and perhaps other states.
The four Democratic congressmen from this .
state voted against the views of their constit
uencies in the Democratic caucus last Satur
day night. Whether they did it as a personal
favor or for the hope of position, it was wrong.
Neither the one nor the other should weigh
with representatives of the people. If they
voted their sentiments, it was wrong, and a
misrepresentation of those who elected them.
A representative of the people should sink
self and reflect the views of his constituents.
None other can be a representative man.
Maryland Democrats are opposed to protec
tive tariff's for the sake of protection, and
when their delegates voted for Randall for
Speaker of the House, they voted against the
sentiments and interests of the party. Let us
send new men to the next congress.
President Arthur transmitted his third an
nual message to Congress on Tuesday. It is
shorter than such documents usually are, yet i
too long for the columns of a weekly paper, j
and we publish a synopsis of it from the Bal
timore Sun. This will be sufficient, for it is I
a good summary, and few of our readers
would care to read the whole message.
The President has not said much to pro
voke criticism, favorable or otherwise. The
most of his message is a mere recital, in a
business way, of facts and figures, and con
tains but few recommendations.
Alexander K. McClure, editor of the Phil
adelphia Times, who for some years squinted j
towards Democracy, is now giving evidence
of dementia. He is for opposing the South
ern “sectionalism’’ of the Democrats, as al
leged in the election of Carlisle ns Speaker,
by nominating Grant, “the strongest candi
date northern sectionalism can present,’’ who
would carry more southern states than any
Republican in the country." If McClure does
not need a straight jacket, then he is entitled
to the cap and bells.
. . ——
Congress has organized and gone to work, j
but little will be done until after the commit- |
tees are formed in the House, which will be
done next week. Two amendments to the
constitution have been proposed in the Sen
nte —one on civil rights of negroes, and the
other to prohibit the manufacture, sale and
importation of alcoholic liquors. Quite a
number of bills have been introduced in each
house on various subjects, many of which will
not, and should not, ever get further than
committee-rooms.
The Virginia Legislature convened on Mon
day last, the Democrats controlling both
branches. In the House a member elected as
a Mahoneite voted with the Democrats in
electing officers. It is thought that other
Democratic Readjusters will return to their
old party before the session closes. In the
Senate on Wednesday a resolution was intro
duced requesting Mahone to resign as United ;
States Senator. Senator Wickham voted i
with the Democrat* in organizing the Senate, i
The Speakership.
| Hon. John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, was
i on Saturday night last nominated for Speaker
1 of the House of Representatives by the Dcm
! ocratic caucus, and was formally elected at
the opening of the session on Tuesday over
Keifer, who. together with the officers of the
last House, were renominated by the Repub
lican caucus. Mr. Carlisle had two com
petitors for Speaker, Hon. Samuel Randall,
of Pennsylvania, and S. S. Cox, of New York.
The vote in canons stood—Carlisle 106, Ran
dall 52, Cox !!0.
Hon. John B. Clarke, of Missouri, was
nominated for clerk over J. D. C. Atkins, of
Tennessee, the vote standing 95 to 92. John
P. Lccdom, of Ohio, was chosen for sergeant
at-arms by acclamation; J. G. Winlcrsmith,
of Texas, was nominated for doorkeeper, and
L. Dalton, of Indiana, for postmaster. These
were all formally elected at the session of
Congress on Tuesday.
The Democratic caucus, on motion of Gen.
Slocum, of New York, unanimously voted to
continue all the old soldiers employed by the
last House.
SKETCH OF MU. CARLISLE.
Mr. Carlisle was born in Campbell (now
Kenton; county, Ky., Sept. 0, 1885. After
completing his studies he taught school in his
native county and later at Covington. He
studied law with ex-Gov. Stevenson, who has
since been in the United States Senate, and
who is as fond as he is proud of his pupil.
Mr. Carlisle’s entrance into politics followed
close upon his admission to the bar. In 1859
he was a member of the State House of Rep
resentatives; was nominated for presidential
elector on the Democratic ticket in 1804, but
declined; was elected to the State Senate in
1860 and re-elected in 1869; was a delegate at
large from Kentucky to the national conven
tion at New York in the summer of 1868; was
nominated for Lieutenant-Governor of Ken
tucky ip May, 1871; resigned his seat in the
Senate in June, 1871, and served as Lieuten
ant-Governor for the four years following;
was a presidential elector for the State at
large in 1870. His congressional career be
gan March 5, 1877, when the Forty-fifth Con
gress commenced, and he has therefore been
only six years in achieving a national reputa
tion for robust and vigorous leadership.
Mr. Carlisle’s views on public questions are
indicated in the following extract from a
speech made two years ago, before his name
had been seriously canvassed in connection
with the speakership contest:
“In the broad and sweeping sense which
the use of the term generally implies, I am
not a free-trader. Of course, that is under
stood. At least it should be. I will add that,
in my judgment, it will be years yet before
anything in the nature of free trade would be
wise or practicable for the United States.
When we speak of this subject we refer to ap
proximate free trade, which has no idea of
crippling the growth of home industries, but
simply of scaling down the iniquities of the
tariff schedule, where they are utterly out of
proportion to the demands of that growth.
After we have calmly stood by and allowed
monopolies to grow fat, we should not be
asked to make them bloated. Our enormous
surplus revenues are illogical and oppressive.
It is entirely undemocratic to continue these
burdens on the people for years and years
after the requirements of protection have been
met and the representatives of these industries '
have become encrusted with wealth. This is
I the general proposition on which I stand.
The rest is mere matter of detail, to be settled
with judgment, discretion and caution, but at
the same time iu a perfectly fearless spirit.
There has not been a time in twenty years
when the people were so thoroughly aroused
on this subject, and it is the true policy of the
Democratic party to make its appeal to the ;
voting masses, and meet this hydra-headed ■
monopoly in solid phalanx.”
COMMENTS OF THE PRESS.
From the Baltimore Sun: “What Mr. Car- ;
i lisle’s election does mean is revenue reform,
directed by a wise and conservative intelli
gence. For this the Democratic party has ]
unequivocally declared, and as a party it is to
be congratulated upon the possession ot the |
; courage required to take its stand in the out
set upon so important a principle. There is
no “Democratic mistake" here. The cry of
“Wolf!” cannot prove effective against so
popular a programme.”
New York Times, Republican: “Thenom
ination of Mr. Carlisle shows that there is
j more life in the Democratic party than had
j been generally supposed, and of a healthful
sort, which is a matter for congratulation all
around. Mr. Carlisle is by far the best rep
i resentative among the candidates for the noin
: ination of those Democrats who have cottyic
| tions and conscience, and it is a good thing
for the country that they are found to be in
the majority—and a considerable majority—
-lat Washington. Mr. Carlisle has a definite
| and intelligent policy, which he has plainly
| set forth and lived up to with unusual fidelity.
J Mr. Carlisle will undoubtedly form his com
| mittees so as to bring before the House the
i qu stion of further reduction of the tariff’,
j He will certainly be sustained in it by the ap-
I proval of a very large portion of the Republi-
I can voters. If the Republican Representa
[ lives on the committees and in the House
[shall offer to this policy a blind and partisan
'’opposition, then they will so far force the Rc-
I publican organization to follow them, and it
| is not improbable that the canvass of next
year may be one between the Democrats for
rational revenue reform and the Republicans
for extreme protection, and in such a canvass,
with reference to this issue, the Republicans
would obviously be weak, because they would
be arrayed against the best interests and the
strong tendency of the people. The nomina
tion of Mr. Carlisle in itself shows a public
opinion throughout wide sections of the coun
try strong enough to overcome completely
the tactics of the mere politicians and to defy
the influences exerted by the most highly pro
tected industries. That opinion is not by any
means confined to the Democrats. It is na
tional.”
New York World (Dem.): “Mr. Carlisle’s |
canvass has been simply an appeal to Demo
cratic sincerity. He is not elected as a free
trader or an extreme protectionist. He will
have no special interests to subserve. He I
will not be expected to make Republican alli
ances. He is a revenue reformer. In this
he is in accord with the large majority of his
party and in antagonism to Republicanism,
which opposes every retrenchment and re
form.”
The New York Herald (Ind.) says: “At
last there is a promise of a Democratic party.
Mr. Carlisle was last night chosen Speaker by
the Democratic caucus at Washington. That
means a change, a very great and beneficent
change,’ iu Democratic policies. It means I
that the old fogies of the party, the men afraid j
of their principles, have lost their hold, and j
the young men of the party —the men to whom
politics mean something more than mere
office-getting- —have come to the front. If
the Democratic leaders have energy and in
telligence, the caucus action of last evening J
means a sweeping Democratic victory next ;
year. For the first time in many years there |
is before the party a fair prospect of such
| popular favor as they have long been seeking |
:by many devious and false roads. At last ;
they are on the right track. The result is a
! severe disappointment to the Republican pnl
! iticians, who exclaim illogically but loudly i
that it gives them the next presidency."
i Philadelphia Press, (Rep.) “The noinina
; tion of Mr. Carlisle has the merit of being a
j plain, bold, unequivocal avowal of the regnant
Democratic spirit and purpose. There is no i
disguise about it. Mr. Carlisle is the ablest
I champion among all the Democratic Repre
i sentatives of the opposition to protection.
He will organize the House against the exist
ing tariff', and lead the attack upon it. flic
resuit simplifies the issue between the two
: parties, and makes a straight, direct fight on
the commanding question of protection.
Chicago Herald [Deni. I “Mr. Carlisle was
distinguished in the last Congress for the vigor
and clearness with which he discussed the
; ordinarily dismal topic of the tariff, ft is his :
| position on this question, and only this posi
tion, which secures him the present leader
ship, and will of neccessity force an issue be- i
tween the parties in 1884 on the line which
Randall sought to avoid. Revenue reform is
to become a living question.
From the Boston Herald (Ind.) The action
of the Democratic congressional caucus in
nominating Mr. Carlisle for Speaker is the |
j most assuring evidence of returning political
1 sense and courage which the Democratic par
jty has given for twenty years. It indicates !
| that the party has convictions and a policy,
\ and is not afraid of one or ashamed of the
other. It means that the controlling element
of the party proposes to abandon the course
pursued for the last deeade of marching in the
rear of the Republican party and to lead the |
way to the front. It justifies the existence of
the’ Democratic party, by placing it in oppo
sition to the Republicans, and committing it
to the work of tax reduction and revenue re
form. (
The Danville Riot.
The Grand Jury of the Hustings Court, of
Danville, Va., charged with the investigation
of the circumstances of the recent riot, have
reported that they have no presentments to
make. They say that the negroes forced the
light, and that the whites used their firearms
in defense of their lives, which were in immi
nent danger, and by their courage and pluck
in standing up against such odds saved the
; lives of handl ed* of people in the city.

President Arthur’s Message.
From the Baltimore Sun.
The President's message, delivered to Con
gress on Tuesday, opens with the usual
ence to the foreign relations of the United
States, which he is able to state are every
where peaceful. Of more immediate interest, !
however, is the recommendation, made by the |
Secretary of the Navy and indorsed by the
President, as an important measure of national
defense in case of war with any foreign power,
that immediate steps be taken for the creation
of an interior coast line of water-ways across
the peninsula of Florida, along the coast from
Florida to Hampton Roads, between the
Chesapeake bay and the Delaware river, and
through Cape Cod, thus recognizing more or
less directly the national character of the pro
jected Chesapeake and Delaware ship-canal.
Commercial treaties have been made with
Servin, Roumania, Corea and Madagascar:
legations have been established in Persia,
Corea and Siam, and it is recommended that
the interests of American citizens resident or
trading in Bulgaria and the Central American
States be cared for by the presence of consu
lar representatives of the 1 nited States,
i Reference is made to the Brazilian export
duty on coffee, and to the penalties for
technical faults applied to American vessels
and cargoes in the Antilles, and the sugges
tion is made that retaliatory measures applied
to Spanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and
Puerto Rico might not be barren of good re
sults. Attention is called to the work of the
International African Association in the Con
go valley, and Congress is reminded that it
may be advisable for us to co-operate with
other commercial powers in promoting the
rights of trade in that region “free from the
interference or political control of any one
nation.” No large reduction of revenues is
advised. Congress is reminded that a tariff
bill has been recently passed, the results of
which are not yet sufficiently apparent to war
rant a further modification of the tariff or in
ternal revenue laws. He states, however,
that the legislation referred to has cut down
the income of the government some fifty or
sixty millions of dollars — a statement at vari
ance with that made by the Secretary of the
Treasury, who puts the net reduction at but
$30,000,000. The surplus of revenue over ex
penditure, which the President estimates at
$60,000,000, it is recommended should be
spent in rehabilitating our navy and providing
coast defenses. The suggestion of the Secre
tary of the Treasury us to the proper method
of perpetuating the national bank system is
approved. It is accordingly recommended
that the tax of 1 per cent, on the circulation
of the national banks be repealed, and that
the amount of the circulation allowed on-bonds
deposited for security be increased to 90 per
! cent, on the market value of such bonds.
, 1 The effect of this would be to make it profita
] ble to the banks to base their circulation on
‘ 4 per cents, which are not redeemable till
, 1907. With respect to the disposition to be
j made of trade dollars the President and Sec
retary of the Treasury, while not favoring ex
j actly the same plan, are in subtantial agree
| ment. The former recommends that the trade
dollar be accepted by the treasury and the
| mints as bullion at a small percentage above
| the current market price of silver of like line-
I ness. The Secretary suggested simply that
I the standard silver dollar be exchanged, dol
| lar for dollar, for the trade dollar, the latter to
be regarded as so much bullion bought under
the act of 1878. Approval is given also the
: Secretary of the Treasury’s plan for the con
solidation of certain customs districts, and it
is added that by the reduction of internal rev
enue districts, recently perfected, their num
ber has been reduced from 120 to 83. Dwel
i ling on the unprotected condition of our extend
\ ed sea-coast, the number of large and wealthy
I cities with which it is dotted, the age and
; weakness of our works of defense, their in
| ferior armament and imperfeettorpedo equip
; ment, the President urges the reconstruction
of our navy and the building of plant for the
manufacture of heavy ordnance, and points to
the overflowing condition of the treasury as a
I fact that renders the present the proper time
; for the inception of so patriotic a work. At
tention is called to the growth of the number
of postoffices from 46,231 in 1882 to 47,863 in
1883. The recommendation is made, adver
sely to the views of the Postmaster-General,
that the rate of postage on drop letters, which
at present is two cents where the carrier sys
| tem is established and one cent elsewhere, be
I made uniform by reducing it everywhere to
I one cent. Reference is made to the long-
I mooted proposition that the government should
assume the same control over the telegraph
j that it has always exercised over the mail,
but the President is unable to accord his ap
proval to the project. The suggestion is
made, however, that the government should be
authorized to exercise some sort of supervis
ion over interstate telegraphic communica
tion. The fees of jurors and witnesses in the
Federal courts, fixed by laws of old date, are
insufficient. It is recommended that they be
increased, and that district attorneys stud ;
marshals be paid by salaries, rather than as
at present, by fees—a change which, it is sug
gested, may diminish the number of prosecu
tions made mcarly for the sake of fees. Con
gress is invited to consider the important ques
tion whether Federal aid may not with pro- |
priety be extended to public primary educa- !
tion in parts of the country where the percen
tage of illiteracy is high. The failure of the j
anti-polygamy legislation of March, 1882, is j
cited, and the strong recommendation is made
that Congress repeal the act upon which the
existing government of Utah depends, assume
control of the Territory, and establish in au
thority a commission with powers fitting it to
deal effectively with the Mormon problem, i
The queston of regulating interstate commerce
is presented for consideration. The right of
railway corporations to reasonable profits is j
conceded, but Congress should protect the
people from injustice. The effects ot the
civil-service act in the short time during which i
it has been in operation are pronounced ben- !
■ eficiat. The act passed by the Senate at its \
last session regulating the presidential succes
sion is recommended to the favorable consid
! eration of the present Congress. It is asked |
i that the Executive he empowered to veto
| particular items of an appropriation without |
I imparing the validity ot other items which
meet his approval. In concluding, the Pres
ident recommends the passage of a new civil
rights bill guaranteeing to the colored citizen
the right secured to him by the fourteenth
amendment.
Exciting Scene in a Court-Room.
A correspondent of the Journal at Prescott, i
| Arizona, gives the following account of a
1 tragedy enacted in a court-room, in which
j Judge French, the Chief Justice of the Terri- i
tory, was presiding at the trial of a case euti-
I tied Kelsey vs. McAtee, regarding a water
! right for irrigating purposes :
“In arguing a question regarding the ad
missibility of certain testimony in the case on
i trial Attorney-General Churchill and District
i Attorney Ruch became greatly excited and
I finally came to blows. While the officers
i were endeavoring to restore order McAtee,
; the defendant, drew a knife, rushed upon a
man named Moore, aged seventy, and inflict
ed a fatal wound. Then, turning on C. W.
i Beach, late editor of the Prescott Miner and
son-in-law of Kelsey, the plaintiff, stabbed (
him in the nock. He then made a rush for
the court reporter and was about to plunge his
knife into him when Mr. Beach drew a re- |
volver, sending a ball through McAtee s spi-
I nal column. •
“Order was immediately restored. Moore j
and McAtee will die. Mr. Beach will re- i
cover.”

Carlisle’s Speech.
Following is Hon. John S. Carlisle's speech
upon taking the chair after his election as
speaker of the House of Representatives on
Monday:
Gentlemen* of the Horse of Represen
tatives : I thank you sincerely for the high
honor conferred upon me by the vote just
taken. To be chosen from the membership
of a great body like this to preside over its
deliberations is a distinction upon which any
citizen might properly congratulate himself,
and I assure you that your kindness and par
tiality are fully appreciated. At the same
time I realize the fact that the position to
which you have assigned me is one of very
great labor and responsibility, and, while pro
foundly grateful to you for this manifestation
of your confidence, I shall enter on the dis
charge of its duties with a serious distrust of
my capacity to meet in an acceptable manner
the requirements of this office.
I promise you, however, to devote to your
service all the zeal and all the ability of which
lam possessed. Gentlemen, the maintenance
of order on the floor is essential—absolutely
i essential —to the intelligent systematic trans
action of public business, and I earnestly in
voke your assistance in the enforcement of the
rules adopted for the government of our pro
ceedings. The large addition to the mem
bership of this House, resulting from the late
apportionment of Representatives, makes this
duty even more difficult than it has been be
fore, and without your cordial co-operation
and support I cannot reasonably hope evenly
to discharge the ordinary daily duties of this
office. That you will cheerfully co-operate j
with me in every proper effort to preserve I
order and to facilitate the business of legisla
tion, I have no doubt.
I Sudden and radical changes in the laws and
regulations affecting the commercial and in
dustrial interests of the people ought never be
made, unless imperatively demanded by some
public emergency ; and, in my opinion, under
existing circumstances, such changes would
not be favorably received by any considerable
! number of those who have given serious at
tention to the subject. [Applause.] Many re
forms are undoubtedly necessary, and it will
be your duty, after a careful examination of :
the whole subject in all its bearings, to decide |
j how far they should extend, and when and in
• what manner they should be made. [Ap
| plause.] If there be any who fear that your
action on this, or any other subject, will ac
tually be injurious to any interests or even
afford reasonable cause for alarm, I am quite
j sure that they will be agreeably disappointed.
[Applause. ]
What the country has a right to expect is
strict economy in the administration of every j
department of the Government; just and
j equal taxation for public purposes ; a faithful
I observance of the limitations of the Constitu- j
tion, and a scrupulous regard for the rights ]
i and interests of the great body of the people, j
! in order that power to protect them against
| encroachment from every direction. What- j
! ever can be done, under the circumstances j
surrounding us, to meet this expectation, ought
to be done, in my judgment. [Applause.]
But, gentlemen, without detaining you fur
; ther, I am ready to take the oath of office pre- j
scribed by the Constitution and the Laws and
proceed to the complete organization of the
House.

Reasons and Results.
From the Washington Post.
A system of taxation so fatally vicious that
it takes from the earnings of the people annu
ally a hundaed millions more than are ,
required for all legitimate public uses, —
A foreign commerce almost entirely surren
dered to foreign ship-owners,—
A navy on which half a billion lias been ex
! pended since the war. but which is officially
j confessed to be utterly* worthless as to ships
I aud guns,—
An army so hopelessly demoralized that it
is dissolved by desertion as fast as it can be
built by recruiting, —
The Mormon problem in worse shape than
it was when the Republican party declared
war on polygamy twenty-seven years ago;—
These are some of the results of a quarter
of a century of Republican rule. These are a
few of the reasons why the country demands i
a change. Let the Democratic House set the
ball in motion.
An Influential Democratic Journal.
From the Upper Marlboro' Prince Georgian.
The Democratic Advocate, published at i
Westminster by the Vanderford Brothers, a ;
few days ago entered upon its 19th volume, j
This paper is one of our most welcome ex- 1
changes, for apart from its intrinsic merits,
our personal recollections of its senior editor,
who once resided here, are of the most pleas
ant nature. The Advocate is an influential
Democratic journal, and bears every evidence
of increasing prosperity.
