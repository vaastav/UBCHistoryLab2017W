- WATERTOWN. WIS., DECEMBER 16. 1885.
The Grand Army of the Republic has
selected Washington as the site of the
proposed Grand Army monument to
General Grant.
REPUBLICAN pest masters who still have
their heads on their shoulders are now
safe until the adjournment of the senate,
unless their terms should expire before
that time.
A Democratic paper says that by the
change in the Navy department, “the
long line of Bories, Thompsons, Robesons
and Chandlers has come to an end.”
That is true, but the worst of it is that a
line of Whitneys has begun.
Ira Davenport, the defeated Repub
lican candidate for governor of New York,
was not left out in I lie cold. He is a
member of the house o! representatives
in congress, and ma lea lucky draw of a
seat among Ir.s political friends.
During the last four years under Re
publican rule the principal of the public
debt has been paid at the rate of $74,-
000,000 per year. The president in his
message informs us that during the last
five month? “there has been paid on the
public debt $369,823." It needs no
comment. He might, however, have
added that during a single month the
public debt increased neaiiv
At the meeting of the slate grange,
held at Madison last week, the following
officer.? were elected and installed far the
ensuing year:
Master —S. C. Carr. Milton:
Overseer—E. J. Williams, Danville:
Lecturer— John F. Eervin, Trempealeau;

Executive committee—John Whittet, Bussey

General Logan’s purpose to oppose
the confirmation of officials appointed in
place of veteran* who have been removed
without cause is to be commended. If
what he has to say on this subject should
be said in open session so much the bet
ter. The country docs not desire any
factious opposition on the part of the
senate to the president’s nominations, but
it does expect that body to uphold civil
service reform principles and to piotest
against the violation of the spirit or the
letter of the statute which declares that
Union veterans shall be preferred in the
civil service.— New York Tribune,
The Republican Leader of the
House. —Washington Correspondence
Cleveland Leader: I saw Tom Reed to
day. What an immense man he is! He
is nearly six feet high, and his frame must
weigh considerably over 200 pounds.
He will be the leading Republican speak
er during the next session, and he is
pointed out as the Republican leader.
There is no man in congress, or, indeed,
in public life, unless it be Senator In
galls, of Kansas, who has so keen a wit
as Tom Reed. There is not one except
Ingalls who approaches him in bitter
sarcasm and cruel thrusts at an adver
sary. He has a most tantalizing manner
when he gets into a quarrel on the floor
of the house, and he does not care if he
wounds his enemies so deeply that they
carry the scars to their graves.
“When my horses were sick with what
was called luntr fever, last spring, I gave
them Simmons Liver Regulator (liquid) in
one ounce doses twice a day. They all
recovered speedily. E. T. Michener,

Pa.
To the demaud made that the senate
should elect a Democrat as its presiding
officer on the ground that at the last
election the people “declared in favor of
a Democrat,” the Utica Herald says:
“The people declared in favor of nobody
in November, 1884. At that election
10,048,151 vote were cast, of which the
Cleveland and Hendricks electors receiv
ed 4,913,853; the Blaine and Logan
electors 4,847,655. The Prohibition and
Butler tickets got 286,647 votes. Cleve
land and Headricks, therefore, lacked
lacked 220,445 votes of being the popular
choice. By the machinery of law a
plurality elects, and by legal methods,
despite the populai will rather than by
it, Mr. Cleveland became president and
Mr. Hendricks vice-president.” Further:
“What right has the administration to ap
peal for courtesy to Republicans? Mr.
Cleveland's title rests upon the votes of
states where the right of suffrage was
trampled upon, and partisan organization
set up a despotism which nullified the
will of thousands of citizens. It rests
besides upon the electoral votes of New
York, where the majority Was not beyond
question, and where at least in the chief
city the partisan bosses extorted results
which the people did not desire.”
The habitual use of pills is a sure
means of untimely undermining health
and laying the foundation for some of
the most distressing cases of chronic
maladies. Use Dr. Jones’ Red Clover
Tonic, a purely vegetable remedy which
tones and regulates the system, enriching
the blood. It cures all diseases ot the
stomach, liver, blood and kidneys. Cau

Literary experts in Washington claim
to have discovered that Secretary Bayard
wrote the first half of the president’s
message—all of that relating to foreign
affairs; while Miss Elizabeth Rose Cleve.
land, the president’s sister, dished up the
Mormons, and in many other places in
the document introduced her peculiarly
involved literary style. From the com
plicated verbosity of the paper it seems
not unlikely that Postmaster General
Vilas revised and padded it before it was
sent to the press.
—Postmaster General Vilas has made
an order fixing the fees on international
money orders on and after the first of
next January, as follows: For sums not
exceeding $lO, 10 cents; oyer $lO and
not exceeding S2O, 20 cents; over S2O and
not exceeding S3O, 30 cents; over S3O
and net exceeding S4O, 40 cents; over S4O
and not exceeding SSO, 50 cents. This
is a reduction of one-third of the present
rates paid by remitters for such orders.
—Two farmers were not long since
discussing their local paper. One said
he thought it had too many advertise
meats in it. The other responded, “in
my opinion llie advertisements are far
from being the least valuable part of it.
I look them over carefully every week
and I save at least five times (he cost of
mv paper each year through the business
advantages which I get from them.”
Said the other, “1 believe you are right—
J know that they pay me well and I
rather think it is not in very good taste
to find fault with the advertisements af
ter all.” Those men have the right idea
of the maDer. It pays any man who
has a family to support, to take his lo
cal paper for the sake of the advertise,
ments if nothing more.— T Vhitexcater
