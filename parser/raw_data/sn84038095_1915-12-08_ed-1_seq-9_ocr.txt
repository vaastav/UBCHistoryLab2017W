is the message of
President Wilson delivered at a
Joint session of the senate and
boose at the beginning of the
Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of .the Congress—Since I
.lust bad the privilege of addressing
you on the state of the Union the war
of nations on the other side of the sea,
which bad then only begun to disclose
its portentous proportions, has extend
ed its threatening and sinister scope
until it has swept within Its flame
6ome portion of every quarter of the
globe, not excepting our own hemi
sphere, has altered the whole face of
international affairs, and now presents
a prospect of reorganization and re
construction such as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
The president tells how this country
practiced neutrality and declares that
he hopes that when the time comes
for readjustment and recuperation this
country will be of infinite service. Re
ferring to Central and South American
problems, the president declares that
we should retain unabated tbe spirit
which has tnsplred us throughout the
whole life of our government and
which was so frankly put Into words
by President Monroe.
We have been pot to tbe test in the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test Whether we have benefited Mex
ico by the course have pursued re
mains to be seen. Herfortunesare In
her own hands. Bat we have at least
provtfd tbat we will not tike advan
tage of her In her distress and under
take to ivpoae iipon Mr an Mar and
government tf our own choosing. lib
erty Is oftta a fierce and Intractable
thing, to which no bounds can be set
nnd to which no bounds of a few
men's choosing ought ever to be set
divery American who has drunk at
the true fountains of principle andtra
dltion must subscribe without reserva
tion to tbe high doctrine of the Vir
ginia bill of rights, which In tbe great
days In which our government was aet
up was everywhere among us accept
ed as the creed of free men. That doc
trine is, "That government Is or ought
to be instituted for the common bene
fit. protection and security of the peo
ple, nation or community that "of
nil the various modes and forms of
government, that is the best which is
capable of producing tbe greatest de
gree of happiness and safety and Is
most effectually secured against the
danger of maladministration, and that
when any government shall be found
Inadequate or contrary to these pur
poses a majority of the coinmuuity
linth on Indubitable, inalienable and
Ittftefcasible right to reform, alter or
ajollsh it ill such manner as shall be
Judged most conducive to tbe public
weal." We hare unhesitatingly op
plied that heroic principle to the case
of Mexico nnd now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic,
which had so much of which to purge
Hself and so little sympathy from any
outside quarter in the- radical but uec
essary process. We will aid and be
friend Mexico, but we will not coerce
her, and our course with regard to her
ought to bo sufficient proof to all Amer
ica tbat we seek no political suzerainty
or selfish control.
PAN-AMERICANISM I^AS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
Economlo Adjustments Inevitable With
in the Next Generation.
The moral Is that tbe states of Amer
ica n're not hostile rivals, but co-op
erating friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of intrt*est
alike In matters political and in mat
ters economic. Is likely to give them a
new significance as factors in Interna
tional affairs and In the political his
tory of the world. It presents them as
in a very deep and true sense a unit
in world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to
gether, quick with common sympathies
nnd common ideals. Separated, they
are subject to all tbe cross currents of
tbe confused politics of a world of hos
tile rivalries united in spirit and pur
pose. they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This Is pan-Americanism. It has none
or tbe spirit of empire in it It is tbe
embodiment, tbe effectual embodiment
of tbe spirit of law and'independence
and liberty and mutual service.
The president calls attention to the
meeting. In Washington recently, of

•VvA.'J
{President "Wilson £elivers
representatives, of the pan-American
republics and says that economic ad
justment Is Inevitable In tbe next gen
eration.
No one who really comprehends tbe
spirit of the great people for whom we
are appointed to speak can fall to per
ceive tbat their passion Is for peace,
their genius best displayed In the prac
tice of the arts of peace^jQreat democ
racies are not belligerent They do not
seek or desire wnr. Their thought Is
of Individual liberty and of tbe free
labor that supports life and tbe un
censored thought that quickens It
Conquest and dominion are not in our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
ples. But just because we demand un
molested development and the undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter It may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We Insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development.
We do more than that We demand It
also for others. We do not confine oar
enthusiasm for individual liberty and
free national development to l!he Inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wher
ever there Is a people that tries to walk
In these difficult paths of independence
and right From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and have
deemed It as important that our neigh
bors should be free from all outside
domination as tbat we ourselves should
be have set Anjerlca aside as a whole
for tbe uses of Independent nations snd
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple against aggression. And we are
as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within bur own nation
as of aggression from without We
will not maintain a standing ann« ex
cept for uses which are as necessary.
in times of peace an In times of war.
SUGGESTS BROAD PUN
If FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Increase Blinding Regular Feree—Pewr
Hundred Thousand CHIsen Setdlere.
But war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It Is a thing
of disciplined might If our citizens
are ever to fight effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
bow modern fighting is done, and what
to do when tbe summons comes to
render themselves immediately avail
able and Immediately effective. And
tbe government must be their aervant
in this mstter, must supply them with
tbe training they need to take care of
themselves and of it The military
arm of their government, which they
will not allow to direct them, tbey may
properly use to serve them and make
their Independence secure, and not
their own Independence merely, but
the rights also of .those with whom
tbey have made common cause, should
they also be put In jeopardy. They
must be fitted to play the great role
in the world, and particularly in this
hemisphere, for which they are quail
.fled by principle and by chastened am
bition 4o play.
It is with these Ideals In mind that
tbe plans of the department of war for
more adequate national defense were
t'on^elved which will be laid before
on. and which I urge you to sanction
and put Into effect as soon as they can
be properly scrutinized and .discussed.
They seem to me the essential first
steps, and tbey seem to me for tbe
present sufficient
Tbey contemplate an Increase of tbe
standing force of tbe regular army
from its present strength of 5,023 offi
cers and 102,985 enlisted men of all
services to a strength of 7,130 officers
and 134 707 enlisted men, or 141,843
all told, all services, rank and file, by
tbe addition of fifty-two companies of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers. ten regiments of infantry, fonr
regiments of field artillery and ftur
aero squadrons, besides 7TO officers re
quired' for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all Important
duty of training the citizen force of
which I shall presently speak. 792 non
commissioned officers for service In
drill, recrnltfcig and the like and tbe
necessary quota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps, the hospital
corps, the ordnance department and
other similar auxiliary services. These
are the additions necessary to render
the army adequate for its present du
ties, duties which It has to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders nnd at our interior
army posts, but also in the Philippines,
in the Hawaiian islands, at the isth
mus and In Porto IUco.-
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of Its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale
should occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi
zens, raised In Increments of 133,000 a
year throughout a period of three
years. This It is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment "under which the
serviceable men of the country would
be asked to bind themselves to serve
with the colors for purposes of train
ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to the colors at call
at any time throughout an additional
"furlough" period of three years. This
force of 400.000 men would be pro
vided with personal accoutcrments as
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for the field made ready to b» supplied
at any time. Tbey would be assem
bled for training at stated intervals at
convenient places in association with
suitable units of the regular army.
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months in
the year.
The president says is up to the
patriotic young men of the country to
respond to this call.
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
FOR GREATER NAVY.
Always Looked to It as Our First and
Chief Line of Defense.
The program which will be laid be
fore you by the secretary of the navy
Is similarly conceived. It involves only
a shortening of tbe time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out, but It does make definite and ex
plicit a program which has. heretofore
been only Implicit, held In the minds of
tbe committees on naval affairs and
disclosed in the debates of the two
houses, but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seeuis to me very
clear tbat It will be to the. advantage
of tbe country for tbe congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency and to press that plan
to completion within the next five
years. We have always-looked to the
navy of tbe country as our first and
chief line ot defense we have always
seen it to be our manifest course of
prudence to be strong oh the seas,
fear by year we' have been creating a
navy which now ranks very high in
deed among the navies of the maritime:
nations. We should now definitely de
.termipe how we shall complete what
we have begun and b6w soon.
Tbe program to be laid before yon
contemplates the construction within
five years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de
stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two atnmanl
tlon ships, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It Is proposed tbat of this
nupiber we shall tbe first year provide
for the construction of two battlesbips,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
twenty-five coast submarines, two gun
boats and one hospital ship tbe second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser,
ten destroyers, four fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat
and one fuel oil ship tbe third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout dralsers. five destroyers, two fleet,
submarines and fifteen coast subma
rines the fourth year two battleships,
two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni
tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and
the fifth year two baittleshlps, one bat
tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de
stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, oue gunboat, one am
munition ship and one repair ship.
The secretary of tbe navy Is asking
also for tbe Immediate addition to tbe
personnel of the navy of 7.500 sailors.
2,500 apprentice seamen and 1,500 ma
rines. This Increase would be suffi
cient to care for tbe ships which are
to be completed within tbe fiscal year
1917 and also for the number of men
which must be put in training to man
tbe ships which will be completed
early In 191S. It Is also necessary tbnt
the number of midshipmen at the Na
val academy at Annapolis should be
Increased by, at least 300 In order that
the force of officers should be more
rapidly added to, and authority Is ask
ed to appoint, for engineering duties
only, approved graduates of engineer
ing colleges, and for service in tbe avi
ation corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
this full program should be carried
out we should have built or building In
1921, "according to the estimates of sur
vival and standards of classification
followed by tbe general board of tbe
department, an effective navy consist
ing of 27 battleships of the first line, 0
Rattle cruisers, 25 battleships of the
second line, 10 armored cruisers, 13
scout cruisers, 5 first class cruisers, 3
second class cruisers, 10 third class
cruisers, 108 destroyevs, 18 fleet sub
marines, 157 coast submarines, mon
itors, 20 gunboats, 4 supply ships, 15
fuel ships, 4 transports, 3 tenders to
torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special
types and two ammunition ships. This
would be a navy fitted to our needs
and worthy of our. traditions.
But armies and instruments of ..war
are only part of what has to be con
fldered If we are to consider tbe su
preme matter of national self sufficien
cy and security In all its aspects.

PRESIDENT WILSON'S LATEST
PASTURE.
(From snapshot taken on Nov. 26.)
'there' ore other" great matters "which
will be thrust upon our attention
whether we will oitnot. There is, for
example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping involved in tills
great problem of Rational adequacy.
It Is necessary, for in any weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that we should have a great
merchant marine. The great merchant
fleet we once used to make us rich,
that great body of sturdy sailors who
used to carry our ling into every sea.
and who were tbe pride and often the
bulwark of ^e.n^^^^v^^mjsl
driven out of existence): by Inexcusable?
neglect and indifference and bya hope
lessly blind: and provincial policy of
so called economic protection, it* Is
high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our. commercial Independence
on the seas.
With a' view to meeting these press
ing necessities of our commerce and
availing ourselves at tbe earliest possi
ble moment of'the present unparalleled
opportunity ot linking tbe two Ameri
cas together In bonds of mutual inter
est and service, an opportunity which
may never return again if we miss It
now, proposals will be made to the
present congress for tbe purchase or
construction of ships ^to be owned and
directed by tbe government similar to
those made to tbe last congress, but
modified in some essential particulars.
I recommend these proposals to you
for your prompt acceptance with tbe
more confidence because every month
that has elapsed since the former pro
posals were made has made the ne
cessity for such action more and more
manifestly imperative. Tbat need was
then foreseen. It is now acutely felt
and. everywhere realized by those for
whom trade Is waiting, but who. can
find no conveyance for their goods. 1
am not so much Interested in the par
ticulars of the program as I am In
taking immediate advantage of the
great opportunity which, awaits us If
we will but net in this emergency. In
this matter, as In all others, a spirit of
common counsel should prevail, and
out of It should come an early solu
tion of this pressing problem.
SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY
IN THE PHILIPPINES.
Recommend* Early Adoption of Meas
ure* Giving Tham Fuller Justice.
The president recommends tbe early
adoption of bills l'optbe alteration and
reform of tbe government' of tbe Phil
ippines and for rendering fuller polit
ical justice to the people of Porto Rico,
which were submitted to the Sixty
third congress. The president refers
to the increased cost of carrying out
the plans for the armed forces of the
nation and tells of the fiscal problems
confronting the government.
On the 30th of June last tbere was
an
1
available balance in the general
fund of the treasury of $104,170,105.78.
The total estimated receipts fop the
year 1910, on the assumption that the
emergency revenue measure passed by
the last congress will not be extended
beyond its present limit the 31st of
December. 1915, and that tbe present
duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will
be discontinued after the 1st of May,
1910. will be .?t ~0,o(55,500. The balance
of June last and these estimated rev
enues come therefore to a grand total
of $774,535,003.78. The total estimated
disbursements for the present fiscal
year, including twenty-five millions for
the Panama canal, twelve millions for
probable deficiency appropriations and
$50,000 for miscellaneous debt redemiv
tlons, will be $753,891.000, nnd the bal­
The additional revenues required to
carry out the program of military and
naval preparation of which ft have
spoken would.,as at present estimated,
be for the fiscal year 1917 $93,800,000.
Those figures, taken with the figures
for. tbe present fiscal year wblcb 1
have already given, disclose our flnan
eial problem for the year 1917. As
suming that the taxes imposed by the
emergency revenue act and tbe pres
ent duty on sugar are to be discontln- I
ued and that the balance at tbe close
of the present fiscal year will be only
$20,044,005.78. that tbe disbursements
for the Panama canal will again be
about $25,000,000 and tbat tbe addi
tional expenditures for the army and
navy are authorized by the congress,
the deficit In the general fund of tbe
treasury on the 30th of June. 1917.
will be nearly $235,000,000. To this
sum at least $50,000,000 should be add
ed to represent a safe working bnlance
for the treasury and $12,000,000 to in
clude the usual deficiency estimates in
1917. nnd these additions would make
a total deficit of some $297,000,000. If
tbe present taxes should* be continued
throughout this year and thf» next
however, there would be a balance in
tbe treasury of some $70,500,000 at
tbe end of the present fiscal year and
a deficit at tbe end of the next year of
only some $50,000,000, or, reckoning In
$62,000,000 for deficiency appropria
tions and a safe treasury balance at
tbe end of the year, a total deficit of
some $112,000,000. The obvious moral
.of the figure* Is thajjt Is a phrin cgun
set of prudence to continue all or the
present taxes or their equivalents and
confine ourselves to the problem of
providing $112,000,000 of new revenue
rather than $297,000,000.
How shall we obtain the new rev
enue?* We are frequently -reminded
that there-a^e many millions of bonds
which the treasury is autbqrlzed under
existing law to sell to Reimburse the
sums paid out of current revenues for
the construction of the Panama canal,
and it is true ..that bonds for tbe
amount of $222,432,000 are now avail-j
able for that purpose. Prior to 1913
$138,000,000 of these bonds had ac
tually been sold to recoup the expendi
tures at tbe isthmus, and now con
stitute a considerable item of tbe pub
lic debt. But I for one do not believe
that the people of this country approve
of postponing the payment of their
bills. Borrowing money Is shortsigbt
ed finance. It can be justified only
when permanent things are to be ac
complished which many generations
will certainly benefit by an$ which It
seems hardly fair that a single genera
tion-should pay for The objects we
are now proposing to spend money for
cannot be so classified, except in the
sense that everything wisely done may
be said to be done in the Interest of
posterity as well' as in our own. It,
seems to me a clear dictate of pru-!
dent statesmanship and frank finance
that in what we are now, I hope, about
•to undertake we should pay as we go.
The people of the country are entitled
to knew just what burdens of taxation
they are to carry and to know from the
outset, now. The new bills should be
paid by internal taxation.
NATION'S SECRET FOES
SHOULD BE CRUSHED.
Graveit Danger to Country Comas
From Within Ou» Own Bordors.
Tbe president says that the precise
reckonings ot the problem to be met
are set forth in the report of the secre
tary of the treasury.
I have spoken to you today, gentle
men, upon a single theme, the thor
ough preparation of tbe nation to care
for its own security and to make sure
of entire freedom to play the impar
tial role in this hemisphere and in tbe
world which we all believe to have
been providentially assigned to It I
have had in my mind no thought of
any immediate or particular dauger
arislug out of our relations with other
nations, ffs are nt peaco with all the
nations of the world, and there is rea
son to hope that no question in con
troversy between this and other gov
ernments will lead to any serious
breach of amicable relations, grave as
some differences of uttitude and policy
have been and may yet turn out to be.
I am sorry to say that the gravest
threats against our nati6nal peace and
safety hnve been uttered within our
own borders. There are citizens of the
United States, I blush to admit, born
under other flags, but welcomed under

ourgenerons'naturalization "laws to the
full freedom and opportunity of Amer
ica. who have poured tbe poison of dis
loyalty into the very arteries of our
national life, who have sought to briug
the authority and good name of our
government into contempt, to destroy
our industries wherever they thought
it effective for their vindictive pur
poses to strike at them and to debase
our politics to the uses of foreign in
trigue. Their number is not great as
compared with the whole number of
those sturdy hosts by which our na
tion has been enriched in recent gen
erations out of virile foreign stocks,
but it is great enough to have brought
deep disgrace upon us and to have
made it necessary that we should
promptly make use of processes of law
by which we may be purged of their
corrupt distempers.
America never witnessed- anything
like this before. It never dreamed It
possible tbat men sworn Into Its own
citizenship, men drawn out of great
free stocks such as'supplied some of
the best and strongest elements of that
little, but bow heroic, nation that in a
high day of old staked its very life to
free itself from every entanglement
tbat had darkened the fortunes of tbe
older nations and set up a new stand
ard here—that men of such origins and
such free choices of allegiance would
ever turn In malign reaction against
the government and people who had'
welcomed and nurtured them and seek
to make this proud country once more
a hotbed of European passion. A lit
tle while ago such a thing would have
seemed Incredible. Because it was in
credible we made no preparation for
it We would have been almost
ashamed to prepare for it, as if we
were suspicious of ourselves, our awn
comrades and neighbors! But the ugly
and incredible thing has actually come
about, and we are without adequate
federal laws to deal with it I urge
you to enact such laws at tbe earliest
possible moment and feel tbat In doing
so 1 am urging you to do nothing less
than save the honor and self respect
of the nation. Such creatures of pas
sion. dlslojaltjr and anarchy must be
crashed out Tbey are not many, but
they are infinitely malignant and the
hand* of our power should close. over
them at once. They bnve:formed plots

to pry into every conildeutiul inms-.
action of the government in order to
serve interests alien to our own. It is
possible to deal with these things very
effectually. I need not suggest the
terms In which they may be dealt with.
I wish that It could be suid Unit only
a few men, misled by mistaken senti
ments of allegiance to the governments
under which they were born, hail been
guilty of disturbing the self possession
and misrepresenting the temper and
principles of the country during tnese
days of terrible war. when ,it would
seem that every man who was truly :ui
American would instinctively runke it
his duty and his pride to keep the
scales of judgment even and prove him
self a partisan of no nation but Ins
own. But it cannot There are some
men atnong us and many sesident
abroad frbo, though born and tired in
the Uulted States and calling them
selves Americans, have so forgotten
themselves and their honor as citizens
as to put their passionate sympathy
with oue or the other side In tbe great
European conflict above their regard
for tbe peace and dignity of tbe United
States. They also preach and practice
disloyalty. No laws, 1 suppose, can
reach corruptions of the mind and
heart, but I should not speak of others
without also speaking of these and ex
pressing the even deeper humiliation
and scorn which every self possessed
nnd thoughtfully patriotic American
must feel when he thinks of them und
of the discredit they are daily bringtug
upon us.
What Is more importaut Is that the
Industries and resources of tbe country
should be available and ready for
mobilization.- It is the more impera
tively necessary, therefore, that we
should promptly devise means for do
ing what we have not yet done—that
we should give intelligent federal aid
and stimulation to industrial und voca
tional education, as we have long done
in tbe large field of our agricultural
Industry that at the same time that
we safeguard and conserve the natural
resources of the country" we should
put them at tbe disposal of those who
will use them promptly and intelli
gently. as was sought to be done in
tbe admirable bills submitted to the
last congress from lt& committees on
the public lands, bills which 1 earnest
ly recommend In principle to your con
sideration that we should put into
early operation some provision for
rural credits which will add to tbe ex
tensive borrowing facilities already
afforded tbe farmer by tbe reserve
bank act adequate Instrumentalities
by which long credits may be obtained
on land mortgages and tbat we should
study more carefully than they have

Many conditions nbout which ivo

I altered from decade to decade, it Is
evident under our very eyes nnd are
likely to change even more rapidly

REGULATIONS TO MEET
RAILROAD PROBLEM.
Needed to Make Linn More Useful,
Servant* of Country.
In the meantime may mane this
suggestion? The transportation prob
lem is an exceedingly serious and
pressing one in this country. Theie
has from time to time of late been rea
son to rear thi|t our railroads would
not much longer he able to cope ^vitlv
it successfuayTasTt present equipped
and co-ordinated. I suggest tbat It
would be wise to provide for a com
mission or Inquiry to ascertain by a
thorough canvass of tbe whole ques
tion whether our laws as at present
framed and administered are as serv
iceable as tbey might be in tbe solu
tion of the problem. It is obviously
a problem tbat lies at tbe very foun
dation of our efficiency as a people.
Such an Inquiry ought to draw out
every circumstance and opinion worth
considering, and we need to know
•II sides of tbe matter if we mean to
do anything in the fleld of federal leg
islation.
No one, I am sure, would wish to
take any backward step. The regula
tion of the railways of the country by
