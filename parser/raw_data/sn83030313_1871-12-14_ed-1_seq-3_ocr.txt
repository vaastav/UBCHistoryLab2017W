Washington, Dec. 12,1871.
llamlac Complication with Spain In Conic,
goeace of Cuban Affair*, and Thrlr Recent
Action Relative to the Geneva Conference*"*
Oatapolcen Threats of War.
I* is now generally understood In the highest
legal circles that the Geneva Conference will bo a
failure, and that the administration was completely
outwitted on that part of the Treaty of Washington
Which provides for the appointment of arbitrators.
With the exception of Mr. Adams and, perhaps, Mr.
Btaemfle, all the men who compose the Board 01 Arbi
tration are opposed to repablloan institutions. Two
out of the fiveJielong to the fallen and degenerate
lAttn race, and it is not believed possible that they
.. c*n be Induced to make a fair and honorable award.
For some time it has been whlspored about that
flpaln was interesting herself In the results of the
Conference, and that Great Britain would use the
escape of the Hornet, Florida, Virginia, Upton and
Lillian from American ports, to assist the insurrec
tionary Cubans, as an argument against allowing
any damages whatever for the depredations of the
Alabama; but it was not till within a day or two
that the matter assumed such form that the situa
tion became Intelligible. In another day one of the
meat astounding pieces of intelligence which has |
jet been made public in regard to the Washington
Treaty, and the often reported and as often denied
complications with Spam, will have been scat
tered broadcast over the country; for it
Is the Intention to ventilate the whole subjoct
In me House of Representatives when the
resolution for making the appropriation for
the Geneva Conference comes up in Committee of
the Whole, to which it was yesterday referred.
General Banks, acting in the Cuban interest,
p M well ae doing his dnty as an American Repre
sentative, is pressing Immediate action, and Mr.
Cox, of New York, will tare the leadership or the
other side of the House, but in reality on the same
^ Mae of the question.
The attack will be the fiercest one yet mado upon
the administration, and the result cannot fail to bo
? complete overthrow of President Grant. For two
or three days the terror at tho White House has
been frightful, and the earnest friends of the Presi
dent are wild In their demonstrations of anger and
resentment at the republican Senators who wero
Instrumental In Keeping Secretary Fish In
the Cabinet. Seeing the danger of lus own
dereat looming up In the blackest colors,
lbs President is anxious to cover the
retreat on the Alabama question by a change of
policy with regard to Cuba and a declaration of war
?gainst Spain. Tnls Is tho meaning or the alarm in
Madrid and tne secret of the despatching of a
?pedal messenger to the Spanish Minister at Wash
button. It also accounts for the extensive military
and naval preparations in Spain, and the recent
V action of Count Valmaseda In garrisoning the rorts
at Havana with regular soldiers, Instead of the un
bridled voiunteors. But perhaps the mo9t remark
able feature of the whole ooae is the anxiety of the
administration to get rid of Fieb. fle is the man
who did most of the dining with the Joint High
Commissioners, and he la to be Grant's morsel to
whale off the publio ftary. a Fish to the
Whale will certainly be very good, and the
way Babcock and the other chaps who stand round
fee Presidential chair are working to cast him out
la refreshing, and senator Wilson comes in for a
great Share of the abuse. Tba good-natured old
fellow has been trying to sit on "both sides of the
fence"?to keop In with Grant and yet obey the
behests of Uumner. But for onoe ho not only nut
His foot into the pie, but a very big foot at that.
The administration la more embarrassed by Fish's
remaining in the Cabinet even than by the terrible
state of affairs at Geneve. He is the man of brains
and oulture In what the President calls his staff, but
tae big dinners V d his fluctuating policy in regard
ho Cuba have ruined him. a more unfortunate man
oannot be found. He maddened the friends of Cuban
Independence by refusing to countenance tbe lnsnr
^ notion In Cuba, and at tbe same time made Spain
torn against htm through insafflciont vigilance In
guarding against secret expeditions. He extorted
the admiration of his countrymen by the wonderful
diplomacy displayed in the Treaty of Washington,
^ tat left the fruit to turn to ashes in bis mouth by
giving tbe enemies of his country an opportunity to
Aeotde against him on arguments furnished by his
own administration of tbe Department 0/ State,
tatjho conduct or ihe administration is most un
fair. Everybody who knows anything about the
Wttte House la aware that the cabinet officers are
m?wv puppets,in Grant's hands, and the sphinx
tatting in the Cabinet coun
, ells. Mr. Win was long tha flgure
-? head clothe proWof Grant's Mp of stats; but now
M Is a mermaid, coming up out of the sea to
frighten the sailors just before tbe storm, it is no
;>onder, tbeu, that Babcock is unusually busy, that
? Horses Porter looks jaotn wise s&d fierce, and that
General Dent assumes again his martial aspect.
We are to have war with bpatn, to wrest the ah
Miles from tha grasp or thr Spaniard and to make
MM American people pay in ofoqd and treasure for
the blander* at imbecility. This is the way the
ease stands. In all the negotiations for the Treaty
of Wellington it was Impossible to extort an ad. j
mlsBslon, mnch less a confession, that Great Britain
bad violated the law or nations or done
any wrongful act In allowing the Ala
bama and the other pirates to escape.
A mil a and water regret, weaker In every i
way than " Bout well's brandy." was all that could ,
be obtained. The regret in no way interferes with
the English case belore tho arbitrators, while the
British connsel meet the American argument with |
the reply that "oar complaints against Great j
Britain are Identical witn our practice against j
Spain." Anticipating this answer to the specifics '
Hons and deductions of the American counsel, I
Francis Clare Ford, long connected with the British |
Legation here, spent months la preparing a detailed
account of all our expeditions against Cuba, to
gether with a view of the American practice In 1
similar emergencies from the establishment of the !
republic down to the present hour. He began his I
work long before the treaty was signed, and had It 1
well on toward completion when the treaty was i
ratified. Before the arbitrators at Geneva the ques- i
tion will be, "Did England in her municipal capa
city do everything in her power to prevent
the Utring oat and departure of the piratical ships
of war f" To answer the question by citing volumes
of similar Instances In the practice of the United !
States will not be such an answer as will satisfy
tho enlightened conscience of the civilized world, ;
bat what the effect will be npon the minds of Lord .
Chief Justice Cockburn and his Brazilian and
Italian associates Is another matter. The Ainerl- ;
can connsel will reply by citing the constant Eng- i
lish practice as set off by our own. If it is alleged I
that wc fit ted out privateers against Spain when
she was at war with her South American posses
slons, we will show that by the Treaty of 1810 we
shonldered tho entire responsibility and paid for
our acts. If It is argued that wo permitted j
the Cuban Junta in New York to levy war against
Spain irom our shores, we will reply j
that England allowed a society or PoleB
In London to project expeditions against
Russia, and not only by the voice of her
most eminent statesmen defended ilie acts of the
l'ollsh refugees In Parliament, but when the govern
ment of the Czar complained, officially informed
the Russian Bear that it was nobody's business.
Wo will go farther, and show that in the great plot
to assassinate Napoleon III. the scheme was devised
In London, and even the hand grenades which
were to take the Emperor's life were earned from
England into Franco. AH this, however, is regarded
here as very little to tho purpose, each side, Uko dis
putants on points of theological doctrine, finding
plenty of texts to support extraneous propositions
founded solely on tno principle of crying, "You're
another."
Bat tbe position and attitude of Spain are more
difficult to understand. It is said here that the
Spanish government has taken the deepest luterost
m furthering the English view of tho case and in
supporting the English arguments before the Con
ference at Geneva. If the Conterence decides in our
lavor on tbe main question, ruling that England
did not ubo sufficient vigilance m preventing the
violating of her own laws to our detriment, it Is ad
mitted that we shall be compelled to settle with
Spain in the case of the Hornet aud other vessels
which did Injury to Cuba. At the same time It Is
evident that Spain Is alarmed, as if anticipating the
decision of tho Conforenoe. she is arming both on
land and sea. There is no longer an Insurrection
In Cuba requiring her to send out to the Ever Faith,
ful isle a slngie general, much less 10,000 soldiers,
or to doprlve the Havana volunteers of the martial
glory of defending the Cabanas and the Morro Cas ?
tie. A single word in the rresiaent's Message?
??intervention"?puts all Madrid In commotion, and
induces the young King to call his old counsellors
together. An attache is at once despatched to
the Spanish Minister at Washington, and
there are dark hints here that tho fate of
Catacazy Is yet In storo for Roberts. Secretary
Roocson gets upon Ills sea logs and goes stalking
around among the sailors of Washington, talking
of his three Bhlps-of-war, with the bad boilers, In the
harbor of Havana, and the glories in store for the
navy blue. He wants more-ships and moro money,
aud Is unceasing In his importunities of Senators
for the bones aud sinews of war. There are whis
perings that we are to have a new policy In regard
to Cuba, and tbe good old Secretary of state, who
don't want to stay lu tho Cabinet and won't bo
kicked out, becomes at once, not only an object of
Indifference, but a positive annoyance. Mr. Fish is
not only tbe reputed friend of Spain, but Sidney
Webster, his son-in-law, has long been the legal
counsellor of Spanish Interests. Webster Is now here
seeking to discover the meaning of the
movement hero In favor of Judge Fierrepont
and the Cuban intrigue whlcb Is at tho bottom of It.
This is tho movement in which Babcock is so much
Interested, and accounts for the anxiety to get Fish
out of it, but does not explain the sudden war policy
of the administration. When the Spanish attache?
arrives here with his despatches to tho Spanlsn
Minister tho State Department will not bo In tne
hands of a Secretary breathing the spirit of the new
policy, unless Fish can be got out of it. This la the
reasou why tho sa'oilltes of tho administration are j
cursing Senator Wilson lor his Ill-advised assistance
In inducing Fish to "slick," and the poor old man
will yet find out that In trying to please everybody
nobody Is pleased. The character of the despatches
which Spain has sent to the United States Is still a
matter or speculation, but thero can be little doubt
tbat tboy demand an explanation of Fresidcnt
Grant's meaning In that part of tho Message
which refers to Cuba, and call tho attention of
our government to tho alleged violations, in
the protection afforded to the Hornet and Florida,
or the spirit of neutrality contained In the rules
adopted under tbe Treaty of Washington, if this
hypothesis should prove to oe true, nnd It Is gener
ally credited among the few persons who can pre
tend to Judge of the complications with Spain, It
will go far to explain tbe peculiar attitude of that
Fower with regard to the Conference at Geneva,
ana the position about to be assumed by tho British
government respecting those very vessels. Tho
Spanish Minister Is evidently alarmed, not so much,
perhaps, at the perplexity of the complications as
the suddenly belligerent tone of the President's
Message and the idle chatter or tho Secretary of tbe
Navy. Should war ensue It will be owing to an un
diplomatic word in tne President's counsel to Con
gress and the talk of an official cbaltorer among
unofficial busybodies and gossips.
Tho danger to tho administration In a political
senses independently of all the whisperings about
Impeaobmcnt and the antagonisms of party differ
ences will 00 developed in committco of the whole
In the House to-morrow, on the promised motion of
General Banks. There Is a disposition to hurry up the
appropriation of $350,000 for defraying the exponas
of the Geneva Conference, but while nearly every
body will, probably, vote for the resolution, the
wnole subject will be dissected In the debate. Not
only the friends or the President, bnt tho leaders of
both parties are alarmed for the security of
American interests before the Board of Arbitration.
The way in which the Board of Arbitration is con
stituted under the treaty is unsatisfactory to many
Representatives, and the results or tne Conference
at best are doubtful.
Lord chler Justloe Oockbum cannot be expected
to be mendly to us, bound, as he cannot fan to be,
by the views of his own government. Count
Scelopls, the Italian, and Baron Oajuba, tbe Bra
zilian arbitrator?tho former the servant of the
famor of the Spanish King, and the latter a Portu
guese whom a long residence in Paris has made
an old-lasnioned Frenchman?cannot bo expected
to be naturally favorable either to us, to our insti
tutions or to our views of tho comity of nations,
especially in an isolated instance, such as that
which will come before them for determination and
Judgment.
Mr. staempfle, the Swiss arbitrator, la the repre
acntativo of a nominal republio, but It Is not con*
?Idered sale to depend upon his republican proclivi!
ties In bearing down upon his colleagues
or controlling their action. The decision
wOl be rendered In the very heat or the
Presidential canvass, and if it is against us, as It Is
now confidently expected it will be, it will be nsed
with terrible effect by tbe democracy. Herein Is,
then, a sodden gleam of hope for the demooratlo
leaders, and tho reason in a nutshell for the sod
den change of policy toward Spain in the Presi
dent'* mat at intervention. Failure at Geneva
cannot do traced to our counsel. General crushing
is, without exception, the ablest lawyer in the
country. William M. Rvarta is scarcely inferior to
him, either in reputation or ability. Mr. Walte, a
gentleman whom nobody appears to know, is also
weti versed in international law. Everything that
counsel can do will be done; bnt wnen Mr.
Cox takes the floor to-morrow?unless, Indeed, the
Apportionment bill should crowd it off?to favor the
appropriation, but demonstrate the futility of the
arbli ration by the nnfrlendly foreigners who are to
Judge the case under the terms 01 the Treaty of
Washington, the question will have assumed a new,
a wonderful and a most unexpected phase. It will
then be shown that the treaty Is weak in this
great essential of strength. While the point or In
ternational law that England was bound to use
every effort to prevent the depredations of the
Dlratcsls frankly admitted, sue wni endeavour to
show, not only that due diligence m pre
venting the escape was exercised, bat that
the getting away or the vessel Is
admitted by the treaty Itself as an actual escape.
The trouble here is that we allowed the treaty to be
worded so loosely and yet so cunningly that while
we have admitted the escape of the craisors from
the English ports there is not a word to indicate a
claim of English liability, showing bow weak and
short-sighted was the work or our High Commis
sioners in these respects. The Coss-Herran Treaty,
growing out of the riot on the Isthmns of Panama, |
In 1856?about which there were preliminary nego- j
tt at ions for many years?will be cited, and it
will be shown that General Cass would {
not allow tne treaty to be Blguod till the ,
responsibility was acknowledged, and had been in
sorted In the document Itself, as a predicate th^t
New Granada should acknowledge her liability (or
all outrages ana wrongs committed by the citizens j
of that republic. The Secretary held t nat it was the |
acknowledgment of liability which was flrst ueces- ,
sary, bo that the only duty left to the commission* I
era would be to determine the amount or damages
and make award to parties after full prooi. The !
failure to do tnis in the present instance, the proba- .
bility of rnllure to secilVe tne payment of any j
damages whatever for tbo Anglo-rebel depreda
tions, and the unnecessary disposition to provoke
a war with Spain has stirred up an immense quan
ttty of bile, and will In the end entirely overshadow
all the efforts of the Trumbull-Schurz faction to
overwhelm Grant and with the awkward decision i
of the Board 01 Arbitrators In tno middle of the
Presidential canvasses completely put out the light
|-of "the man with the cigar." At least this is the
hope of the democratic leaders, and they are so con
fident tnat the meeting of the Executive Committee
has been deferred till January.
Proceeding* in Beth Home*?The Inventign
tlon and Kctico.-fniieiir, Apportionment and
Labor and Education flennure*.
The campaign of the recalcitrant republicans
against the administration was continued in the
Senate to-day, but It was for from being In any way
aa brilliant as the battle which Is promised in the
House to-morrow on the Treaty of Washington.
So far as results are concerned tney were or no im
portance, and though the Senate consumed four
hours to-day in the discussion of a reso
lutlon, reported from the republican cau
cus by Mr. Anthony, lor the organization
of a Joint standing Committee on Investigation and
Retrenchment, the only thing accomplished was a
still wider breach lu the republican party. The ob
ject of this oommitteejseems to be to act as a sort of
detective corps and grand jury on tne Executive
portion ol the government, it differs from the com
mittee proposed oy Senator Trumbull lu this, that
It Ls a regular standing committee Instead of a
"special committee," and is to nave the usual privi
leges and powers of a standing committee, iustead
of the extraordinary ones proposed by the
Illinois senator. The debate to-day was
of a rambling nature, and was brought about
by an amendment, offered by Truiubnll, giving the
new committee power to sit in perpetual ses
sion, and to investigate everybody ana everytuiug
without fear or hiudrauce. This appears to be
Trumbull's Idea of getting at civil service reform.
In this he was bached up by Schurz, who In iho
course of bis remarks produced the report
of the committee of the last Congress which
investigated the "general order" business of
the New York Custom House as an ex
ample of the stupendous Bauds dally
perpetrated against the government without cor
rection, and which, "notwithstanding the promises
of the Presldenc of reform in the civil service, are
still maintained." Said the Senator, "a pound of
performance would be more acceptable to the conn
try than a ton of such promises." He cited the
case of Colonel Leet, who resigned from General
Grant's stair and took a personal letter lrom Grant
to the Collector of Customs, which secured him the
"general order" business, from which his income la
said to be from fifty to ono hundred thousand dollars
a year. Ana yet, in spite or the protests of tho mer
chants and the Secretary of the Treasury himself, he
Is maintained In that position, wntch the Missouri
Senator thinks Indicates a power somewhere greater J
than that of the Scoretary. Schurz's earnestness
brought out Conkilng to the defence of the W'hlte
House and the republican party generally. He '
controverted tne statements of Schurz about I
tho New York Custom House, saying i
tnat tho committee of investigation jras
the work of the republican party, and all the recom
mendations of that committee for reform hud been
carried out by the Executive, Morton, Edmunds
and Anthony followed up in tho same strain, and
during the last hour the debate fell into a sort of a
runulng flre from both sides as to whother the re
publicans or democrats stole the most, and as to
which party had gone the furthest to punish the
thieves At four o'clock tho dobate got to be very
stupid and trifling, and so an adjournment was
effected without a vote being reached.
In the House yesterday, Mr. Connor, of Texas,
failed to introduce a bill calling for iulormatiou
relative to Governors of Territories?of their pere
grinations in foreign countries and their status gen
erally.
After tho expiration of the morning hour Mr.
Hoar, from the Committee on Education and
Labor, called up a bill providing for a
commission of throe persons to examine the
subject of the hours of labor and the divisions of
the profits on Jabor, and asked to bave a day ap
pointed for its special consideration. This question
proved to bo of Interest by the flutter its mentlnn
occasioned. The objeots of tbe bill being to pro.
vide only tor investigation upon tbe questions in
volved In labor, tbe causes of discontent among
the worklngmen, and to discover, If posslolo, the
remedy, opposition to It was not looked
for from any quarter, and surpriso was
manifested at the promptness with which Mr. Kerr,
of Indiana, moved to lay the bill on the table. The
motion being lost Mr. Hoar proceed to address the
Houso upon the merits of tho measure, anu soon he
aroused Interest and held attention, which in
creased as lie proceeded. The failure to give this
subject light in the Old World, he said, had created
tne International, an organization which is making
Us voice heard and its power felt throughout
the civilized world, Mr. Dawes regretted the action
of the other side in refusing to give attention to this
overshadowing question, and appealed to Messrs.
Wood and Kerr to withdraw their opposition to the
consideration of tne bin. Mr. Korr replied that lie
hoped the gentleman from Massachusetts would
give ihat side of the House an opportunity to be
neurd upon tbe bill, that they might prove
fhe falsity of tho charge made that they
were opposed to it. Mr. noar replied that they had
shown no desire to be heard, but on tho contrary
moved to dispose of the question. With discussion
Mr. Kerr grew restire in tne position In which he
fonnd himself, and Mr. Hoar proceeded with the
consideration of It, yielding this time to different
members who wished to speak upon the bill. Lew
Campbell made a point of order Involving, he said,
the practloe which had grown up among members,
without sanction of law, of farming out the
time belonging to them among those tbey wished
to have apeak. The' Speaker effectually disposed
of that point, by having the rule upon the subject
read. Mr. Celley, of Pennsylvania, spoke warmly in
favor of a full and free investigation of the subject
involved in wages and labor. He declared the
same causes were in operation here that baa
pauperised Great Britain. In oar great
cities are to bo eeen already tbe aame re
suite, and inquiry may reveal the causae
and suggest a remedy. Alter a spirited
discosetod the bill west oyer, 1*1114 tig biaiaey
for the ttHv.ulng hour until Anally disposed of. It
i will probably provoke much discussion, democrats
being anxious to get out of the predicament
they are m regarding it, and members gen*
erally being anxious to speak upon It. The
1 Apportionment bill then came un in Com
mittee of the Whole. Debate was in earnest
ness, assuming a tinge of bitterness as conflicting
interests meut and clash. The ilme tor general do
bate was limited to one hour. Messrs. Kerr, Cox
and Potter spoke in criticism of the effect of the
fourteenth amendment, aud generally favoring a
Ilouse not larger than the present one. On the re
publican side Mr. Bmgham was the principal
' speaker, supporting the original bill, which, as
It now stands, calls for 283 members. The Ohio
rhetoricniu was great on the claims of the
great West. The discussion on tne matter is
settling down to a simple question of lucreuse of
uunib^i over the present number, and to the prop
osition of General Butler to provide that Represent
atives shall be elected on the second Thursday In
November. This was discussed by dlffereut mem
bers from stales whose elections are now held at
different times in the year. Butler's proposition
will not be operative until 18<4, and will
not then effeot States whose elections are held in
the spring. After the committee rose there was
quite "a tempest in a teapot" over a resolution re
ported by Air. Kandail, from the Committee on
Rules, allowing the Delegate iroiu this District a
place on the District Committee; also allowing a
Territorial Delegate a seat on tho Committee on
Territories. The rule was finally adopted by a vote
01 two to one, when the llouse adjourned.
Republican i-enutorial t kik-ui.
The republican Senators reassembled In caucus
this morning at half-past ten and remained m ses
sion until uooa. When tho Senate was called to
order the flushed faces and knit brows of Chandler,
Oonkllug and others gave occular demonstration
to ouservaut eyes or the troth ol rumors
which had oo/.ed out, of the caucus
room that the discussion was even more turbulent,
bitter and personal than yesterday. Messrs. 'Trum
bull, Schorz, Wilson, Tipton, Edmunds, Conkilng,
Anthony and Morton were the principal combat
ants. The near approach or noou compelled the
chairman to bring iho disputants to a vote, the
result of which was the adoption of a substitute pre
pared by Senator Morton, providing for a standing
committee of seven, entitled Retrenchment and In
vestigation, whoso duty it should be to consider
and investigate all matters referred to it by the
Benate. It is easily seen now much less sweeping
in character it is than that Mr. Trumbull proposes,
and it Is evident that the administration senators
understand the adroit role played by the
Illinois caocnser, who, while declaring himself a
friend of the President aud a faithful supporter
of his administration, in the opinion oi senators
like Morton, Coukling ana Chandler, is roaliy seek
ing to gain proinmeuce by such pretences to un
deimlne Grant und create capital for the expected
resistance to his renomination, which tne recalci
trants think they may yet inako formidable. AH
these points were wrangled over In
caucus, and threats were freely Indulged
In by the majority of reading out those
who declared they wouli oppose in open Senate,
the Morton resolution. After It bod been adopted
in party confcreuco the Irrepressible 'l'lpton, of
Nebraska, flew the truck entirely, and, repudiating
in advance any concession, retired troni the caucus
In tborongn disgust. The caucus was lolly
attended. Mr. Morton's motion is reported
as having been adopted by the following
vote:?For It Messrs. Alcorn, Ames, Anthony, Bore
man, Buckingham, Carpenter, Chandler, Clayton,
Gonkling, Corbett, Cragm, Edmunds, Kerry of Mich.,
Flanagan, Freiinghuysen, Gilbert, Harlan, Hamlin,
IIill, Howe, Kellogg, Lewis, Morrill of Vt., Morton,
Nye, Osborn, Pomeroy, Pool, Pratt Ram
sey, Rice, Scott, Sherman, Stewart and
Wlndom?36. Against the motion and In
favor of the Trumbull resolution were Messrs.
Caldwell, Fenton, Ferry or Connecticut, Hltcncock,
Logan, Patterson, Sawyer, Suhurz, Spencer, Sum
ner, Trumbull of West, Wilson and Wright?four
teen. Messrs. Brownlow, Cole, Hamilton of Texas,
Morrill or Maine, Robertson and Sprague were
; absent. With the exception of Mr. Sprague these
may be coauVed lu with the administration senators.
I Tlit) Political Trouble in Ueorgis.
Georgia republicans who arrived here to-day ex
press themselves greatly disgusted with the course
of Acting Governor Conley. The democratio ma
jority in the Legislature having passed a bill
ordering a special election for Governor,
the Acting Executive, claiming the election to be
Illegal, announced a determination to contest the
result. A majority of active republicans proposed
to nominate a candidate and so get their party Into
working order. They agreed with Governor Oonley 1
to discuss the legal points raised. It was known
that the President deemed It best to run a candi
date. Mr. Conley, wno Is regarded, in spite of
all disclaimers, as Governor Bullock's and the
railroad ring's legatee, gave his party associ
ates to understand that he would remain neutral.
On this it was determined to put Mr. J. Atkins, of
Savannah, in nomination. The Governor opposed
the proceeding at once, for np to the time of reach
ing this decision he and his lrlends had not believed
that a nomination was possible. So the republi
cans liavo abandoned the idea of contesting the
demooratio choice. This action is m any event the
finishing stroke to Foster, Uloagett, Bollock and
Company.
TUp A imln-American Commission.
The United States and British Commission re
sumed their session to-dav. In the case of John
Holmes Ilanna vs. the United States, No.
2, the commissioners decide that the
United States cannot be held liable ror
injuries causod by the acts or rebels
over whom they could exercise no control and
which acts the; had no powor to prevent. Upon
this ground, and without giving any opinion upon
other points raised In the case, which will be con
sidered hereafter In other cases, the cialra of John
Holmes Ilanna is therefore disallowed. In the case
of Alfred Paul Walker vs. The United States, No. 13,
the Commissioners decide that this claim Bhall be
disallowed, as stating no case for a claim against
the United States within the intent of the treaty.
The Commission adjourned until to.morrow.
Civil Service Hi-form.
The House Committee on Civil Service Reform
met to-day and considered the general nature of
the work they are charged with. A curious para
graph appeared this morning in the administration
organ here, denouncing the plan of the
Curtis Commission in advance, and declaring that
a practicable schemo would be matured by
Mr. Kelley's committee. Tnls is regarded as
another of the proofs, daily accumulating, of the
Jealousy with which Congressmen look upon any
movement which will really relieve them of the
power of controlling patronage.
Indian Affairs and Patents.
The committees on Indian Affairs and Patents
met to-day, and devoted their session to an exami
nation of referred bills. There will be some im
portant changes considered with regard to Ute
Patent laws.
Tobacco Ntnmps and the Tobacco Tax.
The demand for the sixteen cent tobacco stamps is
so great ihat the Internal Revenue Department has
much difficulty in filling orders with sufficient
promptness to suit the tobacco mannfacturera and
dealers. EUrht millions of these stamps were sold
in November, which is double the number ever
furnished before In a single month, and
the orders are still Increasing, it is gen
eraliy thought that any uniform tax which
Congress can be induced to fix will not be less than
twenty-fonr cents per pound for all grades, ana the
dealers are, therefore, anxious to secure the benefit
of the present tax on the tnlerlor qualities by

Richmond, Va., Dec. 13, 1871.
A large meeting of gentlemen representing all
portions of the State was held hero last night and
to-day to consider the best means to promote
immigration. The report of the busiuess com
mittee says this meeting 01 the cltlaens of Ylrglnla,
gathered from all parts of the state, expresses
faithiniiy the conviction of ail its people in declar
ing that the paramount need and desire ot Virginia
Is to secure
INTRODUCTION 0F CAPITAL AND SUFFICIENT LABOR
In utilising the agricultural, mineral and manufac
turing resources of the State, and that the people
and the government of Virginia will extend a cor
clal welcome and a fostering care to Immigrants
irom all parts or thta country and irom Europe who
come to employ these essential helps within her
limits. Then follows a series of suggestions. As
most prominent among the means to be used to
secure the desired end, the Legislature is now In
voked to lend Its aid, substantial and otherwise, in
furtherance of tne object.

Sailing of the British fxpeditlon?Four Tea*

The members or the British government oxpedls
tlon which was despatched for the observation of
this eclipse of the sun, under charge ol Mr. Lock
yer, sailed lrom Southampton In the steamship
Mlrzupore, for different stations In the north of
Ceylon, on the roth day of last October.
They were aware that the lorm of total obscuration
of the sun would endure only two minutes and a half,
and were, therefore, fully prepared to note the
grand event. The arrangements were all com
pleted with groat care, and, owing to the courtesy
or the 1'enlusulor aud oriental company's officers,
everything?even to the smallest Ley don Jars?were
shipped safely, althougb the Instruments, weighing
four tons, all of them costly uad delicate, only arrived
at toe port during the same mormug. The observers
undertook a loug aud aiduuus journey to view the
phenomena o( a total eclipse. A lew clouda
veiling lor thrto minutes the plaoe oi the
eclipsed sun would render lutile ail the exertions,
all the cost and trou do oi the journey to tne Indian
seas, the sgtu or Mr. tockyer and his colleagues
and Ibo perfection of the instruments. It argues ncr
slight desire to increase our knowledge?no small
zeal In the cause oi science?teat so much should
have beeu done and risked where, after all, even
with all the circumstances favorable, the results
mgy not be such us astronomers hoped to obtain.
British Autiipations.
After the departure of the expedition au Eugllsh
writer indulged la the (ollowiug anticipatory com
inenis on the undertaking:?
Let It be noted?lu lairuess not only to Mr. Lock
ycr and the expedltlou under his charge, but also to
tnose observing parties wuicu wld uo stationed la
India, Java and Northern Australia?that the task
bet before the observers of tne approachiug eclipse
Is altogether more dull cult than any whlcn has
hitherto been attempted. It would not be difficult
to repeat tho observations made during the Ameri
can eclipse ol 18011 und during the Mediterranean
eclipse of 1870, but (o do ihis would he to do noth
ing. tiomothlng new must uo learned or the expe
dition nngnt us well not huvo sailed.
And to discover Homeiliiuir new alter eo many
8'iiiiul observers have been ut work in the sumo
Held is likely to prove no easy tusk. Thcie is nut
a single moment in the progress 01 totality wulch
has not been ulreudy utilized by others. The instant
wtien the last ray ol direct Hiinlightis just oiduerated
has been employed by Proiessor Vouug, of Ame
rica, to such purpose us to reveal the existence of a
marvellously complex soiar .ionosphere, in watch
tho vapors of our lamdlar metals replace the gases
winch la our air form the breath ol life. Prom tual
first instant onwards until the inoui ui w hen the
sun Is about to disappear, ih:it glory or light which
astronomers oall the corona has been studied aud
analyzed lu such sort that one would imagine that
nothing new could be teamed respecting It. Vet
our expeditionists linvo si t forth with tho pur
pose of learning something now, ami the
lault will not be theirs if ihoy are uumccesafal. To
encourngo tiioiu to strenuous exertion tlioy have
this to consider, thai l( tliey full lnuny months
must pass beiore astronomers have another oppor
tunity to Institute such researches as they now pro
pose to make. It is unite certain that we shall not
nave to call tho attention of our readers to any
eclipse expeditious either in 1872 or 18JH. In the
latter year, indeed, mere will bo uo total solar
eclipse ut all. And the total eclipse of No voinbor
?o, lni'J, is such a one mat no astronomer is likely
to lake the trouble to witness it. it is so barely
total that it actually begins and on<u on the earta
as an annular one, the moon at those times not
ludy hiding the sun even on the Hue of central
eclipse. It 1s only In tile middle of Uie moou'8
shadow track upon the eaitn Unit the sun will ua
falrlr hidden, and there oniy forafuw seconds. Not
until April lti, 1874, will there bo au eclipse wortli
au eclipse expedition, and lu these dajsoi rapid net
eutlllc progress au interval ol twenty-eight momus
seems ilkean;uge. our observers, theu, in India'aml
Ceylon, ,ati Well as the continental astronomers it)
Java, and the colonial astronomers in North Aus
tralia, are bound to exert themselves most dili
gently, so that astronomers may nut want ecltpso
pabulum during that Ion., interval.
AMERICAN AND OTHER PANT RKSKAUCUSS.
It bi easy to ludtcate thu posniou to which past
researches have brought the student or that wou
; derful crow a ot light which is seen around the
i eclipsed sun. The Arnericau observers In laCti
found that this object Is In great part sell luminous,
and that Its light in some respects resembles la
1 quality thut of the aurora boreaiis. ilut doubts
; prevailed as to the oxlousiuu of this seli-lurninoua
j solar glory. Home thought that it did nut extend
> more than some ulneir thousand miles from ilia
! suti'S surface, while others believed that Its ex.
tension was to bo measured by hundreds ol
tiiuusauds of miles. Last year the American
observations wcie continued, and some
thing was learned us to the extent of
Uio corona. A certain well marked gap
I or darn rUt in the corona then seen was photo
graphed in Spain by an American, and also in Sicily
y an Englishman. These photographs, enlarged to
a common scale, were submitted to Sir Jonu
llersehel, aud by nim pronounced decisive as to (ho
extra terrestrial character ol a radiated corona ex
tending at least as far from the sun as tue oounva
ried ol this gap.
CAtrnoN.
1 On such a matter llerschel'a opinion?always
authoritative?niuy be regarded as all but dual.
The existence ol a real solar appendage reaching at
least a million nates Irom the sun's surface,
having thus ibeen demonstrated, it remained
lor the present observers to determine Ifovr
this Ktraugo appendage is shaped, and
how constituted. I hey had to distinguish It
Iroui an that light with which this appendage Itsell
fllis our utinospuero during tue progress ol a total
eclipse?to avoiil beiug deceived, as so many have
been deceived, by the strange optical e dec is pro
duced during tho pa-sago of the moon's vuss
shadow through the uir uoove and urouud them.
At ihat time lalse rays appear, which tho inex
perienced too readily comouud with the trno
coronal beams. There is also a semblance of
motion even among those rays whteh are really
fixed, Everything has been new and startling, and
bo slight mental etlorl required to Ux the thoughts
on that sole leatnre whlcn the observer hhu under
taken to examine, wtien so mm n f what ts taking
place around tends to distract his attention.
THE rilOTOOHAI-ll CAM: RA AND ITS C8R.
Fortuuatoly rii instrument was used which re
coided the features of the eclipse without being in
uuy way affected by the dlsiractlons we have tnea
tiunod. The telescoplst may ran to make u-e(ul ob
servations. or he may be so misied ns to make false
ones; the spectroscopy uiav bo utiAblo to distin
guish between the light of the cornuaaml that ol the
illuminated air; the draughtsmau may produce
some ol tuose marvellous pictures on which so much
stress has lately beeu laid; but the puotograpnlo
camera will do its work unmoved by the appauing
aspect of the surroundiug scene. Whatever the
photographic pictures may show, we are made
certain that neither excitement nor affec
tion for a favorite theory has Influenced
the result. Much or the information obtaiued by
other means will be greatly Increased In value by the
photographic records. If the spvctruscopiat baa got
light oi suca and such a quanty from a certain part
or the corona tho photograph wilt show what was
the aspect of that particular portion. It a draughts
man aucceeas in picturing the corona with some de
gree or accuracy the photographs will render it
easy to intcrpcet such parts of tue work an may be
less perfect than the rest.
We are inclined to hope (rest things from Utt
photographers oi Uua latest eclipse of tag gum
