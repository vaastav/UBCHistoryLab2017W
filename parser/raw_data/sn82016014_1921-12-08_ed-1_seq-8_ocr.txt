Sen. Capper Urges Throwing
Out "Fod Goufrers."
Agricultural liloc" Leader
Would Stop AH Speculation.
Washington, Dec. 8. Drive out the
food gougers, the speculators in farm
and garden products, with an effec
t.vc co-operative marketing system,
legalizetl and backed up by the guv
einment, Senator Arthur Capper, Jte
publiean, of Kansas, a leader of the
"arricultui;i bloc." demanded today.
Capper struck hard at the "specu
lative midd lenia n," whom he accused of
heatiner the . -oducer and "soaking"
th consumer.
"The agricultural bloc" is pressing
for the early enactment of a bill spon
sored by Tapper for establishment of
co-operative marketing, to which
President Harding: said in his message
to congress Tuesday "every proper
encouragement should be given."
Capper believes "encouragement"
should take a definite and positive
form.
"Farmers are not asking for a spe
cial privilege," he said, "but a clear-
cut, definite statement in the form of
a law from the government telling
them what t'tey may do in the way of
co-operative activity, so all doubt may
be removed from the legality of such
operations in a certain definite field.
"Having been at tho mercy of a
system of marketing and distribution
of foodstuffs, the most costly in the
world, for many years, the American
people are quite well unified in their
demand for reform that will trulv ac-
tabiet compiisn results.
apper declared that more equit
able marketing- will prevent loss to
t he average farmer, "cut costs and
risks of production, reduce the spread
between the consumer and producer
and thus give farm products to the
consumer cheaper."

Milton S. Moorehead while serving a
murder sentence at the state penl

Moorehead was convicted of killing'
an officer of the law. His sentence
has been commuted from first de
cree murder tn first degree man
slaughter. Apparently he has known
little of the hardship of prison life
and has been at liberty much of the
time during1 the last few months. Now
the Manhattan club women want the
prisoner punished in keeping with
his offense and the verdict of the jury
which heard the evidence rather than
according to mush ladle prison reform
policies.

Homecoming For Dover Boys
In front ure the three Dover lads who vuui fame at the International Stock
Slum. Heading left to right, they are, Simon Madden, Warner liodgers
and William Jordan. Back of them are, right to left, 'John R. Tomson, of
Dover, former president and now a director of the National Shorthorn
Breeders' association, and I". O. BIccha, Shawnee comity farm agent.
The Dover Calf club has planned a
big meeting to be held at Dover Satur
day, December 10, not only to cele
brate the close of its work for the
season., but as homecoming to three of
its members who won fame at the In
ternational Livestock show held last
week at Chicago.
The three boys are Warner Rodgers.
Simon Madden and William Jordan,
who captured third place in the boys'
division in international livestock
judging. Rodgers, who was three
years younger than any other boy
entered, won second honors in the
individual group. Because of their
success the boys were entertained by
all of the big packing companies at
Chicago and had the time of their
young lives.
The Dover Calf club, which has been
fostered largely by John R. Tomson.
is composed of eleven boys, and the
stock they have raised the past season
will be judged Saturday by Prof. F.
W. Bell, of the State Agricultural col
lege. Each animal will be judged in
dividually and then for gain and the
cheapest gain made the past season.
X. Pearson, also of the State Agricul
tural college and representing the1 County Shorthorn association.
; State Calf club department, will at
j tend the meeting.
The people of Dover have made ex
! tensive plans for the meeting which
I will be an all-day session. Lunch will
be served at noon and music will be
furnished by the Elmont Corn club
band. The judging of the livestock
will take place during the forenoon.
In the afternoon addresses will be
made by Professor Bell and John R
Tomson, former president and now a
director of the National Shorthorn
Breeders' association. Tomson has
succeeded in putting Dover on the map
in livestock circles and himself is a
national authority on cattle. His pic
ture in the form of an oil painting
hangs in the hall of fame at the Sad
dle and Sirloin club in Chicago, this
being a collection of men who have
won international fame by performing
signal service for the livestock in
dustry. Following the two addresses, the
three Dover boys who won the hon
ors at Chicago, will be given cham
pionship banners and individual rib
bons by L. H. Xeiswender, president of
the Shawnee County Farm bureau. All
of the eleven members of the Dover

SWALLOW WITHIN RIGHTS
Topeka Police Chief Cleared in Suit
Following Holding of Prisoner.
Peace officers have the right to
hold a prisoner a reasonable length
of time without a warrant when there
is probable cause to believe him guilty
pf crime.
This was the ruling made today by
Judge George Whitcomb of the dis
trict court, in a case in which L. E.
Allen of Muscarine, la. was suing Guy
Swallow. cHief of police, for $500
damages. Allen was arrested here
several months ago by the police at
the request of Muscatine authorities
who starteu extradition proceedings.
Allen brought a habeas corpus suit
and was released by Judge James Mc
Clure, but immediately picked up
again by Sheriff Robert Miler.
The errtradition was granted by
Governor Allen, and the pr.soners was
returned to Muscatine, tried and con
victed on a burglary charge and sen
tenccf. to the penitentiary. He then
brought suit against Chief Swallow,
allegir.g that he had suffered great
mental pain and anguish and had
thereby been damaged to the sum of
$500.
Judge Whitcomb said he was con
vinced that the proceedings had been
accordi g to statute and that so long
as an officer is keeping within the
law he must be protected, otherwise
the criminal element of society would
overrun the country and law enforce
ment would be rendered impossible,

your days with the food you
eat, finally the wish is likely
to come true.

wish for a good day. Nothing
miraculous; just the natural
result from right food with
the right taste.

blood, with just those ele
ments which nature requires
building strength without
any "heaviness." .
Grape-Nuts is the per
fected goodness of wheat and
malted barley, scientifically
