The Philadelphia Record submits
the following: "Will the money to
go to New Orleiins come out of the
ChristninH fand ? or will Cliristmus
stockings go limp on account, of ex

Thk President's message
rend in Congress Monday. There
was nothing startling about it. It
reads smoothly, and as
of the progress of thenational affairs,
it is all that can be wished for.
Arthur recommends the stoppage of
the coinage of eighty-five cent dol
lars and ttie issue of silver certifi
cates. This is a most timely
ing, as ttie weight of some
silver dollars are rutiler light. The
Philadelphia Record
remains to be said, however, of tiiis
colorless message that there is no
cause of offense in it, Mr. Arthur
will gn out of tho Presidency with
the good wishes of the people. Ho
has served them faithfully, and has
shown in a large degree that politi
cal dexterity which always makes
the best of an unfavorable situation.
His administration has been
markably free from scandals
