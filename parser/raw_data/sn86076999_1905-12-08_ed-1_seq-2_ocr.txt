TREASON FOR RATE REGULATION.
In hla annual report to Congress,
Attorney-General Moody brings to
bear a strong argument In favor of
granting the Interstate Commerce
Commission, power to fix a railroad
rate in any case where the existing
ch'arge is found, on investigation, to
be unjust or excessive. The Attorney
General points out that one of the
great evils to be corrected is the prac
tice of allowing rebates or prefer
ential rates to favored shippers, which
gives such persons a great and wrong
ful advantage over their competitors,
especially the smaller shippers. He
argues that were the Commission
given power to fix a maximum raie
it could, upon proof that a special
rate had been allowed some favored
shipper, make that special rate a
.maximum charge upon all freight of
the same kind. This, he shows, woul-i
effect a speedy reform, because the
very power In the Commission to so
reduce a freight charge would make
the railroads exceedingly careful to
stick to the regular ttariff. He also
points out that the effect would be
to take away from the large shippers
the inducement to struggle for a
secret' reduction, because if the gen
eral rate were lowered, after com
plaint, all competitors would get the
benefit of it.
This, in effect, is also one poinS
made by President Roosevelt in his
message.
The object of these rebates ' or
special rates, of which so much com
plaint is made, is less to save money
unfair advantages over competitors,
on freight charges than to obtain
and so force them to the wall. It Is
by such means that the Standard Oil
built up its powerful monopoly and
. continues to crush all attempts to in
dependent competition. The Meat
Trust and numerous otner Trusts, in
cluding the private car lines, .follow
the same course, so as to each obtait
a virtual control of markets if not
an absolute monopoly. Bee.
