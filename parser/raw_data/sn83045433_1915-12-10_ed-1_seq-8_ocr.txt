THE HOME.
What boots it if your home's a hut,
Plain, poor, and all devoid of art,
If thro' Love's door that's never
You enter in the human heart,
And dwell in its embraces warm
Safe from the tempest and the storm?

What's $2951000,000 between friends?
It's about time the man who saw guns on the
Ancona turned up. Or isn't there money in it
any more?
The Kaiser, it is said, has a personal interest
in the removal of Von Papen and Boy-Ed. Wants
to weep over them, probably.
It's a cinch that Bclasco wouldn't have fussed
with a piker like Van dcr Dcckcn if he had tried to
keep track of the Communipaw.
Mr Kord's message to President Wilson may be
interpreted as an announcement that he is a neu
tral in the war on the peace ship.
As yet Col. Roosevelt has given no hint as to
whether his activities will be directed toward keep
ing a "Byzantine logotiicte" in the White House or
getting him out.
The Alhambria Theater in Chicago burned
down. Considerable suspicion attaches to the fact
that no performance was going on at the time as
is customary in such cases. j
St. Louis man was shot and killed by rob
bers because at the command of "hands lip" he
raised only one. However, he died doing all that
could be expected of a one-armed man.
The United States has demanded. of Austria
that she disavow the staling of the Ancona. It
looks better, of course, not to discriminate be
tween such close friends as Austria and Germany.
"The court believes- the barkeeper has a great
many things to disturb his balance," announced a
Baltimore justice, in fining a man who threw a
brick at one who refuted to pell him a drink. And
now the judge will probably be called upon to ex
plain to the prohibitionists how he knows about
the troubles of bartenders.
Special messengers have been distributing
among Senators and Representatives right 'in the
Capitol Building cards handsomely engraved with
pictorial attacks on President Wilson and his for
eign policy. It is announced, however, that pre
cautions have been taken for the interception of
special messengers bearing bombs.
The Kaiser's newspaper organs in Xew York
and Washington continue to display under large
headlines on their front pages dispatches of doubt
ful origin telling of some alleged reverse or dis
couragement met with by the allies somewhere.
Howccr, it is not apparent why this method
should be counted on to make a hit in Berlin, un
less the theory that the linotype is mighter than
the sword has been adopted there, too.
rVccTirat.. -
How remote the prospect is for the beginning
of negotiations for -peace in Europe may be. est
mated irom 'the words of Premier Asquitli in the
British house of commons, and Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg, in the German Reichstag. Mr.
Asquith spoke first, announcing that 'the first
words must come from Germany and Austria, in
the form of serious "proposals for a general peace.
The German Chancellor followed with the decla
ration that his government is prepared 'to discuss
peace only in the event that the proposals pome
from the enemy and are compatible with Ger
many's dignity and safety. The situation cannot
be called a deadlock; rather there is no situation.
In neutral countries far removed from the con
flict a few Optimistic enthusiasts like Mr. 'Ford
and Jane Addams, who" can place war on no higher
plane than a longshoremen's strike riot, will be
encouraged by th mere mention of the word peace
by government spokesmen in commons and the
Reichstag, a wholly insignificant circumstance for
which inquiring Socialists were responsible in each
instance. They wanted to be given some assur
ance, however vague, as to the terms upon which
peace would be considered. They were told, and
the answers may be accepted by the world.
There is every indication that the people of
England and France are more determined than
ever tb carry the fighting to triumph or annihila
tion; nor do they appear in the least disheartened
by Geinany's Siccess in the Balkans, which Von
Bethmann-Hollweg professes to believe justifies
his expectation of a peace proposal. The military
genius of Lord Kitchener in the beginning fore
saw a war of at least three years, and the half way
ground finds Germany and Austria far more de
pleted in resources than the allies, as the result of
their unsuccessful attempts at great and permanent
achievement. Obviously the Germanic allies must
accomplish much more before peace proposals will
come from her enemies.
From Germany, on the other hand, come re
ports of the murmuring of the people, weary of the
heavy sacrifices demanded of them and with di
minished confidence in the outcome of a struggle
against odds that will weigh heavier as each
month goes by. The volume of peace talk in con
quering Germany contrasts sharply with the un
changing discussion of war plans in beaten Eng
land, France and Russia. The calculating observer
at a distance would seem to be justified, therefore,
in turning his car to Germany for the first serious
proposal of peace, in spite of the Chancellor's
boastful words in the Reichstag. His remarks,
too, may easily be construed as an invitation to
the neutral world to exert its influence with the
allies and seek to bring the war to an end now to
Germany's advantage. "Fully conscious of our
unshaken military successes," he said, "we decline
responsibility for continuation of the misery which
now fills Europe and the whole world. No one
can say that we continue the war because we still
desire to conquer this or that country as a guar
antee." It sounds very much like a confession of
doubt as to the outcome of the struggle and a
desire to end it at once if Germany may gain some
thing, or to place the allies in the position of
aggressors if they choose to continue to fight
rather than to yield tribute to those who proclaim
themselves the victors.
Again, the Chancellor says: "The war can be
terminated only by a peace which will give the
certitude that war will not return. We all agree
about that." The last sentence includes the allies,
even though the speaker may have referred only
to the Teutonic governments. It is what they are
fighting for, and what they believe is to be
achieve only by fighting and not by peace nego
tiations. Our peace organizations may as well subside
and neutral governments continue to keep hands
off, and thus serve posterity the better.
German newspapers express alarm over the
debasing effect of the war on morality, especially
among the young, the Berlin Tageblatt declaring:
"Those who would deny the statement that the
German people arc in danger of being wholly sub
merged beneath an extraordinary wave of laxity
and immorality breaking over the country must
find themsches lamentably disillusioned." What is
to be expected of a people called upon to publicly
celebrate the Lusltania murders and the dropping
of bombs on sleeping women and children?
All apparently is not peace on Ihe peace ship. It
seems that Mine. Schwimmcr, as The Herald inti
mated, has been feeding Henry Ford with promises
that the belligerents would be unofficially repre
sented at his conferences, intimating that she has
documentary representations to that effect. Dr.
Aked wants her to "produce." That Madame re
fuses to do, and we undertake to say will continue
to refuse to do, for we do not believe she has any
such documents. In the meanwhile the argosy of
good will is being rapidly torn by discussion.
Rather funny, what?
Since the United States government has at last
undertaken a serious campaign to rid the country'
of criminal plotters and conspirators it may be
found passible to co-operate in the work with the
representatives of belligerent nations of Europe
without violation of our neutrality. Judging by the j
-fact that nearly all ot those suspected of conspir
acy, incendiary plots, passport forgeries and sub
stitutions upon American soil have so fa'r been ap
prehended as a result of the efforts of the au
thorities of those nations whose interests have
been threatened, as ours have been, it is reason
able to assume that with a little team work more
satisfactory results might fTe achieved.
A Georgia jury,, trying Thomas E. Watson,
once candidate for the Presidency, on a charge of
misusing the mails, disagrees. We suppose all the
regular Democrats voted one way and ' all the
Watson ooliticians the other way. That's the way
juries divide in Georgia. Evidence doesn't cOHBt
Income Tax Changes.
As a part of his plan for restoring the depleted
revenues of the government Secretary of the
Treasury McAdoo in his annual report to Congress
recommends a number of changes in the income
tax law, none of which will add to the popularity
of the administration. To begin with he would
cither raise the rates of the income tax or he
would lower the present exemption of $3,000 for
single and $4,000 for married persons to $2,000
and $3,000 respectively. Also he would have the
surtax begin at $10,000 or $15,000 instead of $20,
000, as provided vy the present law. With the
increased surtax the great majority of the people
will not be particularly concerned, but if such
modest incomes as $2,000 and $3,000 are taxed, or
the present rate of 1 per cent is increased thou
sands of families in the cities, large and small, will
recognize an addition to the high cost of living in
place of the reductions which the Democratic plat
form promised, and votes will undoubtedly be lost
to the party next year. Republicans in Congress
can hardly be expected to put insurmountable ob
stacles in the way of this part of the administra
tion's program.
Incidentally Secretary McAdoo recommends
that the income tax law be amended so as to re
quire every person having a gross income of
$3,000 or more to file a return, instead of every
person with a net income of $3,000 or more, as
the law demands at present. The officials can
judge, then, he explains, whether or not the de
ductions are properly made. It will surprise those
wage-earners and others with gross incomes of
$3,000 or more, who by reason of the specific ex
emption are not required to pay a tax, to learn
that the present law does not require them to go
through the laborious process of making a useless
return. As a matter of fact .the internal revenue
collectors this year sent formal notice to persons
whose gross income was $3,000 or over but not
subject to taxation, that they were nevertheless re
quired to make returns. Evidently this was done
under an arbitrary ruling of the Treasury Depart
ment, for which it seek authority through an
amendment to .the law. It is difficult, however.
to recognize the force of the argument that such
returns are necessary in order that the revenue of
ficials can judge, whether the deductions are prop
erly made. Why not compel every one -who earns
Mr JOHN U. BARKY.
'One df my earliest recollections is of a, young
man who used 'to torture children. His mother
kept a little store' on a street that, as a, boy, I
used to pall every day in," Boston! There he
worked and there'he lured a child of my .acquaint;
ance who was accidentally saved. The law soon
caught ujt with ,him and he was put in prison.
He hat been there ever since. He Is one of the
most interesting prisoners now alive and, one of
the, most .famous. - Hi name is Jesse Pomeroy,
and: I hear that, an ettort has lately been made to
brlnr'abput hb'Velease. ' ' '
-As I grew up I often used to read of Jesse
Pomeroy in the newspapers. Every now and then
he, would 'make an attempt to escape. His meth
ods showed marvelous patience anS ingenuity.
Sonyetimes he would work with a nail or a file and
spend months in boring a hole through a" brick
wall, h.several occasions he came very near get
ting out, Incidentally, he was devoting himself to
study. He became an-accomplished linguist.
Jesse Pomeroy is in the sixtiesnow. I suppose
he has become, more or less inured to living In a
cell. And yet he is known to long for freedom.
He long ago showed himself to be an intelligent
man, normal in all ways save in his weakness for
inflicting torture on children. It is obvious that
he is or was mbrally insane. To a high degree he
developed an instinct often found among children,
showing itself in the desire to give pain to weaker
creatures. As most children develop it either dis
appears or it becomes controlled by reason or by
nnidcncc. In Jesse Pomeroy, instead of becom
ing controlled, it remained beyond control into
maturity.
Many people have been interested in this case.
Occasionally a humanitarian expresses pity and
wonders if something can't be done for the pris
oner. A few years ago the governor of Massa
chusetts had his sympathies aroused. He decided
Jo give Pomeroy more freedom. Later he changed
his mind. Under his successor. Gov. Walsh, Pome
roy is now allowed to attend services in the
chapel.
During all these years the world has been mov
ing. Science has grown wiser and more humane.
In Jesse Pomeroy psychology finds a fascinating
subject. What made him so unfortunate? Who
should bear the blame? Is Jesse Pomeroy the re
sult of forces that run way back through the gen
erations? Or did the strange twist in Ins nature
come from some accident before birth or from
some untraceable mischance-
Whatever may. be the cause, we must all agree
that the blame cannot be placed on him. And yet
it is he who bears the punishment. So long as he
is dangerous he must be kept away from society.
At present he is classified wrong. In this regard
he may be like all so-called criminals. The time
may come when we shall discard the word. Jesse
Pomeroy is or has been one of the dangerously
insane. He may be all the more dangerous be
cause of his apparent sanity. As a matter of fact,
no one is wholly insane. It is only part of the
mind that is stricken.
Some day there will be institutions for the
treatment of people like Jesse Pomeroy. for the
morally abnormal. They wil) shelter those who
are far less afflicted than he Is, and yet arc unfit
ted for association with their kind. 'I'hey will be
treated not with severity, not with penalties, but
with mercy and helpfulness. Their affliction will
draw out special consideration and sympatliv.
Perhaps, indeed, we may find here the greatest
comfort that can be drawn from considering a
case like that of Jesse Pomeroy. In a startling
wav It teaches us the folly of heaping further
affliction on those nature has already so woefully
afflicted. Of recent years we have made cnoromus
strides in the treatment of the insane. Methods
have been devised for making even those who are
dangerous fairly comfortable, for giving them work-
in the fresh air and for creating wholesome in
terests that tend to occupy and to soothe their,
minds. It would seem that a similar plan with
regard to the morally insane might be feasible.
It surely would be profitable, both for the afflicted
and for society. It would tend to give scientific
men a close acquaintance with abnormal disease
and it might lead to the discovery of clews lead-J
ing to the causes.
After all, it is the causes that arc vitally im
portant. Once discovered, they may lead to com
plete protection for the future generations. At
any rate, they will teach the future generations
how to avoid ways of living that tend to make such
horrors possible.

It appears from the recent report of Gen.
Goethals that the advisory geologists of his canal
commission erred in their judgment with respect
to the ultimate stabilization of the canal prism
after certain slides had slid. In fact, the very
points which were expected by the geologists to
first eain stability arc the points where the earth
movements have continued longest and still con
tinue. The interested and patriotic citizens
whose suggestions as to the treatment of the earth
slides evoked the sarcastic comment of the late
Col. Gaillard do not appear to have been as fool
ish as they were represented. Gen. Goethals pro
poses to take at least 10,000,000 cubic yards of
earth off the sides of the canal orism. and Presi

Rear Admiral Thomas B. Howard,
president of the Naval Retiring Board
at the Washington Navy Yard, discussed
with Secretary Daniels yesterday after
noon the proposed naval personnel legis
lation. Although Admiral Howard is not
a member of the personnel board his
opinion on personnel matters Is held In
such" high regard by the. Secretary that
It Is stated that he was called In to dis
cuss the general principles of the De
partment's bill. i
Opposition will develop In Congress
to the adoption of a policy by which
all of the battleships are to be -built
In government yards. Although It
may be admitted that Secretary Dan
iels Is Justified in awarding 4J and 44

of this work to the government'-yard".
