of
New York, December 18.—A four
story brown stone building, East Tenth
street, is numbered 30 and 32. There is
a store on the ground floor, and iu the
three upper stories of the east wing Mrs.
Farnham lets out furnished rooms to
lodgers. Mrs. Celia Kelly lives in the
west wing on the west side of the brick
wall that divides the houses in two. Miss
Celia Lynugh lives with her*. It was
nearly half past two o'clock when Miss
Lynagh was aroused by a suspicious
smell of smoke. She investigated and
found that it came from Mrs. Farn
hara's premises at No. 32 putting on her
clothes she went down to the street and
pulled the bell of »No. 32 and then tried
the door. It was open. Miss Lynagh shout
ed fire, but no one answered. Then she
resolutely climbed the long stairs to the
second floor, groped her way along tke
landing and rapped on the doors.
"fire! fire! fire!"
she shouted, as loudly as the smoke
which filled her throat would let her.
There were hurried mov erhell ts within
and preparations for flight. Up the second
and the third flights the brave girl groped
her way through the thickening smoke,
knocking on the doors and uttering her
warning cry. At the top the smoke
grew almost insufferable, but Miss
Lynagh did not shrink. She knew
that people lived on the floor
and heard no sound to indicate
that they were awake. The hand
rails and balusters were hot and the
smoke threatened to choke her at every
step. At the head of the stairs she ran
against a door hammered on it and pushed
it open. A man was within sitting awake
in a chair pulling on his clothes. "Hurry,
hurry!" shouted the girl, "the house is
on fire." He did not turn or seem to pay
any attention to hei*. As she turned she
saw the stairway at her feet between the
landing she stood on and the fourth
floor blaze into fire. Resolutely gather
ing her skirts about her, she made a dash
down the flight and got through the Are
unscathed and reached the street in safety.
The firemen met her at the door. She
told them that there was one laggard
still on the top floor, cut off,
but that she thought he had gained
the roof through the scuttle. The fire
men went up, but before they reached
the.burning flight a crash was heard in
the rear of the house aud the missing
lodger was found in the back yard with a
sprained back. He was Charles A. Wat
son, thirty-four years old. The room was
in the rear and the iron ladder to the
scuttle in a cioset in front. Between them
were the stairs that were blazing by the
time he got ready to leave. Escape either
way was out of the question. Mr. Wat
son did the next best thing that could be
done.
He shut his chamber door on the fire,
took the sheets from his bed and, knot
ting them together, tied one end to the
bedstead and threw the other out of the
window. The rope thus made reached
to within sfeven or eight feet of a -nkffrow
extension, the roof of which was uuder
the second story windows. It was haz
ardous to attempt to jump to it for fear
of falling over into the yard, but there
was nothing else to be done. Mr. Wat
son let himself down the length of
the rope and dropped. He dropped
on the edge of the narrow ledge
and from that into the yard. There the
firemen found him, unable to stir, and
sent for an ambulance. The surgeon de
cided that his spine was injured and
removed him to the New York Hospital»
AN ENGLISH HOLOCAUST.
Twelve Per
House at Plymouth, England, and Many
Others Killed
Their Endeavors to Escape—Heroic In
cidents.
London, December li.—A fire, which
caused a frightful loss of life, occurred
last night at Plymouth. Tiie fire broke
out in a tenement house in Love street,
a narrow thoroughfare in the slums de
voted to sailors' lodging houses, cheap
taverns and tall rickety tenements. Most
of tlie occupants of tlie tenements were
asleep when the fire started. Those who
were awake or were awakened by the
tumult made frantic efforts to escape,
In most cases their terror overpowered
their reason, and they escaped from the
burning building only to meet death on
the pavement» One man was instantly
killed and crushed beyond recognition by
jumping from a fomth-story window to
tlie sidewalk. Many of the lodgers threw
mattrasses and other articles of bedding
upon the ground and jumped upon
them from a height of forty feet.
One child was killed in this way, and sev
eral men and women had legs and arms
broken. The fire escapes were crowded
with household goods and were useless.
Many pitiful,sights were witnessed by the
large crowd assembled in the street, but
powerless to help. One lodger, a young
man named Rickford, clung to a window
sill for several minutes with his little
sister under his arm.
been alone he could

parative
swooned and was a dead weight. At last
he had to let go his hold, but managed to
fall in snch a way that the little girl fell
on top of him. Both his legs are broken
and his spine is injured. He is also ter
ribly burned about the face and hands by
the flameh which surrounded him before
he fell. The child is also badly
Sumcd, but will recover. The fire
men worked heroically. Several
of them were detailed to enter the build
ing, which was then a veritable furnace
of fire, and rescue the survivors. These
life-savers plunged into the seething
flames, followed by, the pipemen, who
kept playing the hose upon them, aud
upon each other. In this way several
lives were saved. After the fire was ex
tinguished twelve bodies were found
burned to a crisp. Two lodgers are
still missing.

*To the Congress of ihe tiniiid States :
Your assembling is clouded by a sense of
public bereavement, caused by the recent
sudden death of Thomas A. Hendricks, Vice
President of the United States. His distin
guished public services, his complete integ
rity and devotion to every duty, and hl3
personal virtues, will find honorable rooord
in his country's history. Ample and re
peated proofs Of the estéëm arid confidence
in which he was held'by Ills fellow co'iiri
tryraen were manifested by Ills election to
Offices Of tho most important trust and high
est dignity, and at length, full of years and
honors, he has be?n laid at fest amid uni
versal sorrow and benediction.
The Constitution, which required those
chosen to legislate for the people to annual
ly meet in the discharge of their solemn
trust, also requires the President to give to
Congress information of the States of the
Union and recommend to their considera
tion such measures wbloh, he should deem
necessary and expedient. At the threshold
of a compliance with these constitu
tional directions, it Is well for us to
bear in mind that onr usefulness to the
people's interests will bo prompted by a
konstant appreciation of tho scope and
Character of our respective duties, as they
relate to Federal leglelatldn. While the
Executive may recommend such measures
he shall deem expedient, the responsi
bility for Legislative action must and should
rest upon those selected by the people to
make their laws. Contemplation of grave
and responsible functions assigned to
the executive branches of the Gov
ernment under the Constitution will
disclose the partitions of power between our
respective departments and their neces
sary independence, and also the need for
the exercise of all the power intrusted to
each, in that spirit of comity and co-op
eration which is essential fb the proper
fulfillment of the patriotic obligations
Which rest upon
the people. The jealous watchfulness df
bur constituency aS great afid small sup
plements thëir suffrages, and beforo thé
tribunal they establish every public ser
vant should be judged.
ÖUR FOREIGN RELATIONS—NO dtJEStiONS OF
DIFFIctjL't'Y PENDING WITH ANY
FOREIGN POWER.
It is gratifying to announce that the rela
tione of the United States with all foreign
powers continue to be friendly. Our posi
tion, after nearly half a century df success
ful constitutional government, maintenance
of good faith In allof our engagements, the
avoidance of complications with other na
tions, and consistent and amicable attitude
toward the strong and weak alike, furnish
proof of a political disposition which renders
professions of good will unnecessary.
There are no questious of diffi
culty pending with any foreign government.

A question has arisen with the Gavernment
of Aûstro-Hungary touching the represent
ation of the United States at Vienna. Hav
ing, under my constitutional prerogative,
appointed an estimable citizen of unim
peachable probity and-competency as Minis
ter to that Court, the Governmentof Austro
Hungary invited this Government to the
cognizance of certain exceptions, based up
on allegations against the personal accepta
bility of Mr. Kelly, thé appointed Envoy,
Asking that, in View there tf. the appoiut
meni should be withdrawn. The reasons ad
vanced were such as could not be acquiesced
in without a violation of my oath of office
and the precepts of the Con
stitution, since they necessarily involve a
limitation in favor of a foreign Government
Upon the tight of selection by the Execu
tive, and required such an application Of a
religious test as a qualification for office
under the United States as would have re
sulted in the practical disfranchisement of a
large class of our citizens, and the abandon
ment of a vital principle in our Govern ment.
Tue Austro-Hungarinn Government finally
decided not to receive Mr Kelly as the envoy
of the United States, and the gentleman has

Early in March last war broke out in Cen
tral America, caused by tho attempt of
Guatemala to consolidate the several States
Into a single government. In these contests
between out neighboring States tho United
States forebore o interfere actively, but
lent the aid of their friendly Offices in depre
cation of wnt to promote peace and'rohcoi d
g tlie belligerents, aud by sucli counsel
Contributed importantly to the preservation
of tranquility in that locality.
Emergencies growing out of the civil war
in the United States of Colombia demanded
of the Government, at the beginning of this
Administrai ion, the employment of mi
armed force to fulfill its guarantees under
the flirty-fifth article of the treaty of 184«.
In order to keep the transit open across the
Isthmus ot 1 auama.
Des rous ot exercising only the powers ex
preasly reserved to us by the treaty and
mindful of the rights of Colombia, the forces
sent to the isthmus were Instructed to con
line theft action to "positively and eflica
olously" preventing the transit and its «to
oessories from belhg "Interrupted or einhâr
rassert " The execution of this delicate and
Xesponalblo task necessarily Involved police
control where the local authority Was tem
porarlly powerless.but always in aid of the
sovereignty of Colombia. The prompt and
successful fulfillment of Us duty by this Gov- L
- . r, appreciated by the Gov
Crnment of Colomb a, and has been followed
by expression of its satistaetlon. Ulgh
praise Is due to tlio offloers and men on
gaged in this service. The restoration of
pouo- on the lathinue by the re-estab lsh
ment of the constituted Government there
being thus accomplished, the forces of the
United States were withdrawn.
The Colombian Government has expressed
Its willingness tv negotiate conventions for
the adjusimont by arbitration of claims by
foreign citizen, arising out of the destruc
tlon ot the city of Asplnwall by the lnsurree
tionary r roes.
The inter-et of the United States In a prac
tlcable transit for ships across the strip of
land separating the Atlantio fromtbe Paeiac
has bee» repeatedly manifested during tho
last half century. My immediate predeces
cansed to be negotiated with Nicaragua
a treaty for the construction bv and at the
sole cost of the United States of a canal
through the Nicaraguan territory, and laid lt
befotc the Senate, but pending the action of
that body thereon withdrew the treaty for
re examination. Attentive consideration of
Its provisions leads me to withhold It from
resubmission to the senate. •
Maintaining, as I do, the tenets of a line of
precedents from Washington's day whioh
proscribe entangling alliances with foreign
States, I do not favor a polloy of acqulsl

incorporation of remote Interests with our

organic, and we must be conscious of that

THE TEHUANTEPEC ROUTE
is declared by engineers of the highest re
pute and by competent scientists to afford
an entirely practicable transit for vessols
and cargoes by means of a ship railway from
the At>antlc to the Pacific. Tue obvious ad
vantages of such a route, if feasible, over
remote from the axial lines of
traffic between Kurtfpe and. the Pacific, und
particularly between thé Vdïléy of the Mis
sissippi and the western coast of NOTt.h and
South America, are deserving of considera
tion. Whatever highway may be construct
ed across thé batrier dividing the two great
est maritime areas of tho world, must be for
the world'- benefit—a trust for mankind tobe
removed from the charge of domination by
any single power, nor became a point of in
vitation for hostilities Or a prize for warlike
ambition. An engagement combining the
construction, ownership aifd operation of
such a work by this Government, with
offensive and defensive alliance for its pro
tection With the foreign State, whose rd-*
sponslbtlftles and rights
in my judgment, inconsistent with snch dedi
cation to universal and nôutral use, and
would, moreover, entail measure's for its
realization beyond the scope of our Na
tional politics or present means.
The lapse of years has abundantly
firmed the wisdom and foresight of
earlier administrations which, long beforê
the conditions of maritime intercourse were
changed and enlarged by the progress of
the age, proclaimed the vital need of Inter
oceaiiic transit across the American Isthmus
and consecrated in advowee to the common
use of mankind by theft' positive declara

TOWARD 8UCH A REALIZATION
the efforts of my administration will bo ap
plied, ever bearing In mind the principles
on which It iriust rest, and which were de
clared in no uncertain tones by Mr. Ca98,
who, while Secretary of state, ini 1858
nounced that "whatthe United States Wants
in Central America, next to the happiness
of its people, is tho necurlty and neutrality
of the inter-oceanlo routes which lead
through it."
The construction of three transcontinental
lines of railway, all in successful operation,
wholly within our territory and uniting the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, has been
comnanled by results of & most interesting
and impressive nature, and has created new
conditions, not in the routes of commerce
only, but in political geography,which pow
erfully affect our relations toward and nec
essarily increase our interest in any trans
isthmian route which may be opened and
employed for the ends of peace and traffic,
or in other contingencies for uses inimical
to both.
Transportation
is a factor in the cost of conimoditlesScdrc#
ly second to that of their prbdrictlorri, âne!
welahs as heavily upon their consumer. Our
existence already has proven the great Im
portance of having the competition between
mud carriage and water carriage fully devel
oped. each âctlng as protection to the publio
against the tendencies of monopoly, which
ip inherent in the consolidation of wealth'
and power in the hands of vast corpora
tions. These suggestions may serve to em
phasize what I have already said
score of the necessity of a neutralization of
any inter-oceanic transit, and this
be accomplished by making the
route open to all nations and subject to the
ambitions and warlike necessities of none.
Tho drawings and report of a recent survey
of the Nicaragua Canal route made by Chief
Engineer Menocal will be communicated for

tlie power of this Government should be
exited to maintain the amplest g >od

should be insisted dti. Every effort lias be m

Uvea of China in their investigation eff tliv*o

traceable to the lawlessness of men not cill

petition with Chinese laborers. Race preju
dice is the chief factor In originating these
disturbances, and it exists in a large part of
our domain, jeopardizing our domesdc
peace and the good relationship We strive to
maintain with China. The admitted right of H
Government to prevent tlie Influx of elements
hostile to Its Internal peace and security
may not be questioned even where there Is
no treaty stipulation on the subject That
tlie exclusion of Chinese labor is demanded
