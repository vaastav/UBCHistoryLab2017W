A Etct5T Washington special to the Boa

of Indiana, who is a close friend of Hen-
dricka, eaya tLe story that a coolnesi eiistei
between Cleveland and Ilendricka, on a
Count of a disposition on the part of the
latter to be dictatorial in matters relating to
the policy of the new administration, it
without any foundation in fact. He ears
that Hendricks proffered no eaestiona to
the rresideat-e'ect, and will not make any
unless his opinion ehould be asked. 'No
man,' says llolmao, 'better knows the rela
tions of a Vice Trepidant to the President,
and he will never ask that thia or that ap
pointment be made or policy adopted unless
Mr. Cleveland asks his opinion on the sab

no desire to dictate abont anything. Dar

Tilden did not ask for an expression of his

I Jo. Thomas A. Hendricks and wife re

Cleveland and Hendricks. He was with

formation of Cabinets and future policies
formed no part of the conversation, which
waa simply Informal and one of mutual con
gratulation and kindly greeting. The East

A ROYAL PAIS.
Two very royal looking birds arrived at
this oce yesterday a rooeter and a turkey;
the one emblematic of a victorious Democ
racy, and the other suggesting that the time
had come to give thanks for the recent tri
umph. The donor is our gcoi
friend W. B. Miller, a Btalwart
Democrat in principle and physique.
He believes in big things, big roosters, big
turkeys, big Democratic victories; therefore
we were not surprised to find that the tur
iey weighed twenty-four pounds. The
rooster, too, is a noble looking bird, but as
his value lies In announcing Democratic vic
tories we did not balance him against iron
weights. Mr. Miller says when Blaine waa
claiming New York and two Southern States
the turkey winked his eye and disdalnf ally
exclaimed "peet;" He was satisfied then
that it waa a Republican lie.
IT WAS BLAINE.
Hon. Richard T. Merrick, of Washington
City, eaya it waa Blaine wno compelled the
Republican committee to make the claim of
?ew York after the real result was known.
He was formally notified by the committee
lhat New York had gone for Cleveland, and
xie telegraphed back directing them to claim
the State, Why, saya Merrick, I met
Don Cameron at the PoetwfLce a few
laje ago. He and I are good friend?,
and we naturally talked of the elec
tion. He admitted that Cleveland waa
elected, and" I said: "Don, why don't yoa
put a stop to thia foolish claim that New
York baa gone for Blaine?" He replied: ,I
"wish I could, but I can not. Blaine ia be
hind the committee and forcing them to this
course. Ha wants to pom aj a mat tyr, that
lie may secure the nomination four years
hence," "Nrw,H Mr. Merrick added,
"Blaine waa willing to paralyze the besinees
Of this country, at a loss of millions to busi
ness men, to gratify his own ambition."
CONKLINO AND THS DEMOCRATS.
There ia not a more corxsplououa object of
Republican hostility In the country to-day
than Mr. Conkllng, and the phenomenon it
ia Impossible to explain exoept on the
grounds of bis sterling Integrity. His pub
lic life from the beginning to the end of a
long career baa been one of singular purity
as well as force. "Though I may frequent

Hi. Hendricks, in a conversation relating to
him two years ago, "I never

pre'ering the poverty of a church mouse to
iortuce achieved by methods so corrupt as
those leadina to the defeat of Blaine and
other leaders, now apparently canonized in
the Republican heart "Mr. Cenkilng can
not retire from public Ufa," said Mr. Julian,
.lately, "and his only place of nsef olness will
be in the Democratic party. That ultl-

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Every reader of this state raper, though
perhaps disagreeing with some of the eug
gfstiocs, will form a favorable impression of
its anther. There ia a wholesome breadth
about the message aa a whole, and the dis
agreement: that it is li-elj to quicken
merely attests that among those who have
the lest Interests of the country at heart,
are
"Ifany men of many minds.'
One reccoinmendation that will meet with
a elow response is that the coinage of silver
be suspended. That this metal Is one of our
meet valc&ble product) toems to be
fixed in the public mind, and
no argument that Las yet, or will
likely I? adopted, that can prevail
against its issuance as a circulating medium.
The country will not soon repeat the exper
iment of legisiatlng against the interest of
of cne of her principal industries. While
doubting neither the candor nor the patriot
ism of h'r. Arthur, Congress in
all human probability, will take a
widely different view of the matter.
The suggestion that larger and ampler scope
be riven the diplomatic and consular ser
vice will be heurtily approved by those who
have made the subject a study and familiar
ized themselves with the depressing in
ilaenee of the present system.
For the want of rank, perhaps
more than authority, aa oScer representing
tbls country would stand second at a for
eign court to an agent commissioned
with no more power from the Gov
era merit of Belgium. The efficiency
of the American consular and diplomatic
service ba3 long been impaired, to the
great embarrassment of the country for want
of rank. The recommendation to abolish
all excise tariffs except those relating to dis
tilled spirits will meet with some opposition.
for the reason that tobacco is not Included.
Though the tar on distilled epirita alone
might furnish sufficient revenue to defray
the expense of Government, economically
administered, there is a feeling or sentiment
extant that tobacco, being so especially an
article of luxury, should bear a public bur
den. Even the question of avoiding rev
enue will hardly reconcile the popular mind
to the idea that wisdom would put tobacco
on the free list.
That our foreign trade should be increased,
all, It is reasonable to suppose, or acrreed.
and the President's suggestion of a commis
sion to solve the problem aa to the best
method will certainly be approved. Also
hia suggestions aa to a more secure coast
defense and every measure tending to
facilitate the interchange of American pro
ducts with foreign Nations, and the opening
of new markets to our commerce, will cer
tainly meet with no discouragement.
The President joina the Secretary of the
Interior in advising the repeal of the Pre
emption law, which will not be accepted
without the weightiest reasons are advanced.
That law having solved the problem
of settling the frontier, and having worked
admirably for the last century, will likely
endure while a public domain remains to
the Government A statute fixing a pun
ishment equal to the enormity of the crime
against the country that results from its
misinterpretation or abuse would Cad
readier indorsement
The pledge made by the Republican party
to extinguish the crime of polygamy before
it waa allowed in . 1SGO, to assume
the responsibility of government, might
arouse a sense of humor if
printed in parallel columns with
Preeident Arthur's grave discussion of the
Utah question. Where the Edmunds bill
failed, what policy will succeed? is an inter
cgation now confronting the American
statesman. Mormonlam, which must go,
the message re min des us, has not as yet
gone.
SOFT PLACES UNDER TUB FLAO.
Keep your coat on, Mr. Republican. The
disgraceful scramble for office that charac
terized your party, when It came into power,
it will be impossible for the Democrats to
repeat In 185. From the moment that the
returns indicated the election of Mr. Lin
coin, that gentleman was constantly be
sieged by spoil hunters. Every political
road led to Springfield, HL Artemus Ward
made the Preeident say in accents of despair:
"They come to me from the East, from the
West, from the North, from ths South, from
the sky (as an enthusiastio constituent
dropped down the chimney), and from the
bowels of ths earth, (aa another bounced np
through ft cellar door). The New York
Herald and several other Metropolitan papers
sent correa-ondenta to the home of the Pres
idenielect, and the story of how he wm Im
portuned for place humiliated the whole
country.
The first work, after the party took pos
session of the Government, continuing for
something more than a month, wis to parcel
out the offices, strictly on ths grounds of
party service. NeTer in the history of this
Republic did an administration proceed
with more fidelity to the theory that, "to the
victor belong the SDOlla." Occasionally
some displaced Democratic Postmaster, with
his back up, spoke of the policy in terms uu
complimentary, but he was promptly spotted
as a rebel. No wheel of the Government
moved toward the restoration of the Union
until the Federal organization throughout
the Northern States was such as to facilitate
party clrcasalooritlon. A war was impend
ing; that fact was felt by the whole Natlea
n Its ben es, and because of that, a manifes
tation of greed never before nor since ap
peared so obscene.
The opposition jsarnalist of ths period
was, to be sure, aublimely disgusted, at the
spectacle, and chronicled his criticism in
rhetorical carbonic-acid gas, bat without
effect, on the hanger or thirst of the average
Republican office seeker. The element in
human nature that longs for toft places
under the flag, it is ratsonable to sappaje, is
.boat the same without regard to party
affiliation; but the dogs laagh when a Re
publican editor, who is alio a Federal office
holder. Inveighs against a Democrat wboee
only crime is the prompting! ef a kindred
Impulse.
HOW IT LOOKS AT THIS NATIONAL
CAPITAL.
When the campaign waa over we expected
that the defeated party would subside grace
fully and retreat In good order. For the
meet part thia has been done by the rank
and file c the Republican party, but its
newspapers and correspondents seem to have
entered upon a new campaign of miechlei
makicg and false statement A Washington
special to the Pittsburg Post eays that the
Republican pre38 seems to be making des
perate efforts to commit Cleveland to the
retention of the rascals. Some ot the able
correspondents in Washington are sending
oat reports to the effect that Democrats In
CoDgrea f tvor such a policy. A New York
correspondent has gone 80 far as to
state that Cleveland quarreled with
Hendricks upon the htter' s visit to Albany
on accoant of the Brooklyn speech. Noth
ing could be farther from the truth than the
impression intended to be conveyed cy all
this writing. The Democrats In Washing
ton, to a man, expect Cleveland tobe a Dem
ocratic President who will surround himself
by a Democratic Cabinet and weleoma Dem
ecrats into every branch of the public ser
vice. Any other theory would be absurd.
The Democrats have been working for twenty
years to regain possession of the Government,
and will not be content with a barren vic
tory now.
In regard to the regulations of the
civil service protecting anybody from
aiem'ssai, ino wasmnf;ton corre
spondent of the Poet says that
both Senator Pendleton, the author of the
reform, and CommlEsioner Thoman say that
any clerk coming under the provisions of
the law may be discharged at will without
even a charce being preferred. Some of
these men were notorious for their violation.
during the campaign, of the law, the protec
tion of which they now invoke. Should
they be discharged they can enter no com
plaint, and the men who put them out will
not be violators of the law. They will
simply get the punishment due to their
offenses. There ate enoarh of this sort
who ought to go, and faithful, efficient,
attentive clerks will be left at their desks.
The places of those who are dismissed will
be fired by the Civil Service Commission,
and the Democrats will at least stand an
equal chance of entering the public service
after having seen the door closed In their
face for a sccre of years. While it is neces
sary to break np the department rings and
seek greater honesty and better business
methods, it will also be absolutely essential
to change the entire public service of the
South era Slates. Northern people have no
idea of the character of the scalawags and
scamps who infest every branch of the Fed
eral service of the South, They are rarely,
if ever, gentlemen; they are generally la
efficient and often dishonest. They spend
their time in politics and in stirring up race
prejudice. The Southern men demand
that these fellows shall give place
and quickly, too, to a better class of citiz-ns,
and to men who have tome interest in the
welfare of the people among whom they
represent the Government interests. Mr.
Cleveland proposes to gite the country a
business administration, but it is a mistake
to assume that he will not. other things be
ing equal, prefer Democrats to Republicans.
He does not propose to indorse the Eepubli
can slander that Democrats are not fit to
govern or conduct public alLiIrs, and this is
the way that Cleveland's coming policy is
regarded by both Democrats and Republi
cans at the capital, aside from those whose
only interest it is to keep the trust they have
already betrayed.

ANOTUKK NATIONAL. UANK FAILURE.
Freoident Klag Accepts a Grain Dealer's
Paper Contrary to ihe Orders of the
Itank Directors With tne Usual BesnlU
MiDPLETowff, N. Y Nov. 23. The Middle
town National Bank has failed. Its doors
tioecd this morning. The failure waa caused
by President Thomas King, who accepted
large drafts from Benjamin D. Brown, a
grain dealer of Indianapolis and Barling
ton, without security. Brown has made an
assignment. The bank's capital ia $200,000;
surplus, ? 115,000. The extent of the loss ia
not known yet definitely. The depositors
will lose nothing. President King takes all
tbe blame on himself. His recent advances
were made without the knowledge of other
officers and directors. The Bank Examiner

but the latter is in no way involved and will

Newbceo, N. Y., Nov. 28. The Dews of
the Mlddletown bank failure caused some
excitement in the eastern part of Orange
County. Newburg banks are not much af
fected by the failure. The Middletown in
stitution owed one of them $3,000, which
will probably be paid. Amone the direct
ors of the suspended bank are United States
Senator Van Wyck, of Nebraska, formerly
of this county.
Mi delicto wk, N. Y., Nov. 2s. Bank Ex
aminer Georg T. May, of Washington, is
now in possession of tue Middletown Na

blame on himself. In July last the direct

beyed the instructions and broke tne bank.
The record of the acceptance of Brown's
drafts on the bank were kept by King m
a book in bis possession, and concealed from
tbe other officers. Bo far as known, no
more than $200,000 of such acceptances are
out. It is the opinion of those beat in
formed that tbe entire capital and surplus
will be wiped ont. The run on the Savings
Bank here drew $20 000. to-day. The bank ia
solvent and ready for any emergency.

Hooking Valley kStrlke About Ended.
CoLCMBca. O.. Nov. 2S. By persistent ef
forts the local authorities of Hocking,
Athens and Perry Counties, aided by the of
ficera of the Columbus, Hocking Valley and
Toledo Road, the Ohio Coal Exchange and
syndicate operators, the indicationa are that
the strike, which has been in progress in the
Hocking Valley for the last six months, will
soon end. Indictments have been found
against more than twenty intimidators, who
made the assault on Murray City November
5, and all but three or four have been lodged
n jail. Their triala will begin next week.
The detectives expect soon t make new de
velopments and secure the arrest of a still
larger number of Btriking miners who took
pert in tbe burning of the bridge ef the
Hocking Valley Road. It has been decided
by the officers to proeecnta these under the
Conspiracy act passed by Congress some
twenty yeara ago. President Oreene, of the
Hocking Valley, ia of the opinion there will
be more intimidation, as the arrests will be
pushed to the farthest extent The three
bridges burned will be ready for trains to
pan to-morrow, when three additional
mlL ill be opened. The output it is
thought, will soon reach the point it waa be
fore the strike began, and it is thought a
large number of the old miners will return
to work December 1, when they learn they
will be protected from the lawless element.
The companies, however, aay they will not
discharge any new miners to give place to
the old. All the mines in the Valley are
now being operated at fifty cents per ton.
Permanent.
There are medicines which give only tem
porary relief and then leave the sufferer
worse ofT than before, especially in cases of
dyspepsia. Bemember that thia is not the
way with Brown's Iron Blttera. Bee what
Mr. J, M. Gaines, of Gaines, S. 0., says
about this prince of tonics: "My wife has
been greatly benefited by it; she had been
troubled with dyspepsia for years, and now
1 believe she is permanently cored." Itaiso

No paper in the country has more reason
for gratification than the Indianapolis Sen
tinel, which has come to be thoroughly ad
vtrtibed. Oat ot other leading papers which
Jiubliehed some account of Candidate
llaine'a matrimonial history, it was selected
aa tbe one to be made an example of. Tbe
purpose undoubtedly waa to intimidate and
break down the paper, and demoralise the
Democratic party of that State at the same
time. But the manaeer, Mr. 8hoemaker,
waa not made of that kind of material. He
at once took measures to prepare for defence,
and had the temerity to publish, from timj
to time, scrape of evidence to show there
waa no libel, and to draw from the plaintiff
himself soma unpleasant confessions. Ilia
