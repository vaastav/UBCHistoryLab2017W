The Austrian post office is to try a
“telegram card," on which a person
writes a message and posts in the
usual way, hut the post office telegraphs
the contents, which are delivered to
the address by tlie postman. The plan
is a combination of post and telogrdpli,
and seems useful as having a cost and
speed intermediate between post aud
telegraph.
THERE is at present under construc
tion an electric machine which will ba

when you drop your nickel in the slot

There will be four of those on each of
the larger stations. The reason why
this system has been adopted by tlie
railroad trustees is to do away with
the expense of having an agent on

POSTAL AFFAIRS.
Postmaster General Smith in ills An
nual Report Wonts Abuse of Sec
ond-Class Privileges Stopped.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The annual report
of Postmaster General Charles Emory
Smith Is made public. Its chief feature is
a plea for congressional action to stop the
abuse of second-class mail privileges,
which, he says, results in an annual waste
of upwards of $20,000,000. The financial ex
hibit for the fiscal year shows total ex
penditures of $101,632,161 and total receipts
of $95,021,384, the deficiency being $2,422,747
less than last year.
"The benefits accruing from the exten
s'jii of postal facilities to the rural com
munities may bo summarized as follows:
Increased postal receipts, making many
of the new deliveries almost immediately
self-supporting; enhancement of the value
of farm lands reached by this service and
better prices obtained for farm products
through, more direct communication with
the markets and prompter information of
their state; improved means of travel,
some hundreds of miles of country road-,
especially In the western states, having
been graded specifically in order to obtain
rural delivery; higher educational influ
ences, broader circulation of the means of
public intelligence and closer dally con
tact with the great world of activity ex
tended to the homes of heretofore Isolated
rural communities.”

Manila, Dec. 5.—A dispatch from Dr,g

those from Santa Cruz says that Gen.
Young hopes to find Aguinaldo in Ben
guet mountain pass and to capture him
there. Both entrances to Benguet are
fortified. Two troops of the Third cav
alry will reenforce Gen. Young in the
pass.
The inhabitants of Santa Cruz and
of other towns through which the
Americans passed say that Aguinaldo
and his entire refugee army have gone
into the mountains eastward since the
Oregon, Samar and Callao attacked
Vigan and landed a force there.

Manila. Dec. 5. Aguinaldo’s mother,
who was captured by Mnj. Cronin with
the little son of the insurgent leader
and brought to Manila by order of Gen.
Otis, said in an interview:
"I desire nothing- but that peace may at
once be secured. I am glad from the bot
tom of my heart that the Insurrection Is
near its end. Aguinaldo is not sufficiently
civilized to keep from being misled by the
bad counsel of his ministers and the mem
bers of the Filipino congress. A majority
of those about him have constantly de
clared for war. Such a course ha? always
been contrary to Aguinaldo’s best judg
ment, but he was weak enough to allow
them to Induce him to fight. That is why
I say he is not sufficiently civilized,”

Ntw York, Dec. 6.—A special cable

World' rays that Filipinos there an

States.

learn that they will be well treated.
It is impossible to get the insur
gents to fight. They are retreating to
the mountains and no more organized
resistance is expected. The artillery
wagon mules are being used for pack
ing. Water buffaloes are also being
used for this purpose. Gen. Hughes

REVIEW OF ARMY WORK.
Secretary of War Hoot Favor* a
Lnrxer Military Force nn/l >l.ikn
Other Important Suggestion*.
Washington, Dec. 2.—The annual report
of Elihu Root, secretary of war. was made
public Friday. The first half Is devoted to
the operation of the army in the Philip
pines, Cuba and Porto Rico. The report
gives a full history of the military opera
tions In the Philippines from August 12,
1898, up to the present time. An impor
tant feature of the report is a comprehen
sive outline of a plan of government for
Porto Rico.
The form of insular government proposed
provides for the appointment of i governor
by the president, to be confirmed by the
senate: the chief officers of state customary
under our system, and a legislative council
to be composed of the chief officers of state
and a minority selected from the people of
the Island by the president. All acts of the
council are to be subject to the veto power
of the governor and to be passed over the
veto by a two-thirds vote. No law is to
become effective until it has remained with
out this approval for 30 days after its pres
entation to congress or the president. It is
suggested that voting right should be lim
ited to those who read and write or who
own a small amount of property.
The report cites in brief the history of the
military operations in the Phllipplßes,
Porto Rico and C*uba during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1899. Relief work in all three
places is dilated upon. The transport serv
ice, it is stated, includes 51 steam trans
ports, with a saving in work done over or
dinary commercial rates of $501,000. The re
moval of the dead from Cuba and similar
work contemplated from the Philippines is
touched upon.
An increased and reorganized regular
army, with many new and novel features
in the system involved, is earnestly recom
mended. Radical changes, which contem
plate the betterment of the service in
every department are proposed. The
changes in the army organization and the
increase proposed are in the first Instance
specified particularly, while in the second
no definite statement is made except as
to artillery. The present artillery force is
recommended to be increased five times its
present strength. The increase in officers
and enlisted men is to be sufficient to man
the equipment in the seacoast fortifica
tions, besides providing for the other
branches of the service.
The regular army now number? 61,999 en
listed men and 2,248 officers, making a total
of 64,247, and a volunteer force numbering
30,050 enlisted men and 1,524 officers, making
a total of 34,574. The deaths from all causes,
including casualties in action, for the 14
months from May, 1898, to June, 1899, in
clusive, were 6,619. The deaths from disease
from all causes were at an annual death
rate of but 25.68 per ‘housand.
Estimates of the cost of maintenance for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, are as
follows:
Civil establishment $1,967,706
Support of the army and military
academy 87,015,290
Fortifications and river and har
bor improvements 30.499,576
Miscellaneous 5,196.799
A net deficiency appropriation of $i6,000,-
000 is asked for.

For the Grave.
A solicitor in a Georgia court is respon
sible for the following: He overheard a.
conversation between his cook and a nurse,,
who were discussing a recent funeral of a
member of their race, at which there had
been a great profusion of flowers. The nurse
said: “When I die, don’t plant no flower*
on my grave, but plant a good old water
melon vine; and when it gets ripe you come
dar, and don’t you eat it. but jes’ bus’ it
on de grave and let an d good old juice dribble
down through de ground.”—Youth’s Com
panion.
Dealnes* Cannot Be Cured
by local applications, as they cannot reach
the diseased portion of the ear. There is
only one way to cure deafness, and that is
by constitutional remedies. Deafness is
caused by an inflamed condition of the mu
cous lining of the Eustachian Tube. When
this tube gets inflamed you have a rumbling
sound or imperfect hearing, and when it is
entirely closed deafness is the result, and
unless the inflammation can be taken out
and this tube restored to its normal con
dition, hearing will be destroyed forever;
nine cases of of ten are caused by catarrh,,
which is nothing but an inflamed condition,
of the mucous surfaces.
We will give One Hundred Dollars for any
case of Deafness (caused by catarrh that
cannot be cured by Hall's Catarrh Cure.
