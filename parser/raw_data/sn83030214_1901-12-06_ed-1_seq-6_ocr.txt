HILL WOSTT HF.I'LY TO CRAVES.
William R. Hill, the chief engineer of the Aque

willing to make a reply to -he criticisms of Alfred
« 'raven, a division engineer of the rapid transit
system and former division engineer of the Aque
duct Commission, regarding the advised chai.ges
in construction at the Jerome Park Reservoir. The
report of the experts on the subject, Mr. Hill said,
had been referred to him by the Aquedu- t Com
mission, and he would make a formal statement
to the commission probably in ten days. In the
mean time, he said, he could not properly engage in
a controversy with any other engineer as to the
safety of core walls laid over quicksand as pan
of the reservoir construction.
"The fact Is ihat I have not made any recom-
Meadattoaa >>n :h»< subject yet." Mr. Hill said, "but
! asked the commission to refer the question ol

VBW-YOBK DAILY TRIBUNE. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 0. 1901.
! MISSION BOARDS BLAMED.
SHOULD SEND EPISCOPAL WORKERS TO
ROMAN CATHOLIC COUNTRIES.
tBT tki.k.;i:a-ii TO THK TRIBCNK.I
Rochester. X. V.. Dec. 5.-The second day of the
Episcopal General Missionary Conference was par
ticularly notable for two things. One was a severe
criticism of the present methods employed in the
Board of Missions and the other a bitter attack on
th< tendencj observable in some quarters to re
frain from sending Protestant Episcopal misslon
aries into Latin American countries where the
Roman Catholic Church has become established.
The Rev. Dr Henry W. Nelson discussed the
Board of Uiaalons. He said it has lost its powers
and dignity by being forced to give place in trien
nial conferences to doctrinal an.l legislative affairs
of the Church. Another grave objection was that
i, Bits In New-York behind closed doors, and gives
the impression that its operations are also secret.
•This idea of close corporation.- said Dr. Nelson.
"is tal to the interests of those bodies which
tome in the Church with the work of missions.
What we need above all things is solidanty-the
■ ffa< • menl of the unit in the life of our whole body,
Übieties teach us this. Team work wins to-day.
D- Nelson expressed his regret that the San
Francisco convention failed to adopt the proposed
change In the constitution of the Missionary Board.
which provides for a board made up of representa
tivea from every diocese and presided over by a
bishop chosen for that purpose. It would have an
executive committee of forty-live members, who
should be clothed with full power, even to the mat
ter of making missionary ■ppropriatiomi.
The Key. Dr W. Dudley Powers, general secre
tary of the American Church Missionary Society
handled the second topic mentioned above. He said
In part:
The Board of Missions haw f;».-ed the question
■u-.h. - a so-called Intorecclesiastical courtesy
M<s!ior>«s have held sway lor centuries. It was, s-aiu
f'.ur'.-'' V.' Sowthat Roman Catholic priests
V, i l.tel In th-w countries do not read our
; i.r'i pai.-r" and even if they should hear of
Ihis ntemSonTol -courtesy" to them they would
only smile.
This is considered as carrying the war Into the
camp of that clerical party which h«s been crlticis
i!ic the iction of the San Francisco Conference In
p mointin* Bishop Brent to the Philippines. That
BJshop present at the conference and to-m..irow
will give his own views on Ihe question. ■

Five Minutes
With BRIC-A-BRAC
Desiring to show you ths richest and newest joys-forever — things of
beauty — one of our exoerts tripped lightly to Austria and back. He made a
sort of postscript trip — five weeks. The results are here. Trophies of Bric-a-
Brae salute you.
Flight in the center of the enlarged Basement Art l^com with skyward
trumpet stands a winged victory. "Triumph" is writ large in face, figure
and action. Not a conventional "Winged Victory." Oh, no! It is of
Vienna Terra-Cotta, and the Art Nouveau has translated from the Art Antique
an old art thought. Chaste, graceful, exquisite, this figure is the voice of the
Art P<oom.
Vienna Terra-Cotta is principally sold in Paris. Other first-class collection!
of Pottery in Mew York have it on sale, but the chief group is here. A figure
of Night supports an eieccric light, the water-rose rests upon pond-lily leaves,
strange figures Straggle in curious waves, Beethoven's little bust has a frown of
genius on'the features of the face, while Mozart's has the peaceful calm of
perfect harmony. Vienna Terra-Cotta is the medium o£ expression for swirling
water and female figures. Beauty and power meet in many of the designs.
Teplitz has caught the Vienna spirit. In simple and '.ess pronounced
pieces this fine china-ware follows the Vienna clay. It would be quite useless
to catalogue either — this is merely a word of introduction.
Dainty and delicate are the miniatures on ivory and the enamels on copper
that have so hastily come from Paris to brighten this Christmas assembly. Of
the larger pieces— and all are small — there are no duplicates. Of the ename's,
the King of Rome, Indiscretion and the Farmer's Daughter are among the
more important. 0: the ivories, Katherine of Russia, Marie Antoinette,
Madame Recamier lead a most remarkable group of beauties.
Hasty and superficial glances will not cause this Bric-a-Brac to give up its
beauty to you. Five minutes for reading should or: multiplied by clever. to
even give catch glances into the cases and cabinets. And you'll be ever so
welcome if you only " come to look. '' Ra.~-
R^ich Veiour Jackets
For luxury, beauty and comfort, Velour offsrs the best substitute for seal
skin, besides being far more susceptible to a variety of effective treatment ia
combination with other rich materials — notably satin, appliqus and fur.
Some new Veiour Blouses and Jackets show superb effects of this nature.
Styles are, in some cases, modifications of the Eton jacket. One, in particular,
with front in blouse st/le, has an attractive " rippled "skirt, reaching to the hip.
Our Velour Jackets are all splendidly mads, and the material is so protected,
especially on the edges, as to give the maximum of possible wear. Ve'.our dv
Nord, with its Ion?, lustrous pile, is used in many of them, and gives wear equal
to the best of velvet. n

CHRISTMAS CANDIES!
Who doesn't remember the delight of the old Christmas mornings wr.en
we children burst open the door to the rich aroma of the freshly cat spruce and
the appetizing perfume of the Christmas candies hung so plentifully among the
presents?
Ah, those -were days!
But do any ot us forget that the remanc? is every whit as real to our chil
dren today ? f Will the Christmas tree b= plentifully laden with the sugared
sweets ? Will children 'and grown-ups have full and plenty of candy for this
most prosperous Christmas day ?
Plenty won't hurt them — if it's pure !
Do you know that some popular flavors and fascinating colorings are
barred from Wanamaker candies, because they are poisonous or injurious ?
Pure and innocent ingredients compose every bit of candy wj make, and
our factory is the most spotlessly clean place that work was ever done in.
Pure, clean, wholesome, most delicious, and fairly priced are Wanamaker
