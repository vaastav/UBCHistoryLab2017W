The Fargo Argus appears in a new
dress, and with sixty-live columns of ad
vertising, many of the advertisers an
nouncing their locations as established

the Argus exemplifies to a wonderful
degree the pluck and vim of the people
of the Phoenix city.
The authorities of Mexico have inter
dieted the sale of newspapers published
at El Paso, Tex., within the territory of
the republic. What harm they could do
it is difficult to see, as scarcely one in
ten average Urticans can read the
papers after they- have them. But
perhaps tire papers are used for gun
wadding, aud in that form are found to
be injurious to the public.
We do not know if the report that the
ways and means committee has ex
tended the date when the bill shall
take effect to June 1 is a fact or a fic
tion. If it is a fact, we have no hesita
tion in saying that it is a very serious
mistake, whether we regard it from the
point of mere policy or from the belter
one of right conduct. If it be true, we
trust to the political sagacity of the
house to change it.
•w
It takes very little to excite the
Colorado politician. A prominent Dem
ocratic lawyer of Denver has given it
as his opinion that there can bo no
obstacles in the way of women voting at
all elections in that state— a congres
sional election and a state election. The
United States government has nothing
to do with it. and the state has an abso
lute ris-ht to define the qualifications of
the people who shall elect her congress
men. It apparently ' makes no differ
ence to the people of the foothills that
the state and supreme courts have de
cided that this opinion is an error.
They are happy just the same, and will
be in a pleasant mood until they at
tempt to act in accordance with this
opinion, and find that the courts won't
permit it. '
The Woman's Indian association, re
cently in session at Washington, came
to the very sensible conclusion, after
mature investigation and deliberation,
that cur system of dealing with the red
men is not as much in need of reforma
tion as those employed by the govern
ment to carry out its policy. They have
found that nearly all tine- -abuses of
which the Indians complain are due to
he dishonesty of the agents, not to the
neglect of the government to make suit
able provision for the maintenance of its
wards. They therefore recommend to
the interior department that only men
of good moral character be appointed to
manage the affairs of the several agen
cies, and feel confident, as the general
public does, that if capacity and integ
rity are made necessary qualifications
for such rfficers much of the complaint
Will wholly cease. The ladies compli
ment the Democratic party upon having
first introduced the plan of permitting
the Indians to hold lands In severalty,
and think that thrs policy, if pursued in
the future, will lead to a vast improve
ment in the material condition and
moral welfare of the aborigines. -
With two such momentous matter
on Its hands as the tariff and the Ha
waiian affair, congress promises to be
kept pretty busy during the present
session, and there seems to be little
prospect for a final adjournment before
late in August. Both matters will come
up for consideration at the same time,
but which will have the precedence is
yet to be determined. It looks as if the
situation in Hawaii would be seized
upon by those having a grievance
against President Cleveland in order to
attack him. Prejudice will enter largely
into the discussion, and as there are no
precedents to govern the action of con
gress in such matters the debate will
doubtless take a wide range. As addi
tional light is shed upon the subject
Mr. Cleveland's course receives in
creased warrant of authority and jus
tice, and hence his opponents are en
deavoring to force the matter to an issue
as early as possible. But the president
lias no doubt fortified himself thor
oughly, and will be found in a good po
sition to resist attack. He is well ar
mored for the fray, and will not be the
first to cry "Hold, enough!" .

A SMOOTH DEAL..
When the question of aiding the un
employed was being agitated last fall
the president of the park t board asked
to have $50,C00 put into the tax levy for
the parks, so that that amount could be
anticipated from other funds and ex
pended for improvement.
It was depicted that at $1 per day a
great-work would be accomplished in
the parks. " ,-, V^- ;" .'•
; At the meeting of the • conference
committee yesterday, when a; little di
version of the park money was suggest
ed, the president explained that 513,000
had been used for the-; unemployed,
$10,000 for an j overdraft, and it would
require $23,0C0 to maintain the' parks
next year. Hence the fifty is gone.
Under cover of a charitable work, the
park board pays an ' overdraft and se
cures funds for next year's mainte
nance, while the unemployed get thir
teen out of their supposed fifty thou
sand dollars.
Josef is smooth:
THE NORTHERN PACIFIC.
As late as 1870 the only means of
transportation northwest of St. Paul, in
that vast region now known as the
Northern Pacific country, was the Red
river cart. There were no .settlements
for agricultural purposes west of Du
luth, nor iv the Red river valley, where
the lands were still covered by Indian
titles, and the hostile Sioux had un
molested sway from the Missouri to the
mountains. Indeed, as late as 1876 Cus
ter and his brave band marched to their
death from the frontier post situated
within five miles of what is now the
capital of North Dakota. -.v- -L.,
The country then almost unknown,
northwest and tributary to St. Paul,
has become the greatest grain-prod
"ing region on the face of the earth. In
every portion of the globe reached by
rail or water the products of its mills
are found on sale; and from the sup
posed barren plains and the bad lands
thousands of carloads of fat cattle are
annually shipped. Farms and ranges
have been opened, and towns, villages
and cities have sprung up, and frontier
settlements have grown into states.
The Twin Cities, the pride of all who
know and appreciate the Northwest,
have had greatness thrust upon them by
and through the development of this
great Northwest, resulting from the
railroad construction of the past twenty
years. They have been the great agen
cies tor development, leading tho way
to the prosperity which followed.
The Northern Pacific had its 'early
griefs, from which it partially recovered
and was pushed on to completion, so
far as connecting the lake and Pacific
ends of the line was concerned; but its
track required surfacing, its bridges
were temporary structures, the mount
am divisions required the construction
of expensive tunnels, it had no terminal
facilities, its credit was again ruined,
its stockholders clamoring and its bond
holders alarmed. -' S:V<
This was the condition of the North
ern Pacific when Thomas F. Oakes was
called into its service as vice president
and general manager in 1883, and
through his wise discretion it was then
kept out of the hands of a receiver.
Through his well-directed energies its
track was surfaced, its temporary
bridges replaced oy permanent struct
ures, and new ones built— that at Bis
marck costing $I,soo,ooo— splendid ter
minal facilities were provided at St.
Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, Superior
and Tacoma; tunnels were cut through
the mountain ranges, and other perma
nent improvements added. For these
purposes fully 515,000,000 was required,
but the credit, of the company, main
tained by his careful and conscientious
management, was sufficient for every
emergency. C- :^' r -
Branch lines reaching out toward and
into tributary regions added largely to
the business of the road and were neces
sary to the completion of its magnificent
system.
Then came another time of depres
sion. Business interests in every line
and in every part of the continent suf
fered. Some of the strongest financial
institutions failed. .Railroad interests
especially suffered, aud scores of lines
passed into the hands of receivers. The
Northern Pacific suffered with others.
There was the natural loss from the
prevailing conditions, and the further
loss resulting from the two newly es
tablished competing lines the Great
Northern and the Canadian Pacific—
both contending at all of its terminals
for through business. It is not surpris
ing that under these circumstances it
too, went into receivers' hands.
Mr. Oakes was wisely appointed one
of tbe receivers, but just now there is
pressure to displace him, but no
greater harm could come to this mag
nificent property than the accomplish
ment of this purpose. His management
has been careful, honest, popular; and
until the present fearful times came
upon the country there was no failure
to provide for any maturing obligation,
or anything essental to the good ot the
company or its patrons. He is popular
on the line, but has become especially
endeared to the people of the terminal
cities. He has listened courteously to
every interest claiming his attention,
and has justified every legitimate hope
that he would do the right thing at the
right time. <-""
His retention is decidedly in the in
terest of the property he represents, as
the parties interested will practically
and sorrowfully learn if he should be
displaced. - . '_'

FEDERAL ELECTION LAWS.
Senator Hill will endeavor to secure
action at an early day on the house bill
for the repeal of the federal election
laws, and there seems to be small doubt
of the passage of the measure before
the holiday recess. The Republican"
senators have announced that they will
not endeavor to delay action by obstruct
ive .tactics. They no doubt see that
these would be of no avail, as they
would ultimately be defeated, and would
render themselves subject to severe
criticism for delaying necessary legisla
tion if they should pursue the tactics of
the silver senators on the repeal of the
Sherman bill.
Opposition to the federal election
laws is not confined to the Democratic
party, nor should it be regarded as
a partisan question. It is true that
Democrats have been the chief suffer
ers from its enforcement thus far, for
the reason that the Republican party
has been in power, and has had control
of the appointment of the deputy mar
shals and supervisors of election. If it
chose to do so, the present Democratic
administration could exercise the pow
ers conferred by the act to oppress and
disfranchise Republican voters, as pre
vious administrations have used the law
to the injury of the Democratic party.
But. the Democrats have no such de
sire. They are firm believers in the
ability of the people to decide who shall
be the rulers of the nation, and, freed
from all obstructive laws, they are con
fident that the people will decide wisely.
It -has been their contention from the
first that the election laws were uncon
stitutional, and they do not propose to
stultify themselves by employing : un
lawful means to perpetuate their own
power. -- '
It has "ever been the policy of the
THE SAINT :; TATJL -DAILY GLOBE: ■ WEDNESDAY MORNING, • DECEMBER^ 13, ; J893.
Democratic party to afford to every cltr-
zeu the fullest liberty of opinion'- arid ■
suffrage. l . The right to vote on all ques
tions of public concern is guaranteed by
the constitution, and the agents l of any
party who attempt to interfere with that
privilege are guilty -of a high crime
against the government and against
free institutions. The federal, election
law was conceived in a spirit of hostil
ity to universal suffrage, and the powers
It conferred have been . exercised with ;
the deliberate purpose of disfranchising
hundreds of thousands of our citizens,
lii all the large cities the federal super
visors have undertaken the privilege of
deciding ": as ■to the qualifications "of
electors— a power belonging exclusively
to the judicial officers of the govern
ment. They have ''-: threatened . Demo
crats with arrest, although '.' knowing
them to be duly -qualified electors,
and in; New York, Brooklyn, Chicago
and other cities . have beeri guilty
of the most flagrant abuses of power.
Under the direction of John: I. Daven
port more than 5.000 arrests were made
en the last presidential election day, the
pretense being that the parties so ar
rested were about to vote in violation of
law. When the cases came to trial all
were dismissed on Davenport's ■ own
motion save two; and these, after a full
hearing, were discharged by the court.
By these tactics Davenport reduced the
Democratic majority (a New York, but
fortunately failed in his purpose, of
giving the state to the -Republican can
didates.
This outrageous relic of oppression
and political intolerance should be ob
literated from the statute books, and
Senator Hill will deserve well of the
country if he shall succeed in securing
its repeal. If the Republicans shall
succeed in preventing the repeal, they
should be treated to a liberal dose of
their own medicine. If they shall be
made to feel its oppressiveness by hav
ing their voters hustled -to prison on
election day at the caprice- of an irre
sponsible official clothed in a little brief
authority, they may learn where the
shoe pinches. The pretense that the
law is necessary in order to secure fair
and free elections is absurd and unwar
ranted by the facts. The Democrats
are as deeply concerned in the effort in
that direction as the Republicans, and
Will commit no act whereby the right of
every qualified citizen to cast a vote
shall be abridged, or by means of which
any person not legally entitled to the
privilege shall be permitted to exercise
it.
SENATOR HOAR IMPATIENT.
Senator Hoar seems ambitious of dis
tinction as a common scold. On Mon
day he took occasion to offer in the sen
ate a resolution calling upon the presi
dent for information relative to his ac
tion concerning affairs in Hawaii. He
commented on the fact that the informa
tion communicated by the president to
certain senators unicr the seal of confi
dence had been freely given out to.the
representatives of four newspapers
known to be zealous, thoroughgoing, he
had almost said unscrupulous, support
ers of the administration. If that alle
gation were true, it seemed to him as
gross a violation of the constitution of
the United States as was ever charged
upon or imputed to any public official.
It was not necessary to say to the sen
ate or the administration people that au
attempt to usurp the power of appoint
ing or commissioning such an officer
without the consent of the senate was
an attempt to usurp all the diplomatic
relations of the government.
Senator Hoar no doubt understands
full well that the president cannot be
held legally or morally responsible for
the acts of the senators to whom he may
have communicated secrets -of state.
They are amenable to censure, not he.
If they have violated confidence, ex
pressed or implied, the senate has the
remedy in its bauds, but whatever of
blame exists rests upon the members of
that body, and the president must be
held blameless. . *%>.i'-Vv. '^i
. But the public will look with extreme
leniency upon the offense ot the senators
who gave out the facts regarding which
the controversy rose. The senate has
many exceedingly absurd- rules, and
among them is the rule requiring all
matters considered In executive session
to be kept from the public, no matter
how deep an interest there may be in
the subject. This Hawaiian affair is one
in which every citizen is concerned. All
the facts bearing upon it were necessary
to a perfect understanding of the issues
involved. The report of Paramount
Commissioner Blount was especially im
portant, and. as soon as it was given to
the senate, ought to have received the
widest publicity. But this could not be
permitted; the traditions of the ancient
and self-important body of old women
would not permit such a concession to
the public demand. It is not pretended
that the publication of the report would
work injury to any of the parties in
interest. 'On- the contrary, a useful
purpose would be served by the pub
lication, for by its means . public senti
ment could be .sounded and much in
formation elicited from various sources
that would be of great value, to the
senate In coming to a determination of
the case. The public obtained access
to a portion of the evidence submitted,
but is yet in ignorance as to many
points essential to a complete and in
telligent judgment. This information
will probably be forthcoming in the
president's message now daily expected,
but it might have been available to a
great extent had it not been for the
secrecy enjoined by the senate rules.
Senator Hoar's impatience would be
regarded as natural, were it not for the
partisan malignity by which It is mani
festly inspired, for the public at large
is as impatient as he. But the public
does not scold, as does the Massachu
setts man. The president has prom
ised to lay all documents bearing upon
the subject before congress, and is bus
ily at work collating and arranging
them. It is earnestly to be hoped that
he will not send the . message to the
senate in executive session, to be with
held by it as long as its members choose
from the public view. The long-con
tinued-uncertainty that surrounds the
question should be dissipated, and in
sending his message to congress the
president will no doubt consider the
rights of the mass of the people, as well
as those of the old women who compose
the senate of the United States. ....

has reached Helena from the west, and
is coming our way. The cold wave,
which gave Bismarck 22 below zero will

Many ; Laborers Do Not Care to
j i; Wait for tho Next World.
\ Chicago, Dec. , 12.— r delegates to
the convention of the American Federa
.iron of Labor began today's session by
announcing that during their stay in
Chicago they will not attend theaters;
where non-union stage" workers are em
ployed. A protest had. been sent to the
federation complaining that managers
of four theaters here employ non-union
men, and on this the action was taken.
There was considerable . discussion over
a proposition to "print 20,000 copies of
the '-.■; speech ; delivered yesterday ;by
Henry D. Lioyd. It was ; finally de
cided to have the pamphlet published
before : , the : convention adjourns."-: A
delegate moved to allow Gov. Altgeld
to appear and address the convention,
but was ruled out of order by President
Gompers. A proposition to request
Editor Stead to address, the delegates
was also dropped, and David Labln, an
economist from San Francisco, was
called upon for a speech. A delegation
of Chicago ministers was E admitted to
the convention, and Dr. D. H. Thomas
made an address, in which he assured
the delegates that he. and bis fellow
clergymen are in - sympathy with the
federation and Its sentiment. ? .
' President Gompers thanked the min
isters for their presence, and said: "Too
.'long has the ministry not talked to the
iworkingmau but down to him, attire
same time s underestimating his force of
character and nobility. We go down
among the great army of the unwashed
and make its followers appreciate their
honor and their rights. As our work is
better understood we will have the co
operation of all mankind. We want lo
go to heaven, but we want vto have a
little of heaven down here."
A communication was received from
the Retail Clerks' National Protective as
sociation reciting that several thousand
retail . clerks j are now In Chicago with
out employment owing to the "custom
of keeping stores open until far into the
i night." A resolution attached was
adopted calling upon the retail mer
chants of Chicago to adopt a universal
hour for closing, both in the interest of
humanity and commerce. It was fur
ther resolved that the delegates will not
: make any purchases at stores where
; non-uniou labor is employed. A Chl
ago delegate stirred up a lively wrangle
by again introducing a resolution re
questing Gov. Altgeld to address the
: meeting. It was finally carried arte a
hot debate and the meeting adjourned.

put to him were ex-parte testlmony.and
have been published, and the entire bal
ance of the long and seemingly friendly
conversation," which could throw a flood
of light on the question, has been evi
dently suppressed.
The fact has ; been commented upon
here quite strongly that one or two let

friends here asking them not to judge
Mr. Blount aud his adverse report too
severely, as he was iv no way to blame

has resulted since the news arrived of
President Cleveland's unfriendly atti

generally has stagnated. Investments

so long as the present crisis and polit
ical excitment continue. On request
of the government the libel suits of ,0.
B. Wilson against W. G. Smith, editor
of the Star, have gone over until the
February term of court. The. re
quest for a continuance was based
on the declaration of the ex-queen
that she would ret use to attend
court when called for the de
fense.- This would force the govern
ment to bring her into court, and com
mit her to jail if she refuses, to testify,
as she further threatened. The gov
ernment, therefore, requested the-de
fense to allow to go over, as the action
they would be obliged to take might
place the ex-queen before the world iv
the light of a martyr during the con
tinuance of the present crisis.
In an interview with one of the cab
inet last evening the fact developed that
in case of further trouble the executive
council will at once carry out the recom
mendation of the advisory council, to
hand Minister Willis his passport
and declare the ex-queen a prisoner of
state. From semi-official sources it is
further learned that should the British
minister make any attempt at interfer
ence either on behalf of the ex-queen or
England, the recommendation of the
advisory council will be extended
at once and Minister Wodehouse will
also be handed his passports. While
this will probably be the course the pro
visional government will take, if an
emergency arises, it cannot at the pres
ent writing be officially verified, as the
cabinet refuses to answer further than
the determination arrived at concern

TREATY TALK.
One May Be Entered Into Be-
tween England and Hawaii.
[Copyrighted, 1603, by the Associated Press. 1
Honolulu,— H. 1.,- Dec. 5.- (Via San
Francisco, Dec. 12, per S. S. Oceanic.)—
The steamer Arawa was held over until
noon yesterday to allow Hon. Macken
zie Bowell, minister of trade and
commerce, of Ottawa, Can., to address
the Honolulu chamber of commerce.
Mr. Bowell was accompanied by Mr.
Theodore H. Davies. Application was
first made to President Dole to use his
influence to call the chamber of com
merce together to listen to Mr. Bowell's
commercial propositions, which are now
known to have had a semi-political sig
nificance. Reporters were excluded from
the meeting ana it was impossible to
get off a report of the meeting by the
Arawa, though Mr. Bowell carries with
him a verbatim report by his secretary,
which will probably be puolished upon
his arrival. Mr. Bowell's speech con
sisted of an appeal for aid from the
Hawaiian government to encourage the
Canadian-Australian steamship line.
He told of the market in Canada for
Hawaiian products, and spoke of the
necessity of cable communication
between Hawaii and Canada and Aus
tralia. He said a" conference would be
held next year in Canada on the sub
ject, and invited Hawaii to send a rep
resentative. The members of the cabi
net were seen shortly after the meet
ing , yesterday, morning, and even
their guarded expressions of opinion
concerning the intent and purpose of
Mr. Bowell's proposition showed that
the real scheme behind his speech, as
reported, was preliminary to a proposal
for.3 new treaty to be entered into on
the part of England, through Canada,
with Hawaii. In answer to your cor
respondent, one of the cabinet said: . J
"Of course no proposition lias yet been
made; we have nothing before us, but
it it not likely that we will enter
into relations unless forced to do
so by the • attitude of the United
States. Yes. I am inclined to believe
that the hand and influence of England
is behind this proposal, and that a pro
posal for a new treaty will be made be
fore the time for the expiration of the
reciprocity treaty with the United
States. I certainly believe England is
trying to gain a foothold here." "
A rumor of disaffection in the govern
ment here.which has been going around
for some time, proves upon inquiry to
be without foundation. The policy of
resistance to either Internal or external
force has received the unanimous con
sent of the government. This Is stated
upon the best of authority.
Although two applications have been
made by the Associated. Press corre
spondent for an: interview with the ex
,queen since the arrival of the steamer
Australia, both have been denied. In
each case he was referred ,to Hon.
Panl Neumann, who seems to .be the
sole adviser and director of the ex
queen's policy now and** actions. Yes
terday evening the town was filled
with rumors that the ex-queen was
to be restored this morning at 10
o'clock. Later it was learned that the
rumors had arisen •. among native boat
boys and were caused by official visits
in the morning by United States Minis
ter Willis to the British cruiser Cham
pion, and Rear Admiral Irwin to the
Japanese cruiser JSauiwa. -
APPEAL TO CONGRESS.
Annexationists Pass Resolutions
Stating Their. Position.
Vancouver, 8.C., Dec.' 12.—
Australian steamship Arawa arrived at
Victoria today, having left Honolulu
Dec:* 4. ; Queen Liliuokalani •* has V not
been restored, and" there has been no
trouble in Honolulu. Since the arri
val or the last report there have 'been
but two tilings. of a significant nature.'
The annexationists held a mass meeting
on Saturday, Nov. 25," and adopted reso
lutions in effect appealing to congress
over tbe address of President Cleveland, -
Secretary Gresham and Mr. Blount::- On
the four days preceding the sailing of
the Arawa the troops of the provisional
government . were busy fortifying and
barricading Government house, or the
castle, as formerly called. . Nothing has
yet been done looking to the restoration
of the queen. ::>-Vf- v -
IN A' HE DARK.
Minister Thurston Ignorant of the
Situation in Hawaii.
: San Francisco, ; Dec. Hawaiian
Minister Thurston arrived in this city
today on a delayed overland train from
Ogden. "I ■am looking for news my
self," said Mr. Thurston. The advices
today. will tell' you' more thau I can of
the state of affairs on the islands. As I
explained in an Interview at Chicago, I
have come on here from Washington so
as to be able to make the earliest pos
sible reply to official communications
reaching me by the steamship Oceanic.
I may go to Honolulu, should there be
any reason for my presence there, but
that I do not anticipate."
Then, asked what he thought of fro
present situation on the islands and of
the outlook, Mr. Thurston declared him
self to be as much in the dark about the
matter as anybody else. -'-jy^
"I cannot say what the outcome will
be," said he, "but. of this I am sure,
that the provisional, government was
never stronger in . the support of the
best elements of the Hawaiian people
than it is today. 1 cannot enter into
auy discussion of matters that affect the
relations of the provisional govermeut
with the administration at Washington.
I do not know what the Instructions of
Minister Willis are, and, of course,
could not undertake to criticise them if
1 did." .::..------. ,;::
Mr. Thurston, declined;, to say any
thing in relation to Blount's report. in
the way of addition .to his published
statement, in which .he replies to cer
tain assertions made by the commis
sioner arid having a personal bearing.
"I may remark, however," said the
minister, "that the report of Mr. Blount
contained many misstatements in mat
ters of detail, upon which . I must now
decline to enter. All of its material ,
statements in respect to Minister
Stevens have already been completely
disproved. And, no" matter what the
sympathies of Mr. Stevens may have
been, it remains true that he did noth
ing but what he should have done under
the circumstances, and acted in strict
accord with his diplomatic instruc
tions." -•-.;-;- .* i :-.';.-'•;•: :.■--■
In regard to the labor problem as af
fecting annexation, Mr. Thurston said
that every resident sugar planter on the
islands favors .annexation. There are
but three others, who are Clans Spreck
els, an Englishman and a German. The
fact that ail resident planters favor an
nexation Mr. Thurston regards as a
complete answer to any objection on
tbe score of the labor problem.

CULLOM FIRES HIS GUN*

election was a vindication of the Repub
lican protective policy. '- -
Mr. Cullum— l do say that, the con
duct which 1 have described as having
occurred in New York state, which in
my.iudgnient gave the majority to the
Democratic party, aud ■ which resulted
in the election of a Democratic senator,,
has been condemned by the people of
New York, by nearly a hundred thou
sand majority, in defeating the Demo
cratic candidate,- Judge Maynard, for
judge. - :
Mr. Hill— Had the elections anything
to do with the question of the tariff?
Mr. Cullom— No. except that the Dem«
ocratic party in convention adopted a
platform, and ever since has declared
that it intended to carry out in law what
it proclaimed in its platform at Chicago
and that has alarmed .the people and
helped to give the majorities which
have been recently grven in favor of the
Republican party and against the Dem
ocratic party.
Mr. Hill— The senator - need not lie
awake nights over any anxiety upon the
subject of whether the Democratic party
proposes to carry out its pledges upon
the tariff question. I can assure him
that the party does intend ro carry them
out faithfully, honestly and impartially.
Mr. Cullom then went on with his
speech, referring to the pulling down of
the American flag at Hawaii, which
could not have been accomplished by all
the power of monarchical Europe, but
which had been committed by the order
of an American president upou the ad
vice of a "newly baptized Democratic
secretary of state." [Laughter.]
Mr. Stewart (Rep., Nev.) then ad
dressed the senate In favor of the repeal
of the federal election laws. He soon
drifted into a discussion of the financial
question, and attributed the evils com
plained of to the gold standard. Dur
ing his speech, at tue suggestion of Mr.
Peffer, the roll was called, and forty
eight senators responded.
The senate then, at 3:10, went into
executive session. At 4 o'clock tin
senate adjourned until tomorrow.
TINKERING TARIFF.
Malt Taxed 30 Per Cent Ad Valo
rem and Cut Diamonds Re
duced.
Washington, Dec. 12. — Before the
adjournment today the committee on
ways and means completed the sched
ules of the tariff bill and devoted a por
tion of the afternoon upon the adminis
trative portions of the bill. Republican
members of tho committee do not be
lieve that the bill will be submitted be
fore Saturday next, while the Demo
crats insist that itjwill be reported much
earlier, possibly on Thursday. Al
though forty members or the . house
have requested a caucus on the tariff
bill, it is not sure that the bill will re
ceive such consideration. Chairman
Holman, of the caucus, to whom the
request was presented, Immediately
held a conference with Chairman
Wilson, of the ways and means
committee, but nothing was definitely
agreed upon. Mr. Uolman was taken
sick before the conference ended,
and went home. If Mr. Holman
should not recover before the bill is re
ported it Is not likely that he will issue
a call for a caucus. It is now known
that all of the members of the ways
and means committee and many of the
leaders of the house on the Democratic
side have no desire for a caucus on the
tariff bill. Some of the Democrats who
are most anxious to have changes made
in the schedules are opposed to a cau
cus. They believe that forty or fifty
Democrats can be found who will vote
with the Republicans, and that thereby
the bill can be amended in the house.
When the ways and means committee
took a recess at 12 o'clock touaythe
spirits schedule of the tariff bill had
been reached. The sugar schedule was
undisturbed. The Republican mem
bers did not make any effort to secure
any change in this schedule. Some talk
was indulged iv by the Republicans
over rice and peanuts, which still re
main on ihe dutiable list, but no amend
ments were offered.
The committee changed the malt
schedule again, increasing it from 25 to
30 per cent ad valorem. The duty on
cut diamonds has been reduced fro In It
per cent in the first bill to the present
rate, 10 per cent.
- Among the members who signed tho
call for the caucus were: Morgan,
Missouri; Cockrell. Texas; Richardson,
Michigan; Paschall. Texas; Champ,
Clark, Missouri; Smith, Arizona; Kyle,
Mississippi; Capehart, West Virginia;
Stockdale, Mississippi; Alderson, West
