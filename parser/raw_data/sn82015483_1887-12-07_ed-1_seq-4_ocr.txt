to try the Cuticura Remedies. Tho effect was si m

concluded from first page.
089 perroua employed in such manufactur
ing interests as are claimed to be benefitted
by a high tariff.
HOW THE TARIFF WORKS.
To these the appeal is made to save their
employment and maintain their wages by
resisting a change. There should be no dis
position to answer such suggestion by the
allegations that they are in a minority among
those who la Dor. ana tnererore snouiu iorego
advantage in the interest of low prices for
the majority; their compensation, as it may
be affected by tne operation or tana laws,
should at all times be scrupulously kept in
view, and yet with slight reflection they will
not overlook the fact that they are con
sumers with the rest; that they, too, have
their own wants and those of their families
to supply from their earnings, and that the
price of the necessaries of life, as well as the
amount of their wages will regulate the
measure of their welfare and comfort.
But the reduction of taxation demanded
should be so measured as not to necessitate
or justify either the loss of employment by
the workingmen nor the lessening of his
wages; and the profits still remaining to the
manufacturer after a necessary readjustment
should furnish rfo excuse for the sacrifice of
the interests of his employes, either in their
opportunity to work or in the diminution of
their compensation. Nor can the workers in
manufactures fail to understand that while a
high tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow
the payment of the remunerative wages it
certainly results in a very large increase in
the nrice of nearly all sorts of manufactures,
which, in almost countless forms, he needs
for the nse of himself and his family. tie
receives at the desk of his employer his
whom and Derhaps before he reaches his
home is obliged, in a purchase for family
use of an article which embraces his own
labor, to return in the payment of the in
crease in price which the tariff permits, the
hard earned compensation of many days of
toil.
The farmer and agriculturist who - manu
factures nothing butwho pays the increased
price the tariff imposes upon every agricul
tural implement, upon all he wears and upon
all he nses and owns, except the increase of
his flocks and herds and suoh things as his
husbandry produces from the soil, is invited
to aid in maintaining the present situation,
and he is told that a high duty on imported
wool is necessary for the benefit of those who
have sheep to shear in order that the price of
their wool may be increasea. iney or course
are not reminded that the farmer who has no
sheep is by this scheme obliged in his pur
chases of clothing and woolen goods to pay a
tribute to his fellow farmer as well as to the
manufacturers and merchants; nor is any
mentien made of the fact that the sheep own
ers themselves and their household must
wear clothing and nse other articles manu
factured from the wool they sell at tariff
prices, and thus as consumers must return
their share of this increased price to the
tradesmen.
I think it may be fairly assumed that a
large proportion of the sheep owned by the
farmers throughout the country are found in
small flocks numbering from 25 to SO. The
duty on the grade of imported wool which
the sheep yield is 10 cents each pound if of
the value of 30 cents or less, and 12 cents if
of the value of more than 30 cents. If the
liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed for
each fleece the duty thereon would be 60 or
72 cents, and this may be taken as the ut
most enhancement of the price of the farmer
by reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars
would thus represent the increased price of
the wool from 25 sheep and $36 that from
the wool of 00 sheep, and at present values
this addition would amount to about one
third of its price. If upon its sale the farmer
receives this or a less tariff profit, the wool
leaves his hands charged with precisely that
sum which in all its charges will adhere
to it until it reaches the oonsumer.
When made into cloth and other goods and
material for use,its cost is not only increased
to the extent of the farmer's tariff profit, but
a further sura has been added for the benefit
of the manufactures on the operation of oth
er tariff laws. In the meantime the day ar
rives when the farmer finds it necessary to
purchase woolen goods and material to
clothe himself and family for the winter.
"When he faces the tradesmen for that pur
pose he discovers that he is obliged not only
to return in the way of increased prices, his
tariff profit on the wool he sold, and which
then perhaps lies before him in manufactur
ed form, but that he must add a considers,
ble sum thereto to meet a further increase in
cost caused by a tariff duty on the manufac
ture. Thus in the end he is aroused to the
f aot that he hag paid upon a moderate pur
chase as a result of the tariff scheme whioh,
when he sold his wool seemed so profitable,
increase in price more than sufficient to sweep
away all the tariff profit he receives upon
the wool he produced and sold. When the
number of farmers engaged in wool raising
is compared with all the farmers in the coun
try and the small proportion they bear to our
population is considered, when it is made
apparent that in the case of a large part of
those who own sheep, the benefit of the pres
ent tariff on wool is illusory, and above all
when it must be conceded that the increase
of the cost of living caused by such tariff
becomes a burden upon those with moderate
means and the poor, the employed and un
employed, the sick and well, and the young
and old, and that it constitutes a tax which,
with relentless grasp, is fastened upon the
clothing of every man, woman and child in
the land, reasons are suggested why the re
moval or reduction of this duty should be in
cluded in a revision of our tariff laws.
the "trusts."
In speaking of the increased cost to the
consumer of our home manufactures result
ing from a duty laid upon imported articles
of the same description, the fact is not over
looked that competition among our domes-
tio producer sometimes has the effect of
keeping the price of their products below the
highest limit allowed by such duty. But it
is notorious that' this competition is too
often strangled by combinations qnite preva
lent at this time,and frequently called trusts,
which have for their object the regulation of
the supply and price of commodities made
and sold by members of the combination. The
people can hardly hope for any consideration
in the operation ot tnese selfish schemes. If,
however, in the absenoe of such combination,
a healthy and free competition reduces the
price of any particular dutiable article of
home production below the limit which it
might otherwise reach under onr tariff laws,
ana it, wltn suon reduced price, its manu
facture continues to thrive, it is entirely evi
dent that one thing has been discovered which
should be caref ally scrutinized in an effort to
reauoe taxation.
The neoessity of combination to maintain
the price of any commodity to the tariff
point furnishes proof that someone is willing
to accept lower prices for such commodity
and that suoh prices are remunerative; and
lower prices produced by competition prove
the same thing. Thus, where either of these
conditions exist, a caae would seem to be pre
sented tor an easy reduction ot taxation.
HOW A CBAKOB SHOULD BE MADE.
The considerations whioh have been pre
sented touching our tariff laws are intended
only to enforce an earnest recommendation
that the surplus revenues of the government
be prevented by the reduction of our customs
duties, and at the same time to emphasize a
suggestion that in accomplishing this purpose
f ws may discharge a double duty to our peo
ple Dy granting to tnem a measure ot relief
from tariff taxation in quarters where it is
most needed and from sources where it can
be most fairly and justly accorded. Nor can
the presentation made of such considerations
be, with any degree of fairness, regarded as
evidence ot unfriendliness toward our manu
facturing interests, or any lack of apprecia
tion of their value and importance; these in
terests constitute a leading and most sub
stantial element of onr national greatness and
furnish the proudproof of our country's prog
ress. Bnt if in the emergenoy that presses
upon ns onr manufacturers are asked to sur
render something for the public good. and to
avert disaster, their patriotism as well as a
grateful recognition of advantages already
affor ded should lead them to willing co-oper
ation. No demand is made that they shall
forego all the benefits of governmental re
gard; but they conaot fail to be admonished
of their duty, as well as their enlightened
self-interest and safety, when they are re
minded of the fact that financial panic and
to which the present condition tends afford
no greater shelter or protection to our manu
facturers than to our other important enter
prises. Opportunity for safe, careful and de
liberate reform is now afforded and none of
us should be unmindful of a time when an
abused and irritated people, heedless of those
wno nave resisted timely and reasonable re
lief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping
rectification of their wrongs.
The difficulty attending a wise and fair re
vision of our tariff laws is not underestimat
ed. It will require on the part of Congress
great labor and care and especially a broad
and national contemplation of the subject
and a patriotic disregard of such local and
selfish claims as are unreasonable and reck
less of the welfare of the entire country.
Under onr present laws more than four thou
sand articles are subject to duty. Many of
these do not in any way compete with our
own manufactures, and many are hardly
worth attention as subjects of revenue. A
considerable rednction can be made in the
aggregate by adding them to the free list.
The taxation of luxuries presents bo features
of hardship; but the necessaries of life used
and consumed by all the people, the duty
upon which adds to the cost of living in
every home, should be greatly cheapened.
The radical reduction or tne amies im
posed upon raw material in manufactures or
its free importation is of course an impor
tant factor in any effort to reduce the
price of those necessary; it would not
only relieve them from the increased
cost caused by the tariff on suoh ma
terial, but the manufactured proaucs oeing
thus cheapened that part of the tariff now
laid upon such product as a compensation to
our manufacturers for the present price of
raw material could be accordingly modified.
Such reduction or free importation would
serve besides to largely reduce the revenue.
It is not apparent how such a change cau
have anv iniurious effect oa oar manufac
turers. On the contrary, it would appear
to give them a better chance in foreign
markets with the manufacturers of other
countries, who cheapen their wares by free
material.
Thus our people mieht have the opportu
nity of extending their sales beyond the
limits of home consumption saving them
from the depression, interruption in business
and loss caused Dy giaitea aomseua market
and affording their employes more certain
and steady labor with its resulting quiet and
contentment.
The question thus imperatively presented
for solution should be approached in a spirit
higher than -Dartisanship and considered in
the light of that regard for patriotio duty
which should characteriie the aotion of
those intrusted with the weal of a connuing
But the obligation to declared party polioy
and principle is not wanting to nrge prompt
and efficient action. Both of the great polit
ical parties now represented in government
have by repeated and authoritative declara
tion condemned the condition ot our laws
which permits the collection from the people
of unnecessary revenue and have in the most
Bolemn manner promised its correction, and
neither as citizens or partisans are our coun
trymen in a mood to condone the deliberate
violation of these pledges.
HOT A THBOBT.
Our progress toward a wise conclusion will
not be improved by dwelling upon the theor
ies of protection and free trade, inis savors
too much of bandvinor epithets. It is con
dition which confronts ns not a theory.
Belief from this condition may involve a
slight redaction of the advantages which we
award our home productions, but the entire
withdrawal of such advantages should not be
contemplated. The question of free trade is
absolutely irrelevant, and the. persistent
claim is made in certain quarters that all
efforts to relieve the people from UDjust and
unnecessary taxation are schemes of so
called free traders, is mischievous and far
removed from any considerations for the
public good.
The simple and plain duty which we owe
the people is to reduce taxation to the neces
sary expenses of an economical operation of
the government, and to restore to tne Dust
iness of the country the money which we
hold in the treasury through the perversion
of governmental powers. These things can
and should be done with safety to all our in
dustries, without danger to the opportunity
for remunerative labor wnicn our working
men need and with benefit to them and to
all our people, by cheapening the means of
subsistence and increasing the means of their
comforts.
THE STATE OF THE UNION.
The constitution provides that the Presi
dent "shall, from time to time, give to
Congress information of the state of the
Union." It has been the custom of the ex
ecutive, in compliance with the provision, to
annually exhibit to Congress at the opening
of its session the general condition of the
country, and to detail with some par
ticularity the operations of the different
executive departments. It would be espec
ially agreeable to follow this course at
the present time, and call attention to the
valuable accomplishments of these de
partments during the last fiscal But I
am so muoh impressed with the paramount
importance of the subjeot to which this com
munication has thus far been devoted that I
shall forego the additional of any other topic,
and only urge upon your immediate consider
ation the "state of the Union" as shown in
the present condition of our treasury and our
general fiscal situation, upon which every
element of our safety and prosperity depends.
The reports of the heads ot departments,
which will be submitted, oontain full and ex
plicit information touching the transaction of
the business intrusted to them, and such
recommendations relating to legislation in the
public interest as they deem advisable. I
ask for these reports and recommendations
the deliberate examination and action of the
legislative branch of the government.
There are other subjects not embraced in
the departmental reports demanding legisla
tive consideration, and which I should be
glad to submit. Some of them, however,
have been earnestly presented in previous
messages, and as to them, I beg leave to re
peat prior recommendations. As the law
makes no provision for any report from the
department of State, a brief history of the
transactions of that important department,
together with other matters wnicn it may
hereafter be deemed essential to commend to
the attention of Congress, may furnish
tne occasion for a future communication.

Ever since the Bed Men organized here a
year ago James Gallagher, jr., the enterpris
ing tobacconist, has been trying to get some
thing appropriate in the way of smoking tile
for their use, and has finally sucoeeded in
getting just the right thing. To be sure he
has but four pipes, but they are veritable
Indian calumets and were obtained by an
Indian trader from a chief of the Sionx
nation and were sent frem the Bad Lands,
Dakota Territory. These pipes have had
considerable aotual use by the Sioux and a
glance at them is enough to conjure up in
lurid colors the various pow-wows and high
links these identical souvenirs have played
important parts in. Mr. Gallagher says he
has been "on the trail" for them for "many
moons," and that he had to part with "much
big wampum" to possess himself of them.
They may be seen at his store.

StTFRSSB COURT IN SXSSIOV.
The December session of the Supreme Court of
Errors convened yesterday with the full bench.
Corporation Counsel Driscsil requested the court to
either hear the arguments In the appeal of the New
Haven Steam Saw Mill company or come In some
time in January. Chief Justice Park said he would
consider Mr. DriscoU's motion. The first case
argued was that of Augustus S. Chase et al., execu
tors, vs. legatees of S. W. Hall et al. of Waterburr.
Samuel W. Hall died in Waterbury in 1877. By the
thirteenth clause of his will the use and improve
ment of $10,000 was bequeathed to Nelson Hall for
and during the term of his natural life, remainder
to the children of Hopkins P. HaU. Mr. Hall re
ceived $3,600 in cash and the balance In bank stock.
He inventoried the stock as his own and in the list
of his debts entered each year an item of $10,000
indebtedness to L. W. Hall's estate, payable alter
his death, which has occurred since. As the stock
is much mere valuable now plaintiffs do not wish
to return this, but the $10,000 instead. Judge An

The market Low But Conservatively
Bnllleh A Good Borrowing Demand
For stocks A Few Stocks Show am
Advanoe.
New York, Dec. 6.
The stock market was low to day at the opening.
The heavy sales iu London caused a decline there
which was taken advantage of by the bears and
traders who are ranged on that side. The general
temper of the room was conservatively bullish. The
pressure in the afternoon became too great for the
limited demand. There was a good borrowing de
mand for stocks of all kinds and the short interest
is again believed to be very large. Ths banner
weak stocks were Union Pacific and Jersey Central,
though all the London favorites were prominent in
the decline. St. Paul was also pressed for sole and
it wai the leading active Btock throughout the day,
closely followed by Union Pacific, Reading and
Lackawanna, though the latter was well held con
sidering its late marked weakness. The only ex.
ceptions to the rule were the quicksilvers. Wheeling
and Lake Erie and San Francisco preferred, all of
which closed with an advance. Railroad bonds
were dull and as a rule firm, though the feature was
the weakness in the Kansas and Texas Issues and
Fort Worth and Denver. The total sales were
$069,000.

A king once summoned his three sons,
And thus addressed the anxious ones :
" Go forth, my sons, through all the earth
Aid search for articles of worth ;
Then he who brings the choicest thing-.
Shall in my stead be crowned as king."
In one year's time again they meet.
And kneel before the sovereign's feet :
And as with gracious outstretched hand.
He welcomed home the youthful band,
He natural eagerness expressed, '
To see the objects of their quest.
The first such lustrous pearls displays,
That every tongue is loud in praise.
So white, the snow-flakes on their way
Compared to them are dull and gray.
The next a diamond more pure,
And larger than the Koh-i-noor,
That shone with such a brilliant light,
The sunbeams, shamed, withdrew from
sight.
