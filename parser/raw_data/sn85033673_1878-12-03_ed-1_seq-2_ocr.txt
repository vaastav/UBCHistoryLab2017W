fj THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The annual message of President
Hayes was read yesterday at the open
ing of the third session of the forty
fifth congress. We will give a resume
of the more important points.' The
first subject touched upon after tho
introduction is the yellow fever. The
interesting statement is , made that
about one hundred thousand cases are
believed to have occurred, of which
about 20,000, according to intelligent
estimates, proved fatal. The pecuni
ary loss to the oountry is only to be
reckoned bv the hundred million of
dollars'! ' JMiteen hundred tentaand
rations to the value of $"25,000 were
sent to the cities and towns which ap
plied for them. ; The President con
cludes on this subject by saying:
Tho frnrful spread of this epidemic has
awakened a very general public senti
ment in furor of niitmnal sanitary admin
istration, which shall not only control
ouaruntine. lut have tha sanitary siitwr-
vision of internal commerce in time of
epidemics, and hold an advisory relation
to the State and municipal health author
ities, with power to deal with whatever
endangers tho public health, and which
tho municipal- and iStnte authnritie are
unable to reflate.. .The national quaran
tine act annroved April ', 1878. which
was passed too late in the last session of
congre.- to provide the means for carrying
it into practical operation during the past
season, is a step in the direction here in
dicated. In view of the necessity for
the most effective measures, by (junrantine
and otherwise, for the protection of our
seaiiort and the country generally for this
and other epidemic., it u recommended
that congress give to the whole subject
early nnd careful consideration.
The state of afiairs jxditical and the
receut, congressional, elections in the
South next leceive attention. This
section of the message will he read
with the greatest interest everywhere,
as it is supposed to have some bearing
on the next Presidential election. It
will, perhaps, disappoint wmie of the
more rabid and stalwart Republicans,
yet can be' made - to do ! service by
partisan , Idlers and ' papers. - The
President surnes that manufactured
or greatly exaggerated reports coming
through party channels are facta. In
this he reveals the lingering prejudices
and partisan feeling of tho politician.
If the laws have been violated in any
parfof the, country the" offenders
should be punished, lut a President
goes out of tha way when he bases a
message or a part of it upon a mere
rumor which, originated with defeated
candidates or mendacious politicians.
Mr." Hays says, in Tcferring to South
ern elections: '
The friends of law and order looked for
ward to tlio conduct of these elections a
offering to the general judgment of the
country an important opportunity to
measure the degree in which the rights of
suffrage could be eseni-eil by the colored
neople, and would be respected by their
icllow-citi.ens; but a more general enjoy
me.'it of freedom of suffrage by the colored
peopiO, and a more just and generous
protection of that freedom by the commu
nities of' which they form a part, were
generally unticipated than the record of
the elections discloses. In some of those
States in which tho colored people have
been unable to rurilu? their opinions felt in
tho elections, the result is mainly due to
influcncci not easily measured or reme
died by legal protection; but in the Htntes
of Louisiana mid South Carolina at large,
and in some particular congressional di-
trict outside nf those. fStutes, the record!.
of the election seem to compel th Couchl
sioii that the rights of the colored voters
have been overridden, and their nartieiim1
tion in the elections not permitted to be
either general or tree.
It will be for tho congress for which
these elections were held to make such ex
animations into their condui t is mav be
appropriate to determine the validity of
the Claims i iih-iimi, vo uieir scan, in
tho meanwhile it become tba duty of the
executive and judicial department) of tho
government, each, in its province, to in
miiro into and punish violations of tho
laws of tho United States, which have
occurred. I call but repeat what 1 snid in
this connection in my last inossiige, that
whatever authority rests with mo to this
end 1 shall not hesitate to put forth, and I
am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal
to the legislatures, the courts, the execu
tive authorities and the people of the
.States where these wrongs havo been per
petrated, to give their assistance toward
bringing to justice the offenders and pre
venting a repetition of the crimes. Xo
.means within my power will be spared to
obtain a full and fair inveatigatioa of the
alleged crimes, and to secure the convic
tion and just punishment of the guilty.
J respectfully urge upon your attention
that the congressional elections, in cvory
district, jiv a very important sense, are
justlv a .matter of political intereit and
concern throughout tho whole country.
Kadi State, every political party, is en
titled to the share of power which is con
ferred bv (he legal and constitutional suG-j-,
It is tha right of every citizen,
poking the .nial.llcalions pr-r tod by
fiiw tocit-tone iiiiintuiudatod ballot, and
to have his ballot honestly counted. So
I,.ng as the exercL-e f 'his power and the
viyoymentof thin right aro common and
equal, practically a well as formally, sub
mission to the results of the suffrage will
be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and
all the departments of government will
fivl the true vigor of the popular will
thus exprosed. No temjHirary or ad
ministrative interests of government, how
ever urgent or weighty, will ever displace
tho seal of our people in defense of
the primary righta of citizenship.
They understand that the protection of
liberty reouvrea tha maintenance, in full
vigor, of the many methods of free speech,
free press, and free suffrage, and will sus
tain the full authority of government to
enforce the laws which are framed to pre
serve these inestimable rights. The ma
terial nrocress and welfare of the States
depend on the protection afforded to their
citizen.... There can bene peace without
such protection, no prosperity without
peace, and the whole couutry i deeply
interested in the growth and prosperity of
all its parts,.
"V hue the country has not vet reached
complete unity of feeling and reciprocal
confidence between the communities so
lately and bo seriously estranged, I feel an
absolute assurance that the tendencies are
in that direction, and with increased force.
The power o public opinion will override
all political prejudices, and all sectional or
State attachments, in demanding that all
over our wide territory the name and
character of citizens of the United States
shall mean one and the same thing, and
carry with them unchallenged security
and respect.
It the President could see both
sides of tlie question he might at least
have called attention to the fact that
in most of tho Southern States a per
fect understanding and the utmost
harmony prevail between tho white
and colored people. In Mississippi,
for instance, there are congressional
districts overwhelmingly colored,
where no violence or disturbance
whatever was reported, and yet Demo
crats were returned to congress. Gen
eral Chalmers, one of the re-elected,
was not even in his district during the
canvass, being sick in Louisville, Ky.
The President lends himself to party
uses when ho seeks to make political
capital out of two or three alleged
election disturbances, and yet passes
in silence over the indisputable fact
that the great body of the people in
the South aro at peace--are on good
terms with each other, and as the gen
eral rule, law-abiding, and quietly
pursuing the ordinary avocations of
life.
In reading over the other portions
of the message nothing of special sig
nificance or importance strikes the
mind. The following allusion is made
to tho Mexican question in a very com
mendable spirit:
Since the resumption of diplomatic rer
httioiis with Mexico, corresjKindence has
been opened and still continues between
the two governments upon tne various
questions which at one time seemed to en
danger their relations. While no lonna
agreement has been reached as to the
troubles on the border, much has been
done to repress and diminish them. The
ptlective force ot Lnitea Mates troops on
the ltio Grande, by a strict and faithful
compliance with instructions, has done
much to romove tho sources of dispute.
and it is now understood that a like force
lit Mexican troota on the other side of the
river is also making an energetic move
ment against the marauding Indian tribe.
This government looks with the greatest
satisfaction tion every evidence of
strength in the national authority of Mex
ico, and upon every effort put forth to
prevent or to punish incursions upon
our territory. Keluctant to assume
any action or attitude in the control of
these incursions, by military movements
across the border, not imperatively de
manded for the protection of the lives and
property of our own citizens, 1 shall take
tne earliest opportunity, consistent wun
the nroner disclmrsre of this plain dutv. to
recognize the ability of the" Mexican gov
ernment to restrain effectively violation.
of our tcrritoiy. It is proposed to hold
next year an international exhibition in
Mexico, and it is believed that the display
of the agricultural and manufacturing
products of the two nations will tend to
better understanding and increased com
mercial intercourse between their people.

All is over, but there remain some
things yet to be said respecting the
success of our American exhibitors at
this latest and, all things considered,
the most interesting ot our interna
tional exhibitions.
The disinterested and self-sacrificing
spirit displayed by some ot our Amer
cn citizens in connection with the
Paris Kx position is worthy of high
praise. The legislature of the State
of Jennessee, at. its last session, failed
to vote an appropriation for the pur
pose of making au exhibit at Pans of
the agricultural and mineral wealth of
the Stite, although tho cost of such
an exhibit would have been repaid a
hundred fold by the increased impetus
which it would givo immigration to
the State. Mr. J. 15. Killebrcw, the
State commissioner ot the bureau
agriculture, statistics and mines, re
solved that the fttato should not be
deprived of the advantages whicl;
might be derived from such an exposi
tion, and he himselt undertook the
tat-k. Tho result is that the State o:
Tennessee figures hero in the mow
creditable manner. Her luxurian
and magnificent agricultural products
aro exhibited in splendid style, an
her importance as a wool-growing
fetiito is shown by tho hue displays o

Several days ago the Pcblic Ledof.r
published & long account of Mollie
Pancher of Brooklyi, who " hasn't
eaten anything for nearly fourteen
years." The New York Sun haa held
an interview with Dr. Hammond in
relation to Mollie, and thus reports
that distinguished gentleman :
. . Dr. William A. llammond sat in an
immense and ancient chair in his
library when the Sun reporter called
upon him.
"I have read the Brticle on Miss
Fancher," ho said; "read it all
through carefully."
""Well, .what do you think of it
doctor?"
"What do I think of it? Why,
that it is a perfect humbug a clear
case of deception, sir."
" But, doctor, there is the testi
mony of such men as tho llev. Dr.
Durvan. the Rev. Dr. Van Dyek, Prof.
West, Henry Parkhurst, the astrono
mer, and such physicians as Drs.
Speir, Ormiston, Kissam and Mit
chell." " I don't mean to say that the writer
of that article has not been told all
that he has written, or that the gen
tlemen named are not honest in their
opinions. lJut 1 know that they are
all deceived lied to by this hysterical
girl." . . ,
isut just see what tests she was
subjected to. How can thero be any
deception
" Well, there is deception in it all,
said the doctor, vigorously. It's all a
humbug. W hv, my dear lellow. she
isn't the first girl that has deceived
earned and good men. There are
plenty ot cases ot simulated hysterics.
and Miss 1 ancher s I case is one. l
haven't seen her, never heard of her
betore : but I have heard of so many
other simular cases that I do not hesi
tate to speak strongly about it."
I ho worst case ol tins kind, con
tinued the doctor, " is that of Sarah
Jacob, who was known as tho ' Welsh
Pasting uirl. She was born on May
12, 1S57. Her parents were ignorant.
In her early years she was healthy and
intelligent, given to religious reading,
and, it is said, composed poetry. Sho
was a very pretty child. In February,
1S07, she complained of pain in the
pit of her stomach, and afterward had
spasms of a clearly hysterical charac
ter. She suffered much from fits and
spasms, and the quantity of food she
ate gradually diminished. On the
10th of October it was solemnly de
clared that she had ceased to take any
food whatever. Then she began to
attract attention The parents
insisted that sho ate nothing,
that food was loathsome to her. The
vicar was skeptical, and for months
argued with the girl and her parents.
te line them that he knew there was
deception. They strenuously denied
it, and at length the vicar himself
gave in. He believed in the lasting,
and published a letter that he knew
that she ' had not taken a single grain
of any kind of food whatever during
sixteen months, lie invited medical
men to sxaniine into her case. Ihe
suggestion of the vicar was acted upon
by the neighbors. I hey appointed a
committee, which watohod fourteen
days and the committee reported that
wasagenuino case, no deception,
owever, the reports of this case
show that tho watch was a very care-
ess one, the parents having access to
the child at all times. Then Dr.
Fowler, a noted physician, looked into
the case and examined the girl care
fully. Ue found her a pretty, plump
child, with ro?y checks and lips and
sparkling eyea. He found by his ex
amination that her condition was such
to show the impossibility of her
being the subject of an exhaustive
iscase, or even ol her having been in
bed continuously for nearly two years.
as her parents asserted. Dr. Fowler's
conclusion, an published in the Lon
don limes, was that it was simply a
case ol simulative hysteria in a young
girl having the propensity to deceive
very strongly developed, and that with
it was associated, notably, the power
or habit ot prolonged tasting.
ell. continued the doctor, the
case created so much excitemeut that
corps of trained nurses, from Guy's
Hospital. Jjondon, were sent to watch
arah. Her parents sanctioned the
proceedings, and the watch began on
the Uth of December. Gradually
symptoms of mental and physical dis
turbance appeared, rive days later
she was looking pale and anxious : her
eves were sunken, her nose pinched
lhe vicar told her parents that Sarah
was failing, and suggested sending the
nurses away and giving her a chance
to obtain food. They refused ; said
they had seen her quite as weak be
fore, and that she would not eat
whether the nurses were there or not
Repeatedly were they begged to with
draw the nurses, and again and again
they refused, saying there was no oc
casion. Darati became weaker and
weaker, and on the 17th of December
died actually starved to death. 1 cs,
sir, starved to death. Thccase created
much excitement. An inquest was
held. The coroner said thero could be
no doubt that the responsibility rested
with tho father, who knowingly and
designedly failed to cause his child to
take lood. 1 he jury deliberated fifteen
minutes and returned a verdict that
Sarah Jacob died of starvation caused
by the neglect of the father to make
tho child take food. Then the govern
ment took tho matter up, Jacob and
his wife were arrested and also the
medical men who had superintended
tho watching. No case was made out
against the latter. The former were
tried for manslaughter; tho lather was
sentenced to twelve- months' hard
labor and the mother to six months.
"Now, hero was a oaito," continued
the doctor, "tho like of which lias
never boon seen. lt bIiows plainly
how all tho facta which scicneo has
gathered go for naught, cvon with ed
ucated persons, when brought face to
face with tho false assertions of a hys
terical girl and two ignorant and do
ceitf'ul peasants. If wo know any one
thing, it is this, that thero can bo no
Ibrcc without tho metamorphosis qf
matter or some kind. 1 ot burn was a
girl maintaining her weight, actually
growing, ner animal neat Kept at its
duo standard, her mind active, her
heart beating, hr lungs respiring, her
skn oxhailnK, end. al this, ns many
people supposed, without the ingestion
of Uio material by which alone such
things could be. Why, it is ridiculous,
preposterous. Upon my word, if that
girl over in Brooklyn should die in
aoyofthosa experiments made with
her, I'd have every one, concerned n
the matter indicted for manslaughter.
I would, indoed."
"Two years ago," the doctor added,
"I wrote about this thing in a book
on Spiritualism and nervous derange
ment, in which I spoke as 1 have
spoken to you. In addition, I said
this (the doctorgot the book andread):
"Such is the tendency of the aver
age human niiud to be deceived that
it would be perfectly possible to re
enact in the city of New York the
whole tragedy of Sarah Jacb, should
ever a hysterical girl take it in ner head
to do so, and there would not be want
ing even tfrom among those who might
read this history, individuals who
would credit auy monstrous declara
tions she might make."
"That sounds like prophecy, don't
it?" said tho doctor, smiling.
"But how do you account for her
secsnd sight ; her reading a paper that
sho don't see ; her telling the contents
of a sealed envelop?"
"She can't do it." said tho doctor,
vehemently. "She can do nothing of
the kind. I'll bet $3000 she can't do
it before mo. I will write a check for
over $1000, and if she will tell me the
exact amount, the bank on which it is
drawn, and describe the check gener
ally. I'll give it to her. Why, 1 can
read you case after case where these
hysterical girls have deceived thou
sands. Take tho matter of visions.
This girl in Brooklyn is a Protestant,
so sho confines her visions to seeing
heaven and her dead freiends. Were
sho a Catholic she'd see the Virgin
Mary or the Savior, like that girl at
Ijourdes. who sees the Virgin, and
who actually has been the means of
having a church built on rthe spot
where the visions appear. You have
seen accounts of the excitement she
has created. Why. she is simply a
cataleptic. I have myself had under
my immediate charge fifty girls and
women who in the condition of ec
stasy have had visions of all sorts all
the way from God himselt down to
tho schoolmistress who had locked
them ud in dark closetd. I tell you
that those people in Brooklyn are of
two classes those who lie and those
who are deceived. Mind you, 1 do
not sav that Miss Fancher is to blame,
that she does all this intentionally.
Hysteria prompts deception. It is a
characteristic of the disease. She has
probably not will enough to overcome
the desire to deceive. But she would
be aided in every way to overcome the
desire, not assisted in her deceptions.
For all this is simply the deception of
a hysterical girl.
"But she has deceived clergymen
and physicians,"
"Oh, that's nothing. Clergymen are
the most gullible men in the weld,
and physicians who have not made a
study of nervous diseases are apt to be
imposed upon by these girls."
L0RNE AND LOUISE AT SEA.
The Latest and Truest Account of the
Sarmatian's Voyage.
Oil City Derrick.
Every onco and a while the public
has evidence of the vast superiority of
the Derrick as a newspaper over the
London limes, which, wo are tree to
confess, is very gratifying to us, and
we have no doubt quite discouraging
to our esteemed contemporary of Lon
don. We will not say that it was
wholly on the score of economy that
the Times did not send a commissioner
along to report the ocean voyage of
the Marquis and Princess of Lornc,
but wo have our suspicions. The
Derrick was apprehensive that the
Associated Press would pass over with
a word many important details of the
voyage, and so had our most reliable
and trustworthy young man on board
the Sarmatian that the movements ot
the royal party might be faithfully
recorded. Just as we feared, the As
sociated Press was shamefully derelict
in its duty. hile it reports the voy
age at some length, and imparts to us
tho information that her royal high
ness was at times quite unwell ; that
again she was feeling better ; that at
another time she appeared on deck ;
that again she was worse, and sails
were shortened in consequence ; that
two guns were fired; that the rest of
the party were well, but much con
cerned on account of her royal high
ness, etc. While the Associated Press
docs all this, it falls much short of re
porting the voyage as it should be re
ported, as will be apparent to the
reader alter lie haa read the following
from our special embassadors log
book :

overboard and contents lost; contain
ed seventeen hens and a rooster; most
ot the hens were fresh, and were pro
ducing from an egg to two eggs a day
each. Intelligence ot the loss was
immediately conveyed to her roya!
highness, by the cook ; the chickens
were a gift of the queen, and were in
tended to furnish soup for the princess
during the voyage; tne scono can be
better imagined than described. Seven
of the hens w'erc white, the others
were a dark chestnut: the rooster was
a dappled gray, Willi llowing mane and

in England, and cost her majesty two
dollars anu a nan in tne siieu. raiur

her royal highness much improved ; 1

somewhat during the voyage, but she
is now convalescing, ana it is confi

cover her accustomed health. Tho
rest of the party are well. The Duke
of Edinburgh visited the Sarmatian
immediately after her arrival and re
mained on board. The Duke is
hearty as a buck. The London Times
had no commissioner on board. The
Times is not feeling well.
P. S. During tne illness of the
princess, the doctor prescribed whisky
cocktails, gin-slings, mile and repeat,
for the Marquis. The rest of the party

Washington Letter to the Boston Journal.
When we left Philadelphia in the
early morning I noticed among the
passengers who had joined us there a
lady who had for some years past been
known here in Washington as " The
Oueen of tho Lobby." Age adds to
her personal charms, and I could but
notice her, as she sat gracetully yet
proudly as a throned sovereign, glanc
ing over the newspapers with her keen
gray eyes, and a purpose marked in
each line of her handsome face. 1 Of
course she was exquisitely attired, for
the soldier ot fortune, ot either sex,
must wear a gay, untarnished uniform
although the pockets may be empty.
At Laltimore every feature softened
as a i estern congressman came into
the car, and she gave him a joyous
greeting. Before we had left the
Monumental City the rural Represon

parlor, and when at the Relay House
