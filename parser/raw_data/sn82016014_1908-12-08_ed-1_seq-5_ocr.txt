Cincinnati, Dec. 8. The Cincinnati
Times-Star, of which Charles P. Taft
is editor and proprietor, today pub'
lished the following reply to the article
on the Panama canal which appeared
in the Indianapolis News and New
York World:
"The New York World, the paper
which was responsible for most of the
talk about the 'Panama canal scandal
during the recent campaign says this
morning:
" "Whether Douglas Robinson, who
is Mr. Roosevelt's brothei-in-la w, or
any of Mr. Taft's brothers associated
himself with Mr. Cromwell in Panama
exploitation or shared in these profits
is merely, incidental to the main issue
of letting in the light.'
"This statement is intentionally mis
leading. The Panama story was used
in the. campaign for political reasons
solely. The one thing that gave it
political value in the eyes of those
who used it was "the fact that the story
as printed carried the names of a
brother of the Republican candidate
for the presidency and of a brother-in-law
of the president. The inference
was plain enough. It was that Theo
dore Roosevelt and William H. Taft
had used their influence as hign offi
cials of the United States government
to help near relatives in looting the
treasury at Washington. That was the
meat of the story. If the names of
Douglas Robinson and Charles P. Taft
had not been included in it. flimsy and
absurd as it was. the lying yarn
would never have been used by the
World. But the World, the Indian
apolis News and other papers for one
reason or another wanted to defeat
Mr. Taft and discredit Mr. Roosevelt.
"The World is trying to dodge the issue
It wants to be relieved of the responsi
bility of trying to drag the names of Mr.
Robinson and Mr. Taft into its made-to-order
mess of scandal and slime.
"Both the World and the Indianapolis
News are crying 'let in the light." We
thoroughly agree with Them. But after a
little time has passed, after the most des
perate efforts of the World and News
have produced all the. evidence they can,
an apology will be in order from those
newspapers.
"In the meantime Mr. Taft reserves the
right to take legal steps, which possibly
have been made more desirable by the
events and insinuations of the past
hours."

Washington, Dec. 8. Interest in both
houses of congress centered today in
the president's message. Senator Aid
rich, on behalf of the senate commit
tee and Representative Payne for the
house committee, appointed to notify
the president that the two bodies were
in session informed their respective
houses that they had performed their
duty and each reported that the presi
dent had responded with a statement
that he would immediately submit a
message in writing. Secretary Latta
followed close upon the heels of the two
committees, appearing first in the sen
ate and then in the house. The read
ing of the message began in the sen
ate at 12:15, a quarter of an hour after
that body had convened and in the
house a few minutes later.
The galleries of both houses were well
filled and almost all the seats of sena
tors and members were occupied. ' All
of them were supplied with printed cop
ies of the message which contained an
elaborate appendix accompanied by
numerous illustrations showing the re
sults of the work of the forestry bureau.
Senators and members gave compara
tively little attention to the reading of
the message, but most of them immedi
ately busied themselves with the print
ed copies before them.
Cummins Sworn In.
Washington, Dec. 8. The senate met
promptly at noon today and after read
ing the journal Senator Doiliver pre
sented the credentials of Senator-elect
Albert B. Cummins of Iowa, and the
oath of office was administered.

Effort to Have Paragraphs stricken
From Wife's Petition Fails.
New York. Dec. 8. An attempt upon the
part of Frank Gould to have stricken
from his wife's complaint in the divorce
suit which she has filrd against him cer
tain paragraphs relating to gifts of jew
elry and other valuables 'to women failed
today when Justice Seabury denied a mo
tion made Dy liould s counsel. The mo
tion was based on the ground the state
ments contained in the paragraphs in
question had no relevancy to the charges
upon wnicn ine suit is oaseo.
Counsel for Mrs. Gould, however, con
tended that the statements were material
and that in the formal comr'aint to be
filed later it would he shown that the
gifts enumerated were gifts of induce
ment. Justice Seabury announced that
the complaint must startd-as made.
Mrs. Louise Farrar. the white wife
of A. C. Farrar, a negro formerly a
student at Washburn college, and a
member of the football team for two
seasons, was found dying in their home
at 418 "Van Buren street, at 2 o'clock
this afternoon.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon neighbors
were attracted to Farrar who was run
ning up and down the sidewalk in front
of his house wringing his hands and
crying that his wife was dead. Dr.
Keith was called and when he reached
the huse the woman was lying across a
bed fully dressed and still breathing.
She died a few moments later without
speaking.
Farrar said that he knew nothing
about the circumstances that led to
his wife's death. He said, that he was
working on a brick gang and when he
returned he found his wife on the bed
unconscious. '
There were no marks of carbolic acid
on the face of the woman and nothing
about her to indicate how she met her
death, though there was acid in the
house. Dr. Keith says that her face
was dark which indicates that she may
have been strangled.
The officers believe that the woman
met a violent death and they are con
ducting a searching investigation. An
autopsy will be made at once and until
then the cause of her death - will pro
bably not be known.
The marriage of this ill assorted cou
ple took place on November 7. the wo
man having been divorced from her
husband, a man named Keel. She had
a child 5 years old and had been keep
ing house for Farrar for three months
prior to their marriage. The marriage
took place as soon as the six months'
limit required by law after divorce had
expired.
Since the marriage neighbors say that
the couple have quarreled and fought
frequently.
Farrer's Statement.
Farrar said: "I came home to din
ner and the house was locked and my
little girl was trying to get in. I broke
the door in and smelled a strong odor
of carbolic acid. I found the bottle
about one-fourth full down stairs and
told the little girl to throw it in the
stove as I didn't want the stuff with
the children. Then the boy told me
his mamma was up stairs and I went
up there at once. She lay there on the
bed and was not quite dead but she
could not speak to me. I shook her
four or five times and then sent the lit
tle girl out for the neighbors and I
went and called a doctor. Dr. Keith

came and said that she did not take
carbolic acid but he didn't know what
she had taken. He sent me to the drug
store to see what she had bought and
they said she got carbolic acid and
turpentine, and nothing else. She left
no note. We have had some trouble
because she was jealous over what the
neighbors had said about me. They
said I had been running with other wo
men but I had not. Once she had a
moving van come to take away her
trunks and clothes but I persuaded her
to stay."
