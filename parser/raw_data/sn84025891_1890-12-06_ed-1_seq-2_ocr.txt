C, as Second Class mall matter.
"W. CALVIN CHASE, Editor,
Congress convened Monday
and begun work.
When thieveB fall out honest
men will get their dues.
When honest men fall out
thieves are some times benefited.
We are glad to know that the
Federal Election bill will become
a law.
Had the Senate passed the Fed
eral Election bill the House
would have been republican.
The editor of the Petersburg
Herald should not be so mouthy.
What ails you Matt?
We shall probably return to
our new office on or about
the 24th of this month.
Miller should be seated and il
the next Democratic House can
afford not to give him his seat,
the Democratic party is capable ol
doiDg anything.
In this weeks iBsue or the Bee
appears the first letter of Louise
to Clara. It is our intention to
coufiue the writter strictly to so
cial aud hauBehold matters.
A "Triumvirate" iB a hateful
combination to a fellow who has
labored zealously to be a member
of it, but failed for want of capaci
ty to "get there Eli."
There will be a change in the
High School next year and it is
thought that Prof. Browne will be
appointed. The tax payers are
tired of supporting aliens. Let
ua have home rule.
t
.
a .
cry of the race, therace" is the laBt
refuge of a pygmy wno nnds nim
eelf over matched by giants.
"It is not in our stars, but in
ourselves, dear Brutus, that we are
underlings," Shakespeare was a
marvelous judge of men and the
above quotation commends itself
with frightful force to the "Great
Disappointed Disgruntled of to
day. Oh, the Triumvirate !
'Natute makes the marble, man
makes the stature." But what
shall we do with a man who with
plenty of marble around him, has
no capacity for statue making?
Such a man though he may deplore
his want of artistic ralent, should
not spend his time growling at the
real sculptors. Oh, the Triumvi
rate. Bishop H. M. Turner, of the A,
M. E, Church, declared in a recent
address, that President Harrison
had appointed a greater number
of colored men to important offi.
ceB, thau any mnn who had ever
occupied the Preaidental Chair.
"Let the Great Disappointed
Disgruntled" smoke this in his
pipe.
HE AGAIN URGES ACTION.
In my last annual message I suggested
that the development ol the existing law
providing a Federal supervision of Con
gressional elections oflered and effective
method of reforming these abuses. The
need of such a law has manifested itself
in many parts of the country, and its
wholesome restraints and penaltias will
be useful in all. President Harrison's
Message.
More than once has the Presi
dent called the attention of Con
gress to the necessity of enacting
adequate legislation for the pro
tection of the citizens in the exer
cise of the suffrage, but strane-e as
it may seem, Congress has not
heretofore acted upon these well
tuned suggestions. But our eolons,
to their credit be it said, haye at
last been aroused and we feel con
fident that they will now do their
full duty.
DONT LOSE THE CHANCE.
Whenever an opportunity is of
fered the colored people they should
do all in their power to embrace it.
Lota are being rapidly sold at Bow
ie, Md., for $100 and if you want a
bargain don't fail to call and see
the plat. If you purchase now you
can get a choice lot for 8100, bat if
you don't purchase now you will
have to pay $300. Your " title is
guaranteed and we advise you all
to purchase now. Call at this of
fice or call and see Mr. Campbell
Carrington.
HE DEMANDS EQUALITY
FOE, ALL MEN.
Equality of representation and the par
ity of the electors must be maintained, or
everything that is valuable in our system
of government is lost. The qualifications
of an elector must be sought in the law,
not in the opinions, prejudice?, or fears of
any class, however powerful. The path of
the elector to the ballot-box must be free
from the ambush of fear and th entice
ments of fraud; the countsotrue and open
that none shall gainsay it. President's
Message.
2S"o president, since the immor
tal Lincoln, has uttered braver
words than these; and no President
has ever exhibited greater solici
tude for the oppressed Afro-American.
Ko President has ever been
confronted with graver difficulties
in times of peace; and no President
has ever exhibited more capacity
and courage in dealing with great
problems. Go on, Pivsideut Benj
amin Harrison! The Afro-Americans
of the United States will stand
by you.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's recent message
to Congress is one of the most re
markable public documents that
has appeared for a long time and
the comments of the daily press of
the country shows the general fa
vor with which it has been receiv
ed. The Republican press endors
ed it with enthusiasm, while the
democrats are compelled to admit
tnat it is a paper of rare merit. It
presents and discusses with clear
ness and force all the great issues
now before the country, and calls
upon Congress to enact the Ingisla
tion necessary in the premises.
He urges Congress to pass the
Federal .Election bill to secure free
aud fair elections throughout the
country, and to protect every citi
zen be he black or whitein the
exercise of his perogatives. He
recommends in language not to be
misunderstood, that there shall be
stand ny its colors. Tne effect ot
this message is already seen in the
action of the Senate, in taking up
by a unanimous vote the Election
Bill which was carried over from
last session. It is clear that under
the fearless leadership of President
Harrison, the Congress now in ses
sion will accomplish greater results
before the 4th day ot March, 1891.
LYNCH vs. TOWNSEND.
Our esteemed Fourth Auditor,
Mr. Lynch, lost his temper in his
reply to Dr. Townsend and beggr
ed the question in his report to
Ex-Governor Kellogg. Mr. Lynch
lost the beat opportunity of his
life; he failed to show the strong
points in the administration; he
failed to show the great work
that had been accomplished bv
President Harrison since he ha's
been President. While Mr. Lynch
meant well his argument was
weak. Why did'nt Mr. Lynch
show beyond all doubt that Presi
dent Harrison has made more
Negro appointments than any
President that has ever occupied
the Executive chair; why didn't
he Bhow that it was President
Harrison who favored the passage
of the Blair Educational bill.
which would have educated mil
lions of ignorant people; why
didn't Mr. Lynch show that Presi
dent Harrisou was the father of
the Jederel Election bill and that
he wanted it to become a law to
protect all classes of voters in the
United States.
There were but few of the many
noble acta of this administration
showed up and since it was the
intention and desire of Mr. Lynch
to defend the administration, he
should have embraced it in the
opportunity that was given to him
in his reply to Ex-Governnr TToi.
loeg.
There is a wav for Mr. T.vnoh
to differ from Mr. TownBend and
we are of the opinion that Mr.
Lynch lost his case and injured
himself. Of course we disagree
with Eecorder Townsend; we
know that Mr. Harrison is a noble
man and we are surprised at Mr.
Townsend whom we met at the
Executive Mansion about one
year ago and he said to ua in the
presence of Sect'y., Halford, that
he hoped that the colored people
would not be too hard on the
President, but have a little pa
tience. Does Recorder Townsend
remember thoae remarks? Mr.
Lynch is only doing what you
advocated one year ago, Mr.
Townsend; you said then that the
President would do more for our
people.. Has not the President
done mre Mr. Townsend? What
is Mr. Townsend sore about? He
wanted a bigger office or one with
more salary attached to it; and
failing to get it he is kicking
against the administration. Bro.
Townsend endeavored to bull
doze the administration a tew
months ago by sending a letter to
Mr. Harrison threatening to re
sign, if he was not given a better
office. In this same letter Bro.
Townsend attacked Mesars. Doug
lass, and Lynch, but, he was ad
vised to leave out the attack on
these men, as it would injure his
case.
Recorder Townend followed the
ins'ruction of his friends and
struck out the abusive attack on
these gentlemen. Mr. Townsend
asked for a great many things in
that letter that he didn't not get;
the main favor he asked was a
better office for hiraBelf.
It is not the lTegro race that
Mr. lownaend wants to see elevat
ed; it is not the disappointed (?)
office seekers in whom Mr. Towns
end is interested; it is more sala
ry or a bigger office for James
M. Townsend and it is he who is
playing the role of the hyprocrite.
We challenge Mr. Townsend to a
denial of our charges; and any re
ply that he wishes to make the
columns of the Bee are open to
him.
THE RICHMOND DIVINE. (?)
Rev.(?) W. W. Browne, of Rich
mond, Va., who claims to control
the colored of this city can be put
down as a natural borne bombast.
When he attempts to send a man
from Richmond to dictate to the
citizens he will find out that he has
bitten off more than he chew. His
organization known as the True
Reformers will be, in a few days,
remembered as a thing of the past.
Hisgreat mistake was his unwar
ranted attack on Rev. Robert
Johnson, a man whom we all re
nn"n nnA n rlivinQ in urhnm thft
ueai mure eiauurateiy wnii the
Bichmond Reformer who has at
tempted to invade our cityand cause
disention among some oar best cit
izens. GIRLS BEHIND THE COUNTER.
If I were to asked to give a set
of rules or suggestions for girls
whose days are spent behind the
counter, they would read some
thing like this :
Remember that all the time
spent in the store belongs to your
employer.
That courtesy behind the counter
wins even the most captious cus
tomers. That gossip about young men, or
with them, is unbusinesslike, and
unuer tne circumstances, rude.
Never attempt to instruct a cus
tomer; while you may suggest, or
politely question, the desirability
of this or that.
Do not say, "Here Sade, hand
me your pencil," to your neighbor
Never say, "No, we haven't got
it," in a short, crisp tone: far better
a polite "I am sorry to say we do
not have it in stock."
Do not thrust a package at a
customer as you would a pistol in
the face of a highwayman.
Never throw down goods with an
air which seems to say, "I do not
care whether vou buv if. nr nnt
Remember that the purchaser
often sees more in the seller than
she thinks, and refined young
women have made valuable friends
for life by their courtesy to an
accomplished customer.
Always remember, that duty to
your employer demands your best
service, and duty to yourself also.
Seek to be a model saleswoman,
and some one will sonn rnonani
your merits.
Dress modestly and avoid cheap
jewelry, the best ornaments are:
promptness, politeness, a well-mod-ulated
voice, and strict attention to
duty.
Have your hair neatly combed,
your teeth well brushed and your
finger-nails tidy. Customers are
uneu repeuau oy untidy clerks of
either sex.
Remember always, that you are
superior to circumstances, only
when you make yourself so. The
most selfish, exacting employer will
gladly recognize the merita of an
efficient clerk.
Frown down with womanly scorn
the nonsenical title of "saleslady.'
It is a gran4 thing to be a woman
anything; if you are a true and
good woman, a good clerk is infin
itely more respectable then a so
called "saleslady," and the term
has a sboddyish ring which is totally
un-American.
Out of two hundred clerks in a
large establishment, the favorite
with nearly all of the customers,
is a young woman wno invariably
dresses modestly in black, and has
such charming manners that it is a
positive pleasure to visit her de
partment. Kate Tannatt Woods,
in Ladies' Home Journal,
