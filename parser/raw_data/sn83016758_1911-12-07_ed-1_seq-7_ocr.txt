the disturbance to business that would
probably attend the dissolution of these
offending trusts. I said:
"But such an investigation and pos
sible prosecution of corporations whose
prosperity or destruction affects the
comfort not only of stockholders, but
of millions of wage earners, employees
and associated tradesmen, must neces
sarily tend to disturb the confidence
of the business community, to dry up
the now flowing sources of capital
from its places of hoarding and pro
duce ft halt in our present prosperity
that will cause suffering and strained
circumstances among the innocent
many for the faults of the guilty few
The question which I wish in this
message to bring clearly to the con
sideration and discussion of congress
is whether, in order to avoid such a
possible business danger, something
cannot be done by which these busi
ness combinations may be offered a
means, without great financial dis
turbance, of changing the character,
organization and extent of their busi
ness into one within the lines of the
law under federal control and super
vision, securing compliance with the
anti-trust statute
"Generally in the industrial combina
tions called 'trusts' the principal bus.i
ness is the sale of goods in many states
and in foreign marketsin other words,
the interstate and foreign business far
exceeds the business done in any one
state. This fact will justify the fed
eral government in granting a federal
charter to such a combination to make
and sell in interstate and foreign com
merce the products of useful manufac
ture under such limitations as will se
cure a compliance with the anti-trust
law. It is possible so to frame a stat
ute that, while it offers protection to a
federal company against harmful, vex
atious and unnecessary invasion by the
states, it shall subject it to reasona
ble taxation and control by the states
with respect to its purely local busi
ness.
"Corporations organized under this
act should be prohibited from acquir
ing and holding stock in other corpo
rations (except for special reasons,
upon approval by the proper federal
authority), thus avoiding the creation
under national auspices of the holding
company with subordinate corporations
In different states, which has been
such an effective agency in the crea
tion of the great trusts and monopo
lies.
"If the prohibition of the anti-trust
act against combinations in restraint
trade is to be effectively enforced
it is essential that the national govern
ment shall provide for the creation of
national corporations to carry on ale
gitimate business throughout the Unit
ed States. The conflicting laws of the
different states of the Union with re
spect to foreign corporations make it
difficult, if not impossible, for one cor
poration to comply with their require
ments so as to carry on business in a
number of different states
I renew the recommendation of the
enactment of a general law providing
for the voluntary formation of cor
porations to engage in trade and com
merce among the states and with for
eign nations. Every argument which
was then advanced for such a law and
every explanation which was at that
time offered to possible objections has
been confirmed by our experience since
the enforcement of the anti-trust stat
ute has resulted in the actual dissolu
tion of active commercial organiza
tions
It is even more manifest now than
it was then that the denunciation of
conspiracies in restraint of trade
should not and does not mean the de
nial of organizations large enough to
be intrusted with our interstate and
foreign trade. It has been made more
clear now than it was then that a
purely negative statute like the anti
trust law may well be supplemented
by specific provisions for the building
up and regulation of legitimate na
tional and foreign commerce
Government Administrative Experts
Needed to Ad Courts In Trust
Dissolutions.
The drafting of the decrees in the
dissolution of the present trusts, with
a view to their reorganization into le
gitimate corporations, has made it es
pecially apparent that the courts are
not provided with the administrative
machinery to make the necessary in
quiries preparatory to reorganization
or to pursue such inquiries, and they
should be empowered to Invoke the
aid of the bureau of corporations in
determining the suitable reorganiza
tion of the disintegrated parts. The
circuit court and the attorney general
were greatly aided in framing the de
cree In the tobacco trust dissolution by
an expert from the bureau of corpora
tions. Federal Corporation Commission Pro
posed.
I do not set forth in detail the terms
and sections of a statute which might
supply the constructive legislation per
mitting and aiding the formation of
combinations of capital into federal
corporations. They should be subject
to rigid rules as to their organization
and procedure. Including effective pub
licity, and to the closest supervision as
to the issue of stock and bonds by an
executive bureau or commission in the
department of commerce and labor, to
which in times of doubt they might
well submit their proposed plans for
future business. It must be distinctly
understood that incorporation under a
federal law could not exempt the com
pany thus formed and its Incorporators
and managers from prosecution under
the anti-trust law for subsequent il
legal conduct, but the publicity of its
procedure and the opportunity for fre
quent consultation with the bureau or
commission in charge of the incorporr.
tion as to the legitimate purpose of it
transactions would offer it as great *P
curity against successful prosecution^
St.
BOGUS BROOK.
THE PRINCETON UNION: THUBSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1911.
for violations of the law as would be
practical or wise.
Such a bureau or commission might
well be invested also with the duty
already referred to of aiding courts
In the dissolution and recreation of
trusts within the law. It should be an
executive tribunal of the dignity and
power of the comptroller of the cur
rency or the interstate commerce com
mission, which now exercises supervis
ory power over important classes of
corporations under federal regulation.
The drafting of such a federal in
corporation law would offer ample op
portunity to prevent many manifest
evils in corporate management today.
Including irresponsibility of control in
the hands of the few who are not the
real owners.
Incorporation Voluntary.
I recommend that the federal char
ters thus to be granted shall be volun
tary, at least until experience justifies
mandatory provisions. The benefit to
be derived from the operation of great
businesses under the protection of such
a charter would attract all who are
anxious to keep within the lines of the
law. Other large combinations that
fail to take advantage of the federal
incorporation will not have a right to
complain if their failure is ascribed to
unwillingness to submit their transac
tions to the careful official scrutiny,
competent supervision and publicity
attendant upon the enjoyment of such
a charter
Only Supplemental Legislation Needed.
The opportunity thus suggested for
federal incorporation, it seems to me,
is suitable constructive legislation
needed to facilitate the squaring of
great industrial enterprises to the rule
of action laid down by the anti-trust
law. This statute as construed by the
supreme court must continue to be the
line of distinction for legitimate busi
ness. It must be enforced unless we
are to banish individualism from all
business and reduce it to one common
system of regulation or control of
prices like that which now prevails
with respect to public utilities and
which when applied to all business
would be a long step toward state so
cialism
Importance of the Anti-trust Act.
The anti trust act is the expression
of the effort of a freedom loving peo
ple to preserve equality of opportunity.
It is the result of the confident deter
mination of such a people to maintain
the future growth by preserving un
controlled and unrestricted the enter
prise of the mdhidual his industry,
his in^enultj his intelligence and his
independent courage
For twentv 5 ears or more this stat
ute has been upon the statute book.
All knew its general purpose and ap
proved Many of its violators were
cynical over its assumed impotence.
It seemed impossible of enforcement.
Slowly the mills of the courts ground,
and only gradually did the majesty of
the law assert itself. Many of its
statesmen-authors died before it be
came a living force, and they and oth
ers saw the evil grow which they had
hoped to destroy Now its efficacy Is
seen now Its power Is heavy now tts
object is near achievement Now we
hear the call for its repeal on the plea
that it interferes with business pros
perity, and we are advised in most
general terms how by some other stat
ute and in some other way the evil
we are just stamping out can be cured
if we only abandon this work of twen
ty years and try another experiment
for another term of years.
It is said that the act has not done
good Can this be said In the face of
the effect of the Northern Securities
decree? That decree was In no way
so drastic or inhibitive in detail as ei
ther the Standard Oil decree or the
tobacco decree. But did it not stop
for all time the then powerful move
ment toward the control of all the
railroads of the country in a single
hand? Such a one man power could
not have been a healthful influence in
the republic, even though exercised
under the general supervision of an
interstate commission.
Do we desire to make such ruthless
combinations and monopolies lawful?
When all energies are directed, not to
ward the reduction of the cost of pro
duction for the public benefit by a
healthful competition, but toward new
ways and means for making perma
nent in a few hands the absolute con
trol of the conditions and prices pre
vailing In the whole field of industry,
then individual enterprise and effort
will be paralyzed and the spirit of
commercial freedom will be dead
