GROWING OF THE OHUHOH COOKS.
If there aro any politicians or other
persons in this vicinity who have cher
ished tho delusion that wo had a po
litical election horo on the third day of
November Inst, they must wako up to
their mistake on reading the explana
tion of that; election mndo by Elder
Charles W. Fcnrnso of infamous noto
riety hero, as republished in the Dcscrot
News of last Saturday evening. It
was not a political eloctiou, it seems,
but a vindication of tho Mormon
church, tho vindicntor being tho "Re
publican" party, its triumph being tho
church triumph over its "enemies."
This conclusion is renched by Elder
Penrose upon tho lying assumption that
tho church was being attacked. It
also carries tho necessary imputation
that any Mormon voter who refused to
voto tho local "Republican" ticket,
was "a traitor to his church," as de
clared' at the notorious Morris inflam
mation in tho Sixteenth ward meeting
house just prior to election day. It
also declares that thoso who voted tho
"Republican" ticket did so for church
and uot political purposes. How this
arrangement of tho 'lines will suit the
Mormon Democrats who stood by their
political part-, and thoso non-Mormon
Republicans who had no dosiro for
church service, how thoy will relish this
parting of tho sheep from tho goats
remains to bo seen.
The tact that there was no warfaro
upon anj" church; that the only possi
ble theory upon which such a warfaro
could be based is that the church is
determined to fight to rotain its
usurpations in politics aud civil affairs,
is absolutely ignored, ovaded, or twist
ed into false relations by Elder Pen
rose. This, of course, is naturnlly to
havo been expected from him. Wo aro
all accustomed to his falsehoods, his
impudence, aud unscrupulousness in
matt oi-s of this sort. But there is not
the least confusion in the public mind
here on tho question.
The Mormon church leaders have
usurped control of tho political and
civil affairs of Utah of the State, of
tho counties, of the municipalities. The
American party challenges their right
to do this, and demands that the church
confine itself to its proper sphere, aud
let politics and civil affairs alone.
These church leaders refuso this de
mand, and raise an outcry- that their
church is attacked and they themselves
'abused and persecuted because tho
American party demands that politics
and civil affairs be left free from hie
rarchical control. Tho church must
rule or it is being attacked and perse
cuted, is their viow. It follows neces
sarily that the church's fight in this
is not against attack, but to sccuro
itself in its usurpations of power to
.which it has no business to aspire. All
that the American party asks, or ever
has asked, it that tho church obey the
constitution of tho Stato, which de
clares for the complete separation of
church and stato; that this separation
bo made a fact, instead of a hollow
pretense, that tho pledtrcs of honor
made voluntarily by the church lenders
in order to obtain Statehood, be kept,
and that all shall obey the law.
It is idle to mouth complaints that
this is attacking the church, unless the
church is prepared to plead guilty to
all that Tho Tribune has charged upon
its leaders. But if it does so plead,
then it has no standing before a candid
.public. While if it does not so plead,
it lias not the shadow of a caso in
claiming that tho church is attacked.
Elder Penrose urges that the part'
lines bo obliterated here until the
church supremacy in politics nnd civil
affairs is so firmly established that it
can never again be resisted. This is
the clear intent of his "counsel" for
the church voters to ignore all olsc in
the citj election next year, and unite
to wipo the American party- off tho face
of the earth. But we givo notice to
all concerned that such a programme as
that can never win in Salt Lake. And
no matter how dearly tho church ec
clesiastical despots may desire to re
lain their tyrannous power, that power
is already doomed, it can never sur
vive in a State of the American Union,
in this free Republic and in this en
lightened age.
ANNIVEESASY INDEPENDENT.
Tt is like the reappearance of a former
life to soe this anniversary number of
the Independent, issued December 10th,
the sixtieth anniversary of flic estab
lishment of that groat, populnr, and in
fluential newspaper. It was established
as a weekly, in the usual form of news
papers. Tt is still a weekly, but in
niagazinc form. And it ban always
been, in whatever form, in the forefront
of American thought, always for free
dom, always for loyalty, always for
the highest Christian morality, always
for tho best in clean and ctTcctivfc gov
ernmenl.
This number is' a very large one. It'
carries many republications from its
pages of years gone by, nnd it repro
duces portraits of its chief and as
sistant editors during the sixty years
of its publication. If is frank in criti
cising tho courso of some of these, and
not. without reason, this being especially
true of the editorship of Theodoro Til
ton. But all in all, no publication in
tho country has been for so long con
sistent in good works and right princi
ples as the Independent. It has always
been brave, outspoken when silence
might have boon more profitable tempo
rarily; but in tho long run its coura
geous course has led to a higher confi
dence in it by tho great conscientious,
discerning public; and this in tho long
run brought the bettor nnd richer profit.
To road of those old editors, to recall
tho tromendous importance of 'their in
fluoncc upon tho public, aud to hoar
again thoso trumpet notes for liberty,
is inspiring to the heart, and encourag
ing to thoso of us hero in Utah who in
a smaller way aro fighting the snmc bat
tle for freedom of thought and of indi
vidualism that was fought by' thoso Na
tional heroes on tho broader field of the
whole Union. Thoy fought against tho
merciless barbarism of slavery; we nro
fighting against a tyranneous ccclcsi
asticism which is oven a grcntcr curse
to tho civic life of the community by its
imposition of a ruthless and unscrupu
lous tyranny than was tho cruder evil
of human slavery. Wo havo since tho
days long before tho War of the Re
bellion been an ndmiring reader of tho
Independent, and arc still; and wo
foci that this anniversary number is re
freshing to the soul.
TIERCE PANAMA OUTBREAK.
Wo ennnot but think that President
Roosevelt, in pursuing the Panama
canal stories to the point, of threaten
ing criminal libel suits against those
who have started tho stories about graft
in connection with tho Panama canal
purchase and work, is pounding a corpse.
It is practically certain that tho Amer
ican public receives his statement and
denial of this vholo matter iu pro
cisely tho spirit in which he offered it,
and as conclusive on tho wholo ques
tion at issue. It is quito impossible to
conceivo of any graft in this country
in connection with tho $10,000,000 pur
chaso of tho rights of the French com
panies in that enterprise. It is equally
impossible to conceivo of any graft or
fraud of any kind iu pursuauce of tho
work which "tho United States has done
on tho Isthmus sinco that purchase.
Evcrylhiug has been open and above
board, tho commission has mado reports
from timo to time covering every opera
tion, both iu general and in detail. All
charges to the contrary have fallen to
the ground, and tho public is entirely
satisfied with the President's siatcmout.
At the same time, if the minority mem
bers iu Congress think that thcro is any
reason for a continued investigation of
that matter, there surely should bo no
objectipn to it. And very likely it
would be just as well to lako up that
investigation, whero it was left off by
Senator Morgan and push it to a con
clusion. It will bo remembered hy thoso
who took an interest in this mnttcr
that tho friction betwocn Senator Mor
gan and William Nelson Cromwell, coun
sel for tho Panama Canal company,
caused a sudden break in the pursuit of
tho inquiries. There was a good deal of
acerbity on the part of Sonator Morgan
and n good deal of peremptory resent
ment on the part of Mr. Cromwell.
In this connection the absoluto de
nial and dotnilcd explanation printed in
Friday morning's Tribune from Mr.
Cromwell should really set at rest nil
talk about fraud, graft, or collusiou on
tho part of Americans. Mr. Cromwell's
letter iu tho New York -World which he
refers to we did not see, but he quotes
it with strong effect in this statement
now made. He completely exculpates
every one in this country from tho re
ceipt of any money under that ncgotia
tiou of the $10,000,000 sale, excepting,
of course, his own counsel fee, which is
reported to have been very great; how
much has not been disclosed. We recol
lect it having been stated, on what
authority wo do not know, nt a million
dollars. And in view of the inimeuso in
terests involved, perhaps that would not
be an especially exorbitant fee, because
it probably necessitated the expendi
ture of a largo amount of money to got
mattors in shape, and the sum of money
may havo included expenditures in
France, as well as at the Isthmus and
in this country.
Mr. Cromwell goes into particulars as
to tho history of the Pannma canal
transfers in Franco, showing just how
the money was paid, how accounted for,
and tho action in detail of tho two
French companies. Tho number of
stockholders in the old company was,
as Mr. Cromwell says, very largo; they
got a more percentage on what they had
put in. Thoso who organized the new
Panama Canal company, however, ap
pear to have lost nothing. But it was
all done publicly and under (ho guidanco
aud control of tho French courts. The
reports made, both with respect to the
dealings with tho old company and with
tho new, aro fully set forth, and the do
tail of all the payments is publicly
accessible. All this being so, it would
appear as if the investigation which is
proposed in Congress should tako tho
form now of sonding for copies of those
records and details, or elso having somo
expert or sub-committee go to Franco,
make an examination of all of those
reports and accounts, and if anything
is found therein of any special interest
to the American people,: havo that
transcribed and reported by the in
vestigating committee.
So far as tho American sido of theso
negotiations is concerned, tho air seems
altogether cleared, and thero seems
nothing remaining to inquire into, ex
cept the settlements and payments as
. shown by tho records in France. For
the most pari doubtless theso would con
tain no interest to tho American people.
It would be of no value in this country
to find out how much each ono of the
226,290 stockholders of tho old French
company received. The settlements
with the stockholders of the new French
Panama Canal company, numbering
6700, were not completed until Juno of
the present year. But now the wholo
transaction is completed, the records
written up, and the accounts closed. Tho
stockholders in this now company ap
pear to havo fared pretty well; they
got back nil tho money they put into
tho company, with a very small amount
of interest. Tho organization of tho
new company may havo been necessary
under the French law and practice to
protect tho interests of the old stock
holders, as that company had gone into
liquidation and was practically defunct.
Wo eoo no renson to supposo that Jhcro
was any graft or anything improper in
this wholo transaction, even in Frnnce,
although the completer investigation
might possibly dovelop something of
thaL kind. Still, as wo have said here
tofore, it, would probably be better to
tako up tho investigation whero Sonator
Morgan dropped it and, by a complete (
exposition of the wholo matter,. put a j
quietus on every charge that has beeu
mado of irrcgulnrity or graft in this i
connection. And whilo tho investiga- !
tion is on, porhaps it would bo as well
to take up and report upon tho pay
mont of .10,000,000 to the Panama
government, for whilo this Nation prob
ably had nothing to do with that gov
ernment's action in any way, Mr. Crom
woll brings this matter in also, and it
would bo woll to havo a clean-up all
around whilo wo nro in this iaivcstiga
tion business.
MORE CHURCH ORGAN LYING.
Wo have just boon calling tho church
organ to account for an outrageous,
scandnlous, and easily-exposed lio about
Tho Tribune. U said, in discussing the
attitude of this paper toward tho "red
light district" that, we did not con
demn Chief of Polico Pitt's recommenda
tion of last January iu favor of the city
establishing such a district, "until
later." This was mcaut to convoy to
its readers the idea that at first wo
received that recommendation with
complaisance and did not turn against
it until we had occasiou to change our
views. Wo showed this to bo a willful
falsehood; wo proved that the very day
on which we first saw that recommenda
tion wo denounced it uncompromisingly
and unqualifiedly, and that this denun
ciation appeared editorially in The
Tribuuo tho morning after the Pitt
recommendation appeared; in fact, as
early as it could have appeared. And
yet tho church organ stolidly and in
utter disregard of truth and conscience,
persists iu its lie.
Again, wo reported a little over a
month ago a conversation had nt
Sugar House ward by Georgo C.
Smith, a son of President Joseph F.
Smith, in which that son mado tho as
sertion that Elder Brigham II. Roberts
was on the road to apostasy, and that
he was ready to lead a mob to kill the
older Smith, tho president of the church.
Tho church organ viciously denied this,
assailiug Tho Tribuno with a lot of
billingsgate for. printing such a "false
hood." But on looking about a little
tho church organ found out that the
story was true. -Yet it never cleared its
skirts of the Ho it told in denying it.
Now tho church orgau is brought to
book for printing a deliberately cooked
up and dirty falsehood charging tho
police with misconduct and neglect of
duty iu .their connection with the case
of Mrs. Waldon, a einzy woman. It
appears not only to be a case of con
cocted falsehood, but ont for. its own
glorification at tho expense of the po
lice department. Arid yet we do not
expect any rotractiou in this case any
more than in tho others, and iu many
mor which it would be easy to cite.
And what a disreputable, conscioenoo
less, depraved, and willful falsifier tho
hardened old organ is! What a scan
dalous thing it is to have such a dis
credited sheet the organ of a church!
AUDACIOUS PRESUMPTUOUSNESS.
The day will conic whon tho United
States Government, and all others, will
be uprooted, and the kingdoms of this
world will bi united Into ono. and the
kingdom of our God will govern the whole
earth, and boar unlvorsnl sway; and no
power beneath tltu heavciiK can prevent
this taking place. From sonneni of Apos
tle Orson Pralt In Salt Lako bowory. July
ft. JSr.5: Journal of Discourses, volume
pa go 71.
If, is acknowledged by Mormon
writers and speakers that iiad it not.
beeu for tho eslnldishnicul of thh Gov
ernment the Church of Jesus Christ, of
Latter-day Saints could not havo boon
founded. Tho constitutional guarantco
of liberty iu religious belief and wor
ship mado possible tho institution of tho
peculiar tenets of Mormonism; and
yet thcro is a steady determination in
the church to defy and destroy that
which protected the organization in its
infancy.
It is true that Apostle Orson Pratt
was ono of tho most persistent pro
ponents of theocratic government, and
that sometimes his views upon this sub
ject woro not agreed to entirely by
all of bis coadjutors of the hierarchy;
but it is also a fact that his expres
sions and deductions woro logically truo
to tho fundamental principles iu which
tho foundations of Mormonism were
laid. While those differences of viow
obtained as against tho Pratt elucida
tions concerning the oventunl sway of
"tho kingdom of God," no ono among
the higher of the high priesthood dared
to tako up a controversy with him
upon tho. matter. His conclusions woro
logicnl, when "the lav, and tho testi
mony" were brought forward in proof,
and those of his ecclesiastical associates
who failed to agree with him wore
forced to silence in this respect.. Thoso,
however, were few, because tho majority
of the hierarchy woro so enamored of
their imagined destiny in greatness and
power that they agreed iu and advo
cated tho theory of universal sway out
of pure self-gratification.
President p.righnm Young wasTTu able
seconder of tho Pratt doctrine. His
lovo of authority (in himself) could be
no better, gratified than in nn announced
pretense that he was choson of heaven
to rule the world; and ho had an idea
that his ascension to a world throne
was near at hand he expected to begin
his nnivcrsial reign iu the llesh. So
ho was quo of the most enthusiast iu
advocntcs of tho Pratt theocratic idea.
After him camo John Taylor, who was
ono of tho most ferocious promoters of
tho despotic theory that the Mormou
clrurch nas ever had. Tl.cn ho was suc
ceeded by Wilford Woodruff milder
l
11 at,
and more rinccro. bu- nevertheless firm i
in his belief concerning tho final and
ull-covering triumph of "tho kingdom
of God." Lorenzo Snow, who suc
ceeded Wilford Woodruff, was more
diplomatic, and yet more firm, in his
promulgation of the same idea; and
were it not for the brevity of his in
cumbency of tho prophetic office doubt
less we should havo had greater evi
dence of his adherence to tho doctrine.
Joseph F. Smith, thp present head of
tho Mormon church and successor to
Lorenzo Snow, is irrevocably committed
to this seditious leaching. It may bo
said of him, and truthfully, that of
all tho Mormon lenders siuco the. first,
ho is tho most arrogrtnt nnd unscrupu
lous in this respect. Tnking advan
tage of the beginnings mncto by those
who went beforo him, ho is utilizing
ovory fiber of tho church being to pro
moto in actual practico tho theocratic
government which tho others put for
ward in word for tho most part. Under
the guiso of a protended .religion, fos
tored and protected by the United
States Government, ho is setting up this
kingdom that ho imagines is to over
throw all the republics and monarchies
of earth. Froin-inlorfcronca with state
affairs down . to knitting stockings he
is intruding his ccclosinstical activities.
Nothing in this intermouulaiu region
is exempt from his impudent nosing;
and whilo Tho Tribuuo knows that ho
will fail of his purposo in the end, it
will only bo when the pooplo of this
country arouse themselves lo a realiza
tion of tho menace existing in hi3
trcnsonablo pursuits. Tile fellow,
Sharp, who created the fatal trouble
at Kansas City, is not anywhere near
the fanatic that Smith is, nnd some
day tho country 'will awnken to tho
fact that it is nursing a viper to its
bosom.
In Philadelphia, tho board of educa
tion has designated the particular !
Christmas carols that may bo sung in i
the public schools, eliminating all that
mako reforence to tho . divinity of j
Christ. It. may bo thought that this is I
drawing things somewhat fine, but it j
is impossiblo to exorciso loo much care i
in making tho schools non-sectarian. j
Abo Rucf has all along expressed the
fear that he would bo uiiublo to get jus
tice in San Francisco. Now that ho has
been found guilty ho nfliy experience
calm repose in tho thought that he is
in a fair wav to got it at last.
