We understand now why the Demo

of the house. . He can't see what they

The secretary of war sees no good
reason why the war department should
place the flag at half-mast in honor of

North can see many good reasons why
it should not. -Det. Tribune.
Gov. Luce has returned from Cali
fornia, and his first official act after
coming home was to appoint ex-State

Helknap, resigned. ;
During iho last state general elec

There was one rascal who didn't
wait to be turned out. Cashier Sil

the house turned himself out, taking

receiving the congratulations of other
Democrats who are there for the same
kind of health. Dtt. Tribune.
Those who are always talking about
the degeneracy of business and pre

made very happy to read the state

Of the 84,031 votes cast for governor
in Mississippi the Democrat candidate

about it. Anybody can see that they
are open to the charge of trying to in
cite another "negro insurrection."

In declining to honor the memory of
Jeff Davis m a former secretary of
war, by a public display, Secretary
Proctor behaved very sensibly. It
would have stirred up bitter feeling for
jjo useful purpose. The Cleveland
administration might probably have
been in power but for one or two "bad
breaks," like the "rebel flag" order, the
half-mast Hag for Tacob Thompson,
and the harsh language of the pension
vetoes. Dtt. Journal.
The Minneapolis Tribune-Star,
(Ind.) agrees with the Times regardiug
the president's message. It says:
"President Harrison's first message to
congress is plain, vigorous and practi
cal like a lawyer's brief. No attempt
is made at fine .writing, and the docu
ment hardly rises to eloquence in any
portion. 13ut the recommendations
are for the most part sensible." "Day

'The! Ex-conftfderate veterans of
New Orleans, are said to be much
pleased at the remark of Capt. Jacob
Gray of the Grand Army last Saturday
night. He said that Jeff Davis had
been a vatuabla soldier and an honest
purs man, and if it were agreed to
have his body carried by veterans he
should be proud to be one of them."
He should be kicked out of every
Post of the Grond Army or Veteran's
Association, with which he is connect
ed, as one of tho precepts of the order
Is Loyally.
The remains of Jeilerson Davis, the
arch traitor, and leader in the late re
bellion were deposited in their last
resting place, yesterday. It would
have been better for the country, of
which he was not even a citizen, being
disfranchised, that he did not die on
the saiuo scaffuld with his faithful
henchman, the brutal Win. If Satan
does not give him a warm welcome, as
a reward for causing ihe death of from
150,000 to 200,000 of our brave boyw,
who wore the blue, by starvation, we
will miss our guess. Democrats all
over the land are vieing with each
other as to who can pay the
body the most attention. The people
of the South, without exception, are
grieving as much over the death of their
late babbler of treason as was shown
by the people of the North at the death
of Lincoln. But as he was the Apos
tle of treason, free trade and all the
crimes in the political oategory,
which are believed and carried out in
the South, his loss to them from the
wail of woe with which the dally pa
pers are filled, his death must have cre
ated a void that Mills, Vest or McCoy
cannot fill.' The party is the same the
couutrv over, for a convict sent to the
penitentiary for forging election re
turns, or fraud of any kind in regard
to elections is no sooner released than
the party appoints or elects him to of
fice at the first opportunity. The
greater the crime the greater the rev
erence displayed toward them by the
democracy.
The Democrats of Augusta, Ky., be
came so enthusiastia over the success
of the democrats in the recent state
elections that they thought the "con
federate brigadiers wer in the saddle"
and expressed their exuberance of joy
by hoisting the rebel flag. Avalanche.
Which end of our double headed
contemporary is responsible for the
above asinine statement getting into
print we, ot course, have no means of
knowing. We do know however, that
it is basely tatee and have no doubt
that the writer of it knows it. Put it
is to such malicious lying as this that
the defenders of a robber tariff are re
duced in order to divert the attention
of the people from the one great issue
which presents itself to the American
people today. That of tariff reform.
Democrat.
The above article, which the Demo
crat credits to the AVALANCHK, was
clipped from an exchange, but the
compositor forgot to give due credit.
As to the falsity of it, let others judge..
The flag was torn down the next duy
by members of the Grand Army of the
Uepublic, which is a matter of record.
We have seen democrats in the North
tear down the U. S. flag and hoist that
of the confederacy, and the history of
the late war is full of such incidents,
but that was nothing for sneaking cop
perheads to do, when not opposed by
those who wore the blue.
The free trade papers are continual
ly howling about the tariff being a
tax, and this in face of the fact that
experience has cleirly proven that it is
not a tax. They call it a relic of the
r, a war tax, and demand that it
should be removed. There is no
question that internal revenue is a
tax, neither can it be denied that it is
a tax that is paid by the home con
sumer. Since G rover Cleveland was
elected president the people of this
country have been directly taxed to
the extent of $000,000,000. The Re
publicans of the last congress wanted
to remove a large portion of this war
tax, for it is a war tax, but the Demo
crats would not hear to it. They in
sisted that the reduction In revenue
must be made by reducing the tariff
and they fought for the Mills bill,
which cut and slashed the commodities
affecting northern industries, but
carefully preserved the protective
feature of such articles as the south
produced. Tho internal revenue is a
tax that is constantly growing. For
the fiscal year ended June 30, 18S5,
the internal revenue amounted to
112,498,723. For the year ending ihe
SO, of last June, it amounted to 130,
894,434, an increase in five years of
$18,395,709. This immense tax af
fords no protection to any industry,
does not enhance the price of labor
one cent and yet the Democratic free
traders are opposed to its removal.
Cheboygan Tribune.
In the age of rush and rabid exertion
for the flesh pots of office, would it
not be well for the young men of the
party In power to reflect upon the ben
efits the couutry now derives from the
grand exertion made by those who
heard the whistle of bullets and the
shriek of shells in the days of long
ago. Put yourself in the place of men
who suffer from wounds and disease,
caused by a hcrrible war for Old Glory,
and to unite a country torn by civil
strife, and imagine how you would
feel if bravery was not considered in
a candidate for office and young fresh
workers were given the advantage over
you and appointed to fat positions,
imagine if you can, the worst torture a
man oan endure in this world and you
cannot give expression in words to the
anguish and pain which many of the
boys in blue, have endured for a quar
ter of a century. The soldiers will soon
be too old to do duty, and it is just
and right that now they be given oc
cupations suitable to their ability
Don't crowd. Your turn will come

WASHINGTON LETTER
IFrom Our Regular Correspondent! , -
Washington, Dec. 6, '89.
The President left here today for a
short western trip. After visiting
Chicago, he will go to Indianapolis
and attend to some Important private
business before returning to Washing
ton. The Senate has, by lot, determined
the length of tha terms of the six new
Senators as follows: Washington
Senator Squire expires March 3, 1891,
and Senator Allen March 3, 1893;
South Dakota-Senator Moody March
3, 1891 and Senator Pettlgrew March
3, 1893; North Dakota-Senator Pierce,
March 3, 1S91, and Senator Casey
March 3. 1893. The terms of the
Montana Senators will not be fixed
until they occupy their seats.
Judge David J. Brewer, of Kansas
has been nominated by the President
to be associate Justice of the Supreme
Court to fill the vacancy caused by
the death of the late Justice Stanley
Matthews,' of Ohio. Judge Brewer is
a nepjiew of Justice Stephen J. Field
of the Supreme Court; he has been
since 1881 United States Judge for the
Eighth circuit of Kansas. He has fill
ed a number of important positions in
Kansas, judicial and otheiwlse, and
has always been a popular official.
The nomination is highly pleasing to
Senator Ingalls and Plumb, and in
fact to everybody, with the possible
exception of several disappointed can
didates and their immediate friends.
Justice Miller, over whose circuit
Judge Brewer has presided for the last
five years, says he considers him one
of the ablest judges now on the bench.
When Justice Brewer takes his seat on
the bench with his Uucle Justice
Field, it will be the first time in the
history of the court that two of the
contemporary justices haye been so
nearly related.
Owing to the organization of the
House on Monday the President's
message was not read to Congress un
til Tuesday. The message has been
well received by everybody except a
handful of Southerners who profess
to see in its plain statement of the con
dition of political affairs in the South
cause for alarm. The message is
strictly conservative, both in tone and
in its recommendations, being thereby
iu striking contrast to the last dicta
torial documents sent from the White
House to Congress. Mr. Harrison
evidently intended thij mesflage to be
confined to its Btrlct constitutional
limits, that of informing Congress of
the state of the country. Its recom
mendations are in every instance what
has been approved by the republican
party. Upon those things on which
there are different opinions in the
party in which he has presented the
facts without recommendation. It is
document that has greatly disap
pointed the democrats because It fur
nishes them with no ammunition.
Next in importance to the Presi
dent's message is Secretary Wiodom's
annual report to Corgros, which was
made publio on Wednesday. Mr.
Windom covers the entire financial
field and furnishes one of the most in
teresting as well as important reports
of the kind ever made. It-presents a
plan for the satisfactory solution of
the silver problem, which Mr. Windom
believes will be accepted by both sil
ver and gold men. Space prevents
further notice of the report, but it
should be carefully read by every in
telligent citizen of the country. It
may be obtained' by addressing Sec
retary Windom.
The organization of the House was
attended by a little circumstance that
shows the danger which will constant
ly menace the majority during the ses
sion. Alter need uaa neen elected
Speaker, McPherson Clerk; Holmes
Sergeant-at-Arms ; Adams Doorkeeper,
and Wheat Postmaster, Representat
ive Henderson, as chairman of the re
publican caucu. nominated Rev. C.
B. Ramsdell for Chaplin. Represent
ative Cheadle of Indiana, bolting the
caucus nomination, moved to strike
out the name of Mt. Ramsdell and
substitute that of Dr. Milburn, the
blind preacher who was Chaplain of the
last House. Mr. Cheadle was sup
ported outright by three republicans
Moore, of New Hampshire; Lehblack,
of New Jersey, and Ewart of North
Carolina and enough refained from
voting to elect vr. Aiuourn, wno re
ceived 1G6 votes to Mr. Ramsdell's 155,
the democrats voting solidly for Mil
burn. This is of itself a small thing,
but if the party caucus can be success
fully bolted in small things, there Is
nothing to prevent the same thing be
ing done when something important is
at stake.
Secretary Noble has gone to St.
Louis, his former home, to look after
some private matters. He is expected
back early next week.
The onlj evidence of sorrow for tho
death of Jefl DatIs, an shown at Wash
ington, Is a broad band of black cloth
uncross tho front of Mrs. Fairfax's res
idence. Mrs. Fairfax during tne war
was a devoted friend of the southern
cause, and frequently passed the lines
to give Information and supplies to
the enemy. It was due to Mrs. Fair
fax that the union army so frequently
found itself anticipated In Important
movements, but nhe was not discover
ed until the custom of hanging spies
had fallen into what a recent reformer
called innocuous desuetude. Mr
Fairfax is having a real quiet time In
her grief, and is getting considerable
notoriety out of It. Dct Journal

than I sell goods for, which fa a fact. I heard of a good many people
who made the same remarks. '
For instance let us commence on Dry Goods. People will go into
a itore and pay from 7c to 80 for cotton which I sell for 6c a yard.
For indigo-blue prints they are paying 8c a yard every where, whilt
I sell them at Cc a yard.
For all wool Tricot they pay from 40 to 50c a yard, while they can
be had at my store from only 30 to 40c a yard.
Ladies fine all wool hoae are cheap at 35c a pair, my price fa 25o
a pair, and everything in proporrtion. I sell a
Ladies Fine Shoe for $1.50
which Ladies themselves pronounce cheap at $2.00 a pair.
My $2.00 mens shoe are better than most shoos you buy elsewhert
for $3.00. Misses and children shoes at the same low figures. Ladies and
Misses Rubbers I sell for 25c a pair, which are just as good as those that
you pay 40 and 50c for elsewhere.
In Cloaks, Newmarkets, Wraps, aud "Walking Jackets I defy com-
pcuion in uie siaic.
CLOTHING & FURNISHING GOODS,
Of which I am proud to say
that I carry the largest stock north of Bay City, and at lower figures than
you can buy at Pay City. For instance you will find in my stock

up, which goods you can not touch for less than $5 anywhere else.
OVERCOATS, of wheh I have over 500 on hand yet, after the
big rush I had for them, I conclude to reduce by marking them down, and
will sell them now as follows:
Heavy Ulsters, former" price 5 dollars, go now for 4 dollars; for
this aame article you pay from 7 to 8 dollai-s elsewhero.
A good fine Chinchilla overcoat7 dollars, which you admit are
cheap at 10 dollars, former price 12 dollars. Satin lined Chinchilla for
12 dollars, former price 15 dollars. All wool kersey pants go now for
1.25 to 2 dollars a pair, former price 1.50 to 2.50. In Underwear the
prices run from 50c up, and I am able to fit any size.
Now consider where you can save your dollars and cent, when you
buy goods. A dollar saved fa a dollar earned. Come where your money
will go the farthest. Respccttully yours
