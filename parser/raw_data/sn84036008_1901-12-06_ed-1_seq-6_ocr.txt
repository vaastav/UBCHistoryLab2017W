MODE OF LIFE
COWBOYS AND RANCHMEN LIKE
THE PRESIDENT.
VOICE THEIR SATISFACTION
At Having a Man In the White House
Who Understands Their
Neecs.
Chicago, Dec. 4.-The National Live
Stock convention, which is in session
here, today adopted resolutions voic
ing their satisfaction in the fact that
a man who understands the cattle in
terests sits in the president's chair
at Washington.. The resolutions read:
"Whereas, The inscrutible will of
the Divine Ruler of nations has seen
fit to take from us the beloved and
deeply lamented president, Wm. Mc
Kinley, and has elevated to the posi
tion Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, who
has taken the reins of government
with a firm hand and has, in his first
public message to congress displayed
a keen insight into the needs of the
people and has voiced in vigorous
tone the demand of the people for
progress in the right direction, there
fore, be it
"Resolved, That we send greeting
to President Roosevelt, assuring him
of the loyalty and support of the
stockmen of the country in all his un
dertakings for the good of the people.
We recognize in our chief executive
one who is familiar with the industry
we represent who has wielded a lariet
and branding iron, and knows person
ally of the joys, the hardships and
the fatigues of the life on the ranch
and range. The cowboy on the range
and the stockmen on the ranch, all
feel that in President Roosevelt the
nation has a loyal, honest and fear
less ruler, and the live stock industry
has a friend at court in the person of
one who knows the needs and neces
sities of the industry."
COVERNORS TAKE A LOOK
AT ANIMALS AT THE LIVE STOCK
SHOW.
Chicago, Dec. 4.-The fifth day of
the International Live Stock exposi
tion attracted the greatest crowd ever
assembled at the stock yards, the pa
villions, pens and yards being filled
really beyond their capacity. High
officials of several western states and
Canadian provinces were among the
spectators, including Governor Shaw
of Iowa, Governor Savage of Nebras
ka, Governor Van Sant of Minnesota,
Governor Durbin of Indiana, Governor
Dockery of Missouri, Governor Toole
of Montana, Governor Wells of Utah,
Senor dasoveras 'of Mexico, Senor Al
berto Serentes of the Argentine re
public, and Hon. J. L. Dryden, Cana
dian minister of agriculture.
L; An interesting incident of the day
was the selling at auction of the fat
Hereford steer, Wood's Principal, to
oes not advise, as some I for
h e. surrender the principle the
cents a pound. Penny by penny the
price advanced, but 50 cents a pound
was the limit and C. G. Swenson of
New York was the purchaser.
The annual inter-collegiate stock
judging contest for the Spoor trophy
was another feature of the day. There
were 57 contestants representing eight
colleges of agriculture, from the fol
lowing states: Illinois, Iowa, Wiscon
sin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Ontario,
(Geulph) and North Dakota. Nine
teen classes of livestock were judged.
Each class was judged by a special
judge, the students had judged them
and their judgment will be compared
with that of the judges. Winners will
probably be announced tomorrow..

FIRED FROM A WINDOW
VIRGINIAN KILLED ONE MAN AND
WOUNDS TWO.
Fredericksburg, Va., Dec. 4.-It is
reported from Westmoreland county
that William Taylor was killed and J.
Q. Stiff and Willie rIefln seriously
wounded by Herbert Marks. From the
information obtained it appears that
Taylor was informed of an alleged in
sult offered by Herbert Marks to a
young lady, his (Taylor's) cousin, and
was endeavoring to have the matter
amicably settled. Failing to do so,
he, in company with Stiff, Hefin and
two other men, visited the Marks
house. Upon arriving they found the
house barricaded and when they at
tempted to open the door, Marks be
gan shooting form a window. Taylor
was shot through the heart and died
instantly. Stiff was shot through the
neck, and Hefin in the stomach.
Marks has surrendered to the author

SPANIARDS MAY ASK REBATE
FOR DUTY PAID ON GOODS AT
MANILA.
Washington, Dec. 4.-Secretary
Root is taking counsel with some of
the republican party leaders in the
preparation of a programme to meet
the decision of the supreme court ren
deled Monday in the insular cases.
It is said that the present purpose is
to ask congress to legislate imme
diately so as to define with precision
the status of the islands from a finan
cial point of view. It is considered
that neither the "fourteen diamond
rings" case or the Dooley case, affirm
ed or denied the right of the United
States to collect revenues. The finan
cial experts of the department who
have looked into the trade figures for
the past three years find that the sum
of $1,900,000 represents about the total
duties collected from Spaniards on
goods arriving at Manila which might
have to be refunded in the event that
it should ultimately be held that the
collecting of duties on American goods
was illegal. The Spaniards would se
cure a like liquidation under the
terms of the Paris treaty, guarantee
ing them equal rights with Americans
in the Philippines.

ADRIFT IN BAY OF FUNDY.
Barges Break From Tug During Se
vere Storm.
St. John, N. B., Dec. 4.-The tug ,
Gypsum King, Captain Blizzard, ar- 1
rived here this afternoon with one
steel barge in tow, and reported that
two other barges, the Gypsum King
and the Gypsum Queen, broke away
from the tow this morning about six
miles off Point Lepraux in the Bay of
Fundy. There are grave fears that
the barges with their crews of five
men each are lost, though the captain
has hopes that as they are schooner
rigged and filled with sails they may
have been able to live through the
storm. The lost barges are wooden,
of 1,100 tons net. Both carried about
1,000 tons of gypsum.
JURY BRIBING CASE.
Witnesses Confess to Taking Bribes
and Committing Perjury.
Chicago, Dec. 4.--Two self-confessed
perjurers, who admitted accepting
bribes while acting as jurors, a third
person who confessed to a part in the
conspiracy to keep James J. Lynch
from trial and the former bailiff him
self, were witnesses in the trial of
Alex Sullivan in Judge Smith's court
today. Thomas Smallman and Frank
S. O'Brien told under oath of commit
ting perjury and accepting bribes from
Lynch, while on juries. These men
were sprung as a surprise on the de
fense. Smallman says he received
$50 for his services, while O'Brien
swore that Lynch paid him $100. Both
witnesses said that Sullivan was the
trial lawyer in the cases.
POWDER HOUSE EXPLOSION
BUILDING WRECKED AND TWO
MEN BLOWN TO ATOMS.
Ishpeming, Dec. 4.-The packing
house at the St. Anthony Powder com
pany's works, midway between Ishpe
ming and Negaunee, was wrecked by
an explosion this evening, killing two
of the workmen, John Nelson and
Linus Shively. Three other workmen
in an adjoining building had a narrow
escape, but only one was injured.
The building was completely wreck
ed, and the head of Shively was the
only part of the men found. The loss
to the company will be several thou
sand dollars. The packing house is
where the caps used in setting off
giant powder are filled. It is estimat
ed that about one and a half tons of
powder were stored in the packing
house.
Nearly all the windows in Ishpeming
and Negaunee business houses and
dwellings were broken by the fear
ful concussion.
RESPONSIBILITY FIXED.
Wabash Accident Caused By Negli
gence of Company and Employes
Adrain, Mich., Dec.. 4.-The coron
er's jury today found that the disas
trous collision on the Wabash near
Seneca last Wednesday night was
caused by the negligence of the Wa
bash Railroad" company, and the train
men of train No. 4.
FAVOR NICARAGUAN ROUTE.
Report of Canal Commission Submit
ted to Congress.
Washington, Dec. 4.-The report of
the isthmian canal commission was
sent to congress today. It favors the
Nicaraguan route, and estimates the
total cost at $189,864,062. The cost
for construction and rights by the
Panama route would aggregate $253,
374,358. With an adequate force and
plant the commission believes the
Nicaraguan canal can be completed in
six years, exclusive of two years for
preparations. Ten years is estimated
as the time it would require to com
plete the Panama canal.
SOUND STEAMER ASHORE.
Passengers Jump Overboard and
Reach Land.
Seattle, Dec. 4.-The steamer Clara
Brown, one of the largest stern wheel
ers on the sound, was driven ashore
at Alki Point last night during the
gale which raged all night. In trying
to round the point on her usual trip
from Seattle to Tacoma, the steamer
became completely unmanageable,
and several times was in imminent
danger of foundering. She was finally
driven upon the beach half a mile
south of the point. The passengers
jumped overboard and made their
way ashore through the surf. The
gale has continued all day and the
boat has been badly smashed, but will
probably be saved unless the gale be
comes much worse.

PHILIPPINE TARIFF.
Measure for Raising Revenues for the
Islands.
Washington, Dec. 4.-A bill to pro
vide revenues for the Philippine is
lands was introduced in the sentate
today. It provides that the tariff pro
posed by the Philippine commission
September 17, 1901, and approved by
the secretary of war shall remain in
full force and effect, this covers goods
going into the Philippines.
The second section of the bill pro
vides for levying the same tariff duty
on goods coming into the United
States from the Philippine islands
that are now collected from foreign
countries.
Section three provides, until other
wise ordered, that the statutory laws
of the United States' shall not be in
force in the Philippines except as or
dered by the Philippine commission.
Section four provides that all duties
collected in the "hilippine islands
shall be uaid into the Philippine
treasury.
NOT A MODEL HUSBAND.
Troubles of Holland's Royal Couple
Continue.
Amsterdam, Dec. 4.-In spite of of
ficial denials, investigations show that
there is a substantial foundation for
the story of a duel having been fought
between Prince Henry of the Nether
lands, husband of Queen Wilhelmina,
and Major Vantets, the queen's aide
de camp. It appears that at a dinner at
Hetloo, her majesty was hurt by some
inattention on the part of the prince
and spoke to him sharply. Prince
Henry retorted offensively, whereupon
Major. Vantets made a remark regard
ing the impropriety of the prince con
sort's conduct. A quarrel followed
between the aide de camp and the
prince, who had been drinking freely
and a duel with swords was fought af
ter dinner. Vantets was wounded.
He has since been removed to Utrecht
to be operated upon.
The same incident gave rise to an
other duel between Prince Henry and
a gentleman of the court. The latter
was slightly wounded.
London, Dec. 4.-The matrimonial
quarrel between Wilhelmina and
Prince Henry, her husband, excites
great interest here. The substance
of the affair, as gathered from the
various continental newspapers,
charge Prince Henry with miscon
duct and neglect and repeat rumors
of his deep drinking and heavy gam
ing debts, which Queen Wilhelmina
declined to pay. Another point of dis
agreement between the pair was the
prince's uncontrolled antipathy to
Holland and his ungovernable passion
for hunting, which resulted in his
long absences in Germany. It is said
that the queens' mother interfered
and taxed her son-in-law with his be
havior, but without effect, and finally
the matter evolved into an estrange
ment between mother and daughter.
In regard to the quarrel at the din
ner at Hetloo, and the resultant duels,
another rumor represents Major Van
Tets as having received a violent kick
in the stomach, which caused him se
vere internal injuries, and .it is sup
posed that fear that his death might
lead to revelations was the real mo
tive for something of the truth be
ing permitted to leak out after the
matter was officially denied. The lat
est news, however, says the major is
progressing favorably, and it is said
the queen's mother has been able to
effect something like a reconciliation
between the queen and her husband.
Prince Henry has a record of sev
eral duels in his student days. He
has always been exceedingly unpopu
lar in Holland, where, since 1870, there
have been morbid fears of annexation
schemes on the part of Germany, and
on this account the friends of Prince
Henry declare he never has had fair
play.
Convicted of Bribery.
Grand Rapids, Mich., Dec. 4.-The
jury today found City Attorney Salis
bury guilty of bribery after deliberat
ing all night. The indictment charged
he had accepted a bribe of $75,000 for
pushing through a deal for a $4,000,000
contract for a water supply for the
city.

St. Louis, Dec. 4.-Formal notice of
the absorption of the M. C. Wetmore
Tobacco company by the Continental
Tobacco company was issued today to
dealers.
DESTRUCTION OF THE MAINE .
Brief Submitted in Support of Motion
to Dismiss Claim.
Washington, Dec. 4.-Counsel for
the government have presented to the
Spanish treaty claims commission a
brief in support of a motion to dis
miss the claims growing out of the
sinking of the battleship Maine. It
is contended that it was the intention
of the treity of peace not to provide
for, but to relinquish and leave in ob
livion as settled in tribunal of war,
the grievance referred to expressly
in the joint resolution of April 20, as
'Destruction of United States bat
tie ship, with 266 of its offices and
crew, while on a friendly visit in the
harbor of Havana."
RESOLUTIONS FAVOR IRRICATION

WILL, ELECTRIFY THE WEST.
President Maxwell of National Irriga
tion Association Pleased.
Chicago, Dec. 3.-George H. Max
well, executive -chairman of the Na
tional irrigation association, in speak
ing tonight of the president's message
said:
"The president's message recom
mends to congress a national policy
for the storage of waters that now go
to waste which if used on .the arid
land would practically double the
wealth, resources and population of
the United States within a generation.
"The president has outlined this
whole policy in such a logical way that
it shows that he thoroughly under
stands the problem and what is neces
sary to be done to solve it. He knows
that water is the hfe of the arid re
gion and ,-at the forests must be pre
served as a primary source of water
supply. He shows, however, that for
ests alone are not enough. They must
be supplemented by great storage
reservoirs to be built and maintained
by the national government as in
ternal improvements. The president
shows further that where arid public
lands are to be reclaimed the national
government must also build great
main line canals to bring water with
in the reach of settlers and reserve
the lands for home builders. His
familiarity with western conditions en
ables him to speak with authority
when he says that the problem must.
be solved by the national government
and not by states. This-message will
electrify the west because it opens
up such gigantic possibilities for in
creasing the population and prosper
ity of that region. It will have the
support of every. thinking man, and
the business men of the country who
have loyally supported the national
irrigation movement will be more
than gratified that it has received this
endorsement. The president has an
swered evedy objection to the policy
and has demonstrated that its in
auguration would benefit every sec
tion of the country and every class of
the American people. He shows that
it is one of the greatest questions be
fore the country today."
DIED ON THE SIDEWALK
STABBED TO DEATH IN CHILDISH
QUARREL. I
Newport, Ky., Dec. 4.-Joseph Creel
man, a schoolboy, 8 years old, was
stabbed to death by a schoolmate aged
11, on the street here at noon today.
The victim had had a boyish quarrel
in the school room with Eddie Armins,
and when on their way home the quar
rel was renewed. A third boy, taking
the part of Creelman, threw a piece of
brick which struck Armins on the
hand. At this moment Creelman ran
up to him and was stabbed. He fell
to the sidewalk and in 15 minutes
was dead. The Armins boy walked
rapidly away, carrying the knife in his
hand. He went to the fire house,
where his uncle is captain, and threw
the knife in an outhouse, but said
nothing about the murder until the
news became known of the lad's
death. His uncle then promptly sur
rendered him to the police. Young
Armins told his childish story to the
police.
He said: "Creelman missed his les
son and was sent out of the class. I
said I did not care, and that made
him mad. The teacher made, hm sit
at the blackboard, and I laughed at
him. He shook his fist at me, and
when school was out- we quarreled.
I started for the engine house, and
Plummer threw a brick at me, and
Creelman ran up and grabbed me by
the arms. I did not think the brick
was thrown at me until it hit me on
the hand. Then I struck the knife out
easy and heard-his coat rip."
Both boys belong to excellent fam
ilies.
