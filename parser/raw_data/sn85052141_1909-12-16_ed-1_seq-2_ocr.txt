Chief Executlys Announcea Hlmitlf
Warm Supporter of Inland
Improvement.
Washington Speaking In strong In
dorsement of the policy of waterway Im
provement, President Tatt etlrrcil up
much enthusiasm during the opening
hours of the sixth convention of the Na
tional Hivcrs and Harbors Congress here
Wednesday.
Hundred of delegates, representing
every section of the United States, filled
the great banquet hall of the New Wll
lard, where they sat under their state
banners. Men and women delegate
aroe when the nrrivnl of the lrealdcnt
.vns announced and gave their Ivsltor a
noisy reception, concluding the demon
stration with three cheers and a tiger.
Upon being presented to the assem
blage President Taft spoke at length,
dwelling upon his Interest in the policy
of waterway improvement, and offered
ldvice to the delegates upon methods for
attaining the ends they seek.
"I congratulate this congress," said
Mr. Taft, "on having brought the sub
ject of waterways to such a point that
the representatives In Congress from one
end of the country to the other recognlra
It as a subject that rails for action.
They have not come to a definite conclu
sion as to the policy that ought to be
adopted, but they have come to the con
clusion that tome policy must be adopted
with reference to the development of
those Instrumentalities which nature has
furnished for the transportation of goods
ind for the controlling of railroad rates.
"A year ago President Roosevelt and
( were together on a platform before the
Conservation of Resources Convention,
In which we both advocated the issuing
of bonds in order that a project for Im
proving waterways when begun should
be completed in a reasonable time. I am
till a consistent advocate of that theory.
"But I want, to suggest a word of cau
tion. You are going to encounter in
Congress great opposition to the policy
of issuing bonds right out of hand. You
ire much more likely to get from Con
gress a declaration of policy in the shape
of a declaration that a certain improve
ment ought to be carried out and spread
upon the minutes of Congress in the form
of a resolution or a declaration in a
itatute. What I advise you to do It to
get that declaration.
"Then when the time comes that po
litical exigency shall prevent the appro
priation of sufficient money from the
current revenue to put the proper part
of the project through the coming year
or the coming two years as economy re
quires, then the question of issuing bonds
will arise. I would get the declaration
first, and not have the bonds first, for
the reason that you will encounter the
objection by Congress that t)ic Issuing of
bonds and the receipt of the money will
develop a desire to be extravagant."

Latin America.
On of the happiest events In recent
ran-Amerlean diplomacy was the pacific.
Independent settlement by the uovern
ments of llollvla and I'eru of a boundary
difference between them, which for om
weeks threatened to caus war and even
to entrain emblttenaents affectlnc other
republics less directly concerned. From
various quarters, directly or Indirectly
cencemed, the Intermediation ef th Uni
ted States was sought to assist In a so
lution of the controversy. Deslrlnr at all
times to abstain from any undue mtncllnf
In the IT airs of sister republics and hav
ing faith In the ability of the govern
ments of Teru and llollvla themselves to
settle their differences In a manner satis
factory to themselves which, viewed with
magnanimity, would assuage all embtt
terment, this government steadily ab
stained from being drawn Into th con
troversy and was much gratified to find
Its confidence Justified by events.
On th ninth of July next then wtll
open at Iluenos Aires th fourth Tan
American conference. Thl conference
will have a special meaning to the hearts
ef all Americans, because around Its date
are cluttered th anniversaries of the In
dependence of to many American repub
lics. It Is not necessary for me to remind
the congress of the political, social and
commercial Importance of these gather-
ngs. Tou are asked to make liberal ap
propriation for our participation. If this
be granted. It Is my purpose to appoint
a distinguished snd representative dele
gation, qualified fittingly to represent this
country and to deal with the problems of
Intercontinental Interest which will there
be discussed.
The Argentine Republic wtll also hold
from May to November. HIO. at iluenos
Aire, a rre.it International agricultural
exhibition In which the United States has
been Invited to participate. Considering
the rapid growth at the trade of the Uni
ted State with the Argentine Republic
and the cordial relation existing between
the two nations, together with the fact
that It provides an opportunity to show
deference to a sister republic on the oc
casion of the celebration of Its nation
al Independence, the proper departments
of this government are taking steps to ap
prise the Interests concerned of the op
portunity afforded by this exhibition. In
which appropriate participation by this
country I so desirable. The designation
of an official representative la also recety-
ng consideration.
The Tan-American policy of this gov
ernment haa long been fixed In Its prin
ciples and remains unchanged. With the
changed circumstances of the United
States and ef the republics to the south
of us, most of which have great natural
resources, ataoie government and pro
gressive Ideals, the apprehension which
gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be
said to have nearly disappeared and nei
ther doctrine as It exist nor any
other doctrine of American policy should
be permitted to operate for the perpetua
tion of Irresponsible government, the e.
cape of just obligations or the Insidious
allegation of dominating ambitions on the
part of the United Btateg.
Reside the fundamental doctrine of our
Pan-American policy there have grown
up a realization of political Interest,
community of Institution and Ideals and
a flourishing commerce. All these bonds
will be greatly strengthened a time goes
on and Increased facilities, such as the
great bank soon to be established In lAt-In-America,
supply the means for build
ing up the colossal Intercontinental com
merce of the future.
My meeting with Tresldsnt Wax and
the greeting exchanged on both Ameri
can and Mexican soil served, I hope, to
signalise the close and cordial relation
which o well bind together this republic
and the great republlo Immediately to the
south, between which there Is so vast a
network of material Interests,
I am happy to say that all but one of
the cases which for so long vexed our
relations with Venezuela have been set
tled within the past few months and that,
under the enlightened regime now direct-
ng the government of Venezuela, provi
sion has been made for arbitration of the
remaining case before Th Ilazus tri
bunal.
Since the Washington conventions of
1907 were communicated to the govern
ment of the United States as a consult
ing and advisory party, this government
has been almost continuously called upon
by one or .another, and In turn by all of
the nve Central American republic, to
exert Itself for the maintenance of the
conventions, Nearly every complaint has
been against the Zelaya government of
Nicaragua, which has kept Central Amer
ica In constant tension and turmoil. The
responses mails to the representations of
Central American republic, a due from
the United State on account of It rela
tion to the Washington conventions, have
been at all time conservative and have
avoided, so far a possible, any semblance
of Interference, although It Is very appar
ent that the consideration of geograph
ic proximity to the canal zone and of the
very substantial American Interest In
Central America give to the United
States a special position In the ion of
these republic and the Caribbean sea.
I need not rehearse here the patient
efforts of this government to promote
peace and welfare among these repub
lics, efforts which are fully appreciated
by the majority of them, who are loyal
to their true Interests. It would be no
less unnecessary to rehearse here the
sad tale of unspeakable barbarities and
oppression alleged to have been commu
ted by the Zulsya government. Recently
two Americans were put to death by or
der of President Zelaya himself. They
were o.'Ilcers In the organized force of
a revolution whlh was In control of
sbsut hair of tht republic, and ut tuch,
CONGRESS
aeeerdtnc t the modern enlightened
practice of civilised nations, they were
entitled to be dealt with a prisoners of

At th date when this mess
printed this government has) terminated
diplomatic rttstlon with the Kelsya gov
ernment, for reason mad; public In a
communication to th former Nicaragua
charge d'affaires, and Is Intending to take
such future steps a may be found most
consistent with II dignity, Its duty to
American Interests and It. moral obliga
tion! to Central America and to civilisa
tion. Department ef State,
I earnestly recommend to th favor
able consideration of th c-angres ths es
timates submitted by the department of
tat and most especially th legisla
tion auggested In the secrtary ef state's
letter of this date, whereby It will be
possible to develop and make permanent
the reorganisation of th department
upon modern line In a manner to make
It a thoroughly efficient Instrument In
th furtherance of our foreign trad and
of American Interests abroad. The plan
to have divisions of Itln-Amerlcan and
r'ar-HAatern affairs and to Institute a
certain specialisation In business with
Europe and th near east will at once
commend ltlf. These polllleo.geog.'sph
Irat division and the detail from the
diplomatic or consular service to th
department of a number of men whe
bring to the study of complicated prob
lems In different parts of the world
practical knowledge recently gained on
the spot, clearly Is of the grestrst ad
vantage to the secretary ef state In
foreseeing conditions likely to arise snd
In conducting the great variety of orre
spondenre and negotiation. It should be
remembered that such facilities sitat In
the foreign office ef all the leading com
merelal nations and that te deny them
to' the secretary of slate would be to
place thl government at a great disad
vantage In th rivalry ef .commercial
competition.
The consular service has heen Im
proved under th law ef April I. lwi,
and the executive order of June V V.
and I rem mend to your consideration the
question of embodying In n statute (he
principle of th present executive order
upon which the emnenry of eur consular
service Is wholly dependent
Expenditures and Revenues.
Perhaps the most trportantnurtlan
presented to thl administration Is that
of economy In expenditures and suffi
ciency of revenue Th deficit of the
Isst fiscal year, and the certain deficit
of the current year, prompted congress
to throw a greater responsibility on
the executive and the secretary of th
treasury. than had heretofore been de
clared by atatut. Thl declaration
Impose upon th aecretary ef the
treasury the duty ef assembling til th
estimate of th executive departments,
bureaus and offices of the expenditures
necessary In the ensuing fiscal year
and of making an estimate ef tht reve
nues jat the. government for th same
penedi and ir a probabl deficit Is thus
shown. It Is made the duty of the presi
dent to recommend the method by
which such deficit can be mtt.
The report of the secretary shows
that the ordinary expendlturea for th
current fiscal year ending Jun It, 11,
will exceed the estimated receipts by
Jll.OU tro, If to thl deficit Is added
the um to be disbursed for the Pan
ama Canal, amounting to 111,099 009.
and tt.009.V9O to b paid on th public
debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts
and expenditure 'will be Increased to
a total deficit of T1.07S.i:9. This def
icit th secretary propose ta meet by
ths proceed of bond Issued to pay
th cost of constructing the Panama
Canal. I approve thl proposal.
In order to avoid a denclt for th
ensuing fiscal year, 1 directed ths
heads of departmenta In th prepara
tion of their estimate to make them
as tow aa possible consistent with Im
perative governmental necessity.
Civil Pensions,
I am aware that there Is a strong
feeling In both house of congress, and
possibly In the country, against the
establishment of civil pensions, and
that this ha naturally grown out of
the heavy burden of military pensions.
which It ha always been th policy
of our government t assume, but I
am strongly convinced that no other
practical solution of the difficulties
presented by the superannuation of
civil servants can be found than that
of a system of civil pensions.
Frauds In the Collection of Customs.
I regret to refer to th fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds In the
collection of the customs revenue at
New Tork city. In which a number of
the subordinate employes In the welch
Ing and other departmenta were di
rectly concerned, and In whl'h th
beneficiaries were th American Sugar
Refining Company and others. The
frauds consisted In the payment of
duty on underweights of acgar The
government has recovered from the
American Sugar Refining Company all
that It I shown to have been defraud
ed of. The sum was received In full
of the amount due, which might have
been recovered by civil suit against
the beneficiary of the fraud, but there
was an express reservation In the con
tract of settlement by which th settle
ment should not Interfere with, or pre
vent the criminal prosecution of every
one who was found to be subject to
the same,
Criminal prosecutions are now pro
ceeding against a number of the gov
ernment officers. The treasury de
partment and the department of jus
tice are exerting every effort to dis
cover all the wrongdoers. Including
the officers and employes ef the com
panies who may have been privy to
the fraud. It would seem to ma that
an Investigation of the frauds by con
Kress at present, pending the probing;
by trie treasury department and the
department of justice, aa proposed,
might by Rlvlnit Immunity and other
wise prove an embarrassment In secur
ing conviction of the guilty parties.
Tho Tariff Act.
Two features of the new tariff act
call for special reference. Uy virtue
of the clause known as the "maximum
and minimum" clause. It a the duty
of the executive to consider the laws
and practices of other countries with
reference to the Importation Into those
countries of the product and mer
chandise of the United Btatea, and If
the executive finds such laws and prac
tice not to be unduly discriminatory
against the United States, th mini
mum duties provided In the bill are to
go Into force. Unless the president
makes such n finding, then the mad
mum duties provided In the bill, thst
Is, an Increase of ii per cent, ad valo
rem over th minimum dutle are to
be In foree. Kear haa -been expressed
that this power conferred and duty
Imposed on the executive la likely to
lead to a tariff wtr. I beg to express
the hope and belief that no such result
noed be sntlclpated,
The discretion granted to the execu
tive by tho. terms "unduly discrim
inatory" Is wide. In order that tho
maximum duty shall he charged against
the Imports from a country. It Is neces
sary that he shall find on the part of
that country not only Incrimination
In Its law or the practice under them
strulnst the trade of the United States,
but that the discriminations found
shall be undue; that Is, without ffood
and fair reason. I conceive that this
power was reposed In the president
with the hope that the maximum du
ties mlKht never bo applied In any case,
but that th power to apply them would
enable the president and th Mat de
partment through friendly negotiation
to secure the elimination from th laws
and th practice under them of any
foreign country of that which Is un
duly discriminatory. No on Is seek-
in a tariff war or a condition In which
the spirit of retaliation shall tit
aroused.
Netdt of th Navy.
Th return of Ihs battleship fl'st from
It vorax around th world. In mora
efficient condition than when It started.
was a noteworthy event of Interest alike
to our cllltsna and tht naval authorities
of tho world, Resides ths beneficial and
far-reaching effect on our personal and
diplomatic relations In th countries
which the fleet visited, the marked sue
cess of the ships In attaining around th
world In all weather In schedule tlm
ha Increased respect for our navy and
has added t our national prestige.
Injunctions Without Notice.
Th platform of tie successful party la
lit last election contained th following.
"Th Republican party will uphold at
all times ths authority and Integrity of
th court, stat and federal, and will
vsr Insist that their powers to enforce
their process and protect life, liberty
and property shall be. preserved Inviolate.
We believe, however, that the rule of
procedure In th federal courts with re
spect to the Issuance of the writ ef In
junction should be more accurately de
fined by statute and that no Injunction
or temporary restraining order should be
Issued without notice, except where Ir
reparable Injury would result from delay.
In which cat a speedy hearing there
after should be granted."
I recommend that la compliance with
the promise thua made appropriate legis
lation be adopted, Th end of Justice
will best be met snd the chief cause of
complaint against ill-considered Injunc
tions without notice will be removed by
the enactment ef a statute forbidding
hereaftsr th Issuing of any Injunction
or restraining order, whether temporary
or permanent, by any federal court,
without rrevlou notice and a reasonable
opportunity t be heard on behalf of the
partlra to be enjoined unless It shall s
pesr to th satisfaction of th court that
Ihe delay necessary to give such notice,
and hearing would result In Irreparable
Injury to the complatnsnt and unless alse
the rourt shall from Ihe evidence make
a written finding, which shall be spread
upon th court minutes, that Immsdlat
and Irreparable Injury Is likely to ensue
to th complainant, and shall define the
Injury, stat why It Is It reparable and
shall also Indorse on ths order Issued the
date and th hour of the Issuance of the
order. Moreover, tvery uch Injunction
er restraining order Issued without pre
vious nolle and opportunity by th de
fendant t be beard should by fore of
th statute to aplr and be of no effect
after seven days from th Issuance there
of er within any time lesa than that pe
riod which th court may fix, unless
within th injunction or order Is ex
tended or renewed after previous notice
tod tpportunlty t be heard.
SectndClatt Mtll Matttr.
Th deficit every yetr la th post
office departmtnt t largely caused by tb
low rsl of pestags of ene cent a pound
chsrged on second-class snail matttr,
which Includes not only newspapers but
magazines and miscellaneous periodicals.
The actual loss growing out of ths Iran,
mission of this second-clase mall matter
at on cent a pound amount te about
tU.CflO.eeo a year. The average cost of th
transportation ef this matter Is mor than
nine cent a pound.
It appears that th average distance ev
er which newspaper are delivered to
their customers 1 91 miles, while the
average haul ef magazines I 1.0s. and
of miscellaneous periodicals I.tXs mils.
Thus, the average haul of th magastne
Is three and one-half times and that of
th miscellaneous pertodlcr.1 nearly four
time th haul of th dally newspaper, yet
all of them pay th earn poslag rat of
on eent a pound. Th statistic of W7
how that secend-clssa mall matter con
stituted Clil per cent ef the weight of
all the mall, and yielded only LI) per cent,
of th revenue.
The figure given are ctartllng. and
ahw the payment by th government of
an enormous subsidy to the newspapers,
msgatlnea and periodicals, and congress
msy well consider whther radical step
should not be taken to reduce the deficit
In th postofflc department caused Vy
thl discrepancy between the actual cost
of transportation and th compensation
exacted therefor
A great aavlng might b made, amount
ing to much mor than halt ef th loss
by tmpoalnr upon magaitnea and peri
odicals a higher rat of postii. They
ar much heavier than newspaper and
contain a much higher proportion of ad
vertising to readlnc matter, and the aver
age distance ef their trsnsportatlsn Is
three and a half times as crest.
Postal Savings Banks.
The second subject worthy of mention
In the postbfflr department Is the real
necessity and entire practicability of ee
tabltahlng postal saving banks. Th aue
cesarul party at tho last election declared
In favor of poet! savings banks, and al
though the proposition find opponent la
msny parts of th country, I am con
vinced that the people desire such banks,
and am sure that when th bank ar fur
nished they wtll be productive of the ut
most good.
Favors Ship Subsidy.
Following the course of my distin
guished predecessor, I earnestly recom
mend to congress th consideration and
passage ef a ahlp subsidy Mil, looking to
th establishment of lines between our
Atlantic seaboard and th eastern roast
of South America, a well as line from
th west coast ef th United State to
South America. China. Japan and th
Philippine. Th profits on foreign malls
ar perhaps a sufficient measure of ths
expenditures which might first be tenta
tively applied to this method of Inducing
American capital to undertake the estab
lishment of American lines of steamships
In those directions In which we now feel
It most Important thst we should hav
mssna of transportation controlled In th
interest of th expansion of our trad. A
bill of thl character has once passed the
house and more than once passed the
senate, and I hope that at this session a
bill framed on th aarno line snd with
th s.im purposes may become a law.
Conserving National Resources.
In several departments there Is present
ed the necessity for legislation looking to
the further conservation of our national
resources, and ths subject Is one of such
Importance as to require a more detailed
and extended discussion than can be en
tered upon In this communication, Fpr
that reason I shall take on early oppor
tunity to send a special message to con
gress on the subject of the Improvement
of our waterways, upon the reclamation
and Irrigation of arid, semi-arid, and
iramp Isnds; upon th preservation of
our forests and th reforesting of suit,
able areas; upon the reclassification of
the public domain with a view of tep.
sratlng from agricultural settlement min
eral, coal, and phosphate land and altes
belonging to tho government bordering on
streams suitable for the utilization of
water power.
Political Contribution.
I urgently recommend to congresa that
a law be passed requiring that candi
dates In election of member of the
hour of representatives and commltteut
In charg of their candidacy and cam
paign fll In a proper ofllco of th United
Btatr government a statement of ih
