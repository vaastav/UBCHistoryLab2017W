TEXT OF THE DOCUMENT.
Whnat the Chief Executive Suggests anti
Recommends.
Washington, Dec. 5.-The president's
message is as follows:
To the Senate and House of Repro
sentatives: At the threshold of your
deliberations you are called to mourn
with your countrymen the death of
Vice President Hobart, who passed
from this life on the morning of
Nov. 21, last. His great soul now
rests in eternal peace. His private
life was pure and elevated, while
his public career was ever dis
tinguished by large capacity, stainless
integrity and exalted motives. He has
been removed from the high office
which he honored and dignified, but his
lofty character, his devotion to duty,
hlis honesty of purpose and noble
virtues remain with us as a priceless
legacy.
Unusnal Prosperity.
The Fifty-sixth congress convenes in
rlts first regular session with the coun
try in a condition of unusual prosperity,
of universal good will among the pen
.pie at home and its relations of peace
,and friendship in every government of
the world. Our foreign commerce has
shown great increase in volume and
value. The combined imports and ex
ports for the year are the largest ever
shown by a single year in all our his
tory. Our exports for 1899 alone ex
ceeded by more than a million dollars
our imports and exports combined in
1870. The imports per capita are 20
per cent. less than in 1870, showing the
enlarged capacity of the United States
to satisfy the \wants of its own increas
ing population, as well as to contribute
to those of the peoples of other nations.
Exports of agricultural products aere
$784,776.142. (If ianufactured products
we exported.in value $339,i,92,146, being
larger thafr, ny previous year. It is
a noteworthy fact that the only years
in all our hletotrs when the products of
our manufactue ~ se,1id abroad exceeded
those bought abroad werel 1898 :and 1O99.
Government receipts from all sources
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899,
including $11,798,314.14. part payment of
the Central Pacific indebtedness, ag
gregated $610.982.004.:.5. Customs re
ceipts were $206,128.481.75. and those
from internal revenue $27S,437,161.51.
For the fiscal year the expenditures
were $700,093,640.02, leaving a deficit of
389,111,559,642. The secretary of thd
treasury estimates that the receipts for
the current fiscal year will aggregate
$640,958;112, and upon the lois of the
present appropriations the expenditures
will aggregate $600,.95.,112, leaving $40,
000,000. For.:the fiscal year ended June
30, 1899, the internal revenue receipts
were increased about $100.000 000. The
conditions of confidence which prevail
throughout the .c~uhtry have brought
gold into more' gentral use and cus
ioms receipls are'now almost entirely
paid in that coin.
The, Sinking Fund.
The strong condition of the treasury
with respect to cash on hand and the
favorable showing made by the reve
nues have made it possible for the sec
retary of the treasury to take action
under the provision of section 3694 re
vised statutes, relating to the sinking
fund. Receipts exceeded expenditures
for the first five months of the current
is.cal year by $13,413,389.91, and as
mentioned above, the secretary of the
treasury estimates that there will be a
surplus of approximately $40.000,000 at
ithie end of the year. Under such condi
lions it was deemed advisable and
ls oper to resume complitiuce with the
prlovisIons of the sinking fund law,
which for eight years has not been done
lht.eause of the deficiencies in the rev
enues. The treasury department there
fore offered to purchase during Novem
her $25,00.n00t of the 5 per cent. loan of
1904 or the 4 per cent. funded loan of
1907 at the enu rent market price. The
amount offered and purchased during
November was $18.408,600. The pre
mnium paid by the government on such
"purchases was 2S.2.63,521 and saving in
net interest was about $2,885,000. The
success of this operation was sufficient
to induce the government to continue
tl.e offer to purchase bonds to and In
cluding the 23d1 lay of December. unless
the remainder of the $25.000,000 called
for should i: sre.sented in the mean
time for redemntion.
Increased activity in industry with ts
welcome attendant-larger employment
for labor at higher wages-gives to the
lbody of the people a larger power to
absorb the circulating medium. It is
forther true that year by year, with
larger areas of land under cultivation,
the increasing volume of agricultural
products, cotton. corn and wheat. ,alls
for a. larger volume of money supply.
This is especially noticeable at the crop
harvesting and crop moving period.
In its earlier history the national
banking act seemed to prove a reason
able avenue through which needful ad
ditions to the circulation could from
time to time be made. Changing condi
tions have apparently rendered it now
inoperative to that end. The high
margin in bond securities required re
suiting from large premiums which
government bonds command in the
market, or the tax on note issues, or
both, operating togetuer, appear to be
the influence which impair its public
utlity.
The attention of congress is respect
fully invited to this important matter
with the view of ascertaining whether
or not such reasonable modifications
can be made in the national banking
act as will render its service in the par
ticulars here referred to more respon
sive to the people's needs. I again
urge that national banks be authorized
to organize with a capital of $25,000.
Tho Gold Standard.
I urgently rocommend that to sup
port th' existing gold standard and to
maintain the parity in value of the
coins of the two metals (gold and sil
ver) and the equal power of every dol
l.ir at tll times in the market and in
the payment of debts, the secretary of
Ito treasury be given additional power
Hond charged with the duty to sell
I niltd States bonds and to employ
.1., I other effective means as may be
,; es.sary to thl-te rends. The authority
should include the power to sell bonds
on long and short 21me, as conditions
may require, and should provide for a
rate of interest lower than that fixed
by the act of January 14. 1S75. While ,
there is now no commercial fright I
which withdraws gold from the govern
ment, but on the contrary such wide
spread confidence that gold seeks the
treasury, demanding paper money in
exchange, yet the very situation points
to the present as the most fitting time
to malke adequate provision to insure
the continuance of the gold standard
and of public confidence in the ability
and purpose of the government to meet
all its obligations in money which the
civilized world recognizes as the best.
The financial transactions of the gov
ernment are conducted up,.n a gold
basis. We receive gold where wve sell
l'nited States bonds and use gold for
their payment. We ar. maintaining
the parity of all the money issued or
coined by authority of the government.
We are doing these thin;es cvith the
means at hand. Hanply ;it the present
time we arc' not colsl:.il d to resort to
loans to supply gold. It has be n do: b:
in the past, however. and iay have to
be done in the future. It Iherhovres us.
therefore, to provide at ie:,. the best
minans to meet the einterg.l'ty when it
arises. and the best melan ar t[hose
which are tile mo00t certain and oecno
mnical. Those now authorized have the
vi'tue neither lof directness or cr.onony.
We have already eliminated onte of the
causes of our financial plight and em
Iarrassmsent uring the years 18993. 1894.
1895 and 1096. Our receipts now equal
our expenditurPs. deficient revtenuest nol
longer create alarm. Let us remove thle
only renlaining cause by confeerr:ng the
full and necessary power on the seece
tary of the treasury and impose upon
him the duty to uphold the present I
ihid standard and preserve tbe coins
of the two nmetals on a parity with
each other, which is the repeatedly de
clared polity of the Utni.ted States.
In this connection I repeatl my former
reconmmendations that a portion of the
gold holdings shall be placed in a trust
fund from which greenbacks shall be
redeemed upon presentation, but wihen
unce redeetmed shall not thereafter be
paid out except for gold.
THE MERCHANT MARINE.
Congress 1s Urged to Pass ia Shipplng
.ubsidy 1111I.
The value of an American merchant
marine to the extension of our coin
mercial trade and tile strengthening of
our power upon the sea. invites the im
mediate action of congress. Our na
tional development will be one-sided
and unsatisfactory scc long as the re
markable grow5th of our inland indus
tries remains Onaccompanied by prog
ress on the sea. There is no lack of
constitutional authority for legislation
wihich shall give to the country mnarl
time strength commensurate with its
industrial achievements and with its
rank among nations of the earth.
The payt year has recorded excep
tional activity in our shipyards and the
promises of continual prosperity in
shipbuilding are abundant. Advanced
legislation for the protection of our
seamen has been enacted. Our coast
trade, under regulations wisely framed,
at the beginlning of the government and
since, shows results for the' pa.t fiscal
year unequaled in our records or those
of any other poser. We shall fail to
realize our opportunities, however, if
we complacently regard our matters at
home and blind ourselves to the neces
sity of securing our share in the valu
able carrying trade of the world.
Last year American vessels trans
ported a smaller share of our exports
and imports than during any former
year In all our history,. and the measure
of our dependence upon foreign ship
ping was painfull:y manifest to our peo
ple. W\ithout any choice of our own.
but from necessity, the departments of
the government lcharged with military
and naval operations ini the East and
West Indies had to obtain from foreign
flags merchant vessols essential for
these onerations.
The other great nations have not hes
itated to adopt the required means to
develop their shipping as a factor in
national defense and as one of the sur
est and speediest means of obtaining
for their producers a share in fcreign
markets. Like vigilance and effort on
our part cannot fall to improve our
situation, which is regarded with hu
miliation at home and with surprise
abroad. Even the seeming sacrifices
which at the beginning may be in
volved will be offset later by more than
equivalent gains.
The expense Is as nothing compared
to the advantage to be achieved. The
re-establishment of our merchant ma
rine involves in a large measure oune
continued industrial progress and
the extension of our commerce. I am
satisfied the judgment of the country
favors the policy of aid to our mer
chant marine, which will broaden our
commerce and upbuild our sea-carrying
capacity for the products of agricul
ture and manufacture, and which.
with the increase of our navy, mean
more work and more wages to our
countrymen, as well as a safeguard to
American interests in every part of the
world.
THE TRUST PROBLEM.
President McKinley Reviews the Differ
ent Laws Passed.
Combinations of capital organized in
to trusts to control the conditions of
trade among our citizens, to stifle com
petition, limit production and deter
mine the prices of products consumed
by the people are provoking public dis
cussion and should early claim the at
tention of congress.
The industrial commission, created by
the act of the congress of June 18, 189,.
has been engaged in extensive hearings
upon the dlieputed qiestions involved in
the suil e. oV f comn ination in restraint
of trod : outl .cmp -titin. They have
not yet rImpnll.ted their investigationl
of this subject and the conclusions and
recommendations at which they may
arrive are undetermined.
The subject is one giving rise to many
divergent views as to the nature- a:t1
variety or cause and extent of ti. in
juries to the public which may arise.
from large combinations concentratingl
more or less numerous enterpri.es and
establishments which previoil.s toit
formation of the combination were rear
ried on separately.
IL is universally crreded :that c.nt
binadaonr which engross or control the
market of any particular kind of mer
chandise or commodity necessary to the
general community by suppressing
natural and ordinary competition,
whereby prices are unduly enhanced to
the general consumer, are obnoxious
not only to the common law, but 'also to
the public welfare. There must be a
remedy for the evils involved in such
organizations. If the present law can
be extended more certainly to control
or check these monopolies or trusts, it
should be done without delay. What
ever power congress possesses over this
important subject should be promptly
ascertained and asserted.
Harrison's Message.
President Harrison, In his annual
message of December 3. 1889, says:
"Earnest attention should be given
by congress to a consideration of the
question how far the restraint of those
combinations of capital commonly call
ed 'trusts' is matter of federal juris
diction. When organized, as they often
a;e. to crush out all healthy competi
tion ,and to mono'polize the production
or sale of an article of commerce and
getnral necessity, they are dangerous
conspiracies against the public goo.l:
they should be made the subject of
prohibitory and even penal legislation."
Ant act to protect trade and com
merce against unlawful restraints and
monopolies was passed by congress on
July 2. 1890. The provisions of this
statute are comprehensive and string
ent. It declares every contract or
combilation in the form of a trust cr
otherw;.se a conspiracy in the restraint
of trade or commerce between sthe sev
erral states or foreign nations to be
unlawful. It denominates as a criminal
'very person who makes any such con
tract or engages in any such combina
tion or conspiracy and provides a pun
is'lment by fine or imprisonment. It
invests the several circuit courts of
the United States with jurisdiction to
prevent and restrain violations of the
act, and makes it the duty of the sev
eral United States district attorneys
under the direction of the attorney gen
eral to Institute proceedings in equity
to prevent and restrain such violations.
It further confers upon any person or
corporation, by reason of anything for
bidden or declared unlawful by the act,
the power to sue therefor in any cir
cull court in the United States without
respect to the amount in controversy,
and to recover three-fold the damages
by him sustained and the costs of the
sult, including reasonable attorney's
fees. It will be perceived that the act
is aimed at every kind of combination
in the nature of ,a trust or monopoly
in restraint of interstate or Internation
al tommerce.
Cleveland's Words.
President Cleveland, in his annual
message of Dec. 7, 1896, more than six
years subsequent to the enactment of
this law-after stating the evils of
these trust combinations, says:
"Though congress has attempted to
deal with this matter by legislation, the
laws passed for that purpose thus far
have proved ineffective, not because of
any lack of disposition or attempt to
enforce them, but simply because the
laws themselves as interpreted by the
courts do not reach the difflculy. If the
insufficiencies of the existing laws can
he remedied by further legislation it
should be done. The fact must be rec
ognized, however, that all federal leg
islation on this subject may fall short
of its purpose because of inherent ob
stacles and also because of the complex
chara!cter of our governmental system
which, while making the federal auth
ority supreme within its sphere, has
carefully limited that sphere by metes
and bounds which cannot be trans
gressed. The decision of our higest
court on this precise question renders
it quite doubtful whether the evils of
trusts and monopolies can be adequate
ly treated through federal action, un
less they seek indirectly and purposely
to include In their objects the transpor
tation and intercourse between states
or between the United States and for
eign countries.
"It does not follow, however, that
this is the limit of the remedy that
may be supplied. Even though it may
be found that federal authority is noe
broad enough to fully reach the case,
there can be no doubt of *the power of
the several state to act effectively in
the premises and there should be no
reason to doubt their willingness to
judiciously exercise such power."
The great diversity of treatment in
different states arising from this case
and the intimate relations of all parts
of the country to each other without re
garding state lines in the conduct of
business, have made the enforcement
of state laws difficult. It is apparent
that uniformity of legislation upon this
subject in the several states is much to
be desired. It is to be hoped that such
uniformity founded in a wise and just
discrimination between what is injur
ious and what is useful and necessary
in business operations may be obtain
ed and that means may be found for the
congress, within the limitations of its
constitutional power, to so supplement
an effective code of state legislation as
to make a complete system of law
throughout the United States, to compel
again observance of the salutary rules
to which I have referred.
The whole question is so important
and far reaching that I am sure no part
of it will be lightly considered, but
every phase of it will have the studied
deliberation of the congress, resulting
in wise and judicious action.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
Our Relations With Other Nation
Briefly Considered.
A review of our relatiolns with foreign
states is presented with such recom
mendations as are deemed appropriate.
The long pending boundary dispute
between the Argentine R',publlc and
Chill was settled in March last by the
award of an arbitration commission on
which the U:litdl States minister at
IBuenos Ayres sr-rved as umpire.
Progress h;is been made toward the
conclusion ,f a: convention of extradi
lion with ith' Argentine Republic. Hay
ing been advi'i. antd ,onstnted to by
th, I'Unite-d States senatet and ratified by
Argentina. It ·nsly awaits the adjust
ns:qn t of s onr slight changes in the
text itefcr ,,xchange.
In my last annual massage I adverted
to the claim of the Austro-Hungarian
government for indemnity for the kill
ing of certain Austrian and Hungarian
subjects by the authorities of the state
of Pennsylvania at Lattimer, while
suppressing an unlawful tumult of
miners, Sept. 10, 1897. In view of the
verdict of acquittal rendered by the
court before which the sheriff and his
deputies were tried for murder, and
following the established doctrine that
the government may not be held ac
countable for injuries suffered by indi
viduals at the hands of the Dublic
authorities while acting in the line of
duty in supressing disturbance of the
public peace, this government, after
due consideration of the claim advanc
ed by the Austro-Hungarian govern
ment, was constrained to decline lia
bility to indemnify the sufferers.
It is gratifying to be able to announce
that the Belgian government has miti
gated the restrictions on the importa
tion of cattle from the United States,
to 'which I referred in my last annual
message.
Having been invited by Belgium to
participate in a congress held at tBrus
sels to revise the provisions of the gen
eral act of July 2, 1890, for the repres
sion of the African slave trade, to
which the United States was a signa
tory party, this povernment preferred
not to be represented by a plenipoten
tiary but reserved the right of accession
to the result. Notable changes were
made, those especially referring to this
country being in the line of increased
restriction of the deleterious trade in
spirituous liquors with the native tribes,
which the government has from the out
set urgently advocated. The amended
general act will be laid before the sen
ate with the view to its advice and con
sent,
Revolution ....ivn.
Early in the year the peace of Bolivia
was disturbed by a successful insurrec
tion. The United States minister re
mained at his post attending to the
American interests in that quarter and
using besides his good offices for the
protection of the British subjects. in
the absence of their national represen
tative. On the establishment of the
new government our minister was di
rected to enter into relations there
with. General Pando, was elected pres
ident of Bolivia on Oct. 23.
Our representative has been in
structed to use all permissible friendly
endeavors to induce the government of
Bolivia to amend its marriage laws so
as to give legal status to the non-Cath
olic and civil marriages of aliens with
in its jurisdictlomt r
During the past summer two national
ships of the United States have visited
Brazilian ports -on a friendly mission
and have been cordially received. The
voyage of the Wilmington up the Ama
zon river gave rise to a passing mis
understanding, owing to the confusion
in obtaining permission to visit the in
-terior and make surveys in the interest
of navigation, but the incident found
ready adjustment in harmony with the
close relations of amity which this gov
ernment has always sought to cultivate
with the commonwealths of the West
ern continent.
The claim growing out of the seizure
of the American-owned newspaper, the
Panama Star and Herald, by the au
thorities of Colombia has been set
tled after a controversy of several
years by an agreement assessing at
$30,000 the indemnity to be paid by the
Colombian government in three in
stallments of $10,000 each.
The good will of Colombia toward
our country has been testified anew by
the cordial extension of facilities to the
Nicaraguan canal commission in their
approaching investigation of the Pana
ma canal and other projected routes
across the Isthmus of Darien.
Toward the end of October an in
surrectionary disturbance developed in
the Colombian republic. This move
ment has thus far not attained any
decisive result and is still in progress.
Discussion of the question raised by
the action of Denmark in Imposing re
strictions upon the Importation of
American meats has continued without
result in our favor.
The neighboring island republic of
Santo Domingo has lately been the
scene of a revolution following a long
period of tranquillity. It began with
the killing of President Heureaux in
July last and culminated in the re
linquishment by the succeeding vice
president of the reins of government
to the insurgents. The first act of the
provincial government was the calling
of a presidential and constituent elec
tion. Juan Isidore Jiminez having been
elected president, was inaugurated on
the 14th of November. Relations have
been entered :nto with the newly estab
lished government.
Central America.
The experimental association of Nica
ragua, Honduras and Salvador under
the title of the Greater Republic rf
Central America, when apparently on
the threshold of a complete federal or
ganization of the adoption of a consti
tution and the formation of a national
legislature, was disrupted in the last
days of November, 1098, by the with
drawal of Sal.ador. Thereupon Nica
ragua and Honduras abandoned the
joint compact, each resuming its form
er independent sovereignty. This was
followed by the reception of Minister
Merry by the republics of Nicaragua
and Salvador while Minister Hunter in
turn presented his credentials to the
government of Honduras, thus revert
ing to the old distribution of the diplo
matic agencies of the United States in
Central America, for which our ex
isting statutes provide.
A Nicaraguan envoy has been accred
ited to the United States. An insur
rectionary movement under General
Reys broke out at Bluefelds in Feb
ruary last, and for some time exercised
actual control of the Mosquito territory.
The Detroit was promptly sent thitiher
for the protection of Americtan inter
ests. After a few weeks the Reyes
government renounced the government.
During the interregnum certain publ!e
duties accruing under Nicaraguan lawo
were collected from American mer
chants by the agents of the government
for the time being in administrative
control. Upon the titular government re
gaining power, a second payment of
these duties was demanded. Contro
versy arose touching the validity of the
oliginal payment to the de facto regent
of the territory. An arrangement was
effected in April last by ,the United
States minister and the foreign secre
tary of Nicaragua whereby the
amountsofthe duplicate payments were
deposited with the British consul pend
ing an adjustment of the matter by di
rect agreement between the govern
ments of the United States and Nicara
gua. The controversy is still unset
tied.
The contract of the Maritime Canal
company of Nicaragua was declared
forfeited by the Nicaraguan govern
ment on Oct. 10 on the ground of non
fulfillment with the 10 years' term stip
ulated in the contract. The Maritime
Canal company has lodged a protest
against this action, alleging rights in
the premises which appear worthy of
consideration. This government ex
pects that Nicaragua will afford the
protestants a full and fair hearing
upon the merits of the case.
The Nicaragua Canal.
The Nicaragua canal commission,
which had been engaged upon the work
of examination and survey for a ship
canal route across Nicaragua, having
completed its labors and made its re
port, was dissolved on May 31, and on
June 10 a new commission, known as
the Isthmian canal commission, was or
ganized under the terms of the act ap
proved on March :, 1899. for the pur
pose of examining the American isth
mus with a view of determining the
most practicable and feasible route for
a ship canal across that isthums, with
its probable cost and other essential
details.
This commission, under the presidency
of Rear Admiral John G. Walker, Ui.
S. N. (retired), entered promptly uponi
the work Intrusted to it and is now car
rying on examinations in Nicaragua
along thetroute of the Panama canal,
and in Dadrien from the Atlantic, in the
neighborhood of the Atratic river, to
the bay of Panama, on the Pacific side.
-Good progress has been made, but un
der the law a comprehensive and com
plete investigation is called for, which
will require much labor and consider
able time for its accomplishment. The
work will be prosecuted as expeditious
ly as possible and a report will lie
made at the earliest practicable date.
The great importance of this workl
cannot be too often or too strongly
pressed upon the attention of the con
gress. In my message of a year ago, I
expressed my views of the necessity of
*a canal which would link the two great
oceans, to which I again invite your
consideration. The reasons then pre
sented for early action are even strong
er now.
A pleasing incident in the relations of
this government with that of Chili oc
curred in the generous assistance given
to the warship Newark, when in dis
tress in Chllian waters. Not alone in
this way has the friendly disposition
of Chili found expression. That coun
try has acceded to the convention for
the establishment of the bureau of the
American republics, in which organiza
tion every independent state of the
continent now shares.
The exchange of ratifications of a
convention for the revival of the United
States and Chillan claims commission
and for the adjudication of the claims
heretofore presented, but not determin
ed during the life of the previous com
mission, has been delayed by reason of
the necessity for fresh action by the
Chillan senate upon the amendments
attached 'to the ratification of the
treaty by the United States senate. This
formality is soon to be accomplished.
Trade With China.
American capital has sought and
found various opportunities for compet
ing to carry out the international im
provements which the imperial Chinese
government is wisely encouraging and
to develop the natural resources of the
empire. Our trade with China has con
tinued to grow and our commercial
rights under existing treaties have been
everywhere maintained during the past
year, as they will be in the future. The
extension of the area offered to In
ternational foreign settlement at
Shanghai and the opening of the ports
of Naking, KClao Chou and Talien Wan
to foreign trade and settlement will
doubtless afford American enterprise
additional facilities and new fields, of
which it will not be slow to take ad
vantage. In my message to congress
of Dec. 5, 1898, I urged that the recom
mendation which had been made to the
speaker of the house of representatives
by the secretary of the treasury on
June 14, .1898, for an appropriation for
a commission to study the commercial
and industrial conditions in the Chi
nese empire and report as to the oppor
tunities for and obstacles to the en
largement of markets in China for the
raw products and manufactures of the
United States should receive at your
hands the consideration which its im
portance merits, but the congress failed
to take action. I now renew this recom
mendation, as the importance of the

THE FRENCH EXPOSITION.
An Opportunity to Teach the World
a GOreat Lesaon.
The death of President Faure in Feb
ruary last called forth those sincere ex
pressions of sympathy which befit the
relations of two republics as closely al
lied by unbroken historic ties as are
the United States and France.
Preparations for the representation of
the industries, arts and products of the
United States at the world's exposition,
to be held in Paris next year, continue
on an elaborate and comprehensive
scale, thanks to the generous appropria
tin provided by congress and to the
friendly interest the French govern
ment has shown in furthering a typical
exhibit of American progress.
There has been alloted to the United
States a considerable addition of space,
which, while placing our country in the
first rank among exhibitors, does not
suffice to meet the increasingly urgent
demands of our merits. The efforts of
the commissioner general are ably di
rieted toward a strictly representative
display of all that most characterlati
cally marks American achievements in
the inventive arts and most adequately
shows the excellence of our natural
productions.
In this state of keen rivalry among na
tions for mastery in commerce the doc
trine of evolution and the rule of the
sur4ival of the fittest must be as inex
orable in their operation as they
are positive in the results they
bring about. The, place won
in the struggle by an indus
trial people can only be held by unre
laxed endeavor and constant advance
in achievement. The present extraord
inary impetus in every line of Ameri
can exportation and increase in the vol
ume of value of our share in the world's
markets may not be attributed to acci
dental conditions.
American Energy.
The reasons are not far to seek. They
lie deep in our national character and
find expression in every branch of han
dicraft in every new device whereby
the materials we so abundantly produce
are subdued to the artisan's will and
made to yield the largest, most practi
cal and most beneficial return. The
American exhibit at Paris should, and I
am confident will, be :n o)ln volume,
while lessons of skillfully directed en
deavor, unfaltering energy and con
summate performance may be read by
all on every page, thus spreading
abroad a clearer knowledge of the
worth of our productions and the quec
tion of our claim to an important place
in the marts of the world. To accom
plish this by judicious selection, by rec
ognition of paramount merit in what
ever walk of trade and manufacture it
may appear and by orderly classifica
tion and attractive installation is the
task of our commission.
Tile United States government build
ing is approaching completion and no
effort will he spared to make it worthy
in beauty of architectural plan and in
completeness of display to represent
our nation. It has been suggested that
a permanent building of similar or ap
propriate design be erected on a con
venient site already given by the muni
cipality near the exposition grounds to
serve in commemoration of the part
taken by this country in this great en
terprise, as an American national in
stitute for our countrymen resorting to
Paris for study.
I am informed by our commissioner
general that we shall have in the
American sections at Paris over 7,000
exhibitors, from every state in our coun
try, a number 10 times ai great as
those which were represented at Vien
na in 1873, and four times as many as
those who exhibited in Paris in 1889.
This statement does not include the ex
hibits from either Cuba, Porto Rico or
Hawaii, for which arrangements have
been made.
A number of important international
congresses on special topics affecting
public interests are proposed to be held
in Paris next summer in connection
with the exposition. Effort will be
made to have several technical branches
of our administration efficiently repre
sented at these conferences, each in its
special line, and to procure the largest
possible.concourse of state representa
tives, particularly at .the congresses of
Ilhlie thnariy and of medicine.
Relations WiVth Germany.
Our relations with Germany continue
to be most cordial. The increasing inti
macy of direct association has been
marked during the year by the grant
ing of permission for the landing on our
shores of a cable from Boskum Emden.
on the North sea, by way of the Azores,
and also by the conclusion on Sept 2. of
a parcel post agreement with
the German empire. In all
that promises closer relations of
intercourse and commerce and a better
understanding between the two races
having so many traits in common, Ger
many can be assured of the most cor
dial co-operation of this government
and people. We may be rivals in many
material paths,but our rivalryshould be
generous and open, ever aiming toward
the attainment of large results and the
most beneficial advancement of each in
the line of its especial adaptability. The
several governments of the empire seem
reluctant to admit the excellence of our
food products and to accept the evi
dence we constantly tender of the care
with which their purity is guarded by
rigid inspection from the farm, through
the slaughter house and the packing es
tablishments to the port of shipment.
Our system of control over exported
food staples invites examination from
any quarter and challenges respect by
Its efficient thoroughness.
It is to be hoped that in time the two
governments will act in common ac
cord toward the realization of their
common purpose to safeguard the pub
lie health and to the insuring of the
purity and wholesomeness of all food
products imported by either country
from the other. Were the congress to
authorize an invitation to Germany in
accordance with the pending reci
procity negotiations for the consti
tution of a joint commission of scl
entilie experts and practical men of
affairs to conduct a searching investi
gation of food production and exporta
tion in both countries and report to
their respective legislatures for the
adoption of such remedial measures
as they might recommend for teiter,
the way might be opened for the desir
able result indicated.
Efforts to obtain for American life
insurance companies a fell hearing os
to their business operations in Pru.ala
have, after several years of patient
representation, happily succeeded nrid
one of the most important American
companies has been granted a conces
sion to continue business in that king
dom.
I am also glad to announce that the
German insurance companies have been
readmitted by the superintendent of
insurance to do business in the state of
New York.
Subsequent to the exchange of
our peace treaty with Spain Germany
acquired the Caroline islands by pur
chase, paying therefor $5,000,000. As
surances have been received from the
German government that the rights of
American missionaries and traders
there will be considerately observed.
High Joint Comlission.
In my last annual message I referred
to the pending negotiations with Great
Britain in respect to the Dominion of
Canada. By means of an executive
agreement a joint high commission had
been created for the purpose of ad
justing all unsettled questions between
the United States and Canada, em
bracing 12 subjects, among which were
the questions of the fur seals, the fish
eries of the coast and contiguous in
land waters, the Alaskan boundary, the
transit of merchandise in bond, the
alien labor laws. mining rights, reci
procity in trade, revision of the agree
ment respecting naval vessels in the
Great Lakes. a more complete marking
of parts of the boundary, provision for
the conveyance of criminals and for
wrecking and salvage.
Much progress had been made by the
commission towards the adjustment of
many of these questions when it be
came apparent that an irreconcilable
difference of views was entertained re
specting the delimination of the Alas
lean boundary. In the failure of an
agreement to the meaning of articles 3
and 4 of the treaty of 1825 between Rus
sia and Great Britain which defined the
boundary between Alaska and Canada.
the American commissioners proposed
that the subject of the boundary be laid
aside and that the remaining questions
of difference be preceded with, some of
which were so far advanced as to as
sure the probability of a settlement.
This being declined by the British e om
missioners, an adjournment was taken
until the boundary should be adjusted
by the two governments.
The subject received the careful at
tention which its importance demands,
with the result that a modus vivendi
for provisional demarkations in the re
gion about the head of Lynn canal has
been agreed upon and it is hoped that
the negotiations now in progress be
tween the two governments will end
in an agreement for the establishment
and delimination of a permanent boun
dary.
apart from these questions growing
out of our relationship with our north
ern neighbors the most friendly dispo
sitiotn and ready agreement have
marked the discussion of the numerous
matters arising in the vast and inti
mate intercourse of the United States
with Great Britain.
The 1Boer War.
This government has maintained an
attitude of neutrality in the unfortun
ate contest between Great Britain and
the Boer states of Africa. We have re
mained faithful to the precept of avoid
ing entangling alliances as to affairs
not of our own direct concern. Had
circumstances suggested that the par
ties to the quarrel would have wel
comed any kind expression of the hope
of the American people that the war
might be avoided our good offices would
have been gladly tendered. The Unitedl
States representative at Pretoria was
eatly instructed to see that all neutral
American interests be respected by the
combatants. This has been an easy
task in view of the positive declarations
of both British and Boer authorities
that the personal and property rights
of our citizens should be observed.
Upon the withdrawal of the British
agent from Pretoria the United States
consul was authorized, upon the request
of the British government and with the
assent of the South African and Orange
Free State governments. to exercise the
customary good offices of a neutral for
the care of British interests. In the
discharge of this function, I am happy
to say that abundant opportunity has
been afforded to show the impartiality
of this government to both the com
batants.
LYNCHING OF ITALIANS.
A Serious Defect in the Scope of
Federal Laws.
For the fourth time in the present
decade the question has arisen with the
government of Italy in regard to lynch
ing of Italian subjects. The latest of
these deplorable events occurred at
Tallulah, La., whereby five unfortun
ates of Italian origin were taken from
jail and hanged.
The authorities of the state and a
representative of the Italian embassy
having separately investigated the oc
currences with discrepant results, par
ticularly as to the alleged citizenship of
the victims, and it not appearing that
the state had been able to ulscover and
punish the ' iolators of the law, an in
dependent investigation has been set
on foot through the agency of the de
partment of state and is still in prog
ress. The result will enable the execu
tive to treat the question with the gov
ernmnent of Italy in a spirit of fairness
and justice. A satisfactory solution will
doubtless be reached. The recurrence
of these distressing manifestations of
blind mob fury directed at dependents
or nativeS of a foreign country sug
gests that the contingency has arisen
for action by congress in the direction
of conferring upon the federal courts
jurisdiction in this class of international
cases, where the responsibility of the
federal government may be involved.
The suggestion is not new. In his an
nual message of Dec. 9, 1891, my prede
cessor, President Harrison, said:
"It would, 1 believe, be entirely com
petent for congress to make offenses
against the treaty rights of foreigners
domiciled in the United States cogniz
able in the federal courts. This has not,
however, been done, and the federal of
ficers and courts have no powers in
such cases to intervene either for the
protection of a foreign citizen or for
the punishment of his slayers. It seems
to me to follow, in this state of the law,
that the officers of the state charged
with pollee and judicial powers in such
cases must, in the consideration of in
ternational questions growing out of
such incidents, be regarded in such
sense as federal agents, as to make
this government answerable for their
action in cases where it would be an
swerable if the United States had used
its constitutional power to define and
punish crimes against treaty rights."
Rights of Aliens.
A bill to provide for the punishment
of violations of treaty rights of aliens
was introduced in the senate March 1.
1892. and reported favorably.
