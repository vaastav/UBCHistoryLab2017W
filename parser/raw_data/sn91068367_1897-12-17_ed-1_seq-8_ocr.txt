Washing-ton, Iecember 14. The sen
ate was in session Just fifteen minutes
today, adjournment being1 taken-until
ftomcrrow out of respect to President
IMcKlnley-who 1s today in attendance
upon, the funeral of his mother. The
amotion to adjourn, was made 'by Sen
ator Hoar. "All senators." said he,
"are aware of the gTeat calamnity that
has "overtaken the chief magistrate of
the nation. He Is today in attendance
upon the funeral of hi3 mother. Out
of respect to him and as an expression
of our sympathy for him in his afflic
tion, I move that the senate do now
adjourn."
No business beyond the introduction
of "bills and resolutions was transacted.
Among- the bills introduced was one
!by Senator Klye, of South Dakota, to
change the immigration laws of the
Uniited States. He guve notice that at
the proper time he would offer the bill
as 'a substitute for that which is now.
jendln& before the senate.
'Tn only-one feature," said Senator
.Kyleif'does my bill differ materially
from the measure now before the sen
ate. My bill provides that all immi
grants shall liave their test of educa
tion made by the Uuited States consuls
at t'he points nearest to their homes.
It 1s a serious hardship for these people
to cross the ocean with the prospect
BtariTir them in the face of failing- in
tire teat at the port of a foreign coun
try." At 2:15 p. m., the senate adjourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
The house totiay after a session of
about two hours, adjourned out of
sympathy for the president, whose
mother was buried at Oanton fhis af-
ternoon. The time of the session was
devoted to the consideration of the leg
islative, executive and judicial appro
priation bill.
Mr. Bingham, republican, of Pennsyl
vania, In charge of the measure, ex
plained its provisions in -detail. He
aid lie would offer an amendment to
reduce the clerical force In the pension
office by 96 clerks, involving a reduction
of $115,000 in salaries. This reduction
did not appear in the bill as reported
and must be reckoned in the new
totals.
Mr. Bingham said that he and Ihis
colleagues on the appropriations com
andtte felt satisfied that a reduction of
from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000 could be
made in the -salaries of subordinate of
ficers by a process of weeding, with
out in any way impairing the govern
ment service, and, therefore, every sug
gestion from heads of departments for
increase of salaries had been rejected.
(He called attention to the provision of
the 'bill curtailing the sick leave allowed
clerks which had 'been greatly abused.
Investigation, lhad shown that in addi
tion to the regular thirty day leave, 16
. per cent, of the clerks obtained each
year thirty day sick leaves.
Mr. Bingham did not discuss the ap
propriations providing for the main
tenance of the civil service commission,
tout stated that the widest latitude
would be allowed for debate, even if it
should run over the holiday recess.
He asked, however, that the provisions
of t'he bill relating to the civil service
and the debate thereon should go over
until after the consideration of the
other features of the bill were con
cluded. His request was agreed and an
Ivour and a half was set aside for gen
eral debate on t'he rest of the bill.
Mr. Barrett, republican, of Massachu
setts, took the floor and made some
general remarks in support of the civil
service law In t'he course of which he
referred to the slender minority against
the civil service law when it was
passed the house in 1883. The vote
stood 155 to 47. But three of that mi
nority ihe said, were now members of
the house -Messrs. Bland, democrat, of
Missouri; McMillan, democrat, of Ten
nessee, and Steele, republican, of In
diana. This statement flushed a series
of explanations that gave the anti
civil service members repeated oppor
tunities to applaud. 'First Mr. Steele
said he had never had occasion to apol
ogize for that vote. Then Mr. Brumm,
republican, of Pennsylvania called at
tention to the fact that his name as one
of those who voted against the measure
had ibeen overlooked. tHe was proud,
ihe said, to be included In the "roll of
honor." Mr. Marsh, republican, of
Illinois, also claimed a place in the list
and added that he had never cast a
vote with which he was better satisfied.
Then Messrs. Cannon, republican, of
Illinois and Bingham reiterated their
opposition to the broad extension of the
law by executive orders. The latter ex
plained that the law was passed under
suspension of the rules, practically
without debate and never contemplated
an extension by executive orders that
would cover 87,000 government em
ployees. There was much applause and
laughter during this series of state
ments and Mr. Dockery, democrat, of
Missouri, suggested that the members
of the other side to save time, have
leave to file apologies for voting for
the law.
Mr. Moody, republican, of Massachusetts,-
said he was willing to give a
hearing on the civil service question
and he did no propose to give a judg
ment in advance..
Mr. Grosvenor commended this state
ment. All he asked was that the house
should honestly consider the question
and give its careful judgment.
Mr. "Doekerv. democrat, of Illinois.
discussed the amazing 'growth of the
expenditures of the government during
the recent- years. The ordinary ex
penses of the government, exvlusive of
the public debt In the last eight years
exceed those of the preceding eight
years "by $1,000,000,000 in round numbers.
In view of this fact there were only
two ways, he said, to bring the receipts
.and expenses together. Either taxa
tion must be increased or the expenses
must be curtailed. If the expenses
were to be reduced congress alone
could not accomplish much without the
aid of the executive branch of the gov
ernment. Despite the president's ap
peal, in his message for economy, the
executive (branches of the government
had submitted to congress estimates
for appropriations of $27,000,000 in ex
cess of the appropriations for the cur
rent year.
At this point the committee rose and
Mr. Grosvenor, republican, of Ohio, ad
dressing the chair said:
''Mr. Speaker: As Is well known, the
funeral exercises of the mother of the
chief magistrate of the nation are to
take place at this hour and therefore,
conforming to the action of the senate
and as a token of our sympathy and
respect for the president, I move that
the house do now adjourn."
The motion was unanimously carried
and at 1:45 the house adjourned until
tomorrow.
SWAPPING OFFICES
Superintendent Smith and Agricultural
Commissioner Mewboorne Resign Each
Is to Succeed the Other
(Special to The Messenger.)
Raleigh, N. C, December 14. Great
surprised Is expressed here this even
fag at the news that Jame3 M. Mew
boorne has regned as commissioner of
agriculture, to take effect December
31st, and that the hoard of agriculture
has accepted his resignation. Thl3
was done at a late hour. It is the re
sult of a deal by which he (becomes
superintendent of the penitentiary,
vice John R. Smith, and the latter Is
elected to succeed him as agricultural
commissioner. The reason given: . for
this step is that Mewboorne is consider
ed a far more able manager than
Smith. The deal is made by Governor
Russell. The penitentiary hoard will
next week elect Mewhoorne.
A populist state official was asked
tonight to give the true inwardness of
;the swap of offices hy Mewboorne and
Smith and said:
"The governor was bent on getting
rid of Smith as the pententiary super
intendent and was on the point of hav
ing him dropped, lie was greatly dis
satisfied with his administration and
his had financial management. Smith,
I am told, -bought far more cotton bag
ging, for instance, than there was any
need for and would hny a $150 horse
when a $75 one would have served the
purpose equally as -well. Than, as I am
told, Smith has fifty more employes
than there is any need for. Mew
hoorne Is a good farmer and manager,
and will get rid of these surplus peo
ple. John R. Smith and his friends
are placated (by him being made agri
culture! commissioner. He can hold
that place all right. It will be no
strain on him."

THE FORT FISHER SLANDER
General Bragg's Letter Was First Publish
ed in the Philadelphia Times in 1880.
The Commander of Fisher to Answer it
In Next Sunday's Messenger
The republication of General Bragg's
slanderous letter reflecting upon the
heroes who so gallantly defended Fort
Fisher, has naturally stirred up the in
dignation of the survivors who stood in
the breech against the overwhelming
odds which Bragg allowed to sweep down
-upon them. The Messenger Sunday pub
lished some communications refuting the
statements made by General Bragg, and
next Sunday we will publish an article
by Colonel William Lamb, who com
manded Fort Fisher at its fall, and who
is In the best position to refute the slan
der put upon him and the noble men who
successfully held Fort Fisher up to with
in a few months of the surrender of Lee's
army itself.
In response to a letter from the pro
prietors of The Messenger to Colonel
Lamb, he writes us that Braggjs letter
was first published in The Philadelphia
Times in 1880, and in reply to our letter
requesting him to give The Messenger
an article on the matter, he writes us
that he will send us a reply and says: "It
is considered a full vindication of the
chivalrous "Whiting an my heroic garri
son." In this connection we publish with
pleasure the following:
Wilmington, N. C, December 14.
Messrs. Jackson & Bell:
As one of the younger generation, in
terested in all that concerns tike honor
of the south and especially North Car
olina, I felt like writing something when
I read "the letter written by General
Bragg about Fort Fisher: but I did not,
hoping some old veteran, better able to
write and more entitled to a hearing,
would reply to the manifestly false and
grossly unjust statements that so basely
reflected Upon the brave defenders of the
last gateway of the confederacy in their
final struggle against overwhelming
odds; and now, in the name of young
men of our state and city, I wish to
thank Mr. James A. Montgomery and
the others who have, through your col
umns, so fully answered General Bragg's
disgusting letter. Tours very truly,
W. M. CUMMING.
The Old North State Forerer
Our southern mail brought us the fol
lowing from a North Carolinian and
former Wilmlngtonian:
Oca a, Fla., December 11.
Editors Messenger:
Can you supply me with the words to
the song "Carolina," or "The Old North
State?" We are to have a "possum and
'tater" supper on Friday, December 17th.
and want to sing our state song, but I
cart find no copy here and our memories
are treacherous. No doubt, you can ob
tain the words for us there, and if you
will send them to me so as to reach us in
time for that event we will appreciate it.
Yours trul,
W. L. JEWETT.
Secretary N. C. Association.
It Is hardly necessary for us to say
that The Messenger complied with pleas
ure with the request made above. The
words to our stirring state song were
promptly forwarded to her sons, whp,
though absent in Florida, will 'cherish,
protect and defend her,"- " '.

Raleigh, (N. C, Dec. 14.
A legislative official was asked today
the question:., "What are the populists
talking about?" He is a populist and
ought to know. He replied: "Do riot use
my name and I will tell you. They are
saying they don't want any more fu
sion with the republicans. That is" the
milk in the cocoamit,"
State Librarian Cobb, of thehwpulist
committee, was asked why he made so
absurd a statement as to say 60,000
populists would vote their tickets if
there are no "side issues." He replied:
"They will come up whenever needed,
We will press the button and they
will do the rest. We expect recruits
from both the old parties." This is
absurd, for there are not at this mo
ment 20,000 populists in the state.
The supreme court will at its next
term pass upon the power of the rail
way commission to regulate the freight
rate on cotton. This comes tip in the
shape of an appeal by the Seaboard
iAir Line from the recent order reduc
ing rates.
The joint committee of the legisla
ture this morning began the annual
examination of the state treasury.
The Baptist convention, Which end
ed its session yesterday, is pronounced
the best one ever held in. the state, in
all respects. Next year it meets at
Greeneville.
Joseph F. Scott, H. M. Blackstone
and Fred. G. Pettigrove, all members
of the Massachusetts Prison Reform As
sociation, are here. They inspected
the convict camps in Georgia and dis
like the pystem in. vogue there. The
real power there is the physician at
the camp. They visited the penitenti
ary here and will have a look at the
convict farms. They say Massachu
setts, owing to the clamor of the peo
ple against manufacturing by con
victs, Is beginning to try outdoor la
bor in a small way.
There are fifty-five prisoners in the
small county Jail here, nearly all fed
eral prisoners or persons sent from
other counties for safe-keeping. The
jail is over crowded, and United States
District Attorney Aycock says arrange
ments ought to be made for keeping
the excess of prisoners in the peniten
tiary. Before the supreme court this week,
the most interesting case Is that of
Rhyne against Roberts, involving the
constitutionality of the act of the last
legislature, which confers civil juris
diction upon a judge of the criminal
circuit court. In this case the act gives
Judge Evvart civil power.
The term of the United States court
here ended yesterday afternoon. There
were 110 criminal cases tried, and twenty-five
persons were sent to jails, sev
en to the pententiary at Columbus, O.,
and two to the reformatory . at Wash
ington. It is remarked by the court
officers that the grand jury was the
poorest ever seen here. It is said that
one of its members had been indicted
for moonshining. One juror admitted
that it was the poorest jury he had
ever seen, and that against some men
ready to submit no true bill was found.
It is learned that Dr. Kirby H.
Smith, albout whom so great a scandal
was raised at the pententiary, has re
turned (from New York to Goldsbore,
and says he is going south, presum
ably to Florida, where he lived ten
years.
The Baptist state convention raised
$5,000 for the completion of the Bap
tist state female university here. This
imposing building will certainly be
completed next summer.
The shoe factory at the Farmers'
State Alliance at Hillsboro regularly
(began work yesterday, after over two
years idleness.
The state commissioner of agricul
ture say there are now 2,000,000 acres
of waste land in t'he southeastern
counties, which if in timher, would
yieM returns at the rate of obout $500,
000 a year. The loss is due to. lack of
care in growing pine trees on these
lands.
At the meeting of the Raleigh cham
her of commerce this evening, Robert
C. Strong read a paper on fire Insur
ance rates here, prepared at the re
quest of the organization. He says the
amount of fire losses paid here annual
ly averages $6,073, while $40,000 is an
nually paid In premiums; that the
Southeastern! Traffic Associations
claims Raleigh has a lower rate than
any place in the state, while the rate
at Greenshoro is only half of that here.
The companies claim they make only
7 per cent. " in their business (taking
the entire state) on capital invested.
Last year $35,000,000 was written and
the premiums were $787,500, while the
losses paid aggregated $313,000, making
a gross profit of $474,500. The cost of
doing business was about $145,475,
leaving a profit of $329,025. The report
says many citizens here find the rates
so high that they carry their own in
surance. As a rule, the companies will
not lend their money in this state. The
money made by the companies in this
state goes altogether outside of it, to
be invested at a less rate of inerest
than would be paid for it here.

Insurgents Dynamite Train Ro mors of
Salclde of General Garcia Refugees Al
lowed to Return
Havana. December 14. The Insurgents
dynamited the railroad between Can as
and Dagame, province of Pinar del Rio,
destroying the track and wrecking the
engine of a freight train. A force of
troops with a repairing gang was sent to
the scene of the outrage, where they
found a dynamite bomb and arrested the
men who caused the explosion. The line
was repaired."
The insurgents attacked the landing
place at Gibara, province of Santiago de
Cuba, but were repulsed with loss, ac
cording to the official report. They are
also said to have fired upon the town of
Cupecillas, without result.
General Pando is still directing the op

Cauto, province of Santiago de Cubit,
but has been unable to arrive at the
landing place, owing, it is officially stat
ed, to an obstacle in the river.
Reports received here from Manzanillo
say it is reported that Calixto Garcia,
the insurgent leader, has committed sui

even in official circles.
Washington, December 14. The follow

"To the Spanish Minister:
4,In addition to the cablegram of No

these cases, your excellency can assure
them that In this island .their personal
safety, their families and their estates

Gross Mismanagement at State Farms
(Corresipendence of The Messenger.)
Weldon, X. C, Dec. 14.
The penitentiary executive commit
tee turned off Underwood and Captain
Ttheen and then put Dockery in a name
less office at $40 per month. "Why did
they do this? Is it because he is a
brother of the chairman?. Why do
they retain Hughes: a man who, it is
said, has made an overseer of a con
vict, and who has degraded our coun
tyman, Mr. 'Mosely, by making- him
carry water to the convicts and actual
ly pick cotton. It is said that Hughes
has fitted up a room upstaLrs in the
supervisor's residence for his cook, and
theTe are- some other things connected
with this matter that the executive
committee should investigate. It is
also stated that one of his men, an
Indian, whose term is ten years, goes
trapping every day.
Some state papers, in sympathy with
the present management, are condemn
ing the democratic press for comments
on the mismanagement. But this prop
erty belongs to the state and the peo
le have a right to know how it is man
aged. If the charges made in this cor
respondence are untrue, let them be
shown to be so, and I will gladly
apologize. It is certain that there is
poor management now, and as to the
boasted crop's, the major part was
raised by democratic supervisors.
There are said to be 500 bales of cot
ton still in the fields and prohably 100
bales on the ground or damaged by
reason of the failure to save it in time,
while under proper management, this
would not have been the case.
If the -penitentiary authorities had
sent these convicts to save this crop
instead of chasing rwill-'o-the-wisp
contracts up and down the railroads,
t'he state would be several thousand
dollars ahead.
These are matters the people
the state are interested in.
To Hear Contests In the Home
Washington, December 14. The con

Washington visitors, and many other
intimate -friends of the family from
various points.
As the casket containing the remains

chancel rail, the Aeolian quartette of
male voices chanted "Still, Still with
Thee," Rev. E. P. Herbruck, of Trinity
Reformed church, whose pastorate In
Canton is of the longest of the local
clergy, offered a fervent prayer. This
was followed .by the reading of the

of the First M. E. church for several
years, delivered a short oration, in
which he dwelt upon the charcter of
the beloved departed and spoke of her
as she was known by the neighbors
and friends in Canton.
After singing "Nearer, My God to
Thee," ibenediction was pronounced by
Rev. Dr. McAfee, of Columbus, pastor
of the Broad Street Methodist church,
of Columbus, which the president at

Mr. Manchester and the reading of the
Twenty-third Psalm by the Rev. Dr.
McAfee.
The church Was beautiful with the
wealth of flowers sent by the people of
the nation and with the rich drapery
of mourning with which it had been
arranged by the officers of the church.
The exercises at the grave were sim
ple. The casket was lowered into the
