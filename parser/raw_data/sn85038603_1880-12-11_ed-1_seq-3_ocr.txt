A GOOD MAN DEAD.
Just as we go to press our communi
ty is in deep distress at the death of
our prominent and distinguished
townsman Capt. J. N. Atkinson. Our
limited space will not permit of a no
tice that could possibly do justice to
his memory, which we will attempt
in our next issue. Summit Times.
Few men in the State of Mississippi
were better entitled to the high char
acter designated by the phrase, "a
good man." He was a successful
merchant, and an industrious and ac
complished business man, but his for
tune was sadly impaired, if not des
troyed by too great a disposition to
lift up the fallen and aid the needy
Full of generosity, he was an easy
victim to the appeals of those in want.
There are to-day, scattered all over
the counties of South Mississippi,
scotch of men and women, who will
call to their minds many acts of dis
interested liberality from bis hands,
and will pay to his memory the
tribute of a tear. A genial friend, a
useful and public-spirited citizen, a
loving father and husband were lost
when the cold soil covered the re
mains of Capt. J. N. Atkinson
Jones' philosophy is not bounded by
a thanksgiving dinner in the figura
tive sense of the phrase. He has been
an editor too long not to be able to
appreciate the sustaining force of a
vivid imagination where there is noth
ing but air for it to act on. When,
therefore, a thanksgiving ep.cli oc
curs, and the turkey eat non, or when
Jones' affections run out and are pro
fusely and liberally distributed among
eleven hundred delinquent subscri
lers, and lie calls upon them in the
most touching and endearing language
to "come up," and, like the spirits of
the vasty deep, they don't come,
Jones lias a remedy in either case. In
the difficulty about the turkey he
takes his revenge out on an honest
pie ce of roast beef, and demonstrates
to the satisfaction of his anxious
readers that a true and dignified pa
triot can be abundantly thankful on
beof and sweet potatoes. In fact, he
undertakes to prove, and does ably
sustain the grand historical proposition
that sweet potatoes are the original
vegi tables which started the growth
of patriotism in America. He trium
phantly cites the case of Gen. Francis
Marion, of South Carolina, one of the
gieat founders, pioneers and defenders
of liberty, and shows the effect which
sweet potatoes had on him He con
tends that the patriotism produced by
the modern sweet potato is as genuine
as it was in the days of Marion, and
emphatically explodes the theory that
there is any gasseous deterioration
of the growth.
In reference to the circumstance of
the unanimous absence of the delin
quents, be is equal to that too. That
sort of vote does not make him blue.
He reasons himself over the seeming
neglect to respond to his affectionate
overtures. These delinquents are
strong personal friends, and they are
only waiting for their subscriptions to
grow large enough to enable Jones to
become opulent and easy when they
do pay up. If they should recklessly
rusli forwaul and pay up now, the
amounts are comparatively small, and
Jones could manage to squander every
one of them before he invested in
United Stales bonds ; and iq our opin
ion lie would be sure to do it, because
we know him to be the soul ol liber
ality. If a friend of his needs a dol
lar Jones will lend it to him if he lias
to borrow it from somebody else. The
delinquents know this, and they per
haps, intend to take care of Jones in
spite of him. After lie tuns the Ad
vance until lie gets as old as the Vet
eran of the Mercury, who started
out on his jourualietie career when
the morning stars liegan to sing,
he will have an amount due him
worth talking about. Then when a
delinquent does happen to pay up lie
can buy a bond and provide for his
old age.
rhere is nothing like philosophy,
but it takes a good article of it to look
far enough ahead to see wealth from
the ever-aeumulating "claims for de
linquent subscriptions. Jones, how
ever, has the gift, and therein lies the
beautiful serenity of his temper.

AH exchange says, "There is a con
siderable interest taken in the ques
tion of calling an extra session of the

is an offyear in our destiny, and when
ever an exigency like that comes
around our sotons should give the peo
ple the lienelil of their views on nation

modify existing relations so as to
make them conform to the logic of

consult the wisiies of the people before
he concludes to call an extra session,
as also the imperious necessity of the

be advisable for him to call the legis

All we have to say is, if the Gov

The Presidential Electors for Missis
sippi, who met last Wednesday, after east
ing the eight votes of the State for Gen.
Hancock, for President, and Mr. English
for Vice-President, elected one of their
own somber, (the Hon. c. B. Mitchell, of
Pontotoc.) m Sanger to curry the vote to
Washington, and deliver it in person to
the President of the Senate of the United
state.
In this selection of a messenger we must
say that our electors did neither a gracious
nor a graceful a(,t There are at least a
hundred young, ardcut and active Demo
crats in the State who would have accepted
the position of messenger as a compliment,
ami to one of those it should have been
given. It would have afforded an active
young worker for the right, an opportu
nity to visit the capital of the country at
an Interesting period, and to such an one
the position should have been offered. We
have not the houor to be a personal ac
quantanee of Mr. Mitchell, but all that
we have heard of him is in his favor. He
is reputed to be a gentleman, a sound Dem
ocrat, a man of line ability, and a forcible,
pleasing speaker. We hold, however, that
in being made a Presidential Elector, he
was sufficiently honored, and should have
been content, lie should have been above
asking his co-electors for a paltry, subordi
nate place, and tlie should have had the
firmness to have refused his demand. It
was not graceful nor gracious for hiin to ask
it, and it should have been promptly denied.
It is this selfish and inordinate greed for
place and the small emoluments pertaining
thereto, manifested by men holding official
position, that pro i aces dry rot in parties
and leads to inevitable defeat.
We take take it that Mr. Mitchell was
nominated for the position of Presidential
Elector for two reasons. One was that
he desired the place, and the other that
he was able to render efficient service in
the campaign. It was not deemed likely,
however, that after being thus honored,
Mr. Mitclfell would demand or accept the
insignificant subordinate position of Mes
senger." It was not presumed that any

tige of Ins position by influencing his col
leagues to give him another place.
This sort ol' close corporation business,
of which there has been a great abundance
in Mississippi, leads to revolt in the Demo
cratic organization, to the disruption of
party ties and the obstruction of party dis
cipline. To look at the newspapers, and

number of ballots because they were not
such as were prescribed by the law of this
State, having been denounced by the Re
publican organs, condemned by some of

disapproved by some Democratic papers,

partisan Republican District Attorney of
the Tinted States for this District of this
State to prosecute by an illegal informu

law, and the Chairmen of the Democratic

mittees for advising them as to that law, a
sense of justice to these gentlemen, as Well
as a desire that our party and people may
nol be unjustly affected In the public esti
mation, nor the right of Gen. Chalmers to
his seat in Congress prejudiced by this
false- clamor, impels me to call attention to
the true state of the case.
The lie vised Code (1880) of this State pro
vides by section 137 as follows :
g 137. AH ballots shall he written, or printed, in
hlack i uk, with a space of not less than onepfifth of
an inch between each name, on plain white news
(trinting ajer, not more than two and one-half nor
ass than two and one-fourth inches wide, without
any device or mark by which one ticket may be
known or distinguished from another, except tue
words at the head of the tickets, but lids shall not
prohibit the erasure, correction or insertion of any
name by encil-iuark or ink upon the face of the
ballot and a ticket different from that herein pre
scribed sha'l not le received or counted.
That was and is the law of this State, and
the right of the State to regulate the exer
cise by its citizens of the elective franchise
In this manneiis not questioned by writers
on this subject, irrespective of their polit
ical opinions, or theories of the scope or the
construction of the Federal aud State Con
stitutions. No one ever denied the power
of the State to prescribe the qualifications
of voters and to reirulate the manner of
exercising the so-called "right of suffrage"
in tile election of its own State, county and
municipal officers the only limitation upon
that power being the ftfleeuth amendment
to the Constitution of the United States,
which prohibits the denial or abridgment
of the right of any "citizens of the United
States" (whatever that may mean) to
vote "on account of race, color, or previous
condition of servitude." And this power
extends to Congressional elections, for by
the second section of the first Article of
the Constitution of the United States it is
5escibed that iu an election of Represen
tatives in Congress "the electors in each
State shall have the qualifications-requisite
for electors of the most numerous branch
of the State Legislature; and by the fourth
section of the same Article, it is provided
that the manner of electing members of
Congress shall be prescribed in each State
by the Legislature thereof," thus apply
ing the State laws to the election of
members of Congress.
This election law is no invention of
"Southern ingenuity." Iu adopting it our
Mississippi solons simply borrowed from
our Yaukee self-constituted schoolmasters.
A law to this effect was first made. I believe
by Massachusetts in 1849, afterwards adopt
ed by a number of Northern States, and
among others by the great President man
ufacturing State of Ohio, as the following
from the Ohio Code of" 1880, passed, I be
lieve, by the very men who elected General
Garfield to the United States Senate, will

killed aud Dearman scalded to death.
The boiler was an old one and coijsidr
ered dangerous for some time.
It is apparent that our statute is taken
from the Ohio statute above quoted. Our
statute is merely an improvement upon the
above in verbiage and grammatical con
struction, and more liberal as to the width
of the ticket and more just iu the penaltv
igainst illegal tickets, to-wit: loss of the
vote, mstead of the punishment of the
printer and voter.
The policy of such laws is questionable ;
ind it is the legitimate function of the
press to discuss that question and by its
mighty Influence upon public, opinion decide
whether this law shall remain or be re
pealed.
But it should be borne in mind that such
a law is declared by some of the ablest jur
ists and purest publicists (the distinguished
Judge Cooley among the number), to be iu
furtherance of the end for the attainment
of which the ballot was resorted to the
tecrei expression of each voter.
Such a law was first enacted iu Massachu
setts to prevent the owners of mills, fac
tories and workshops, aud other employers
from owning the votes of their poor work
men, operatives or laborers.
That this is a worthy motive and in ac
cord with the spirit of our popular institu
tions cannot be denied. A similar neces
sity exists among us for protection against
like influences, for ou the one hand the
negroes may, by the use of marked tickets,
be voted en-masse by their Loyal League
political masters, or ou the other, any
voter may be spotted and compelled to
vote in the way bia employer or landlord
dictates, or else suffer the consequences of
disobliging them.
Another benefit which may be derived
from such a law, is the removal of the facil.
ity for fraud. It may sometimes be easy
to take out of the ballot box a handful of
tickets at a grab, if they are marked so as
to be known or distinguished, whereas if
they are not so marked it would be neces
sary to the perpetration of this fraud that
each ballot be separately opened and read,
a thing requiring time and likely to be de
tected.
It is certain, however, that the officers of
election had nothing to do with, uor were
they responsible for the policy of the law.
They were sworn to execute it as it was,
and not as they might think it ought to be,
and it was their duty under the law
not to receive, or If received, not to count
any ballot different from this one prescribed
in section one hundred and thirty-seven.
They did not count many because they
deeided that those ballots were different
some because they were not the proper
width, and more because they bad marks
or devices upon them by which they could
be known or distinguished. In this decis
ion honestly made, (and every oue familiar
with the facts admits that it was,) they
could not (even if they erred) be justly con
demned, a fortiori, they should not have
been abused, (especially by men who did
not know all the facts,) their action de
nounced as fraudulent and themselves as
sociated with the rascally Louisiana Re
turning Board.
The charge of fraud would be ridiculous
were it not that it may impose upon the
ignorant or thoughtless. No fair analogy
can be. drawn between the Louisiana Re
turning Board and these commissioners.
The former upon false and forged affidavits
repudiated the return by which they should
have been governed and under the pre
tense (now urged against the action of the
commissioners here) of "ascertaining the
wi.H of the people" resorted to evidence
ovftitlr the hijiil haltote aud reversed the re
sult, the Latter canvassed the returns (as by
law they must) and were governed by the
facts apparent from an inspection of those
returns. The oue did as the law directs
and ascertained the number of legal ballots,
the other in disregard of the law undertook
to go behind the legal votes and ascertain
the will of the people, not as expressed in
the lawful manner, but as they might con
sider it proper. Ify this very argument of
"ascertaining the will of the people" was
the lawfully expressed will of the people
nullified and the fraud made possible.
The facts as to the marked tickets are
briefly these :
1. The' did hare a murk or devine upon
thm by which they could be recognised
not only by the face (which violates the
law) but by the hack when folded.
This was so apparent from inspection
that it could not be denied.
2. Tiny wert actually htom um -
tfwMC Ihnthy at the election. They
were thereby selected by men who could
not read, tallies were thereby kept dur
ing election day by the Republican officers
and managers.

edMr. Lynch, as I am informed, stated
to the Secretary of State that h corrected
the proof. They differ not only from the
Democratic but from the regular Republican
tickets. They cost, as I am told, four times
as much as the regular ticket. The negroes
were told to rote that ticket, and to recog
nize it by these marks. The managers
were told by a Republican before the elec

I was informed of the difference on election
day I went to the liairman of the Repub
lican Executive Committee :md warned
him that they w ere illegal, and went to the
polls and called the attention of the inspec
tors to the law.
It is evident that they had a purpose iu
voting those tickets. What it was is imma
terial. Perhaps they resorted to this de
vice to enable them to vote the nej;ro, or
perhaps they imagined that the Democrats
might attempt to stuff the ballot boxes, and
feariug to rely on the Republican inspec
tors and clerks, selected by themselves, to
prevent it, they resorted to this trick to
enable them to detect it by proving that so
many ballots of this particular kind went
into the box.
As 1 have already said oue of the
very objects sought to be attained by this
law was to prevent election bosses from
knowing how the free people vote.
If it was so plain that those ballots were
legal as the howl of certain newspapers
would indicate, why did not the United
States District Attorney when lie in de
feusc of the tiflhteenth amendment to
the Constitution of the United States
constituted himself a one-horse Grand
Jury, and on an illegal information
had his fellow citizens arrested and
tried for this affair charge the commis
sioners with refusing to count legal votes?
He charged them with omitting to return
to the Secretary of state within ten days
after the election the whole number of
votes given in the county, and for this,
(which was not true,) he asked to have
them punished by the Federal Court (under
an act of Congress which is believed to be
a gross usurpation of authority) for their
alleged omission to do their duty as State
officers. He admitted that these ballots
had marks or devices by w hich they could
be distinguished, aud he based his argu
ment wholly on these two grouuds :
hirst, that the statute did not say iu
section 140 (which provided for the
return) the whole number of legal
votes, (which Is a mere quibble for
while it is true that the statute does not
use those words In that particular section
yet that statute had prescribed what
votes should be legal and taken into
account at all).
Second, that the Inepectori and mot th,
Uommieeioners were charged with the duty
of enforcing Section 187. Iu other words
not that the action was wrong but done by
the wrong officers.
I will not consume time aud space to an
swer his second proposition but simply say
tn pastant, that no one has yet been able to
answer the admirable argument of At
torney General Catchings or the brilliant
reasoning of Judge Wiley 1". Harris, (two
of the greatest lawyers to be found iu this
or auy other State,) demonstrating that it
w as the right aud duty of the Commission
ers not to count illegal ballots. Judge Hill
did uot attempt to discuss it. He simply
In ex cat Led i a style '"laid down the law"
as in hi opinion it should be construed,
decided that the Commissioners had com
milted no offence and then irave us his
view of the power of the Commissioners
which tea outside the cute. In fact it looks
like the main oject of these prosecutions
was to give the Federal Court a chance to
express its opinion ou the State law. Judge
Lea twice so stated to the Court. Was it
intended to injuriously affect the contest
lor the scat in Congress.' lo nve it a
black eye," so to speak ?
1 dislike the idea that so liouorable a
Court could be prostituted to such base
purposes. Iu these proseciitious they
evaded the real issue. The question the
public is most interested in, is not the
merely technical one which of these officers
should have rejected those votes, but should
they have been rejected at all.
To illustrate how unfairly this matter
has been placed before the public, I have
only to mention that those papers which
denounce the Commissioners for uot count
ing those votes do not inform the public
that many hundreds of these very tickets
were rejected by the Inspectors who ac
cording to the Federal Court had the law
ful right to decide whether they were law
ful votes. But they say "those were such
little marks such small devices, (which
translated means, "such cunning little
tricks") "used iu place of a, comma," as the
Vicksburg Herald disingenuously puts it.
It being admitted that there was a mark
or device, the test is, could the ballots be
known or distinguished thereby.
It is the province of the State and not of
the Federal Courts to contsrue this elec
tion law of the State ; and when the State
Courts do construe it, tneir decision will
be the law for the Federal Court and
Congress.
i . t 1 1 .
it is iiaiuiuiioi any one uu Has not un
voted much thought to the subject to as
sume that any law is wrong which in the
particular instance presented appears to
deprive any oue of his rights, but it should
be remembered not only that such an ob
jection to a law, trom a hardship which
mav sometimes chance to arise in its appli
cation could be urged against all laws that
man with his faliable intelligence and lim
ited foresight has been able to frame, but
also, that in the language of a great writer
on this subject, "participation in the
elective franchise is a privilege rather than
a right," and that this privilege must be
exercised in such manner and under such
regulations as the State may prescribe:
"The propriety, and indeed the necessity of
such regulations, is undisputed." And
again he says : "The intention ol the voter
must be that which is expressed in due
form of law."
It is more natural, but not creditable,
that some of our Southern newspapers
should seek to avert the wrath of our Rad
ical masters by disclaiming any responsi
bility for this muddle in the Sixth District
forgetting that they are furnishing our
stalwart frte nds new grist for their slander

Yours, respectfully,
M. Mahshai.i..
Washington. Dee. 5. The
dent in his message says :
I congratulate you on the continu
ance and increasing prosperity of our
country. By the fa vor of Divine Pro
vidence we nave been blessed during
the present year wilh health, with
abundant harvests, with profitable,
employment for all our people, and
with contentment at home and with
peace and friendship with other na
tions. The occurrence of the twenty
fourth election of Chief Magistrate has
afforded another opportunity to the
people of the United States to exhibit
to the world a significant example of
the peaceful and safe transmission of
the power and authority of the gov
ernment from the public servants
whose terms of office are about lo ex
pire to their newly chosen successors.
This example cannot fail to impress
profoundly thoughtful people of other
countries with the advantages which
Republican institutions afford. The
immediate general and cheerful acqui
escence of all good citizens in the result
of the election, gives gratifying assur
ance to our country aud to its friends
throughout the world, that a govern
ment based on the free consent of an
intelligent and patriotic people, pos
sesses elements of strength, stability
and permanency not found in any
other form of government.
Continued opposition to the full ami
free enjoyment of the rights of citizen
ship conferred upon colored men by
the amendments to the constitution,
still, prevails in several of the late
slave-holding .States. It has, perhaps,
not been manifested iu the recent elec
tion to auy large extent in acts of vio
lence or intimidation ; it has, however,
by fraudulent practices in connection
with ttie ballots, with regulations as to
places and manner of voting, and with
counting, returning aud canvassing
votes cast, been successful in defeating
the exercise of the right and the pre
servation of all rights, the right of suf
frage which t'ie constitution expressly
confers upon our enfranchised citizens.
It is the desire of good people of the
whole country that sectionalism as a
factor iu our polities should disappear.
They prefer that no section of the
country should be united in solid op
position to auy other section. The
disposition to refuse prompt and hearty
obedience to equal rights aud the
amendments to the constitution, is all
that now stands in the way of com
plete obliteration of sectional lines in
our political contests. As long as
either of these amendments is fla
grantly and fraudulently violated or
disregarded, it is safe to say that the
people who placed them in the Consti
tution as embodying the legitimate re
sults of the war for the Union, and
who believe them to be wise and nec
essary, will continue to act together to
insist that they shall be obeyed.
The paramount question still is as to
the enjoyment of the right by every
American citizen who has the requis
site qualifications, U fieely cast
his vote and have it honestly counted.
With this question rightly settled the
country will be relieved of the con
tentions of the past ; by-gones will in
deed be by-gones, and political aud
party issue? with respect to economy
and efficiency of the administration,
internal improvements, tariff, do
mestic taxation, education, finance,
and other important subjects, will
then receive their full share of atten
tion. But resistance to the nullifica
tion of the result of the war will unite
together it resolute purpose for their
support all who maintain the author
ity of the government and the preser
vation of tlie union, and who adequate
ly appreciate the value of the victory
achieved. This determination proceeds from no
hostile sentiment or feeling to any
part of the people of our own country
or to any of their interests. The invi
olability of the Amendments rests
upon the fundamental principles of
our government. They are solely the
expression of the will ol the people of
Uie uuireu states. Tlie sentiment
that the Constitutional rights of all
our citizens must be maintained does
not grow -veaker, and it will continue
to control the government of the coun
try. Happily the history of the late
election shows that in many parts of
the country where opposition to the
Fifteen Amendment has heretofore
prevailed, it is diminishing and is
likely to cease altogether if firm aud
well-3onsidered action is taken by
Congress.
I trust the house ol representatives
and senate which have the right to
judge of election returns aud qualifica
tions of their own members will see to
it that every case of violation of the
letter or snirit of the Fifteenth Amend
ment is thoroughly investigated, and
that no benefit from such violation
shall accrue to any person or party. It
will ue tlie duty of tlie .Executive, with
sumeieui appropriations for the pur
pose, to prosecute unsparingly all who
nave ueen engaged in depriving citi
zens of the rights guaranteed to them
oy tue constitution. It is not. how
ever to be forgotten that the best and
surest guarantee of the primary rights
oi ciii.cusuip is to ue found in tfiat
capacity of self-protectiou which can
belong only to a people whose ritrht
to universal surrrage is supported by
universal education.
The means at the command of the
local and State autnorities are in
many cases wholly inadequate to fur
nisli free instructions to all who ieed
it. This is. especially true where.
before emancipation, the education of
tlie people was neglected or orevent-
eti in ine interest or slavery, rirm'y
Holding tlie conviction that the sub
ject ol popular education deserves the
earnest attention of the people of the
whole country with a view to wise
aud comprehensive action of the Gov
ernment of the United Slates, I res
pectfully recommetid that Congress,
by suitable legislation, and with
proper safeguards, "supplement local
educational efforts and funds in the
several States where the grave duties
and responsibilities of citizenship
have been devolved on the uneducat
ed people, by devoting to that pur
pose grants of pub ic lands, and if
neeessary, by appropriations from the
treasury of the United States. What
ever the government can fairly do to
promote free popular education ought
to be done. Wherever general educa
tion is found, peace virtue and social
order prevails, and civil and religious
liberty are secured.
In my former annual messages I
have asked the attention of Congress
to the urgent neccessity of reformation
of the civil service system of the gov
ernment. My views concerning the
danger of patrcurge or appointments
for personal considerations, have been
strengthened by my observation and
experience in the execxtive office, and
I believe these dangers threaten the
stability of the government. Abuses
so serious in their nature cannot be
permanently tolerated. They 'tend to
become more alarming with the en
largement of the administrative ser
vice. As the growth of the country
in population increases the number of
officers and placemen employed, the
reasons are Imperative for the adop
tion of fixed rules for the regulation of
appointments, promotions and re
movals; establishing a uniform method
bavins? exclusively in view in every
instance the attainment of the best
qualifications for the positions in question.
Such a method alone is consistent
with the equal rights of all citizens,
and the most economical and efficient
administration of public business. He
then refers to the system, aud recom
mends the appropriation of $25,000 per
annum to meet the expenses of a com
mission to be appointed by the Presi
dent in accordance with the terms of
section 1753, Revised statute, whose
duty it shall be to devise a lust, uni
form and efficient system of competi
tive examination, and to supervise the
application of the same throughout
the entire civil service of the govern
ment.
