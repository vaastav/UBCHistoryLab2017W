Official Paper of County and City.

Long, Fred W. Hermann.
Editors and Proprietors.
The legislative program for the
short session includes the passage of
the conservation bills, the bills for
the ultimate independence of the
Philippines, a government owned
merchant marine, and measures for
economy in all branches .of the gov
ernment.
A clear, conservative and reason
able program is outlined and one
that should and will meet with uni
versal approval.
Representative Gardner's resolu
tion for an investigation of the pre
paredness of the United States for a
defensive war has met with little fa
vor. It was clearly conceived to cre
ate a political issue and designed to
force the Democratic cqngress to in
crease its appropriations for the armj
and navy. The increased expendi
tures would be followed «by an attack
upon the Democratic congress, for its
extravagance.
If the. United States army, the
United States navy and the United
States coast defenses are all inade
quate, the blame certainly does not
-rest upon President Wilson or the
Democratic party.
It rests upon the Republican party,
which.under McKinley, Roosevelt and
Taft was In continuous control of the
government for sixteen years up to
March 4,. 1913.
In 1905, the last year of the Roos
evelt administration, the appropria
tions for the army were $78,634,582.
75 the appropriations for the na
vy were $98,958,507.50. In 1914 the
appropriations for the army were
$94,266,145.51 the appropriations for
the navy were $140,718,434.53.
We are spending over $40,000,000 a
year more on the navy than we spent
when Roosevelt was president, and
$18,000,0000 a year more on the
army.
Our generous gifts to the suffer
?tng Belgians should be commended
and encouraged. We should not how
ever, exhaust the full masure of our
charity abroad. In every community
there are needy ones that are deserv
ing of the assistance of their home
people. There are some who suffer
unassisted in the midst of plenty.
CANADA AND MONROE.
An Australian paper declares that
if William Howard Taft is correct,
and that the United States1 would
not be bound to protect Canada from
German attack, there is nothing to
the Monroe doctrine. The Australian
la not logical. If it ,bases its opin
ion on Mr. Taft's utterances it should
bear in mind that he distinctively de
clared that there is a Monroe doctrini
and that no nation would be allowed
to change the form of any American
government. It is also well to re
member, although the Melbourne edit
or passes lightly over this feature as
of no consequence, that for four years
William Howard Taft was president
of the United States of America, and
charged with the duty of interpreting
and applying that doctrine. He is
quite generally considered in Ameri
ca to be a foremost authority on in
ternational laws and there is a preva
lent belief that, if a vacancy should
for any reason occur on the supreme
bench, Mr. Taft would be elevated by
President Wilson as a tribute to his
^earning and poise.
The United States would be acting
the part of an incompetent nation if
it took th-» position that Canada may
make war on Germany and Austria or
any other nations and would still be
entitled to protection against those
She was fighting. Canada is not a
treaty power and is not American. Po
litically she is a part of the British
empire and i$ ruled from London, jus
as the Bahamas, Jamaftsa, Newfound
land, and lesser islands are rul
ed. Canada has the guarantee that
the United States will not attack and
that no nation will be allowed to at
tack through American territory. As
attack from the north is at all times
impossible and as Alaska Interposes
barrier on the northwest and west,
Canada's problem of defense is reduc
ed to a rather simple matter.
The Monroe doctrine belongs to
the United States, will be interpret
ed by the United States.—The Ga
zette.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Since President Wilson has been
In office his messages to Congress
have always dwelt upon subjects vi
tal to the nation at the time they
were delivered. He urged t&rftf re
form when wo needed it currency
legislation when it was- necessary and
his message to Congregs yesterday
gives to the country the element it
now needs most,—reassurance. He
allays' the fears of those who were
alarmed by the jingoes, lest we were
in astate of naval and military un
pi'eparedness, and in no position to
defend ourselves if attacked. He
gives notice to the business world
that the legislative program of the
administration, as it affects the reg
ulation. o£ business, is practically
completed and has resulted in "a
clear road to unclouded success/'
The Wilson Democrats maintain
that President Wilson, as a near Pro
gressive, is the natural heir to the
Roosevellt following.
These leaders, as political leaders
generally do, are ^xprssing hopes
rather than beliefs.
The only way of prophesying how
the future may develop is by reason
able deduction from the past.
The Progressive movement can. be
said to have started shortly after the
election of President McKinley in
1896. While the president's mind dur
ing his first term was principally tak
en up with the Spanish war and ""ts
aftermath, he was becoming aware of
the growing inequalities of opportuni
ty and waa starting a campaign of re
form at the time of tfis assassination.
President Roosevelt, succeeding
him in office, devoted his energy to
this movement with such success that
he was overwhelmingly elected in
1904. He carried out the popular will
so satisfactorily during the years of
his elective term that at their close
he was able to name his successor,
politicians and voters alike merely
accepting his recommendation.
President Taft was no sooner elect
ed than he turne*1 from the policies
he had professed before election and
delivered himself and the poWer of
his administration to those very ele
ments President Roosevelt had so
successfully overcome. So rapidly did
he work that the party which had
been overwhelming in its march to
ward progress was overwhelmed at
the congressional election two years
later.
Shortly after the Republicans be
gan to gather into three camps. One
camp, representing reaction and con
taining federal office holders, was in
sistent for the renomination of the
president. Another camp, intent up
on his rejection from office at all
costs, rallied around Senator La Fol
lette. A third camp, believing strong
ly in the Republican party and be
lieving it alone capable of suc
cessfully conducting the gov
ernment, cast around for a
candidate who could be nominated in
the face of the federal machine and
ivho could be elected at the polls.
This camp finally settled upon ex
president Roosevelt as the only
available man to save the party.
There followed the primary cam
paign. The Roosevelt Republicans,
with recruits from both the Taft and
La Follette followers, won the nomi
nation at the popular primaries, on
ly to be cheated out of their victory
the national convention.
There followed the unexpected
nomination of Woodrow Wilson at
the Democratic convention and the
organization of the Progressive par
ty.
In the campaign the Progressives
attacked Republicans and Democrats
indiscriminately. The election showed
the normal Democratic vote for Wil
son and the former Republican vote
divided between Roosevelt and Taft,
with he larger part for Roosevelt.
Elated by the Roosevelt showing,
the Progressvie party leaders continu
ed organizing and continued denounc
ing the two old parties in equal meas
ure.
In the election just passed the
issue of the stolen convention did
not exist. The charges against the
Republican candidates were generally
gross "exaggerations built on partisan
hostility.
Republican voters returned to their
party to vote for qualified candidates.
In some instances they returned to
vote even for unqualified candidates.
The main issue in the campaign
was two years of Democratic rule in
Washington, and in certain instances
notably in Pennsylvania, the voters
went to great extremes to vote it
out
There remains a considerable army
of voters who voted the Progressive
ticket last month. What will they
do?
The claim is made that they are
near to President Wilson and shoulld
become Democrats, but, if so, are
they followers of Col. Roosevelt and
do they share his views of the Wil
son administration?
It is also suggested that they can
not under any circumstances consort
with certain Republicans of influence.
Does it follow then, for instance,
that they are willing to tie them
selves up with William Jennings Bry-

Nor will they unreasonably follow
mere plausible appeals for their sup
port.
In 1916 they will be guided by con
ditions „of 1916 as in 1912 they were
guided by the conditions of 1912, and
in 1908 were guided by the conditions
of that year.
If we have another convention like
the one of 1912 we will have another
election like the one of 1912.
Much will depend on the conduct of
Republican leaders between, now and
the next election. Much will depend
upon the Republican nominations
If the Republican leaders in con
gress and througout the states show
a superiority of integrtiy and intel
ligence over the Democrats, and if a
candidate representative of the best
spirit of the nation is nominated for
president, he may expect the votes of
the bulk of the Progressives.
But if the malign influence of 1912
reasserts itself in 1916, not only the
Progressive voters. of 1914 and 1912
will stay away but the bulk of.-the
Republican voters will follow them.

What could be a more appreciated gift than a- pair of proper

could enjoy if they had a pair of glasses that properly fit the
eyes. People come to me often that have been working through
difficulties because they would not pay the price for a»pair of
glasse^j| that fit. We find that the eyes are not frequently alike
in vision and consequently the eye most nearly perfect, does a
larger part of the work while with a properly fitted pair of glass
es would give both eyes an chance to the betterment of
vision, accuracy, and unnecessary loss of nervous effort.
This is the time of the year that the eyes are used the
most consequently with a properly fitted pair of glasses you can
save them this extra effort. I use no drugs in- fitting glasses.
