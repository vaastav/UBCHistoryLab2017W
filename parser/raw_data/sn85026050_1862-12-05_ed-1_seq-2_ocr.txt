If the condition of our relatione with other

mraclory than a nation o unhappily amtiactm

Hut the temporary reverses which afterwards
brlul the national arm, and which wero eae-
'gerated by our own disloyal citiaen abroad,
fair hitherto dnlayed that act or simple juatico.
The eiril War, which, ha so radically changed
for the momuut the occupation ana habila of
the American people, ho necessarily diatui bed
the social condition anil affected very deeply
the prosperity of the nations with which we have
Carried on a commerce that has been steadily iu-
ervMia throughout, iwrhl of half a century
It has, at the same time, excited political ain-
bitiotis and apprehensions which have produced
a pmrouiitl agitation throughout the etvilited
world. In this unusual agitation we have for
borne taking part in any controversy between
parlies and factions in any such States. We
Laro attempted no propagandism, and acknowl
edged no revolution, hut we have left to every
nation the exclusive conduct and management
of it own Bffnirs. Our struggle hnbcch of course
contemplated by foreign nations with reference,
let to tt own merits, than to it supposed and
often exaggerated effects, and the consequence
resulting to those nation taemselre.
Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this
Government, even if it were just, would certain
ly bo unwise, ,.
FOREIGN RELATIONS. SLAVE TRADE TREATY.
The treaty with Great Britain for the suppress
ion of the slave trade has been put into opei at ion
with a good prospect of complete success. It ia
an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge
that the execution of it on the port of Her Maj
esty' government hn been marked with a jeal
ous respect for the authority of the United
State and the rights of their moral and loyal eit
ineiis. - '
TJie eon vent ion with Hanover for the abolition
of the State dues has been carried into full effect,
under the act of Congress for that purpose.

A blockade of 3,000 miles of sea-coast could

in a country where toreiffneers resido and carry
on a trade under treaty stipulations is necessar
ily fruitful of cnmplaiatsof the Violations of neu
tral righta. All such collisions tend to excite
mifaiHirehertsiona and. possibly, to tiroduee nu-
tional reclamations between nations which have
a common interest in preserving peace and
friendship. -
In clear eases of these kind'), I have, so far n
possible, heard and redressed complaints which
have been referred by friendly powers. There
is, however, a laige and aiigumenling number of
doubtful cafes upoa which the government is
lliuilile tu agree witn the governments whose
protection is demanded by the clainiant9.

are, moreover, many cases io which the Unitud

coniphiiuU. This propusitiou has been mad
especially lo Great Britain, to France, to Spain
and to Prussia. In each case it has been kind

giao barque Admiral F. Torciens rtiola, which
vessel waa in nay, iflbl, prerenlerl hv the Com
mander of the bloekadinr fore off Charleston,
from leaving that port with cargo, notwithstand

granted to an knglish vessel. - .
I have directed ihe Secretary of the State to
cause the papers in the case to be communicated
to the proper committees. - ;...
COLONIZATION.
AppHcationa have been made to me by many
free Americans of Afiican descent to favor their
emigration with a view to such colonization as
waa contemplated in recent acts of Congress.
Other parties, at home and abroad, some from
interested motives, others upon patriotic prin
ciples, and still others influenced by philan
thropic sentiments, have suggested sim
ilar measures, while on the oilier hand sev
eral of the Spanish American Republics have
protested against the sending of eurh colonies
to their respective territories.
Under these circumstances, I have declined
to move any sneb colony to sny State without
first obtaining the consent of its Government,
with an agrementon its pan to receive and
protect such emigrants in all their rights as free
men, and I have at the same time offered to the
several States, situated in the tropics or having
eotomes there, ta negotiate with them on the
subject, with the advice and consent of the Sen
ate, to favur the voluntary emigration of persons
ol mat close to their respective territories upon
conditions which shall be equal, just and hu
man. .
, Liberia and Hayti are, as yet, the only eoun
triee lo which colonics of African descent from
here could go with certainty of boinir received
and adopted aa eitixens; and I regret to ssy that
auch persons contemplating colonization do nut
seem a willing lo emigrate to these countries
aa t aoine oilier, nor aa willing as I think their
wtefea demands.- I belmv, however, that the
pinion ia improving, and that are hms; tliere
will be an augmented and considerable emigra

THE FINANCES.
The condition of the finance will claim your
most dilligent consideration. The vast expen
ditures, incident tn the military and nvl oper
ation required for th suppression ef tire re
bellion, nave niinmto Len iirei witn nmiunti-
I tude and cci Utility unusual iu liinilai' circuin-
iisnriw, sun in puonr. rn-on iihs uitii luny
maintained. Theeontinuaiiceof Ihe war, how
ver,aiid th inereaeddisbursementmad nec
essary, demand ynur best reneottoti a to the
bust modes of providing the necessary revenue,
without injury tu business, and with the least
possible burdens upon labor. The uaiensinn
of specie payment by the bank made large is
sues of U. States note unavoidable. In no oth
er way could the payment of the troop and the
satisfaction of other just demand be soeennotn
teal ly or a well provided for. Tho judicious
legislation of Congress, securing tho reeoiva
biiity of these note for loan and intfrnal du
ties, and making them a legal tender for at her
debts, has made them a universal enrrency, and
has satisfied partially, t l.At, and for the t ime
th long felt want of a uniform circulating
medium, saving thereby to the people iinmeni-e
sums in discount and exchange. '
A return to specie paytmMila, however, at the
earliest period compatible with a duo regard to
all interests should ever be kept in view. Fluc
tuations in tho value of currency are always in
jurious, and to reduce these fluctuation to the
lowest possible point, will always besteading
purpose in wise legislation. Prompt and cer
tain convertibility into coin ia generally ac
knowledged to be the best protection against
them, ninl it i extremely doubtful whether a
circulation of United States notes, payable In
coin and sufficiently large for the wants of the
people, can be rorinaiiently usefully ami safely
maintained, Ia there any other mode In which
the necessary provision for the publie wautsean
be made, and the great advantages' of a safe and
onifoiTu currency secured? I know of none
which promises so certsin results, and at the
same time so unobjectionable, ti the organisa
tion of banking associations under a general act
of Congress, well guarded in its provisions.
To such associations th Government might
furnish circulating nnteson the security of Uni
ted Stall's bonds, deposited In the treasury.
Those notes, prepared nndiT the supervision of
proper officers, being uniform in appearance and
security, end convertible always in coin, would
at once protect labor against the evils of a vi
cious currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap
and safe exchange. A moderate reservation
from the interest on the bond would compensate
the United State for the preparation and dis
tribution of the note and a tenenil urervision
of the system, and would lighten the burden of
that portion of the public debt employed as se
curity. " '
The public credit, moreover, would be greatly
improved, and the negotiation of new loans
greatly facilitated by the steady market demand
for Government bonds which the adoption of
uie propositi system wouio create, n is an ad
ditional recommendation of the measure of con-
aiderable weight in my judgment, that it would
reconcile, as fares possible, all existing Interests
by the opportunity offered to existing- institu
tion to reorganize, under the. aet, substituting
only the uniform national circulation for the lo
cal and various circulations, secured and unse
cured, bow issued by them.
CONDITION OF THE TREASURY.
The receipts into the Treasury from all sour

POST OFFICE.
give me pleasure to report a decided
improvement in the financial condition of
tho Post Office Department, as compared
with the aovernl preceedimy years.
The receipt for tho fiscal year 1861,
amounted to 8,349,296 40, which em
braced th revenue from all Stales of the
Union for three quarters of that year. Not
withstanding the cessation of revenue from
the so called Confudorale Slates during the
last fiscal year, the increase of the corres
pondence of Ilia loyal Statu has been suffi
cient to produce a revenue, the same year of
f 3,220,820 0, being only $50,000 leas
lhau was derived from all th Slates of the
Union the previous year. '
The expenditures show a still more fa-
vnroldo resiil'.. The amount expended in
1861 was $14,000,780 11. For tho last
year tho amount has been reduced to $11,-
125,30 13, showing a diff'rcneo of about
$2,487,000 ir, the expenditures as comDarcd
wim me proceeding year, aad about $3,
750,000 a compared with the fiscal year
oi ioou. lDeaenciency in the department
for the previous year was $1.551, 803 08..
for tb last Sseal year it waa reduced ta $2,-

THE INTERIOR.
et'.ioWtfint in regard to publie lands: Tha
. Tb Secretary 4 th Interior renorts a
publie lands hav cessod lo be a source of
rornntie. From tho ll ol July, 1801, lo
th 80th of September, 1802, the entire
cmb fct-pjpi, from (he sale of puhlia Isrnlj
were $187,477,20, a sum much loss than
the xponse of our land system during ths
same period. ,
Tho homestead law which will UltS effect
on tb 1st of January next, ofTeis such in''
ducemcnts Id seltlem that sales for cash can
not be expected to an extent audinient to
moot tho expenses of the general land ofllce,
and cot of surveying and bringing the land
into tiiatltpt.
Tao flisotepancy between tb:' sums here
slated as arising from tho sales tf pablic
lands and lb sum derived front tha same
source, as reported from the Treasury de
partment, arises, as I uimerMnm!, from the
fact that the periods rf limn, thought ap
parently, were not really coincident at the
beginning point. The Treasury report in
eludes a considerablu sum now winch had
pseviously been reported from tho Interior,
sufficiently lariro to greatly overreach tho
sum derived from the three months now

THE INDIAN WAR.
Tlio : Indian Tribes unon our frontiers
have, during ihe past yenr, mnnifeslod a
spirit of insubordination, and at several
poinUongntfod in open hostilities against the
whilo settlers in their vicinity. The tribes
occupying lbs Indian country south of Kan
sns renounced their allegiance with tho U.
Sintes and entered into a treaty with thoio
surgonls. Those who remaiued .'loyal to
lb United States wero driven from the
country. The Cliiof of the Cherokoes has
visited tbii cify for the purpose of restoring
the former relations of too tribe with tlio L .
Slates, He alleges that they were con
strained by superior force to enter into Irea
ties with the insurgents, and that tho Uni
ted Stales negloclod to furnish tho protect
ion winch their treaty stipulation required
In the month of Augutt last, Ihe Sioux In
dinns, in Minnesota, attacked the settlers in
their vicinity, with extreme ferocity, killing
indiscriminately men, women and children
Tho attack was wholly unexpected, and,
Ihoreforo, no defense- bad been provided.
It is estimated that not less loan 300 per
sons were killed by the Indians, and a largo
amount of properly was dostroyed. How
this outbreak was induced U not definitely
known, and suspicions, which may bo tin
just, need not bo stated, information was
received ny Ihe Indian bureau from differ
ent sources about the time hostilities were
comrueuced, that a simultaneous altack was
to be made upon tho while settlements by
all the tribes between the Mississippi river
and the Rocky Mountains. . " ,'
The Stale of Minnesota has suffered great
injury from the Indian war. A largo por
tion of Jier territory has been depopulated,
nnd a severe loss has been sustained by the
destruction of property. : Tho people of that
State manifest much anxioly for the remov
al of the tribes beyond the limits of tho
State, as a guarantee against future hostili
ties. Tho Commissioner of Indian afliiirs
will furnish full details.
INTER-COMMUNICATION.
I submit for your especial consideration
whether our Indian system shall not bo re
modeled. . Many wise and good men bave
been impressed with the belief that this
can bo profitably done.
I submit a statement of the proceedings
of the Commissioners, which shows -the
progress that has boon made in th enter
prise of constructing tho Pacific Railroad,
and this suggests the earliest completion
of tho road, and also tha favorablo action
of Congress upon the projects now pending
before them, for onlarging the capacities of
tho great canals in Now York and Illinois,
as being of vital and rapidly increasing im
pprtanco to the whole nation, and espec
ially to the vast interior regions hereinafter
to be noticed at some greater length. I
proposo lmving prepared and laid before
you, at an early day, some interesting and
valuable statistical information upon this
subject. Tho military and commercial Im
portance of enlarging the Illiuoisand Mich
igan Canal, and improving the Illinois Riv
er, is presented in the report of Col. Web
ster to tho Secretary of War, and now trans
milled to Congress, I respectfully ask
your attention to it.
AGRICULTURE.
To carry out the provisions of the act of
Congress or tho 1 5th of May last, I have
caused the Department of Agriculture of the
United slates to be organized. Tho Com
missioner ibforrns me lhatwilbiu the period
of a few months, this department has estab
lished an extensive systom of correspond
enco and exchanges, both at home and
abroad, which promises to effect highly ben
eficial results in the development of a cor
rect knowledge of reccDt improvements in
agriculture, iu the introduction of new products,
and in the collection of the agricultural statis
tics of the different States: also, that it will soon
be prepared to distribute largely, seeds, cereals,
plants and cuttinfrs, and has already published
and liberally diffused much valuable informa
tion in anticipation of a more elaborate report
wincu wiuin due iime oe jurnisncu, emoraciug
some valuable tests iu chemical science now in
progress iu the labrotory. . The creation of this
Department was for the more immediate bene
fit of a larire elaaa of our most valuable citizens.
and I trust that the liberal basis upon which it
has been organized, will not only moet your ap
probation, but that it will realise at no disUut
day all the fondest anticipations of its most san
guine friends, sod become the fruitful source of
advantage to all our people. ..
EMANCIPATION AND DISUNION.
On the 22d day sf September last, a proclama
tion was issued by th Executive, a copy of
wnicn w nereor suonmiea. in accordance with
the purpose ex pr seed ra the second paragraph
of that paper, I now respectfully recall your at
tention to what may lie called: "compensated
emancipation." A nation may be said to con
sist of it territory, its people, its law. The
territory t th only part which, is of certain
durability. "One generation pameth away and
another generation rometh, but the earth abideth
forever.'' It ia of the first importance to duly
eonsider and timaUi this never ending pan.
That portion of ths eau-th'eiirfaee which isown
ed and inhabited by the people of the United
States, is well adopted to the home of one na
tional family, and it is nut Well adapted for two
or more. lis vast extant and its variety of cli
mate aad productions, are of advanta n the
ageaf on people, whatever they might have
ben ia (inner ages, rjkam, and telegraphs, and
intelligence, have brought these to be an advaa
tageaas enbinaxioai tor oe united people. .-
In the inaugural Address I briefly pointed out
the total inadequacy ef disunion as a remedy
sir differences between the people of the two
sections. I did so inr Isngaare which I cannot
improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat.
One section of our country believes slavery is
right and onght to be extended, while the oth.
er believes it is wrong and ought not to be ex
tended. This is the only substantial d isnute.
The fiiEitiv slave claua of tha CfMiftl ililtinn
and Ui law fur tha uiiureiioa of tha African
lava trail, are each aa well enforced, uerhaia.
a any law cju ever be in a community where
m morwi sense oi im people linperlectly aup
purts the law Itself. Th great body of the
people abide by the legal oblieations in both
cast's, and a few break over each. This. I think
cannot be perfectly cured, and it would bo worse
in both instances after separation oftli section
thsn before.
The f reii;s slave trade, now iinnerfeeilv sen.
pressed, would be ultimately reviv without
restriction In one seel ion, while fugitives, now
only partially surrendered, would nut be sur
rendered at an ny the other. I hystcally speak
ing, we CHinot eflrste. We cannot remove our
repectivc section from each wthei-, hnr build
n Impassible wall between llsetn. A husband
tnd wifo mny be divorced and go out of llie
prusenca anil leytnil the reach of each other,
but the different purls ol our country cannot tin
this, .-...
They cannot but remain fne In faca, atiS In
tercourse, either amicable or hostile, mimt con
tiniiobelwecn them. Isit possililothon to make
that Intercom- ' more advantageous or
mora tlsfnolory aft err eopari)
tinn than before? Can aliens ma Ve treni tea cas
tor than fiiendsoan make lawsf Can treaties be
more faithfully enforced between alien thsn,
laws c-. (Miong triondsf Biipse ynu go: to
war, you cannot nght always, nd whsn after
much loss on both sides, and no gain, uu either,
you cense fighting, the identical old question as
tu terms of iiiterouur are again Upon you.
There is no line, straight or crookuJ, (iiitable
for a national boundary, upon which to divide.
Trace through from east to west, upon the line
between the fret and slave country, and we ahall
find a little more tlutu one-third of it length are
river easy to be crossed, nnd popeluled, thick
ly upon both sides, while in ueurly slL its re
maining length are merely surveyor's lines, over
which people tuny walk luick and forth without
any consciousness ot their presence. No part
of this line ran he made any more difficult to
pass by writing it down on paper tr parchment
as a national boundary.
The fact of separation, If it comes, give upon
the part of the seceeding section the fugitive
slave clause, along with all other constitutional
obligations upon the section seceded from, whilo
I should expect no treaty stipulation would ev
er be made In take its place.
But there is another difficulty: The great in
terior region, bounded east by Ihe Alleghanies,
north by the British dominions, west by the
Kocky mountains, nnd south by the line along
. 1, i Vi tl, .ulli.n.i.iH nf MiM n . 1 Mn . r ,
and which includes part of Virginia, part of
lennessce, all ol Kentucky, Uluo, Michigan,
Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa,
Minnesots, and the Territories of Dacotah, Ne
braska, and a rt of Colorado, have about ten
millions of people, and will hare fifty million
withiu fifty years, if not prevented by any po
litical folly or mistake. It contains more than
one-third of the country owned by the revolted
States, certainly more than one million of sur
face miles; one-half as populous a Massachu
setts already is, it would have more than seventy-five
millions of people. A glance at the
map show that, territorially speaking, it is the
great body of the Republic. The other parts
are but marginal borders to it, the magnificent
region sloping west lrom the Kocky mnuutains
tu tho Pacific, being the. deepest and also tho
richest in itndevelojied resource in the produc
tion of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which
proceeds from them. This great intwier region
is naturally one of the inwl imuortant iu the
world. Ascertain from the statistics the small
proportion of the region which hn not as yet
been brought Into cultivation, and also Ihe large
and rapidly increasing amount of it products,
and we shall be overwhelmed with the magin
tude of the prospect presented, and yet this ro
gion has no sea-coast, touches no ocean any
where. As part of one nation its people now
iiibj unir, una miiy lorirver nnu ineir w ay to
Europe by New York, to South America and
Africa by New Oi lcans, and to Asia by San
Francico.
But separate our common country into two
nations, as designed by the present rebellion,
and every man in the great Interior region is
thereby cut off from some one or more of these
outlet", not perhaps by a physical harrier, but
oy emoarrassing ana onerous undo regulations,
and this istmo wherever a dividing or bounda
ry line may be fixed. Place it between the now
free and slave country, or place it south of Ken
tucky, or north of the Ohio, nnd still the truth
remains that none south of it can trade to any
port or place north of it, and none north of it
can trade to any port or place south of it, except
upon terms dictated by a government foreign to
them. These outlets, e:i"t, wet and south, are
indispensable to the well being of the people
inhabiting, and to inhabit, this vast interior re
gion. Which of the three may be the best is
no proper question; all are betterjhan either,
and all of right belong to the people and their
successors forever.. True to themselves, they
will not ask where a line of separation shall be,
but will vow rather that there shall lie no such
line. Nor are the marginal regions less interes
ted in the communications to and through them
to the great outside world. They do, and each
oneof them must have access to their Egypt of
the west, without paying toll at the crossing of
any national boundary. Our national strife
springs not from our permanent part, not from
the Innds we inhabit, not from our national
homestead. There ia no possiblo Rwerving of j
mi out waiiiu multiply and not mitig.ite evils
among us. In all its adaptations and attitudes,
it demands union and abhors seoaration. In
fact, it Would, ere long, force reunion, however
much of blood and treasure the separation might
have cost. Our strife pertains to ourselves, to
the passing generations of men, and it cannot
without convulsion be hushed forever, with the
passing ot one generation. With this view I
recommend the following resolution and artic
les amendatory to the Constitution of the Uni
ted States.
Jlvto.'val, By the Senate and House of Repre
sentativesof the United State of America in

said Legislatures or Conventions, to be valid as
part or parts of the said Constitution, namely:

Yet that the mensnie I both ju't and economi
cal iseertain. The liberation of the slave is
the destruction of properly acquired by descent
snd by purchase, the same as any other proper
ty. It Is up less 1rn for havirg ksm nflenssid,
that the people of the South nrs no iiiim-s respon
sible for the introduction of this property than
are the people of the North, and when it I re
memlicred how unhesitatingly we all use cot
ton and ugar, and share the profit of dealing
in them, it may not be quite saio.io say iiiai uie
South ha been more responsible than the North
for ilaeintinUBttce, If then, for a common ob
ject, this proiwty Is te b sacrificed, is it not
lust that il bo done at a common charge! Ahd
H witn less ainney, or money more essiiypmii
we can iireserve the benefits ol the linnui y
this mean than we fan by th war alone, is it
not economical to do It? Iol u ascertain the
um we hove expended in the war, since com-
pensated emancipation was proposed lost March,
and eonsider whether II lieu measure-nau neen
promptly accepted by even some of tho slave
stntos, the same sum would hot have done more j
to close the war than has been otherwise done, '
If so, tho measure would save money, and in
that view would be I rrndent and economical
measure certainly. It is not so essy to psy
something a it is to pay nothing, but il i eas
ier to pay a large sum than it i to pay a larger
one, and it i easier to pay any mm when we
are ahle.tb.m it I to pay it before we are able.
The war require them at once. Th aggregate
sum necessary for compensated emancipation of
course would be large, but it would require no
ready cash nor bonus, sny faster than tho eman
cipation progresses. Thi might not, nnd pro
bably would not close before the end of th 37
years. At that lime we shall probably hav
100,000,000 people to shnre tho burden instead
of 31,01X1.000 now; aud not enly so, but th
increase of our population may be expected to
continuo for a long time after the period as ra
pidly as before, broauae our territories will not
have become full. .
POPULATION.
I do not stale this inconsiderately. At th
same ratio of increase which wo have maintain
ed on an average from our first national census
iu 1790 until that of lHfiO, we should, in 1900,
have a population of 103,20H,415, and why may
we not continue that ratio far beyond that peri
od! Our abundant room, our broad notional
homestead is an ample resource. " Ver4 our ter
ritory as limited as are the British Isles, certain
ly our population could not expand as ttatcd. In
stead of receiving the foreign born as now, we
should be compelled to send part of tha native
born away; but such ia nut our condition. We
have 3.963.000 square miles. Europe line 3,800,
COO, with a population averaging 73 1-3 pcrantis
to the square mile.
Why may not our country, nt sometime,' av
erage a many ! Is it less fertile! Has it more
waste surface by mountains, rivers, lakes, di
erts and other causes! Is it inferior to Europe
in any natural advantage! If, then, we are at
sometime to be as populous as Europe, how
soon! As tu when this may be, we may .judge
from tho past and tho present. A to whether
it will ever be, depends much on whether we
maintain the Union. - Several of onr State are
above the overage of European population of
73 f-3 to the square mile. Massachusetts has
139; Rhode Islnnnd, 133; New York and New
Jersey, each 80: also two other crest State
Pennsylvania'atid Ohio are not fr below, the
former having 63 and the latter 59. The States
already above the European average, except New
York, have increased in as rapid a ratio since
passing that point as ever before, while no one
of them I equal to some other parts of our coun
try in natural capacity for sustaining a dense
population; v t --:, i ; .- .
Taking the nation in the aggregate, we find
its population nnd raito of increase for the sever
al decimal periods to be as follows: 1790, 3,929,
827; 1800, 5,305,937. Ratio of increase, 35 02
100 per cent. 1810, 7,239,814. Ratio 36 45-100.
1820, 9,688.131. Ratio 33 13-100. 1830, 10,
886,020. Ratio 33 49-100. 1840, 17,089,453.
Ratio 32 67-100. 1850, 83,193,876. Hatm- 35
87-100. 1860,31,433.700. Ratio 35 58-100.
This shows sn average decimal increase of 34 60
100 per eont, in population through the seventy
years from our first to our last census taken.
It is seen that the ratio of increase at no one of
these, seven periods is is cither two per eeirt.
below or two per cent, above the average; thus
showing how inflexible, and consequently how
reliable, the law of increase in our ease is.
Assuming that it will continue it gives the fol
lowing results: 1870, 42,323 372; 1880, 5C,36ti,
216; 1890, 76.677,872; 1900,103.2(18,415; 1910.
138,918,526; 1920, 186,984,335; 1930, 251,680.914.
These figures show that our country may ' be
as populous as Europe, at some point between
1920 and 1930 tay about 1925, W territory,
at 73 1-3 to the square mile, being of the capac
ity to contain 217,186,000; and we will reach
this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the
chances by the folly and evils of disunion, or
by long, exhaosting war, springing from the on
ly great element of discord among us. While
it cannot be forseen exactly how much one huge
example of secession, breeding lesser ones indef
initely, would retard the population, civilisation
aud property, no one eau doubt that the extent
of it would be very great and injurious.
The proposed emancipation would shorten
this war; perpetuate peace; insure this increase
iu population, snd proportionably the increase
iu the wealth of the country. With this we
should pay all that emancipation would cost.
without onr other debts, easier than we - should
pay our other debts without it. If we had allow
ed our own national debt to run at 6 percent,
per annum, simple interest, from the end of our
revolutionary struggle till to-day without pay
ing anything on either principal or interest, each
man of u would owe less en that debt now than
each man owed upon it then, and thia because
our increase of men through tho ' whole period
has been greater than aix per cent, and has run
aster man tae interest upon me debt. I n
time aloe relieves a debtor nation, so lonr as
its population increases faster then unpaid in
terest accumulates on its debt This fact would
be no excuse for delaying th payment of what
is justly due: but it show th Brest importance
uf time in this connection, the great advantage ef
sponey oy wnien we snail not nave to pay until
until we number 100,000,000 what by a differ
ent policy we wonld have to pay now, when
the number is 31,000,000. In a word, it shews
that a dollar will be much harder to pay tor the
war, than a dollar for emancipation on the pro
posed plan: and then the latter will cost no
blood uo precious life. . It will be a saving of
ooin.

Th plan nons'sst i rig of llir. article r recovn-
mende, sot but that restoration nf th nation
al authority would be accepted without its
adoption, nor will th war or proceedings under
the proclamation of September 22d, 1P63, be
stayed because of the rccomnn-ndation of this
plan. Its timely adoption 1 doubt not would
bring restoration and thereby stay both. And
notwithstanding thi plan, the recommendation
that Congress provide by law for compensating
any State which may adopt the emancipation
bclore this plan shall have been acted upon, is
hereby earnestly Tenewed; Sneb would only
be an advance part nf the plan, and the same ar
guments apply to both. This plsn is recom
mended a S means not in conclusion of, but ad
ditional to all other for restorilljsnd preserving
th national authority throughout th Union.
The subject is presented exclusively in it econ
omical aspect. Tho plan would, I am confident, -secure
peace more speedily than can be done by
force alone, while it would cost less, consider
ing auioimt and nnhncr of payment and times
of payment, and tho amount, would be easier

if we rely solely npon' force. It is most likely, .
very likelyi would cost no blood at all.
The plan is proposed as permanent constitu
tional law.' It cannot) become sneh without the
concurrence, first, of two third of Congress, and
afterwards three-fourths of the States., , The
requisite three quarters of the Slate will neces
sarily iuclude seven of the Slave Slate. If ob
tained, it will give assurances of their severally
adopting emancipation at no distant day, upon
the new constitutional terms. This assurance
would end the struggle now and aav th Union
forever. . .
I do not forget the gravity of a paper addres
sed to the Congress nf the Nation by the- Chief
Magistrate of the Nation; nor do I forget that
some of yoilarcmy seniors, or that many of you
have more experience than I in tho rnnduct of
public affairs. Yet, I trust that iu view of thn
great responsibility resting ujMin ine,. you will
perceive no want of respect for yourselves in any
undue earnestness I may teem tu display.. Is
it doubted, then, that the plnn 1 propose, if
adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen
its expenditure of money and blood! Is it
doubled that we here, Contrr&s and Executive,
can secure its adoption! Will not the good peo
ple respond to a united and earnest appeal lrom
us! Can we can they by any other mean o
certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects!
We can -succeed only by concert. Itiinot--can
any of n imagine better! but, can any of us
do bettor! The dogmas of the qniet past are in
adequate to the stormy present. The occasion
is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise
with the eceesimr. As our ease 4s new, so we
must think anew and act anew. We must dis
enthral ourselves, and then we shall cave our
eonntry-- i-( v ! ', '' 1 , !. A,
