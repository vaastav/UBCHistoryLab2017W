Members of National Com

A NOTABLE GATHERING
OF PHILANTHROPISTS TO DIS
CUSS RESTRICTIVE MEASURES.
Assembled This Afternoon and Will
Have Meetings Tomorrow?Favor
Law Proposed for District.
The second annual meeting of the nation
al child labor commltieo began today at
3 o'clock p.m. In the auditorium of the
New Wlllard. Sessions will be held tonight,
Saturday and Sunday. The general topic
of the whole convention will be "Child
Labor?a Menace to Industry. Education
and Good Cltlsenshlp." The committee 19
an organization of men and women who
nre known throughout the country for their
philanthropic works, particularly in the
Interest of the young.
The topic for discussion today was "Re
cent Legislation and Efforts to Restrict
Rev. A. J. McKelway, D. D.,
Assistant Secretary National Child Labor Com.
Child Labor In the United States." The
meeting was presided over by Felix Adler,
Ph. D.. professor of social ethics at Co
lumbia University. New York, and chair
man of the national child labor committee.
Addresses were made by Commissioner
Henry B. F. Macfarland, by Felix Adler
on '"The Menace of Child Labor;" Samuel
M. Lindsay, Ph. !)., on "The Progress and
Outlook of the Movement Against Child
Labor," and by Rev. A. J. McKeiway, D.D.,
on "Child Labor in the Cotton Industry of
the Southern States."
Advocate Restrictive Law.
The activity of the national committee,
according to Secretary Lindsay, at th's spe
cial time is due to the desire of the com
mittee to assist in promoting the passage of
a child labor bill for the District of Colum
bia. He says:
"President Roosevelt, in his message at
the opening of the last seas on of Congress,
recommended in strong terms a model child
labor law for the District of Columbia, in
order that Congress might set a worthy ex
ample to ti-e st:.tos in which It has no power
to legislate on this subject, by wise and
disc, imin iting legislation for the District
of Columbia, over which it has the neces
sary power for such legislation.
"A citizrns' child labor committee of the
District of Columbia was organized at a
meeting held at the house of Mr. Gifford
Pinehot, the rasldent member of the na
tion il child labor committee, on January
20, llXKi. and this committee has approved a
bill, which was presented in both houses of
Congress and rece'ved a favorable report
from the subcommittee of the Senate com
mittee on the District of Columbia, after
having been submitted to the Commis
sioners of the District of Columbia and
approved by them.
"It was impossible to secure the enact
ment of this bill at the short session of
Congress last year Ly reason of the pres
sure of oth< r legislation. Therefore it will
be presented again at the beginning of the
session which convened on the first Monday
of December. 1905. The bill thm submitted
will he in the exact form which was re
ported favorably by the subcommittee of
the Senate, approved by the Commissioners
of the District of Columbia, the citizens'
child labor committee of the District of
j Columbia and the national child labor com
mittee. We propose to bend all efforts to
have the bill passed."
Committee Members Welcomed.
Commissioner Macfarland, In his address
of welcome to the delegates, said:
"No one could be more welcome to the na
tional capital than you, who come in the
interest of the children- of our country.
Their appeal to our hearts Is as strong as
ever. All the worid loves a child, as the
celebration of Christmas will soon attest
once more. All fathers and mothers want
their children to have every advantage in
life, and all right-minded men and women
broaden out this- feeling to take In all chil
dren. We want the child to have full child
hood. The 'vision splendid' fades all too
quickly Into the common day. The only
true liberty, equality and fraternity?child
hood's exclusive possession?turn all to soon
Into our common living. Moreover, this eco

Ing thst my digestive apparatus, never very strong,

effect of the starchy, highly seasoned, greasy

"I heard of the predigested Grape-Nut's food ahd

cannot have economic fruits. Stunted chil
dren make stunted citizens. And stunted
citizens made a stunted state. Ail our ma
terial wealth would be dearly purchased at
the price of the labor of the children, and in
ft few generations we would lose not only
that wealth but our national life. Hence,
under the compelling demand of the new
industrial civilization, with its great and
growing cities, the new legislation for the
protection of child labor, which is funda
mental to the protection of all labor and to
the preservation of society.
"The District of Columbia Is nof an indus
trial or manufacturing community, no large
number of children are employed and the
more serious evils found elsewhere do not
exist. But prevention is better than rem
edy, and we seek a law which shall be a
model and shall take us out of the black
list of states and territories which have no
child-labor laws. The Commissioners have
once more asked Congress to enact a bill
drafted by them on the model approved by
your committee and are hopeful that it will
be passed at this session of Congress, with
any amendments that may be deemed neces
sary."
Dr. Adler's Address.
The chairman of the association, Felix
Adler, In the principal address of the after
noon. said:
"The emancipation of childhood from
economic servitude is a social reform of the
first magnitude. It Is also one upon which
we can all unite. And one particular ad
vantage of It I should like to point out,
namely, that it Is calculated to be the best
induction into the right spirit of social re
form. that It will attune the community in
which it is achieved to a favorable recep
tion of sane and sound social reforms gen
erally. Because if once it comes to be an
understood thing that a certain sacredness
'doth hedge around' a child, that a child is
industrially taboo, that to violate Its rights
is to touch profanely a holy thing, that it
has a soul which must not be blighted for
the prospect of mere gain: If this be once
generally conceded with regard to the child
the same essential reasoning will be found
?to apply also to the adult workers.
"And there is one additional word whioh
I should like to say: It Is not enough to
shut the children out of the factory, we
must also bring the-m Into the school, and
compel parents. If necessary, to send them
to school; the movement for compulsory ed
ucation everywhere goes hand In hand, and
must go handln hand with the child labor
momement. A more convincing appeal than
oomes to us from these two movements
Jointly, the child labor and the educational
movements, in my Judgment, cannot be con
ceived of. And without the former the lat
ter cannot -succeed." *
Children in the South.
Rev. A. J. McKelway, speaking of child
labor In southern industry, said In part:
"The larger part of the children enrolled
In the census as engaged In gainful occupa
tions in the south are employed on the
farm, being counted as wage-earners
through the operation of the tenant sys
tem. This 1a not an abuse except as It In
terferes with school opportunities. The
number of children employed In mercan
tile pursuits is inslgnlticant. The number
engaged In manufacturing is large, much
larger than tfhe census Indicates. Ninety
one per cent of these are found in the four
cotton growing, cotton manufacturing
states of North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia and Alabama.
"It is a rude awakening that has come
to our people, that the abolition of negro
slavery marked the beginning of white
child slavery, that our pet industry Is not
different in the south from what it was for
a hundred years in old and New England,
an industry distinguished for Jong hours
and low wages, and cursed by the employ
ment of children on a larger scale and of
tenderer years than any other industry In
the world.
"Conditions are Just now at their worst
from the increasing demand for southern
goods, the tempting profits of their manu
facture and 'the pressing need for mora
labor to meet the sudden and tremendous
expansion of the industry. But the spirit
of reckless commercialism must yield to the
unanimous protest of pulpit and press and
the insistent demand of the physician ar.d
the school teacher that the child must not
sacrifice health and education for the bake
of the ptttance that Is the wage of his
tired and puny hands."
