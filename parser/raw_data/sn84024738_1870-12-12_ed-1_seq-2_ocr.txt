The Free Bridge.
This very important enterprise, we arc
irrntitied to say, is at la?t about to be suc
cessful. Toe raai i Question at this time i?
as to tbe point of the river at which it shall
bo built. In a published letter, Colouel
Bcffi.v, of Chesterfield, reviews the four
routes that have been surveyed by Colonel
Clakee, enpneer. and argues in favor of
tae fourth, which crosses the river to the j
Richmond side at the f?>ot of 9th stieef. in
deed the three first named arc no close to
gether that there is little difference between
them. The first. Is .Mayo'* bridge, and the
second and third will approach the Kich
mend shore \ery ue/?r f>> Mayo's bridge
one on the east, nr. J the other on the
west side of it. in :Ue matter of cost, tbe
foujth route has greatly the advantage. The
Mtimate stand ? thus :
jMayo*< *i:-4,oco
No. s 121 ooo
Ki'uU? So, S
Ki>u ? No. 76,000
ITappily that which we think is tbe best
of all the routes is cheaper tliau tho roo>t
oostly of them by ?179,000, and cheaper
t&au 5o. 2, the lowest of the lir>t three, by
the sum of $40, wO,
Col. ticFFiy a argument is conclusive, and
there should uut be two opinious upon the
subject. A tree bridge must end in abol
ishing tolls tor crossing James river; and
L a nee bridge were buili close to .Mayo's
bridge it woutd end in two tree bridges so
near each other that botb together wouiu
have ouly the lacilities tn.it would be atioiU
ed bv one. That of itself is suibeicut to
settle' the question ; but then the economy
of the route to yih street is another argu
ment that is of itself conclusive. And yet
it has otner most important advantages
over any other. The rapidity ot tue
flow of water along tbe sue of this
route prevents the rise of water in a flood
at that point to so great a height as below.
For instance, in the iate fluod the rise iu
the line of 9th street was only rune and a
qu ^rlerftict, while at AIayo's iiridge the
rise was ttcenly-tix and a quarter /ml !
Any oue can readily perceive the uuvuutugc
of the position of tue route -.>o. 4. The
foundation tor the pieis i>the best possible,
and the bridge upon piers only thirteen
feet above low water would be as safe as
?Mato'b bridge upon piers thirty feet high.
But the bridge along route Xo. 1 would
strike the very he-art of Richmond, while
on tbe Manchester side it will in a few
years be equally central. The teudency ol
river towns is always up the stream.
Richmond has in her growth moved thus.,
and if ever there is an exception to this
rule, It is established that this exception
cannot be here. The circumstances plainly
encourage the growth of population up
the river. i?o that in a few years the town
of Manchester, for the want of this bridge
?cro>s to Dth street in Richmond, would be
subjected to very great inconvenience.
The fact is, the arguments are so im
mensely in favor of this route that opposi
tion cannot spring from any motive but sell
interest or from any idea save the most con
tracted. Whether we consider the scenen
find the salubrity of the situation, or the
practical reasons in reg*rd to cost, accom
modation, and durability, the decision is all
the world to nothing in favor of route
So. 4.
The building of the bridge on this route
will secure another free bridge upon the
?ite of Mnyo's bridge. The building ol
either of the two located near that bridge
cannot possibly increase the public accom
modation should Mayo's bridge uftenvards
become free.
We trust that those having control of the
matter will settle the question iu favor ol
the upper route. Fifty yeur6 ago a bridge
was built on the site of this proposed
bridge. It was a sort ol' phnk road? the
pranks being nailed upon sills; fastened to
the rocks by strong bolts. It was only a
little above low water. This was Trent's
bridge. It was niuoh of the time uudei
water and yet its lower rate* so affected the
business of Mayo's bridge that Col. 3iayc>
deemed it his interest to get rid of its com
petition by paying an annuity to Its ownei
during his litetime.
It is time that we had the pas?age-way
across James river freed from taxation. On
the two sides of the river, exclusive of the
counties there are 70,000 people. We sup
pose that there is not another case of such
a population accumulated near the shores
of & river like the James? not wider, and
yet so easily bridged? payiug a tux for
crossing it. If there is another like it, it
should only increase surprise. One is
?nough, but it is no credit to this commu
nity that that one is here in this locality, so
favored by nature.
The Gathering Storm.
No observant man can mistake the sign'
of the gathering storm of the political skies,
The clouds and the mu/Ded thunder foretell
the power and magnitude of the tempest
that Is to wreck many who have braved
the winds of popular opinion.
There is no peace? no rest? in the con
dition of public affairs. President Gbant
lias madly, or stupidly, enti usteel himself to
the guidance of the most bliud and ma
lignant men? men whose history shows
that they have fattened on the prejudices
and rancors of the times, and whose only
hope of being continued in office is in the
promotion of the sectional passions, fan
ning the flumes ot fanaticism, and keepintr
alive the bitter prejudices engendered by
Uie war. Even the President's Message is
made the instrument of this atrocious pur
pose. Almost its first paragraph essays to
dignify the slauder of the southern States
put forth by the lowest and most dishonest
of the Radicals? that the freedman is ob
structed in the exorcise of bi3 right to fote.
The President's attempt, or the attempt ol
some one for him? to fire the northern pub
lic against the South must fail. A falsehood
does not grow respectable by getting into a
high place, but, on the other hand, becomes
all the more monstrous when beheld so im
pudently displayed.
General Butlzb, who is now, if u bottled
XXO," "bottled up" along with General
Gsirr, seconds the President in his effort
to inflict injury and humiliation with his
amnesty bill, than which no more insulting
proposition was ever made under the dis
guise of clemency to a people.
Yes, it is all the time the name thing. To
humiliate the South and to make her people
distrusted in every way is the policy of the
ultra-Radicals, who have gotten control of
General Geakt. They have promised from
time to time to rive up this policy ** as soon
as it oo aid be done safely "?i.e., as soon as
It could be done with safety to the Repub
lican party. But every year they fail to see
that Republicanism is safe, and so they
eaa't change their policy. The southern
people must be ever convicted of cruelty
to negroe*. The negro is the petted ape
carried about by the Government, and
which will, as in the fable, be at last drop
ped fatally upon the rock* aud left to perish 1
by those who have never used birn out of I
any true feeling of bympathy for him, but
only for their own selflsli and detestable
parti.*nn ends.
In thin policy General Grant rocs back
upon himself? abandons his liberal views
one! schcmcs developed in his protection of
Lbe find Ills followers from that jackal
Judge UNnFRwooD, and his plan of the re
storation of Virginia. He had the people
with him in th?Hc. (or they were really in
the line of pcaco and restoration of the
rountrv. But. as he goes back on his own
policy, the people will go against him. lie
instructed his favorites in Missotirl to
stand t?P against his Virginia policy ; bnt
rbe people scouted his instructions, and
maintained that policy.
And so is the early Grant policy? de
veloped under the wise counsels of Scho
fjeld and Rawlins and encouraged by
ieneial Sheruajj? adhered to by the be9t
tnd most powerful communities in the
Union. They think that 4< let us have
peace " is a mockery, uuless there in some
tbinc done honestly and sincerely designed
to produce harmony, and banish sectional
discord and distrust from the public coun
sels and the nation.
So we sec how people are dropping off
from the war party and expressing their
hostility to further penalties and vindictive
policies, 'i he " new movement " in Vir
ginia, origiually favored by Grant, has
swept over the country. It was a move
ment in favor of peace, equality, and jus
tice, in all public administration, including
taxation and disbursement ? equality in the
burthens and the benefits of the Govern
ment.
In every particular the present Admin
istration has discarded this liberal aud just
policy. Distrust the South? heap up
burthens upon the weak? continue the ex
orbitant taxes? lot the capitalists still
suck tiie blood of the nation? keep out the
interest-bearing notes? non-interest-bearing
notes would be better for the people, but
not so pood for capitalists? and we must
take care of the latter I
Now here is a sum of oppression aud
wrong? of opposition to peace and har
mony?that may well enrage the people.
They arc discontented, and growing daily
more so. The storm is rising and spread
ing, and will bur?t upon the incompetent
and malignant officials and sweep them
away. Good men are combining against
the abuse of power and the war upon the
peace and dignity of the nation. "What
ever they choose to call themselves, their
cause is great, and triumph they must.
" Let us," indeed, " have peace."
Mcsic.? We have from the publishers,
Oliver Ditson & Co., of Boston, "All
Alone," music by Professor W alter, poe
try by " L. of Baltimore? the whole
dedicated to Miss M. F. Hoffman, of Balti
firnore. The mu-ie is plaiutively sweet and
the poetry sweetly sentimental. The com
bined influence will possibly do damage or
crive great relief to some susceptible hearts.
Composers such as the author of this songand
sentiment lay under obligation s a large com
munity of both sexes who are in the inter
mediate period between "first love" and
marriage. Safety-valves through which to
pour out their sorrows and woes to the at
tentive ears of theuir and woods are both
mentally and mechanically of infinite ad
vantage. Tliev are the best remedies for
rhc congestive fever of love, and their au
thors are beuefictors of mankind.
Small.? We learn from the Annual Re
port of Treasurer Spinner that the United
states Government has made over $182,000
in the last seven years by deducting from
each greenback returned to the Treasury
for redemption (or renewal in kind) a sum
proportioned to the part of the note which
had been lost or destroyed. As the issuing
? if notes is so good a business, it would be
well, perhaps, for Uncle Sam to monopo
lize it.
Gbeeley's Pluck. ? Hear him:
"If the dominant Democracy of North
Carolina have a right to be represented in
Congress at all, they should be represented
truly; and Vance, who six or seven years
? go exhorted them to <ti?ht the Yankees
till hell should be so full of them that their
legs would stick out of tbe window,' is a
ui.iu alter their own heart. We venture to
predict that he will be found by the Repub
licans a more liberal and chivalrous antag
onist th:in Horatio Seymour or John T.
Hoffman."
Again:
"Ten of them [such men as Toombs,
Ithett, Forest, and Jotin Forsyth] In the
I present Congress would have insured us at
least twenty more Republicans in the next:
four or five of them from this State. Either
we are inconceivably stupid, or this whole
business of shutting rebels out of Congress,
when there are constituencies eaj>er to send
them thither, evinces an amazing lack of
common sense."
"We return thanks to Treasurer Spinneb
for copies of his annual report.
The Virginia Message ? Gov. Walker's
message to the Legislature of Virginia isnn
honest and dignified paper. It recommends
a payment ot the State debt according to
the letter and spirit of the promise, and dis
plays a becoming resentment at tho very
, t ricky course of the President In regard to
I the peace of the Commonwealth. To ap
preciate the- financial part of the message,
it is necessary to know that, while thirty
live counties were torn violently from tlie
Old Dominion and erected into the State of
WestVirgiuia.no provision has ever been
made bv the former .Republican govern- ,
ments of the new Slate Cor the assumption j
of its just share of the Virginia debt as
existing at the time of the severance, and
upon the parent State has been and is
now imposed the full weight of the obliga
tion. The effect of this has been to take
population away at the same time that the
debt owing by ihat population was lett be
hind; and tb'at uuder these circumstances
Virginia is advised that repudiation cannot
even be thought of reflects credit on tli3
oflicial giving the counsel. As for tbe mili
tary count, the Governor gives the facts as
follows : That sundry negro settlements
retused to move from* lands to which the
courts declared they had no title ; that 011
the requisition oi the State Executive, as
provided in tbe . Federal Constitution,
United States troops were furnished to en
force the writs, but were withdrawn
before the process could be fullv executed ;
and that, in response to a civil inquiry
as to the meaning of this rather palpa
ble hiut to the negroes to use violence,
the President curtly announced that '? tbe
order withdrawing the troops will be ad
hered to." To supply a force competent
to execute the process ot the courts the
G ivernor therefore recommends the organ
isation of the State militia, adding : u I
cannot consent to subject the Common
wealth or myself to the danger of any fur
ther indignity by requesting the aid of
Federal troops." Were it onlv that the
earth may yield her increase, It is to be
hopeu the State muy soon have a force of
her own to make the laws respected ; for
it there be one thing more- than another
that cumbers the ground it is one
of these squatter negro villages to bo
found on the southern coast. Roosting or
dinarily in tbe most fertile places? notably
the Georgia and South Carolina islands,
once so famous for the long-staple cotton,
the finest in the world, and in Virginia on
the best market garden tracts*? they are but
so many caterpillars on the green leaf, an
eye-sore, a nuisance, a ravage. To snore
and to steal and to vote are the occupations
of their inhabitant* ; and perhaps it is only
b iuse of tbU latter avocation the Govern
ment abets them in the other two, insult
ing, in order to do ?o, the one single honest
and respectable Governor who "presides,
saving Alabama, over any southerh State,?

ET FAITH WELL FOUNDED.? Tn '
old time*, at tba commencement of every ??TW)n,
it wan the fanh'on to take a strong cathartic *s a
safeguard against a change of temperature. It
was a worae than senseless practice. The people
of our day understand tiie matter better. Inste'd
of dopipting the sv?tera, they reinforce It. In the
method they adopt tbey exhibit a wlae dlscrlmlua- J
tion. Inrtaad of resorting to the vitiated stimu
lants of commerce, or anvof the compounds de
rived from them, they pot their faith In the only
absolutely pure Invlarorantprocu-able In the mar?
ket-HWTHTT ICR'S BTOMACH BITTERS.
T*elr faith Is well founded. Never has any tonic
medicine been prepm d with snch scrupulous pre
cision and conscientious c?re. It is a vegetable
compound of which everv Ingredient Is sonnd,
wholesome, and medicinal In lUe true sense of the
word. Now, we have three prominent national
complaint*. One-half of the adult population of
the United States suffer more or less, either from
diseases of the stomach, derangements of the
liver, or affections of the kidneys. Iu no other

whu are fortunate enough to be exempt from them
