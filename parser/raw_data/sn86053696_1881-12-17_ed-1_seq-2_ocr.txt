From a very interesting report in
' the l'icnyanc and Mr. Ellis, we clip
! the following:
, Said Mr. Ellis, iu reply to questions :
" You know this is one of my
j periodical visits to your city iu the
] interest*- of the fish supply. This
; bust tiers calk me to all part* of the
Union, aud iu tlie course of six
' years' operations I have visited every
State «are Oregon."

that they are disposed of as intended.
1 have just delivered a number of
these earji at Chatawa, Tangipahoa
and Amite City, on the Jacksou Rail
road, where they were deposited in
the waters at those places. ] shall go
from here to-morrow over the New
Orleans and Texas Road, and stock
the streams of Louisiana along that
route. Afterwards, 1 shall go up to
Vicksburg to stock the streams in that
section of Mississippi."
" What other sorts of fish have you
found adapted to fioutheru waters ?"
" Principally the shad iu addition to
the carp. The shad require to he
placed in rivers which flow into the
sea sioec they are migratory in their
habits. They go into the fresh water
streams to spawn in the spring season,
and will penetrate far up towards their
head-waters for the purpose, hut as
soon as the work of propagation is
over they go down the river and out
to sea. where they s|ieud the winter,
returning to their accustomed spawn
ing ground lip the rivers on the ap
proach of spring. Tlie instinct of the«;
fish is so unerring in moving them to
return to their river haunts, that shad
marked by having indiu-rubhur bauds
plaeed around them have been known
to return for several successive years
to tlie same spawning ground. Six
years ago 1 put shad in the Ohio
River, and now they are abundant at
Louisville and Cincinnati, caught in
the liver, whereas they were formerly
brought from Baltimore. 1 am satisfied
they eau he caught in the river here
if they are properly fished for.
" How about the carp V'
"O, that is a different sort of fish.
It thrives in ponds and streams which
have little current, and where the
water is warm. It grows rapidly in
this latitude and attains double the
. . „ , ,
size it usually reaches in Northern ;
waters. It is a long-lived hall, carp m !
Europe being known to Imve attained j
the age of thirty years. There was a
very old carp which lived in a pond in
the grounds of Euntaiuhleau which it
is said used to come to be fed at tlie
call of the first Napoleon."
" IIow are these first transported ?"
" Formerly in fifteen-gallon cans of
water, each containing 150 fish, which
are from one inch to three inches in
length. The cans were filled with
water which had to be changed every
day in order to keep the fish alive.
You know tliat the fish in breathing
consume the oxygen of the air which
is inclosed iu the water. This oxygen
by the processes of respiration become«
replaced by carbonic acid which the
fish discharge into the water, thereby
poisoning it for the purposes of breath
ing. Now, the air becomes mixed
with water by means of splashing, aud
such a movement liberate* thecarhouic
acid gas. J discovered, by accident,
that if there were only a small quantity
of water iu the can, just enough to
wet the fish, that the movement of the
fish themselves, combined with the
motion of the train, so agitated the
water that it was kept mixed with air
and free from poisoiious gus. I now
transport the fish iu two-gallqu bucket*,
containing two quarts each of water
aud fifty fish, iiv this means I am
enabled to bring the fishes from the
Government »pawing pools at Wash
ington to Now Orleans without a
change of water. The unscientific
person will understand that the air
which the fish creates is only tliat
which becomes mixed with the water
by mechanical movement, or that
which is given off by the growth of
water plants. Water is largely com
posed of oxygen, but-tlie fishes have
no power to decompose the water aud
secure tbe life-giving element."
We bave repeatedly urged Ute un
rfaiiee of introducing tbi* valuable
table fish into our parish, and now,
after having had a supply sent to
Lake Cliaries, it is peculiarly nufor
tuoate that tbev were not prompt!»
delivered.

Origin ot ÎBL usonrv. ^o. X.
Editor" Lake Chartes Echo :
It is presumable that if the origin
of Masonry is traced back as far as the
flood, it will he sufficient to estab- I
lisb its ancient origin. And here let
me premise that simply because an in
stitution is of ancient origin, is no
good reason why it should he called
honorable.
H its object, its design, its purpose
; ls to ameliorate, or in other words to
! raise up, and elevate to a higher grade
j its votaries, then it is worthy of all
honor; and this we propose to amply
a
it
exemplify before we are through.]
Now. if we tHkc tbe Bible, it makes
no difference whether the Douay, King
James' translation, so-called, I do not
know why, for he had nothing to do
with except to approve when completed,
or the new revision, we find that wlu-n
the waters assuaged Noah and his
sons left the Ark, and the first thing
done was to erect an altar upon which
an offering was made, or offered the
Great Architect, or God of heaven and
earth. It is true that this altar was
built of unhewn stone, or rough ash
lars; yet it shows that ut that day they,
(there being but-four men), knew tl'ic
principles of Masonry or they could
not liave erected that altar.
Again: through the loug lapse of the
Patriarchal age the same skill «at re
quired in the erection of altars. Take
the history of Abraham for instance,
whenever he removed, the first thing
erected was mi altar, oven before he
pitched his tent. This was carried
forward through many years until the
Israelites removed to Egypt, and after
many years were subjected to bondage
.wherein they forfeited their trades in
making brick and erecting structures.
This knowledge, handed from father
to sou, was taken to Palestine, or the
holy land, and there perfoetod. The
proof is given iu tlie Bible, where it
»» said that twelve stones wore taken
from the bed of Jordan and erected
up'on the opposite side a* a memorial
of tbe passage of Jordan. The call
ing of mi Operative Masou was from
this time earnestly and vigorously fol
lowed by tliat people, being clasaified
as we have said iu a former eomw uui
oat ion.
This was continued, they increasing
in knowledge, and that knowledge ex
tending to Tyre, « kind of half cousin
to tlie Israelites, until flic surrounding
country was well introduced in the
-art.

sis of the rotund Robeson, commenced
fencing for the leadership of the lie
publican side of the House, while ex
Sjveaker Randall and S. S. Cox, fami
liarly known as "Sunset" Cox, 3ed off
on the Democratic side. In ten min
utes, the House seemed to he in hope
less confusion, half a dozen members
speaking at the same moment, while
the new Speaker rapped 'his gavel
helplessly, and essayed, awkwardly, to
get things straight. Mr. Kusson, the
only Republicau who is competent to
control this turbulent body from tbe

in a remote part of the hall. It is
evident that Mr. Keifer has a stormy

nothing of natural qualification for

Bgent, " Wanderer," who spent a few
days in onr midst a short time ago : %
After leaving Orange my next stop
ping place was Lake Charles, La., which
I found to be a beautiful little place of
two tbonsand inhabitants. To one
who fc ftd li^ pi mou tlo,
Wes^ Texas where «jiool of «water
» *. al _ — "*
larger than a goose pond ir rare, the
view tliat greeted lue the morning af
ter my arrival was enchanting. Spread
ing out. airily to file north, sontii and
west was a magnificent sheet of water,
dotted over w ith glistening sails, and
o'er whose surface miniature white
caps danced and flashed in the morn
ing sunshine. The town, with its
shining church steeples and snov.-white
houses, nestling along the eastern
shore, looked more like some fancy
picture ihuu a reality. Lake Charles,
like all the towns iu East Texas aud
Western Louisiana, is supported prin
cipally hv the timber trade, though
considerable quantities of rice is pro
duced. There is one large rice mill
in the place, owned by Messrs. Iiynn ic
Sons, which they informed me had all
it could do. Here, as at Beaumont
and Orange, tlie ring and clatter of
saw mills is heard from morning till
night. Several of the largest mills,
mid there are eleven, arc situated at
wlmt is called Went Lake Charles,
which lies immediately across the lake
from the main town, and is distant
about two miles. This place was once
celebrated for its fine oranges, but now
there arc very few raised—none for
export. The troublesome little insect
tliat has for years infested the orange
orchards of Florida, attacked the or
chards a year or two ago and have
almost totally destroyed them. This
is a great pity, as the country soemed

Why They Oeten Fail.—Y oung
men often fail to get along in the world
because they neglect small opportuni

they are not promoted to uhurge of

greater things. A young man wiio

he gets a place of responsibility, then
he w ill show people what he can do.
This is a very great mistake. What
ever his position may be, he should
master it in all its details, and perform
all his duties faithfully. The habit of
doing his work thoroughly aud eou
scientioualy is what is most likely to
enable a young man to make his way.

This is considered a great feat, and
