You Are Mighty Right.
CrswfordsTllla Journal.
Tho .Review proposes to have all
tho colored citizens of Montgomery
county use their eliorts to drivo back
colored refugees who may see proper
to come here. If that paper expects
the colored people of Montgomery
county to join the Democratic party
in a mean and conternptiblo prescrip
tion of their own race, through the
mean and sordid motives to which it
appeals, it will find itself very badly
deceived. There may be white Dem
ocrats who would attempt to drive
the poor fugitive, in search of a peace
ful home, back to the blood-hound
and the shotgun of the Mississippi
bulldozer, but it will search creation
over in vain for a negro mean enough
to assist him in his inhuman attempt.
The same spirit would have placed
Zach illiams, Harn oodfork.Lem
Gipson, Eph Wheeler, Aaron McCrea
and Dick lliatt bacK into slavery, Jo
Fisher and Geo. Vilest to Germany,
and George Markley and Ben Silvers
to the btatcs they- camo from. Such
a theory is Know Nothingism gone
to seed.

"To-day' exclaims the Sentinel, "if
there were no negroes in Indianapo
lis, the price of white labor would be
at least one-third higher."
"Why, bless j'our idiotic soul, if there
were no white people in Indianapolis,
negro labor would be at least two
thirds higher.
If there were no newspapers in In
dianapolis, the Sentinel might have a
comfortable circulation. If there were
no Republicans in Indianapolis, tho
Democratic party might have a ma
jority. This is logic gone to seedbut
it is the kind that abounds in the pre
judiced pate of the writer of the above
quotation. Indianapolis Leader.
This is the logic of the Indianapo
lis Leader, one of the spiciest of our
exchanges. Locke himself could not
beat it.
' Whatsoever a Man Soweth that
shall He neap."
How true are the words above, and
how fully does the farmer, planter
and gardener understand the truth
of it?
No farmer ever sows wheat and
expects to reap a crop of barley; rei
ther docs he sow oats and expert a
crop of rye; hut he expects to sow and
to reap only of such as ho has sown.
The stock-raiser expects only fiom
certain kinds and grades of stock he
will have only a corresponding grado
or kind. The full breed will produce
a full breed, while tho mixed and mon
grel kind will bring the same. The
same is true of tho elements. ' Heat
gives off heat, while ice will give of!
cold. The honest, the upright, tho
good and the truo will give off liko
qualities, while tho evil, tho deprav
ed, the low and the vicious produce
tho namo evils.
Tho parents who are healthy and
strong, generally have strong, healthy
children; while parents who are
weak morally, socially, intellectually
and physically, goncrally their chil
dren will show at once all these marks
upon their bodies and minds, or upon
both I How often and how terribly
are parents made to feel and to trenv
bio when they know tho many dread
evils they so continually are bringing
to bear upon their children. Look at
the scrofula, consumption, and scores
of other diseases preying upon their
vitals, while impure and poisonous
blood courses their overy vein. God
says, "I will visit the iniquities uf the
fathers upon their children, even unto
the third and fourth generation of
them that hato rao, and keep not my
commandments." Then are not theso
ills in most cases chargeable to par
ents? Is it not a fearful thing for par
ents to bo thus entailing misery upon
tho unborn? Should you rest content
till you have rooted out the very
seeds of disease from your own bod
ies? While it is criminal to disoboy
any law, is it not more criminal to
disoboy tho laws of nature and of life ?
Is it not criminal to drink and fill
your body with disease and your
heart with murder? And he who
thus destroys his own mind and body;
can he become the father of strong
bodied and strong-minded children?
Like begets liko. The stream can
not riso higher than its source. Can
the idle, vicious, indolent and baso
produce that which is perfect ?
As certainly as bad colds and
coughs, neglected, will bring on con
sumption and death, just that certain
ly aro we to blame if wo do not euro
theso evils. Then aro parents not to
blame for their own weakness and
ignorance, when they know full well,
that they are not a blessing oither to
themselves or to the world, and that
thev are continually thrustinrr thous
ands into life without boing able to
help society take caro of them ? Can
tho wicked and vile of earth estimate
tho dread calamities being entailed
upon the world by such a wretched
class of beings as those who hato God
and keep not his commandments aro
continually raising up? Is not the
liar, the thief and tho drunkard but
the children of liko parents? Does
not the drunkard often inherit his
love for strong drink from drunken
parents ?
History teaches us that nearly all
of our good and great men, have had
the best women on earth lor mothers.
George Washington was tho son of a
religious and pious mother, rrofes
sor O. S. Fowler, the great American
Phrenologist, says that "it is not so
much what parents do, as it is what
thev are. that controls their ott-
spring." While we can hide our
faults from others, we cannot hinder
the young from partaking of all our
natures. Then should not parents
cease to do evil ; cease to poison your
hearts aud minds, and cease to murder
those poor bodies, given us for wise
and good purposes, and learn that
whatever we sow, that' shall we also
reap.
Kot only God but the vile sin
ner hi rcself remembers all his sins
that he has committed. Though
scores of years may have elapsed, this
sin will never be effaced from his
mind, and the remembrance of it will
continually fill his mind with fear.
Such being the fact, how all-important
to the young, that they carefully
avoid all sin, and strive to be right in
all things and at all times.
Those who commit theso awful
crimes and sins in youth, breaking
away from all parental restraint, pro
faning tho Sabbath and indulging
their evil passions, are laying up a
treasure of sorrow and pain for all
coming life, here and hereafter. Tho

PETITION TO
To the Hox. J. D. Williams, Governor of Indiana :
Sir We, your petitioners, represent that William Nelson, a citizen of the State of
Indiana, of the county, of Vigo, is now confined in the Prison South, at Jeffersonville, by the
decree of a Vigo county court, for the alleged crime of marrying a white woman. We
respectfully represent to your excellency that the law under which William Nelson is confined
is a relic of pro-slavery legislation, dictated by Southern slaveholders, previous to the late
war ; that the said law is in conflict with the amended constitution and laws of our country,
and entirely at variance with tho genius of our free institutions. We therefore respectfully
ask you to exercise your prerogative by releasing William Nelson from the penitentiary and
restoring to him his liberty, of which he is unjustly deprived, and your petitioners will ever
pray.

Tho Trio
parent, the teacher and tho
The parent is defined to be
The
child:
tho father or the mother of tho child.
Tho teacher is one who instructs tho
child. Tho child is the son ordaugh
terjof a parent.
Wo havo now arranged all of tho
parts of our trio, and are ready to
sing each one performing his part
as directed. To escape all possibilities
of a discord, each should lirst execute
his part alone, beforo all uro allowed
to sing together honce the parent
shall take tho soprano, tho child tho
alto, and tho teacher tho bass. The
school board shall beat time. The
parents part runs as follows: Truth
fulness my child; obedience to all in
whoso care you may bo placed; polite
ness to all whom you meet; .honesty
in all of your dealings; a prompt at
tendance in the Sunday School; a fer
vent love for the church; remember
thy Creator in tho days of thy youth;
love and serve God, votir continual
preserver. The child's part: 1, As
the truthfulness of you father, so 1
shall be; 2, my obedience depends
upon your orders and tho desire you
have to see them promptly perform
ed; :i, my politeness will germ from
that thrown out by tho way in which
you and father speak to each other
and about your neighbors; 4, tho hon
esty is dependent upon the payment
of your just debts, and if unable to
pay them when asked, your answer
to your creditors as to the timo of
their final settlement; 5, my atten
dance upon tho Sunday School will
depend upon tho time you lio in bed
on Sunday mornings; G. my love for
tho church can be produced by hav
ing family prayer, and your love for
tho church and your pastor; 7, if you
remember your creator in tho days of
your age, I shall certainly imitate you
whilo 1 am young, so nearly as I pos
sibly can; 8 my love for God is in
creased, according to the God you
show mo in your ways, actions and
conversation.
The teacher's part: 1. The teacher
teaches tho child what truthfulness is,
and what happiness there is for one
who always speaks tho truth how
his future success depends upon the
acquisition of this habit of speaking
the truth at all times. To do this, the
teacher should be truthful himself
2. That the obedience to the laws
of one's country lessons tho number
ot jails, State prisons and gallows.
3. No one is truly educated who has
not yet learned politeness; for it is
tho very soul of a refined education,
and is the line of demarkation be
tween barbarism and civilization. A
Your living depends upon your hon
esty, for no one will give you employ
ment unless you prove yourself to bo
an honest boy or girl. 5. The Bible
is the foundation of all just laws, and
its principles should be learned early
in life, as they will be needed in your
old age. Here the bass is allowed to
rest or sing at pleasure, and as many
to whom we sing desire our silence,
we will give the benefit of our option
at tho rests of six, seven and eight.
But on Sunday our divine can ably
sing these parts, that are forbidden
the teacher by many.
We are now all ready to sing to
gether but just at this point, when
half through the fourth and filth meas
ures, wc hear a discord. We stop to
see where it is. In looking around,
we behold a Dante, Thomas Payne
and a Bob Ingereoll. Payne declares
that the Bib'e is a branch of ancient
mythology, and Ingersoll says that
Moses made moro mistakes in the
composition of the piece we are try
ing to sing. Well, what shall we do?
The Board says to the teacher, "sing
as far as the sixth, then rest, and let
parents and their ministers sing as
best they can" hence, we are seen
in the ninetecth century in this pre
dicamentdifferent churches singing
different parts to the same people,
(Americans), and all singing at the
same time. How will this piece end?
No one stops to consider, and I imag

To the Editor of the Indianapolis
Leader: I beg leave to give to the
many readers of your excellent and
instructive sheet, a brief history of
the life of Gen. J. 31. Shackelford, as
far as my acquaintance with him will
admit:
I have been personally acquainted
THE GOVERNOR OF INDIANA.
with him for twonty-fivo years. I
have ever known him to bo a truo
r l x i t
menu 10 mo oppressed nice; i never
know him to strike one while ho had
them in his charge. He is held in
the highest regard by tho colored
people ot Kentucky; whenever they
near of his coming to Kentucky, they
shout for joy to meet him.
In my acquaintance of twenty five
years with him, 1 never know him to
begin a thing without first giving it
duo consideration, whereby ho has
over prospered.
If ho bo elected for Governor of the
Stato of Indiana, ho will do nothing
to interfere with any business what
ever, unless it bo contrary to tho
statutes of tho Stato. Although he
was a slave-holder, ho bore arms to
liberate them.
Gen. J. M. Shackelford is a man of
inrtuenco and unrivaled eloquence.
His ability to act in the capacity ot
Governor is unquestionable, and if
overy colored man of influence will
use every exertion to place General
Shackelford at tho head of tho ticket,
they will gain an everlasting benefit
to the State. Respectfully,
Our Imm grants.

It is true that a largo majority of
tho colored immigrants from tho
South aro poor, but why? It is be
cause they nave been cheated out of
their labor and their prosperity for
years. They come to us with hands that
are able and willing to work, and all
thev ask is employment. Having been
robbed, they aro without money, and
need a few days entertainment, and
perhaps some clothing to protect them
from tho rigors of winter, but when
they find homos they will tako caro
of themselves. No raco of people
show a lower rato of public paupers
than they, and it is an insult to good
sense and common fairness to call
them such.

knowledgement to the giver of ail good for the
large and unusual measure of national pro
perlt y which we now enjoy.
The most interesting events which have oc
curred in our public affairs since my last an
nual ruessaKe to cxmgress ure connecteo. witn
the financial operations of the Government
directly affecting ihebualnes luuresu o. the
country. I congratulate Congress on the suc
cessful execution ot the resumption act. At
the time fixed and in the manner contem
plated by law, United HtnU notes began to be
redeemed In culu. Mince the lt of January
last they have been promptly redeenud on
presentation, and lu all bust net transactions.
I publio and private, in all parts or tne country

cess uf the prtclous inetals depNltedor ex

amount of United HUiU-s note redeemed is
about 1 10,0 m) at.
The rehu nipt Ion uf specie payments has been
followed by a very great revival uf business.
With a currency eqlva'eul in value to the
money of the commercial world, we are en
abled to enter upon an equal competition
with other natlous in tnuie and prouuctlon.
The increasing foreign demand lor our manu
factures and agricultural products has caused
a large balance of trade lu our favor, which
has been paid In gold, from the MofJuly
Ust to November lr, to the amount uf about
5tt,UUtl.OlH). HI nee the resumption of specie
payments there has aUo been a msrked and
KTatli)ing iinpiovementuf the public credit.
The bonds of ihe Government bearing only 4
per cent, interest usve been fold at ur above
par. sufllclent In amount to pay oö all uf the
national debt whlcu was redeemable under
present laws. The amount or internd taved
annually by the process of refunding the
debt, since Maich 1, 177, 1st 1117,177.
The bonds sold were largely In
small sums, and the number ot our cltl
ens now holding the public securities is much
greater than ever before. The amount of the
national oebt which matures in l-s than two
f ears Is f7Wi, 121 ,7i ), of which A),0.io,mxj bear
nterest at the rate or 6 jt cent., and the bal
ance lulu bond bearing tt per ceut. Interest.
It is believed that this part of the public debt
can be refunded by the issue of 4-per cent,
bonds, and, by the reduction ol luterest which
will thus be effected, about IU,ui0,UiW can be
annually saved to the treasury. Tosecure this
Important reduction of interest to be paid by
the United Htstes, further legislation U re
quired, whlcu, it is hoped, will be provided by
Congress durli.g Us present sendon.
The coinage of gold by the mints of the
United Htates during the at fUcal year was
fJ0,UKti.V12. The coluage uf silver dollars, sine
the passsge uf the act for that purpose, up to
November 1, 1K7, was IVM.-. of which
12,700,jM have been lssned from the treasury
and are now in circulation, auu f z.-imiou are
still In the possesion of Ihe Government
The pendency of the propcsltlou for uulty of
action between the United Htatta and the
principal commercial nations of Eu
rope, to enect a permaunt syteru
for the eqnsllty of gold and silver in the
recognized money of the world, leads me to
recommend that Congress refrain from rtw
legislation on the general subject. The great
revival of trade, Internal and foreign, will
supply, during the coming year, its own In
structions, which may weU be awaited before
attempting further experimental measures
with the coinage. I would, however, s'.rougly
urge upon Congress the Importance of au
thorizing the secretary of th treasury to sus
pend the coinage of sliver dollars upon the
present legal ratio. The market value of the
silver dollar being uniformly and largely less
than the market va ue ol the gold dollar, It la
obvloualy ltipractlcab!e to mslntain them at
far with each other if both are colued without
tin It. If the cheaper coin is forced into cir
culation It will, If coined without limit, soon
become the so e s audurd of value, and thus
defeat the desired object, which Is a currency
ol both gold and silver, which shall be of
equivalent valu. dollar for dollar, with the
universally recognized money of the world.
The retirement from circulation of United
States notes, wtlh the capacity of legal tender
in private contracts, is a step to be taken lu
our progress toward a safe and stable curren
cy, wblch should be accepted as the policy
and duty of the Government, and the Interest
and security of the people. It Is my firm con
viction that the la-ue of legal-tender paper
money based wholly upon tne authority and
credit f the Government, except in extreme
emergency, 1 without warrant in the constitu
tion, and a violation of sound financial prin
ciples. The Issue of United States notes dur
ing the late civil war with the capacity of
legal tender between private individuals was
not authorized except as a means of rescuiug
the country from imminent perU. The circu
lation of these notes as paper money, for any
protracted period of time after the accom
plishment of this purpose, was not contempla
ted by the framers of the law under which
they were Issued. They anticipated the re
demption and withdrawal of these noles at
the earliest practicable period consistent with
the attainment of the object for which they
were provided.
The policy of the United State, steadfastly
adhered to from the adoption of the constitu
tion, has been to avoid the creation of a na
tional debt, and when, from necessity in Urse
of war, debts have been created, they have
been paid off on the return of peace as rapidly
as possible. With this view, and for this par-
pobe, it is recommended that the existing taws
ior tne accumulation oi a sinaing
fund suffi-
elent to extinguish
the pnblic debt within a
limited period oe maintained.
If any change
or ine oojecta or rates or taxation is Ueemed
necessaty by Congreaa, it is suegc 8ted that ex
perience has shown that a duty can be placed
on tea and coffee, which will not enhance the
price of those articles to the consumer, and
which will add several millions of dollars an
nually to the tr asury.
The continued deliberate vlo'ation by a large
number of the prominent and Influential citi
zen of the Territory of Utah of tbe laws oft be
United wtates lor toe prosecution and punn-h-ment
of polygamy demands the tteutlon of
every department of the Government. Thin
Territory lias a population sufficient to en;ltle
It to admission as a State, and tbe general in
terests of the natlou, as well as the welfare of
the citizens of the Territory, require Its ad
vance from the territorial form of government
to the responsibilities and privileges of a
State. This Important chanee, will not, bow
ever, be approved by the couutry while the
citizens of Utah, in very considerable num
ber uphold a practice wblch is condemned as
a crime by the laws or all clvl.lzed communi
ties throughout the world.
The law for the suppression of this offense
waa enacted with great unanimity by Con
gress more than 17 years ago, but has remain
ed until recently a dead letter In the Territory
of Utah, because of the peculiar difficulties at
tending its enforcement. The opinion widely
fjrevalled among the citizens of Utah tbat the
aw was in contravention of the constitution
al guarantee of religions freedom. This objec
Hon is now removed. The Supreme Court of
the United States has decided the
law to be within the legislative
power of Congress, and binding as
a rule of a Uon for aU who reside within the
Territories, There is no longer any reason for
delay or hesitation in Its enforcement. It
should be firmly and effectively executed, if
not sufficiently Ftrlncent in Its provisions It
should be amended, aud, in Aid ot Ute purpose
in view, I recommend that more comprehen
sive and more searching methods for prevent
ing as well as punishing this crime be pro
vided. It necessary to secure obedience to the
law, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights
and prlvlh ges of citizenship in the Territories
of the United States may be withheld or with
held from those who violate or oppose the
enforcement of the law on this subject.
The elections or tne past year, tnouen occu
pied oniy with State offices, have not failed to
elicit in tbe political discussions which at
tended them all over the country, new and
decisive evidence of the deep Interest which
the great body of citizens take in the progress
of the country toward a more general and
complete establishment, at whatever cost, of
universal security and ireeaom in tue exercise
of the elective franchise. W hlle many topics
of political concern demand great attention
from our people, both in the sphere of na
tional and State authority, I find no reason to
qualify the opiniou I expressed in my last
annual message, that no temporary or admin
istrative interests of government, however
urgent or weighty. wlU ever displace the zeal
of our people In defense of the primary rights
of citizenship, and that the power of public
opinion wlU override all political prejudices,
and all sectional and State attachments, in
demanding tbat aU over our wide territory
the rame and character of citizen of the
United States shall mean one and the tarn
thing, and carry with them anohauenged
