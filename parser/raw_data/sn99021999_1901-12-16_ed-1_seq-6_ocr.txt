A MATT EH A'OT SETTLED.
Governor Savage has ventured to as-
suro the people of Nebraska In an In
terview In tho World-Herald that the
controversy over tho Improper manipu
lation of the state school fund for pri
vate gain lias been settled. The gov-
rnor Is quoted as saying:
You know It has been charged that ho
Invested tho school fund for his own bene
fit and that tho great fund was In danger
of being lost. I want to say that I, with
tho members ot tho Hoard ot Educational
1-ancls and Funds, personally went to tho
treasurer's ofllec, looked through every rec
ord and counted every dollar of cash on
hand. Wo found every dollar thcro In cash
or properly accounted for, and wo found
that Treasurer Stuefer has Invested within
ten months over $1,000,000 of tho public
school funds to the best of his ability. I
want to tell you that every dollar of Ne
braska's money Is In snfo hands, for I be
llovo that Stato Treasurer Stuefer Is ns
honest a man as tho sun over shone upon,
and when the last day of his olllcc expires
you will llnd that every dollar of Nebraska's
money will ho there, not In certificates of
deposit on broken banks, but In cold cash,
ready to bo counted out. You may depend
upon It. That settles ono matter.
Governor Savage may depend upon It
that this explanation does not settle the
matter with tho intelligent people of
Nebraska, by a long ways. His assur
ance that tho records of the stato treas
urer are accurately kept and that in tho
exhibit made to tho Hoard of Educa
tional Lands and Funds every dollar of
tho school money was cither there In
cash or proiwrly accounted Is not called
In question. Hut the mere fact that
the books of the treasurer balance with
tho certlllcates of deposit and cash on
hand does not explain the shady bond
deals and speculative transactions by
which the school fund has been milked
by several thousand dollars that have
gono into tho pockets of middlemen
who had not a dollar of their own nt
stake, but on the contrary were given
the uso of state funds and securities by
tlio state treasurer.
Tho assurance given by Governor
Savage that every dollar of Nebraska's
money Is lu safe hands and that at the
expiration of Mr. Stuefer's term as state
treasurer every dollar of public money
win uo there in cold cash win be very
gratifying to taxpayers of Nebraska, but
that does not meet tho point at Issue.
The question that still confronts the
governor as chief executive of the state
is whether the state treasurer has. lu
mauing investments ot the permanent
school fund, paid heavy bonuses to fa
vorcd bond speculators when he could
and should iiavo dealt directly with the
county boards and either given the re
spective counties the benellt of the ex
cessive Interest cojpons or placed the
coupons to the credit of the school fund
The delusion under which Governor
Savage has been Impressed with tho
Idea that the Stuefer Incident is settled
may perhaps be dispelled when ho reads
the comment of J. Sterling Morton that
appears hi the last number of tho Con
servatlve, which hits the nail on the
head lu this fashion:
Thcro Is an old-fashioned way of clarify
ing muddy water with alum. When tho
Missouri river jiackots wcro doing all tho
carrying trado for uassenctrs and frplL-Mts
betwceu'St. Louis und Nebraska points tho
drinking water was puro Missouri river
aqua, settled nnd clarltlcd with alum.
Tho accounts of Stato Treasurer Stuefer
need clarification. Hut whether alum or
something moro stringent Is required for
tho process Dr. Ilosuwater has not yet
seemingly, determined.
A big frog sitting by a limpid stream
tho bottom of which Is visible to tho nuked
eye, can mnko tho water very muddy tho
moment ho Jumps Into It, and so all tho
Hurt county, Otoo county and other bond
purchases wero cjulto queer and lncxpllca.
bio until Stuefer Jumped Into tho discus
slon of them, and now they aro raoru Ine.v
pllcablo than over and queerer and mud
dicr and nastier. Lot Stuefer havo an ex
pert In truth-telling Inform tho people of
Nebraska about his school money Invest
mcnts.
Surely Mr. Morton Is not prejudiced
against Treasurer Stuefer or hostile to
Governor Savage or any other member
of tho Hoard of Educational Lauds and
Funds, and Mr. Morton rellects the
views of ninety-nine out of every huu
tired people who have given the subject
any thought.
KEOHOAXME THE SEHVICK.
At Us recent convention tho National
Civil Sen-Ice Heform league considered
tho question of reorganizing tho cousti
lar service and thcro was general ap
proval of the bill for this purpose
framed by Senator Lodge. There 1
also a movement on the part of numcr
ous commercial bodies looking to the
reorganization of the cousular service
As the president Is strongly committed
to this there Is very favorable promise
of action on tins Important subject by
tho present congress and probably at
this session.
The Lodge bill Is a comprehenslv
measure, which not only recognizes th
civil service reform principle, but pro
vldes for tho cooperation of tho civil
service commission In the examination
ot candidates for appointment In the
consular body. The bill proposes tho
gradual re-examlnatlon and re-classltl
cation of the service within two year
of the passage of the act. The exam
Inlnu' board Is to be composed of tho
secretary of state, or such person 1
that department as tho president shall
designate, and a consul general
or cousul of tho United State
whom the president shall desig
nate, In conjunction with tho civil
service commissioners. This board is
to determine the scope and method o
the examination, but among tho subject
it must Include In Its tests shall bo
either tho French, German or Spanish
language. The service Is graded by tho
bill Into six classes, and from those
passing the examination the names o
the live highest shall bo submitted when
a vacancy arises, the president making
selection from this list.
Tho bill provides for 4 consuls geu
oral of the tlrst cluss, 13 of the second
class and It) of tho third class. The
consuls nre to be (17 of tho tlrst class,
a,') of tho second class, 00 of the third
10 of the fourth, ill) of the llfth and r.O
of tho sixth, the salaries ranging from
$i,000 a year down to $1,000. All fee
with the exception of those of cousular
agents, nre to bo turned into the treas
ury, consular agents receiving one-half
.their fees as compensation.. .Tho bill
laees the consular service on substan
tially the same basis as that obtaining
in the army and navy. Tho president is
mpowered to move consuls around
from place to place, as he may think
advisable, substantially the same as
ho now disposes of tho olllcers of the
army and navy.
Doubtless this measure will undergo
some modlUcatlous, but lu Its general
provisions It contemplates such u re
organization and remodeling of the con
sular service as could not fall to greatly
Improvo the service. It Is very generally
conceded by those who have given at
tention to the matter that the consular
service Is now In the main elllclent. A
majority of those engaged in It are capa
ble, diligent and faithful men. Hut as
was said by President Hoosevelt In his
message, "a standard of excellence can
not be permanently maintained until
the principles set forth lu the bills here
tofore submitted to congress on this sub
ject are enacted into law." The great
Interest being manifested by the com
mercial bodies of the country In this
ubject should secure the desired legis
lation,
A CAXAl, CUMPL.IVAT10A'.
What is known as tho Maritime Canal
company, organized uutier tne laws oi
New Jersey, is threatening to further
complicate tho NIearugun canal project
This company claims to have purchased
tho route surveyed und recommended by
the canal commission and alleges that
all franchises nnd concessions have been
conveyed to It by tho government of
Nicaragua in consideration of a large
sum of money. That government, it
appears, has admitted tne sine oi minis
to the company and the granting of
rauclilses and concessions, but has
stated to our government that the sale
had been annulled and the franchises
evoked since it was made public that
lie Nicaragua route had been selected
by the commission. The Maritime com
puny protested against this action, pre
sentlng its protest to the Department of
State.
It is stated that Secretary hay has
leclded not to consider the claims of
tho company, but to regard the action
of Nicaragua as olllclal and dual, and
upon the suggestion of the secretary of
state the senate committee on Inter
oceanic canals has decided to pay no
attention to the claim of the Maritime
company and will proceed with the bill
which It has reported providing for tho
construction of a canal. How this sum
mary way of dealing1 with the matter
will be regarded by the .Maritime com
pany remains to be seen, but If It be true,
as stated by the company, that It has ex
ponded $1,700,000 for lands ami fran
chlscs It Is not to be expected that It
will make no effort to recover tills. The
State department lias recommended that
the company be paid for the lands held
by It, which according to the Nlcaraguan
government cost about $100,000, but It
is questionable whether the company
will be satlsilcd with such an arnuige-
incut, which would return to it but one
seventeenth of the money It claims
to have expended.
It Is not apprehended that this new
complication will delay canal legislation,
but It may Interfere with the beginning
of construction unless congress or the
government of Nicaragua shall make a
fair settlement with the Maritime Canal
company.

That bill Introduced by Congressman
Mercer for tho construction of u bridge at
South Omaha, according to tho press dls
patches, Is a matter of speculation. General
Munager Kenyon of tho Stock Yards com
pany haa wired Mr. Mercer for a copy ot tbo
bill, for, as a matter of fact, no ono here
knows what It means. Moreover, If tho gov
ernment or nnybody else Is to build a bridge
across tho Missouri at this point It is very
probablo that tho Pontoon Bridge and Ferry
company wuuld havo to bo "seen" on tho
proposition, Inasmuch as that company has
some rights and privileges, especially on
tho othor side. However, everybody, It 1
snfo to Bay, hopes that congress or some
body clso will eventually construct a bridge
at this point. World-Herald.
For once we fully agree with our eu
tcrprlslug contemporary. The South
Omaha bridge bill Introduced by Con
gressman Mercer Is apparently "a mat
tor of speculation." Tho inspiration for
tho proposed motor bridge may not em
anate from the managers of the Pontoon
Hrldge and Ferry company or from the
general manager of the stock yards. It
Is purely "a mntter of speculation," but
could, If It passed congress, be annexed
to the multiplex air line system of su
burlmn roads projected by Congressman
Mercer's chief fugleman.
In these days of Industrial evolution
there is a good deal more money In
handling electric motor franchises nnd
bridge construction privileges than there
Is lu selling town lots and farm lands,
A COXD1T10XSUT A THEORY.
The taxpayers of Omaha are con
fronted by a most serious situation. Tho
enormous Increase lu taxation within
the past llvo years has made the burdens
of local government almost unbearable
On an assessment presumed to represent
10 per cent of nctuul value the tax levy
for this city and school district aggre
gated '-'." mills in 1801), was Increased to
L'S mills lu 1000 and In 1001 It was raised
to !I4 mills under pretense that the lu
creased revenue would bo applied to tho
payment of the dellclt then existing I
the school fund.
Now it trausnlrcB that this dellclt not
only was not wiped out, but it has been
enormously Increased. Unless a ver,
material Increase lu the nggregate as
sessment of property in Omaha can bo
made tho city tax for 1001! will not fall
below UO mills and may have to be
raised to 10 mills. Tho lowest posslbl
estimate for city and county tax for
100- will aggregate tl icr cent, excluslv
of special taxes levied for Improve
mcnts. This means a tax of from - to
-!! per cent on the nctuul cash value o
every foot of ground and every building
within the city limits to maintain the
city anil county government for ono
year.
With Mich tnxes staring them in the
face capitalists who have money to In
vest are not likely to venture Into the
purchase of Omaha realty. The .(pies
tlon that presses for Immediate consii
erntiou Is, What can bo dono to avert
thin meuueo to tho growth and prosper
lty of .Omnha? There are only two
ways to bring nbotit a reduction In the
levy: One Is by Increasing the aggre
gate assessment, and the other is by
decreasing the aggregate expenses.
The first can be done only by rnlslng
the assessments on individuals nnd cor
porations who have hitherto managed
to keep their assets .covered or who
have been specially favored In the mat
ter of valuation. The other can only bo
accomplished by radical retrenchment
in all brandies of the public service.
There is some merit In the claim of
the gas company that tho annual roy-
lty paid by It of 5 per cent on Its gross
receipts Is in the nature of a payment
for the franchise that gives it a practi
cal monopoly for furnishing gas for
lighting und heating purposes to the cit
izens of Omaha. Tills royalty for the
ear 1001 is said to aggregate $15,000
The payment of a bonus for the fran-
hlso does not, however, constitute an
xemptlon from taxation; It simply fur-
Ishos a basis to the assessor for reach
ing an estimate of the value of the fran
chise, Irrespective of the gas generating
and distributing plant. In other words,
while the gas company has paid for the
privilege which constitutes the franchise
tho payment in itself does not operute
as an exemption from taxation. Under
the constitution of Nebraska the fran
chises of corporations are subject to tax
ation Independent of their holdings in
realty or personal property, und tho
mere fact that the franchise has been
acquired either by purchase or by tho
payment of roynlty cannot exempt the
corporation from taxation.
The Hee still maintains that tho best
and most economical way to have af
forded temporary relief Ho the supreme
court would have been to have called
iu the district Judges to serve as ref
erees when not busy on their respective
benches, rather than through the costly
and cumbersome supreme court com
mission. Now that we have the com
missioners, however, they ought to be
superseded at the earliest possible mo
ment by additional duly constituted
Judges of the supremo court. The .court
cannot be lawfully enlarged except by
constitutional amendment. The saving
In money, to say nothing of the bene
nts or a, responsible judiciary to pass
11 tut 1 judgment upon weighty matters of
law affecting life, property and cousti
tutlonal rights, would Justify nn extra
session of the legislature to provide .for
submitting the much demanded propo
sition at the next election.
Accordlug to the World-Herald, which
s the recognized organ of tho finance
committee of the school board, the ap
parent dellclt In the school fund on .Ian
nary 1 will be $150,000 in round llgures.
Hut whut the actual dellclt bus been
during the past several years or what it
Is now is an open question. If this is
true the Commercial club coterie that
made tho big tight for Mr. Funkhouser
as a brilliant llnanclnl manager is not
In position to shower boquets upon
itself. , . ,
Tho principle, .,thut should .govern In
tho distribution of federal patronage Is
the recognition In each community of
the men who did the work that helped
bring Nebraska back.lnto the republican
column. To seek to avoid factional dif
ferences by bestowing the favors upon
some one who did nothing at all simply
demoralizes party organization .and dls
courages thoso whose active efforts arc
needed to keep the republican party lu
power.
Governor Savage wants to let the
members of the local bar make the se
lections for vacancies on the district
bench. In this the governor endorses
the home rule principle which thoso who
aro advising him to usurp tho powers
of the mayor and council over the police
commission would have him violate.

Wnun Gazette: Our friend Stuefer
should follow tho example of Admiral Schley
and demand an Investigation. His silence
on tho matter cnii havo but ono effect
furnish wind to tho sails of his ndvcrnrles.
Lets havo tho whole story, Mr. Stuefer.
York Republican: Thu temper of the peo
ple of Nebraska Is such that they will not
enduro doubtful transactions In tho manipu
lation of tho state's permanent school fund.
Two deals, wherein several thousands of
dollars havo been realized by speculators,
havo been ventilated. It may be, as tho
treasurer says, that ho had to buy tho
bonds lu tho markot, but tho question Is.
Why wero they paid for by tho speculators
with Treasurer Stuefer's checks? Dettcr al
low soma of tho funds to remain idle than
to Invest them by methods that certainly
warrant suspicion. It would bo wlso for
tho state of Nebraska to pay a big man
a big salary to look after tho Immense
Interests In the treasurer's ofllec.
St. Paul Republican: It Is now up to Tho
Omaha Heo to say that tho Investigation
and report of the olllcers who checked up
tho state treasurer In the matter of thu
school funds Is wrong. It Is either that
or an acknowledgment that Tho lire Is
wrong. Mlndea Gazette.
Don't quibble, Jeff. It Isn't worth while.
You know nn well ns nnyono that tho In
vestigation mado hy tho stato officers and
tho report of the stnto treasurer himself
havo nothing to do with Tho Hoe's chnrges.
Tho Republican defended Mr. Stuefer dur
ing tho campaign upon tho ground that ho
Is not permitted hy tho law to plaro tho
trust funds In depository hanks and that
ho could legally report them only as a
"balanco on hand." Tho charges mado In
this connection hy tho fusion organs havo
been refuted by tho Investigation. Hut Tho
Hoe's charges have not been dlsproven, nor
hns any attempt nt Investigation been
made, if Mr. Stuefer Is guiltless tho best
thing he can do Is to demnnd a searching
olllclal examination of tho Hurt, Cuming
nnd Otoo county bond deals: If guilty, ho
has only to continue tho rolo ot tho In
jured Innocent to convlnco his best friends
of tho fact.
Stanton Picket: Tho report mado and
given to tho prrcs by Treasurer Stuefer last
week was all right so far ns It related to
tho stato school fund. It shows that there
Is at tho present time but a trlllo moro
than $18,000 of the school money uninvested.
This balance Is, or was at the time, In tho
stato treasury. This is certainly a good
showing so far ns it relates to tho amount
of money Invested. Hut there was nothing
In tho Htntcment which places Mr. Stuefer
In a better light as regards tho charges
that wero mado against him. No Intimation
has ever been mado by nnyono that his
books were not properly kept or that ho Is
short In any of his accounts. The charge
mado against htm Is that he has conspired
with a close business associate to purchase
county bonds and then turn them Into the
stato school fund nt a handsome profit und
nt tho expense either of the said fund or
of tho counties Issuing them. Thu charges
were strongly mndo and It seemed to most
peoplo that Mr. Stuefer has thus far mado
only n trail attempt to disprove them, as
having so attempted hns signally failed. If
ho has nothing moro to offer, nnd with tho
cvldenca Implicating him In tho nllalr tin
rebutted, wo cannot do otherwise thnn bo
llove that he, to say tbo least, willfully as
sisted Mr. Nollgh to milk thu stato school
fund. It Is n rnso which admits of no
whitewashing, nnd If Mr. Stuefor Is Innocent
of any such offense as Is charged it does
appear to us that It ought to bo no very ditll
cult matter to make n showing In thu mat
ter which would bo plain and satisfactory
to his constituents. Until ho does so no
amount of lottor writing or newspaper clip
pings can cbango our views of his actions or
our attltudu thereto. Wo aro sorry that
appearances seem to convict hlra of wrong
doing ns they do nnd feel that if he has tiny

Tor souio time past speeches of senators
havo been businesslike, with little attempt n
oratorical flights. A letter to the New York

thu new senators nre "two capable, of mold
ing and uttering eloquent perorations
Dnlley, thu beautiful, from tho Louo Star
state, and lltirton from Kansas. An an

Invariably filled tho galleries of tho house,
nnd n devoted following hung breathless

his ambition ho took for a model and to
whom ho has nlways been faithful, llcforc
ho left tho other aide of tho capltol Mr.
H.Uley threatened to 'stir up' things In his
new sphere, but n new senator must bldo
his time. Like n freshman at college, ho
requires discipline nnd Is not encouraged to
assort himself. No matter, therefore, what
his Intentions, how ardently ho hopes to

years. Indeed, ho has frankly worked for
tho nomination, nnd six years ago was de

A few days ngo Senntnr Cullom of Illinois
wns credited with remarking upon tho vo
ulfrrnusuebs of President Hoosevelt, who, ns
Is well known, does n6t hesitate to speak
loudly whllo holding conferences with his
visitors.
Yesterday morning, rclntes tho Washing
ton Post, Mr. Cullom went to tho White
Housa. As soon us ho iippuarcd In thu presi
dent's reception room tho president saw
him and walked over to him. With much
solemnity Mr. Cullom took Mr. Roosevelt
over Into a corner of tho room and whis
pered Inaudlbly Into hU ear for fully llvo
minutes. Tho president listened with Binn
ing countenance.
"All right, senator," ho said In n loud
voice whon Mr. Cullom had finally concluded
his confidential communication, "nobody
shall ever hear what I Bay to you In the
future."
"Hut how about this particular matter?"
queried tho anxious senator.
The president put his linger to his Hps.
"Sh-u-u-h!" ho whispered, "not a word!
Somebody might hear us."
And so tho senator went nwny. Ho does
not know yet what tho president might havo
said.
"I notice In coming from tho weBt to
tho east that the farther I travel tho

Interviewer. "Out where I llvo ono doosn't

you glvo a dealer a ten-dollar bill out of

nnd haven't had a silver dollar given mo In

that thcro nro n largo number or govern-

"This reminds mo of tho peculiar b-b-torn
of tho westerners have of paying for

Boda wntcr, or nnythlng that doesn't cost

tho westerners always carry their hllver

taken a drink nt a bar ho will dive down
Into his pocket nnd pull out a whole hand
ful of silver dollurs, half dollurs, dimes
und nickels, tho amount varying from flvo
to fifteen or twenty dollars. Ho pours an
this out on tho bar nnd spreads it out ns
n man does In counting money. Tho bar
tender selects whnt ho wants for tho drinks
nnd tho mirchnser sweeps the money off tho

I suppose from tho fact that tho westerner

It Is a frequent habit of the morallRts,
as well ns of soclologlcol Btudents, to sigh
for the "good old times" nnd to compare
tho morals nnd mnnncrs of tho present
day with thoso of the days of our grand
fathers nnd grnndmothers. Tho smart
ness and faatness nnd boldness of modern
society moru than onco havo furnished
thomes for pnotB and essayists ns woll as
for tho pulpit and havo boon placed In
contrast with tho modesty nnd dignity and
propriety of thoso old days so often, In
fact, that wo hnvo como to regard our
forbears as patterns of exemplary conduct.
It Is refreshing, however, now and then
to find testimony thnt somo of tho grand
mothers wcro no bettor thnn somo of their
descendants. Testimony of this sort Ih
contained In a letter which was sold lu
on autograph aalo in Now York. tho other
dny. It wns written nt London In 177S by
Sophia Montague, wifo of tho English ad
miral who commanded on tho North Amer
ican station. Lady Mnntaguo had loon to
a supper 'nnd with feminlno frankness and
enthusiasm describes It to n friend.
It waB tho best supper she ever "aupt
nt." Kvorynno was drunk, "on my con
science," but sho did not conBldor that
any matter, "for wo wero good company."
Then Lady Sophia gives a description of
London women In general. "Thoy turn
day Into night and night Into day" and
aro "as mad ns March hare." Sho thinks
their dress Is preposterous. They "paint
and pinch their bodies In tight stays till
they sink, for to bo very small at bottom
and hanging over at top Is qulto tho
fashion." No natural color Ib another fash
ion nnd "feathers fifteen IncheB long In
tho head" Is another. Lady Sophia's letter
closes with this sweeping lndlctmont ot
social life: "Inconstancy, tho fashion;
separation, tho fashion; to bo with any
body but your husband, at tho top ot tho
fashion."
Familiar aa It all sounds, this Is not a
Iplcturo of society In 1901, but In 1775,
time to which wo nro referred so often
for social practices which should bo Imi
tated by society today. Wcro tho old
times any better than tho new times''
Were they as good? Thoso who abuso
modern manners nnd society must go ha. k
of 1775 to llnd their "good old days." Hut
they cannot find them this sldo of the fall
of man and the banishment from tho Gar

Thero Ib no death! Tho stars go down
To rlHo upon somo other shore,
Andbright In heaven's Jowuled crown
They shlno for uvormore.
Thero Is no death! Tho forest leaves
Convert to life tho viewless ulr;
Tho rocks illsorgunlza to fend
Tho hungry moss they bear.
Thero Is no death! Tho dust wo tread
Shall change, beneath tho summer ahow
ITS,
To golden grain, or mellowed fruit,
Or rultibow-tlntL'd Mowers.
Thoro Ib no death! Tho leaves may fall
And (lowers may din and pass awny;
They only wait, through wintry hours,
Tho warm, sweet breath of May.
There Is no death! Tho choicest gifts
That heaven hath kindly lent to earth
Are ever Ilrst to seek ngaln
Tho country of their birth.
And all things that for growth or Joy
Aro worthy of our lovo or care,
Whoso loss has left us desolate,
Are safely garnered thero.
Though llfo becomo a desert waste,
We know Its fairest, sw-cctcHt (lowers,
Tiansidanted Into Paradise,
Adorn Immortal bowers.
Tho volco of blrdllkn molndy
That we havo inls'Md and mourned so lonjr
Now mingles with tho angel choir
In everlasting song.
Thero Is no death! Although wo grieve
When beautiful, familiar forms
That wo havo loarnodvlo lovo are torn
From our embracing arms
Although with bowed and breaking heart,
With sable garb nnd silent tread,
Wo bear their senseless dust to rest,
And say that they uro "dead."
Thuy are not dead! They hnvo but passed
lliiyoiid tho mists that blind us hero,
Into tho now and larger llfo
Of that sercnor sphere,
Thoy have but ilroppod their tobn of clay
To put their shining rulmont nn;
They have rot wandered far away
Thuy uro not "lost" nor "goau."
Though disenthralled and glorified,
Thoy still aro hero and lovo us yet;
The dear ones they havo left boh! nil
They nover can forgot.
And sometimes whon our honrts grow faint
Amid temptations flereo und deep,
Or when tho wildly raging waves
Of grief or pusulnn swuep,
Wn feel upon our fevered brow
Tlnir gentle touch, their breath of balm
Their arms infold us. and our honrts
Urow comforted and culm,
And over near ua, though unnenn,
Tho denr, lmpiortal spirits tread
For all tho boundless unWorno
Is Life thcro are no dead I
