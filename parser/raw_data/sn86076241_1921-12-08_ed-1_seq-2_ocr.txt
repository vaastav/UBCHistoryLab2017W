HARDING ALL BIGHT, BUT
President Harding's last message to congress, read by himself,
is another one of those pretty speeches for which the chief executive
has become famous, but sifted down to its final analysis it was just
words and soft phrases, just as all his previous ones have been. He
talked revenue, taxes, tariff, rehabilitation for the soldier, reclama
tion, irrigation, foreign affairs, disarmament, the return of troops
from Europe, and so many other things that it taxes memory to put
them all down.
Were all the matters he talked of taken up and pushed to con
clusion there would be some great accomplishments, but there is no
possibility of such action. It would not agree at all with the program
that has been slated by the interests who put him into office or are
responsible for the Republican victory of a year ago. That bunch -is
out for the dollars, pure and simple, and nothing that presents the
human element attracts their attention or effort.
Harding can talk to his heart's content and suggest all mantfer
of things that make for the awakening of the American conscience
or to instill a desire in the people's hearts to correct the abuses that
have gained such ascendancy, but in the end it all comes down to
what the "interests" will permit. They are in the saddle and with
them the road leads to the point where the "almighty dollar" blazes
the way.
THE COUNTRY IS TO BLAME
An ex-service man writing to one of the eastern papers complains
of the treatment the returned soldiers have received and gives that
as a reason for the suicide of Colonel "Whittlesey of the "Lost Bat
talion." And in a manner is he not right? Of that officer and his
death the former service man writes :
The newspaper headlines declare Colonel Whittlesey a suicide. I
take issue with such declarations, Mr. Editor. Colonel Whittlesey is
not a suicide, but just another grkf-stricken and heart-broken soldier.
He saw men whom he learned to love give their last full measure of de
votion willingly that their country's honor and ideals might be upheld.
He lived to see their memory aspersed by an accredited representative
at London and their victory a victory for humanity rendered nought by
a separate treaty with the enemy. No Colonel Whittlesey is no suicide.
He is another sacrifice to American political selfishness.
When a soldier's own country turns the lie upon everything he
fought for after backing him up to the limit he is still the hero when
he dies heartbroken. The American people are, the suicides. They
the traitors, and every white cross in France mocks them.

THE SCAVENGERS
Dr. Frank Crane, in Current Opinion
The ttniverse is a thing of life. Life means growth, and growth
means constant change.
And in the processes of life the destroyers are as necessary as
the builders.
Long ago it was written, "Thou fool, that which thou so west is
not quicked, except it die."
Death, decay and removal are as essential to the operation of
growth as birth and sustenance. 1
"With this fact in mind, we perceive that decomposition is just
as pure as growth.
- The disgusting carrion that rots by the roadside offends us.
Nature makes it offensive because she wishes to keep us away from it.
That is, she is building, and in decomposition she is carrying on her
business of wreckage and she does not want us to meddle.
But the buzzards and worms that clean up the world are just as
important as the song birds and fruits that feed the world.
Death is as clean as birth.
And the removal of waste is quite as necessary as the procuring
of food. In fact, most of our diseases come from interference with
the sewage system.
It is the same way in the intellectual life. The pessimists, the
deniers, the doubters and the scorners might be called the kidneys tf
the social organism.
Also a man's failures are as useful in rounding out his life as his
successes. Our chagrins, disappointments and disillusions are as sani
tary to the soul as our joys and loves.
A life of perfect bliss and Tinhalting success is not only not nor
mal, but it would be distinctly abnormal.
That is why we are ortenaea by those whose natures are a con
tinual blaze of sunshine and have no redeeming shadows.
"We are not put in this world to be happy. We are put here to be
great. And suffering nd failure are the meat upon which greatness
feeds. Nobleness of character, the glow of genius and the beauty of
holiness are but the light trom souls that are burning.
"This earth," says Anatole France, "is but a grain of sand. in
the infinite desert of worlds, but if only upon this planet suffering
exists, it is greater than all the rest put together. What do I say!
It is all ; the rest are nothing.
Thousands of houses must be wrecked and taken to the rubbish
head before the city becomes beautiful.
Billions of insects and microbes are constantly at work remov
ing the debris of the human race, keeping the earth fertile, the
streams clean and the waters pure.
In every society, customs grow rank and pernicious and institu
tions become old and sceptic, and the army of wreckers must remove
them.
The progress of the world is marked by its Calvaries.
The path of the Golden Age is strewn with revolutions and vio
lence. And in the individual soul the perfection of character and the
right apprehension of ourselves and of the universe depends tipon a
continual demolition of old huts of belief and discarded enthusiasms
that have become insanitary.
