SUMMARY OF ST. LOUIS MARKETS.
Only a few of the outsiders were left In the market yesterday and speculation was
mainly In the hands of professionals. There was little Inside support and prices were per
mitted to sag under the pressure of profit-taking and scalping operations. Weather condi
tions -were bearish, notably the report of the Cincinnati Price Current, which Indicated
that the condition of the growing crop was much better than when the last previous esti
mate was made. Receipts at St. Louis were light, but the movement to primary points
was brisk. An element of uncertainty was added by the fact that severe coast storms pre
vented the transmission of quotations on the Liverpool market.
All Brains were weak In other Kuropean markets". Wheat was strong at thi opening,
but declined rapidly on heavy selling.
May wheat opened "c up and closed rc off.
May- corn opened l-lc up and closed ?iflc off.
May oats opened He oft and closed Ho off.
In the produce market potatoes and cabbage were Arm and fruits and vegetables gen
erally steady, with only a fair demand.
Local stocks and bonds worked lower because of lack of buying support. Tractions
closed weak, despite heavy buying of Transit on the down-turn. Bank and trust company
stocks were in light demand.
Yesterday's bank clearings were J3,W1.C0. balances OSSXO.
Discount rates were tlrm between 4?i and Z- per cent.
The local market for spot cotton was l-16c higher.

Sellers gained control of tho local grain
market yesterday and there was an all
around slump In values under heavy liqui
dation pressure. Not all conditions govern
ing prices were so purely speculative as at
the previous session. Traders paid more
attention to legitimate indications which
were mainly bearish. Foreign markets, al
ways more ready to respond to a decline
than to an advance, were generally lower at
tha opening. Receipts of wheat at primary
points were extremely heavy, but St. Louis
got less than on the corresponding day last
year. The Cincinnati Trice Current report
that the fall planted crop had been bene
fited by recent rains was one of the bear
cards. Snow was reported in Iowa, Ne
braska. South Dakota and Southern Min
nesota. As an onset there were advices
that the crop In the Argentine would be
short, and that the movement of spring
wheat as falling off, but these statements
had only temporary weight. The market
was nervous from start to finish, but profit
takers and -scalpers were In control when
the gong sounded. May wheat opened Ji.c

the arrival of Liverpool cables, but
the weak tone in the London markot was
thought to reflect tho condition at other

XATIVE CATTLE Beef Steers The supply ot
tratlte rattle wa- -.ery fair and the proportion of
beef steers faltiy liberal. The quality ran from
plain short fed steers to finished export stecra
that topped the market at $723. Exceptional
cases or the very best steers were not matertaliy
chacged from w rdnes.Iay. but the volume of this
business was so small that it mt no figure In the
general trade. On the bulk of the steers Irom
$4.10 un to $3.73 trade was slow and again lower.
The decline for the week on this range amounts
to 23i4)c with some quotations hardly so mucn
and others reported more in extreme instances.
The tendency of tbe general busine. wa to
ward extreme dullness and it was difficult to
effect a clearance on anything lacking finish.

HORSES The run ot hor.es during the wec
,, Boutin uu uuuauai proportions, it nas reen
"ry moderate, and of about the same oIume
f the week before. There has been no marked
or decided change In the trade. A fairly good
bouthern demand has preval.ed. re-enforced by
some Inquiry for good sound thin feeders, but
the buyers have maintained a consenatKe posi
tion, and the best that the market has don? Is
to average steady with last week. The Eastern
contingent bought a fair number of chunks and
big horses at practically steady price-, but the
market on good drivers and hame"s horses has
been slow on account of the scarcity of the lat
ter. Oulte a few medium to good dri-ers sold to
go to th South. For the time being the act!, itv
in British hor.es is cenfined to a very small
olum", as dealers have culte a number of the
class on hand and are waltinr an Inspection.
Summed up in few wcrds. the market has gained
little oer the preceding week.

MULES The mule ,-iarket of th wek has
contained no new features, ard has wcrried along
In much the same position as the two weeks be
fore. There still exists that small volume of de
mand from the Sjuth. which has been character
istic of the market since the virtual opening of
the Southern reason in September, which rules
with slight promie of there being any improve
ment until after the holidays. True, some few
more carloads than last week were bought and
dispotched tn Southern points, but the dimen
sions of trade are slid of a restricteil nature,
end there has been not enough actlvty to caue
prices to react from the much lower basis which
they hae gradually assumed from week to week.
The trade as concerns prices ha. been verv little
clargtd: perhaps It has been a little firmer by
recton of the limited supplies. Some consign
ment, were also bought to. to to the I"---t. but
the total did nt exceed half a dozen. The move
ment In the commlsion department has been
a little more active than the week before, es
pecially en the rrime. ftt. cotton mule..
