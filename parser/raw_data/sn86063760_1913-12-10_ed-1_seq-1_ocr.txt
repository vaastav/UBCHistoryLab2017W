A BRUTAL MURDER
PROMINENT MERCHANT OF BARN
fELL SHOT DOWN
NEIROES 10 KILUNi
The Cold-Blooded Murder, Which
Was Committed e- 4"ne of the
Princpai Streets i "'uo Town, and
the Negroes Who Did it Are in
Jail.
Mr. E. Peyton Best, a well known
merchant of Barnwell, was shot and
almost instantly killed there Wednes
day night between nine and ten f
o'clock while on his way home from
his store. The shooting was done on
Wall Street, only some fifty yards
from Mr. Best's grocery store, which
Is in sight of the court house. Two
shots were fired, only one of which
took effect. The bullet entered the
back and passed through the body
near the heart, the wounded man
dying In two minutes after he was
shot.
The shots were fired at 9:10
*'elock. Mr. Best had been to a e
restaurant for supper and was walk- 0
Ing up the street when two shots
were fired. Vince Dunbar and Ar- s
thur Harden were standing In the
door of a pool room, a few yards
away, and toward them the wounded
man staggered, excla4ming: "Oh, s
Lord, boys, I'm shot. As he fell,
Mr. Harden caught hWr ind he was
carried into the pool to, n where he
died in two minutes.
.Officers at once beg... a hunt for
the man or men who fired the shots,
and soon'between fifteen and twenty
negroes were arrested as suspects. p
After the wholesale round-up of sus
pects another negro was brought in
and placed in jail. It is said that
against this negro strong circumstan
tial evidence is directed.
It Is believed that the shots came
from a crowd of negroes standing 1
behind Mr. Best. It Is said that Mr. u
Best had been jostled by negroes on
the streets as he passed them, and
that trouble had then been narrowly
averted. A negro is said to have 0
drawn a revolver and three times at- s
tempted to fire at Mr. Best, the wea
pon missing fire each time. This oc- d
currence imakes It certain that the n
fatal shot was fired by some negro
in this gang. 7
Barnwell was greatly excited over
the brutal killing of one of her prin
cipal merchants, on one of the most t
public streets, and no efforts will be t
spored to run the gang down who
committed the foul, diabolical mur
der. Mr. Best was thfri--six years
of age and a native ce Barnwell
county. He leaves a V150 and five t]
small children. Mrs. Bet was pros
trated when the news reached her of
the brutal murder of her husband.
There Is no doubt but that the foul
deed was done by a bad negro.*
Three Negroes Did Crime.
The coroner's jury, after a full In- c
vestigation of the murder, rendered a
verdict that Mr. Best "came to his ~
death from gunshot wounds In the ~
hands of Scott Madison, and that ~
Mitchell Stroy and Gilbert Miller ~
were accessories before and after the I
fact". Fearing tha' the prisoners C
would be lynched If allowed to re
main in the county jail. Sheriff 3. B. a
Morris and a deputy took the accused a
men to Columbia, having left Barn- r
well about noon Thursday in an au- C
tomobile. There was some talk at #
Barnwell Thursday, It is said, about 3~
a proposed lynching bee, and hearing '
of this the governor instructed the I
captain of the local militia to assem-T
ble his men and "do what Is neces- C
sary to preserve the peace" of Barn- I
well. -
From the testimony ttrought out at I
the inquest the murdec 'f Mr. Best
Is one of the most cold-blooded that
has ever darkened the pages of crim
inal history of Barnwell county.
There was absolutely no provocation, '
it seems, other than that Mr. Best
had pushed one of the negroes out of
his way as he was leaving the res
taurant where he had .been for sup- E
per. This negro, Gilbert Miller, It 2
was testified, threw an empty bottle 3
at Mr. Best and then ran. Mr. Best 'J
turned around to Scott Madison. s
who was standing In front of the res- c
taurant and asked what he meant by i
hitting him. Madison replied that t
he did not hit him-that the man 1
that threw the bottle had run off. 1
Mr. Best replied that he was nott
hurt, and turning around, start- 2
ed off up the street In the directiont
of his store. He had gone only a few
steps and was in the full glare of ant
electric light, when two shots were
fired. One took effect in his back
near the heart, and passed entirely
through the body. The other shot
went wild. Mr. Best staggered to the
open door, of Kearse' -ol room anda
fell, dying In the arms Ct Mr. Arthur
Harden. The excitsmyd: Wednesday
night was Intense 'azx there is no
doubt that the negroec would have
been lynched had thcw been caught
shortly after the kill5-'
The arrest of the e ,aused men, all
of whom are negroes - iployed by the
Atlantic Coast Line railroad com
pany as section haul- and who are~
strangers in the couif.,, followed an
all night Investigation and a very
pretty piece of detective work on the
part of the sheriff and his assistants.1
When It seemed that the search
would prove fruitless, a few clues
were gathered and working on these
the negroes were routed out from 1
their shanty cars during the night. j
A rigid examination indicated thatl
one or more of them were involved
In the deplorable affair and at day
ifght Thursday morning they were
lodged In the county jail along with
a score of other negroes who had
been arrested as suspects shortly
after the murder and who are now
helng held ma witnesses.
BLEASE TO THE RESCUE
)RDERS THE MMIITIA TO PRO.
TECT THE NEGROES.
Who Were in ,Tail Charged With the
Brutal Murder of Mr. E. P. Besl
at Barnwell.
The cold-blooded murder of Mr. E
?. Best, at Barnwell on Wednesday
Light while walking along one of the
irincipal streets of that town, caused
;reat excitement, and had the ne
;roes been caught who murdered
Ir. Best they would have fared bad
y. The coroner's jury held Scott
dadison, colored, as principal and
ditchell Story and Gilbert Parker,
6lso negroes, for the killing. They
vere carried to the State penitentiary
or safe keeping on Thursday night.
'hey had been confined in the Barn
rell jail all day Thursday.
Acting on long distance telephone
all from Senator Patterson Thurs
lay morning to the effect that from
he ominous air pervading a crowd of
Letermined white men, which were
athering, a lynching of negroes was
eared, Governor Blease ordered the
allitary company at Barnwell under
rms and told Sheriff Morris to call
ut a posse comitatus and swear in
xtra deputies to preserve peace and
>rder and to prevent any bloodshed
a Barnwell, as a result of the whole
ale arrest of negro suspects follow
ag the shooting down of Mr. E. P.
est.
Here is the governor's order: "As
emble your company and do what is
ecessary to preserve the peace
here," was the teelegram sent to
!apt. Emile Harley, of the Barnwell
illitary company, Thursday morning
y Governor Blease. To Sheriff J. B.
[orris he telegraphed: "Use every
ffort at your command, call out
osse comitatus, swear in extra depu
es and do everything to preserve
eace and order there. I warn you
ot to fail in the discharge of your
uties."
The governor asked Mr. Charles
arroll Simms at Barnwell to use his
ifluence to preserve order. "Please
se your influence to preserve order
nd to see that the law is vindicated,"
ras the wire which went to Mr.
Imms. The military company was
rdered out to guard the Jail and pre
arve order and Sheriff Morris was
istructed to swear in any amount of
eputies to reinforce the military if
ecessary.
The city was intensely excited and
'hursday morning white men gather
ig in the streets in front of the jail,
ith determined looks on their facer
ad with a sullen anger pervading
ie crowd, led some citizens to fear
iat an attempt would be made to
inch the suspects. This is the infor
ation which Governor Blease got
mom Senator Patterson over the long
Istance telephone, it being stated
iat it was feared that forty negroes
ould be lynched.
Late Thursday afternoon the town
1as quiet and the military com
any was not needed. Sheriff Morris
as everything in hand and the
rowds have all dispersed. Mr. Best
'as a popular merchant and citizen
nd much sympathy is felt for his
!idow and little children. His as
assination aroused the citizens to
ury and it is said that only the cool
ess and self-control of the yeomanry
f Barnwell averted trouble.
Knowing the intense feeling
gainst the accused it was decided at
meeting of the bar, Thursday
iorning to request immediate trial,
ourt now being in session. The
rand jury will be summoned to meet
onday and as H. A. Simms, Esq.,
ho, with Thomas M. Boulware, Esq.,
as been appointed to defend the
egroes, stated that the usual three
ays would be waived. It is very
nmediately after the finding of the
robable that the case will be called

HUERTA' OUTLOOK
HOW THE MEXICANS VIEW HHE
LATE HAPPENINGS
LOANS TO BE FORCED
President Wilson's Message Arouses
Considerable Interest In Mexico
Conviction in Mexican Capital That
Neither Intervention Nor Lifting
Embargo Would be Urged.
While most of the latest dispatches
from Mexico are full of hope for the
Constitutionalists and express the
view that they are about to triumph,
it will be interesting to read a dis
patch from Mexico City giving the
Federal side of these recent develop
ments. Friends of Gen. Huerta point
out why he is still able to keep an
army in the field, although unsuc
cessful in obtaining foreign loans.
Indiscriminate seizure of property
and excessive taxation are the two
means by which the privisional presi
dent hopes to overcome the ill effects
of President Wilson's financial block
ade, and thus to continue a dogged
and effective resistance to the ad
vance of the Constitutionalists. The
following dispatch was sent out from
Mexico City on the day President
Wilson's message was expected to go
to Congress. It gives a brilliant pic
ture of Mexican internal affairs as
they are to-day, in the midst of war
and rebellion:
"The possible treatment of the
Mexican question by President Wil
son's coming message has aroused
considerable interest among Mexican
government officials, but there is a
notable absence of alarm because of
the deep-rooted conviction that neith
er intervention nor the supplying of
arms and ammunition to the rebels
will be raised. The continuation of
the financial blockade will not be re
garded by President Huerta as a vital
blow to his administration, however
enfeebling it may be. Anything short
of intervention or the supplying of
munitions of war to the rebels will
be regarded with comparative com
placency by the general who is pre
pared to pursue a dogged course of
resistance against his enemies, al
though he realizes it means indefinite
war.
"But his friends point out that,
although the government may be
bankrupt the provisional president is
far from being without funds, and is
not likely to be entirely without
money as long as private institutions
and corporations possess funds. They
are of the opinion that the president
will not fail, for the sake of what he
considers right, to resort to forced
loans. Indeed, persuasive methods
already have been used and in sev
eral cases have borne marked simi
larity to the forced loans.
"In the meantime there are many
men rated as millionaires and several
large corporations whose properties
might be available for protective tax
ation. There are millions to be had
for the taking, and Huerta's admir
ers, declare he will be acting in ac
cordance with justice and his duty to
the country if he utilizes this money
for defense. Special taxes have been
announced, which will become effec
tive immediately, and will net at least
35,000,000 pesos ($17,500,000), an
nually to the government. It would
be quite feasible, it is pointed out to
augment this amount materially by
the simple method of still further in
creasing the taxes. No avenue which
might produce funds for the govern
ment is being overlooked.
"For years the City Mexico was
known as a city where gambling was
greatly restricted, but to-day there
are many resorts of this class operat
ing openly, and each is paying its
quota in the shape of license fees. It
is announced that all these gambling
places will be close-1 temporarily, in
order that they may be reopened un
der a new arrangement. It is under
stood that this arrangement will be
granting of a concession to one con
cern for all the gambling in the city.
This would make the collection of
the tax more simple and certain.
"The confirmation is available of
the recent report that the govern
ment has obtained a 7,000,000 pesos
loan, nor is there evidence of any
marked optimism that further for
eign loans will be obtained. The
banks will stand as the hope for
small loans from time to time.
"The military situation through
out country has shown no improve
ment in the last week so far as the
government is concerned, and there
are slight indications that much pro
gress will be made the coming week.
Steps have been taken to strengthen
the garri-son at Tampico, but there is
known to be a greater force of rebels
to the North and West. Whether
this force will move finally towards
the coast or above Monterey is prob
lematical. Operations in Michoacahi
and other regions farther South have
been about eyualized as between the
Constitutionalists and the Federals.
The situation in the North. it is con
ceded, is practically dominated by the
rebels, although the government still
expresses hope of being able to re
capture Juarez.
"Exactly what is going on through
out the republic it is impossible to
ascertain, because of lack of confir
mation and rigorous military censor
ship at places where the telegraph
wires still are being operated. There
is now being published in the capital
almost no news affecting the political
and military situation except that
which emanates from the govern
ment department. No censorship has
been placed on newspaper rispatches
out of Mexico, but it is reliably re
ported that such a step is being con
sidered."
The Democrats should rush the
currency bill through so as the coun
try wmill rindwn to business.
MARCHING ON CAPITOL
MEXICAN FEDERALS GATHERIN(
FOR ADVANCE MOVE.
General Villa Enters City at Head o
Victorious Army From Which H4
Fled Nineteen Yeers Ago.
Fifty-five hundred Mexican rebels
forming the nucleus of the arm:
which the rebel leader, Gen. Francis
co Villa says he will lead to Mexic<
City to overthrow the Huerta dicta
torship, were ready to enter Chihua
hua, the State capitol, Thursda
night. It is in this town that Villa
now in supreme command of the mil.
itary forces of the revolution, said hi
would gather about him 10,000 mer
to start south by way of Torreon an
Zacatecas to Mexico City. The re
port that Zacatecas. with 30,00(
population, the capital of a rich min
ing district, already was being at
tacked, indicated that the rebels t<
the south were in great numbers.
Scattered bands of rebels, ranglnj
each from a few hundred to severa
thousand, are to be impressed int<
the main army, according to Vjlla',
plan to have at least 20,000 met
when he reaches the high' plateat
leading to the capital of the republic
Already equipped with machin
guns, artillery and millions of roundf
of ammunition, Villa said he nc
longer was hampered by inability tc
get arms from foreign sources, bui
could readily obtain them from the
federals, who are reported in the fei
remaining northern strongholds tc
be ready to evacuate. The defeat ol
the federals in their retredt from
Juarez is known to have placed greal
quantities of arms In the hands 01
the rebels.
The rebel adv!ces were that-Fred
erico Moye, civil governor of Chihua
hua, had made elaborate prepara
tions for the reception of Villa, hav
ing put in gala state the palace where
Villa will now command, and that
Villa probably would occupy a home
vacated by one of the millionaire
Terrazas family.
It was from Chihuanua that Villa,
19 years ago, adopted the career of
a bandit because he was ordered ar
rested on a charge of having killed
an army officer. When he arrives
there not only Villa himself, but also
the men who rallied around him, will
occupy the quarters of federal offi
cials who sought him as an outlaw.
Before leaving Chihuahua the fed
eral Gen. Mercado, at the request of
the United States consul, Marion
Letcher, and other consuls, left 200
soldiers for police duty, the promise
being that the rebels on entering the
city would not molestthe men. The
federal police took fright at the rebel
approach and fled. The consuls then
prevailed upon citizens to do the
policing.
CRIPPLE IS KILLED.
Florence Negro Tries to Scare Some
Other Colored Boys.
Robert Woodberry and Eugene
Snow, two negro boys from near
Poston, were brought in to Florence
Thursday night to be held on the
charge of killing Jeter Snow, a crip
pled negro, the brother of one of the
boys held for the killing. It seems
that the two boys had been in a gypsy
camp and had been frightened by the
gypsies, and on coming home had
thought it well to load up a gun and
put it by their bed to protect t:h~em
selves. Late In the night the crip
pled brother came home, and pre
tending to be a gypsy, possibly to
still further frighten them, called
out, "Let me tell your fortune." As
he entered the house he left his
crutches outside, the first time he
was ever known to walk' without
them, and entered the bed room of
the two boys. Robert reached for
the gun, and as Jeter came near the
bed fired, the load taking effect in
his neck, and the powder burning his
body dreadfully. He died instantly.
No reason other than fright can be
given to account for the killing.
SHOT TO DEATH.
Clarendon Youth Meets Death on His
Father's Farm. .
Ollie Rawlinson, 15-year-old son of
W. J. Rawlinson, Jr., was .accident
ally shot and killed on his father's
farm near Jordan, in Clarendon
county. According to reports, Ollie
and a negro boy were in a wagon,
going out to weigh up cotton in a
field, Ollie taking his gun along to
shoot some birds while he was out.
In some way not fully explained the
negro boy, it seems, took up the gun
and it was discharged, the -entire
load of shot entering the head and
face of young Rawlinson, killing him
instantly.

City of Waco Under Water.
With three rivers, the Trinity,
Brazos and Colorado, and innumer
able small streams, out of their
banks as a result of rains, which be
gan Monday night and still continue,
the flood situation in Central Texas
had by Wednesday assumed serious
proportions. Within a territory two
hundred miles in length and one hun
dred miles in width, practically all of
the lowlands are under water; ap
proximately 15,000 persons have
been driven from their homes; scores
have been rescued from treetops and
floating wreckage; several railroads
have been forced to suspend opera
tions and incalculable damage has
been done to property.
Seven persons are known to have
lost their lives. Wednesday five mem
bers of the family of W. C. Polk, a
farmer, were drowned at Belton, and
B. F. Lacy and a man named Manley
late met a similar fate near Dallas.
Lacey was driving stock from an
overflowed field when he and his
horse became entangled in a wire
fence and drowned. Manley lost his
life while attempting to rescue ma
rooned victims at the village of
Grand Prairie.
Waco, on the Brazos River and in
the centre of the flood area, Wednes
day reported the most serious siua
tions. Sections of that city are under
water and it is estimated that more
than 10,000 residents are homeless.
Property damage is estimated in ex
cess of $175,000: The Militarycom
panies stationed there have been or
dered on duty by Governor Colquitt
and ball cartridges have been issudd
to the guardsmen for use in the event
of looting. So far there has been no
disorder.
In th Leon River bottoms, near
Temple, a number of men, women
and children still were marooned late
Thursday after spending twenty-four
hours in the trees, and Thursday
night it was uncertain when impro
vised boats could be navigated
through the swift water. Near Dallas
boatment Wednesday rescued a dozen
persons from trees in tne Trinity
river bottoms and earlier in the day
boats took refugees from trees near
Waxachie and at other points.
The Colorado River at Austin after
falling Tuesday night, Wednesday
rose again, coming up at the rate of
six feet an hour for a time. Three
men riding oi a log floated down the
river at dsk, one getting into a tree
far out from shore and the other
two on top of the partially submerg
ed grand stand of the baseball park.
Boats were sent out to rescue the
men, but were unable to locate them
in the darkness. Who the men are
is unknown.
NGRO ATTEMPTED TO SHOOT.
But is Shot to Death by His Intended
Victim First..
A dispatch from Manning says a
negro named Napoleon Johnson was
shot and killed a few miles above
Paxville Tuesday by Arthur Cubbage,
a citizen of that section. Mr. Cub
bage came to Manning and gave him
self up to Sherift Gamble. Mr. Cub
bage states that he started from his
home to go bird hunting, having his
gun under the buggy seat, and just
as he got out to the road he saw the
negro in a wagon with some sacks of
oats. Ho had had some trouble with
the negro on a. former occasion, but
suspected nothing at this time. Just
as he says he turned out of his ave
nue into the road the negro drove a
short distance up the road, stooped
behind the sacks of oats and attempt
ed to shoot, but his gun ssnapped.
Mr. Cubbage says he at once jump
ed out of his buggy, got his gun from
under the seat and loaded it, and as
Johnson raised up from behind the
oats in the act of unloading his gun,
Mr. Cubbage fired, striking Johnson
in the face, and the latter falling
from his wagon to the ground.*

TWENTHIGHT MEN CAUGHT IN
BOSTON DEATH TRA
NO CHANCE TO ESEAPE
Cheap Hotel in Tenement District is
Quickly Consumed--Back Booms
Had Been Rented for the Night and
Inmates Had Doors Locked, Pre
venting Access to Fire Escapes.
Twenty-live men were killed in a
fire which swept through the upper
floors of the Arcadia hotel, a lodging
house in the soutli portion of Boston
Wednesday. Others are missing.
Scores were taken to hospitals suffer
ing from burns and injuries received
In jumping from windows. Nearly
all the bodies were terribly burned
and mutilated, making identification
impossible.
The victims were men in poor cir
cumstances who had resorted to the
place for a night's lodging. Caught
In the crowded bunks on the top floor
of the five-story brick building and in
the small rooms on the fourth floor
they were helpless. When they were
aroused the stairways were in flames
and there was a mad rush for the
fire escapes at the rear. Practically
all the men were naked.
Many were rescued by the firemen
and police. Some escaped by walk
ing a shaky plank stretched to an
adjoining building or by jumping
across a five-foot alley to neighboring
roofs. The property loss is only
$25,000.. The Arcadia was located
at the corner of Washington and La
conia streets. The lower floors were
occupied by stores.
The fire apparently started in' a
hallway closet on the street floor. The
flames swept up the wooden stairways
and burned through the roof. Ac
cording to William Walsh, the night
clerk, there were 178 lodgers in the
building when the fire was discovered
by a passing newsboy. After turning
in an alarm he rushed into the .build
ing, awakening the men with his
shouts. The top floor was one large
room filled with cots and bunks.
On the fourth floor where the loss
of life was heaviest, there were 30
tiny rooms, like cells, with two cots
in each. A hallway ran through the
center. Nearly all those occupying
rooms on the front of the building,
perished. The men in the rear
rooms, opening on the fire escape had
locked the doors when they went to
bed and those in front were unable
to reach the fire escape.
When the firemen arrived flames
were shooting 20 feet in the air from
the windows on the fourth and fifth
floors and the fire escapes and the
roof were a mass of shrieking, strug
gling humanity. Despite shouts of as
surance from below, tiree men jump
ed from the roof. Two were instant
ly killed. The third, who had wrap
ped a mattraess around himself, es
aped with a few bruises.
Life nets were quickly stretched by
the firemen and many were rescued
in this manner. Others were taken
own ladders with the flames sweep
ing about them. The intense heat
soon drove the firemen from their
ladders and made it necessary to fight
he fire from the street and from the
levated railway structure running in
ront of the building.
It was nearly an hour after the
iremen arrived before they were able
o enter the lodging house. The first
man to ascnd a smoking ladder
shouted: "My God, boys, that place
s littered with dead." *
HORRY HOMICIDE.

harged with the killing. According
to Hooks and young Stroud they were
riding along in a .buggy on the place
of the elder Stroud when he stopped
them. Louis Stroud, he said, seized
Eooks by the arm and endeavored to
pull him from the buggy, and while
grasping Hooks with one arm Stroud
pulled a knife from his pocket and
was in the act of opening it with his
teeth, when Hooks shot him in the
breast, killing him almost instantly.
A woman who was an eye-witness to
the affair. and about whom the trou
ble is alleged to have originated, is
credited with saying that both Hooks
and the younger Stroud fired shots.*
.Hurt by Explosion.
Charlie Cutts and Claude White,
two little boys of Florence, were hurt
by the explosion of powder in a gun

it. The latter was badly burned
about the face and will be fortunate
if he saves even one eye. The former
was not -badly hurt.*

UNITED STATES HAS NEW DE
STRUCTIVE FORCE.
Invisible Roy Beams Will Annihilate
a Warship Many Miles Away by
Causes Explision in Magazine.
Invisible light waves that will, it is
alleged, annihilate the largest dread
nought affoat or destroy a bomb-cary
rying aeroplane have been produced
by William Burr Gibson, of Schenec
tady, N. Y. The instrument of pro
duction Is already in the possession
of the United States government, and
is undergoing rigid tests. In a test
made by th^ inventor, before apply
ing for the itent, a charge of dyna
mite was exploded five miles away.
The apparatus can be carried around
by an ordinary man.
"Although I have not made actual
experiments with aeroplanes," said
the inventor, "the success which has
attended the other demonstrations
warrants me in predicting that it will
as readily destroy war aeroplanes as
it will explode ordinary mines." Ex
perats declare it will revolutionize
warfare. With its aid, an invading
force could easily explode every mine
in its line of progress, and destroy its
antagonist's defenses in a day.
"By means of these invisible rays,"
said one, "a battleship would be
blown to atoms by the explosion of
its own magazines with no more pow
er than it takes to light an orinary
are lamp." The machine is extreme
ly simple, and is the result of seven
years' experimenting by the inventor,
who is 25 years old. It consists of an
ordinary arc light, two quartz lenses,
and seven colored screens. The de
vice is designed to concentrade and
project ultra-violet rays.
"When the ultra violet rays im
pinge upon powder," said Mr. Gib
son, "they cause a molecular action
which sets up friction. This pro
duces heat and causes the powder to
explode." By directing the stream of
lifht upwards, any aeroplane carrying
bombs would be destroyed. The in
ventor himself has an ingenious idea
to destroy any of the enemy's aero
planes which are sent out without
bombs. He proposes to send up small
balloons with dynamite bombs at
tached. These would be exploded
near the flying craft creating a vac
cum and capsizing the machines.

FAROUS SOUTI EAROLINN IES
AT BALTIMORE
WONQUERER OFUILEDRA
Born at Winnsboro, David Dubose
Gaillard Becomes One of the Fore
most of Army Engineers and Was
Largely Responsigle for the Suc.
cess at Panama.
Lieut. Col. David Dubose Gaillard,
United States army, who directed the
engineering work in the Culebra Cut,
a division of the Panama canal, died
at John Hopkins ho: -.tal at Blti
more Friday. Lieut. Col. Gamar
had been a patient at the,-*upga. -
since August 17 last, sufferljfont
a growth in the head, tMe resulto vt
seven years' arduous labor in the
tropical climate of the Canal Zone,
He failed gradually but steadily,
and for the last two months had bee&
in, a state of coma,,dueto the pres
sure of the cranial growth upon the
brain cells. The physinsldecided
some time ago that.an4eration was
useless and might aNIhs'death.
He Is survived by his widow and.a
son, Lieut. David P. Gaillard, United
States army. Both were at the bed
side when the end came.
Lieut. Col. Gaillard was born at
Winnsboro, S. C., In 1854. He grad
uated from Wes - Point 3Mitary
Academy in 1854'%nd since that-Urnm
had won many honors In the engi
neering service. A bill was Intro
duced in congress last month pro
moting him to the rank of colonel in
recognition of his distinguished ser
vices which culminated in the great
engineering feat In the Culebra sec
tion of the Panama canal When
Culebra Cut was flooded by the blast
ing of Gamboa dike on October 10
last Col. Gaillard lay unconscious in
his bed at the hospital.
Col. Gaillard's death Is the cul-.
mination of a breakdown incurred by
long hours of work and exposure In
the Canal Zone, where he pitted his
skill as an engineer against the shift
ing soil of the Culebra Cut. To him
had been given the most difficult task
in connection with the canal's con
struction, to master the landslides
and quicksands which extended for
eight miles along the line of the Cul
ebra cut
During the early years of his con
test with the landslides Col. Gaillard
never knew what a morning was to
bring forth. Over night the moun
tains moved and covered with their
deposit the tracks, and even the cars,
which were used to remove material.
The Culebra Cut runs through the
backbone of the American continent.
Gaillard dug Indomitably until hill
after hill found its angle of repose
and he checked the landslides save at
Cucuracha and points nearby. There
the sliding was persistent, ,but had
visibly weakened, when the engineer
was compelled to stop his work and
seek rest.
For the greater period of his work
on the Isthmus Col. Gaillard was
without a chief assistant. He wanted
to save money. He gave his .atten
tion not only to the great engineering
problems, but to all the details of
shovel work, train work and drain
age. He checked up on the small
things and once it was computed that
by his careful oversight he had saved
the government $17,000,000.
Men who worked with him said
that he gave twelve hours of each -
day to the Culebra Cut. In addition
he had a voice In all matters pertain
ing to engineering work In the zone,
to civil administration and to the
general conduct of affairs. The hard
work, the nervous strain, the worry
and the tropical climate combined
broke his health at the hour of his
final triumph. There was little left
there to be done but to remove the*
soft earth of the side of Cucuracha.
