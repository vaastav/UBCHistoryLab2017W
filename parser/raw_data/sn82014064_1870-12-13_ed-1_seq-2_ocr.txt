FEEE HATIQATIOE OF THE ST. LAW
EESCE,
Closely connected with the fishery ques
tion in the President's message and in tho
discussions of the press, is that of the free
navigation of the St. Lawrence. Consider
ing the prominence given to the Utter
question, it may seem surprising, bnt it is
nevertheless true, *bat the Canadians have
advanced no new pretensions on the sub
ject, nor have they ever refused to permit
American vessels to use that rivet. As a
matter of fact, they havo uniformly even
penntlted our public vessels to nso their
canals: and the tolls on ihe SL Lawrence
and the Welland Canals are tho same
for American vessels as for Canadian craft
Hundreds of large eanalboats belonging
lo the United States carry lumber from
Ottawa and Prescott, through tho Cana
dian canals to Lake Champlain.
The right to the freedom of the outlet lo
the great lakes has always been claimed by
the United States; and, whilst England
has never officially conceded the right, she
has not attempted .to enforce a contrary
proposition. And the reason is sufficiently
apparent. Tbe navigation of the St. Law
rence, so far as ascending vessels are con
cerned. is impracticable, unless by the aid
of the canals built on the banka of tbe
river, to overcome tho various rapids.
These canals are not constructed in tbe
channel of the river, or in the river at all,
but cut in the bonks, on the soil of Canada,
oad which we have no more right to use,
without the consent of Canada, than the
Canadians have to use the Erie or any
other American canal. The controversy,
therefore, as to the freedom of the Si. Law
renee bos no practical merits • whatever.
And, independently of this, there has been
no attempt —no recent attempt, certainly—
on the part of Canada to enforce any claim
in this connection.
The subject of the free navigation ol
tboSL Lawrence and the enlargement of
its canals has doubtless been brought to
public attention in consequence of the
want felt in the West for cheapened trans
portation—for the competition of the great
water rente of the St. Lawrence. The
memorials of Bourd- of Trade in the. West
show that they require all the channels of
communication that can be provided, and
hence the subject of the free navigation of
the St. Lawrence becomes a question of
prominence andimportance. Bnt the “ free
navigation n of the St. Lawrence is a very
different matter from the “ freedom of the
Hirer St. Lawrence.** The one can only
be obtained by negotiation and arrange*
meet with the owners of the canals which
make the “ navigation ** of the river possible.
The other is a mere naked enforcement of
a right which has nover been withheld,
and which, in consequence of the natural
obstructions in the way. the miles of rapids
to be overcome, is of no practical nse to
The subject has now assumed such prom
inence that it must be settled in some way.
That part of tbe President's message is
cow l*foro the House Committee on For-
eign Relations, and as soon as General
Banks makes the report, the matter will
come before tbe House for general discus
sion. Two means of adjusting these ques
tions are open. One Is by negotiation and
arrangement hy which the Canadians will
give u-s the freedom of their fisheries and
tbe freedom of the.* navigation of the St.
Lawrence, enlarging its canals to tbe re
quirements of our trade. The other Is by
a war of conquest, by taking Canada, no~
l> rm rolrn*. A brief tine only will elapse
l-trforo Congress will determine which
course shall be adopted.
The suggestion as to forcing Canada
iuto an arrangement by doing away with
the bonded system and the transit trade
can scarcely be Intended for practical
action. Tbe transit trade is of as much
l*eni-fit to us as It Is to Canada.- Tbe
Grand Trunk and the Great Western Rail
roads, of Canada, are competing routes
connecting with the Michigan Central
Hailroad. and with the Erie and New York
Central Railroads, and not only help
cheapen freights, but give additional chan
nels of communication from tbe West.
Aside from the interests of tho community
at large, it is clear that to put an end to
the transit regulations, would injure our
own railroads fully as much as it would the
Canada Great Western. As for the abro
gation of the bonded system, the effect
would mtnply be to force Canada to import
her goods and merchandise directly to
Montreal in the season of navigation, and
to hasten the completion of the “ Inter
colonial” Railroad from Montreal to Hali
fax. so as to afford a communication with
the Atlantic daring the winter. It would
Kcnd the Allan lino o£ Canadian steamers
to Halifax In the winter, instead of, as now,
to Portland, w'dilat all the bonded goods
now sold to Canada by New York, Boston,
and other Atlantic seaports, and convoyed
l»y oar railroads and canals to Canada,
would be sent direct to Qaeboc and Mon
treal. and onr merchants would lose the
profits of handling, as onr railroads would
lose the freights for carrying them.
A great deal of the ill-feeling which un
doubtedly exists against Canada arises from
the filly and abusive tone of the Canadian
press, generally, in speaking of the United
States. There is a class of Canadians in
their towns and villages intensely pro
vincial in their ideas, wholly ignorant of
anything beyond their own narrow cx
|H>rience&. and disgustingly self-important
and insulting as regards' the “ Yankees.*’
Their public men'too, with but few excep
tions—and notably the Premier, Sir John
Macdonald, is one of these exceptions—are
c-qnallr ignorant ' and narrow-minded
lienee It is that we can scarcely approach
the subject of our relations
with Canada in that spirit which
would exist if the inhabitants of
the Dominion,’* as it is grandiloquently
termed, were less offensive in their man
ners. But the question is not what is best
for the Canadians. • It is what is the proff
er course (or this government to pursue
in the interests of oar own people, and in
maintenance of onr just rights, whatever
they arc ? And it is to be hoped, when
the matter comes hp for debate in Con
gress m a brief lime—probably imme
diately after the holidays—that the discos
hod will, in the interests of oorown peo
ple. and in keeping with the dignity of our
jH.)silion as a nation, assume a higher tone
than mere recrimination about the un
friendliness and insults of the ** semi-inde
pendent government" of Canada.

government of the republic is ready for

long the resistance to any effective purpose
ih plain. The principal obstacle to peace
would bo overcome if the Paris mob were
under (he rule of military force, and com*,
polled either to fight the Germans or to
make peace. We see no means of effect
ing this-end, save by the capitulation of
Paris or Us bombardment. Tbe latter bas
been resolved on by King William, and
without doubt tho former will soon follow.
All signs now point to an early peace.
THE COAL MIHEBB* STRIKE.
The present strike among the coal miners
of Scranton and other points in Pennsyl
vania has some remarkable features, and
furnishes some food for wholesome reflec
tion. The strike is among those engaged
in the anthracite region, embracing Lu
zerne, Carbon, Schuylkill, Colombia,
Northumberland, and Dauphin Counties.
Scranton, in Luzerne Comity, is the head
quarters of this district. In these counties
there are 30,000 miners and laborers at
work, and the men are chiefly'Welsh and
Irish. Tho companies employing this
force are the Delaware, Lackawanna and
Western Coal Company (which also owns
the railroad of the same name ), tho Dela
ware and Hudson Coal Company (which
also owns the canal of the same name), and
tho Pennsylvania Goal Company (which
owns a railway in Carbon County
on which the loaded cars run by
force of gravity). It will be
seen that the cool companies do their
own transportation. The operation of coal
mining is carried on as follows; Each miner
piovides himself with his own tools, lamp,
oil, powder, and all the requisites of his
business: he employs and pays his own
laborers. Ho gets paid at an agreed rate
for the nmonnt of coal which he and hte
helpers deliver at the pit's month. The
present wages at this rate yields, for a full
day's labor, to the miner, £3.17. Out of
•his he pays his two assistant laborers £2
each, which, -with for other expenses,
leaves him $4.17 per day. According to
tho basis agreed upon a year and a half
ago, the average price paid to the miner
was 55 cents per ton of coaL This
is what the company paid for tho CoaL
The average distance from these mines to
Philadelphia and Blizabcthport islOOmiles.
That is the amount of transportation
that has to be performed. The pro
duction of coal during the present
season has been very great. The
miners. In order to realize living wages
for themselves and their laborers, had to
bring out a largo amount each day. There
being more coal than there was a demand
for, the price fell below $5 per ton, and
it was selling at the destination, by (ho
cargo, at $4 per ton. The difference be
tween 55 cents per ton and $4, was made
up of the cost of transportation. We have
the authority of the Philadelphia Inquirer
for the statement that a contractor deliv
ered recently a very large supply to the
government, at Washington City, at $4, and
made a handsome profit. We have no
doubt that at $4 per loathe coal companies
can moke an enormous profit. Bat, having
a monopoly, they propose to reduce the
wages 33 per cent. Against this tho miners
have protested and struck. This was what
was expected, and the cool companies now
propose that, in consequence of the strike,
the price of coal shall be advanced. This
rate of wages reduces the net earnings of
the miner for the same amount of coal to
less than $2.50 per day.
The wages of all the operatives on these
three transportation lines have also been
reduced, and to the. army of discontented
miners and laborers must be added tho
railroad and canal operatives.
The difficulty is nbt the ordinary case of
a transportation company holding a pro
ducer at its mercy, and extorting the en
tire value of tho article produced for its
transportation. Tho transportation com
panies in this esse are also owners of the
mines. They pay 55 cents per tan
for tho coal at tho month of the mine. To
cam a respectable living, the miner and
his laborers must produce a given amount
of coal per day. There is no loss to the
company from shirking, nor from idleness,
nor want of skill, because tho miner is only
paid for the coal he brings out. The dif
ference in the price of coal at the market
and the price paid to the miner is, there
fore, wholly mode up by the cost of
transportation. The Delaware, Lacka
wanna A Western Hallway has its
tines from Scranton to Hoboken, and
as far west as Oswego, N. Y. Of all these
routes, it is the owner or lessee. This com
pany does not publish tho results of Us
business In moving coal, though it declared
a dividend of 10 per cent on watered stock
in 18G3. ,
The Delaware and Hudson Canal Com
pany extends from Honesdole, Fa., to Ed
dyrflle, in New York. It also owns the
Delaware & Hudson Railroad, from Scran
ton to Honcsdale, thirty-two miles, and
has leased branches and extensions 240
miles In addition. The cost of the canal
and railroads and equipments was $10,000,-
000, In 1562, the capital stock was $7,-
">00,000; in ISO 4 it was increased tosß,-
750,000; in 1665 to $10,000,000, and in
18C8 to $11,500,000. Notwithstanding
these repeated waterings of the stock, the
annual dividends since 1863 have averaged
10 percent, which is equal to 24 per cent
on the real capital invested.
The Pennsylvania Coal Company has a
railway operated by stationary engines.
The whole cost of the railway was $2,000,-
000. Its capital stock and debts are equal
to $4,000,000, and in IS6S-9 it declared
quarterly dividends of 5 per cent each, or
an aggregate of 20 per cent
These are the railways which control the
anthracite coal supply. They transport
their own coal. They have a monopoly of
the coal, and a monopoly of the transpor
tation. We have tie statement of the
miser made to the last Dabor Congress,
that the cost of coal to the company docs
not exceed 55 cents per ton, and the'differ
ence between that cost and' the price at the
market on the Hudson is collected by
these companies for transportation. It
will be seen that the capital stock of all
these companies is largely fraudulent, and
that they divide among the owners from
16 to 20 per cent on even the fraudulent
stock.
The price of anthracite coal is, to a great
extent, regulated by that of bituminous
coat When anthracite coal gets too high,
the public will nse the bituminous coal.
But the price of bituminous coal in the
Eastern markets is kept up by an act of
Congress which excludes competing coal
Iby a tax equal to $b3S per ton, currency,
| If this tax, which yields little or no revo
-1 nnc,wero repealed, the price of bituminous
I coal would fall, and in its fall bring down
that of anthracite. The great cry is that,
if the price of coal be reduced, our minors
will have to take starvation wages. But
are they not as near that now as they can
be ? They are taxed on their tools their |
oil,andlhelrpowder,andtheirclothing,Bnd i
yet they do not get much more than one*
half per ton for the coal at the pit's month
that the miners of England got For aa
average distance of 150 miles the mining
rotopunes have been getting at least
tier lon for transportation. The
minimum priee of coal sAidt they eoei to
maintain, is $5 per ton. Unable to get
mote than they, propose to redone the
wages of the miner* and the railroad op
eratives At $4 per ton, they get over
$3.25 per lon for transportation 150 miles.
They insist oh these rates that they may
have their 20 per cent dividends on their
-fictitious stock.
When to *hi« enormous abuse by (he
an lb radio coal companies, are added Ibe
filiU more extensive operations of the
bituminous coal companies, which include
the iron and transportation business, we
can imagine the tremendous proportions
of the coal monopoly To
sustain in all' He branches,
the American'people are taxed inordin
ately for fuel and nponaHUie. l arUcleain
the* manufacture of which coal\ia used,
and, op wo have'seen, the mere mechanics
and laborers who produce this coal, are
brought down to starvation prices.
.EEPOTLICAHIBM 1H EHOLAHD.
We do not expect tho, early establish
ment of a republic in England, thongh we
never forget that, strong as Is tho supposed
preference of the English people for
•aristocratic inßtUutions,*tbe substratum of
English society care no more for them to
day than they did in the' days of - Oliver
C roiowell and Praise-Odd Barobouea. The 1
Libera] League of London, has a very small
constituency among that very. respectable
fifth part of the English people who have
votes. But among the great, though very
vulgar, four-fifths who have no votes,
who furnish all - the paupers
and none of the Peers, who return two
thirds of the working class and none of the
members of Parliament,—among these the
Liberal League has a very numerous con
stituency. In fact, the liberal League is
about the only political institution in or
through which this very numerous class
can make known their sentiments.
When this Liberal League holds one of
its great open air mass meetings, .there
fore, we recognize the fact that it more:
nearly represents tbe view of tho whole
people of England than does a government
which is based on the voles of one-fifth of
that people. Tbe pretext of the last meet
ing of the League was to protest against
the dowry of national money to the Prin
cess Louise. Tbe descendants of Victoria
are now multiplying by the dozen, and the
bill for their royal support is increasing in
a geometrical ratio. The entire provision
for the Boyal Family, including the rental
of the crown lands, and tho estates enjoy
ed by the crown, is about .£2,000,000, or
$10,000,000, a year.
Hr. Disraeli, in bis late half Tory, half
lUdical novel of 41 Loth air,’’ pictures tho
leading families of the nobility as suffer
ing from tbe possession of so many estates
to each owner, that to make an occasional
stop of a few weeks at each castle or palace
that demanded it, kept the distressed no
bleman constantly on his travels. He was
deprived of the ordinary comforts of a
home by reason, of his having eo many
homes which he must visit to prevent their
'passing into dilapidation. Mr. John Bright
stated last winter, and bis statement has
been widely accepted by tho English re
news, that 100 persons, male or female,
now own more than half tho land of Eng
land. Of course, most of these ir»o per
sons will marry within their own circle,
1 thus consolidating enormous estates at
every marriage, the estates of both parents
in each instance being united In the eldest
son. The prospect is, therefore, that in
fifty years the. half of England will be
owned by seventy persons, and in a cen
tury by, perhaps, twenty. This tendency
to the concentration of land In England in
the hands of the nobility, every year les
sening the area devoted to cultivation, and
increasing the difficulty of obtaining bread,
is exactly like the concentration of land in
the hands of the Ohnreh in France prior
to the French Revolution, and the dmi-
lar monopoly of land in Italy, 'Spain,
and Mexico. It is unnatural; it is one
which the privileged parties wOl never sur
render until the monopoly is broken; and
it is, therefore, an evil which nothing but
revolution can end, and which revolution
must, in due lime, terminate.
. In contrast with these great monopolies
of land and power, the Liberal League
state that there are 1117,000 paupers in
London alone, and no sophistry can pre
vent their seeing that the vast monopolies
of tho chief source of production—land,
and the prohibition of its cultivation or
distribution —have a.close relation to the
scarcity of bread. In view of these facta,
the Queen is informed, with no disrespect
for herself personally, but only for the
machinery of which she forms a part, that,
since the poorest workman must provide
for his children out of his own funds,
they see no reason why she should not em~
ulate their example. Finally, we are told
they “appeal to tho entire people, igno
rant and uneducated, to decide, by ballot,
whether or not they should supersede the
present cumbersome and Inhuman system
of government by tho establishment of a
republic.” (These are strong words.
Though the writer of tho despatch evident
ly supposes that the appeal ought to be
only to the educated, we, in America, have
long since learned that education follows,
instead of preceding, the ballot. If the
English people b&d votes, the taxes which
now go to maintain the Royal Family
would, of themselves, supply half the king*
dom with schools.

Ip, and always has been, to stay where-they are
and give all tbe trouble tbey can. Whenever the
time comes to establish a new party, it will make
its appearance, whether anybody charges himself
with tbe special work of getting It up or not,”
A few weeks ago we published an article,
which had a most successful run, pointing
out certain tendencies of the time toward
such a reorganization of parties as should
bring new issues to the front in place of
those respectable, bat no longer nsoful, or
available, ones appertaining!© the last war.
We expressed the opinion, and this was the
real point of the article, that the revenue
reformers, being a majority of the next
House of Representatives, would control
its organization.
We have seen nothing to change our
opinion upon this point, but mnch to con
firm it; and wo ore especially oofirmed in
it by,the alternate meekness and savagery
of the Now York Tribune. The high
tariff ring have become so alarmed at the
prospect that they have set ont to--repeal
the law which requires Congress to or
ganize on the 4th of March. They are do
ing this to gain time, vainly hoping that
something will turn up before next De
cember to give the control of the House to
the minority of Its members. But it ap
pears that they are achieving no groat suc
cess in this movd.
One of tho interesting features of the
present war has been the economy with
which the Germans have utilized the ser
vices of their 200,000 and upward of
French prisoners. Instead of penning
them np In stockades, where they would he
decimated by disease, and be rendered
not only filthy and dangerous,
but costly, the Germans si first
offered them free employment for full
wages (above their board), upon various
public works, which the FrencH were glad
to accept, in lien of the fatiguing and
loathsome imprisonment at the stockade.
In this manner, while the victors of
Gravellotto, and Sedan, were destroying the
public works of France, the prisoners
taken in those battles were building public
improvements in Germany. Finding that
the French prisoners were so easily identi
fied, by their French accent and other
characteristics, as to preclude all danger of
their escape, the German officers in charge,
finally distributed a largo portion of these
prisoners among the German farmers and
mechanics, to work for wages at the occupa
tions to which they were most accustomed 1
in France. Moreover, the 200,000 and up
ward of German artisans and workingmen
expelled from France are now teaching
and spreading in Germany the arts which
they acquired while in France. They are
performing much the same mission in Ger
many as the Huguenot artisans of ‘ France,
expelled during their various perse
cutions, performed in Switzerland,
, Holland, 1 Belgium, England, and, in
some degree, in America. Al

and French prisoners combined do not

The .Solar Corona, and Planetoid*
The great problem which is proposed to bo
EOlred by observations of tbo eclipse of next
week, is the nature of tbo eon’s cirona- The
phenomenon is variously ascribed to the
presence of a noD-lamiuoiu atmosphere ex
tending to a great distance from the snn's
body, and to fmmeneo numbers of aerolitic
particles which drelo aronnd him.
The latter hypothesis seems to bo the one
which Is meet in favor ; a little mathematical
reaecning ta sufficient to expose its absurd
ity.
Beginning with the planet heptane, the
most distant known, wo calculate that his pe
riod of revolution is exactly the same which
would have been occupied m one rotation on
the axis, by a globe bounded by bis orbit, and
having the snn as a centre; the mean axial 1
velocity of all tbo particles of such & globe '
being equal to the average axial velocity of <
ail the particles now composing the mass of 1
.the snn. The same equation Bolds good In
*lbe case of all the other planetary bodies.
We find that the same actual velocity which
carries the snn round once in 507. S earth hours
would carry a globe of the same diameter as
the orbit of Mercury round on its axis once
in 88 days. Prom this fact it is legitimate to
argue that no mass revolving aronnd the snn
can have a greater mean angular velocity in
the orbit than the axial velocity of the snn
to-day; it must he much lees than that quan
present axial velocity of the snn would I
give to a body, situated fifteen millions of
j miles from his surface, -just enough velocalv
in the orbit to counterbalance the force of i
i attraction toward the son’s centra. This,
then, is the limit of planetary revolution. In*
tide of that limit a body would be drawn to
the sun's surface, unless kept away by the
mechanical contact of his atmosphere. But
in order to this, the body must move with
the same velocity as the atmosphere; m re
ality, form a part of it, and ha of the same
specific density as the atmosphere at the same
distance.
The above-named limit of minimum is that
of mean distance. Some of the comets pass
within much loss than fifteen millions of
miles of the snn at the time of perihelion;
l>nt it is followed by a compensating greater
aphelion distance.
Itisnonsenaetotalkaboutseparate bodies
giving rise to the coronal display daring an
eclipse. A particle of matter ono million
miles removed frem -the sun’s centra would
need to travel round him two and a half times
each twentv-four hours, or sixty times as rap
idly as the axial velocity of the sun, to keep
from falling to his surface.
The corona moat be an aerial envelops of
the son. His atmosphere ctn extend fifteen
*nd one-half millions of miles from bis cen
tre, that being the distance which I have cal
culated as the limit of equilibrium between .
the tangential and tbs centripetal forces ; the
former being determined by tbe axial velocity
of tbe snn. It is not necessary that the at
mosphere should be dense enough for the
whole of that dittance to reflect light.
In tbe same way we may calculate a height
of about 22,250 miles as tbe limit of the eanh'e
atmosphere. Ko moon coaid circle round her
at a Ices distance. But we know that the
earth’s atmosphere loses its refractive power
at a height of SCO mjles-ror2-9of that distance.
Accepting tbe same ratio to exist in tbe case
of tbe sun. it would give a depth of a little
more than 3, 000,COO miles for the corona ;
and this is about the extent which agrees with
the best observations of past eclipses.
Mercury is, thus, undoubtedly the nearest
placet to tbe snn, though there are certain
changes in tbe direction of bis orbit which
havered astronomers to lock foriatra-Hcrcn
nil planet*. Xo such things exist. But tbs
changes ot position in tbe orlU of Mercury
are still facte. Hay they not be accounted
for in another wav ?
We know that tbe earth s mass is augment
ed to an extent which has been estimated at
ISO tons annually, bv xhe fall of millions of
arrobtes. which haverevolved (comet-fssblon)
around the snn. la very much prolonged ellip
tic orbits, until they meet the earth in her an
nual round, acd are drawn to her surface by
her superior attraction- We have good rea
pon to believe that these belts ot planetoids
course in everv direction from tbs sun, as the
comets do, and they must, therefore, be met
with much more numerously In the vicinity of
Mercury’s orbit than near the earth's path.
EvenwUh tbe lesser attractive power of Mer
enrv the annual augmentation of his mass
must be greater than in tbe case of the earth,
while Us effect will be correspondingly en
hanced, aa being In much larger proportion to
the whcle, Mercury is httle more thin 1-U
as heavy aa the earth, or, in’ round
numbers, 437,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons,
and, though 1 bare not undertaken a thorough

clode, from a general discussion of tbe qoee

Lawbxkcb, Dec. 9.
Bntler County, in the southwestern portion
rf this State, has recently witnessed a series
of tragedies, not unfrequent in tbe history of
border eommanitiee t and incident to the settle-
taent of new conntnea. Some of the charao-
Icib are well-known plainsmen, around whose
pereonal history gather many of tbe most
startling incidente connected with the wild
life of tbe border. They are men who

Tbe plained an is a character. He Is sui
omen's. He is tbe connecting link between
barbarism and civilization; and, with him, it
is difficult to tell where tbo barbarism ends
and civilization begins. He is a chieftain
without followers; an Emperor without sub
jects. He asks not for retainers. He is not
aggressive, but he is absolutely fearless. He
uover courts a fight, except on extremely rare
occasions, and when on a “ spree,” which he
seldom indulge* in. He is cot a model of
temperance and sobriety—bis name is never
found enrolled in the Father Matthew socie
ties; but he is far from being a drunkard.
He seldom drinks to excess, and for weeks
"never tastes a drop.” His diet for
months Is meat only; vegetables he
never eats; floor is eonenmed when he has it.
sod, when bo don't, “jerked ” buffalo, for a

pitable to strangers, and relentless to ene-'
miea. He does everything on the square.

sequent habeas corpus, as anv other mao.
Iu finishing up the Job there will be no oso
for judges or juries. A Coroner, and a vig
orous Irishman with a spade, will be about all
that it ts necessary to provide for.
The Plainsman is not nofr^jaentlyeducated.
His perceptions are quick, his intellect
vigorous, active, and strong. He is not vul
garly and habitually profane. Alone so much,
he becomes by usture taciturn, and, always in
the presence of the grandeur of the moun
tains or the limitless expanse of the wide, ex
t ended plain, he ue consciously becomes almost
religious: but be wilt swear at a mule. Alex
ander Narjores is the only man conversant
with the plains I have over known who did
cot conriuerit necessary to use. by-words in
cisligating mullah quadrupeds. The plains
man, in most instances, is a gentleman. Strip
liim of his buckskins and place upon him a
jaunty cap, and nobby coat, and choker collar,
and he would pats for a Newi'ork dandv. Ho
is at home wherever ho is. He would be at
ease aa much at a reception of Grant or Sher
man aa in the rude tent of Satanta or Satanic.
Years agone he had the advantages of a good
common school education. He commuted
some “youthful indiscretion,'* cropped the
tail ox some old farmer’s horse
short,
“ pushed** a companion too vigorously in a
saloon broil, and has fled to the prairies, to
allow his wild oats to germinate m a kindly
and retentive soil. Once havingsnmmoredand
wintered here, be never returns. He is both
married and not married. He U&a no wife ■
but he has one or more squaws among a bah
dozen or more wild tribes. Be firmly be
lieves that the savage tribes can only be im
proved and civilized through the medium of
amalgamation; and he finds corroboration
and confirmation of his theory in tbo history
of the somi-eivilized tribes of tho Indian Ter
ritory and tho failure to civilize the Blanket,
or Plains Indiana.
So much for preliminary to a sketch of soma
of the characters in the Ute Botler Comity
tragedies. On the Bth of November last,
Jack Corbin, Jim Smith, Louis and George
Booth wore killed hj a so-called vigil
ance committee, or mob of citizens of
Butler County, upon a charge of horse-steal
log. Corbin was hanged to a sycamore tree;
Smith and the Booths shot. The deed was
done between tho hours of sunset and aon rite.
The moon shone down brightly and serenely
upon the deed of darkness, aa it his looked
down placidly upon many a tragedy before.
Without a chance to prove their innocence,with
out proofs of their guilt, these men were taken
ont and murdered, and tbn majesty of the law
insulted and violated. They may have all
been guilty. They may have been horse
thieves. But it is extremely doubtful whether
they all belonged to this gentry. Smith was a
bad man, acd quite likely guilty; but the laws

Jack Corbin is well known to plainsmen
and to military officers who have led expedi
time against the hostile Indians of the South
west during the last few years. His reel
name was McGrath. Be came from St. Lonis.
In 1504. he had a difficulty with a saloon*
keeper m that city, in a common bar-room
brawl, and shot the taloon-kcopec. He then
fled to tho prairies, and has been a government
servant most of the time since ISttf. Ho was
with General Cnstar m the battle of Wichi
ta, when the noted Chief, Black Kettle, was
killed, and was a servant to General Forsyth
in 1869. He was well educated and of respect
ive family connections. His father, a well
to-do farmer in Illinois, was out this way last
summer to look up bia erring and wan
dering son. He met with an
old plainsman, an interpreter for one
of the wild tribes of the Southwest, and in
quired for hie son, and begged him to carry
to idm the message that he was in comforta
ble circumstances, and implored him to return
to the bouse of bia father, where he might
have sii he could wish to make himself com
fortable and respectable. The message was
delivered to Corbin (alia* McGrath) by our
informant, the Indian interpreter, the very
day before tho tragedy that closed his earthly
career. At the time, Corbin was partially un- i
der the infloerce of liquor; bat ue listened I
attentively to the message from his once-loved
and honored father, and seemed deeply moved. J
He finally replied; '* Well, Mac, Til see you ;
again about this matter, and talk with von |
farther about it.” That night be was taken I
from his bed and bung to a sycamore tree as a j
common horse-thief. Corbin was the beet i
shot of the prairie. Ho has
frequently to shoot cigars from a companion’s !
month, and never failed his mark. He bad no j
knowledge of fear. ToGustar, Forsyth, and I
other military officers, bo has been of invaln- J
ble service. 'He has been through scenes and 1
iu dangers thft* Wild BUI would have shrunk j
from. He was never known to fiineb from i
the execution cf a commission entrusted to 1
kim. In his pockets, after his execution,
were found orders from General Guitar to j
seize government property, horses, moles,
etc., tb*t bo bad reason to believe had been
stolen from the government, and return the
came to the nearest military post. In this
way a large amount of government horses has
been recovered. There was also found in hi*
possesion an order of arrest, issued against a
noted criminal.
Booth, wbo was shot upon the same
night of the Bth of November, came from On
tario, N. Y. He settled down first
in Missouri, and was engaged m
stock-raising, principally the growing of
hogs. When the war broke out,
he was plundered by both armies. His stock
was driven off, and be left tndescairfor the
?raines. Be commenced trading with the
lairs Indians, where he remained from 1861
to 1964. In tbe fall of the latter year Broth.
Bill Matteeon, and a negro, started from
Booth’s Bsscbe, on tbe Arkansas, to Council
Grove, at that time a frontier town in Ksa
tasr At a ran she on Coon Creek tbe party of
three were attacked by 150 Arrapahoea. Mat
teeon proposed to try to mas© their eecapsm

bouse, and it is d—d hard for Indians to take
it,*’ And so tbe hllle party fonsbttbe 150
Amcahoes for three days, and, killing a urge
number of them: when the Indiana retired,
and they pursued their journey without fur
ther molestation. In 1867 Booth moved do wn
from the Arkansas to Walnut Creek, in Butler
County, where he took up a
claim/ . mamed, and, anparentlv,
had settled down for life. He
resumed his old business of stock-raising, and
had quite a Urge number cf hogs. One day
be noticed that one of his target t and best bogs
bad disappeared. Suspecting that the occu
pant of a neighboring claim had stolen bis
rog. he wectTohis caoln. The occnpant was
gone. Having a curiosity to see whether
there was any porcine meat intbatproproqmty
be looked under tbe bed. and found a tub full
ofnewlv-ealted bams and shoulders. The
next daV. accosting hfeneighbor, be aakod him
if he had killed any hogs lately. He replied
that he had not. He then inquired if he had
bought anr pork recently, and received a neg
ative answer. Booth then told him that he
bad stolen his bog, and said; “ ion know
what tbe law is. and the penalty; but Idont
want to give von any trouble; if voull pay
me the value of tbe hrg, I’H never say any
thing about it, and vou
shall not be . prosecuted. This
was refused, and atgry words fol
. which led to blows, and Booth gave the
accused a most unmerciful beating. This, it
i« believed by many, was the origin of Booth s I
difficulties. His brother, George Booth, was 1
in a New York cavalry regiment daring tho
war andattbeelotecf the war cams ont to

was a bad, ruffianly man. and upon the theory
of chances and probabilities, he was quite ;

An attempt was made to arrest and bring to

Booths and Smith. Bat aa yet the Vigilance

The TrSnme's special correspoodcut at the
headquarters of the Saxon army at Champa
telegraphs tbe foUoalog details yoaterday:
Tbe whole Saxon forces encaged in the
recent operations numbered but 10,000 men.
They occupied positions at KoUy Lo Grand,
Cbampa, Gonrnay, Villiere, and in their
vicinity was a division of Wurtembergers,
commanded bv General Obernstz, a Prussian
officer. The Wurtembergcre ocenpied oo*i
lions at Ormesaon, Cbenuevieres. and Noi
seao, and In their vicinity was a brigade of tbs
Second Corps. This force was made up of
contributions from various other portions of
the same corps, and was - commanded by
General Von Fransecky, wbo had nominal di
rection of all the operations, supervised,
bos ever, aa regarded the Saxons, by Prince
George in person, whose beedleesuesa of
danger moat hare sorely tried the nerves ot
fa la staff.
A contingent force supported tho Wuriem
bergets; the Saxons had no backing but their
own valor. In ail, the German troops en
gaged and immediately supporting amounted
to 22.000 men. This fores, it seems, bad been
detailed for an offensive movement, and the.
programme was greatly complicated by the
unexpected counter-offensive movement of
tbe French projected against Vitliem, and
with tbe bopee of ultimately breaking through
tbe cordon surrounding them. It thus hap
pened that, aa tbe Germans were pressing in
to drive the French out of Brie aud Cham-
pigoy, the French were simoltaneonaly pour
ing out to take Villiere.
1 rode into Champa, whither Prince George
bad moved hia headquarters the previous
evening, and found the battle raging fiercely
over the broken country to the aouthweat of
that vflliage. It was in and around these vil
lages, Brie, VilHera, and Chammgtjy, that the
bloody drams was enacted the day before yes
terday. When the curtain fell on that drama*
the Saxons stood fait in Tfiliera iu spite of all
the French tioopa and forts could do todis-
Udsothem. Brie and Champiguy, lying close
ueder the gnns of Fort Nogent, and the
strongly armed earthworks at Baisootrto, ou
the verge of the forest of Vincennes, over
hanging St. Maur, remain in the Lauds of the
French.
On the road that passes through Noisy, tho
south tank of the Marne is low, with a grad
ual rise, furrowed by inconsiderable rectan
gular depressions. As one reaches Noisy,and
locks southward, he secs toward Brie, and
athwart the thick part of the loop of tbo
Marne, a broad, fist space, offering a favora
ble scope for military evolutions. From this
plain toward Vtlliers there rises gradually a
low but shaggy elevation, covered chiefly with
copse-woods and vineyards. This elevation is
not continuous to VilUers. There are occa
sional depressions, debouchments of which
cause the trivial hollows that occur on the
road to Noisy. The general tendency is. nev
ertheless. upward, so that the table-land at
tuo back of which VUliors lies Is
higher than any ground between it and
the plain. The ndge, therefore, though
hampered by hedges of brushwood,- would
form no bad position for resistance to a force
which, having deployed on the plain, ehonld
attempt to carry it. If It wore not swept by
the direct fire from Fort Nogcnt at easy
range, and enfiladed at longer range, but
still effectively, by batteries on Mount Avron.
When I crossed the nver at 9 o'clock. Noisy
was an eligible point from which to observe
operations. Shells from Mont Avron were
coining very thick; now there was a shower
of slates as a shell crashed through a roof,
lifting the solid rafters aa if they were laths;
now half the side of a house west
down bodily as some huge projectile
struck and crashed It. Brie divided
with Noisy tho attentions of the French
batteries, and Brie is more open to attack.
The One Hundred and Seventh Regiment had
made a dash into Brie ont of Boeny early in
the morning, and I wondered much bow it had
fared with them—hard enough, no doubt—but
could they hold tho place under such ding
dong pelting ? By 10 o'clock the Question was
resolved. First came a drove of .French pris
oners, red-breeched regulars, up toward NoUr,
along the slight shelter afferded by the road;
then Saxon soldiers and more prisoner: and
finally, the bulk of the One Hundred
and Seventh in very open order, making the
most of the few opportunities for cover. It
was not a pleasant way to traverse Forts firod
heavily on captors and captured alike. More
.than one Frenchman was slain by missiles
from French weapons.
. As the struggling columns came up, I learn
ed that the One Hundred and Seventh, in a
rapid ru-h in tho morning, bad surprised the
occupants of Brie, some aslcen, others drink
ing coffee. There waa a trifling resistance.
Nearly five hundred prisoners were taken, In
cluding eight officers. forrelin
quisUng Brie was that the terrible, persistent
fire from the forts rendered it utterly unten
able. What this adqaotage represented was
bimplv that Brie gave the French a footing, so
to speak, on the Sixcn mainland, while CTham
rignv formed a key to the peninsula of tho
Marne. Tho object of tbo day on the side cf
the Germans was to dislodge the French from
Brie and Champiguy This task fall to the lot
of the'Saxons, Wnrtemhorgors, and a brigade
of the Second Corns.
accidentally
Tho prisoners looked like sturdy fellows,
ftrtvtbing Lnt ill-fo l. They were hearty and
good to fight. I Judged from the expressions
of a Sergeant He bade me good morning,
and told me cheerily that if anyone indulged
in the anticipation of the speedy capitulation
of Paiis. he was extremely 00l in his reckon
ing: food was plentiful. Be said, with a
laugh, that the programme was, “sorties
every day, In every direction.** The prisoners
were escorted back to Obelles, where, later in.
the day, I saw them penned iu the yard of the
town hall.
As the Prussians from Brio finished filing
through Nosy, an ominous eight met my oyo in
another direction as I peered through a loop
hole I bid contrived there. On the gradual
slope of the further bank of tho Sfarne, un
der the wing of Fort Nogent. and extending
right and left along the Chanmout Railway,
were dense columns of French infantry.
How they came there I know not. It was as'if
tho spectacle had sprung up by magic. Now
they stood fast, closing up u the fronts of
battalions baited. Then there was a slow
movement forward as the head of the column
dipped out of right between the village of
Nogent and the river. Then there seemed to
be a final halt. The dense masses stood, their
bayonets glittering in the enn, as if the men
had come out for a spectacle.
But little by little there was a gradual
trickling off down to the bight of the river
between Nogont and Brie. There was a rail
way bridge (the Cbaumont Railway)—a lofty
viaduct—but a gap in one arch had rendered
it useless. Presently, ou the plain to the
south of Brie, a knot of red-breechea became
visible that grew denser and denser every
mcment. Simultaneously, the whole sprang
into life. From the farm-buildings about Le
Tremblay, from St, and Joinville, there
poured out vast bodies of Freucb troops, de
ploying at double-quick. Tb e line teemed to
extend rightalbwart the neck of the loop of
the river.
At Cbampigny, 1 am informed that the
Wortembergere. after desperate fighting, had
driven the French out not long after 6 o clock,
to be in torn subjected to violent attack and
partial expulsion. The sharp-shooters dashed
into the tnicket, lining tho foot of the rising
ground, and scrambled through. The troops
behind them followed—a serried column.
Whence bad they come ? They bad crossed
duneg the night and occupied the loop. Their
bridges must have boon between Joinville and
Ncgent; and the nullification of Brie enabled
the utilization at a later of a bridge be
tween Brie and the railway viaduct.
The Eois de Grace, lying in front (south) of
Champs, afforded favorable cover for a detour
into the rear of Villiexa. winch, evidently, was
the point for winch the French advance was
•intended. Their force—l refer exclusively to
that section of it that threatened VBUers—•
must bare bees at least 20,000. How largo
was the force with which the Wortembergers
had to deal toward Cbampigny, I had do means
of acertamisg. In those dense columns stand
ing in support under Nogent there cculd not
have been lew than 20,000. There were 20,000
of the left advance, with whom 10,000 Saxons
bad to cope—not with them alone, but with
those temble projectiles, a storm of which
incessantly clashed into the upper ground
where Villiers stand*, and Into the glades be

The French skirmishers were thrown out
with ae much regularity as if the day’s work

were • -ed'with surprising rapidity and

Buttneadrk. e, threatening, as it did, in the
evolution bv» hich it was deployed, to sweep
right on, overlapping Villiers, up the space
between that place and Noisy, and so to get
through upon Champs, called for other tac
tics. Tdliers could only serve as a position on
which to lean the Saxon left: it became necee
t&rv to meet the French in the open space.
From behind Villiers several (German) regi
ments came out to the right of the brow of
the kill under the shell-fire. As the French
came up the gentle acclivity, the guns of the
forts continued playing without interruption.
So narrow was the margin between the .com
ba'ants, tb** I question much whether a shell
or two did not fall in the French ranks. I
stood by the One Hundred and Eighth R?gi
ment as it quitted a position in which it bad
found some shelter. Two Lieutenants gaily
shook hands with a hussar aid-de-camp who
had just rode up with the order, as they passed
him to go out into the battle. On went the
regiment in dense columns of companies,
shells now crushing into the ranks, now ex
ploding in the intervals.
The line was formed, rear ales dosing up it

fitly yards separated the combatants. Then
came a volley, then sharp firing by file, and
the French broke and gave ground, only to

, All this took place before coon. After e

slackened considerably, The French infantry
made no demonstration. On tbo German left,
however, about Champlgny, It was evident
that bard fighting was going on. About; I

result, but a different policy was this time
sdoptid. It waa’plain that thebnlyeaoape

followed on, aa if they would settle the ques
tion with the bavonet’s point. It was the old
err, Tonrarti, immervonearis" but toe
concert# was vt nr slow.
Wbai happened m the next hour I could
oolv guess by the constant cracking of small
anna; The forts confined themselves, appar
ently for the chief part, to firing into and over
Champlgny and Villi era. At length the
French were slowly and stnbbornly falling
back across the north side of the nock of
land, the Saxons pushing them hard;
tbo French ever and anon rallying.
On this position of the pUm, south of
Brie, there was a prolonged struggle. The
Saxcns were striving to get at and cut the
pontoon bridge ; but tbit became au itapoari

with toe frightful accuracy which the abort

about 8 o'clock, both parties falling back.

V. bat shall I aay of the result ? Kot much
have the Saxons gained. Was there much to
gain? The Wurtcmtergers hold one end of

there were French in it this morning; later,
there were Saxons. That is all. Bat look at
the bloody aide of tbopieture. Tbenumberdead
I cannot ascertain, but the German wounded

Had it been possible for the Saxons to bold
Brie, the French advance would bare been
impossible; Its flanking fire would have pro

The French bad a mitrailleuse somewhere m

In the coart of Common Pleas, trial term,
port H., before Judge Lsrretnore and a jury,
yesterday, the case of ilrizcoli ox. The Chi
cago & Great Eastern Railway Company was
decided. The plaintiff brought suit against
the cefendart to recover the sum of 20,000 for
injuries and loseea sustained by reason ot an
accident on defendent’s railroad. It was al
leged on plaintiff’s behalf that while the
company to which the plaintiff was attached,
known as the Brignoli Opera Troupe, was
travelling on the railroad of defoodent, and
when near the town of Logassport. lad., tbo
car in which they were riding was thrown off
the track and overturned ; that by reason of
the accident the plaintiff sustained a disloca
tion of Hie shoulder and other injuries ; that
ho was thereby disabled for a considerable
time subsequently, and compelled to forfeit
engagements covering a period of four weeks;
that bo was compelled to expened about 1,200
for medical service?, which, with tbo losses
resulting from his forfrriod engagements,
amounted to $20,00). For this amount bo
seeks to recover judgment. With a view ot
showing the value ot the plaintiffs time, it
was proved by Maurice StnTkoficb that plain
tiff's shore of tbo profits for tbo week preced
ing the accident was $2,200, and his entire
share for about three months up to that
time SIO,OOO. In reply to tho question as
to what was tho plaintiff's position m his line
of art. Mr. Stnkosch replied that he was one
of (bo very few tenors in tho world.
The plaintiff in his own behalf testified to
the accident: that bo was brought on by slow
stages to Cincinnati; that ho remained there
for about a week under tbo charge of Surgeons
'Sanderson and Blackman; that m about ton
days he reach New York, and was placed un
der the ca*e of Surgeon Carnocban, who dis
covered that the parts were still displaced ;
that Doctor Carnocban reset tbo broken
hones and bad tho plaintiff under his care for
two months, until out of danger, for which ho
made a chtrgo of $1,200. Plaintiff further
testified that his professorial earnings for the
season up to the time of the accident wore
$23,000.
Surgeon Carnocban testified to The nature
of the accident, attendance and reasonableness
of the charge.
At the conclusion of the plaintiff's testi
mony the defendant moved for s dismissal
of the complaint on the ground that plaintiff
bad foiled to show tho corporate character of
the defendant; that he had failed to show
that the accident was due to any defect in too
road or rolling stock, and that, without such
proof, the company not being insurers, bo
could not recover. This motion was denied.
Judge Larromore holding, in conformity with
tbo law as laid downin •everal similar cases,
that where a car runs off tbo track it will be
presumed that the accident is duo to some
defect, in the absence of proof to the con
trary.
Defendants read testimony taken on com*
mission, tending to show that the accident was
the result of a broken nit; that such rail was
broken immediately at the time of the acci
dent, and showed no sign of any defect, and
so far as could be discovered, tho rood was in
good runirg'older. In opposition to this,
testimony was offered on the part of plaintiff,
showing that Uis iron nil was traperfoct, and
had boos broken into several pieces.
Judge Larrcmtre. in submitting the cause
to the jury, charged that if the accident was
the result of causes over which the com
pany had no power, they were not liable ; but,
on tbo other hand, if tho acrident was not
apparently tho result of a freshet, or some
similar cause over which they bad no control,
it was prima facie evidence of the company’s
ncglict-i.ee. lie furtlu-r charged that no con
tiibniivc negligence had been shown on the

WaiMn'TfoH (Dr** S ) Cvrretjxnvitnee of (ke Xne }'ork
Joxrmat of Commerce,
For some two rears past seveial prominent
g(-otlemen in both Booses of Congress,
have exerted themselves to bring about :
& resumption of specie payments. The i
efforts wer pnt form with energy, bat no
plan was suggested that suited the tastes of j
a majority, aid me subject wont over from '
one session to another, till now. It was be- I
bared by tbo advocates of tbe project, who
were reinforced by a considerable number of I
strong men in tbe respective Boases, that
there was strength enough to pass seme kind
of a bill this winter. Accordingly, on Tues
day, General Garfield called a meeting
of tie Banking and Currency Com
mittee for Wednesday. with a view of
informally discussing tbe subject, in order to
ascertain bow far it would go. what plana
were afoot, and whether a joint plan could
be got out of the committee and placed in tbe
Boose. Tbe committee met. It did not take
many minutes, however, to show that
while every member of the commit*
too was m favor of resuming at
tbe earliest possible moment, each bad
his particular theory; some held to them with
boll-dog pertinacity, and the development of
opinions showed a chaotic entanglement. To
make the matter worse it was found that the
question had boon informally canvassed
amorg the principal members of the Bouse
and Senate in a quiet way, and the deeper it
probed tbe worse it got.
Finally, it was found that the committee
would, if the question were pnt, come to a
sensible conclusion, tjz , to let the nroblem of
the method of resuming specie payments
worn itself out, if it will do so before next
winter. This was on the ground that the pre
mium on gold Is gradually lessening, I
and the value of government
paper increasing in the same ratio, and i
that the pjobabilitics are a result of
tbe land desired may be more easily reached ,
next winter than it can during this ecsaon of
Congress. The language of General Garfield
seems to state it more positively: “In other
words, we will then have more cable to take
our measurements from.” It will be realized
that this settles the question now, so far as
tbe Bouse' is concerned, and we may safely
dhmUe itfor nearly a year.
THE FLASS WHEBEDI GOLD STTAT-T- BE SLIDE THE
emnever or the comcrur.
In tbe Committee on Backlog and Currency
yesterday It was found that eomo plans and
propositions w»re well received. Among these
were Mr. IcgcnoU's hobby, to declare a cer
tain per cent of legal-tenders receivable in
payment of easterns dues. To stiffen bank
reserves by forcing the gold payments on
coupons of bonds held as security for circa
latlon, acd gradually by various acts to drive
tbe greenbacks from sight and throw the bur
den of resumption on the banks. Opposite
from this, to have,by judicious legislation, tbe
backs resume wiin the government.
And now, to leave that committee. Senator
Sumner says, resume at once, first, by destroy
ing all fractional currency; second, when

THE EAMSEY-ESIE WAE.
peciaion of (be .’Vow Vorlc Supreme
Coart*
From the h'ete York Dee. 9.
Two appeals. in as many actions, entitled
The Ene Baiiway Company vs. Joseph H.
Bamicr and others, hare just boan decided
by the Supreme Court at General Term, held
by llesioing Justice Ingraham and Jua'ice
Cardczo. The drat case was an appeal from
the order confirming the report of the referee
and imposing a fine of $6,000 on Mr. Ramsey
by way of punishment for contempt of Court,
for disobedience of an injunction. The sec
ond case waa an appeal from an oraer adjudg
ing Hr. Ramsey in contempt and ordering a
referee.
The first action was brought for the pur*
pose of preventing tho defendant Ramsey and
others from taking any farther proceedings in
an action in which Ramsey was plaintiff and
the Erie Bailway Company and others were
defendants, and from any other proceedings
m any other salt for a similar purpose, and for
other relief. An injunction was granted re*
straining the defendants “from proceeding
any further in the action in which J, H. Run
eey was plaintiff and the Erie Hallway Com*
pauy. J. Gould, and others were defendants,
and from commencing any other action for a
similar purpose." and from doing other mat*
ters not material to be referred toon this mo*
tion. This injunction was served on the de
fendant Ramsey, November 25, 1869. This
action was commenced in a different dis- :
txict from that in which the former
action was pending. On the Ith of
December, papers on behalf of the plaintiff
' Ramsey were served on defendants’ attorney,
including copies of affidavits, an order for
eat tlUnted service on some of tho defendants,
and au order to show cause at a subsequent
day why the order thereafter granted in the
same should cot be continued. On tbe bear
ing of this motion the orders asked for were
granted by tbe Court. On tho Gtb of Decem
ber an order was granted in this action re
quiring Ramsey to show cause why ho should
nut be ptmUhed for contempt, and qu the
hearing of that motion be was adjudged guilty
of acon'empt in disobeying the injunction
order, and a reference was ordered to ascer
tain the damages. A report was made by the
referee that the damtges sustained by the
plaintiffs were $5,225, which report was con-
Unncd and a fine to that amount was imposed
from which order tho defendants appealed.
iMißauax. J P There are some proposi
tions connected with tbe proceedings to pun
ish far a contempt in disobeying the order of
a court which are well settle !, and which are
ueccsarry to a right disposition of this ap
peal. The first is that the propriety of the
order disobey* d is cot to be reviewed on this
appeal t second, upon a motion to puoi*U
fer the violation of the injunction, the Court
will not examine the merits of the case, nor
permit a defendant to duobev an injunction
regularly issued, whatever man bo tha final
decision thereon. (2Paige p. 326;) third,
even an erroneous order must be stayed un
til set aside by the Court, if the Court has
jurisdiction to grant tbe order. (9th New
York, p. 263.) If the Coart has jurisdiction
to grant tho order,it is the duty of the
party to obey it, and the only rente- 1
dy tbe party injured has is to
appeal from tho order. (IS Abb., p. 215.)
These principles, wbicharo well settled, dis
pose of so much of this appeal as seeks to 1
reverse the order adjudging tha defendant
guilty of contempt, becanse tbe original order
was erroneous. It only remains, therefore, to
inquire whether the Coart had jurisdiction to
grant tbe injunction, and whether the de
fendant in the motion to punish him for con
tempt showed any excuse to relieve him from
punishment. The question of jurisdiction to
grunt such an injunction has been ex
amined by the General Term of this dis
trict, in Scnell cs. Tbe Erie Ralroad Com*
E&ny, 51 Barb., p. 368. There it was
eld that an order made in one ac
tion of this court, forbidding the prosecu
tion of another suit in tha same court,
was absolutely void, and that anybody might
lawfully disregard it. But at a recent general
term the decision in this case was reviewed,
and the expressions referred to were modified
eo as to bold each injunction merely Irregu
lar ; and at tho present general term tbe in
junction referred to had been vacated on ap
peal aaurecultr, and not denying the juris
diction of the court to grant it iu the first in
stance. lam also of the opinion tnat the
proof before tbe referee that tbe defendant
acted under tho advice of counsel, who were
certainly competent to give advice on which a
layman might rely, relieves the case from the
supposition that any wilful disobedience of
the injunction was intended, and if so. that
tho defendabt was not to toffer positive dam
•pee tor bis disregard of (ho order. If be
was liable at all, it was for the costa
necessarily incurred in enforcing
obedience to tbe injunction. In the
present cate, tbe damages allowed appear to
have been the cents incurred in the action
pending in the Sixth District, in which pro.
ceedings were enjoined. Such costs could
not bo considered as costs to bo paid in this
action. The costs which the defendant should
pay arc tbe coats and expenses of prosecuting
for the contempt, and not tbo?e incurred in
tbe action in which tbe proceedings were en
joined. Wo think tbe amount of the fine
should be reduced to a sum sufficient to cover
each costs’, and a counsel fee, which are fixed
at $250. and for that sum the order is
affirmed, without costs of appeal.
In the other caseof The Erie Railway Com
pany rs Joseph H. Ramsey ct a/., the Oeu
etafTerm say‘‘the appeal from the order ad
judging the defendant in contempt, and di
recting a reference, wan prematnrclv taken,
and should be dismissed with $lO coats.”

lm County, Indiana, ffor Trial—
XV bo and Whftt Hie Principal! arc*
CtooltiUf, Jiul. ( Dee. 7), Correy-ondenee of the
Cincinnati Enquirer.
It •will doubtless be rcmembticd that on
Monday, the fif.h day of last September,
Thomas Harrifon was shot and hilled m Sian*
cluster Township, Dearborn County. this
State, by McDonald Cheek, bis son-indan-.
Mr. Harrison was what might be considered
the aristocratic farmer of that locality, being
looked np to by hia neighbors as a mau with
out a superior as regards business integrity
or social respectability. Cn the other band.
Cheek was always considered a wild, reckless
fellow, but cot exactly what might be termed
a “ dare-devil.'’ as his previous actions
proved him to be devoid of that man
ly courage which would instigate a man
to openly and unflinchingly attack a man who
had, or he fancied had (which acts with the
same impetus iu the man seeking revenge),
done him an injury sufficient to Justify a per
sonal assault. As an evidence of this fact, it
is stated that Cheek, on one Occam cm, after
making three attempts to waylay a neighbor,
quietly accepted an invitation from that gen
tleman to nde home in his buggy, when, on
the third attempt, be met the man he sought.
The cause of the trouble between Cheek and
Harrison, aa explained by the friends of the
latter—and they apparently number all the
citizens of tbe township in which Mr. Ham
son lived, except the friends of Cheek (and
they decline to state anything in regard to
the affair)—to lo altogether imaginary. It
se< ms that some five yean since Cheek, then
but 17 years of age. married Jennie Harrison,
aged 16, daughter of tbe murdered mau. in
direct opposition to the wishes of her parents.
The laoy was considered, m accomplishments
and social standing, much the superior of her
bnsbsnd. It does not appear that yonng
Cheek had borne a vicious reputation previous
to bis marriage, but that be was considered
very “wild," and net in any respect tbe equal
of his wife. Tbe young people, however,
eloped and were married, the laws in tbla
State not being so prohibitory in the case of
miners as in Ohio.
After tbe marriage, however, Mr Harrison
showed a disposition to forgive young Cheek,
and receive mm with all the friendship usually
exteeded to eons-in-law. Check and his bnde
each possessed some means independent of
their relatives, he baring s very good farm
about a mile and a half {mm Mr. HamsooV.
and ehe baring abont $2,500 in money, left
her bv her grandmother.
MrfHameon, who was considered one of
tbe most intelligent and provident farmers in
the country, volunteered bis assistance to
start the jougcoopleon their journey through
life, and personally aided Cheek lo purchas
ing fanning implements, Ac., and so far as
we could ascertain be continued to do all in
nis power to belo them along and comprom
ise the troubles* arisirg between Cheek and
bis wife, which commenced within a rear of
their marriage. All efforts to this end. bow.
ever, proved unavailing, and only served to
engender in the heart of Cheek an almost
fiendish hatred of his father-in-law, who he
acknowledged was his best friend, but always
added that he hated him, and frequently as
serted that he would kill him.
'Without following in detail the growth of
tbe hostile feeling, we will carry our readers
to the day of the murder. It was about 1
o'clock that Mr. Harrison, who lived six mQea
from Aurora, and about eight miles from
Lawrecceburg. on a township road running
from tbe'Hogan Creek Road to the Manches
ter Pike, was leaving his residence in a buggy,
en route for Aurora, and when some three
hundred yards distant frem tbe bouse, he met
Cheek anil a man named Omar S. Bailey, in a
buggy. Cheek and his wife bad been board
ing' with a widow named Clem, m Aurora, and.
after one of their quarrels,, separated, a»u
Mrs. Cheek went to a neighbor of her father a
to board, her father agreeing to p*£*9 e

when they met Mr. Harrison it is probable
that they were somewhat under its influence,
although not sufficiently so to obscure their
reason! o any reasonable extent. Cheek and
pailey, after driving past Ur. Harrison a short
diet* nee, dirxnotmted from their boggy, and
Mr. EL, tearing they intended injury to his
family, did likewise. - At-this moment. Dr. T.

ta Miachwter, rode up on horseback, and

being charged with murder in the drat degree.
Had it not been for the unswerving cer.v

there is not tbe least doubt but that Cheek
and Bailey (the latter being considered equal

especially for the nerve and discretion he

citizens to lynch them.

When the Senatorial caucus met to-day and
Mr. Chandler reported tbs Hat of committee*.
Senators for the lint time &»w that Mr. Chanc
ier bad abandoned ids raid on Mr. Sctmrz only
for another point equally as valuable to the
President. Mr. Patterson was dropped from
the Committee on Foreign Relations and Mr.
Codling enhsUtated* The former was op
posed to San Domingo, and the ocher eras m
favor of it.
The moment the committees wore announc
ed, Mr. Sumner toee to bis feet and opened
fire upon the report for attemptin&to pack
his committee against him. and carry through
the San Domingo treaty, lie pronounced the
movement as a wanton insult to the Senate,
and an unparalleled attempt to control the
committee by removing & Senator whose char
acter was unexceptionable, and upon whom
there was an attempt to put s mark of want of
confidence. He was authorized to say that
the movement was so considered by Mr. Pat
ter>on.
Mr. Chandler attempted to defend bis re*
port, aud gave as bis reason that Mr. Fitter*
sen was to be chairman of another commit*
tee. and they thought they bad a right to
make a committee in harmony with the Exec
utive upon his forign policy; and for that rea
son he wanted to put in a man like Mr. Conk*
ling, who could successfully grapple with Mr.
Sumner, who had been running the committee
in his own Interest, and (regardless ot the
wishes of others. He dented that there was
anv desire to express any want of confidence
in Mr. Patterson, and indicated that he would
not be ignored hy the administration.
Mr.- Conkling was not present, and Mr. Fat*
tereon said he had no desire to serve on any
other committee, if removed from the Foreign
Relations Committee, which be bad made a
study, and in which he had felt a deep inter
est. He did regard his removal as an offen
sive attack, and he wanted it understood that
bo was not to be fed on crumbs from the
White House by the hands of tbo Senator from
Michigan.
Mr. Trumbull opposed the attempted change,
as creating a breech that woold not he easily
healed. lie denied the right of the caucus to
remove a Senator for no canes at all, when
that change was unpleasant to the Senator.
ilr. Wilson hoped the report would be with
drawn. He had voted for San Domingo, but
he coaid not consent to ench s movement in
its interest, and he accordingly moved tore
commit the report, with instructions to restore
thelnamo of Mr. Patterson to the Committee
os Foreign Relations.
It was carried by a two thirds vote, and at a
subsequent caucus Mr. Conkling disavowed
any dee Ire to go on the committee and dts
j |«ce Mr. Patterson. This has damaged Mr.
Chandler and San Domingo con.-iderably, hot
has not altered the determination of its
friends to try and force it through.
