to resist I suppose it will not bt
denied that many claims fo pension
are made without merit and that
many have been allowed oa fraudulent
representations This has been de
clared from the Pension Bureau not
only in this but in prior administra

of any svstem for the distribution of
pensions depends on the equality and
uniformity operation it will be
seen from the report of the Commis

Government one hundred and thirty
one different rates of pensions
He estimates from the best informa

who have served in the army and navy
of the United States are now support

of those in tie soldiers home under

UDOR AND CAPITAL
The relations of labor t capi

the country are jeapordlztd Any in
tervention ol the general overumeut
within the limits of this COI t IloDal
authority to avert such a condition
bould be willingly accorded In a
pedal message transmitted to Con
gress at Its last session I suggested
the enlargement of our present Labor
Bureau and adding to Its pres
ent functions the power ol
arbitration in cases where difference
arise between cinployis anti employ
ers When these differences reach
such a stage as to result in the Inter
ruption sJt commerce between the
Sates the application of this remccb
vy the general government might be
regarded as entirely within its constitutional

reasonably hope that such arbitration

FUEEDMENS AFFAIRS
I desire to call the attention of Con
gress to t plain duty which the gov
ernment owes to the depositors In the
Freedman Savings and Trust Com
pany This company was chartered by
Compress for the benefit of the most
illiterate and humble of our people
and with the intention of encourag
ing In them industry and thrift
Branches were presided over by oU
cers holding the commissions and
clothed with the uniform of the United
Slatcsriheseand other circumstances
reasonably I think led these Isimpk
people to suppose that the Invitation
to deposit their hard earned stings
Iu this institution implied an under
ucler
taking on the part of their government
that their money should be safely kepi
for them When this company failed
It was liable In the sum of SiKWjftW 22
to GI3l depositors Dividends mount
lug iu the aggregate to sixty per cent
have been declared and the sum
called for and paid of such dividends
seems to bj 101818172 This sum
deducted from the entire amount of
deposit leaves l 91 liH 0 still un
paid Past experience has shown that
luKe a large part of this sum will not
be called for There are assets still on
baud amounting to the estimated sum
of 510000 I think the remaining
thirtyeight per cent of such
of these deposits as have claim
ants conld be paid by the govern
mcnt upon principles of equity and
fairness The report of the commis
sioner soon to be laid before on
ress will gIve more satisfactory de

fnisiiiici or COICMHIA
The control ol the affairs of the Cis
ttictof Columbia having been placed
In the bands of purely executive of
ficers while Congress still retains all
legislative authority relating to its
goxermnent it becomes my duty lg t
make known t the most pressing
needs of the dlslilct and recommend
their consideration The laws of tbe
district l appear to be in an un
certain and unsatisfactory con
dition and their codification or
revision is mncu needed Dnting the i
past year one of the brhlees leading
mom the district to the State of Vir
ginia became until for use and travel
unlt tmc
upon It was forbidden This leads me
to iiiruest that tl e improvement of all
the bridges t crossing the Potomac and
its branches from the city of Wash
ington is worthy the attention of Con
gress The commissioners ol the dis
trict represent that the laws regulat
ing the sale of 1quor and granting li
censes therefor should be at once
amended and that legisla
tion Is needed to consolidate
define and enlarge the scope
and power of charitable
and penal institution within the ditricu
I suggest that tbe commits toners l > c clothed
willi the power to make willim fixed limi
tation police regulation I believe this
lover granted and carefully guarded
gare
would tend to Mibcrve the good order of
orer
tbe municipality It teems b trouble I
exists growing ont of the occupation of
the streets and avenues by ccrtairr rail
li
roads taxing their termini I In the city
It is very important that Furl laws
should be enacted mxm this subject
a will secure to the railroads all the
facilities they require for the iranaction
of their buines and at the same time
protect citizens from injury lo their persons
or pronertr The commissioners again
complain that the accommodation afforded
hem for the necessary offices for district
iuuness and for the aiekeeplngof valuable
r
books and papers are entirety inititUcicnt I
recommend that this condition ot affairs be
remedied by Conrrtfn FI and that suitable
luartcrs befninUned for the needs of the

IX CONCLUSION
J earnestly invoke such wise action on the
