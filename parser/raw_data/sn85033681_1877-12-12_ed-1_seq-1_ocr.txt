PRESIDENT HATES' MESSAGE.
The President submitted bts first
annual message to Congress oo the
3d inst. It is a lengthy document,
devoted much to moralizing and
philosophising, but en the whole a
decided improvement on the State
papers which have e ruinated from
the executive daring the last eight
years.
The President's reference to his
Snthern policy and the beneficial
effects which it has produced, is pro
bably the most satisfactory part of
his message, and affords a pleasing
guarantee that the era of hate and
the bloody &hirt in politics is about
passed away, .
In discussing the currency the
President leans to the side of the
money power. He says :
In any legislation providing for a sil
ver coinage, regulating its value and im
parting to it the quality of legal tender,
it seems to me of great importance that
Congress should not lass sight of its
action, in operating in a two-fold capaci
ty and in two distinct directions. If the
United States Government was free from
public debt, its legislative dealing with
the question of silver coinage would be
purely sovereign and governmental un
der no restraints but those of constitu
tional power and the public good as
affected by the proposed legislation, but
in the actual circumstances of the nation,
with a vast public debt distributed very
widely among our own citizens and held
to a great extent also abroad, the nature
of the silver coinage measures, as alteet
ing the relation of this Government to
the hslders of the public debt, becomes
a matter, in any proposed legislation, of
the highest concern. The obligation of
the public faith transcends all questions
of profit or public advaatage. Other
wise its unquestionable maintenance is
the dictate, as well as of the highest ex
pediency, as of the most necessary duty,
and will be carefully guarded by Con
gress and the people alike. The public
debt of the United States to the amount
of $729,000,000 bears interest at the rate
of six per cent. ; $708,000,000, at the rate
of five per cent., and the only way in
which the country can be relieved from
the payment of these high rates of inter
est, is by advantageously refunding the
indebtedness. Whether the debt is ul
timately paid in gold or in coin is of but
little moment compared with the possi
ble reduction of the interest one-third
by refunding it at such reduced rates.
If the United States had the unquestion
able right to pay its bonds in silver coin
the little benefit from that process would
be greatly overbalanced by the injuri
ous effect of such payment, if made or
proposed against the honest convictions
of the public credit.
It is a matter of congratulation, says
the President, that notwithstanding the
severe burdens caused by the war, the
public faith with all creditors has been
preserved, and that as a result of this
policy, the public credit has continu
ously advanced and our public securi
ties Are regarded with the highest favor
in the markets of the world. I trust no
act of the Government will cast a shadow
upon its credit. The progress of refund
ing the public debt has been rapid and
satisfactory. Under the contract exist'
ing when I entered upon the discharge
of the duties of my office, bonds bear
ing interest at the rate of 4 per cent.
were being rapidly sola, ana witmn
three months the aggregate sales of
these bonds had reached the sum of
$200,000,000. With my sanction the
Secretary of the Treasury entered into a
new contract for the sale of four per
cent, bonds, and within thirty days after
the popular subscription for such bonds
was opened, subscriptions were had
amounting to $70,496,560, which were
paid for within ninety days after the
date of subscription. By this process,
within but little more than one year,
the annual interest of the public debt
was reduced in the sum of $3,775,000. I
recommend that suitable provision be
made to enable people to convert their
savings into Government securities, as
the best made in which small savings
may be well secured and yield interest.
It is the object of public policy to retain
among eur own people the securities of
the United States. In this way our
country is guarded against their sudden
return from foreign countries, caused
by war or other. disturbances beyond
our limits.
The tone of the message upon the
civil service question is not calculat
ed to give much comfort to Repub-
ican extremists of the Senate. The
President gives no evidence of his
tention to yield to the implacables.
He sijs :
My experience in the executive duties
iss strongly confirmed my belief in the
great advantage the country would find
in observing strictly the plan of the Con
stitution which imposes upon the execu
tive the sole duty and responsibility of
the selection of these Federal officers,
who, by law are appointed, not elected,
and which in like manner assigns to the
Senate the complete right to advise and
consent to or to reject the nomination so
made, whilst the House of Representa
tives as the public censor of the per
formance of official duties with the pre
rogative of investigating and punishing
all cases of dereliction. The blemishes
and imperfections in the civil service
may, as I think, be traced, in most cases,
to a political confusion of the duties as
signed to the several departments of the
Government. My purpose, in this re-
spect, has been to return to the systemJ -
established by the elemental law, and
to do this with the heartiest co-operation
most cordial understanding with
the Senate and House of Representa
tives. Referring to the public revenues,
the President says :
The revenue of the Government dur
ing the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877,
ws $269,000,586.62. The total expendi
tures for the same period were $233,660,
008.92, leaving a surplus revenue' of
$30,340,577 69. This has substantially
supplied the requirements of the sinking
fund for that year. The estimated rev
enue for the current fiscal year is
$265,500,000, and the estimated expendi
tures for the same period are $232,430,
643.72. If these estimates prove to be
correct, there will be a surplus revenue of
$33,069,356.28, an amount nearly suffici
ent for the sinking fund for thaj year.
The estimated revenues for the next
fiscal year are $269,250,000. It appears
from the report that during the last
fiscal year the revenues of the
Gevernment, compared with the
previous year, have largely decreased.
This decrease, amounting to the sum of
$18,481,452.54, was mainly in customs
duties, caused partly .by the large
falling off in the amount of imported du
tiable goods, and partly by the general
fall of prices in the markets of produc
tions of such articles as pay ad valorem
taxes. While this is felt injuriously in
the diminution of the revenue, it has
been accompanied with a very large in
crease of exportations. The total exports
during the last fiscal year, including coin,
have been $653,637,457, and the imports
have been $492,097,540, leaving a bal
ance of trade in favor of the United
States amounting to the sum of $166,539
919, the beneficial effects of which ex
tend to all branches of business.
The message also gi ves due at
tention to our foreign relations, the
army, the strikes, the navy, the
Postoffice Department, the Depart
ment of Justice, the timber lands,
agriculture, the District of Columbia
and public education, but the Presi
dent's views upon these subjects are
not of special interest to the gen
eral public.

to Europe.
From the New Orleans Ximea .
The New Orleans Cotton Ex
change is taking steps to send Gen.
John B. Gordon, United States Sen
ator from Georgia, to Europe, when
the regular session of Congress closes
next spring, as an ambassador of the
material interests of the Xew South,
to invite the attention of the Old
World to the fact that these fertile
States are now finally , pacified, re
organized on a free labor basis, and
are consequently anxious to receive
and to foster Europeau capital and
labor.
This idea is a happy one and can
not but r3ultin great and far reach
ing good. The more formality with
which the visit can be surrounded r
the better. It should be made an
event equal in importance to the
visit of the Emperor of Brazil to this
country.- The formal receptiois
which ware tendered to him attract
ed the attention of our people to his
country and as a legitimate result
we see a general demand for the
promotion of commercial ' relations
with Brazil. The selection of Gen.
Gordon for such a mission is very
wise. He happily unites in his per
son the qnalities of an ideal fighting
confederate with those of a civil
ieaderof the progressive tendencies
of the new South which looks to the
future as contradistinguished from
the old South, which fell with slavery
While thoroughly representative or
this section, he is warmly admired
at the North, and his mission, will
be one of conciliation. The North
will rejoice to honor him and second
the move.
If General Gordon can bo sent to
Europe with sufficient eclat he will,
at the Paris Exposition and other
places, do a great work towards at
tracting attention to our resources.
It will be a magnificent and success
ful advertisement of the fact that we
are out of the slough of despond and
full upon the highway ef material
progress.
SLANDER.
BT. MILFORD BARD.
What is Slander T
Tis an askabriw at the midbioht hour
Urged ou by Envt, that, with rooTSTir soft,
Steals on the slumber of sweet innocence,
And with the dark drawn dagger of the itmv,
Drinks deep the crimson current of the hkajbt .
It is a worm, that crawls on beauty's cheek.
Like the vile vipkb in a vale of flowekj),
And biots iu ambrosial blossoms there.
It is a OOWA3D lu a coat of mail.
That wages war against the brave, and wise.
And, like the loso lkan lizard, that will mar
The lion's sleep, it wouuds the noblest breast.
Oft have I seen this Devon of the soul,
This mukdekeb of sleep, with vinsiOE smooth.
And countenance, Berene as heaveu's own sit ,
But STOBiis were raviug in the world of thought ;
Oft have I seen a smile upon its brow ;
But like the liohtnino from a stormy cloud,
It shocked the son and disappeared in darkness.
Oft have I seen it weep at tales of woe,
And sigh, as 'twere the heart would break with
t anguinh;
But, like the drop, that drips from Java's tree,
AaA the full blast, that sweeps Arabian sands,
WIZBEJiKD ITIST FLOWEB of the TALK.
I saw it tread upon the lillt fair.
A maid, of whom the world could say no bisk,
And when she suwa beneath the mortal wound,
It broke into the sacred hkpulchrk,
And dragged its victim from the hallowed grave
Fcr public eyes to gaze on . It hath wept,
That, from the earth, its victim passed away,
Ere it had taken vexgenck on his virtues.
Yea, I have seen this cuhked child of Exvr,
Breathe mildew on the sacred fame of him.
Who once had been his cou.ntkt'b benecactob,
And, on the sepulchre of his hepose,
Bedewed with many a tributary tear,
Disci, in the moonuoui .f a Summer's sky,
With 8AVAOE SATISFACTION. . . .
Leayes of Gold.
Oue night whe the earth wa3 si
lent that the footfalls of the guardian
angels who passed to and fro could
almost be heard, and when the
grand canopy of Heaven blazed with
bright stars, an old man who had
his bed on the grass under a lone
tree on the commons awoke with
a shiver. The chill night air had
crept through his faded and worn
garments, and pinched his flesh.
He sat up and looked about him
with that longing expression in his
eyes which comes only when men
feel that the earth is fast passing
away from them forever. He had
no friends. Even the wandering dog
which passed near him growled an
grily as it caught the flutter of the
old man's rags in the gentle breeze.
When a tree becomes old and
withered and ready to die men des
pise it. They forget the beauty it
held for years, and they give it no
praise for the grateful sha le it offer:
ed to thousands. They would have
its shade and strength and beauty
endure forever, forgetting, that ever
living thing must grow older day by
day and at last die.
Men had forgotten all the good
words ever spoken by this old man.
If he had smoothed the rough paths
of the poor if he had turned the
wicked into better paths if his
kind words had filled despairing
hearts with new hopes he had no
credit for it in the heart of men.
They had sneered and scoffed at his
slow step and his many tatters, and
they had laughed in derision as he
fell upon the hard earth. No sailor,
cast upon a lone isle in the great
ocean, seeing ships sailing to and
fro, but none ever turning toward
him, could have felt such isolation
as this old man felt. With his long
.gray locks with his rags and tat
ters with his wounded and aching
heart with his knowledge that his
hours were cumbered he turned
his pale face to the bright stars and
mused :
"When the leaves flutter down I
shall die, and like them I shall be
forgotten by all rren. They will
bury me, but they will not mark my
grave. They may write my name
in a book out no one will ever turn
to it. Let me die to-night; let me
be no more when the golden leaves
flutter down to the chilly earth 1"
Shivering in the keen air of the
midnight he held his face in his
hands and pondered aud prayed.
Few hearts had sinned less, even
when smarting under the sense of
the world's ridicule and neglect
few hearts had deeper longing for
the blessed rest of heaven. By and
by the air no longer chilled him.
He grew warmer and his old heart
grew larger, and as sleep came
back to his eyelids he whispered :
'If I ever wronged one human
being in God's great world may
the angels forgive me !"
The frost was creeping onward
from the north creeping over hill
tops and orchards aod meadows so
softly that the blades of grass hard
ly quivered. It crept to the tree
and lingered for a moment in its
branches. The graen leaves shiver
ed, then the green faded away, little
by little, and lo I each leaf was rob
ed in gold 1 They quivered in their
joy and glandnessasthe breeze whis
pered : ,
'The old man below you is dead 1
lie was ; waiting for these golden
robes to come ; to you. I will waft
you down, and you shall cover his
grey head with such a crown as no
king ever wore."
And while the leaves were float
isg down to glorify what men had
despised an angel In Heaven turn
ed the golden page of a book and
wrote : "Earth has seut auother
soul to dwell with U3 and find eter
nal joy and peace l'
An Anecdote of Ben Franklin.
In 1723 or 1724, when Franklin
was new in Philadelphia, he found
employment at his trade of printer
with a man of the name of Kelmer.
Mr. Kelmer was a well-meaning man,
but given to be visionary and unsta
ble, and very apt to leave the minor
affairs of his business at loose ends.
Especially in the matter of proof
reading was he careless, and Frank-lin,-whose
habits of care in those lit
tle things lead him to worriment
over his master's dereliction, sought
to correct him in this respect.
He urged upon him the necessity
of accuracy in all departments of his
profession. There could be no such
thing fn being too careful.
" Pooh ! pooh !" cried Kelmer.
"I never make niy great mistakes.
Little typographical errors now and
then are expected."
" But." said Franklin, "what you
may be pleased to term a very slight
typographical error, might make a
most ridiculous exposure."
" Oh, never fear."
Not very long after that. Franklin
thought he would give his master a
! practical demonstration. A primer,
then recently published in New Eng
land was being reprinted in the office
A paraphrase in verse of the fifteenth
chapter of Corinthians had been set
up and in looking over the form be
fore he struck off a proof-sheet for
his master to read, found the follow
ing verse :
When the last trumpet saundeth,
We shall not all die;
But we shall be changed
In the twinkling of an eye.
Under the impulse of the moment
he took a bodkin and pulled out the
c, and spaced out tho line. Then he
struck off the proof and carried it to
Mr. Kelmer to read, and went home
to his supper. Whether Franklin
thought of the matter again or not I
do not know; but when the primer
was published there was a verse in
it reading like this :
When the last trumpet soundeth,
We shall not all die;
But we shall be hanged
In the twinkling of an eye.
Shortly after Mr. Kelmer was seen
tearing away among the old proof
sheets, te see if the trick had not
been played after the proof had been
read ; but he found the error at the
start, aud was forced to admit that
he had carelessly overlooked it.
THE LITTLE BROWN STOCKING.
BY HKLEN M. COOKK.
Here is a little brown stocking,
Faded by many years,
Hidden among my treasures,
Stained with many tears ;
It hung in a chimney corner,
On a Christmas long ago,
Loaded with precious goodies,
Full from top to toe.
Two chubby hands unloaded
The gifts of Santa Glaus ;
Oh, how his black eyes sparkled !
Aud surely there was cause.
You see that little hole there ?
There's where a horse was tied
So heavy that it tore it,
s And big enough to ride.
No soldier was ever prouder
With war-horse most superb
Than he on hia rocking pony.
With saddle, whip aud curb.
Oh, that was the merriest Christmas,
Aud he the Jolliet boy,
And this is the sweetest memory
I ever shall enjoy !
The red leaves of the autumn
Lie dead above him now ;
The prattling lips are silent.
His hands are cold as snow.
Naught but the little stocking
Is left of that glad day ;
The stocking and the memory

No Break in the South.
The most sanguine searcher for a
break in the solid South must admit
that the out-look is not premising
In all of the State where indepen
dent movements were started the ad
vocates of them have been bullied
into quiescence by the shouts and
threats of the Burbons. At present
there is not a crack to be seen any
where. The whole section stands as
one man for out-and-out Democratic
men and principles. Furthermore,
it stands as one man for unlimited
silver, for the indefinite postpone-,
ment of resumption, for the reduc
tion of the army, for subsidies, aud
for unlimited appropriations for in
ternal improvement. There is here
and there a newspaper, in the South
which favors honest finance, but it is
as the voice of one crying in the wil
derness. This is a solidity, indeed,
but if the rest of the country fully
realizes what it means, there will be
a mill-stone quality in it for the em
brace Democratic party. ATeio York

ACROSS THE C01WIHENT.
BY EVA WILLIAMS.
Continued from last week.
The weather is fearfully cold, al
though the sun shines in such splen
dor. Omaha i3 still a young city,
for in 1854 a few squatter?, huts were
the only buildings upon the site of
this now flourishing city. It is said
that eo small was the town that its
first post-master improvised an office
in the depths of his "plug hat," this
fully sufficing for a depository for all
the mail. When the wearer of the
"plug" met the fortunate recipient
of a letter down came the post-office,
out came the letter and was duly de
livered to its owner.
None dreamed that in eo short a
time this rude village would be
transformed into a prosperous city,
the initial point of three railroads;
the Union Pacific, the Omaha and
Northwestern, aud Omaha aud South
western. ,
West of Omaha, Nebraska.
After endless trouble aud vexa
tion we are comfortably sealed, hold
ing in auir hands the right and title
to three days journeying in the cen
tre section of this elegant "Pull
man." To this right and title I shall
hold with the clutches of a dying
man, (or woman) for it was procured
through au amount of trouble that
will always mar my memories of
Omaha. Not real trouble either,
but vexation aad bother which ruffle
one's temper, and give rise to more
wicked feelings than actual sorrow.
The latter we accept as frstn the
hand of God, and try to bear pa
tiently, but the "little worries" are
direct from the Plutonian shores,
and are usually received iu a .spirit
truly Plutonic !
To oue of our "through" passen
gers and acquaintances, a kind but
wofully stupid gentleman I entrust
ed the task of procuring our sleeping-car
tickets, a most important ar
ticle, without which it is impossible
to enter the charmed precincts of a
Pullman car. After having been
gone long enough to procure a right
to all the sleeping-cars in Christen
dom, with their conduc ors thrown
in, while our party with frozen toes,
and spirits below zero were kept
waiting in the crowded ante-room of
the cars our gallant procurer re
turned with the doleful news that he
could only obtain for us a "state
room." Why they are so called, un
less it be a "state of sin and misery,"
I am at a loss to conjecture. Into
this dreary abode we were accord
ingly packed, much after the man
ner of sardine, with the prospect of
remaining three mortal days and
nights. M was sorrowful, even
unto tears ; F was indignant
against railroads in the general and
this one in particular, while my own
feelings of mingled sadness and in
dignation are not to be described.
At this juncture, our conductor
with eyes bluer than the summer
skies seeing our "state" came to me,
and kindly offered his berth, until
others should be vacated. A blue-
eyed stranger may Heaven reward
you this generous deed, and may the
railroad increase your wages an hun
dred fold !
Metaphorically "kissing the hem
of his garment" -a handsome blue
cloth with brass button3I joyfully
accepted his offer, while my two
companions showered upon his head
6uch blessings, as only grateful wo
men can. But now comes the revela
tion of " ways that are dark, and
tricks that are vain." After all the
uncomfortable upper berths and
" states of sin and misery " had
been disposed of that patron saint
of a sleeping-car, the porter inform
ed me that they were going to put
on another car, and if I would be
"spry," I might get my ticket ex
changed. " Spry" I was, with the
" spryaess " of despair. Oat into
the ticket office, I reached with head
long speed, where an unhappy crowd
was. assembled, all, like myself, bent
on exchange. It is no trifling thing,
this obtaining comfortable quarters,
for we do not change cars for three
days, and in three days f "state
room " misery I would be lying in
state. After some little delay, and
by the aid f my blue eyed benefac
tor, I become " regina regnans " of
this comfortable domain, which I
shall hold "till the last armed foe
expire?." They appear to have an
easy time, these sleeping-car con
ductors, their principal duty being,
so far as I can observe, to entertain
the ladies. The colored porters do
most of the work, aud I think the
conductor might be easily dispensed
with.
Friday Noon, Jan. 1G.
CnEYENNE, Wyoming.- This is the
largest city between Omaha aud
Ogden, and is situated in a large,
open plain. ,
On the 4th of July, 1.8C9, there
Was only one house in Cheyenne;
while the census two years later
showed a population of three thou
sand. The growth of these western
towns seems like the work f magic
to people reared in au eastern
"Sleepy Hollow," where the erec
tion of a new house, or the advent
of a stranger are notable events.
Later in the day we will enter
Granite Canyon, ascending the
Rocky Mountaius. Soon we reach
Sherman, the highest point on the
mountains over which the railroad
passes, being over 800 feet above the
level of the sea. It was oamtd in
honor of General Sherman, tho
tallest General in the service. Pike's
Peak one hundred and sixty miles
southward, is visible from this point.
Laramie, Wyoming Sunset.
Glorious beyond compare appear
the Rocky Mountains snow-crowned,
but losing their icy coldness in
the roseate tluta borrowed from the
setting sun. How beautiful are these
mountains ! So grand iff their utter
nakedness, with never a tre5 to
shield them from the storm-cloud's
fury. They seem like some noble
fepirit, too proud to ask aid or sym
pathy from any, but secure in its
own strength, challenging the aw
and admiration of the world. It is
a terrible thing, this nature, and
when our minds attempt to conceive
of Him, whose omnipotence could
call from nothingness such a scene
as our eyes now behold, we are lost,
overpowered by his awful grandeur.
Laramie is notable as being the
first place in America, where females
sat upon a jury, leaving their sub
missive (?) lords at home to sing,
Nice Uttle baby, dout get iu a fury,
'Cause Mama's gone to Bit on a jury."
Here we see the first Chinaman
that ever our Christian eyes rested
upon, and those who see John for
the first time, will not wonder that I
neglected the tempting supper to
gaze upon the tawny "celestial,"
who hops hither and thither with an
agility that is strange to see. His
wooden shoes seem to be not the
least hindrance to him, but on the
contrary, he treads as lightly as if
he wore the glass slipper of Cinder
ella. What a queer stretchy look he
has about his eyes as if they were
cut the wrong way of the cloth I
How cold it is, and yet how beauti
fully clear. Snow snow every
where ! My eyes are almost blinded
by the shining whiteness of the
snow-enveloped earth. To-morrow
night we reach Ogden, whero we
leave the Union for the Central Pa
cific road.
Saturday Afternoon, )
January, 17. y
Good-bye books, and everything
within the cars, while we rush out
upon the platform to gaze upon a
scene whose sublime beauty makes
language seem but a mockery. Huge
granite rocks rise almest perpendi
cularly upon either side of the road,
while we human pigmies stand awe
struck in their presence. The first
of these mighty monuments that at
tracts our attention, is " Castle
Ilock," so called because a long line
of sandstone raises its wierd frm,
castle-like upon the side of the
Canyon. This rock is so worn and
torn by turbulent time," that we can
almost fancy our eyes are resting
upon some feudal castles of the days
of chivalry, and we would scarce
wonder should some helmeted knight
emerge from its shadows and de
mand the cause of this unbidden en
trance upon his domain. We are
going with reckless speed, as if the
engine dared not brave the dangers
of these ruggea gorges, but rushes
onward, finding greater beauties and
dangers at every step.
After leaving Echo City, the road
was its way for several miles along
the bankof the Weber river, a stream
so calm, so limpid, one would not
dream how she foams and frets la
madness a few miles further on.
Still we rush onward, and are now
entering the Weber Canyon through
the Narrows."
How the river tosses and plunges
now whirling and eddying in frantic
glee, now calmer growing, until at
last she glides into the plains, as
calmly, as peacefully as if her bosom
had never been torn by cruel rocks
and crags. Poor little river 1 You
can feel the agony of being torn by
powers which you cannot overcome
but must, by a law of your nature
war against, well content if you
reach the smiling valley at last.
You gain peace, so regret not the
bitterness by the way. It is not the
turmoil of the way that Is hardest t
bear, but the fear of missing peace
at the last !
Good-bye sweet river 1 I can
loath to leave you, for you are all
too human not to know the conflicts
of sorrowing mortal breasts. The
huge rocks look down in all their
grandeur upon you. Your conflicts
seem as nought to these mighty sen
tinels, and they smile in contempt as
they stand to high and cold above
you. They have never beeu moved
by the passions which cause your
breast to throb and ewj !), and like
many mighty men," regard with a
sneer the struggles wtveh they can
not comprehend. Bu" you must be
going to pour your pure waters in
the briny lake, while I am emerging
into smiling valleys, made vile by
Mormon rule.
