TUESDAY, DECEMBER f?.
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EyiDEtiCE.
The communication published in
the NEWS yesterday regarding a sa
loon in Washington street, for which
there Is an application in for the re
newal of its license, should be rea
son enough for the excise board to
^>ause and investigate before taking
dction, especially as the correspond
ent states that he has sent a remon
strance to the board.
There is no doubt but that the law
is strained considerably in the excise
Violation cases when it is made neces
sary for a witness to actually see a
man drinking, buy some liquor and
pay for it over the bar himself in or
der to produce testimony that will be
accepted against a saloonkeeper, ac
cused of selling liquor on Sunday.
Such a ruling is not made in a case
of any other nature.
Many a man lias been nung lor
murder which was not seen by any
Witness that testified against him.
IF A MAN CAN BE HUNG FOB
MFHDEK ON CIIUTMST ANT1AI,
EVIDENCE, WHY NOT CONVICT
A SALOONKEEPER ON CIRCUM
STANTIAL EVIDENCE?
If witnesses can be found to testi
fy that men are seen passing in and
out of a side door of a saloon all day
Sunday; if witnesses will swear that
men, under the influence of liquor
come from a saloon on Sunday; it
witnesses will declare, under oath
that men, women and even children
are seen carrying pitchers and ket
tles from a saloon on Sunday, even
if no witness can be found who has
actually seen liquor sold in the sa
loon, the circumstances are such as
to warrant that saloonkeeper being
found guilty of violating the excise
ordinance.
There are seldom any witnesses to
a wilful murder. The prosecution, in
such cases, relies solely on circum
stances to persuade the jury that the
accused person is guilty.
IF THERE WAS AS STRONG EV
IDENCE BROUGHT AGAINST EV
ERY ACCUSED MURDERER AS
CAN BE BROUGHT AGAINST
HOME SALOONKEEPERS OF THIS
CITY FOR VIOLATING THE SUN
DAY EXCISE LAW, EVERY SUCH
PRISONER WOULD SWING.
Our correspondent yesterday sta
te. lcd some plain facts. He is ready tt
.
testify to about everything except
seeing the actual sale of liquor. His
case is proven beyond a reasonable
doubt.
If what he says is true, the license
for this certain saloon should be re
fused.
Hut there are more like it.
Common sense in enforcing the ex
cise law is all that is needed. With
that, all these flagrant violations,
which everyone knows is going on
about the city, can be stopped.
HILLERY MAXIMUM TAX. '
While several other cities are
taking steps to conform with the Hll
lery maximum tax law, should it go
Into effect next year, so far Perth
Amboy has not made any move in
that direction. Should this law re
main and be in force, the local tax
rate cannot exceed $1.50. This
would mean for Perth Amboy the
same as it means in every other city,
a change in the property valuations.
Jt is the general opinion, however,
that this act will be repealed this
winter. On this matter (lie Newark
ICvening News says:
j "The opposition to it is so wide
\ spread that it seems to have failed
entirely to fulfil its intention. Low
taxes are desiraoie and true valua
tions are equitable and constitution
al, but an act which was intended to
produce both but does neither cannot
be called a success, and it is very
doubtful if it can bo amended so as
to lie effectual. The probabilities are
that among the first bills introduced
in the next legislature will be one re
pealing the Hillery act, and if pres
ent indications are reliable it will go
through without delay and with but
little obstruction."

[PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE IS
READJODAY.
Corporations and Railroad Rates
Are First Tackled?Condemns
the Insurance Frauds
Five Recommendations
for Naturalization.
' President Roosevelt's nuntial message
j tins been delivered to congress. Open
ing with n plea for the eo-operatlon of
all classes in continuing the country's
! prosperity and in correcting existing
evils, for ti "square deal" for every
I body, the message first takes up the
question of corporations and railroad
t rate legislation. The president says:
CORPORATIONS.
I am in 110 sense hostile to corpora
i (ions. Tills is an age of combination,
i and any effort to prevent all combinu
! tlon will be not only useless, but in the
| end vicious, because of the contempt
| for law which the failure to enforce
! law inevitably produces. The corpora
j lion has coiue to stay, just as the
I trades union lias come to stuy. Each
I can do and has done great good. Each
I should be favored so long as it does
j good. But each should be sharply
j checked where it acts against law and
justice.
Experience has shown conclusively
(lint it is useless to try to get any ude
i quate regulation and supervision of
these great corporations by state ac
tion. Such regulation and supervision
can only be effectively exercised by a
sovereign whose jurisdiction is coex
tensive with the field work of the cor
|iori#ions?that is, by the national gov
ernment. I believe that this regulation
and supervision can be obtained by the
enactment of law by the congress. If
I Ibis nroves impossible. It will certainly
! bo uccessnry ultimately to confer in
fullest form such power upon the na
tional government by affirmative nc
tuent of the constitution.
The laws of (lie congress and of the
several states hitherto, as passed upon
by the courts, have resulted more often
in showing that the states have no
power In the matter than that the na
tional government has power; so that
there at present exists a very unfortu
nate condition of things, under which
these great corporations doing an In
terstate business occupy the position of
j subjects without a sovereign, neither
any state government nor the national
I government having effective control
j over them. Our steady aim should be
j by legislation, cautiously and carefully
j undertaken, but resolutely persevered
| In, to assert the sovereignty of the na
| tional government by affirmative ac- I
I tion.
J This is only in form an innovation, j
In substance it is merely a restoration, !
j for from the earliest time such regula- ;
; tion of Industrial activities lias been
recognized in the action of the law
i making bodies, nnd all that I propose
j is to meet the changed conditions in
such manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
I always possessed, not only in this coun
try, but also in England before and
since this country became a separate
nation.
RAILROAD RATE LEGISLATION, j
As I said in my message of Dec. 6 I
last, tlie immediate and most pressing 1
j need so far as legislation is concerned
! is the enactment into law of some j
scheme to secure to the agents of the j
: government such supervision and regu- ]
[ Iation of the rates charged by the rail
roads of the country engaged in inter- i
I state traffic as shall summarily anil ef- i
feetively prevent the imposition of un- I
j just or unreasonable rates. It must ,
! include putting a complete stop to re
bates in every shape and form. This |
power to regulate rates, like all similar
powers over the business world, should
! be exercised with moderation, caution i
j and self restraint, but it should exist,
so that it can lie effectively exercised
j when the need arises.
I In my judgment, the most important I
| provision which such law should con- |
j mill IN unit UfUirilm^ UJFUU ouuil; VV/UJ
Ipetent administrative body the power
I to decide upon the case being brought
i before it whether a given rate pre
scribed by a railroad is reasonable and
| Just, and if it is found to be unreason
aide and unjust then, after full investi
gation of the complaint, to prescribe
the limit of rate beyond which it shnll
not be lawful to go?the maximum
| reasonable rate, as it is commonly call
ed?this decision to go into effect with
in a reasonable time and to obtain
from thence onward, subject to review
by the courts.
It sometimes happens at present, not
that a rate is too high, but that a fa
vored shipper is given too low it rate.
1 In such case the commission would
have the rigid to lix this already estab
lished minimum rate as the maximum,
and it would need only one or two such
decisions by the commission to cure
railroad companies of the practice of
giving improper minimum rates. I call
your attention to the fact that my pro
posal is not t:> ;i\e the commission
power to initiate or originate rates gen
erally, I to regal.:te a rate already
fixed or . ginu'.cd by the roads upon
complaint ad after investigation. A
, heavy penalty should be exacted from
|! any corporation which fuils to respect
i an order of the commission. 1 regard
. this power to establish a maximum
: rate as being essential to any scheme
| of real reform lu the matter of railway
regulation.
It is worth while considering whether
it would not be wise to confer on the
; government the right of civil action
. against the beneiieiary of a rebate for ,
at least twice the value of the rebate.'
This wgpid jielji stop what is really
?- - " ' '? ??
blackmail. EleWtor Allowances should
be stopped, for they have now grown
to such an extent that they are demor
alizing and are used as rebates.
PRIVATE CAR LINES.
All private ear lines, industrial roads,
refrigerator charges and the like
should be expressly put under the su
pervision of the Interstate commerce
commission or some similar body so
far as rates and agreements practical
ly affecting rates are concerned. A re
bate in icing charges or In mileage or in
?i division of the rate for .refrl vers ting
marges is just as pernicious as a re
bate in any other way.
There should be publicity of the ac
counts of common curriers. Only in
this way onn violations or evasions of
the law be surely detected. A system
of examination of railroad accounts
should be provided similar to that now
conducted into the national banks by
the bank examiners. A few first class
railroad accountants, if they had prop
er direction and proper authority to in
spect hooks and papers, could accom
plish much in preventing willful viola
tions of the law.
EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY LAW.
In my annual message to the Flfty
eighth congress at its second session I
recommended the passage of an em
ployers' liability law for the District of
Columbia and in our navy yards. I re
newed that recommendation hi my
message to the Fifty-eighth congress at
its second session and furthei; suggest
ed the appointment of a commission to
make a comprehensive study of em
ployers' liability with a view to the en
actment: of a wise and constitutional
law covering the subject, applicable to
all industries within the scope of the
federal power. I hope that such a law
will be prepared and enacted as speed
ily as possible.
There 1ms been demand for depriving
courts of the power to issue Injunctions
in labor disputes. Such special limita
tion of the equity powers of our courts
would be most unwise. It is true that
some judges have misused this power,
but this docs not justify a denial of the
power any more than an Improper ex
ercise of tlie power to call a strike by a
labor leader would justify the denial of j
the right to strike. The remedy is to
regulate the procedure by requiring the
Itulge to give due uotiee to the adverse
parties before granting the writ, the
hearing to be ex parte if the adverse
party does not appear at the time and
place ordered. What is due notice must
depend upon the facts of the case. It
should not be used as a pretext to per
mit violation of law or the jeopardiz
ing of life or property. Of course this
would not authorize the issuing of a
restraining order or injunction in any
case in which it is not already author
ized by existing law.
1 renew the recommendation I made
in my last annual message for an in
vestigation by the department of com
merce and labor of general labor condi
tions, especial attention to be paid to
the conditions of child labor and child
labor legislation in the several states.
Such an investigation should take into
account the various problems with
which the question of child labor is
connected. In such a republic as ours
the one thing that we cannot afford to
neglect is the problem of turning out
decent citizens. The future of the na
tion depends upon the citizenship of
the generations to come. The children
of today are those who tomorrow will
shape the destiny of our land, and we
cannot afford to neglect them. The leg
islature of Colorado has recommended
that the national government provide
some general measure for the protec
tion from abuse of children and dumb
animals throughout the United States.
I lay the matter before you for what I
trust will be your favorable consider
ation.
AS TO WOMEN WHO WORK. '
The department of commerce and la
bor should also make a thorough inves
tigation of the conditions of women in
industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo
men are now engaged in gainful occu
pations, yet there is an almost complete
dearth of data upon which to base any
trustworthy conclusions as regards a
subject as important as it is vast and
complicated. The introduction of wo
men into industry is working change
and disturbance in the domestic and
social lite or tne nation, rue decrease
in marriage, ami especially in the birtli
rate, has been coincident with it. We
must face accomplished facts, and the
adjustment to factory conditions must
be made, but surely it can be made
with less friction and less harmful ef
fects on family life than is now the
case. This whole matter in reality
forms one of the greatest sociological
phenomena of our timer It is a social
question of the first importance, of far
greater importance than uny merely po
litical or economic question can be.
In any great labor disturbance not
only are employer aud employee inter
ested, but also a third party? the gen
eral public. Every considerable labor
difficulty in which interstate commerce
is involved should be investigated by
the government and the facts officially
report (Hi to the public.
INSURANCE.
The great insurance companies afford
striking examples of corporations
whose business lias extended so far
beyond the jurisdiction of the states
which created them as to preclude
strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by the parent states. In my
lust annual message I recommended
"that the congress carefully consider
whether the power of the bureau of
corporations cannot constitutionally be
extended to cover interstate transac
tions in insurance." lteeent events
have emphasised the Importance of an
early and exhaustive consideration of
this question, to see whether it is not
possible to furnish better safeguards
than the several states have been able
to furnish against corruption of the
flagrant kind which lias been exposed.
It has been only too iclearly shown
that certain of the men it the bead of
these large corporations ake but small
note of the ethical distil ctlon between
honesty and dishonesty They draw
tbg. line onj? this side tvhat fiiajr be
called law honesty, tlie klnil of honesty
necessary In order to avoid falling into
the clutches of the law. Of course the
only complete remedy for this eondi
| tlon must be found in an aroused pub-1
lie conscience, a higher sense of ethical!
conduct in the community at large and
especially among business men and In I
the great profession of the law, and in j
the growth of a spirit which condemns j
all dishonesty, whether In rich man or!
in poor man, whether it takes the shape
of bribery or of blackmail. Hut much:
can be done by legislation which is not'
I only drastic, but practical. There is
need of a far stricter and more uni-j
form regulation of the vast insurance
interest^ of this country. The United j
States should in this respect follow the
policy of other nations by providing
adequate national supervision of com-1
; uiercial interests which are clearly na- j
tiounl in character.
1 repeat my previous recommenda-!
tion that the congress should consider;
whether the federal government lias
any power or owes any duty with re
spect to domestic transactions in in
surance of an interstate character.
That state supervision lias proved in
adequate is generally conceded.
THE REVENUES.
There is morq need of stability titan
of the attempt to attain an ideal per
fection in the methods of raising rev
enue, and the shock and strain to the
I business world certain to attend any !
serious change in these methods ren
der such change inadvisable unless for
grave reason. It is not possible to lay
down any general rule by which to de- j
termine the moment when the rensons
for will outweigh the rensons against !
such a change. No change can be
made on lines beneficial to or desired j
by one seetion or one state only. There j
must be something like a general agree- !
meat among the citizens of the several j
states that the change is needed and 1
desired in the interest of the people as a
whole, and there should then be a sin
cere, intelligent and disinterested ef
f,?vt in mnltfl if- in such slome as will i
combine, so far ns possible, the maxl- |
mum of good to the people at large
with the minimum of necessary disre
gard for the special interests of locali
ties or classes, but in time of peace
the revenue must, 011 the average,
taking a series of years together, equal
the expenditures or else the revenues
must be Increased. Last year there
was a deficit. Unless our expenditures
can be kept within the revenues then
our revenue laws must be readjusted.
It is impossible to outline what shape
such a readjustment should take, for
| it is as yet too early to say whether |
i there will be need for it. It should be
considered whether it is not desirable j
that the tariff laws should provide for j
applying as against or in favor of any I
other nation maximum and minimum I
tariff rates established by the congress,
so as to secure a certain reciprocity of
treatment between other nations and
ourselves. ' ?
ECONOMY IN EXPENDITURES.
I earnestly recommend to the con
| gross the need of economy and, to this I
end, of a rigid scrutiny, of npproprla
; tions. All unnecessary offices should j
i lie abolished. In the public printing j
also a large saving of money can be j
! made. There is a constantly growiug \
j tendency to publish masses of ttnlm- j
j portent information at which no human
I being ever looks.
| Yet, in speaking of economy, I must
I in nowise be understood as advocating
' the false economy which is in the end
the worst extravagance. To cut down
in the navy would be a crime against
I the nation. To fail to push forward all
work 011 the Panama canal would be
as great a folly.
CURRENCY.
Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. The
evil does not consist in an inadequate
volume of money, but in the rigidity j
of this volume, which does not respond
as it should to the varying needs of I
j communities and of seasons. Inflation '
I must lie avoided, but some provision j
! should be made that will insure a
j larger volume of money during the fall j
j and winter months than in the less ac- |
live seasons of the year, so that the |
| currency will contract against specula- ?
[ Hon and will expand for the needs of
legitimate business. At present the
treasury department is at irregularly
recurring intervals obliged in the inter
est of the business world?that is, in
the interests of the American public?
to try to avert financial crises by pro
viding a remedy which should be pro
Viueu i?j uuu^icBBiuiiai atnuu.
BUSINESS METHODS IN DEPART- j
MENTS.
At various times I have instituted in
vestlgations into the organization and :
conduct of tlio business of the execu- j
tive departments. While none of these
inquiries have yet progressed far'
enough to warrant final conclusions, i
the.v have already confirmed and em-j
! phasized the general Impression that
flte organization of the departments is
i often faulty in principle and wasteful
1 in results, while many of their business ;
methods are antiquated and inefficient.
1 recommend that the congress consider :
| this subject.
FEDERAL ELECTIONS.
In my lust annual message 1 said:
"The power of the government to
protect the integrity of the elections of
its own officials is inherent and has
been recognized and affirmed by re
peated declarations of the supreme
court. There is no enemy of free gov
ernment more dangerous and none so
Insidious as the corruption of the elect
orate. No one defends or excuses cor
ruption, and it would seem to follow
that none would oppbse vigorous meas
ures to eradicate it. I re-ommend 1he
enactment of a law directed ngatusl
bribery and corruption in federal elec
tions. The details of such a law may
be safely left to the wise discretion of
the congress, but it should go as far as
under the coustitutlou it is possible to
go and should include severe penalties
against him who gives or receives a
i bribe Intended to Influence his act or
the publication not only <TT fhe "expeinl
itures for nominations and elections of
all candidates, but also of all contribu
tions received and expenditures made
by political committees."
I desire to repeat this recommenda
tion.
All contributions by corporations to
any political committee or for any po
litical purpose should be forbidden by
law, directors should not be permitted
to use stockholders' money for such
purposes,and,moreover, a prohibition of ]
this kind would be, as far as it went, |
an effective method of stopping the
evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts.
THE HAGUE CONFERENCE.
The first conference of nations hold !
at The Hague In 18iK), being unable to
dispose of all the business before it, i
recommended the consideration and;
settlement of a number of important j
questions by another conference to be i
called subsequently and at an early j
date. These questions were the follow
ing: (1) The rights and duties of neu
trals; (2) the limitation of the armed
forces on land and sea and of military
budgets; (ill the use of new types and
calibers of military and naval guns: (4)
the inviolability of private property at
sea in times of war; (5) the bombard
ment of ports, cities and villages by na
val forces. In October, 11XH, at the in
stance of the interparliamentary union,
I Issued invitations to all the powers
signatory to The Hague convention to
send delegates to such a conference
and suggested that It be again held at
The Hague.
From all the powers acceptance was
received, coupled in some cases with
the condition that we should wait until
the end of the war then waging be
tween Russia and .litpan. The emperor
of Russia, immediately after the treaty
of peace which so happily terminated
tills war, in a note presented to the
president on Sept. 13 took the initiative
in recommending that the conference
be now called. The United States gov
ernment in response expressed its cor
dial acquiescence and stated that it
would as a matter of course take pnrt
in the new conference and endeavor to
further its alms. We assume that all
civilized governments will support the
movement and that the conference is
now an assured fact. This government
will do everything in Its power to se
cure the success of the conference to
the end that substantial progress may
be made in the cause of international
peace, justice and good will.
MONROE DOCTRINE.
There are certain essential points
which must never be forgotten as re
gards the Monroe doctrine. In the first ]
place, we must as a nation make it ev
ident that we do not intend to treat it
in any shape or way as an excuse for
aggrandizement on our part at the ex
pense of the republics to the south.
But we must make it evident that we
do not intend to permit the Monroe doc
trine to be used by any nation on this
continent as a shield to protect it from
the consequences of its own misdeeds
against foreign nations. The Monroe
doctrine does not force us to Interfere
to prevent the punishment of a port
save to see that the punishment does
not assume the form of territorial occu
pation in any shape. The case is more
difficult when it refers to a contractual
obligation. This country would cer
tainly decline to go to war to prevent a
foreign government from collecting a
just debt. On the other hand, it is
very inadvisable to permit any foreign
power to take possession, even tempo
rarily, of the custom houses of an
American republic in order to enforce
the payment of its obligations, for such
temporary occupation might turn into
a permanent occupation. The only es
eupe from these alternatives may at
any time be that we must ourselves
undertake to bring about some arrange
ment by which so much as possible of
a just obligation shall be paid.
To do so insures the defaulting re
public from having to pay debts of an
improper character under duress, while
it also insures honest creditors of the
republic from being passed by in the
interest of dishonest or grasping cred
itors. Moreover, for the United, States
to take such a position offers the ouly
possible way of insuring us against a
clash witli some foreign power. The
position is therefore in the interest of
peace as well as in the interest of jus
tice.
SANTO DOMINGO.
Santo Domingo has now made an ap
peal to tis, und not only every principle
of wisdom, but every generous instinct i
within us, bids us respond to the np- )
peal. The conditions in Sun to Domingo
have for a number of years grown
from bad to worse until a year ago all
society was on the verge of dissolution.
Fortunately just at this time a ruler
sprang up in Santo Domingo who, with
ids colleagues, saw the dangers threat
ening their country and appealed to the
friendship of the only neighbor who
poss(tssed the power and the will to
help them. There was imminent dan
ger of foreign intervention. The pa
tience of foreign creditors had become
exhausted, Tind at least two foreign na
tions were on the point of intervention
and were only prevented by the unoffi
cial assurance of this government that
it would itself strive to help Santo
Domingo in her hour of need.
Accordingly, the executive depart
ment of our government negotiated a
treaty under which we are trying to
help the Dominican people to straight
en out their finances. This treaty is
pending before the senate. In the
meantime a temporary arrangement
has been made under which the Domin
ican government has appointed Amer
icans to all the important positions in
the customs service, and they are see
ing to tpe honest collection of the rev
enues, turning over 45 per cent to the
i government for running expenses and
| putting the other 55 per cent into a
safe depositary for equitable division
in case the treaty shall be ratified
among the various creditors, whether
European or American.
ai lust, owning 5o Santo Domingo! bur
ger of foreign intervention has been
suspended, and there is at last a pros
pect that all creditors will get Justice,
no more and no less. If the arrange
ment is terminated by the failure of
the treaty chaos will follow, ami sooner
or Inter this government may be In

ARMY AND NAVY.
1 do not believe that any army in the
world has a better average of enlisted
man or a better type of junior officer,
but the army should be trained to act
effectively in a mass. Provision should
be made by sufficient appropriations
for maneuvers of a practical kind.
Provision should be made for the pro
motion of exceptionally meritorious
men over the heads of their comrades
and for the retirement of all men who
have reached a given age without get
ting beyond a given runk.
There should be an increase in the
coast artillery force so that our coast
fortifications can be In some degree
adequately manned. There Is special
need for an increase and reorganization
of the medical department of the army.
In both the army and navy there must
be the same thorough training for duty
in the staff corps as in the fighting line.
The importance of this was shown con
clusively in the Spanish-American and
the Russo-Japanese wars. The work
of the medical departments In the Jap
anese army and navy is especially
worthy of study.
Oitr navy must, relatively to the na
vies of other nations, always be of
greater size than our army. We have
most wisely continued for a number of
years to build up our navy, and it
has now reached a fairly high standard
of efficiency. This standard must not
only be m'nintuined, but increased. It
does not seem to me necessary, how
ever, that the navy should, at least in
the Immediate future, be increased be
yond the present number of units.
What is now elenrly necessary is to
substitute efficient for Inefficient units
as the latter become worn out or us it
becomes apparent that they are use
less. Probably the result would be

to our navy each year, the superseded
or outworn vessels being laid up or
broken up as they are thus replaced.
NAT URALIZATION.
On this subject I recommend:
First.?A federal bureau of naturali
zation, to be established in the depart
ment of commerce and labor, to su
pervise the administration of the natu
ralization laws and to receive returns
of naturalizations pending and accom
plished.
Second.?Uniformity of naturalization
certificates, fees to be charged, and
procedure.
Third.?More exacting qualifications
for citizenship.
Fourth.?The preliminary declaration
of intention to bo abolished and no
alien to be naturalized until at least
ninety days after the filing of his peti
tion.
Fifth. ? Jurisdiction to naturalize
aliens to be confined to United States
district courts and to such state courts
as have jurisdiction in civil actions in
which the amount in controversy is un
limited: in cities of over 100.000 inhab
itants the United States district courts
to have exclusive Jurisdiction in the
naturalization of the alien residents of
such cities.
CRIMINAL LAWS.
In my last message I asked the at- V
tention of the congress to the urgent
need of action to make our criminal
law more effective, ahd I most ear
nestly request that you pay heed to
the report of the attorney general on
this subject.
There seems to be no statute of the
United States which provides for the
punishment of a United States attor
ney or other officer of the government
who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do
or wrongfully refrain from doing any
act when the consideration for such
corrupt agreement is other than one
possessing money value. This might to
be remedied by appropriate legislation.
Legislation should also be enacted to
cover explicitly, unequivocally and be
yond question breach of trust in the
shape of prematurely divulging official

MERCHANT MARINE.
To the spread of our trade In peace
and the defense of our flag In war a
great and prosperous merchant marine
is indispensable. We should have ships
of our own and seamen of our own to
convey our goods to neutral markets
and in case of need to re-enforce our
battle line. It cannot but be a source
of regret and uneasiness to us that the
lines of communication with our sister
republics of South America should be
chiefly under foreign control. It is not
a good tiling that American merchants
and manufacturers should have to send
their goods and letters to South Amer
ica via Europe if they wish security
and dispatch. Even on the Pacific,
where our ships have held their own
better than on the Atlantic, our mer
chant flag is now threatened through
the liberal aid bestowed by other gov
ernments on their own steam lines. I
' ask your earnest consideration of the
j report with which the merchant ma
rine commission has followed its long
t and careful inquiry.
It is a matter of unmixed satisfac
tion once more to call attention to the
excellent work of the pension bureau,
for the veterans of the civil war have
