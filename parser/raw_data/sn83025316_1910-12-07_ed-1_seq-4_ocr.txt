CLEAN WALKS.
l he city council has taken a step
toward preparing Missoula for the
revival planned by the church people
b de.iing 'that the ordinan e con
eernig' snow is to be enforced. There
is. aothing so conducive of profanity
ntl backsliding as to Slip and slither
along a block of glare ice. Th¶re have
been days it the last. week' when
. i l.tln.$ withoiit hobnails was next to
Qinposaib e. Many a man started out
ý*'om home in the morning of some
ene of these days, with his Ieligious
drnciplts' with him, at peace with the
oipid and everybody In it, only to
t1o0 00llis ftotiag, wave his arns in a
wild search for balance and teen fall
hard enough to dissipate all ideas of
right-and" wrong and the use of hard
ewords. A mani who would not swear
tnder such cltcumstances will be in
heaven "three, weeks before tie devil
kinows he's dead. Then, it doesn't add
to the Christian spirit of the falleni
ran to notice, as he sits ip and
reaches for his hat, that the walk that
caused his misfortune runs berore the
)~ine of Deacon Brown or Brother
smith of his own chutrch. Just then,
he is apt to consider all thingss frauds
(tiid to fail to segregate Deacon Brown
or Brother Smith.
In ordering all sidewalks cleaned of
s'Lbw, with arrest as the alternative,
the council has undoubtedly done
bntthing worth while. Silll, the
city fathers have shouldered a con
trasit of some size, for it's mighty dif
ticiplt to make every proper y-owner
tux4t out before breakfast with a
shbovel and a broom. The striet conm
niJdsoner has announced that ihe
npiens business: here's to him.
TWO TO ONE.
The officila count of the vote of the
state shows that the constitutional
amendment was adopted by a two-to
one vote. This is an excellen1t show
ing, altogether to the credit of the
state. It confirms the assertion that
the amendment would not have suf
fered defeat two years ago had there
been a proper understanding of the
purpose of the provision. Montana
is:not niggardly; she has sho wn that
in the past and she has added em
phtil reiteration in the vote for the
amendment this year.
CLEVER CROOKS.
'he ingenuity of swindlers has been
the subject of much comment, Moral
ists have pointed out that th1e same
amount of gray matter expended along
legitimate lines would bring unques
tloned success, but the crook seems to
love his work, a constant bathle of his
witsagainst those of the police: Swind
lers always invent some new dodge
when the old one becomes shopworn.
and fruitless of results. Time and
time 'tgain the public has been warned
against swindlers pretending to be col
le.cting for sqime church or charitable
institution. This game is siIll being
'worked to the limit in some sections
of the United States, but the men be
hind it are out of date. New York,
whTch contributes 'most eyerything
new i. the way of crime, has been the
scene ;of the activity of a gang with
a new scheme. In this case, the
frauds pretend to be political leaders
and to be collecting money for "po
litieal" purposes. Now, in New York,
whltsr all is politics, this graft has
gone well. The "collectors" had little

THE MESSAGE.
President Taft's messagde to con
rss, --read yesterday, is a lengthy
commulication. It is so long that
there are few' persons who will read
it; this is unfortunate for" the mes
Slge' Is an interesting and instructive
document. It is a record of things
done, an outline of real performance.
The recommendations which it con
tains are in the line of continuance of
a policy whbth has been greatly for
the betterment of the country. The
underlying principle which has actuat
ed the Taft administration in its
handling of the business of the coun
try is the application of systematic
business methods to the affairs of the
nation. In the short period of two
years, this policy has produced results
which are surprising in the economy
which has been effected. The postof
fice department has succeeded in
greatly reducing the annual deficit
without Impairing .the service. The
treasury department has made a rec
ord which has transferred the govern
ment balance to the credit side of the
ledger. The navy department has In
augurated a system, which will, if it
is continued, greatly strengthen the
efficiency of the navy and give the
country value received for the invest
ments which are made. In the in
terior department there has been a
shaking-up which has resulted in get
ting the land business of the country
brought up to date and, also, in awak
ening the public to a realization of the
importance of the conservation of nat
usualural resources. The showing of
the first half of the Taft administra
tion is characterized by earnest effort
to fulfill pledges and to administer
the affairs of the nation with econ
omy and effectiveness.
In his recommendations fqr the con
sideration of congress, Presidept Taft
will certainly find indorsement t in
many important details, regardless of
party lines, He urges a tariff commis
sion and a method of tariff revision
which will take up but one schedule
at a time. He argues for the conser
vation of our natural resources along
lines of operation which will meet, we
believe, with very general approval.
Concerning the suggestions as to the
manner of leasing mineral lands there
may be some disagreement but Ithe
general prinlclple will surely find
favor; the question of stpte control
will require careful consideration be
fore it is ever adopted; it will be
necessary to thrqw the strongest safe
guards possible about the public's In
terests here.
Extremely radical but surely in the
direction of efficinit public service is
Durand to give out; then we shall
know where we are at.
The commission form of govern
ment will, according to indications, be
within the reach of Montana cities
before another summer comes.
As a herald of the Red Apple, A. J.
Brehtenstein is showing himself to be
effective; his work for the chamber
of commerce Is high-class.
Judge Myers is not a bluffer and
Ravalli county knows it; the gambling
games will save expenses if they shut
up right now.
Washington got woman suffrage in
November and applied it in December.
Quick work and, seemingly, good re
suits.
The census figures of Berlin, Ger
many, having been announced, we may
expect the Missoula returns before
long.
The heavy, wet snow which covers
the central valley is the best Christ
mas present the states there could re
ceive.
Gambling is bad enough, according
to Judge Myers, but gambling with
marked cards is compounding a felony.
Despite the extensive emigration to
Missoula, the population of North
Carolina shows a decided increase.
The weather reports from Iowa,
Missouri and Tennessee make western
Montana's weather seem tropical.
The two-to-one vote on the consti
tutional amendment places Montana
in the right class.
Out of the turmoil of the British
elections, the liberals are able to
count indorsement.
But, on the other hand, gambling
with marked cards is not gambling.
It is a sure thing.
Judge Myers receives hearty ap
plause for his vigorous denunciation of
gambling.
Mr. Heinse is in the position of
having the limelight thrust upon him.
ENGINE EXPLODES.
El Paso, Tex., Dec. 6.-A freight
engine on the Texas & Pacific rail
road exploded this morning at Odessa,
east of here, killing the engineer and
fireman and seriously injuring the
brakeman. The body of Engineer WiI
liam Oliver was blown a hundred
yards from the track..
STRIKE THREATENED.
St. Joseph, Mo., Dec. 6.-The man
agement of the St. Joseph Street
Railway company, at a conference last
night, refused to accede to the de
mands of its union employes and a
meeting of the carmen will be held
at '10 o'clock to-morrow morning to de
cide whetber to strike,
the recommendation that the entire
postal department be placed in the
civil-service list. The removal of the
postoffiee from politics will be for the
good of the service but ;t will evoke
opposition from the politicians. The
similar recommendations regarding
our consular service is in the direction
of betterment. Our diplomatic service
is a joke in many of its details.
The rebommendation concerning the
proposed national health bureau is
brief; we wish the president had gone
more, into detall) in this discussion.
Viewed in the light of accomplish
ment of government medical service
in suppressing yellow fever and in
making habitable regions which had
been pestilential-and this with but
limited authority and scanty means
it does not seem reasonable to oppose
the creation of a national iealth board,
clothed with ample power. Our gov
ernment doctors, laboring under dis
advantages which were great, have
given the world a lesson in sanita
tlon that is for the benefit of the en
tire human race. It seems to us petty
and unworthy to set up the objection
that the health bureau would ever be
come the creature of any particular
school of medicine, especially as its
efforts would be almost entirely along
the lines of prevention.
The impressions of President Taft's
recent visit to Panama are apparent
in his discussion of the canal situa
tion.., His showing is creditable to
the min in charge of the work and
supports the plan upon which the
canal ,id being built. The president
argue s fqr the proper fortification of
,the canal; ,we think he will be sup
ported in this.
The argument for further economy
runs through the entire message. The
showing of what has been done in this
line Is good; the forecast of what may
be done is interesting; the application
of system to the departments and the
introduction of business methods will
aecomplish wonders in effecting econ
omy and in increasing the efficiency
of the government. This is a partic
-ularly interesting feature of the mes
sage and it calls for the careful con
sideration by congress of the sugges
tions made.
Despite its length, .the message is
worthy of the perusal of every busi
ness man, every good citizen of the
country. It is the message of an hon
est, earnest man, striving for the at
tainment of an ideal in government
wh'ich is not impossible of attainment.
It appeals not to partisanship, but to
the good citizenship of the ccuntry.
It merits a hearty response.
BREAKS UPA COLD
IN SEVERAL HOURS
There is not one grain of qulnife
in Pape's Cold Compound, which
when taken every two hours, until
three consecutive doses are takelt
will surely end the grippe and break
up the most severe cold,-.lther in the
head, chest, back, stomach or limbs
It promptly relieves the most mis
erable neuralgia pains, headache, dull
ness, head and nose stuffed up, fever
ishness, sneezing, sore throat, run
ning of the nose, catarrhal affections,
soreness, stiffness and rheumatic
twinges.
Pape's Cold Compound is the re
sult of three years' research at a cost
of more thian fifty thousand dollars,
and contains no quinine, which we
have conclusively demonstrated is not
effective in the treatment of colds or
grippe.
Take this harmless Compound as
directed, with the knowledge that
there Is no other medicine made any
where else in the world which will
cure your cold or end Grippe misery
as promptly and without any other as
sistance or bad after-effects as a 25
cent package of Pape's Cold Comn
pound, which any druggist 'in the
world can supply.
HOPE IS ABANDONED
OF SETTLING STRIKE
Chicago, Dec. 6.-The refusal of the
clothiers' and tailors' Qrganization to
negotiate with the garment workers'
representatives toward ending the
strike which has been on for several
weeks and cost millions of dollars in
lost wages and trade, today buried
the hopes of Mayor Busse and his
aldermanic committee of strike set
tlers that -peace was in sight.
The future of the strike is uncer
tain, especially since Chief of Police
Steward has granted a permit to the
strikers to parade 50,000 strong to
morrow.
Representatives of the employes' as
sociations said their refusal to treat
with the workers was due to the de
termination that the union should nut
he recognized in any way.
MAY IMPORT HIDES.
Washington, Dec. 6.-The quarantine
on foreign hides is generally relaxing
and as a result hides, which come on
the free list of the present tariff law,
soon will be coming into the country
in greater numbers. The treasury de
partment has extended the regulations
so that hides certified to be free from
diseasea, can be imported through the
quarantine from Sweden, Norway,.

The sixth >ti+al meeting of the
American Civie s4qiation will be
held In Washington next week. This
meeting promises to be one of excep
tional interept tp students of civic bet
terment, and it is predicted that the
addresses of the, occasion, most of
them to be delivered by experts in
their respective lines of. work, will
mark a new epoch in civic literature.
A large percentage of the 2,500 mem
her of the association will be' pres
ent, In addition to delegatef, fro nthe
states appointed,by the goYprnots and
delegates from affiliated societies.
One of the matter's on the lrogramr
for prolonged discussion 'is that of
state parks. While the national gov
ernment for years has been segregat
Ing its beauty spots and transforming
them into perpetual pleasure grounds,
the states have done little in this di
rection. The Americap Civic associa
tion has for one of its tenets the doc
trine that the whole country shall
be led to join a movement for parks
wherever there are people who need
them. Some of the states already
have realized; the importance of dedi
cating large tracts of land to the pub
lic weal, where recreation may be of
fered from the grinding cares that in
fest the *day and where human life,
bird life, animal life, and forest life,
all may be conserved.
Another matter that will call forth
many valuable papers, will be the sub
ject of city planning. The best ideas
of the cities of the world will be
t Irought to Washington and placed at
the disposal of the association. There
will be an address or the A. B. C. of
city' planning by one,-of the greatest
authorities of..the world. Another ad
dress will telJ the people just how to
t plan a c!iy. Thep another expert,
f with a year's pxpetience in the field,
will tell how to get out the vote after
the plans have been made. Some
cities have comne to the point where
their people are willing that the plans
should be made, but once they are
made the voters will not carry them
out. This happened in Reading, Penn
sylvania, not long ago. The municipal
engineers laid out a hew Reading that
would have been a delight to the eye,
I a comfort to the body, and a joy
to the soul. But the progressive Read
ingites did not know. how to turn the
tide of public sentiment in favor of
the necessary bond issue and the cause
was lost.
The compilation of the data gath
ered in the recent federal census has
taught some remarkable lessons. One
of the lessons is that, almost with
out exceptions, iýe cities that have
shown the grq~test spirit of civic im
provement have, been the cities that
had the greatest growth In'.population
in the past ten years. Call the roll
of the cities-Los Angeles, Birming
ham. Seattle, Atlanta, 'dltles all
through the nQpth, the south, the east
and the west,..apd civic progress has
been requited 5 Wth city growth, and.
this, in turn, ,,s, produced wealth.
and added pro s1 y ,..
The American .Civic ssciation was
organized in St,., tLodts' in' the days of
the Lousiana purchase exposition. It
was created by merging two organiza
tions, the American Park and Outdoor
Art association, and the American
League for Civic Improvement into one.
It included in its objects the purposes
for whicl} both pf thbese orgarjiaztions
,d been fot~d4. . t was not yet
4ut of its aswd pin l fothes when it
began its celebrated fight against the
commercialism that wbuld have
turned 'Niagara '`nto a barren cliff in
order to utilize' the powvers of its
waters. It was an, uphill fight, and
the assent of Canada.and the United
States was necessary to win it. But
the association succeeded in having
Niagara preserved until such time as
treaty negotiations can be settled.
There are a number of departments
conducted by the association. One of
these is the department of nuisances.
It carries varieties. The entire liter
ature of smoke prevention has been
boiled down and its essence extracted
and bottled in a little booklet issued
by the association. This booklet shows
that smoke is a nuisance to the public
and a waste to the factory creating
it. It gives the experiepces of cities
and factories that have abated the
smoke nuisance, and calls attention to
the fact that throat, lung, and nasal
diseases were much more prevalent
in many cities in the days of the an
I thracite coal strike than they were be
fore, or have been since.
This " department also attacks tho
billboard nuisance, quoting a court de
cision from San Jose in which it was
held that no one has any more right
to offend the eye with unsightly ob
jects than he has to offend the nose
with foul sme:ls or the ear with un
earthly noises. It ,has published a
booklet on the subject in which it
epitomizes all the -literature of the
world on the subject of billboards. It
shows how the billboard offends art.
mars the landscape, -polls the effect
of city architecture, u.6 dangerous to
property and to heamJi and then pro
poses model ordinanks and legislative
acts to suppress it.',
The association deeded. some time
ago to test pIulh!ii sentiment with ref
erence to billboards,-by an experiment
at Niagara falls. It distributed to
visitors to the Falls.. on their return
from Goat Island, double post cards.
One was a picture card and the other
a question card. The one could be
mailed to a friend and the other was
to be filled out and mailed 'to the
association. The questions were.as to
whether the visitor noticed the adver
nlsing signs on the Canadian side ot'
the Gorge, whether their effect was
pleasing or displeasfng, and whether
he would be more likely to buy the
article by having seen the advertise
ment. Of the replies W9 per cent had
noticed them, to 84 per cent they were
displeasing. and 84 .per cent replied
they would be more disinclined than
ever to buy the arUcies advertised.
One of the most promising cam
paigns the association has inaugu
rated is that against t0e house fly.
The wonferful movlpg 'picture film
which was shown ao-ver ,the United|
States last spring,,.l wpich the llthy
habits of his flybhip were portrayed
was brought out by this association.
It was in thousands of moving pic-:
ture shows throughout the country,
and Ih some cities the civic organita-;
tions bought the film and showed it at
their own expense. The film was made
by the leading film maker of the
world, and the task of photographing
the different stages, in fly life was a
tedious and exacting one. The asso
ciation has just begun its war. The
public.. will be reminded that the fly
Ii more. deadly than the snake, and
,that thousands of people die from fly
borne diseases where one dies from a
snakebite.
The, mosquito is another pest upon
which the Civic association has turned
Its guns. Realizing how much. human
misery, poverty and woe comes from
malaria and other diseases that are
mosquito-borne, the Civic association
has published and sent broadcast a
booklet on how to fight the mosquito.
The directions for the warfare nre'so
simple yet so efficacious that if they
were carried out everywhere the mos
quito would be exterminated. With
the example at Panama of what the
abolition of the mosquito will do for
the public health, to say nothing of
the miracles wrought in Cuba, the
people of the United States have
abundant grounds" for assisting the
association in its mosquito warfare.
In its general policy of making liv
ing conditions for all America better
and more wholesome, the Civic asst
clation expouses many causes th.at
must appeal to every public spirited
citizen. It stands for clean streets
and socialists the aid of every cititen;
it advocates germ-free drinking watei
and is doing h~ist it can to educate
the public to see' that economy and
health are both on the side of good
water; it espouses underground wires
for electric lines and 'is striving to
impress the public with the inipor
tance of such a program; it believes
in playgrounds for the children and
parks for grown-ups and is lending
aid to evex'y agency that would bring
them about;' it believes water-fronts
free from filth are essential to public
health and therefore advocates ade
quate system of sewage. Public com
fort stations, garden schools for chil
dren, grouping of public buildings,
care of the trees and planting of new
ones, these are some of the planks
in the platform of the association.
And it has more effective means of
campaigning for the public good than
are usually at the dispsoal of uplift
workers. Its members are enthusi
astic believers in the promotion of the
public welfare, and are moved by
humanitarian instincts; it has hun
dreds of. affiliated organizations which
work to further its purposes; it
has an efficient publicity system
ifor commanding the public attentidn
and a system of distributing its lit
erature wherle it will count. Thus
equipped, it expects to do its part to
ward making the ensuing decade the
most momentdous"in "history itn the
promotion of the welfare of all classes
and conditions of society.

RICE PLANIERS WANT
MORE CONSERVATION
Houston. Tex.. Dec. 6.-Conserva
tion along new lines, the building of
huge reservoirs by the state to hold
the flood waters of the Colorado
river, is a matter to be brought' to
the attention' of the legis!Mture next
January by the rice growers of one
of the greatest rice sections contiguous
to Houston, and as this city is the
rice center of the southwest the
forces of the rice interests are being
marshaled here. One county alone,
Matagorda, which for several years
has produced from 550,000 .to 600,000
bags of rice, this year did not pro
duce to exceed 100,000. This was due
to a shortage of water in the Colo
rado, a thing unprecedented in the
history of this state. It is this crisis
which has aroused the farmers. The
Colorado river is unlike all the other
streams from which Irrigating water
is taken in this state. The Sabine
river, the San Jacinto, the Trinity,
the Brazos and/the Rio Grande, all
become coast streams before they
empty into the bay; that is, they have
deep channels, and' store up inex
haustible quantities of water in their
lower regions, while the Colorado river
is a rapid, swift stream from its head
to its mouth, the lower reaches of it
have a more rapid fow. and a greater
fall than any of the other rivers; and
is the only stream in Texas where toe
conservation of flood waters is neces
sary. The rice farmers now propose
to erect great reservoirs to impound
the flood waters of the river for use
during the dry season. The agitation
is headed by Colonel J. N. Simpson,
former republican candidate for' =uov
ernor, and one of the big rice planters
of the state.
ARCHBISHOP MESSMER
IS AGAINST "SALOME"
Milwaukee, Dec. 6.-Archbishoq H.
C. Messmer. in a letter to the priests
of the Milwaukee archdiocese, denies
the coming production in this city of
the grand opera "Salome." He says
in part:%
"Even if the dance of Salome be not
in itself openly immodest -and lewd,
a thing I do not know, yet the whole
tendency of the opera, If reports are
true, is a glorification of divorce and
debauchery. Hence you will please
request the members of your parish
to stay away and thus express their
temphatie protest against.- the publle
productiona o the opera, in -o city."
