TOE rRESIDEM'S MESSAGE.
We present this week on the first
page, the message of President Harri
son to the 52d Congress, Without
question it is one of the ablest, most
dignified and most business-like docu
ment that has found its war to Con
gress in many years, and should re
ceive a careful perusal. Like Mr.
Harrison's many utterances, his bit
terest opponents can find no flaw in it
for adverse criticism. Herewith we
give lew upiuiuus oi tue uir".'ge
from some of the leading papers of the
country, seleoAed at random, among
wh:ic'n are some by the leading Demo
cratic journals of the country:
As a whole, it is an able, and here
and there admirable document, wor
thy of the President and well worth
reading. New York Advertiser,
The message of the President of
the United States is a document writ
ten with great ability and is sure to
attract widespread attention and favor
able oommont. Ohio Slate Journal
Altogether, it strikes us as a brainy
message. The writer speaks out for
himself. He makes it clear that he,
and he only, is President. We respect
the tone, while we differ with the sen
timent. Cincinnati Enquirer, (Z)em.)
President Harrison's message is like
the man frank, plain and business
like, and admirable in expression
just such a presentation of the "state
of the Union" as the Constitution re
quires him to make to Congress.
Philadelphia Public Ledger.
There is no straining for effect. It
is a simple, clear and business-like
statement of publio affairs, full of
wise and practical suggestions, and so
dispassionate that its perusal, after the
crazy factional contests of Democrats,
is like a breath of cool mountain air.
New York Tribune.
It is a serious, dignified State paper,
fulfilling admirably the spirit and
r of the Constitutional require'
t tbat the President "shall give to
tigress information of the state of
.ne Union, and recommend to their
consideration such measures as he
shall judge necessary and expedient.'
delphia Press.
'icon's message to Congress
y robust, neither is the
jied with exceptional abili
but it is a straightforward
jt which gives us a clear pho
..phio view of the events which
.ve absorbed the country's attention
during the last twelve months. New
lork Herald, (Dem )
In spite of the attempt of the
English to foment trouble in Chili,
despatches from several sources prove
that the President's message to Con
gress has had it's effect. It may anger
the hotheads who think Chili is the
only country in the world and is in
condition to whip any other nation,
but it certainly will conduce to calm
ness on the part of the Chilian leaders.
Ml that Chili wants is to get out of
i befogged notion carefully nursed
jy the English that the United States
intends to disavow the acta of its
Minister and is indifferent to the
rights of its seamen and citizens. This
is not the American spirit and th
sooner the little popinjay nation of the
aalt south seas becomes convinced
this, the better for it.Phila. Press
XT seems tbat Chairman Kerr since
his election as rbief clerk in th
House is disposed to act just as b
pleases. There is evidence of this
bis appointment of Frank Soyder, of
Clearfield, as bis disbursing clerk.
Mr. Snyder is a great friend of Hon.
William A. Wallace, and bis being
given such a nice fat place by Mr. Kerr
is said to displease Mr. Harrity, who
wanted the place fur another Demo
cratic citizen of Fenutjlvania who
could belp the Harrity people. If Mr.
Kerr keeps on in this way be will get
himself cordially disliked at the Stale
Department, but he will make lots of
friends for Mr. Wallace. Ilarruburg
Telegraph.
The President's message has enabled
John Bull to grasp another fact, as
shown by the following from the St.
James Gazette: "The roost important
point is that which refers to the tariff.
The figures presented compare signifi
cantly with British figures which show
a stationary condition of trade. It is
all well to say that America will pres
ently discover the mistake in the fiscal
policy, but perhaps they may not. In
the meantime the calculations of the
supporters of the McKinley bill are
working out much better than anyone
in England bad reason to eipect."
A proclamation was issued by
Governor PattUon last week, anoounc
iug a reduction of the Stale debt
'uring the year of $2,538,352.
The next National Republican
Cooventioo will be composed of 808
delegates, of wbicb Pennsylvania will
have 64. It will require 450 votes to
Dominate candidate.
The Republicans of Crawford coun
ty are urging Judge Henderson to be
a candidate for the nomination of
Supreme Judge next year. The choice
would be a decidedly sensible one.
No selection of booths aud guard
rails for the operation of the ballot
reform law has yet been made, but a
decision will probably bo announced
in a few days. The wooden. ht,iAi
are not in it. Thvj wYil be steel, 'tis
said..-
Sr ringer is likely to be chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee
aud Iloluiaa Rill lead the Appropria
ions Committee. This leaves Mills
out in the cold, but he and his friends
will be heard from. Already there
re meetings which indicate that Mr.
Crisp will have more trouble than that
which will come to him from the
Republican side of the House. Ilol
man promises to cut down appropria
tions $100,000,000, which would indi
cate that he is about to raid the old
soldier pensions.
There will be no Sunday opening
of the World's Fair if the voice of
Pennsylvania is of any avail. At a
recent meeting of the Executive
Board of the Pennsylvania Commission
they unanimously adopted a resolution
to be presented to tbo National Com
mission asking that there be no Sunday
exhibitions. Ibis action on the part
of the Commission will set a good ex
ample fur other States which have
been halting and hesitating over ex
pressiog their views. Thbe influence
of these States now will be against
Sunday opening, anil any proposition
to open the gates on the Sabbath day
will provoke a storm of opposition.
