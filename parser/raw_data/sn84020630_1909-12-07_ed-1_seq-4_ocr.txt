THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. !
President Taft is too much possess-1
ed of the judicial temperament to
write a message that will set the na- j
tion afire with the boldness of its
statements or that will present radi
cal departures from accepted policies.
It does not lack positiveness and yet
it breathes a conciliatory spirit, the
result of weighing both sides of a
question. It is difficult for a man
of that character to say to another:
"You are entirely wrong, I alone am
right."
The United States has abandoned
its isolated position as far as interna
tional affairs are concerned and al
most one half of the message is de
voted to reviewing the relations of the
United States with other nations.
Of much importance to New Mexico,
of course, is the declaration as to
statehood. This makes it plain, while
an enabling act may be passed at this
session of Congress, yet, there will be
no hurry to rush the Territory into
statehood. The constitution must be
formulated, adopted and ratified be
fore there will be an election of state
officers. It will be January 1, 1911,
therefore, before Xew Mexico becomes
a state at the earliest calculation and
it may be January 1, 1912, before the
matter is consummated. Of course,
all this time might have been saved,
if the last legislature had done, as the
Xew Mexican advocated, authorized
the holding of a constitutional conven
tion during the summer just past. The
President says on the subject in his
message :
"The successful party in the last
election in its national platform de
clared in favor of the admission as sep
arate states of Xew Mexico and Ari
zona, and I recommend that legislation
appropriate to this end be adopted. I
urge, however, that care be exercised
in the preparation of the legislation
affecting each territory to secure de
liberation in the selection of persons
as members of the convention to draft
a constitution for the incoming state,
and I earnestly advise that such con
stitution after adoption by the conven
tion shall be submitted to the people
of the territory for their approval at
an election in which the sole issue
shall be the merits of the proposed
constitution, and if the constitution is
defeated by popular vote means shall
be provided in the enabling act for a
new convention and the drafting of a
new constitution. I think it vital that
the issue as to the merits of the con
stitution should not be mixed up with
the selection of state officers, and that
no election of state officers should be
had until after constitution has been
fully approved and finally settled
upon."
Naturally, the message devotes
much thought to the finances of the
nation and the tariff. In fact, Presi
dent Taft says that perhaps, the most
important question presented to the
administration is that of economy in
expenditures. This declaration reveals
what will be the main claim to recog
nition on part of the tax payers, of the
Taft policies, that of economy. A de
ficit of almost f 35,000,000 is anticipated
by June 30, 1910, not to speak' of the
sum of $38,000,000 which it is f xpected,
will be "disbursed by that date on the
Panama canal. This double deficit is
to be met by the issue of Panama
canal bonds already authorized. If the
President's plans for economy are
adopted, instead of a deficit by June
30, 1911, there will be a surplus of
$712,000. The economies are to be of
two kinds: A saving in the perma
nent administration of the depart
ments, bureaus and offices of the gov
ernment; and a postponement of pro
jects and improvements such as those
perhaps of the reclamation service
and on rivers and harbors.
The President speaks very thought
fully on the subject of greater ef
ficiency among government employes
and the encouragement and rewarding
of superior ability. He advocates a re
classification of the civil service with
that purpose in view and also that su
perannuated public servants be grant
ed a itension.
An important recommendation, in
fact, more important than will be ap
parent to the layman, is the recommen
dation for a change in judicial pro
cedure so as to prevent delays in the
administration of justice and to re
duce the; cost to litigants. The mes-
sags says::
"The expedition with which business
Is disposed of both on the civil and the
criminal side of - English courts under
modern rules of procedure makes the
delays In our courts seem archaic and
barbarous. The procedure in the fed-
cral courts should furnish an example
lor the state courts. I presume it is

and expediting the procedure as far
as possible and making it as inexpen
sive as may be to the litigant of little
means."
The President recommends the en
actment of a statute forbidding here
after the issuing of any injunction or
restraining order, whether temporary
or permanent, by any federal court,
without a previous notice and a rea
sonable opportunity to be heard on
behalf of the parties to be enjoined un

of the court that the delay necessary

result in irreparable injury to the com
pkiinant and unless also the court
shall from the evidence make a written
f riding, which shall be spread upon the
court minutes, that immediate and ir
reparable injury is likely to ensue to
the complainant, and shall define the
injury, state why it is irreparable, and
shall also endorse on the order issued
the date and the hour of the issuance
of the order.
The President recommends postal
savings banks. He can see no reason
for delaying action on this subject.
Following the example by President
Roosevelt, the chief executicve recom
mends a ship subsidy act. He recom
r.'ei ds special legislation for the gov
ernment of Alaska, an executive
council to be appointed by the Presi
dert. instead of an elective legislature.
H? advocates the conservation of na
tional resources and the enactment of
legislation which he promises to dis
cuss in more detail in a special mes
sage. Although the message advocates no
startling and new policies it will prob
ably arouse more difference in opinion
lhan any of the messages of President
Taft's predecessors, for after all, Taft
touches upon subjects of most vital
nature and upon which there is great
difference of opinion among the think
ing people of the United States.
. President Taft has been so aroused
by the iniquity and the damage done
the moral fiber of the nation by the
While Slave Traffic that he eoes out
of his way in his message to de
nounce it and to favor the appropria
tion of $30,000 by Congress to help
in suppressing it. And what the
nation ought to do should be supple
mented by the states in passing prop
er laws and by communities in enforc
ing them. No city government should
countenance- it for a moment, no
sheriff, no" police force, no district
attorney, fio judge should show it any
mercy. It is the most insidious evil
that confronts the nation today. No
nation can endure, the strength of
whose manhood is sapped by immor
ality. Even a people soaked in whis
key and wine may retain some
strength that will enable It to with'
stand decay but no tribe or people
have ever survived debauchery such
as President Taft seeks to suppress
by destroying the trade in white
slaves, a trade which is more con
temptible, mere savage, more cruel
than was the trade in black slaves
at any time.
For three days past, the highest
temperature at Denver, Colo., was five
degrees above zero, or the very low
est to which it fell in Santa Fe last
night, the coldest of the winter.' Yet,
Denver attracts many times the tour
ists and healthseekers that. Santa Fe
does with its much milder winter and
cooler summer weather. There Is a
reason, and it is up to Santa Fe to
find it
PREPARE FOR THE FIGHT NOW.
Though Congress was in session
only a few minutes yesterday, the
statehood bill prepared by the chair
man of the House Committee on Ter
ritories, was introduced. Its provis
ions which had been carefully discuss
ed with President Taft during last
summer, are of vital importance to
iho nonnle if the Territory and it. is
nniikelv that, anv changes will be
made in them, for it is understood to
be the administration measure. To
Santa Fe the clause fixing the capital
here only until 1913, is of much con
sequence, especially, since it is unlike
ly that the new state will commence
business until Xew Year 1912. This
assures the capital to Santa Fe only
for three years after which time, Santa
Fe must be prepared to make a fight
at any time. If the capital were to be
removed to Albuquerque or some oth
er point in 191.7 it would mean a de-
cj(ie(1 (ir0!) jU
property values; it
would mean a temporary loss to every
the city limits, would tavor a greater
Santa Fe, rather than lose a point
in the fight for the capital that will
begin before another census is taken.
It will be of incalculable advantage to
be a greater, a united Santa Fe in
1915. It is still time to bring this
about, if the city council and the may
or will act promptly to call another
election to decide whether Santa Fe
will be one united town in 1915, a town
of 12,000 people, the largest town in
the Territory, or whether it will be of
ficially the fifth or sixth in population
and thus handicapped from the start
in holding its own in he scrap that
will surely begin in 1915 for the honor
of being the capital of the Territory,
STUDY THE STATEHOOD BILL,
From what the Xew Mexican learns
the terms of the Hamilton Enabling
Act introduced in the House yesterday
are not near as liberal to New Mexico
as have been previous measures for the
Territory passed by the House. Sev
eral of its clauses should be actively
discussed and if found detrimental to
the future of the Territory should be
changed. Delegate Andrews can help
much in this and so can the Republi
can organization. Inviting a fight for
the capital as nearly as 1915 can have
no good effect. The date should be
1930, are even later, as no public good
can be served at all by contentions
over the location of the capital. For
the present New Mexico will have its
I hands full without such fight.
The clause providing for the pay
ment of the indebtedness of the Ter
ritory and its counties from the pro
ceeds of a three .million acre land
grant should also be worded carefully
so as to include the railroad Dona in
debtedness of Santa Fe and Grant
counties. The wt)rd "valid" is used in
the Hamilton bill, and while it is a
good limitation, it should be follow
ed by a definition of "valid" so that
the argument that the greater part of
the Santa Fe county debt is "invalid"
can not be used.
The bill ostensibly wants to prevent
a vote on the constitution at the same
time as state officers are elected, but
nevertheless provides for a vote on
it at the time of the territorial election
when it will be tied up in the choice
for . Delegate to Congress, the mem
bers of the legislature and county
officers.
Is it reasonable to suppose that can
didates for Delegate to Congress and
the candidates for the legislature,
would expend time, energy and means
to be elected and at the same time
urge the acceptance of an instrument
which would result in their never tak
ing office? It is expecting too much
from human nature to suppose that a
vigorous campaign would be waged
for the acceptance of the constitution
at the same time as the election of of
ficers that would be for naught in case
the constitution is approved. The ten
dency Would be otherwise, and even if
the document provided a proper fun
damental law, it is very likely that it
J would be defeated by the efforts of the
candidates of both parties who would
be engagad in a strenuous campaign
for office.
Governor Curry is right when he
says that Albuquerque, the largest
city in the Territory, ouht to have
the, largest and most prosperous Na
tional Guard organization in the Ter
ritory. Santa Fe has three National
Guard organizations, Albuquerque
none. It is well for Santa Fe to be
ahead of Albuquerque in one particu
lar, but looking at It from the larger
standpoint, it Is deplorable that thus
far the efforts to organize a National
Guard company in Albuquerque have
not been successful.
