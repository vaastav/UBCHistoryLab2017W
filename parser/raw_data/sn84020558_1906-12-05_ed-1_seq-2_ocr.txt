THE MESSAGE.
One of the finest points of the
president's message transmitted to
congress yesterday was the absence of
r.ll reference to Joint statehood. There
was no arrrehension that this subject
would be revived at this time and
there Is little liklihood that it will
come up at any other time.
The whole matter has been threshed
out both in the territories 'and in the
nation at large and the verdict has
been most pronouncedly against joint
pre. There can be no conception of a
change of condtions which would ever
make the joining of Arizona and New
Mexico more acceptable to the whale
country than it is now.
An interesting feature of the mes
sage is the recommendation of an ex
tension of federal authority in such
cases as that which has arisen at San
Krancisco over the Japanese question.
V'e hardly think that that recommen
dation will be favorably received by a
majority in congress. It is possible
that the Japanese of San Francisco
have not been properly secured in ail
their treaty rights, but the people of
no state will admit that they may no!
adopt such laws as they see fit for
the regulation of their schools. Ther.
may be a denial that congress can con- I
fer a treaty right upon any foreigner I
if such richt is in conflict with . !
right the constitution has already giv-
en to the states. It has never been
disputed that a state may designate
that pupils of one color may not attenu
a school intended for pupils of another
color.
An interestingthing in this head of
the message is the president's argu
ment, that in as much as the goverr
ment is bound to protect a city, say
Han ' Francisco af.ainst invasion by a
foreign foe, it should be given the
power to regulate the affairs in that
city in such a manner that there shall
be no provocation of the invasion.
The allusion to Porto Rico, concern
lug which much has been expected by
reason of the president's recent visit U
that island, was brief, though It contains
recommendation of the islanders to
citiaenship, a condition which the presi
dent somewhat anticipated in rerentTy
fclrestng groups of them as citizens.
Voluminous and comprehensive as
the message is there Is hardly a rec- i
ommcndatlun in it which will take the
country by surprise. Through the
heads of the departments in the recent
campaign the views of the president
may be regarded as having been re-
fVcted. on all subjects which have just .
now been presented to congress.
In order successfully to engage in
faking one should be thoroughly fa
miliar with the subject In hand. The !
Evening Outcast, which swept the half I
of Clifton away by a flood in the Gila j
yesterday betrayed a lamentable
familiarity with the -geography of that

has resulted in a miscarriage of Justice.
INJUNCTIONS.
"In my last message I suggested the
enactment of a law In connection with
the issuance of injunctions, attention
having been" sharply drawn to the
matter by the demand that the right
of applying injunctions in labor cases
should be wholly abolished. It is at
least doubtful whether a law abolish
ing altogether the use of Injunctions
in such cases would stand the test of
the courts: in which case of course
the legislation would be Ineffective.
Moreover, I believe it would be wrong
altogether to prohibit the use of in
juncions. It is criminal to permit sym
pathy for criminals to weaken our
hands in upholding the law; and if
men seek to destroy life or property
by mob violence there should be no im.
pairment of the power of the courts to
deal with them in the most summary
and effective way possible. But so far
as possible the abuse of the power
should be provided against by some
such law as I advocated lest year.
"In this matter of injunctions there
is lodged in the hands of the judiciary
a necessary power which is neverthe
less subject to the possibility of grave
abuse. It is a power that should be
exercised with extreme care and should
be subject to jealous scrutiny of all
men. and condemnation should be
meted out as much to the judge who
fails to use it boldly when necessary
I as to the judge who uses it wantonl
or oppressively. Of course a judge
strong enough to be fit for his office
will enjoin any resort to violence or
intimidation, especially by conspiracy,
no matter what his opinion may be of
the rights of the original quarrel. There
must be no hesitation in dealing with
disorder. But there must likewise be
no such abuse of the Injunctive power
as is implied in forbidding laboring
men to strive for their own betterment
in peaceful and lawful ways; nor must
the injunction be used merely to aid
some big corporation in carrying out
schemes for its own aggrandizement.
It must be remembered that a prelim
inary injunction In a labor case, if
granted without adequate proof (even
when authority can be found to support
the conclusions of law on which it is
founded), may often settle the dispute
between the parlies; and therefore U
improperly granted may do irreparable
wrong. Yet there are many Judges who
assume a matter-of-course granting of
a preliminary injunction to be the or
dinary and proper Judicial disposition
of such cases; and there have un
doubtedly been flagrant wrongs com
mitted bv judges in connection with
labor disputes even within the last few
years although I think much less often
tha.i in former years. Such Judges by
their unwise action lmmensly strength
en the hands of those who are striving
entirely to do away with the power of
injunction; and therefore such careless
use of the Injunctive process .tends to
threaten its very existence, for if the
American people ever become convln-
ced that this process Is habitually j
aouseo wneint-r to iiiiiLitrio alliums
labor or In matters affecting corpora
tions, it will be well-nigh impossible
to prevent its abolition.
LYNCHING. '
"In connection with the delay of th-i
law, I call your attention and the at-
tentlon of the Nation to the prevalence
of crime among us, and above all the j one portion of the country as of an
epidemic of lynching end mob violence 1 other. It Is as true fo- the nero as
thit springs up. now In one part of the 1 for tne white man. The white man,

public conscience, and to supplement j for instance who commit, the crime of
tliis by whatever legislation will addlra.e nr(. !n the great majority men
stieed and certainty In. the execution .
' of the law. When we deal with lyncn-
ing even more s necessary. A great
many white men are lynched, but the .
crime is p-culiarly frequent in respect j
to black men. The greatest existing j
cause of lynching is the perpetration,
Aurnialli, H. KiinV men of the hideous
crlme of rapethe most abominable in
all the category of crimes, even worse
than murder. Mobs frequently avenge
the commission of this crime by them
selves torturing to death the man com
mitting it; thus avenging In bestial
fashion a bestial deed, and reducing
tneniselves to a level with the criminal.
"Lawlessness grows by what It feeds '
un-iupon; and when mobs begin to lyncn
the' speedily extend the sphere
f thp'r operations and lynch for man
at all; while a considerable proportion
of the individuals lynched are innocent
of all crime. Governor Candler, of
Georgia, stated on one occasion Fome
vears ago: 'I can say of a verity that
I have, within the last month, saved
the lives of half a dozen innocent ne
groes who were pursued by the mob.
and brought them to trial In a court of
a law in which thev were acquitted.
As Bishop Gallowoy, of Mississippi, has
finely said: 'When the rule of a mob
obtains, that which distinguishes a high
civilization is surrendered. The mob
which lynches a negro charged with
rape will in a Utt'.e while lynch a white
man suspected of a crime. Every
Christian patriot in America needs to
lift up his voice in loud and eternal
protest against the mob spirit that is
threatening the Integrity of this Re
public.' Governor Jelks, of Alabama,
has recently spoken as follows: The
lynching of any person for whatever
crime is inexcusable' anywhere it is
a defiance of orderly government; but
killing of innocent people under any
provocation is Infinitely more horrible;
and yet innocent people are likely to
die when a mob's terrible lust is once
aroused. The lesson Is this: No good
citizen can afford to countenance a
defiance of the statutes, no matter what
the provocation. , The Innocent fre
quently suffer and. it is my observa
tion, more usually suffer than the
guilty. The white peof'l of the South
Indict the Whole colored race on the
ground that even the better elements
lend no assistance whatever in ferret
Ing qut criminals of their own color,
The respectable colored people must
learn not to harbor their criminals, but
to assist the officers in bringing them
to Justice. This is the larger crime
jand it provokes such atrocious offenses
as the one at Atlanta. The two races
demanding on the part or both to make
common cause with the law-abiding
against criminals of anv color."

selves as to the colored lace to treat
well the colored man who shows by his
life that he deserves such treatment,
for it is surely the highest wisdom to
encourage in the colored race all those
individuals who are honest, industrious.
law-abiding, and who therefore make
good and safe neighbors and citizens.
Every colored man should realize
that the woist enemy of his race is the
negro criminal, and above all the negro
criminal who commits the dreadful
crime of rape; and it should be felt
as in the highest degree an otiense
against the whole country, and against
the colored race in particular, for a
colored man to fail to help the officers
of the law in hunting down with all
possible earnestness and zeal every
such infamous offender. Moreover, in
my judgment, the crime of rape should
always be punished with death, as in
the case with murder; assault with
intent to commit rape should be made
a capital crime, at least in the discre
tion of the court; and provision should
be made by which the punishment may
follow immediately upon the heels of
the offense; while the trial should be
so conducted that the victim need not
be wantonly shamed while giving tes
timony, and that the least possible
publicity shall be given to the details.
"The members of the white race on
the other hand should understand that
every lynching represents by Just so
much the loosening of the bonds of civ
ilization; that the spirit of lynching in
evitably throws into prominence in the
community all the foul and evil crea
tures that dwell therein.. No man can
take part in the torture of a human
being without having his own moral
nature permanently lowered. Every
lynching means Just so much moral
deterioration In all the children who
have any knowledge of it. and there
fore Just so much additional trouble
for the next generation of Americans.
"Let justice be both sure and swift;
but let it be justice under the law, and
not the wild and crooked savagery of
a mob.
"There is another matter which has
a direct bearing upon this matter of
lynching and of the brutal crime which
sometimes calls it forth and at other
times merely fu'nlshes the excuse for
its existence. It is out of the question
for our people as a whole permanently
to rise by treading down any of their
own number. Even those who them
selves for the moment profit by such
maltreatment of thtir fellows will In
the long run also suffer. No more
shortsighted policy can be imagined
than in the fancied Interest of one
tia8B' o prevent the education of an
oirr c!a?s. The free public pchool. the
chance for each boy or girl to get a
gond education, lies at the foundation
of our whole political situation. In
every community the poorest citizens
those who need the schools most, would
be deprived of them if they only re-
'ceived school facilities proportioned to
tne taxps thev paid. This Is as true of
w ho have either had no education or
very little; Just as they are almost
invariably men who own no property,
f0r the man who puts money by out of
ni3 earnings. like the man who acquires
education, is usually lifted above mere
brutal crlmlnalty. Of course the best
type of education for the colored man
taken as a who! Is such education as
is conferred in schools like Hampton
and Tuskepee; where the boys and
girls, the young men and young women,
are trained industrially as well as in
the ordinary public school branches.
The graduates of these schools turn
nut well in a ereat majority of
ca.ves, and hardly any of them become
criminals, while what little criminality
there is never takes, the form of that
biutal violenee which invites lynch law.
Every graduate of these schools and
for the matter of that every other col
ored man or woman who leads a life
so useful and honorable as to win the
good will and respect of those whites
whose neighbor he or she Is, thereby
helps the whole colored race as it can
be helped in no other way; for next
to the negro himself, the man who can
do most to help the negro is his white
neighbor who lives near him; and our
steady effort should be to better tha
relations between the two. Great
though the benefit of these schools has J
been to their colored pupils and to the
colored people, it may well be ques-
tioned whether the benefit has not
been at least as g:eat to the whitu
people among whom these colored pu
pils live after they graduate.
