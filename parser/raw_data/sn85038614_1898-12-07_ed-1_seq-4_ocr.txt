Th.? l'r. ; Id. nt. in his message to Con
?ress. points out that "In the paar IM
will occur the c-rnt.-nnl.il anniversary c.
the founding of th.? city of Washingtor
for the permanent capital of the gov?-ra
nunt of th.? Batted States by author.t?.
of an act of Congress, approved July M
1790"; that "In May. 1800, th?
srahhtas and general ???TIccb of the
IVd? r;t| Civ? rnment w??re removed
to this plue? "; that "?in the 17th
of November, 1M*>. th.- National Congreso
m? t ?hare f?>r ?UM first time, and assume?!
i xi lusive control ??f th.? federal Dlstrl?-I
und city," and that "this Interesting event
assumes all the more significance when
art reedu ?the ?tdrousestaaees attsndlni
th.- ?aneXM?I of the ?Ho, tha naming ol
th?? ?capital in honor of th?- rather of Ml
Country, upd tin- interest taken by hilt
In the adoption of plans for its future Je
\ilopment on a magnificent scab."
XI ?Pi : .?lent says, truly: "Those orig
inal plans have been wrought out with o
Bonstant progress and a signal ?suooosg
? v? n b? % ?iiit anything tholr framers couhl
have foreseen," und that "the people ol
the country are Justly proud of the 01s
Unctlve beaaty and government of thi
capital, and of the rare instruments o(
i? nee and education which hero find
i hi ir natural home."
He ?refers t? ?the movement lately ?sa?
sugurated ?by ?the citlaans ol Washington
t?? haw tif anniversary roUbrated with
.- , "including, perhaps,
?iiiishinei'i ot ? handsome i?r
tnaiicnt memorial to mark ?so i?i torlcal
. ion, and to five it more than
ignition," and ho makes the very
i commendation that "Congress
?pant an appropriation fr,r this ?purpose
?ral th? appointment of a committee from
CtlVS bodies. It might also b??
ulvisable," he says, "to authorize the
nt to appoint a cotnmltt?- from
the country at large, which, acting with
tbs congressional and District of Colnm
Ma ?Comarittssa, can complete tin- plans
r??r an appropriate national c bbratlon."
We trust this snggestloa Of the ITesI
i? ;;t's will bear ?flOOd and ample fruit.

PRESIDENT AMI (TRREN-CY.
In that part of the President's annuel
message, submitted to Congroaa Mon
day. In which h<* deals with the currency
question, ho says that In hla Judament
the present condition of the Treasiny
amply Justifies the Imm?diat?? enactment
of the legislation he recommended or.
year a<-n, umier which a portion of the
gold holdings should be placed In a trust
fund from which ?/reenbacka should be
r, ,l< ? BbSd upon presentation, but when
saos rede?m,?l should not thereafter be
paid otit except for gold. It Is not to l-e
Inferred, however, he adds, that other
legislation relating to our currency Is n ,t
rc-uind; on the contrary, there is an
obvious Ssasaad for it.
Thin means that the Presld-nt Is now,
H he was a year ai*o, In sympathy witn
the general financial theories ami plan
of baaklag sad currency reform of Bsere
tary-of-the-Tr? asuiy Cage. Just here It
Is not asessSSry to go Into the details
??f the ??age plan, eseept in so far as it
proviiies for retiring government not??.
This provision Is embraced in the that
section of a bill which at the last i?>s
Blon "f Cnngryss was formulated up ?n
Mr. QagS'S reCOmmendatlone, and a sum
mary of that section Is as follows;
"It establishes In the Treasury De*j ?rr
m? n, a division to be hhoWU ?is tag <h
vision of issu?? and redemption. To this
?iivisi.in is t?, be transfsned a fund ol
t_B,W0,OQ*J In gol'l '??in and bullion, a i?l
silver dollars and bullion, equal to the
Outstanding Silver certllteates and Trea
sury notes of 1S90. The division Is to have
charge of all business relating to t;-?
Issus, redemption, and exchange of ait
forms of United States money, notes,
and coin. The S, cr-t.try is also autho
rised to make any exchanges that he
may ,1,-em best between tin- funds in th?*
redemption division and th.- gen? ral
funds of the Treasury. When Treasury
notes and silver certificates an- redeem?
, ,i. ih? y are t.? be h -,<i as part "i the
redemption fund, end are only to be ?,?
burssd upon th?- receipt of an equivalent
amooal .i t!i.- coin in which ths
w? re redeemed.
in view, however, of the President's r,
endorsement of Mr. Qage, an Insight Into
the latt.T's Ideas BS ," the working o?
his system may not prove uninteresting,
and this wl get f i ?mi his annual report!
"The argument against government i
of paper money as a medium tor
ooanaercial ? -changes," says Mr. i
"hag been tally msds sad ?i.i not be

Important links in that chain of arfci:

that he shall n??t go outside "t bis duty
if he ventures to notai out th sdvai I
to the poorer districts <-f th?? country of
a "properly-Constituted banking cur
rency," and after deocriblng the ootu
of the financial movement in the United

th- legsl-tender paper money of th,
ernment."
In concluiling his discussion of this sub
ject, Mr. Qage, while declaring ,h |
would not offer the Canadian syetem '?
a model from which we should mak i ,,-,
exact OOpy," leads us to believe that no
would modify his plan largely according
to that system in many of Its essentials.

SCROFULA
It is Foul
Blood's
ment
Advertise
But It is Soon Cured by Hood's
Sarsaparilia.
Yes, Scrofula, if anything, may be called
the advertisement of foul blood. It ia tho
scourge of the world ?offensive, painful,
debilitating, stubborn and well nigh
unendurable.
Outward applications do not cure, they
only drive the difficulty to new quartern.
Emollients may polliate, they cannot
abolish the evil. There is but one sure
way out, aud that is to eliminate the
taint from the blood.
There Is one remedy that can effect this,
and it is the onlv one that, so far bs wo
know, ha? almost invariably succeeded ?
even where the system has been poisoned
by long years of taint, and the ravages to
be repaired are tremendous. That remedy
is I ?o? id's ?Sarsaparilia. Read this :
"My daughter was afflicted with im
pure blood. There were running Bores
all over her body and they caused her
much suffering. We tried medicines thai
were recommended as blood puriliors,
but could not see that they did suy good.
A friend told me about Hood's ?Sarsapa
rille and I begun giving the girl this med
icine. The result was that she was per
fectly cured after taking a few bottles.
She has had no symptoms of scrofula
sores since thst time." ?MAURA 51.
Smith, South Middloboro, Mass.
