Pierce. Since 18C8 the number of sen
ators of the ex-presidential class would
never have risen above two. It Is pos
sible that the very fewness of surviv

time has militated against national ac

minds us that William J. Bryan, just
before he started on his tour around
the world, stated he was thinking ser

platform. It Is feared that Mr. Bryan
has delayed the move too long; but
perhaps a writ of restitution is still
available.
Mark Twain's Temerity.
Mark Twain, 71 years "young," has
celebrated his perennial youth by set
ting a new winter fashion in dress
Arrayed in the whitest of serge appar
el, he has made Washington shiver
with astonishment. The burden of
amazement is over Mark's temerity in
departing from the prevailing style.
But he is young-old or old youn
enough to assert a sartorial Individ
uality.
In fact Dr. Clemens means that his
defection in raiment shall be inter
preted as an open attack on the
"frights" to which man is condemned
by freakish arbiters. He may not yet
realize what mischief he is likely to
play with the manly mode. Wbat he
has done In a perfectly natural course
of evolution others may dare to do. In
stead of postrlty cherishing his mem
ory as that of the greatest joker, it is
apt to remember him as the great
apostle of freedom in dress.
When he claims this snow white suit
as his uniform, Mark is simply insist
ing upon everyone inventing his own
line of wardrobe. He admires the
peek-a-boo waists and the low necks
and the short sleeves, but he sharply
notes that none of them are alike
while the men folks look like crows in
evening dress and mudhooks in their
daily dingies.
Mark's effort In his "cheerup'
clothes is simply carrying out his philo
sophy that a man is as young as he
feels and "glad rags" help him to
realize immortal youth.
Although Senator Piatt of New York
Is feeble in the extreme and moves
about only with great difficulty he has
savage aversion to anyone hinting at
his condition. He tottered out of the
senate while the president's message
was being read and made for a wait
ing carriage. A stiff breeze blew his
coat tails wildly about and his thin
frame shook like a reed. A capitol
policeman made bold to take hold of
the old man's arm as he tried to mount
the steps of the carriage and assist
him to enter. Fiercely the New Yorker
turned on the cop. "What are you do
ing, sir?" snarled the senator. "Only
trying to help you in your carriage,
sir." politely replied the bluecoat, with
a tremor In his voice. "Get away from
me," snapped Senator Piatt imperious
ly; "I don't need the help of you or
anybody else to get into my carriage,"
The policeman scooted back to his
post.
Question of Ex-Precldents.
The story of Mr. Roosevelt's desire
to enter the United States senate at
the close of his career In the VrhIte
bouse, is still in circulation, says the
New York World. Meanwhile, John
Bigelow renews and presents In
pamphlet form his argument for a con
stitutional amendment under which re
tiring presidents shall become sen
ators without further action. "Our
Ex-Presidents," reads Mr. Bigelow's ti
tle; "What Shall We Do for Them?
What Shall They Do for Us?"
The idea of giving senatorial places
to former chief magistrates of the re
public is very old. Under discussion, it
has presented always as a splitting
A Matter of Great Importance.
The problem that has arisen over
the assessment for storm drain pur
poses, of the tract of land presented to
the Rock Island Industrial commission
for factory development, is one that
should command the earnest consider
ation of the city council, and that body
should do all in its power to give sanc
tion and encouragement, to a project of
such vital importance to the city. The
generous donors of the land placed at
the disposal of new industries, had no
intimation of the fact that an assess
ment had been levied against it,
amounting, practically, to confiscation
of the ground, owing to the fact that
the ordinary means of notification
were ignored in this instance and it
was not until the Industrial commis
sion had taken control of the ground
for the purposes designed and had al
ready secured one new factory that the
actual situation developed.
The storm drain proposition is an
important one in itself, and it is to be
regretted that any proceeding in con
nection with its construction should
have arisen, that might just have been
avoided at the proper time. As it is,
the council is confronted with a condi
tion that demands immediate adjudica
tion, for upon it depends the carrying
forward of the great work that has
been undertaken by the Industrial
commission for pushing forward Rock
Island's new factory district.
The Argus, for its own part, has no
doubt that the council will be equal to
the emergency that presents itself and
will without delay give its cooperation
to the efforts that are being made to
convert unused lands in the lower end
of the city to a hive of industry.

Cleanest Manufacturing Process Ii
That or An American Brewery.
We regard beer as a food and the
business of brewing beer one of our
most important Industries. When we
tell our readers that without exception
there Is no other brewery in the world
so absolutely clean In its process of
manufacture as Pabst, we speak from
exact knowledge of conditions. The
monster Pabst Brewery at Milwaukee
represents an outlay of millions of
dollars and many of those millions
have been expended to make the Pabst
exclusive process absolutely clean.
Pabst Beer stands alone today, the only
food product that from the beginning
point of opinion the question as to the J01 5nd i ,ts manufacture is abso
v . , . lutely beyond reach of even the con-
vuuiig power in me new ciass oi sen
ators. Mr. Bigelow meets the point
squarely. "Each senator shall have
one vote." This is a proposition to
overthrow the principle of state equal
ity in the senate, without the accept
ance of . which the constitution itself
would have failed of adoption. Objec
tions to this change are not met by
Mr. Bigelow's argument based upon
differences in state populations.
It was because there were big states
and smaller ones that the rule of two
senators each was fixed. Representa
tion on a popular basis was left to the
other house of congress.
Until the last spark of jealousy be
tween states shall be extinguished
there will be little hope for Mr. Bige
low's scheme entire. General consent
might be obtained to a proposition that
former presidents should sit as honor
ary members and advisers of the sen
ate. But this position of limited use
fulness would scarcely satisfy the as
pirations of a man like Mr. Roosevelt,
leaving the presidency as he will do at
El. still full of strenuous impulses and
Ideas.
Had It been arranged at the begin
taminating germs of the air.
Doctors boll their Instruments in
water to sterilize them. Pabst boils
his brew In closed kettles and thus
sterilizes It. From there It passes
through sterilized pipes to sterilized
hermetically sealed tanks where It
Is fermented. Then through more
sterilized pipes it goes to sterilized
hermetically sealed storage tanks
and when bottled it is pasteurized.
Throughout the entire process it never
Is touched by human hands and comes
in contact only with sterilized air.
This process of manufacture is the
exclusive Pabst method. It Is one rea
son for the "always the same, always
the best" reputation of Pabst Beer.
The cleanest beer and the richest
beer, Pabst Beer has no equal as a
mild, healthful beverage. It is brewed
only from Pabst eight-day malt,
choicest hops and pure water. Pabst
eight-day malt,, the perfect malt, con
tains all the food qualities of the finest
barley in predigested' form. It is this
high food value and the Pabst exclu
sive process of brewing and thoroughly
aging the beer, that gives Pabst beer Its
rich, mellow flavor, its refreshing zest.

Origlnal-1
From the time that Dermot, one of
the early kings of Ireland, invited the
English to come and assist him in his
struggles with bis Irish foes, thus giv
ing the Britons a foothold In Ireland.
the Irish people, were in a constant
state of rebellion. One rising after an
other took place, only to be suppressed
In the end, when the leader or leaders
were, if apprehended, executed. The
counties into which Ireland, is divided
were each in those days ruled by its
sovereign, whose name was precede-!
by the letter "O." From these sprang
the O'Neills, the O'Gradys, the O'Con
nells and others.
It was during the reign of the pro
tector, Oliver Cromwell, that Thomas
O'Douohue, a young patriot, wooed
and won Aileen Mavourneen, one of
those Irish girls celebrated for their
fair complexions, their blue eyes and
their musical voices. O'Donohue's fa
ther, a ruler, had been beheaded dur
ing the reign of Charles I. At the
time of bis father's death Thouiaj was
but seven years old. He then vowed
that when he grew to manhood he
would devote his life to driving out
the English. So revered was the name
of the father that when the son came
of age and succeeded to his great land
ed estates his people, who were grlev
ously oppressed, looked to him to do
something for them.
The nuptials between Thomas O'Don
ohue and Aileen Mavourneen had
scarcely been celebrated before the
young husband, joining forces with a
neighboring ruler, beaded a rebellion
against the English. At first be was
successful, but owing to the treachery
of his colleague, who made peace with
the common euemy and turned against
him, O'Donohue was defeated. Flee
ing with a few followers, he lived a
wretched life, hiding in bog or forest,
and was at last captured in a starving
condition.
He was tried and sentenced to be
beheaded. At first his young wife
seemed about to break down under the
tragedy to be enacted, but soon rallied
and with remarkable concentration f
a suddenly developed energy laid plans
for her husband's rescue. She thought
out a method of getting bim out of bis
Jail and induced some of his faithful
adherents to have a ship ready on the
coast to take him to France in case her
ruse was successful.
She sought permission of the con
queror to spend a 6hort time with the
condemned man in his cell on the night
preceding his execution. Captivated by
her youth, her beauty and her tears,
he consented. On the evening in ques
tion she appeared at the prison door
attended by her 6ister Kathleen. The
two women entered O'Donohue's cell
and were left alone with him. They
remained half an hour. When they
emerged Kathleen almost carried her
sister, who appeared to be convulsed
with grief, her face resting on Kath
leen's shoulder. The jailers stood about
pitying the young wife who bad bid
farewell to ber husband, leaving him to
the dread ordeal of the morning. The
two women entered a "chair" and
were carried away.
Coming to a wood, the door of the
chair flew open, and a man, throwing
off woman's apparel, sprang out. An
other stepped from the wood leading a
horse, which O'Donohue for it was he
mounted and, with a wave of his
hand to those he left, dashed away Into
the forest.
At the usual hour for visiting the
prisoner to see that all was well for
the night the keeper went to his cell.
He found O'Donohue kneeling by his
cot, his face buried in it. Touched by
the sight, as well as the sad visit that
had so lately occurred, the jailer asked
In a kindly tone:
Is there anything I can do for your
comfort?"
O'Donohue did not reply. Then the
ailer was struck with the diminutive
size of the prisoner.
"Speak, man," he said sharply. "Is
there anything I can do for you?"
"Nothing," came the reply In a voice
which was manifestly disguised and
which, notwithstanding an effort to
make it sound like a man's, was evi
dently a woman's.
Like a flash the Jailer unlocked the
cell, entered and, seizing the prisoner,
pulled him up and looked into bis face.
He saw Aileen O'Donohue. He start
ed to leave the cell to give the alarm
when Aileen attempted with her deli
cate hands to hold him, but be broke
away, and soon horsemen were dash
ing in every direction to recapture the
escaped prisoner.
The difficulty in the way of the pris
oner coming out of Jail by personat
ing his wife had been that he was
much taller than 6he. To reduce his
height he sank upon Kathleen in order
that by drawing up his knees under
his skirts his real height might not
appear, and he buried his face upon
her shoulder that his features might
not be seen.
O'Donohue, who knew every road.
forest and bog in Ireland and who had
been provided with the best horse that
could be found, took a course that en
abled him to baffle his pursuers and,
reaching the coast, embarked for
France, where he arrived in due time.
Cromwell, dreading lest he should re
turn to Ireland later on and Inaugurate
another rebellion, sent Aileen to him
with an offer of a pardon and restora
tion of his estates provided he would
wear allegiance to the English sov
ereign. O'Donohue accepted the con-
editions and, returning to Ireland, lived
happily with the wife who had saved
