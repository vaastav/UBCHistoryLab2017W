notify advertisers that if they patron

UAKES RECOMMENDATIONS
Eulogizes the Late President McKinley and Advocates Stern Measures
for Anarchists Proposes Trust Legislation Along the Lines of Pub
licityFavors Government Construction of Irrigation Works
Urges Construction of Isthmian Canal and Laying of Pa
cific Cable Asks Legislation for the Colonies and
Reciprocity for Cuba
Thfl following is a comprehensive sum-
Wary of President Roosevelt's message to
congress:
The president begins his first annual
communication With an official announce
ment of the death of the late President
Mh.iiiley, and a eulogy of his former
Chief in which he says:
"It is not too much to say that at the
time of President McKlnley's death he
was the most widely-loved man in all the
United States, while we have never had
any public man of his position who has
been BO Wholly free from the bitter anl-
. tnbsltles Incident to public life. His po-
litical opponents were the first to bear
io nearuest ana most generous iriDutv
to the broad kindliness of nature, the
sweetness and gentleness of character
which so endeared him to his close asso
ciates. To a standard of lofty integrity
A bublic life he united the tender affec
tions and home virtues which are all
important in the makeup of national
character. A gallant soldier in the great
war for the union, he also shone as an
example to all our people because of his
conduct In the most sacred and intimate
of home relations. There could be no
personal hatred of him, for he never act
ed with aught but consideration for the
welfare of others. No one could fail to
respect him who knew him In public or
private life. The defenders of those mur
derous criminals who seek to excuse their
criminality by asserting that it is exer
cised for political ends Inveigh against
wealth and irresponsible power. But for
this assassination even this base apology
cannot be urged."
"The shock, the grief of the country, are
bitter In the minds of all who saw the
dark days while the president yet hovered
between life and death. At last the Iisht
was stilled in the kindly eyes, and the
breath went from the lips that even In
mortal agony uttered no words save of
forgiveness to his murderer, of love for
his friends and of unfaltering trust in the
will of the Most High. Such a death
crowning the glory of such a life leaves
us with Infinite sorrow, but with such
Sride in what he had accomplished and in
is own personal character that we feel
the blow not as struck at him, but as
struck at the nation. We mourn a good
and great president who is dead, but
while we mourn we are lifted up by the
splendid achievements of his life and the
Srand heroism with which he met his
eath.
"When we turn from the man to the na
tion, the harm done is so great as to ?x
cite our gravest apprehensions and to de
mand our wisest and most resolute ac
tion. This criminal was a professed an
archist. Inflamed by the teachings of pro
fessed anarchists and probably also by
the reckless utterances of those who on
the stump and in the public press appeal
to the dark and evil spirits of malice and
greed, envy and sullen hatred. The wind
Is sowed by the men who preach such
doctrines, and they cannot escape their
share of responsibility for the whirlwind
that is reaped. This applies alike to the
deliberate demagogue, to the exploiter
of sensationalism and to the crude and
foolish visionary who for whatever rea
son apologizes for crime or excites aim
less discontent.
"The blow was aimed not at this presi
dent, but at all presidents, at every sym
bol of government. President McKinley
was as emphatically the embodiment of
the popular will of the nation expressed
through the forms of law as a New Eng
land town meeting Is in similar fashion
the embodiment of the law abiding pur
pose and practice of the people of the
town. On no conceivable theory could
the murder of the president be accepted
as due to protest against "inequalities in
the social order" save as the murder of
all the freemen engaged in a town meet
ing could be accepted as a protest against
that social inequality which puts a male
factor In jail. Anarchy is no more an ex
pression of "social discontent" than pick
ing pockets or wife beating."
In the same connection he makes
strong recommendations as to how the
nation should deal with anarchy. He
urges that the preaching or teaching of
anarchy be not permitted, and requests
congress to enact legislation that will
prevent anarchists from foreign countries
landing upon our shores. He would also
have the federal courts given Jurisdiction
over any man who kills, or attempts to
kill, the president of the country, or any
person who is in line for succession to
the presidency. He has no fear, however,
that the country will ever fall into an
archy. "The federal courts should be given Jur
isdiction over any man who kills or at
tempts to kill the president or any man
who by the constitution or by law Is in
line of succession for the presidency,
while the punishment for an unsuccessful
attempt should be proportioned to the
enormity of the offense against our in
stitutions. Anarchy Is a crime against the whole
human race, and all mankind should band
against the anarchist. His crime should
be made an offense against the law of
nations, like piracy and that form of man
stealing known as the slave trade, for It
is of far blacker infamy than either. It
should be so declared by treaties among
all civilized powers. Such treaties would
give to the federal government the power
of dealing with the crime."
The Trusts.
The president sees cause for congratu
lation lor the nation in the business condi
tions of the present, but sees in the "tre
mendous and highly complex industrial
development which went on with ever ac
celerated rapidity during the latter half
of the nineteenth century" a serious social
problem for the present and future. He
does not believe that the old laws and old
customs are sufficient to regulate the ac
cumulation and distribution of wealth ot
the present time. He does not attribute
the creation of great corporate fortunes
to the existence of a protective tariff, "nor
to any other governmental action, but to
natural causes in the business world, op
erating In other countries as they operate
In our own." In this connection he says:
"The process has aroused much antago
nism, a great part of which is wholly
without warrant. It Is not true that as
the rich have grown richer the poor have
grown poorer. On the contrary, never be
fore has the average man, the wage
worker, the farmer, the small trader,
been so well off as In this country and
at the present time. There have been
abuses connected with .the accumulation
of wealth, yet it remains true that a for
tune accumulated In legitimate business
can be accumulated by the person spe
cially benefited only on condition ot con
ferring immense incidental benefits upon
others. Successful enterprise of the type
which benefits all mankind can only ex
ist If the conditions are such as to offer
great prizes as the rewards of success."
But while he realizes existing condi
tions, he emphasizes the fact that congress
In providing remedies must act with cau
tion, as the men -and corporations "who
have built up our commerce and driven our
railroads across the continent have done
great good to our people, and without
them the material development of which
we are so justly proud could never have
taken place. Moreover, we should recog
nize the Immense importance to this ma
terial development of leaving as unham
pered aa Is compatible with the public
good the strong and forceful men upon
whom the success of business operatiohs
Inevitably rests. The slightest study of
business conditions will satisfy anyone
capable of forming a judgment that the
personal equation is the most important
factor in a business operation: that the
business ability of the man at the head of
any business concern, big or little. Is usual
ly the factor which fixes the gulf between
striking aueeesa and hopeless failure."
Another reason for caution in trust legis
lation which he gives "is to be found In the
International commercial conditions of to
day. The same business conditions which
have produced the great aggregationa of
corporate and Individual wealth have
made them very potent factors in inter
national commercial competition. Busi
ness concerns which have the largest
means at their disposal and are managed
by the ablest men are naturally those
which takeetfie lead In the strife for com
mercial tremcjr among the nations of

i the world. America has only Just begun
Id assume that commanding position in
the international business world whirh
we believe will more and more be hers. It
is of the utmost importance that this po
sition be not jeoparded, especially at a time
when the overflowing abundance of our
own natural resources and the skill, busi
ness energy and mechanical aptitude of
our people make foreign markets essen
tial. Under such conditions it would be
most unwise to cramp or to fetter the
youthful strength of our nation.
"Moreover, it cannot too often be pointed
out that to strike with ignorant violence
at the interests of one set of men almost
Inevitably endangers the interests of all.
The fundamental rule in our national life,
therule which underlies all others, is that
on the whole and in the long run we shall
go up or down together. There are excep
tions, and in timet of prosperity some will
prosper far more and In times of adversi
ty some will suffer far more than others;
but, speaking generally, a period of good
times means that all share more or less
in them, and in a period of hard times all
feel the stress to a greater or less degree."
He points to the fact that in the past
"the ignorant or reckless agitator has
been the really effective friend of the
evils which he has been nominally oppos
ing In dealing with business interests
for the government to undertake by
crude and ill-considered legislation to do
what may turn out to be bad would be
to incur the risk of such far-reaching na
tional disaster that it would be prefer
able to undertake nothing at all. The
men who demand the Impossible or the
undesirable serve as the allies of the
forces with which they are nominally at
war, for they hamper those who would
endeavor to find out in rational fashion
what the wrongs really are and to what
extent and in what manner it is prac
ticable to apply remedies."
Remedies (or the Trust Evil.
But while he says the above is true, he
vet sees many evils for which there should
be remedies provided. Of these evils the
ch'.of is over capitalization, "because of
Its many baleful consequences ."' He siys:
"The conviction of the American people
that the great corporations, known ; s
trusts, are In certain of their features and
tendencies hurtful to the general welfare,
is based upon sincere conviction that com
bination and concentration should be not
prohibited, but supervised and within
reasonable limits controlled, and in my
judgment this conviction is right."
As a remedy for these evils he says:
"The first essential In determining how
to deal with the great industrial com
binations is knowledge of the facts
publicity. In the interest of the public
the government should have the right to
inspect and examine the workings of
the great corporations engaged in inter
state business. Publicity is the only sure
remedy which we can now invoke. What
further remedies are needed in the way
of governmental regulation or taxation
can only be determined after publicity
has been obtained by process of law and
in the course of administration. The first
requisite is knowledge, full and complete
knowledge which may be made public
to the world.
"Artificial bodies, such as corporations
and joint stock or other associations de
pending upon any statutory law for their
existence or privileges, should be subject
to proper governmental supervision, and
full and accurate Information as to their
operations should be made public regu
larly at reasonable intervals."
"The large corporations, commonly
called trusts, though organized in one
state, always do business In many states,
often doing very little business in the
state where they are Incorporated. There
Is utter lack of uniformity in the state
laws about them, and as no state has
any exclusive Interest In or power over
their acts it has in practice proved Im
possible to get adequate regulation
through state action. Therefore in the
Interest of the whole people the nation
should, without interfering with the pow
er of the states in the matter Itself, also
assume power of supervision and regula
tion over all corporations doing an inter
state business. This is especially true
where the corporation derives a portion
of Its wealth from the existence of some
monopolistic element or tendency in its
business. There would be no hardship in
such supervision. Banks are subject to
it. and in their case it Is now accepted
as a simple matter of course. Indeed it
is probable that supervision of corpora
tions by the national government need
not go so far as is now the case with the
supervision exercised over them by so
conservative a state as Massachusetts in
order to produce excellent results.
"When the constitution was adopted, at
the end of the eighteenth century, no hu
man wisdom could foretell the sweeping
changes, alike In industrial and political
conditions, which were to take place by
the beginning of the twentieth century.
At that time It was accepted as a matter
of course that the several states were the
proper authorities to regulate so far as
was then necessary the comparatively In
significant and strictly localized corporate
bodies of the day. The conditions are now
wholly different, and wholly different ac
tion is called for. I believe that a law
can be framed which will enable the na
tional government to exercise control
along the lines above Indicated, profiting
by the experience gained through the" pas
sage and administration of the interstate
commerce act. If. however, the judgment
of the congress is that it lacks the consti
tutional power to pass such an act, then
a constitutional amendment should -be
submitted to confer the power."
In connection with the trusts he rec
ommends legislation creating a cabinet of
ficer, to ho kiowu t-s secretary of : ni
ne ce, whose tit ties won! be to deal
with all qu .Uons concern , g commerce,
letrr and tin mtthant manne.
Would Kxclude the Chinese.
The message ')ti,ains a strong recom
mendation for t! e reenactment at ..ru e
of the present Chinese exclusion act, in
which connection he says:
"Wages are higher to-day In the United
States than ever before In our history
and far higher than in any other coun
try. The standard of living is also higher
than ever before. Every effort of o-is-lator
and administrator should be bent to
secure the permanency of this condition
of things and its Improvement wherever
possible. Not only must our labor be
protected by the tariff, but It should also
be protected so far as it Is possible from
the presence In this country of any la
borers brought over by contract or of
those who, coming freely, yet represent
a standard of living so depressed that
they can undersell our men in the labor
market and drag them to a lower level:
I regard It as necessary, with this end
in view, to reenact immediately the law
excluding Chinese laborers and to
strengthen it wherever necessary In or
der to make its enforcement entirely ef
fective." "The national government should de
mand the highest quality of service from
Its employes and in return it should be a
good employer. If possible, legislation
should be passed In connection with the
interstate commerce law which will ren
der effective the efforts of different
states to do away with the competition
of convict contract labor in the open la
bor market. So far as practicable un
der the conditions of government work
provision should be made to render the
enforcement of the eight-hour law easy
and certain. In all Industries carried on
directly or indirectly for the United
States government women and children
should be protected from excessive hours
of labor, from niflht work and from work
under unsanitary coiflitiona. The gov
ernment should prosj'tfe-in -ltscpiitracta

iu me labor unions of the present he sees
much that is good, In which connection he
says:
"Very great good has bean and will be
accomplished by associations or Unions
ot wageworkers when . managed with
forethought and When they cembihg .in
sistence, upon theiy awn. Hgh.il s,jtl law
abiding respeel for the rights bf others.
The ditpiay bt these qualities in such
bodies is a. duty to the nation fib less
than to . the . associations themselves.
i Finally there must also in many cases he
tfMfction Mr the government in order to
saieguara tne ngnts una interests or ail.
Under our constitution there is much
more scope for such action by the state
and the municipality than by the, nation.
But on points such as those touched On
above the national government can act. ,
"When all is said and done, the rule or
brotherhood remains as the indispensable
prerequisite .to success In the kind of na
tional life for which we strive. Each
man must work for himself, and unless
he so works no outside help can avail
him. But each man must remember also
that he is indeed his brother's keeper,
and that while no man who refuses to
walk can be carried with advantage to
himself or anyone else, v that each at
times stumbles or halts, that each at
times needs to have the helping hand out
stretched to him. To be permanently efj
fective aid must always take the form 6f
helping a man to help himself, and wa
can all best help ourselves by jolhrhg to
gether in the work that la or common in
terest to all."
The tmmiarratlon Uwi.
t nrnnniirtcFH our oresent Immigration
laws unsatisfactory. In which connection
hk says "we need every honest and ef
ficient imm'grant fitted to become an
American citizen, every immigrant who
comes here to stay, who brings hsre a
strong body, a good head and a resolute
purpose to do his duty well in every way
and to bring up is children as law-abiding.
Gort-ltaring members of the community.
But he says:
"There should be a comprehensive law
enacted with the object of working a
threefold improvement over our present
system First, we should aim to exclude
absolutely not only all persons who are
known to be believers in anarchistic prin
ciples or members of anarch'.stij socie
ties, but also all persons who are of a
low moral tendency or of unsavory repu
tation. This means that we should re
quire a more thorough system of inspec
tor n abroad and a more rig'd system of
exam. n, tion at our immigration ports,
the fo.-mer being especially necessary.
"The second object of a proper immi
gration law ought to be to se-.-ire by a
careful and not merely perfunctory edu
cational test some intelligent capacity to
appreciate American institutions and act
sanely as American citizens. This would
not keep out all anarchists, for many of
them belong to the intelligent criminal
class, but it would do what is also in point
that is, tend to decrease the sum of ig
norance so potent in producing the envy,
suspicion, malignant passion and hatred
of order out of which anarchistic senti
ment inevitably springs. Finally all per
sons should he excluded who are below
a certair standard of economic fitness to
enter our lnviustna! field as competitors
with American labor. There should be
proper proof of personal capacity to, earn
an American living and enough money to
insure a r.ecent start under American con
ditions. This would step the influx of cheap
labor and the resultirg competition which
gives rise to so much of bitterness in
American industrial l!fe. and it would dry
uo the springs of the pestilential social
conditions in our great cities where an
archistic organizations have their great
est possibility of growth.
"Both the educational and economic tests
in a wise Immigration law should be de
signed to protect and elevate the general
body, political and social. A very close su
pervision should be exercised over the
steamship companies which mainly bring
over the Immigrants, and they should be
held to a strict accountability for any in
fraction of the law."
The Tariff.
The president does not desire any change
In the present tariff schedule except where
such may be made in reciprocity treaties,
and recommends the adoption of reciproc
ity treaties and the general policy of reci
procity as a means of opening the doors of
foreign nations to our commerce, in which
connection he says:
"Every application of our tariff policy to
meet our shifting national needs must be
conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the
duties must never be reduced below the
point that will cover the difference between
the labor cost here and abroad. The well
being of the wageworker is a prime consid
eration of our entire policy of economic
legislation.
"Subject to this proviso of the proper
protection necessary to our industrial
well being at home the principle of reci
procity must command our hearty sup
port. The phenomenal growth of our
export trade emphasizes the urgency of
the need for wider markets and for a lib
eral policy in dealing with foreign na
tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex
atious in the way of trade restrictions
should be avoided. The customers to
whom we dispose of our surplus products
In the long run directly or indirectly pur
chase those surplus products by giving us
something In return. Their ability to pur
chase our products should as far as pos
sible be secured by so arranging our tar
iff as to enable us to take from them
those products which we can use without
harm to our own industries and labor or
the use of which will be of marked benefit
to us.
"It is most Important' that we should
maintain the high level of our present
prosperity. We have now reached the
point in the development of our interests
where we are not only able to supply our
own markets, but to produce a constantly
growing surplus for which we must find
markets abroad. To secure these markets
we can utilize existing duties in any case
where they are no lor.ger needed for the
purpose of protection, or In any case
where the article is not produced here
and the duty is no longer necessary for
revenue, as giving us something to offer
in exchange for what we ask. The cor
dial relations with other nations which
are so desirable will naturally be pro
moted by the course thus required by our
own Interests.
"The natural line of development for a
policy of reciprocity will be In connection
with those of our productions which no
longer require all of the support once
needed to establish them upon a sound
basis, and with those others where either
because of natural or of economic causes
we are beyond the reach ot successful
competition.
"I ask the attention of the senate to the
reciprocity treaties laid before it by my
predecessor."
The Merchant Marine.
The president pronounces our merchant
marine "discreditable to us as a nation and
Insignificant to that of other nations which
we overtop in other forms of business,"
and says we "should not longer submit to
conditions under which only a trifling por
tion of our great commerce is carried in
our own ships. Of this he says:
"To remedy this state of things would not
merely serve to bulid up our shipping in
terests, but it would 8l?-o result In benefit
to all who are interested in the perma
nent establishment of ; wider market for
American products ar.d would provide an
auxiliary force for the ravy. Ships work
for their own ccurtrles just as railroads
work for their terminal points. Shipping
linis. If fstabllshe-i to the principal coun
tries with which we have dealings, would
be of political as well as commercial ben
efit. From every standpoint It is unwise
for the United tate. to continue to rely
upon the ships of competing nations for the
distribution of on. goods. It should be
made advantageous to carry American
goods in American built ships."
His recommeiuihiicn on this subject is
only that "our government should take
such action as will remedy these inequali
ties. The American merchant marine
should be restored to the ocean."
Finances.
Under this heading the president recom
mends such legislation as will better safe
guard against the deranging influences of
commercial crises aiid financial panics and
such as will make the currency of the
country mare responsive to the demands
of domestic trade and commerce.
He points out the tact that the receipts
from duties -in Imports ar.d Internal taxes
exceed the expt nc'tui t-s of the govern
ment, but counsels 3.;..r,st reducing the
revenues Eo-that time wit! be the possi
bility of a deficit.
"But after providing against any such
contlm.Tcr.cy .Leans should be adopted
which will bring the revenues more nearly
within the limit of our actual needs."
He urges the necessity for strict economy
In expenditures, but that "our national
needs forbid us to be niggardly in the mat
ter of providing whatever is actually nec
essary to our well-being."
Inter-Stnto Commerce.
He points to defects in the interstate
commerce law, and recommends amend

he says:
"Those who complain of the management

Asrlealtarai Interest;
The president cites the forest legislation
8f the past and the great good of forest
preserves to the people; and says they will
inevitably be of still greater value. Con
tinuing, he says:
"At present the protection Of the forest
reserves rests with the general land office;
the mapping and description of their tim
ber with the United States geological urr
Vev and the breoaration of Diana far their
conservative use with the bureau of for
estry, wnicn is also cnargea witn tne gen
eral advancement oi practical forestry tn
the United States. These various func
tions should be united in the bureau of
forestry, to which they properly belorg.
The present diffusion of responsibility is
bad from every standpoint. It prevents
tnai enective cooperation Dei ween tne
government and the men who utilize the
resources of the reserves, without which
the interests of both must suffer. The
scientific bureaus generally should tie put
under the department of agriculture. The
president snouia nave oy law tne power
of transferrin lands for iise as forest re
serves to the department Of agriculture.
ne already has sucn power in the case 01
lands needed by the departments of Wat
and the navy."
Irrigation.
Irrigation In connection with the waste
lands of the west is a question to which
the president gives considerable attention,
and makes strong recommendations lor
government assistance in reclaiming the
waste lands by assisting in their irriga
tion and the control of water rights wher
ever that is possible, and of this he says:
in tne aria region it is water, not iana.
Which measures nroductlon. The western
half of the United States would sustain a
population greater than that ot our whole
country to-oay if the waters that now run
to waste were saved and used tor irriga
tion. The forest and water problems are
perhaps the most vital internal Questions
of the United States.
"In cases where natural conditions have
been restored for a few years vegetation
nas again carpeted tne grouno, Dims ana
deer are coming back, and hundreds of
persons, especially from the immediate
neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy
the privilege of camping. Some at least
of the forest reserves should afford per
petual protection to the native fauna and
flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly
diminishing wild animals of the larger
kinds and free camping grounds for the
ever-increasing numbers of men and wom
en who have learned to find rest, health
and recreation in the splendid forests and
nower-ciaa meaaows of our mountains.
The forest reserves should be set apart
forever for the use and benefit of our peo
ple as a whole and not sacrificed to the
shortsighted greed of a few."
"The forests alone cannot, however, fully
regulate and conserve the waters of the
arid region. Great storage works are nec
essary to equalize the flow of streams and
to save the nood waters. Their construc
tion has been conclusively shown to be an
undertaking too vast for private effort.
Nor can it be best accomplished by the in
dividual states acting alone. Far-reaching
interstate problems are involved, and the
resources of single states would often be
maoequate. it Is properly a national
function, at least In some of its features.
It is as right for the national government
to make the streams and rivers of the
arid region useful by engineering works
for water storage as to make useful the
rivers and harbors of the humid region by
engineering works of another kind. The
storing of the floods in reservoirs at the
headwaters of our rivers is but an en
largement of our present policy of river
control under which levees are built on
the lower reaches of the same streams.
"The government should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as it does other
public works. Where their purpose is to
regulate the flow of streams the water
should be turned freely into tne cnanneis
in the dry season to take the same course
under the same laws as the natural flow.
"The reclamation and settlement of the
arid lands will enrich every portion of
our country, just as the settlement of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought pros
perity to the Atlantic states. The in
creased demand for manufactured arti
cles will stimulate industrial production,
while wider home markets and the trade
of Asia will consume the larger food sup
plies and effectually prevent western
competition with eastern agriculture. In
deed, the products of irrigation will be
consumed chiefly in upbuilding local cen
ters of mining and other industries which
would otherwise not come into existence
at ail. Our people as a whole will profit,
for successful homemaking is but another
name for the upbuilding of the nation."
He counsels against attempting too much
at the beginning, but advises that we let
experience on a small plan teach the pos
sibilities of greater undertakings. He also
cites the conditions under which the set
tlers of the west are attempting to bund
homes on these arid lands, and says:
"The security and value of the homes
created depend largely on the stability of
titles to water, but the majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of court
decisions rendered in ordinary suits at
law. With a few creditable exceptions,
the arid states have failed to provide for
the certain and just division of streams in
times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws
have made it possible to establish rights
to water In excess of actual uses or ne
cessities, and many streams have already
passed Into private ownership or a control
equivalent to ownership.
"Whoever controls a stream practically
controls the land it renders productive, and
the doctrine of private ownership of water
apart from land cannot prevail without
causing enduring wrong. The recognition
of such ownership, which has been per
mitted to grow up in the arid regions,
should give way to a more enlightened and
larger recognition of the rights of the pub
lic in the control and disposal of the pub
lic water supplies. Laws founded upon
conditions obtaining in humid regions,
where water is too abundant to ju.-,tlfy
hoarding it, have no proper appiication in
a dry country.
"In the arid states the only right to water
which should be recognized is that of use.
In irrigation this right should attach to
the land reclaimed and be inseparable
therefrom. Granting perpetual water
rights to other than users without
compensation to the public is open to all
the objections which apply to giving away
perpetual franchises to the public utili
ties of the cities. A few of the western
states have already recognized this and
have Incornorated in their constitutions
the doctrine of perpetual state ownership
or water.
The Colonies.
Considerable attention Is given the col
onies, and especially the Philippines. This
section of the message begins by citing
the needs of Hawaii and Porto Rico, of
which he says:
"In Hawaii our aim must be to develop
the territory on the traditional American
lines. We do not wish a region of large
estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a
healthy American community of men
who themselves till the farms they own
All our legislation for the Islands should
be shaped with this end in view. The well
being of the average homemaker must
afford the true test of the healthy devel
opment of the islands. The land policy
should as nearly as possible be modeled
nn ntir homestead system."
Of Porto Rico he says the Island is thriv
ing as never Derore, ana is oeing adminis
tered efficiently and honestly. He deems
no legislation necessary ezoept that con'
cernina- the miblic lands of the island.
He calls attention to the fact that in
Cuba the Independent government of the
island will soon be in control, and in the
same connection urges strongly the need
of reciprocal trade relations with the new
nation, upon which subject he says:
"In the case of Cuba there are weighty
reasons of morality and of national Inter
eat why the policy should be held to have
a peculiar application, ar.d I most earnest
ly ask your attention to the wisdom. Indeed
to the vital need, of providing for a sub
stantial reduction in the tariff duties on
Cuban imports into the United States.
Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what
we desired that she should stand in Inter
national matters In closer and more friend
lv relations with us than with any other
power, and we are bound by every consid
eration OK Honor nnu capeuiency 10 pass
commercial measures In the interest of
her material well being."
For the Philippines he recommends much
In the way of legislation, but again coun
sels caution that we go neither too far nor
with too great haste. He says: "We hope
to make our administration of the islands
honorable to our nation by making It of the
highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves,
and as an earnest of what we intend to do
we point to wnai we nave done.
Already a greater measure of material
prosperity and of governmental honesty
and efficiency has been attained in the
Philippines than ever before in their his-
He says we do not desire to do for the
islanders merely wnai nasetsewnereceen
nm for tronic oeoples by even the beat
foreign governments. We hope to do for
them what has never before been done for
any people ot we tropics to mane tnem
fit for self-government after the fashion of
the really free nations."
But the idea of the president is that we
cannot leave tne isiancs at tnis time, of
which he says: "To leave the islands at
this time would mean that they would
fall Into a welter of murderous anarchy
Such a desertion of duty on our part
would be a crime against humanity."
JBut h believes sufficient progress ass
been made aldhg the lines under which we
have been working in the islands to war
rant us In passing new legislation, but In
tnis connection ne urges tne uecu vi -
tion Mm hiivu the tlma has come when
the industries of which the Islands are
capable should he encouraged by granting
franchises for their development, and of
this he says: - .
"Nothing better Can Be dene for the is
lands than te introduce industrial enter
prise; Nothing would benefit them so
much as throwing them open te industrial
development; The connection between
idleness and mischief is proverbial and the
opportunity to do remunerative work is

course ne business man will go into the
rnUfpplnes unless It is te nis miereai
oo so, ana it is immensely to im wki
of the islands that he shouM.se in. It Is
therefore necessary that the eengress
should pass laws by which the resources
of the islands can be developed, so that
franchises (for limited terms of years) can
be granted to companies doing business in
them and eVery encouragement be given
to the incoming of business men of every
kind. .
'Not to Dermit this Is to do a wrong to
the Philippines. The franchises must be
granted and the business permitted only

islands against any kind of improper ex-
nlnitatlnn. Rut the vaaf natural Wealth
of the islands must be developed, and the
capital willing to develop it must be given
tne opportunity. The neia must oe inrown
open to Individual enterprise, which has
been the real factor in the development of
every region over which our flag has flown.
It is Urgently necessary to enact suitable
laws dealing with general transportation,
mining, banking, currency, homesteads and
the use and ownership of the lands and
timber. These laws win give tree piay iu
Industrial enterprise, and the commercial
development which will surely follow will
afford to the people of the Islands the
nest proois oi tne sincerity ot our ucaira
to aidthem." -
The construction of a Pacific cable ia
also urged, either that the government
lay such a cable to connect Hawaii and
the Philippines, or that an arrangement
be made by which the advantages ac
cruing from a government cable may be !
secured to the government by contract
with a private cable company. This he
deems necessary for both commercial,
political and military considerations.
The Isthmian Canal.
He calls attention to the need of aa
isthmian canal, and says:
Its importance to tne nation is oy no
means limited merely to its material ef
fects upon our business prosperity, and
yet with a view to these effects alone it
would be to the last degree important
for us Immediately to begin it. While its
beneficial effects would perhaps be most
marked upon the Pacific coast and the
gulf and south Atlantic states. It would
also greatly benefit other sections. It is
emphatically a work which it Is for the
Interest of the entire country to begin
and complete as soon as possible: it is
one of those great works which only a
great nation can undertake with pros
pects of success and which when done
are not only permanent assets In the na
tion s material interests, oui aianuing
monuments to Its constructive abiuty.
Of the new treaty recently concluded
with England he says: "I am glad to be
able to announce to you that our negotia
tions on this subject with Great Britain,
conducted on both sides in a spirit ox
friendliness and mutual good will and re
spect, have resulted In my being able te
lay Derore tne senate a treaty wnicn u
ratified will enable us to begin preparations
for an isthmian canal at any time and
which guarantees to this nation every right
that it has ever asked in connection with
the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton
Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as In
adequate to supply the base for the con
struction miu uiailliciliilicc ui iir.Bi nj
American ship canal, is abrogated. It spe
cially provides that the United States
alone shall do the work of building and
assume the responsibility of safeguarding
the canal and shall regulate its neutrsl use
by all nations on terms of equality
without the guarantee or interference
of any outside nation from any quar
ter. The signed treaty will at once
be laid before the senate, and If ap
proved the congress can then proceed to
give effect to the advantages It secures
us by providing for the building of the
canal."
The Monroe Doctrine.
The president sets forth the objects of
the Monroe doctrine, and the spirit in
which it has been received by other
countries, and in connection with It says
this nation has not the slightest desire to
acquire any territory at the expense of
anv of our neighbors, and cites our atti
tude toward Cuba as a guarantee of our
good faith. He says also that "this
doctrine has nothing to do with the com
mercial relations of any American power
save that It in truth allows each of them
to form such as It desires." That "we
do not ask for any exclusive commercial
treaty with any other American atate."
He says of this:
"The Monroe doctrine should be the
cardinal feature of the foreign policy ot
all the nations of the two Americas aa
It is of the United States. Just "8 years
have passed since President Monroe in
his annual message announced that 'the
American continents are henceforth not
to be considered as subjects for future
colonization by any European power.' In
other words, the Monroe doctrine is a
declaration that there must be no terri
torial aggrandizement by any non-American
power at the expense of any Ameri
can power on American soil. It is in no
wise Intended as hostile to any nation In
the old world. Still less Is it Intended to
give cover to any aggression by one new
world power at the expense of any other.
It is simply a step, and a long step, to
ward assuring the universal peace of the
world by securing the possibility of per
manent peace on this hemisphere."
The Navy.
The president urges the continued Up
building of the navy as a means of per
forming our International duties ss well ss
a protection and safeguard for our inter
national rights. He urges that our place
as a first-class power necessitates the
building and maintenance of a navy in
keeping with our place among the nations
of the world, and says:
"So far from being in any way a provo
cation to war, an adequate and highly
trained navy Is the best guarantee against
war, the cheapest and most effective peace
insurance. The cost of building and main
taining such a navy represents the very
lightest premium for insuring peace which
this nation can possibly pay.
He recommends both the construction
of more ships and the addition of more
officers and men aa absolutely necessary,
and says:
"There should be no cessation In the
work of completing our navy. So far In
genuity has been wholly unable to devise
a substitute for the great war craft whose
hammering guns beat out the mastery of
the high seas. It is unsafe and unwise
not to provide this year for several addi
tional battleships and heavy armored
cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft
in proportion. For the exact number and
character I refer you to the report of the
secretary of the navy. But there Is some
thing we need even more than additional
ships, and this is additional officers and
men. To provide battleships and cruis
ers and then lay them up, with the ex
pectation of leaving them unmanned un
til they are needed in actual war. would
be worse than folly. It would be a crime
against the nation.
"To send any warship against a compe
tent enemy unless those aboard It have
been trained by years of actual sea serv
ice. Including Incessant gunnery prac
tice, would be to invite not merely dis
aster, but the bitterest shame and humil
iation. Four thousand additional sea
men and a thousand additional marines
shoiili be provided, and an Increase la
the officers should be provided by making
a large addition to the classes at Annap
olis. There Is one small matter which
should be mentioned in connection with
Annapolis. The pretentious and unmean
ing title of 'naval cadet' should be abol
ished: the title of 'midshipman.' full of
historic association, should be restored.
"Every detail ashore which can be per
formed by a civilian should be so per
formed, the officer being kept for his spe
cial duty in the sea service. Above all,
gunnery practice should be unceasing. It
Is important to have our navy of ade
quate size, but it is even more Impor
tant that, chip for ship. It should equal
in efficiency any navy in the world.
This Is possible only with highly drilled
crews and officers, and this in turn Im
peratively demands continuous and pro
gressive Instruction in target practice,
ship handling, squadron tactics and gen
eral discipline. Our thips must be assem
bled in squadrons actively cruising away
from hsrbors and never long at anchor.
The resulting wear upon engines and
hulls must be endured. A battleship worn
out in long training of officers snd men Is
well paid for by the results, while, on the
other hand, no matter In how excellent
condition, it Is useless if the crew be rot
expert.
"We now have 17 battleships appropri
ated for. of which nine are completed
and have been commissioned for actual
service. The remaining eight will be
readv In from two to four years, but It
will take at least that time to recruit and
train the men to fight them. It is of vast
concern that we have trained crews ready
for the vessels by the time they are com
missioned. Good ships and good guns are
simply good weapons, and the best
weapons are useless save in the hands of
men who know how to fight with them.
The men must be trained and drilled un
der a thorough and well-planned system
of progressive instruction, while the re
cruiting must be carried on with still
greater vigor. Every effort must be made
to exact the main function of the officer
the command of men. The leading grad
uates of the naval academy should be as
signed to tne comuataat branches, the
The Arm.
- Ne Increase la the regular army It
deemed necessary at thia time, but there
are several change in that branch of the
government service which the president
recommends to concress. Cmef of these
is the establishment of a staff department,
and of this he says:
"A general staff should bo created. As
for the general staff and supply depart
ments, they abould be filled by details
from the line, the men so detailed return
ins after awhile to their line duties. It is
very undesirable te have the senior grades
of the army composed of men who have
eome to fill the positions by the mere fact
Of seniority, A system should be adopted
by which there shall be am elimination
grade by grade of those who seem until
to render the best service ia the next .
grade. Justice to the veterans of the
civil war who are still la the army would
seem to require that in the matter of re
tirements they be given by law the same
privileges accorded to their comrades Is
the navy' , , . . . .
Another recommendation which the pres
ident makes in connection with the army
is for the reduction of the "paper work''
of the service, known to the public as "red
tape." Of this he says:
"Every effort should be made te bring
the army to a constantly increasing state
of efficiency. When on actual service, no
work save that directly in the line of such
service should be required. The psper
work in the army, as in the navy, should
be greatly reduced. What Is needed Is
proved power ot command and capacity
to work well In the field. Constant care
Is necessary to prevent dry rot in the
transportation and commissary depart
ments." .
He also urges the enactment of legis
lation In connection with the militia and
national guard forces of the nation that
they may be better fitted for active serv
ice in time or war, and saya:
"Our militia law Is obsolete and worth
less. The organisation and armament of
the national guard of the several states,
which are treated as militia In the ap
propriations by the congress, should be
made identical with those provided for
the regular forces. The obligations and
duties of the guard in time of war should
be csrefuMy defined and a system estab
lished by law under which tne method of
procedure of raising volunteer forces
should be prescribed in advance. It la ut
terly impossible In the excitement and
haste ot Impending war to do this satis
factorily if the arrangements have not
been made long beforehand. Provision
should be made for utilising In the first
volunteer organizations called out tne
training of those citizens who have al
ready had experience under arms, and
especially for the selection in advance of
the officers of any force which may be
raised; for careful selection of the kind
necessary Is Impossible after the outbreak
of war."
He praises the veterans of the civil war.
the war with Spain and those who have
rendered the nation valiant service in the
Indian uprisings of the west and In the
Philippines, and counsels continued lib
erality in the nation's dealing with them.
The Civil Service.
He recommends the enactment of legis
lation that will place under the rulings
of the merit system many classes of em
ployes not now governed by It. His rec
ommendation for this is as follows:
"I recommend the passage of a law
which will extend the classified service to
the District of Columbia or will at least
enable the president thus to extend It.
In my judgment all laws providing for
the temporary employment of clerks
should hereafter contain a provision that
tney be selected under the civil sei
service
law."
He also wishes the merit avatem to ob
tain In the government service In the
colonies, and says:
"Not an office should be filled In the
Philippines or Porto Rico with any regard
to the man's partisan affiliations or serv
ices, with any regard to the political, so
cial or personal influence which he may
have at his command. In short, heed
should be paid to absolutely nothing save
the man's own character and capacity
and the needs of the service.
"The administration of these Islanda
should be as wholly free from the sua-
fitcion of partisan politics as the admln
stration of the army and navy. All that
we ask from the public servant In the
Philippines or Porto Rico Is that he re
flect honor on his country by the way In
which he makes that country's rule a
benefit to the peoples who have come un
der it. This is all that we should ask.
and we cannot afford to be content with
less."
Other Recommendations.
Among other recommendations which the
president makes are those asking for leg
islation that will Improve the consular serv
ice along lines outlined in bills introduced
at previous sessions, and he says that:
"It is true that the service is now In the
main efficient, but a standard of excellence
cannot be permanently maintained until
the principles set forth in the bills here
tofore submitted to the congress on this
subject are enacted Into law.'r
He believes the time has arrived when
the Indian should cease to be treated as a
member of a tribe, but as an Individual,
and recommends breaking up the tribal
funds, putting a stop to the Indiscriminate
permission to Indians to lease their allot
ments snd stopping the ration system. He
recommends also the establishment of an
Industrial educational system, and an en-,
deavor to encourage the Indians to become
cattle raisers rather than agriculturists
where their lands sre unsulted to IE latter.
He recommends liberal appropriations for
vuv imuihiu t-urcnase exposition ana an
appropriation covering expenses Incurred
by the Charleston exposition in removlng
govsrnment exhibits from the Buffalo ex
position te that at Charleston.
Another of his recommendations is for
a permanent census bureau, as It would in
sure better, cheaper and more satisfactory
work In the interest of business, statistics,
economic and social science.
The Postal Service.
"HVcalla attention to the growth of the
postal system and to the fact that the an
nual deficit In thia department of the gov
ernment service has beea reduced to the
small sum of W.S2J.7T7. This, he says, could
further be increased and possibly a surplus
shown but for the fact that many publi
cations are now securing the pound rata
as second-class mail matter which are not
entitled to the same under the law. Of
this he says:
"The full measure of postal progress
which might be realised has long been
hampered and obstructed by the heavy
burden imposed on the government
through the intrenched and well-understood
abuses which have grown In con
nection with second-class mall matter.
The extent of this burden appears when It
Is stated that, while the second-class mat
ter makes asarly three-fifths of the weight
of all the mail. It paid for the last fiscal
year only S4,2M.44S of the aggregate postal
revenue of 1111,611,11 If the pound rate
of postage, which produces the large leas
thus entailed and which was fixed by the
congress with the purpose of encouraging
the dissemination of public Information,
were limited to the legitimate newspapers
and periodicals actually contemplated by
the law, no Just exctptlon could be taken.
That expense would bs the recognised ami
accepted cost of a liberal public policy de
liberately adopted for a justifiable end.
But much of the matter which enjoys the
firlvlleged rate Is wholly outside of ths
ntent of the law and has secured admis
sion only through an evasion of Its re
quirements or through lax construction.
The proportion of such wrongly Included
matter Is estimated by postal experts to
be one-half of the whole volume ot second
clsss mail. If It be only one-third or one
quarter, the magnitude of the burden la
apparent. The post office department has
now undertaken to remove tne abuses so
far as possible by a stricter application
of the law, and it abould be austslned in
ita effort."
The Chinese DlStenltles.
He calls attention to the satisfactory
settlement of the Chinese difficulties of
last year, and this nation's part In the
settlement, and says provisions have
been made for insuring the future safety
of the foreign representatives. Of the
promises made by China he says:
"The Chinese government hss agreed to
participate financially In the work of bet
tering the water approaches to Shanghai
and to Tientsin, the centers of foreign
trade in central and northern China, and
an international conservancy board. In
which the Chinese government Is largely
represented, has been provided for the
Improvement of the Shanghai river and
the control of Its navigation. In the same
line of commercial advantages a revision
of the present tariff on imports has been
assented to for the purpose of substitut
ing specific for ad valorem duties, and an
expert has been sent abroad on the part
of the United State to assist In thia
work. A list ot articles to remain free of
duty. Including flour, cereals and rice,
gold and silver coin and bullion, has also
been agreed upon In the settlement."
