T11K rilKSIDKNT'S MKSrtAOK.
The message of President Wilson,
delivered in person, to congress last
Tuesday deal wholly with domestic
questions. It la quite probable that
the Important foreign questions will
be taken up In special messages Liter
on.
The question that gvts by far the
greater part of his attention Is that
of the railroad situation as regards
the matter of strikes and wage In
crease. It wbh expected that a recouia
mendation of an IncrcaHe In railroad
rates would be included but it was
not.
Tho president teem to have profit
ed by the experience of the campaign
for, while he defend his action In
forcing the Adamson law, he empha
sizes tho compulsory arbitration sug
gestion and defends It against the at
tacks of the labor organizations.
Particular Htress is placed upon the
necessity for the control of railroads
by the executive In times of war. He
jildo advices the enlargement ot the
Interstate commerce commission by
the addition of more members.
It la plain to bo seen from the Im
portance given the sugjeet ot railway
labor matters that the president pro
poses to push to a finish his program
of railway legislation which includes
an eight hour day, compulsory oper
ations of railways while investiga
tions are being made and compulsory
Investigation ajid arbitration.
The president In his railroad legis
lative program has the enthusiastic
support of the labor organizations on
pome suggestion and their violent
opposition on others. The latter phase
U principally true in regard to the
compulsory operation of the ronds
pending an investigation.
Gorapers and other labor leaders
b e in it an opening vvedgo for the re
moval of labor's most effective wea
pon, the strike, nnd they propose to
prevent if possible any encroachment
upon their power.
It looks as if thi proposal of the
president's railroad legislation pro
gram will be the bone of contention
and the president at the outlet draws
the distinction between the prevent
ing; of n workman quitting' any Job nt
any time he miy wish r.tid that of ii
body of men quitting the railway em
ploy and crippling the tr.tM.e service
ef the nation In response t't the de
lta nd of an organization. The former
right he defends but the latter he
repudiates.
STICK HY YOt'It (it'NS.
The boycott that 1 on against high
priced foods I having its effect and
if our housewives will quietly stick
by their guns the cost of living will
soon be down to somewhere near a
fair basis, llutter was arbitrarily
raised a week ago by the Klgln board
- cents per pound. The Klgln board
is the ruling trust of the butter busi
ness and Km action of last week whs
the last straw. The loycott was on.
The board met again and reduced the
price 2-ceuts. L'ggs have been tumb
ling right along and if the quasi
agreement to "buy no eggs until Jan.
1" la maintained there will be a
smash in the egg comer that will
make men think again before they
burn their fingers by trying to rob
people on their necessities of life.
Flour Is down AO-cents per barrel
with a tendency to go lower.
The American housewife can tlo
more towards regulating the high
com of living than any legislative
action if she will only act. Tho quiet,
refusal to be "held up" will do the
trick. The use of oleomargarine,
colored to suit by the housewife her
self, will answer Just as well as but
ter. Kg'gs can bo got along without.
Lower priced meat -home killed
can be used and no on down the line.
Let the housewives of Crystal Falls
go about this refusal to bo held up,
work systematically and stay by their
determination and they will surely
win out.

ARK SOCIALISTS GOING HACK?
Official canvasses in the few states
whore they have been completed tend
to Indicate that there has been a
marked falling off in the vote cast
tills year by tho Socialists.
In Illinois, where the total vote in
creased about 10 per cent over that
of 1012 principally by women's bal
lots, the vote for IkMison is actually
lower than that for Debs four years
.ig). being' barely three-quarters of
the former figures. Wilson more than
doubled his 1912 Illinois vote tills
time; Hughes had nearly twice as
many votes as Taft and Roosevelt to
gether, and the Prohibition party
mIiowh a fairly large gain, although
not quite up to the gain In the entire
vote. The Socialists alone seem to
have gone backward.
In Connecticut the canvass has also
hecu completed and the total ballot
shows an increase of about 12 per
cent. The vote for Hughes and Wil
son is larger than in 1912, but the
Socialist vote fell off practically one
half. It Is barely T.,000 as compared
with more than 10,000 four years ago.
If the Iosh Hhould run through all
the states, Socialist hopes of reaching
a two million figure will be sorely
disappointed. The party had been
polling about half a million In 1004
and 190S and ran almost to 900.000 iu
1012. but from the present returns
it will drop back now to where It
stood eight years ago. It had a new
candidate this time in place of the
veteran Debs, who made the race with
considerable success several times,
and possibly Mr. Ilenson's campaign
ing powers must be charged with the
result. Or other causes may be Indi
cated when the situation comes to be
analyzed, tho war of changing senti
ments among our people or nomo In
fluence still to be discerned. Hut
whatever the reason it appears to be
a fad that the Socialist party did not
make a promising showing In 1916.--Detroit

COUNT Till: JACKSON BALLOTS
All lover, of fulr play and majority
rule will approve the following ex
cellent ditHnl suggestion taUen
frof.i the I)itr ft Freo Pies.
"The b:ud of state canvassers
should graut the petition of. Con
gressman licnkea and recount the
ballots cast in the disputed pre
cinct of JackKon, where the caikli
dato declares enough were ig
nored to scat him. If there Is any
doubt as f other precincts In the
districts t he ballots there should
alio b examined and properly
credited.
It la of minor consequense that
the result of this tctlon might be
the election of one or the other
contestant. Kven if the control
of the next house of representa
tives were to turn on the certifi
cate to be issued for the Second
Michigan district and If the effect
of the state board's decision were
to transfer the majority from the
Republican to the Democratic
tide. 'it is of vastly greater Im
portance that the will of the vot
ers should be duly recorded than
that one or the other party In na
tional politics should gain a
transclent victory.
Technicalities should not bo
permitted to determine the course
in this matter. Michigan has no
desire to stand before the nation
as a party to dubious methods in
politics.
Count the ballots and seat the
man who was elec ted, whoever he
may prove to be.

McDauiel.s. the prosec uting attorney
of Huchanan county, Missouri, whose
trial on the charge of killing his wife
attracted much attention for the past
month, was acquitted by the . Jury
which heard the evidence last Tuea
day. There was a general opinion
that McDanlcl was not guilty of the
charge, and this opinion aeema to be
substantiated by tho Jury finding.
Texarkanna, a town on the border
between Texas and Arkarrsae, has the
distinction of claiming two U. S. Sen
ators amoug Its citizens, one from
Texas and tho other from Arkansas.
The two men live but three blocks
apart and arc cousin.
It seems that the United States Isn't
the only country in which a close
presidential election was held this
fall. Cuba held an election at about
the name timo that we did and the
result Is Htill in doubt.
David II. Crowly, of Cheboygan,
was appointed by Governor Ferris to
succeed Law ton T. Ilemans on the

Press reports say that President
Wllsou was heckled by one of the

The very wisest thing the women who
