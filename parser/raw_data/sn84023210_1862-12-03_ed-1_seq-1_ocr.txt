I' the ondition of our relations with other
: i-jiMi.s is less gatifying than it has usually horn
termer periods, it is certainly more satisfac
tory than a nation wo unhappily disLraeted as w-e
ir.igut reasonably have apprehended.
Li toe tuonth of June lust there were some
ground.-: to cxpeel th tt the inai'atmie l)Weis,
which at the beginning of our domestic diiiieul
w. unwisely and mines. ssarily, uts we think,

ju-iic.
I tie civil war which has so radically changed
lei-the moment the occupation and n..bits of
the American people, has necessarily disturbed
tne social condition, and affected very deeply
the prosper! y. of tin; nations with which we
have cariied on a commerce that, has been stea
uiiy increasing throughout a period of hall' a
century. It has at the Siuie tune excited polit
ical ambitions and apprehensions which have
produced a profound agitation throughout the
civilized world.
In this unusual agitation wo have forborne
taking part in any controversy between foreign
Mates, and bet w .i n parties 01 factions in such
State. fcWc have attempted no prop.igandism
and acknowledged no revolution, but have left
to every nation the exclusive ce-nduct and man
agement ol its ow n aliaiis. Oar struggle hits
been, oi course, contemplated by loreign nations
with reference less to its own merits than 10 its
supposed aud often exaggerated t fleets, and the
consequences resulting to thoe nations them
selves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of
this government, even if it were just, would cer
tainly be unwise.
Tlie treaty with Great Dritain for the sup
pression of t:.e African slave trade, .has been put
into operation witn a guou prospect of complete
S.lfLVSS.
it is an occasion of special pleasure to ac
knowledge that the execution of it on the part

li.e iiiiiriei.se mineral resources oi those Ter-ritori-.s

l.ave a tendency to improre the revenue of the
'J jve rn me nt and diminish the LurJens of the
people.
it is worthy of your serious consideration
whether some extraordinary measures to pro
mote that end cannot bo adopted. The means
which suggests itself as u;est likely to be el
fective is a scientific exploration of tne miecral
iv'gtous in tiiese territories with a view to the
publication ol its results at booue and in foreign
countries results which cannot fail to be aus
picious. THE NATIONAL 1'IX.VNfi.S.
The condition of the fiumces will ei.im your
most oiii'Ctit cotisideratiuii. The vast expen
ditures incident tt) the military aud naval eie-
eiations required for the i ujipie.-sion of the re
bellion hive hitherto been met with prompitude
aud certainty unusual in simi ai circumstances,
and the public credit has been fully maintained.
The conti!iuan-e of the war, however, aud the
iiicreas.'il disbursements made necessary by the
augmented forces now in the lield demand your
liest reflection as to the best modes of providing
the neeeBsary revenue without injury to busi
ness, and with the least possible burdens upon
labor. The suspension ot specie payments by
the banks soon after the commencement of your
fast session made large issues of United States
Notes unavoidable. In no other way could the
payment of the troops and tho satisfaction of
other just demands be so economically or as well
provided for. The judicious legislation of Con
gress ucuriDg the recci' ability of these nUes
lor loans ana internal duties, and making them
a legal tender lor other debts, has made them
univeisal currency, and satisfied partially, nt
least, and for the time, the long lelt want of an
unilorm circulating medium, saving thereby to
the people immense sums in discouuts and ex
changee. A return to specie payments however, at the
earliest period compatible with duo regard to
all interests, should ever be kept in view.
Fluctuations in the value of curreucy are al
wajs injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations
to the lowest possible p nit will always bo a
leading purpose in wmu legislation. Prompt
and certain convertibility into coin is generally
ccknowlcdged 10 he thebestand surest svsteni,
and ii is xtrcmely doubtful whether a circula
tion in United States notes payable in coin, and
siiflicienti v large for the wants ot the people,
can h permanently useful and sah-ly maintain
ed. Is t.iere, then, auy other uiodti in wbtcii
th necessary provision for the public warns
can be made, and the reat advantages of a tafe
and uuilbrui currency secured ? 1 know none
which promises so certain results, and at the
same lime so unobjectionable, as the organiza
tion ot banking assocmun under a general act
of Congress, well guaidcd in its provisions.

IiEl'ARWiENT REPORTS.
TI'C re-.;rfi of the Seeretanesof the Navy and
V. ar are herewith transmittal!. These reports,
though lengthy, are scarcely morn than "brief
abstiuets or ihe Vt.ry riiimerous and extensive
j ti-iin.siceions and operations conducted through
j these Departments, nor could I -live :i suunuarv
j of them here upon nr.y principle which would

r-.'ports beloie you and assing your attention to
them.
I'O.-T.H, i 1'AII!-'.
It gives rac pleasure to report a decided im
provement in the financial condition of the Post
Office Department us coiupure-.l with several
preceding years. The receipts oi' the fiscal year
IsGl, amounted to .S.340.21to,4(), which "em
brace i the leveuue from nil the States in th"
Union for three-quartets of (hat y-.ar.
Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue
from the so-called seceded States during tho last
fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of
the loyal States has btieti sufficient to produce a
revenue during the same year of ,2.1,SlO,
being only 00,000 less than was derived from
all the Slates of the Union during tho previous
year.
The expenditures shew a still more favorable
icsult. Ihe amount expended in 1 was
I3,G0G,7o'J,ll ; lor the last year the atuouut
lias been reduced to $11, 12o 304,13 ; showing
a decreuse ol about $2, 48 1,000 in the expendi
tures as compared with the preceding year, and
of about 3,7 50,000 as compaied wa.i the fiscal
year of li-G0.
The deficiency in the department for the pre
viou year was si4,5jl,(J'.IG,fiS. for the last fiscal
year it was reduced to $2,112,814, 57. These
lavorable results are in part owing to the cessa
tion of mail service in the insurrectionary States
and in part to a casual revi-w of all the expen
ditures iu thai department in the interest of
economy. The eliiciency of tlie postal service,
it is believed, has also been much improved.
Tho Postmaster General ulso opened a eorres
pon tuee through the department of State, with
loreign Governments proposing a convention of
postal representatives far the purpose of simpli
fying the rales of foreign postage and to expe
dite the foreign mails.
This proposition, equally important to our
adopted citizens and to the ccinmorcial interest
of this country, has been favorably entertained
and agreed to by all the governments from whom
replies have been received.

gestion oi the Postmaster General in his report
respecting the further legislation required, in
his opinion, lor the benefit of the postal service,

The Secretary oi tho Interior reports as fol
low? in regard to the public lands : I he public
lands have ceased to bo a source ot revenue.
Prom the 1st of July, 18G1, to the 30th of Sep
tember, lG2, tho entire cash receipts from the
sale of lands were !137,47G,2G, a sum much
less than tuc cxptnse of our land pystoui during
tho same period. Tho Homestead law, w iden
witl take effect on tho 1st of January next, offers
suoli inducements to settlers thai sales for cash
cannot be expected to an extent sufficient to
i in:., market.

To carry out the provisions of the act of
Congress ot the loth ot May hist, i have caused
the department of Agriculture ot the United
States to be organizjd.
The commissioner informs me that within the
period of a few months this department has es
tablished nu extensive system ot correspondence
and exchanges, both at home and abroad, which
promises to effect highly beneficial results in
the development of a correct knowledge of re
cent improvements in agricuiture, in the intro
duction ot new products, and in the collection
of the agricultural statisties of the different
States, and will soon be prepared to distribute
large quantities of seeds, cereals, plants and
cuttings, and ins already published and liberal
ly diffused much valuable information in antici
pation of a more elaborate report, which will
in due time oe furnished, embracing some valus
able tests in chemical science now in progres

The creation of this department was for the
more immediate benefit of a lrge class of our
most valuable citizens, and I trust thai tho lib
eral basis upiv. which it has been orbanized
will uot only meet your approbation, but that
it will realize, at no distant day, all the fondest
anticipitions of its most sanguine friends, and
become the fruitful source of abvantago to all

A glance a: the map siiows that, territorially
speaking, it is the great body of the lie-public.
Tne other parts are but the marginal bor.ers
to it.
The magnificent region slojng west from the
Rocky Mountains to the Paeilie being the deep
est, and also the richest in developed resources
iu the production of provisions, grains, grasses,,
and all wnich proceed Irom them.
This great Interior region is naturally one of
the most important in the world. Ascertain
from the statistics the small proportion of the
region which has as yet been brought inti cul
tivation, and also the largo aud rapidly increas
ing amount of its producU and we shall be over
whelmed with the magnitude of the prospect
presented, and yet this region has no sea coast,.
tnd touches no ocean anywhere.
As part of one nation its people now find,
and uiny forever find, their way to Europe by
New York, to South America and Africa by
New Orleans, and to Asia by Sau Francisco.
Hut separate our common country into two na
tions, as designed by the present rebellion, and
every man of this great interior region is there
by cut off from some one or more of these out
lets, not perhaps by physical barrier, but by
embarrassing and "onerous trade regulations ;
and this is true wherever a dividing or bounda
ry line may be fixed. Place it between the now
lree and slave country, or place i: south of Ken
tucky, or north of Ouio, aud still the truth re
mains that nono south of n can trade to' any
part or place north of it, and none north of it
can trade to any art or place south of it, ex
cept up.m terms dictated oy a government for
eign to them. These outlets, cast, west, and
south, aro indispensable tj the well being ol
the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast
interior reeion. which of the three may bo best
is no proper questiuu, all are batter than either
and all ot rigiit belong to tint people and to
their successors forever. True to themselves,
they will not ask where a liaa of separatioa
