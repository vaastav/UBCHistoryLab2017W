Cherokee County Republican: The
Senate may not meet President McfCin
Icy'a wishes by the adoption of (lnunclal
legislation, but the country will know
where to place the blame.
Kansas City Times (Dem.): Charac
terized mildly, President McKinley's
latest state paper Is a tissue of unsound
and vacillating policies tediously pre
sented and feebly defended.
St. Louis Globe-Democrat (Rep.): All
, the currency reform which has any pros
pect of enactment at present is the mod
est measure which the President recom
mends. This should be pushed with all
practicable speed.
Iola Register (Rep.): The message is
evidence to the nation and to the world
that there is a MAN in the White House,
strong, serene, well poised, measuring
up easily and naturally to the full. stat
ure of the world's great rulers.
Wichita Beacon (Dem.): The people
will be greatly disappointed in the first
regular message of the Canton major.
There are but two matters in which the
masses feel a vital interest and in both
oJ them the President stammers.
Kansas City Journal (Rep.): The Pres
ident's message is said to have had a
favorable effect on American securities
'. abroad. As It also has a favorable effect
. on business at homo it may be regarded
as a sort of International soothing syrup.
Emporia Republican: The message
shows careful preparation and is re
markable for its conservative tone and
treatment of the various questions re
i ferred to. It will, In the main, meet the
approval of Republicans and the public
j in general.
I Pittsburg (Kas.) Dally Tribune
$ (Pop.): In fact that the reference to
Cuba is almost an exact copy of Cleve
land's message on the same topic. Both
I "are one" on the Cuban and gold ques
) tions. Republicans who have shouted
for silver and for Cuba have no longer
a reason for voting with the gold bug
party.
; New York Sun: If we were required
I to put into four Hues the administra-
tion'3 advice, as gathered from President
, McKinley's first annual message to Con-
gross, on the most important questions
A. ' of foreign and domestic policy now occu-
I pying the mind of the public, we should
: state it in this fashion: Walt and see
, i , what Spain is going to do about Cuba;
J wait and see how the Dingley tariff is
,? going to turn out by and by. Mr.Mc-
I I Kinley Is a prudent statesman, and he
j crosses no bridges that he can avoid
' jj; crossing by continuing to walk along
the hither bank.
Fort Scott Monitor (Rep.): The state
ment of the present status of the Cuban
question is no doubt correct, but the
conclusions arrived at will be a disap
pointment to many. The basis for pres
ent non-interference seems to be the
promises of reform made by Spain. Past
experience would suggest that these
promises are of about as much value as
the pledges made In a Populist platform.
The President promises vigorous action
iu case Spain refuses to keep her pledges
and the outcome will be watched with
interest. The Cuban policy will no
doubt be the point of attack on the mes
sage by the opposition.
Kansas City Journal (Rep.): The mes
sage is not too long for popular read
ing. Considering the unusual number
of important subjects discussed, it is re
markably brief as compared with the
average Presidential message. Mr,
Cleveland's annuals usually contained
about 20,000 words; this contains 12.000
It could not have been shorter and have
done Justice to the great questions
treated. As his first annual communl
cation to Congress Mr. McKlnley has
given tw a message that Is entirely cred
I'aible from any standpoint considered,
and that will be generally satisfactory to
the ccoDlfr-more especially to the con
servative buolnees element.
Kansas Citv Times (Dem.): Medi
ocrity apologizing for bad faith and in
competency epitomizes ine quauxy ot
the President's message. Beginning with
a hypocritical address to Providence on
the bounties that nature nas yieiaea 10
those who toll for ner ravors, ix guaes
Into praise of the efficacy of the high
miotflottve tariff bill passed by the Re
publican party, and In the succeeding
uftntences declares that that atrocious
piece of legislative robbery will shed its
benign influence upon tne people u tney
will be only patient and give it time to
got the part of its machinery intended
for nrnductne nubile revenue Into active
operation. The surface Christian and
the cheap politician blend grotesquely
In hlii exordium.
St. Louis Globe-Democrat (Rep.): The
Paris Figaro deplafes that President Mc
Kinley's message means war, and inti
mates that If war comes Spain may get
some allies. Where will she get them?
Au8:rla, which 4s joined to Spain by
some ties of blood, has a crisis at home
which is bothering her so seriously that
she has no time to think of any other
country's troubles. Germany, in the
Chinese affair, has a possible war on Its
hands. England, France and Russia are
Med up by troubles, or expected troubles,
In Asia or Africa. In no quarter of the
globe can Spain find an ally If she
Hhould have war with the United States.
The last country in Europe which would
aid Spain in any case is the country
In which that Paris paper la printed.
Kansas City Star (Independent): Pres
ident McKlnley, in bis. message, dis
plays none of the timid politician's fear
of the world gold. He uses the most
emphatic language In discussing the sub
ject of the currency, and leaves not a
shadow of doubt as to the determination
of the present administration to main
tain the gold standard and to avoid any
action by the Treasury department
which will In the least degree impair
faith In the stability of the currency.
The message is much stronger in this
respect than a good many radical cur
rency reformers expected. In advocat
ing a safer and easier method to obtain
gold for the redemption of the green
backs, and to make the demand notes
of the government less of a menace to
confidence In financial circles, the Pres
ident very shrewdly calls attention to
he fact that the settled policy of the
government, since the close of the war,
has been to pay its debts In gold, and
that the treatment of the greenbacks
that is now advocated Is merely a con
tinuation of that policy.
im American Banker: The
rnurRAi near aPProach of tne next
utNtnAL. session of Congress is ex
pected to have a dampening effect on
the stock market next week. There
is a general feeling that the President's
message will prove to be a pacific and
conservative document. It Is rumored
that Mr. McKlnley will not favor the
whole program of currency reform as
It Is expected to be outlined in the Sec
retary's report. The stock market, af
ter the significant advance during the
summer, has reacted to near the level
which it marked at the beginning of
the rise.
Missouri World: Wharton Barker may
be the man for President, but Pops will
want to know more about him before
they nominate him. We hope inves
tigation and his acts will prove he 13
the Moses to lead.
Ness City Echo: You can rely on It,
that whenever you find a fellow who is
protesting and crying out against re
forms of whatever kind and nature, he
has either got some soft snap under
existing conditions or expects to get
hold of it under these conditions.
Topeka Mail and Breeze: There will
be general satisfaction at the heavy
verdict against an Eastern railway com
puny for having placed a man on the
"blacklist," thus rendering it impossi
ble to earn the honest living he was
anxious to do. The blacklist is a form
of tyranny for which no excuse has
ever been advanced, largely for the rea
son that there is no excuse for it.
Lincoln Independent: The Chicago
platform declares against the usurpa
tion of power by the injunction. Re
publican loaders have very generally
denounced Mr. Bryan on account of that
part of the platform. In doing this the
Republican leaders are condemning Mr.
Bryan and tne Chicago platform for d
nounclng a principle which they them
selves dare not declare in favor of. Re
publican leaders and the Republican
party Jare not go before the people
upon a platform declaring in ravor 01
the present use of the Judicial injunc
tion. If they dare not declare in favor
of It why should they be so exercised
over the fact that Mr. Bryan has dared
to declare against it?
Hutchinson Interior-Herald: In the
comic paper, and in the so-called humor
ous column of other papers, the farmer
Is burlesqued and made to appear ri
diculous. He Is called a "hayseed," and
soft. He is made the personification
of all that is verdant, Ignorant and un
sophisticated. His lack of knowledge
of the little trivialities that constitute
the education of a society man are em
phasized, and his truthful disposition
sneered at. His plain, honest ways are
ridiculed, his praiseworthy economies
are twlated Into unworthy parsimony,
and in every way he is made to appear
us a very unworthy person. If the pub
lication of such rot serves any good pur
pose we cannot see it. It stamps the
writer as both vulgar and impertinent.
Harper's Weekly: Senator Wolcott
has made the official report of his In
effectual wanderings through Europe in
search of a bimetallic agreement Ap
parently the report contains nothing
new beyond making it clear that the
necessary stiffening of the British Cab
inet's backbone came from the govern
ment of India. The Indian govern
ment was making ready to declare that
it wa3 not the time to encourage bi
metalllsts, for India would lose money
by returning to the silver standard,
and was prepared to consider plana for
frankly establishing the gold standard.
On the whole, the Information obtained
by the Wolcott mission, and that which
comes from other sources, not only de
stroy the value of bimetallism as a
game for shifty politicians, but strength
en the case for gold in adding new tes
timony as to the folly of supposing that
silver is ever again to attain to full
legal tender value in any great commer
cial nation, and, further, as to the move
ment against silver both in India and
in China.
New York Sun: In the present con
flict the Sun takes the only logical and
sound position. It is, that all the pa
per money of the country shall be is
sued by the government directly and re
deemed by it directly, without employ
ing the banks to do it and paying them
for it by paying Interest on bonds pur
chased with the money which it guaran
tees. Still less should the banks be
allowed to Issue circulation without
security and without limit. The gov
ernment money should always be re
deemable in gold,and instead of being,
as the Times falsely asserts It would
be, unlimited in amount, it would be
limited by redemption to no greater
volume than the wants of legitimate
business require. How much this vol
ume could consistently with Its redemp
tion be Increased over that of our pres
ent government money, experience
would determine. Probably $236,000,000
of it would be needed to take the place
of the $235,000,000 of outstanding bank
currency, and possibly more; but, what
ever its amount, it should always be
redeembale in gold, and, therefore,
it would be as good as gold.
ARfMJT Pittsburg (Kas.) Tri-
VaMCAC bune (PP'): In 0116
RAWiAi' breath the Topeka Capital
says the credit of Kansas Is better to-day
than ever before, in the next item it
solemnly declares that the treasury Is
depleted and "all Is lost on account of
the Pop administration." The Capital
Is a great joker, but we wish it would
give U3 the wink once In a while so we
can tell when It is lying. .
Pittsburg (Kas.) Tribune (Pop.): The
American Book Trust Company has had
its own way in Kentucky for years, but
now comes the news that the Legislature
will pass a text-book bill similar to the
Kansas law. The effect of the law is
to adopt socialistic ideas, but the people
don't care what you call it, Just so It
gets there.
Pratt County Union (Pop.): If our
Republican exchanges would get out and
rustle legitimate news they .would not
be holding a special session of the Kan
pas Legislature so frequently. When
Governor Leedy believes that a special
session would be a benefit to the State
(which will be a long time hence) it
will be time enough for our Republican
friends to announce it.
Independence Tribune (Rep.): Five
rural school districts in Reno county
have decided to consolidate, and Instead
of five ungraded schools establish one
good graded school near the center of
the new district. Provision will be made
The
Duplex
Typewriter
Will respond with perfect
work to a speed of 20 let
ters a second or 1,200 a
minute
The Duplex has double speed and
double durability. It has a double
alphabet; one for the left hand and
one for the right; and two points of
contact for type and paper. The
operator can print any two letters at
the same instant, and do it as quickly
as one letter can be printed on any
other machine. Yet the Duplex is
no larger than other typewriters, is
as easily portable as any other stand
ard machine, and its key-board is
very easily learned. Its points of
superiority are :
1st. The Production of Perfect Work.
2d. Capacity for the Highest Speed.
3d. Excellence of Material and Superior
Workmanship.
4th. Durability.
The Duplex
Is Eminently Practical.
Read ths FollovingTcstinaonial:
I have bad a Duplex In constant use for the
last two years and It has given great satisfac
tion. The alignment Is still perfect, as Is Its
work in every way, and it shows hardly any
traces of wear.
I first heard of the machine through an oper
ator of this city who told me that a young lady
operator at the World's Fair wrote an average
of 14:i words per minute to his dictation for
twenty minutes. He was very enthusiastic In
praise of the machine and on his recommen
dation I bought one. I found It very easy to
learn, and its speed and the elegance of Its
work are the admiration of all who have seen
It. I have seen nearly all the writ ing machines
on the market and have operated the principal
ones, and think tho Duplex by far the best In
every way. Its double key-board makes It
aoout twice as fast as the ordinary machine,
and I hope to soon take take the lead as It so
well deserves. It Is difficult to see how any
one, once having operated the Duplex, could
ever go back to one of the slow and cumbrous
old-style machines. It has points of excel
lence not possessed by other machines, espe
cially its double features and the device for
shading letters. JOBN II. HOOD,
