Whvt A Pitt. —Oar neighborhood is
not at all pleased with the idea of Mr.
Mclndoe becoming the successor to Mr.
Hanciiett. The Inteligencer sees but one
qualitv in Mac that would suit its party,
t „ wit'; it says he is a ‘first rate gambler.
If the charge should prove true, he will
draw largely on the Democratic vote of
the District. The secret of our neighbor's
dislike to Mr. Mclndoe is that he is a
strong supporter of the Government, and
took a prominent part in suppressing
the Ozaukee draft riots, and “bringing
the rioters to Camp.

Dear Tiubcne; —
Through the kindness
of a friend I am supplied with stationery,
and enabled to write to the Tribune once
mure. The Sutler makes an occasional
viaist to the Regiment, but neglects to
bring a supply of letter paper, and by o
late order ped Hers arc prohibited to come
within the lines, consequently writing let
ters is about “played out.”
It is now live months since we were paid
and from present appearances we will see
the end of the sixth before the advent of
the Paymaster, beeesh shinplast. rs have
passed very well among the residents of
Virginia, until they discovered tliot we
were passing the fac simile. The Officers
depend wholly on the Brigade commissary
for provisions, and he, good soul, is delight
ed to book the amount and await the
/
counting of the dispenses of green-backs.
The bill of fare is not so extensive as it
might be yet through the oxer;ions of
head officers, we have had full rations giv
out since our arrival in our present ('.imp,
un i relish a good dish of beans, and boil
ed pork and “Hard took,” as you would a
slice of Sponge cake.
During the past week the boys have
been busy prepaiing for the cold blasts of
winter. Small, but comfortable log houses
are in progress of erection, and various
are means resorted to for comfort’s
sake. The Shelter Tents are little better
than nothing during a rain storm, let
alone the misery one undergoes, in sleep
ing in them during these cold nights. Your
correspondent is an occupant of u neat
little eight by ten log hut. and enjoys him
self amazingly. We have a fire-place*
built of sod, mud and sticks of wood.
Though the outer appearance of our
residence is not very prepossessing, yet
on the inside all is comfort, and so man
aged that one (a soldier) cannot help but
enjoy himself and feel perfectly at home.
In one corner is a table, on which 3-011 find
the tin ware, an 1 what remains of the
diuner just eaten, and then in lieu of
chairs wc have three logged stools, and in
another corner Is our bed rolled up in oil
cloth. We h ; ve a mantle piece on which
3'ou will find 1 cop\' of the “Orpheus C
Kerr Papers, ’ a Novel, - The How” or
Domestic Homanee in real life, The Pi
ble, and divers little trinkets, necessary
in making up a soldiers pack. Wc enjoy
ourselves and an contented, and we oh’ n
gather in circle-; and chat over o and times,
discuss polities, the army, and abilities of
Geneials, Are. w inding up with a declara
tion ct what we will do and accomplish
when we reach home.
\\ o are not over desirous fr a move,
and are not dispose I to rush Burnsy or
tret because a few Seeesh Cavalry make
sudden and unexpected dashes on some of
our sleepy cavalry. Such accidents are
expeete I to happen, and we must console
ourselves with the thought that the fools
are not all dead 3-et, but many more squads
are to be caught by the the ever prowling
Seceshers. The Generals and the ruling
power my plan battles and study the s.d
eace of strategy, and we vil] do light
ing, but we solemnly pro U-t against rush
lug us into the mire without knowing a
rub* by which we are to be extricated.
We look upon Burnside as ca| able, and
we hope he may prove an abler and greater
Gen ral than his predecessor, but in this
we have our misgivings We loved Mc-
Clellan. and as vet we have no reason lor
changing our opinions of the man. and
honestly believe him to be the man and
that time will give him full credit an I hi
just dues. Such we believe him entitled
to.
Kcports are in circulation that Secosh
have evacuated I - redericksburg, and that
the right of our army is in motion. How
true, can t sav.
Ihe President's message came into
camp this morning, and down went axes,
guns and accoutrements and all rallied in
groapes to hear it. It i 3 a document,
admit to 1 to be. marked by unmistakable
ability and by an earnest sine.-re patriot
ism. As a matter of course there are
those dissenting from the view - 1
in tiie message, vet are vailing to nekn. vl
odge, the truthfulness of the closing par
agraph*. and accord to“the I’resideut an
honesty of purpose.
By late orders from Gen'l Burnside, the
issue of passes to and from Washington.
without the permission of Grand Division
Generals *r from him are prohibited. This
has caused quite a flutter among the red
tape I gentlemen, who were counting on a
visit to the capital during our delay.
Several applied, and all received their
applications "returned disapproved.’’ Red
tape subsided and remain their
commands.
Brig. (Jen' 1 Meredith, formerly Colonel
of the 19th Indiana, is now commanding
this Brigade, Gen'l Gibbons having been
transferred to the command of Picket's
old division.
John MoCormic of your city is now
acting Quartermaster of the 2nd Regiment.
Lieut. Haggles being acting Brigade
Quartermaster, h'urgeon Ward of the
the 2nd is Brigade Surgeon, and Dr. Arndt
acting Regimental Surgeon.
The return of paroled prisoners are
daily looked for, and hoped for, as the
papers soy they are all exchanged, and
wo don t feel inclined to dispute such au
thority at this stage of the game.
It has been hinted that the 30th Re<'L
would likely form a part of this Brigade.
We hope so, and will assure them a hearty
welcome, and convince them that they
come among a fighting crew, with a man
at the helm capable of marching on
straight roads, and camping within gun
shot of chickens, pigs, sheep, and all
other things necessary for a soldier.
Come boys, and we will be prepared to
receive you with outstretched arms.
J need not mention the general good
conduct of Cos. “J," for all are of one mind
and desirous of doing us they wish to bu
done by, comfortably situated, with a plen
ty of rations, the desired point in the ar
my. We have occasional issue of Rico
Molasses and desecated potatoes. At this
time we arc growing fat, and as I have
said before vearo as happy as Kings.
in conclusion, allow the “Deacon’’ and
“Scotch” to accept my best wishes, and
that the “Deacon will make his “mark,”
and when Soldiering has about “played
out,” he will resort to the types fur conso
lation
The drums beat for parade, a batch of
orders aro to be read, perhaps of some
pour follow who has been arraigned before
a general Court Martial, and undoubtedly
dismissed the service. Boor boy, he de
serves the pity, but should recollect that
he is dealing with military, not the civil
authorities. The lucky fellow will be
happy.
“JUDGE.”
D S.—An order has just been recieved
to be in readiness to march, and we infer
that our destination is Fredericksburg
-1 wo regimentsof our Division are ordered
to Aquia Caeek, while the 24th Michigan
of this Brigade, guards the Railroad. By
this move we judge that Burnside has just
thought of tiie remaining part of the Mc-
Clellan plans, and is about carrying them
out. W e leave our comfortable quarters

Everything last night was bustle and
activity, as today was the time fixed for
crossing the rivcV During the night, the
pontoons were conveyed to the river, and
the artillery of 143 pieces placed in posi
tion opposite the citv.
At 5 o clock this morning the rebels fir
ed two signal guns, and during the latter
part of the night rockets were seen with
in their lines.
At 5 o clock the construction of three
bridges in front of the city were commen
ced.
U hen the bridges were about half com
pleted, the enemy opened a murderous fire
of in! an try from the houses on the oppo
site bank.
I p to tiiis time not a shot had been fired
on our side, Ihe engineers wre driven
from the bridges and several killed and
wounded.
At six o’clock Gen. Burnside ordered
all the guns to he oponed on the citv. The
cannonading which has continued up to
the present time is terrible. The citv is
-•a fire, an 1 Its destruction appears inevi
table.
1 he enemy about < o clock tin's morning
opened with their heavy guns from their
works, but so far have done no serious in
jury.
] ben. !• ranklin constructed his bridges
about three miles ! clow the citv, meeting
with but slight opposition. His'troops are
tio.v crossing, and tne gunboats aie now
shelling the enemy about 15 miles down
lie river, where they have been concen
trating their 1 wees for lae past few days.
Ihe concentrated fire of our batteries
on the city had the effect of driving back
ibe enemy’s infantry, and the work°on the
bridges has again been commenced. The

prepared to rush over as soon as the brid
es are completed.
Headqmrt r.s. Thursday-—noon.
An attempt being made to fini>h the
bridges in. front of the city, the rebel in
iantrv opened their fire. The artillery in
position again opened on it, the result be
ing tier it was fired in several places.

Burnside lias just issued an order to

On the oth Isaac Winn had an attack of the
Mountain Fever, which lasted three days
(very sick some of the time) —when he recov
ered. On the Bth Joseph Strude was taken
sick with the lever. The mosquitoes have
been very bad during our stay on Green
river No. 1.
Wednesday, July 9—Well we got started
about 9 and drove over te Green river No. 2,
taking the boat along with us. The distance
is 15 miles—road rough and rockv. No. 2is
not so large as No. 1 at present, but has been
much larger this spring—is falling rapidly.
Have splendid grass to-night. Frank San
ford is down with the Fever, also Captain
Stootsman. Jo. Stude is quite sick. There
are several in the other trains down with the
•Fever—some very bad cases. Billy Brown
has a very severe cold.
dhttTsday, July] 10, was spout in ferrying
Green river No. 2. Frank is a little better.
We ferried No. 2 some ways* above the old
ford.
Friday. July 11.—Drove over a very rough
rocky road to tho 3d and last fork of Greenriv
er—3 miles distant. It is smaller than either
of the other forks. We crossed it this after
noon by ferrying it with our wagon boxes. It
was not a very bad stream to cross, although
quiteswift and from 4 to 5 feet deep. Jo. Stud ■
has got abot well. Frank is quite sick again.
Saturday, July 12. I.eft the last fork of
Green river this morning. Road’ mixed—
good and bad, hard and soft. H„d to cross
four young livers, two of whi'li were very
bad. Camped on a fine stream at the foot
of a long Cany an. Drove about 15 miles*
Dick Symons of DodgevilleJ has been quite
feeble for some time, but now is getting bet
ter. Mosquitoes and Buffalo Gnats, awful,
in fact I never saw the infernal insects as bad
as they are to-night. Murrish is sick with
the fever.
Sunday, July 13. —Entered the Banyan this
morning. For a little ways the road was
good. A fair sized mountain stream runs
down the Canvan which’we had to cross sev
eral times—very hard crossing. We had to
leave the old road and take one made by the
train ahead of us along the mountain side,
which was sliding and rough—full of stumps.
Several teams tipped over and broke down
Wisconsin got through all safe. Insects aw
ful, they bit our horses so ranch that we
could hardly manage them. The hills on each
side of the Canvan are from 800 to 1,600 fee t
high, very steep, and covered with heavy
forests of lull straight pines and balsam. The
scenery is very beautiful and romantic. We
passed fort Snyder, comprising one log bouse
and situated in a very beautiful spot. Camp
ed three miles beyond Fort Snyder, near the
head of Canvan. Good water and fair grass.
Drove al-o-it lo miles, Tins has been a very
hard day on our horses—insects and bad road -
Our train has become somewhat split up. Our
Wisconsin wagons—twelve in number, are 4
or 5 miles ahead of the others. The rest arc
scattered along ton and fifteen miles back.
Monday, July 14.—Our drive this morning
commenced by ascending along hill—-climb
ing the mountains. No sooner had we arriv
ed at the top than down we went ; and so it
was Jail day—up and down. We crossed
Ifve different mountains. Snow in some
places, in the road sor 6 feet deep. Had a
storm in the afti moon—a little rain, a heap
of snow and a little hail. We have passed
through very heavy, tall pine and balsam for
ests.
This is decided a very romantic country—
great high hills, tall thi< k forests, and moun
tain streams of pure cold wat> r rushing in tor
ents down the hill sides. We drov .25 miles
and camped in deep narrow Canyan, on a wet,
swampy spot. Grass scarce. Sprague has
the Fever very severe this evening. Frank is
quite sick yet. Toe season here is backward.
Strawberries and Goosberries just in bloom.
Tuesday, July 15—Drove through a deep
bad mud-hole this morning and then had to
leave the old read and climb a hard, long
steep hill—had to double teams. The rest of
the forenoon we had good roads but hilly. Had
to cross two deep streams. In the afternoon
wc emerged into a splendid valley—roadsjfine.
It scented like emerging from winter into
spring. Nature has planted a beautiful flower
garden in this valley. There are some of the
prettiest roses I ever saw—wild or tame. We
found some ripe strawberries, which went
very gu.°d, although small. Drove 20 miles.-
Sprague and Trank better.
Wcdlusday , July 10—Just as wc were
hitching up a messenger from the teams back
came into camp and .said that two wagons
which were about 8 miles back of the rest,
had been attacked and robbed bv the Indians
Twenty-five men from the different trains
went back. The wagons belonged to two
brothers, Campbell, recently from Denver,
but formerly from Wiota, Wisconsin. One
was loaded with provisions the other with
whiskey. There were seven men with tile
wagons, six of whom escaped, but J. M. Camp
bell was killed, lie leaves two children in
W iota—his wife being dead. II- was forty
nine years old. The Campbells had between
$9,000 and SIO,OOO in gold and Treasury
notes, all of which wercs.olen. The history
of this tragedy is about as follows: The
wagons were very heavily loaded, and conse
quently couM not travel as fast as the lighter
ones, which accounts for t! *ir being so far
behind; they had repeatedly refused to Join
either train, and wj ihl camp by themselves,
although generally but a short distance off.
They were climbing a very hard hill and had
got seperated about half a mile. They we re
in heavy timber and thick under fusb. The
ted devils came upon the hinder w igon un
expectedly, and wore unperceived until one
of them slapped one of the Campbells on the
shoulder and asked for bread. While Camp
bell was getting the bread, the Indian stole
his revolver, and also the revolvers belonging
to the others—four in all. They then took
them prisoners, and commenced ransacking
the wagon. They divided the gold but threw
t e Treasury n->t son the ground. They mad
t .-- pris-mers help pack the mules they had
stolen from them with provisions and cloth
ing, after which they fired the wagon. After
keeping the whit - prisoners about two hours
tu \ ; them at liberty and motioned them
to leave. The whites started. .1. M • Camp
bio stopping to pick up the Treasury notes.
Aftei the prisoners had got off about one
j hundred yaads, the Indians commenced firing
i 0 n them, but missed all hut J M. C, Th
party that went back, found his dead body,
where ho fell, with four arrow wounds in the
breast and one bullet hole in the forehead-
Ilis body was undisturbed except that his poc
kets were rifled and every thing taken except
a fine gold watch, which the Indians probably
overlooked, as it was in the fob pocket of his
pantaloons.
His faithful dog was laying by his side,
and could hardly be forced from him.
They hurried him by the road-side. The
three men with the head wagon took
three mules, and hiding in the brush,
and skulking around, finally got into
camp. These three mules were all that
was saved. The Indians were undoubted
ly.headed by a white man. The Campbell
that escaped will probably be remember
ed by many of the old residents ot Min
eral Point, as he formerly lived there and
is acquainted with many of them —his
name is Uncle .John Campbell.
Thursday. July IT —We started at 8,
and after driving three honrs discovered
a band of Indians in the road some dis
tance ahead of us and coining towards us
on a regular Indian lope. We could not
tell bow many of them there was, but
immediately corrclled our teams, and pre
pared to meet them in any way they want
ed. We placed our horses inside the
correll and every man that was able took
his fire arms and stationed himself in
front of the wagons and facing the Indi
ans. W e were about forty in nnmb jr,
and had a couple of old mountaineers
with us, who flattered and praised us a
good deal for our promptitude in facing
danger, and keeping so cool. They said
they had seen a great many Indian fusses,
but had never seen a company of men
that they would so tier trust in an Indian
fight than ours. They declared we could
whip five hundred Indians, and told the
men behind us when they came up, that
if they would keep as cool as the Wiscon"
sin boys, they could whip tho whole snake
nation. The Indians came galloping op,
and wanted to come into our camp, but
when about one hundred yards from us,
we commanded them to halt, and sent
four men out to meet them Only seven
\ teen of the red skins came up although
| there were at least one hundred and fifty
I not far off. Some said they wanted to
trade with the wagons, others said they
i were going to Salt Lake to trade with the
Mormons. They professed to be friendly
and thought we treated them very bad in
refusing to let them come in and trade.
The Chief said he had never been treat
!ed so by the whites before. They were
very uneasy in our presence, and indeed
i they had need to be, for our boys want-
I ed to lire terribly, and had the command
been given I do not think one out of the
seventeen would have ever returned to his
wigwam. Had we been sure they were
j connected with the party that killed Camp
j bell, there would have been war, whether
they wanted it or nut. Tho other teams
came up and we drove about five miles and
camped. The Indian encampment was
about two miles from us, but they' troubl
ed us not with their ugly presence. We
posted a strong guard to night, and went
to bed and slept sound and quiet. We
have tip top grass to-night. Sprague is
all right again. Mu. rish has got well.
Friday. July 18—Travelled down the
old valley a little ways and then struck
into a long narrow Canyan. in most of
which the road was good. The red skins
followed us a little ways, and wanted to
trade, but we stopped them. They accuse
the Cheyonnis and Kyutes of murdering
Campbell, but we do not credit it. We
passed several Salt springs to-day. We
camped in a very good place where the
< ’anyan widened out after climbing a small
hill—Grass plentiful. Drove eighteen
miles. Several little showers have graced
us with their refreshing presence.
Saturday. July 19. Road tfiis after
noon run through the Canyan and was
<Xood. One of the hind train wagons broke
an axltree and came into camp riding on
a rail, or rather a po’e, as rails are scarce
in these parts. Avery heavy hail storm
passed just South of us at noon and we
have had several small rain and hailstorms
during the day. In the afternoon wc
passed a large pond. The road past it
was marshy and several of the wagons trot
‘‘stuck in the mud.” Saw an Indian camp
on the other side of the pond. It was
seven o’clock before we found good wat
er. and then only a small spring half a
mile from the road. The heavens are
black to-night and every little while send
us a small sprinkling of water—expect to
get more before morning. Drove about
twenty miles.
Sunday. Judy 20. —As T expected, it gave
us a wetting last night. Tile flashes and
roar of Nature’s artillery were terrific.
The morning was cloudy and threatening,
and at noon it pitche 1 In—cold and hitter,
like November's chilly sleets in Wiscon
sin. Road soft. Scenery very nice and
soil let tite- We have had poor weather
for two days Crossed several deep streams.
Drove eighteen Fftnlord has re

Sad Accident.
Our town was excited greatly last Sat
urday, at the terrible news of an accident
having befallen a young man residing 3
miles west of the town of Dodgeville, re
sulting in the almost instantaneous death
of the sufferer. The facts as far as we
can ascertain from inquiry, are as fol
lows ;
William Cornish, a j’oung man resid
ing some three miles west of Dodgeville,
left his residence last Saturday, in cempa*
ny with .Mr. Cornish his father, Mr. John
Simpson and Mr. Dunstan, for the purpose
of hunting game. Having proceeded to
a settlement some five or six miles south
east of the town of Ridgeway, the place
designed for the hunting expedition, they
parted from each other, each taking the
way bethought best. Having been part'
ted from each other about one quarter of
an hour, Mr. Simpson heard the report of
a gun coming from the direction that the
above named Win. Cornish had taken.—
Following it up, he found the corpse of
W in. Cornish lying on his back with his
gun lying over his shoulder. The shot or
ball which had evidently cause 1 his death
entered behind his right ear and passed
through his head The body was interred
in our grave yard last Monday, when a
lane number ofweeping friends followed
him to his last resting place.

of age and leave* a wife and one child.—

LATEST NEWS.
We have delayed our paper until the
last moment, in expectation of important
news from the Seat of War. The report
on Monday was that a great battle was
in progress at Fredericksburg. At this
time, all we can learn is a portion of
the army has been engage'l with the en
emy, and that while Sumner, on the cen
tre, had failed to drive the enemy, and
had fallen back, Franklin, on the left, had
driven the rebels before him for one mile,
and held the ground. The indications are
not as favorable as we had hoped.
There is a rumor in circulation that our
array had fallen back across the Rappa
hannock, but with how much truth we are
unable to say.
Banks has landed his division, and is
reported at Weldon, which places him in
a good p sition to attack Richmond.
we shall probably have important news
soon. *
Headquarters Army of the Potomac, J
December 12—8 I*. M. |
At a quarter past nine the first gun was
fired—the engagement lastinghalf an hour
tho rebels uut making a very spirited re—
p!y. _
It 19 thought the troops will all be over
at noon. Information received during the
right and this marring by deserters and
prisoners, shows ti at the rebels have too
strong lines of halt jries in the rear of the
city ; the first one being one mile back,
and the second a m'le from the first.
Unr wuole army n iu rapid motion and
well concentrated. The troops are in ex
cellent spir.ts and an.dons to be led on
the enemy's works.
The euemy has concentrated his for
ces, and it is believed will give battle.
Much will depend upon the result of
lo day. All feel sanguine of success.
At 10 o’clock ttiis morning the fog I
to clear away, but before 11 o’clock the
a.r was again thick, which continued un
til 2 o clock, when it enti ely disappeared.
At quarter past 2 tbe rebels opened
with all their guns posted on tiie first
ri tge of hills. Their main file was direc
ted upon the city, which was filled with
our troops. Those guns which were post
ed on tiie left of the ridge were opened on
the large body of troops which crossed on
the two lower bridges an hud formed iu
line of battle and were moving obliquely
down the river, fronting the Mattapony.
Although several of their shells explo
ded over our troops, noue were injured.
(Jen. Bayard’s cavalry, which crossou on
the lower bridge, had five men killed
while endeavoring to ascertain the ene
my’s position.
The troops which crossed below are
sleeping on their arms to night, the ad
vance being within three-quarters of a
mile of the Mattapony Creek, their left
resting on the Rappahannock.
The enemy occupies the opposite side
of the creek in force.
The guns posted on the bank this side
of ti e river silenced the enemy’s artillery
after a duel ot half an hour. This ended
the firing for the day. Ti e only damage
done by the rebel shells thrown into the
city, was to add so much to its destruc
tion
Twenty-five of our men were killed last
night iu the streets while driving the reb
els out. Nearly every house in the city
has been damaged more or less by the
firing of the past few days.
Several splendid residences have been
completely riddled, as also tiie churches.
The fire appeared to he directed on the
ino.’t prominent of the edifices.

SIJKIEU'S I.ETTER A MU'OOE
Is the best Machine in the World for Family Sewing and
Eight Manufacturing Purposes. Price, with Hera
mer, and beautifully ornamented, SSO.
We wouhl ask for our (idler A Machines, the spe
cial attention of Vest Makers and Dress Makers, and all
those who want Machines for light manufacturing
purposes. They embody the principles of the Manu
facturing Machines, making, like them, the interlocked
stich, and are destined to be as celebrated for Family
Sewinu and light manufacturing purpose-* as our Manu
facturing Machines are for manufacturing purposes m
general.
FAMILY SEWING MACHINES are valuable in pro
portion to the number of things they can do well. See
what ours can do before making a purchase.
There is no doubt as to the value of our Machines for
manufacturing purposes, but it is only <>f late that the
public began to learn that the essential elements of a
note-hine best adapted in the heariest irorlr, irould
also be the elements to be em font led in a family
.Vac/-Ine. It s now well understood that our Letter A
Machine is tin- only Family Machine \et offered to the
public which has simplieiuj , rapidity. durability ,
and certainty of correct action. While as a general
thing, the sewing-machine people are candid enough to
acknowledge that our machines are unequaled for man
ufa, taring purposes, thy are almost sure to assert, in
the same br.-ath, that SixuEa’s Letter A. or Family
Machines, are notes good as theirs.’ This is a mere
trick of the trade, anil we confidently invite those inter
ested in the subject to examine for themselves, and see
what our Letter \ Family Machines, with all the re
cent improvements, are capable of doing. While they
will sew rlu- most delicate material to perfection, as al
ready stated, they are also adapted to tight man ufae
turiu!/ purposes, are) tills, la; it remembered, can not
be said <-f any of the Family Machines yet offered to
the public.
Tlk- Nos. 1 and 2 Machines are of great capacity and
application for manufac- urtng purposes.
Our No. 3 Machines are especially adapted to all
kinds of light and heavy Leather Work, in Carriage
T rimming. Hoot and Shoe Making, Harness Making,etc.
etc. They are of extra size, whh an arm long enough
to tuk • under it and stitch the largest sized dashes.—
There is scarcely any part of a Trimmers’ stitching that
cannot be better done with them than by band ; so, too,
the saving of time and lalioi is vi ry great. Ihe table of
these machines is 24 inches long, and the buttle will
hold six times as much thread as th shuttle of those
used fir tailoring purposes. The large machines work
as fast as small ones.
We have always on hand, H; naming Gauges, Silk
'I w. st. Lin-n and Cotton T rej- n Spools,
Best Ma ;I me Oil iu Bo’tl s, E c.. Etc.
We manufacture our own needles, and would warn
all persons irsing our machines not to buy any others.—
We know that Hare ...'e needles sold if the most in
ferior i/uality, at higher prices Ilian we charge for the
best. The needles sold by us are manufactured espe
cially for our machines. A bad ne. He may render
the working of the best ,each ice almost useless.
Our customers may rest assured that all our Branch
Offices are furnished with the “genuine article.”
In case of small purchases, the money may be sent in
I ostage stamp, or bank notes.
Correspondents will pi so write their names
distinctly. It is all important uat wc should, in each
case, know the I’lot Office. County and State.
Ail persons requiring information about Sew
ixf: Machines, their sizes, prices, working capacities,
and the best methods of purchasing, can obtain it by
sending to us, or any of our Branch Offices for a copy of
“ I. M. Sirgar &' Go 's Gazette,”
Which is a beautiful Pictorial Paper entirely devoted
to the subject.— lt xjciil be sent gratis.
We have made the above REDUCTION IN' PRI
CK.' with the two fold view of benefiting the public and
ourselves. The public have been swindled by spurious
machines made in imitation of ours. The metal in them
from the iron casting to the small -t piece, is of poor
quality. Their makers have not the means to do their
work well. They are hid away in secret places, where
it would be impossible to have :.l their command the
proper mechanical appliances. It is only by doing a
great business, and having 1 vten-ive manufacturing es
tablishments, that good machines can be made at mode
rate prices. The best designed machines, It AIM. Y
MADE, are always liable to get out of order, and arc
sure to cost considerable trouble arid money to keep
them in repair.
The qualities to be looked for in a Machine, are:—
Cert tintj of correct (letion at all raft* of speed,
simplicity of construction , ejn at dnrnhihty, and
rapidity of operation , with the. h>,i*t labor. Ma
chines to combine these essential qualities, must be trade
of the hast metal ami fnished to perfection. We
have the ways and means, on a grand scab . to do this.
Th ■ purchasers of Machines, win se daily 1 read it
may concern, will find that tiros*- having the above qual
ities not only work well at rapid as wi 11 as dote rates
of speed, but hint tony in the fine-t possible working
order. Our macMpes, as made ’ya -, will earn more
money with less rahor than any others, whether in im
itation of ours or not. In "act, they are cheaper than
any other Machines as a gift.
