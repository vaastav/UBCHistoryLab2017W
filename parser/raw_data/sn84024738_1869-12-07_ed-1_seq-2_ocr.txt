TU|?i>AY DECEMBER TtfW*
The President's Message.
We print the President's message to Con
gress, which was read in bothHouscs ye?~
terdav, in this morning s Dispatch- To tlic
people of Virginia, his direct and "?nu'a11*
lied recommendation that the Virginia
representatives to Congress he Immediately
admitted to their seats, will he highly gra
tifying. They will observe that the special
telegrams to the Dispatch inculcate the
pleasing impression that there is no doubt
of the speedy restoration of their State to
the Union. That unscrupulous anarchist
Porter is endeavoring to throw us nil at
sea again ; but working .against the na.
ttonal Executive and the great majority of
Congress, as well as the people of Virginia,
he will incur a defeat which will sink him
into perdition.
The late hour at which the message comes
to hand does not enable us to make an
analysts of it. We refer our readers to the
telegraphic department for the opinions en
teitained of it at the Federal capital. AN e
confess our surprise at its recommendation
concerning Georgia. The sending back
lhat State'to the original proposition is a
matter somewhat infringing principles in
dispensable to a confederacy of i-tates ex
isting even upou a very moderate basis- if
the proposed interference with Georgia be
interpreted us no more tliau proper, aiul
within the purview of the power of Con
gress, then, indeed, the States are at an end,
even in the mildest form of their existence.
We cannot regard this feature without
concern, notwithstanding that Virginia
passes muster and has every prospect ot
being regularly enrolled as an equal amoug
the States of the Union. IJuoting precedent
since historic ages, we know that the impe
rial age is to come in This country ; but it
n? ed "not be precipitated with unbecoming
haste. If Congress may reconstruct Georgia
it may reconstruct New York or Pennsyl
vania, or any of the States. The subject is
one Interesting to all the States. It those
who have had all the power since the
end of Lhe war are indifferent, we may well
afford to b<*. We have passed through an
ordeal the triumphant States know nothing
of, and cannot be worsted. I.et them look
t o the matter.
The financial part of the message is en
couraging. But it is remarkably consistent
in urging the postponement until the next
session of sundry matters relating to taxa
tion and the tariff, in connection with the
scheme of keeping up the sinking fund.
Wo stated recently that the sinking fund
was a plan which had no merit except that
of disguising the real condition of the Gov
ernment, aud compelling it to keep up taxa
tion to pay a fictitious creditor, who was
- no other than the Government itself. It
converted the Government into two beings :
one buying with the common treasure of |
the Union the obligations of the Govern
ment, and holding them against the other,
who *u-tained the relation of debtor. The
President, entering fully into thi- scheme,
urges u postponement of the matter for a
\car, as the present income is necessary to
mable the Government to meet the demands
of its other self which has charge of the
sinking fund!
Cuba is considered, but the President does
not take the popular view. It is idle to dis
guise that question. "Free Cuba" is non
sense. The United State* i- bound to have
i;, and General Grant would do more to
seeuic his reelection by a frank and bold
policy towards Cuba than he would by any
other measure he could suggest.
We have uo time further to refer to the
message, which has the merit of being quite
fr^nk and quite independent in its tone.
The Banquet - Restoration?'Virginia.
The banquet given by the Richmond
Chamber of Commerce was one of the most
genial and brilliant festive occasions thai
ever occurred in this city. It gathered sig
nificance and consequence from the circum
stances that attached to it. The guests of
the evening were mainly representatives of
northern cities?gentlemen of great intelli
gence, experience, and practical sense, and
of course more or less liberal and compre
hensive in their views and sentiments. They
were selected from local bodies composed of
prominent business men, and at their own
expense journeyed 1 rom home to this place j
to deliberate upon matters of national con
cern, chiefly rclatingto commerce and trade,
in which they had ouly such interest as that
which was general to the country. They
assembled here at a time altogether pecu
liar?jpst after a disastrous civil war, while
Virginia is deprived of political equality
w ith the States and while the harmony and
reciprocal relations of the sections of the
I iiiou are slowly being reestablished under
many incidents which tend to impede them.
The assembling, therefore, of such gen
tlemen in the city of Richmond, the centre
of the forces of resistance to the Govern
ment in the late war, as guests of the
people of Richmond, was a matter of un
common interest, and one which could not
fail to have its influence upon the course ol
events.
As the temper and expressions 011 the oc
casion were of the most liberal and concili
atory character, that influence must be
highly salutary and beueficial. In both the
circumstances and the character of the ban
quet we must consider it oue of the most
notable and happy public diuners that have
taken place in this country.
Virginia was consequentially the most pro
minent figure in the mind's eye, as she was
evidently the most warmly, cherished by all
present if we take the language of the occa
sion as indicating the affections that dwelt
in the hearts of the speakers. But the feel
ings uttered and policy espoused generally
were of the broadest and most comprehen
sive character?embracing the whole Union,
deploring sectional jealousies, and execra
ting all narrow views und personal ambi
tions which were,hostile to the immediate
aud complete political restoration of the
Union and the establisraent of entire har
mony throughout the land. Mr. C'hittes
vks, of New York, uttered briefly the pre
vailing sentiment when he said that there
was not a man, woman, or child, iu the
North, or not a man who deserved the
uaipe of man, and was not a monster, who
did not desire the immediate restoration
of Virginia to the Union.
Tho speeches were remarkable for good
tastb, fine humor, excellent wit, and, above
all, the noble impulses of patriotism. The
gem of the evening was the polished speech
of Mr. Hopes in response to the toast to
Boston. His language was felicitous and
lbs ideas classic. The national and kindly
sentiments of the evening were imbued with
a bright ftamo by his glowing spirit. One 0!
the ruoit appropriate points in his speech
was the introduction of the good old fable
of the wind and the inau, wherein the fu
rious blast only makes the man draw tighter
about him the cloak which the bright sun
that followed made him throw away. This
he compared to the uncivil and dogmatical
assaults of bigotry upon tho liabits, senti
ments,and prejudices, if you will, of men,
and thus made them all the more to cling to
impulses which they may nevertheless
readily be persuaded to surrender or modify,
under the bright Hunshinc of kindue-s, hos
pitality, and affection. Hto happy applica
tion of the fable was received with perfectly
unrestrained and uproarious applause.
The night \vill never be forgotten by
those who participated in it. The Rich
mond hosts acquitted themselves most cre
ditably ; but, of that it would better be
come the guests than ourselves to speak.
Few things have contributed more than
will this public festival to the restoration of
good teeling between the sections.
. "Without meaning to intimate that a sin
gle incident occurred to disturb the smoot-i
flow of the stream of genialityand intersec
tions! affection, we venture to refer to a sort
of playful raillery of Virginia by Mr. Taylor,
of St. Paul, which perhaps demands a word
in reply. That gentleman spoke in the
kindest spirit, we are aware, but even a
jest, which suggests a departure trom prin
ciple, leaves an impression, however faint.
Mr. Taylor, in explaining bis vote against
the central line in the Board of Trade, al
luded to the rigid States rights doctrines 01
Virginia before the war. and contrasted her
adherence to them then with her readiness
to receive appropriations from the Federal
Treasury at this time.
The highest compliment paid by any
member of the Board to the central water
line was paid by Mr. I aylor iu explaining
his vote against it. He thought it proper.
But he need not have taunted Virginia,
whose position is clear, eoncientious, and
invincible. A" long as she adhered to hei
construction of the constitution, which was
left by its frumers open to two construc
tions, she never received one cent by her
vote from the Federal treasury. She thu>
proved her loyally to her principle when it
was against her interest* But the wai has
settled the question. '1 lie sword has been
thrown into the scale and established that
construction which makes it alike the right
and the duty of the Federal Government to
make all improvements within the national
territory demanded by thegeneral wel
fare.'' Virginia has yielded to the decision.
And shall she be called in question now for
obeying the law thus established by sharing
with other States iu the disbursements
from the National Treasury which grow out
of it? Is she to be impugned simply be
cause it is her interest to conform to the
settled construction ? Does not lmr rigid
adhereuce to her principle, whoi it wo?
against her interest, when millions were
voted to ojher State*, and not a cent to her
who gave to the United States, without
compensation, the vast northwestern teiii
tory?vindicate her from suspicion now;
According to the old proverb, it is a bad
rule that does not work both ways.
If Virginia were now to set, up her vie* *s
agrinst the power and the dufy of the Fede
ral Government to construct great national
works, she would justly iucur censure as
absurdly obstinate, madly refractory, in
sanely hostile to her own interest?in short,
as faithless to the law and her own welfare.
As she proved her loyalty to what she be
lieved the true constitutional construction
by denying herself everything and opposing
all appropriations to internal improvement
by the Federal Government, she will now
equally display her loyalty and wwbmi by
sustaining all appropriations to works ol
proper dignity, as well those within her
own border as elsewhere.
"VVe know the kind feeling of Mr. Taylor,
and ku?vw he meant no imputations. But
it is well tu let this matter be all the time un
derstood. Virginia is now fairly under the
new dispensation, honorably acquiescing in
the decision of force, and will oppn*e no
refractarv resistance to the new order, even
though she is benefited physically by it!
With this brief comment upon the playful
raillery of the member from St. Paul, in
view of all the scenes and sentiments of the
past week, and with the political and physi
cal pfospccts before us, in the most exube
rant spirits we heart ily exclaim :
44 Now, by St. Paul, tiis work goes
BRAVELY ON ! *'
Mississippi and Texas.
Allcorx is elected in Mississippi, and
Judge Dent is discomfited bv several thou
sands? possibly twenty.
The course of events in Mississippi is
strange. We hear privately that things
took a turn after the campaign begun that
"squelched" Judge Dent. Ai.lcorn was
smart euough to fix his potation so as
effectually to put him to sleep. People
found out?how we know not?that All
corn was better for tliein than Dent, and
many white people staid away from the
polls, leaving everything to Allcorn and
his confreres. We imagine that even had not
the public mind been rendered indifferent
by outgivings that have not appeared in
print, General Ames would have taken
measures to secure the result that has taken
place. So it is all one, save that the Mis
sissippians have hopes where they had not
expected to have ground for them.
Texas has two Radicals up for Governor,
and will probably not be much bettered by
the choice of either over the other. In ease
of the victory of either, we imagine there
will be no difficulty in the way of the ad
mission of her representatives to Cougress.
So we may look for the prompt admis
sion of these two States, and feel perfectly
assured that no hitch with regard to them
will interfere to prevent the prompt admis
sion of the Virginia representatives.
We may not only fee) gratified but proud
of tbfc position of Virginia. She has not
beeu entangled by the blunders and com
plications that have bothered most of the
southern States, and she will, beyond doubt,
be admitted with less obiection and cavil
than has any other of the States except
Tennessee?not that she has betrayed any
self-abasement, but that she has acted in a
plain, straightforward way, in view of the
fact that the power of the Government had
marked out the line for her, and it would
have been madness to have pursued any
other. She has conformed where conformity
was a State aud national duty, and where
not to conform would have been a breach of
good sense and inauly fortitude.
Bcrlingame and his tail of long-tails are
now at Berlin, where it will soon be re
ported that they drank and ate and nego
tiated until they were sated, and departed,
to the very great relief of everybody they
left behind. This travelling commission is
a perfect novelty?an entirely new " dodge."
It is impossible that any sensible aud prac
tical statesman can consider it anything but
a "job," invented by one of the commu
nity known as the smartest people in crea
tion. We'll bet on Berlin-game bagging all
the game that's caught in this diplomatic
sport over the globe. lie will retire with a
fortune.
Vetoes by Wholesale.?It is said that
Governor Flanders, of Washington Terri
tory. has vetoed a hundred bills passed by
the Territorial Legislature. This beats all
precedent.
National Banxs. ? Nineteen national
banks have, since the war, either failed or
voluntarily retired. Their aggregate circu
lation amounted to $1,(30-1,Gbo; which, of
course, will be all redeemed.
The expedition which Is to survey the
route for a proposed ship canal across the
Isthmus of Darien will, It is said, leave for
its destination about tho l*t of January.
Admiral Davis will have command of it.

THE NATIONAL CURRENCY AGAIN*.
The various propositions from Ihe com
mittee on the national currency [published
above] were then taken up.
Mr. Llastie took the lloor in favor of the
minority report. He thought we had better
let well enough alone. Our present cur
rency is as good if not better than any we
ever'had. and the present financial policy of
the Government is rapidly reducing the "na
tional debt.
Mr. Iveenan, of Mihvaukie, was opposed
to a return to specie payment uutil a fur
ther reduction of the debt had been made.
Mr. Stranahan thought the Board ought
uot to commit itself to any particular scheme
uutil the President's message was received.
Mr. Louey, of Baltimore, moved to strike
out all aftcr'the word "same'' iu the third
resolution proposed by the majority report.
Lost.
Mr. Brown, of Portland, was opposed to
any restrictions upon the proposed new
banks in the South and West other than
those now imposed upon Eastern banks.
Mi\ Taylor, of St. Paul, argued that there
was 110 excess of circulation in this country,
ill Great Britain the circulation is twenty
dollars per capita, in France twenty-five
dollars, while in this country it is only sev
enteen dollars. Contraction was not needed.
Mr. Fralcy, President of the Board, (Mr.
Eagan, of Chicago, in the chair,) then took
the tloor. lie had studied financial ques
tions for hull* a century, and gave briefly
t he result of his experience. Immediately
alter the outbreak ot the war of 1812 we
had a suspension of specie payments every
where in the United States except perhaps
in the Northeast. He had seen the copper
currency of the United States selling at a
greater "premium thun we have lately seen
gold selling. The remedy for that sus
pension was the Bank of the United
states, which, in conjunction with the
bankrupt law, accomplished the object
(resumption), but almost ruined the peo
ple. In 188T there was another memora
ble suspension of specie payments, re
sulting from an undue expansion of the
currency, etc., and it was several years be
fore an active effort was made to resume,
because people did not think the time had
come. Before the resumption, however,
gold ceased to sell at a premium, uud, mea
sured by our relations with other countries,
was actually below par. Gold was. at one
time imported as a commodity, and was sold
here and paid for in ottr "coin with pro
fit. Debts were again wiped out by
the sponge of a bankrupt act, which seems
to ho the legal scheme of repudiation. The
speaker did not believe we are now in a
different position from what we were in
1887, just before specie payment was re
sumed. The only measure to which we
should look is one by which our currency
can be made equal to specie. A slight tonic
would effect this object without much diffi
culty. The way to the equalisation of the
currency, or a return to specie currency, is
through the custom-house. The very mo
ment that you make the greenback as
good as gold in the payment of duties,
the desired result is accomplished. This
course is also for the interest of labor.
In conclusion, Mr. Fraley said he thought
the first resolution propose'd by the majority
embraced all that the Board ought to say
on the subject just now. Any detailed
scheme might embarrass the great idea of
the imporianco of a speedy return to specie
payments. "When this is brought about
there should be perfect freedom of banking
upon the principle of immediate convertl
bility. ,
Mr* Ropes, of Boston, advocated the
adoption of tbe majority report.
A vote wa?? then taken upon the substl
tute of Mr. Grubbs, and it wax lost, the
mover casting the onlv vote in the affirma
tive.
A vote was then taken upon , the resolu
tion offered by the minority, and it'was re
jected?ayes, 24; noes, 31.
The resolutions proposed by the majority
were then put upon their passage, and the
first was unanimously adopted. The second
resolution was lost?ayes, 22; noes, 38.
The third resolution was also lost?avcs,
23; noes, 3.3. And the fourth resolution,
by a vote of 33 ayes to 27 noes, was also lost.
[Note.?A two-thirds vote was required to
pass either of these resolutions,] So the
tir-t, advocating a speedy return to specie
payments, was the only one adopted.
GENERALCANBY.
During the debate on the finance ques
tion Mnjor-GeneralCanby visited the Board,
and was invited to a seat within the bar.
He remained an interested auditor until the
adjournment.
At 2 o'clock the Board took a recess for
one hour.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
When the Board reassembled. Mr. Guno,
of Cincinnati, moved that the official steno
grapher be directed to prepare a report of
the debate ou finance as soon as possible, and
that the same be printed and transmitted to
Congress. The motion was lost.
Mr. Branch, of Augusta, Un., asked per
mission to introduce a resolution in regard
to the finance question, but the Board
refused to grant leave.
UNIFORMITY IN THE RATE OF INTEREST.
The President declared in order the
twenty-fifth proposition, recommending the
passage of a law superseding the usury laws
of the several States, and making seven per
cent, per annum the uniform rate of inte
rest when no contract has been made for any
other rate; and authorizing contracts to be
made in writing for the use of money at any
rate of interest Upon which parties iihle and
willing to contract for the same may agree.
Mr. Jeffries, of Philadelphia, moved that
it be referred bark to the Executive Coun
cil with instructions to frame a memorial
to Congress on the subject.
Mr. Hawley, of Detroit, moved as a sub
stitute that the Legislatures of the several
?States be requested to abolish the usury
laws and make seven per cent, tlio uniform
rate of interest.
Mr. Richards, of Chicago, thought that
this country was too large to have its affairs
regulated in every respect by a central Go
vernment. Jle favored having as much as
possible done by the .States.
Mr. Hastie, of Charleston, was opposed
to having the rate of iutere.-t fixed by Con
gress, and believed that the several'States
could not be induced to carry out the pro
position.
Mr. Trezevant, of Memphis; Ilawleyand
Hazard, of New York, took the same view.
Mr. Loney. of Baltimore, moved to lay the
whole subject on the table; which"was
agreed to.
UNIFORM INSPECTION OF FLOUR AND GRAIN.
Mr. Keelan, of Milwaukie, presented the
report of the committee on the propositions
for the uniform inspection of Hour and
grain. The committee recommended the
indefinite postponement of the subject.
The report was adopted, and the recom
mendation of the committee was agreed to.
TRADE STATISTICS AND REPORTS.
Mr. Gano, of Cincinnati, from the com
mittee to which were referred proposition
1, presented a report urging the importance
of the collection oi trade statistics and ex
change of daily reports, and recommending
the appointment of a committee to digest
sonic scheme for the better "carrying out of
these ideas. The report was adopted.
TARIFF DUTY ON RAILROAD IRON.
The twenty-sixth proposition (from the
Memphis Chamber of Commerce) was next
usidered. It is embodied in the following
solution.
"Resolved. That it is the manifest inle
st of both Government and people that
e construct!'u of railroads >houId be en
uraged. and that Congress is hereby
spectfully asked to do this by repealing
! duties oil railroad iron."
Mr. Trezevant, of Memphis, made an
:i borate ;weument in favor of and Mr.
'ctherill against the resolution.
Mr. Jiauley submitted an amendment.
Iiich w:i- accepted by Mr. Trezevant. pro
fling that Congress be memorialized also
repeal al! duties ou ship-building matc
ils.
Mr. Hastie, of Charleston, expressed Im
position to the proposition and amend
mts, and Mr. Dure, of Charleston, fa
red tbe same.
Mr. Sampson, of Boston, ofi'ercd the fol
ding substitute :
?' Whereas the present duties on the arti
'S of iron, coal, and salt, are excessive;
erefore
" Ilesolced, That the interests of the
untrv demand a general modification of
e tariff' and reduction ol the duties on
m, coal, and salt."
Hie substitute was accepted, but not re
iving, on a motion for it* adoption, the re
isite two-thirds vote, failed of adoptiou.
le vote stood?ayes, 33 ; noes, 24.

WASHINGTON NEWS.
Tite Prospect.?A Washington letter In
the Baltimore Sun of yesterday says :
" The admission of tho three southern
State*, Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas,
may cause some little heated discussion,
but there is such an overwhelming pre
ponderance of judgment in l'avor of the re
ception of tlie senators and representatives
from Virginia that there is no reasonable
ground for expecting delay in that case;
and the opinion is very well detined in fa
vor of immediate admission of the congres
sional delegation from Mississippi and
Texas as soon as they shall present them
selves properly qualified.
?' But a Very small number of Democrats
adhere to the Pendleton idea of payment of
the debt in greenbacks, and there is not
much prospect of any one declaring him
self for repudiation.
?? There is scarcely a doubt that a law will
be passed to rclieVe uil persons uow dis
qualified in franchise and from holding
office, a- provided in the fourteenth amend
ment. Such, at least, is the almost unani
mous opinion of members t hat have recently
arrived."
ITow Now??The new senator from Vir
ginia, 31 r. Lewis, was in Washington on
Friday, and did not conceal his intention
to act with the Republicans in Couirrcss.
lie has no sympathy with the so-called Con
servatives. who, while professing friendship
to Presidcut Grant, await only the oppor
tunity to take ground with the" Democratic
party.? Washington Chronicle.
The general opinion is that Virginia will
? admitted to "the Union, but there is a
dear determination on tho pavl of Congress
to secure the safety of the new Republican
Constitution. Exactly bow this i* to be
done has not transpired. [We should think
>10/.] The President, does not conceal bi
anxiety for the speedy admission of the
Stat", and such is the clear w ish of the Re
publicans in Congress; but there is a deter
mination not less apparent to save the new
Constitution. It is hoped that Senator
Lewis will lie able to remove the only ob-fr?
elc ill the way?Washington Chronicle.

ington to Lynchburg, Va., ,1. F. Kims i
