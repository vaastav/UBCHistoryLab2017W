measure to permanently increase the fa

the Hungarian-Galician railroad, while

These preparations will enable a large
force to be thrown into Galicia at the

KANSAS PROHIBITION.
The Cnit4 State Knpreme Court Sot
tin tluk CoaatUatioumlitr of U K
- aa Prohibitory Law.
Washington, Dec 6. Tbe Supreme
Court of the United States yesterday srav
a decision in the cases of Jacob Mugler
against the State of Kansas and the Suite
J against Ziebold. The decision of the lower
court was sfnrmed in the Mugler cases ana.
reversed in tbe Ziebold case. Tiie effect
is to declare valid the Prohibition law in.
Kansas. Tbe opinion was by Justice Har
lan, who said:
The general Question in esch case is wbethe
the Prohibition statutes of Kansas are in con
flict with that clause of the Fourteenth amend
ment which provides that "No State shall make
r enforce any law which shall abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens of the Uni
ted States, nor shall any State deprive any per
son of life, liberty or property without due pro
cess of law."
That legislation y a State prohibiting the
manufacture within her limit of intoxicating
liquors, to be refold or bartered for general use
as a beverage, does not necessarily infringe
any right, privilege or immunity secured by
the Constitution of the Un ted States i
made clear by the decisions of this court,
renderetl before and since the adoption o
the Fourteenth amendment. It however,
contended that although the State may pro
hibit the ma-nfacture of intoxicating liquors
for sale or barter within her limits lor general
use as a beverage, no Convention nor Legislature
has the right under our form of Government
to prohibit any citizen from manufacturing fox
his own use or for export or storage any arti
cle of food or drink not endangering or affect
ing the rights of others. The argument made
in support of the first branch of this proposi
tion briefly stated is: That, in the implied
contracts between the State and the citi
zen, certain rights are reserved by the latter
which are guaranteed by the constitutional
provisions for the protection of life, liberty and
property against deprivation without due pro
cess of law and with which the State can not
interfere; that among those rights is that ot
manufacturing for one's own use of either food
or drink; that, while according to the doctrines
of the commune, the State may control the
lastes, appetites, habits, dress, food and drink
Of the citizen, our system of -Government,
based upon the Individuality and intelligence
Of the people, does not claim to control him ex
cept as to his conduct to others, leaving him the
sole judge as to all that only i.ffects himself.
It will be observed that the proposition and
the argument made in support of It equally
concede that the right to manufacture drink
for one's personal use is subject to the condi
tion that such manufacture does not endan
ger or affect the rights of others. If such
manufacture does prejudivially a3ect ths,
rights and interests of the community, it fol
lows from the very premises stated by coun
sel that society has tbe power to protect
itself by legislation against the injurious con
sequences of that business.
But by whom or by what authority is it to be
determined whether the manufacture of partic
ular articles of drink, either for general use oi
for the personal use of the maker, will injurious
ly affect the public Power to determine such
questions, so as to bind all. must exist some
where, else society will be at the mercy of the
few who, regarding only their own appe
tites or passions, may be willing to
imntril the r.pii-e nnil securftv of Ihe
! many, provided they are permitted
ito do as they please. Under our system that
power is lodged with the legislative branches
of the Government. It belongs to that depart
. ment to exert what are known as tbe police
powers of the State. It must determine prim-
j ari, wnat measure, are appr0priiite and need
fuiforlh. protection of the public morals, th
the
public health or the public safety.
j As the courts must obey the Constitution
rather than the law-making department of Uov-
eminent, it must, upon its responsibility, de
j termine whether in any particular case these
i limits hare been passe i. Tbe courts are not
j bound by mere forms, nor are they to be misled
by mere pretenses. Tbey are at liberty in
I deed, are under a solemn duty to look at the
! substance of tbfngs whenever they enter upon
( the inquiry whether the Legislature has trans
I cended tbe limits of Its authority. If, there
I fore, a statute purporting to have been enacted
J to protect the public health, the public morals
1 or the public safety, has no real or substantial
relation to those objects, or is a palpable inva-
sion of rights secured by the fundamental .law.
it is the duty of the courts to so adjudge, and
' thereby give effect to the Constitution
and legislative departments of the Government.
it is difficult to perceive any ground for the Ju
diciary to declare that the prohibition by Kan
sas of the manufacture or sale within her limits
of intoxicating liquors for general use there as
a beverage is not fairly alaptod to the ead of
protecting tbe community against tbe evils
which confessedly result from the excessive
use of ardent spirits. There is here no jusiifl
cution for holding that the State, under be
guise merely of police regulations, is aiming to
deprive the citizen of his constitutional rights.
If, therefore, a State deems the absolute pro
hibition of the manufacture and sale within her
limits of intoxicating liquors for other than
1 medical, scientific and manufacturing purposes,
sentatives.
ii is ii iuuubiucuuu principle in our
institutions, indispensable to the preservation
of public liberty, that one of tbe separate de
partments of Government shall not usurp pow
ers committed by the Constitution to another
department.
With reference to the assertion that the pro
hibition of the manufacture and sale of liquor
deprives liquor dealers of their property with
out due process of law, the court ftays that all
property under the American form of govern
ment is subject to the obligation that it shall bo
used so as not to injuriously affect the rights of
the community and thereby become a nuisance.
The State of Kansas had a right to prohibit the
liquor traffic. It did not thereby take away the
property of the brewers. It simply abated -a
nuisance.
For the reason stated, says Justice Harlan,
we are of opinion that Mugler, tbe plaintiff
in error, ha not been denied by the Judg
ment of the Supreme Court of Kansas any
, rignt, privilege or immunity secured to bim
by the Constitution of the United States, and
its judgment in each case is accordingly af
firmed. We are also of opinion that the Cir
cuit Court of the United Sta'es erred in dis
missing the bill, the bill of the State in her
suit af-ainst Ziebold and Hagelin. The decree
in that case is reversed and the cause remand
ed, with directions to enter a decree granting to
the State such relief as the act of March 7, ltsSi,
authorizes.
Justice Field concurred in the opinion as
it related to the two cases in which the
State of Kansas was defendant, but dis
sented as to the case of the State of Kansas
against Ziebold. He agreed, he said, to so
much of the opinion as sustained the va
lidity of tbe act of Kansas prohibiting tho
sale of intoxicants which were manuf act
ured in the State after the passage of the
act. He was not prepared, however, to say
that the prohibition of the manufacture of
such liquors, if intendel for exportation,
could be sustained, nor that the State could
forbid the sale under regulations for tho
protection of health and morals of the peo
ple of any article which Congress ml jbt au
thorize to be imported. He was not ready to
admit that New York or any other Coast
State could defeat an act of Congress. Nei
ther could he concur in tbe validity of the
13th section of the Prohibition act
of Kansas because be believed it
authorized tbe destruction of property
without due process of law. He could not
see upon what principle tbe Legislature
after c!oing the brewery could order tbe
destruction of liquor which it admitted
mignt ce vaiuame lor medicinal or mechanical-
purposes. Nor could he see why the
protection of tbe morals of tbe Slate re
quired the destruction of bottles and oiher
utensils after the liquor had been eniittic.il
from them.
