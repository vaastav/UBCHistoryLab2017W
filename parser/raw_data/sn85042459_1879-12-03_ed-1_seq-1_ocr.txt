Virginia City, Dec. I.—Last
night seven out of twenty-two
prisoners broke jail here, and es
caped by making a hole through
the wall under the window.
Two benches were set up and the
table put across for a platform.
Blankets were used to prevent
uoise, and the hole was made
easily ou account of the defective
mortar used iv its construction.
The principal escapes are Michael
Langan alias "Red Mike," murder
er of Pat Leonard; Mark Brown,
horse-thief, and three burglars,
named Bchofleld, LatTerty aud
Rosenbaugb, alias "Klein." None
have yet been retaken.

ington specials say: Some of the
Southern Democrats, like Stevens
and Welton (?) of Georgia, thinks
that the Democrats ought to aban

like Singleton and Chalmers, think
It wise to continue the struggle.

Nkw York, Deo. I.—The World
has a strong article on the utter
ances of Beecber yesterday, iv
which It says: Even the local au
thorities of San Francisco have
drawn the line recently at Passion
plays, aud though yesterday was
the Urst Sunday in Adveut, we
think our readers will agree with
us that Baecber, in his eagerness to
give vivacity to his teachings,
overstepped the limits which divide
tlie sensational from the scandalous
Iv sermonizing. Tbe following is
a syuopsiaed report of Reseller's
language above ulluded to: "Who
was Jesus? A peasant, a mechanic
at a period of the world when work
men were very low in the social
scale; and if one had asked who
was this Divinity whom you
worship, he would huvesald, Jesus.
Of what country? Nazareth. Who
were bis parents? Joseph and
Mary, reputedly. Who was his
mother? Mary, who just escaped
divorce through the magnanimity
of her betrothed. Who was his
father? No oue. What was his
country? Judea—a Jew—a bastard
Jew. What did he do? Workec
as a oarpenter iv the shop of hh
putative lather. What became o
him? He was charged with a vio
lotion of the Roman laws, tried
aud convicted and put to death. A
bastard Jewish mechanic; a male
raclor put to death for violating the
laws of his country! Is that Ihe
fellow you bring to me for worship'
Now, If you look at things from
the surface, Jesus Is that, and tha
only; and Paul, having the high
est training, might easily hay
thrown over all tho poetic veil o
mystery."

London, Dec. I.—An appeal
from Cardinal Manning for sub
scriptions to alleviate the distress
in Ireland was read iv all the Cath
olic churches of the metropolis
yesterday. It is stated that in the
west of Ireland such hunger,poverty
aud want are now to be seen as
have never been known since the
great Irish famine. A general col
led ion for this purpose is appoint
ed for Bunday next.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Both Houses of Congress met
at noon yesterday, and after per
fecting their organization, tlie
President's Message was received
and read. It is a voluminous doc
ument, and gives a very complete
survey of the political and econom
ical condition of the country.
It alludes with sati-fartion to
the great and rapid increase nf our
foreign commerce, giving a large
balauce of trade in our favor, and
improving the public credit by the
attraction of gold to our country
from abroad. The progress of re
funding has made an annual sav
ing iv interest of 514,297,177. The
amount of national debt which
matures within leSB than two years
is $792,121,700, of which $500,000,
--000 bears interest at the rate of
five per cent. It is believed that
this part of the public debt can be
tefunded by the issue of four per
cent, bonds, and by tbe reduction
of interest which will thus be af
fected, about $11,000,000 can be an
nually saved to the Treasury. It
asks Congress to refrain from ac
tion on the subject of establishing
a legal relation of value between
gold and silver, in view that the
leading commercial Nations of Eu
rope are endeavoring to agree upon
one rate.
A SOP TO THE NATIONAL BANKS.
Tlie message says that the retire
ment front circulation of United
Btates notes, with capacity of legal
tender iv private coutracts, is a
step to be taken for its progress to
ward a safe and stable currency,
Which should be accepted as tbe
policy and duty of the Govern
ment nnd Hie security of the peo
ple. It is my Urm conviction that
the issue of legal lender paper
money, based wholly upon Ihe au
thority and credit of the Govern
ment, except in extreme urgency,
is without warrant In the C'oustitu-
lion and In violation nf sound
financial principles. It is recom
mended that the existing laws for'
the accumulation of a sinking
fund sufficient to extinguish the
public debt under a limited period
be maiutained. If any change of
the objects or rates of taxation Is
deemed uecessary hy Congress, it
ia suggested that experience has
shown that a duly can be placed on
tea aud coffee which will not en
hance the price of those articles lo
the consumer, and which will add
several millions of dollars annually
to the treasury.
POLYGAMY, ETC.
Tlie message recommends more
striugeut provisions to tbe law
aimed at tlie suppression of polyg
amy in Utah, and suggests tbe
withdrawal or withholding of the
rights and privileges of those who,
in the Territories, violate the law.
It asks Congress to remedy any
defects iv the laws so aa to secure
the free exercise of tlie right of suf
frage to all citizens.
It devotes a paragraph to Civil
Service Reform, and declares that
what lias already been done in that
direction has been beneficial to the
public service. It requests Con
gress lo make the necessary appro
priation for the resumption of the
work of the Civil Service Commis
sion, which has been suspended for
some time tor want of means to go
on. In this connection the message
deuounces the practice of making
levies for party purposes upon tbe
salaries of public officers.
THE CHINESE QUESTION.
The message says on the subject
of Chinese immigration, that tbe
Government of China has signified
its willitigness to consider tbe ques
tion of the emigration of its sub
jects to the United Slates with a
dispassionate fairness, and to co
operate ln such measures as may
tend to prevent injurious conse
quences to the Uniled States. The
negotiations are still proceeding
ami will be pressed with diligence
THE MEXICAN AWARD—ISTHMUS
CANAL, ETC.
Tlie third instalment of tlie Mcx
loan award has been put In coursi
of distribution, and in conneclioi
with this subject the Preaitlen
draws a highly satisfactory pictur
of tlie good feeling existing be
tween the two Governments—!
feeling which he believes will lesi
to an expansion of our trade wltl
Mexico, and au increased contribu
tlon of the capital and industry c
our people to the development c
thegr.at lesources of that country
He recommends legislation look
lug to th:'- result.
Alluding to the resumption of di
plomatic relations wilh Colombie
he says It is fortunate in view t
tbe great interest now felt in a
lnter-oceanlc canal. He meutloi
the Nicaragua route only, and «

Hie capital for its completion would
readily be furnished from tbiscoun
try and Europe; which might, fail
ing such guarantees, prove inacces
sible.
THE INDIAN PROBLEM.
The message calls upon Congress
to organize some form of govern
ment over the Territory of Alaska,
and then summarizes tbe reports of
Cabinet officers. Treating of that
of the Secretary of tbe Interior on
Indian affairs, it recommends the
enactment of a law "enabling tlie
Government to give Indians a title
in fee, inaiieuabie' for twenty-five
years, to the farm lands assigned to
them by allotment and also repeat
the recommendation made iv my
first annual message that a law be
passed admitting Indians who can
give satisfactory proof of having
by their own labor supported their
families for a number of years and
who are willing to detach them
selves from their tribal relations,
to tbe benefit of the Homestead
Act, and to grant them patents
containing the same provision of
inalienabllity|for a certain period.
The message recommends that no
change be made iv the control of
the ludiau service.
THE SUPREME COURT.
Tlie Message shows that the bus
iness of the Supreme Court is large
ly in arrear, and that no assiduity
ou (he part of the Justices can ac
complish more than is now done.
The remedy suggested hy the At
torney-General is the appointment
of additional Circuit Judges, and
the creation of au intermediate
Court of errors aud Appeals which
shall relieve the Supreme Court of
a part of Its jurisdiction, while a
larger force is also obtained for the
performance of circuit duties. The
President commands this sugges
tion to tbe consideration of Con
gress.
TIMBER LANDS ETC.
The message recommends that a
law be enacted enabling the Gov
ernment to sell timber from pub
lic lauds without conveying fee
where such lands are principally
valuable for timber thereon, such
sales to be so regulated as to con
form to domestic wants aud busi
ness requirements, while at the
same time it guards against the
sweeping destruction of forests.
The message also recommends au
increased appropriation for tbe De
partment of Agriculture, the en
couragement of education, and a
provision for the National Library;
also recommends an appropriation
for the completion of the Wash
ington monument, aud the adop
tion of a generous policy towards
the District of Columbia, especially
iv the matter of repairing streets
now rendered useless and endang
ering the health of the city; It also
invites the favorable consideration
by Congress to the wants of the
common schools of the District of
Columbia.
