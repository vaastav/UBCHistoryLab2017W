The President's Message. ,
"The Annual Message of President Job rat-on
was submittal to both Houses of Con
gress on Monday at twa o'clock. We did
s not receive a copy iu time to place it before
our renders in full thLi week, but 4jivc a
FvnoHis of its main features. The tone of
J.he Mes-bage is decidedly moderate , No al
lusion i niade to the pending Constitutional
Amendments, but the President regards his
own policy the best, and thinks the admis
sion of Senators and Members of Congress
"would have , accorded with the great prin
ciple enunciated in the Declaration of Amer
ican Independence, that no people ought
to be-tr the burden of taxatiou and yet be
denied the right of representation." In
speaking of Mexican affairs, he states that
an arrangement had been made with the
French Government, under which the troops
ot the latter were to have been withdrawn
in three detach men ts,one on the first of No
vember, bit as this has not been done, care
. was taken by our Government to make its dis
sent known to the Emperor of France. The
President hopes, however, that France will
reoonsiJer the subject and adopt some reso
lution in regard to the evacuation of Mexi
co that will conform to the existing engage
ment and meet the expectations ot the (Tin
ted States Government. , .The President re
grets that no considerable advance has been
made in the adjustment of differences with
Great Britain arising out of the depreda
tions on our national commerce and other
trespasses committed during the late civil
war by British subjects. lie regards the
Fenian invasion of Canada as a violation ot
the neutrality laws, but expresses the hope
that judicious amnesty will be granted to
those who had taken part in the invasion.
In concluding he says our Goveruuieut is
now undergoing its most trying ordeal, and
finally passed without impairing its original
strength and symmetry.
Utah. A rather deplorablo state of
. things exists in Utah. Violence against
citizens not in sympathy with Mormonism
is becoming quite common. Prominent
men among the "Gentiles," as all who are
not Mormons are called, live in eonstaut
danger of assassins. - Persons who give ut
te ranee to their disappobatiou of the prac
tice of the "Saints," are warned to leave
the Territorj'. Assaults and murders are
of frequent occurrence, but the criminals
are never sought out and punished. One
of the most horrible affairs was the murder
of Dr. Kobiuson, formerly an army surgeon,
who had located and married at Salt Lake
City. After having his property destroyed,
he was one night wakened up with a rcqueH
to attend a man who had broken his leg,
and after getting into the street, was struck
over the head with a sharp instrument and
immediately shot through the brain with a
pistol. As the chief of Police and one of
h 8 suVirdinatcs were implicated in the de
struction of the Doctor's property, it is sus
pected that they also know more about -his
assassination than they are willing to admit.
The Fenians in Ireland. After all it
would seem that the threats of Stephens,
the Fenian leadcr,of an outbreak iu Ireland
before the end of the present year, were not
mere "sounding words, signifying nothing."
Dispatches received by the Atlantic Cable,
a few days ago, bring the startling intelli
gence that the Irish have taken np arms
against the povernment, and military and
naval measures have been promptly set on
foot by the authorities of England for the
suppression of the outbreak. j he extent
and the whereabouts of the insurrection are
not stated, but from the tenor of the dis
patches we infer that the conflagration
must be an extensive one. The ' London
press, of course, urges stern repressive rueas
, urea. The public here will await further
advices relative to the business with lively
anxiety. " .
The Temper of Congress. Evidence of
the temper of Congress was exhibited by
the passage, on the first day of its session,
of a bill in. the House, without debate, re
peallng the 13th section of the act of July,
1862, which gave the President the power
to pardon persons who had engaged in re
bellion. There were but twenty-nine Dem
ocratic votes against it. As it will probably
pass the Senate, the President will be con
sequently, limited to the constitu tional power
to pardon only after trial and conviction.

A Caxlj-Head Question.
We learn by a,New York exchange that
the Courts of that city will soon have to de
termine a veritable "hair-splittiog" ques
tion. It seems that a Mr. Darnall, who is
as white in appearance as the general run
of people, applied to the Board of Registers
of the Eighteenth Ward to have his name
placed upon the list of voters. The mem
lers of the Board, possessed of unusually
keen oprics and more than ordinarily deli
cate sensibilities, discovered, what the bal
auce uf the Gothamites had overlooked.that
there was a kink in the hair and a lack of
pellucidity in the- cuticle of the applicant,
which left no doubt upon their minds that
he had negro blood coursing through his
veins and accordingly they refused to com
ply with his request. For doiug this, the
Board has been prosecuted by the disfran
chised '-citizen." . ; The plaintiff claims that,
irrespective of the property qualification
required of colored voters in that State, he
has the same right to vote as plenty of, oth
er men wtio are uo whiter than he and
his counsel insists that, before his client is
again subjected to a like fefusal.a jury shall,
once for all. determine what lnfimtesMuial
viciousness runs in his blood aud what fila
meuts of crime cluster in the hirsute covering
of his head. We are left completely in the
dark regarding the political antecedents of
the aggrieved individual, bur. as there are
no few "curly-headed" men who might, on
similar charges, have their right to vote
brought into question, we regard it of the
highest importance that no mistake should
occur in the adjudication of this case. Un
der such circumstances we think the Court
would be justified in calling to its aid an ex
pert who is familiar with the "hair-splitting"
differences of blood, and at this time
we do not know of any better qualified for
this purpose than some one of the Demo
cratic editors or orators who have, for sever
al years, talked so learnedly on the subject
of the amalgamation of the Caucasian aud
Ethiopian races in the United States. r If
the Judge and jury are desirous of arrivii g
at a decisiou that may immortalize them
in this world, they should not fail to call in
one of these skillful Democratic ethnologists.
If a Mvant of the political uegropbobist
school can't determine, with minute exacti
tude, the point in controversy, there will be
no use of anybody else trjing.
South Carolina. Gov. Oit gives an
auxious statement of the condition of South
Carolina. The people and the crop.s are
poor, and neither can supply the other.
Population, white aud colored, Vare aban-
ctouiii their old Iwmw, nnd uaigtatin to
strange places where they can find bread."
The Governor hereupon complains of the
intolerance of the conquerors, every conces
sion to whom has only "sharpened their
malice and intensified th'eir revenge." The
Governor's opposition to the Constitutional
Amendment follows this, as a matter of
course.
The End of the World. Professor
Benjamin Pierce, of Harvard University,
who has acquired a national reputation "as a
mathematician, has recently shown that the
sun will continue to enliven the earth and
sustain the human existence 30,000,000
years. Our descendants will enjoy them
selves for ages yet to come. , What is tech
nical!' known as the meteoric theory of so
lar heat has been cast aside. The end of
the world, regarding which some religious
sects have founded a creed, is postponed in
definitely. "'
Gen. Butler Sued. It is stated that
two suits have been commenced in the Su
preme Court of New York, against General
Butler, in which John II. Lester, a resi
dent of New York city, charges him with
false imprisonment, damages being laid at
$100 .000, and with fraudulent conversion of
property, damages at $50,000. Lester, . it
may be remembered, received a free pass
from Secretary Stanton to bring his family
from the South to the North during the late
war, but Duller disregarded the permit and
imprisoned him.
Gen. Grant of late has been more free
and open in his opinions of the political
situation than heretofore. In conversations
with prominent Rebels he is frank in tel
ling them that they have been enemies to
the Government, and are now virtually on
parole. He indorses the Constitutional
Amendment, ' and says it is the best terms
the South can expect.
Arrest of John H. Surrat. A Wash

sins of President Lincoln. '. '

; The general talk of Radical Congressmen
now in Washington is, that a reasonable

MESSAGE OF PBESIDEIJT JOHUSOS.
Synopsis of its Main Features.
Moderation in Tone No Allusion te Amendment
orother Plans Think Disown pouev. xuv
; Mexican question Ourciainis against England.
The message opens, as usual, with thanks
to Providence for peace and prosperity, in
the abatement of the pestilence and the
restoration of civil authority throughout the
United States. A review is then had of the
facts set forth in the President's message,
relative to the measures the Executive had
taken; for the gradual restoration jof the
Southern States to the Union, such as ap
pointing provisional Governors, etc. Only
one thing then remained, the message says,
to be done, and that was the admission of
Inrnl renrpsentatives to Congress. This
r.
question was devolved solely on Congress.
In the meantime, the President says, no
other plan having been proposed, he con
tinued his efforts to perfect restoration
through the Judicial, reveuue and postal
systems of the country. The South had
also ratified the amendment abolishing sla-
veryv conformed their social laws to the fact,
repudiated rebel debts aud proceeded in
good faith to legislate for the amelioration
of the colored race. The President then
speaks as follows :
"Congress, however, yet hesitated, to ad
mit anv ot these States to representation,
aud it was not until the close of the eithtli
month of the sosion that an exception was
made in favor of Tenuessee. I deem it a
subject of profound regret that Congress has
thus far failed to admit to seats loai Sena
tors and Refresentativea from the other
Mates whose inhabants, with those ot
Tennessee, had engaged in rebellion. Ten
States, more than one-fourth of the whole
numfter, remain without representation.
lne seats or nrty meuioers or tne tiou.se
and twenty of the Senate are yet vacant
not by their own consent, not by a failure
of election, but by the refusal of Congress
to accept their credentials. J heir admis
sion, it is believed, would have accomplish
ed much towards the renewal and strength
ening of our relations as one people, and re
moved serious cause for discontent on the
part of the people of those States. It
.would have accorded with the great princi
ple enunciated in the declaration ot Ameri
can Independence, that no people ought to
bear the lurderi of taxation and yet be de
nied the riht cl representation. It would
have been in consonance with the express
provisions of. the Constitution that each
State shall have at leat oee representative,
and that no State without its consent shall
be deprived ot equal suffrage in the Senate.
These provisions were intended to secure to
every State tic right of represent! tion in
Congress, and so important was it deemed
by the framers of. the Constitution that the
equality of the States shall be preserved in
the Senate, that not even by an amendment
of the Constitution can any State without
itaounscnt be denied a voice iu that branch
of the National legislature. It has been as
sumed that these States, by rebellion, be
came territories; but all departments of the
Government, with great distinctness, refus
ed to sanction an assumption so incompati
ble with the nature of our Republican sys
tem and the professed objects of the war.
Throughout the recent legislation of Con
gress, the undeniable fact makes itself ap
parent that these ten political communities
are nothing less than States." '
The President then quotes the Crittenlen
resolution of I8C1, on the object of the war,
and reviews the legislation of ' Congress,
wherein the States are recognized, and also
in Lincoln's proclamation. He then pro
ceeds again as follows :
"In the admission of Senators and Rep
resentatives from ail of the States, there can
be no just grounds of apprehension that
persons who are disloyal will be clothed with
the power of legislation, for this could not
happen when the Constitution and the laws
are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Con
gress. Each House is the judge of its own
members. A Senator or member may be
admitted or rejected, or his credentials re
ferred to a proper committee. If admitted
to a seat it must be on evidence satisfactory
to the House of which he becomes a mem
ber, that he possesses the requisite loyal and
Constitutionalqualitieations: If refused ad
mission and sent to his constituents for want
of due allegiance, they arj admonished that
none but persons loyal to the United States
will be allowed in the counsels of the nation,
and the political power and moral influence
ot Congress are thus effectively exerted in
the interests of loyalty to the Government
and fidelity to the Union. Upon this ques
tion, so vitally affecting the restoration of
the Union, and the permanency of our form
of Government, my convictions heretofore
expressed have undergone no change, but
on the contrary their correctness has been
confirmed by reflection and time. If the
admission of loyal members to seats in Con
gress was wise a year ago, it is no less wise
and expedient now.' ll this anomalous con
dition is right; if in the exact condition
of these States at the present time it is law
ful to exclude them from representation, I
do not see that the question will be changed
by the eflux of time. Ten years hence, if
these States remain as they are, the right of
representation will be no weaker. . The Con
stitution makes it the duty of the President
to recommend to the consideration of Con
gress such measures as he shall deem expe
expedient. I know , of no measure more
imperatively demanded by every considera
tion of national interest, sound policy and
equal justice, than the admission of loyal
members from the unrepresented States.
It would consummate restoration, renew vig
or and btabilify, allay doubt, induce emigra
tion, and open new fields of enterprise. ' '
The President concludes on restoration by
repeating the warnings of others against a
consolidated despotism, and does not make
the slightest reference to the pending Con
stitutional Amendment nor to the much
talked of amnesty and suffrage questions.
AH he , says , on reconstruction has been
given verbatim. , . . . .
The President speaks as sollows on Mexi
can affairs : - '
"In the month of April last, as Con cress
is awar.?, a friendly arrangemeqt was made
between the Emperor of Fraucc and the
President for the withdrawal from Mexico
of the French expeditionary forces. This
withdrawal was to be effected ;ro three de
tachments, the fiist of which it was under
stood was to leave Mexico in November, i
I860. Immediately on the completion of
the evacuation the "French Government was
to assume the same attitude in regard to
ot n-intervention as is held by the United
States. Repeated assurances have beii
given by the Emperor since that agreement,
that he would complete the promised evac
uation within the period named, or even
sooner- It was reasonably expected that
the proceedings thus contemplated woujd
produce a crisis of great political interest in
the republicof Mexico. Thenewly appoint
ed Minister of the United States Mr.
Campbell,' was therefore sent forward on
November 9th, to assume his f nnctions. It
was also thought expedient that he should
be attended in the vicinity of Mexico by the
lieutenant ueneral of the United btates
army, with the view of obtaining such in
formation as might be important to deter
mine the course to be pursued by the Uni
ted States in re-establishing and maintain
ing necessary and proper intercourse with
Mexico. IJeeply interested in the caase-of
liberty and humanity it seemed an obvious
duty on our part to exercise whatever in
fluence we possessed for the restoration and
permanent establishment in that country of
a domestic and' Republican form of Govern
ment. Such was the condition of affairs in
regard to Mexico, when, on the 22d of No
vember, .official information was received
from Paris that the Emperor had some time
before decided not to withdraw a detach
ment of his forces in the month of Novem
ber, according to agreement, but that this J
decision was made tor the purpose of with
drawing the whole of these forces in the en
suing spring. ' Ot this latter determination,
however, the United States has received no
notice or intimation, and so soon as inform
ation was received from this Government,
care was taken to make known its dissent to
the Em eror of France. I cannot forego
the hope that France will reconsider the
subject and adopt some resolution in regard
to the evacuation of Mexico which will con
form to the existing engagement and meet
the expectations of this Government. The
documents on this subjecX will e laid before
Congress. , With th evacuation of Mexico
by the French no subject for serious differ
ences between France and the United States
would remain." , -
On our relations with Great Britain the
President writes as follows :
''It is a matter of regret that no eonsid
able advance has beeu made toward an ad
justment of the difference between the U
n i ted States and Great Britain, arising out
of the depredations on our national com
merce, and other trespasses committed dur
ing the civil war by British subjects iu vio
lation of inter national law and treaty obli
gations. The delay, however, maybe be
lieved to have "resuited in no small degree
from the domestic situation of Great Brit
ain. An entire change of ministry occurred
in that country during the last session of
Parliament. The . attention of; the-new
ministry was called to the subject at an early
d;y, and tiipre is hoiuu reason to believe
that if will be considered in a becoming and
friendly spirit The importance of an early
disposition of the question cannot be exag
gerated. Whatever might be the wishes
of. the two Governments, it is manifest that
good will and friendship between the two
countries cannot be,, established until a re
ciprocity in the practice of good faith and
neutrality shall be restored between the re
spective nations."
.The President then alludes to the Fenian
invasion of Canada, as a violation of the
neutrality laws, and the proclamation
which he issued, and the trial and sentence
of captured Fenians, and ays :
''Such representations have been made to
Great Britain as will, it is hoped, induce
judicious amnesty to all who were- engaged
in the invasion." '
After referring briefly to the annual re
ports and Tecom mending that the District of
Columbia be allowed a delagate in Congress
the President concludes as follows :
"In the performance of a duty imposed
by the Constitution, I have thus submitted
to the representatives of the States and the
people such information of our domestic
and toieign affairs as the public interests
may require. Our Government is now un
dergoing its most tryinjr ordeal, and mv
earnest prayer is that the peril may be suc-J

uiiany passed wunout impar
ing its original strength and symmetry. The
interest of the nation are best to be promot
ed by the revival of fraternal relations, the
complete obliteration of our past differences
and the inauguration of all the pursuits of
peace. Direcling our efforts to the early
accomplishment of these great ends, let u
endeavor to preserve harmony between the
eo-ordinate departments of the Government,
that each in its proper sphere may cordially
co operate with the other, in securing the
maiiitainance of the Constitution, the pres
ervation of the Union and the perpetuity
of free institutions."
Signed' Andrew Johnson. ,
" r
. Gov. Orr, of South Carolina, has acknowl
edged that the black man free is of far more
use in a community, and consequently of
larger benefit to himself, than in a condition
of bondage. Gov. Orr confesses by this ad
mission, that the system of bondage which
theSouth maintained for so many years, and
to extend which it essayed to destroy the
Government of the Union, was a barbarity
by which the rights of a nation were igno
red and the interests of humanity annulled.
The coming question is, Will the affirma
tive action of three-fourths of the States
represented in Congress be sufficient to en
graft the amendment to the Constitution?
If not, then the question who shall de
cide the terms of restoration receives for
its answer, the States that did their utmost
to 'destroy the Union. Common, if not
legal sense, admits of no such construction. ",

Humboldt, in the "Cosmos,"- says he re
pels "the cheerless assumption of supe
rior and inferior races of men. There are

This is the scientific intepreratioii of the
doctrine of our Declaration of ndepend
ence that "all men are created equal,"
by the greatest philosopher of modern
time.--"-In - view of Jefferson's well-known
anti-slavery sentiments there can be no
doubt that he fully intended to embrace in
his general assertion every race. Negro suf
frage is in strict accordance with the creed
of the Revolutionary fathers, who not only
preached but practiced it in nearly every
State, and with the demands of an eolight
eid civilization. Our country abounds with
proofs ot the necessity of the ballot as a pro
tective agency to guard thenaiura! right of
its possessors. In this aspect it is as e-ential
to the colored as to the white race. The for
mer, on account of prevailing prpjudiees. are
indeed in greater need of protection than the
latter, because while few dare to outrage
the rights of white men. as a class, many
are disposed to heap outrage and wrongs
upon colore! men on account of their color.
