The carpenter we hired had a handy
little arrangement in which to keep nis
bits when not in use. He had a piece
of overall cloth about two feet long,
jrfolded up at one side, with pockets
1 sewed all along about the length of a
bit and of different sizes according to
the diameter of the bits to be slipped
into them. Then by wiping them dry
and putting them into those pockets
and rolling the whole thing up, he had
them in good, compact shape and as
snug as a bug in a rug I thought it
a pretty good idea.
To prevent pumps from freezing:
Drill a small hole, say one-sixteenth
I of an. inch or less, in pump stock,- be
low well or cistern cover, far euough
down so that frost will not reach it.

President Zelaya of Nicaragua
Issoes Statement
SCORES SECRETARY KNOX
Declares Latter Ignored Proposal
for Unbiased Hearing.
Managua, Nicaragua, Dec. 11.—"The
United States unjustly condemns my
administration," said President Zelaya
in an interview. "I proposed to Sec
retary of State Knox that he submit
the case to the Investigation of a com
mittee of his own choosing, agreeing
to surrender my rights to the presiden
cy if the charges in his letter to Isi
dore Hezera, former Nicaraguan min
ister to the United States, were sus
tained. Secretary Knox has not re
plied.
"Defenseless against the hostility of
a powerful nation, I must submit, al
though I have been condemned un
heard.
"The coercion of the United States
will not redound to the credit of that
nation, whose motives are Questioned
in all Latin America. The shooting of
Groce and Cannon was a pretext. Both
were amenable to the laws of Nicara
gua, which distinctly authorizes the
shooting of individuals commanding
rebels. It is different if a person is
captured during the course of an in
ternational war. The course of Sec
retary* Knox to establish the inviol
ability of Americans participating in
foreign revolutions will result con
stant revolutions led by immune Amer
leans.
"The initiative in the shooting of
Groce and Cannon was not mine I
simply refused to extend clemency to
them after a properly constituted mili
tary tribunal had passed upon the
case."
Instances of Alleged Hostility.
President Zelaya then recited sev
eral instances of alleged hostility
against him in the United States
through paid articles appearing in
American newspapers. In one of these
instances he declares, he was endeav
oring to raise a loan in France when
his enemies persuaded the United
States to interpose an objection
through the French ambassador at
Washington on the pretext that the
money sought was intended for the
purchase of war materials, when in
reality it was to have been used in the
construction of a railway
"When I am ready to surrender the
presidency," continued President Ze
laya, "I cannot do It precipitately, as
it would result in uprisings by several
factions, each of which is eager to se
cure power
"I am in negotiations with the revo
lutionists to secure their indorsement
to a successor who will be acceptable
to all parties, and have submitted the
name of Jose Madrlz, judge of the
Cartage court.
"I hope this will obviate the neces
gity for American intervention, which
would be intensely distasteful to the
•whole of Latin-America. I am in
formed that it is the Intention of the
United States to prevent my leaving
Nicaragua. I do not believe this to be
true."
FOR PUNISHMENT OF ZELAYA
Senator Rayner Introduces Resolution
Authorizing Action.
Washington, Dec. 10.—A resolution
authorizing the president to take the
necessary steps for the apprehension
of President Zelaya of Nicaragua and
for his punishment on the charge of
murder, if the facts in the possession
of the state department warrant such
action, was introduced by Senator
Rayner.
The resolution recites the circum
stances connected with the execution
of two Americans, Groce and Cannon,
by order of President Zelaya, as gen
erally understood through published
reports from Nicaragua. The resolu
tion will lie upon the table and Sen
ator Rayner has given notice he will
address the senate in its support.

FEATURES OF TAFT MESSAGE
Some Important Matters Left Over for
Future Action.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Opposition to
the proposed immediate congressional
investigation of the sugar Import scan
dals in the New York custom house
and likewise to any farther revision
of the tariff at present absence of any
specific recommendation regarding the
crisis in Nicaragua and actual recom
mendation of legislation to forbid the
issuance of judicial injunctions with
out notice in labor controversies and
for the establishment of a system of
postal savings banks, may be con
sidered the most striking features of
the first annual message of President
Taft.
The Nicaraguan question, conserva
tion of the nation's natural resources,
needed amendments to the anti-trust
and interstate commerce acts and the
contemplated revision of the federal
statutes governing the organization of
the armed forces of the nation in time
of war are all reserved for possible
treatment later in special messages.
TAFT MAKES ADDRESS
Attends Opening of River and
Harbor Congress.
Washington, Dec. 9.—Speaking in
strong endorsement of the policy of
waterways improvement, President
Taft stirred up much enthusiasm dur
ing the opening hours of the sixth
convention of the National Rivers an I
Harbors congress here.
Hundreds of delegates, representing
every section of the United States,
filled the great banquet hall of tne
New Willard, where they sat under
their state banners. Men and women
delegates arose when the arrival of
the president was announced and
gave their visitor a noisy reception,
concluding the demonstration with
three cheers and a tiger.
President Taft spoke at length,
dwelling upon his interest In the pol
icy of waterway improvement and of
fered advice to the delegates upon
methods for attaining the ends they
seek.
President Taft took a position of
vantage on the fence regarding the
organization's platform for a bond
issue for waterways improvement.
The president announced himself in
favor of securing a declaration from
congress for improvements of the Mis
sissippi, Missouri and Ohio rivers, as
outlined by the army engineers, and
the beginning of work on the projects
with appropriations from the current
national revenue, leaving the question
of a bond issue for a later time.

Washington, Dec 10.—A controversy

Heavy Loss of Life in Recent
Storm Bfl Lake Erie.
FOUR STEAMERS'WRECKED
•tjAjjtk.*
Property Damage Will Aggregate
More Than a Million.
Cleveland, Dec. 11.—The terrible
storm which passed over Lake Erie
Wednesday night and Thursday reaped
a deadly harvest and laid waste more
than $1,000,000 worth of vessel prop
erty.
Late reports show that fifty-nine
lives were lost, that twenty sailors
were rescued, that four boats were de
stroyed and that one is aground heav
ily damaged. The summary shows:
Steamer Clarion, burned, fifteen
lives lost, six saved.
Steamer W. C. Richardson, sunk,
five^drowned, fourteen saved.
Car ferry Marquette and Bessemer
No. 2, wrecked, thirty-eight lives lost.
Steamer Josiah Munro, aground,
attempting to rescue sailors from the
Clarion.
Tow barge sunk, no lives lost.
Sailor from Richardson, crazed by
exposure, commits suicide.
No one now considers that there is
any chance that any of the thirteen
members of the crew of the Clarion
have survived. Two of the crew are
known to have perished. Neither is
any hope now held out for any of the
members of the crew of thirty-eight of
the car ferry Marquette and Bessemer
No. 2, who have been missing for four
days.
At Conneaut, O where all of the
members of the crew lived, their
friends and relatives are crowding the
docks for scraps of news, but there is
not a crumb of comfort.
ASQUITH OUTLINES POLICY
Self-Government for Ireland Promised
by Liberal Leader.
London, Dec. 11.—At a manster meet
ing in Albert hall Herbert Henry As
quith, the British prime minister, laid
down the policy on which the Liberal
government is appealing to the coun
try. He repeated what had been said
by other ministers—that if it were re
turned to power the government would
demand the limitation of the power
of the house of lords—and then went
a step farther and pledged that the
Liberal party would grant self-govern
ment to Ireland
The meeting was marked by the
greatest enthusiasm of an audience
which filled the vast hall and which
was composed entirely of men, women
having been denied admission in the
fear that there might be a counter
demonstration by suffragettes. Every
corner of the hall had been searched
during the day for women and a small
band of them was routed out, but they
managed to get two male supporters
into the meeting, who interrupted Mr.
Asquith momentarily with cries of
"Votes"for women!" Then they were
promptly ejected.
STEEL STRIKE GROWS WORSE
Disorder Marks Trouble at Different
Points.
Pittsburg, Dec. 8.—The strike of the
Amalgamated Association of Iron,
Steel and Tin Workers against the
American Sheet and Tin Plate com
pany, a subsidiary of the United
States Steel corporation, which has
been in progress during the past five
months in the states of Ohio, West
Virginia and Pennsylvania, is gradual
ly assuming serious proportions.
Developments in the labor dispute
clearly demonstrated the temper of
the participants. A house, occupied
by nonunion men at Struthers, O., was
dynamited and seven persons injured
a soldier opened fire on a striker at
Bridgeport, O., without effect, how
ever nonunion men were severely
beaten at Newcastle, Pa., and the au
thorities at Wheeling, W. Va., and
Martins Ferry, O., are preparing for
any trouble that it is feared may oc
cur momentarily at the mills in that
vicinity.
