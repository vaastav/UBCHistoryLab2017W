BETTFH TO rrnvtsll RAW ????'RIAL.
There is no object, savs Director Roberts, In forc?
ing the public to tak?- our coin out of th? country by
making It more expensive to take bars. It would
Ye Ivtter to furnish the raw material than the
manufactured article. The??? bars will have to be
ehlppe) from New-York le Philadelphia, melted
and worked Into coin at some waste and consider?
able ? xpense lo replace the coin exported, while the
hars WOUM have MTVSd every purpose for export
The export charg?- was put on bars several years
ssro when gold exports were heavy and some
m?ans to ?lisoourafre them w*?re. souKht. Wh'-n th?
current com is abraded -xportrrs will pay a slight
premium to get hars, wh ch are full weight, hut our
current gold coin Is now largely new and on the
average eloss te standard, and exporters are pre?
ferring to ship it rather than to pay lh<? bur charge.

The Government ha?: now practically no bullion
available for th?? coinage of subsidiary currency.

??? GERMAN BUSINESS WORLD.
no permanent TRoriihn ovnn monf.t
e??e?tep THF. indcstriai, room.
rierlln, Dec. 1?? The money market situation
continues to be the chief concern of the German
business world. London exchange continued to
rise all last week. Gold exports ar" now pos?
sible, and therefore an Increase in the hank rate
Is considered virtually certain. The officials of
the Relchshank were In consultation yeeterclay
on the subject, and there was a general senti?
ment In favor of nn advance to 7 per cent. A
d?finit?? decision Is Ilk* ly to be taken on Tues?
day.
The Relchshank statement yesterday showed
much less Improvement than Is usual at this
time of the year. Private discount??, after rising
to a point near the official rate, eased off some?
what yesterday, hut the rise in the London pri?
vate rate causes an expectation here that the
Rank of England will make yet another ad?
vance.
Thus far. however, money market conditions
d?? ti"t Inspiro a fear of permanent trouble In
Bi'rlln. a feeling of arsurance arising from the
fact that O?erman ? lr?'?ilaf ion Is so thoroughly
saturated with gold that any considerable de?
rangement is Impossible.
To-day a high financial authority gave the
correspondent of The Associated Pre.-?s an esti?
mato of the gold In clrenlathm In Germany,
pia frig this at ?.????,?O?,??? mark?, and pre?
dicted that the Industrial situation would con?
tinue very strong. A loading ?>m?ial of the
Relchshank explained that the industrial boom
had not yet reach? 1 Its culmination, but was
now extending to the textile Industries.
"Ir^n prices,?? he said, "continue to rise. The
syndicate of rolled wir.? manufacturers has ad?
vanced prl-e?" 10 marks a ton. A Fran.^o-Ibl
pian syndicate, with a capital of 110,000,000, has
acquired the Wpptphalian COal mine Kaiser
Friedrich, and Intenda t?? establish Immense
motlerfl fuma? es and steel mills on the Port
mund-Ems ('anal. A motion will be Introduced
In the Reichstag Concerning the organization of
Herman Chambers of Commerce in foreign cities,
In which particular Germany now lags behind."
The packet post between the I'nltcd States
and Qertnany is a fucccs.s. During the month
Of October 3,000 packages went from (?ormany.
nnd during th?? month of November B.000. as
against 11,000 during the whole of 1807,
After keeping ?llene?' at first, th?? Agrarian
p: eea now begin? t?> make a united attack upon
that part of President McKinleys Message to
Congress relating to the Joint commission propo?
sition. The "Peutsche Tape?? Z?-ltung" says t"
?lay:
Buch a proposition is wholly unacceptable, it
la monstrous. Us outcome would be thai the
shrewd Yankees Would bamboozle the Qerman
members of the commission about American
meat, with caldron? double bottom???! sn?! sim?
ilar trick?, while the AmerteanS here would
manufacture evidence against rMefS and tvinos
President McKinley'? claim as to the heatthfiil
nesa of American meats is preposterous, after
the ?candnkuis embalmed meat trial.
