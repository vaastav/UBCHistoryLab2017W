THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The message of President Harrison,
■which appeared in full in yesterday's i
Rboobd-Uhiov, despite its length, ought
to be read by every citizen. If such state
documents were more iead, tho broad
ened public intelligence would insure us 11
more rational and conservative thought j
concerning public affairs, and inspire the 11
people more generally with greater conti- i
dence in the strength and the enduring
quality of the American Republic. 11
We can pass over the warm defense the
President makes of the protective policy,
and the thrusts he gives the oncoming j
administration concerning the obligation
tt has assumed to test the merits of a tariff
system that it is expected will be radi
cally different from the present. For tbat
much was the privilege of the President ;
as a candidate who suffered defeat upon '
the lines ofa high protective tariff.
Aside, then, from that matter, the !
President's message is an optomistic doc- j
ument. It glows with fervid recital of :
the prosperous condition of the country, !
and revels in figures cited in proof not i
only that we havo greatly increased our !
coastwise trade, butour export commerce :
also, and that this has reached all lines of ,
production and all kinds of industries. I
He holds, too, that the benefits
of increased industry, augmented I
trade, enlarged exports and new
markata and the benefits of commercial
reciprocity, good wages, augmented pro
duction and remarkable prosperity havo
not been confined to the few, but havo
been widely distributed and have related
to betterment in all dlr.ectlons. He ex
cepts only agriculture, but while it has
not been, he says, wholly excluded from
the general advance, yet the causes of its
limitation in profits have been overpro
duction, and the fact that the farmer can
not produce to order. Nevertheless, be
believes that the English agriculturist i
■would gladly exchange the returns of his '
labor for those of the American farmer, j
and adds that while the market prices of '
wheat and cotton have been low, tbe gen
eral average of prices has been such as to
give agriculture a fair participation in
general prosperity.
This argument of general comfort,
prosperous conditions and highly benefi
cial commercial, productive and indus
trial results to be thankful for is used to
supplement the President's regret that
the people have not indorsed the pro- ;
tective policy.
Nevertheless, the statistics recited by
the President, with partisan intent, have
nn importance worthy of distinct consid
eration and closer analysis than can be
given in a general review of the message.
His statement that the public bus
iness has been transacted with fidelity
and procision under his administration
will be agreed to by all the country,
which will also tako pride, as does Presi
dent Harrison, in the fact that in the lour
years of his administration there has not
been misappropriation of a cent or the
loss of a dollar by defalcation on the part
of any Federal official.
He but briefly refers to the Behring Sea
controversy, for the reason that it is now j
before a Board of Arbitration, but he I i
suggests wisely that the taking of seals in
North Pacifio watorsby American vessels
as the schools pass to thoir favorite waters
beyond the Aleutian Islands be forbid
den. When arbitration as to the right of
tho United States over the sea, and the
needs for a closed season Is ended, the re
striction, so far as it can be done under
the verdict, should be extended to the
vessels of all nations.
His treatment of Canadian questions is
vigorous and American. He protests
that the Canadian Pacific Railroad should
not be permitted to snatch from us com
merce legitimately ours, because tbat line
is exeuipt from the operation of laws that
bear stringently upon our own lines of
transportation. Nor is tho message to be
mistaken in its tone concerning Canadian
arrogance and interference with our con
cerns, nor as to Canadian activity In dis
turbing negotiations between the United
States and Great Britain.
He justifies his retaliatory action re
garding the imposition of canal tolls at
Kault Ste. Marie, and suggests that if
Canadian intolerance and injustice do not
cease we will be warranted in tbe con
struction ol American-side canals that
•will free us from the necessity of using
the Welland or any Canadian route. As
suredly the whole American people are
in cordial accord with the President's ex
pressions on this head.
His pride in the new navy is warmly
I l |,il l■anil and reflects the general senti
ment ot the Nation. His urgent appeal
for full restoration of American shipping
ia fortified by istatements and statistics
concerning American service done by
foreign bottoms that are all prepared, in
case of war, to be converted into the
cruisers of an enemy. He declares, with
entirely justifiable indignation, that it is
•shameful that out of American payments
foreign ship-building should be so pro
moted as to enable it to become a weapon
of offensive warfare against us. In short,
the message makes a strong plea, and a j
sound one, for an augmented naval re- j
Serve, and such subsidy aid by the Gov- i
eminent to that end as is justified by the j
importance of the interests at stake, and I
by the fact that we may by this policy j
make trade follow our flag.
He puts in a warning word concerning !
our threatened Pacific Coast trade be
cause of ihe seductive policy of foreign
shipping lines, that are enabled to accom
plish their ends by enormous subven- ;
tions granted by the British Government* I
SACHA^yTO DA-XT RECORD-FyiOy, THURSDAY, DECEMT.ET. 8, 1502.-SIX PAGES
President Harrison puts in, for the sec
ond time, a protest against the conditions
in the Court of Claims, where nearly $10,
--000,(k.j of claims are now pending against
the United States without adequate pro
vision to enable the Government to
properly defend against them. Unques
tionably the Department of Justice ought
to be given means sufficient to enable it
to hunt out the facts where there is rea
son to believe that proof of the dis
loyalty of the claimant can be had. Presi
dent Cleveland was tho eleventh Presi
dent and President Harrison the twelfth
who has reterred to the fact—that ougbt
to cause American cheeks to blush with
shame—that the French spoliation claims
are still unsettled.
The President gives us in more concise
form than does the Postmaster-General
the facts concerning the gratifying in
crease and betterment of the postal serv
loa. That tho public debt has been re
duced in his term some £_09,0._J,000, and
the annual interest charges eleven and a
half millions, is a fact cited by Presi
dent Harrison with pride. He points
out also that 1114,460,906 more has bean
paid out for pensions during his term to
November Ist, than between March 1,
lSN'i, and March 1,189 a He defends tho
pension polie-y warmly, and enters an
earnest plea for the veteran soldier.
A telegraphic cable to Hawaii, the im
mediate utilization of our privilege io es
tablish a naval station in Pearl Harbor,
and encouragement of the construction of
the Nicaragua Canal, are urged, and with
reasons that meet the common ju Iginent
of the peOple of tiie I nii.d States.
The President approvea the new poll
adopted concerning the Indians, the set
ting asiele to them lennis In severalty, tin;
support of tho Indian schools, and the
c.inversion of our Indian wards into citi
zens, lt is to bo regretU d thai he did not
advise the complete abandonment of the
contract school system, that the priest
and the church teacher shall not from any
funds of the Government tinii support
while proselyting among the red men.
• tur relations with the South American
States he reports as peaceful, and our
commerce with them steadily improving,
but to be more extended if the policy is
continued, as it should be, of paying iib
eral sums for the carriage of United States
mails in swift American vessels, so eou
structed as to constitute a nasal reserve.
The extirpation of the cattle disease, he
says, has been due to governmental ac
tivity and department faithfulness; as a
result a value has been aided to the cattle
industry that the President thinks can i
hardly be estimated, and that promises to
be enormous in the export of live cattle
to English ports, without the require
ment tbat the animals shall be killed at
the docks.
The President strikes a chord that will
lind responsive vibrations in the vast ma
jority of American hearts when, referring
to the quarantine imposition he ordered
against the cholera, he warns the country
tbat not only sanitary conditions, but
those all'ecting tbe moral, political and
industrial interests of the Nation, demand
that there shall be new and more rigor- j
ous restrictions imposed upon admission |
to the country aud to tbo high privileges !
of citizenship.
Ho refers again to the wisdom and the
bounden duty of Congress to give atten
tion to tho evils of our election methods,
and to the threat to tbe Republic that
lies in the assault upon the freedom of
electors and their right to cast their bal
lots tor Federal officers unimpeded, and
to have their votes honestly counted. He
urges Congressional investigation and
legislation concerning practices that as
sail the elective franchise as it relates to
the choice of officers of tho National Gov
ernment. This strong, patriotic and per
fectly sound advice will bo ridiculed by
the radical Democracy as a plea for tho
"force bill." Nevertheless it will re
main that tho advice of the President is
wisdom.
Several other subjects are treated in the
message; not a few of them are so han
dled as to defend the protective tarilf pol
icy, of which President Harrison is a sin- j
cere advocate, since ho omits no oppor- !
tunity to make figures aud statements of !
prosperous couditions testify with his firm i
belief in the benelicence of that policy, j
But ths is not the time to discuss the !
issue; the President is privileged to urge i
it and make his message defensive of it; I
it_ proper debate will come on when the
wisdom of the tariff the vote ofthe couu- \
try demands shall be inaugurated.
outside of the defensive character re
ferred to, the President's message is a
patriotic and statesmanlike paper,
breathes a spirit of high hope for the ad
vance of tbe Nation, is thoroughly Amer
ican, and does not lack the qualities that
always inspire respect—vigor aud cour
age.
