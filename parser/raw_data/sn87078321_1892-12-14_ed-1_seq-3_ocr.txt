Report of Secretary of
the Navy Tracy.
The annual report of Secretory or the
Nnvy Tracy furnishes nn Interesting resume
of the work accomplished by that depart
ment, especially in tlie building of moilenl
warshirs, the prtsong need of which the
recent imbroglio with Chili ntil the growing
merchant marine, Insteied under the mni:
suhsld e, well demonstrated.
On the 4th of March. IhSiI, the fleet of the
United fstntes Nn'. y, n f n t Irnm a few old
ship long since obsolete and fust going to
decay, consisted of thice modern steel tea

chased from abroad, ns they culd not be
made in this country. These vessels were
the Doli.liln, Atlanta nml Huston. During
the present administration 111 new war ves
sels hnve been put in commission, nil of
which, except live of the earliest, hnve been
manufactured in this coiinlty. 'Jliree new
teel toys hnve nlso been put into service.

The progress, both in ships and ordnsnn ',
by which the C luted (stales ims emerged
from its condition ot helplessness at ten. ami
by the employment of iis own resources,
ha distanced its more experienced competi
tors, marks nn epoch in the naval develop
ment not only ot this country but of the
world.
On the subject of armour plate tests the
report snv that alter a lows leries of tests, a
high decree ol 'superiority was tinally reach
ed. A nickel plate, uiniinfncturcd by Cur
ncgie, iinoer the rolling process, showed n
narked superiority over the all steel plate,
and both it and a corresponding llerhlchem,
Pu , plate ahnwtd h capacity ot resilience to
penetration nenriy 10 jier cent. greu'er than
( lint, of the Freii'-h all steel piste. The
high carbon nickel Harvey plate was not
on.y the best of all the plates tested but Ihe
best armor plate ever subjected to ballistic
test up to this time. Never before these
trials Mel nny nrinor f late in the world been
subjected to such a test as was if presented
by theie blows of k total energy of 2;,u00
toot tons,
't he result may he told in n word. All
five of the proji ctil. a were unushed upon
ihe surface of the nlate The reoiilt has,
never been equaled or even approached be
fore by nny urmor plate. American or ford
eigu. Jt has demonstrated that the Unite
Htntes, in the reconsi ruction of its new nitvv ,
which, 10 years aim, had no existence eeu
on paper, i enabled to place UHn each mid
all of iu armored veseels a material the
like of whieli the world, up to this tiine.has
not seen. -
Following the example of the Vnited
States, the F.nglish liovernment four weeks
ngo held a trial of the new American armor
and it is clear from the highly Miccessfu!
results of tin trinl that the United mates in
nt"sd or being the last in the race in the
construction of vesso s of war or of borrow'
inn its best Ideas from abroad, has set un
examp.'e in this respect which oihcr marit
ime Hiwers will speedily lollow.
The number of high-powor Rims in use
on vessels in commission or ready for use,
is 2,'i", 77 nre p rtly completed and 110 arc
atlnat.
There Is every reason to believe thnl the
smokeless powder now used will entirely le
place the ordinary powders in all guns of
smaller caliber, mid that its use willgradu
ally lie extended up to the largest calibers.
During the past year 1,600 pounds of this
powder have been made at ttie loipedo sta
tion nt Newport.
Tho important characteristics of Kmnien
site as a high explosive nre still the subject
of experiment. For this purpose a six-inch
wire-wound (tun was used, and shells tilled
with Kminensite hnve been tired from this
gun with a velocity of 2,000 foot-seconds
that exploded on impact with water at f
range of H.OuO yards.
Concerning tne I mure needs ot the navy
tho Hecreiury says:
"To regnin th relntivs position nraoni
these navies we occupied prior to our Civil
War is certainly not too nioch to attempt
especially ns we know now that we have
no such ellicient const deleuces ns we then
believed ourselves to possess. To reach this
(mint it is not disputed that we need more
first cluss bnttle shins. We have now onlv
three authorized. Kijjlit or nine more of
these, in addition lo our uuthoriss d fleet,
would Rive us a respectable navy, suHicient,
perhaps, for our put poses."
The need of more toprdo boats ia urped
and the tact that all the other nnviea of the
world are well supplied with this class of

THE MONETARY CONFERENCE.
An International Union to Regulata tht
Value of BUver.
Contrary to expectations, the special coro
mlttea of the International Monetary Con
ference on thj lioth-child and other plant
met again at Brussels and discussed tbe pro
posal of the Danish delegate Tietgen, wbo
propones to constitute an international
Union to fix the relative value of gold and
silver, based on the average price of silver
recorded in London, during the year pre
ceding the foundation of the Union.
A committee representing three or five
fitates is to watch the cours of the silver
market, and ihould the market fall 6 per
cent, below the rale previously fixed, ac
cording to th average in London for tin
previous three 5r six months, the commit
tee may summou Ihe conference to deckle
whether there ihould be a reeoiuage.
The proposal is tantamount to a general
titenslon of the Latin Union.

THE TREASURY REPORT.
An Inorease In the Oold Reserve Needed
A National quarantine Suggested.
Secretary of the Treasury Foster submit
ted his annual report to Congress, Wednes
day. His statement of the condition of ths
Treasury, with estimated revenues and ei
penditures for the years 1803-4 ar given it
the President's message.
Regarding a possible deficiency in the
Treasury, the report snys; "A careful review
of all the facts mllv Jiistilles the opinion
that the large incresse of receipts ascribed
to tlie msrvelous prosperity of th country
under the present revenue st stem would, if
continued, enable the department, during
the coming liscsl ynirtomeet nil obligations
without the slighest Impairment of its cash
and thereafter continue to show a mnleiial
improvement In its condition.'1
Secretary Foster recommends the nncondl
tlontl tepenl of the sinking liind laws as
' It is hordlv prob ible thnt more than nlmnt
ir.nuo.OUO can be credited to the fund during
the present lisc.il yew, ns against a legal re
ipilreniciit exeee ling t Is, no ,o and fuith -r
uppl cations to the fund du lug snecei'ding
years must necessarily ho limited to such
small sums ns may f rum time to time be
paid for past due bonds, fraciional cuirency
ami national bank imtes redeemed under
the net or .inly It, istw."
One of the embiirrnssmenls to the Treas
ury, in the opinion of the Secretary, is the
inability, wuh the limiied amount of cash
on hand nbovethe loo.msi.o.l i ieserve, to
keep up a mtlh ieut gold supply, "When the
demand couns Tor the expoi-ranou of gold,'
says he, "(he Treasury is culled Umiii id
furnish It. If this demand should prove to
be as large the coming yen ns it lins been
for the past two yenis, gold ill the 'Treasury
vonld be diminished to or below the re
serve line.
"If int.OJO.OOO in gold was a suitable or
necessary reserve in IXM and in 1HS., it
wi.uld seem clejr that n greater reserve Is
necessary now. it shou d be renioiuh red
that since ls e have added to our silver
circulation the stun of .'.ili.OIO. IHJ m stand

ver certllicates. We have al-o increased the
Ugal tender paper cirviilatlon by issuing
about H2i.floo.islO of the treasury notes,
author r.ed by the act of July 14. IH'1;) tnd to
this we are ailditu anout ft.ooo.is)) each
month in tin payment uf silver bullion
purchase!.
"it is true that silver cetilicates are not re
deemable in uo d, anil that the Treasury
notes of ISUuare ledeeinuhle in coin; but
since It has been declared to bu the estab
lished policy of l he l olled to maintain the
two metals. silver and gold, on a parity with
each other, it is obvious that this large nd
dllion to our cin-iilalion lias Incrensed the
possible cluirge upon our gold reserve.
"In view, then-lore, ot these incrensid
and increasing ihtbilit es. the ieserve in the
Treasury lor the redemniion ol the liovern
ment obligations should, in my opinion, be
increased o theexient of nt leist 20 per
cent. of tho amount of Treasury notes issued
and to be issued under tne Act of July 14,
ISIS).
"As general revision of our customs
laws is now prohnble, I do not feel like sug
gesting any special method for increasing
the revenii", tlioiiuh 1 should otherwi-e
think thnt an additional tux on whisky,
which could he collected without additional
uosf, would furnish an easy method "
The report recommeuils an increase In Ihe
head lax on imminrniiis and it is suggest, d
that the sum should be such us will eipinl
i.e. ut least approximately, the cost to the
immigrants to reach the countries of South
Aiiicnc and Australia, from which coun
tries the immigrants a e deflected to the
l imed States, on account, uf the expense
being less to them.
Notwithstanding the severity of the
laws relating lo the exclusion of Chinese,
many persons of that race, Necre'.uvy Foster
says. I'ukI their way into our territory, chief
Iv l y way ol Csnadn. 1,'llder the Chinese
Registration sot no single application has
so fur been received at the Treasury liepnrt
meut. On i lie subject of a nst'onal quarantine,
Ihe icport s.iys: ' F.very serious epidemic
that I Ids country has ever known has been
traced lo the immigrant, and it must he ap
parent that thesame authority that controls
immigration should control quarantine. All
quarantines must be equally etlicient to be
successful iu preventing tmpl.uita'ion ol
disea-e, and only the strong arm of the Gov
ernment directed under lews enacted by
representatives of Ilia whole people, can
give confidence and security."

The biggest bell that strike is in this

There ia nothing; extraordinary about
tho whistles. They ari nickel plated,
about three inches Ion;;, with acbaitt
attached to fasten them to tbe coat but

inside controls the tone, which in most
of them is not unlike those used by
cyclists.
The clubs are of crcnadilla wood and
13fc inches long, 1 inc'aus thick at the
outer end and tunerioe; to one inch, at
the handle.
Each policeman hud to pay eighty
