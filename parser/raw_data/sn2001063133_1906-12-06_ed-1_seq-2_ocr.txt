toasts to a very sudden close. She
arose and began: "Here's to the bride

of all was directed to a crowd of boys
who had quietly collected to charivari
and she remarked in surprise, "Oh

is said to have given a fervent amen

PRESIDENTS
MESSAGE.
The following is a synopsis of the pres
ident's message:
The president in opening says: "As -a
nation we still continue to enjoy a liter
ally unprecedented prosperity, and it is
probable that only reckless speculation
and disregard of legitimate business
npethods on the part of the business
World can materially mar this prosperity.
"No congress in our times has done
more good work of importance than the
present congress. There were saveral
matters left unfinished at your last ses
sion, however, which most earnestly
hope you will complete before your ad
journment"
The president again recommends a law
prohibiting all corporations from con
tributing to the campaign expenses of
any party.
The urgent necessity of enacting into
law the bill vhlch passed one house of
congress, conferring upon the government
the right of appeal in criminal cases on
questions of law, is1 strongly advocated.
The president cays: "A failure to pass it
will result in seriously hampering the
government in its effort to secure justice,
especially against wealthy individuals or
corporations who do wrong, and may also
prevent the government from obtaining
justice for wageworkers Who are not
themselves able effectively to contest a
case where the judgment of an inferior
court has been against them. I have
specifically in view a recent decision by
a district judge leaving railway employes
without remedy for violation of a certain
so-called labor statute.
"It seems an absurdity to permit a sin
gle district judge, against what may he
the Judgment of the immense majority of
hiS colleagues on the bench, to declare a
law solemnly enacted by the congress to
be 'unconstitutional' and then to deny to
the government the right to have the
supreme court definitely decide the ques
tion.
"The importance of enacting into law
the particular bill in question is further
increased by the fact that the govern
ment has now definitely begun a policy of
resorting to the criminal law .in those
trust and interstate commerce cases
where such a course offers a reasonable
chance of success. The action of the
government In finally deciding. In certain
cases, to undertake criminal proceedings
was justifiable, and, though there have
been some conspicuous failures in- these
cases, we have had many instances which
undoubtedly had a deterrent effect upon
evildoers, whether the penalty inflipted
was In the shape of fine or imprisonment,
and penalties of both kinds have already
been inflicted by the courts."
The president urges the passage of a
law which will stop the habit of setting
aside the judgments of inferior courts on
technicalities absolut«"'v unconnected rvlth
the merits of the case and whers there
is no attempt to show that there has been
any failure of substantial justice.
The abuse of the injunctive power in
labor cases should be guarded against,
according to the president, who urges the
passage of such a law as he advocated
last year.
He says: "There must be no hesitation
dealing with disorder. But there must
likewise be no such abuse of the injunc
tive power as is implied in forbidding'la
boring men to strive for their own better
ment in peaceful and lawful ways, nor
must the injunction be used merely to
aid some big cortcration in carrying out
schemes .for its own aggrandizement."
In connection with the delays of the'
law, the president calls attention to the
prevalence of crime and the epidemic of
lynching -and mob violence that springs
up, now in one part -of the country, now
In another. The greatest existing cause
of lynching is the perpetration, especially
by black men, of the hideous crime of
rape—the most abominable in all the cat
egory- of crimes even worse than murder.:
Mobs frequently avenge the commission
of this crime by themselves torturing to
death the man committing it, thus aveng
ing in bestial fashion a bestial deed and
reducing themselves to a level with the
criminal. "In my Judgment the crime of
rape should be punished wiu death, as is
the case with murder, and provision
should be made by which, the punishment
may follow immediately upon the heels
of the offense. Let justice be both sure
and swift, but let it be justice under the
law, and not the wild and crooked sav
agery of a mob."
In dealing with the question of labor
and capital the president says there is
one thing more Important to remember
titan aught else, aid that Is the infinite
harm done by preachers of mere discon
tent. These are the men who seek to
excite a'vlolfent class hatred against all
men ol wealth. They seek to turn wise
and proper movements for thehetter con
trol of corporations and foirdTWng away
with the abuses connect iwlth wealth
into a.campaign of .hysterical excitement
and falsehood,, in which the aim is to in
flame to madneps the brutal passions of
mankind.
"In reality they are the. worst enemies
of the cause they profess to advocate,
Just as the purveyors of sensational slan
der In newspaper or magazine are the
worst enemies of all men who are en
gaged in an honest effort to better what
a bad in our social and governmental
conditions.
"To preach hatred of the rich mas as
such, to carry on a campaign of slander
and"'
Thvectlve against' him, to seek to
mislead and inflame to madness honest
men' whose lives are hard and who have
not the.:kind of mental training which
will permit them to appreciate the dan
ger in doctrines preachcd—all Is to com
mit a crime against the. body politic and
to be false to-every worthy principle and
tradition of American national life.
"The man who debauches others In or
der to ohtaln high office stends on an
«vil equality of corruption with the man
who debauches others for financial profit,
and when hatred is sown the crop which
springs can only be evil."
The president again urges the passage
of a bill limiting the hours of labor of
railway employes. He says: "It should
be our aim steadily to'reduce the number
of hours of labor, wltl\ as 4 goal theigen
eral introduction of an elght-holir day."
On the Isthmus of Panama, he says,
the conditions are such that an eight
hpur day would be absurd, Just as It is
absurd, so far as- th#' isthmus in con^
cerned, whore white labor cannot be em
ployed, to bother as to whether the work
is done by alien black men or by alien
yellow men.
Afthorough-1nv«stlgation sof the condl*
tlon# of child kkfor and o( the labor of
women in the United' States is again
urged.
The president-recommend^ that the em
ployers' liability law be -amended to place
the entire "risk of trade" upon the em
ployer. ,.j.
The enactment:-of a k)*w'providing for
the compulsory investigation of contro
versies between employer and employe is
urged.
The president thinks, it.is not wise that
the nation should alienate Its remaining
coal lands. "I have withdrawn temporar
ily from settlement 'SlKtWe lands which
the geological survey has Indicated as
containing or in a» pw%bflity containing
coal. The' question, fjo^ever, Can be
from entry, save in certain especial oir
cumstnnces." .t* ...
On the subjects comcjitRtlons tWs pyfes^'!
Ident says: "The present congress has

enlarging the powers of the Interstate

larger and rpore. efficient control over the
railroads. in some irethod, whether by a
national, license law or In otner fashion,
we must exercise, and that at an early
date, a far more complete control than
at present over the::e great corporations
—a control that will tend to put a stop!
to the securing of inordinate profits by
favored individuals at the expense wheth
er of the general public, the stockholders
or the wageworkers.
"The best way to avert the very unde
sirable move for government ownership
of railways is to secure by .the govern
ment, on behalf of the people as a whole,
such adequate control and regulation of
the great interstate common carriers as
will do away with the evils which give
rise to the agitation against them.
"Combination of capital, like combina
tion of labor, Is a necessary element of
pur present industrial system. It is not
possible completely to prevent it, and, if
it were possible, such complete prevention
would do damage to the body politic.
What we need Is not vainly to try to pre
vent all combinations, but to secure such
rigorous and adequate control, and super
vision of the combinations as to prevent
their inuring the public."
The president urgently recommend^ tha
enactment (if a graduated Inheritance tax
and, If possible, a graduated income tax.
The man of great wealth owes a peculiar
obligation to the state and should arasume
his proper share of the burden of taxa
tion.
"The only other persons whose welfare
is
as
vital to the welfare of the whole
country as- is the welfare of the wage
workers are the-tillers of the soil, the
farmers. There Is no longer any failure
to realize that farming, at least in cer
tain branches, must become a technical
and scientific profession. This means
that there must be open to farmers the
chance for technical and scientific train
ing, not theoretical merely, but of th»
most severely practical type. The farmer
represents a peculiarly high type of
American citizenship, and he must have
the same chance to rise and develop as
other American citizens have.
t'While in the long run voluntary ef
fort will prove more efficacious than gov
ernment assistance, while the farmers
must prorparilv do most for themselves,
yet the government can also d° much.

PRESIDENT OF SOUTHERN RAIL­
WAY VICTIM OF SMASH 0N
HIS OWN ROAD.
TELEGRAPHER IS MISSING
RESPONSIBLE FOR DEATH OF
PRESIDENT SPENCER. AND
OTHERS.
Lynchburg, Va., Dec. 1#^- Samuel
Spencer, president of the Southern
Railway company and recognized as
one of the foremost men in the de
velopment of the Southern states, and
six other persons were killed and
eleven others injured yesterday morn
ing In a rear-end collision between two
fast passenger trains ten miles south
of Lynchburg. Philip Schuyler, a re
tired capitalist, of New York was
among the killed, together with other
guests of Mr. Spencer.
Asieep When Crash Came.
Only Mr. Spencer's private secre
tary, E. A. Merrill of,New York dty,
and one of three porters survived tha
accident.
The collision was between the
Jacksonville express and the Washing
ton & Southwestern vestibule limited,
both south-bound. President Spencer
and his entire party, as far as is
known, were sleeping when the colli
sion occurred, and the probabilities
are that a.ll of them excepting Dis
patcher Davis were killed instantly.
It is certain that life was extinct- be
fore the flames touched them.
Spencer's Body Burned.
President Spencer's body was burn
ed almost beyond recognition, as was
that of Mr. Fisher.
President Spencer's car was attach
sd to the rear of the Jacksonville train,
which was standing still when struck.
Blame Operator for Disaster.
Lynchburg, Va., Dec. 2. The oamee
Df the Southern railway wreck near
Lawver's depot Thursday, in which
President Samuel Spencer and his
party of prominent New York and Bal
timore men lost their lives, is laid ab
solutely at the door of C.,D. Mattoax,
the operator in charge of the block
telegraph station at Rangoon. Mat
toax, who disappeared after being re
lieved less than an hour after the acci
3ent, has not been found, despite the
strenuous efforts of railway detectives.
An official of the Southern railway
Rtated that the company was desirous
af apprehending Mattoax in order to
secure a statement from him that
might throw some light on the causes
that led him to allow two trains
the same block at the same time. i:
May Prosecute Operator.
This official was not prepared to
Bt&te whether or not the company
would take steps to prosecute the
missing operator, and he did not then
know if he could be prosecuted under"
Virginia laws.
Assistant Gei eral Superintendent
E. H. Coapman stated yesterday that
there is not the slightest doubt but
the' flagman made every possible effort
to protect the rear of the train, but
be could not get around a sharp curve
tn time to prevent the collision. As
loon as Engineer Kenny saw the sig
nal he applied the emergeincy brakes
rod stayed at his post till the last.
MERGER UNDER ANOTHER FORM.
Government Will Look Into Combina
tion of Hill's Roads.
Washington, Dec. 2. Once again
the Great Northern and Northern Par
cific railroad companies are under sus
picion by the government of violating
the anti-trust law.
Complaints have been received by
the interstate commerce co'mmiscion
that in spite of the decree of the su
preme court dissolving the Northern
Securities company, formed to destroy
competition between the railroad prop
erties named, they have renewed their
sombination under a different, foran,
and as a result constitute a monopoly
In restraint of trade and commerce.
There is reason to believe these com
plaints will be made the subject of
exhaustive investigation.
A large shipper, who is thoroughly
sognizant with the shipping conditions
on both the Great Northern ami
Northern Pacific, says that there is ne
Soubt. whatever that the two railroads
ict in thorough accord in fixing rates
upon freight. He stated that farmers
Id the region traversed by the roads,
time and time again, had experienced
delay, and even damage through the
Lbsence of competition. What wes
true of the farmers was also trae of
other producers and manufacturers.
Inconsequence of the lack qf com
petition, it has not-been neces&ry for
the two lines to "build as many Bpnrs
ts might otherwise hav6 been con
structed, with the result that -the de
velopment of the territory has been
retarded.
