From the New York Trilwnc.
The President's message Is no perfunc:ory
document. It is not merely official.
jut distinctly personal. It expresses Mr.
Roose\elt'8 views on every large topic of
lublic debate. His Interests are as broad
is the country, and everything which In:erests
him Interests him intensely. Tli?
message is more than a report: it bristles
ivith recommendations to Congress for
egislation. It is more than a mass of ,
egislative recommendations, it is full of
he discussion of subjects regarding
ivhich no legislative suggestions art
'ormulated. It is a message to Congress,

to prohibit all combinations, ffo.ij or

Combination of capital, like
combination of labor, he regards is a
necessary element of our industrial system;
it cannot be prevented, and. if possible.
its prevention would do damage to
the body politic.

Its recommendations. President Roosevelt'*
message to the second session of the Fiftyninth
Congress is the most ambitious state
paper of his career. He has not hesitated,
wherever he deemed it expedient, boldly t"
borrow democratic doctrine, and the kind
of democratic doctrine to which his partv
has been and is still opposed. His views
on limiting the hours of labor. more stringent
enforcement of the employers liability
ict, federal control of corporations, a ^
jraduated inheritance tax and a graduated
ncome tax. are merely reappearance, hi a
nodilied form, of views held and advocated "*
jy his political opponents long before his
on opinions were recognized as important
public utterances.
A Lecture-Message.

11 is always a lecture as well as a message
whijh Mr. Ko.-sevelt writes when lie
'thinks aloud," on such occasions. It in
lot a legislative program that he has In
nind, so much as a statement of personal
,'iews. This accounts for his hortatory tone,
lis longueurs, his reiteration of ideas with
A'tiich he has made us tolerably familiar.
Indeed, there is nanny a column or liii
nessage before which the reader does not
'eel like doffing his hat, in the manner of

Mr. Roosevelt has quite departed from

that "he shall from time to time

No Big Stick in It.
Yim the Philadelphia Iuqulrer.
There is no disturbing feature in it. Nowhere
does the so-called "Big Stick" ap>ear.
The President is for peace and thor>ughly
believes in arbitration, but he Is
:onvlneed that the way to maintain peace
s to be prepared for war, therefore he
vishes the navy kept up to the standard
tnd the army drilled Into effectiveness. He
loeu not touch upon the tariff, hence It
s taken for granted that for the present
here will be no efTort of a serious nature
o tear up the protection measure under
rhich business Interests are developing.
Has Said It Before.
'rom tilt Newark Newi.
The annual brief of the President, embodying
his convictions of public need. Is
luite as much an appeal to the nation as
o hte nation's Congress. As usual, this
ear It covers a great multiplicity of subects.
On many of these his views are only
teration. a process often necessary In
ropagating the truths of reform.

deals with questions of living and

Remarkable Document.
torn tbe Baltimore American.
The President's message la officially adrrssed
to the national Congress, but really
1 large degree, if not mainly, it la a mesace
direct to the American people. The
lesnage must be regarded as a remarkable
ocument. considered for Its ethical enunlatlons,
Its inculcation of high Ideals of
uty in statecraft and citixenahlp. and its
lslatency upon an unfailing obligation to
sarch out the righteousness of every Issue
lat comes up for solution.
