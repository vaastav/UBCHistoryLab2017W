Boon llo Here Ills
llcnlth In Had.
MKRLIN , Dec. 2. Since the demise of
1'rlnccss Bismarck the old chancellor lias be
come taciturn. Ho scarcely answers when
ho Is addressed by members of his family
or by his doctors. In politics he takes not
the slightest Interest.
When death had taken place nnd the
former man of blood and Iron hnd closed
the eyes of his life partner , and his daugh
ter. Countess Hnntzau , tried to console her
father , who wept bitterly , he answered :
"It Is an Irreparable- loss and has taken
all courage out of me. She Is gone and I
am sure I shall follow her before the bells
announce the birth of the new year. I have
always been convinced that I would die be
tween 1890 and the end of 1694 , but I never
could Imagine that I should bo left alone In
my last days by the woman to whom I owe
not only a most happy family life , but also
every success In my public life. "
When he set his eyes upon his deceased
wife , before the lid was put on the coffin , he
muttered , weeping :
"Soon , soon ! "
Then he followed with a firm step , sup
ported by his daughter , the Countess Kant
zau , the coffin to the Improvised mausoleum
Returning to his roomho took to his fas ;
chair , wept for a long time and fell asleep.
The only consolation that he finds Is li
the presence of his daughter. Caressing he
hand , he asked , mournfully :
"Mary , I hope you will stay with me nov
until I shall follow- your mother , and I hop
I will not trouble you vnry long. "
The old chancellor Is completely crushed
Ills children will , Indeed , remain with him
Dr. Chrysandcr , In- the absence of Dr
Schwcnnlngsr , Is constantly by his side , whll
Count Herbert Dlsmarck busies himself will
his father's correspondence and papers. Every
body fears and Is prepared for the worst
The prince's state of hsalth Is more alarmlni
than ever before.
Ills farewell to his wife's body was ex
tremely pathetic. After the funeral scrmoi
he laid his hand on the collln , manifestly en
dcavorlng to suppress his feelings , and thei
took a wlilto rose from a wreath on th
coffin and went out with deep emotion , whlcl
even his extraordinary will was not abl
to conceal.
The prlnde has received more than 2,00
messages of condolence.

civilians fired upon them from thei house

excited by finding the mutilated remains c
Japanese prisoners. Some of these prisonr

Japanese pillaged the whole town and kllle
almost every man. Very few women or chl !

More American Owned Slilpi Under Foreign
Fliig * than Under American.
WASHINGTON , Dec. 2. The annual re
port of the commissioner of navigation , Eu
gene F. Chamberlain , Is mainly an argument
for free ships , based on the maritime standIng -
Ing and policies of the United States nnd
other nations. He says that American enter
prise Is n century ahead of the law , for
Americans own more steamships forbidden
by the registry law to fly American colors
than they own steamships In foreign trade
under the stars and stripes , and that the
admission of such vessels to American
, registry Is desirable to advance our maritime
' rank. In thirty years only one American
steamship has visited Hamburg , the greatest
continental port , and last year only two sail
ing vessels entereel there. Every bushel of
grain which left New York last year for
Europe was carried under a foreign flag ; of
11,000 vessels passing the Suez canal in the
last three years only six have been Ameri
can. Every civilized nation but the United
States allows Its citizens the use of the , na
tional flag over vessels In foreign trade ,
wherever boughti having learned that other
wise they will buy vessels under foreign
Hags , charter such vessels or abandon navi
gation altogether to foreign vessel ; . The
report shows the extent to which Americans
have adopted these courses and the country1 ! '
consequent loss of maritime prestige and
profit. Other nations , according to the com
missioner , realize that from the freedom of
the seas a prohibitory registry law cannot
act as a protective tariff for ship building ,
so they have abandoned It. Those under
taking to promote ship building resort to
subsidies. Free registry and subsidies are
not conflicting propositions , one encouraging
navigation , the other ship building. The
report says only 3 per cent of the British
merchant marine receives any government
compensation , and that discriminating flag
taxes have been abandoned by maritime na
tions , .as they Invite retaliation , which nulli
fies any prospective benefits. Amendments
to the net tonnage and tonnage tax laws ,
the abolition of registry bonds and an ex
tension of the power of the secretary of the
treasury to mltlgato or remit penalties on
sailing vessels are recommended.

NEW YORK , Dec. 2. Among the passen
gers on the Cunard steamer Eutrurla , which
arrived here this morning , was John Hums ,
M. P. , the great socialist nnd labor leader of
lOiidon. A delegation from the labor , organ-
; atlons of New York City met him at Quar-
itlne. The delegation consisted of E. F.
IcSweeney , assistant commissioner of labor'
lantuel Compere , president of the American
'cderatlon ' of Labor ; Chris Evans , secretary
if that organization , and William O'Brien ,
10 walking delegate. Mr. Burns is nccom-
anled by two fellow members of Parliament
David Holmes , who represents the town of
urnley , In Lancashire , and who is president
if the Weavers' association and a delegate
o the conference of the Federation of Labor ;
ml John William Benn , member of the Lou-
on county council and M. P. for St.
eorge's , east. Mr. Bcnn Is deeply 'Inter-
istcd In temperance affairs.
"I cannot talk fairly cf American affairs , "
aid Mr. Burns to the Associated press , "for
t would take years for me to become familiar
iiiough with them to do so. I have been
atchlng the labor movement In America as
ilosely as I could Ircm a distance , and I
avc concluded there must be a little more
f the milk of human kindness Injected Into
abor affairs. If they are. to progress as I
ould like to see them progress. "
On the dock were gathered about 200 mem-
iers of the local labor unions"who cheered
oudly for "John Burns " asthe walked down
he gang plank. Then an Informal reception
va ? tendered him , and Mr. Dumar of Typo-
raphlcal union No. G made a brief speech
f welcome. In responding , Mr. Burns said
t was an agreeable coincidence that he , who
ad been so strongly Identified with the docks
11 England , should make his first speech in
America on a dock , with the rattle of trucks
ml the swash of the waters In his ears. The
arty proceeded on foot to the Colonnade
o'cl , along West street. On many of the
icrners were gathered groups of dock labor-
r * and cattle men , who cheered for Burns as
e approached , and many of them , who had
ome from London , greeted him with the
Id cry of the London dock strike , "How
re you , John , " to which Inquiry Mr. Burns
espomled by stopping and shaking hands
r\lth them. Later In the day Mr. Burns
ecelved a number of newspaper men and
alked for an hour. After relating how Mr.
lolmcs and ho had been selected by the
abor federation at Norwlck to represent that
ody In the American conference at Denver ,
IB said their duty was to convey the fellclta-
Ions of English labor to that of America. Ol
Ills own visit here he said he. came first tc
ibservo the conditions of the labor movement
n America , and In what respects It differs
rom that In England , and , second , as a mem-
bar of Parliament , to get a grasp of Amerl-
: an political affairs. The workings cf the
abor department under Carrel D. Wright
ivere of great Interest to him , and as a co-
councillor he hoped to have the opportunity
f Inspecting the various municipal depart
ments of the great cities of America , more
artlcularly of New York and Chicago. Bui
above all , he declared , It was for trades
unionism that he was to work. Ho believed
ultimately the principles of the trades union :
would be universally regarded as necjssarj
'or carrying out any movement for human
irogress.
Mr , Burns' attention was called to a re.
cently published statement that he had sale
American worklngmen were "no bettei
han African slaves. " "That statement , '
ho replied , "is a superstructure of mlscon-
structlon , base'd on a misunderstanding 01
what I said. " Then he explained that hi :
remarks had concerned the'condition of tin
Hungarians and Italians In the coke region
as depicted In our books , and which , If true
lie added , is a disgrace to any civilized coun
: ry on the face of the globe. Mr. Burns wil
leave New York en Wednesday , and' wll

Issued last week , was not held. It has de

leaked out the members of thut party In thi

power to keep his supporters away from tin
city yesterday. It Is said Kolb determine *
upon his Inauguration scheme without con
suiting any of his party leaders , and tha
It has unquestionably produced friction li
the ranks. The democratic leaders here be
lleve Kolb simply wants to put himself 01
record. They believe his scheme Is to sem
a message to the legislature demanding i
fair elecllon contest law. He will , as gov
ernor , give Warren S. Reese a certificate o
election as senator from Alabama , and wll
Issue similar certificates to the four or flvi

ANXIOUS FOR THE MESSAGE
Senators of All Parties Evince Much In
terest in the Document ,
FINANCE COMMITTEE TO MEET TUESDAY
Much Speculation Concerning Chairman
VoorhccV Intention > In railing
the Committee Together
So I'rompllj.
WASHINGTON , Dec. 2. The senate will
be called to order Monday at 12 o'clock noon ,
when the last session of the Fifty-third
: ongress will begin. The vice president Is
11 the city and will preside. The session
begin with a full calendar , the result
f committee action during the long session ,
ml It contains at least 200 Items , covering
wide range of matters. Nothing' ' has
ransplred to Indicate which of these 200
ucstlons win receive first attention , whether
hey will bo taken In their order or whether
ho calendar wilt be followed at all.
Much Interest Is felt among senators of
11 political beliefs In the president's mcs-
ago and In the recommendations which the
ccretary of the treasury will make on
nanclal questions. These will have much
o do In directing the course of the senate.
f there are recommendations for radical de-
artures on financial methods they arc sure
o lead to much speechmaklng early In the
esslon and later to form the basis of com-
litteo action.
Significance Is also attached to Senator
/oorhces' declaration that he will ask the
Inance committee to sit for Tuesday ,
'uesday Is the day for .the regular meeting
f this committee , but It does not ordl-
larlly meet so promptly after the assembllnn
f congress. Chairman Voorhecs declines
.0 state the object of the meeting of the com-
nlttco further than to say It Is to be held for
he purpose of permitting nn exchange of
flews among members. If the president's
messaco Is received Monday the executive
ecotnmcndatlons could of course bo taken
up , but as there had been no positive ns-
urance as to when the message would come
n when the meetlnc was decided upon It
ivould appear the chairman had other ol > -
ccts in view. It Is possible his purpose
may be to arrange a policy upon the supple
mental tariff bills. These bills have all
been reported by the committee , but It maybe
bo considered necessary to discuss them
'nrtlier before deciding upon a plan of nc-
lon. The democratic majority of the
finance committee Is on record In favor of
lie passage of the bills and It U not Im
probable the early action of the committee
s sought to frustrate any attempt to prevent
consideration. This Is not altogether sur
mise , for It Is known some of the so-called
conservative senators have odvltcd that a
general party conference be held after the
cnato convenes for the consideration of this
question. The experience of last session
shewed that whenever caucuses were held
ho conservatives carried their points. Hence
here Is reason for the prompt trctlon of the
'rlends ' of the supplementary bl3. \ .
There appears to be nothing outnlds ol
financial or tariff questions likely td excite
a ripple during the week , and It Is not cer-
ain that whatever may happen later In the
session there will be much In these Knee
, o disturb the general serenity of the senate
during the next few days. After the re
ceipt of the presldent'a-megsage , and when 11
gets down to business , the senate may take uj
the calendar In regular order , or It may proceed -
coed to consider out of order some of th (
more Important bills which have been re
ported , such as those for the admission ol
Arizona and New Mexico , or the bankruptcy ,
anti-option or Nicaragua bill. In any cvenl
he daily sessions of the week will bo short ,
with the probabilities strongly In favor of an
adjournment from Thursday until Monday ol
he week following.
lilTTEH AGAINST ADM IMS 1 \TION. .
Defeated Democratic Congressmen Likely
to ICxprest Thvlr I'neltiiK' *
WASHINGTON , Dec. 2. The second ses-
slon of the Fifty-third congress begins a
noon tomorrow. Ileyond the passing of thi
regular appropriation bills , It seems little It
the way of legislation will he accomplish ? !
at the short session , although several Im
portent propositions will doubtless be pressei
to the front. Among the members of tin
dominant party In the lions ? , over halt o
whom were defeated for re-election , there li
a great deal of bitter feeling against the ad
ministration for real or fancied grievances
It will bo the purpose of the democratic lead
ers to curb , as far as possible , the display o
resentment , but the republicans will span
no pains to provoke and goad their dffeatei
adversaries } nto letting loose their viols o
wrath. If the president outlines a nnancla
schema In his message tomorrow , as antic
Ipated , It will probably furnish the opponent :
of his banking and financial views their de
sired opportunity. In the course of the ses
slon It Is understood the Nicaragua cam
project will be brought prominently forward
At the opening of ths congress , however
routine matters will bo kept to the fore ti
stave oft as far as possible unpleasant refer
cnces to the election , which would prove die
tasteful to the majority , but this policy cai
bo only partially successful , as the latitude
allowed on debate on appropriation bills wll
throw the doors open to remarks on any sub
ject. Before the adjournment for the hell
days It will be necessary to pass an approprl
otlon to carry out the tariff bill provision
levying a tax on Incomes , the collection o
which begins January 1 , and while It will , n
doubt , meet with much opposition and lea
to a general review of the arguments aealns
such a tax , the general Impression Is tha
It will pass by a largo majority. The Im
peachment of Judge Ricks of the norlhen
district of Ohio will also furnish a dlverslo
by the holidays. If the Judiciary commute
which Investigated the charges should pre
sent a resolution of Impeachment and I
should carry the trial would occur In th
senate , the chief Justice presiding. Impeach
ment proceedings are rare and novel , an
this one , the first since the trial of Preslden
Johnson , would attract no little attentlor
Tomorrow , if a quorum Is present In th
house , as seems almost certain , after th
calling of the roll , nothing will be done prot
ably beyond ths > reading of the president'
message. No definite program has been at
ranged for the remainder of the week. Th
committee on appropriations , however , ha
two bills almost prepared , the pensions an
fortifications bills , and they will be rcporte
on Tuesday , so that work upon them can b
entered upon Wednesday.
NO CAUSK 1'OIt AI.AIOI.
Slate Department Thlntis There U No Dnn
Ker to Forclciion at I'akln ; .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 2. H 1s stated posl
lively at the Department of State that thor
ls no fresh reason for apprehension toucliln
the safety of American residents of Peking
and that United States Minister Uenby ha
not made any appeal to the department fo
protectlcn since his original dispatch een
some time ago and referred to at the tlm
In the Associated press dlupathccs , In whlc
ho stated that should the Japanese troops ai
tack Peking the safley of the foreign res
dents might be threatened , and It would b
well to uend a force of United States marine
to protect the legation. As is customary I
such cases , this dispatch was promptly coir
munlcated to the Navy department and flft
marines were ordered to be transferred froi
Iho other vessels of the American fleet to Jt
Monocacy at Tlen-Tsln , near by Peking. J
addition Admiral Carpenter was Instructed I
put himself In communication with Mlnlstc
Denby and to use his discretion to do ever ;
thing to Insure the safety of the America
residents , All of this took place eomo tin
ago , and since then Minister Denby hi
made no further njillctitlon for protectloi
Ho Is at liberty at any time to transfer his
legation to Tlen-Tbln , where It would be al
most under the guns of the Monocacy , and ,
In fact , ho was authorized to do this at n
very catly stage In the wn- , when the Chinese
showed symptoms of disaffection at the first
reverses sustained by their armies. The le
gation would certainly bo much safer at
T.'cn-Tsln ' than at Peking , as It Is impossible
for even the light draft Monocacy to navigate
the river up to Iho latter city at this season
of the year. But the 'fact that Minister Denby ,
although the means of communication was
open , has not recently asked for aid from the
government Is regarded as evidence that ho
feels no apprehension at present , and this
view Is supported by the cable advices from
Chefoo to the effect that , encouraged by the
prospect of a restoration cf peacJ , many of
the foreign residents at Peking who had
taken rcfugo at Tlen-Tsln were returning to
Peking.
CIVIL Sl-MlVlCi : KIM'OUT.
, nw HeliiR Hotter ICnforeed In the 1'ostolllco
Department.
WASHINGTON , Dec. 2. The eleventh on-
tial report of the United States Civil Serv-
co commission shows that from July 1 , 1S93 ,
o Juno 30 , 1894 , thcro were 4,372 appoint-
tents made In the classified service , an In-
reaso of eighty-three over the previous
ear. The number Is divided as follows ;
Department service , 385 ; railway mall eerv-
ce , US ; Indian service , ICG ; customs service ,
80 , and postal service , 2,823. The whole
umber of applicants examined for the five
ranches of the classified service was 37,379 ,
f whom 22,131 passed and 15,218 failed to
lass. The total number examined Is nn In-
reaso for the year of 12,541 , an Increase of
,123 In the number who passed , and 4,418
n the number who fal'cd. Figures for the
tfferent branches are : Dspartmental scrv-
ce , 3,523 examined , of whom 2.3CC passed ;
atlway mall service , 4,207 examined , 3,120
scd ; Indian service , 431 examined , 200
Kissed ; customs service , . 3,372 examined ,
1,012 passed ; and postal service , 23,777 ex-
inlncd , 14,313 passed. The report slates
hat every state lias received substan-
lally Its due share of appointments , any
departure from an exact apportionment being
: aused by the need occasionally of filling a
lace requiring high technical qualifications
, vlth the best qualified person without refer-
nco to his place of residence. The com-
nlttco c'alma that experience shows that all
tosltlons In the government service , with
iosslbly a few exceptions , can well be filled
inder the competitive system. About one-
lalf of all the employes of the classified serv
es are In the CIO classified postomccs.
The law , it Is said , Is now better observed
n the larger offices than ever before. The
ndlanapolls and Balttmoro olllces are cited
, s having been very badly managed from a
Ivll service standpoint , but are now con-
Idcred as well conducted as those of Bos
on and Chicago. Politics arc said to have
icen practically eliminated In making ap-
lolntments and removals In almost nil of
ho large postoMlces as well as In most
branches of the departmental service at
tVashlngton. There have been complaints
rom many of the smal'cr offices showing
hat a large number of removals have been
made for political reasons , although other
offenses , generally of a minor character , arc
alleged as the ground of d'smlssal. In
ome offices there have been practically clean
sweeps.
The law has been rigidly observed In the
allway mall service , and neither appoint
ments nor removals have been made for
political reasons. Gratifying progress 1s
reported In the administration of the civil
ervlce lavy In the Indian schooj servlcs. Ths
majority of 'appointees have been retained
and new appointments have been made with
out reference to political Considerations. ' * The
report states that from the terms of the law
politics should have nothing-to dowith 'con- '
.Inuance In or exit from the service , but thai
o some extent religious and political reason ;
will Influence dismissals until there Is a re
quirement of law or rule that not only shall
hereasons for dismissal tie made a mattei
of record and be made known to the per
son dismissed , but that an opportunity be
; lvcn for defense. The postmaster general
las Introduced a' practice In this lln In the
postal service which , so far as results arc
known , works well In the direction of secu
rity , stability and elficlency , and to the com
plete ellmlnatlcn of politics.
Concerning offensive partisanship the com-
; nlttes says : "The- rules against offensive
partisanship are usually osnstruet
strictly against the opponents ol
he party in power , and lenient ! }
against their adherents. Persons In th <
classified service , though unrestricted as tt
vote- and opinlns on political subjects , shouli
not take any active part In political manage
ment or political campaigns , and should hi
ilebarred from turning official positions te
the benefit of either political parly. "
After speaking of the conviction of Post
master-Lockos of Newark , O. , and of Interna
Revenue Collector Raney of Kentucky foi
making political assessments In the presl
dentlal campaign of 1892 , referenca Is madi
to the case of C. N , J. Taylor , recorder o
deeds fcr the District of Columbia , of whlcl
a report Is now In the hands of the presl
[ lent for action. Of this the commlttei
says : "In Investigating this case the com
mltlee was much struck by the condition o
terrorism that obtains In the unclassified clvl
service. In this service there Is no secu
rlty of tenure. Removals are made for purel ;
political and personal reasons , and there I
an amount of corruption In consequence. Ii
the unclassified civil service and In the ex
cepted places at Washington the condition
are as bad as ever. These evlU will bi
largely cured by the recent extension o
classification In the department service , "
The commission rcvelws the attempts mad
at assessment In the campaign of 1894 am
the opinion of the attorney general that sollc
Itatlon by letter In public olllces Is not solid
tatlon within the law , and after revelwlni
recent extensions cites the fact that ther
are few Important branches of the govern
ment service yet unclassified.

Omaha was proud yesterday that It had al >
vays been the friend of the Salvation army.
The city has entertained presidents , war-
lors and statesmen , but to ncne of three , '
4\ \
hough there might bo more pnqeantry anil
'cremony ' , did It show hlghc : honor or lestl.y

estcrday , a prophet , a preacher , n reformer ,
pl.ll nthioplst. who Is a sjH'o * only bccaugj
In must ba fought , who la a. general only be-
MUSO a contest against the Intangible powers
f darkness must have direction.
All of his meetings yesterday were attended ,
jy throngs , the largest by thousands and the
mallcst by a thousand. On the platforms
vcro clergymen from all denominations , ftir-
ilshlng an epitome of the audiences , Indls-
irlmlnato as to creed , sect , nationality and
: olor , but one apparently in a. desire to sco
ho world better , In satisfaction for the good
.vrought . by all Institutions and In the hops
hat Iho promising movement which General
IJcoth leads may accomplish the end sought.
General Booth has not what an known as
ho arts of speech , but ho stirs the multl-
udcs. Ills eloquence IB the eloquence of an
ntenso earnestness. He has force because h
ins feeling , and feeling because ho has
inowledge. Ho acts because he has sym
pathy , and has sympathy because he has
ecu. Ills fclth Is a lire.
FIRST VOLLEY FIRED.
The General Booth meetings were com
menced yesterday forenoon at 10:30 : o'clock
by a largo meeting at the Toting Mcn'a
liristlan association auditorium , every seat
being occupied. The audler.ee was largely
made up of members of the Salvation army ,
many toldlers from surrounding towns being
present. The band , with Its horns brightly
polished for the occasion , occupied seats on
ho platform , wliUo a choir of ten or fifteen.
Salvation girls f-aL Immediately back of the.
pulpit. At 10:30 : General Booth made his
appearance , accompanied by bis private sec
retary nnd Colonel Ha\\lcy of London. As
soon as the cominander-lr.-cliief of the Sal-
.vatIon army of the world appeared on the
platform the audience arose. Brigadier
French was In command and ho shouted :
"Now , let the Salvation army IIro a rous-
ng volley. "
"Amen ! Amen ! " shouted the army In
lanes that made the room ring.
Then Brigadier General French waved the
audlenc ? to Its seat and the Commander-in-
chief requested the singing of ono of the
ubllee hymns composed by Colonel Hawley ;
for his tour through this country. The
band struck up the air and the audlenco
sang with a will. After one. verse" and the
chorus had been Ming General Booth
walked over to where the band was playing
lustily and remarked :
"You play too much. One verse with
muslo and one without. One chorus with
the band and ono without. If I was out
there In the audlenco I would sing so loud
that they couldn't hoar the band. You
can help. Don't go BO fast , though. " ,
The singing was then returned , the band
following Instructions to the letter. After"
all the verses had been sung the army re
peated the chorus again and again , Colonel
Hawley displacing his chief at the pulpit and
urging the audience to renewed efforts. All
the time the general was walking back and
forth on the platform , swaying his body
backwards and forwards. The.scldlers . began
to clap their hands , an the Intensity of the
sons and the occasion grew upon them , The
chorus was repeated eight or ten times , and
then the commander said : "Let us all pray.
You don't know how to pray. Just close
your eyes and think. Think what you arc ,
and what your real character Is. "
Brigadier French' Joined In the exhortation
to pray , and Colonel Hawley lent the assist
ance of his entreaties. Ho knelt down and
commenced to sing a line or two of a song
"Give Me a Heart Like Thine" and asked
every member who believed to shout amen.
"Amen ! " "Amen ! " rang through Iho room
again and again.
General Booth then prayed , and he was
followed by Brigadier French and Colonel
Hawley. After another song had been
sung General Booth commenced his sermon.
It was more of an exhortation than a sermon ,
and was Interspersed with many pointed
stories , which aptly Illustrated his text. Ills
whole theme was an exhortation to slnnets
to repent and accept Christianity. The gen
eral speaks In an earnest , Impressive manner ,
although his voice sometimes sank so low
that It could scarcely be heard tweu'y feat
away from the rostrum. He was Interrupted
frequently by shouts of "Amen , " nnd "Halle
lujah , " and he finally asked ona sister to
keep quiet , as the noise affected his nerves.
At the conclusion of the tervlco converts
were asked to come forward , and after some
little- urging flva came and knelt at the
altar.
PARADE OF THE ARMY.
In the. afternoon the Salvation army had
a grand parade In honor of General Booth , At
1:30 : o'clock the soldiers of this army , headed
by their brass band , formed on Davenport
street In front of the hurrnnks and mnrched
south on Sixteenth street to Ilanity and then
traversed all of Iho down town streets.
General French had the parade In charge
nnd marched at the htad of the column.
Every few moments the command would bo
given to " ( Ire a volley , " and thu shouts of the
Salvation Koldlcrs would ring out plain and
clear on the crisp winter air.
Besides their usual regalia every soldier
wore a special badge of the order and tlio
women wore on their bonnctH u while rib
bon , on which was printed "Welcome to Our
General. "
Detachments of Salvationists from South
Omaha and Council Bluffs participated In the
parade , which was the same as ' .s given every
evening , except probably twice as many per
sons wo-o In line , At t'p ' corner of Fifteenth
and Douglas streets the Salvationists rallied
around their colors , fired a volley and held
a short open air meeting. From this corner
the procrsslon proceeded to Exposition hall ,
where the general was announced to speak.
OMAHA EXTENDS WKLCOMK.
The seating capacity of Exposition hall wa *
taxed to Its utmost to accommodate the audl
