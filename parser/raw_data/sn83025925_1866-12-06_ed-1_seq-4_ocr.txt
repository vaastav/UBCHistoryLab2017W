The Assassination ol Dr. Robinson iu
Salt Lake City
The recent terrible assassination of Dr. J.
K. Robinson, in Salt Lake City, has hardly
received that notice from the press which the
character of the man aud the circumstances
of his death deserved. That his 'murder
was planned and perpetrated by the Mor
monB, there is hardly the shadow of a doubt.
His position as a leading ''Gentile," the
Superintendent of a Coneregational Sabbath
School, and the husband of a lady who had
abjured Mormonism, marked him for de
struction. 01 course, the treacherous Mor
mon leaders profess ignorance of the perpo
trators of the horrible deed, and Brlghain
Young joins In offering a reward for their
captuie; but we take it that no man, who
knows anything of the utterly hypocritical
and abandoned character of those leaders, is
deceived by Buch shallow devices.
The circumstances of the assassination are
described in the following article, which we
clip from the Salt Lake Daily Union Vidctce
of the 24th of October:
TnK Mubdeb op Da. Robikson. Yesterday
morninp the city was again startled on the an
nouncement that another Lorrid. blood v assassina
tion and most brutal murder had been committed
in one ol the niost publfo Btreois, tho nigbt betore.
Dr. John Kine Kobiuson, a prominent and moat
est.mable cit.zcn, was slain within a half b ock of
bis ne dence, three doors trom Jndupondonce Hall.
1 he (acts, as nearly a-t wo have boon able to
patnor them Irom tiustworthr source, are briefly
thosr-. (jn Monday umtit, about tialt-pa-t 11 o'clock,
l)r. Robinson was roused iroin his slumbers by a
man who came to his residence and informed him
that John Jones (an acquaintance ol the Doctor),
liyinir on the State road, had. broken his le;r, and
requited surgical aid immediately, as, said tho un
known caller, "his ire's sma-hed al to thunder. "
The Doctor's young wile obji cted to bis troiu? out
so laU-, as threats had been made against hi- lite iu
anoujmous letter, in consequence of llio fact that
ho had, a short time since, instituted a suit aaiusc
the city lor the recovery of tho Warm Sulphur
Springs, o a mod by both the Doctor and t ie city
lie, l.owevor, hastily threw on bis clothing, and
i old ttio man to po ahead, and ho would shortly see
Mr. Jones The man replied no, lie would wait for
aud accompany hurt. Mrs. Kobiuson, howovor,
was uuab'e to prevail on her hmbaod to shirs: the
call ol humanity, and the murderer and Uis viotiin
I aH-d out into the nlht.
A ycry few nnnutcs after a shot was heard but
Sirs. Kobiuson and toe inmates of thu house did not
suspeot what H muant. Mr Charles limn, J.
Vninnier, and Coloi el Kahn wero sittinv in their
loom conversing, their housn beinir on the block
next east ol that on wlno i Dr Kobiuson resided.
At the hour named they heaid a piercing, wild
shriek, and immeaiatcly afterwards heard a pistol
shot, Star mg to their ject. thoy raided the window,
and, ilie moon beinir neany at its It'll and the nii'ht
alinos'.as bright as day, .hey saw three men runup the
e reet Irom the diroclion ol the corner ot Main aud
lh id Kouth 'treats, i bey passoa out luto the street
and towards tne corner Nothing was to bo soon,
and they weio about returning horn?, wain tua
thought surtrtstod ilso f that furt er search mtplit
d.eo oso something. Crossing ilainstreot wenwardly,
they found the body of a man pione on the eauli,
with a cut aoro-s the forehead and a pistol-ball
through the head others came up, aud as they
gazed upon the U; turn, d luce o the murdered in ui,
it was discovered to b Or Uooinson. Aluaou-rh
till breathing, he was iusonsihl , and was borne by
kind bands 10 lodoiioudcucrt .-la 1, a short distance
liotn tt.e sui no It ws nearly an hour alterwarUi
(hat it was deemed irudoit to alarm the iatnily.
Dr William 1 ait (tin lalo partner nt Dr. Hobin
Bon), bu ).ooii J. 11 V lliamson, and Dr. Audersou
weie soon summoned, but liunan aid was ot no
avail, aud the inur ered man breat .ed his last at
about 8 o'clock A U , in the presence of his iriends
and lioi roi'-i-trioken mmilv.
Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock Justice Clinton
held a coroner's mqiiest on the body, and au exami
nation was begun with a view to elio t any informa
tion tending to point out the murderers. Jutlire
Titt'S adjouri.ed the District Court, and the mem
bers ot the bar generally were present at Indepen
dence llail, whore tie inquest wat hold.
Major Blair, Prosecuting Attorney, appeared lor
the people, as-dsed by Major lleui;)stead, United
Slate Attotnoy, aud Hosea Stoat, Esq., City At
torney, Tbe loilowiiig veutre was returned as
jurors in the case: Jumo lownsead, James ilu'.'ue,
S. D. berrine, W. V. H.nry, J. B. Kimball, "and
C. M. Bairet. Major Uiair perompton y challenged
James Townsend, and Ae.sou Boukoisky was put
iu t ho, box in his stead.
Drs. 1 ait, Will amson, aud Port-Surjraoo Hamil
ton wore then eallod to the stand, and tejtiU jd that
deceased came to hi death by the wounds indicted.
The body, tfisclos'ng a most bonifying sijjut whon
exposed to view, was examined by the jury. Tnore
was one deep gash over the lelt forehead, two inohes
in length, produced by a heavy blow irom a
hatchet, bowie kuite, or other Bharp instrummt;
another on the back aud lett aide ol the hoad ; two
slabs under tbn teiteye, and a gunshot wound under
the lelt e , ranging upwards and passing through
the skull, distending the skin behind the right ear.
The posbmortom examination discovered the ball,
a large-sized slug, such as would come from a heavy
revolver or large Demngor pistol. The surgeon
testified that the gunshot won nd was necessarily
latal, and produced tbe death. Th elnquest was ad
journed till to-cay at 2 o'clock, at the City Uall.
We have no heart to comment on this bloody
diama. Aeood.au exemplary, a highly respected
citizen, has been most cruelly slam in the very heart
ol a city of 20.0(0 inhabitants, on a night almost as
bright as day, waylaid and butchered by three or
more, and the aasassius escape. -
It would be ti e sheerest hypocrisy to attempt to
diemttsoi that this outrage has not merely cast a
gloom, but a t hi til of horror, and a deep, outspokeu
feeling of distrust and iueeurity among the entire
so-called Gentl e part ot the community. When
such a man as Dr. iiobinnon, who is b-j icvod to
have bad no peisonal enemy in the country, can bo
coldly and murderously waylaid and shot down by
a band ot aw-assins, what citizen cau avoid tbe feel
ing that bis turn may come nextf 1'hese feelings
Ci d expression on every band, and a thousand
minors and suspicions are alloat, ansiug out ol the
circumstances of tnbi case.
We roliaiu from commenting furt 'aor at this time,
in the hope, feeble though it be, that tho invostlga
t on to-day may develop iacts rattier than suspicions.
The inquiry is on every tongue, If the civil authori
ties cannot p.vo protection to our citizens, and assas
sinating ol our best o tizens cannot ba punished, will
the Government stand id o until our streets ruu with
blood f A heavy load of responsibility tests some
where lor these repeated outrages, and this lat
crowning act ot in quity has stirred the sensibilities
and horror ol tbe tienti e commuuitv. Arc citizens
to be marked lor sau'ht r aud crime run riot in
our midst, without hopo, w thout retires? We cull
on the authorities in the name ot humanity and law,
to teirot out and punish the evil-d' ere.
The followlnsr extracts from a private let
ter from a citizen of Salt Lake City will
more fullv show the noble character of the
man thus basely murdered:
2" the Editor of 'J ha Evening TeUgraph i
Cheat Salt Lak City, October 80. For soma
months past tbe Mormons have bceu unuually bold
and meni cing. Many Gentl'es have taken up nnoo
cupled land belonging to tho Culled Butesin vari
ous paruoi the xerntory arounu nere, and their
housei have been toru down, and the? have be m
driven out with fire aud menaoes, and ordered to
leave the Territory. In smo Instanoes, thoy have
been maltreated and wounded.
The most atrocious of all these eases was te death
of Dr J. King Robinson a printed notice of whoe
assassination is herewith enoloaed. JPr. Robinson
cfuue to Camp Douglas eomewbat over two vean
age, as an Assistant Surgeon in tho army. Mot
having active pnblio business, bo miuiiod, about
one year ago, and rottlod here as prao Ising physl
dsn, baying soma months since married a young
lady, tbe daughter of a prominent Mormon, who
died two or three years ago whilst oro sing thft
rialns. Th's young lady, her mother, and sister
bad for several years abjured Mormonlm. Dr.
Robinson was about thirty years ot ags, of remark
able development and manly beauty. lie was
unusually learned and enthusiastlo in bis profes
sion, and a devout Christian, having aided vry
largely in establishing tho Congregational Churolt
here, under the Rev. Norman McLeod.
Uis lather, an O d School rrebytorian, resides at
his na ive place. Calais, i.aino. A younger brother,
and rrofessor in the Modioal fcchool in Sau Fran
cisco, is cxpeoled here to-night.
At tbe time of bis doath Dr Robinson was tho
Superintendent of the Gentile .Sunday School
lieie. In tbis ho engaged in Fobruary, 1803, with a
quiif tenacity which with him was a prominent
characteristic. This school nunibored over two
hundred pupils, many ot them the children ot
Mormons. 1 be blow wh'ch has laid low its young
cneberd will probably scatter bis litt'o human
flock for the present, if not iorevcr. Dr. Robinson
was ever ready to aid fullering in any form. Within
the past year he has rendered his professional ser
vices gratuitous'y hero to the value of many hun
dreds, in some cases to the latilllos of tho Mormon
leaders. This joung man Was ommentiy pious,
without the slightest cant) his roligion seomed liice
a very large inluHlon of goodness m o a character
reniarkab e lor its colossol proportions and minly
qualities Bis death has Leon ihreatoiicd in couoo
iteiice of a suit which he was prosecuting for the
Hot u phur Springs, a couple of miles from
the city. Ho personal pe'il, however, could
move him. Few deserved mora to live than
J King Koblnson. Fewer sti I, howovor,
could die with loss hazard than h). iiis
murden rs aio known, almost boyond tho shadow ot
a doub . At present, bonover, they niu-t go "un
wbippea oi justice." On Fiiday boforo his doath
(luce of tho police hero weioh?!d to stand their trials
or destiovmg his property. Motioo was given to
Unchain Young that he should be hold to bail to
keep tne peace, iu conequenoo ot h s inflammatory
h lnneues, which havo largely contributed to t'lis
murdei; these allidavits wora ia preparation at tho
(me.
Tbe country can illy afford to lose such a
man as this, and especially from such a place
as Salt Lake City. It is a matter of some
wonder that the Government has not long
ago stationed such a force in Utah as should
have afforded full and entire protection to its
citizens. It is only by so doing that an anti
Mormon element can be built up there su!U
clently strong to eventually settle the Mor
mon question without a resort to force. It
is worth while to Inquire, also, whether some
change ought not to be made in the organic
act of Utah, by which tha administration of
justice there shall not be left who'ly In Mor
mon hands. Of what avail is a Mormon jury
to try Mormons in any case where the ad
ministration of justice would conflict with
the interests or demands of their foul
hierarchy ? Who supposes that tho assassins
of Dr. liobinson will ever be punished?
Very likely some of them may be upon tho
very jury that sat over his remains.
Salt Lake City is growing very rapidly,
and is destined to be commercial point ot
great importance. The Government should
take instant measures to make its power felt
thcie for the protection of all citizens of the
United States who may choose to make that
point their home. If such terrible deeds as
this assassination of Dr. Robinson cannot bo
stopped in any other way, let martial law be
declared in Salt Lake, and the Government
administered by tho military until the anti
Mormon element is strong enough to protect
itself.
Tbe Need ot Congressional Dignity.
Cokgkfss has reassembled under the most
auspicious circumstances that ever attended
the opening of a session. When it adjourn 'd
bine die In July last, it did so with grave
doubts as to whether its course would meet
the approval of the people. When it now
meets, it has received a decided verdict in its
favor. Armed with far more than the neces
sary two-thirds, It has power to override all
the opposition of the Executive. It can
undo all he dues, and bind him hand and
foot, so that the President of the United
States can have no more power than Charles
Stuart with the Rump Parliament. Ihe
entire control of the machinery of govern
ment is placed absolutely m its hands. Mr.
Johnson is at its mercy. Standing thus fully
equipped, invulnerable at all points, let us
see what line of conduct is most consistent
with its power and its constituency.
We desire to see the House of Representa
tives of the United States act only in a man
ner which its own dignity demands. We
do not wish to see flippant and foolish reso
lutions introduced, or party insults thrown at
the President. So long as Andrew Johnson
fills the office of Chief Executive, so long
should he be treated by all officials with that
respect due to the head of a great nation .
We care not what may be his personal char
acter or political course, he is President of
the United States, and any Insult offered
to him by any servant of the people is an
insult to our whole nation. We know that
his conduct has been such as to place him
personally bej ond the bounds of endurance;
that l e insulted and maligned Congress. But
all this does not remove from him that.re
epect due to his oflice, and we earnestly hope
that no petty insult will be offered Mm.
It was with regiet thai, we saw Mr. Stevens
commence the session by moving that the
reading of the Message bo dispensed with.
Such a proceeding is without precedent in
the history of our land. It would, if adopted,
have placed Congress in almost the same
position as Mr. Johnson, when that officer
declared that the National Legislature was
only "so-called." The President discharged
a con&titutlonal duty in sending his Mes
sage to Congress; ana we are glad, for
the honor of the Ilouse, that Mr. Stevens'
motion was defeated. But other Instances
are not wanting to prove that the spirit of the
Ilouse is not exactly what its own self-re
spect demando. Tho resolution of Mr. Inger-
toll, asking the President if Congress was
mill "a bod on the veruc of the Government,"
was flippant, and utterly inconsistent with
legislative dignity.
We tremble when we think of the gigantic
power placed In the hands of the Republican
party. The history of all past political
organizations furnishes ua wl-h examples of a
party drunken with power and success being
slain by a far weaker adversary. The triumph
of the young Republican organization was
secured because of the confidence of its oppo
nents in their own tune-honored strength.
Careless of consequences, reckless in its
actions, because it deemed its foundations
sure, it acted boldly, and it fell, and great
was the fall of It. Ancient history teems
with similar incidents. Every kingdom of
barbaric times underwent tho same process
of growth, tho same security of power, the
same sudden decay. Belief in strength, nd
founding action on might rather than right,
is the usual precursor of a coming defeat.
Let us, then, as a party adopt the motto
of thesacrtd page, "Let him who thinketh
that he standeth, take heed lost he fall."
Congrets, as the representative of the people,
armed with the exercise of their will, has a
mighty responsibility. It may be a resistless
engine for good, or a potent instrument for
evil. Ilasty and crude legislation can do
more harm than an excess of sloth and indo
lence. 1 hero is no fear to-day but that the
Impetus given to the radicals will be suffi
cient to urge them forward quite rapidly
enough. While the last session continued,
we urged action, but now we feel assured
that, to use a homely simile, "It Is bettor for
safety to put down tho brakes rather
than put on an additional head
of steam." We are advancinz with
sufficient speed. What we want now is some
thing to act, as a ballast, and make the ship of
state ride flimly. The Senate will, we doubt
not, fulfil its legitimate functions, and restrain
the passions of the lower Ilouse. But, for its
own sake, we do not desire to see the Repre
sentatives continue to act in the manner
which the resolution quoted foreshadows.
We have the power, we have the will. We
can well afford to act with dignity, and, after
due deliberation, so decide as our consciences
and the good of our common country demand.
The Plan of Action for the Session.
The Republican members of the House of
Representatives held a caucus last evening,
at which a general plan of operations for the
6est.ion was agreed upon. 'Ihe following are
the measures proposed:
First. To pass a bi.l regulating tho organization
cl the House, directing the Clerk to plaoe no numfS
on the roll liom Slates not rcDrcsonted in thn urn.
cediue Congress or declared entit'od to re'siesenta
ucn, and providing that no electoral votes shall be
counted Irom any btate not reprosentod at tho lime
in Copgreti
second, lo pass a bill rcmidt inir tho detent in thn
hiw which may prevent anv stuto irom cnnvaln
the votes lor 1'resident and Vicc-Frcsidunt.
third. To pass a law changing the timo of the
meeting of every Congress, with a view 10 astern-
iourU. I o rnlro ,eoial oonmlltoa for thn riKld

Mxtn. 1110 commutes on religions to inquire
whether any pensioners in the d.s oyal Staies, struck
Irom tbe pension rolls, have been restored in viola
tion of law.
Seventh. A special committee to investigate the
facts connected with the release of tho murdoiers of
the IJ moil soldiers in South Carolina-, recently tet at
large bv tho Delaware iudgo
Mr. Raymond, of New York, was present,
and took part In the proceedings. His right
to do so being challenged on account of his
connection with the Philadelphia August
Convention, he asserted that he entered the
Convention to strengthen the Union party,
thinking it should be more conservative than
it was ; but when he found the Convention
likely to lead to the defeat of the Union
party, lie abandoned it, and had ever since
done his utmost to maintain and support the
Union party. He also said that he approved
of the measures reported to the caucus. It
will be seen that nothing is said of impeach
ment, though several of the topics to ,be in
vestigated are such as would naturally bo the
groundwork of such a movement
The Matamoras Affair.
It seems, after all, thai General Sedgwick did
occupy Matamoras on the 20th ultimo, on the
plea of protecting the lives and property of
the American residents. As this was what
General fcedgwlck had no right to do, and had
been ordered not to do, General bheridau
very properly removed him at once from
command.
The assurance evinced by an officer of
General Sedgwick's rank and calibre in tak
ing, on his own motion, a step which might
Involve the nation in grave difflculiies with
foreign powers, is remarkable. The United
t fates is competent to protect its own honor
and the rights of its citizens, without the un
authorized and rocklcss Intervention of its
subordinate military officers.
An IsirOBTANT Bill. The House of
Representatives yesterday passed a very im
portant bill, providing that where a citizen
of the United states who always remained
loyal thereto, and did not voluntarily give aid
or encouragement to persons engaged in re
bellion, shall bring an action to recover
damages for injury to person or property, or
the value thereof, no such action shall be
defeated, nor any dotense allowed, by virtue
of the authority of the late so-called Confede
rate States, or of any State declared la
rebellion.
