MARSHAL MACMAHON.
The Life and Character of "the
Modern Bayard."
HIS CIVIL AND MILITARY CAREER.
Paul*, Nov. 17, 1873.
Marie K. Patrice Maurice de MacMahon, Mar
quis of MacMahon and Duke of Magenta, who has
been entrusted with the task of governing the
most unruly people under heaven, is one of those
providential men who arise from time to time and
achieve Immense popularity, rather through the
?effbtencss of their contemporaries than owing to
any luBtre ol their own. He has never been an
ambitious man, ana he is not a great man, nor does
he think himself one. Not by any means the ablest
soldier In his country; devoid of political astute
ness, and, Indeed, disliking politics; a sluggish
thinker, chary of words, and, in public
oratory, untrained and simple, he has
jet, out of homely qualities which sprlghtlier
runners in the raco of liie despise, earned a share
of renown, public esteem and love such as (alls
to fow of those who ardently covet It. . Fortune
takes a humorous pleasure in thus petting those
who never seek her favors. If MacMahon were
asked to whut good hazards lie owed his rise he, of
all men, would be most puzzled to tell; out this is
the very reason why he has risen, lie is a man
who has all along done his duty to the best of his
might and unbraggingly. While others bnstled,
fussed and blew their own trumpets he obeyed
orders. But, somehow, tho work ho did was better
than other men's; so that those who employed him
not to feel that he conld ho relied on like a plain,
strong staff. Brave and obedient as a soldier, he
Waa in private life amiable, honest and trne. His
tongue never slandered, bis heart was not
envious; but whenever he could say or do a kind ?
thing he gladly dkl so; and it is by such gifts that
* man knits bbnseir to the affections of wife, chil
dren, iriends and depenaants in ties not to be bro
ken. MacMahon was rightly called by the Count of
Chambord "the Modem Bayard," for he is, like
Bayard, "sans peur et sans reprochp." The roll of
lite great deeds may De small, but the page that
would chronicle his unworthy acts is a blank. In
a word, it is not so much on account of the glow
ing things that can bo said in his favor tnat Mac
Mahon is pre-eminent; it is because there is abso
lutely nothing to say against him.
MACMAHON'3 HOYMOOO. *
He was born in 1808, of a lamily that had emi
grated from Ireland in 1680, after sacrificing all their
property to the cause of the Stuarts. Settled in Bur
gundy the MacMahons rebuilt their fortunes, lntor
tnarried with the French nobility and became, In
eourseof time, rich and influential landowners.
Maurice de MacMahon's great-grandfather was
Created Count by Louis XV., and his father, who
was the intimate friend of the Count d'Artois,
afterwards Charles X., was raised to the French
House of Peers hi 1817 by the title of Marquis.
This Marquis of MacMahon was in all points a
? nobleman of the old school. He abhorred liberals,
Protestants and Jews with an equal and pious hate;
he talked of the Revolution and its "rights of
man" only with contempt, and the sum and sub
?tanoe of his political opinions were to be always
royalist and Catholic, and nothing more, in
these views he educated his son, and he also
taught him to be a keen sportsman, lor, like bis
royal friend Charles, who split his time in un
equal parts between mass and the hunting field,
the Marquis of MacMahon loved nothing so well as
to chase wild boars and deer, refreshing himself
after his efforts with powerful stoops of that Bur
gundy vintage which cheers, strengthens and
paints the nose red. It is not orten that a French
boy is brought up amid field sports, for the Revoln
tion, by morselling all the lands of the no
bility, destroyed the great preserves and deer
forests. But the MacMahon estates had, fortunately,
escaned the common .lot. Young MacMahon
learned to ride before most other Freuch boys can
read, and to shoot long bcrore lie conld spell prop
erly. Yet was his education not neglected, for he
had a Jesuit tutor, and it luckily happened that
this priest bad few of the canning instincts for
whioh the Order of Jesus Is notorious, but was a
thorough Cnrtstian and gentleman. He did not
teach his pupil much mathematics or science, for
he knew little; but he grounded him fairly in
Latin, gave htm a smattering of history and F.ng
ltsti, and sent him to the military school of St. Cyr
at tho age of 17, neither more nor less learned
than most otner young noblemen of his time.
This was In the year 1825; Charles X.
had just ascended the tnrone, and the
Bourbon dynasty seemed so firmly established
that all who knew of tho warm friendship existing
between the Marqnls of MacMahon and the King
prophesied for the young Connt Maurice the most
brilliant destinies. It was felt tnat, whether the
boy worked or not, his career lay smooth and pros
perous before him; he would be given a commis
sion in the Royal Board, obtain a court sinecure,
be sent as diplomatic attache on some special mis
sion, and in due time succeed his father in the
Uouso of i'eers and probably be promoted to a
dukedom. However, the Count did work, and, to
the great, surprise of his companions, he passed the
final examination of St. Cyr, the seventeenth out
?of 150, and, betng thus classed among the first 20,
was qualified for a staff appointment.
m? RKTKRS TIIK AKMT.
He was then a straight, tall boy of 10, with wide
blue eyes, light-flaxen nalr and a demeanor some,
?what solemn and thoughtful. Little given to dis
sipation, he preferred riding and the manly sports
or his boyhood to the gambling, hard drinking and
frivolous gallantries In which most of his brother
offlcers indulged; but, on the other hand, he was a
noted and skilful duellist. This was one of tho
necessities of his position. An officer who went
much to court and had personal reasons for being
attached to tho King could not In those days
stand by indifferent whilst the toyal family were
assailed by liberal journalists and by Bona
partist officers, of Napoleon's old army
MacMahon made a point of attending
tho Vat 6 Vaiols. in -the street of that
name, which was then the headquarters of royalist
officers, and there duels were arranged almost
?very night as coolly as pigeon matches would be
In these our times. It was the custom for the
liberal papers to be placed in a heap on the. cen
tral table. At five o'clock officers dropped in, and
at six, when the room was fnU, the papers would
be read aloud, and If one of them contained any.
thing offensive to the King the officers drew lots
among them as to who should go aud challenge
?m editor, rronortant journals were then generally
provided with a responsible Ugh ting editor, whose
sole mission it was to accept challenges.
He was generally an old half-pay officer
or sergeant, and now and then It hap
pened that he could not even read. JUae
Mahon ionght seven of these gentlemen in
the course of live years, and It is on record that he
was never once wounded, nor did lie ever kill his
man. He was singularly expert in the art of
pinking bis adversary In the fleshy part of the right
arm, just above the elbow, Inflicting a wound that
was uot dangerous, but which obliged his adver
sary to drop his foil like a hot coal, and to keep his
arm in a sling for six weeks. This thrust got to
be known as 41La botte MacMaJion," und It earned
the young officer many encomiums, ior which he
little cared, being in his heart averse to duel
ling. In 1823, being then 21, he was promoted to a
lieutenancy, and In 1830 he was sent at his own
request to take part in tne expedition against
the Dey of Algiers. This expedition was short and
brilliant, and Lieutenant MacMahon much distin
guished himself In it by hiB coolness nnder Are and
by his steady zeal. But just after Algiers had
lalien the news arrived that the revolution of July
had taken place, and that Charles X. had been de"
throned and driven into exile. This was a heavy
blow to the MacMahons, and If the young Count
Maurice had been but a mere carpet soldier his
prospects of advancement would then have ended.
As it was,

by refusing to swear the oath of allegiance to the
new King, Louis Philippe. He advised his son,
however, to remain in the army, and Maurice did
so. lie disliked the new regime, and ohortshed an
ardent hope that it would soon collapse, being well
resolved in such an event to lend bis sword in re
storing him whom he conceived to be the only
rigtitrul sovereign of France. But meanwhile ho
voluuteered for active service wherever it was
to be found, his object being to keep aloof lrom the
court, in 1832 he accompanied the French army
to the siege of Antwerp as aide-do-camp to General
Achard, and obtained his captaincy. In the follow
ing year he Bet off for Algiors again, and battled
unceasingly against the Arabs till 1837, when he
wan wounded at the siege of Constantlnc and
decorated with the Legion of Honor. By that time
his renutation for quiet, unobtrusive bravory was
so well established that an offer was made him of
a post at court with the rank of King's aide-de
camp ; but de declined it, and, after three years'
more tough and wearisome campaigning, he ex
changed bis place on the staff for the rank of major
in a line regiment, and In 1842 exchanged again
into the Foreign 1-egion, with a lieutenant colonel's
epaulet. Thrown very much by the ohances of
camp life into the society of the Orleans princes,
MacMahou grew to like them, and in 1343 he so
lar relaxed his hostility to Louis Philippe as to re
turn to France as Colonel of tue Forty-first foot and
to swear the oath of fealty which was then required
of all officers in command of regiments. Matters
had much changed since MacMahou had last been
quartered on French soil. In 1846 Louis Philippe
looked as securely seated on nis throne as Charles
X. did In 1826, and the gallant Marquis (for his
father had recently died) was given to understand
that if he would onlj show himself at court he
might hope iu the course of a few years to take his
scat In the House of Lite-Peers which had suc
ceeded the old hereditary Chamber. But Mac
Mahou's loyalty did not go the length
of seeking political honors. He accepted
military promotion because rewards of this sort re
quired no formal surrender of his private opinions,
the oath he had sworn pledging him simply not
to bear arma against the King. He was still a le
gitimist, however, and when Louis Philippe fell, in
1848, be was sincerely pleased, though he sympa
thized with the Orleans princes, and wrote to the
Duke of Aamale a frank and manly letter of con
dolence.
THk NEW UBPl'BLIC AT ONCK PROMOTED MACMAHON
to major general's rank. He was too efficient and
honorable an officer to be passed over, and the
republican government had hoped to win him over
to their side; bnt in this they were mistaken. Mac
Mahon promised to obey the established govern,
ment of his country, whatever It should tie; but his
dislike for republicanism was too deep-rooted to
be plucked ont by honors, however flattering, and
nntil the cot/p a\'ta( or 1861 he lived In the daily
hope that Henri V. would enter France, be ac
claimed by the National Assembly and resume the
reins of power which bad fallen from his grand
father's hands in 1830. The restoration or the
Second Empire seemed to him to cut down all such
hopes forever, and accordingly the Marquis of
MacMahon gave In his sincere allegiance to Napo
leon III., and was recompensed with the grade of
lieutenant general. Comparatively yonng at this
date, being only 42. rich, well born and much liked
by his brother officers, the Marquis of MacMahon
was jast. such a soldier as the Emperor liked to
have about him. He well knew that Mao
Mahon served the Empire rather from ne
cessity than from love; rather because he deemed
it the only rorm of government possible than be
cause the name of Napoleon had any great attrac
tions for him; but the Emperor did not dlalike
legitimists. A splendid marriage which General
Mac>lahon made in 1863 with the daughter or the
royalist Duke de Castries further won him the
good opinions of the Emperor, and the Empress
Eugf nle laid herself out to be especially gracious
to the young Marchioness whenever the occasion
offered itseir. As for MacMahon himself, the Em
press liked him from the first, and one day said
aloud at court, "lie has the eyes of an honest man.
and will never betray a trust."
MACMAHON IN THK CRIMHA AND ITALY.
But the war with Russia was hurrying on apace,
and before his honeymoon year was over General
MacMahon was sent, to the Crimea. In command
of a division at the battles of Alma and Inkermann
he behaved with his usual oool Intrepidity, and
when Marshal Canrobort was recalled from beiore
Sebastopol, owing to a lew rash blunders he had
committed. MacMahon was appointed next In com
mand to General Bosquet, who superseded Can
robert; and to him fell the onerous duty of leading
the assault against the formidable Malakotf fort,
which was the principal key to the Russian
position. For sucn work MacMahon was admi
rably fitted. Not Imaginative enough for a
strategist, he was perfectly at home when ever u
became a question of carrying some fixed position
by sheer dint of bravery and patience. When
Sebastopol fell and peace was declared General
MacMahon was appointed a Grand Grose of the
Legion or Honor, and received the Grand Cross of
the Rath from Qneen Victoria. In i860 he was far
ther raised to tha imperial Senate, a dUUaoUon
MV/A1 JL/ -
wnicn carried with it a salary or $0,000 a year.
Two years alter this MacMabon distinguished him
self by an act or political honesty which well-nigh
wrecked all bis future prospects, and whloh the
Emperor never wholly forgave. After the attempt
of Orslni 0:1 Napoleon's Lite in 1858 a Draconian bill
was introduced in the senate, providing for the
arbitrary arrest and transportation without judg
ment or suspected persons. MacMabon conceived
this bill to be iniquitous, and he voted against it,
though he was the only Senator who had the patri
otic courage to do so. Being told that the Em
peror was seriously displeased with him, he an
swered nobly, "I am sorry, then, for the Em
peror;" and this reply being reported at the Tul
lerles, Napoleon frowned from that day on Mac
Muhon, and for the next twcivemouth never spoke
to him at court. In L860, however, the Italian war
broke out, and the clever movement by wblch
General MacMahon saved the French army at Ma
genta obliged the Emperor to give him a conspicu
ous reward. There is no doubt that If MacMahon had
not taken it upon himself to come without orders
to the rescue of the Imperial Guards, whom Na
poleon had imprudently jeopardized by pitting
them against a hostile force ihree times superior
to them, the French army would have sustained a
crushmg defeat and probably the Empire Itself
would have collapsed. MacMahon was created
Field Marshal and Dnke or Magenta; but It was
well said at the time that it was not tho Emperor
who bestowed these distinctions; they were con
ferred on tho conquering General by the uuaul
moos clamor of the French army. *
MACMAHON DISTKUSTKD BY TUB KMPKKOK.
It- is no secret that after the Italian war
Napoleon began to look upon MacMahon with
mistrust. The Marshal was too popular and too
independent to please a sovereign who expected
all bis servants to be absolutely submissive. Be
sides, the Emperor had a weakness, wluch was to
consider himself an able general, like his uucie,
and MacMahon's ascendency over the army was
a matter ol constant irritation and jealousy to
him. He refused even to appoint MacMahon War
Minister or to give him a command of troops in
or near Pans; and in 1864 he sent him
In virtual exile to Algeria as Governor General.
There MacMahon remained till the outbreak of tne
Prussian war, in 1870, governing the troublesome
colony strictly and yet kindly; and there he
might have ended his days If the Empire had sur
vived. However, the Empire started In 1870 on its
road to ruin, and MacMahon was among the
most active though unfortunate of its latter
day defenders. OI Sus defeat at Worth, Mont
mfSdy, Beaumont, Douzy, Bazeillcs, and, lastly, at
Sedan, It is needless to speak. MacMahon
was everywhere overmatched, and the evidence
elicited at the Bazalne trial proves that the meas
ures he himself took for the salety of his army
were always overridden by the Emperor. No
Frenchman lays on MacMahon's shoulders the re
sponsibility of his defeats. Ue Is called "L'teroUiHM
vaincu for It is known that be went into battle
as a victim, and that be did bis best against insu
perable odds. MacMahon's defeat of the Com
mune pat the crown to his prestige with the army,
and he is now reaping tne rrulta of a career which
has been stainless from the flrst. He is justly re
garded as a man who loves his country with a
devoted affection, and has served her through sun
shine and sorrow, nobly, heartily and disinter
estedly.

TUB PROTOCOL
agreed upon yesterday by the Spanish Minister and
Secretary Pish will be referred to at length, and
attentlou called to the diplomatic correspondence
which has taken place between Spain and the
United States during the past year. It is not gen
erally known that one of the last acts of the Forty
second Congress was to request the President to
transmit a resolution to the American Minister at
Madrid, with instructions to present tho same to
the Spanish government?a joint resolution that,
in the name and behalf of the American people,
the congratulations of Congress are tendered to
the people of Spain upon their efforts to consoli
date the principles of universal liberty in a repub
lican form of government. This has been done,
and the President will allude to the manner in
which it was received by the Spanish government.
The publication of
TUB POINTS OK TIIB PROTOCOL
by the government has scarcely excited any inter
est in Washington. Those who have given it any
consideration express the opinion that it will be
snbsantially a victory for Spain, if she can show
that the Virginius had denationalized herself and
had no right to carry the American flag, lhe State
Department has become satisiied that the only
offence committed by the Virginius was that of
smuggling, ana the harshest words the Spanish
government was entitled to pronounce against her
was that she was a smuggler. That is
not an offence against the neutrality laws
or any other laws of this coantry. The Vtrgiaius
ran the risk of being captnred as such in Spanish
waters, but beyond Spaiu's jurisdiction she was not
subject to search or detention. If, however, tho
Spanish government can prove that
THE VIRGINIA'S POKKBITID HER RIGHT
to the protection of the flag by violation of our
Kcgistry taws, in any way whatever, then she will
have the satisfaction ot knowing that our govern
ment has protected with the navy a
denationalized vessel aud will proudly
flaunt the fact to the civilized world that many
months ago she asked the United States to investi
gate the character of the vessel and examine the
proof which was then in her possession in support
of the fact that the vessel had no claim whatever
upon the United States. Of her ability to do this the
SpsntBh Minister sars there is no doubt, and had it
been attended to long ago the United States would
have avoided the expenditure of millions of dol
lars and his govcrnmeut would have been spared a
most serions strain upon her effort to firmly estab
lish a republican form of government.
SPAIN GKNKROUSI.T ADMITS THAT THE SEIZURE OF
THE VENSBL WAS NOT LEGAL,
but will plead in extenuation of the act the preser
vation of her jurisdiction in the Island of Cuba
and the nnwillingness of the United States govern
ment to apprehend the vessel ;or abusing onr flag.
There is no pretence that there was a blockade,
or sny acknowledgment of an armed rebellion
beyond the Spanish government, but it will be
shown that the Virginius was
BOUGHT BT THE CUBAN JUNTA
through John F. Patterson in New York for the
very purpose she has been engaged In since she
left that port, and that he was only her
nominal owner, the real owners being the
Cubans themselves; that she has been othcered
by foreigners, cleared nnder the Cuban flag
from a Venezuelan port, and has, <n numer
ous instances, forfeited all right to carry
the Amertpan flag; that it was not until
the United .states government, throagh its official
representative, seemingly winked at the service
the Virginius was giving to the insurrection; that
she was Judicially condemned as a pirate, not law
lully entitled to the protection or any government,
and the officers of the Spanish navy ordered to ap
prehend her wherever lound.
The Spanish government will not defend

except on that ground, gad the commanding

will assert in self-defence that thpy only obeyed the

asserted by the casino Kspaflol, and our govern
ment has luiiy anticipated opposition from the
ilavanese. Whatever Spain may hereafter prove,
the President wilt insist on the Immediate delivery

the President extend the tune on account of
any protests on the part of the colonial
authorities. Our relations are .with Madrid, not
Havana and the Virginius. Though her record is
worse than that of the Alabama, though she has a
thousand times forfeited her protection to the
American flag, the President In a determined man
ner says, if she has violated our laws, she shall be
adjudged guilty by the government whose laws she

What the President Will Say in His
Message About Cuba.
Washington, Nov. 30, 1873.
It Is understood that the President's Message, in
dealing with the case ol the Virginlus and other
bending questions growing out of the Cuban re
bellion, will accord nigh praise to the government
oi President Castelar for a sincerity of intention
and readiness to fulfil obligations and promises to
the United States that uas found no parallel in any
of the preceding Cabinets at Madrid.
TOI.EKANT TOWARDS CASTKI.AIt.
The question as to whether the Spanish govern
ment will be able to carry oat the several engage
ments into which it has entereil lor the release of
the embargoed estates, the suircnder of the Vir
ginius aud the extinction or slavery in Cuba the
President is not expected to discuss directly
or at length, the policy of our gov
ernment being manifestly to avoid adding
a feather's weight to the embarrassments
of Casielar in carrying into force projects
and engagements which in part are as much mat
ters of self-conviction with the present Spauish
rulers as pledges exacted by our own government.
In the words ol' a distinguished Senator, high in
the coniidenco oi the administration, "Having
carried our main points our proucr course
now is to be patient, quiet and tirm;"
and from the same source the opinion
comes that if we are to intervene actively
iu Cuba it will be uiore to onr interest, and cer
tainly more to onr honor, to appear there as the
suppartors, or, at least, the respecters, of
Castelar's government and authority than as
enemies thereof, even in a justifiable cause, as the
gravest doubts are still entertained by onr govern
ment of the ability of the present government of
Spain to execute its engagements with the I nited
States.
STILL WARLIKK.
The situation is still warlike, if the term can be
applied tc the probable necessity of making a hos
tile demonstration against the government of the
Casino Kspaflol to compel obedience to orders
irom Madrid and observance of the rights of our
own government and citizens; but if Castelar
maintains himself at Madrid it is uot ex
pected by the State Department that there
will be insuperable diillculty in the way
of onr disciplining the insubordinate Spauish ele
ment in Cuba without rupture of peaceable rela
tions with the borne government, or breach of the
neutrality, so far preserved by our government,
between Spain and her insurgeut colonists. Now,
however, that the whole question is opened up by
the late outrage upon our flag in the ease
of the Virginius, your correspondent is as
sured that It is the President's determination
tnat there shall be no final settlement which
does not insure the end of a barbarous war, which
lias long since exhausted the patience of the gov
ernment and people of this country?the eradica
tion of slavery rrom the island of Cuba, and the es
tablishment of fair commercial relations between
the United States and the Spanish West Indies.
CONSEQUENCES.
When these points are gained it becomes, in the
view of the administration, a secondary question
altogether where or by whom the sovereignty of
the islands is exercised, as the loss of the slave
labor and the monopoly of commerce would leave
.Spain nothing bat the barren honor of possession.
It is shrewdly intimated that Cuban Independence
and ultimate annexation to the United States
might reasonably be expected to follow in due j
time and without violence or entangling alliance
between ourselves and tbe partisans of free Cuba.
A FIRST AND VITAL POINT OP SETTLEMENT.
Nothing is better known here than the fact that
the President regards the utter extinction of
slavery in Cuba as tbe fundamental question to be
decided between ourselves and the Casino
Espafiol, and though the government of Castelar
will not be unduly pushed to extremities
on ? this point if it develops sufficient
sustaining power in dealing with the other ques
tions at issue, its overthrow will, beyond question,
be the signal to our government to take up an at
titude of compulsion, and to end at once and for
ever, the long catalogue of crimes and injnnes
against American interests and humanity itself.
LONDON PRESS OPINION.
TELEGRAM TO THE HEW YORK HERALD.
The "Dally Telegraph" Considers that
Peace Depends Cpon the President's
Message.
London, Dec. 1?6 A. M.
The Daily Telegraph Bays it would be premature
to regard tbe Virginias diillcatty as approaching a
termination until the actual language used by
President Grant on the subject In his Message to
Congress is known.
THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH.
Views of the Rer. Dr. Tyng, Jr., on the
Schismatic Movement of Bishop Cum
mins and His Supporters.
Yesterday evening, In the Ctmrch of the Holy
Trinity, Rev. Dr. Tyng, Jr., discoursed to a large
congregation on the subject now most mooted
In the Episcopal Cbnrch?"In What Direction
la the Revolution in the Protestant Episcopal
Cturch Tending?" He took his text from the
twenty-eighth chapter of Acts, fourteenth verse?
"Where we found brethren and were desired
to tarry with them seven days, and so we went
toward Rome." The reverend Dootor described
St. Paul's journey to Rome and his tarrying at Pu
tlolt. which thing, he said, was a parable. Pntioll
exists less to-day In the ruins which mark Its
ancient site than in the journeys of mind which
prisoners of snperstitton make towards Rome. It
Is the very tvpe of that midway delusion In which
certain brethren tarry and to which they Invite our
submission. It has charms and attractions which
cannot be scorned. It may lor a lifetime satisfy
some dreamy souls; but he that Is thorough
and positive in temperament and pumose
soon tires of Its unreality. Though it be in chains,
yet, with all sincerity of conviction and conscience,
he seeks his final residence and rest in Rome it
self. And that whioh Is true or one may be tbe
record of a company. How large that proportion
ot onr own household of laltti may be who have
taken refnge in Puttolt on their way to Rome Is
the question we have before us to-night.
Last Sunday evening I asked the question-"Tlas
the Protestant Episcopal Cbarch beeu revolu
tionized?" and I suggested some facts and quota
tions as tendlug to prove the affirmative. These It
is Impossible to review now at any length. The
principle of that revolution I stated in Chilling
worth's law, that he who would usurp absolute
power over any people need not abrogate or dis
annul the laws made to maintain the common
liberty. If he can get the power and authority
to luterpret them a* he pleases ami add
to them what he pleases and to have his
Interpretations and additions stand tor laws; ir
110 can rule his people bv Ins laws and his laws oy
his lawyers, that will be sufficient. I ad put, said
Dr. Tyng, that the text or the Hook of Pomtnoa
Prayer and the Thirty-nine Articles is unchanged,
and yet I maintain that bv the J?? J?"
position of a new Interpretation of both that tnat
which would not in a constitutional manner have
bean accomplished without sundering tins OhurcU
has been with craft ua suotiety successfully i*
compllslied.
Dr. Trot farther reviewed hie discourse of ttn
Sunday previous, and then wont on by numerous
references to works published in England audi
tnu country by advanced churchmen to show that
tne direction in which the Protestant Kplscopat
church of the present day Is tending Is absolutely
to Roue.
The question, he said, was not one of the past
but of the present and of the future. These revo
lutionists are inconsistent In their state*
ments; some denying affinity with Po
pery, others seeking union with the Western
Church. Whatever their differences D Is apparent
to all critical observers that they are working to
wards Rome. Their talk about "a catholicity" i?
a fiction which hus no living reality. In support
of this statcsent Dr. Tyngquoted from the London
Q'larterty Review, from the work of Her. Dr. Mx,
a sermon by Dr. Ewer and other authorities in tiiw
High church and ritualistic parties, comparing Dr*
lhx'a oatechmni with the Catechism of the Churein
of Rome, ami quoting irom a work entitled "Ritual
of the Altar.'"
in conclusion he stated that every man who
holds in any sense the fact of virtue ol apostolical
succession is a fair subject ror the Church of Rome*
He will he moved more and more towards it. Tba
ceremonial usages, sacramental laugnage, sub*
mission and obedience now dominant in thai
Church, aro evidences that the revolution isano
cessful. There is no reason why, by the ex*
pulsion oi a very few noisy Protestants.,
the position should not be taken of going bodily
over to Rome. "Is there," he asked, "any hope ofi
relormaUuuv" it by that was meant the ascend
ancy or l.vangeiical views he would answer none..
Every memorial made by the evangelical party tw
the Uouse ol BlshopB and general conventions hadU
been treated with contempt, still, whatever but
the circumstances, it would be craven tu evangeli
cal men to give up. They must stand their ground!
and maintain a warm sympathy with all who ar?
compelled to go out. Ho spoke 01 Bishop Cumuunw
as being perlectly Justified In seceding, and had no?
hesitation in Baying tuat if the action oi six oi thw
bishops, which was indicated in yesterday's paper.)
be consummated. It would be the most infamous!
act that has ever been perpetrated in anv Cliurcnt
called by the name of Jesus Christ. The assump-t
tion of sucn power by six bishops In the lace off
written law?and that a law about which there ia<
no doubt in the Church?to depose Bishop Cum
mins would he a most monstrous assumption of
power, a culmination of a plan on the part of the
bishops which would demand such a protest aa
perhaps might stop this course of things from any
further and more dangerous developments.
