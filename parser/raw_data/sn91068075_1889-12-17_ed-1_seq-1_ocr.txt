Proposing a Reward of ls.000
for tbe Arrest of Silcott.
Washington, Decemlier 16. SENATE.
The house joint resolution lor printing
the agricultural report lor 1889 was
passed with amendments, fixing the
number of copies at 400,000, and appro
priating $200,000 for the expense.
Mr. Piatt offered resolutions making
changes and additions in the personnelot
committees agreed to in the caucus, and
which have been published; all agreed
to.
Mr. Neal offered a resolution, which
was referred to the judiciary committee,
as to the constitutional right of Charles
Swayne, appointed district judge of the
northern district of Florida, to exercise
the duties of that office without confirm'
atorv action by the senate.
The senate then proceeded to the con
sideration of executive business. After
the doors were reopened, the concurrent
resolution offered by Mr. lngnlls last
week for a holiday recess from Thursday
December 19, to Monday January 6,
was taken up for action. Mr. Edmunds
demanded the yens and nays upon it,
expressing his own opposition to it.
The resolution was agreed to, yeas 7,
nays 12. The negative votes were

A message from the house announcing
the death of representative Edward j.
Gay, of Louisiana, was laid Ufore the
senate, and on motion of Mr. Gibson, the
senate, as an additional mark of resjiect
to tbe memory of the deceased, at 3.30
adjourned till to-morrow.
HOUSE. Mr. McKinley, of Ohio, from
the committee on ways and means re
ported a resolution for the distribution
of the President's message among the
appropriate committees. The house
went into committee of the whole, (Mr.
Burrows, of Michigan, being selected to
preside) for consideration of the resolu
tion. Mr. Spinola, of New York, objec
ted to that elauseof the resolution which
Jirovidcs that all matters pertaining to
ortification and coast defense be referred
to the committee on appropriations.
The projier committee to have jurisdic
tion over such matters was the com
mittee on military affairs. He urged
upon the house, the necessity of taking
steps to protect the seacoast cities of the
country. A war occurring suddenly with
a second, or third, or even a fourth rate
power would jeopardize the interests 01
all the great cities on the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts. The subject was an im
portant one and could be more intelli
gently acted upon by that committee
than by the committee on appropria
tions. Mr. Cutcheou, of Michigan, who
has served upon the committee 011 mili
tary affairs tor six years past, took the
same view and persisted against that
committee being deprived of a jurisdic
tion which rightfully belongs to it.
Mr. Spinoiu offered nn amendment pro
viding that all matters relating to coast
defences be referred to the committee on
military affairs. Lost.
The committee then rose, und the reso
lution was adopted.
On motion of Mr. McKinley, a resolu
tion was adopted granting the commit
tee on ways and means leave to sit dur
ing the sessions of the house.
Mr. McKinley offered a resolution for
holiday recess from December 20 until
January 6. Referred.
He also introduced a bill to simplify
the laws in relation to the collection ol
revenue. Referred.
Mr. Boothmnn, of Ohio, from the com
mittee on accounts, reported a resolution
for the payment to the widow of Neal S.
Brown, late reading clerk of the house, a
sum equal to one year'ssalnry. Adopted.
Mr. Enloe then offered a resolution au
thorizing the sergeunt at arms to offer a
reward of $5,000 for the arrest and de
livery to the marshal of the District ol
Columbia of C. E. Silcott, absconding
cashier ol the late seigeant at arms; the
reward to be paid out of the contingent
fund of the House. Referred.
Mr. Springer introduced a bill to or
ganize the territory of Oklahoma. Re
ferred to the committee on territories,
together with bills on the same subject
introduced by Mr. Baker, ol New York.
The house adopted a resolution direct
ing the committee on elections to inquire
into the contested election cases ot Clay
ton against Breckenridge, from the sec
ond district of Arkansas, (Clayton hav
ing been assassinated while preparing
his case.)
The house then, ut 2.30, adjourned un
til to-morrow.
FATAL ACCIDENT.
Rumors an to a Terrible Disaster
Mine Miles From Chicago.
Chicago, December 16. The report
has just reached here to the effect that
the accident happened to the train 011 the
line ol the Chicago and Eastern Illinois
railroad near Englewood in the Southern
part of the city. The particulars, thus
far received, are very meagre. They are
to the effect, that four people have been
killed, and that the wrecked train is on
fire. The city fire department has been
notified that the accident is near Oak
dale. Four persons were killed and
many injured. The train is said to have
caught fire and many persons injured in
tiie flames. One or two persons are said
to have been roasted to death. Five
engines from Englewood and South
Englewood have been called. An order
was sent to Englewood to have ever)'
physician in that suburb sent to the scene
of the wreck to care for the suffering.
Oakdale is a small suburb, about three
miles from South Engl?wood, and about
nine miles from Chicago. The train
wrecked is said to have been one in the
suburban service. Inquiry at the office
of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois
elicited the statement that information
received there was to the effect, that
everal persons have been injured, but
that no one had been killed.
Later. Authentic advices from the
scene of the accident show that it is far
less serious than was at first reported.
There were no fatalities, and the train
did not tnke fire. Engineer Murphy, of
the suburban train, had one leg so badly
smashed that amputation became neces
sary. The conductor and one passenger
were slightly hurt.
The Oo wen Suicide.

lord say, the box 01 cartrtnges nesoia
with the pistol was not a full one.
The Historical Event as Narrated
by His colored Servant.
Richmond Dispatch.
Raleigh, N. C, December 11, 1889.
Your correspondent to-day interviewed
lames H. lones. a well-known colored
man, who was during the war the body-
servant of Jefferson Davis, and was with
him at his capture. Jones has just re
turned here from Fort Payne, Ala. He
is very intelligent, has for eighteen
years been an alderman of Raleigh, and
no man is more devoted to Mr. Davis,
living or dead. ' Jones was asked to
narrate the incidents at the capture ol
Mr. Davis, and did so as follows:
I became Mr. Davis' servant in 1802,
and when his family came to Raleigh the
next year 1 accompanied them here. I
aided in packing the property when the
family left Richmond in 1865, and ac
companied Mrs. Davis and the children
southward.
We got a wagon and an ambulance at
Newberry, S. C. Mr. Davis joined us
down in Georgia one Sunday morning.
We canied when we stopped nt night.
Mr. Davis rode his favorite saddle-horse,
a splendid bay named Kentucky. 1
always looked after the comfort of the
party. In one tent were Mr. and Mrs.
Davis and in another their four children
Maggie, Jeff., Willie, and Varina and
Miss Maggie Howell, Mrs. Davis'ssistcr;
also, two maids one white and one
colored.
A FOGGY NIGHT.
The night of the capture was foggy. 1
was up all night, washing and drying
clothes at a fire which burned near the
tents. A creek ran close by, in a sort ot
ravine, and there was a road passing by
the camp. I heard noises about mid
night, but they were not alarming, and I
saw gleams which I now know were the
glitter of sabres. About 4 o'clock in the
morning, and before daylight, I heard
the sound of horses' hoots on the soft
pine straw which covered the ground.
The tents were closed. All the jieople
were asleep. I was the only one awake.
There was a very hcavv dew.
AROl'SKU HIM.
As soon as I heard the noise I went to
Mr. Davis' tent and aroused him. I also
remember that I waked Mr. Reagan,
Col. Joseph Johnston, Col. Wood, Col.
Burton Harrison, Col. Lovett, of Texas,
and Ml-. William Howell, Mrs. Davis'
brother; also some other gentlemen who
were asleep here and there, some under
tent flies. Col. Harrison was nearest
the creek and directly he was awake, he
halted a Federal soldier who was the
lirst to cross the creek. I told Col. Har
rison it must le the enemy I had seen
moving about in the pines all night. By
the time Mr. Davis had dressed himscil
the enemy were in the camp. I had
meanwhile saddled Mr. Davis' horse,
which was tied between the camp and
the creek. It was Mr. Davis' purpose to
get on his horse, make a clash into the
ravine, and so escape. As Mr. Davis
stepped from his tent he saw lx'fore him
a man mounted on horseback, armed
with a carbine, which was pointed at
him. Mr. Davis had on Mrs. Davis' wa
terproof ragl.111, which by mistake he
had taken for his own, and as he was a
great sufferer from neuralgia he had put
a light hood over his head and shoulders
which he frequently wore. Mrs. Davis,
solicitous ot his health as she always
was, as I e stepped out of the tent threw
her shawl upon him. Mr. Davis seeing
the cavalryman at once advanced fear
lessly towards him and called upon him
to fire. The cavalryman did not fire,
and Mr. Davis again called to him to do
so. At this moment Mrs. Davis, in her
night dress, sprang from the tent, threw
her arms uround her husband's neck and
addressing the cavalrvman, said : "For
God's sake don't shoot."
MR. DAVIS' PLAN.
Mr. Davis' plan had been to letthecav-
alryman fire at him and taking the
chances of a miss, rush upon him, unseat
mm, and mount his horse and escape.
But at Mrs. Davis' words he went back
to the tent with her. There he was given
a bucket, 1 think, by her and started to
wards 1 ne creeK as 11 lor waier, intending
to get into the ravine and escape on his
horse, but he was again halted by the
same trooper He then returned to the
fire. Just about this time lively firing
was heard fifty yards off and across the
creek. Colonel Pritchard next made his
appearance, and walking up to the fire
looked at Mr. Davis and said to me: "Is
that Jefferson Davis?" I said "Yes,"
and Colonel Pritchard then said to Mr.
Davis: "You are my prisoner." Colonel
Pritchard was very courteous and gen
tlemanly. He permitted no insult to be
given then or at any time while he was
111 command, and gave particular instruc
tions to that effect.
Mr. Davis had very little to say at the
time of his capture and exhibited no fear
whatever. He und his party had break
last before they left and then the camp
was struck and the wagon loaded. The
party started off under a cavalry guard,
the maids and children in the wagon i.i
charge of myself and Robert Brown,
(colored), who had been Mr. Davis' but
ler, Mr. and Mrs. Davis and others trav
eling in the ambulance. I pitched camp
for them at night. I was kept under ar
rest all the while and was not permitted
even to go after milk for the children un
less a guard accompanied me. I was
taken to Fortress Monroe with Mr.
Davis. There I was released and came
to Raleigh.
Mr. Davis was always greatly attached
to Jones, ns was also his family, and
wrote to him. He always appreciated
Jones' devotion. Jones attended the me
morial exercises to-day and was greatly
affected.
Killed by a Train.
Wilkeshakre, Pa., December 16.
This evening on the Delaware, Lacka
wanna and Western railroad at Durea, a
few miles from here, a party of laborers
were walking home from work on the
railroad, when a passenger train ran
directly into them from around a curve.
One of tbe party was thrown aside and
escaped with bad bruises; three men were
killed outright and horribly mangled,
and another was so badly injured that he
cannot recover. It is supposed that the
men became confused in the darkness
and stepped in front of the train instead
of on to the other track.
Caucus Abandoned.
Washington, December 16. The dem
ocratic house caucus which was called to
meet to-night has been abandoned. It
was the purpose of the caucus to deter
mine what position, if any, the partv
should take in regard to the Silcott defi
ciency, and it was generally understood
that a proposition was to be submitted
that the democrats assess themselves
individually to make good the republican
losses. Mr. Holman circulated the call
and secured tbe requisite number of sig
natures, but as it appeared that there
was a strong opposition to the purpose
for which the caucus was to be held it
was abandoned.
Dr. i. C. Rankin Warmly Com
mends Some Portions of It.
Mr. Editor: I have read with much
interest Captain Patton's article in your
Sunday issue on capital punishment. I
am not prepared to endorse all that he
says, but I am delighted with the reli
gious spirit that he manifests toward
an unfortunate class of our race, and es
jK'cially am I pleased with his expressed
interest in the spiritual condition of the
poor man now in our jail condemned
to death. His appeal in the following
Caragraph to the clergy of the city in
ehalf of this man is perhaps not out of
place, to-wit :
"Reverend gentleman, if the words
eternal damnation convey to you the
same awful weight of meaning, as to us,
who can only construe them in their
plain English, surely, surely, not one of
vou will sit quiet in your comlortable
study, nor allow restful sleep to come to
your bed, while there is the slightest
chance of this poor prisoner being hur
ried to that fate unrepentant."
I am not able to say to what extent
my brother ministers have been sitting
in their "comfortable study" unmindlul
of this poor fellow's doom, but I am
aware of the fact that one of them, at
least, sought out and found him some
months ago and gave him instructions
and administered to him spiritual conso
lation, nnd the visit has been repented
more than once. Good religious litera
ture has also been furnished him for his
edification. "Eternal damnation" means
to us exactly what the bible says it does,
and "restful sleep" was not allowed to
come to our eves, after we learned of the
presence of this man in our prison, until
we had carried the truth of the gospel to
his cell.
I commend Captain Pattonfor visiting
this prisoner in his dire extremity, and
let other laymen do likewise.

THE TOBACCO TAX.
Mr. Ilrt.wer, of N. C, Leading the
Movement for lis Repeal.
Washington, D. C, December 13. Mr.
Brower, of North Carolina, who yester
day introduced a bill to repeal the tax
on tobacco, was the onlv Republican,
with one exception, who voted for the
Mills bill, and he gave as his reason for
doing so that that bill provides for a re-
leal of the tobacco tax. He cast his
vote for the Mills bill alter the congres
sional convention in his district, nnd
some of the republican managers wanted
him to withdraw from the republican
ticket liecause of it, hut this he refused to
do and was elected by a small majority.
lie has insisted throughout the tariff dis
cussion that the one thing which the
lieople of North Carolina want is
the reieal of the internal revenue
taxes. He claims that if his bill is
promptly reported from the committee
on W'nvs and Means, nnd it is said that
it will Ik, that it will pass the house
with some twentv-one democratic votes
in its favor, besides nearly a solid re
publican vote. The democrats whom he
claims as with him arc the six from
North Carolina, the eight from Virginia,
three from Tennessee, two from South
Carolina, Mr. Hatch, of Missouri, the
chairman of the committee on Agricul
ture in the last congress, and Mr. Ab
bott, of Texas.
VALUABLE INVENTION.
ASystemof Arc Lllit by Which all
Danger Is Avoided.
Pittsiiirg, Pa., December 16. A new
system of arc lighting apparatus has
just been invented bv the vtestinghouse
blectric Company, the dynamo, or the
electric machine from which the current
for the lights is generated, is very differ
ent from any dynamo used for a similar
purpose. It is so constructed that it de
livers the required number of amperes
whether the machine is supplying one
lamp or its full load. In addition to the
dynamo the system has an entirely new
arc lamp. The principal point in which
the lamp diners trom all others is that its
carbon iasts for three nights. The lamps
can be so connected in the circuit that no
person coming in contact with it can re
ceive a shock from the line. The system
will entirely revolutionize the arc light
ing now in use.
Decision In a Telegraph Suit.
Washington, December 16. The su
preme court of the United States to-day
rendered an opinion in the case of the
Western union leegraph Company
against the Secretary of the State ol
Alabama and other State officers, brought
here 111 nn appeal trom the decision ot
the supreme court of Alabama. The
question involved is the constitutionality
I the Inw ot Alabama, imposing a tax
upon gross receipts of all telegraph com
panies tor business done within the Mate.
I'nder this act the telegraph company
was taxed, not onlv on business done
entirely within the State, buton messages
sent to, or received trom other Mates.
This court, in the opinion by ustice
Miller, says, that it is hardly worth
while to make any discussion about the
matter, ns the court has six or eight
times, within as many years, decided
that messages sent from one State into
another are not subject to taxation, be
cause it would be interference with inter
State commerce. Judgment reversed.
A Boundary Despute.
Washington, 16. Attorney Genernl
Ayres, of Virginia, to-day made amotion
in the supreme court asking leave on
behalf of the State of Virginia to file a
bill inequity against the State of Tennes
see, to settle the Doundarv dispute be
tween ti e two states. It is asserted in
the motion of Attorney Genernl Ayres
that Tennessee unlawfuflyclaimsjurisdic
tion over a stretch of land from two to
eight miles in width extending from the
northern border ot ftorth Carolina to
the border line of Kentucky. The town
of Bristol is one of the places situated
within the disputed territory.
Gas strike A Failure.
London, December 16. The strike of
the employees of the South Metropolitan
Gas Company has proved a failur. , the
company having filled all the strikers'
places with non-union men. 1 here have
been no disturbances, and the work at the
gas house is proceeding quietly.
The New Vork Herald's Washington
corrcsiiondent notes the tact that there
is a Inrge proportion ot young men in
the present House, many of them being
in the thirties, and the average age of
the House being only forty. As the
Herald savs, this is a new departure. It
is not a bad one. Give the young men
a chance.

Washington, Decem'.ier 16. The bond
offerings to-day aggregated $356,400;
all accepted at 1.27 for four per cents,

AN ENTHUSIASTIC RAILROAD
MEETING IN BURNSVILLE.
Capt. Natt Atkinson Addresses a
I. once Assemblage in the Court
House A Subscription Seems a
Foregone Conclusion.
On the first Monday in this month the
commissioners of this county believing
that the time had come for them to move
in the matter of giving aid to some rail
road or roads determined to call the jus
tices of the peace together to net with
them in this important matter, nnd to
meet at the court house in Burnsville on
Saturday, 14th inst. At the same time
a committee composed of one person
from each township was appointed to
prepare and report suitable resolutions
and papers for the action of the 'omt
board.
The commissioners and a considerable
number of the magistrates together with
a large number of the citizens meet nt
Burnsville on Saturday when the rail
road question was fully considered and
disposed of after the following order:
Between eleven and twelve o'clock the
court house hell summoned the people and
county officials together to proceed with
the business that they had met to trans
act, and when the court room was well
tilled the chairman of the commissioners,
knowing that the Atlanta, Asheville and
Baltimore railroad company was the
one the people had most at heart, called
upon Capt. Natt Atkinson, its president,
for an address, not only on the matter ol
his ood, but fir arguments and reasons
why the jieople ol Yancey county should
vote in aid of railroads through that
county. Althongh suffering from a deep
and scverecold Capt. Atkinson responded
in one of the best efforts of his life, nnd I
wish every man in Yancey could have
heard his speech. For more than one
hour and a half the audience was held
almost spell bound, and at the closest hey
were so well pleased that if the proposi
tion had been put, the subscription would
have been given to the A., A. and B. road
without a dissenting vote.
He first spoke of the South nnd the
Southern people who had come up out ol
the ashes as it were since the war and
were manfully battling in times of peace
as they did in war for the honor and
prosperity of this section, and notwith
standing our adverse surroundings we
were again on our feet and ready under
all circumstances to do our full duty.
That duly now was to possess ourselves
of those advantages enjoyed by our
brethren in other sections of our deal
Southland. He showed us what a great
country we had, what a ureat eople wt
were and we only needed to be informed
that railroads and theothcr conveniences
of life were possible and we would have
them.
He called attention to the fact that
Yancey county had ever since she was a
county, been paying taxes to build rail
roads and for the upbuilding of the state
in every portion, from the mountains to
the sea, and they had never given a cent
to build railroads or anything else for
themselves. He showed what a grand
line the Atlanta, Asheville and Baltimore
railroad was; that it passed 400 miles
through a section that had no roads,
and through the finest timber nnd min
eral belt in the continent of America, and
that it is 100 milesshortcrthananyother
line from Atlanta towards the northeast
ern cities. He told them that old Bun
combe had met in mass meeting and in
structed the commissioners of that coun
ty to submit a proposition of $200,000
to be voted for their road. He then
showed that this road would run twenty
miles through Yancey county, and that
the tax on the railroad property would
almost pay the entire tax on the bonds
of $50,000 which were to lie subscribed
to build it. He showed them how such
a road would build them a beautiful lit
tle city at Burnsville which would in a
lew years pay two-thirds of their taxes,
as Asheville was now doing for Bun
combe county.
He called their attention to the great
fertility of Yancey soil, and its adapta
bility especially to fruit raising. He
showed that if the county would culti
vnte one single variety of apples exclu
sively, they would within twenty years
be the richest people in the Southern
States. That apple was the Newtown
or Albemarle pippin; that apple grows
to greater perfection in this county than
in Virginia where it sells by tbe car load
at four and five dollars a barrel, and not
one barrel in a hundred that is wanted
could be gotten.
I wish you had more space to permit
other strong points of his speech to be
given for the benefit of those who did
not hear. At the conclusion ol Capt.
Atkinson's speech the meeting adjourned
till after dinner.
Again the bell called the meeting to
order when G. D. Ray, vice-president of
the Atlanta, Asheville nnd Baltimore
railroad, was called to the chair and L.
H. Smith was requested to act as secrc
ry. When this was done Capt. W. M.
NIoore, chairman of the committee was
appointed to prepare proceedings for the
action of the joint board presented for
the consideration of the board the result
of their deliberation to wit : That Yan
cey county subscribe $50,000 to the At
lanta, Asheville and Baltimore railroad
company.
When this proposition was submitted
Col. McElroy was called lor ami made
an excellent speech in favor of railroads.
He showed the people the great advan
tnges of railroads and nt the conclusion
of his Seech he was heartily cheered.
Then Capt. J. M. Gudgcr came to the
front after being loudly called for, nnd
gave us one of his level best, and that
means a good deal.
Then Col. St. Clair, the attorney of the
three C's railroad was called lor and
made a most impressive and unanswera
ble speech in behalf of railroads and es
pecially his road that was then making
its survey in this county. He impressed
the audience very much and made many
friends fir himscil and his road. At the
conclusion of his well received remarks,
Mr. Ramseur came forward and said he
hod no speech to make as he had written
to the commissioners what he had to
say.
At this juncture Captain Moore, the
nttornev tor the county, announced that
there was not a majority of the justices
of the peace present, which the Inw re
auired to make their action legal, and
moved thnt the meeting adjourn for
final action till Tuesday after tbehrst
Mondav in February. 1890.
The Secretary was requested to pub
lish these proceedings in The Asheville
Citizen, when the meeting amournea.
Every body was in a real good humor,
and elated with the fine prospects of
getting a railroad.
G. D. Ray, Chairman,
L. H. Smith, Secretary.
Go where duty call, but turn in and
help when you get there. Don't stand

The season is beginning very good
this year and they promise a large sea
son. Santa Claus Shopping;.
Old Santa Claus came to Asheville yes
terday to see what he could do for his
children. He wanted to get an idea of
the place, sec what the stores had in
stock for his little ones, and then try to
supply their deficiencies. But, alas! for
poor Santa, the first one he struck was
Jones' Racket Store. One glance at the
window, and the wizard of the north
lost his keen elated air. Those reindeers
of his would have to travel far and fast
before he could be back by Christmas
with a supply of the things that were
not in, stock there. But nevertheless he
went in strictly incog, to be sure, and
examined t'le articles which heaped up
the counters and whose overwhelming
profusion threatened to break theshclves
with their weight. All were passed in
review, and at each step Santa pulled out
his note book, and muttered in despair,
"I guess I'd better buy here for my chil
dren in the North, for it doesn't cost me
anything for freight. I wish I hadn't
bought my stock of shoes before I drop

So he went the rounds until he reached
the hosiery counter, where his ruddy face
rcw pale, and he exclaimed, "Hello! Are
long stockings so cheap in Asheville? 1
pity the parents, but I can't afford to
fill those?" And off sailed Santa Claus,
grumbling in his white beard at the mer
chant who had put up such a job on him.
ODDS AND F:NDS.
On Sunday morning as Miss Mary
Pcnland was coming down stairs at her
residence, on Penland street, she made
a misstep, causing a severe sprain of the
foot, which will probably confine her to
the house for several weeks.
In our column of personals in Sunday's
issue it was incorrectly stated that "Mr.
E. R. Betts, agent of a large tobacco firm,
was in Asheville, where he would make
his headquarters for the winter." This
was inadvertently doing an injustice to
Mr. Belts, who is so active a man in the
interests of his business that he makes
no long tarry at any particular point,
visiting all the markets, and remaining
it each one only so long a time as judi
ciously engages his time, repeating his
visits if necessary.
AN OLD SLAVIC OF MR. DAVIS,
He was Present at His old Mas
ter's Funeral.
From the New Orleans Picayune of the
15th we take the following, told in con
miction with the departure of Mr. Davis
and party for Beauvoir:
Robert Brown, the old slave of Mr.
Davis, went to Beauvoir with Mrs.
Davis, where, he told a reporter, he
would stay several days and then go
back home. His home is in St. Elmo,
near Mobile, Ala., and he lives with Mr.
Thomas Templeton, a Scotchman.
Brown said he had lieen with Mr. Davis
until lately since 1861 and staved with
him all through the war.
"Mr. Davis was a good master to me,
sir, and I loved him very much. 1 came
to his funeral to sec the Inst of him, as I
thought it my duty. I don't like to say,"
he continued, "how old I am, but 1 will
tell you. I was born in 1811, just three
years later than Mr. Davis. All my
years have been pure, and I have nothing
to lie ashamed of. Mr. Templeton takes
care of me, nnd he is a good man, too.
My rheumatism troubles me a great
deal and I can hardly stand now."
The old man went away, still talking
about his beloved master, "Mr. Jeff."
The party was a sad one and very quiet

What His Old Home Thinks of
Our Col. J. B. Steele.
Charleston News and Courier.
Mr. John B. Steele, the manager of the
Battery Park hotel, at Asheville. N. C,
has been in the city since Wednesday
last. In Mr. Steele every one recognizes
the old Charlestoninn who was formerly
of the firm of Edwin Bales & Co. Mr.
Steele moved to Asheville about fivr,
years ago, and has not since then visited
Charleston up to the present tune, flic
personal traits, tbe ple'.ising address and
the courtesy whicli rrade .Mr. Steele so
popular in Charleston secured lor him a
"royal reception" this time, as he ex
pressed it yesterday. He has been "in
demand" among his many friends here,
but the supply will only last until to
morrow morning, when he will return
to Asheville,
The object of Mr. Steele's visit was
partly of a business and partly of a per
sonal character. He mentioned the in
teresting fact that he bad come all the
wav from Asheville to buy game tor tin
Christmas tables at the Battery Park
hotel. At present there are about 0111
hundred and forty guests at the hotel.
and the establishment will be filled to its
utmost capacity during the present
winter season.
Mr. Steele gave a reporter last night
an interesting acccunt ol the operations
of the Vaudcrbills near Asheville. These
millionaires are improving their 5.OO0
acre purchase and propose to construct
through their domains fully twenty-one
miles of drives. They . 'ire going to build
an American palace also, the whole
tiling to cost about $111,000,0(10.
Mr. Steele was quite enthusiastic on
the subject of the many progressive
movements in Asheville and has strong
faith in a great and prospcrousfuture lot
the Mountain City. He will pay a short
visit to huminerville to-dav on a very
interesting mission and will return to
Asheville to-morrow morning.

THE GREAT CRONIN TRIAL
BKUt GH I TO A CLOSE.

Guilty of Murder, Iinprisoment
for Life KunzeGetsTUrev Years
lieggs Is Acquitted.
Chicago, Dscembcr 16. The Cronin
jury, as far as is known outside of the
jury room has still been unable to f ch
a verdict. They Sent the nighi la a
room in the criminal court bi. Id. .g
which they occupied continuously since
Friday, and kept a light burning brightly
until atter 2 o'clock this morning. Judge
McCoiiiiell's private instructions to the
bailuls were to take the jury back to the
hotel in case they agreed on a verdict,
and that he would receive it this morn
ing. The fact that they remained in the
jury room may be taken as pretty con
clusive contradiction of publications in
extra papeis this morning that they had
come to a conclusion before 9 o'clock
last night. In and around the criminal
court building at 9 o'clock this morning
everything was exceedingly quiet. A
lew policemen patrolled the streets ill the
neighborhood, and inside all the doors
were guarded as usual by the bailiffs. At
the State attorney's office it was stated
that not a word b'- been heard trom the
jury by the prosi.ting attorney this
morning, and that all reports that they
had last night agreed were simply guess
work. All the morning )aiers to-day
seem to be of the opinion that a verdict
will be reached to-day, and this view of
the situation is strengthened by an
interview with Judge McConuell which
was sent out in these despatches last
night and in vbich the Judge expressed
belief that a verdict would be reached.
basing his belief chietly on the assertion
that he had received no intimation trom
the jury that they had been unable to
agree.
later.
Judge McConncll at 10.20 formally
announced from the bench that no ver
dict had been reached anil that he would
not be in attendance again before 2 p. m.
Unce more the audience that assembled
to hear the verdict of the Cronin jury
have been doomed to disappointment.
udge .McConncll arrived at the court
room at about 10 o'clock and at once
sent a messenger to the bailiff in charge
of the jury room to enquire whether the
jury had any communication to make to
the court. The answer came back
promptly and tersely that the jury was
prepared to make no return and had no
communication whatever to make to the
court. Thus all reports ol the jury hav
ing agrceil upon a verdict were lound to
be as utterly groundless as the hundred
that had pieceded them.
Judge McConncll retired from thecourt
with the announcement that ill case the
jurv should, during the day, arrive at a
conclusion he would be in attendance at
2 p. m. to receive any return or communi
cation which thejury might be prepared
to make.
It is now utterly impossible that any
information of anvcharaclercan be forth
coming from thejury before 2 p. m. Ru
mors ol purported verdicts belore that
hour may be regarded as absolutely
groundless. No information whatever is
known beyond the general conclusion
that Mr. Culver is the dissenting juror.
A VliKDICT.
The Cronin trial has resulted in a ver
dict; Coughlin, Burke and O'Sullivan,
guilty ot murder, penalty life imprison
ment; Kunze, three years; Bcggs, acquit
ted, The Late David Henderson.
In Sunday morning's issue was briefly
noted the death of this gentleman; and
we regretted very much nt the time that
we had so little information of him ; noth
ing indeed beyond the fact that he was
connected with the woolen mills on
Reams' creek, near Weaverville. We
have since learned that the deceased was
a native of Scotland who landed at a
New England port in 1854, and for
twelve years subsequently was employed
in manufactories in the State of New
York. How long he has been in this
State we do not know, but probably
ever since the mill on Rectus' creek was
opened. He was a quiet, industrious,
christian man. He never married, de
voting all his care to his aged m jthcr,
whom he provided for with affectionate
solicitude up to her death which occurred
two or three years ago. Mr. Henderson
was 58 years of age at the time of his
death.
Hurt in a Runawav.
Two boys, one white and tbe other col
ored, between fifteen and twenty, were
bringing in a load of wood from the
country yesterday morning. When the'
reached Depot street the brake broke
and they could not hold the team
back. Tbe horses became unmanage
able and ran away down the hill,
throwing the boys out. The white
lad had his ankle fractured, while the
other received a severe cut in his head.
They were taken to Dr. Justice and Dr.
Burroughs, where their hurts were at
tended to. The team brought up against
a post at the side of the road without
doing much damage to the wagon.
A Handsome Paper.
W. F. Tomlinson, the enterprising ed
itor of Country Homes, has just issued
from the presses of The Citizen Publish
ing Company the Christmas number of
his iK-riodical, ntrd it affords us pleasure
to say that it is equal to any of the holi
day literature we have seen. It is appro
priately illustrated, and, in addition to
the usual amount of valuable matter, is
choice Christmas reading and a hand
sonic colored cover, which gives the
whole n most artistic finish. We feel sure
the patrons of Country Homes will ap
preciate this stroke of enterprise on the
part of Mr. Tomlinson ns it deserves.
The Wilmington Review
Has got fairy into the teems, being

will that so strongly attaches to bim

tinuance of favor and a long lite of prosperity.
