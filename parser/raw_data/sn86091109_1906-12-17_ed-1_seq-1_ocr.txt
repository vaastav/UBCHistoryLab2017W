President Elliot Claims
Fuel Supply Is In*
adequate
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.—In re
sponse to an inquiry addressed to the
presidents of several western rail
roads by the inter-state commerce
commission as to the cause of the re
ported shortage of cars for the trans
portation of fuel by reason of which
great suffering is entailed, President
Elliott of the Northern Pacific railroad
telegraphs to the commission from
St. Paul in effect that the company
has done all,and will continue to do
all It can do to prevent suffering. He
says his company warned fuel deal
ers In June and July that the fuel
supply was likely to be Inadequate,
advising them to provide stock and to
seek new sources of supply.
President Elliott says the charges
sf extraordinary delays in transporta
tion do not apply to his company. He
says the difficulty In Washington, Ida
ho and Montana is that not enough
coal is being produced to supply
promptly the Increased domestic trade
and at the same time furnish the rail
roads with .sufficient fuel to operate
their trains. The floods in the Cas
cades in November damaged the North
cn Pacific tracks and a number of
important mines could not be reached
for weeks. Heavily Increased traf
fic In all commodities has also tended
to increase the difficulties of the situ
ation. " ... ,i
FEW
FROM
Portland, Dec. 16—While today
passed without serious incident, it Is
feared that tomorrow will see de
monstrations more riotous than those
of Saturday night when a mob of
sympathizers of the striking street
car operatives In- this city forced the
Portland Light and Power company
to abandon Its service for the night.
This is the fear of the police depart
ment and of General Manager Ful
ler of the street car company. It Is
freely admitted by the street car men
that they will leave no stone unturn
ed to prevent the operation of cars
tomorrow.
Bright and early this morning the
strikers were on hand at the car barns
doing missionary work among those
who remained faithful to the com
pany and this missionary work was
followed up during the day by the
strikers wherever and whenever a
car operatives could be found willing
to listen to their arguments. In many
cases the operatives remained firm
In their allegiance to the company,
but In many others they did not.
A meeting was held by the strikers
today after the com« any had sent Its
cars to the barn, but nothing that
transpired was given out. It ,is
known, however, that the street' car
men have been assumed the support
of the Federated Trades assembly.
It Is also declared that the team
*ters' union has decided to obstruct
all street cars as much as possible
by keeping their vehicles on the car
Tracks.
It is a matter of note that no
striker has been involved In any of
the disturbances that have taken place
ä-nd no street car man has so far been
Placed under arrest.

President Says Timber and
Stone Act Should Be
Repealed
WASHINGTON. Dec. 17.—The pres
ident's message on the subject of pub
lic lands was read in congress today.
The message recommends the imme
diate revision of the public land laws
to adapt them to actual conditions.

atone act had demonstrated conclu
sively that it is effective to turn over
public timber lands to great corpora
tions. It's appeal is recommended.
Radical changes In the desert land act
is urged in view of the fraud which
so frequently results from Its pro
visions, and changes In the homestead
act are equally desirable, says the

PRATT
An appeal has been filed with J. H.
Long, deputy clerk of the supreme
court, from an action of the district
court in Nez Perce county In the act-'
ton of J. M. Pratt plaintiff and re
spondent, against the Northern Pacific
Express company, defendant and ap
pellant. This action was oHginallÿ
brought by Pratt against the express
company for $660, alleged to have been
deposited In a sack with the company
agent at Culdesac for shipment to J.
W. Pratt at Lewiston, November 23,
1904. The evidence showed that the
money was probably a portion of that
taken in the robbery of the office at
Culdesac on the night of November
23, 1904, and never reached Its destina
tion. The principal defense was the
fact that there was a provision In the
receipt for the money that the com
pany should not be responsible for
more than $50 If the package was lost.
On the 10th day of April last a jury
gave the plaintiff a verdict for $723.28
and the court gave judgment accord
ingly. From this judgment the de
fendant company Is appealing.
The attorneys representing the par
ties are I. N. Smith and John Green

MOSCOW, Idaho, Dec. 17.—A most
spectacular scene was presented on
the university campüs yesterday after
noon by two detachments of the uni
versity cadets in a sham battle. As
the practice has not been Indulged In
for several months the "fake" fight waa
entered into with no end of enthusiasm
and especially by those who were new
with the Sprlngfields.
About sixty cadets were stationed
close to the embankment near the site
of the old administration building, j
while the remainder of the corps was
placed near the entrance of the cam
pus grounds. By real military strat
egy, consisting of fake attacks and
flank movements, the larger body
swept up the hill, firing at random and
put to flight the little hunch of heroes
who held the fort despite the wither
ing cross-fire of their enemies to the
very last.
Since Commandant Steuenberg has
taken charge of the department of
military science, the cadets have de
veloped into as worthy a lot of mili
tary bearing students as can be found
In the west. As a disciplinarian he has
