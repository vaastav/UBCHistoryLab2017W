saying that he was a victim to party

tion of the enforcement acts, a bad
law, known to him as such, passed by
a republican congress seeking to per
petuate the republican party, but which
lie found on the statute book and exe
cuted impartially. He gave in detail his

its worst enemy could desire, and
said when its unpopularity und inex

scrted by those who passed it and by

MoN'raoMKKY, Ala., December 5.
The state senate has ousted Miller, re
publican, and seated Martin, demo
crat. As this affair Is of national Im
portance, tho following review of facts
Is given : On organizing, the attorney
general com promised the legislature,
iu January,1873, and a quorum of court
room republican represeututives were
seated In the house. In thesenate, the
republicans wuuted one senator to
make a quorum, and entered a contest
for Martin's scut. The matter wus re
ferred to a committee, who reported
that, counting all the votes, Martin
democrat, was elected by two hundred
aud slxty-nino majority, and that,
counting only the legal votes, ho was
elected by two hundred and llxty-uve
majority. But, by arbitrary rulings,
Lieutenant Governor McKinsley seat
ed Miller and ousted Martin, without
allowing the senate to vote whether he
should be seated or not. The democrats
feeling thut, if they did not submit,
the republicans would agaiu withdraw,
set up a new legislature, and, securing
federal recognition, content themselves
with seeing that the journals stated the
fucts as they occurred.
After the lust election, the senate
holding over Murtiu petitioned for I) is
seat "
The petitiou was refered to a com
mittee who reported the foregoing
facts and recommended that the seuate
resume proceedings at tho point where
they had been broken off by Mc
Kinstey's arbitrary ruling and proceed
with what was,-in fact, the suspended
contest, This was agreed to and Mar
tin was declared entitled to his seat.
It was tills seating of Miller which
gave Spencer his sole claim to the seat
lie occupies in tho seuate.

Washington, December 5. The
president's message is not yet com
pleted, owing to delay in receiviug the
report of the district of Columbia com
missioners. Copies are being made to
day for congress und the press, although
the president has not shown it except
to the cabinet and theeopylsts. There
is the best reasons for believing it will
contain substantially the following
points, founded on expressions of the
president to intimate friends:
'rue president Bays ne uia not oegiu
the preparation of the message until a
week ago. Some of the newspapers
previously prognosticated its contents,
although he had consulted no one as to
what it should contain. There is no
doubt that the message will state thut
our relations with all torelgu powers
are friendly, though there is un un
settled question with Venezuela, which
has not uaid the awards of the joiut
commission under the eouvention of
Ibtiii. Congress strongly expressed its
sense on luis suoject in 1-eUiuury,
Tho president in His last message said
there was reason to believe the hes
itancy of that republic, in recogniziug
the claim, arose irom wanioi ruuus, in
part, threfore forbearance was expedi
ent. We have also an uusettled question
with Spain, growing out of tho Virgin-
ius ullair aud other previous transac
tions in connection with Cuba. The
nreseut unsettled affaira cauuot long
continue, .vheii it may become neces
sary to interfere to terminate the in
surrection which has bo long pi evaded,
tho Spanish government having uu-
mieeesstuliy attempted to suppress iu
Meantime the commerce of all coun
tries and especially that of the United
States sutlers. The nag or ine united
States and England have been in
sulted. The president, in conversa
tion, said tiiat the United States pur
ch tined about eight per cent of Cuban
exports aud therefore the duties paid
ny American citizens coiunuuie to
this exteut in Helping cspain to con
tinue the war BKuiust the insurgents.
The president had hoped the present
negotiations witn npuin wouiu nave
been ended, but was disappointed,
therefore, says little or nothing In his
message about an indemnity pending
negotiations, but at a ruture lime win
present the subject to the special con
sideration of congress.
The position of the president on the
financial quest iou is as follows, not
withstanding the speculation of those
who siMike without authority: He de
sires und will recommend the resump
tion of specie payment at the earliest
practical time, hut does nut think this
wiil t e winner than the 1st of January,
l87(i, but does not uame any day, l.av
init it to congress. The legal tender
clause of the currency net should be
repeated. Power should lie given to
the H-cretary of the treasury to obtain
gold from ami after the date fixed for
r ouinptiou by tiie issuance of bonds.
The greatest economy should be prae-tii-i-it
in all the departments, and if
lni-ei"Sui y the en-loins and internal
revenue laws should he changed.
Kiitiiiini' should be fret'; bill holders
shoui-J continue to be protected as at
prrsrnf. Tl;i-re fliould ! nn limit to
Ine v iln'ne of the currency, as the
coin iou ii ity should determine w hat
amount is required tor business, in
stead of leaving the executive, secre
tary of the treasury and congress to
fix'lt.
The president will recommend that
connrws do not interfere with the pres
net tirr-n-y set unless to amend It so as
to conform with a plan for the resump
tion of specie iyiiieiit.

'The Lone Star State is one of the garden
spot of the continent. No land on tho earth
is more productive, aim pnssosson of reul
estate property in Texas may look with cer
tainty for Its ruplu advancement in vulue,
A plun Is on . foot which will give
many a man a ood farm fur an
li.vitilHf.niir sum. Tl:e maimers. Messrs.
Wugley & lioeknrt, of Houston, are men of
high respectability and great busim c-apnc-
8t, Louis Kepuhlltuui.
The Texas, Odd Fellow ulso endorses the
above, and states :
"From our long and favorable knowledge
of tho Urm we take pleasure in commending
them to the public as honest, honorable geu
tleiuen. Aud the Galveston New adds :
"The distribution will comprise over 00,000
acres of laud, located lu thirty-eight coun
ties. They are divided Into parcels, and it Is
promised by gentlemen, whose cnaraetei-s
are equal to those of any In the luud, that
they wilt be fairly, honestly uud equitably
distributed."
And the Age of Houston states :

eighteen tiioussnd dollars. ISO far ns regard
the standing of the managers, that Is a mat
ter beyond the iossibilily of cavil.
The Telegraph of Houston, thus speaks of
the distribution :
"The drawing will come off on the twenty
first of lx-eemlier,.lust In time for lots of peo
ple to get a sulntnntial 'Christmas gi.u' The
card gives ail She particulars inueh bel
ter than we can write them, und we need
only give our readers the assurance that the
managers are lueu of stundUig aud relia
bility?' The Herald, Crockett, Texas, says:
"The plan these gentlemen have aiopted,
to sell the large amount of laud for which
they are agent. Is a most oomraeudableone.
The drawing will be conducted nu the best
plan that can be adopted to secur? fairness to
all. Messrs. Wagley & Lockbart are old roal
e tale agents of Houston, and are men wiio
havea reputation for honesty and mtfgrity."
Tbe Kansas City Chronicle remarks :
"Waeley A Lockhart,Houston, Texas, ofler
chances to eet a good farm Id 'lexas for 13 Oo.
It Is a square thing."
The Press, Paris, Texas, remarks :
"The well known firm of Waeley Lnc-lc
hart, tbe Isrtrest real estate tlrm in theiai,
are the originators of thiss-beme by which
Mionsaiirisur acres will be brought into use
and a large population added."
The Willis Oberver states:
"These gentlemen are too well known to
need By further indorsement of ours."
Tbe Ellis County News, Texas, comments
as follows :
"These sentlemen are trustworthy and rell
al.lA. There Is a chance lor vou to obtain a
good home by lDvetini the small sain of
three dollars. The distribution will positive
ly take place at Houston, lH-cember 21."
Comraendatlona.of the "Distribution" are
being received every day from leading dtt
sens and public officials of Texss, showing
that they are folly alive to Its merits.

anil baldness often, though not always,

the hair where tho follicles nro de
stroyed, or the glands atrophied aud
decayed; but such as remain can be
saved by this application, and stimu
lated into activity, so that a new
growth of hair is produced. Instead
of fouling the hair with a pasty sedi
ment, it will keep it clean and vigorous.
Its occasional use will prevent the hair
from turning gray or fulling otf, and
consequently prevent baldness. The
restoration of vitality it gives to the
scalp arrests and prevents tho forma
tion of dandruff, which is often so un
cleanly and olleiisivo. Free from those
deleterious substances which make
some preparations dangerous and inju
rious to tho hair, tho Vigor can only
benefit but not harm it. If wanted
merely for a JIAIll DRESSING,
nothing ulso can bo found so desirable.
Containing neither oil nor dye, it does
not soil white cambric, nud yet lasts
long on the hair, giving it a rich, glossy
lustre, and a grateful perfume.
