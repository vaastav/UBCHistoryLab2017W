* ltu; a bonus to the soldiers by the
adverse criticism of Democrats who

incidentally to the subject in his an^
. z. ua 1 message.
That the majority party in Congress
^ intends to take care of the soldiers at
this session is a foregone conclusion,
providing the ways and means can be
found to raise the vast sum needed
t for the purpose without seriously crippling
industry.
Leaders on both sides of Congress
(; declare the situation as regards the
bonus remains unsettled and undetermined.
The course of action on that
mooted question has not crystallized to
:i point where it is possible to make a
public announcement, is the way the
loaders sized up the matter.
.* The Demociats are making the most
? "7 , of the delay in Congress over the
i/'-' "t oMiers' relief measure, impugning all
sorts of dishonorable motives to the
Republicans. For instance, RepreBentative
Gallivan (Mass.) declared in
the House that the latest plan of the
Republicans is to pass the bonus bill
V "* In June so that the first payment will
be made to the soldiers on the eve of
a the Congressional election. The only
obstacle in the way of that pro?
gramme, he added, is the possibility
that the Republicans will adopt a pen>

Unrest Over Bonus mil.
"It is contemptible for the Democrats
to use a psychological situation to fix
their political fences by making absurd
> remises to the soldiers and offering
1 ope which they could not fulfil if in
.'3 iiror," said a leading Republican.
Tt must be admitted that there is con1
derable unrest among some of the Republican
members of the House over the
?lelay ever the bonus bill. Fear is expressed
by many members that It will
be a serious handicap to their reelection,
as it provides a strong if deceptive
weapon for the opponents.

leaders tire convinced that If the true
facta are presented to the voters the j
party in power will be commended In-'
stead of censured for deferring pay- j
inents for the soldiers until a time when !
the condition of the Treasury can stand '
the strain.
To support that view it was pointed '
out that in the last election a deter- j
mined fight was made against Repre- 1
sentatlve Walsh (M&sa) for hie oppo-.
sition to the bonus bill and he was re- [
turned to Congress by an increased majority.
He went before the electorate
and openly admitted his opposition to
the bonus on the ground that such action
then would almost bankrupt the
country.
Conditions may so shape themselves *
in Congress that the Republicans may \
be forced to go before their constituents
and defend their failure to provide funds
for the soldiers. However, it Is hoped
by Republican leaders that some such
plan can be evolved out of the funding
bill by which a part of the interest on
the foreign debt can be diverted to the I
relief of the soldiers, so that the flnan- j
cial structure of this country would not |
feel the strain.
Make Retnru to Cancus.
In response to the appeal made by j
President Harding In his message to the j
effect that the party In power should j
assume full responsibility for legislation
and determine upon n policy of sup- |
plement campaign pledges, there is a
strong likelihood that the Republican [
leaders In Congress will go back to the I
old caucus system, which was discarded I
some years ago, following the unhorsing j
of Uncle Joe Cannon as Speaker.
It will be recalled that In the days i
when Cannon reigned supreme In the
House caucuses were held frequently,
and it was charged that action in the
House on imp- f measures was morij
or less perfu ry. Considerable opposition
to that system developed and It
waa made an Issue In political campaigns
and reached its height In 1912, when
the Progressives succeeded in splitting
the Republican party wide open.
To placate that opposition the Republican
leaders abandoned the caucus and
"conferences" were substituted at which
were held free and full discussion of
pending questions with no votes binding, j
In the meantime the Democrats held
to the caucus idea and have been able
to keep their voters in line.
On the other hand the Republicans
have been going along of late years, it
was pointed out by some of the leaders,
like a ship without a rudder, which accounts
to a great extent for the failure
of the last session to redeem the party
pledges and carry out the suggestions
made by President Harding in his message
calling the extra session.
Furthermore, because of the lack of;
the party caucus "blocs" have developed
in both branches of Congress, which j
have Indeed blocked the programme of
the leaders and made it Impossible for
tl.em to carry out their promises and
enact important legislation.
While President Harding In his appeal
for team work uses the word conference
lntsead of caucus, leaders are
disposed to believe that he had In mind
Ihe functions of the old time caucus and
that such a system must be evolved In :
Congress to expedite the important pro- )
gramme ahead and carry out the party ,
pledges.
HARDING URGES BUREAU
OF AIR NAVIGATION
Washington, Dec. 7.?President Harding
transmitted to Congress to-day the
annual report of the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics with the
recommendation that a bureau for the
regulation and development of air navigation
be established In the Department
of Commerce us proposed by the ci?nmittce.
"I think there can be no doubt," the
President stated In a message which
accompanied the report, "that the development
of aviation will become of
great Importance for the purposes of
commerce as well as national defence.
Aviation Is destined to make great
strides and X believe that America, its
birthplace, can and should be foremost
In its development.
"I therefore urge upon the Congress
the advisability of giving heed to the
recommendations of the committee, the
first and most important of which Is
that a bureau be established in the Department
of Commerce for the regulation
and development of air navigation."

THE N'
SHIP DOGS SAVE GIRL
CLIMBING FOR DOLL
Child Mounted Rail After Toy,
When Police Animals Pulled
Her Back.
The steamship Gdansk of the PoilahAmerlcan
Lfne arrived in New York
yesterday from Danzig, carrying sixteen
passengers, all under 18 years and
orphans, who were being sent to relatives
or friends in this country. It took
thirteen days to make the voyage, an.
Capt. A. M. Peterson said it was the
roughest crossing he ever made, with
the wind reaching a velocity of 120
miles an hour last Thursday. The bad
weather kept up throughout the trip,
and on Tuesday night off Nantucket the
waves swept over the bridge and
smashed the windows of the pilot house.
The children on board, many of whom
were very young, were taken care of
by three police dogs belonging to Capt.
Peterson, which always make the voyage
with him. Five of the children are
members of the family of Hrlndell Zaborowskl
of Philadelphia, and range In
age from Brindell, Jr.. who Is 15, to
Zoata, who is 7. Some one gave
Zeata a handsome doll Just before she
got aboard the ship at Danzig and nc
rafely let It get out of her arms during
the voyage.
About the third day out. however,
Zeata leaned too far over the rail of
the vessel and- her doll slipped from her
arms and fell toward the sea. It caught
on a nail. She started to climb ove.r
the railing, but hnd Just thrown her
leg over wnen Thyrir, one of the police
dogs, which was an almost constant
companion of the child, grabbed her
clothing in his teeth and held on. The
other dogs began barking and Zeata
began screaming and Purser Enrique
Scmatter got mere in time 10 prevera
the child from going overboard Into
the sea. ZeutA was dragged back on
board and lectured so severely that
during the remainder of the trip she
stuck close to the centre of the deck.
And the dogs seemed to know the child
had been in great danger, because after
that when she appeared on deck they
followed her wherever she went.
