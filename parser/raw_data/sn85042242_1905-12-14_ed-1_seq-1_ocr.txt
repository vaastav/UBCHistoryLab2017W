alarming •eihairacten Thousands of
Washington, Dec. 14.—Secretary of
State Root attended the meeting of the
senate committee on foreign relations
during the day. He discussed the bill
introduced by Senator Lodge' providing
for the reorganization (of the consular
service. It is understood that the Isle
of Pines treaty and the treaty relating
to, Santo Domingo were considered
briefly.
The sedtetary of Btate asked that
the consular service be classified and
the president authorized to assign
members of the classes proposed to
such posts'as the interests of the serv­
ice require instead of having appoint­
ments made for specified posts.- The
creation of an adequate inspection
service and the abolishment of the fee
system was recommended by Secre­
tary Root in accordance with the rec
ommendations made by President
Roosevelt in his message to congress.
This would necessitate a matertal in­
crease in salaries at consulates where
the fee system has been followed. An
Increase in working forces was asked
for, the secretary saying that at a
number of foreign posts there are not
sufficient employes for the perform­
ance of duties imposed by the immi­
gration laws. .The need. of suitable
quarters for embassies and legations
was emphasized by the secretary, who
declaied that the poor accommoda­
tions provided detract from the re­
spect to -which-"the diplomatic repre­
sentatives of this government are en­
titled. Secretary Root also asked the
committee to make provision for the
creation of the post of minister to fhe
new kingdom of Norway.

OIL TRUST OF ROBBERY
Ottawa?, Kanu Dec. 14.—Governor E.
W. Hoch, speaking, here at a gather­

"At this time the Kansas oil field is
yielding 60,000 barrels a,day, an insig­

this oil the Standard Oil company,
which sets the price, is paying less
than one-third what it paid a year ago.
I believe it could pay $1 per barrel for
this oil more than it is paying and
still make a large profit. In other
words it is robbing the people of $60,
000 a day, or $22,000,000 a year. We
sit supinely down while we are being
robbed of enough money every day by

TOO MUCH ROCKEFELLER.
Chicago University Professor Turned
Down by Trades Assembly.
Columbus, O., Dec. 14.—Consider­
able comment has been occasioned at
the action of the Columbus trades and
labor assembly in declining to accept
the services of a professor of the Chi­
cago university to deliver a course of
lectures here under the auspices of the
assembly. The assembly was asked to
pay a portion of the expenses of the
professor and the assembly promptly
declined to receive the services of the
Chicago man. The reason given is
that the Chicago university has had
John D. Rockefeller as a benefactor
and It is almost entirely due to his
contributions that the university owes
Its extensiveness and high rank in the
educational world. One of the dele­
gates maintained that the professors
at the University of Chicago had to
teach and stand for the things that
Were favored by the oil magnate and
when they ceased to do this their posi­
tions were jeopardized. In view of
this the proposition was turned down
and a committee consisting of Dele­
gates Phelan, Houck and Little ap­
pointed to arrange for lectures, secur­
ing them from a "source above sus­
picion."
