[By Associated Press.]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.—Senator
Foritker today Introduced a/i
amendment to the bill providing
for the re-enlistment of the negro
troops discharged wlthoui honor be
cause of -illol;i <J participation in the
affary al Brownsville, and addressed
the senate committee concerning the
amendment.
He proposes In ltis new measure to
establish •>■ tribunal consisting of re
tired Wmy officers, before \»hom evi
dence may be submitted as to the guilt
Of defendants and before whom the de
fendants themselves might appear to
a nswer to cha rges.
The measure is so drawn as prac
tically to take out of the hands of the
executive and to give to :. tribunal ap
pointed by congress full authority to
consider the Brownsville questions and
by its findings provide for the re-en
llstmenl of the discharged negroes.
Would Ferret Out Facts
In addressing the senate. Mr. For
aker said that durllfg the summer let
ters had/ been coming to him from
these discharged negro soldiers declar
ing thai detectives were constantly en
gaglng them In conversation. The sen
ator spoke of the activities of the de
tectives as outlined by his conespon-
dents, laying In many cases they went
sci [ar aa to take up tlieir dwelling with
the discharged soldiers for the purpose
tiring their confidence and spying
upon 1 heir movements.
He approved ferreting out the facts,
but declared thai there was a right
way to do it.
Upon tin conclusion of Mr. Foraker's
remarks Mr. Culberson asked that the
president's message on the Brownsville
affair lie read, and Vice President Fair
banks directed that that be done.
All the senators present remained In
their seats, and much interest was
shown in the document.
The President's Message
The text of the president's special
message is as follows:
To the Senate enclose herewith a let
t<-"- from the secretary of war transmitting
a report of the investigation made by Her
bert J. Browne, employed by the depart
n.ent In wn.'nm lion with Captain W. G.
Baldwin to Investigate m far as possible
what happened at Brownsville on tlia 13th
and 14th of August. 1906.
The - report Bu& doculiifoftia- cJfl.juir* *^/i.*«i''
Information of value and some statements
that are obviously worthless, but I submit i
them in thalr entirety.
This report enaoies us to fix with toler
able deflnitenass on at least some of the
'criminals who took the lead in the murderous
1 shooting of rrivate citizens at Brownsville.
It rst.ibllshes clearly the fact that the col
ored eoldiurr dill the shooting; but upon
this point further record was unnecessary,
aa the fact that the 'colored soldiers did
the shooting has already been established
beyond all possibility of doubt.
The investigation has not gone far enough
to enable us to determine all the facts and
we will proceed with it. but It has gone far
enough to determine with sufficient accur
acy certain farts of enough Importance to
make it advisable that 1 «lace the report
before you.
It appears that almost all the members
01 Company B must have been actively con
cerned In the shooting, either to the ex
tent of being participants or to the extent
of virtually encouraging those who were par
ticipants.
Had Knowledge of Crime
As to Companies C and I>, there ran
be no question that practically every man
in them must have had knowledge that
the shooting was done by some of tho sol
diers of B troop, and possibly by one or
two others In one of the other troops.
This concealment was of itself a crave
offense, which was greatly aggravated by
their testifying before the senate commit
tee that they were ignorant of what they
must have "known.
Nevertheless, It is to be said In partial
extenuation that they were, probably cowed
by threats made by the more desperate of
tho men who had actually been engaged In
the shooting, as to what would happen to
any man who failed to protect the wrong-
doors. ■ *
Moreover, there are circumstances tend
ing to .show that these misguided men were
encouraged by outsiders to persist In their
course of concealment and denial.
I feel; therefore, flint the. guilt of the.
men who, after the event, thus shielded
tho perpetrators or the wrong by refusing
to toll the truth about them, though seri
ous was in part due to th« unwise and
improper attitude of others, and Mial soma
measure, or allowance should be made for
the misconduct. •
In other words, I believe we can afford
to reinstate any of these men who now
truthfully tell what lias happened, give all
the aid they can to fix the responsibility
upon those who aro really guilty, and (how
that they themselves had no guilty knowl
edge beforehand and were In no way Impli
cated In the affair, lave bj having knowl
edge of it afterwards and refusing to di
vulge It. *
Sufficiently Punished
Under the circumstances and In view of]
the length of time they have been out of i
the service and their loss of the benetll
that would have accrued to them by con
tinuous long time service, we can afford to j
treat the men who meet the requirements j
given above, as having booh sufficiently pun
ished by tii.i consequences they brought up
on themselves when they rendered neces
sary the exercise or the disciplinary, power.
I recommend that a law be passed allow
ing tho secretary of war, within a fixed
period of time, say a year, to reinstate any
of these, soldiers whom he. after careful
examination.' finds to have been Innocent,
and whom ho ids to have done all In his
power to help bring to justice the guilty.
> Meal hue, the Investigation will be con
tinued. The results have made it ohvlouf
that only by carrying on the Investigation
as the war department has carried it on,
Is there the slightest chance of bringing
tha offenders to justice or of iratln not
tho Innocent, for them were doubtless
hardly any innocent, , but the less guilty
from those hose guilt was heinous.

POLITICAL MEMBERS MAY BE
REMOVED AT LAST
Notorious Southern Pacific Combine
in California Threatened with
Dissolution—New Policy
to Be Adopted
■ rial to The Herald. 1
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.— E. H. Harri
man is said to have derided to rid the
Southern Pacific of its Incubus of po
litical supporters, constituting; the no
torious "S. P. machine." in California
and to adopt an entirely different
policy as to the attludq of his inter
ests in that State toward politics.
This will come as bail news lo a
number of holders of (at places in the
state, but the statement is made
authoritatively that Harrlman has ex
pressed Ills mind forcibly on the ques
tion and that there is no doubt regard
inn the execution of his plan.
The railroad magnate is said to have
decided that tjhe expenxe does not jus
tify the railroad in continuing its pres
ent political system, but even more Im
portant than (his is the fact that he
is said to be Influenced in making ui>
his mind by a clear Idea that the trend
of events will make such a Stand neces
sary sooner or later.
Mr. Harriman shrewdly foresees thai
the public mind is making the lobbying
and legislative methods which he was
pugnaciously Inclined to favor when
he first became prominent In the rail
road world, decidedly out-of-date.
He believes the railroads were com
pelled to adopt the methods which
hnve been used purely in self defense,
bin goes further in thinking that ii
has brought tin-in a sort of composite
Frankenstein in the politicians who
have attached themselves like barnacles
to the railroad treasuries.
Mr. llarriman bellev.ea this is the
psychological tlnje to adopt a con
structlve .nut abovfi-boajfd attitude
ivhlch will not only spell economy, but
will secure public commendation;
Other Lines May Follow
Primarily the Idea will he carried out
in California, but ii means also it will
iir- adopted mi all systems controlled by
iliirrimau. i>r with whloh he is allied.
it is believed other Interests will adopt
b similar ooursei i>ui none other so far
>i;is fell Independent enough to take
the Initiative,
The fact that Harrlman has acquired
large electric Interests In San Fran
cisco and Wan Diego. Whloh he pro
poses to widen, has doubtless had ■
bearing on his decision. He plans to
ask the government for larjre subsidies
to build up .-hipping- on the Pacific
through the Harrlman water lines, but
will do so on the ground of patriotism,
and he thinks by tho time that will be
advisable the sentiment of the. people
will be more friendly to his railroads
through such moves as the one now
contemplated.
The Harriman steamship lines on the
Pacific are said to be losing money
through lack of subsidies, the loss out
of Sun Francisco being reported as
168,000 for last month alone. During
1907 11m- loss was said to he $4tiS,ooo.
Harrlman officials say Japanese ships
c government subsidy amounting
to $75,000, jiaklng competition that
much more difficult for transpacific
American steamships, which receive no
subsidy.

NIGHT SESSION HELD TO EX
PEDITE CASE
AUTHOR'S DEFENSE TO BE AF.
FECTION FOR BROTHER
Counsel Announces That Noted Nau
tical Novelist Will Take the
Stand in His Own
Defense
[By Associated Press.]
FLUSHING, N. V., Dec. 14.—When
court adjourned tonight after two
long sessions consumed in exami
nations of talesmen, six jurors sat In
tiie jury box to try Thornton J. Mains,
author, on charges of being an acces
sory in the killing of William E. An
nis. shot down at. the Bayslde Yacht
club last summer by Captain Peter C.
Haina. jr.
The difficulty of securing a jury be
cause of opinions formed early became
apparent, and Justice Crane decided
that a night session should be held.
The questioning of talesmen by,
Hams 1 counsel Indicated that the de
fense will be based principally on the
proposition that /Thornton, fearing his
brother's life was in jeopardy from Die
crowd at the club house, drew his re
volver and held the crowd back.
His act was one of defense, and not
of offense, according to bis counsel. ?
John Mclntyre of counsel for Halns
announced that Balm would take the
stand In his own defense. He likely
will tell of those ei»nts at Fort Hani-'
iiton which led to the separation of
Captain Hams and his wife and to tha
tragedy.
Mr. Melntyre also will offer in evi
dence the alleged confession made by
Mrs. Claudia Halns to her husband.
What He May Tell
Early court room reports had it 'hat
the defendant would take the witness
stand and lell the entire story of those
occurrences at Fort Hamilton which
counsel for the defense alleges com
