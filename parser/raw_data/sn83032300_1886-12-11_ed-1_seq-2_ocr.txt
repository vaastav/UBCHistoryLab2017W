The committees of the two litmus e'
1U Congress are said te have agreed upon t!i
features of the lnter-state commerce bill
and there is a strong probability th it it will
become ft law. It forbids railroad peeling,
and requires the freight ratis betwtea
points en a railroad's line te be posted at
its stations, and the rates with connecting
railroads te be furnished te the commis
sioners of the government, who shall see te
their publicly. It forbids the charge of a
' greater freight rate for a shorter than for .1
larger haul in the same direction, but
leaves it In the power of the government
officers te modify this rule en proper occa
sions shown.
Commissioner Tmk, who known meie
about railroad freight r.tte working
than any ether man, and who as the com
missioner of the trunk line railroad pooh
proves himself very exceptionally iiuahfied
1 for his pest, thinks that railroad peels
should be encouraged rather thin dis
couraged, the trouble being, as he
conceives, net that railroads agree te the
same,prices, but that they cannot be kept
te them. The public interest rtiiuires that
the prices shall be reasonable, but it also
-.requires that they shall be uniform. And
these are likewise, in the long run. the
railroad's Interests. The true interests of
the railroad are these of their customers,
just as well as the interests of the manufac
turer are these of his empleyes. Commis
' sjqner Pink seems te have the strength
',et the argument. If railroads could
,bq controlled te reasonable charges they
could all bind themselves te charge thc?e
prices with advantage te the public, whose
injury does net come from their combina
tion, but from their u?e of combination for
extortion; and it is because it 13 se liable te
be thus used that the law-makers under
take te forbid it, as the easiest if net the
only way of protecting the public
If Mr. l'ink will show hew ia.lre.id
charges may be made fair by law,
wL.le railroad are allotted te coin
bine, ht will solve the problem ei
their treatment by the law. The general
idea is that competition is the best reliance
of the public against extortion , and for
this reason railroad charters are git en
whenever asked. Hut there is no compe
tition where there is combination , and se
no advantage te the public in the many
railroads.
And in truth many railroads seem te be
a mistake. There is no public advantage
found in chartering competing reads
which are net needed te de the bust,
necs, save the advantage in their compe
tition, which has net been great, m
experience, because of the suLcess with
which it can be choked. If Commissioner
Pink will produce his plan te procure fair
rates from radreads. w itheut cempetiti n.
he will save a great deal of wasted capita'
and be a public benefactor. He has been
undertaking this business himself, as the
voluntary arbiter between the radioed,
and cannot ilatti r himself with the results
in times when there is net enough business
loge around. It has been conclusively
demonstrated that there is nothing se false
te Its engage jaents a3 a railroad corpora
tlen; which is as bereft of honor as of soul.
Mr. rink may think that the hand of the
law will have power te make railroad rates
decent ; but while the law leaves the reads
free te combine, it is a serious question
whether it does net leate thern tee strong
for it.
The prevision of tlu proposal statute
which requires the publication of rates lias
Mr. Tink's unqualified approval. He does
net assent te the reasonableness of the 1 e e
quirement that a charge shall be no greatei
for a shorter than for a larger haul en tin
pame line In the same direction, which he
says will revolutionize the trafllc and cause
an increase in through freights, in erdm
that the companies may preserve thth
pieutable local freight rates. His oimc eimc oimc
tiens are weak in the face of the manifest
injustice of charglug a local rate greater
than a through rate right by the local cus
tomers deer ; and as it is te be presumed
that he advances all that can be advaned
against the propesltion.its beneficence mat
be conceded. Having borne te long the
evecuuve or me railroad ioel, Cem
mlsslener Fink naturally takes a ene-sidt-d
view of the question at issue, aud as his
business will be gene under the new law,
the mildness of his pretest against is strong
evidence of its virtue.

An interesting question is raised by the
suit of the state against the Dubois heir
for the five per cent, collateral inheritance
tax upon the three millions of property
which the aged possessor deeded te his
nephew for a consideration of one dollar
just before he shuffled off his mortal coil
There is no disputing the fact that
no did this te avoid the llve per
cent, tax te the state which falls upon
rintl ?C? by celIatral relations. W.
taxes, and the per centage might be in.
creased te the public advantage, it te a
pecially adapted te just such inheritances
aj that of nephew Dubois of his unci's
millions. The tnillinim " ..' 1
- -...v. uiuie iimn
any man ought te have who does net earn
them, and a nephew has no very
strong natural claim te the Jaw's
Ten of Ida inheritance. Inheritance
1 a gift of the law. In a savage society
a man's appointed successors would uet
be apt te get their succession. The law
steps In and executes a mau's will after he
Is gathered te the tomb. Ver this It Is enti.
tied justly te make a geed charge, and
every Inherltanceef magnitude should bear
a heavy tax. ntidacellaltr.il inheritance
especially, w here the Heed expectation of
coming In should net 1k great. Counseller
Jenks, v.he was the adviser of the original
Dubois, no doubt put him upon the deed,
instead of the will plan of succession . nnd
It remains te be seen whether the evident
intent te defeat the state tax can thus be
executed. We de net think that it can be
done, if the fact is made as apiurent as It
seems te lie, that the deed devlce was
chosen ti defeat the state. The law
does uet leek kindly upon such devices.

Our Kelley will have nothing te de t ith
the free sugar idea of the Republican
enatir. who alighted ujen this as the
b st thihg toelfset against the Democratic
cry for free raw materials. Mr. Kelley
proposes te be consistent, and fails te see
hew a protectionist can be for free sugar.
The agricultural interests he considers te
need piotectien very much just new ; and
he has a vision of beet sugar all ever the
land as a result of his policy. Mr. Kelley
has sugar refining constituents, we believe,
aul puts in a word for them while praying
for the farmers.

While the imperte's et Siuu'n tobacco
continue te have a go . I time of it at the ex
pense of the native .eat, and I y one device or
another get their go is in at i cents, despite
the 75 ceut Intent ei the law, .ingress moves
very slowly in the way or relief. Alter
patiently waiting aud watihing all the par.
llamentary comers of the last suasion, Mr.
Hlsceck, who has tu 1 1 irretive bill in bis
charge, managed te g into sa.'h a position
that en the first day et the preient sssslen he
was entitled te the li , .r te ui'ive for a suspen
sion of the rules and or ng nut et tie ways
and means cemmlttte lias lithe bill, wbii.h
the revenue reform mj irity of that com
mittee was disposed te tnain up :

bundle."
This substitutes ail imported wrappers for
the prosent loopholes, "of which be per cent.is
el the requisite 8lzn,and it the necessary tine,
nesset texture te be su 'abla for wrappers,
and of which mere than one hundred leavis
are required te weigh a ieund"; and it it
pissed would impe.-, tne " , cent tax en all
wrappers. Unfortunately the rea ling of the
message and the announcement et tne deaths
et members crowded Mr. Ht-cock out; and
his turn will net come around again until
Dec. 20. But even should he get his uioilen
up it is deubtiul if the necessary two-thirds
te pass it can be had.
Meantltne comes the president's message
with this suggestion that is construed in
some quarters te be hostile te the proposed
measure .
" Toe government of tne Netherlands bes
exhibited concern in relation te lertalu fes fes fes
turesoreur tarlUlsws.whieh aroauppeiod by
the 11 te be alined at hi lass of tobacco pro pre pro
dueod In the Dutch Past lndius. Cemment
would seem unnecessary upeu the unwisdem
of legislation appearing te have a special
national discrimination ler Its object, which,
although unintentional, may give rise te in
jurious retaliation."
On the contrary the Illscoek amendment
proposes te eliminate all the discrimination
In the existing law und te strlke alike at all
Imported wrappers.
