Wat (Mjk'W Mnme,
Monday Moraine, December 7, 1874.
Perhaps it was not truo that tho last Com
mon Council wished to make something out
of tho Wabash Avenue Railway ordinance.
A careful examination of tho votes on Friday
evening in this connection will bo instructive.
Some of tho wise men at Washington bo-
Uovo that President Grant’s recommendation
of a speedy return to specie payments will
prove to bo a “fire-brand.” Now, “flro
brands” aro not bad when properly applied.
Tho rumor that an offensive and defensive
lUianco has been formed between tho North
ern Pacific, Southern Pacific, aud cotton-tax
lobbies, is worth hearing in mind. It should
be remembered, further, that only a Demo
cratic success at tho next election will make
it possible for such a scheme to succeed.
li is not probable that tlio Senators who
are opposed to tho confirmation of Mr.
Jewell as Postmaster General can make oven
a respectable showing when tho question
comes up for settlement. Mr. Jowell has
already shown himself to bo an Executive
officer of whom tho Republican party has
reason to bo proud.
Dr. Fowler and his advisers havo made
many serious blunders in tho management of
tho Northwestern University, -but nono of
them was so bad os the order excluding tho
young ladies from the literary meetings of
tho male students. Some more delicate
method of accomplishing this end than a
plain intimation of distrust of tho young
ladies was certainly possible.
Gentlemen who don’t go much into politics
may need to bo reminded that tho lost session
of the Forty-third Congress begins to-day.
Gen. Butler has made a programme for tho
guidance of tho House, but we hope to see
tho leadership in better bauds. The Repub
lican members of this House should tako core
to make for it a record which their Demo
cratic successors will not bo likely to surpass.
It is probable that tho Hon. J. B. Rice, of
this city, will not be able to take his sent upon
the reassembling of Congress for several
weeks yet, A private letter from Norfolk,
Vo., brings tho unwelcome intelligence that
ho is laid up at present with a sharp attack
of sickness, from which ho is just beginning
to recover, While fortunately iibt serious
enough to cause his friends any anxiety, it is
enough to place him hors tie combat for a
time. His absence from tho Capitol will
therefore bo understood.
W’hat purports to bo, and very likely is, a
synopsis of the President’s Message is fur
nished this morning to tho Associated Press.
It appears from it that tho President will
suggest tbo wisdom of interference in
Cuba to terminate the insurrection;
recommend tho resumption of specie-pay
ments at tho earliest practicable day, leaving
Congress to say when that will bo ; urge de
cisive action in the Louisiana and Arkansas
cases j and commend tho Indian Peace Policy
and the Civil-Servico Reform experiment.
Surely there is nothing very startling in this.
Tho vindictiveness of tho German UUra
moutanos is shown by tho fierce attack which
was made upon tho Gorman Government by
tho.Ultramontane Deputies on Saturday last
for suppressing tho Legation at tho Vatican.
Tho same step had previously been taken by
England, which removed its representative to
Lisbon without oven protest or criticism, but
tho moment Germany took tho same stop it
was followed by the grossest misrepresenta
tions and most bitter vindictiveness and
abuse. Tho action of the German Govern
ment was based upon tho very best of rea
sons, So long as Germany recognizes the
Pope as tho head of the Catholic Church, and
this Blsmnrk himself affirms to bo tho fact,
there is no other recognition duo him from
Germany, or in fact from any other
country. Tho Pope being no longer
a temporary ruler, it is only a
useless expense, and subserves no purpose
whatever, as negotiations with the Pope, if
they become necessary, can bo conducted
through the regular Ambassador to Italy. In
addition to this fact, a representative from
tho Gorman Government at tlio Vatican is an
insult to the Government of Victor Emanuel,
with which Germany is in harmonious rela
tions. Germany has still another reason for
withdrawing her representative from the Vat
ican which does not apply to any other Govern
ment, namely, that tho Pope continues to
urge tho aatholio clergy not only to break iho
laws of Germany themselves, but to advise
their congregations to do tho same. There
is, therefore, no reason why Germany should
bo at tho expense of maintaining a represent
ative at tho Vatican ; on tho other hand,
thereto every reason why she should not.

The Bov. A. E. Kittrcdgo preached last
night on a text furnished by Tun Tiudonb
last Monday morning. His effort was to
show that “a liberal and comprehensive edu
cation " cannot purify society. Wo under
stand 1 Mr. Kittrcdgo to moan that no
oducation\ whatever—not even tho in
struction >\ of tho Ghuroh or tho
revelations of God—are sufficient for tho reali
zation of a perfect society. This can only bo
accomplished,' Mr. Kittrcdgo believes, by tho
workings of tlie Holy Spirit in tho heart.
Wo should say.that thodlsoussion, when it is
carried to this point, has only a speculative
interest, and not much of that.
THE iiW AHB THE FACTS.
Ono of tho instructions given by Judge
Murphy to tlio jury in tlio Gngo case bos
dmwn attention to a serious error in our
statutory provisions governing the verdict of
the jury in criminal trials. The discussion
of it may Uopofully lead to a reform. The
instruction was on the part of the defease,
and ns follows:
Firal—Tho Court hialnicls the Jury that they ore the
Judges of tho law nud tho fuels In this case, ami that
they aro not bound by the opinion of tho Court as to
what the law Is, and they am assume tho responsibility
of deciding, each Juror for himself, what tho law is.
This is tho most literal construction of a
statute passed ns long ago ns 1815, which
roads ns follows: “Juries in all criminal cases
shall bo judges of tho law nud the fact.”
Judge McAllister, in a recent imblio letter on
the accumulation of cases in the Supremo
Court, referred incidentally to this statutory
provision as a relic of the formative period
of our existence as a State, ns an experiment
which might have been adapted to the back
woods, Democratic tendencies of that time,
but which Ims been found to work to. tho dis
advantage of a more populous, advanced, aud
organized condition. This is just what it is,
and tho wonder is that it Ims been allowed to
remain so long on tho statute-books. It is a
rule which enforces every Circuit Court
in the State to work by contraries.
It loaves tho “Court” just what Judgo
John 31. Wilson designated him under
this law, —in the position of a “ Moderator
of a town meeting.” As in the Gage case, ho
may exercise his judicial functions through
out the trial up to tho time of giving tho case
to tho jury, nud thou all his judicial learning
and experience are found to count for noth
ing. Ho may rule out evidence, interpret
the application of tho law to tho case in hand,
lay down tho principles and recall the stat
utes, and, at tho very last, he is forced into
tho inconsistent and ridiculous position of
telling the jury that they need pay no atten
tion to his interpretations aud rules, but must
judgo, each nma for himself, of tho law and
its application. This is a logical contradic
tion, and its practical operation is a serious
impedhqent to justice inmoru ways than one.
Tho common-law rule, and tho practice
in a majority of tho States, is that tho Court
shall ho tho judgo of the law and tho jury
the judgo of tho facts. This principle is
founded in common sense, and has been jus
tified in tho practice of England, Canada, and
tho greater number of tho United Slates
whore it has obtained. It Is the natural and
proper division of judicial responsibility. Tho
Judges aro elected mainly with reference to
their legal learning nud experience. Person-*
ul integrity is not of itself a sufficient quali
fication for a judicial position, though it is an
essential. A man is needed to preside over
trials, not merely for tho purpose of keeping
order in court, which could bo done by
a bailiff, but to keep counsel down
to tho law aud prevent them from
imposing on the jury; to decide . between
adverse legal positions taken by the
opposing attorneys; to protect the interests
of tho people as well as the interest of tho
accused in criminal causes; and, above all, at
tlio cud of llie case, to sum up in an intelli
gent and impartial manner the application of
the law ns it is to the facts ns the jury may
find them. The responsibility put upon the
jury of determining the facts from the evi
dence before them is just ns reasonable as
that part of the responsibility •which the
Court should bear* The jury consists of
twelve men instead of one. The danger of
personal prejudice is lessened in the ratio of
12 to 1. To judge of facts from evidence
that the Court has hold to he competent Is n
laslc that may bo safely intrusted to ig
norant men, if it so happen. It re
quires simply the exercise of common
sense and fair dealing, and it is
not necessary that there should he any famil
iarity with law. As a matter of fact the
great majority of jurymen know nothing of
law, never saw a statute-book, and never
heard oven of Coke or Hlaokstono, Chitty or
Greenlenf. It is sheer folly and absolute dan
ger to invest such men with the right of pass
ing upon the law, of which they know
nothing, and applying its principles, which
they are likely to distort, to facts that may
thus bo made to lose their force aud bearing.
As a rule, the best work a Legislature can do
for a State is to repeal laws, and the Legisla
ture which convenes this winter should repeal
the statute of 1815, and substitute one just
as brief, which shall rend: “ The Court in nil
cases shall bo the judge of tho .law aud the
jury tho judge of tho facts."
At. the same time the Legislature does this,
it should also repeal a statute of 1817 which,
in its application, permits the attorneys on
tho other side to dictate tho instructions to
tho jury. If there is any sphere iu which a
Judge can make himself useful, it is by moans
of a clear elucidation aud a fair summing
up of tho evidence. An accomplished and
honest Judge can do more toward straighten
ing out the complications of a case than a
hundred one-sided arguments by counsel.
Tho operation of tho present system is to
promote laziness aud indifference on the part
of tho Judges, who are now content to allow
tho attorneys to suggest tho instructions on
either side, which are presented to the jury
in a contradictory and confusing shape. Tho
rule was adopted originally, perhaps, as tho
President originally began to call upon Con
gressmen to recommend official appointments
hi their districts. Hut as iu tho latter case
tho Congressmen have come to regard them
selves as possessed of tho right of appoint
ment, so now tho attorneys dictate the in
structions, Tho result iu both cases is per
nicious,—in tho one to tho civil service aud In'
tho other to justice.
Ashlo from tho positive injustice that arises
from the operation of those two old illogical
statute;:, their existence is tho principal cause
for *lllO overloading of tho Supremo Court
doo!:e(. ami the cumbor-ome and endless sys
tem of litigation which prevails in this otate,
THE CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE: MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1874,
It is entirely reasonable, under the present
law, to deny motions for new trials without
reference to tho injury done to law and
justice by tho verdict. Tho Court naturally
argues that the jury are made by statute tho
judges of tho law; aud, having passed upon
it, tho only recourse is an appeal. Thus tho
Supromo Court is constantly asked to review
absurd verdicts which would never havo boon
rendered if tho Judge could have exorcised
his natural functions of interpreting the law
and instructing tho jury accordingly. It is
evident that tho next Legislature can do a
good work by repealing those old statutes.
THE SUPREME COURT—EXCEPTIONS AND
USELESS OPINIONS.
■ Tho reduction of tho bill of oxcoptions to
something lilco its proper proportions would
doubtless meet with tho enthusiastic oppoai
iiou of all tbo Circuit Court Clerics through*
out tho State. In tho groat majority of
cases tho bill of oxcoptions constitutes by
far tho largest portion of tho record. For
copying It into tho record, tho dorks charge
a certain sum per job, tfr page, and tho busi
ness is profitable. Copyists can bo hired
Tory cheaply, and tho margin between the
amount paid by tho Clerks to their copyists
and tho amount received from tho party or
dering tho record is very liberal. For tho
record to which reference was made in a
former article tho Cleric charged and re
ceived s<l2o, while tho entire expense in
curred by tho Cleric did not, in all probability,
exceed sio. At all events, tho work con bo
done for that sum. There are doubtless a
largo number of lawyers who would pro
tost against tho proposed change. Tho
present system is tho lazy man’s method.
Tho preparation of a bill of oxcoptions
at present demand from tho attorney neither
labor nor brains. Tho work is performed by
the shorthand reporter, and all that tho at
torney ambitious to tako a case to the Su
premo Court has to do by way of preparation
is to take a transcript of the shorthand re
porter's notes and file them as his bill of ex
ceptions. Under tho proper system, however,
ho would be compelled to know something
about his case, and to bo able to put that
knowledge into shkpo. If bo bad any points
upon which an appeal ought to bo taken, ho
would have to present them. If ho were un
able to do lhis himself, ho would be driven to
one of two alternatives : to hire some lawyer
who could do it, or for tho while turn student
and learn. Tho general public, the parties
themselves, and tho Court would hardly look
upon his situation as one calling for very
active sympathy. But, asido from tho
reforms which we have indicated, others
of groat importance can bo suggested.
Tho Supremo Court ought not to be
required to write opinions in every case
brought before them, nor should a ritual of
tho cause upon its merits bo expected atibcir
hands. 'Whore the judgment of the Court
below is against evidence, they should re
verse it, but it ought not to he demanded by
them to review more questions of fact where
tho evidence was conflicting. There are
scores of cases taken to that Court, at every
term, which involve questions of no earthly
consequence to any one except tho parties.
Those cases involve no legal principles and
frequently present no legal questions what
ever. In these tho Court should not bo re
quired' to write opinions, nor should such
coses bo reported. In a recent volume of the
Illinois Reports there are thirty-one cases re
ported, and some of them at length, which
are of no conceivable importance to tho pub
lie or to tbo profession. In neither of those
cases should written opinions have
been required, nor should either of these
cases have been reported. To tho Court
should be left tbo privilege of determining in
what cases opinions should bo written and
what cases should bo reported. Thus tho
labors of tbo Court might bo greatly lessoued,
tbo number of reports reduced, and their ac
tual valuo greatly enhanced. It is useless,
and worse than useless, to cumber our re
ports with cases which present questions
v, Inch have been repeatedly passed upon. Of
what conceivable use is an opinion of tho
Supremo Court detailing at groat length tho
evidence in a enuso before them, and finally
reaching tho conclusion that, as tho evidcuco
is conflicting, they will not disturb tho judg
ment of tho Court below? What interest has
tho public or the profession in knowing
that in a particular case tho judgment
appealed from hod, in tho opinion of tho
Supremo Court, no evidence whatever tosup
port it? Undoubtedly such a conclusion pos
sesses groat interest to the parties litigant,
but tho general public and tho profession at
largo derive from reading such opinions
neither instruction nor amusement. It is a
dreary, expensive, and useless waste of time
to compile such reports, and a useless and
onerous tax upon tho public to publish them.
Tho Supremo Court can, with entire safety,
be intrusted with tho responsibility of do
tovmining in what coses they will write opin
ions, and what opinions shall bo published.-
There is no Judge at present upon
that Bench, nor is there likely to
bo in the future, who has not
sufficient ambition to promote and
establish for himself a judicial reputation to
rembft it perfectly certain that ho will havo
all his own opinions published which ho may
think possess any proper claim for publica
tion. Tho danger will rather bo that they
would not exorcise this power even if they
possessed it to tho extent that they might
be well justified in doing. Our Supremo
Court as at present constituted is a body of
very able, but exceedingly careful, prudent,
and conservative gentlemen. Their prudence,
indeed, sometimes looks very much like
timidity. They havo submitted to tho im
positions of shorthand reporters* notes
—misnamed bills of exceptions—with a
degree of patience and forbearance
really wonderful. They have suffered
themselves to bo buried beneath ab
stracts which wore such only iu name,
and which wore iu fact substantial copies
of tho entire record, and this, too,
oven in tho face of their own rules. Know
ing tbo entire faithfulness with which every
member of that Court is devoted to tho dis
charge and performance of his duties, and
knowing, too, how onerous those duties are,
wo would aid them by legislation iu every
ogitiumto manner. But they can do xnuoh
to help themselves, and whatever they can
do they must do. You need* a little more
courage, gentlemen. Bring tho lazy lawyer
to time, and compel him to reduce his cases
to something like their proper form and
thoir proper proportions. If ho cannot or
will not do this, send him and his case
out of court. Attempt to decide no moro
oases than you cun thoroughly examine
ami decide to your entire satisfaction
and credit. You aro not responsible
for tho ■ sizo of tho docket, and this
lire public perfectly well understand.
Encourage oral arguments, and thou decide
when tho argument is fresh In your minds.
The docket may fall far behind, but it is more
I satisfactory to wait a year for the argument
of a cause aud have a decision immediately
upon tho argument, than it is to argue it at
once and wait a year for tho decision.
Lay on your penalties for vexatious ap
peals without fear, aud, with tho legislative
assistance which wo have pointed out and
plenty of norvo on your own part, you will
do much good and bo happy.
MORE WORDS WITH A PROHIBITIONIST,
Wo have received a second and lengthy
communication from Mr, J. W. Hanson rela
tive to tho question “ Does Prohibition Pro
hibit ?” nud in answer to a recent editorial In
Tub Tribune touching upon hia first com
munication.
Tho first letter of Mr. H. was in search of a
controversy. Ho made his points, artfully, na
ho supposed, but aophistically, ns was shown.
Tlio matter should thou have rested ns be
tween him and Tub Tribune, ns ho had his
say and said his argument. Wo have not
space for an amplification of his second let
ter, and will only extract so much of it ns
presents a now argument or reason for pro
hibition.
Mr. Hanson says:
You proceed to represent meat advocating laws pro
hibiting drinking. Not at all. Ilia the aalo end not
tho use that tho law concerns Itself with, and that
Prohibitionists would Inhibit. Men nay drink beer,
older, whisky, if they will, bat to sreest tbo mischief
wrought by tho business, (ho law, to protect tho pub
lic, soys it shall not bo sold. In tho caso of diseased
meat, no statute prohibits any ono from eating, but bo
may not sell. Ho may eat cnirlou, but tho law pro
hibits him to open a shop to sell it. If you can prove
that tainted meat has boon thofavorllo food of entire
tribes aud nations, as it is of norao, to-day, you aro no
less a transgressor if you vend tho article in o docent
community,—an article whoso evil effects aro nothing
compared with those of liquor.
Wo nro glad that Tue Tribune’s position
on Prohibition has elicited one positive state
ment from tho Prohibitionists, nud wo stick
a pin in it right horo for future reference.
“Mon may drink beer, oidor, whisky, if
they will.” It is not tho drinking, then, but
tho selling of liquor that the Prohibitionists
nro bent upon stopping, aud which they
claim they have tho right to atop. Now let
us see about tho soiling. No ono but a fanat
ic will deny that wine, boor, cider, aud other
liquors ate tho produce of tho earth, adapted
to use by man's, labor; that those products
havo their use in satisfying certain wishes nud
appetites of men, and that this use has boon
recognized from immemorial times; and that
tho vast majority of men use them without
injuring themselves or others, and
havo a natural right to those products,
which aro in fact their property. Tho
drinker is tho principal,* tho seller is
only his agent. If men did not drink
aud desire to ho supplied with liquor, there
would bo no sellers. Tho liquor-seller is only
an agent who supplies > tho consumer with
certain fluids which he wants. If anybody is
at fault in tho promises, it is tho drinker, but
the Prohibitionist says ho has tho right to
drink. If, therefore, tho drinker has tho
right to drink or use this property ns ho sees
fit, by what authority can the Prohibitionist
or a Legislature say to tho agent, You shall
not sell a man property in which ho has a
natural right? But, says Mr. Hanson, “in the
case of diseased moats no statute prohibits
any ono from eating, but ho may not soil.
Ono may cat carrion, but tho law forbids any
ono to open a shop to sell it.” This is a
shrewd attempt to escapo by sophistry.
Tho law forbids tho snlo of diseased meat be
cause it is an imposition and a fraud upon
tho purchaser and the public. The vender
of diseased mont defrauds his customer, cheats
and swindles him, by passing off an unsound
and worthless article for a .and sound
one upon him. Tho man who buys his
liquor knows what ho gets and gets what he
pays for. If ho pays a cheap price ho gets a
.cheap article. If ho pays a largo pricoho gets
a valuable article. Every man who buys
liquor knows what ho is buying, nud gets
what ho considers an equivalent for his money.
Tho man who buys diseased meat docs not
know what ho is buying, and is consequently
defrauded in pocket os well as injured in
health.
The remainder of Mr. Hanson’s communi
cation is argued upon the basis that the use
of liquor must be forbidden because it in-
volvcs a danger to society and is adverse to
tho public welfare, and in the course of it be
returns to tho original proposition, as follows
I agree with you that moil havo generally resorted
to stimulants, and that the great majority of them be
lieve iu drinking. They seem to believe la many
things that are wrong nod wioked, but I havo not ob
served that The Tiudune advocates licensing them to
follow tbo heat of their inclination.
It would ho useless to argue this point over
again. We havo once exposed its fallacy,
and that fallacy is, that men believe in drink
ing because they do not know, feel, or believe
that drinking is wrong, or wicked, or crimi-
nal, and therefore do not know, feel, or be
lieve that they should bo restricted from or
punished lor drinking, or that their agents
should bo restricted from or punished for
soiling to them liquor. Tho additional point
made by Mr. Hanson is, that tho use of ar
dent spirits is averse to tho public welfare,
therefore it must bo stopped.
This assertion will not stand analysis. Tho
“public welfare” is not put in issue by rea
son of one person in a hundred drinking to
excess aud becoming intoxicated. There is
not a natural right that men possess which
might not ho taken away from them upon
tho ground that they should surrender their
rights because certain individuals abused
them and perverted them to bad purpose,
and bonce tho “public welfare " required tho
ninety-nine to bo deprived of the use of a
tiling which did not injure them or cause
them to injure others, lest the hundredth
man should abuse his privilege and do evil
to himself and others. A conclusion of this
kind, drawn from such promises, is called in
logic a non sequitur.
It is admitted that the great majority of
tho people, tho world over, have from time
immemorial boon in tho habit of usiug
stimulants temperately, and that only a small
per cent of tho whole have consumed liquor
iutomporatoly. Then by what right or
authority do a handful of intermeddling
people presume to say to tho vast moss of
mankind, or of tho American people, “You
shall not ho permitted to drink any more ;
no man shall bo allowed to sell to you, under
pains and penalties of a law wo propose to
enact, because some men drink to excess.”
By what authority do they make them
selves tho judges of what temperate people
shall eat and drink, and presume to exercise
ah absolute rule over the desires or appetites
of those whoso desires and appetites are kept
within duo bounds, and do no harm to them
selves or society? By what authority do
they propose to stop a thousand men from
drinking because ton men drink too much?
Tho presumption is an impudent and im
pertinent ono. If they have tho authority to
prohibit tho exercise of one natural right,
thou they can prohibit the use of all tho
natural rights, since any natural right may
be carried to excels and prove dangerous to
tbo Individual who cannot restrain his In
dulgence thereof.
THE LEGAL-TENDER ACT.
A recent decision of the United States Su
premo Court in the case of the Baltimore A
Ohio Railroad t’j?. The State of Maryland,
which has escaped general notice, reaffirms
the constitutionality of the Legal-Tender act
ns applied to obligations contracted prior to
the passage of the not, Fob. HH, 18G2. To
trace briefly the history of tho Supremo
Court's construction of this act*. It will bo re
membered ibnt Chief-Justice Gbaso, in bia
opinion in tbo case of Hepburn vs, Griswold,
in which ho was sustained by a majority of
the Court, declared that portion of tho act
unconstitutional which made debts contracted
prior to its passage poynblo in Treasury notes.
Chief-Justice Chase’s former position m Sec
retary of tho Treasury, and his identifica
tion with tho Treasury-note system, gave his
decision in this caso peculiar force; but n
large portion of tho politicians saw fit to
give it a partisan significance. This gained
ground, probably, through tho coquetting of
tho Democrats with Judge Chase os a Presi
dential candidate, and a portion of tho Re
publican party thought it was necessary to
resent this expression by overruling tho de
cision. Thero was shortly after a vacancy
on the Supremo Bench, but tbo filling of this
place alone would , not secure a majority of
tho Court. Congress then added one to tbo
number of Supremo Judges, and Messrs.
Bradley and Strong were appointed Associate
Justices. On May 1,1871, tho Supremo Court
rendered decisions in tho cases of Knox vs.
Lee, and Parker vs. Davis, which reversed tho
opinion of Chief-Justice Chase and affirmed
tho constitutionality of that portion of tho
act declaring Treasury notes to bo legal ten
der for all debts contracted prior, as well as
those contracted after, tbo passage of the act,
unless payment in coin was expressly stipu
lated.
Tho late decision in tho case of tho Balti
more & Ohio Railroad really goes further
than tho former decisions of the Court in this
direction, since tho objection to pay in gold
was strongly implied, if not indeed provided
for in express terms. The case was as fol
lows: In 183/1, tho General Assembly of
Maryland authorized a State subscription of
$3,000,000 to tho stock of the Baltimore &
Ohio Railroad on condition that tho road should
pay an annual interest of G per cent on that
amount out of its earnings. To raise the
money tho State ‘issued $3,000,000 bonds
bearing G per cent interest. Tho Commis
sioners sent to Europe to negotiate these
bonds failed in their mission. In 1838, tho
General Assembly ■ authorized an issue of
sterling bonds, bearing fi per cent interest,
payable in gold in London, and the Company
accepted these bonds in exchange for the G
per cent bonds, thereby accepting the condi
tion of paying tho 5 per cent interest in gold
in London. As a matter of fact, the Com-
pany did pay this interest, and it was to their
advantage until greenback began to depreci
ate and exchange became very high. Xu 1870,
tho Company figured up that tho difference
they had paid between tho gold interest and
the same reckoned in greenbacks amounted
to $281,481). They wore under an obligation
to pay tho State one-fifth of tho gross
receipts from passengers on the Wash
ingtoa branch of tho road. Tins they
withhold to offset tho difference as above,
claiming that they wore obliged to pay
only in greenbacks. Tho State, under
tho instructions of the General Assembly,
brought suit for this amount, and tiio State
Court rendered a decision favorable to the
State. This was revised by the Court of Ap
peals under the Supreme Court's decisions
of 1871. Tho State appealed to tUo
United States Supreme Court, which sus
tained tho Court of Appeals, aud held that
tho Company might pay in Treasury notes
and could not bo compelled to pay in gold.
By this decision the State of Maryland is re
quited to pay tho difference between tho
gold interest and the same interest in green
backs,“-amounting to nearly SOOO,OOO.
It will bo noted that this latest decision
really goes further than tho first, since tho
acceptance of tho second issue of sterling
bonds was a virtual agreement to pay tho fi
percent interest in'gold. Notwithstanding
this strong presumption of the Company’s
agreement to pay in gold, it is held that the
$3,000,000 was originally borrowed from tho
State, that the interest was due the State, and
that it could therefore bo paid in greenbacks
os being legal tender for all debts. This is
oil very well, so far as consistency goes; but
how will it be if, in the future, the character
of tho Supremo Court shall bo remodeled
again with a spccillo application to tho Legal-
Tender act? Probably the speediest way of
escaping from tho complications is to fix a
detlnito and early date for the repeal of tho
Legal-Tender act. Wo may then escape in.
time from tho old difficulties, and there will
certainly bo no new ones arising in tho fu
ture.
REVOLUTIONARY SHINPLABTEB3.
Mr. J. W. Schuckers, who is making a name
ns an exact aud able writer on matters of
iinauco, has published another pamphlet on
the monetary history of this country during
tho Revolution. It is good reading for tho
irredeemable-greenback lovers of to-day. Of
course it tells tho old, old story all over again.
Tho issue of irredeemable rags adorns but
one theme, —inflation, depreciation, specula
tion, smash. But the details of what our
forefathers did in *7(l point a needed moral
for their descendants in 1871.
The socoud Continental Congress mot May
10, 1770. War was inevitable. ’Where wore
its sinews to bo found? The idea of raising
money by taxation was rejected, because the
revolt was against taxation, and it was
thought that the people would be impartially
disgusted by a tax laid by Congress or King.
Moreover, Congress had no real power to tax.
It therefore adopted the easy expedient of
“ making money ” out of paper and ink. The
presses wore sot running, and a nominal
value of $0,000,000 was,thrust on the coun
try in the shape of oblong bits of paper.
Tliia was in 1770. A speedy termination of
the war was expected, and it was reasonable
to suppose that the united Colonies would re
deem this small amount. There was, there
fore, no depreciation. In 1770, when
cho Declaration of Independence had
mado a long and bloody struggle
certain, $10,000,000 more was Issued,
and depreciation began. The Tories openly
rejected the currency, declaring (what was
indeed true) that it would never bo redeemed.
The Whigs wore loth to take the bills and
“ paid them out os promptly as was consist
ent with a respectable regard for tbo cause. 11
Gold and silver vanished. The artificial
value of the currency grow loss, day by day.
Three causes hastened the process. Com
gross threw a new loan on the market in the
shape of interest-bearing bonds. These cir
culated from hand to hand os currency, and
by their depreciation made that of the non*
interest-bearing bills groator still. Moreover,
•tbo several States issued scrip about as fast
as it could bo printed. Its worth sank to
nothing and it carried tho national currency
down with it. Tho third cause of decline was
tho frantic zeal of Congress to prevent de
cline. Its laws made a refusal to rocoivo
tho bills operate ns a discharge of tho debt,
and declared that persons who refused them
or tried in anyway to hinder their circulation
should bo “ precluded from all trado and in
tercourse " with other Americans,—should
bo, in fact, outlawed. By the spring of ’77,
when tho paper dollars were quoted at 50
cents, Congress resolved,with grave asininUy,
that they should thereafter pass for coin dol
lars at par. Incredible as it may seem, they
did not obey tbo mandate of this august
body. They flouted it, in foot, by sinking
lower and lower. Then Congress and tho
States fixed tho prices at which, commodities
should sell, in paper, and found, to their
groat astonishment, that tho rebellious com
modities poidno attention to their decrees, and
persisted in soiling for a groat deal more than
tho lawful rates. It should interest Senator
Oglesby to know that “blood-sealing'' did
not help the case a bit. No matter how much
tho army fought, bled, and died, tho legal
tenders dropped down with unvarying regu
larity, It should, however, bo recorded to
the eternal credit of the Continental Congress
that it finally stopped short Wits folly, voted
that it would not, under any circumstances,
have more than $200,000,000 of currency out
at any one time, and kept its word. When tho
post-inflation stage of depreciation had been
fairly reached,spcculatiouswollod into gigantic
proportions. Debts incurred to-day could bo
paid to-morrow in “ money " that had fallen
10 to 50 per cent in tho interim. Dishonesty
was rampant. Schuckers quotes from Gor
don's History of tho Devolution as follows:
All classes were infected. The paper produced a
rape for speculation. The mcclionlc, the farmer, tbo
lawyer, physician, members of Congress, and in some
places even a few of tbo olorgy, wore contaminated.
Tbo morals of tbo people were corrupted beyond any
thing that could have been believed prior to tbo event.
All ties of honor, blood, gratitude, humanity, and
justice, were dissolved. Old debts were paid when
(ho paper money was more than seventy for oao.
Brothers defrauded brothers, children their parents,
und parents their children. Widows, orphans, ana
others wore paid for money lent In specie with depre
ciated paper, aud were compelled to receive it.
Tho mania of dishonest speculation de
pressed the value of the currency more and
more. In 1782, n paper dollar, to tho re
demption of which in specie tho public faith
was pledged, passed for less than one-fifth of
a cent] This was the end. Tho money
ceased to circulate and became merely a
curiosity. Stagnation came upon trade. Tho
people wore bitterly poor. The cycle of tho
shinplastcrs was complete. They had led to
infiatiou, depreciation, speculation, smash.
GEAVE'BOBBINQ AND MEDICAL SCHOOLS.
The medical school of the University of
Michigan, at Ann Arbor, seems to have got
itself into trouble again on account of the
bodies it has been forced to buy for dissect
ing purposes. Tliis discussion comes up
periodically, and a great huo-and-cry is made
with every revival of it. It may bo admitted
at the outset that it is a very horrible thing to
rob graves, and the authorities of every
medical school who buy cadavers without
knowing where they come from are apt to
encourage this desperate and revolting sys
tem of spoliation. To this extent their con
duct is reprehensible. Cut we must also
meet this question with the recognized ne
cessity for providing medical schools with
dead bodies for dissection 5 and, in this, we
ore forced to the conclusion that the State
authorities must share the guilt which attaches
to the robbing of graves whenever they fail
to provide decent and legal means for obtain
ing tho bodies. The great trouble in this
whole controversy is a silly abhorrence to tho
consideration of a subject which, if not
altogether affected, is the growth of tradi
tional prejudice,
Wo must start out with tho admission that
the medical schools must have bodies for dis
section. Science demands it. Life aud health
demand it. The law really demands it. The
statutes of almost all tho States provide
penalties for malpractice. As long as a
surgeon is liable to imprisonment for cutting
the wrong artery, it is unjust and cruel to
deprive him of the mcaus of learning how
to dissect the hmnan body, or to force
him to barter with the grave-robbers
for his material. The State is constant
!ly called upon to support criminals,
| paupers, and insane persons during their lives,
and to defray tho expenses of their interment
after death. There should bo in every State
provision for turning their , bodies over to the
medical schools whenever they are not
claimed by relatives or friends. Tho deceased
have been, at the best, a drag upon the Stato,
and sometimes worse. If they have not ac
tually been marauders on society as crim
inals, they have sapped tho resources of the
State for their support, and have in no way
returned an equivalent. If their empty
frames, after death, can afford any compen
sation for the sendee rendered them during
life, they should be used for this purpose,
There is not tho slightest tinge of sentiment
that can give a coloring to tho opposite view.
Hero are bodies which no man nor woman
cares for. If lowered into tho pau
per’s grave, they decay and become
food for worms. If transferred to the
dissecting-room, they contribute more to tho
progress of science and surgical knowledge
than they over contributed In life to their
own good or tho welfare of the community.
From a more sentimental view of the ques
tion, we can see no choice between a horrible
dissolution in the society of worms and a
cloon-cut dissection, unless it bo in favor
of the latter, llespoot for tho feeling of rel
atives aud deference to tho wide-spread
prejudices of society render it wrong to de
mand tills from those who provide for them
selves in life and who are provided for by
tbeir friends in death. But, whore those
bodies ore tho property of tho commonwealth,
become so by the positive right of support
while living end the negotivo right found m
tho absence of any other claims when dead,
then they should bo used for the common
beuolli of mankind in tho medical schools.
With regard to tho Ann Arbor University,
wo believe that tho law of Michigan author
izes this use of tho bodies of criminals who
die, but that tho officers of tho jails aud
penitentiaries have persistently refused to
deliver tho bodies upon the application of tho
schools. Some penalty ought to bo provided
for such refusal. The simple fact is that tho
schools must have bodies for dissection, and,
if tho Stato does not provide some other
means for obtaining them, tbe graveyards
will continue to bo pillaged, and tho publio
will have to boar these periodical outbreaks
of disgust. The first thing to do is to over
come the absurd squcamisbucsß which most
of us are apt to entertain with reference to
tho subject. Considerations of science aud
personal health are much more important
than tho disposition of a lifeless body which
nobody cares to claim, and which never ron*
dared tho world a service until it gave up the
ghost. The “ Jerry Crunchers ” will never
disappear until the State Legislatures provide
adequately for tho dlsscctlng-schools.
THE PITTSBURG STKIKE,
Tho late troubles iu Pennsylvania are get
ting worse. Wo have from time to time noted
tho stoppage of tho coal mines, particularly
in tho anthracite districts, by which many
thousands of men have boon put out of work.
Even iu their destitute circumstances they re
fuse to work temporarily or lot others do so
at less than tho rales they received when the
demand for coal was great. Wo now have
tho case of the puddlors in Pittsburg. The
demand for iron since tho panic has steadily
declined, and tho prices have fallen nearly
one-third. Tho production has declined, thus
operating on the demand for coal, Tho
Pittsburg manufooturors, unable to sell their
iron at all except at greatly reduced prices,
have tried to avoid closing their mills, hut to
do so must reduce their wages. Various
schemes have been proposed, but the pud
dlors have been inflexible. They have re
fused any concession, demanding tho some
wages as heretofore. Tho result Is that there
is a dead-look, the mills being closed and
tho puddlcrs out of work. Tbo closing of
tho iron mills outs off the demand for coal
and for iron ore, and necessitates not only
the suspension of work by the puddlors, but
by tho minors of ore and of cook It is esti
mated that 100,000 men are thus suddenly
deprived of work at tho veiy threshold of
winter. Onoo suspended, these works will
be slow to resume, There are immense
stocks of iron on hand equal to meet the de
mand until spring, so the closing of tho
mills will not prove so disastrous to tho man
ufacturers, and the whole weight of tho dis
aster will fall upon tho workmen themselves.
In some parts of Pennsylvania, a few work
men have accepted employment at the re
duced wages, but tho multitude refuse.
Four-flfths of tho working-classes connected
with the coal mines and iron works in the
Scranton region have boon out of employ
ment for thirty or sixty days. Labor in all
this branch of industry may bo said to bo
idle in Pennsylvania.
Wo have no sympathy with corporations
that cut down tho wages of their laborers
wantonly ond for the sake of swelling their
own profits. But tho panio has stricken tho
iron trade more severely than all others, and
of necessity in that State has reduced tho de
mand for ore, and especially for coal. Iron
that sold at S4O per ton before tho panio
is not in demand now at S3O. This is, there
fore, a clear case where labor must of neces
sity adapt itself to tbo demand. The pud
dlors and miners of Pennsylvania have de
cided otherwise. They insist on anto-panio
wages or nothing, and, under tho ill-advisod
authority of their Unions, they have driven
> the employers to olose their mills. They
prefer to earn nothing and receive nothing
through the winter to have steady employ
ment at reduced wages. While itis true they
bring this misery and destitution on them
selves, the madness by which they have been
ruled is none the less deplorable.
A LAWYER ON THE SUPREME COURT.
The articles in Tub Tuiwjhb urging the ro«
forms needed In our judicial system have drawn
public attention to the necessity of a more or
loss radical change in the methods of justice.
Among a large number of loiters on the subject,
wo have received ono from a member of tbs
Chicago Bar which makes some timely sugges
tions. Its resemblance, in length, to the end
less briefs of which the Supreme Bench com
plains forbids our printing it entire, but we
have summarized Us more important parts.
The law’s delay iu Illinois is mainly duo to the
length of timo consumed In appealing to the
Supremo Court, the cheapness of an appeal, and
the possibility of making the opposite party, in
ibis way, pay heavily for hla victory. The first
can be obviated by & rule that an appeal shall
always bo taken to tho next term of the Supreme
Court after the rendering of judgment In the
Inferior jurisdiction. To make this practicable,
action should bo bad in regard to squeezing the
useless detail and eloquence out of records and
briefs. The present cheapness of an appeal
happens in this way j Aa a judgment draws only
G per cent interest until the appeal is decided,
tho appellant can mako*a forced loan at that rate
from bis creditor for from one to throe years.
The margin between this and the 10 pa/
cent bo can make on the money will often
more than defray all the costs be has
to pay. The appeal, therefore, Involves him xi
no expense, while bo has the satisfaction ol
seeing his creditor bled by court-costs and at
tornoy-foos for mouths and perhaps years. To
remedy this, all costs and oil reasonable fees
should bo taxed against tho unsuccessful suitor,
and a judgment, if reaffirmed, should be made
to draw 10 per cent from the start. Such a rule
will put a penalty, instead of a premium, on
unwarranted appeals, It will also put it out of
tho debtor’s power to force bis creditor to buy
justice at a heavy rate. At present, it costs
about 81,000 to collect a note of $4,000 from an
obstinate debtor. Is it just to allow a solvent
man to mako his creditor wait two years for his
mouoy and then tako 75 cents on the dollar in
full satisfaction for tbe debt ?
Tbo Supreme Court bos a remedy in Us own
bauds for some of tbo evils of which it com
plains. Tbo law allows It to assess damages of
from 6 to 10 per cent against an appellant
who fails to prosecute his appeal or who ap
parently prosecutes it only for delay. In tbo
former case, it rarely, very rarely, gives more
tbau 5 percent, and it is loth, perhaps unduly
so, to decide that auy appeal has boon taken
simply for delay. A little healthy severity In
both those classes of suits would do a groat deal
of good. If an appeal is not prosecuted, 10 per
cout damages are certainly not too large a reward
for tbo unjustly-barascod appellee; and, when
some of the Supreme Judges have openly assort
ed that a largo proportion of tbo oases brought
boforo thorn are appealed for delay, Itseoms as if
they might punish this flagrant misdemeanor
more frequently than they do. If Bat and Bench
aud Legislature do their duty, the needed re*
forms will not long bo delayed.
It takes about a quart of powder and 8 pounds
of lead to arrest a man in Arkansas, which should
be provided for by taxation instead of falling
upon the pockets of individuals. Tbo Sheriff of
Lincoln Couuty was sent to accompany a sen
tenced prisoner to lua store. The latter intrench
ed himself behind the counter, and, aided by A
couple of friends, prepared to defend their posi
tion. The Sheriff called upon two casual by
standers to assist in making tbo arrest, ou the
hypothesis that every man m Arkansas carried
the wherewithal to make himself useful, to*wit;
a loaded revolver. A severe engagement fol
lowed. The dead and wounded wore 50 per cent
of tbo whole number engaged. Two of the
Sheriff's impromptu posse wore severely riddled,
while tbo enemy lost one of their number alto
gether.
The law of Congress providing for the pre
payment of postage on printed mutter, which
goes into effect tbe first of the year, discrim
inates against monthly publications and all oth
ers that appear less frequently than once a week.
The newspapers and weekly publications pay at
the rate of two cents per pound, while the mag
azine are required to pay throe cents per pound.
We do not know what induced Congress to make
this distinction, unless it was that tbo monthly
magazines and quarterlies, appearing less fre
quently and having a more limited circulation,
do not provide as much business to the mail*
