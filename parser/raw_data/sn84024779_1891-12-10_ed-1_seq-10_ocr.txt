Tile Columbia Daily Calendar.
An old friend in a new dress, and
.in article that'has come to ba one of
the indespensibles of an editor's desk,
comes to hand in the Columbia Daily
Calendar for 18v2. The calendar is
in the form of a pad containing 367
leaves, each 5$x2g inches one for
each day of the year, to be removed
daily, and one for the entire year.
The day of the week, of the month,
and of the year are given, and each
slip bears a short paragraph pertain
ing to cycling or some kindred sub
ject. At the botton of each leaf is a
blank for memoranda, every leaf
being accessible at any time. The
stand is an entirely new departure,
being made of sheet metal finished
in ivory black, and is very compact.
At the close of the year the stand
will be available for another pad.
This is the seventh issue of this now
well-known calendar, yet all the
matter is fresh and new, having been
carefully collated from leading publi
cations and prominent writers, most
of it being specially written for this
purpose. It comprises notable events
in cycling, opinions of physicians
and clergymen, hints about road
making, and numerous other topics.
That Indemnity Land Matter.
North Dakota's representatives at
Washington are pushing the matter
of the Great Northern's claims to odd
sections within the indemnity, affect
ing a good many farmers in this
county, and will undoubtedly close
the matter up before it is allowed
to rest. In speaking of the matter
the Grand Forks Herald, observes:
The Herald suggests the propriety
of the parties in interest and our citi
zens generally in some way expressing
their appreciations of the efforts of
Senator Casey and Mr. Johnson in
this direction. Such formal expres
sion would doubtless be of material
assistance to the delegation. As inti
mated yesterday, the Herald does not
apprehend that the eviction notices
now being served by the railway
company have any other design than
to induce the farmers to interest
themselves in seconding the efforts of
the congressional delegation in effect
ing a speedy quieting of the com
pany's claim. There seems to be no
occasion for denouncing either the
government or the railway company.
Senato Casey has fully and ably pre
sented the whole matter to the secre
tary of the interior and an equitable
adjustment of the case may be confi
dratfrexpeeted..'

OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
To the Kdilor of The Wahpeton Times.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4,1891.
The very spirited contest for the
Speakership of the House of Repre
sentatives will close with the selec
tion of one of the condidates by the
democratic caucus which will be held
to-morrow, but it will be years before
it is forgotten. There have been
many things to
cause it to he remember
ed, not the least of which is the large
number of candidates that will re
main in the field up to the last—this
is of itself highly creditable to the
democratic party as an organization,
as it shows that it is a party that
does not tolerate bossism, but gives
every man in its ranks an equal right
to aspire to any honor within its gift.
Another thing about it that will not
soon be forgotten is the action of the
republicans in trying by misrepre
senting innocent remarks made by
democrats, and in many instances by
the outright manufacture of state
ments to create a feeling of anta
gonism between the friends of the
several candidates—they succeeded
but too well, in some instances.
Whoever is selected for Speaker,
the attempt will be made in certain
quarters to make it appear that the
selection makes certain the nomina
tion for president next year of some
one of the gentlemen who have been
prominently named for that honor.
That is another republican scheme.
There is not the slightest thing to
base such a conclusion upon, no
matter which of the candidates for
speaker may win. There are, to
your correspondent's certain knowl
edge, men in the ranks of the sup.
porters of each of the candidates who
favor Mr. Cleveland, Governor Hill,
Governor Gray, Senator Gorman and
Governor Boies, so you see what
nonsense it is to say that the success
of any one of the candidates for
speaker will have any direct effect
upon the nomination for president
next year. Just as members of con
gress have differed in their opinions
of the best men for speaker, so will
they differ when it comes to select
ing a candidate for president. The
National democratic convention, and
not the House of Representatives,
will name the presidential nominee
of the party, republican busybodies
to the contrary notwithstanding
Representative Cooper, of Indiana,
who originated the Raum investiga
tion in the last Congress, says that if
Mr. Harrison persists in keeping
Raum at the head of the Pension of
fice he will move tor another investi
galion. Mr. Cooper has secured
large addition to the stock of ammuni
tion which the packed committee of
the last^ Congress refused to allow
him to use, and if Rauin does not
vacate the Pension office he will see
to it that the next investigation does
not end with a coat of whitewash.
It is stated here, but denied, that
Secretary Foster's health is in a
precarious condition. While deny
ing that he is seriously sick, his
friends admit that he is going South
for several weeks' rest before he
again takes up his work as Secretary
of the Treasury.
Mr. Harrison's friends in the re
publican party have been anxiously
expecting this week that often an
nounced statement from Mr. Blaine
that he would not be the candidate of
his party, it having been stated here
the other day by ex-Senator Saunders
of Nebraska, whose daughter
Russell Harrison's wife, that Mr.
Blaine would shortly take the public
into his confidence but alas, for the
Harrison crowd, it seems to be only
another false alarm, as Mr. Blaine
says not a word, but continues to
smile when visiting republicans tell
him that they propose nominating
him next year.
is
Attorney General Miller is not an
admirer of the newspapers, probably
because they have refused to class
him as high as his own conciet tells
him he should go therefore it catjsed
no surprise when he tried to cast a
slur upon the press, while the argu
ment in the cases against the consti
tutionality of the McKinley tariff law
was proceeding before the Supreme
Court. It came about this way. Mr.
Stephen G. Clark, of New York,
while arguing that the omission of
the tobacco rebate clause in the bill
as signed by the President invalidated
the whole bill, produced a book kept
in the Clerk's office showing the
record of bills passed by the House,
to show that the clause was omitted.
In reply to the Attorney General's
question, Mr. Clark said he was not
advised as to whether there was any
law for the keeping of the book. "If
there is no such law", said the At
torney General with a sneer, "the
book has no more weight than a news
paper publication."
Commissioner Roosevelt is back.
He declines to discuss the story that
Mr. iVanamaker is after his scalp,
further than to fay that he stands by
everything he lias em said, which is
equivalent to repeating his charge
against the truthfulness of Mr. W.

It Is Republican now.
Some weeks ago Ed Moore pulled
out of the Dickey County Leader and
united with The Commonwealth
force at Fargo, of which he is helping
to make a superb paper, however
dropped this observation with re
ference to The Leader.
The Dickey County Leader, formerly demo
cratic, a week or two since announced that it
could see no good reason for the existence of
a democratic paper in that county, so it
flopped. Then the board of county com
missioners was republican. Since election
day the board is said to be democratic, and
the Leader may live long enough to And out
that there is more room for a democratic
paper there than fora third republican paper.
—Fargo Commonwealth.
Perhaps there is, Ed, but it takes a
democrat to successfully run a demo
cratic paper. A republican cannot
do the job successfully unless there is
plenty of financial inducement, in
which case most any newspaper man
can adjust his politics to fit the ap
parent demand. There appears to be
no demand in this county for either
a democratic or a republican paper
on account of politics alone, and as
both the editors of the Leader are re
publicans it is but natural that the
politics of the paper should favor
tliat party. The* change was not
made because we either hoped or ex
pected to secure any more or less of
the county patronage by so doing.
Very little of its patronage during
the five years of its existence as a
democratic paper came from a politi
cal soure, and we do not expect any
greater proportion from this source
while we continue to fly the republi
can flag. You also remember that
the Leader is not the third, but the
first, republican paper in Dickey
County.—Dickey County Leader.
It is not every day that one finds a
man fig lit as hard for his political
principles as does Ed Moore. And
when the Democrats find a newspaper
always on deck and to be depended
upon and from definite business
principles, having builded a prestige
from which it may wield a little in
fluence, it is well to take care of such
paper. However, in The Leader con
stituency it would now seem that a
definite policy is hardly to be re
warded. Perhaps that's why Ed
pulled out.
