WOULD BE ENDED
SENATOR CAPPER OF KANSAS
WOULD HAVE TAX ON
GRAIN DEALING.
PROPOSES BILL IR 60RGRESS
Northwest Wheat Exchange Pro
posed by Elmore of Washing
ton State Farmers'
Union.
WASHINGTON.—Senator
of Kansas lias .proposed a bill to
stop gambling in foodstuffs and cot
ton.
Capper
A tax of 10 per cent, designed to he
prohibitive on ''future" trading in
grain and cotton, except by actual
owners or a limited class of traders
under federal license, is tlie basic
feature of the Capper bill, which
is introduced iu the senate by the
author and in the house of represen
tatives by Representative Tincher,
republican of Kansas. The 10 per
i-ent tax would apply to options and
the measure would affect grain prod
ucts as well as raw grain.
"Tlie bill will stop gambling in
wheat, corn.-cotton and other farm
products," says Senator Capper. "It
will eliminate tlie wheat pit and the
blackboards. It will put out of busi
ness the thousands of wire houses
and bucket shops by making it im
possible for gamblers and speculators
to deal on boards of trade."
Another resolution by Dickinson of
Iowa authorizes the appointment of
« special committee to investigate
grain, livestock and cotton prices and
to recommend legislation designed to
remedy present conditions.
Would Help Farmers.
First steps toward remedial legis
lation for farmers at tlie coming ses
-ion of congress will take the form of
a concurrent resolution directing a
restoration ot the war finance cor
poration. ,
All Planned Out.
SPOKANE.—Plans for the forma
tion of an association to be known
us the Northwest Wheat exchange,
which is expected to market tlie 1921
wheat croît, and which will be the
basis for a national system of pool
wheat selling, are announced by A.
A. Elmore, president ot the Washing
ton State Farmers' union.
This organization will include the
Washington, Oregon. Idaho and Mon
tana wheat growers' associations.
He says tlie northwest wheat ex
change will probably be composed of
five members—two representing
Washington and one each for Mon
tana, Idaho and Oregon. This will be
in accordance with the production of
the states. Headquarters will prob
ably be in Spokane.
"We expect, says Mr. Elmore, "to
handle from 30,000,000 to 60,000,000
bushels of the 1921 wheat crop
through the northwest wheat ex
change."
It is planned to finance the enter
prise by issuing bonds and that many j
of the largest farmers of the north
west have already signed contracts.
!
j
To consider legislation directly at- a
fecting tlie farmers and producers
G. W. Wilson of Rocklyu, Wash.,
president of the state federation of
farm organisations, has called a meet
ing of producers to be held at 10
o'clock the morning of December 20
.a the assembly room of the Spokane ]

LAST MESSAGE BT
HE WAS UNABLE TO APPEAR
BEFORE CONGRESS
IN PERSON.
SUG6ESTS LOAN TO ARMENIA
President Addresses Annual Message
to Congress—Asks Food Laws—
He Did Not Appear in
Person.
WASHINGTON—Presiedut Wilson's
concrete recommendations to con
gress in his annual message Tuesday
were:
Revision of tlie tax law with
simplification of the income and
profits taxes.
Independence for the Philip
pines.
A loan to Armenia. <
Economy in government ap
propriations and expenditures and
creation of a workable budget
system.
Cold storage and other laws
affecting the cost of living, and
the federal licensing of corpora
tions as recommended in pre
vious messages.
Rehabilitation and training of
disabled soldiers and sailors. The
president did not indorse a
bonus.
Nowhere did the president re
fer to tlie League of Nations or
the peace treaty fight, except
perhaps by inference in his open
ing when he quoted Abraham
Lincoln's "Let us have faith that
right makes right, and that faith
let us dare to do our duty as
we understand it."
At its close the president wrote a
paragraph which might be regarded
as a valedictory, saying:
"I have not so much laid before
you a series of recommendations as
sought to utter a confession of faith,
of the faith in which I was bred and
which is my solemn purpose to stand
by until my last fighting day. I be
lieve this to be the faith of America,
the faith of the future, and of all the
victories which await national action
in tlie days to come, whether in
America or elsewhere.'!
Democracy, the president said, "is
being put upon its final test."
Old World Rejects It.
"The old world," said he, "is suf
fering from a wanton rejection of
the principle of democracy and a sub
stitutinu of the principle of autoc
racy as asserted in the name, but
without the authority and sanction,
of the multitude.' This Is the time
of all others when democracy should
prove its purity and its spiritual
power to prevail. It is surely the
manifest destiny of the United States
to lead ill the attempt to make this
spirit prevail."
Two ways
States can assist to accomplish this
groat object" were outlined by the
president. They were:
"First—By offering the example
within her own borders of the will
and (lower of democracy to make and
enforce laws which are unquestion
ably just and which are equal to their
administration.
"Second—By standing for right and
justice as towards individual na
tions."
"The United States,' said the presi
dent, "can not refuse this role of
champion without putting tlie stigma
of rejection upon tlie great and the
devoted men who brought it into
existence."
The president's message was trans
mitted by messenger, the president
adhering to his decision not to ad
dress congress in person.

Key C. McDowell of Butte, Mont.,

recruiting station recently. As it
was necessary to verify his age, his

following telegram was received in

"Answering your wire, you have
my permission to enlist in tlie U. S.
army. You should make a damn good
soldier, if you are able to worry the
enemy «hen you meet him anything
like you have worried tne, great

WASHINGTON, I). C.—The world's
