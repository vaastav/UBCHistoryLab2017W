DECLARED CENSORING

Public Warned to Make Allow

by Censor
Washington, Dec. 7.Senators
were aroused when they read dis
patches from Paris that all official
information from the peace confer
ence will pass through the hands of
George" Creel, chairman of the com
mittee on public information^
The matter was brought up by
Senator Hiram Johuaon of California,
who called upon senators to protest
against "Creel-rationed" news. Sen
ator J. B. Watson, of Indiana de
clared if the information from the
peace conference was to be handled
by Mr. CTeet, tire American people
should make "great allowances for
its truthfulness and authenticity."
Senator L. N. Sherman of Illinois
said the dispatch merely confirmed
his fears, but blamed congress for
delegating autocratic powers when
it, authorized taking over of the
cables.

"We have been told there is jio

said. "I am glad we have been told,

necessary to make the amount of the
news matter square with the cable

Objects To Creel.
I am not complaining so much
about' the man who is to ration,'
Senator Watson retorted. "I am dis
tuetod-about'the man who is to have
absolute charge of every word re
specting the deliberations of the
peace council. That man is George
Creel, and George Creel was taken
there for the express purpose of cen-.
soring it all. If nothing is to be put
on the wire except what he approves,
the people should make a great al
lowance for its truthfulness and au
thenticity."
Senator William Borah of Idaho
offered a resolution which would re
affirm the faith of the senate in
George Washington's warning
against entangling alliances" and in
the Monroe* doctrine. It is a slap at
the LeaguefiOjf Nations to enforce
peace.
RED CROSS SERVICE
BROADENS IN SCOPE
The Red Cross Home Service is
organized neighborliness. It aims to
do for the whole community what
the church or lodge does for its mem
bers. Its great work at present is
for the soldiers' families, helping
them to meet the changed conditions
due to the taking of a husband or a
son for- military service. In the
spirit of helpfulness and service, it
offers sympathy and aid to all who
need it.
The strongest men in the com
munity are at its call, to give advice
on difficult questions. Is there delay
in securing the allotment and allow-,
ance due you from the soldier and the
government? Are you worried be
cause you have not heard from your
boy? Are there business matters on
which you need advice, because the
man who used to attend to these
things is away? Do you n.

LIKE THE BISHOP'S DRESS.
(By United Press.)
London, Nov. 19. (By Mail.)
"Our womenHeaven bless them and
dress them!"
This wail comes from a bishop who
deplores the fact that English women
haee taken to trousers
Most people are of opinion if
Heaven were interested in the dress
ing of women they would still appear
in trousers at the present period.
Woman's garb often is an outward
expression of soul, and through these
four years of hardship women have
had to clench their fists and keep a
stiff upper lip while they carried on
their men's work. Women have had
to step into the breach and play a
partand they say they can play

they are dressed for it

YOST IN MINNESOTA
TO DISCHARGE CORPS
AT STATE SCHOOLS
Mao John Dixon Yost, V. S. A.,
"the man who adopted Bemidji,"
noted In army circles and in Minne
sota as tho man who recruited 16,-
000 men in a year in this state for
the war, is in St. Paul from Wash
ington with orders to muster out
the men in the student army train
ing camps in St Paul and Minne
apolis.
The assignment is one of special
importance because of the responsi
bility of obtaining a correct record
of the physical condition of every
man leaving the service, for possible
use In connection with claims for
war risk insurance, of which there
is approximately $37,000,000,000
outstanding
Teams of surgeons at each camp
will make thorough examinations of
all men Beperated from service, Major
Yost explained, and these records
will be preserved With the physical
records made on induction. This In
formation will be available when
claims are made for any disabilities
resulting from service
"Men disabled in any degree as the
result of military service are entitled
to recover under the war risk insur
ance law," said Major Yost. "The
physical examinations now to be
made will be of importance in deter
mining such disabilities, and especi
ally In the cases of the limited serv
ice men, among whom the percentage
of claimants may be larger than
among Class A men
His assignment covers Ave student
army training camps: the University
of Minnesota with 3,254 men and
Dvmwoody Institute with about 7d0
men. both in Minneapolis 8t. Thom
as College with 217 men Hamline
University with 216 men, and Mac

camps in St Paul and Minneapolis
be completed by December 21, but
the task is regarded too heavy to he
finished by that time
