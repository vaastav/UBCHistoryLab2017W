NICARAGUAN CANAL BILL
Is Made the Unfinished Business
in the Senate
THE URGENT DEFICIENCY BILL PASSED
By Which the House Does Its Share Toward Providing For
the Support of the Army and Navy—
Pension Bills Passed
Associated Press Special Wire.
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.—At the opening
of today's session of the Senate it was de
cided that adjournment should be until
Monday. It was also determined to give
one hour of today's session to the consider
ation of pension bills.
in connection With the consideration of
pension bills on the pension calendar, Mr.
Vest of Missouri said: "I do not want to be
captious about this pension business, and do
not want to set myself up as a reformer,
but this thing of passing a lot of pension
bills simply by the reading of the titles and
when a quorum of the Senate is not present
has got to be stopped."
After further referring to the method by
which pension bills are passed by the Sen
ate, Mr. Vest said: "Men of the South
have permitted these bills to be passed, hav
ing delicacy about entering objections to
the course of the procedure. Recent events
have obliterated sectionalism, and we arc
united. We can, therefore, come here and
object to this spoliation, and use the word
advisedly, without fear of having our mo
tives impugned or our words misconstrued.
We are paying nut in round figures $141,
--000,000 annually for pensions, and it is our
duty to find out why il is that thirty-three
years after the close of the civil war this
thing of pensions shows s,, enormous a
sum. 1 have been criticised by tome of my
people because I have not taken a more de
termined stand on this pension question,
1 want, however, to pay munificentlj and
liberally, in pensions. 1 regard tuch pay
ment a sacred duty, but I do object to the
passage of these bills without proper consid
eration and without the same restrictions
that are hedged about other measures."
Mr. Vest having stated his opposition to
the hurried manner of passing pension bills
in the senate, gave notice that he would in
sist upon a quorum being present when pen
sion bills were being acted upon.
Mr. Gallinger of New Hampshire, as
chairman of the Pension Committee, agreed
with Mr. Vest in his desire to have the pen
sion bills carefully considered. 11c thought
a quorum of the Senate ought to be in at
tendance when the pension calendar was con
sidered.
. During the consideration of bills on the
pension calendar Mr. Cattery of Louisiana
introduced this resolution:
"That it is the sense of the Senate of the
United States lhat the President enter into
negotiations with the government of Great
Britain for the purpose of abrogating or
modifying the Clayton-Hulwer treaty so far
and to the extent that the same may be
deemed to prevent the l'nited Sta.es from
owning, constructing, controlling or operat
ing any oceanic canal across the Isthmus ol
Darien."
The anti-scalping bill passed yesterday by
the house was received, and, at the request
of Mr. Cullom, chairman of the committee
on interstate, commerce, was laid on the ta
ble instead of referred to the committee. A
similar bill 'ha* already been,ieported by the
senate committee on interstate commerce.
A considerable number of pension bills
had been passed before the senators, one or
two at a time, began to leave the chamber.
Finally, true to his warning, Mr. Vest raised
the point of no quorum. Forty-eight sena
tors responded to their names and consider- .
ation of the pension bills was resumed. At
the expiration of the one hour allotted to the
consideration of the pension calendar, twen
ty-six bills had been passed.
At 11:50 oclock the senate went into •
executive session.
At 2:15 the senate resumed business in open
session.
Mr. Morgan called up the Nicaragunn {
canal bill, with a view to making it the un
finished business. He moved that the senate ,
proceed to the consideration of the bill. ,
Mr. Pcttigrew moved tn adjourn. Defeated,
18 yeas, 42 noes. I
Mr. Morgan's motion to proceed with the
consideration of the Nicaraguan canal bill
was then carried, and after the bill had been |
laid before the senate, thus becoming the
unfinished business, the senate, on molion-of .
Mr. Morgan at 2:25 p. m., adjourned until
Monday.
IN EXECUTIVE SKSSION ,
The senate in executive session today rati- (
fied the treaty for the extension of the time ,
for the completion of the Mexican boundary \
one year. There was no opposition and no
debate. .
Senator Vest today followed up the de- f
bate in executive session of yesterday con- ,
renting the appointment of senators and t
memberte>jf the house to positions on presi
dential commissions, by the introduction of (
a bill prohibiting the practice of making such t
appointments. The bill is'very brief, as fol- ,
lows:
That no person while holding a judicial ,
or executive office under the United States
shall be appointed by the president a com- J
mispioner or agent of the government nor of I
any department or bureau thereof."
More War Inquiry 1
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.-Senator Vest 1
today introduced in the Senate a resodution
providing for the appointment of a joint ~
commission to investigate the charges of ,
corruption in the conduct of the war with
Spain. ,
The preamble! to the resolution recites
that "Charges have been made through the
press of the country over the signature of
responsible parties that corrupt and im
proper means have been used to secure con
tracts from the government for the pur
chase of vessels for the navy and' for the
furnishing of clothing and other necessary
articles for the army of the United States
during the war with Spain at excessive andj
exorbitant rates."
The resolution calls for the appointment
of three Senators and five members of the
House and imposes upon them the duty of
"inquiring as to the truth of all such charges
and make report by bill or otherwise."
The Senators are to be appointed by the
Senate and the members of the House by
the Speaker of the House.

Work in Committee
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.—The senate
committee on foreign relations held a meet
ing today to consider the bill reported by
the Hawaiian commission for the govern
ment of the Hawaiian islands. The bill was
only considered in a very' general way, the
committee deciding to postpone the detail
Work upon it for a week. The decision
was reached because the full report of the
committee had not been printed. At the
meeting next Wednesday the measure will
he taken up section by section, and the
whole matter will bp very carefully con
sidered with the view of presenting it in as
perfect a shape as possible to the senate.
Senators Cullom and Morgan, who are mem
bers of the committee, and also members
of the commission, were present at today's
meeting and explained many of the general
features of the bill.
While no disposition was manifested to
make any opposition to the Hawaiian bill
as a whole, some of the members of the
committee indicated a desire to amend it in
some particulars.
Senator Turpie was among those who
showed such a disposition. His objection to
the bill, as reported, was on account of the
provision for a congressional delegate. The
supporters of the bill indicated a wilbng
ncss to strike out this provision, and it
looks as if this will be dove.
IN THE HOUSE
Funds Provided for Army and Navy
Support
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.-The urgent de
ficiency bill to provide for the support of the
military and naval establishments was
passed by the house today, practically with
out opposition. A fear had been expressed
that the measure might open up prolonged
debate upon the conduct of the war, but
the Democratic leaders decided that such a
debate would properly come later, upon the
regular appropriation bills or upon the bill
for the reorganization of the army. There
was not a word of criticism of the war dur
ing the debate. The only point upon which
nn issue was raised today was as to whether
the bill, providing, as it did, for the pay ot
the volunteers until July, 1899, might not
be construed as a modification oi the law
under which the volunteers were mustered
into service.
Mr. Mcßae (Ark.) offered an amendment
providing .that it should not be so con
strued, and upon it there was a gen al dis
cussion as to the advisability of mustering
the volunteers out before the regular army
was increased. Mr. Cannon finally accepted
the Mcßae amendment, and that removed
-the only shadow of opposition to the bili.
A number of amendments were adopted
upon the recommendation of the appropria
tions committee, which received some sup
plemental estimates after the bill was pre
pared. The largest of these were an item
of $3,000,000 for an emergency fund for the
war department, and $578,000 for the ord
nance department .increasing the amount
carried by the bill to $69,859,892.
The conference report upon the bill to
render the sureties of consols, vice consols
and consular agents liable for damages in
suit at law, was adopted.
The house adjourned over until Monday
to give the committee an opportunity to
work without interruption.
On motion of Chairman Cannon of the
appropriations committee, the house went
into committee of the whole immediately
after the rending of the journal to consider
the urgent deficiency bill for the support of
the military and naval establishments dur
ing the six months beginning January 1,
1899.
Underwood, Democrat, of Alabama, in-
THE HERALD
j terrogated Cannon with a view to receiving
j a statement as to the disposition to be
made of the volunteer army.
Cannon said the treaty of peace might be
! ratified in January; it might not be ratified
i for months. No one could tell what was
in front of us. We must deal with a situa
tion. The volunteer army might be mus
tered out and its place taken by the regu
lar army. That was a matter for the future
to decide, but he felt confident that the
treasury would be rich enough and congress
wise enough to meet any emergency.
Sayers, Democrat of Texas, the ranking
minority member of the appropriations com
mit tee, gave his unqualified endorsement
ot the bill, which, he said, did not affect in
any way the legislation regarding the vol
unteer or regular armies, ft simply made
appropriations to support the present naval
and military establishment. The bill was
based on the theory that the volunteers
would continue in the service until July 1,
181)0. If they were mustered out the appro
priations would be covered back into the
treasury.
Livingston, Democrat, of Georgia, ex
pressed the opinion that the law under
which the volunteers were mustered into
service was subject to double construction
as to the time when they should be mustered
out, and believed if the presidtnt was dis
posed to keen the volunteers in the service
until the regular army had been reorganized,
this bill appropriating money for their pay
ment would strengthen his hands.
Mcßae, Democrat, of Arkansas, gave no
tice that at the proper time he would offer
an amendment declaring that nothing in the
pending bill should be construed as to ex
tend or modify section four of the act of
April 22, creating the volunteer army. He
said he would not have pressed the amend
ment had it not been for the president's
declaration in his 1 message that fie would
muster out the volunteer army as toon as
the regular establishment was increased. It
was unjust to the volunteers to hold them
in the service when congress had given a
solemn pledge that they should be muttered
out as toon as the war ended. He believed
it was the purpose of the president to hold
the volunteers until a large standing army
was provided.
"The army on a peace footing numbers
but 26,000," interposed Cannon. "Do the
gentleman and his tide of the house eland
ready to support a bill to increase that
army to meet the necessities of the govern
ment in its present emergency and those
which confront it?"
"We will meet that question when it
arises," replied Mcßae. "We are opposed
to a large standing army, and we are op
pofed to holding the volunteers to per
form the duty of regulars and be used as
a club to force us to create a large standing
army. Let organization of the army come
in the regular way."
Cox, Democrat, of Tennessee, contended
that under the law the volunteers were en
tilled to their discharge the moment hostili
ties ceased. He supported the Mcßae
amendment, as did Bland.
Hemmenway said he could not understand
how gentlemen could desire the mustering
out of the volunteers until a standing army
was provided large enough to properly gov
ern our new possessions. Certainly no one
would contend that 26,000 men would be
sufficient."
"Do you favor the retention of the volun
teer army in the sen-ice until the regular
army is increased':" asked Bland.
"If an increase of the regular army is
deemed necessary," replied Hemmenway.
"I believe it necessary that the volunteers
should be held in service until their time of
enlistment expires."
'Dockery, Democrat, of Missouri, a mem
ber of the appropriation committee, dif
fered from his colleague, Livingston. He
did not believe that the pending bill could
LOS ANGELES, FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 9, 1898
THE OPEN DOOR
possibly be construed to modify tlie volun
teer act.
Fleming declared that the volunteers had
enlisted under the promise that they would
be discharged when the war was over. He
could not understand why the chairman ot
the appropriations committee should op
pose the Mcßae amendment, which simply
provided that nothing in the pending bill
should construe or modify the act of April
Kd.
Cannon said he saw no good reason that
would he subserved by its incorporation. It
would simply give some gentlemen on the
other side an opportunity to Map their
wings and proclaim with sound and fury
their friendship for the volunteers. (Laugh
ter.)
De Armond, Democrat, of Missouri, advo
cated the adoption of the Mcßae amend
ment. The president, he said could not
transform the volunteers into uniformed
policemen if congress in its wisdom decided
otherwise. The whole question was a mere
quibble as to whether the universal under
standing of the 100,000 men who had enlist
ed, that they should be discharged when
hostilities ceased, was now to be abandoned
and the volunteers held to do police duty
in different parts of the world.
General debate upon the bill was then
closed, upon Mr. Cannon's motion, and the
bill was read for amendment under the iive
minute rule.
Air. Cannon offered a committee amend
ment for an emergency fund of $3,000,000 for
the war department. He said it was impos
sible to see what contingencies might aud
probably would arise in the next six months.
An emergency fund of $1,000,000 was pro
vided for the navy department. The amend
ment was adopted.
Mr. King, Democrat of Utah, ottered an
amendment to limit the appropriation for
the pay of the volunteers to the period prioi
to March 31, 1899. He thought it the im
perative duty of the president to muster out
the volunteers as soon as peace was de
clared. The amendment was lost without
division.
Mr. Allen, Democrat of Mississippi, ottered
an amendment providing that the money
appropriated in the bill for the payment of
volunteers should not be available longer
than three months after ratification of a
treaty of peace. It was defeated, 51 to 71.
On motion of Mr. Cannon, several com
mittee amendments were adopted.
The appropriation for the current ex
penses of the ordnance service was increased
from $50,000 to $100,000; for the manufacture
of metallic ammunition, marksmen's med
als, insignia, etc., from $200,000 to $400,000;
for the purchase and manufacture of ord
nance stores from $62,000 to $250,000; for in
fantry, cavalry and artillery equipment from
$60,000 to $150,000, and for the manufacture
of arms at national armories, etc., from
$275,000 to $325,000.
These increases, Mr. Cannon explained,
had been recommended by the chief of ord
nance. Mr. Cannon then accepted the Mc-
Rae amendment. Without further amend
ment the bill was reported to the house and
passed without division.
Mr. Cannon moved that when the house
adjourn today, it be until Monday next, ex
plaining that the adjournment would give
the committee an opportunity to work. The
motion was agreed to.
Mr. Shafroth of Colorado asked unanimous
consent for the consideration of the bill for
the reclamation of arid lands. Mr. Hepburn
of lowa objected.
A conference report on the bill relating to
the bonds of consuls, vice consuls and con
sular agents was adopted.
At 4:20 p. m. the house adjourned until
Monday.
A Private Pension

Mallory wants 825,000 from the United
States because he fell through the open hatch
on the .steamer Arizona. The vessel was
lying in Seattle harbor about to be sold to
the government for use a.* a transport. The

allowing visitors to inspect the vessel at 10
cents each. Mallory was interested in the

Service
BOSTON, Dec. B.—Lieut. Charles D. Ken
nedy, whose death is announced by the ex
plosion at the works of the Judson Powder

A MUTINOUS CREW
Failed to Keep Captain Robertson in
Port
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. B.—With a ma
jority of his crew in irons, they having mu
tined, Captain Robertson of the British ship
Jack Burrill, hence from Santos, with 3000
tons of coaj, passed seaward today. Those
who know Captain Robertson have no fear
but that he will conquer the mutineers.
While outward-bound the Burrill anchored
at Brandy wine shoals, and while there began
to leak, but only slightly. All hands were
set to work to pump her out. and while thus
engaged decided to protest against going to
sea in the ship, claiming that she, was un
seaworthy. After a most thorough survey
the ship was pronounced seaworthy. This
was told the crew, but still they protested.
Captain Robertson faceu the issue. He sent
to Philadelphia for a sufficient number of
men to work the ship clear of the capes, and
went out today. The crew, to a man, were
in mutiny, and will be kept locked up until
they agree to turn to without further trouble.
A Cuban Commission
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.-The adminis
tration has practically decided to send a
commission to Cuba, consisting of a repre
sentative each from the war, treasury and
postoffiee departments, and the matter will
be brought for action at tomorrow's cabinet
meeting. The object of the dispatch of the
commisison is to determine and, if possible,
execute, in a general way, what is needed
throughout the island in the assumption of
the government of the island by the United
States. Complete postal service is contem
plated at the earliest practicable moment,
and a military customs service will be per
fected.
Attempted Suicide
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. B.—Aug. Straud,
a real estate dealer, nearly succeeded in

NEGOTIATIONS ARE ENDED
By a Final Agreement on the
Terms of Peace
ONE MORE MEETING WILL BE HELD
When the Treaty Will Be Signed by Which Spain Will Sub*
mit to "Spoliation by the Brute Force of a
Conscienceless Giant
Associated Press Special Wire
PARIS, Dec. B.—The United States and
Spanish peace commissioners concluded then
work today and finally settied the terms of
the treaty of peace. They will meet once
more in formal session on.Saturdayoi»Mon
day next, when the Spanish commissioners,
sorrowfully, and the Americans with feel
ings of relief, will write their signatures upon
the document which embodies the results
of the war and the preparation of which has
consumed eleven weeks, a longer time than
the war itself. In the meantime, the treaty
will be engrossed under the supervision of
Mr. Moore and Senor Ojeda, the secretaries
of the respective commissions.
EXCUSABLE BITTERNESS
The Spaniards are exceedingly bitter over
the result, though observing the forms ot
friendliness and courtesy. Montero Rios,
whose strong and persistent struggle to save
for his country every possible asset from the
wreck of her colonial empire has commanded
the respect and admiration of hisopponenfa
went from the council chamber today to his
bed in a state of complete collapse, as there
suit of the long strain and his chagrin over
the small fruits of his efforts.
Senor Ojeda has been prostrated since yes
terday and was unable to attend the joint
session today.
ALL EUROPE BLAMED
The Spaniards charge equal blame upon
the European powers and the L'nited States
for their downfall. One of the Spanish com
missioners said this evening:
"The European,nations hsive'madrn great
mistake in deserting Spain and leaving her
to spoliation by the brute force of a con
scienceless giant. They all know that in the
I hilippines America has taken more than
she can digest. She will ultimately sell the
islands to England or Germany and when
the transfer is made they will precipitate a
general European strife.
"We have refused to sell any island in the
Carohnes. We never thought of considering
an offer. Nor have we consented to nego
tiate upon any questions except those direct
ly invo ved in the protocol signed at Wash
ington.
Tears of a Failure
PARIS, Dec. 8.-The American peace
commissioners entered the joint conference
today in a nervous frame of mind. They
evidently had reasons to believe that a pos
sibility existed, even- at this late hour, that
there might be a rupture. This feeling of
npprehension was based on the temper the
Spaniards have displayed lately. This
week the commissioners of Spain do not
conceal the fact that, having failed to gain
all the important points, they are indiffer
ent as to whether or not the conferences re
sult in a settlement of peace by the signing
of a treaty by which Spain loses all her
colonies.
A miscarriage of negotiations would leava
their political prestige at home no worse,
if not in better position than if they signed
the treaty. The Americans are anxious not
to give the Spaniards any pretext to break
off the negotiations or take offense so far as
the exercise of patience and diplomacy can
steer clear of protests.
The Madrid.papers are disposed to revive
the question of the Maine and to excite
public opinion against the United States
on account of the reference made to this
in President MeKinley's message to Con
gress. They report that Senor Montero
Rios, President of the Spanish commission,
made an impassioned denunciation of Presi
dent McKinley at the last joint meeting of
the commissions. But these reports are
practically without foundation.
Senor Rios did refer,to the Maine, but
only in calmly>-worded sentences, expressed
regret that the President has spoken, as
Spaniards thought, unjustly of them. The
Spaniards had already proposed at this con
ference to have the responsibility of the
Maine reported upon by a joint commission
of the European powers. The American
commissioners refused to listen'to this and
permitted Senor Rios' reference to the
President's message to pass unchallenged,
as a discussion would have provoked de
bate and bad blood.
Diplomatic circles in Paris predict, as one
of the results of the treaty, a diplomatic
contest between France and the United
States, which will have an. important chap
ter in history.
The French government is reported to
have resolved to take up the case of the
French holders of Cuban bonds, and it is
believed that France will declare that the
repudiation of the bonds is the result of the
treaty which the victorious nation imposed
upon Spain. They argue that through the
treaty responsibility has been shifted upon
America and therefore the French govern
ment will endeavor to exact some pledge
for the payment or guarantee of the bonds.
The details of the last class of questions
covered by the statement which the Ameri
cans handed to Senor Montero Rios at the
last meeting was considered today, but all
the commissioners refuse to divuige the de
tails of the conference.
Several points upon which they were un
able to agree, were left open for diplomatic
negotiations.
The Spaniards refuse to admit that they
had failed to respect treaties guaranteeing
religious freedom in the Caroline Islands
that there was a necessity for new guar-
antees.
The conclusion of the work was, according
to the commissioners, marked by politeness
and all outward evidences of good feeling
and relief at the fact that the task was ac-
complished.
When all the propositions had been dis
cussed. Judge Day, president of the Ameri-
PRICE FIVE CENTS
can Commission, remarked: "There seems
to be nothing more to do, but to engross
and sign the treaty."
Senor Montero Rios, president of ths
Spanish Commission, acquiesced to this,
and the Americans bowed themselves out
before the Spaniards, according to their
custom.
Spanish Resentment
LONDON, Dec. 9.—The -Madrid corre
spondent of the Standard says:
The strongest comments are made upon
the little disposition the United States has
shown to respond to the Spanish demands
for a prompt release of the 11,000 Spanish
prisoners in the hands of the Tagalas and a
restitution of private and officials deposits
now lying in the colonial official and judicial
deposit banks.
Everything seems to show that the last
stage in the negotiations has taken a turn
hardly calculated to pacify Spanish public
opinion or to facilitate for a long time to
come the renewal of friendly relations be
tween the two governments. Most of ths
newspapers favor the idea of selling tha
Carolines and the other possessions of Spain
in the Pacific to Germany or to some other
nation willing to pay a better price than ths
United States.
The Madrid correspondent of the Daily
Mail says:
The prayer of the chaplain of the United
States senate invoking the blessing of
heaven upon Spain is much resented in high
circles.
Senor Sagasta denies the statement in an
interview attributed to him certain sharp
remarks on the policy of the United States.
The Maine Question
MADRID, Dec. B.—The Imparcial today
says the Spanish government yesterday de
cided to telegraph Senor Montero Rios, pres
ident of the Spanish peace commission at
Paris, instructing liim to again protest
against President MeKinley's reference to
the Maine in his recent message to congress.
Continuing, the Imparcial says there ia great
indignation at the American commissioners*
rejection of Senor Rios' request for a neu
tral investigation into the cause of the loss
of the .Maine.
A semi-official note, just issued, says:
"Spain has been treated by the conqueror
with unexampled cruelty and is resigned; to
her fate; but she cannot tolerate President
MeKinley's accusation, for she is conscious
of her complete innocence. It is understood
that the government has decided to end the
Paris conference, on the ground that the
discussion of secondary questions is impossi
ble."
Bank Wrecker on Trial
PHILADELPHIA, Dee. 8.-The trial ol
William Steele, cashier of the wrecked
Chestnut Street National bank, who is
charged with aiding the late William Sin
gerly in the looting of the bank, was com
menced in the L'nited State 6 district court
today. District Attorney Beck, in his open
ing speech, was very severe in his comments
on Mr. Singerly in the management of the
bank. Bank Examiner Hart testified that
Mr. Singerly had for several years been in
debted to the bank to the extent of between
.$700,000 and $800,000, which indebtedness
made the institution insolvent. The fact
that Singerly owed the bank so much money
was concealed, however, by manipulation of
the figures of the bank's books.
A Precious Relic
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.-The president
and secretary of the navy had an interesting
visitor today, in the person of Mrs. Harriet
R. P. Stafford of Cottage City, Mass., a pa
triotic old lady, who desired to present the
government the flag worn by the good old
frigate liouhomme Richard during her mem
orable victorious engagement with the Brit
ish frigate Serapis, September 23,1779. Mrs.
Stafford had the historical old ensign in her
possession, and presented satisfactory evi
dence that it was the first flag bearing the
stnrs and stripes ever hoisted over an Ameri
can vessel of war, and the first that was
ever saluted by a foreign naval power.
A Double Murder
MISSOURI CITY, Mo., Dec. 8.-\Vhai
will undoubtedly prove to be a double mur
