PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Washinoton, D. C, December 2.
To (-<- Senate a.-ul ffon-e of Mtqrtltntativtl:
In transmitting to you this my fourth
annual message, it is with thankfulness to
the Giver of all good that m a nation we
have been blessed during the past year with
peace at home, peace abroad, and a gen
eral prosperity vouchsafed to but few
peoples.
With the exception of the recent devas
tating tire which swept from the earth with
a breath, as it were, millions of accumu
lated wealth in the city of Boston, thero
has been no overshadowing calam
ity within the year to record. It
is gratifying to note how like
their fellow-citizens of the city of Chicago,
under similai circumstances a year earlier,
the citizens of tfoston ore rallying under
their misfortunes, and the prospect that
their energy and perseverance will over
come all obstacles and show the same
prosperity soon that they would had no
disaster befallen them. Otherwise, we have
been free from pestilence, war and calami
ties which often overtake nations, and, as
far as human judgment can penetrate the
future, no cause seems to exist to threaten
our present peace.
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.
When Congress adjourned in June; last a
question had been raised by Great Britain,
and was then pending, which for n time
seriously imperilled tho .settlement by
friendly arbitration of tho grave diffbi _n*a.
between this Government and that of her
British Majesty which by the Treaty .of
Washington had been referred to the tribu i
nal of arbitration which had met at Geneva,
in Switzerland. The arbitrators, however,
disposed of the question which had jeo
parded the whole of the treaty and threat
ened to involve the two nations in most un
happy relations toward each other in a
manner entirely satisfactory to this Got
arnment and in occordanre with tho views
and tho policy which it had maintained.
The tribunal which had convened at Geneva
in December, concluded its laborious ses
sion on the 14th day of September last, on
which day, having availed itself of the dis
cretionary power given to it by the treaty
to award a sum in gross, it made its deci
sion, whereby it awarded the sum of 815,
--500,000 in gold as indemnity to be paid by
Great Britain to the United States for
the satisfaction of all tho claims refer
red to its consideration. This decision
happily disposes of a long-standing
difference between the two Governments,
and, in connection with another award
made by the German Emperor under a re
ference to him by the same treaty, leaves
these two Governments without a shadow
upon the friendly relations which it is my
sincere hope may forev.r remain equally
unclouded. The report of the agent of the
United States appointed to attend the
Geneva tribunal, accompanied by the pro
tocols of the proceedings of the arbitrators,
the arguments of the counsel of both
Governments, the award of the tribunal,
and the opinions given by the several arbi
trators, "is transmitted herewith, I havo
caused to be communicated to the heads ot
the three friendly Powers who complied
with the joint request made to them undr-r
the treaty the thanks of this Government
for the appointmont of arbitrators made by
them respectively, and also my thanks to
the eminent personages named by them j
and my appreciation ofthe dignity, patience,
impartiality, and great ability with which
they discharged their arduous and high
functions. Her Majesty's Government has
communicated to me the appreciation by her
Majesty of the ability and indefatigable in
dustry displayed by Mr. Adams, the arbi
tratornamed on tho part of this Government,
daring the protracted inquiries and discus
-ions of the tribunal. I cordially unite
with her Majesty in this appreciation. It
»3 due to the agent of the United States
before tho tribunal to record my high ap- j
preciation of tho marked ability, unwea
ried patience, and th. prudenco and discre
tion with which he has conducted the very
responsible and delicate duties committed
to him ; and it is also due to the learned
and eminent counsel who attended the tri
bunal on the part of this Government to
express my sense of the talents and wis
dom which they brought to bear in tho at
tainment of the result so happily reached.
It will be the province of Congress to pro
vide for the distribution among those who
may be entitled to it of their respective
shares of tho money to be paid. Although
the sum awarded is not payable until a
year from the date of the award, it is
deemed advisable that no time he lost in
making _ proper examination ofthe several
cases in which indemnification may be due.
1 consequently recoihinend tho creation of
a board of commissiouers for the purpose.
THE NORTHWEST BOUNDARY.
By the thirty-fourth articlo of the treaty
of Washington the respective claims of the
United States and of Ureat Britain in their
construction of tho treoty of the 13th of
June, 1840, defining the boundary line be
tween their respective territories, wero sub
mitted to tbe arbitration and award of his
Majesty the Emperor of Germany to de
cide which of these claims is most in ac
cordance with the true interpretation ofthe
trtaty of 1848. His Majesty the Emperor
of Germany, having been pleased to under
take the arbitration, has tho earnest thank.;
of this Government and of tho people of
the Uuited States for the labor, pains, and
core which he has devoted to the considera
tion of this long-pending difference. I have
caused an expression of my thanks to be
communicated to his Majesty. Mr. Ban
croft, the representative of this Government
at Berlin, conducted the case and rrepared
the statement on the part of the United
States with the ability that his past services
justified the public in expecting at his
hands. As a member of the Cabinet at
the date of the treaty which has given riso
to the discussion between tho two Govern
ments, as the Minister to Great Britain
when the construction now pronounced
unfounded was first advanced, and as the
agent and representative of the Govern
ment to present the case and to receive the
award, he has been associateil with the
question in all of its phases, and in every
stage has manifested a patriotic zeal and
earnestness in maintenance of the claim of
the United States. He is entitled to much
ci edit for the success which has attended
the submission.
After a patient investigation of the case
mid of the statements of each party his
Majesty the Emperor, on tho 21st of "Octo
ber last, signed his award in writing, de
creeing that the claim of the Government
of the United States that the boundary lino
between the territories of her Britannic
Majesty and the United States shou'd be
drawn through tho Haro channel is most in
accordance with the true interpretation of
the treaty concluded on tho 15th of June,
1846, between the Governments of her Bri
tannic Majesty and the United States. Cop
ies of the " case " presented on behalf of
each Government, and of the " statement
in reply " of each, and a translation of the
award, are transmitted herewith. This
award confirms the United States in their
claim to the important archipelago of
Islands lying between the continent and
Vancouver's island, which for more than
twenty-six years, (ever sinco the ratifica
tion of the treaty) Great Britain has con
tested , and leaves us for the first timo In
tho history of the Unite. States as a na
tion without a question of disputed bound
ary between our torritory and the posses
sions of Great Britain on the continent.
PROMPTNESS OF HER MAJESTY'S GOV
ERNMENT IN OIVIKO EFFECT TO
THE AWARD.
It is my grateful duty to acknwledgo the
prompt, spontaneous action of her Majes
ty's government in giving efTect to the
award. In anticipation of any request
from this Government, and before the re
ception in the United States of the award
signed by the Emperor, her Majesty had
given instructions for the removal of her
troops which had been stationed there,
and tor the cessation of all exercise or
claim of jurisdiction, so as to leave the
United States in tbe exclusive possession
of tho lately-disputed torritory. I am
gratified to be able to announco that the
orders for the removal of the troops have
been executed, and that tho military joint
occupation of San Juan has ceased. The
islands are now in the exclusive possession
of the United States.
ANOTHER BOUNDARY COMMISSION
RECOMMENDED.
11 now beoames necessary to complete
the survey and determination of that por
ton of the boundary line (through the
Haro channel) upon which the commission
which determined the remaining part of
the line were unable to agree. I recom
mend tho appointment of a commission to
act jointly with one which may be named
by her Majesty for that purpose. Experi
ence of the difficulties attending the deter
mination of our admitted line of boundary
after the occupation of tho territory, and
its settlement by these owing allegiance to
the respective Governments, points to
tho importance of establishing by natu«
rai objects or other monuments the
actual lino between the territory acquired
by purchase from Russia and the adjoining
possessions of her Britannic Majesty. The
region is now so sparsely occupied that no
conflictive interests of individuals or of ju
risdiction are likely to interfere to the delay
or embarrassment of the actual location of
the line. If deferred until population shall
enter and occupy the teiritory, some trivial
contest of neighbors may again array the
two Governments in antagonism. I there
fore recommend the appointment of a com
mission to act jointly with one that may be
appointed on the part of Great Britain to
determine the line between our territory of
Alaska and the coterminu. possessions of
Great Britain.
In my last annual message I recom
mended the legislation necessary on tho
part of the United States to bring into ope
ration the articles of tho Treaty of Wash
ington of May 8, 1871, relating to the fish
eries and to other matters touching the re
lations of the United States toward the
British North American possessions, to
becomo operative so soon as the proper le
gislation should bo had on the part of
Great Britain and its possessions. That
legislation on the part of Great Britain and
its possessions baa not then been had, and
during tho session of Congress a question
was raised which for the time raised a
doubt whether any action by Congress in
tho direction indicated would become im
portant. This question has since been dis
posed of, and I have received notice that
the Imperial Parliament and the Legisla
tures of the provincial governments have
passed laws to carry the provisions of the
treaty on tho matters referred to into ope
ration. I therefore recommend your early
adoption of the legislation in the same di
rection necessary on the part of this Gov
ernment.
The joint commission for determining the
boundary line between the United States
and the British possessions between the
Lake of the Woods and tho Rocky Moun
tains has organized and entered upon its
work. It is desirable that the force be in
creased, in order that the completion of
the survey and determination of the line
may be the sooner attained. To this end
I recommend that a sufficient appropriation
be made.
OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER POWERS.
With France, our earliest ally; Russia,
the constant and steady friend of tho United
States ; Germany, with whose government
and people we have so many causes of
friendship and so many common sympa
thies ; and the other Powers of Europe,
our relations are maintained on the most
friendly terms.
Since my last annual message the exchange
has been made of the ratifications of a
treaty with the Austro-Ilungarian Empire
relating to naturalization; also of a treaty
with the German Empire respecting con
suls and trade-marks; also of a treaty
with Sweden and Norway relating to natu
ralization ; all of which treaties have been
duly proclaimed.
INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CON-
O BESS AND EXPOSITION.
Congress at its last session having made
an appropriation to defray the expenses of
commissioners on the part of the United
States to the International Statistical Con
gress at St. Petersburgh, the persons ap
pointed in that character proceeded to their
destination and attended the sessions of the
Congress. Their report shall in due season
be laid beforo you. This Congress meets
at intervals of about three years, and has
held its sessions in several of tho countries
of Europe. I submit to your considera
tion the propriety of extending an invita
tion to the Congress to hold its next meet
ing in the United States. The centennial
celebration to be held in 1870 would afford
tin appropriate occasion for such meeting.
Preparations are making for the interna
tional exposition to bo held during the next
year in Vienna on a scale of very great
magnitude. The tendency of these expo
sitions is in the direction of advanced civi
lization, and of the eltvation of industry
and of labor, and of the increase of hu
man happiness, as well as of greater inter
course and of good-will between nations.
As the exposition is to bo tho first which
will have been held in eastern Europe, it is
believed that American inventors and man
ufacturers will bo ready to avail themselves
of the opportunity for the presentation of
their productions if encouraged fey proper
aid and protection.
At the last session of Congress authority
was given for the appointment of one or
more agents to represent this Government
at the exposition. The authority thus given
has been exercised, but in the absence of
any appropriation there is danger that the
important benefits which the occasion offers
will, in a large degree, be lost to citizens
of the United States. I commend the sub
ject stroßgly to your consideration, and
recommend that an adequate appropriation
be made for the purpose. To further aid
American exhibitors at the Viena exposi
tion, I would recommend, in addition to an
appropriation of money, that the Secretary
of the Navy bo authorized to fit up two
naval vessels to transport between our At
lantic cities and Trieste, or tho most con
venient port of Vienna and back, their
articles for exhibition.
THE MEXICAN REPUBLIC.
Since your last session the President of
the Mexican Republic, distinguished by his
high character and by his services to his
country, has died. His temporary succes
sor has now been elected with great una
nimity by the people—a proof of confidence
on their part in his patriotism and wisdom
whioh it is believed will be confirmed by
the results of his administration.
It is particularly desirable that nothing
should be loft nndooo by the Government
of either Republic to ntrengthen their rela
tions as neighbors nnd friends. It is much
to bo regretted that many lawless acta con
tinue to disturb the quiet ofthe settlements
on tho border between our territory and
that of Mexico, ond thnt complaints of
wrongs to American citizens in various
parts of the country are made. The revo
lutionary condition in which the neighbor
ing Republic has so long been involved has
in some degree contributed to this disturb
ance. It is to be hoped that with a more
settled rule of order through tho Republic,
which may be expected from the present
Government, the acts of which just com
plaint are made will cease.
The proceedings of the commission un
der the convention with Mexico of tho 4th
of July, 1868, on the subject of claims,
have, unfortunately, been Chocked by an
obstacle for the removal of which mea
sures have been taken by the two Govern
ments which, it is believed, will provo suc
cessful.
Tho commissioners appointed pursuant
to tho joint resolution of Congress on the
7th of May last to inquire into depreda
tions on the Texan frontier have diligently
made investigations in that quarter, and
their researches wero necessarily incom
plete, partly on account of the limited ap
propriation made by Congress. Mexico,
on the part of that Government, has ap
pointed a similar commission to investigate
these outrages. It is not announced offi
cially, but the press of that country state
that the fullest investigation is desired, and
that the cooperation of all parties concern
ed is invited to secure that end. I there
fore recommend that a . pecial appropria
tion be made at the earliest day practica
ble to enable the commissioners on the part
of the United States to return to their la
bors without delay.
THE WAR IN CUBA.
' It is with regret that I have again to an
nounce a continuance of the disturbed con
dition of the island of Cuba. No advance
toward the pacification of the discontented
part of the population has been made.
While the insurrection has gained no advan
tages, and exhibits no more of the elements
of power or of the prospects of ultimate
success than were exhibited a year ago,
Spain, on the other hand, has not succeed
ed in its repression, and the parties stand
apparently in the same relative attitude
which they have occupied for a long time
past.
This contest has lasted now for more
than four years. Were it seen at a distance
from our neighborhood we might be indif
ferent to its result, although humanity
could not be unmoved by many of its inci
dents wherever they might occur. It is,
however, at our door.
I cannot doubt that the continued main
tenance of slavery in Cuba is among the
strongest inducements to the continuance
of this strife. A terrible wrong is the natu
ral cause of a terrible evil. The abolition
of slavery and the introduction of other
reforms in the administration of govern
ment in Cuba could not fail to advance the
restoration of peace and order. It is greatly
to be hoped that the present Liberal Gov
ernment of Spain will voluntarily adopt
this view. The law of emancipation which
was passed more than two years since, has
remained unexecuted, in the absence of
regulations for its enforcement. It was
but a feeble step towards emancipation.but
it was the recognition of right, and was
hailed as such, and exhibited Spain in har
mony with sentiments of humanity and
of justice, and in sympathy with the o'her
Powers of the Christian and civilized world.
Within the past few weeks tho regulations
for carrying out the law of emancipation
have been announced, giving evidence of
the sincerity of intention of the present
Government to carry into effect the law of
1870. I have not failed to urge the consid
eration of the wisdom, the policy and the
justice of a more effective system for the
abolition of the great evil which oppresses
a race and continues a bloody and destruc
tive contest close to our border, as well a?
the expediency and the justice of conceding
reforms of which the propriety is not ques
tioned.
Deeply impressed with the conviction
that tho continuance of slavery is one of
the most active causes of tho continuance
of tho unhappy condition in Cuba, I regret
to believe that citizens of tho United States,
or those claiming to bo such, arc large
holders in Cuba of what is thero claimed as
property, but which in forbidden and de
nounced by tho laws of the United States.
They are thus, in defiance of the spirit of
our own laws, contributing to the continu
ance of this distressing and sickening con
test. In my last annual message I re
ferred to this subject, and I again recom
mend such legislation as may be proper to
denounce and, if not prevent, at least to
discourage American citizens from holding
or dealing in slaves.
SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICAN
GOVERNMENTS.
It is gratifying to announce that the rati
fications of the convention concluded un
der the auspices of this Government be
tween Spain on the one part, and the allied
republics of the Pacific on tlie other, pro
viding for an armistice, havo been ex
changed. A copy of the instrument is
herewith submitted, lt is hoped that this
may be followed by a permanent peace be
tween tho same parties. The differences
which at one time threatened the mainte
nance of peace between Brazil and the
Argentine republic, it is hoped, _re in the
way of satisfactory adjustment.
With the states as with tho republics of
Central and South America wo continue to
maintain the most friendly relations. It is
with regret, however, I announce that the
Government of Venezuela has made no
further payment on account of the award
under the convention of tlie 25th of April,
1800. The latter republic is understood to
be now almost if not quite tranquilized. It
is hoped, therefore, that it will >ose no
time in providing for the unpaid balance
of its debt to the United States, which,
having originated in injuries to our citizens
by Venezuelan authorities, and having
been acknowledged pursuant to a treaty in
the most solemn form known among nations
would seem to deserve a preference over
debts of a different origin and contracted in
a different manner. This subject is again
recommended to tho attention of Congress
for such action as may bo deemed proper.
JAPAN AND CHINA.
Our treaty relations with Japan remain
unchanged. An imposing embassy from
that interesting and progressive nation
visited this eouutry during "tho year that is
passing, but being unprovided with powers
for the signing of a convention in this coun
try, no conclusion in that direction was
reached. It is hoped, however, that the
interchange of opinions which took place
during their stay in this country has led to a
mutual appreciation of tlie interests which
may be promoted when the revision of the
existing treaty shall be undertaken. In
this connection I renew my recommenda
tion 6. one year ago, that to give import
ance and to add to tho efficiency of our
diplomatic relations with Japan and
China, and to further aid in retaining the
good opinion of those pooples, and to
securo to the United States a, share
of the commerce destined to flow be
tween those nations and tlie balance of tho
commercial world, an appropriation be
made to support at least four American
youths in each of those countries to serve
as a part of the official family of our minis
ters there. Our representatives would not
even then be placed upon an equality with
the representative, of Great Britain and of
soma other Powers. As now situated, our
representatives in Japan and China have to
depend for interpreters and translators
upon natives of those countries who know
our language imperfectly, or procure for
the occasion tho services of employe, in
foreign business bouses or the intorpretoi
to other foreign ministers.
TERRITORIES.
I renew the recommendation mado on'a
previous occasion of tho transfer to the De
partment of tho Interior, to which they
seem more appropriately to belong, of all
the powers aud duties in relation to the
territories with which tho Department of
State is now charged by law or by custom.
RF.LIEF OF CITIZENS ABROAD IN DIS
TRESS.
Congress, from tho beginning of the
Government, has wisely mado provision
for the relief of distressed seamen m for
eign countries. No similar provision, how
ever, has hitherto been made for the rolicf
of citizens in c istress abroad other than sea
men. It is understood to bo customary
with other governments to authorize con
suls to extend such relief to their citizens or
subjects iv certain cases.
A similar authority and an appiopiation
to carry it into effect are recommended in
the case of citizens of the United States
destitute or sick uuder such circumstances.
It is well known that such citizens resort
to foreign countries in great numbers.
Though most of them are able to bear the
expenses incident to locomotion, there are
some who, through accident or otherwise,
become penniless, and have no friends at
home ablo to succor them. Persons in
this situation must either perish, cast them
selves upon tho charity of foreigners, or be
relieved at the private charge of ourown of
ficers, who usually, even with the most be
nevolent dispositions, have nothing to spare
for such purposes. Should the authority
and appropriation asked for bo granted,
care will be taken to carry the beneficence
of Congress into such effect that it shall
not be unnecessarily nnd unworthily be
stowed. ) |
TREASURY.
The moneys received and covered into
the Treasury during the fiscal year ending
June 30th, 1872, were : From customs,
$216,370,286.77 ; from sales of public
lands, $2,575,714.19 from internal reve
nue, $130,042,177.72 ; from tax on nation
al bank circulation, A... $0,623,390.39 ;
from Pacific railway companies, $74,980,
--IS7 ; from customs, fines, da., $1,136,442.
-- 34; from fees, consular, patent, land, &c,
$2,284,095.92; from miscellaneous sources,
$4,441,254.71; total ordinary receipts,
$364,094,229.91 ; from premium on sales
of coin, $941,263,705; total net re
ceipts, $374,100,807.50 ; balance in Trea
sury June 30th, 1871, $109,935,705.59,
including $18,228.35 received from unavail
able; total available cash, $484,042,573.15.
The net expenditures by warrants during
the same period were: For civil expenses,
$16,187,059.20; for foreign intercourse,
$1,830,369.14; for Indians, $7,001,728.82;
lor pensions, $28,533,402.70; for military
establishment, including fortification, river
and harbor improvements and arsenals,
$35,372,157.20; for naval establishment,
including vessels and machinery and
improvements at navy-yards, $21,249,
--808.99 ; for miscellaneous civil purposes,
including public buildings, light-houses,
and collecting the revenue, $42,958,329,
--08 ; for interest on the public debt, $117,
--357,839.72 ; total, exclusive ot principal
and premium on tho public debt, $270,559,
--695.91. For premiums on bonds purchased,
$6,958,2C0.7G. For redemption on public
debt, $99,900,253.54. Total, 8100,018,
--520.30. Total receipts and disbursements,
$377,478,210.21. Balance in Treasury
Juno 30, 1872, $100,504,350,94. Total,
$484,042,573.15. From tho foregoing
statement it appears that the reduction of
the principal of the debt during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1872, was
$99,960,253.54. The source of ths
reduction is as follows: Net ordinary
receipts during tho year, $304,094,229.91 ;
net ordinary expenditures, including inter
est on the public debt, $270,559,095.01;
leaving a surplus revenue, $94,134,534; add
amount received from premium on sales of
gold in excess of tho premium paid on
bonds purchased, $2,454,370.89 ; add the
amount of the reduction of the cosh bal
ance at the close of the year, accompanied
with same at the commencement of tho
year, $3,371,348.05—t0ta1, $99,960,253.54.
This stotement treats solely of the princi
pal of the public debt by the monthly
statement of the public debt, which adds to
gether the principal interest due and unpaid,
and the interest accrued to date not due, and
deducts tho cash iv the Treasury as ascer
tained on the day of publication. The re
duction was $100,544,491.28. The source
of this reduction is as follows: Reduction
In principal account, $99,900,003.54 ; re
duction in unpaid interest account, $3,330,
--952.98 — grand total, $103,290,956,50.
Reduction in cash on hand, $2,740,405.22 ;
grand total, $100,544,491.28. On the basis
of the last table the statements show a re
duction ot the pablic debt from the Ist of
March, 1809 to the present time as follows:
From March 1, 1869, to March 1, 1870,
$87,134,782.84; from March 1. 1870, to
March 1. 1871, $117,019,030.25; from
.March 1,1871, to March 1,1872. $94,895,
--218.94 ; from March 1, 1872, to November
1, 1872 (eight months), $04-047,237.84.
Total. $303,690,999.87.
With the great reduction of taxation by
tho acts of Congress at its last session, the
expenditures of the Government in collect
ing the revenue will bo much reduced for
the next fiscal year. It is very doubtful,
however, whether any further reduction of
so vexatious a burthen upon any people
will bo practicable for the present. At all
events, as a measure of justice to the
holders of the nation's certificates of in
debtedness, I would recommend that no
more legislation bo had on this subject un
less it be to correct errors oi* omission or
commission in the present laws, until suf
ficient time has elapsed to prove that it can
be done and still leave sufficient revenue to
meet the current expenses of the Govern
ment, pay interest on the public debt, and
provide for the sinking fund established by
law. The preservation of our national
credit is of the highest importance. Next
in importance to this comes a solemn duty
to provide a national currency of fixed,
unvarying value as compared with gold,
and as soon as practicable, having due re
gard for the interests of tho debtor class
and the. vicissitudes of trade and commerce,
convertible into gold at par.
WAR DEPARTMENT.
The report of tho Secretary of War
shows the expenditures of the War De
partment for the fiscal year ending June
30,1871, to be $35,799,991.82, and for the
fiscal ending June 30, 1872, to bo
$35,3(2,159.20, showing a reduction in fa
vor of the last fiscal year of $427,834.02.
The estimates for military appropriations
for tho next fiscal year ending Juto 30,
1874, are $33,801,370.78. The estimates
of the Chief of Engineers are submitted
separately for fortiflcations,river and harbor
improvements, and for public buildings aud
grounds, and the Washington aqueduct.
Tho affairs of the Freedraan's Bureau have
all been transferred to tho War Depart
ment, and regulations have been put into
execution for the speedy payment of
bounty, pay, &c., duo colored soldiers,
properly coming under that Bureau. All
war accounts for money and property
prior to 1871 have been examined and
transmitted to the Treasury for final settle
ment. During the fiscal year thero has
been paid for transportation on railroads
! $1,300,000, of which $*W,.-7 was over
the Pacific railroad; for transportation by
waterßo2C,373.s_,audby stage $45,975.8.;
and for tho purchase of transportation
animals, wagons, hire of teamsters, etc.,
$924,050.-4. About $370,000 have been
collected from southern railroads during the
year, leaving about $40,000 still due. The
Quatermastcr has examined and trans
mitted to the accounting officers for settle
ment 6307,172.72 of claims by loyal citi
zens for quartermaster's stores taken during
the war. Subsistence supplies to the amount
of $89,048.12 have been issued to Indians.
The annual average mean strength of the
army was 24,101 white and 2,494 colored
soldiers. The total deaths for the year
reported wore 105 white and 54 colored.
The distribution of the Medical and Surgi
cal History of the War Is yet to be ordered
by Congress. There exists an absolute ne
cessity for a medical corps of the full num
ber established by act of Congress of July
28,1806, there being now fifty-nine vacan
cies, and the number of successful app'i
cants rarely exceeds eight or ten in any one
year.
The river and harbor improvements have
been carried on with energy and economy.
Though many are only partially completed,
the results have secured to commerce
greater depth of channel, greater security
in navigation, and the saving of time adds
millions to the wealth of tho country and
increases tho resources of the Government,
The bridge across tho Mississippi river at
Rock Island has been completed, and the
proper site has been determined upon for
the bridge at La Crosse.
The able and exhaust ive report made by
the commissioner appointed to investigate
the Sutro tunnel has been transmitted to
Congress.
The observations and reports of the Sig
nal Office have been continued, stations
have been maintained at each of the princi
pal lake, seaport, and river cities. Ten
additional stations have been established in
the United States, and arrangements have
been made for an exchange of reports with
Canada; and a similar exchange of obser
vations is contemplated with the West
India islands.
The favorable consideration of Congress
is invited to the following recommendation
of the Secretary of War: A discontinu
ance of the appointment of extra lieuten
ants to serve as adjutants and quartermast
ers ; the adoption of a code providing spe
cial penalties for well-defined offences, so
that the inequality of sentences by courts
martial may be adjusted ; the consolidation
of accounts under which expenditures are
made as a measure of economy ; an ap
propriation of the money for tbe construc
tion of a depot at San Antonio, the title to
the site being now perfected ; a special act
placing the cemetery at tho City of Mexico
on the same basis of other national ceme
teries ; authority to purchase sites for
military posts in Texas ; the appointment
ot commissary-sergeants from non-commis
sioned officers as a measure for securing
the better care aud protection of
supplies; an appropriation for tho
publication of the catalogue and tables of
the anatomical section of the army medical
museum ; an appropriation of the amount
for the manulacture of breech-loading
arms, should the selection be so delayed
by the board of officers as to leave the for
mer appropiations unexpended at the close
of the fiscal year; tho sale of such arse
nals east of tho Mississippi as can be
spared, and the proceeds applied to the es
tablishment of one largo arsenal of con
struction and repair upon the Atlantic
coast, and the purchase of a suitable site
for a proving and experimental ground for
heavy ordnance; tho abrogation of laws
which deprive inventors in the United
Stater, service from deriving any benefit
from their inventions; the repeal of the
law prohibiting promotions in the
staff corps; a continuance ofthe work upon
the coast defences; the repeal of the 7Gth
section of the act of July 13th, 1868, tak
ing from engineer soldiets tbe per diem
granted to other troops; limitation of time
for presentation of old war claims for sub
sistence supplies underact of July 4. 1864,
and a modification m the mode of selection
of cadets foi the military academy, in order
to enhance the usefulness of the academy,
which is impaired by reason of the largo
amount of time necessarily expended in
giving now cadots a thorough knowledge
of the mere elementary branches of learn
ing, which they should acquire before en
tering the academy ; also, an appropria
tion tor philosophical a iparatus, and an
increase in the numbers and pay of the
military academy band.
OUR WATER LINEB.
Tho attention of Congress will be called, I
during its present session, to various en- I
terprises for tho moro certain and cheaper
transportation of tho constantly increasing
surplus of western and southern products
to the-Atlantic seabord. The subject is
one that will force itself upon the legisla
tive branch of the Government sooner or
later, and I suggest, therefore, that imme
diato steps be taken to gain all available
information to insure equable and just
legislation. One route, to connect the
Mississippi Valley with tho Atlantic
at Charleston, South Carolina, or Savan
nah, Ga., by water by the way of the
Ohio and Tennessee rivers and canals and
slack-water navigation to the Savannah and
Ocomulgee rivers, has been surveyed and
report made by an accomplished engineer
officer of the army. Second and third,
new routes will be proposed for the consid
eration of Congress—namely, by an exten
sion of the James River and Kanawha canal
to tho Ohio, and by extension of the Ches
apeake and Ohio canal. lam not prepared I
to recommend Government aid to these or
other enterprises until it is clearly shown
that they are not only of national in
lest, but that when completed they will
of a value commensurate with their
it. That production increases more I
>idly than the means of transportation
our country has been demonstrated by
past experience. That the unprecedented
«wth in population and products of the
_le country will require additional facili
and cheaper ones for the more bulky
articlus of commerce to reach tide-water and
a market will be demanded in the near uture
is equally demonstrable. I would therefore
suggest either a committee or commission,
to do authorized to consider this whole
question and report to Congress at some
future day fjr its better guidance in legisla
ting ou this important subject. The railroads
of the country have been rapidly extended
during the last few years to meet the grow
ing demand of producers, and reflect much
credit upon the managers engaged in their
construction. In addition to these, a pro
ject to facilitate commerce by the building
a ship-canal around Niagara Falls on tho
United States side, which has beon agita
ted for many years, will no
doubt bo called to your attention at
this session. Looking to the great future
growth of the country and the increasing
demands of commerce, it might bo well,
while on this subject, not only to havo ex
amined and reported upon the various prac
ticable routes for connecting the Mississippi
with tide-water on the Atlantic, but the
feasibility of an almost continuous land
locked navigation from Maine to tbe Gulf
.of Mexico. Such a route along our coast
would be of great value at all times, and of
inestimable value iv case of a foreign war.
Nature has provided the grade for part of
this route, and the obstacles to be over
come are easily within the skill of the engi
neer. I have not alluded to this subject
wdth a view of having any further expen
tha necc-sary information before Congress
in an authentic form to enable it hereafter,
if deemed practicable and worthy, to legis
late upon the subject without delay,
NAVY DEPARTMINT.
The report of the Sscretary of the Navy,
herewith accompanying, explains fully the
condition of that branch of tho public ser
vice, its wonts and deficiencies, and ex
penses incurred during tho past year, and
appropriations for the same. It also gives a
complete history of tho service of the navy
for the past year- in addition to regular ser-
ytttrs tho united States will be the weakest
nation upon the ocean of all great Powers.
With an energetic, progressive, business
peoplo like ours, penetrating and forming
business relations with every part of the
known world, a navy strong enough to
command the respect of our flagabroad is ne
cessary for the full protection of our rights.
I recommend careful consideration by Con
eress of the recommendation made by the
Secretary of the Navy.
iX-*TOFFICE DKPABTMKNTa
The accompanying report of tho Post
master General furnishes a full and satis
factory exhibit of the operations of tho
Postolfico Department during the year.
The ordinary revenues of the Department
for tho fiscal year ended June 30, 1872,
amounted to $21,015,426.37, and the ex
penditures to $20,058,192.31. Compared
with the previous fiscal year the increase
of revenue was $1,878,380.95, or 937 per
cent., and the increase of expenditures
$2,2G8,088.23, or 929 per cent. Adding
to tho ordinary revenues the annual appro
priation of $700,000 for free matter anil the
amounts paid to the subsidies of mail
steamship lines special appropriation, the
deficiency paid out of the general appro
priation, the deficiency paid out of the gen
eral treasury was $3,317,705,94 —an excess
of $389,707.28 over the deficiency for the
year 1871. Other interesting statistical
information relating to our rapidly extend
ing postal service is furnished in this report.
The total length of lailroad mail-routes on
the 30th of June, 1872, was 57,911 miles, j
8,077 additional miles of such service hav
ing been put into operation during the year.
Eight new lines of railway postoffices have :
been established, with an aggregate length
of 2,909 miles. Tho number of letters ex
changed in the mails with foreign countries
was 24,302,500—increase of 4,000,502, or |
20 percent, over then amber in 1871; and
the postage thereon amounted to $187,125,
--725, The total weight of the mails
exchanged with European countries i
exceeded 820 ton?. The cost of the United
States trans-Atlantic mail steamship i
service was $202,301.70; the total cost of !
the use of ocean steamer service, includ- I
ing the amounts paid to the subsidized lines <
of mail steamers, wa351,027,020.97. The
following are the oniy steamship lines
now receiving subsidies for mail service
under special acts of Coneress : The Paci- i
fie Mail Steamship Company receives <
$500,000 per annum for conveying a month- I
jy mail between' San Francisco, Japan, and 1
China, which will be increased to $1,000,- <
000 per annum for a semi-monthly mail on ■
and after October 1, 1873; the United <
States and Brazil Mail Steamship Company <
receives $150,000 per annum for convey- 1
ing a monthly mail belween New York and i
Rio d$ Janeiro, Brazil ; and the California, |
Oregon and Mexico Steamship Company i
receives $75,000 per year for carrying a
monthly mail between San Francisco i
and Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, making
the total amount of mail steamship subsidies' I
at present $725,000 per annum. Our I
postal communications with all parts of the
civilized world have been placed upon a
most advantageous footing by tho improved
postal conventions aud arrangements re- :
cently concluded with the leading commcr- i
cial countries of Europe and America, and
the gratifying statement is made that with
the conclusion of a satisfactory convention
with France, tho details of which have
been definitely agreed by the head of the I
French Postal Department, subject to the I
approval of the Minister of Finance, little |
remains to be accomplished by treaty for '
somo time to como with respect I
either to reduction of rates or im- i
proved facilities of postal intercourse. ]
Your favorablo consideration is re- i
sportfully invited to the recotnmenda- |
tions of the Postmaster-General for au in- t
crease of sei vice from monthly to semi- ]
monthly trips in the mail steamship route
to Brazil; for a subsidy in aid of the es- i
tablishment of an American line of mail <
steamships between San Francisco and A us- t
tralia ; for tho establishment of post-office I
savings banks, and for the inciease of sala
ries of the heads of bureaus. 1 have hereto
fore recommended the abolition of the frank
ing privilege,and see no reason no w for chang
ing my views on that subject. It not hav
ing been favorably regarded by Congress,
however, I may suggest a modification of
that privilege to correct its glaring and
costly abuses. 1 would recommend also
the appointment of a committee of com
mission to take into consideration the beat
method,equitable to the private corporations
who have invested their time and capital in
the establishment of telegraph lines, of ac
quiring the title to all telegraph lines now in
operation, and of connecting this service
within the postal service of the nation. It
is not probable that this subject could re
ceive the proper consideration during the
limits of a short session of Congress, but it
may be initiated, so that future action
may be fair to the Government and the
private parties concerned. Thero are
but three lines of ocean steamers—namely,
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, be
tween San Francisco, China and Japan,
with provision made for semi-monthly
servico after October Ist, 1873 ; the
United States and Brazil line, monthly;
and the California, New Zealand, and Aus
tralian line, monthly—plying between the
United States and foreign ports, and owned
and operated uuder our flag. I earnestly
recommend that such liberal contracts for
carrying the mails be authorized with these
lines as will insure their continuance, if the
expediency of extending the aid of Govern
ment to linos of steamers which hitherto
have not received it should be deemed wor
thy of the consideration of Congress. Po
litical and commercial objects make it advi
sable to bestow such aid on a line under
our flag between Panama and Western
South American ports. By this means
much trade now diverted to other countries
might be brought to us to tho mutual ad
vantage of this country and those lying in
that quarter of the continent of America.
The report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury will show an alarming falling off in our
carrying trade for the last ten or twelve
years, and even for the past year. 1 do
not believe that public treasure can be bet
ter expended in the interest of the whole
people than in trying to recover this trade.
An expenditure of $5,000,000 per annum
for the next five years, if it would restore
to us our proportion of tho carrying trade
of the world, would be profitably expended.
The price of labor in Lurope has so much
enhanced within the lost few years that the
cost of building and operating ocean steam
ers in the United States is not so much
■ greater than in Europe, and I behove the
time has arrived for Congress to take this
> subject into serious consideration.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
Detailed statements of the disburse
ments through the Department of Justice
will be furnished by the report of the At
torney-General ; and though these have
been somewhat increased by the recent
acts of Congress to enforce the rights of
citizens of tno United States to vote iv the
i sterol States of the Un'on, and to enforce
i t ie provisions of the fourteenth amendment
■ t > the Constitution of tho United States
and tho amendment? .heMo, I cannot
question the necessity and salutary effect
of those enactments. Reckless and law
! le.s men, I regret to say, have associated
therasclvc-s together in some localities to
deprive other citizens of those rights guar
anteed to them by the Constitution of the
United States, and to that end have com
mitted deeds of blood and violence;
but tho prosecution and punishment of
many of these persons havo tended greatly
to tho repression of such disorders. Ido
not doubt that a great majority of the peo
ple in all parts of the country favor tho full
enjoyment by all classes of persons of
those rights to which they are entitled tin
dor the Constitution and law.", and I in
voke tho aid and Influence of all good citi
zens to prevent organizations whos. objects
are, by unlawful means, to interfere with
those rights. I look with confidence to the
time, not far distant, when the obvious ad-
I vantages ol' good order and peace will in
duce an abandonment of all combinations
prohibited by the acts referred to, an.
when it will be unnecessary to carry on
prosecutions or inflict punishment to pro
tect citizens from the lawless doings of
-uch combination.. Applications liave
been made to me to pardon persons
convicted of a violation of said
acts upon the ground that clem
ency in such cases world tend to tranquil
ize the public mind; and to test the virtue
of that policy I am disposed, as far as n_v
sense of justice will permit, to give those
applications a favorable consideration, but
any action thereon is not to be construed
as indicating any change in my determina
tion to enforce with rigor such acts so laog
as the conspiracies and combinations there
in named disturb the peace of the country.
It is much to be regretted, and is regretted
by no one more than myself, that a neces
sity has ever existed to exocute the enforce
ment act. No ono can desire more than t
that the necessity of applying it may never
again be demanded.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.
The Secretary of the Interior reports sat
isfactory improvement and progress in each
of the several bureaus under tho control
ofthe Interior Department. They are all
in excellent condition. The work which in
some of them for some years has been in
arrears has been brought down to a recent
date, and in all, the current business has
been promptly dispatched.
INDIANS.
The policy whicn wa. adopted at the be
ginning of this Administration with regard
to the management of the Indians has been
as successful as its most ardent friends an
ticipated, and it has within so short a time
reduce the expenses of their mamigement,
decreased their forays upon the white set
tlors, tended to give the largest opportunity
for the extension of tho great railways
through the public domain and the pushing
of settlements into more remote districts
of country, and at the same time improved
the condition of the Indians. The policy
will be maintained without any change ex
cepting such as further experience may
show to be necessary to rendor it more effi
cient. Tho subject of converting the so
called Indian territory south of
Kansas into a home for the Indians,
and erecting therein a territorial form of
government, is ono of great importance as
a complement of the existing Indian policy.
The question of removal to that Territory
has within tho past yeas been preseuted to
many of the tribes " resident upon other
and less desirable portions of the public
domain, and has generally been received by
them with favor. As a preliminary step
to the organization of such a Territory, it
will be necessary to confine the Indians
now resident therein to farms of the proper
size, which should bo secured to them in
fee; the residue to be used for the settle
ment of other friendly Indians. Efforts
will be mado in the immediate future
to induce tho removal of us
many peaceably-disposed Indians to
the Indian Territory as can bo settled pro
perly without disturbing the harmony of
those already there. There is no other
location now available where a people who
are endeavoring to acquit _ a knowledge of
pastoral and agricultural pursuits can be
as well accommodated as upon the unoccu
pied lands in the Indian Territory. A
territorial government should, however,
protect tho Indians from tho inroads of
whites for a term of year., until they be
come sufficiently advanced in tbe arts o;
civilization to guard their own rights, and
from the disposal ofthe lands he'd by tbem
for the same period.
LANDS.
During lhe last fiscal year there were dis
posed of out of the public lands 11,864,97-.
acres, a quantity greater by 1,099,270 acres
than was disposed of the previous year. Of
this amount 1,370,320 acres were sold for
cash, 389,460 acres located with military
warrants, 4,071,832 acres taken for home
steads, 093,013 acres located with college
scrip, 3,554,887 acres granted to railroads,
405,317 acres granted to wagon roads, 714,
--755 acres given to States as swamplands,
500 acres located by Indian scrip. Tlie cash
receipts from all sources in the Land Office
amounted to $3,218,190. During tho same
period -2,016,608 acres of tlie public land
were surveyed; whicii, added to tha quantity
before surveyed, amounts to 583,304,780
acres, leaving' 1,237,033,028 acres of the
public landsuasurveyed.
Tho reports from the subordinates of the
[.and Office contain interesting information
in regard to their respective district...
They uniformly mention the fruitlulne-s of
the soil during the past season and the in
creased yield of all kinds of produce. Ev
en in those States and Territories where
mining is the principal business agricultur
al products have exceeded the local de
mand, and liberal shipments have been
mado to distant points.
PATENTS.
During the year ending September 30,
1872, there were issued from the Patent
Office 13,026 patents, 233 extensions, and
550 certificates nnd registries of trade
marks. During the same time 19,587 ap
plications for patenls, including reissues
and designs, have been received, and 3,100
caveats tiled. The fees received during tho
same period amounted to $700,954.80, and
tie total ix.jcnditures to $023,553.90,
---making the net receipts over the expendi
tures $77,400.00. Since 1830 200,000 ap.
plications for patents have been filed and
about 133,000 patents issued.
The offlce is being conducted under the
same laws and general organization as were
adapted at its original inauguration, when
only from one hundred to five hundred ap
plications were mado per annum. The
Commissioner shows that the office has
outgrown the original plan, and that a new
organization has become necessary. Thi",
subject was presented to Congress in a spe
cial communication in February last with
my approval and the approval of tho Sec
retary of the Interior, and the suggestions
contained in said communication were
embraced in the bill that was reported to
the House by the Committee on Patents at
the last session. Tho subject of the re
organization of the Patent Office as con
templated by the bill referred to is one ot
such importance to the industrial interests
of tho country that I commend it to the
attention of Congress.
The Commissioner also treats the sub
ject of the separation of the Patent Offlce
from the Department of the Interior. This
subject is also embraced in tbe bill hereto
fore referred to. The Commissioner corr.
