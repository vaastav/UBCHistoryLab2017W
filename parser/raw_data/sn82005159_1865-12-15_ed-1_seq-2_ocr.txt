the details of its management, reference
is made to the annual report of the Com
missioner.
I have dwelt thus fully on our domes
tic affairs because of their transcendent
importance. Under any circumstances,
our great extent of territory and variety
of climate, producing almost everything
that is necessary for the wants, and even
the comforts of man, make us singular
ly independent of the varying policy of
foreign Powers, and protect us against
every temptation to "entangling allian
ces," while at the present moment the
re-establishment of harmony, and the j
strength that oomes from harmony, will
be our best security against "nations
who feel power and forget rigid." For
myself, it has been and it will be my
constant aim to promote peace and ami
ty with all foreign nations and Powers,
and I have every reason to believe that
they all, without exception, are anima
ted by the same disposition. Our rela
tions with the Emperor of China, so
recent in their origin, are most friend
ly. Our commerce with his dominions
is receiving new developments; and it
is very pleasing to find that the (lovern
ment of that great empire manifests sat
isfaction with our policy, and reposes
just confidence in the fairness which
marks our intercourse. The unbroken
harmony between the Uni ted Statesand
the Emperor of Russia is receiving a
new support from an enterprise design
ed to carry telegraphic lines across the
continent of Asia, through his domin
ions, and so to connect us with all Eu
rope by a new channel of intercourse.
Our commerce with South America is
about to receive encouragement !>> a
direct line of mail steamships to the
rising Empire of Brazil. The distin
guished party of men of science who
have recently left our country to make
a scientific exploration of the natural
history and rivers and mountain ranges
of that region, have received from the
Emperor that generous welcome which
was to have been expected from in
constant friendship for the U. States,
and his well-known zeal in promoting
the advancement of knowledge. A
hope is entertained that onr commerce
with the rich and populous countries
that border the Mediterranean sea may
be largely increased. Nothing will be
wanting,on the part of this Government,
to extend the protection of our flag over
the enterprise of our fellow-citizens. —
We receive from the Powers in that re
gion assurances of good will; and it is
worthy of note that a special envoy lias
brought us messages of condolence on
the death of our late Chief Magistrate
from the Bey of Tunis, whose rule in
cludes the old dominions of Carthage,
on the African coast.
Our domestic contest, now happily j
ended, has left some traces in our rela
tions with one, at least of the great ma
ritime Powers. The formal accordance
of belligerent right to the insurgent
States was unprecedented, and has not
been justified by the issue. But in the
systems of neutrality pursued by the
Powers which made that concession,
there was a marked difference. Thema
terials of war for the insurgent States
were furnished, in agreat measure, from
the workshops of Great Britain, and
British ships, manned by British sub
jects and prepared for receiving British
armaments sailed from the ports of Great
Britain to make war on American com
merce, under the shelter of a commis
sion from the insurgent States.
These ships, having once escaped from j
British ports, ever afterwards entered i
them in every part of the world, to refit,
and so to renew their depredations. The
consequences of this conduct was most
disastrous to the States then in rebellion,
increasing their desolation and misery
by the prolongation of our civil contest.
It had. moreover, the effect to a great
extent, to drive the American flag from
the sea, and to transfer much of our
shipping and commerce to the very
power whose subjects had created the
necessity for such achange. These events
took place before I was called to the
administration of the Government.—
The sincere desire for peace by which 1
am animated led me to approve the pro
posal, already made, tosubmit the ques
tions which hud thus arisen between
the two countries to arbitration.
These questions are of such moment
that they must have commanded the
attention of the great powers, and are
so interwoven with the peace and inter
est of every one of them as to have in
sured an impartial decision. 1 regret
to inform you that Great Britain declin
ed the arbitrament, but, on the other
hand, invited us to the formation of a
jointcommission to settle mutual claims
between the two countries, from which
those for the depredations before men
tioned should be excluded. The prop
osition, in that very unsatisfactory form,
has been declined.
The United States did not present this
object as an impeachment of the good
faith of a power which was professing
the most friendly dispositions, but a<
nvolving questions of public law, of
which the settlement is essential to tin
peace of a nation ; and although pecun
iary reparation to their injured citizens
would have followed incidentally on a
decision against Great Britain, such
compensation was not their primary
object. They had a higher motive, and
it was in the interest of peace and jus
tice to establish important principles of
international Law. The correspondence
will be placed before you.
The ground on which the British Min
ister rests his justification is, substan
tially, that the municipal law of a na
tion, and the domestic interpretation of
that law, are the measure of its duty asa
neutral, and 1 feel bound to declare my
opinion before you and before the world,
that justification cannot be sustained l>e
fore the tribunal of nations. At the
same time I do not advise to any pres
ent attempt at redress by acts of legis
lation. For the future, friendship be
tween the two countries must rest on
the basis of mutual justice.
FromtheniomentoftheestablGlinient
of our free Constitution, the civilized
world has been convulsed by revolu
tions in the interests of democracy or of
monarchy; but through all those revo
lutions the United States have wisely
and firmly refused to become propagan
dists of republicanism. It is the only
government suited to our condition;
but we have never sought to impose it
on others, and we have consistently
followed theadviceof Washington to re
commend it only by the careful preser
vation and prudent use of the blessing.
During all the intervening period the
policy of European powers and of the
United States has, on the whole, been
harmonious. Twice indeed, rumors of
the invasion of some parts of America,
in the interest of monarchy, have pre
vailed ; twice my predecessors havehad
occasion to announce the views of this
nation in respect to such interference.
On both occasions the remonstrance
of the United States was respected, from
a deep conviction on the part of Euro
pean governments, that the system of
non-interference and mutual abstinence
from propagandism was the true rule
for the two hemispheres. Since those
times we have advanced in wealth and
power, but we retain the same purpose
to leave the nations of Europe to choose
their own dynasties and form their own
systems of government. This insis
tent moderation may justly demand a
corresponding moderation." We should
regard it as a great calamity to ourselves,
to the cause of good government, and
to the peace of the world, should any
European [tower challenge the Ameri
can people, as it were, to the defence of
republicanism against foreign interfer
ence. '
We cannot foresee and are unwilling ,
to consider what opportunities might
present themselves, what combinations
might otter to protect ourselves against
designs inimical to our form of govern
ment. The United States desire to actj
in the future as they have ever acted
heretofore; they will never la 1 driven
from that course but by the aggression
of European Powers; and we rely on
the wisdom and justice of those Powers
to respect thesysteni of non-interference
which has so long been sanctioned by j
time, and which by its good results, has
approved itself to both continents.
The correspondence between the I ni
ted States and France, in reference to!
questions which have become subjects
of discussion between the two Govern
ments, will, at a proper time be laid be
fore Congress.
When tin the organization of our
; Government, under the Constitution,
the President of the United States de
livered his inaugural address to the
two Houses <>f Congress he said to them,
and through them to the country and
1 to mankind, that "the preservation ol
the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny
, of the republican model ol government,
| arejustlv considered as deeply, perhaps
i a> finally staked on the experiment in
! trusted to the American people."
And the House of Representntiyesau
i swered Washington by the voice ot
Madison: "We adore the in visible hat id j
j which has led the American people j
through so many difficulties, to cherish
1 a conscious responsibility tor the desti
;ny of republican liberty." More than
seventy-six years have glided away
since these words were spoken; the I"- j
n ited States have passed through sever
! er trials than were foreseen ; and now,
atthis new epoch in our existence as one
j nation, with our Union purified by sor- j
rows, and strengthened by conflict, and j
established by the virtue of the people, j
the greatness of tit*- occasion invites us
once more to repeat, with solemnity, ;
the pledges of our fathers to hold our
selves answerable before our fellow-men
for the success of the republican form j
| of government.
Experience has proved its sufficiency
!in peace and in war: it has vindicated
its authority through dangers and afflic
tions, and sudden and terrible emergen
cies, which would have crushed any
system that had been less firmly fixed j
iii the hearts of the people. At the in
auguration of Washington the foreign
! relations of the country were few, and
its trade was repressed by hostile regu-;
lations; now, all the civilized nations of
the globe welcome our commerce, and
their Governments profess towards us j
amity.
Then our country felt its way hesita
tingly along an untried path with States j
so little bound together by rapid means i
of communication as to be hardly known ;
i to one another, and with historic tradi
. tions extending over very few years;
| now intercourse between the States is
swift and intimate; the experience of
j centuries has been crowded into a few
generations and has created an intense,
indestructible nationality.
Then our jurisdiction did not reach
beyond the inconvenient boundaries of
the territory which had achieved inde
pendence ; now, through cessions of:
lands, first colonized by Spain and \
France, thecountry has acquireda more |
complex character, and lias for its na-;
turai limits the chain of lakes, the.gulf
of Mexico, and on the east and the west
the two great oceans.
Other nations were wasted by civil
wars for ages before they could <estab
lish for themselves the necessary degree
of unity; the latent conviction that our
form of Government is the best ever
known to the world, has enabled us to
einergefrom civil war within fouryears,
with a complete vindication ot the
constitutional authority of the General
Government, and with our local liber
ties and State institutions unimpaired.
The throngs of emigrants that crowd
to our shores are witnesses of the con
fidenceofall peoples in our permanence.
Here is the great land of free labor,
where industry is blessed with unex
i am pled rewards, and the bread of the
I working man i- sweetened by the con
sciousness that the cause of the country
"is his own cause, his own safety, his
own dignity." Here every one enjoys
thefreeuseof his facultiesand thechoice
|of activity as a natural right. Here,
under theeombined influence of a fruit
ful soil, genial climes and happy insti
tutions, population has increased fifteen
fold within a century.
Here, through the easy development
of boundless resources, wealth ha.- in
j creased with two fold greater rapidity
than numbers, -o that we have become
, secure against the financial vicissitudes
i of other countries, and, alike in busi
ness and in opinion, arc self-centred
i and truly independent. Here more
i and more care is given to provide edu-
I cation for every one born on the soil.—
| Here religion, released from political
i connection with the civil Government,
j refuses to subserve the craft of states
; men, and becomes, in independence,
; the spiritual life of the people. Here
j toleration is extended to every opinion,
in the quiet certainty that truth needs
i only a fair field to secure the victory.
Here the human mind goes forth un
shackled in the pursuit of science, to
j collect stores of knowledge and acquire
; an ever increasing mastery over thefor
: ces of nature. Here the national do
| main is ottered and held in millions of
\ separate freeholds, so that our fellow
j citizens, beyond the occupants of any
I other part 'of the earth, constitute in
reality a ]>eople. Here exists the dem
ocratic form of government, and that
i form of government, by the confession
j of European statesmen, "gives a power
| of which no other form is capable, be
! cause it incorporates every man with
i the State, and arouses everything that
; belongs to the soul."
Where in past history does a parallel
exist to the public happiness which is
within the reach of the people of the
j United States? where, in any part of
1 the glolie, can institutions he found so
I suited to their habits or so entitled to
their love as their own free Constitu
tion? Every one of them, in what
ever part of the land he has his home,
must wish its perpetuity. Who of
them will j not now acknowledge, in
the words of Washington, that "every
i stop by which the people of the United
! States have advanced to the character
j of an independent nation, seems to have
been distinguished by some token of
: providential agency?"
Who will not join with me in the
I prayer, that the invisible hand which
has' led us through the clouds that
i gloomed around our path, will so guide
| us onward to a perlect restoration of
fraternal afleetion, that we of this day
I may be able to transmit our great in
heritance, of State Governments in all
their rights, of the General Govern
ment in its whole constitutional vigor,
to our posterity, and they to theirs
through countless generations.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
WASHINGTON, DEC. (, 1865.
I Ex-Gen. Mahone, of the rebel army,
has been chosen President of the South
side (Va.) Railroad Company.
C' hf T-tiHortl ® affile,

There is an old saw about the rower
looking one way and pulling another,;
which might almost, yet not quite, fair
ly be applied to the character of Presi
dent Johnson's first annual message.
The face of the chief magistrate is turn- j
ed toward the beacon-lights set up by
the old Democratic mariners who nav
igated the stormy ocean of politics in
years gone by, Hut, though he seems to
desire that the ship of state may not
deviate from the course which they in
dicate, he trusts the helm too much to
the hands of those who steer in the
wrong direction, and we fear us much
he will yet permit the good old ship to
drift upon the treacherous rocks of the
Black Sea toward which he seems to be
unconsciously sailing. To drop the fig
ure, the President certainly adheres to
what is vulgarly known as his "recon
struction policy." He re-iterates, what
he has often declared, that the States in
insurrection, did not, by the insurgent
acts of their people (nor could they by
any act whatever) dissolve their con
stitutional, or political, relation to the
i other States of the Union; that they
were never out of the Union, legally
speaking; and that, therefore, having
performed certain acts necessary to as
surethe Executive and Congress of their
submission to the Federal Government,
they are now STATES IN THE UNION,
| just as they were prior to the breaking
out of the war. Just here, we think,
the President should have recommend
ed Congress to admit to si-ats the mem
bers of that body elected by the people
j of the Southern States. He should have
made the admission of those Congress
men a measure of his administration.
He should have said to Congress, these
men are your peers, and, if legally e
i lected, you are bound to admit them.
It is true the President hints as much,
when he says,
"The amendment to the Constitution
! being adopted, it would remain for the
States, whose [lowers have been so long
in abeyance, to resume their place* in the
two branches of the Xat tonal Ijegixfature,
j and thereby complete the work of restora
tion."
But it is not the business of Presidents j
tohint. Plain people cannot understand i
how the Federal Executive can have j
the courage to hang people without trial
by jury, and yet fear to speak his senti
ments to a rump Congress. The Presi
dent might as well have spoken boldly j
upon this subject. The Radicals under- j
stand him, at any rate. They have no j
respect for him on account of his timid
ity, and in their Congressional caucus j
they spat upon his suggestion that "it |
is for you, fellow citizens of the Senate j
and for you, fellow citizensof the House ;
of Representatives, to judge, each of you
for you rue/res, of the elections, returns, i
and qualifications of your own mem- :
bers." It is, indeed, a fact, that the
Constitution provides to this effect, but;
what care, the Radicals for the Constitu
tion, or for the matter of that, what
care they for even the President ? Their
caucus resolution recommending the j
appointment of a joint committee of!
nine Members and six Senators, to pass i
upon the right of Members and Sena
tors from Southern states to seats in j
either house, is a direct assault upon t
this doctrine of the Constitution and I
the President. By the operations of
that committee, "you, fellow citizens
of the Senate and you, fellow citizens j
of the House," cannot "judge, each <>f\
you for yourselves, of the election, Ac., j
of your members." The nine member* '
of the committee from the Jlouse could
determine whet should or should not, hare :
seats in the Senate: and the six numbers I
of the committee from the Senate, with j
two of those from the House, could de
cide who should have seats in the House. \
Thus it will he seen, that the Radicals
do not heed the President's mild sug
gestion, and that so far as his influence
upon their conduct is concerned, he
might as well have spoken with a little j
more positiveness and decision.
There is much in the message which
we heartily endorse. There is much in
it which we know our political oppon
ents cannot approve. The theory of the
indestructibility of the States, so clearly
set forth hv the President, lies at the
very foundation of our political system.
It is the corner-stone of Republican lib
erty, and, therefore, the basis of the
Democratic organization, it is the very
opposite of the doctrine of Thaddeus
Stevens andthe centralization ists, to wit,
that the states lately in iasurrection,
are conquered territory and must be
governed, as such, by Congress. This is
the great, overshadowing topic of the
message and finding the President right
upon this, we can afford to overlook
his failure to come up to our ideas of
propriety on subjects of minor impor
tance. At all events, taking the mes
sage as a whole, "reconstruction," "ne
groes," "Monroe doctrine," "currency"
and all, it is a great improvement on
any similar document, given to tliepub
lic within the last fouryears. There
fore, let us be thankful.
THE official vote of the State, at the
recent election, was, for Campbell, Ab
olitionist, 2:17.907; for Linton, Demo
crat, 215,981; Campbell's majority, 21,-
9S<>. This includes the fraudulent re
turns of soldiers'votes in Philadelphia,
acknowledged by even the Al>oiition
papers to have been forged, which be
ing deducted, would make Campbell's
majority about 19,000, or nearly 2,000
less than Lincoln's, last year.
THE Clerk of the House of Repre
sentatives at Washington, has refused
to place the name of Gen. C'offroth, as
well as that of Gen. Koontz, upon the
roll, as member elect for this Congres
sional District. The case has gone to
the Committee on Elections.
THEKK seems to bo "quite a pretty
quarrel asitsstaiuis," iK-twoon the friends
of < ion. Grant and those of K.\. (ion.
Butler. It appears that (ten. Grant al
ways Inula sovereign contempt for the
hero of Big Bethel and that his want
of appreciation of the superb military
talents of the Massachusetts favorite,
was increased to such a degree by the
defeat at Bermuda Hundred and the
failure of the first expedition against
Fort Fisher, that it forced itself into
language in the report of the Lieuten
ant General, just published. Of Gen.
Butler's management at Bermuda Hun
dred, Gen. Grant speaks in the most
contemptuous terms. He says that
Beauregard held him as tight as if In
laid "corked him up iu a bottle." In
regard to the Fort Fisher affair, he tells
us that he was under the impression that
Gen. Weitzel was to be commanding
ing officer of the expedition and that
he was not aware of Gen. Butler's being
in command until he was advised of
the failure of the attack! On the other
hand, (fen. Butler is reported to have
said that he has "a rod in pickle" for
the Lieut. General. What kind of a
rod it is, time will show. < hie thing is
certain, the Democrats are now sus
tained by Gen. Grant in all they ever
said against Butler's military incapaci
ty. Had their demand for his remo
val been listened to, the war might
have been ended a year before it was
and hundreds of thousands of livesand
millionsof treasure saved to the coun
try. Perhaps some people can "see it"
now.
WK would like to have the opinion
of some of our so-called "Republican"
cotemporaries on that part of President
Johnson's message in which he discus
ses the question of conferring suffrage
upon the negro, iie say-,
"A concession of the elective fran
chise to the freedmen, by act of the
President of the United States, must
have been extended to all colored men,
wherever found, and so must have es
tablished a change of suffrage in the
Northern, Middle and Western States,
not leas than in the Southern and South
western. Such an act would have crea
ted a new class of voters, and would
have been an assumption of power l>v
the President which nothingin the Con
stitution or laws of the United State
would have warranted."
Do you believe this doctrine, Messrs.
Abolitionists? If not, have you the
courage to say so? The people want to
know whether you are for Andy John
son, or against him. Last fall you pro
fessed to support him and you managed
j to juggle through the campaign in such
I a manner as induced many of your par
ty to believe that you did support the
President and that you antagonized
those who demanded that he should, in
violation of his oath to support the Con
stitution, give the freed negroes of the
South the right of suffrage. What say
you now? Are you for the President,
on this subject, or against him? Let
us hear from you, else people will he
gin to think you are afraid to answer.
THE only excuse (and oh ! how lame
and wretched it isivhich theabolition
ists are able to conjire up for their fail
ure to make good t heir charge- against
John P. Reed, Jr., is, that the jury
which acquitted him, was composed of
Democrats! Will they please name a
ny one of that jury who they believe
perjured himself? Come, now, leave
off your "glittering generalities" and
"comedown to dots!"
For the Gazette.
At oncny or EUKOKS.
There wa# quite a sensation at "Bran
dy Station" —not the Brandy Station in
the Old Dominion, but one in another
state that never seceded. <)n "last tirst
day," some gentlemen of leisure, who
say a threat many things besides their
prayers, and do somethings more than
serving Ood and saving their country,
had met as usual to recount their moral
and intellectual achievementsand deeds
of knight errantry, to masticate tobac
co, smoke cigars, pipes, Ac. On com
paring notes, these men of steady hab
its and profound intelligence thought
they discovered that 1. T. had, with
out their knowledge or consent, given
them a gratuitous ride in the "Car of
Progress," on the "Keystone Bail
Road." All was consternation, alarm,
commotion —a perfect tempest in a tea
pot. A ride in the gently moving "Car
of Progress" was not to he so much ob
jected to; but to he drawn over the
track by the vile, shrieking, copper
lined engine GAZETTE, was more than
their sensitive nature could endure.
The cream of the joke is, C. T. did not
suspect that these gentlemen patroni
zed the "Car of Progress," hut suppo
sed they travelled on the old ftroad line
which was never severed or destroyed,
and needs no car of progress or recon
struction. Something tnn.d lie done to
punish IT.l T . T. for hi# fancied offense. As
all men, women and children, have an
instinctive dread of snakes, these con
siderate gentlemen thought it would be
convenient to raise the cry of "Copper
head." -V choice specimen of humani
ty volunteered his services, to perform
this work of benevolence. Another
grand blunder! U, T. nerer had any
affiliation with the "Copperhead,"
" Woollyhead" or "Black Snake" tribes.
1 Lis record is pure and above suspicion,
1 hiring the dark days of the Republic,
his motto was," The Union, the (bndi
futionand the Enforcement of the Laws;'' 1
in connexion with the precepts of still
higher authority, "1 submit to the pow
ers which be;" "Render unto Cesar the
tilings which are Cesar's." Moreover,
he believes that men who violate law
should he punished according to law,
and that persecution or proscription,
for opinion's sake, where no law is vi
olated, is the essence of tyranny. If
that is treason, or copperheadism, gen
tlemen may make the best of it. Any
man of the jxmte-hotu-d profession, or
any other profession or vocation, who
says that U. T. is wanting iu "loyalty,"
or is not "all right on the goose ques
tion," ties under a great mistake.
After maturedeliberation, and much
interchange of thought, the "Brnndy
►Station" a-sembly csune to the grave
conclusion that I'. T. must he brought
iuto subjection on the same principle
that Lee was forced to evacuate Rich
mond, by having his supplies enl oil.
Another error ! II is presumable that
these gentlemanly latter-day saints
have enough to answer for already,
without burdening their consciences
with the additional guilt of subjecting
an inoffensive old man to the excrucia
ting tortures of starvation, in the".Shad
ow of the mountain."
Moreover, I". T.. though not a mili
tary tactician, rather than submit to
such a dubious experiment, would, in
imitation of another great general i who
was worsted in a light of several days'
continuance i change hi* bate, by an ad
mirablestrategiemovement. In short,
such a comedy of errors, probably, has
not been enacted since the good old
times of Will Shakspeare. U. T. did
not intend to disquiet the nerves of any
one. It was foolish on the part of Jhc
scientific gentlemen, to let their pots
boil over before the fire was put under.
U. T. will agree to march with all who
will march with him in ways of right
eousness, -md keep step to the music of
the Union. But, as for taking the wug
train, on the downward track to Brim
stone Station, lie must say, with ail def
erence, gentlemen, please- excuse me.
UNCLE TOBY.
SHAUOW \>r THE MOI-.NTAI.V. Dec. 7, 1865.
Tin- Proceeding* <if CouK'rcMt awl (he
President's Position.
The people of this country have been
indulging the hope for the last few
months that the war was being closed
up, its wounds were being healed, and
that we were about to emerge from the
shock of domestic convulsions to peace
and harmony. They believed, as speak
er Colfax said in his opening address to
Congresson Monday, that "peace reign
ed from shore to shore in our land."
They thought, from the universal -up
port given to President Johnson and
the eulogiurns passed upom him and
his policy by all parties, during the
late elections, that we had entered up
on a new and an astonishing period of
harmony. In fact, there was no other
issue hut this. Both republicans and
democrats claimed the President, and
made him and his policy their platform.
The former were paticularly positive
and earnest in their appeals to the peo
ple on this; and it was on that ground,
doubtless, they obtained such an over
whelming success over their opponents.
It was the doubt which existed as to
the sincerity of the democrats in pro
fessing to support the President that
defeated them, and confidence in the
professions of the republicans that gave
them the victory. At the time the
President was making as much prog
ress as possible to restore the Southern
states and to have their representatives
ready to take seats in Congrcsshisname
was the banner and the battle cry of
the elections. Yes, many of the repub
lican members now sittng in Congress
triumphed through carrying the ban
ner of Andy Johnson.
That is one side of the picture. Now
let us look at the other. The smoke of
the contest is hardly cleared away; for
many days, or weeks, at farthest* have
not passed since theelection. The Pres
ident has not changed in the meantime,
except that he has been more urgent
and emphatic in demanding of the
South such measures as will satisfy the
North. Yet in the face of these facts
we see a sudden assault made upon
Mr. Johnson's policy by the very party
which claimed him, and by the very
men who obtained their seats through
using his name and pretending to -lip
pot him. They did not even wait till
the President could inform them by
message what he was doing and pro
posed to do, or what was the condition
of affairs. A decent respect to the
Chief Magistrate and for the views he
might express in the mode prescribed
by the constitution was the least that
might have been expected from those
who claimed to be his party and who
so lately professed to be his warm sup
porters. it is the first Congress, webe
j lieve, that ever acted in such a manner,
j and the act shows plainly the revolu
tionary character of that body. Never
; in the history of the country had the
chief of the nation such important mat
ter to communicate and submit to Con
gress; never did that body need full
official information more, and never
: was careful deliberation more required.
Vet the first day—the first ! urs of the
session—before the President had time
to send his message, these men began
to legislateon the most important ques
tions, and that in a manner directly in
conflict with his policy. Why this un
seemly haste? Why this disrespect
land covert hostility to the President?
WesiipposoThaddeusStcvens, Sumner,
Wade, Wilson and other revolutionary
radicals of that stripeean tell the reason;
but we think the greater part of the
I conservative republicans can not.
Looking at both sides of this picture
we do not hesitate to say that there
never was a greater fraud committed
upon a people—upon their constituen
cies—than the members lately elected
to this Congress have committed—that
is, judging from their conduct at the
commencement of the session. We can
only hope that the majority have been
deceived themselves —carried away, as
it were, in an unguarded moment by an
artful and unscrupulous conspiracy, and
that they may get out of the trap into
which they have fallen. The whole
proceedings, the snap judgment that
was taken, the concert of action in both
houses, the leaders of the movement,
as Sumner, Thad Stevens, Ben Wade,
and Wilson; the radical revolutionary
measures initiated and the secrecy main
tained till the last moment—all show
that it was a matured conspiracy a
gainst the President and his policy. It
reminds us of the convention during
the French Revolution. That is the
nearest parallel in history we know of.
Our Jacobins arc as rabid, impractica
ble and prescriptive as the Jacobins of
the French Revolution were, and if al
lowed to have their own way they will
plunge the country into the same bloody
anarchy as their prototypes did France.
We hear with pleasure, however, that
some of the members of the House —
and the members of this great State are
particulary mentioned —are alarmed at
the false step they have been dragged
into, and will not follow the lead of our
American Marats, ('outhons and Robe
spierre* any farther.
Congress, it is true, can refuse to ad
mit members from the Southern States;
for each house is the judge in such ca
ses, and a majority rules. The consti
tutionality of rejecting the members
from whole States, and of the present
proceedings of < 'ongvess on the subject ,
are very questionable; but the Presi
dent has no power over the matter.
All he can do is to restore the States to
that point, put all their local State ma
chinery in motion, withdraw the mili
tary, and leave them in the enjoyment
of local self-government. lie ought,
and we think he will, pursue the even
tenor of his way in rvntorinfr them,
fir- c. n perform his duty, if ('oiiirrt'-ss
dot - nut perform Stsduty. If thathody
lie ivvo!ution:iry and anarchical, he can
lie conservative. A conflict between
the policy of the Executive and Con
gress on this subject would be very un
fortunate, would embarrass our finan
ces, paralyze our industry, and briny
many evils upon us, but would not in c
essarily be the worst of evils. The
country would be kept disturbed an
other year or so: but the people would
settle the difficulty at the next elections.
Should the Southern Stales be kept out
of this Congress it is quite evident the
next Congress would be chosen of a dif
ferent character. A new conservative
party would grow up and sink the fac
tion that has now attained power by a
gross political fraud deeper titan ever
plummet sounded. If the President
pursues firmly the even tenor of his
statesmanlike poiiey, he may he as-ured
the conservative masses will approve
of his course, and, sis soon as they can
speak, will choose a different set of men
to sustain him.—A*. I*. JlerraM.
