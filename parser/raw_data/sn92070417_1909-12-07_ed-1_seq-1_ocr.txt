Joe Cannon in his desire to have
some member of his family represent

OLD-TIME LAS VEGAN f
DIES AT CIMARRON
1 Washington, Dec. 7- The first an
nual message of President Taft waa
read to both houses of the Sixty-first
congress today. The reading waa fol
lowed with great interest by repub
licans and democrats alike. It was
favorably commented upon generally.
When, the reading of the message was
concluded both the senate and house
djourned until Friday. In the mess
age the tariff, the Nicaraguan ques-1
tion, BUgar frauds, traffic in white
slavery and statehood for New Mex
ico and Arizona, are among the most
important questions discussed.
"Perhaps the most important ques
tion presented to this administration
is that ot economy in expenditure and
sufficiency ot revenue," says the presi
dent, who discusses the methods tak
en to meet the deficit. The president
declares It unwise to attempt further
revision ot the tariff until the facts
are at hand upon which such revision
can properly be undertaken. Speak'
ing generally he says the country is
In a high state of prosperity. He notes
the increase in the cost of living but
says the tariff is not the cause. In
these products of the factory, and
farm there has been no increase in
the tariff and In. many instances a
very considerable reduction, the pres
ident declares. In beginning, the
president says:
"The relations of the United States
with all foreign governments have
.' continued the normal basis of amity
and good understanding and are very
generally satisfactory."
"At the date when this message
is printed' this government has term
inated diplomatic - relations with the
Zelaya government for reasons made
public in a communication to the for
mer Nicaraguan charge d'affaires end
is intending to take such future steps
as may "be found most consistent with
its dignity. Its duty to American In
terests and its moral obligations to
Central America and to civilization.
It may be necessary for ma to bring
this subject to the attention of con
gress in a special message."
Concerning the Far East, the presi
dent says this government preserves
unchanged its policy ' of supporting
the "open door" and adds:
"Our traditional relations with the
Japanese empire continue cordial as
usual. The arrangement ot 1908 for
a cooperative control of the coming
of laborers to the United States has
proved to work satisfactorily."
Reorganization of the department
of state upon modern lines in further
ance of our foreign trades of Ameri
can interests abroad Is recommend
ed. Economy Urged.
"Perhaps," continues the message,
"the most important question present
ed to this administration is that of
economy in expenditures and suffic
iency of revenue.
"The report of the secretary shows
that the ordinary expenditures for the
current fiscal year ending June 30,
1910, will exceed the receipts by
$34,070,620. If to this deficit is added
the sum to be disbursed for-the Pan
ama canal amounting to $38,000,000,
and $1,000,000 to be paid on the public
News reached the city this moriing
that Marcial Trujillo an old-time tesl
dent of Las Vegas, died yesterday at
Cimarron, Colfax county. The cause
of his death was old age. Mr. Trujillo
was for many years a resident of the
West Side' and was known to most
every one as "The old Shoemaker."
He was about 78 years of age and
died in bachelorhood, never having
taken a partner in life. Jose Trujillo,
a brother of the deceased, who is em
ployed at the territorial insane asy
lum, left this afternoon for Cimarron
to look after his brother's Interests
and to attend the funeral, which will

SANTA FE PASSENGER
THROWS FIT ON. TRAfNl
I. M. Davis, a recruit in the United
(States Marine corps, created some
little excitement! on eastbound 'passen
ier train No.. 8 yesterday morning,
by throwing a -fit In his berth in a
tourist sleeper. A noise resembling
that of the - breaking of a window
clasps came to ,tfe ,ears of the conduc
tor and he rush 3d to the berth where
Davis . was. aodL on. Jooking in to in
quire into . te; , trouble, . saw Davis
hanging half out 'of the, window. The
conductor" immediately got a hold of
Davis and pulled him back into his
berth. Davis explained after he had
regained consciousness that he was
subject to epileptic fits. This waa
probably true as the" man showed no
signs of having indulged in any li
quor. "
Boston, Dec. 7.-i Fair trade still
continues In the. local wool idarket,
although all transactions are In mod

fully maintained. Fine staple Idaho
has sold at 25 cents and fine medium
clothing territory at 23 cents. There
is very little demand for Ohio fleeces,
although a few transactions in quart

GEORGE P. SHELDON CRITICAL-
LY ILL WITH AFFECTION
OF THE HEART
New York, Dec. 7. The criminal
Investigation and prosecution of mat
ters of the Phoenix Insurance com
pany 0f Brooklyn, the surplus of
which, according to a statement is
sued by State Superintendent of In
surance Hotchkiss, has been Impair
ed a million dollars, will now be
abandoned because of the possible
fatal illness of George P. Sheldon, the
deposed president of that company.
Mr. Sheldon was removed yesterday
at the instigation of the state insur
ance department. His case has been
placed in the handh of the district
attorney.' The insurance department
believes the company's risks to the
public will not be involved and that
the entire loss through loans negoti
ated by Sheldon can be balanced, by
crosping oft a million of the ' com
pany's three million dollar surplus."
' Although " the investigation shows
that Sheldon managed the company's
affairs without consulting the board
of directors, Superintendent Hotch
kiss declares each of the directors Is
responsible under ' the law. The
charges which led to Sheldon's remov
al were iiiat he had overdrawn his
salary, unloaded doubtful securities
on the company and used the com
pany's assets as collateral to secure
his own private speculative accounts.
In a formal statement Issued today,
Superintendent Hotchkiss does not
believe the capital of the company is
impaired and thus far there is no
L .
ministration, annual reports of the
company made' to he insurance de
partment In ten years and probably
longer are false in more than one par
ticular. ' g-' -
Under the law the insurance de
partment is required to examine all
life insurance companies at least
once in thee years. Mr. Hotchkiss
advocates an increase In the exam
ining force that Insurance companies
other than life companies may be ex
amined at least once . every' five
years.' Mr. (Hotchkiss says the Phoe
nix company, which is a fire concern,
has not been examined for nearly
twenty-two years. :.
The, 'insurance department alleges
that It finds tbe questionable securi
ties originally sold to the company
by Mr. Sheldon, have, year after year,
passed through wash sales and by
thfs method, been concealed-in the
annual report. ' Speculative accounts
have been maintained by President
Sheldon, according to Mr, Hotchkiss,
at least one brokerage ''nouse and "the
assets of thePioenix have been up
as collateral to foer his operations)
It Is charged also , that for several
years the president's'' salary arcount
has been overdrawn ana now :s PjiiUJ

Clay Pierce, president of the Waters'
Pierce Oil company, charged with
false swearing, this morning returned
a verdict of not guilty. . i
Judge Calhoun, in a special charge

of Mr. Pierce's lawyers that he was
immune from trial under the laws
of Texas, as counsel for the state had
sought to use testimony given by
Mr. Pierce. on the witness stand in
Missouri with the intention of possib
ly securing his conviction.
The sale of the Waters-Pierce Oil
company's property was: postponed
by Judge Wilcox until . late today.
This was done, it Is stated, in order
to permit Pierce's lawyers to inter

i St. Petersburg, Dec. J.f fte'alarn
Ing reports concerning the condition
of the, empress of Russia, are origin
ating pally rrom irresponsible sourc
es. There is no truth whatever in
these stories. It is a well known fact
that the empress has suffered for
two years past from the effects of a

her condition is nol considered critic

Chicago, Dec 7. Tom McCarey, of
Los Angeles, one of the "unsuccessful
bidders for the big Jeffries-Johnson
fight, passed through Chicago yetser
day, on his way to the coast
'I consider Johnson one of the most
wonderful men who ever stepped In
to a ring,'.' said McCarey. "And any
one who thinks he is just going into
the arena to take the count may have
to revise his opinion. Not that I say
Jeffriea is going to lose and Johnson
win. I am not picking the winner,
but just giving my opinion of Jack
asr a fighter, I don't think I ever saw
a swifter man in the ring. Ha is the
most wonderful blocker In the world
and therein lies his strength. It is
next to impossible to hit him."
