KELVIN GAMBLERS SHOOT TO KILL
FLORENCE. Dec. 4. John Roberts,
who has been running a roulette wheel
In Billy Gamble's saloon at Kelvin for
some time past, was shot In thetetom
ach by John Devance (better Known
as Texas Bob) last Sunday, and died
at the Florence hospital Tuesday
morning. Pedro Carrlllo. who was
sitting on a bench in front of the sa
loon, was also Killed by a stray bullet
from Devance's pistol. The principals
In the tragedy had a quarrel some time
ago that came near resulting in n gun
duel, but the quarrel was patched up
and no more trouble was anticipated.
According to reports, the shooting
Sunday night resulted from a state
ment by the deceased to the effect
that Devance was part negro. It 13
said that when Devance was Informed
of this statement, he armed himself,

he says:
"It would seem to be rather more
suitable and efficient for the aggrieved
shippers to bring their suits In courts
in the first instance. "We have, how
ever, ordered an Investigation of this
matter of car shortage, and will prose

'
This appears the most effective course
the commission can take, and you may
be sure that everything will be done
within the scope of authority to bring)
about the earliest possible relief."
Senator Hansbrough has written ,
several letters to the commission call
ing attention to car shortage, declar
ing the situation to be so serious as to
amount almost to a calamity in some
sections, and says that If the com
mission investigates at once there
would be no difficulty Jn locating the
blame, if any.

PHOENIX, Ariz. Dec. 4. Tip to a
late hour tonight nothing confirmatory
of the Clifton disaster has been re-1
celved, except private dispatches sent I
from one friend to another. One of J
these said: "Half of Clifton destroy-1
ed; I am O. K." Numerous inqui
ries have been directed to the scene,
but these have been unavailing. It '
is believed here that a disaster has un
doubtedly occurred.
Clifton Is a town In Graham county
In southeastern Arizona. In 1900 the
population was 8C4. It Is located at-

IXS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 4. Now
that the great event between O'Brien
and Burns Is over and followers of the
game have had time to talk it over,
they are turning their attention to the
next event which Is another champion
ship battle.
TW l tho Attell-TValsh contest
which will take place in the Pacific
Athletic Club Pavilion on the night ot
Friday. December 7th. The worst
quibbler In the world could not say
anything to show that the winner of
this event will be absolutely the
feather-weight champion of the world.
Abe Attell won this title when he de
feated Neill decisively last Fourth of
July, with the title he also won the
T. J. McCarey championship 'lelt,
which goes with the title and -will go
Into the possession of the wljner of
this battle.
Everybody In the Southwest knows
all about .Abe Attell. He has boxed so
many times In Los Angeles, that fol
lowers of the game have grown ac
quainted with his record and his mar
velous cleverness.
Attell is one of those plucky men
who is not afraid of such as Battling
Nelson, Herrera and Kid Herman and
has usually come off with the decision.
His recent batle with Harry Baker,
the little worffier from San Franclco.
Is fresh In the mind of the public and
everybody concedes that for an ex
position of clever boxing. It was with
out an equal in the history of the
ring.
Jimmy Walsh Is not so well-known
in the West His best work has been
done in England, where he obtained
a draw" with Jem Bawker, the British
wonder, who was defeated by Nelll
He toured the United Kingdom,
meeting all comers In his class and
defeated every single one or them.
Walsh ha already met Abe Attell
this year. On Washington's birthday
he went fifteen rounds with the pres
ent champion at Chelsea, Mass., but
lost the decision. He Is quite young,
however, being only twenty years of
age, and hagr naturally Improved since
that time, so that we must all con
cede that Walsh has an excellent
chance to trie the championship belt
Into hls""possesslon.

The Standard says the most signifi
cant feature of the messice is that the
president Is constantly finding himself
"up against" the American constitu

fact that the main currents of nation

HAVANA. Dec. 4. The message of
President Roosevelt to the American
congress was published in the local
press this afternoon. No editorial
comment on it was made.
The Liberal and Moderate leaders
are chary of expressing an opinion of
the president's declaration regarding a
Cuban policy. The general view,
however, la that it does not differ ma
terially from statements made In the
letter of Senor Quesada, Cuban minis
ter, last September, and the final de
termination of the policy of the Unit
ed States rests In the hand of con
gress. The Diarlo De La Marina tomorrow
win aay;
"While President Roosevelt's decla
rations relative to Cuba are In fact a
pharaphrase of hit letter to Senor
Qaesada, the message contains the ad'
rational statement that If Cnba ac
asdras the revolutionary habit it Is Im
possible that the Island's Independence
rhould be maintained, for since the
TJeHsd Mates is standing in the posi
ties, of a guarantor of protection cj
life and property, it weald then be
compelled to lsterrese anew.
"Although this statement already
has seen expressed by Senator Bev
eridse and Secretary Root, Ha reiter
ation by President Roosevelt gives It
teal stamp of authority."
CcmmmUmK on the mosiaio the
Fest'teajorrew win say:.
That part of the messago relating
NORFOLK. Va., Dec. 4. The James
town TrI-Centennlal Exposition to be
held next year, opening the 26th of
April and closing the 30th of Novem
ber, will have a peculiar Interest for
tbosa engaged In the coal Industry,
whether as miners and shippers or as
transporters. Within easy distance ot
the Exposition grounds is Lambert's
Point, at the western terminus of
Hampton Roads, which is now utilized
by the NOrfalk and Western railroad
as the loading place for coal shipped
to all parts of the wprld. Ships of all
nations come to these wharves to be
replenished with a supply for their
own needs, as well as to carry im
mense quantities of it for consumption
in distant places.
But the Industry at tEls point will
be very small in comparison with the
gigantic bulk of trade which will, in
the near future, be carried on from
Sewall's Point, .Immediately adjoining
the Exposition Grounds. The Tide
water Railroad company has determin
ed to make of Sewall's Point the great
shipping place of all American coal
destined for foreign use. The entire
space of land? abutting on the shore
line of Hampton roads at this Juncture
win be used for coal yards and
wharves, and as this space covera
several hundreds of acres, the Im
mensity of the plant will be of wonder
ful extent In order to accomplish the
plans and purposes In contemplation,
the Tidewater Railroad win extend Its
branches so as to tap ererr field
where this indispenslble fuel is to
be found.
Men who are Interestedfln this vast
Industry, as well as railroad men In
general, win find It a profitable way
to Join business with pleasure by vls
Wmr. the Krposttron, and stndytns the
nosslbmtles of Increasing their trade.
It will be of value to them to know
thnt many of the buildings on the Ex
position grounds will remain, and will
form the nucleus of a prosoerous city,
which will owe its upward growth to
the duskv diamond.
Their Industry will have, by reason
or the Bxpos'tlon. a close alliance with
the fundamental Ide of American civ
ilization, the Idea which will be there
commemorated, and this fortuity of
circumstances can he adroitly featured
In future exploitations.
It will be a splendid outlne for their
wives and sons and as the latter will
succeed to the enterprises of their
' sires, this chance to see and study

latter with Hayne of South Carolina,
the whole basis of his reasoning was
r'orrowed from Wilson's earlier Inter

Hamilton himself was so influential in
giving the tinge of Federalism to our
Infant Institutions. But for Wilson,
Pennsylvania would have refused to
become a member of the Union by
ratifying the Constitution, and of his
oratory in the State convention Liv

Yet he passed away and was burled

memory of the people of the state on
which he had reflected such honor. A
century elapsed, and except to close
students of political and lesal history
he and his work of life were unknown.
In tne quiet Carolina town, his resting
place was shown to strangers and
some echoes of his distinction sur

The justice's office in the city hall
last evening presented the appearance
of a shambles, four Mexicans, two of
them bleeding with deep 'wounds
about the head, legs and body, having
been brought in from Ragtown where
they had a desperate fight with knives
and other weapons, and it was all
over a woman, who was one of the
four prisoners.
Dr. Greene dressed their wounds,
but this morning when they were ar
raigned In court they still presented
the apearance of the aftermath of a
Russo-Japanese combat on the banks
of the Yalu." One limped with all the
art of a grand army -veteran applying
for a pension, while the head of the
other injured man was beautifully
swathed In mummy fashion.
Tho Injured men are Juan Guerrera
and Juan Barbarez; another partici
pant' was Ygnacio Munoz, while the
lady In the case was Refugio M. de
Baladez. Munoz, It is thought, did
most of the cutting, for he was re
lieved of a dangerous dirk after the
encounter, which gave Indication of
having been used. The -woman was
just drunk, but is said to have been
the motive of the tri-cornered fight.
The affray, apparently, was of the
free-for-all, catch-as-catch-can sort.
Guerrera was given a vicious stab in
the leg which put him out of the run
ning, and Balarez received a variety
of scalp wounds that will make his
head look like a piece of patchwork
when the stitches- the doctor took
theTeon are removed and the wounds
cured.
The two Injured men each entered
a plea of guilty and were given fifteen
days in jail; the woman got eight days
and the case of Munoz, charged with
handling the knife, has not been tried.
