The Senate was in session for an
hour and thirty minutes last night,
considering the currency bill. An
agreement wss reached yesterday
morning by which the Senate will meet
at 11 o'clock today, and before the
close of the day It Is thought an agree
ment -will be entered into fixing the
dally hour of meeting and to provide
for night sessions.
The time last night was consumed In
reading the currency bllL The Senate
met at noon, and most of the session
was devoted to the consideration of the
Hetcb tletchy bill, granting a reservoir
site to the city of San Francisco, from
which to draw Its water supply. This
bill is the unfinished business for the
week, and a vote on Its final passage
will be taken Saturday. Senator Myers,
of Montana, was the principal speaker.
It is the intention of tne Democratic
leaders In the Senate to keep the cur
rency bill before the Senate whenever
that body Is not engaged In the consider
ation of the reservoir site bill.
There was a flurry In the Senate over
the Democratic proposal to hold day and
night sessions and to meet at 10 o'clock
each day. Senator Kern, leader of the
majority, submitted a resolution pro
viding for 10-o'clock as the hour of dally
meeting of the Senate.

Mrs. Logan Ends Canvas for Signa
tores of Abstainers at Execu

Marked by the wholesale distribution
of pledges calling for women of Wash
ington to abstain from buying eggs until
the price Is brought to S3 cents per
dozen, the egg boycott of the District
was declared officially on yesterday.
Different clubs of the District have taken
the matter up, and more than G0Q
pledges were signed yesterday.
In an effort to complete the boycott
and to Insure Its success Mrs. Ellis
Logan, president of the District of
Columbia Federation of Women's Clubs,
armed with pledges, spent a busy day
yesterday among the societies of Wash.
lngton. As a result of this campaign
fifty club women v. ere at v. ork last night
with the petitions.
The Idea was formally launched yes
terday at the weekly lecture of Miss
Janet Richards at Rauscher's. Miss
Richards at the conclusion of her lee
ture announced the boycott which was
enthusiastically receled by the audience.
From then on with ever-Increasing
ranks the "boycotters canvassed the
city In the Interests of lorer prices for
eggs.
Stop at White House.
I am going to do everything within
my power to get the people of Washing
ton to stop buying and eating eggs until
the present manipulation of prices ceases
and there Is a reasonable reduction,
said Mrs. Logan jesterday.
"I am Just leaving with my protest
blanks, and I am going to keep going
right on through the day and early even'
Ing, ending at the White House. I am not
going to overlook one place where I can
place a blank.
"There is no question." continued Mrs.
Logan, "but that there is a manipula
tion of the prices of eggs, and It will
continue so long as there is no protest
and the people continue- -to buy at the
prices asked.
"I think the men can be of very great
help In this campaign which is being
started to reduce the price of eggs. They
can elgn the protests and give their sup
port in this way and they can help the
women by eating other food than eggs.
The campaign. I believe, will be en
tirely successful, as It has been in other
cities, both last J ear and this year," Mrs
Logan concluded.
Boycott In Chios?"
Chicago, Dec L Although one dealer
has offered to sell eggs to Chicago wom
en at 31 cents a dozen, the price they
have been fighting for, the egg boycott
Is not broken.
"No one dealer can supply eggs to the
entire city," said Mrs. John C. Bier,
president of the Clean Food Club, "and
the fight will not be dropped until all
dealers come to the reasonable price."
District Attorney Wllkerson today at,
nounced that the trial of the Chicag
Butter and Egg Company, charged with
operating In violation of the Sherman
anti-trust law. In that they arbltra-lly
fix the price of butter and eggs, would
be rushed to trial In the Federal Court
this week.

ducted by the Housewives' League, in an
effort to bring down the price of eggs
from the present high cost was begun

poohed the boycott claiming that while
it eventually might lower the prices a
cent or two. the situation will remain
unchanged.

absence at home, come together on their
field of oratorical battles.
For the first time in many long weeks

names, ZA Representatives announcing
their presence. The usual committees
were appointed and the House adjourned

The kidneys get clogged up, the same
as the bowels do. Then they become

a part of the waste or poisonous mat
ter, all the rest remaining In the blood
and poisoning the system.
As soon aa you notice the first Indi

sage, take a little Croxone three times
a day and end these troubles before
they become more serious.
There Is no more effective remedy
known for the prompt relief and cure
of kidney, bladder troubles, and rheu
matism, than Croxone. It soaks right
Into tho kidneys through the walls and
linings; cleans out the clogged up
pores, neutralizes and dissolves the
poisonous uric acid and waste matter
that lodge in the Joints and muscles,
and cause those terrible rheumatic
pains, and make the kidneys, filter the
poison from the blood snd drive it out
of the system.
A few days' use of this new scientific
preparation is often all that is ever
needed to end the worst backache, or
overcome -the most annoying urinary
disorders.
You will find Croxone entirely differ

to take It without results. An original
