judge nmjjps- decision.
Because it was made public at the
same time as President Roosevelt's
message, the decision of Judge Phillips,
in the federal court at Kansas City, in
the railroad contempt cases was some
what obscured hi the public mind, but it
was of considerable importance never
theless. Judge Phillips' attitude, both in that
decision and in his more recent charge
to a federal grand jury now in session
in Kansas City, which was published
in tho State Journal last evening, must
appeal forcibly to every fair-minded
person. Just because a railroad com
pany is a corporation is no reason why
it is not entitled to justice the same as
a private individual.
The principal contempt case was di
rected aginst the Santa Fe. That road
is alleged to have given rebates to the
Hutchinson Salt company and to the
Colorado Fuel and Iron company after
being enjoined from doing so by the
federal court. Judge Phillips discussed
the case on the technicality that it
should have been brought in the dis
tricts of Kansas and Colorado respective
ly where the alleged offenses were com
mitted. But incidentally Judge Phillips
expressed his opinion of the proceeding
in general.
It now seems to be the general im
pression that the Colorado Fuel and Iron
rebate, at least, was a plain holdup. The
Santa Fe was in need of business and
the Colorado company demanded a re
bate in return for its business. As a
result it got it. The Santa Fe, of course,
was not guiltless in the matter, but it
was far less to blame than was the ship
perthe Colorado company which had
become an exceedingly strong corpora
tion. Now it is Judge Phillips' idea that in
punishing infractions of the anti-rebate
law, officials should not confine their
attention to the railroads that suffer
from being compelled to give the rebates,
but that, where such things occur, the
wicked shipper who throws down the
railroad and takes the rebate away from
it should also be punished.
There are doubtless cases where rail
road companies deliberately buy busi
ness by offering shippers rebates, but
there are also many instances in which
the rebates are given very unwillingly.
Big corporations like the beef trust and
the harvester combine, whose business
aggregates millions of dollars, are able
to virtually hold up railroad companies
for special rates. In such cases the
guilty shipper is certainly deserving of
more severe punishment than the rail
road company that is held up.
Judge Phillips emphasizes the fact
that there can be no rebate unless there
is a shipper who takes the rebate, and
the shipper is the one who profits by it.
By all means let the shipper be punish
ed as well as the railroads. The people
cannot afford to be unjust towards the
transportation companies. The Square
Deal movement includes the railroads as
well as the private citizen.
Incidentally Judge Phillips' remarks
emphasize the need for the rate regula
tion law which President Roosevelt de
sires. Tf rates could be regulated by a
government commission railroads would
not be subjected to hold-ups of this
character. At present there is reason to
believe that many published rates are
made high in order to grant the con
cessions demande'd by big corporations,
and the little shipper has to pay the
excessive rate. That sort of thing would
be eliminated if equitable rales were
made for all.
FOR THE MEXICAN COXSITATE.
The complaint is frequently made
that Kansas is not represented in the
government's consular and foreign ser
vice as much as it should be which is
undoubtedly true. Kansas has a few
minor consulates but none of import
ance since W. R. Brlgham was relieved
at Cape Town.
Here is a suggeftion: The office of
United States consul at the City of
Mexico has recently been made vacant
by the accidental death of the consul.
A Kansan, Charles C. Eberhardt of Sa
lina. has been vice consul there. Why
should not Kansas ask to have Mr.
Kberhardt placed in charge of the Mex
ican consulate?
Mi'. Eberhardt is the second of the
five famous Eberhardt brothers of Sa
lina, who were for a number of years
the state's foremost athletes. He is one
of those clean, whole-hearted, thor
oughly honest and honorable young
men whom everyone admires. He has
ability, is acquainted with the work,
and would be a great credit to bis
state. Why shouid not Mr. Eberhardt
succeed to the Mexican consulate?
THE HELPFUL HEX.
The estimates of the department of
agriculture of the products of this
country of ours, place the income of
American farms from the industry of
the American hen at something over
five hundred million dollars. Perhaps
the hen ought not be given entire credit
for this vast sum, as her sons and her
daughters help by being converted into
"spring fries," and even her tough old
husband occasionally swells the amount
by being served In the restaurants as
"young chicken."
But on the whole it is the work of
the hen that does the business. She it
is that lays the eggs and raises the
chickens, and to her belongs the credit
for most of that five hundred and odd
million!:.
This is a sum greater even than Sec
retary Wilson credits to all the wheat
fields of the country. This is pretty
hard for a central Kansas wheat farm
er to believe, but it may be true, for
the hen does not confine her labors to
any one section. She is as rrollfie in
the south as in the north; she works
just as hard on the rocky hillsides of
New Hampshire as in the sunny valleys
of California.
It was not always thus. Time was,
not so very long ago, when the hen
worked just as hard as she does today,
but the farmer's wife did not realize
more than half as much, from her toil
as she does cow. The reason? The
cold storage plant. A few years ago
during the warmer months when the
hen worked hardest her product was a
drug on the market at seven cents per
dozen, and it was never safe to invest
in many even at that price. Now the
farmer's wife gets from double to four
times that amount the year around.
In this year "of grace when the hen
gees forth and lays eggs while the sun
shines, in the summertime, her product
will nearly always bring 15 cents per
dozen. The reason for the increase in
price is that as fast as she lays them
her eggs are hurried to the cold stor
age plant, and when she takes her va
cation along in January they are dealt
out to us city dwellers as "fresh farm
eggs." And at this writing every time
the hen tells the world of her achieve
ments in a loud and boisterous cackle,
it is worth two cents per cackle to the
farmer's wife.
The hen is all right! Locg live the
hen!

KANSAS COMMENT
- THE RIGHT GIRL.
An old story again revived is to the
effect that a young man should call on
a girl early in the morning to ask her
to marry him, rather than throwing
himself at her feet at a party. If he
comes to the door in a neat shirtwaist
with a rose in her hair, he should grab
her and run. The advice is wrong.
When a girl has time in the morning
to deck out in a shirt waist suit and
deck her head out with flowers, you fcet
mother has been getting breakfast
ready. The gitl who flies into a dress
ing sack, twists her hair in a biscuit,
and jumps into a pair of slippers is the
girl to grab. She has been getting

An Irving "Prescription."
The late Sir Henry Irving did most
things well to which he set his hand,
but the notable exception was his writ
ing. It was execrable. Not one friend
among ten could read the whole of a
note from the great actor-manager
and there is at least one American
household which remembers this trait
of the good man past and gone; remem
bers it in both amusement and morti
fication. Among Sir Henry's many friends in
this country are a certain Philadelphia
couple, who, on the morning of the day
when the Englishman was "to open"
in their city, left at his hotel a line of
warm welcome, with the added word
that they should see him across the
footlights that evening, providing a
bad cold, from which one of two was
suffering, would only permit their be
ing out. An hour later came an en
velope addressed to them in the Irving
scrawl but that which was scratched
across the single sheet enclosed was
absolutely illegible. By and by it oc
curred to the man of the house 'he
with the cold) that it might be a pre
scription sent him out of the kindness
of Irving's big heart. He took it to a
chemist and next morning the recipi

the actor to present his thanks. And
the first question he had to meet was:

Miles and I. O. X". Money.
Gen. Nelson A. Miles used to delight
in meeting cranks, because he always
knew how to get rid of them. While
stationed in Chicago the general one
day received a visit from the author
of a book on finance. It was during the
free silver excitement, when every work
on the subject of money was largely
sought. This particular work condemn
ed both silver and gold coinage and con
tended that the only real money was
paper "I. O. U." issued by the individ
ual. "When a man makes a purchase all he
needs do under this system is give his
paper I. O. U. for it, and that settles
the transaction," said the author, with
much fervor, in explaining the merits of
his book to the soldier.
Gen. Miles said the plan looked like
a quick method of exchange, and that
remark sent the author away 1 well
pleased: : - '" i
Some days later the general received
a package containing a dozen of the
books. Then in a week came the in
evitable bill for $12. On receipt thereof
the general wrote like this:
"Inclosed please find my I. O. U. for
the books. Hoping the same will be
satisfactory, I am, yours very truly."

The Law's Mistake.
(By Donald Allen.) ;
Whenever a man is sent to state pris- :
on his record reaches the institution ;
ahead of him. The deputy warden gets
it from the police who worked up the
case and arrested him, and from the
published accounts of his trial. It is
known before he arrives about what
sort of a man he is. and he is some- :
times assigned to this or that depart
ment in advance. If he is recorded as
a bad man, the deputy gets ready to
lay down the rules and regulations to
him; if otherwise, the official heaves a
sigh of relief. Nowhere is a bad man
out of place more than in a penal in- :
stitution, where his' example may in- i
feet 50 others, and nowhere is a "good"
man given a warmer welcome. i
In broad daylight, in a western city, i
a stranger had entered a big dry goods ;
store and held up the cashier, obtained
something like $10,000 and got into the
street. He would have made good his
escane but for an accident. As it was,
he got half a mile away "before being
captured. The money was not found ou
him, but there were half a dozen per
sons to swear to his identity.
The prisoner, who gave his name as
James Drayton, declared that a mis
take had been made. At his trial he
actually proved that he was a resident
of a village 50 miles away, and half
a dozen of his fellow townsmen were
on hand to swear that he was an in
dustrious, honest man.
There are times when waves of crime
seem to sweep over a mommunity.
And there are also times when waves of
justice follow, and in their zealousness
the courts seem determined to convict
at any cost. The two waves happened
to be sweeping over the western city
at the time, and the law made an ex
ample of Drayton. He was sentenced
to state prison for five years, and the
judge read him a severe moral lecture
from the bench in addition. The pris
oner protested to the last, and his whole
community felt that the law had made
a grievous mistake, but there was a
spurt of reform on, and the prosecu
tion would have it that justice had her
hands on the right man.
The deputy at K- prison had
read a full account of the trial, but he
did not let a doubt creep into his
mind. Whoever came to his prison
had been adjudged guilty by the courts
and nut. Into his keening, and it was
not for him to doubt or criticise. He
looked for a man who would whine and
beg for sympathy and carry himself
as a martyr, but he was agreably sur
prised to discover iuit the conuai.
Drayton was in the prime of life,
clear-eyed and frank-faced, and he
had nothing to say against his sen
tence. He seemed to realize that the
time had gone by for that. In the
department to which he was assigned
he made such a record that after a
year he was appointed a "trusty." He
had served almost two years of his
time before the deputy heard his story.
It had the ring of truth and the offi
cer believed it, but at the time he was
going to leave the prison and take an
other position, and he felt helpless in
the matter. In the course of a week
he went to a distant state, took up a
new occupation, and three months
passed away.
Tien one day the former deputy
made a day's journey by rail, and as
he sat dow n to dinner in the dining car
his amazement was unbounded to ob
serve Drayton at a near-by table. The
convict looked up at him without
recognition, and did not seem at all
abashed. Here was a man who had
seen Drayton every day for two years,
talked-with" him, noticed every' "pecu
liarity about him, and could swear to
him a thousand times over.
There was no more doubt in his
mind that the convict sat before him
than that he was living, and he was
presently absorbed in speculation. It
was just possible that the man had
been pardoned. If so, whv did he not
recognize and greet his old friend? The
deputy had been as friendly with him
as the regulations permitted even
more than that.
If he had not been pardoned then he
must have escaped, but that he could
sit there with such brazen assurance
was not like Drayton. The deputy found
his position embarrassing in a way, and
yet it did not take him long to make up
his mind what to do. He would have
been glad to see Drayton get a pardon,
but if he had escaped he must go back
and serve the rest of his time.
During the meal the eyes of the two
men met a dozen times, and of the two
Drayton was the less confused. His
hair wa3 yet short from the prison regu
lations end he had on civilian's dress:
of good texture. His demeanor was that
of any traveler, careless and indifferent
to a certain degree, and it was certain
that if addressed he would promptly
deny his identity an I carry the matter
through with a high hand. This dissem
bling and assurance on his part was a
new phase of his character, and dinner
had been finished half an hour before
the deputy approached him and said:
"I have a. good memory for faces, and
I am sure I have seen yours before."
"It may be so," was the careless re
ply, accompanied by a smile.
"Haven't I met you in the village of
Wadsworth?"" naming the place where
the K state prison was situated.
"I may have passed through the place
on a train, but I am sure I never stop
ped there. It is possible that we have
met before while traveling."
The voice the movement of the mouth
while speaking the look of the eyes
everything about the man was perfectly
familiar to the officer, but he suddenly
decided to adopt a new line of policy
for awhile. He would meet finesse with
finesse. The pair entered into general
conversation for two hours, and then
the deputy sent out a telegram asking
the warden of the state prison if Dray
ton had been pardoned or had escaped.
Two hours later, as he was nearing the
end of the journey, he received an an
swer reading:
"Drayton is still with us and has just
been locked in his cell."
Here was another puzzle, but it did
not take the astute ofTicial long to reach
a conclusion. Drayton had claimed that
the felony had been committed by some
man resembling him. Here was his pro
totype his twin brother. While he
looked more like a respectable business
man than a thief, the ex-deputy deter
mined not to let him go without a rigid
examination.
It happened that the two got off at
the same city, and they had scarcely
descended from the train before the
stranger was given in charge by the
official and taken to a police station.
It was a high handed thing to do, and
if he was what he represented or
seemed to be, he could make trouble
for the other.
He seemed stunned at first over his
arrest, and then grew indignant and
threatening. He gave a certain name
and claimed a certain city as his resi
dence, and for a time the police were
inclined to apologize and let him go.
It was only when the ex-deputy began
to question him about a certain date
the date of the robbery that he
tripped in his answers and aroused
new suspicion.
Few men have done for another
what the deputy did for Drayton. He
remained with the stranger until he
got good grounds for his arrest on the
old charge. He brought the cashier
and others on at his own expense, and
got the authorities to extradite the
man end the courts to put him on trial
and summon Drayton from state
prison. , ., '
When the two men finally stood to
gether there was wonder and amaze
ment in the court. Their own moth
ers could not have told them apart. A
little detective work had unearthed .
bad record for the stranger, and al
though he started out to make a. great
leeal fight, he ended by confessnnu
that he was the guilty party, and that
Drayton bad served two yeans for a
crime he had not committed. Th lat- ,
ter was pardoned out and restored to
citizenship and respectability, while
the guilty party was sent to occupy
his place in prison, and the judge who
had read a moral lesson rrom the
bench had somethiru? more to say.
His conscience had been troubling him
for the way he charged the Jury
against an innocent man, and he
sourht to console it by admitting that
somewhere in the world every man
may find his prototype, but that the
law could not take cognizance of the
fact. (Copyright, 1905, by Beatrix
