Many Spectators at Capitol to Wit
ness the Opening.
On Tuesday President's Message Was
Read in Bath House and
s Senate
Washington. The meeting of the
Sixtieth congress Tuesday resem
bled a social function rather than the
gathering for the transaction of Im
portant business of the country. The
galleries were crowded with beauti
fully gowned women who had come
early In the expectation of witnessing
some exciting scones. The diplomatic
-gallery was made conspicuous by the
presence of Senor Mayor Des

al dress, who attracted more than or
dinary attention; Mrs. Nicholas Long
worth, daughter of the president and
wife of the member from tho Clncln
latl district, and the new Persian min
ister In his variegated uniform.
The striking scenes of the day were

body and the designation by the dem
ocrats of Mr. John Sharp Williams as
their leader, were occasions for ova
tions for those gentlemen.

but as the rending progressed, the at
tendance diminished somewhat. In
the muln, however, It was well main
tained until the Inst sentences of the
document had fallen from tho lips of
the official readers. Senators and

copies of the message, and muny of
them followed the reading clerkB with
scrupulous care. The reading con
sumed about two and a quarter hours
iu each of the houses.

of corporations acting under a nation

tertained Five Escaped Alive

curate summary obtainable Friday

tended by greater loss of life than
any former disaster in the history of
the bituminous coal mining industry

Comment and Suggeitlve Thought.
Samuel's Inheritance Samuel was
tho son of Elkanah and Hannah of the
tribe of Levi, tho religious and oduca
tlonal custodians of Israel. His par
outs wore religious peoplo, attending
tho great religions festivals. Ho was
tho child of many prayors. Hannah't
song In 1 Samuel 2 gives us a good
Impression of her talent and spiritual
power. Hb belonged to .a rollglous
homo, which, like the quality of
mercy "Is twice blessed; It blessoth
him that glveB, and him that takes,"
Ills Consecration. Ho was dedi
cated to Ood Trom his birth, and ho
know It. Ho lived undor tho Nazi
rite's vow (Num. 6:1-12; 1 Sam. 1:
11). Tho power of devoting our chil
dren in their earliest years to tho
service of God Is well Illustrated by
tho story told by Merlvale, In his
"History of Rome," of tho famous
Carthaginian genoral, Hannibal. When"
ho was nine years of age, his father
Ham Hear, proposed to take him on
one of his military expeditions, which
offer the young Hannibal eagerly ac
cepted. His father then bade hlni
devote himself once for nil to the
Bervlce of his country Carthago and
with his hand upon the altar to Bwoai
eternal enmity to Rome. This dedica
tion In youth determined the counts
of his whole life.
His Temple Work. "Samuel min
istered unto tho Lord beforo Ell." "To
minister" means to serve; a minister
is a servant. Samuel porformod va
rious services In tho house of wor
ship, such ns lighting the lamps (v. 3),
opening tho doors (v. 15), running of
errands, nnd othor duties required for,
the sacrifices and worship. He was
also the personnl attendant and aid
to tho aged and dim-Righted Ell, as is
implied In his sleeping near him and
his readiness to respond to his call.
So tho young Mark and Timothy min
istered unto Paul.
The Call of God Awakening His
Higher Nature. According to Joso
pluiM, Samuel was 12 years old, tho
same age as .lesus when he first wont
to the temple ut .Torusalcm.
V. 10. "And tho Lord enmo and
stood." The Hebrew is emphatic,
"presented himself." in a vision, or In
personal presence as tho angel of tho
Lord (compare Gen. 18:17, 20, 21, 33;
.ludg. 6:11-14; Rev. 1:1; 22:16).
God Calling the Young. God Is
calling every child as ho called Sam
uel. It is an Individual call, by name,
for "ho calleth his own sheep by
name." God calls (1) by his word;
(2) by his own loving, attractive char
acter; (3) by what ho has done for
us In Jesus Christ; (4) by the Influ
ences of -the holy spirit; (5) by vari
ous providences; (6) by conscience;
(7) by Sabbuth and religious services;
(8) by tho Invitations and lniluenco of
friends; (0) by tho living wator which
satisfies every thirst of tho soul; (10)
by the attractions of goodness and of
heaven; (11) by wurnlng and the fruit
of a life of sin.
Early Piety. Like Samuel, wo
should answer God's call by "Here am
1." (1) It Is easier to be a Christian
In youth. (2) Then It gives us a much
longer time In which to servo God.
(3) Wo may not live to he old, and
thus by putting off our duty wo may
fall altogether. (4) We escape many
ovlls and dangers. No one can sow
wild oats In youth and not reap a
harvest of evil. There; are some spir
itual blessings which can come only to
those who have grown up In tho Chris
tian life. It Is universally recognized
by students of tho child that most
men decide their future characters
very early in life.
Samuel's Hard Duty. A very
heavy burden was laid upon Samuel,
the llrst of many yet to come. It was
both a test and a training for his life
work.
V. Hi. "Samuel feared to shew Ell
tho vlBlon." It wus a very hard thing
for Samuel to make known to tho aged
Ell the message God had delivered
to him. He was so young to seem to
roprovo one so old. He would have to
give great pain to one who loved him
jind had done much for him.' Hut. Ell
pressed and even adjured Samuel to
toll him all, and Samuel "told him
every whit."
