Win 11 John . Selden was asked on
what principle and maxim of (he I -11
glish Constitution he rested the rigid
to it .iint tyranny, ''on the immemorial
custom of Kiiglisliineu," was the reply
I'ntil within ten vears past the people
of the I'nitet! Stales' might have echoed
the same noble principle of their Kn
glish ancestors, and had the habeas
corpus in the United Stales cost our
countrymen as much of blood and
tre.'isuii' a it cost the Knglish people,
it would not be treated as lightly as it
is by General Grant and his adviners.
What we see itl the South, under Fed

cruel, ami lamentable. Federal mili

We stated, last week in tlio Home
Journal, that an Ohio man had offered
the 1', S. Government fifty thousand
dollars for tin' privilege of advertising
on the hacks of the postage stamps for
one yens. The Mobile lteUter infers
that the Ohio man did not succeed,
and adds: "While we can but admit
that he displayed good bensu iu Ion
appii tuition of the value of advci lining,
we imit hold that he showed a very
p or iHisiness caijiicuv 111 mo way lie
went about the matter. He bhould
have hi). 'led the Government twenty
five thousand dollars, and then used
the other tweMy five thousand iu pur
chasing a recommendation of the

would have carried it through as slick

Governor Hiown has appointed Rob
ert MeFnrland, of Morristown, Fast
Tennessee, to succeed to the sent on
the Supreme lleneh made vacant by
the resignation of Hon. T, A. R. Nel-

T. Shields, Mr. MeFarland has ac
cepted the position, and has telegraph
ed that he will be in Nashville Monday
to enter upon his duties.
We quote from a Pennsylvania pa
per: ''Chicago was probably the most
populous city in the world, previous
to the conflagration .' Some fourteen
millions of her 'destitutu citizens' have
passed through this city in the past
three weeks. You can't throw a cat
in any direction without hitting a 'suf
ferer.' The dodge in becoming tlnead
baie.'' The loyul claimants from the South,
whoso claims have been passed upon
by the Southern Clnims Commission,
are not likely to get the money. It is
thought Congress will not make an
apprepriation of 88,000,000 or $10,
000,000 to meet the claims which have
already been proven and audited.
The iircscnt outlook indicates a
great reduction in the cotton acreage

Absorption of Mexico.
The New York Herald advises Grunt
to absoib Mexico in the interests of
general civilization. It reasons thus:
The time has come when a full pro
tectorate is needed, and when it is more
necessary to march an army across the
K10 (irande than a few years ago. We
are responsible to the civilized world
for Mexico. When we protested
ngaist the French invasion, and insisted
upon the removal ol the Imperial Gov
eminent the French established, tic
nations of Europe asked us why we
did not, for the sake of civilization, 1111-
deitake lo cure the disorders of Mexi
co. The civilized world holds us re
sponsible and would rejoice to see the
strong arm ol the United States gov
crning Mexico.
And so because the United States
Government would uot permit Napo
leon and Maximilian to ''civilize" .Mexi
co by conquering it, and Mexico yet
needs to he civilized, the duty of civi
lizing it devolves on the United States.
The cnglu pounces on the fish hawk,
makes it drop it prey, and gobbles it
up itself. This is good robber reason
inir.
Mexico cannot he damaged by ab
sorption from any quarter, for her last
estate must be an improvement on her
first and present. But we reckon this
is not quite the proper time fur a war
of conquest in Mexico. Our Imperial
Ulysses) has got his hands full for a
year lo come in consolidating his pres
ent empire. There is time enough for
him to heave the sigh ofAlexander the
Great for more worlds to conquer. A
conquest would he a bully thing for
poor Mexico, but a sorry thing for the
people and Government of the United
Slates at this moment. Mobile Reg
ister. A great writer said; "No good man
ever became rich of a sudden." This
is hard on President Grant, who, from
poverty a few years since has become
a millionaire.

satin Chair of Slate in the White House
at Washington, thut whitened sepul
elm of political ami personal disgrace,
ureeley is a dissatisfied Republican,
but is he dissatisfied with the moil
strous outrage on uod and man 111
making that natural savage, the negro,
a legislator, and a contriver of schemes
and maker of laws for the difficult
problem ofa Republic ?
is he dissatisfied wilh his purty inns
much as men are hunted like wild
beasts from their homes in South Caro
liiia, and with the habeus corpus sus
pended in half n dozen couuties of a
State of the Confederacy?
Is he dissatisfied because his party
cndoises the doctrine that Congress is
supreme over a sovereign State? Is lie
dissatisfied because Grant assumes the
one man power over millions, and
holds the lives and fortunes of his fel
low freemen iu the hollow of his cruel
hand ? Is he dissatisfied because wide
spread plunder of his party, and foul
abuse of executivo patronage make
tins era in America a shame before the
nations ?
Is he dissatisfied because to serve a
purpose Gei.eral Grant, by advice of
his party, stocks the Supreme Court of
the United States with partizan judges
preplodg.id t give .judgment on behall
of the administration, upon a matter
involving the plighted word of the
Government to ito creditors? Uy no
means. All these outrages Mr Greeley
endorses and supports, and he is offer
ed as a sample of the crowd of dissatis
fied Republican leaders. He lights
within the home lines of the Republi
can party, with Fenton against Grant,
and Coukling and Murphey, and gladly
would he accept the aid ot the Demo
eratic party t.) help him to his poor
revenue ami his uncouth ambition.
Why Not?
Why cannot the disabilities of the
Southerners be removed and n kindly
hand extended to them V Surely it is
time to bury the sad memories of the
war and restore the South. Surely
lucre should be some abatement of
severity to the people of our own race
and blood, Fvery ri'ht thinking
Northerner must regret to see the in
telligent people of his own race in the
South placed under the iron heel ol
ignorant ant! semi barbarous negroes.
We do not think General Grant and
the Kadioal party can make anything
politically by their policy of repression
and by attempting to make the negro
rule the white man. If a broad and
liberal policy be Inaugurated we shall
hear no more of Ku Klux. federal
baonets may be withdrawn, the civil
law will be found sufficient enoiii'li
and the South will rise from the dis
asters of the war to a degree of pros
perity it never attained before. New

merge into each other, and blend in
an undistinguishably connected line,
without any perceptible points of dem
arcation, as Darwin's monkeys and
men are said to do V Or nre they dis
tinct and unrelated powers? What is
instinct, if it is not reason V and what
is intuition? There is an instinct that
impels the new born babe to seek
nourishment at its mother's breast, and
semis the I'ar-wandering bee in a math
cmaticul line directly home to its dis
tant hive leading it to strike the ex
act spot where the little aperture is
from which it had emerged, and if this
be changed by removing it even an
inch from its accustomed place, the
bee will strike the spot where it was,
and for a moment be confused till hc
finds it in its new place. Is this the
instinct that leads the carrier pigeon
home? Whatever it is, the mysterious
po er is something really wonderful;
and not the least so to him who is
most accustomed to think, and look
into the cause of tliin-'s.
Advice to Funnels
It is always best to change seed po
tatoes seed will not do so well in the
same soil where it grew. TlJejfelTect
is more marked in Irish tliansweet
potatoes, though the rule hold's ood
with both.
Every year many of our farmers,
through pure negligence, let enough
properly and machinery go to waste to
pay all their taxes and buy a new cow.
Many of our farmers have from four
to ten inches of uncultivated soil lying
below their deepest line of culture
They ought to semi their plowshares
down after it, for it is the cheapest
fertilizer known, tossy nothing of the
many other advantages which grow
out of deep plowing.
Covington, Ga., has a colored de
bating society. The question lust dis
cussed by this august assembly was,
which is the more useful, paper or
gunpowder." The president was for a
long time in great doubt as to which
side had produced the strongest argu
ment, when one of tho powder side
aroso and very gravely said: "Mr.
President : 'Spose dor was a bar out
dar at do door, and you was to go dar
and shake do paper at him, you'd see!
what de bar would do. Butjes shoot
a cannon at him and mark de result
I calls for de question." The presi
dent forthwith decided in favor of
powder.
It is said that ten million doseo cor
