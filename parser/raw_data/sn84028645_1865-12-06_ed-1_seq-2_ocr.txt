The President's Message.
President Johmsom, haa . spoken to the
American people through an annual message-
t to Congress. ,. In- this , mornln'a
Statesman that message, will be found, and
to It we direct the attention of the reader.
Under existing circumstances, it Is as ac-(
ptableawe bad auy ngui, tu eAw .v.,
The President makes the argument ,that It
is possible for a Stare to obtain from the
Jonii,Uut(on 0f the United States any sanc
tion to-withdraw from the Uuion, , He ar
mies that the perpetuity f the Constitution,
and or the States are inseparably connect
ed.that the destruction of. one Is the destruc
tlonof the other; that, tlie, States,. by at
tempting to secede, simply put themselvea
fo'a condition where their vitality was lm
paired,, but ot'iogulslieil-thelr func-'
tini'i suspended,,; but , ; not.. destroy,
CdVi His1" argument 1b- ' forcible; and
to most minds must .. be conclustre
that State succeeded in withdrawing
from the Union. It then follows, In
evitably,' ' that the' respective Southern
States that were lately la Insurrection, pbs-.
sess. the. same rights, and privileges that
tlwy enjoyed before thoir people ' under
took, to forcibly takethem out of tbe Union.
Thosei rljrhts and privileges were never ira-j
paired, 'wcept in so far as -they were lm-
paired by the Military power or tne so
called Southern Confederacy. As soon 'as
that pressure was removed, the functions
of the States assumed their wonted tone, uu-
less, they were again put In abeyance by
some'Other power; 11 '-:lii '-"
,TUPresldeutsays tha.t.hj discarded the1
idea of Military rule for the late iusurgent
Stata,.lnasrauch as such julej'would have
endangered the purity oi the general ad
ministration and the liberties, of the Spates
whlcU'remalued IoyaI,nanQ became It vVould
be putting Into the bands ot one man more
power than he "should be willing to trust
to any one man." For Ms reason he al
leges tbat he has, ."gradually and quietly.
and by almost imperceptible .ftepSvapuht
to restore tne rigntiui energy oi tuo uen
erai, Qavernment, and p( ,the..Stjites.; .Ue
' admits that the policy he adopted "was at
tended with some risk " for to success re
quires, at least, the acquiescence of the State
which it concerns ; that it implies an invita
tion to those States, by -renewing their alU
glance to the United States, to return their
functions. as States in the Union;" and
for the purpose of securing the " acqui
escence" of those States to "renew their al
legiance to the United States, and to resume
their places in the Union," he felt It Incum
bent on him to offer to them an induce
ment to do so, and that inducement lie of
fered through the pardoning power. . This
position would seoru to imply that if that
should not be to them a satisfactory induce
ment it would be optional with them wheth
er they would renew their allegiance to the
United States and resome their places In
the Union or not In addition to this he has
" invited" those States to adopt the congres
sional amendment abolishing slavery. He
does not claim that he had any right to exact
this at their hands; bat he "invited" tberri
to adopt it through a belief that its adop
tion would remove . the bone of contention
at which the North and South have been
knawing lor years; and over which they
fought most desperately for four years, and
would thereby secure to the country; fra
ternal feeling and a lasting peace. He con
tends that "the amendment to the Consti
tution being adopted, it would remain for the
States, whose powers have been so long
in abeyance, to resume their places in the two
branches' of the National Legislature, and
thereby tomplele the work of restoration?. All
that Congress has to do in the matter, is to
judge "of the elections, returns' and
qualifications" of . Its ', own members.
f t is no business of theirs to make any
Other demands of those States, after they
shall have adopted the Congressional
amendment abolishing slavery they have
ho right to demand that, even, any more
than they had a right to demand its adop
tion by the Legislature of Onlo.
The President's argument against Negro
Suffrage is about as conclusive as his argu
ment agauist Secession, or against , the the
ory tbat any of tliu Southern States are out
of the Uuioa. He thinks a great point has
been gained in securing the i'reedool .of the
Slave, aud that all that Is now necessary
to do in their behalf is to see that, they are
secured iu their freedom, and in their rights
of person and property. " '
The Statesman Gave the President's
Message to the Columbus
Public Nearly and Hour Before
the Journal Gave it to Them!
?he President's Message was pat into
our hands by Mr. Gates, at the Telegraph

half past one o'clock, according to Instruc

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow-Citizens of the Senatt and House o
' - Jlepresentatives: ; ,v ' 4 . ';,
1 1. To express grttMtude to God, in the name
of the People, for , the preservation of the
United States, Is my first duty in, address
ing you. Our thoughts next revert to the
death of the late President by an act of parri
cidal treason. The grief of the nation Is
still fresh; it finds some solace In the con
sideration that he lived to enjoy the highest
proof of its confidence by entering on the
renewed terra of the Chief Magistracy, to
which he had been elected; that he brought
the civil war substantially to. a close; that
his loss was deplored in all parts of the
Union; aud that foreign nations have ren
dered justice to his memory. His remov
al cast upon me a heavier weight of eares
tuau aver devolved upon any one ot his
'predecessors. To fulfill my trust I need
ithe support and conlidence of all who are
associated with me in the various depart
ments Of Government, and the support ana
confidence of the people. " There is but one
way in which 1 tan hope to gain their nec
essary aid; It Is. to state with fraukness the
principles which guide my conduct, and
their application tu the present state of af
fairs, well aware that the efficiency of uiy
labors will, la a great measure, depend ou
yur and ttiblr undivided approbation. The
Union ot the United States of America was.
intended by its authors to last as long as the
State thnmaelves ehall last. "The Union
eHALt bb ; perpktcal" are the words of
the .Confederation.! "To form a more
pkbfkct UsioiO by an ordinance ot the
people of the United States, is the declared,
purpose of the Constitution. The hand of
Divine Providence; was never more plainly.
visible in the a 11 airs of men than in .the,
framing and adopting of . that instrument.
It is, beyond.com parisou, tlie greatest event
irte American history;, and indeed -is- it
not. of all events In . modern times, the
moat Dreirnant with oonseauences for every
neunle of tint earth? The mtaubers of tbo
Convention which prepared it brought to
thelr work the experience of the ConloUera
tion. of their several States, and of other
Republican Governments, old and pewj-
but thev needed and they obtained a wu
domsuoerior to exoerience. And when
for its validity it required the approval of
a people thaWoccuuicu a large pare oi a
contluentand acted separately in many
diatinctconventions, what is more wonder
ful than that, after earnest contention and
long discussion, all feelings aud all opinions
were ultimately drawn iu one way to iu
BUDDOrt? . , i '(
' The Constitution to which life was thus
iimparted contains within itselt. ample re
sources for its own preservation. It has
power to enforce the laws, puuish treason,,
and Insure domestic tranquility. , In case
of the usurpation pf the Government of a
State by one man, or au oligarchy, it be
comes a duty of the United States td make
good tlie guarantee to tnat atate oi a re
i publican lorm of government, : and so Jo
iiMiinfjiln tlia. homoireneousiiesa of all.
, Does the lapse of time reveal defects?,, A
'simple mode of amendment is provided in
' Uie Constitution itself, so. that ltd conditions
can alwav , be made , to conform, to the
: requirements . of advancing civilization.
'No room iia allowed even for the
thought of a possibility of its coining to
an eud. And these power of self-prcservai
tion have always beeu asserted in their
complete integrity by every patriotic Chief
Magistrate by Jefferson aud Jackson, not
less than bv Washington anu juauison. ine
nartimr advice of the Father of his Coun
try, while yet President, to the people of
the United States, was, that "the free Con
stitution, which was tne work ot tneir
hands, might be sacredly maintained;" and
the inaugural words of President Jefferson
held up "the preservation of the General
Government, in ita constitutional vigor, as
the sheet anchor of our peace at home and
safety abroad." The Constitution is the
work of "the People of the United States."
and it should be as indestructible as the
people.., , ' .
It is not strange that the framers of the
Constitution, which had no model In the
past, should not have fully comprehended
the excellence of their own work. , "Fresh
from a struggle' against arbitrary power,
many patriots sullered iroui narassing rears
of au absorption of the State Governments
by the Jeueral Government, and many
from a dread that the States would break
away, from their orblte. But the very
greatness of,our country should allay the
apprehension of encroachments by the Gen
eral, Government. The subjects that come
unquestionably within its jurisdiction are
bo numerous that it must ever naturally
refuse. to be embarrassed by questions that
lie beyond It. Were it otherwise, the Ex
ecutive would sink beneath , the burden;
the ehannel3 pt justice would be choked;
legislation would be obstructed by excess ;
so that there Is a greater temptation to ex?
erclse some of the functions ot the Gener
al Government through the States than to
trespass on their rightful sphere. "The
absolute acquiescence in the decisions of
the majority" was, at the beginning of the
century, enlorced by Jefferson "as the vi
tal principle of republics" aud the events
of the last four years have' established, we
will hope forever, that there lies no appeal
to force. '' ' " -."
Tne maintenance of the Union brings
with it "the support of the State Govern
ments in all their rights;" but it is not one
of the rights of any "State Government te j
renounce its' own place in -the Union; or to
nullify the laws of the Union. The larg-:
est liberty is to be maintained in the dis
mission of the acts of the Federal Govern
ment; ut there Is no appeal from Its laws,
except to the various branches of that Gov-1
ernment Itself, or to the people, who grant)
to the members of the Legislative' and of'
the Executive Departments no tenure but
a limited one, and In that manner always
retain the powers of redress.
'-""The sovereignty of the States''-is the'
-language of the Confederacy, and- not the:
language of the Constitution. - The latter
eontalus the emphatic words: "TheOnsti
tutlonand the laws of the United States
-whlob shall be made in pursuance thereof,
and all' treaties mado or which shall be
-made under1 the authority of the United
fitates. shall be the' supreme -law. - of the'
land; andthe Judges In every -State-shall'
be bound thereby, anything in tne consti
tution or laws of any State to the contrary
notwithstanding." "' " '
- Certainly the Government of the United
States Is a limited government; and so la
every State government a limited govern-1

" KMtML with nroner limitations of power.
are essential to the existence of the Consti
tution ol the United States. " At the very
' commencement, when we assumed a place
' amonir the- Dowers of the earth, the Dec
laration of Independence was adopted by
States; so also were the Articles of (Jonfed
eratlonf and -when "the People, of - the
Uaited States" ordained and: established
the Constitution, it was the assent ot the
States, one by-one, which gave it vitality.
' In the event, too, of any amendment to the
Constitution, the proposition of Congress
needs the confirmation of States. Without
States, one great branch of the legislative
government would be wanting. And, if
-we look beyond the letter of the Constitu
tion to the character ot our country,, its oa-
- paclty tor comprehendlng'Wtthln iu juris
diction a vast continental empire is uue to
the system of States. The best security lor
the perpetual existence ot the States: U the
"supreme authority" of the Constitution ot
the United States J The perpetuity pf the
Constitution bring with, it: (ha perpetuity
of the States; their mutual relation makes
us what we are, and in our political system
their connexion is indiseoluble. The whole
cauhot exist ' without the parts, nor the
parts without the whole. So long as the
Constitution of thetJnlted SUtes endures,
the States will endure; the" destruction of
the one is the destruction of the other; the
preservation of the one is the preservation
of the other. x , v - ',
I have thus explained my views of the
mutual relations of the Constitution and
the States, because they unfold the prin
ciples on which I have sought to solve the
momentous qnestlons and overcome the
appalling d jlllcultles that met.me at the very
cowuiencetrientbt my administration. It has
been my steadfast object to escape from the
Sway or momentary passions, and to derive
a healing policy from the fundamental and
unchanging prineiples-of the ConatitutloiK
; 1 found the States suficrliis from the ef
fects of a civil war. Resistance to the Gen
eral Government appeared to haye ex;,
hausted Itself.. The United Ststes nad'fe
covered possession of their forts and arse
nals ; aud their arm lea were in the occupa
tional' every State which had attempted to
secede. Whether the territory within the
limits of those States should beheld as con
quered territory,' under military authority
emanatrng Iroiu the President as tte head
of the army Was the first question that pre
sented itself fordecislon. v
Now, military governments,' established
foron Indefinite period, would hayebflon d

would haveeovenomed hatred, rather than

no hreclseilirait tq their continuance was
conceivable. - They would have occasioned
an incalculable and exhausting' expense.
Peaceful emigration to and IrOm tliat por-
tion of tha country is o.,e of the bent means
that can behught of for the' restoration
of harmony; aild thatmtgration would

TheiKMvvre of patronaa and -rule which
Would have beeu exereUetl, under tht Prua
ldcnt, over a vast, and populous, and natur
ally wevlthy region, are greater" than, nil
less under extreme. necessity, I should be
willing to entrust td any one man ; thty are
such as, for myself,.! could never, unless on
occasions of great emergency, consent to
exercise. The wilful use of Buch powers, if
'continued through a period of years, would
nave endangered tne purity or tne general
adininbtratJon and the liberties of,. the
; States which remained loyal. i j. -ni -i - i
Besides, the policy of military role over a
i conquered territory, would have implied
that the States whose Inhabitants may have
' taken part in the rebellion bad,' by the 'act
of those inhabitants, ceased to exists liuf
the true theory is, that all pretended acta
of secession were, ""from the . begin
"Ina .Pl'll and .void. The States can-ritit-
commit treason, ' nor .airaeu, Jie
Individual citizen who may have com
mitted treason, any more than they can
maker valid treaties or engage in lawful
commerce with any foreign-Power. - The
States attempting to secede placed them
selves in a condition where their vitality
waff impaired, but not extinguished their
functions suspended, but not destroyed.
But it any State neglects or refuses toper
form its olliecs, there Is the more need thnt
the General Government should maintain
all its authority, and, as soon as practica
ble, resume the exerclseof all ita functions.
On this principle I have acted,' and have
gradually and quietly, and by almost im
perceptible steps, sought to restore the
rightful energy of the General GoVernment
and of the States. "To that end, Provisional
Governors have been appointed for the
States, Conventions called. Governors elect
ed, Legislatures assembled, and-r Senators
and liepresentatives chosen to the Congress
ot the United States. : At the same time,
the Courts of the United States, as far as
could be done, have been reopened, so that
the laws 'f. the. United States- may be
enforced through their agency . . The block
ade has been removed and the custom
houses re-established ' in ports of entry eo
that the revenue of the United States may
be collected. The Post Office Department
renews ita ceaseless activity, and the Genr
eral'Gbvernraent Is thereby 'enablt'cTto com
municate promptly with its olllcora and
agents. The courts bring security, to per
sons and propertyrthe-openlng ot the ports
invites the restoration ot industry and coui-
ratffOj the post office renews thalacilities
of social intercourse and of business. And
is jt pot happy for nsaU, that the restora
tion of each one of these functions of the
General Government brings with it a bless
ing to the States over which they are ex
tended? Is it not a sure promise of har
mony and renewed attachment to the Union
that, after all that has happened, the return
of the General Government is known only
as a Denencencer
I know very well that this policy is at
tended with some risk: that for its success
it requires at least the acnulescence of the'
States which ft concerns: that it implies an
invitation to those States, by renewing their
jtllcgiance.tqtbe United States, to resume
their lunctions as States ol the Union. But
it is a risk that must be taken; in the choice
of difficulties. It is the smallest risk; and to
diminish, and, , if. possible, to remove' all
danger, I .hav.efejt It incumbent on mi to
assert one orner power oi the uenerai uov
ernment the power of pardon. As no State
can throw a defence over (be crime of trea
son, the power of pardon is exclusively'
vested in the Executive Government of the
U Alted States. In exercislifg that power
I have .taken -every precaution, to connect
it with the clearest recognition of the bind
ing torce ol tne laws ot the u uiteu states,
auiTjaii unqualified tfckbpwledgiaent of the
great social change of condition in regard
to sii.very wnicu nas grown out oi tne war.
The next step which I have taken to re
store the constitutional relations of the
States, haa been an inyitation to .thein ,to
participate in the high, office of amending
the Constitution. Every patriot must wish
for a general amnesty at the earliesc epoch
consistent with public safety... For- thjs
great end there U need ot Concurrence of
all opinions, and the spirit of mutual conciliation.-
All parties in the late terrible
conflict must work together In harmony.
It is not too much to ask, in the name or
the whole people, that, on the one side the
plan ot restoration shall proceed in confor-
tmty Wltn a wuungues w caav urevr
ders of the past into oblivion ( and that, on
the other, the evidence oi sincerity in tne
future maintenance of the Uuion shall be
put beyond any doubt by the ratification
or the proposed amendment to the Consti
tution, which provides for the abolition of
slavery forever within the limits of our
country. , So long as the. adoption of this
amendment is delayed, so long will doubt,
and jealousy, aud uncertainty prevail, aims
is the measure which will efface the tad
memory of the past; this is the measure
which will most certainly call population,
and capital, and security to those parts of
the Union that need them nost.. . Indeed,
it is not too much to ask of the States which
are now resumiug their places In the faml
It of the Union to give this pledge of per
p'etual loyalty and peace. . Until Jt U done,
the past, however much we may, desire It,
will not be forgotten. The adoption of the
amendment reunites us beyond all powerof
disruption. It heals the wound that Is still
imperfectly closed; it removes slavery,' the
element which has so long perplexed and
divided the country; it makes ot us once
more a united- people renewed and
strengthened, bound more than ever to
mutual affection and support.
Tho Arhnr!ment"M the Corifitttutlon be
ing adopted, it would remain foYthe States
whose powers have been so long" lri abey
ance, to resume their places iu the two
branches of the National Legislature, aud
thereby complete tnewora or restoration.
Ilere It is lor yoUifellow-dtlzens of the
Senate, and for you, fellow-cltlzens of the
House of Representatives, to judge, each of
VOU for yourselves, 01 uie elections, reiurua,
and quaullcatlorj pf your own members.
The full assertion of th powers of the
General Government Tendinis the holding of
Circuit Court of the United States within
. the districts where their authority has been
Uitmnptci'l. In the present posture of our
public affairs, strong objections have been
nrgod to holding those courts in any. of the
But where the rebellion has exiitteil; And
it was aooertaiDed, by inquiry, tbat the Cir
cuit Court of the United States would not
be held within the District of Virginia dur
ing the autamn or eurly winter, uor until
Congress should have " an opportunity to
consider and act on the whole subject." To

branch of the civil authority of the United
, States 1 therefore necessarily rwfefrod.-Wlflf

for the resumption of all: ita-fuiwtions-, It
is manifest tbat treason, most flagrant in
character- haa been .committed.. Persons

;hare fair and impartial trials in the highest
i civil tribunals of the country, in order tbat
the Constitution aud the laws may he fully

and affirmed that treason is a crime, that
I traitors should be punished and the off ense
j made infamous; and, at the same time, tbat
ithe-question may be judicially settled,
finally-aad forever, that no State of its own
1 will hae the right to renouaoe it place in
the Union.
J The relations of the General Government
! towards toff fonr, million? pf Inhabitants
I whom the war has called into freedomhave
; engaged my most serious consideration. On
' tha propriety. of attempting to make the
, ffeeoniau electors ay tbaproclainiatiodof the
i Executive, I took for my oounsel the Consti
I tution itself, the interpretations of that in
! strument by its authors and their contempo
raries, and recent legislation by Congress.
When, at the jlrst movement towards inde
pendence, the Congress of- the Uaited States
instructed the several States to institute
governments of their own, they left each
State to decide for itself the conditions fur
the enjoymeut - of the- elsotive franchise. i
' During the period of the Confederacy, there
: continued to exist a very great diversity in
the qualifications of electors in the several
States: and even within aStateadistinction
of qualttloatiOTB prevailed: --with regard to
the officers who were to' be chosen. The
Constitution of tbeUuited States recognizes
these diversities when it enjmns that, in the
choice of members- of the- llousa of,fypre
seutatives of the United States, " the elec
tors in each State shall have the qualifica
tions requisite foe electors of the uost nu
merous branch of the State Legislature. "
After the formation of the Constitution, it
remained, as before, the uniform usage for
each State to eularge the body of its
electors, according; to its own judgment;
and. under this system, oue State after an
other has proceeded to increase the number of
its electors, until now universal suitr9ge,o?
srimethtbg ,ver it) it, Is "the general ruhji
So fixed was this reservation of power in the
habits of the people, aud so unquestion
ed has beeu ithe interpretation of the
Constitution, that ' daring thd' civil war
the late President never harbored the
purpose ceitainly, never. , avowed ..the
purpose -of 4 disregarding ' itfl ,and 'ia
ttie sets of Congress, dunng h - period,
nothing can be found which, during the con
tinuance of hostilities, much less after their
close, would bare sanctioned hoy departure
by the Executive from i polity which has so
uniformly obtained. Moreover, a concession
of the elective franchise, to the freedmen, by
act of the President of the United States,
must have been extended to all colored men,
wherever found, and so must haye establish
ed a change of suffrage in -the. Northern,
Middle and Western Stales, not less than in
the Southern and Southwestern Such en
Act would have created a new clas of voters,
and wonld have been an assumption of pow
er by the President which nothing in the
Constitution or laws of the United States
would have warranted, r ,;. ; t ', i. ;
Ou the other band, every danger of con
flict is Avoided when the settlement of the
question is referred to the several States.
Tbey can, each for itself, decide on the meas
ure, and whether it is to be" adopted at once
and absolutely, or introduced gradually and
with conditions. In my "judgment, the
freedmen, if they show patience aud manly
virtues, will sooner obtain a partloipation iu
the elective franchise through the States
than through the General Government, even
if it bad power to intervene, wnen tne tu
mult of emotioDB that have been raised by
the suddenness of the social change shall
have subsided, it may prove that, they will
receive the kindliest usage from some of
those on whdin they have heretofore most,
closely depended. -, - .-,
But while I have no doubt that nowi after
the close of the war, it is not competent for
the General Government to etftnUtbe elec
tive franchise in the-several i&tates, it is.
equally clear that good faith requires the se
curity of the freedmen in their liberty and
their property, their right to labor, and their
right to claim the Just return of their labor.
I cannot too strongly nrge a dispassionate
treatment of this subject, which should be
carefully kept aloof from all party strife..
We must equally avoid basty assusnptious of
any natural impossibility for the two races
to live side by side, in a state of mu
tual benefit and good- wilL ..The experi
ment involves us .in no inconsistency ;
let US' then,' go on and make that experi
ment in good faith, and not be too
easily disheartened. The .country is in

Whtle their right of voluntary migration
and expatriation is not to. be questioned, I
would not advise their forced removal and
colonisation. - Let as rather encourage them
to honorable and useful industry, where it
may be beneficial to themselves and to the'
:eeuntry ; and, instead of hasty anticipations
of the certainty of failure, let there be noth
ing wanting to the tiftr trial of the experi
ment. The change In their coudition is the
substitution of labor by ftontraot for the
.status, of slavery. The freedman cannot
fairly be accused or nn willingness to worK.so1
long as a doubt remains about his freedom of
choice in his pursuits, and1 the certainty of
his recovering his stipulated wages,-, .In this

And if the oue ought to Ue abje to enforce

, Our debt is doubly secure first in, the
actual wealth and still greater undeveloped
resources of tlie country; and next in the
: character of our institutions. The most in
, telligunt observers among political esono
mista have not failed to remark that the
public debt of a country is safe in propor
tion as Its ' people" nre'free; thai, the
debt of a republic - is the safest of
ell.': '"- Ouri ; history - cbnfinu! r.- and
establishes the tliaory, and is; I- lirmly believe,
destined to givelt a still more signal illustra
tion. -Thersecrepf ibis superiority springs not
merely from the fact that in a republic the na
tional obligations are' distributed more widely
through countless numbers in all classes of
society ; it has Its root In the character of ohr
laws, llcre all men contribute td the public
welfare, and bear their fair share of .the public
burdens, l'jpring the war, under the impulses
pf patriotism, the men of the great body pf the
people, without regard tq their own comparative
- want of wealthy 'thronged to our armies and
; Ulled our fleets of war, and' held themselves
"ready to offer their lives for tho. public .good.
Now, in their turn, the properly aud income of
the country should bear their just proportion f
1 'the burden of taxation," while lq' ouri'tmptist,
system, through means of which increased i'i lull
ity is incidentally imparted to all th indUtrtal
interests of the nation, the duties should be so
adjusted as to tall most heavily on articles of
luury,.leavlng the' necessaries' Oftilo'aS frce:
from taxation as the absolute wants of the
Go'v'er'nment7eBonnnicaly administered,., will
jusfify." Ko favored class should derriand
freedom from assessment, and the taxes should
be so distributed s not to full unduly on the
poor, but rather on the accumulated wealth of
the country.: Ve should lock at the national
dubt just as It is not as a national blessing, (but
as a heavy burden on tbe industry of the country,,
to' be discharged without unnecessary delay.
It-is estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury
that the expenditures for the fiscal year
ending the 80th of June,-1866, will exceed the
receipts $H'i.lSl,947. It Is gratifying, bow-'
ever; to ;State that it is ilso estimated
that the revenue for the year ending
tfio-BOthtof -June., -1867,-will- exeesd , the
.expundlbures la the sum of $Ul.G!18.--This
amount, or so much as may be deemed
suiHcicnt for the purpose, may-be applied
to the reduction of the public debt, which,
on the 81stdy of October 18(55; .was j$2,
740.854.750. Every reduction wilj dimin-
ish the total amount of interest to he paid,
and so enlarge the means of still further re
ductions, until the whole shall be liquidate
ed; and this, as will be seen from the estl-i
mutes of the Secretary of the Treasury,
jiiay be accomplished by annual payments
' even within a period hot exceeding thlfty
years. I have faith that we shall do all this
within a reasonable time; that, as we have
auiazud, the world by the .suppression, of a
chrll warwhich wa( thought- to be beyond
the control of any Government, so we shall
equally show the superiority of our iusti-i
tutlons by the prompt aud ''faithful, dls-j
charge of our national obligations'. 1
