It is one of the curiosities of the
presidential election 'that the banner
republican township should be located
in North Carolina. In the Shelton

The use of Niagara falls as a gen­
erator of electrical power on a large
scale, followed by successful experi­
ments all over the United States, as
well as in Europe, has led to the in­

elsewhere for water power schemes.
The Kentucky1 girls certainly know
how to bet. One of them won a man
on the election, and she naturally ex­
presses herself as particularly well
pleased with her winnings. Being
single and of marriageable age she is
not at a loss to know what to do with
him.
The Victoria Cross, the medal
awarded by. Queen Victoria for ex­
traordinary bravery and courage, is
nn honor that is an Honor, and but
ISO men alive to-day are entitled to
wear it. The act that entitles a sol­

takes him into another world.
Georgia has within its borders four

The ornithologists of Great Britain
and America have just finished a spirit­

It is important to address mail
matter plainly and carefully. A gov­
ernment report recently issued shows
that during the past year 50,553 of
the letters sent to the dead letter of­
fice contained money orders, drafts,
checks and 'money to the aggregate
value of $1,136,045. More than one
person is waiting for "the letter that
never came."
Fairly reliable statistics show that
13,000,000,000 of hens' eggs will have
to be laid in the. United States during
the year 1900—a startling estimate
truly, inasmuch as these eggs, stood
one on. tpp of another, point to butt,
would make a column 461,648 miles in
altitude—nearly twice the height of
the moon from the earth when that orb
is seen overhead. The annual value of
this product exceeds that of any min­
eral except coal, and is greater even
than that of'our pig iron.
It has been decided by the United
States court of appeals that the ordi­
nary predictions of the weatheT bu­
reau are not trustworthy and that men
are not bound to consider them. The
master of a ship unloaded his cargo
of rice at Charleston, putting it on an
uncovered whar£ where it was spoiled
by rain, which had been predicted by
the weather bureau. Litigation fol­
lowed as to payment and a lower court
found against the sea captain. He ap­
pealed, with the result noted above.
The report of the treasurer of the
United States shows that the coin of
the realm that is most extensively coun­
terfeited nowadays is the copper one
cent piece. During the year there were
detected and destroyed at: the offices
of the treasury $11,146 in counterfeit
silver coins, notes and certificates, 3,277
five-cent pieces and 121,652 one-cent
pieces,' and the number of spurious mi­
nor coins in circulation is rapidly on the
increase. Counterfeit gold coins are
xiare, only 13 having been presented at
the treasury during the past fiscal
year.
Plans are being drawn for a trans
Atlantic liner that" will make the jour­
ney in four 3 ays^ and compared with
this speed the Deutschland will be a
slow boat. The Deutschland is 638 feet
.long, displaces 23,000 tons, has a horse­
power of 37,000, and attains a speed of
23.36 knots. The four-day beat will be
930 feet long, 87 feet of beam, with a dis­
placement of 40,000 tons, a horse-power
of 110,000, and a speed of 30 knots. We
believe ,tl)at the four-day boat is vision­
ary, but in their race for records there
is no telling where the rival companies
tyill stop unless they are restrained.
Ali Ferrouh Bey, the Turkish minis­

eagerly to learn the nature of Ger­
many's greeting to the exile. Its ef­
fect on the fortunes of the embattled
burghers and: on the relations of Euro­
pean nations to each other was regard­
ed as of the greatest import. As usual
with him,'Einperor William In making
known his decision left no room for
misunderstanding as to his attitude.
"Anpther step trfward the solidifying
of'thee Anglo-Gerihan aftiance" ik the
verdict of Europe on the kaiser's ac­
tion. It is a source of jubilation to
Great Britain and of keenest' disap­
pointment to Kruger's friends, who had
expected from Germany, if not the en­
thusiastic Welcome that France had ex­
tended, at least a warm tendef of hos­
pitality.
Visit Hot Aanreeablie.
The Cologne Gazette, in an inspired
article, says:
"Mr, Krufcer's visit is not agreeable, to
Germany, his aim being to obtain Inter­
vention in 8outh Africa. It would be a,
grave political mistake, it would be even
a great crime, to allow him to entertain
even a spark of hope that Germany will
render him any practical support"
This declaration is accompanied
with reproaches, Mr. Kruger being
charged with "having encouraged a
useless guerrilla warfare and having
disregarded Germany's advice when
he might have still followed it." The
press generally strikes the same note.
The emperor's intimation was con­
veyed to Mr. Kruger by the German
envoy at Luxembourg, who arrived at
Cologne Strndajr'.
Pleases Englasd.
London, Dec. 3.—All the London
morning papers comment with. un­
bounded enthusiasm upon the abrupt
snub administered by Emperor Wil­
liam to Mr. Kruger, which is all the
more noticeable when contrasted with
the Boer statesman's successful visit
to France. The snub is regarded as
further evidence of the good relations
existing between Germany and Great
Britain. The official explanation of­
fered through the German press is
that steps had not been taken to as­
certain whether Mr. Kruger's visit
would, be agreeable.,1 The Boer dele­
gates admit that they have received
a serious check, and Mr. Kruger is said
to .be extremely disheartened! There
is a rumor that he has been requested
to avoid Belgian territory.
Surprise la Paris.
Paris, Dec. 3.—Emperor William's re­
fusal to .receive Mr. Kruger has caused
general surprise here. Most of the
morning papers make it an excuse fot
articles- sympathizing with the Boer
statesman or:condemning the.kaiser.
''The'kaiser is no longer a modern
Lohengrin," says the Echo de Paris,
"but a simple disciple of Bismarck,
fais attitude is dictated by the interests
of Germany, which he considers iden­
tical with those of England."
FLOOD IN ROME.
Historic Tiber Overflows It« Banlcs,
Caaslap Great Rain—Three
Lives Are Lost.
Rome, Dec. 3.—The Tiber has over­
flowed its banks, and the entire lower
|art of the City is threatened. Three
lives have been lost in the flood, and
much damage is reported from the
country and from the district of the
city affected. The flood is caused by
the recent heavy rains, which have so
swollen the stream that the water
level has reached an unprecedented
height. The more elevated parts of
Rome are crowded with refugees who
were forced to abandon their inun­
dated homes. Most of the homeless
people belong^ to the poorer classes,
and few have been able to save any
of their belongings. Many landslips
have occurred along the railways,
blocking traffic. News from the rural
districts along the Tiber shows that
great damage has been done to farms
and cattle. The rise of the Tiber ex­
ceeds1 that of 1870, but', the damage
has been limited by the recently con
structed dikes at the lowest points.
The Pantheon and the Forum, the
neighboring street*/ and a part of the
Hospital San Spirito are iriundated.
TTlie surrounding country and the
Protestant cemetery outside St. Paul's
gate are also submerged. Railroad

V**lt at' St. Pflrial,
St. Paul, MUitt^, Deo. 3.—Under a
gloomy *nd mournful sky. in the pres
ence of an immense crowd of people,
the body of the late Cushman Kellogg
Davis was Saturday consigned to' the
earth, closing the earthly career of one
who has. been, foremost in the councils
of the nation for many years, a leader
among statesmen. Because of the
of
the
and
deceased it was de?
al)!^ to have the ftineral services at the
re*idence on Farrington avenue,
the hundreds who gathered from
all 'partf Of the country to pay their
lasi'-tribute^bf respect to the dead, and
to sl^ow their heartfelt sympathy with
tha^bereaved family
and
state, stood
under the trees in the snow, in the
pclriph and in the hall and the parlors of
the houi&
Magnificent masses of flowers filled
the house with perfume, giving testi­
mony to the sweetness of human sym­
pathy. President and Mrs McKinley
•had sent a beautiful wreath from the
white house. An immense wreath of
chrysanthemums overlaid with white
roses and orchids testified to the love
and esteem of the late senator's asso­
ciates in the United States senate, a
second tribute coming from the house
of representatives.
The exercises at the home at 11
o'clock ,were of the simplest character,
Rev. C. D. Andrews, of Christ church,
read the impressive service of the
Protestant Episcopal church, as­
sisted by Rev. Theodore W* Sedg­
wick, of the Church of St. John the
Evangelist, who read the lesson. Mu­
sic was furnished by a quartette, con­
sisting of Miss Florence Marion Pace,
Mrs. Jane Huntington Yale. Mr. Harry
E. George and Mr. H. E. Phillips, who
sang "Lead, Kindly Light," "Peace,
Perfect .Peace" and "For All Thy
Saints."
The exercises we're brief and the fu­
neral procession then formed and took
its way along the snowy streets to the
^Oakland cemetery, where Rev. Dr. An­
drews read the committal service and
the body was lowered into the vault
in the beautiful little chapel. The pall­
bearers were all old friends of the de­
ceased statesmen, as follows:
James J. Hill. Judge Walter H. San­
born, Judge Charles E. Flandrau, ex
Gov. John S. Pillsbury, ex-United States
Senator W. D. Washburn. Hon. Samuel
R. Thayer, E. W. Peet and Robert G.
Evans.
DUKE AND BRIDE ARRIVE.
Manchester la Met In New York bjr
His Father-ln-Law and De­
tective*.
New York. Dec. 3.—Unlimited mys­
tery with the accompaniment of two
central office detectives marked the
return to this* country Saturday
of the young duke of Manches­
ter with his newly-wedded Ameri­
can duchess, who was Miss Zim­
merman, of Cincinnati. The ducal
party arrived on the steamship St.
Louis, which was ten hours late, reach­
ing the pier shortly after seven p. m.
The first person to greet the duchess
in her stateroom when the revenue cut­
ter put its boarding officer^ and vis­
itors ovei the side of the St. Louis was,
her father. The second was Detective*
Vallely. From that moment until the
party reached the apartments Mr.^Zim­
merman had reserved for them at the
Holland house the duke was not for a
moment beyond the surveillance of De­
tective Vallely. or Detective Stripp, who
accompanied him.
Mr. Zimmerman wa9 one of the first
to go up the side of the St. liouis when
the.vessel arrived. The detectives were
next. The father of the duchess en­
tered the stateroom, in the center of
which stood his daughter, with the
duke by her side, kissed her, while tears
stood in his eyes, and then shook#Man
Chester by the hand. "Congratulations,
sincere congratulations," he said, "and
welcome home."
The duke of Manchester, the
duchess of Manchester and Eugene
Zimmerman, her father, passed Sun­
day quietly at the Holland house. The
two detectives who met them at the
pier have been withdrawn, and Capt.
McClusky explained their presence by
saying:
'Two letters, evidently from a 'crank/
making vague threats of 'egging* the

TRAINS COLLIDE.
Eleven Persona Killed and Many Hnrt
In Worst Railroad Disaster
In Mexican History.
Sans Antonio. Tex.. Dec. 3.—A terri­
ble collision, in which 11 persons
were 'killed and about 20 hurt, oc­
curred on. the. Mexican Central rail­
way on Thursday afternoon between
Tamanacha and Simon, 50 miles south
of Jumilico. The first news- of the.
disaster reached here Sunday. Edward
-Rische. a eitizen of San Antonio,-was at
the scene 20 minutes after the engines
crashed together. The place where
the toreck occurred is in a valley at the
foot of two immense hills. At the time
both trains were running 30 miles an
hour. One of the trains had on board
a. construction, crew numbering- 150
men. The other was a freight train
of 55 empty cars. Three, engines and
about 40 cars were piled up 80feet high.
Two Americans, train employes, were
forced to flee to avoid being lynched.
The names of the killed and injured

be the most serious wreck that has
ever occurred in Mexico.
Engineer Ross and Firemen Reeves

Washington, Dec. 3.—Administration
officials continue sanguine that the
ministers of the powers at Peking will
soon reach a common ..ground of agree­
ment in the demands to be made upon
the Chinese imperial government in
satisfaction for the Boxer outrages.
The state department- Is in communir
cation with the minister^ and ambas­
sadors of the United States to the
European courts, and advices which
have come from them, from time to
time lead the officials here to hope that
the powers will be brought to the posi­
tion maintained by the United States
in-dealing with'the Chinese, viz.: that
there should not be demands made
upon the imperial government which
it is hot able to fulfill. Our government
has persistently held to this view in
the progress of the negotiations be­
tween the ministers at Peking, and if
the principle of this contention can be
maintained in the combined note to be
handed to the Chinese plenipotentiaries
a decided advantage will be had at the
start. The attitude of our government
on this subject has been made clear to
Mr. Conger. The meeting between him
and the .German and French minister^
Saturday at Peking presumably was in
compliance with the minister's latest
instruction from ^Washington. Noth­
ing has been heard from Mr. Conger
by the state department for several
dajTs.

THE PURE
GRAIN COFFEE
For Infiuits and Chfldron
The-American man or woman is industrious. Our leisure class is small,
our working world very large. Many of our leading citizens of great wealth
are hard workers. Our laboring classes
are found in herds and hordes in the
hivfes of industry." What is all this work
for? In most cases it is for daily bread,
in many for maintenance of others. Great
numbers also work to acquire Wealth.
Some for great commercial prominence.
Some to preserve intact a splendid inheri­
tance. Necessity, generosity and ambition
are the inspiration of all classes of indus­
try, and the object of every one falls to the
ground when ill-health attacks him.
Maintaining health is the most vital
thing, in the world for workers of every
class,' and the usefulness of Dr. Gffc&ene's
Nervura blood and nerve remedy, as a
strengthened of the constitutional and
vital powers, is beyond all question. This
great remedy enters into partnership
with Nature and helps human beings do
their work without giving up to prema­
ture decay. The strain of work is on the
minds of some, on the bodies of others,
but the nourishing of either, or both, is
in the nerves and blood. Nervura acts
directly on the fountains of health and
its strengthening power is wonderful.
Dr. Greene's
NERVURA
for the Blood and Nerves.
What does the worker do when some chronic
trouble manifests itself He takes some stimulant or
something which is designed for temporary effect, and
simply weakens his already overworked system. How
different from this is the work of Nervura! How
beautifunts support to the natural powers! With­
out shock of any kind its purely vegetable elements
seek out the weak spots and build them up. Imme­
diately' the circulation of the blood improves and the sluggish
elements are expelled. The nerves are quieted, the quality of
the blood is enriched and the new and strengthening tide communicates itself
to every muscle of the body.
Grain-0 is..not a stimulant, like
coffee. It is a tonic and its effects
are permanent.
A successful substitute for coffee,
because it has the coffee flavor that
everybody likes.

Electric Co., of Lynn, Mass., says:
