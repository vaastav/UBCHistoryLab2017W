Texas, in the fiscal years of 1906 and
1907, will pay $900,000 to confederate
veterans for pensons, besides expending
$164,53$ for the support of the confed
erate home.
This is a rood country. "Every sun.
set during the past five years has regis
tered an Increase of $3,400,000 In the
value of the farms to this country,"
according to the statement of Secretary
Wilson of the Department of Agrlcur
ture. In his annual report.
The public debt of Russia, according
to the latest official figures. Is approx-
imately$4,000,000,000 (7,681,895,948 rubles)
This sum Is larger by 616,000,000 rubles
than the total debt one years ago. In
addition to the public debt there is
said to be a very large private indebt
edness. Of the entire debt, public and
private, owed In foreign countries, the
great bulk la held tn France and Gei
Nathan Straus of New York, who has
given liberally both time and money to
secure pure food, and especially pure
milk for Infants was the chief cause
of consumption in adults. He support
ed his statement by quoting scientific
authority and added that a prominent
Belcher had told him that out of
herd of 111 cows bought for the New
Tork market, 27 were found, to have
diseased lungs and that 10 per cent of
all cows bought for slaughter in that
market were Infected with the disease.
The SuUan of Turkey Is not suppos
ed to understand any language but his
own, and therefore all official ques
tions must be laid before htm by an in
terpreter, j This person usually thun
ders his majesty's questions at the for
eigner, but cringes and shivers with
awe while listening to his royal mas
ter. V The oontrast of manner thus
shown borders on the ludicrous. At the
conclusion of such interviews the Sul
ton usually rises from his throne and
says quietly, either In the visitor's lan
guage -or In French: "Now that our
business Is concluded, you will come

During Queen Victoria's reign it was
the custom at the Chapel Royal, St.
James', to open & bottle of the price
less old Maderia from the Buckingham
Palace cellars In the vestry after ser
vice whenever an outsider came to
preach. A few years ago the present
bishop of London preached in the chap
el, and a bottle was opened as usual.
He had no sooner tasted the wine than
he remarked that It was the rankest
bad sherry that could possibly be
bought- ' The sub-deacon had the af
fair Investigated, and found that for
years the verger had been substituting
for the royal Maderia a bottle of the
cheapest sherry procurable, and selling
the bottles obtained fro mfrhe Queen's
cellar.
The central department of the French

be is to grow. It is growing. The work
of the United States civil service com
mission is constantly on the increase,
and In Us report Just made It is re
corded that 130,000 persons took civil
service examinations last year for
places in the United States govern
ment service, and that positions were
secured by 40,000 of them. So great
has been the number of persons that
take examinations that the expense
has mounted up until the commission
now recommends the collection of a
small fee from applicants for examina
tion- It is hoped by the collection of
this fee to eliminate from examinations
the large number of persons who take
them out of curiosity or for the sake
of securing a higher rating on the elig
ible list through re-examlnation.
Perhaps the civil service commission
knows just what it Is about In recom
mending a fee for the privilege of being
examined, but we doubt It. In this
land of the free there Shouldn't be any
restriction placed on legitimate and
meritorious ofBce-seeking.
XOT AIZ LITERATE,
This is a country of light and learn
ing, and yet tfcere are many too many
illiterate in it. There are 6,180,069 per-
sens more than ten years of age who
are Illiterate. This Is one-tenth of the
whole number of persons ten years old
and over. The proportion is 106 6 illit
erates to 1,000 of population. The ne
groes are chiefly responsible for this
large figure. If they are excluded, the
proportion of the illiterate in the na
tive white population is found to be
46.4 per 1,000, or less than 1 in 20. For
the negroes the proportion Is 444.7 per
1,000. For foreign-born whites the pro
portion is 128.5 per 1,000. Progress Is
being made. In 1890 the figure for ne
gro Illiterates was 567-6 per 1,000; native
whites, 62.3; foreign born whites, 130-6.
Evidence of progress is seen also in the
fact that among those of ages from 10
to 14 there are but 71-5 illiterates per
1,000, while in those of the age of 65
and over the Illiterates are 198.5 per
1,000. The younger generation is the
less illiterate. There is evidence that
girls are tending to become less Illit
erate than boys. At the younger age
periods the girls are already less illit
erate than the boys, taking fuller ad-,
vantage of school facilities.
As might be expected. Illiteracy is fn
general greater in the South than In
the North for all classes of population.
Perhaps the fairest Tasls of compari
son between the two ' sections Is that
for native white children Hying In cit
ies of more than. 25,000 inhabitants. ' in
the North Atlantic division the. illiter
acy for this class of children is 2.1 and
In the North Central 19; in the South
Atlantic division it Is 8.3, anif in the
South Central 13 7. In considering the
significance i of such comparisons it
should be remembered that the South
has a larger number of children in
proportion to population than the North
and a smaller per capita wealth. The
South Is, moreover, handicapped by the
necessity of maintaining separate
schools for whites and negroes.
A FLT xtr THE OlXTMEin.
There is so much that is all right in
the President's message that it is both
surprising and painful that he felt
bound to recommend the Immediate
admission of two States one to be
composed of Oklahoma and the Indian
Territory, the other to be composed of
New Mexico and Arizona. How he
could have arrived at such a recom
mendation Is not understood by those
Who know the condition of the territo
ries and the feeling of the people of the
territories, especially the people of Ar
izona- There will be a strong protest
against the recommendation. In fact,
it has already begun- For Instance,
the (Hartford Courant calls it a recom
mendation of injustice and points out
that it is not like Theodbre Roosevelt
to be unjust. It adds': What evil coun
sellors have secured his ear? He says
there is ho Justification for delay. Is
there any justification for raw, head
long hftste for , dragging reluctant,
protesting Amrlcan populations Into
the Union by sheer force? Upon the
political side, the party in power has
had (in the free-coinage scare) a rath
er impressive lesson on the folly of
picking territories before they are ripe
in order to increase the number of re
publican votes In the Senate. But this
time It isn't so much politics that is in
a hurry as speculative greed largely
of Pennsylvania antecedents. The
President's motives are above suspi
cion, but' he's on the wrong side of this
"Statehood" question and in decidedly
shady company.
The indications are that there will be
a lively contest over this matter in
Congress. It is known that some of
the congressmen who have been in fa
vor of the course recommended by the
President' have changed their minds,
and it is to be hoped that tfcere will be
contrary minds enough to carry the
day for justice and good sense.

William T. Stead, who recently re
turned to England from Russia, thinks

subjects are likely to bo in serious per-

Petersburg,

ment was financed in England and di
rected from London. This seemed to
be a matter of common faith even
among persons who professed friend
ship for England- The accidental de
parture of the British ambassador for
home, contemporaneously with the oc
currence of the railroad strike, was
quoted as proof positive that he had
full knowledge of all that was to hap
pen. A repent number of the Moscow
Gazette was devoted to the support of
the theory that the revolution is of
English origin. As evidence of this it
argued that Russian Nihilists and ter
rorists, even though their hand3 were
stained with blood, were always shel
tered and feted in England, that Eng
lish Liberals like Mr. R. Spence Wat
son were members of "the Friends of
Russian Freedom," that English publi
cists like Sir Frederic Pollock had fos
tered, more or less openly, the agita
tion which had let loose the revolution
ary forces, which are now bearing
their natural fruit in massacre and ar
son. Moreover, the Jewish agitation
against Russia always had its head
quarters in London.
Mr. Stead argues that if this feeling
prevails in newspaper offices and
drawing-rooms it is probably to be
found also, in the street, and that
therefore It behooves Europeans, Eng-
lishmen
and Americans to take pre

COUNTERFEITS MADE BY HAND.
Spurious American Bills for Circula
tion In the Orient.
The counterfeitinir Investigation
started here when the transport Sher
man was In port is going on in four
widely separated parts of the world.
The authorities are working; in Hono
lulu, San Francisco, Nagasaki and Ma
nila. The result is not unlikely to
be an important exposure of making
of bad American money In the Orient,
in which clever Japanese artists may
play a large part.
No money is easier to pass In the
Orient than American," for every paper
certificate from Washington is known
to be Just as good as gold itself, and
the scheme is thought to have been to
use the money in . cities like Nagasaki,
where a more or less Imperfect bill Is
easier to pass than it would be here In
America. The attempt to pass a bill I
here was very likely due to an emer
gency In the finances of a soldier, but
it has probably exposed the whole
scheme.
A careful examination of the coun
terfeit $10 bill now In the possession
of District Attorney Breckons shows
that It was made by hand, apparently
carefully drawn with pen and Ink.
This is the bill which was offered at
