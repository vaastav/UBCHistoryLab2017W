BRONCHITIS
Druggists W. E. Warren k Bro Tell the
People Quickest Means to Cure It. -
Asked one day in their store the ques
tion, "What is good for bronchitis?'' A
member of the above linn answered,
"For years old fashioned cod liver oil
has been known to possess the most re
markable curative and healing proper
ties for throat, bronchial, and lung
troubles of anything known to medicine,
but on account of the grease which en
veloped its curative principles, it has
been impossible for many people to take
enough of It into their systems to com
bat a thoroughly settled disease without
clogging the systom and u psettlng the
stomach.
"Now, however," continue! this well
known druggist, "we have Vlnol which
contains In a highly concentrated form
all of the medicinal currtive elements of
cod liver oil actually taken from fresh
cods' livers, without a drop of oil or
grease to upset the stomach and retard
its work, and physicians agree that It is
the greatest cure for all throat, bron
chial and lung troubles known to med
icine." Miss Anna Ray writes us that after
suffering for live years with bronchitis,
and trying all kinds of medicines with
out relief, Vlnol cured her, and we
have hundreds of just such letters.
We wish every person suffering from
chronic colds, coughs, bronchitis, and
every aged, weak, or convalescent per
son who needs a healing, strengthcreat
ing and blood-making tonic would try
Vlnol on onr guarantee to return the
purchase money if It falls." W. E.
