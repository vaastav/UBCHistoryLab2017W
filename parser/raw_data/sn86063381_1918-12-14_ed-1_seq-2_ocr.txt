HOUSE ON LOYALTY BASIS.
As predicted, W. I. Nolan will be the speaker of the next
house of representatives. This was assured last week when a
majority of the members met in St. Paul at the call of Elmer
Adams of Fergus Falls and pledged themselves to the candi-
dacy of the Hennepin county man. The gathering was pri-
marily for the purpose of organizing against any control by
the Nonpartisan league forces and concluded with the accepV
ance of Mr. Nolan's speakership candidacy, as the first necessary
step in combining against Townley and his bunch. Quite a few
anti-league talks were made and a number of the members
accused of league connections and sympathies gave a vigorous
denial. It was decided to organize the house on a strict loyalty
basis and to tolerate nothing of a bolsheviki nature. The meet-
ing and its action was in measure out of the ordinary as it
represented the settlement of speakership and organization
hostilities' the earliest in years.
Secretary "Newt" Baker was the only member of the presi-
dential cabinet who did not get out on the stump and bawl
for a democratic congress, and it is reported that his r#ason
for exhibiting such remarkable self-effacement was an .ambi-
tion which centers both eyes on 1920. Baker filling himself
with presidential affatus recalls the old fable of the bull-frog
who attempted to match the cow for size. He jes' nachally
blew up.
According to a dispatch from Philadelphia, railroad heads
are against McAdoo's railroad plan. Well, didn't the president
in his message to congress before he sailed say he was unable
to solve the problem and believed it should be solved by con-
gress.? "Mc" essays to do something that his father-in-law
wouldn't tackle. But he has resigned because, he says, he's got
to make a living.
ZQ,
Postmaster General Burleson has just made public a letter
in which Theodore N. Vail, head of the Bell telephone system,
announces an invention that will permit four telephone con-
versations on a single line at the same time. That's nothing.
On some lines hereabouts more than four people talk at the
same time.
Old King Cotton seems to have been the only autocrat who
came out of the war worth a great deal more than when he
went in.

DIME CAP1TAUSTS.
In many large banks, the bond departments are being
reorganized, and among new features contemplated is a
greater abundance of bond issues in the lower denominations.
The innovations arise from the conviction of the directorates
that they will soon have to deal with a new type of investor
the type that has never invested before.
Those Who have been in the habit of putting their savings
into bonds hardly realize how widespread an ignorance has
existed regarding this class of investment. But any Liberty
bond salesman has realized it by this time. He has worked to
exhaustion answering questions which he thought anybody
could answer. "What's a coupon?" "Can you buy groceries
with it?" "Can you sell a bond after you have bought it?"
"Must you take it to Washington to sell it?"
These mysteries are now cleared away, and most people
know that you don't save bond coupons up to a total of eleven
hundred and then trade them in lor premium coffee-pot* or
tobacco-humidors. The Liberty bond campaigns have eluci-
dated these thingsand a few others.
It has taught that the bond department of ,a state or
national bank is widely different from a fraudulent bucket
shop. Banks,of standing cannot afford to offer doubtful secur-
ities for sale they prosper or decline in proportion as their
customers win or lose. One cheated customer could set up a
squeal that would wreck the institution.
The movies have fed us to repletion on Wall street ro-
mances in which some sinister broker always plays a leading
part, and those who get their ideas from movies felt more
inclined than ever to hide their savings in mattresses. But
they can do better now.
According to General DuPont, it will take about two years
to demobilize the American army. There will be plenty of
work for our soldiers to do in France after peace has been
signed, so that there is no fear of a period of unemployment
at home. On the contrary, the work of reconstruction will
mean a tremendous circulation of money and its distribution
into the hands of the masses in America, and the more readily
it is invested by them in sound securities the faster will capital
be available for expanding reconstructive programs Jto more
ambitious dimensions.
Peace will bring with it a greater stimulous to saving
among the wage earners than ever inspired them before. And
here is the keystone of national prosperity.
