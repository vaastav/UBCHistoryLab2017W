THE FLATBUSH SUBWAY.
The discussion oJT the Flatbush sulnvay
scheme l>y a committee of tbe Rapid Transit
Commission and others on Monday was not de
c)siT<\ but It strongly conlirnu'd the pround
takon by I'ark Comuiissionor Kennedy and by
The Tribune in opposition to wholesale npolia
tion of Ocean-aye. and Prospect I'ark. The
question \v:is practicaliy narrowed down to this:
Whether tho subway on Oeean-ave. from Flat
bush-av*. to Parkside-ave. should run close to
the park and have Its sidlnjrs and storage yards
fit the side next the park and partly under the
park, and thus destroy the finest trees on the
avenue and a great number in the park itself,
or should be shifted to the other side of the
avenue, away from the park, and have its t»id-
Jngs and yaru« on that further side, and so do
little dnma?' to the trees on the avenue and
none at all to those hi tbe park.
Tbe Interboron.zh Company, which proposes t >
build the subway, mffits the former plan adopt
t-A, and has worked up some local hentiinent m
Urn favor on the pretence that a change of tiie
plan to the other *ide of the street would have
to be passed upon by tiie Board of KsrJmate an-l
Apportionment and by th« Aldermen, and
would thus cause— as an ill-adrSsed correspond
ent of The Tribnse recently said— perhaps a
ooaple of years' delay in an urgently needed
work. Controller Grxrat on Monday exposed the
Incorrectness of that pretence, and showe.l that
the change would entail bo delay. Driven from
tli&t point the Intsrborougb Coinpuny contented
itself \rith the menacing intimation that if It
•was not permitted to spoliate the park for its
own convenience and pain it might not under
take the building of the subway at all. We trust
thsfnone of our Flatbush friends w:ll be fright
tced by what seems so much like pure 'hluff-
LBfe."
For in persisting in the threatened course tbe
Interboroush Company would come unpleasant
ly near lucurrlng grave— we trust unfounded—
suspicions concerning Its motives. It was ready
enough to build a subway as far as Atlantic
ave U that po'«t it will connect with the Long
Island Railroad, and be able to run through
trains from the subway to Belmont Park and
other suburban places on that railroad. Now !t
wants to continue the tube to Ocean and Park
side ayes. At that^point, it is observed, it will
roach the underground portion of the old
Brighton Beach Itailroad. now operated by the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. It is re
ported* that this latter road is about to Ih?
equipp«l with four tracks and otherwise im
proved. It might be advantageous to the Inter
borough Company to connect its subway with
that road ttt that point and use the latter as a
continuation of the subway down to the ocean.
To do so it would need *o put its sidings and
storage yards under Prospect Park and destroy
the trees on Ocean-aye. If it put them on the
other side of Ocean-aye. it would be far less easy
to make such a connoctian between the two
roads. There are those who suspect that to be
the "nigger in the woodpile," and that.it is the
desire to unite with the Brighton Bon^h road,
and not carry the independent subway any fur
ther than tiiiit i>oint, which makes the Interbor
ough Company so insistent upon the plan which
would inflict irreparable damage on Prospect
Park and Ocean-aye. From the sordid point of
view of railroad dividends that might be a
shrewd scheme. We do not think it will appeal
successfully to an enlightened public spirit.
THE MESSAGE.
The supreme emphasis of the President's mes
sage is placed, as was expected, on the relations
of the government to corporations. Various
phases of this subject are discussed at great
length and with many characteristic expressions
of sociological and moral convictions. From tho
point of view of those who seek in a message
merely a chronicle of progress und .in outline of
specific measures this seems academic and super
fluous. President Roosevelt, however, is not
making merely conventional recommendations.
He evidently feels that he has issues to deal
with profoundly affecting the moral fibre and
the social life of the people, and that the small
est pnrt of his mission is to tell Congress what
bills should in his opinion be passed. He must
also appeal to the people, show them the reason
ableness of what they might otherwise consider
dangerous innovations nnd argue the vexed ques
tions out in their larger aspects. Some of his
suggestions involve. If not novel conceptions of
the function of tho federal government, far
reaching efforts to adapt its instrumentalities to
the new conditions under which, with the evolu
tion of our business life, they must work.
The President wisely lays stress on the fnct
that at the present day much work which was
formerly done by state authorities can no longer
efficiently be performed by them. The consolida
tion and extension of business operations have
made restraints on corporations which extend
only to a state line quite ineffective for the pro
tection not only of the country in general, but
of the citizens of the state supposed to be in con
trol. Consequently, he proposes a policy of lib
eral use of federal powers to regulate what has
long been a legal no man's land of refuge for
corporate abuses with which no authority has
seemed competent to deal. Speaking of corpora
tions, he says :
The laws of the Congress and of the several
states hitherto, as passed upon by the courts,
have resulted more often in showing that the
states have no power in the matter than that
the national government has power: so that
there exists a very unfortunate condition of
things, under which these great corporations
doing an interstate business occupy the position
of subjects without a sovereign, neither any
state government nor the national government
having effective control over them. Our steady
aim should he by legislation, cautiously and
carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered
in. to assert the sovereignty of the national gov
ernment by affirmative action.
This sovereignty the President would exercise
to r.-M-rain trusts, to prevent insurance abases
and to secure the operation of common carriers
in ■ manner fair to all., and he points out that
the exercise of this sovereignty is not essentially
an innovation, but merely a restoration of ef
fective authority over matters which have es
caped from restraint with changed conditions.
On the subject of rato regulation ho is not con
tent with sweeping prohibitions. He wants af
firmative legislation, fin.l would be glad to dis
criminate between good and bad combinations.
This would be desirable, for undoubtedly the
public would in some cases be served by reason
able co-operation, which is now forbidden: but
such a scheme would be almost impossible of
enforcement, lie outlines a plan for the fixing
of rates on complaint and after n hearing by the
present or n reorganized Interstate Commerce
dssion with power to put its findings into
effect He agrees with Attorney General Moody
that a rate granted as a discriminating favor
might well be enforced for the benefit of the
aiction by the government aennnst shippers taking
rebates as a measuro to protect railroads from
blackmail. The present inadequate laws penalize
honest railroad men by failing to protect them
from rivals who violate the law, and almost
force them to discriminate in t-pite of them
selves. The President discusses the rate ques
tion with moderation, and makes it clear that
he is not unfriendly to the railroads, but seeks a
measure of regulation to cure 6uch abuses as
Inevitably create a demand for government own
ership, to which he is firmly opposed. He favors
better safety appliances and the limitation of
hours of railway labor on interstate commerce
liu<«: and. on the other hand, emphatically dis
approves the taking away from the courts of the
power of injunction in labor disputes.
The President makes no recommendation for
tariff revisiou. but notes that changes ran come
only threogb general agreement among citizens
of all sections, and not ut the demand of any
one locality. He advise* economy and makes
practical suggestions to that end. Last year's
recommendation of publicity for federal elec
tion expenditures is renewed and supplemented
by a call for the prohibition of corporate contri
butions. A large number of other topics are in-
Fjiiringly discussed. The message is long, but it
will repay tlie careful study of every intelligent
citizen. It is full of suggestions of vital Inter
est. Some of Its proposals are certain to excite
controversy, but nobody can honestly say of any
one of them that it is not the straightforward
attempt of ■ right thinking mnn to get down to
l?je essential elements of a problem nnd solve it
witli tbe general welfare as his sole aim.
IBROAD
The time it- h mg : iast \\ hen an Ame.ricnu euites
man could scornfully demand, "What do we care
for 'abroad":' To-d;iy there is no part of a re
view of American interests which commands
more earnest and appreciative attention than
that which deal.s with the foreign rchtlions of
this country. That is true whether such dealing
be in gi-ucrul or in particular. At the present
time much might be Bald about sonic Specific de
tails of our foreign affairs, but it will be DO less
profitable to address attention to what the Presi
dent in his message says concerning their gen
eral principles, espeeiully seeing how largely and
directly aoch principles have been and are in
volved in current controversies and processes.
Devotion to peace is. as it has been from the
first, conspicnoaß among those principles, and
the President's active and successful purt in
bringing al«»ut a second peace conjgraas at The
Hague entitles him to write as be does. In a
spirit of authoritative initiative. Some of his
npt sentences on the subject are worthy to be in
scribed on the atoarpoata nnd lintels for everlast
ing inspiration and reminder, and it is to be
hoped that they will at least be taken consider
ately to heart hy those who have exploited his
remark about the "big stick" with co inu<*h af
fected apprehension. Our aim, says the Preel
NEW- YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER^ 6^1905.
deut, is righteousness ; a better aim than pen<e, f
because righteousness is greater than peace and
comprises it, while peace might not comprise (
righteousness. There are, lie reminds us, deuia- :
gognes of peace, just as there are demagogues of j
v»-ar, and it may be that in some oases they ate .
as mischievous. Such are they who shrilly de
claim that all wars are equally wicked and sav
age, and who denounce all efforts toward peace
which do not' Involve the immediate disarma
ment of all nations and unhesitating submission
of every conceivable question to alien arbitra
tion. Theirs is what the Txesklent well de
scribes ns "a folly, which, in striving to achieve
"the impossible, would render it hopeless to
strive to achieve the practical." He sees the
evil of their demagogism and, while he denounces
it, he himself suggests a greater progress on the
true path than they have clamored fur in a
false direction when he wisely says that disarm
ament is not. after all, of prime Importance, be
cause "there is more need to get rid of the causes
of war than of the implements of war."
In getting rid of the causes of war. then, the
President lays suitable stress upon the Monroe
Doctrine "as it has been and is being gradually
"developed by this nation and accepted by other
"nations." In that qualifying clause there is a
valuable reminder. The Monroe Doctrine has
Indeed been and is being, and in future doubt-^
less will further be, developed by this nation.*
That is inevitable, because, as the President says,
when we announce such a policy we commit our
selves "to its consequences, and those conse
quences change from time to time; wherefore
our application of the policy must be adapted
and readaptcd to changing conditions. That has
notably been the case with the Monroe Doctrine,
But it is equally notable and equally true that,
as the President suggests, acceptance of the doc
trine by other nations has proceeded pan passu
with our own development of it. Time was,
within some present memories, when a leading
European Miuisier of Stale, speaking for his sov
ereign, did not hesitate to say bluntly that his
government did not recognize the Monroe Doc
trine as international law. It may not be ko
recognized to-day; but at least foreign govern
ments are not now treating it so cavalierly, but
are conducting their affairs with the American
states with a scrupulous regard for that doctrine
in all its latter day development and expansion.
Nor is tJhis to be wondered at when we con
eider the spirit in which the President declares
the doctrine must be maintained. Briefly, it is
to afford us no aggrandisement at the expense
of our neighbors and is to be no cloak for terri
torial aggression ; neither is it to be a shield for
evildoers among the nations, to exempt them
from a just penalty; nor. finally, is it to invest
us with authority without a gommensurate re
sponsibility. The case of Santo Domingo is cited
as much in point. Had it not been for the Mon
roe Doctrine that republic might some time ago
have been wiped out of existence to satisfy the
demands of creditors, some of whom arc almost
unquestionably dishonest. The United States,
under the Monroe Doctrine, forbids such spolia
tion. Instead, however, of stopping there like a
dog in a manger, this country "takes up the
white man's burden" in response to the Domini
can appeal and gives the insular republic moral
and administrative aid, so as to assure the just
payment of all honest creditors us well as to
thwart the designs of the dishonest It is a fine
tribute to American aid to thai country that
while our collectors at Dominican custom houses
are holding 55 per cent of receipts for the public
creditors und are giving only 4.", per cent to tho
Dominican government, that 45 per cent amounts
to more than the w bole revenue did under native
administration! With such achievements in .ap
plication as an object lesson there need be no
worrvui <T about recognition of iho Monroe Doc
trine in intei*n;iiioii;ii jaw .
The same sane and just attitude is assumed by
the Presideni toward our lately vexatious rela
tions with China. He stands for the "open
dour."' lie maintains our riu'lit to enforce re
strictive immigration laws. "But we cannot ex
pect to receive equity unless we do equity." The
Chinese would have the same righi to enforce
restrictive laws in like circumstances againsi our
people: and the President see-; plainly. :u:«i does
not hesitate to say frankly, that the recent boy
cott against American goods in china was chiefly
provoked by the harshness of our l-.ws and iho
lack of courtesy and justice in their administra
tion toward Chinese students, travellers and
business men. who should not properly bo sub
grted to any restrictions in entering this eoun
i-o seek not men but the greater
and higher iiims of righteousness and justice;
to make our responsibility commensurate with
our authority, hum to do to others— to black and
brown and yellow men as well :>s to white as
we desire them to do to us are th-> cardinal
points of the policy which the President's mes
sage outlines and advocates In our relations with
the world abroad. There could be none more
reasonable and none more honorable and profit
able for tiiis nation to pursue.
•'LEST WE FORGET."
Senator Armstrong and Mr. Hughes, in their
speeches at the University of Rochester dinner
on Monday night, both dwelt upon a pbase of
the insurance Investigation which ii behooves
the people not to forget, ii' the real benefit which
the community can gain from these revelations
is to be secured. These men have worked to
gether to expose In all its enormity a buge sys
tem of evil doing which h:is wrecked some high
reputations and made the general public ready
to believe ill of any man. The one with stern,
unbending faithfulness, regardless of friend or
foe, has done his duty of pursuing the investiga
tion wherever any tight on the conditions need
in"- cure was to be found. The other, with a
marvellous grasp of business and keenness of
insight, has proceeded to turn on the light Both
stand up and discuss the moral significance of
•what they have found in a fashion that is an
example to the whole community. If they can
apeak with moderation and discrimination of tho
wrongs discovered, others should be able io. If
they can search their own hearts and find ;.i
personal moral tonic In this record of weakness
and greed, nobody else should be above asking
what lesson it has for him.
li is the fashion to-day for the moral indigna
tion of the public and the newspapers to work
Itself off in denunciation of those Identified with
insurance abuses as lepers, having nothing in
common with their fellows. Men whose in<!is
cretion and carelessness might properly subject
them to » sharp reprimand are pictured :;s deep
dyed villains on the strength of other things,
a perfect knowledge of which would not Lave
prevented their being balled everywhere with
honor a little while ago. The conscien< f men
is arotispil to blame what was not formerly
blamed in others, is it also aroused to such self
exiiniiiiatioii as that revealed by Senator Arm
strong? He asks:
wh\n is so credulous as to believe thai the
revelations are peculiar to the insurance busi
l'i. w. ]..,t know the moral conscience ol
the people has been checked? Tt Is time we
took an Inventory <■( our business practices t
have sal <ia> after day before the witnesses
wondering who among the committee or iinv
where among the public would have done dif
ferently. Yov '-'-in lose the besl lesson of this
investigation if you join with the throng who
point at men i-'. - the moment in the cloud in
stead of turning to see if they themselves are
not at fp.ult.
That is the Important lesson to be learned.
The Armstrong committee win make Its report
dealing \\ ith Insurance abuses, and there is
every prospect that the legislature will adopt its
recommendations guardms against, so far hs
hr.v can guard againsi, the repetition of these
evils. But the committee cannot reform sim
ilar abuses in other corporations or change the
spirit of the business community which, uu-
Changed, is sure to produce n new crop of
wrongs. That can only be done by each man
taking thought for himself. Most of the men
discredited by the investigation were honest
men in their own eyes, and actually a* honest
as most of their business associate*. Thoy in
herited a bad system; they handled money In
such vast sums that they did not realize their
trusteeship for individual dollars; they accepted
that standard of business dealings which holds
it fair to deceive the (government and necessary
to control lawmakers by whatever instrument
will servo the purpose without being too nice.
All this was wrong, but how many other honor
able men, railroad and bank presidents, hnve
the same notions of practical business? How
many everyday citizens were ignorant that
such things were done and concerned enough
to refuse to fawn before rich men who prospered
by the Avrong, or to support legislators who be
trayed their trust? As Senator Armstrong said,
the lawmakers are in general fair specimens of
tiie people. And, as Mr. Hughes said :
What w« noed is a revival of the sense of
honor. We want to hear less of the man who
began poor 'and amassed riches and more about
tho man who lived unsullied, though he died
poor. We want a change in the burden of
proof. L<et every man who has amassed wealth
or pained office be ready to show a clear balance
Sheet and if he ffot it. answer to: "Where did
he get it?"
That "baptism of self-respect" for which Mr.
Hughes pleaded will come to the community
only with its own conviction of sin and with
the determination of individuals not to forget
their own character in eagerness to condemn the
failings of others.
The Hon. John Sharp Williams's reference to
the "kids in the majority" in Congress naturally
suggests that in the present state of the De
mocracy even a "kid" can beat a Democratic
veteran in the Congressional race.
Lerr.nos, seized by the powers tn put pressure
on the Sultan, is celebrated in legend as the
island on which Vulcan fell when kicked off
Olympus by Jupiter. The powers seem to be con
templating a kick that eventually may land the
Sultan on the Asian side of the Bosporus.
Lemnos, commanding the Dardanelles", would be
a good point of projection.
Speaker Cannon's reference, in his speech ac
cepting the Speakership. to the House as "the
"only place where the voice of the people, wlth
"out intervening machinery, may express itself"
was a hit at bossism, or rather £t the shade of
bossism. But at present tiie people are express
ing their opinions everywhere on all subjects
without regard to "intervening machinery."
Dr. Rush Rhces, president of the University
of Rochester, strikes the right note on the foot
ball question in saying that those who play it
"will have to play it as gentlemen or the game
will have to go."
There is one new man in Congress who need
not fear Leader Williams's gibes at "kids." He
is Representative Barchfeld, of Pittsburgh who
measures six feet five from the floor of the
House of Representatives toward the skylight.
When he rises the Speaker will have no excuse
for pretending not to see him.
The Rev. George C. Richmond, of St. John's
Episcopal Church, Stamford. Conn., says, with
little credit to himself, that "the corporation offl
"cer who takes more than $25,000 a year salary
"Is a thief." Somehow this definition recalls a
saying of Aiiatole France: "It is only from a
"barrel or from a shop that one may dominate
"the grandeurs of this world."
The Republicans in the House have overflowed
"the Cherokee strip" and even part of the his
toric seats of the Democracy. The panorama of
the House gives a vivid realization of a vanish
ing party.

village to Brecon, and bad with him a 6trong
wooden box tille.3 with besry theological books.
At Shrewsbury the detectives, who were on the
lookout for explosive machines and the like, sus
pected this heavy box. and word was fernt on to
Brecon. When the young- minister stepped out of
the train he was astonished to find a sergeant and
several constables awaiting him. "I think you
have a box with you." said the sergeant. "Quite
right," Miid the preacher, who began to scent a
jok«. Out came the box, a-id its weight excited
fresh suspicion about its contents. '•This ;s; s your
box?" "Yes." "it contains ammunition?" "It
does." "Very well, consider yourself In charge
Open the box." The company stood away while
the lii was cautiously wrenched off. When the ser
geanl found it contained nothing more explosive
than Adam Clarke's "Theology" ho expressed his
indignation freely to t'.ie minister. All that he got
back was the soft answer: "Why. bless my soul,
man, you asked if the box contained ammunition.
Thru is my ammunition. I'm a Methodist parson,
and that's what I shoot with."
