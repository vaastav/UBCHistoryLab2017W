PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow eiliten of the Senate
mud House of Reprtientatives :
- Throughout lb year, sine, oar Ut meet log, the
country has been eminently proiperoai In all Itt miti
rial Interests, The general health ha been excellent,
our harvests have been abundant, and plenty imilei
throughout the land. Oar commerce and manufactures
have been protecoted with energy and industry, and
km Yielded lair and ample returns. In short, no na
tion in the tide of time has ever presented a spectacle of
greiter material prosperity than we have done until
within a very recent period.
Why it it, then, that discontent now so extensively
preraJlt, and the Union of tbe States, which ii the
eonrce of all theie blessings, it threatened with destruc
tion 1 The long-continued and Intemperate interference
of the Northern people with tbe question or slavery in
the Southern Btatea hat at length produced its natural ,
effec'a. The different sections of tbe I uion re now ar- ;
rayed against each other, and the time has arrived, so
much dreaded by the Father of his Country, when hos
I.HII. M:
tile geographical parties have Keen lormca.
foreseen, and often forewarned my countrymen of the
now Impending daogtr. This does rot proceed solely
from the claim on th? part of Oongrers or the Territorial
Legislatures to exclude slavery from the Territories, nor ,
from the efforts of different States to def-at the execu
tion of the fugitive slave law. All or any of these evils
might have been endured by tbe South without danger to
the Union, (as othert have been,) in the hope that time
and reflection might apply the lemedy. The immediate
peril arise not to muca from these causes at from the
tact that the Incessant and violent agitation of tbe sla
very question throughout the North for the last quarter
of a century, hat at length produced ita malign influence
on the slaves, and Inspired them with vague notions of
freedom. Hence a tense of security so longer exists
. around the faml'y altar. This feeling of peace at horn
hat given place to apprehensions of servile insurrection.
Many a matron throughout the South retires at night In
dread of what may befall herself and her children before
the morning. Should this apprehension of domestio
danger, whether real or imaginary, extend and intensify
itself until It shall pervade the masses of the Southern
people, then disunion will become inevitable. Self-preservation
is the first law of nature, and his been im
planted in the heart of man by hit Creator for the wisest
purpose; and no political union, however fraught with
blessings and benefits la all other respects, can long con
tinue, if the necessary consequence bo to render the
hornet and the firesides of nearly half the parties to it
habitually and hopelessly insecure. Sooner or lattr
the bo:ids of such a Union mutt be severed. It is my
conviction that this fatal period has not yet arrived ; and
my prayer to God it that lie would preserve the Consti
tntion and the Union throughout all generations.
Bat letui take warning in time, and remove the cause ;
ofdanger. It cannot be denied that, for fiveand twenty j
years, the agitation at the North against slavery in tne .
. eoutn nae oeen incessant, au F.vw..
and inflammatory appeals, were circulated extensively j

ton, "to ttimuiate tnem to insurrection, ana proauceau
the horrors of a servile war." This agitation hat ever
tinea been continued by the public press, by the proceed
ings of State and county conventions, and by abolition
sermons and lectures The time of Congress has been
occupied in violent speeches on this never-erding sub
ject; and appeals in pamphlet and other forms, endorsed
by distinguished names, have been tent forth from this
central point, and spread broad oast over the Union.
How easy would It be for the American people to settle
tha slavery question forever, and to restore peace and
harmony to this distracted coutry.
They, and they alone, can do it. All that is necessary
to accomplish tha object, and all for which the slave
States have ever contended, is to be let alone, and per
mitted to manage their domestio institutions in their
own way As sovereign States, they, and they alone, are
responsible before God and the world for the slavery ex
latlng among them. For this, the people of the North
are not more responsible, and. have no more right to in-
terrere, man wiuijsimiiar institutions in Kussia or in Bra-
.. .
"ir.-.. , to.Tu ..i. T. . C . :
fess I still greatly rely. . Without their aid it is beyond
th nnwAV nf an President, no matter what mo v hn h:a
own political proclivities, to restore peace and harmony
among the States. Wisely limited and restrained as is
his powor, node r our Constitution and laws, he alone can
accomplish but little, for good or for evil, on such a mo
mentous Question
And tbis brings me to observe that the election of any
one of our fellow-citizens to. the oxtice of President does
not of itself afford just oaus for ' dissolving the Union.
This is more especially true if hiselection has been eflect
ed by a mere plurality, and not a rcajoritr, of the peo
ple, and has resulted from transient and temporary
causes, which msy probably never again occur. In or
der to justify a resort to revolutionary resistance, the
Federal Government mast be guilty of ''a deliberate, pal
pable, and dangerous exercise" of powers not granted by
the Constitution. The late presidential election, how
ever, has been held in strict conformtty with its express
provitiont. slow, then, can the result justify a revolu
tion to destroy this very Constitution? Reason, justice.
a regard for the Corstitution, all require that we shall
wait for some overt and dangerous acton the part of the
Presidentelect before resorting to such a remedy.
It Is said, however that the antecedents of the Presi
dent elect have been sufficient to justify the fears of the
South that he will attempt to invade their constitutional
rights. But are such apprehensions of contingent dan
ger in the future sufficient to justify tbe immediate des
truction of the noblest system of government ever de
vised by mortals? From the very nature of his office,
and its high responsibilities, he must necessarily be con
servative. The stern duty of administring the vast and
complicated concerns t this Government affords in it
self a guarantee that he will not attempt any violation of
a clear constitutional right. After all, he is no more
than the chief oxecntive officer of the Government. His
province is not to make, but to execute, the laws; and
it is a remarkable fact In cur history, that not
withstanding the repeated efforts of the anti-slavery par
ty, no single act has ever passed Congress, unless we
may possibly except the Missouri Compromise imparing,
in tbe slightest degree, the lights of the South to their
property In slaves. And it may also be observed, judg
ing from present Indications, that no probability ex
ists of the passage of such an act, by a majority of both
Bouses, either in the present or the next congress. Surely
under these circumstances, we ought to be restrained
from present action by the precept of Bim who spake as
never man spoke, that "efficient unto the day is the
evil thereof." The dsy of evil may never come, unless
we shall rashly bring it upon ourselves.
It is alleged as one cause for immediate secession that
the Sou them States are denied equal rights with the other
States in the common Territories. But by what authority
are these denied? Not by Congress, which hae never
passed, and I believe never will pass, any act to exclude
slavery from these Territories; and certainly not by the
e - ,,, K.Bniint. ... . - --- -v '--

and hold them there under the protection of the Consti
tution. Bo far, then, as Congress Is concerned, the objection is
not to anything they have already done, bnt to what
they may do hereafter. It will surely be aimitted that
this apprehension of future danger is no goad reason for
an Immediate dissolution of the Union. It is true that
the territorial legislature of Kansas, on the 23d of Febru
ary, 18130, passed in great baste an act, over the veto of
the governor, declaring that slavery "is, and shall be
forever prohibited in thia Territory." Such an act, how
ever plainly violating the rights of property secured by
the Constitution, will surely be declared void by the ju
dioiary whenever it shall be presented in a legal fcrm.
Only three daysafter my inauguration the Supreme
Court of the United States solemnly adjudged that this
power did not exist in a territorial legislature. Yet
such has been tne racuous temper or tne times that the
correctness of this decision lias been extensively impugn
ed before the people, end the question has given rise to
angry political conflicts throughout the country. Those
who have appealed from this judgment of our hlihfRt
cocsli utional tribunal to popular assemblies would, if
iney couiu, in vesta nmiuiiai legislature wiin power to
annul the sacred rights of property. This power
Congress is expressly forbidden by the Federal Constitu
tion to exercise. livery State legislature in the Union
is forbidden by its own constitution to exercise i'. It
cannot be exercised in any State except by the people in
their highest sovereign capacity when framing or amend
tag their State constitution. In like manner, it can only
be exercised by the people of a Territory represented in
s convention of delegates for the purpose of framing a
constitution preparatory to admission as a S ate into the
Union. Then, and not until then, are they invested
With power to dee'de the question whelher slavery shall
or shall not exist within their limits. This is an act of
sovereign authority, and not of tuboidinate territorial
legislation. Where it otherwise, then indeed would the
quality of the States in the Territories be destroj ed, and
the! rights of prcperty in slaves would denemt. .
upon toe guruiv. m.vvi-u,iiuL, out upon the
SHiuijjg majormca v. u u , vapuua.uic icrruoiiai legisla
ture. Such a dootrine, from its intrinsic unsoundness
cannot leng ltnuecce any consumable portion of our
people, mucn less can it anoru a goou reason for a dis
solution of the Union.
The most pa'pable violations of (constitut'onal duly
which have yet been committed consist in the acts of
different Btaie legislatures to oeicat tne execution of the
fugitive slave law. It ought to be resembered however
that for these acts, neither Congress nor any President
can justly be held responsible. Having been passed in
violation of the Federal Constitution, they are therefore
, null and void. All the courts, both State and national
before whom the question has arisen, have from the be
ginning declared the fugitive slave law to be constitu
tional. Tbe single exception Is that cf a State court in
Wisconsin; and this has not only been reversed by the
DTfitiev annallata trihnnal. hui haimpt with .....
sal reprobation that there can be no danger from it as a
precedent. The validity of this law has been established
over and over again by the Supreme Court of the United

slaves who escape from service in one State to another
shall be "delivered up" to their masters. Without tbis

law has been carried into execution in every contested
case since the commencement of the present administra
tion; though often it is to be regretted, with great loss
and inconvesience to the master, and with considerable
nuense to the government. Let us trust that the State
legislatures will repeal their unconstitutional and obnox
ious enactments. Unless this shall be done without un

having first used all peaceful and constitutional means to
obtain redress, would be justified io revolutionary resist
ance to the Government of tbe Union
I have purposely oonflne i my remarlcs to revolution
ary resistance, because it has been claimed within the
last few years that any EUte, whenever this shall be its
sovereign will and pleasure, may aecede from the Union,
in accordance with the Constitution, and without any
violation of the constitutional rights of the other members
of the Confederacy. That as each became parties to the
Union by the vote of ita own people assembled in Con
vention, so any one of them may retire from the Union
l . ;i.......w. ,.... .h . ..invention.
In order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy
it must be on the principle that the Federal Government
: i..-...: i-:.i.. r DMM. tone dissolved
..i 1,.. nM A Mntntctinff parties. If
this be to, the Confederacy is a rope of sand, to be pene.
trated and dissolved by the first adverse wave of public
opinion in any of the States. In this i manner our thirty
... f,m.ives into as many petty.
jarring, and hostile republics, each one retiring from the
iai .a.n.naihiiiv. whenever anv sudden ex-
citement might impel them to such !
process a Union might be entirely broken into fragments
;n few weeks. which cost our forefatheia many yeara or.
toil, privation, and blood to establish.
Such a principle is wholly inconsistent with tbe his
tory as well as the character of the Federal Constitution.
. . with the orreatest deliberation and
care It was submitted to conventions of tbe people of
the several States for ratification. Its provisions were
discussed at kngth in theie bodies, composed of the first

there was noloun tation tor such apprehensions. In
that mighty straggle between the first intellects of this
or any other country, it never occurred to any individual.
either amoni itt opponents or advocatos. to assert, or
even to intimate, tntt tneir euorts were all vain labor.
because the morosut that any 8tate felt herself aggrieved
she might secede from the Union. What a crushing ar
gument would this have proved against those who
dreaded that the rights of the States would be endan
gered by the Constitution. The truth is, that it was not
until many yeara after the origin of the Federal Govern
ment that such a proposition was first advanced. It was
then met and refuted by the conclusive arguments of
u?nerai Ja:kson. who in his message or lotn January,
lfjj, transmitting the nuiuryiicir ordinance of tsoutn Car
olina ta Congress, employs the following language :
"The right of the people of a single State to absolve
themselves at will, and without the consent of the other
States, from their most solemn obligations, and hazard
the liberty and happiness of the millions composing this
Union, cannot be acknowledged. Such authority is ba
lieved to be utterly repugnant both to the principle!
upon which the General Government is constituted and
to the objects which it was expressly formed to attain."
It is not cr, t-nded that anv clause in the Constitution
gives countenance to such a theory. It is altogether
founded nnon inference, not from anv lanscuage contun-
ed in the instrument itself, but from the sovereign char
racter of the several States by which it wat raffled. But
is it beyond the power of a State, like an individual, to
yield a portion of its sovereign rights to secure the re
mainder? In the language of Mr. Blalison, who has
h'n lulled the father of the Constitution: "Itwas form
ed by the States that is by the people in each of the
Rut, ontintr in their hteheat sovereign capacity: and
formed consequently 1 y the same authority which formed
t. Iltll.tl ntitntiona '
. th Qovernoient of theUnited States, created
by the ConsUtuti0n less a Government in the strict sense
o( tne term within the sphere of its powers, than tne

i things; and, like them, it hat at command a physical
force for executing the powers committed to it."
Itwas intended to be perpetual, and not to be annulled
at the pleasure of anv one of the contracting parties.
The old articles of confederation were entitled "Articles
of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the
Statts," and by the 13th article it is expressly declared
that "the articles of tbis confederation snail rjeinvioia
blv observed bv everv State, and the Union shall be per
petual." The preamble to the Constitution of the United
States, having express reference to the articles of Con
federation, recites that it was established "in order to
form a more perfect union." And yet it is eontended
that this "more perfect union" does not include the es
sential attribute of oerretnitv.

support armies and navies, and to conclude treaties with
foreign governments, it is invesicu whu uic power to
coin money, and to regulate the value thereof, and to
regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the
aeveral States. It is not necessary to enumerate the
other high powers which have been conferied upon th'
Federal Government, In order to carry the enumerated
powers into effect, Congress possesses the exclusive right
to lay and collect duties on imports, and in commonwilh
the States to lay and collect all other taxes.
But the Constitution has not only conferred these high
powers upon Congress, but it has adopted effectual means
to restrain tne states irom lnienering witn tneir exeicise
For that purpose it has. in strong prohibitory language.
expressly declared that "no State shall enter into any
treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque
and Reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make
anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of
debts, pass any bill of attainder, ex post fa.to law, or
law impairing the obligation of contracts." Moreover,
"without the consent of Congress, no Stats shall lay
any imposts or duties on any imports or exports, except
what may be absolutely rnecessary for executing its in
spection laws;" and.if they exceed this amount, the ex
cels shall belong to the United States.
And "no State shall, without the consent of Congress,
lay any duty of tonnage; keep troops, or ships of war, in
time of peace; enter into any agreement or conpactwith
another State, or with a foreign power; or engage in
war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent dan
ger as will not admit of delay ."
In order still further to secure the'uninterrupted exer
cise of these h'gh powers against State interposition, it
isprovided "that this Corstitution and the laws of the
United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof;
and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the
authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law
of the land;and the judges in every State shall be bound
thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any State
to the contrary notwithstanding-"
The solemn Bare tion of religionhas been superadded to
tha obligations of official duty, and all senators and rep
resentatives of the United Statej, all members of State
legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, "both
of the Unite j States and of the several States, shall be
bound by ca'.h or amrmation to support tnis Constitu
tion." In order tocarry into effect these powers, the Constitu
tion has established a perfect Government in all its forms,
Legislative, Executive, and Judicial; and this Govern
ment, to the extent of its powers, acts directly upon the
individual citizens cf every State, and executes its own
decrees by the agency of its own officers. In this respect
it differs entirely Irom the Government under the old
Confederation, which was confined to making requisi
tions on the States in their sovereign character. This
I ieil it in tne aiscretion oi eacn wueiner to ooey or to re-
fa. ften Alined to comply with such requi-
HUoV I thus became necessary, ?or the purpose1 of
j left it in the discretion of each whether to obey or to re-
removing this barrier, and "in order to form a more per
feet Union," to establish 'a Government which could act
dhectly upon the people, and executeits own lawswith
out the intermediate agency of the States. This has
been accomplished by the Constitution of the United
States.
In short, the Government created by the Constitution,
and deriving its authority trom the sovereign people of
each of the several Statxs, has precisely the same right
to exercise its power over tbe people of all these States,
in the enumerated cases, that each one of them possesses
over subjects not delegated to the'United States, but "re
served to the States respectively, or to the people."
To the extent of the delegated powers the Constitution
of the United States is as much a part of the constitution
of each State, and iB as binding upon its people as though
it had been textually inserted therein.
This Government, therefore, is a great and powerful
Government, invested with ail the attributes of sovereign
ty over the special subjects to which its authority extends.
Its framers never intended to implant in its bosom the
seeds of its own destruction, nor were they at its creation
guilty of the absurdity of providing for its own dissolu
tion. It was not intended by its framers to be the base
less fabric of a vision which at the touch of the enchanter
would vanish into thin air, but a substantial and mighty
fabric capable of resisting the slow decay of time and of
defying the storms of ages. Indeed, well may thejeulons
patriots of ithat day have indulged fears that a govern
ment of such high powers might violate the reserved
rights cf the States, and wisely did they adopt the rule of
a strict construction of these powers to prevent the
danger) But they did not fear, nor had they any reason
to imagine, that the Constitution would ever be so in
terpreted as to enable any Btats, by her own act, and
without the consent of her sister States, to discharge
her people from all or any of their Federal obligations.
It my be asked, then, are the people of the States
without redress against the tyranny and oppression of
the Federal Government V By no means. The right of
resistance on the part of the governed against tbe op
pression of their governments cannot be denied. It ex
ists independently of all constitutions, and has been ex
ercised at all periods of the world's history. Under
old governments have been destroyed, and new ones
have taken their place. It is embodied in strong and
express language in our own declaration of Indepen
dence. But Ihe distinction must ever be observed, that
this is revolution against an established Government, and
not a voluntary secession from it by virtue of an inhe
rent constitutional right. In short, let us look the dan
ger fairly in the face : Secession is neither more nor less
than revolution It may or may not be a justifiable
revolution, but still it is revolution.
What, in the meantime, is the responsibility and true
position of the Executive I lie is bound by solemn oath
before God and the country "to take care that the laws
be faithfully executed," and from this obligation he can
not be absolved by any human power. But what if the
performance of this duty, in whole or in part, has been
lenuereu iiupraonwiuic vj cihim wmiu uc vuuiu
have exercised no control 7 Such, at the present moment,
is the case throughout the Btate of South Carolina, so far
at the laws of the United states to secure the administra
tion of justice bv means of the Federal Judiciary are
concerned. All tbe Federal officers within its limits,
through whose agency alone these laws can be carried
into execution, have already resigned. We no longer
have a district j udge, a aistrict attorney, or a marsnai, in
South Carolina. In fact, the whole machinery of the
Federal Government, necessary for the distribution of
remedial justice among the people, has been demolished;
and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace it.
Tbe only acts of Congress on the statute-book, bearing
upon this subject, are those of the 9Rth February, 171)5,
and 3d Marcb, xnese authorize tne President, af
ter be shall have aaeertained that tbe marshal with his
posse eomitatue it unable to execute civil or criminal
process in any particular case, to can rortn tne militia
and employ the army and navy to aid him in performing
tbis service, having first by Proclamation commanded
the insurgents to "disperse and retire peaceably to their
rAaniiva abides, within a limited time." This dutv
cannot by possibility be performed in a State where no
judicial authority exists to issue process, and where
there is no marshal to execute it, and where, even if there
were tuch an officer, the entire population would consti
tute one solid combination to resist him .
Tha hare enumeration of theso provisions proves how
inadequate they are without further legislation to over
come a united opposition in a single State, not to speak
of other States who may place themselves in a similar at
titude. Congress alone has power to decide whether
Lthe present laws can or cannot be amended so as to carry
out more euectuauy hibwujw,i ,uo uvuiumuuji.
The same Insuperable obstacles do not lie in the way
of executing the laws for the collection of the customs.
The revenue still continues to ce collected, as neretorore,
attheeostom-house in Charleston; and should the col
lector nnfortuately resign, a successor may be appointed
to perform this duty.
Thcnin retrard to the propertyof the United States in I the
South Carolina, litis has been purchased for a fair
equivalent, -by the content of the Legislsture of the will
State,' -"lor iue creunuu ui iww, magazines, arsenals,
&o -. and over these the authority "to exercise exclusive
legislation" Has been expressly granted by the Constitu
tion to Congress. It is not believed thAt anv attempt
will be made to exbell the United States from this rrop-
rtj fy .u.v, ,u .uis suuuiu prove to oe mistascn,
the officer in command of the forts has received nnlnra to
act strictly on the defensive. In such a contingercy, the
responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest
upon the heads of the assailants.
Apartrrom the execution of tha laws, so far as thismav
be practicable, the Executive has no authority to decide
wnat snail oe tne relations netween tne leueral govern
ment and South Carolina. He has been invested with
no such discretion He possesses no power to change
the relations heretofore existing between them- much
less to acknowledge the Independence of that State.
This would be to invest a mere Executive officer with
tne power ox recognizing me dissolution of the Confeder
acy among our thirty-three sovereign States. It bears
no resemblance to the recognition of a foreign lie facto
government, involving no tuch responsibility. Any at
tempt to uo tuia wouia, on nis part, be a naked act ot
usurpation. It is therefore, my duty to submit to Con
gress tne wnoie question in all its bearings. The course
of event! it to rapidly battening lorward. that the emer
gency may toon arise, when you may be called upon to
deoide the mementous question whether you possess the
power, oy torce oi arms, to compel a state to remain in
tha Union. I should feet myself recreant to my duty
were I not toexpiess an opinion on this Important
subject.
Tbe question fairly stated is: Has tbe Constitution
delegated to Congress the power to coerce a State into
submission which is attempting to withdraw or has ac
tually itltdrawo f rem the Confederacy? If answered
in the offirmative, it must be en the principle that tha
power has been conferred upon Congress to declare and
to make war against a state. Alter mucn serious renec
tion 1 have arrived at the conclusion that no such power
has been delegated to Congress or to any other depart
mentof the Federal Government. It is manifest, upon
an inspection of the Constitution, that this is not among
the specific and enumerated powers granted to Congress;
and it is equally apparent that ita exercise is not "neces
sary and proper for carrying Into execution" any one of
these powers, bo far from this poster having been dele
gated to Congress, it was expressly refused by the con
vention which framed the Constitution.
It appears, from the proceedings of that body, that on
the 31st May, 1787, the clause "auAorigina an exer
tion of th force of the whole against a delinquent
State came up for consideration. Mr. Madison op
posed it in a brief but powerful speech, from which I
shtll extract but a single sentence. He observed: "Ihe
use oi rorce against a state wouia loot- more nee a dec
laration of war than an irfliction of punishment; and
would probably le considered by the party attacked as a
dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might
be bound." Upon his motion the clause was unanimous
ly postponed, and was never I believe again presented.
Sjon afterwaids. on the 8th June, 1787, when inciden
tally adveiting to the subject, he said: "Any Govern
ment for the United States, formed on the supposed prac
ticability of using lorce against tne unconstitutional pro
ceedings of the States, would prove as visionary and fal
lacious as the government of Congress," evidently
meaning the then existing Congress of the old Confede
ration. Wilhoutdescendingto particulars, it may b? safely as
serted, that the power to make war against a State is at
variance with the whole spirit and intent of thi Constitu
tion. Suppose such a war snouid result in tbe conquest
of a State, bow are we to govern it afterwards? Shall
we hold it as a province, and govern it by despotic pow
er? Iu the nature of things we could not, by physical
force, control the will of the people, and compel them to
elect senators and representatives to Congress, and to
perform all the other duties dependig upon their own vo
lition, and required from the free citizens of a free State
as a oonstitaent member of the Confederacy.
Bat, if we possessed this power, would it be wife to ex
ercise it under existing circumstances? The object would
doubtless be to preserve the Unioni War would not on
ly present the most effectual means of destroying It; but
would banish all hope of its peaceable reoonstruction.
Besides, in the fraternal conflict a vast amoant of blood
and treasure would be expended, rendering. future recon
dilation between the States impossible. In the mean
time, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and
privations of the people during its existence?
The fact is, that our Union rests upon public opinion,
and can never be cemented by the blood of its citizens
shed in civil war. If it cannot live in the affections of
ihe people, it must one day perish. Congress possess
macy means cf preserving it by conciliation; but the
sword was not placed in their hand to preserve it by force
But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my coun
trymen to pause anl deliberate, before they determine to
destroy this, the gratdest temple whi.h has ever been
dedicated to human fieedom su.ee the world began? It
has teen consecrated by tne oiooo oi our la new, by tha
glories of the past, and by the hopes of the future. The
Union has already made us the most prosperous and, ere
lone. will, if preserved, render us the most powerful na
tion on tbe face of the earth. In every foreign region of
the globe, the title or American citizen is neid in tne
highest respect, andwbeo pronounced in a foreign land
it causes the hearts of cur couutrymen to swell with
honest pride. Surely, when we reach the brink of the
yattning abjss, we shall recoil with horror from the lasl
fatal plunge. By suth a dread catastrophe, tie hopes of
the friends of freedom throughout the world would be
destroyed, and a long eight of leaden despotism wou d
enshroud tLenat'tons. Our exampleformore lhaa eighty
years would not only be lost, but it would be quoted as a
conclusive proof that man is unfit for self-government.
It is not every wrong nay, it is not every grievous
wrong which can justify a resort to such a fearful alter
native. This ought to be the last desperate remedy of a
desnairingneoole. after every other constitutional means
of conciliation had been esh usted. We should reflect
that under this free Government there is an incessant
ebb and flow in public opinion, ane slavery question,
like everything human, win nave its aay. l nrmly be
lieve that it has already reached and passed the culmina
ting ooint. But if, in the midst of the existing excite
ment, the Union shall perish, the evil may then become
irreparable. Congress cm contribute mu.h to aveitit by
proposing and recommending to the Legislatures of the
several States the remedy for existing evils, which the
Constitution has itselt provided lor its own preservation
This has been tried at different critical periods of onr
history, and always with eminent success. It is to be
found in the 5th article providing for its own amendment
Under this article amendments have been proposed by
two-thirds of both houses of Congress, and have been
" ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the sev
eral States," and have consequently become parts of the
Constitution. To this process the country is indebted
for the clause prohibiting Congress from passing any law
respecting an establishment of religion, or abridging the
freedom of speech or of the press, or of the right of peti
tion. To this we are also indebted for the Bill of Rights.
which secures the people against any abuse of power bv
the. Vederal Government. Such were the apprehensions
justly entertained by the friends of State Eights at that
period as to nave renuereu it BAticiucijf uuuuiiui wneiner
the Constitution could have long survived without these
amendments.
Again, the Constitution was amended by the same pro
cess after the election oi President Jefferson by the House
of Representatives, m neoruary, Jbtu. This amend
ment was rendered necessary to prevent a recurrence of
the dangers which had seiionsly threatened the existence
ot the uovernmeni uuring tne penaency oi tnat election.
The article for its own amendment was intended to! se
cure the amicable adjustment of conflicting constitutional
questions like the present, which might arise between
the governments of the States and that of, the United
States. This appears from contemporaneous history.
In this connection, I shall merely call attention to a fow
sentences in Mr. Madison's justly-celebrated report in
1719, to the legislature of Virginia. In this he ably and
conclusively defended the resolutions of the preceding
legislature against the strictures of several other State
legis atures. inese wercuiaiuiy luuuueu upon tne pro
test of the Virginia legislature against the "Alien and
Sedition Acts,"as "palpable and alarming infractions of
the Constitution." in pointing out the pesceful and
constitutional remedies, and he referred to none other, to
which the States were authorized to resort, on sueh oc
casion, he concludes bysaying, "that the legislaturee of
the States might have made a direct representation to
Congress with a view to obtain a rescinding of the two
offensive acts, or they m'ght have represented to their
respective senators in Congress their wish that two-thirds
theieof would propose an explanatory amendment to the
Constitution, or two-thirds of themselves, if such had
been their option, mignt, by an application to Congress,
have obtained a convention for the same obiect."
This is the very course which I earnestly recommend in
order to obtain an 'explanatory amendment" cf the Con
stitution on the subject of slavery. This might originate
with Congress or the State legislatures, as may bs deemed
most advisable to obtain meot)ject
The explanatory amendment might be confined to the
final settlement ot tbe true construction of the Constitu
tion on three special points:
1. An express recognition of the right of property in
Slaves in tne siateswnere it now exists or may hereafter
exist.
2. The duty of protecting this right in all the common
Territories throughout their territorial existence, and
until they shall be admitted as states into the Union,
with er without slavery, as their constitutions may pre
scribe.
3. A like recognition of the right of the master to have
his slave, who has escaped from one Btate to another, re
stored and "delivered up' to him, and of the validity of
the fugitive slave law enacted for this purpose, together
witn a declaration tnat an autie laws imparing or de
feating this light are violations of ihe Constitution, tnd
are consequently nun ami vuiu.
It mav be objected that this construction of the Con
stitution has already been settled by the Supreme Court
of the United States, and wnat more ougtit to be required?
The answer is. that a very large proportion of the people
of the United States still contest the correctness of this
decision, and never will cease from agitation and admit
its binning force until eteariy estaonsnea by the people
of the several States in their sovereign character. Such
an explanatory amendment would, it is believed, forever
terminate the existing aissensions anu restore peace and
humoiiT among the States.
It ought not to be denbted that such an appeal to the
arbitrament estaDiisiieu vy ms ul-ubiimiiiuu hbcii wouia
be received with favor by all tne states ot the Confeder
acy. In any event it ought to be tried in a spirit of con
ciliation before any of these States shall separate them
selves from the Union.

OUB, FOREIGN RELATIONS.
ORUT BRITAIN.
Our relations Kith Great Britain are of the most friend-
Iv fthnracter. Since the commencement of my adminis
tration, the two danverous Questions, arising from tbe
fiinvtnn and Bulwer treaty and from the right of search
claimed by the British government, have been amicably
and honorably adjusted.
The discordant constructions of the Clayton and Bul
wer treaty between the two governments, which, at dif
ferent periods of the discussion, bore a threatening as
pect, nave resulted in m nnai eniemeu vuurcjj aaiis
factory to this Government. In my last annual mes
sage I informed Congress that the British government
had not then "completed treaty arrangements with the
republics of Honduras and Nicaragua, in pursuance of
understanding between the two governments. It is
nevertheless confidently expected that this good work
ere long be accomplished.
This confident expecta
tion has s nee been fulfilled. Her Britannic Majesty
concluded a treaty with Honduras on the 28th November,
1H59, and with Nicaragua on the BSlh August, itftu, re
linquishing the Mosquito protectorate. Besides, by the
former, tbe nay islands are recogntsea as a part oi tne
republic of Honduras. It may be observed thatthe stip
ulations of these treaties conform in every important
particular to the amendments adopted by the Senate of
the United States to the treaty concluded at London on
the 17th October. 1S50, between the two governments.
Itwill be recollected that this treaty was rejected by the
British government because of its objection to the just
and important amendment of the Senate to the article re
lating to Rustan and the other islands in the Bay of
Honduras.
It must be a source of sincere satisfaction to all class
es of our fellow-citizens, and especially to those engag
ed in foreign commerce, that the claim, on the part of
Great Britain, forcibly to visit and aearch American mer
chant vessels on the high seat In time of peace, has been
abandoned. Thiawas by far the most dangerous question
to the peace of the two countries which has existed since
the war of 1812. Whilst it remained open, they might
at any moment have been precipitated into a war. This
was rendered mani'est by the exasperated state of publio
feeling throughout our entire country, produced by the
forcible search of American merchant vessclsby British
cruisers on the coast of Cuba, in the Spring of IbS8.
The American people hailed with general acclaim the or
ders of the Secretary of the Navy to our naval force in
the Gulf of Mexico, "to protect all vessels of theUnited
States on the high seas from search or detention bv the
vesaels-of-war of ai,y other ration." These orders might
nave proucea an loimeaiate collision between tne naval
forcea of the two countries. This was most fortunately
prevented by an appeal to the justice of Great Britain
and to the law of nations as expounded by her own most
eminent junHts.
The only question of any importance which still rl
mains open is the disputed title between the two imim
ments to the island of San Juan, in the vicinity of
n asningiun -ierruory. as tnis question IS Still Under
negotiation, it is not ueemeu advisable at tbe present mo
ment to make any other allnsion to the subject.
The recent visit of the Prince of Wales, in a private
character, to the people of this country, has proved to
pea most auspicious event lnitsconseaaences. it can
not fail to inciease the kindred and kindlv feelings which
I trust may ever actuate the government and people of
both countries in their political and social intercourse
with eacn other.

RUSSIA
Between the great empire of Russia and the United
States the mutual friendship and regard which has so
long existed still continues to prevail, and, if possible, to
increase. Indeed, our relations with that Empire are all
mat we couia aesire.
SPAIN.
Our relations with Spam are now of a more complica'
ted, though less dangerous character than thev have been
ror many yearB uur citizens have long held, and con
tinue to hold numerons claims against the Spanish gov
ernment. These had been ably urged for a seires ol
years by our successive diplomatic representatives at
Madrid, but without obtaining redress. The Spanish
government finally agreed to institute a joint commission
ror tne adjustment or tnese claims, and on the 5th day
of March, 1800, concluded a convention for this purpose
witn our present minister at jnaaria. under this con
vention, what have been denominated "the Cuban
claims," amounting to 9128,635 and 54 cents, in which
more man one nunureaoi our leuow.citizens are inter
ested, were recognizee, and the Spanish government
agreed to pay 5iuu,i-uu ot tnis amount "witbin three
montbs following the exchange of ratifications " The
payment of the remaining 8'J8.63j 54 was to await the
decision of the commissioners for or against "the Amistad
claim;" but in aov event, the balance was to be paid to
tne claimants eitner uy spam or me united states.
These terms, I hare every reason to know, are highly
satisfactory to the holders of the Cuban claims. Indeed
they have made a formal offer authorizing the State De
partment to settle these claims,and lo deduct the amount
of the Amistad claim Irom the sums which they are en
titled to receive irom spam, -mis oiler, oi course, can
not be accepted.
All other claims of citizens of the United States agaicst
Spain, or of subjects of the Queen of Spain against the
United States, including tbe " Amistad claim, were by
this convention referred to aboard of commissioners in
the usual form. Neither the validity of the Amistad
claim, nor of any other claim against either party, with
the single exception of the Cuban claims, was recognized
by Die convention. Indeed, the Spanish government
did not insist that the validity of the Amistad claim
should be thus recognized, notwithstanding its oavmen
had been recommended to Congress by two of mv nreile.

Both Governments were bound respectively to pay the

I transmitted this convention to the Senate for thei
constitutional action on the 3d May, 1EG0, and on the 27th
ot tne succeeding June tney determined that they would
" notadviseand consent" to its ratification.
These proceedings place our relations with Spain in an
awkward and embarrassing position. It is more than
probable that the final adjustment of these claims will
devolve upon my successor.
I reiterate the recommendation contained in ir.v An
nual Message, of Decemher, 1858. and reteateri in that
of December, 1839, in favor of the acquisition of Cuba
irom spam by lair purcnase. l nrmly believe that such
an acquisition wouia contribute essentially to the well
being and prosperity of both countries in all future time,
as well as prove the certain means of immediately abol
ishlng the African slave trade throughout the world. 1

occasion, 11 a ueueveu mat tue transier OI uuba to the

son ever attributed to the First Napoleon a disregard of

to tne united states, ior a tair equivalent both in money

AUSTRIA, &C.
With the Emperor of Austria, and the remain? ennti-
nental powers of Europe, including that of the Sultan,
our relations continue to oe ei me most inendly char
acter. The friendly and peaceful policy pursued bv the Gat.
ernment of tbe United States towards the the empire of
unina naa prouueeu u.e must sauanciory results. The
treaty of Tientsin of the 18th, of Jure, 1853, has been
faithfully observed by the Chinese authorities. The con
vention of the 8th of November, 158, supplementary to
this treaty, for the adjustment and satisfaction of the
claims f our citizens on China, referred to in my last
Annual mcarae, uas ueeu airtauy carried lXttJ ailect, 0
far as this was practicable.
Under this convention the sum of 500,000 taele, equal
to about $700,000, was stipulated to be paid in satisfac
tion of the claims of American citizens, out of the one
fifth of the receipts for tonnage import, and export duties
on American vessels at the ports of Canton, Shanghae,
and Fuchau; and it was "agreed that this amount shall
be in full liquidation of all claims of American citiaena at
the various perts to thia date." Debentures for this
amount to wit: 300,000 taels for Canton, 100,000 for
Shanghae, and 100,000 for Fuchau were delivered ac
cording to the terms of the convention by the respective
Chinese collectors of the customs of these ports to the
agent selected by our minister to receive the same.
Since that time the claims of our citizens have been ad
justed by the board of commissioners appointed for that
purpose under the act of March 3, 1859, and their awards
which proved satisfactory to the claimants, have been
approved by our minister. In the aggregate they amount
to the sum of $108,001 78. The claimants have already
received a large proportion of the sums awarded to them
out of the fund provided, and it iB confidently expected
that the remainder will ere long be entirely paid. After
the awards shall have been satisfied, there will remain a
surplus of more than $200,000 at the disposition of Con
gress. As this will in equity belong to the Chinese gov
ernment, would not justice require its appropriation to
some benevolent object in which he Chinese may be spec
ially inteiested?
Our minister to China, in obedience to his instructions,
has remained perfectly neutral in the war between Great
Britain and France and the Chinese empire; although, in
conjunction with the Russian minister, he was ever ready
and willing, had the opportunity offered, to employ his
gocd offices in restoring peace between the parties. It is
butan act of simple justice, both to our present minister
and his predecessor, to state, that they have proved fully
equal to the delicate, trying, and responsible positions in
wheih they have on different occasions been placed.
JAPAN.
The ratifications of the treaty with Japan concluded at
Tedo on the 29th July, 1858, were exchanged at Washing
ton on the E2d May last, and the treaty itself was pro
claimed on the sncceeding day There is good reason to
expect that, nuderits protection and influence, our trade
and intercourse with that distant and interesting people
will rapidly increase.
'ibe rauncattons or tne treaty were exenangea with
unusual solemnity. For this purpose, the Tycoon had
accredited three of his most distinguished subjects as
envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary, who
were received and treated with marked distinction and
kindness both by the Government and people of the
United States . There is every reason to believe that;
they have returned to their native land entirely satisfied
with their visit, and inspired by the most friendly feel- j
iDtrs for our country. Let us ardently hope, in the lan
guage or tne treaty itseir, tnat "mere snail nencerorward
be perpetual peace and friendship between the United
States of America and His Majesty, the Tycoon of Japan
and his successors."
SRAZ.L.
With tbe wise, conservative, and liberal Government
of the Empire of Brazil our relations continue to be of
the most amicable character.
NEW G RAW AD A.
The exchange of the ratifications of the convention
with the Bepnblio of New Granada, signed at Washing
ton, on the 10th September, 1857, has been long delayed
from accidental causes, for which neither party is censur
able. These ratifications were duly exchanged in this
city, on the 5th of November last Thus has a contro
versy been amicably terminated which had become so
serious at the period of my inauguration, as to require
me, on the 17th April, lb57, to direct our minister to
demand hi passports and return to the United States.
Under this convention the government of New Gra
nada has specially acknowledged itself to be responsible
to our citizens ior aamages wntcn were caused by tbe
riot at Panama on the 15th April, 1856." These claims,
together with other claims of our citizens which had
been long urged in vain, are referred for adjustment to
a board or commissioners. 1 submit a copy of tbe con
vention to Congress, and recommend the legislation ne
cessary to carry it into effect.
COSTA RICA AND NICARAGUA.
Persevering efforts have been made for the adjustment
of the claims of American citizens against the govern
ment of Costa Rica, and I am happy to inform you that
tnese nave nnaiiy prevailed. A convention was signed
at tne city or Ban Jote, on tne vd of July last, between
the minister resident of the United States in Costa Bica
and the plenipotentiaries of that Kepublic, referring
tnese claims to a board or commissioners, and providing
for the payment of their awards. This convention will
be submitted immediately to the Senate for their consti
tutional action.
The claims of our citizens upon the republic of Nica
ragua have not yet been provided for by treaty, although
diligent efforts for th e purpose have been made by our
minister resident to that republic. These are still con
tinued, with a fair prospect of success.
EXICO.
Our relations with Mexico ramain in a most nnsatis
factory condition. In my last two annual messages I
discussed extensively the subject of these relations, and
do not now propose to repeat at length the facts and ar
guments men presented. Tney proved conclusively tnat
our citizens residing in Mexico and our merchants trading
thereto had suffered a series of wrongs and outrages such
as we have never patiently borne from any other nation.
tor thes? oursucessive ministers, invoking tbe faith or
treaties, bad, in tlte nsme of their country, persistently
demanded redress and indemnification, but without the
slightest effect Indeed, so confident bad tbe Mexietn
authorities become of our patient endurance, that they
universally believed tney mignt commit tbese outrages
upon American citizens with absolnte impunity. Thus
wrote our minister in 1856, and expressed theopioion that
"nothing but a manifestation ef the poweror the Govern
ment, and of its purpose -to punish these wrongs, will
avail.
Afterwards, In 185,. came the adoption of a new con
stitution for Mexico, the election of a President and
Congress under itt provisions, and the inauguration of
the President. Within one short month, however, this
President was expelled from the capital by a rebellion in
the army, and tne supreme power or tbe republic wat as
signed to General Zuloaga. This usurper was in his tarn
soon compelled to retire ana give place to General ilira-
mon.
Under the constitution which has thus been adopted
Senor Juarez, as chief justice of tbe Supreme Court, be
came the lawful President of the Republic; and it was far
the maiotenanoe of the constitution and his authority
derived from it that the civil war commenced, and still
continues to be prosecuted-
Throughout the year looo tne constitution' party grew
stronger and stronger. In the previous histor of Mex
ico a successful military revolution at the capital had
almost universally been tte signal for submission
through ut the republic. Not so on the present occa
sion. A majority of the citizens persistently sustained
theconstitutional government. When this was recog
nised in April. 1850, by the Government of the United
States, its authority extended over a large majority of
the Mexican states ana people, including v era Crnz an I
all the other important sea ports of the republic. From
that period our commerce witn mexico began to revive,
and the constitutional government has afforded it all
the protection in their power.
Meanwhile, the government of Miramon still he!d sway
at the capital and over the surrounding country, and
continued its outrages against tne Tew American citizeos
who still had the courage to remain witbin its power.
To cap the climax: After the battle of Tacubaya, in
April, leoy, Uen. JHarquez ordered three citizens of the
United states, two of them phjsic'ans, to be seized in tha
hospital at that place, taken out and shot, without crime
and without trial. This was done, notwithstanding our
unfortunate countrymen were at the moment engaged
io tha holy cause of affording relief to the soldiers of
both parses who had been wounded in the battle, with
outmaking any distinction between them.
'Xbe time had arrived, in my opinion, when this Gov
ernment was bound toexert its power to avenge and re
dress the wrongs of our cHzens and to afford them pro
tection in Mexieo. The interposing obstacle was tnat
the portion of the country under the sway or Miramon
coaldnotbereacned wituout passing over territory un
der the jurisdiction or the constitutional government
Under these circumstances, I deemed it my duty to re
commend to Congress, in my last annual message, tbe
employment or a eutncient military torce to penetrate
into the interior where the government of Miramon was
to be found, with, or, if need be, without the consent of
the Juarez government, though it was not doubted that
this consent could be obtained, never nave i naa a
clearer conviction on any subject than of the justice as
well as wisdom of such a policy, mo other alternative
was left, except the entire abandonment of onr fellow
citizens who had gone to Mexico, ander the faith of trea
ties, to the systematic injustice, cruelty, and oppression
of Miramon's governmeut. Besides, it is almest certain
that the simple authority to employ this force would of
itself have accomplished all our objects without striking
a single blow. Theconstitutional government would
then ere this have been established at the city of Mexico,
and would have been ready and willing, to the extent of
ita ability, to do us justice.
In addition and I deem this a most important con
sideration European governments would have been de
prived of all pretext to inter! ere in the territorial and
domestic concerns of Mexico. We should thus have been
relieved from the obligation of resisting, even by force,
should this become necessary, any attempt by these gov
ernments to deprive oar neighboring republic of portions
or her territory; a amy irom wnicn wecouta notsnnnk
without abandoning the traditional and established poliey
of the American people. I am happy to observe, thst,
firmly relying upon the jus'ice and good faith of these
governments, there is no present aangcr tnat such aeon
tingency will happen.
Having discovered that my rcccmn-endat'ors would
not be sustained by Congress, tbe next alternative was
to accomplish, in some degree, it possible, the same ob
iects by treaty stipulations with the constitutional gov
ernment, such treaties were accordingly concluded by
our late able and excellent minister to Mexico, and on
the 4th of January last were submitted to the Senate for
ratification. As these have not yet received the final
action of that body, it would be improper for me to pre
sent a detailed statement of their provisions. Still I may
be permitted to express the opinion in advance, that they
are calculated to promote the agricultural, manufactur
ing and commercial interests of tho country, and to se
cure our just inflaence with an adjoining republic, as to
whose fortunes and fate we can never feel indifferent
whilst at the same time they provide for the payment of
a considerable amount towards the satisfaction of the
claims of our injured fellow-citizens.
KANSAS AND UTAH.
At the period of my inauguration I was confronted in
Kansas by a revolutionary government, existing under
what iB called the Topeka constitution. Its avowed
obiect was to subdue the territorial Government by force.
and to inaugurate what was called the Topeka govern
ment in its stead. To accomplish this object an extensive
military organization was formed and its command en
trusted to the most violent revolutionary leaders. Un
der these circumstances, it became my imperative duty
to prevent the flames of civil war from again raging in
Kansas, wmcn, mine excited state or tne public mind
both North and South, might have .extended into the
neigriDoring states.
The hostile parties in Kansas had been inflamed a
gainst each other by emissaries both from the North and
the South, to a degree of malignity without parallel in
our history. To prevent actual collision, and to assist
the civil magistrates in enforcing the laws, a strong de
tachment of the army was stationed iu the Territory
ready to aid the marshal and his deputies, when lawfully
caiiea npon as a posse comuaius m tne execution oi civ
il and criminal process.
Still, the troubles in Kansas could not have been per
manently settled without an election by the people. The
ballot bx is tne surest arbiter of disputes am on it free
men. Under this convict:on, every proper effort was em
ployed to induce the hostile parties to vote at the election
of delegates to frame a State constitution, and afterwards
at the election to decide whether Kansas should be a
slaveora free Etate. The insurgent party refused to
vote at either, lest this might be considered a recogni
tion on their part of the territorial government estab-
iisned uy congress, a. netter spirit, nowever, seemed
soon after to prevail, and the two parties met face to face
at tne third election, held on the first Monday of Jan
uary, 1858, for membeis of the legislature and State of
ficers under the JLecompton constitution. Tee resul
was the triumph of the anti-slavery party at the polls
This decision of the ballot-box proved clearly that this
party were in the majority, and removed the danger of
civil war. jvroin tuat time we nave neard little or noth-
icsr of the Topeka government; and all serious dansrer
ofrevolutiontionary troubleiin Kansas was then at an
end
The Lecompton constitution, which had been thus re
cognised at this State election by the votes of both po
litical parties in Kansas, was transmitted to me with the
request that I should present it to Congress. This I
could not have refused to do without violating my clear
est and strongest convicMons of duty. The constitution,
and all the proceedings which preceded and followed its
formation, were fair and regular on their face. I then
believed, and experience has proved, that the interests of
the people of Kansas would have been best consulted by
its admission as a State into the Union, especially as the
majority, witbin a brief period, could have amended the
eoDstitution according to their will and pleasure. If
fraud existed io all or any of these pioceedings, it was
not for the President, but for Congress, to investigate
and determine the question of fraud, and what ought to
be its consequences. If, at the two first elections, the
majority refused to vote, it cannot be pretended that
this refusal to exercise the elective franchise could in
validate an election fairly held under lawful authority,
even if they had not subsequently voted at the third
election. It is true that the whole constitution had not
been submitted to the people, as I always desired; but
the precedents are numerous of the admission of States
into the Union without such submission.
It would not comport with my present purpose to re
view the proceedings of Congress upon the Lecompton
constitution- It is sufficient to observe that their final
action has removed the last vestige of serious revolu
tionary troubles. The desperate band recently assem
bled, under a notorious outlaw, in the southern portion
of the Territory, to resist the execution of the lawaand
to plunder peaceful citizens, will, I doubt not, be speed
ily subdued and brought to justice.
IIad I treated the Lecompton Constitution as a nullity,
and refused to transmit it to Congress, it is not difficult
to imagine, whilst recalling the position of the country
at that moment, what would have been the disastrous
consequences, both in and out of the Territory, from
such a dereliction of duty on the part of the Executive.
Peace has also been restored within the lerritory of
Utah, which, at the commencement of my Administra
tion, was in a state ox open reneiiion. xmawas tne
more dangerous, as the people, animated by a fanatical
spirit, and entrenched within their distant moun tain fast
nesses, might have made a long and formidable resistance.
Cost what it might, it was necessary to bring them into
subjection to the Constitution and the laws. Sound pol
icy, therefore, as well as humanity, required that this
obiect should, if possible, be accomplished without tbe
effusion of blood. This could only be effected by sending
a military force into the Territory sufficiently strong to
convince the people that resistance would be hopeless,
and at the same time to offer them a pardon for past
onences on conoiuon oi immediate su omission to tne
Government. This policy was pursued with eminent
success ; ana tne oniy cause ror regret is the heavy ex
penditure required to march a laree detachment of the
army to tnat remote region, and to furnish it subsistence,
Utah is now comparatively peaceful and auiet. and the
military force has been withdrawn, except that portion
oi it necessary to Keep tne xnaians m check, and to pro
tect tne emigrant trains on tneir way to our racino pos
sessions FrNAMCCI.
In my first annual mossage I promised to employ my
bestsxertiors, in co-operation with Congress, to reduce
the expenditures of the Government within the limits of
a wise and judicious economy. An overflowing treasury
had produced habits of prodigality and. extravagance

It ought in justice to be observed that several of the
estimates from the departments for the year ending 30th,
June, 1860, were reduced by Congress below what was
and sun is deemed compatible witn the public interest.
Allowing a liberal margin of $..500,000 for the reduc

the Bum of $61. 000,000; or at the most $62,000,000, is
amply sufficient toadministerthe Governmentand to pay

should hereafter render extraordinary expenditures nec-

This result has been attained in a considerable degree

AFRICAN SLAVS TlADC, &C.
It is with a great satisfaction I communicate the fact.
that, since the date of my last Annual Message, not a
single slave has been imported into the United States in
violation of the lans prohibiting the African slave trade.
This Statement Is founded upon a thorough examination
and investigation of the subject. Indeed, the spirit
which prevailed some time since among a portion or our
fellow citizens in favor of this trade seems to have en
tirely subsided.

to demand
ELECTION OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
I again recommend to Congress the passage of a law in
pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution, appoint-
a day certain, previous to tne 4th iiarch. in each year
of an odd number, for the election of representatives
throughout all the states. A similar power has alreadv
been exercised, with general approbation, in the appoint
ment oi ine tame aay tnrougnout tne union tor holding
the election of electors for President and Vice President
of the United States. My attention was earnestly direct
ed to this subject from the fact, that the 35th Concresa
terminated on tne ml ot uaarcn, leas, without making the
necessary appropriation for the service of the Post Office
juepartment. l was then forced to consider tbe best reme
dy ror this emission, and an immediate call of the present
uongress was tne natural resort, upon inquiry, however,
I ascertained that fifteen out of the 33 States composing
the Confederacy were without representatives, and that.
consequently, these fifteen States would be disfranchised
by such a call. Tnee fifteen States will be in the same
condition on the 4th March next. Ten of them cannot
elect representatives, according to existinc State laws, un

In my last message I gave warning that in time of

tutions might depend upon the power of the President
immediately to assemble a full Congress, to meet the
emergency.
TARIFF.
It is new quite evident that the financial necessities of
the Government will require a modification of the tariff
during your present 8C3sion, tor the purpose or increas
ing the revenue. In this aspect, I desire to reiterate the
recommendation contained in my last two annual mes
saces, in favor of imposing specific instead of ad valorem
duties on all imported articles to which these can be
property app.iea. t rom lone observation and expen
ence I am convince! that specific duties are necessary,
botn to protect tne revenue and to secure to ourmanu
facturing interests that amount of incidental encouge
ment which unavoidably results from a revenue tariff.
As an abstract proposition, it may be admitted that ad
valorem duties would, in theory, be the most just and
equal, nut it the experience of this and all other com
mercial nations'has demonstrated that such duties cannot
be assessed and collected without great frauds upon the
rt venue, then it ie the part of wisdom to resort to specific
duties. Indeed, from the very natu.e of an ad valorem
duty, this must be the result. Under it the inevitable
ensequence is, that foreign goods will be entered at less
than their true value. The treasury will, therefor, lose
the difference between their real and fictitious value, and
to imsextentwe are ueirauoea.
The temptation which ad valorem duties present to a
dishonest importer are irresistable. His object is to pass
his goods through the custom-house at the very lowest
valuation necessary to save them -trom confiscation . in
this he to 3 often succeeds in spite of the vigilance of the
revenue officers. Hence the resort to false invoices, one
for the purchaser and another for the custom-house, and
toother expedients to defraud the Government. The
honest importer produces his invoice to the collector.
stating the actual price at which he purchased tte arti
cles abroad. Not so the dishonest importer and the agent
oi meioreign mamticturer. And here it may be ob
served that a very large proportion of the manufactures
imported from abroal are consigned for sale to commis
sion merchants who are mere agents employed by the
manufacturers. In such cases no actual sale has been
made to fix their value. The foreign manufacturer, if he
be dishonest, prepares an invoice of the goods, not at
their actual value, but at the very.lowest rate necessary
to escape detection. In this manner the dishonest im
porter and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a decided ad
vantage over tne nocest me reliant xney are tnus en
abled to undersell the fair trader, and drive him from the
market. In fact, the operation of this system has alieady
driven from the pursuits of honorable c mmerce many
of that class of regular a&d conscientious merchants.
whose character thrcughout the world, is the pride of our
country.
The remedy for these evils is fo be found in specific
duties, so far as thismay be practicable. Tkey dispense
with any inquiry at the custom-house into the actual
cost or value of the article, and it pays tbe precise a
mount of duty previously fixed by law. They present
no temptations to the appraisers of foreign goods, who
receive but small salaries, and might, by undervaluation
in a few cases, render themselves independent.
Besides, specific duties best conform to the requisition
in the Constitution that "no preference shall be given by
any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of
one State over those cf another.' Under our ad valorem
system such preferences are to some extent inevitable,
and complaints have often been made that the spirit of
this provision has keen violated bya lower appraisement
of the same articles at one port than at another.
An impression strangely enough prevails to some ex
tent that specific duties are necessarily protective duties.
Nothing can be more fallacious. Great Britain glories in
free trade, and yet her whole revenue from imports is at
the presant moment collected under a system of specific
duties. It is a striking fact in this connection that, in
the commercial treaty of 23d January, 18C0, between
France and England, one of tbe articles provides that the
ad valorem duties whxh it Imposes shall be converted
into specific duties within six months from its date, and
these are to be ascertained by making an average of the
pricesforsix months previous to that time. The re
verse of the proposition would be nearer to tte truth,
uccuubc k ujuuii mrger amount oi revenue wouin ire col
lected by merely converting the ad valorem duties 'of a
tann into equivalent specific duties. To this extent the
revenue would be increased, and in the same proportion
the specific duty might be diminished.
Specific duties would secure to the American manufac
turer the incidental protection to which be is fairly enti
tled under a revenue tariff, and to this surely no person
would object. The framers of the existing tariff have
gone further, and in a liberal spirit have discriminated in
favor of large and useful branches of our manufactures,
not by raising the rate of duty upon the importation of
similar articles from abroad, but what is the same in ef
fect, by admiting articles free of duty which enter into
the composition of their fabrics.
Under the present system it has been often truly re
marked that this incidental protection decreases when the
manufacturer needs it most, and increases when he needs
it least, and constitutes a sliding scale which always op
erates against him. The revenue of the country are sub -ject
to similar fluctuation. Instead of approaching a
steady standard, as would be the case under a system of
oimiuu uuuci, mcjf biuk. anu rise wiia me BiQKing and
rising prices of articles in foreign countries It would not
be difficult for Congress to arrange a system of specific
duties which would afford additional stability both to our
revenue and our manufactures, and without injury or in
justice to any interest of the country. This might be ac
complished by ascertaining the average value of any given
article for a series of years at the place of exportation, and
by simply converting the rate of ad valorem duty upon
it which might be deemed necessary for revenue purposes,
into the form of a specific duty. Suoh an arragexnent
could not injure the consumer. If h .nni3 A
greater amount of duty one year, mis would be counter
balanced by a lesser amount the next, and in the and the
aggregate would be the same.

seated by the Secretary in his report to Congress ; and to
.VaM WMm MitMuirg pc promptly adopted, to emv
ble it to discharge its pressing obligations. The other
recommendations oi ue report are well worthy oi your
favorable consideration.
I herewith trammit to Coe cress the Renorts of the
Secretaries of War, of the Navy, of the Interior, and of
the Postmaster-General. The recommendations and sug
gestions which they contain are highly valuable, and de
serve your careful attention.
The report oi tne Postmaster General details the cir
cumstance under which Cornelius Vanderbilt, on my re
quest, agreed, in me montn oi July last, to cany the
ocean mails between onr Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Had
he not thus acted, this important intercommunication
mast nave oeen suspended, at least tor a season. Tne
Postmaster General had no power to make him any other
compensation roan tne postages on tne mall matter wmcn
he might carry. It was known, at the time, that these
postages would fall far short of an adequate compensa
tion, as wen as ox tne stun wmcn tne same service naa
previously cost the Government. Mr Vanderbilt, in a
commendable spirit, was willing to rely upon the jus
tice of Congress to make up the deficiency; and I, there
fore, recommend that an appropriation may be granted
for this purpose,
1 mould do great injustice to tne Attorney uenem,
were I to omit the mention of his distinguished sei vices
in the measures adopted and prosecuted by him for the
defence of the Government against numerous and un
founded claims to land in California, purporting to have
been made by the Mexican government previous to the
treaty of cession, xne cucccesiui opposition to wew
claims has saved to the United States public property
worth meny mil ions of dollars, ftDd to individuals hold
ing title under them to at least an equal amount.
It has been represented to me, irom sources wuicu x
deem reliable, that the inhabitants in several portions of
Earn as have been reduced nearly to a state of starvation,
on acceunt of the almost total failure of their crops
whilst the harvests in every other portion of the country
have been abundant. The prospect before them for the
approaching winter is well calcu ated to enlist the sym
pathies of every heart. The destitution appears to be
so general that it cannot be relieved ty private contri
butions, and they are in such indigent circumstances as
to be unable to purchase the necessaries of life for them
selves I refer the subject to Congress- If any consti tutional
measure for their relief tan b- devied, I would
recommend its adoption.
I cordially commend to your favorable regard tbe in
terests of the people of tbis Cistiict. 1 hey are eminently
entitled to your consideration, especially since, uxlike the
people of the States, they can appeal to no Government
except that of the Union.
