THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Inevitably the annual message
of the president contains much
that is of only special interest and
the public attention turns first to
the treatment of those subjects
which are uppermost in general
thought and esteemed of the great
est public interest. The president
himself yields to this sentiment
and opens his message with a com
plete review of the Chinese com
plication," its historical sources,
the course of events from the up
rising to the relief of the legations
in Pekin the policy pursued by
this government and the success
ful efforts to secure unanimity of
action by all the governments
interested. Little is stated that
was not known, but it gives the
stamp of authenticity to what had
rested in unofficial statement,
while it disposes of much that
was unauthentic rumor. It con
veys the assurance that the gen
eral line of conduct laid down in
the note of July has been and will
be steadily adhered to. Chinese
territorial integrity will be insisted
upon treaty rights made secure
commercial and other interests
safe-guarded for the future indem
nity for actual damages obtained,
and punishment of those respon
sible for the crimes be compelled
but execution left to Chinese
authorities. The recital closes
with the statement that the presi
dent concurs'with the suggestion
of Russia that, if negotiations can
not be conducted satisfactorily by
the representatives at Pekin, they
be transferred to the tribunal of
arbitration contemplated by the
conference of the Hague.
The next topic to which readers
will turn for information, both as
to what has been doite and what is
intended or recommendedjjto be
done, is the treatment o£ affairs Jin
the Philippines. It is not only
that the acquisition and disposi
tion of the islands formed the
storm center of the late president
ial campaign which makes this
topic second, possibly first, in im
portance, but expectation has been
excited that the message would
contain explicit statements of the
policy the president would pursue
if congress leaves matters in his
hands, or of the legislation cougress
should enact if it thinks best to
assume control. The message is
replete as to what has been done,
giving in full the instructions to
the commission, of which Judge
Taft is chairman, and which as
sumed civil jurisdiction last Sep
tember. The purpose of the presi
dent to establish as fast and as far
as possible civil government with
natives participating in its admin
istration so far as they are cap
able to begin this formation and

communities, and extend gradually

t^_ the organization and govern
ment of provinces, finding com
pletion in a general government
for the islands, thus carrying into
the experiment there the spirit of
our own institutions and govern
ment, is plainly shown in the in
structions. If any expected that
there would be intimation of what
should be the ultimate relations
of the islands to this country, they
ignored the scrupulous deference
the president has always shown to
the legitimate jurisdiction of con
gress. He considers that, until
congress acts, he is using his pow
ers as, comander-ia-chief to quiet
rebellion, restore order, and en
deavor to establish civil govern
ment. If any expected any inti
mation of ultimate purpose to
scuttlS they will, of course, be
disappointed.
The next large topic of general
interest is the isthmian canal, the
Hepburn bill for the construction
of which is pending, and from the
path of which the state department
announces it has removed diploma
tic obstacles. The president
states that the concessions to the
maritime company and the Eyre
Cragin syndicate have been an
nualled, and that negotiations
are pending with Nicaragua and
Costa Rica having in view the
construction under the auspices of
the United States. As a further
move to clear the way he urges
upon the senate the consideration
of the IJay-Pauncefote treaty that
any possible objection based on
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty may be
forestalled.—St. Paul Dispatch.
THE MAN WHO FORESAW.
On that May morning when the
news of Dewey's victory electrified
the nation The Chicago Inter
Ocean's Washington correspon
dent sought Cabinet members'
opinions as to its larger results.
All rejoiced in the victory and
praised the courage and conduct
of Dewey and his men. Some per
ceived that Spain's rule in Asia
was ended, and that the Philip
pines were ours for the taking.
But only one clearly understood,
or at least was then willing to ex.
press, the true significance of this
splendid triumph of our arms.
Secretary of Agriculture James
Wilson said in effect that no mili
tary success of the century would
prove so beneficial to American
farmers as this. He pointed out
that China and the adjacent coun
tries wererthlfe greatest undeveloped
markets for American products on
the globe. He foresaw that we
would take and keep the Philip
pines. He declared that their
possession would give us such
weight and influence in Asia! as we
had never had. He predicted that
by reason of holding them our
Asiatic trade would grow by leaps
and bounds.
The figures given" in Secretary
Wilson's annual report, just issued
prove the accuracy of his forecast.
In 1896 our total exports to Asia
and Oceanica were only $43,000,00C
of which only $9,700,000 were
agricultural products. In 1900
our exports to the same countries
are $107,000,000, of which $30,000,.
000 are farm products. Our total
exports to the Philippines have
grown from less than $200,000 to
more than $2,600,000. Our agri
cultural exports to those islands
have increased from less than $23,
000, to $1,700,000.
Our greatest farm export staples
are wheat and cotton. In 1896
we sent to the Orient 1,211,000
barrels of wheat flour, valued at
$8,600,000. In 1900 we sent 2,378,
000 barrels, worth over $7,000, (XX).
In 1896 we shipped across the
Pacific only 88,000 bales of cotton,
valued at $1,500,000. In 1900 we
sent 325,000 bales, worth over $13,
000,000. In 1896 our cotton mills
sold to the Orient only $5,500,000
worth of their product. In 1900
they sold over $12,000,000 worth.
These figures show why Southern
planters were so lukewarm toward
Mr. Bryan's scuttle policy, and why
Nebraska and western farmers
voted to retain the Philippines.
When the time came to make
peace with'Spain-, Secretary Wil
son was the member of the Cabinet
who never wavered from the policy
of reaping the full fruits of our
victory. He saw that justice to
'the peoples long oppressed by
Spain and our own interests alike
demanded that this course be
taken. The growth of our trade
with the recent. Spanish posses
sions and with Hawaii whose im
mediate acquisition resulted from
Dewey's victory, has proved the
soundness of James Wilson's views.
In 1896 our exports to all these
islands were less than $13,500,000,
divided as follows: To Cuba,
$7,300,000 to Porto Rico, $2,100,
000 to Hawaii, $3,900,000 to the
Philippines, less than $200,000.
In 1900 our exports to the islands
were: To Cuba, $25,000,000 to.
Porto Rico, $4,300,000 to Hawaii,
$13,000,000 to the Philippines,
over $2,600,000, or a total of $44,
900,000. In the same period our
agricultural exports to Cuba grew
from $4,000,000, to $14,000,000 to
Porto Rico, from $1,200,000, to $2,
300,000 to Hawaii, from $1,100,
000, to $2,800,00U to the Philip
pines, from less than $23,000 to
over $1,700,000 to all from a total
of $6,323,000 to a total of $20,800,
000.
These figures, of course, are
small when compared with our
otal agricultural exports of $844,
000,000 in 1900, but to the Ameri
can farmer they are significant.
They show .him that his great new
market is in the Orient, to which
his sales have grown over 200 per
cent in four years, while his sales
to the rest of the world averaged
but 30 per cent greater in 1896
1900 than in 1892-1896.
What An Old North Dakota
Boy Has Done.
There are none of thje new states
that have made a better record in
recruiting the ranks of American
authors than North Dakota.
Among the contributors of a large
number of the leading periodicals
of the east are old North Dakota
newspaper boys, who first tried
their journalistic wings in North
Dakota. Prominent among them
is Joe Mitchell Chappie, the auth
or of two popular novels, and now
the successful editor of "The Na
tional Magazine," at Boston, a
periodical which has taken fore
most rank under his management.
It does not seem so many years
ago that "Joe" as we all called him
was editor of "The Grand Rapids
Journal" in La Moure, where he
set all his type, run his hand press
and did his editorial work and
cooking besides. Between "takes"
he was "frying his bacon" and a
happier, sunnier dispositioned and
more determined boy of 16 never
made a start in life. The farmers
brought him potatoes, pumpkins,
chickens and pork, and the good,
motherly farmers' wives often filled
his larder with pies, cakes and
good things when they came to
town to trade on Saturday, for they
were all proud of their boy editor.
Every family within eight miles
was op his subscription list, and
every householder was a §tock
holder. Copies of the old "Granc
Rapids Journal" edited by Joe
Chappie, are much prized relics
This paper had bursts of literature
and pretentious interviews anc
erudite discussions that indicated
the ambitions of the bpy editor in a
prairie village of 100 inhabitants
The community encouraged him
in his efforts to establish libraries
literary clubs and musical organi
zations, which produced opera and
oratorios. The rigid winters had
no terrors for them—the farmers

and neighbors six and ten miles
apart Were like one family. Those
were the happy old territorial days
and North Dakota with the flower
of its young men in literature, art
and science, and the glory won by
the North Dakota soldier boys in
the Philippines make a record of
which the new state may well -feel
pioud. The people of North Da
kota are quick to appreciate all
this and Joe Mitchell Chappie has
made a special offer of "The Na
tional Magazine" for one year at
50 cents, if received, before Janu-'
ary 1st. ^This is one-half the regu
lar price and is an- astonishing
offer. ''Joe" insists that he wants
every magazine reader in North
Dakota on his list as an "old
home" endorsement and {declares
that if any one feels that they are
not getting a big value for 50
cents, they can have their] money
back by return mail. Now lay
aside 50 cents and send to "The
National Magazine" at once, while
this offer lasts and you will not
have occasion to regret it. He
wants to start in the new era of
McKinley times with North Da
kota well represented.

In this treasure-field the richest

Rudyard Kipling won his first

by short stories of life in
India, stories at times tragically
jrosaic, at times marvelous and
mystical, always pregnant with

he first instalment of "Kim," the
atest and the most important
novel from Kipling's pen. From
he beginning it reveals itself as a
masterpiece, worthy alike of its
theme and of its author.
Miller-Thompson Nuptials.
Grand Forks Herald.
Yesterday, (November 29th,) at
high noon, at the home of the
bride's brother, J. W. Thompson,
008 Belmont avenue, occurred the
wedding of Truman £!. Miller and
Miss Emma Thompson. The
wedding was strictly a family affair
and was one of the prettiest that
has ever been held in the city.
The bride and groom were unat
tended. Prof. Woodworth pro
nouncing the words that made the
two one. The bride has been a
resident of Grand Forks for some
time past and for several years has
been a clerk in the office -of the
register of deeds of Grand Forks
county. She has a very large
circle of acquaintances by. whom
she is held in the highest esteem.
The groom is a member of the firm
of LaRue & Miller, grain and fuel
dealers of Devils Lake, and is one
of the most prominent and highly
respected businessmen of that city.
After the ceremony a combination
wedding and Thanksgiving dinner
was served those present. Those
present from out of the city were
Miss Ellison, a cousin of the bride,
of Winnipeg, and D. B. Thomp
son, a brother, of Bemidji. Miss
Calvert played the wedding march.
The presents that were received
were both numerous and elegant
in the extreme and testified to high
esteem in which the Contracting
parties are held. Mr. and Mrs.
Miller left on the evening train
for Devils Lake, where the groom
has a very pretty home prepared
for the reception of his bride. The
departure of Miss Tlhompson from
the city is deeply regretted by all
but Grand Forks' loss will be
Devils Lake's gain, and the young
couple will be followed to their
new home by the best wishes of a
host of friends here.
Mr. and Mrs. T. C. Miller will be
"at home" after December 15th.

Mrs. Mary Lawler, of Appleton,Wis.f
was cured of kidney trouble by Peruna.
In a recent letter to Dr. Hartman, she
says: "Last August I caught a summer
cold which settled in the kidneys and
caused me serious inconvenience. Noth
ing I did seemed to help me and the
doctor advised a change of climate. As
that was out of the question for me, I
tried Peruna as a last resort, and I found
it was a God-send to me."
The kidneys are the natural gateway
out of which much of the waste tissue
finds its escape. This waste matter be
comes a very poisonous substance if al
lowed to accumulate. The renal artery
brings the blood charged with impuri
ties to the kidnpys.

If the kidneys are healthy they will
excrete the poison from the blood. The
renal veins return the purified blood
from the kidneys to the general cir»
eolation.
Peruna stimulates the kidneys to ex»
crete from the blood the accumulating
poison, and thus prevents the convul
sions which are sure to follow if the
poisons are allowed to remain. It gives
great vigor to the heart's action and
digestive system, both of which are apt
to fail rapidly in this disease.

summer than in winter. Send for a
