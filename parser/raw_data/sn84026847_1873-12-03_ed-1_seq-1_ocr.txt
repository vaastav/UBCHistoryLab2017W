THE PRESIDENTS message.
We have this morning in condensed
form the message transmitted by the
Frtsident to the Forty-third Congress,
ve.-terday. It is a common-place docu
ment and fails to excite that degree of
popular attention that used to attach to
Presidential Messages. In these days
of the telegraph and of the daily press
the people at large have come to know
a most as much about national affair*
a- the President himself, and hence
that otVicial has nothing particularly
r,ew or startling to communicate to
Ongre?* or to the general public.
The foreign and domestic concerns
of the government are, by means
of the present diffusion of intelligence"
: ?;;:s-t'd in every hamlet in the coun
::v agnosias soon as they are consid
er? liy the beads of departments at
W'a-hiogtoD, and the average opinion
t f the country is very promptly express
?1 ac J very easily understood. For
th ? reason Presidential messages have
cea?eJ to attract the attention that
they o:;ce elicited and have quite failed
to excite the intense popular interest
that attached to tliem some twenty
yfars ago.
n President CI rant's message there is
quite new; nothing that has not
beeu aire a ly discussed before the peo
p'e. It is to be regretted that the
Pre-Uea lends his aid to several
^ :.mc' which the people disapprove,,
fuch as the Portal Savings' Bank and
the Torts! Telegraph project. It was
vifh'ur. Grant in extenuation of
aa objectionable pa-sage in a former
::iessa:e."MoRTox put that in." In
i?e or several palpable errors in the
: message it may well be urged
:;.s; Cre.-well put them in.
We will have occasion hereafter to
note the effect of the President's rec
oramer.Jatiota to Congress, and until
;:j?n we d?fer further comment ; only
Ci.i ng attention at this time to the
tar. that the back pay and increase
? -alary swindle, the one topic that has
a discussed by the people and which
i.:i- produced so disastrous results
.v:, : g the President's followers.is etudij
?us'v ignored by President Grant, arid
lo o:.e could learn from his message to
Congress that the people of the country
i.ai expre?sed in emphatic terms their
unwillingness to be robbed. The mes
is remarkable for this omission, if
for nothing else.

WASHINGTON.
Sj nop*U of the PreNldent'M Meunice
to tlic t'oriy-tbirU Con^r wan.
Washington, Dec. 2. ? ' Tbe Presi
dent's message opens with a reference
to the-eventa of the past year, as a
period of great prosperity, marked by
the financial crisis and tbe cessation o^
partizan strife ; tbe eeizure of the Vir
ginius producing for a time universal
excitement. The Virginius case is
happily in the course of honorable
adjustment, and other Fortign relations
are friendly. Tbe Vienna Exposition
is referred to as gratifying to American
inventors who received medals and di
ploma*. In regard to finance the Pre
sident submits whether the treasury
might not issue at any time, to national
banks of issue, any amount of their own
notes below a fixed percentage of their
own iesue, say forty per cent, upon the
banks depositing with the United States
treasury an amount of government
bor.ds equal to the amount of notes de
manded, the banks to forfeit to the said
treasury four per cent of the bonds eo
pledged, during the time they remain
with the treasurer as security for the
increased circulation. The bonds bo
pledged to be redeemable by the banks
at pleasure by returning their own bills
in circulation, to an amount equal to the
bonds with the Treasurer. The Presi
dent further recounts that the banks be
authorized to diminish their outstand
ing is?ue at pleasure, by returning bills
for cancellation and withdrawing the
bonds pledged for the bills returned.
The President refers to the continued
contractions of the currency during the
past four years as beingdueto the growtll
of population and the building of many
miles of rail roads. Attention is invit
ed to the pos'.al telegraph project, but
without distinct reccomendation. lie
also urge* general amnesty to rebels as
being now perfectly sa'? and productive
of more rights for the freedmen. An
enabling act is needed to admit Colora
do as a State. Some progress has been
made in suppressing the Chinese coolie
trade. The Geneva awards have been
paid by Great Britain a few days before
they were due. The recommendation
is rene wed for a Commision to audit the
losses inflicted by the Alatama, Florida,
and Shenandoah. The settlement o?
the Northwestern Watec. Boundary
question i* referred to t lie action of a
mixed commission, appointed for set
tling and determining the claims of
citizen.- of either power acainpt the cthrr
arising from acts committed during the
period trom April 1SG1 to April 1S6>.
He further recommends legislation to
create a t-pecial court, to consi-t o! three
judges, to hear and determine all claims
upon the United States arising out of
acts committe 1 during the rebellion.
Reference is made to the Dutch Aclii
He? e-var and the neutral position as
sumed by the United States.
Referring to the establishment of the
Spanish Republic, the President says
its existence was inaugurated by strik
ing the fetters from slavery in Porto
Rico and the raising of ten thousand
persons held as slaves, when the Cap
tain-Ooneral wa? deprived of the power
to execute his orders. Havana has
thus far succeeded in defeating the
etforts of liberal men in Spain. Under
the p'.ofi.-sions of loyalty to the mother
c untry, this element is exhausting the
resources of Cuba and doing acts at
variance with those principles of justice
and liberality which give nobility of
oh .racier !o a republic.
The cise of the Vtrginius is then
st.Ll and the Senate resolution of 1S5S,
" Th a American vessels on the h:gh
seas in time of peace, and under the
American llag are under the jurisdiction
of the country to which thev belong, and
therefore any molestation of such ves
sels is in derrogation of the sovreignty
of the United States." In accordance
with this principle the restoration of
the Virginius ; the surrender of ths sur
vivors; due reparation to the
flag and the punishment of the
guilty authorities were demand
ed. Spain has recognized the
justice of the demand and has arranged
for its immediate satisfaction.
In taking leave of the subject, I
wish to renew the expression of my
conviction that the existence of African
slavery in Cuba is the principle cause
of the lamentable condition of the Is
land. I hope it may eoon be made to
disappear and that peace and prosperi
ty mav follow its abolition.
The President recommends an amrd
mentofthe method of electing ?k?
President and Vice President of the
United States. Also an amendment
authorizing the executive to approve of
so much of any measure passed in Con
gress as bis judgment dictates without
improving the whole. Also an amend
ment that in case of extra sessions only
such business shall be brought up as
the executive brings before Congress.
Discussing the report of the Secreta
ry of the Treasurv, the President rec
ommends to Congress economy, lie
points out two sources to commence
with ; first, the withdrawal of appro
priations for public buildings in many
cities where work has no? yet been
commenced, and in appropriations for
river and harbor improvements, for
such as are of little benefit to general
commerce, and for fortifications. A
still more fruitful source of expenditure
I will point out later in the message. I
refer to the easy manner of manufac
turing claims incurred in suppressing
the late lebellion. He approves of the
government owning its own buildings,
and hopes the day is not far diitant
when it will not only possess them, but
will erect in the Capital suitable resi
dences for all persons who receive com
mutation for quarters or rent at great
e^spenae. And lor the Cabinet, thus set
[ ting an example to the States, which
| may induce them to erect buildings for
the Senators, but he would have thia
work conducted when the revenues of
the country would abundantly justify
it.
The revenues have materially fallen
off from the first five months of the
present fiscal year, owing to the general
panic. It is the duty of Congress to
heed the lesson and provide a wise and
well condensed legislation against its re
currence. My own judgment is, that
however mueh individuals may have
suffered, one long step baa been taken
toward specie payments; that we can
never have permanent prosperity until
the specie basis is reached ; and that a
specie basis cannot be reached and
maintained under our exports, exclu
sive of gold pav for our imports, inter
est due abroad, and other specie obli
gations, or so nearly as to leave an
appreciable accumulation of the pre
cioua metals in the country from the
products of our mines. Ihe develop
ment of the mines of precious metals,
during the past year and the prospec
tive development of them for years
to come are gratifying in their results.
Could but one-half of the gold extract
ed from our mints be retained at home,
our advance towards specie payments
would be rapid. To increase our ex
ports, sufficient currency is required to
keep all the industries of .the country
employed. Without thia, national as
well as individual bankruptcy must
ensue. Further inllation would but
lead to an inflation of prices. Specic
is the recognized medium of excuunge
the world over. That attained we shall
have obtained an exact degree of elas
ticity; if there be too much of it for
legitimate purposes of trade and com
merce it will flow out of the country ;
if too little the reverse will be the re
sult.
To hold what we have and to aj.prc
ciate the currency to that standard is the
problem deserving the most serious
consideration of Congress, lie says
that the panic has proved thru the
currency of the country, based as it is
on the credit of the nation,
ie the best that _ has ever
been devised. Elasticity m
monetary system is the object to be ob
tained ; and next to that, as far as yos
s ble, a prevention of the use of other
people's money in stock and other spe
cies uf speculations; to prevent tne
national banks from paying interest on
deposits by requiring them to ho.d their
resources, and bv forcing them into re
eumption, though it wou.d be only in
legal tender tote?. l-or tins purpose
he eucests the establishment o. a
clearing house. He submits wnether
it would not be best to authorize the
Secretary of the Treasury to issue at
any time to national banks any amount
of their own notes bi!o*v a tixea per
centage of their issue, say four P" cent,
upon banks depositing wi'.h the Treas
ury of the United States an amount o
government bonus equal to the amount
of notes demanded. The banks to ho.i
for the government say four p?r cento
the interest of the bonds so deposited
during the time they remain with the
Treasurer as security. *atd bonds to
be redeemable by the banks, either in
whole or part, by returning their own
bills for cancellation to an amount eqaa.
to the face of the bonds withdrawn.
He further suggests the propriety of
authorizing national banks to diminish
their outstanding issue at Peft*!1"
bv returning lor cancellation
their own bills and withdrawing
so m an v United States bonds as are
pledged for the bi Is returned. L is also
a question for consideration whe..u.
banking should not be made free, re
taining all the safe guards no* required
to secu'e bi!l holders, lie dlrcc<
attention to the ? ropriety o. exac(,n?
from banks the retention, a- a part o
their revenue, either the whole or part
0? the gold interest occrumg upon the
bonds pledged as security for their i-eue.
He hopes tor the adoption of the la. t
mentioned project to secure elasticity of
currencv for the country.andaj the same
time to "keep employed al. the inuu.
?es of the nation, and to prevent such
action ??i.l P'? ?? -
the resumption ol specie p?7iMnl. ? e
decision of Congrew on this .utjict
will have his hearty support.
Referring to the ruin of .ship I uildinir
be recommends 6iich legislation as wli
secure to us our prospects of the carry
ing trade. The subject of transporta
tion is next referred to He invite? at
tention to a cntal connecting Lake
Erie with the tide water of the Hudson
River and a similar work connecting
Lake Michigan with the navigable
waters and asks if it would not be wise
for the government to pledge the States
that if they will open these canals for
the pa-sage of large vessel?, the govern
ment wiil keep in navigable condition
the great public high ways with which
they connect.
Referring to the States south of the
United States as offering a field where
much might be accomplished, he sug
gests a small appropriation for a South
American expedition.
Referring again to the Treasury De
partment he recommends a revision
and certification ot the tariff laws and
the opening of more mints for coining
money for such nations as may apply
for it.
TheWafDepartment is next treated of.
He directs the especial attention or
Congress to preparing for war in time
of peace by preparing a proper arma
ment for cur sea coast de'ences, which
is vastly ot more importance than forti
fications. He also favors the reopen
ing of promotion in the etaff corps in
the army. Particularly is this necef-a
rv in the Medical ar.d Ordnance De
partment and the Paymasters Depart
ment.
Speaking of the Navy Department he
says the building o' eight new sloops
of war, as authorized by the last Con
gress, is doubly fortunate, as they are
about being completed at a time when
they m3y be needed. The occurances
in the waters of the Cuban seas lately,
illustrates forcibly the necessity of
maintaining the efficiciencv of onr
navy. He is assured that all the
available ships and every authorized
man in the American navy will be
ready for whatever action is required
to maintain our safety and honor.
In referring to the Postoffice Depart
ment he invites the attention of Con
gress to the suggestion ot the Postmas
her General for the establishment of
the free delivery where the population
is 10,000 ; also the pre-payment of post
age on newspapers and other printed
matter; and for uniform postage and
limit of weight on miscellaneous
matter. Especially does he urge a
favorable action by Congress on the ts?
tablishment of the United States Pcstai
Saving Bank. He also directs special
attention to a consideration of the ques
tion of postal telegraphs and the argu
ments adduced in support thereof.
lie also draws attention to af
fairs in Utah. To prevent an
archy it is absolutely necessary
thai Congress provide the Courts with
some mode of obtaining redress, and
also that probate courts of the territory
I be denied all jurisdiction not possessed
ordinarily by courts of that description.
He also f-ays, "I have become im
pre?sed with the belief that the act ap*
prove! March 2d, 1S67, entitled, 'an act
to establish a uniform system of bank
ruptcy throughout the United States,
is productive of more evil than good
at the present time." He comments
severely ou the clause relative to in
voluntary bankruptcy, and recommends
the repeal of this epecial clause.
Referring to the matter of the South
ern war and other claims he presumes
the new schemes proposed for legaliz
ing cut-lawed claims, As., will be re
ceived with but little favor bv Congress,
and recommends that persons having
claims against the United Slates, of a
just nature, be required to present them
at an early day, and that legislation be
directed as far as practicable to the de
feHtof unfounded and unjust claims.
The Interior Department and its
management is favorable commented
on, and a contir.ua:'Oii <-f the
peic? policy promised. i at; i're^iei.t
favors a territorial form of government
for the Indians, to secure their tr<-.?!y j
rights. Next lie speaks of more ro > -o
being wanted for the Patent Office De
partment. Speaking of the Penn o-i j
Bureau he asks for still further legieln- j
tion to prevent frauds, lie also com- |
ments favorably on the progress made j
by the Bureau of Education, and redi
rects attention to the project of a new I
census in 1S75. the reports of whicti
couid be completed and published be
fore the Centennial, and which would
prove valuable and interesting as show
in ' the progress of the country during
the first century of iis existence. He
a!i?o f:ivr>rj taking a censtt- regularly
every five v
Spt.ikij!^ ui District oi Columbia
he rt:e:8 to the many improvements
and eulogises the action of tlie officials j
thereof. He recommends a liberal
policv toward the District and believe*
that "the general government should
bear its share of the expense of the im
provements. He t uggeststhe establish
ment of an institution or university of
learning the highest claps in the
District. In relation to civil service re
form, the President ag&i.i commended
the attention of congress totheeubject
and suggests that a epecial committee
might confer with the Civil Service
Board during the present session, for
the purpose of devising euch rules as
can be maintained, and which will se
cure the service ot honest and capable
officials, and which will ali-o protect
them in a degree of independence.
He suggests the passage of nn ena
blir.g act, for the admittance of Colora?
do as a State, and recommends the en
couragement of a canal for the purpose
of navigation from the eastern elope of
the llockv Mountains to the Missouri
River. As a rule, he is opposed to
the further donation of public
Ian. Is for internal improvements con
trolled by private corporation*, but this
instance lie would rouke an exception.
The mefsace conclude?1; thus I renew
my previous "recommendations to Con
Cre-fl for general amnesty. The num
ber* engaged in the late rebellion, who
are laboring under disabilities, is very
small, but enough to keep up a con
slant irritation. No possible dancer
cat) a:?ruc to the Government by re
storing* them to eligibility to hold office.
I suggest for v our consideration the en
actment o a law to better ware the
civil rights which freedom should se
cure bat ha* not effectually secured to
the enfranchised slaves.

Gree.ksbcf.g, December 2. ? A most
brutal and cold blooded murder was
committed on last Sabbath evening
about* or '.'o'clock, in Franklin town'
ship, this county, about two and a half
miies west of Murraygville. A man
named Joseph Carr, a shoemaker,
about sixty years ot age, while eitting
in his shop on that evening, was struck
on the head with a heavy bludgeon,
aad his throat cut from ear to ear with
one of his own shoemaker knives, and
thus killed.
His pockets were rifled of iheir con
tents and he wa9 them left by the mur
derer. Suspicion rests on a young man
named Samuel Beighlev, who had been
working with Carr until the Thursday
previous. Be:gh!ey was found about 3
c clock on Monday morning sleeping in
the house of a man named South. The
reason why Beighley was suspected wa>
because his coat was found in the shoe
maker's shop with blood on it. When
he was arrested he bad the murdered
man's coat with him. Some 125 in
money, which had been taken from the
deceased, was also found upon his per
son.
We uuderstand be confessed that he
was one of two who had committed the
deed; that another man, name not
given, had struck Carr on the head and
that he, Beighley, had cut his throat,
and be showed the knife to the coroner
with which he had done the deed.
He was brought to Greensburg and
lodged in jail on Monday evening, to
await his trial. Beighley is only about
twenty-one years of age, and appears
to be as unconcerned as though he had
done nothing very wrong.

Removal of the State Capital? A
Voice From <?llmer County.
Gletville, Gilmbr Cocxty.W. Va., )
November 29, 1873, J
Editors Register.
It is predicted that the Legislature
will adjourn sine die about the 27th of
December, and as yet we bare heard
nothing relative to the removal of the
capitol. Caa it be possible that the
Legislature ii eo blind to the interests
of the State, and the wishes of its con- j
stitueacy, as to let this matter stand
over for the present? The cry here
tofore has been to let the Capitol re
main, we will soon have a railroad
running through the State to it by
which it will be accessible and subserve i
all the ends that are demanded. The
people bave become tired of such Aim-,
8y promises and demand that the seat
of government shall be located some
where that it will be accesible and they
can go to and from it at pleasure, with
out being compelled to travel over
country roads, muddy pikes, and bridle
pathways.
At present we are unable to bear
or know what the Legislature is doing
for weeks at a time, and before long
navigation will be, closed and we will
be groping in the dark as we were
last winter aB to what the law is ?r is
likely to be, nntil by chance some way
worn traveller who has become sick
and tired of the city of Charleston and
is wending his way either home or to
some point where he can hear what is
going on in outside world, informs us.
The inducements offered by Wheel
ing for the removal of
the Capitol tb that point
are sufficient and should
by all means be accepted. While
we are not favorable to Wheeling
for a permanent location of the capitol
we believe a temporary location of it
there for five or ten years will meet
with the approbation of four-fifths of
the people of this and the adjoining
counties. When the Legislature met at
Wheeling in years past, we could always
hear and know what was going on, and
we had no trouble 10 visit the capitol at
any time, but at present it is an under
taking that will make the bravest of
j hearts cower to think of the disadvanta
ges and sufferings that one has to un
dergo to reach the capitol.
There are many other and better
reasons for removing the capitol, but as
newspaper correspondence is not my
j forte, I will leave the matter to better
and more able advocates, and should
there be a doubt on the mind of our
representatives at Charleston as to the
wish of the people of Gilmer county on
the removal of the capitol, I will ven
ture to say that I can furnish them
with a petition from more than three
fourths of the voters of the county, favor
ing its immediate and unconditional re
moval. CiriZB.v.

A lilack and Tan BoS Tackles a
Turtle,
if anybody has seen a black and tan
dog, answering to the name of "Judge"
going down street in company with a
hardshell turtle, that won't answer to
anythingand certainly won't answer
to crackle, as the dog can tell you, if
you can get him to stop long enough,
please halt theeloping pair as they are
the property of the editor of this
paper. We are fondly attached to the
dog on account of his vagabondish, ?0
hemianish habits. He knows every dog
in Peoria by name, and ie on speaking
terms with nine-tenths of the granger
dogs that come in under the wagons
and he knows more of the inhabitants'
ThehJ?,St7 lb*D the UX col,ecw>r does.
Tt w. i ia,a more rece?t acquaition.
It was placed in the backvard, and the
dog spent an hour and a half trying to
entice it to come out of its shell and be
sociable. The old ironclad maintain
ed his reserve, however, nntil the doe
crammed his nose against the forward
part and began to sniff. The pair
seemed to come to some sort of under
standing at once, for the dog made an
impetuous remark on avervhighkev
and they both -taited on a* trip after
Donaldson s galloon. When the doe
jumped over *isher'? barn we thought
: e had struck the eastern current and
wou.d get right through, bat we learn
since that he landed and was geen
sauntermg along like a whirlwiod the
turtle staving right by him. We should
be very sorry to lose the dog now as he
ba? acquired another important and ral- '
uable quality. He knows more about1
turtles than any other dog in the coun
lit ! snug, hty hard to find a real
good turtle dog.?Ptoria Review.
