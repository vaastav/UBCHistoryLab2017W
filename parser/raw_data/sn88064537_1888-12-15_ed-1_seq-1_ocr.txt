discrimination in the treatment ttt the peo
ple by thei Government, The citizen of
our ivepublic in its early days rigidly insist
ed upon full compliance with the letter of this
bond, nnd saw stretching out before him a
clear field for individual endeavor. His tribute
to the support of his Government was meas
ured by the cost of its economical mainte
nance, and he was secure in the enjoyment
of the recompense of his steady tribute and
contented in it. In those days "the frugality
of the peopie was stamped upon their Govern
ment, and was enforced by the free, thoughtful
and intelligent suffrage of the citizen. Combina
tions, monopolies and aggregations of capital
were either avoided or sternly regulated and
restrained. T:.e pomp and glitter at. govern

side by side in frien tly competition, wrought

vO inquire, at the present stage of our progress,
now the bond of the Government made with
the people has been kept and performed. In

people must still be taxed for the support of
the Government under the operation of tariff
laws. But to the extent that tile mass of our
citizens are inordinately burdened beyond any
useful public purpose and for the benefit of a
favored few, the Government, under pretest of
an exercise of its taxing power, enteïs gratuit
ously into partnership with these favorites
to their advantage and to the
jury of a vast majority of our
people. This is not equality tw
fore tho law. The existing situation is in
r. °'A S t0 ttic health of our entire body politic,
it stifles in those for whose benefit it is per
mitted all patriotic iove of country and substi
tutes in its place selfish greed and erraspmar
avarice. -
Devotion to American citizenship tor its own
sake, and for what it should accomplish as a
motive to our Nation's' advancement and the
happiness of all our people, is displaced by the
assumption that tbe Government, instead of
Oeing the embodiment of equality, is but an In
sîru mentality through which especial and
individual advantages are to be gained,
ihe arrogance of this assumption is
unconcealed. It appears in the sordid dis
regard of all but personal interests in the re
fusal to abate for the benefit of others one iota
of selfish advantage, and in combinations to
perpetuate such advantages through efforts to
control legislation and improperly influence the
suffrages of the people. The grievances of
those not included within the circle of these
beneficiaries, when fully realized, will surely
arouse irritation and discontent. Our farm
ers, long-suffering and patient, struggling
in the race of life with the hardest and most
unremitting toil, will not fa.il to see, in spite of
^representations and misleading fallacies
■hat they are obliged to accept such p rices for

tt can not be denied that thb gfelflsh
Und prh'âte interests which are so persistently
heard, when efforts are made to deal in a just
and comprehensive manner with our tariff
laws, are related to, if they are
not responsible for, the sentiment
largely prevailing among the people that the
general Government isjthe fountain of individ
ual and private aid; that it may be expected
to relieve with paternal euro the distress of
Citizens and communities, and that from the
fullness of its treasury it shoüld, upon the
slightest possible pretext of promoting the
general good, apply public funds to the benefit
of localities and individuals. Nor can
it be denied that there is a growing
assumption that, as against the Government
and in favor of priVato claims and interests;
the tisdal rules and limitations of business
principles and just dealing should be waived.
These ideas have been unhappily much en
couraged by legislativejacquiescence. Relief
from Contracts made with the Government is
too easily accorded in favor d! the citizen, as
the failure to support claims against the Gov
ernment by proof is often supplied by no bet
ter consideration than the wealth of the Gov
ernment and the poverty of the claimant.
Gratuities in form of pensions are granted
on no other real ground than the
needy condition of the applicant, or for reasons
less valid; and large sums are expended for
