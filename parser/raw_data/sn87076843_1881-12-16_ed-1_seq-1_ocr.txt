A Vienna dispatch on tho 10th stated
that further Inquiries as to the origin of the
fire In the Ring Theater established the fact
that the. persons Instructed with the duties ot

first blaze; another fearing that an explosion
would occur turned oil the gas, plunging the
theater Into total darkness until it became Il
luminated with the blazeot the conflagration.
When the fire brigade arrived It was found
Impossible to penetrate beyond tha first tier
of the. theater, because ot the suffocating
smoke and air extinguishing lamps and
torches. The firemen retired under the mo
mentary Impression that because their shouts
were not answered there wero no more peo
ple In tbe theater. Those who escaped on
the first alarm, however, soon undeceived
them. Another effort was made to pene
trate the rarts of tbe theater which
were not actually blazing. In a nar
row passage between the second and
third galleries, a mass ot corpses was discov
ered, some so closely Interlocked that It was
hardly I osslble to part them. The first man
discovered was gotout alive, but all the rest
were dead. These were persons who had lost
their way In consequence of the tnrnlng off
of the gas. Some men were tonnd with their
hands grasping each other's throats. Subse
quent investigation showed that in some cases
persons, finding escape hopeless, committed
suicide. It Is stated bv survivors that women
were seen to throw their children from gal
leries Into the pit at the time ot the outbreak
of flumes. The gallery especially allotted to
ladles was full. The official list published on

Between two nnd Ibreo o'clock this morning
a frnmo boarding houso located on tho lino of

tho explosion of n lamp, nnd of forty persons
known to bo sleeping In it,only thirty escaped
allvo, and oven they wcro nil nioro or less
burned, nnd not ono of them succeeded In se
curing his clothes, so rapid wns tho progress
of tho limnes. The others wore literally roust
ed todenth without tlio rosslbllltyot nn effort
being made to ro-cuo them. Tho building In
which tho flro occurred, as stated nbnvo, w ns
locntcd about seven miles from tlio city ntn
placo called Cut Rock, nnd wni owned by
Martin Joyco, contractor, hut was tinder tho
management of n Mr. McCune, us boiiullng
house keeper. It wns olmut thirty feet wldo
and nrty feet In length, and constmcted
of nlxtocn-foot boards placed on end. It
had a board roof with n very otcep pltrbt
and tho loft formed by tho sloping roof was
tho plaeo In which laborers wore huddled for
tho night. In tho lower story wis tbo dining
room, nnd nt ono end of tlio building wns the
kitchen. Tho stairs leading to tho loft wcro
llttlo better than n ladder, and wero loeuted
justntthosldooC tho door lending from tho

doors so ns to keep out the chill night nlr. lu
this dark loftsomo forty-three men wcro sup
posed to havo slept last night. At least, that
number wcro ht supper last avcnlng nnd nono
wcro reported away when thohourrorvctiriug
came.
Tbo origin or tho flames which wroughtsuch
tcrriblo destruction to human llfo, nnd which
caused such ngnny to thoso who escaped from
tbo drath-trap, was the upsetting und orpin,
slonof a kcroscno oil lamp. Tho story, as told
by nn eye witness of tho flrp.wns substantially
as follows:
Between two and three o'clock, this morn-IngMcCuncthobonrdlng-bouso

Whllo be was gono thu explosion occurred,
and lu an Instant the dining room wns filled
wllh flames. McCuno succeeded In escaping
with bis wlfo and tho girls, but could not do
mora than call upon thoso tip stnlrs to ecnpo
for their lives. In anolhcrmomcnt tho flames
bad enveloped the stairway, thus cutting oil
tho means of escape for tbo doomed man
above, except through tho small openings at
cither end, nnd from these the eliding doors
bad ta ba remov ed. Tho lot t wan tilled with
I straw and combustible material used In tha
bedding, and only thoso who wcro nearest ta
tbo openings could make their escape The
occurrences in tho rooms, on nroount of tbe
stilling smoko, which even tba lurid Unmcs
that rapidly licked up tho floor nnd filled the
loft did not penetrate, and tccause ofwblcb
nothing but forms in a soml-nudo condition
could Losccn.bafllc description. Twenty-three
of tho occurants or tho loft succeeded in
squeezing' through tho openings, boiuo wltb
their underclothes on flro. Tbo others rushed
frnnticnlly about tbe room, first to ono end nnd
then to tbo other, their location being known
by their cries until tho smoke suffocated them
and their voices were stilled.
In less time than It takes to tell it, tha build
ing was wrapped in sheets ot Uro, and the
survivors could only writhe in pain nnd shly-i

ing down scats was heard on all sides. Thi
boxes were still empty, but tho balcony am)
galleries were well filled. On tha stag
everything was In a state ot ae
tlvlty and hustle, tlio worklngmcn re
moving scenery, etc Offenbach's comlt
opera, " Les Countcs D'lloffman," was to ba
performed for the second time. Borne of th
singers and nctois had already taken ttieli
places on the stngc In costume, but a larg)
number were still In the dressing-rooms In Hi'
hands of the costttnicrs and halr-drosscrs. Thi
overture had not yet begun. .How the fiii
commenced cannot jet be definitely stated
and piobahly It will never be known. Accord
ing to ouo version the scenery was Ignited bj
a spark from electric machinery. Accordant
to another, a workman with an alcohol lam
caused tho disaster. The former version li
the more likely one. Director llelemes
berger, who stood upon the stage, was tht
first to notice tha fire. A moment after tin
"flics" were wrapped In flames and the neb
work of wood, ropes and canvas was burning
like tinder. The people on the stage wen
stupefied with fear at first, and they''4peedUj
took to flight tn most terrible confusion to
ward the ladles' dressing-rooms, on tha left ol
the stage, whero a small staircase led to
Hohenstaufen Strassc. In a moment the cur
tain flew up and a draft blew It hither and
thither until, Ilka a fiery tongue, It darted
back and forth from the auditorium to the
stage. The fire then became master ot the
Ring Theater,
"Fit el flro I the Ring Theater Is on Are I"
was tho cry that went from mouth to ear.
On Ring Strassc. tho flames were already
bursting through the roof, and cries, such as
Vienna never heard before, filled it. They
seemed not like the cries of human beings,
but such aw Inl accents as can bo heard only
In a death struggle. The scene was Indescrib
able, all those Inside the fated building
pushing their way toward tho street, which
was crowded at all points. Tho audience
frtjm the theater struggled and crushed each
other, and coufttsion relgrctl supreme. Bud--deuly
cries wcro heard from tho windows of
the theater leudlng to the Ring. The balcony
over the entrance was soon emptied, and the
erica of those nt the windows and ot those
within tho theater were awful, and swelled
louder and louder. The mass of people In the
street was growing denser constantly."
The follow Ing Is the narrative of LTerrLlnd
man, an actor engaged In tho theater: "It
was 0:45, and thu second signal had been
given to the actors that lu a quarter of an
hour tho performance would begin. I was In
my dressing-room, and on hearing the alarm
I rushed on the stage und found myself In a
sea of flames. A violent draught of air rose
and a perfect column ot fire seemed to rush
against thecurtains, which it quickly pierced.
Then a stream ol fire poured Into the theater
and up to the galleries. I only heart a single
horrlf) ing stream u single cry of unspeak
able terror and fearful despair.'
He then described tha eccno of tho members
of the chorus flying to reach the doorway and
escape from tho fire.
Inspector Nltznc escaped from his dwelling
Jn the upper story, lie describes tho fearful
scene tn the auditorium ns follows: "Tho
people lay there in' heaps, and many In tlio
strangest postures. Some had their hands
stretched out Imploringly, and there w ere oth
ers whose mils wctcdilvcn into the flesh la.
pain and despair."
A lady ho vt as In the third row of the par
qucttc at the time ot the disaster sap: "I
was just about tu take out my opera-glass
from Its ctsc, when suddenly I remarked
that the cmUIn was dilvcn out violently
tow aril me. A sheet of lire poured out im
mediately after orcr thu seats. I grasped
my ft lend by the, ami and hurried ton aid tho
central enhance, but In a moment all tha
lights were extinguished, and we were In com
plete darkness. Only by keeping a firm hold
of the rolling wcro wo enabled togiopoour
way down tha slilmay. Suddenly, to my
horror, I found that my f i lend no longer clung
to mc. I sere lined out her name, and, to my
delight, I w as answ crcd, She caught hold ot
me again, and wo were, crushed out through
the d tikness with the living moss ot fugitives

the general desire that no State North or
South shall Btain tlio American name by i
tho foul blot of repudiation. But when ,
the coalition party in Virginia promul

education, tlio abolition of obnoxious'
and unjust laws against tltocoloredmeni
and demanded a fair election and an
