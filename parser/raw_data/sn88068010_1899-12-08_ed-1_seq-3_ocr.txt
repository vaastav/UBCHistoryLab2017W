British Relief Column Has Crossed
Modder River.
FOUNDRY CASTING SHELLS.
It la Believed There Is . a Scarcity of
Ammunition in the .Besieged City
ISoers Are Still Firing on Ladysmith
Details of Recent Battle.
London, Dec. 5. It is reported that
Modder river bridge has been repaired,
an-d that the British resumed their
march toward Kimberley today.
The fact that the De Beers mines
foundry is casting- shells while the gar
rison seldom replies to the Boers' ar
tillery is said to point to a scarcity of
ammunition at Kimberley, partially
accounting for Gen. Methuen's haste.
All the news from Natal emphasizes
the difficulties before Gen. Clery. There
is growing a belief that some delicate
flanking operation has been intrusted
to some tactician, while Gen. Hildyard
carries out the direct front demonstra
tion. The latest advices from Ladysmith,
dated Saturday, Nov. 23, say the shell
ing of that place was continued. It
also appears that Gen. Schalkburgher,
commanding the Boers, sent a message
suggesting that all the wounded be
sent to a neutral camp, and that Gen.
White peremptorily refused, when, it
is added, the Boers deliberately shelled
the hospital.
All accounts agree that the Boer
shells were much more damaging than
previously. A number of civilians and
police were killed or wounded, while
the Liverpool and Gloucester battalions
lost eleven men Nov. 24.
The siege of Ladysmith was then
growing stronger. The Boers were
estimated to number from 10,000 to
15,000 men. The health of the British
garrison was good.
The Boer force at Colenso Is esti
mated to be 15,000 men, with fifteen
.guns.
Friday's News.
Dec. 1. Gen. Methuen has urgently
called for more troops.
Anxiety increases in London a3 the
hours go by without bringing news of
his situation.
The names of a number of officers
.killed and wounded have been sent by
Gen. Methuen.
Gen. Methuen himself was slightly
wounded, being struck in the thigh by
a bullet,.
It is known that his situation is a
perilous one, and the failure to receive
reassuring advices and the doubt as to
his real position after the battle of last
Tuesday ,"iserve to throng the war office
with anxious inquirers.
The positions of Generals French
and Gatacre in Northern Cape Colony
also is a difficult one. A dispatch says
that the Boers are gathering in great
force to oppose them while the British
are few in number.
A description of the siege of Lady
smith from November 16 to 20, written
Sn the invested city, shows that the
British are not worrying over their
; isolation. ' f '
i The Boersvbombardment is ridi
culed, i. It is described as languid.
Few casualties have been sustained
and the reports of great damage done
to the Boers also are discredited.
It is believed at Estcourt that the
Bores have blown up the Tugela River
Bridge.
Gen. Lord Wolseley announces that
another division of British troops will
be called out. This makes the seventh.
Colonial Secretary Chamberlain in a
speech at Liecester yesterday noon,
made a tAea for an alliance of the
Anglo-American-Tuetonic races "to
rule the world." He said that it al
ready existed in spirit.
Saturday's News.
Dec. 2. British losses in the battle
of Moder River are reported in a dis
patch from Pretoria to have been tre
mendous. One dispatch sa3rs that 2,000 British
fell. This has not yet been confirmed.
Gen. Cronje has been withdrawn
from Mafeking and is in command of
the Boers at Modder River.
" Gen. Methuen has sent no further
communication to the war office, and
it is not known whether he has at
tempted to resume his advance to the
relief of Kimberley.
Advices from Natal indicate that the
Boers are making every preparation
for a big battle at Tugela River.
They also have posted big guns at
Newcastle and are ready to contest
every foot of the British advance.
The Boers are charged by the Brit
ish with indulging in much wanton
destruction of property throughout the
portions of Natal which they have
traversed.
The shutting down of the South
African cables effectually conceals the
latest movements of the British com
mands in Natal, Northern Cape Col
ony and at Modder river.
The sentiment in England is that the
Seventh Division of Infantry has not
been called out a moment too soon.
Shrapnel Shells Ordered.
Ixmdon, Dec. 4. The government
has ordered from a private firm 1,00 d
nine-ponud shrapnel shells to be de
livered weekly until March 25.
London, Dec. 4. Gen. Sir Charles
Mansfield Clarke will command the
new Sixth division, destined for serv
ice, in South Africa.
SteynIura: Bridge Down.
Cape Town, Dec. 4. Traffic between
East London and Stormberg is inter
rupted, owing to the destruction of the
.Stcynsburg bridge.
Sunday's News.
Sunday Dec. 3. Methuen's force, ac
cording- to the best information, is still
encamped south of the Modder River,
lie is repairing- the bridge there.
A dispatch from Cape Town says
that the Boers have retreated tc
Spytfontein, where they will make
their next stand against Methuen.
Gen. Gatacre has marched thirty
miles north from Queenstown, Cape
Colony. No engagement is reported
between his force and the Boers in that
neighborhood.
Gen. French is nearing Colesburg.
There is no light on the situation in
Natal.
The main British force was at Frere,
twenty miles south of Ladysmith, last
Tuesday. A battle between Joubert's
main army and the British at Colenso
was then expected, but has not been
reported.
The last advices concerning Lady
smith are nearly a week old.
London already feels the pinch of
war. It is generally agreed there now
that it will be anything but a proces
sion to Pretoria.
(Jen. Buller's plans have undergone
complete change since he took the field
and realized the Boers" strength.
Monday's News.
Pec. 4. On the day of the battle at
Gra.s Pan, Saturday, November 25. the
Kimberley garrison sortied, killing
nine and wounding seventeen Boers.
On the day of the battle at Modder
river, last Tuesday, the British again
went out from Kimberley, attacking
and capturing the Boers" laager, west
of Kimberle3.
This seems to indicate that the two
British forces are acting in unison.
Methuen's force is communicating with
the Kimberley garrison by means of
searchlights.
The Boers' main army is concentra
ting near Chieveley station, where the
armored train fight, in which Winston
Churchill was captured, took place.
They intend to dispute the passage
of the Tugela.
The transport Lismore is ashore in
the bay of St. Helena. The troops
have been landed.
Tuesday's JTw.
Dec. 5. Dispatches indicate that
Gen. Methuen has resumed his advance
to the relief of Kimberley.
A message received in London from
an officer of the guard says: "In Kim
berley." This is taken to mean that
Methuen's vanguard has reached there.
Julian Ralph, in his account of the
Modder river battle, says that the in
fantry never once saw the Boers, yet,
if they stood up, they were riddled.
British artillery won the fight, in his
opinion.
A decisive battle is imminent oppo
site Colenso on the Tugela. It is esti
mated that Joubert has from 15,000 to
20,000 troops there, with 10,000 more at
Ladysmith, to hold White in check.
The British are repairing the bridge
near Frere. . : V
The Boers' bombardment of Lady
smith has become heavier within the
last few days.
Up to November 25, the British casu
alties in Ladysmith had been eighty-
three killed and wounded. - 5
The British transport-" Lismore went
to pieces on the rocks of St. Helena
Bay. The troops were rescued, but
350 horses and some guns &ad other
supplies were lost. .
American surgeons and nxtrses were
presented to Queen Victoria at Wind
sor yesterday.
Premier Salisbury is much perturbed
over Chamberlain's speech for an al
liance. Wednesday's Ncwi.
Dec. C. The Boers did not retreat
far from Modder River.
They have taken up a position six
miles from the scene of the last battle
and are intrenched on a strong ridge.
The British Lancers were in touch
with them there last Thursday.
The delay of Methuen's advance
probably is explained by his effort to
get up food supplies for the relief of
Kimberley before beginning the final
march to that city.
Gen. Gatacre is reported to have
been in conflict with the Boers in the
Stormberg district in Northern Cape
Colony. The result of the battle is not
known.
It is planned for Gaiacre to invade
the Free State from the south at the
time that Methuen marches in from
the west. If Buller i.-j successful
against Joubert in Natal he may in
vade from the east; thus the British
main advance would be through the
Free State, instead of by way of Lang's
Nek.
Gen. Buller's army in the Frere
C"mp is estimated at 24,000 men. Jou
bert has from 15,000 to 20,000, with
10,000 mord at Ladysmith.
The British plan is figured by Lon
don military experts to be to astempt
a flanking movement against Joubert,
who is north of the Tuffela, opposite
Colenso, in a strong position.
Micrim May Be Believed.
Washington, Dec. 1. Nothing has
been heard from United States Consul
iiacrum at Pretoria for the last five
days. The state department would
like to be able to relieve him in ac
cordance with his request, and will do
so if it is possible to send a man
through the lines.
Colleges End Their Quarrel.
Chicago, Dec. 4. The western Inter
collegiate athletic disagreement is
ended and the University of Chicago
win play Wisconsin in Madison next
Saturday for the western football
championship. Representatives of the
warring universities announced this at
the annual conference of faculty repre
sentatives of the western colleges held
at the Chicago Beach hotel all day
Thursday. The arrangements are
comprehensive and seem to provide
for all future relations between Chi- '
cago, Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois.

Armed Filipinos Surrender at
Bayombong,
BRAVERY OF LIEUT. M0?1R0E.
On of the Heaviest Blows Dealt to the
Rebels During: the War Credited to
This OSlcer American Troops Con
tllae to Advance.
Manila, Dec. 4. The surrender of S00
armed insurgents at Bayombong, in'
Nueva Viscaya province, to Lieut.
Munroe of the Fourth cavalry was the
result of one of the most remarkable
feats of courage and "bluff" of the war.
Lieut. Munroe had but fifty men and
hi3 re-enforcements were far in the
rear. Notwithstanding this, he com
municated telegraphically with the in
surgent general, Conon, stating that he
was ready to move immediately with
a large force of cavalry against him
unless he should surrender uncondi
tionally. Lietrt. Munroe next wired
south for re-enforcements. Twenty
four hours before the re-enforcements
arrived he went with his small escort
to Bayombong and accepted the sur
render of the garrison.
Irjest Force Yet Tnlten.
Washington, Dec. 4. Considerable
interest is felt here in the news that
the Insurgents at Eaj'onibong have
surrendered, particularly as the num
ber is said to exceed that captured by
the United States troops at any one
time. Bayombong is the city to which
Aguinaldo at one time contemplated
retreating for the purpose of locating
the rebel capital after he was forced to
flee from Tarlac, but the American
troops pressed him so hard that he wa3
unable to carry out hi3 intention. No
information regarding the surrender
has been received at the war depart
ment. Word comes from the Philippines
that the two companies of Macabebe
scouts under Capt. Batson are doing
so "well that it has been decided to or
ganize a full battalion of those natives.
The additional two companies will be
very useful in the present campaign in
tracking the fleeing remnants of Agul-
naldo's disorganized army.
GEN. WOOD HAS BEEN CHOSEN
President ZIIcKInley to Give II I m Supreme
Cbarce of Cuba.
Washington, Dec. 4. Gen. Leonard
Wood will be the master of all Cuba
under the direction of the president
until the time comes when congress
takes action by providing a new civil
government for the island.
Gn. Wood is not to be called offi
cially "civil governor." He will be
military governor,- In supreme com
mand of the island, but in the absence
of any insurrection or trouble and
none is expected by the administration
his duties will chiefly be civil.
Gen. Wood is to have the rank of
major general of volunteers, which
will enable him to outrank the regu
lar army officers who remain in Cuba
under his command.
Some of the generals now there are
to be withdrawn, and those who re
main will be placed under Gen. Wood's
orders.
CAMPOS FEARS FOR MONARCHY.
Supporter of the Dynasty Said to Have
Abandoned All Hope.
Madrid, Dec. 4. Two hundred and
forty commercial and industrial asso
ciations of Spain have declared their
determination not to pay taxes. El
Imparcial, the monarchist organ, says
the month of December will be a de
cisive month in the history of Spain.
Violent public meetings, protesting
against the government's taxation
scheme, are being held in several parts
of the country. Close friends of Gen.
Martinez Campos say he has lost all
hope of saving the monarchy, the
minority In the cortes showing the
most determined opposition to the
dynasty and the government. General
confusion exists on all sides and on all
questions.
First Victims of the Law.
Philadelphia, Pa., Dec. 4 After a
legal battle in the United States
courts covering a period of over two
years Joseph Wilkins of Washington
and Howard Butler of this city were
sent to prison to serve sentences im
posed upon them for having violated
the law regarding the sale of oleomar
garine. Wilkins was recently sen
tenced to imprisonment for six
months and to pay a fine of $1,500,
and Butler to four months' Imprison
ment and a fine of $500. The case is
of national importance, as Wilkins
and Butler are the first to be sent to
prison for violating the oleomargarine
laws.
Determined to AM the Roers.
Strasburg, Dec. 4. Retired officers
of the German army are continuing to
seek service in the army of the Boers.
Col. von Braum, formerly command- j
er of the Ninth dragoons; Capt. Weid- ;
ner, late of the Twenty-ninth infan- ,
try: ex-Lieut, von Brusewitz, and sev- i
eral military surgeons have just left
for the front.
Hay Says There Is 'o Alliance.
Washington, Dec. 4. Secretary Hay
declined to discuss the speech of Jo
seph Chamberlain in which the Brit
ish secretary of state for the colonies
declared that the "union, the alliance,
if you please, the understanding be
tween these two great nations (Great
Britain and America) is, indeed, a
guarantee of the peace of the world."
The secretary of state said, however,
"there could be no alliance, and if
there is an understanding, I do not
know of it. I have not been consulted."
SECRETARY ROOT'S REPORT.
Ran of Government for Torto It.co Ii
Outlined.
Washington, Dec. 4. Tha annual
report of Elihu Root, secretary of wr,
"was made public Friday.
An important feature of the report
Is a comprehensive outline of a plan
of government for Porto Rico. It la
understood that President McKinley La
In entire accord with Secretary Root
on this question, and that the plau out
lined by the secretary will be the iden
tical plan which the president will
recommend to congress in his annual
message.
Secretary Root says the inhabitants
of the island are incapable of self-government.
His plan is to have a gov
ernor, to be appointed by the presi
dent, with the consent of the senate,
also minor officials, such as a secretary
of state, etc., to be appointed in the
same manner. They will form the ad
ministrative council, which will also
be composed of a minority member
ship, to be appointed by the president
from the residents of the island.
The secretary considers it too early
to establish a local legislature, giving
the inhabitants the franchise only in
municipal affairs.
Abolition of the duties between the
United States and Porto Rico is recom
mended. The secretary declares in favor of a
cable from the United States to the
Philippines, via Hawaii and Guam.
Among his other recommendations
is one that Gen. Shafter be retired,
with the full rank of major-general.
The appropriations for the year end
ing June 30, 1900, were made cn a
basis of a military force which, has
been greatly exceeded by the exercise
of the authority conferred under the
act of March 2, 1S99, and the raising,
equipping and transporting to the
Philippines of additional troops and
supplies.
It will, therefore, be necessary to
ask congress for a deficiency appro
priation for the current year up to
about the amount of the estimates
"which have been submitted for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1901. This
will not be altogether a new appro
priation in any but a technical sense,
as more than two-thirds of the sum
can be made available by the reappro
priation of sums which have once
been appropriated for purposes of the
war with Spain, and which the speedy
termination of that war has enabled
the department to save and report a3
unpledged.
STATEMENT BY HITCHCOCK.
Secretary of the Interior Review. Ra
tional A Hairs.
Washington, Dec. 4. The annual re
port of Secretary of the Interior Hitch
cock, while summing up the work In
all the bureaus, is of special interest
by reason of its statements regarding
pension policies. At the close of the
fiscal year there were 991,619 pension
ers, a decrease of 2,195 during the year.
The average annual value of all pen
sions was $132.74. The Spanish war
probably will increase the pension roll
during ,the current fiscal year. The
secretary concurs in the recommenda
tions for legislation providing that no
pension, be granted to commence prior
to the date of filing the claim; for an
early revision and codification of the
pension laws, as the numerous amend
atory laws and decisions have mads
the whole system a labyrinth of laws
and legal opinions. Secretary Hitch
cock urges legislation to definitely con
strue the act of June 27, 1S90, relating
to widows' pensions.
The report estimates the irrigable
area of the arid region of the United
States at 74,000,000 acres, capable of
comfortably supporting under a prop
er irrigation system 50,000,000 people.
Reasonable expenditures both by the
federal and state government looking
to a well-defined Irrigation system
are urged. Nearly fifty proposed new
forest reserves or additions to those
already established are under consid
eration. The Dawes commission re
ports the time has not yet arrived for
the installation of a territorial or state
government in Indian territory, owing
mainly to lack of uniform land tenure.
Attention 13 called to the phenome
nal increase in railway traffic In the
last two year3, amounting approxi
mately in Increased earnings in 1899
over 1898 to $9,000,000, and the pre
vious year to $23,000,000. the increase
being only limited by the lack of cars
to carry products.
Itegln Fljjht on Roberts.
Washington, Dec. 4. At a confer
ence of twenty-five prominent house
republicans, held at the capitol Friday
night, it was decided that the eligibili
ty of Representative-elect Roberts of
Utah to occupy a seat in the house of
representatives should be investigat
ed and determined and that pending
the decision he should not be per
mitted to take the oath of office.
Action to Oust Lead Trnst.
St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 4. The state
authorities have declared war on the
lead trust. Friday Atty.-Gen. Crow
began proceedings in the St. Louis
Court of Appeals to have the National
Lead company excluded from the priv
ilege of doing business in Missouri on
the ground that it is a trust.
Opposes Seatlns of Qnay.
Pittsburg, Pa., Dec. 4. The demo
cratic state executive committee has
made a public memorial addressed to
the democratic members of the United
States senate, giving the reasons why
it is opposed to Matthew S. Quay be
ing permitted to take his seat in that
body. The gist of the argument is
that Mr. Quay was unable to secure
election by the legislature, and that
the governor violated the law of the
state in appointing him instead of
calling a special session of the legis
lature to fill the vacancy.
MISSOURI MANUAL OUT.
Demand for the Hook Kxeeeds the Sap
ply Cause of Delay.
The Missouri State Manual, prepared
by Secretary of State Lesueur, is now
being distributed.
Secretary Lesueur desires to say, in
response to the urg-ent inquiries for
copies of the Missouri Manual, that
the publication of the book has been a
little delayed by reason of the print
ing of the Revised Statutes, but, as a
matter of fact, that it is issued for two
years and, ordinarily, distributed in
October. The book is printed and a
sufficient number has been bound to
mak e the distribution to the newspa
pers. The other distributions will fol
low as rapidly as the book can be dried
in the bindery.
The manual has been prepared with
great care. It is about the same size
that it was two 3-ears ag-o, having
eight pag-es more, and is tilled with
valuable statistics and information,
principally, of course, in relation to
Missouri. The demand for it very far
exceeds the supply.
MISSOURI BANKS.
Secretary Lesneur Comments on Their
Strong Condition.
Secretary of State Lesueur has just
concluded a tour of inspection of the
work performed by the three bank ex
aminers under him. He says that tho
banks of Missouri all have a great
abundance of money on hand and that
it has been a difficult matter to loan it
at a profit. In his opinion, this con
dition will chang-e pretty soon, as
money will be in demand for moving
cattle and hogs.
There has not been a serious bank
failure in Missouri in a long- time, and
the secretary is disposed to believe that
this is largely due to the banking
laws, under which wild-cat concerns
are not able to organize, or if once or
ganized under false pretenses cannot
long continue business until they are
closed up.
Evangelist Under Arrest.
Rev. D. R. White, a colored evangel
ist from St. Louis, did not fill his ap
pointment to preach at the Park Baptist
church in Palmj-ra Sunday, for the
reason that he had an engagement in
the county jail, which the sheriff de
clined to permit him to break. Sat
urday night in a crowded dry goods
store he was caught in the act of shop
lifting and was promptly arrested and
locked up. White wore a new suit of
clothes, an ulster and patent leather
shoes. In one coat pocket he had the
manuscript for the sermon he was to
preach Sunday and in another a half
empty bottle of whisky. He will be
arraigned on a charge of shoplifting.
Ifegro Shot by an Officer.
Officer John Mohr shot and instantly
killed James Simmons, a negro, Sun
day morning about 3:30 o'clock, as he
was attempting to escape arrest. The
killing occurred in the alley back of
the residence of E. P. Bell, 3935 West
Belle place. Sr. Louis, and was the cul
mination of a sensationcil scene on an
Olive street owl car, and a subsequent
man hunt. The negro and two ne-
gresses boarded the car and made
trouble because none of the white men
offered the negro women seats. One
white man remonstrated and was shot
at by the negro. Officers then pursued
the negro and shot him because he re
fused to submit to arrest.
I.oals Kllliaa Uannd Over.
Louis Killian, who shot and killed
Charles R. Gideon in a saloon at Twenty-third
and Chestnut streets, St. Louis,
two months ago, was bound over to
the grand jury in the sum of S3, 000 on
a charge of murder in the second de
gree. Killian promptly renewed his
bond and was released. The defend
ant pleaded self-defense, lie testified
that he was shooting at a man who
was rushing at him with a chair when
Gideon came between them and re
ceived the bullet. Gideon was a med
ical student from Springfield, Mo. His
relatives are prosecuting the case.

HAS HAD ENOUGH. !
Mother of Aguinaldo Interviewed
Manila.
Manila, Dec. 5. Aguinaldo's mother
says that she desires nothing but peace.
She is glad from the bottom of her
heart that the insurrection is near an
end.
Aguinaldo, she says, is not sufficient
ly civilized to keep from being misled
by bad counsel from his ministers and
congress, a majority of whom con
stantly declare for war against Aguin
aldo's personal wishes to the contrary.
She is immensely gratified at the
kind treatment of herself and Aguin
aldo's son by the Americans. She be
lieved they would be shot, and tried to
keep the identity of her grandson con
cealed. Aguinaldo's mother says that the
death of his baby, recently born, was
due to falling from a narse's arms, and
was not, as had been reported, the re
sult of exposure during the retreat of
the Filipinos.
She adds that the women and
officers' families are suffering fearful
deprivations and hardships. She de
clares she does not know Aguinaldo's
present whereabouts nor his ultimate
destination.
Aguinaldo May be Located.
Manila, Dec. 5. An Associated Tress
dispatch from Dagupau, containing
late advices, says that Gen. Young
hopes to find Aguinaldo in Benguet
Mountain Pass, and to capture him
there. Both entrances to Benguet aro
fortified. Two troops of the Third
Cavalry will re-enforce (Jen. Young in

him. He is received by the natives
vith brass bands and offerings of food.
He reached Santa Cruz yesterday.
