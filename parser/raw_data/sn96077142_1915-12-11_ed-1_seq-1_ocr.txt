SEAL SALE BEGE1S '
DI DARAGA C0UI1TY.
In the war abroad, the Red Croaa
ministers to the wounded and dying. In
oar country the Red Cross Christmas
Seals bring relief to those who are
suffering and dying from tuberculosis,
and also defense against this enemy.
Since tuberculosis is preventable and
curable, the death rate from this di
sease has already been reduced one-half,
largely through the work accomplished
by the proceeds from the seal sale.
The general public has come to a
better knowledge of the campaign that
is being waged for improving the health
of our citizens, and this h been largely
: IBS
through the missionary work done by
the little Red Cross Christmas Seal.
The Michigan Anti-Tuberculosis As
sociation officers state that, wholly
aside from the financial benefits derived
from the sale of seals, the educational
value would fully warrant the vast ex
penditure of time, thought and effort
"' necessary' (b, conduct th is sat. .These
."cheery holiday tokens,' so appropriate
on correspondence and packages now,
are sold at 1 cent each, to raise money
required in local and state-wide work of
. . education and prevention, and relief
and cure. v.' .
. The seals have been put on sale In
Baraga county In several stores in each
" village and through the schools. Every
one is urged to buy and use them, as it
is a splendid opportunity to participate
in the campaign against tuberculosis.
' Michigan's Red Cross Seal record is
as follows: '
- x- 1911 754,210 seals sold.,
1912- 1,125.818 seals sold. '
1913- 1.656,173 seals sold.
1914- 2,053,607 seals sold.
1915- 4,000.000 the aim.
Governor W. N. Ferris has endorsed
the work which the Michigan Anti-Tuberculosis
Association is doing in the
sale of seals this year. In a personal
letter to the secretary, Gov. Ferris
stated: "The Secretary of the State
Board of Health informs me that
through the sale ol seals you are doing
a splendid work. I say, go ahead in
aiding the work that is going on
through the Anti- Tuberculosis Cam
paign. The Red Cross Seal is a thing
of beauty and carries with it a senti
ment that is inspiring and encouraging.
My declaration is, go ahead." ,
The Michigan State Grange in 1913
appointed a committee to co-operate
with the Anti-Tuberculosis Association,
and the subordinate Granges are doing
a splendid work in the educational
" campaign, and in the seal sale. Mrs.
'- C.Hi Anderson who was appointed the
: V U. P. member of this committee has
. charge of the sal, in Baraga county.
If you wish' a greater number, of
seals than you' can obtain from the
school children, send to Mrs. Anderson,
' or get them from the stores with-the
large Red Cross sign. .-,
The Sentinel is glad to help in this
good work, and heartily endorses the
local seal sale. .

SEEK DOLLS FOR
' ORPHANS' HOLIES.
Orphaned children in the Upper Pen
insula will be made happy Christmas
day if a plan begun by Menominee
women carries through to success.
The plan, which wai the idea of Miss
Katherine Stiles snd in which she and
Mrs. Jerry Madden, president of the
Child Welfare league, are leaders, is
te give every girl in the three orphan
ages in Clover-Land a doll on Christ
mas day.
To do this it will be necessary to
collect in che neighborhood of 250 dolls,
as a rough estimate shows that there
are approximately this number of girls
in the three orphanages. Of this num
ber in the , neighborhood of 150 are in
the Catholic . orphanage at Marquette,
50 more little Indian girls in the or
phanage at Assinins and upwards of 25
in the non-sectarian institution at
Houghton. ,
An effort will be made to collect 300
dolls, and the boxes containing' them
will be shipped by express , to the or
phanagea about Dec. 20 so that they
will arrive in plenty of time to be dis
tributed on Christmss day.
Those desiring to give a doll should
send it to either of the above named
women at Menominee.
