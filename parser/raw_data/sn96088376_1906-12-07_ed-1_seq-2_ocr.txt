EVIDENCE OF MORE CRIME.
No Influence Can Protect P.underer
of Coal Lend.
Salt Lake, Nov. SO. Powerful influ
ence is being brought to bear at Wash
ington to prevent threatened prosecu
tions of corporations and individuals in
conne-Hion w ith the land frauds which
have been disclosed by the Interstate
Commerce commission. These efforts,
however, have been unavailing and the
course which the government has
mapped out will be pursued unfalter
ingly. When the Interstate Commerce com
mission resumes its hearing here today,
evidence will lie produced by J. T.
Marcliand and K. K. Thomas to prove
tliat the Ctah Fuel company, ever since
it organization six or een years ago,
has received rebates from the IVnver A
Rio Grande and Rio Grande Western
systems. It is expected to prove this
by William O. Williams, auditor for
the Utah Fuel company, and it will lie
shown, it is said, that by moans of
these rebates the fuel company, and
also the Pleasant Valley Coal company,
were better able to maintain the mono
poly, which they are charged w ith hav
ing, of the coal business in I'tah. It
is alleged that both of these coal com
panies enjoyed a blanket rate of cent
a mile per ton on all of the commodi
ties which the railroad company men
tioned transported for them. These
preferential rates were enjoyed upon

GREAT FIND OF EXPLORERS.
Fragments of Gospel-end Many Other
Ancient Writings.
Chicago, Nov. 30. A cable dispatch
to the Tribune from London says: It
now is possible to give further details
of the remarkable find of 'papyri as a
result of the efforts of Drs. Grenfell
and Hunt, of the Greco-Roman branch
of the Egypt Exploration Fund at Oxy-
rhynchus. The lind consists or no few
er than 130 boxes of papyri, ranging in
date from the second century, B. C, to
the sixth century, A. I). They com
prise all classes of literature, many
fragments of the lost or even unknown
classical works, and some most import
ant fragments unknown to Christian
literature.
The most important find is a vellum
leaf containing 45 lines of gospel which
has a variation from the authorized
version. The subject is the visit of
Jesus and his disciples to the temple of
Jerusalem and their meeting there with
the Pharisee, who rebukes them for
their failure to perform the necessary
ceremonial of purification. In the dia
logue which follows, which resembles
in some respects Matthew xxiii:25, the
Pharisee descrilies with considerable
fullness and detail the formalities he
has observed, whereupon Jesus delivers
an eloquent, crushing reply, contrast
ing outward with, inward purity.

DOUBLE-DECK BRIDGE.
Disgraceful Scene at Ruth Hour
Call for Relief.
Now York, Nov. 28. Tho daily
crush of the Brooklyn bridge is receiv-
mg the earnest attention of Mayor Mc
Clellan and other city officials. At a
conference yesterday Important plans
for temporary and permanent reliof
were discussed. Iinger trains and in
creased headway, it is expected, will
bring temporary relief.
Plans for permanent relief Include
an almost entire rebuilding of the
bridge. Double decking will probably
lie resorted to in order to make room
for addit ional lines of railroad tracks.
The engineers have informed the may
or that the stress on tho anchor bars
is only a third of their capacity and
that the double decking of the struct ure
is entirely feasible. This form of re
lief, however, will lie a matter of years.

MUCH LAND STOLEN
Government Grip Tightens on
Plunderer's ot Domain.
i
MANY HIGH OfFICIALS INVOLVED
Machinery of Law At Work Again!
Men Who Ruled Land Office
To Rob Nation.
Salt Lake, Nov. 20. The grip of tho
government and of just'.ce a tithtcuititf
slowly alsiut the organic! ,,iui.s which,
It la alleged, have for youin, with the
connivance of the bind desrtiiieiit,
rohticd the public domain of nnl, min
eral and timber land valued at many
millions of dollars. In the end, It Is
stated, every member of these gangs,
whether he lie a plain citnten of tho
I'nitod States or occupies high ollicial
position, will !e made to answer in tho
criminal courts for his complicity in
the most gigantic frauds said ever to
have been xrctmtcd on tho I'nlted
States government.
Every agency of the government, in
eluding the Interstate Commerce coin
mission, the secret, service, the Federal
grand jury and 'the omirt of equity,
has been set in motion to accomplish
the end desired. While the Interstate
Commerce commission Is taking testi
mony here tending to show that the
Rio Grande railroad and its allied com
panies, the I'tah Fuel coiiqmny and the
Pleasant Valley Coal conimy, have
been wearing by fraudulent menus all
of the coal land in the stale of L'lah
and consequent ly building up their
monoMily in Ibis line, the Federal
grand jury here is awaiting the out
come of the hearing with a view to
gathering all of the guilty ones Into
its net.
The peculations of which the govern
ment complains have been htihI rated
in Wyoming, I'tah, Colorado, Mon
tana, New Mexico, (alfioruia, Oregon
and possibly in other stab's. The rob
lieries of the public domain have Nvn
slmiMt as extensive, it is charged, in
timlier bind as in mineral land.
That such enormous frauds, extend
ing through a long period of years,
could not have been iieriet rated with
out the complicity of the 1 u nd depart
ment is wild to lie a jinteiit fact.
During the hearing here yesterday a
glimjMc of the real powi-r behind the
throne was given when It was staled by
government laud agents that they had
been comicllfd to aeo Senator Francis
E. Warren rcpirding ollicial business
of the 1 ill id iemrtinelit. Senator War
ren is charged with having ruled the
land ollliv for a number of years. It
wus his influence and that of Senator
Clark which secured the appointment,
during President McKinley's adminis
tration, of Willis Yaiidevmiter to ho
assistant attorney genemt for the Inter
ior department. Yandevanter was tho
legal conscicnon of the Ijind depart
ment . and Yaiidf vtiutcr had been at
torney for the fomKinics charged with
shilling the land. It was Warren who
made Congressman Frank W. Mndcll
assistant land commissioner, who later
put Binger Hermann in the pudtinn of
commissioner, and who succeeded him
by present Commissioner Richards. It
is Warren, it is claimed, who still con
trols the land olllces from Nebraska and
the Dukotus to California and Alaska.
