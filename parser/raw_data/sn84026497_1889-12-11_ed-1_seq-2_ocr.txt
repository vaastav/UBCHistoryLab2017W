THE FOREST REPUBLICAN.
4. C. WINK,
Editor Pnopmttopt.
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 18S9.
J eff JJayis, is dead. He died at
12:45, December 6th, 1889, at Ne
Orleans. Everybody knows who Jeff
Davis was.
Tub President has appointed Judge
David J. Brewer, of Kansas, to the
vacancy on the IT. S. Supreme Court
bench caused by the death of Justice
Matthews. The appointment, although
a surprise to the country in general, is
looked Upon as an exceptionally good
one.
Tn Philadelphia Item, thus tersely
states the case: "Charles W. Stone
will be the next Governor of Penn
sylvania. The people will boss this
job." And that's the way it appears
up in this section, where Mr. Stone's
great popularity would get him prac
tically a unanimous vote.
Press Opinions on the Message.
President Harrison's first message
plain, candid and entirely unpre
tentious review of public affairs. Its
most striking characteristic is an ab
sence of pretense, exaggeration or
rhetorical flourish, and there is do at
tempt to enlarge upon especial topics
for the sake of catching temporary
popular applause or partisan advan
tage. It has the tone throughout of
conscious strength and sincerity, and
of profound conviction that the people
will unwaveringly sustain the national
politics to which they gave approval
by their votes one year ago. New
York Tribune, Rcj.
President Harrison's message is a
plain, business document, well written
and making recommendations strictly
in the line of the Republican platform.
New York Herald, Ind.
It is a clear, plain statement of the
condition of the country in its foreign
and domestic relations and of the leg
islation that is needed to promote its
interests. There is no fustian rhetoric
in the document, no epigrams, no
straining after effect. Brooklyn Times,
Rep.
The Well-settled policy of the Re
publican party is in the framework of
the President's message. It must now
be wisely put into acts by the Repub
lican Congress. Newark Advertiser,
Rep,"
It is written under a due sense of all
the responsibility, and we may also
say with the familiarity, of a public
servant giving an account of his stew
ardship. Boston Transcript, Ind.
lhe message as a whole is a clear,
lucid statement of the national situa
nuu; is conservative ana patriotic in
tone, admirablo in its suggestions and
recommendations. Boston Traveller,
Rep.
Whitest does not indicate the pos
session of great gifts of statesmanship,
or even of very firm individual opin
ion, it must be regarded all io all as a
creditable production. New York
Evening Sun, Ind.
The President's message to Congress
is admirable in form and comprehen
aive in scope, referring in dignified and
well chosen phrases to all the topics of
domestic and foreign concern that now
occupy the publio mind. Baltimore
Sun, Dan.
The document is written in a digni
fied manner and it has an air of can
dor and a desire to be dispassionate
that will commend it to many readers,
and secure for its suggestions the con
siderate attention of many who can
not agree with them all. Troy Press,
Dem.
WASHINGTON LETTER.
From our regular Correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. 6, 1889.
The President left here to day for a
snort western trip. After visiting
Chicago, he will go to Indianapolis
and attend to some important private
business before returning to Washing'
ton.
The Senate has, by lot, determined
the length of the terms of the six new
Senators as follows : Washington
Senator Squire expires March 3, 1891,
nd Senator Allen March 3, 1893
fiouth Dakota Senator Moody March
3, 1891, and Senator Pettigrew March
3, 1893 j North Dakota Senator
Tietce, March, 3, 191, aud Senator
Casey March 3, 1893. The terms of
the Moutana Senators will not be fixed
until they occupy their seats.
Judge David J. Brewer, of Kansas,
has been nominated by the President
to be Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court to fill the vacancy caused by
the death of the lute Jubtice Stauley
Matthews, of Ohio. Judge Brewer is
a nephew of Justice Stephen J. Field
of the Supreme Court ; he has beeu
since 184 United Slates Judge fur the
eighth circuit of Kansas. He has
filled a number of important positions
ia Kansas, judicial and otherwise, and
has always beeu a popular official
The nomination is highly pleasing to
Senators Iugalls aud I'lumb, aud iu
fact to everybody, with tlio possible
exception of several disappointed can
didates and their immediate friends.
Justice Miller, over whose circuit
Judge Brewer has presided for the
last five years, says he considers him
one of the ablest judges ntw on the
bench. When Justice Brewnr takes
his seat on the bench with his Uncle
Justice Field, it will be the first time
in the history of the court that two of
the contemporary justices have been
so nearly related.
Owing to the organization of the
Houso on Monday the President's
messsge was not read to Congress
until Tuesday. The message has been
well received by everybody except a
bandfull of Southerners who profess to
see in its plain statement of the con
dition of political affairs in the South
cause for alarm. The message is
strictly conservative, both in tone and
in its recommendations, being thereby
io striking contrast to the last dicta
torial documents sent from the White
House to Congress. Mr. Harrison
evidently intended this message to be
confined to its strict constitutional
limits that of informing Congress of
the state of the country. Its recom
mendations are in every instance what
has been approved by the Republican
parly. Upon those things on which j
there are different opinions in the par
ty he has presented the facts without
recommendation. It is a document
that has greatly disappointed the
Democrats because it furnishes them
with no ammunition.
Next in importance to the Presi
dent's message is Secretary Windom's
annual report to Congress, which was
made public on Wednesday. Mr.
Windom covers the entire financial
field and furnishes one ef the most
interesting and important reports of
the kind ever made. It piesents a
plan for the satisfactory solution of
the silver problem, which Mr. Windom
believes will be accepted by both
silver and gold men. Space prevents
further notice of the report, but it
should be carefully read by every in
telligent citizen of the country. It
may be obtained by addressing Secre
tary Windom.
The organization of the House was
attended by a little circumstance that
shows the danger which will constant
ly menace the majority during the
sefsioD. After Reed had been elected
Speaker, McPherson, Clerk ; Holmes,
Sergeaot at-Arms ; Adams, Doorkeep
er, and Wheat, Postmaster, Represen
tative Henderson, as Chairman of the
Republican caucus, nominated Rev,
C. B. Rumsdell for Chaplain. Repre
sentative Cbeadle of Indiaua, bolting
the caucus nomination, moved to strike
out the name of Rarasdell and substi
tute that of Dr. Milburn, tho blind
preacber, who was Chaplain of the
last House. Mr. Cheadle was sup
ported outright by three Republicans
Moore, of New Hampshire; Lebb
lack, of New Jersey, and Ewart, of
North Carolina and enough refrained
from voting to elect Dr. Milburn, who
received 106 votes to Mr. Ramadell's
155, the Democrats votiug solidly for
Milburn. Ibis is ot itseit a small
thing, but if the party caucus can be
successfully bolted in small things,
mere is nothing to prevent the same
thing being doue when something im
portant is at stake.
