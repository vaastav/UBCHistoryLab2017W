trial here for the murder ot Dr
Helene Knabc who was found dead In
her Indianapolis apartments two years
ago Three distinct features marked
tho evidence
First Henry M Spaan chief coun
sel for Dr Craig In backing up his
argument Hint spiritualism and the as
sistance of spiritual mediums entered
largely into the gathering of the evi
dence In tho case by Private Detective
Harry Webster produced a photo
graphic copy of a letter amounting
practically to a contract signed by
Webster and addressed to Itoso
Cooper an Indianapolis clairvoyant
Second Attorney Spaan during his
opening statement to the Jury de
clared that tho defense would present
convincing evidence to show that Au
gusta Knabe cousin of Dr Knabe and
Katherlno McPhcrson Dr Knabes
office nssistant removed the bloody
knife and other evidences of suicldo
during the hour in which tfiey were
alone in tho Knabc flat with tho corpse

Third Four Indianapolis doctors
called as witnesses for tho prosecu
tion admitted on cross examination
that Dr Knabes wounds might have
been selT lnfiictcd and that the mur

heads until after the search of tho
