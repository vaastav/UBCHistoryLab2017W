A BASTARD BAILWAY IAW.
Commissioner Fink, at one time a
recognized authority on railway law,
remarked to the writer hereof, during
the pendency of the inter-state railway
commission, law, that its passage would
prove the death knell of the smaller
centers or "common points," and of
,ct oHrnnf.iTo to a. few of the greater
terminal cities. The bUl subsequently
became the law of the land with consid
erable scope and efficacy until the su
preme court sheared it of its power,
since which time both toe railways and
the public have been dissatisfied with
the status of the transportation ques
tion. That the inter-state commerce
law has worked to a disadvantage for
the interests of ycung and growing dis
tributing and manufacturing centers
There is no doubt The operations of the
measure have been against the city of
but two or three or a half dozen trunk
lines and in the interest of cities with
both trunk lines and water routes,
subsequent to the handing down of the
emasculating decision of the supreme
court, Senator Foraker of Ohio intro
duced into the United States senate a
general pooling bill, which measure. is
now pending. Upon the heels of the
movement, 3fr. George R- Blanchard
has published a pamphlet containing
seven articles on railway pooling. Mr.
Blanchard is chairman of the Joint
Traffic association and is thoroughly
posted and advised of wQiat he writes.
He favors a general pooling law, going
into details and presenting many argu
ments favoring his position. He holds
that the roads of the entire country are,
as a rule, on the ragged edge. "What
with "drastic" court decisions; "inimi
cal" laws and "hostile" legislation rail
way interests are in the last ditch. Be
sides, under the present competitive sys
tem unreasonable Internecine freight
rate wars have been constant, unset
tling public business and depleting rail
way revenues. He therefore' advocates
the passage of "the Foraker bilL
Hon Charles A. Prouty, a member of
the Inter-state Commerce Commission,
In the last Forum appears with au an
swer to ftLr. Blanchard in which Trouty
consents to the truth of Blanchard's
complaints but dissents from the pro
posed remedy. Prouty's article, which
is wonderfully forceful, as it Is simple
and straightforward, holds that a gen
eral pooling law means inevitably high
er freight rates all around and against
the people as a whole. Consenting that
the present state of the railways of
America is a deplorable one, and that
pooling would relieve many of their dif
ficulties, yet that, after all, ffli fact re
mains that the main purpose of pooling
is to eliminate competition, even at
"common points." Mr. Prouty con
cludes his lucid article by saying that
"it Is impossible to come into contact
with the actual railway operations of
this country today without being con
vinced that a majority of the men in
charge of our railroad properties are sin
cerely desirous of operating those prop
erties in obedience to law. It is impos
sible to resist the further conviction that
taking the law as it now stands, and
the conditions as they now actually ex
ist, the honest railroad is at a most seri
ous disadvantage. An interstate carrier
which complies with the provisions of
the act to regulate commerce does so at
the expense of business which legiti
mately belongs to it This ought not to
be; and when these men, in good faith,
ask congress tor legislation which will
aitend -this state of jiffairs and enable
them to "better administer their trusts,
they are entitled to speedy and careful
atention and to whatever relief can be
consistently granted. The fact that the
relief asked for may involve the crea
tion of a "trust" is not conclusive
ngainst it Every railroad has, of ne
cessity, with reference to a large por
tion of Its traffic, an absolute monopoly;
but the remedy for this sort of monopo
ly is regulation, not strangulation.
In legislation of this sort, the public has
a vital interest which must be protect
ed; and no provision of law now in ex
istence affords even the shadow of such
protection. "Subject to the regulation
of the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion" sounds reassuring: in the present
state of ffiie law it means absolutely
nothing."
. A CUT IN OFFICIAIi FEES.
The Lawrence Journal has been look
ing up the working results of a new fee
and salary bill whicli now goes into ef
fect, a copy of which act the Eagle pub
lished the other day. The Journal says
that the new law is going to hit hard
In some places. In view of tins, some
officers have claimed that their salaries
may not bo lowered by act of legisla
ture during their term. The attorney
general holds that this Is not well tak
pn. and he is probably right. In cer
tain cases judges of the courts, for in
stance, the law distinctly prohibits a
decrease of salary during the terms for
which the officers are elected. It would
sepm to follow, therefore, that a special
prpvision must be made if the law ap
plies. The lowering of salaries will
work great hardshins in many in
stance, and threats of resignation are
frequent The fees of a justice of the
peacsv which were rdilly-exorbitankniH
decithe old law, re-reduced to ridiculf
olW'l)npSrtions by -the new one. -fror-instancc;
the justice can collect only 25
cents for a day's work in court. Court
stenographers can earn but $60 a
month. This, of course, is all wrong,
and while both officers mentioned have,
in the past been allowed excessive fees
it will follow that in future no compe
tent man can be secured for either posi
tion. This law shows how absurd "re
form" is when the reformers are In the
business solely for the boodle that is In
It for them personally.
NO FLIRTING,' PLBASg.
The Puritanism of colonial times for
bade -by law the women decoying the
male subjects of the king by paints,
Si&inHp
powder, breast palpitators and the like.
Men, later, in a spirit of bravado, no
doubt, laughed the custom out of coun
tenance, as unworthy. But the fact is
evident enough that the male half of
creation needs protection against the
other half just as emphatically now as
in the days when witchcraft was rec
ognized and punished. The wiles of wo
men are many. Among other danger
ous subterfuges, which has grown into
a habit, is flirting. In Tennessee there
is a law against flirting. Like the New
England virgins and their paint, the
law has been so flagrantly violated that
it has become obsolete. An arrest un
der the law was recently made at Rich
mond, Tenn., at the instance of the
irate father, the first for years. The de
fendant escaped punishment "by prov
ing that she and the young man with
hearts, and that the enactment could
whom she bad flirted were well ac
quainted, had formerly been sweet
not be violated by persons between
whom an intimate acquaintance exist
ed. Further evidence was adduced to
show that courting might follow flirta
tion, but that where courting had ex
isted any subsequent action of the
courted or courier could not be flirting,
hence the law had -not been violated.
THE PRESIDENT ON CURRENCY.
President dlcKinley's currency recom
mendations are very plain, simple and
conservative, the following out of
which by congress will, while doing
away with the "endless chain," cause
no break in confidence and increase
rather than curtail the circulation. The
president in his message recommends
two things in connection with the
money question long advocated by the
Eagle. The first of these is that nation
al banks be authorized -to issue notes to
the full amount of the United States
bonds deposited with the United States
treasury for redemption. This, in con
nection with the authority to establish
national banks with a raSnimum of 23,
000 capital, would relieve much of the
monetary strain felt in the past four
years. The other recommendation
made by the president which this paper
has so often urged is to the effect that
the issue of national bank nojes be re
stricted to the denomination of ten dol
lars and upwards. This should be fol
lowed with the recommendation that no
treasury note be issued of a less 'denom
ination than five dollars.
The Great Father certainly has spanked
the five big Indian tribes. It will do them
good.
Tho keynote of McKInley's financial ad
vice is: "In times of prosperity, prepare
for panics."
The six-day bicycle race In New York Is
about as sensible as a contest of falling
oft a six-story building would bo.
Just at present the coal dealer in Kan
sas acts as If he were thinking of put
ting his trade-mark on that wavo of pros
perity. Germany should keep hands off Haytl.
Haytl is on. the Monroe circuit and Uncle
Sam might throw a few volts through just
for fun.
The Jennings boys who robbed a train
in broad day-light, made no resistance
when being captured. This demonstrates
their intelligence again.
Congress will recognize the belligerency
of the Insurgents whether McKinley likes
it or not And in due time, McKinley will
have to side with congress.
President McKinley is the first national
executive to grasp the true situation in
tho Indian Territory. He has taken his
stand with tho white settlers.
The president swiped the Indian aristoc
racy of the five civilized tribes hard. Some
body must have been down to the "White
House and told the president the truth.
If McKInley's advice is taken, the one,
two and five dollar paper bills will bo su
perseded by silver. However, the tailors
can overcome the strain of nine silver dol
lars. Give the Populists credit. Many Popu
lism papers predicted as far "back as five
days ago that Marcus Hanna. would be
pleased with President McKInley's mes-
When President McKinley states a bad
condition he concludes with "This ought
to be stopped." McKinley writes much as
he talks and when a man does that he Is
in earnest.
The Wichita High school graduates want
to dispense with the commencement exer
cises. If they do, how do they expect
the wcrid to learn that "night brings out
the stars:"
The British papers denominate McKIn
ley's message as "weak and colorless." It
is refreshmg to see the Republican party
getting back into a position where It Is
offensive to England.
The abolition of the commencement exer
cises in the public schools would certainly
be novel. It would prevent the average
boy from picking up his oration three
years after he delivered It and weeping a
cataract on it.
Tort of the Democrats assert that Mc
Kinley 's proposed action on the greenbacks
would further fasten the gold standard on
the country. Part of the Republicans as-
sei-L thauit would endanger the gold stand-
. zr: - ?
As CJuistnvis rpproacacs, the pcpucir
lal'ao that th? Chrtmas of long ago was
metner than the modern one should be
explod.-d. To aU intents and purposes the
average boy of today can rub holes In the
lining of his stomach with chocolate bon
bons just a3 easily as his father did with
the diabolical gum-drop.

Creeds and Crocuses
(By W. Bert Foster. In Two -Parts.)
PART I.
The Rev. Wetherby Smiles was reotor at
St. James', and occupied a rose embowered
cottage not far from the church. The cot
tage, with its attendant .garden, was a
dainty, pretty spot .which looked as though
a woman's hand had planted and pared
for it.
But no woman had anything to do with
the rectory. The Rev. 'Smiles' only serv
ant was a doddering old man; the rector
prepared his own meals, except when he
was invited to tea by some old lady who
pitied his lonely. Indigestion breeding ex
istence. Not that the Rev. Wetherby Smiles was
a woman hater, but Mr. Smiles was very
high church. Indeed. Unfortunately, St.
James and the parish and the people were
extremely low.
The rector felt that the clergy ,t to be
able to give their whole time and thought
to their work, should live lives of celibacy.
He had felt at times a. strong drawing to
wards some ecclesiastical order in .which
such vows would be necessary. Thanae
would wear some outward sign of his vows,
and the young women of his parish would
not fall in love with him.
The rector was young and good looking;
he had been in his present pastorate elx
months, and he had already had an expe
rience. The Rev. Wetherby Smiles from his study
window, could look across his gardentplot
and 'see the brown earth warming In the
spring sunshine and the trees and bushes
slowly bursting into leaf.
He looked across his garden, I say, and
across the garden, beyond the low hedge,
was another garden, which In summer
was full of color. He had noticed the
brilliant hued beds -the year before, but
now the only bit of color was a pale blue
morning robe that flitted about the inclo-
sure.
To tell the truth, the rector had seldpm
noticed that morning gown or the little
woman inside it before. But it pleased his
fancy now to look across the hedge and
watch his neighbor.
He recalled that his old major domo had
told him the cottage next the parsonage
was occupied, by a widow lady a lonely
creature who had taken up her abode there
but shortly before the Rev. Smiles was
settled over St. James'. He remembered
the little figure in black in one of the side
pews, rointed out to him by the clerk as
"Mrs. Scorritch," and probably had not
given her a -thought or a glance afterward.
However, ho saw so much of the pale
blue gown that first warm week In spring
that he looked for the little widow in her
pew the next Sabbath. She had laid aside
her weeds and was dressed in some soft,
clinging, fawn colored material that made
her look like a very demure little moth.
And she had the sweetest face in the world
at least, the sweetest face in the Rev.
"Wf-theiby Smiles' world.
On Monday morning the clerical black
appeared in the rectory garden almost as
soon as the pretty morning robe appeared
over the hedge. The demure little face
dimpled and smiled under Its garden hat
at the reotor approach, and the widow
nodded brightly.
"You are early at your gardening this
spring, Mrs. Scorritch," he said.
"Yes, but It 13 so warm," she replied In
defense. "I am expecting my crocuses to
appear any day now."
"I am afraid we'll see some frost yet,
Mrs. Scorritch," said the rector.
"Now. don't talk that way, I beg!" cried
the little woman, clasping her hands, in
closed in long-wristed and particularly
well-fitting gauntlets. "Just suppose my
crocuses should come up and be frost bit
ten! O, tho thought is too awful!"
"I sincerely hope you will not be disap
pointed, but this climate is uncertain."
Many were the conferences held across
the hedge regarding the proper .pruning of
rose trees, the planting of hardy seeds,
and the preparation of the beds of earth.
The rector had never suspected there was
so much detail to the business of garden
ing. One morning, just after a warm night
rain, the Rev. Smiles was called to the
hedge by a little cry from his neighbor.
"They are coming!" she cried In delight.
"See! Here is the dearest little blade of
green pushing up through the mold and
there is another and another! Just look
at them!"
The rector found it necessary to leap the
hedge (he had been something of an ath
lete at the university and certainly this
spring weather was sending the blood
coursing through his veins quite like old
times) and look at the crocus bed near
to.
"They are such lovely ones," stye said,
eari estly. "I don't believe you noticed
them at all last spring" (he pronounced
maledictions upon himself for having been
so blind as to miss so mu,ch beauty the
previous season), "but they will be even
better this year if we don't have that hor
rid frost you have been prophesying."
But when he returned to his own lonely
domain and entered his 6tudy he stopped
and thought seriously for a minute. Then
he cast his flat-crowned ministerial hat
upon the floor with great emphasis and ex
claimed: "It's my creed, I tell you, that a man In
orders should not marry!"
Now, there was no one visible to argue
the question, and yet there seemed to be
argument In his own mind, for the Rev.
Wetherby Smiles smote his palm with his
clenched fist angrily and kicked the flat
crowned hat to the other end of the
room.

This Is a cunnlns: line: "We Bhall not
boast ou wiH do that for us after 70U
have bought."
"We know you boy," says a Kansas ad
vertiser, "and we have a tip on what he
wants for Christmas."
Now of all times of the year make your
display windows warm. Use touches of red
and light up brilliantly.
In all the large cities of the east the ad
vertisements deal exclusively with Christ
mas goods at this time.
Renewal Is the soul of advertising. You
can not sell Christmas goods with a
Fourth of July advertisement.
A merchant says: "It will surprise you
to find these goods selling at a price that
you have long associated with the unre
liable." The easiest people to sell goods are those
who put off their Christmas purchases un
til the last hour. With the early buyer
16 takes argument and explanation.
One ot the largest advertisers in Chicago
says that In his store it Is always "Thank
you. madam, for the trade you so kindly
give us. It's old-fashioned, but it brings
us thoueands of customers yearly."
It must strike the merchant who spent
h.s publicity money in painting country
fences and barns, that those signs are
bringing him in mighty httlo Christmas
trade. An advertisement must be fresh.
At this time of year advertisements art:
an index of Christmas goods. Without
them, shopping life would be like hunting
a word In a dictionary that had been
thrown together without any alphabeUcal
order.
John Wannaraaker realizes the Import
ance of a big Santa. Claus. He advertised:
"The great giant Krlsa Klngle, just erect,
ed. the largest ever seen, with his feet on
thp first floor and bis nose up to the fourth
storj."
Every woman Is hunting for a Christmas
present or presenu for some one. If she
is a buyer, and not a "looker," eh first
glances over the newspaper to see what -s
offered. GraUfy her. Give choice artlUea
publicity.
A Chicago store Is drawing attention to
itself by advertising "the largeet Santa
Claus on earth. He is over eight feat
talL" This U a sugestlon to southern
Kansas stores. The bigger the Santa CUuc
the more he impresses children.
The injunction: "Keep your eye on thf
column," Is next to worthier Make the
injunction unnecessary by making people
keep their eyes on it. You can not bull
doze or win the publlp by exclamation
points.

A New Yorker, who lately went on an excursion to New Mexico with a lot
of railroad men, in a special car, reflected that alkali dust and chainpagno
always upset lxis digestion, and determined to buy a box of Ripans Tabulea at
a St Louis drup; store.
"How do these sell?" he asked of the druggist
"We sell a lot of 'em, was the reply. "That gentleman who just went
out bought a box. He is Commodore J. E. M. llauxy of New York, who is on
this Now Mexican excursion."
As days went bv, our friend took a Tabnle after each meal and oqp before
going to bod and Was as regular as a top. So too was the Commodore. In a
few dayB. however, most of the party buffered nioro or loss from overrating,
over-smoking, alkali dust, want of exercise and indigestion. Nearly every on
complained of constipation, and the Commodore, like a good angel, produced
bis box from time to time, and in every case relief followed his kindly minis
trations. . . , . ... .
"How does it happen," asked the Commodore of our friend, "that you
alone escape the inconvenience all the others suffer from ? Only you and I
escape." But our friend was foxy and would not admit that ho too was a slave
to Ripans Tabules ; but all that party carry them now when they go where
meals are irregular and tho water is bitter or poor.
