Mr. Gardner in the conveyance of some
number of Chinamen from the Pacific coast
to New Orleans, has recently arrived hero
from Texas, bringing with him one hundred

contract in that State. .Of this new arrival
fifty-eight are engaged for the Bnena Vista
plantation, belonging to Mr. W. H. Aymar,

The convening of the Legislature is looked
for with much interest by many who arc
expecting fat places, but that event can not
promise the same fortune that is offered to
many at a much earlier jieriod. On the
tenth of this month the next single number
drawing of the Louisiana State Lottery will
take place; and there will be distributed
four hundred and forty prizes, ranging from
$50,000 down to $200. It would be well to
secure tickets early.
We publish this morning an interesting
aud lucid article upon the working of the
bankrupt law, by our friend J. U. G. Pit
kin, Esq., Register in Bankruptcy, whose
previous articles upon other features of the
act have appeared in our columns. The fre
quent inquiries addressed him and ourselves,
upon the questions touched, is the especial,
occasion of the article at this severe com
mercial juncture. There are many in our
midst who contemplate bankruptcy, and
such will find their path clear of manydoubts,
now set at rest by the article in question.
The election of ex-Govcrnor Vance, of
North Carolina, to the United States Senate,
on the twqnty-ninth of last month, is not
likely to impede the advance of Republican
principles, if the language attributed to him
is the language of his heart. On the
evening ol the day of his election he was
serenaded, and is reported to have said, in
concluding his speech: "Every law, both
State and national, should be respected and
obeyed by all our*people; bitterness and
vituperation should cease, and men no
longer endeavoring to destroy each other,
should earnestly strive to engender kindly
fc^Hng a among all classes of our citizens.
To bring about these desirable ends wiH be
the earnest aim of my life, in Congress and
elsewhere."
WHERE IS 10 BE THE BEST
Baton Bouge, to use,a common and
somewhat vulgar phrase, is *• breeding a
scab upon her nose." She came out of
the riot investigation victorious,' having
secured the release of the offending par
ties under a technicality of the law.
There is nothing so dangerous to a rowdy
as a little encouragement. Justice ii
never so unjust as when she is weak.
And that Baton Kquge is in danger of
proving this proposition is our most seri
ous apprehension at present. She
already perverse of her own motion, aild
some indiscreet friends are funning
her heat with incendiary sugges
tions. The Bulletin indirectly urges the
application of violence to Captain
Meyers because of his part in the trial,
and the course of a man mimed Skol
field, who insulted and abused Captain
Bandy, is considered just the thing in
quartern where reason and prudence have
never had their fruitful residence. Captain
Bandy was interrupted when away from
his friends by this man Skolfield, and it
has been published as reflection on him
that he did not resent a premeditated as
sault in the presence of a squad that had
determined he should be beaten if he
offered any opposition. Discreet men
will say that Captain Bandy acted wisely
and bravely in keeping his temper and
his discretion in prerence of an overpow
ering attack. Military men are never ac
cepted as generals who engage with des
perate odds and come off beaten. Indi
viduals are. entitled to due credit who fori
assassination or great personal ipjury by
the exhibition of coolness and equa
nimity.
A correspondence which we publish
from Baton Rouge, gives an unfavorable
account of other matters thereabouts. The
escape which the rioters made at the
hands of the United States Commissioner
in this city, has had the effect to render
them obstinate and wicked at home, and
their conduct now is such as to justify a
remark which will be found in the begin
ning of this article, that "justice is never
so unjust as when she is weak." While
the Baton Rouge rioters were in custody,
and while the law was drawing them
toward the thoughts of punishment, they
held themselves to be the most peaceful
lambs that had ever been dragged from
the fold. Every one of them was a model
conservator of the law and of justice.
Each one was a swift messenger to stop
lawlessness. Never a medley of in
nocents was more mistaken than
were the officers who arrested these
men under the impression that their
thoughts had conspired to overleap tie
limits of quietude and acquiescence. The
impression was distributed far and wide
that the authorities had done great in
justice by arresting a body of men better
adapted for a prayer meeting than a riot.
And all that we could say and do was of
no avail to stop this grievous error. The
hot pistols, the fallen men, the presence
of the parties, went for nothing. The
men yfho had the pistols, the men who
were present at the killing, the men who
were identified, are all at liberty, and
only the dead are the objects of abase.
And the innocents who were spared
and sent home their to friends, are now
keeping the peace of Baton Rouge jusf as
they kept it when Captain Meyers marched
down the street and caught them with the
deadly missiles in their hands ancl the
falsehood of an excuse in their mouths.
They are hunting in bands to insult and
annoy all the men who have sought to
testify against their lawlessness. They are
threatening, both by words and by looks,
the men who opposed their success at the
late election. They are being incited to
violence by innnendo from abroad. They
are well nigh fixed to adopt the sugges
tion that the time lias come for them to
right themselves.
And in this is the danger that we speak
of. Baton Bouge is a very small place,
aud her range of observation is not great
enough to allow her philosophers aud
statesmen to measure questions which af
fect all the people of this country. When
General Grant declared for peace, and
when the people accepted the declaration,
they meant the genuine article and not
that bogus stuff which is accepted as
peace in Baton Rouge. They meant the
peace of the law. They meant an absti
nence from revolver, rifles, shot guns,
knives and assassinations. And if Baton
Rouge does not feel willing to accept these
terms, why, she will either have to con
quer a different result from what fell upon
Jeff Davis or she will be made to acquiesce
in what the balance of the country has
ratified. She will not be allowed to exist
as an outlaw in the midst of peaceful
communities, and it will not take long to
convince hi* that although her rowdies
escaped from the hands of the Commis
sioners, their tether is in the hands of
parties who will bring it to end quite to
their discomfort.
THE TEHUANTEPEC RAILROAD AND SHIP
CANAL.
About a week ago we referred to the
actiou of the Mexican Congress upon the
bill granting to an American company the
right of way for a railroad and ship canal
across the isthmus of Tehuantepec. We
have since studied the subject more fully,
aud conversed with several gentlemen in
terested in this great enterprise, and the
facts set forth by them, as well as the
official documents they have exhibited to
us satisfy us that we were somewhat mis
taken in our comments, and that some of
the inferences we drew were based on
the case, we did unintentional injustice to
President Juarez and his cabinet, whose
influence is warmly enlisted in faVor of
the scheme, and still greater injustice to
oar old fellow-citizen, Mr. Emile LaSere,
whose untiring zeal and devotion to the
promotion of this great work bid fair, we
are pleased to learn, to be at length
crowned with entire success.
The old grant, under which the Louis
iana Tehuantepec Company was organ
ized, having long since been forfeited by
the stoppage of the work, it could not be
resumed without first procuring a new
erroneous impressions of the condition of
things. Acting upon a mistaken view oN
grant from the Mexican government, which
object, after much trouble and labor, and
repeated visits to Mexico and New York,
Mr. LaSere finally succeeded in .accom
plishing.
On the second of January, 1869, a bill
which had .been previously adopted by
the Mexican Congress in December, 1868,
was approved by President Juarez. By
that bill a privilege was granted, to Mr.
LaSere to form a company in the United
States, for the purpose of opening inter
oceanic communication by railway through
the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, said privi
lege to run for seventy years from the
completion of the road. Mr. LaSere,
having thereupon transferred his grant to
Mr. Simon Stevens, of New York, acting
for Mr. MarshaH O. Roberts and other
Northern capitalists, a company was
formed in New York, under the title o,
the "Tehuantepec Railway Company,'.'
with Mr. Stevens as president and Mr.
Roberts and others as directors. Colonel
J. J. Williams, chief engineer of the new
company, completed in June last
thorough surrey of the proposed railway
line, and his plans and specifications, after
being examined by the Mexican authori
ties, and favorably reported upon by the
Mexican commissioner, were approved in
September last by the Mexican govern
ment, who authorized the company to
build the road in accordance therewith.
We were informed by Colonel Williams,
who passed through this city some weeks
ago, that the work of grading and prepar
ing the track would commence before
January next, and that he felt assured the
road would be finished and railway com
munication from ocean to ocean would be
established within the period specified in
the grant, viz: three years from the com
mencement of the work. Letters received
from New York confirm that impression.
Such, as far as our information goes, is
the present condition, and such are the
prospects of the Tehuantepec Railway
Company.
The bill to which we referred last week,
aud which is still pending before the
Mexican Congress, has no connection
with Mr. LaSere's railway grant, beyond
the fact that the company, of which he is
one of the directors, has applied for the
additional privilege of making aship canal
across the isthmus, prdvideflpe survey
now being made by the expedition just
sent down to the Tehuantepec by the
United States government shall demon
strate the feasibility of the work. Should
the interoeeanic canal bill, now under
consideration, be re-enacted by the
Mexican Congress with the amendments
suggested by President Juarez, and should
the report of Commodore Shufeldt and
his party of American and Mexican engi
neers be favorable to (he project—both of
which events are considered almost certain
by the best informed parties—a colossal
enterprise, fraught with immense benefit
to the commerce of the world and calcu
lated to promote to an unlimited extent
the development of our mercantile navy,
as well as the untold profits of our trade
with the whole Pacific coast of North aud
South America, and the porti of China,
Japan, Indo-China and British India, will
be inaugurated under the auspices of the
governments of Mexico and the United
States. The coot of such a canal Would be
far below that of the Suez canal, while the
profits would be immeasurably greater;
and there can be no doubt that the required
capital will be forthcoming whenever the
practicability and the comparative cheap
ness of the scheme are fully understood.
At all events, whatever may come of the
Tehuantepec canal project, the Tehuante
pec railway is now in a fair way to become
a "fixed fact," arid it will doubtless be in
operation before the first spadefull of
earth is dug up on the Isthmus for a Te
Lmmtepec canal.
When that great work, only second in
importance as regards Mexico and the
United States to the proposed Isthmian
ship canal, shall have been completed, no
inconsiderable share of the credit will be
long to Mr. LaSere for the persevering in
terest qnd the unflagging energy he has
devoted to its success.
Mr. Simon Stevens, the President of the
Tehuantepec Railway Company, is a gen
tleman of high position and fine adminis
trative ability, who has devoted the last
three years to the successful prosecution
of the railway and canal enterprise of
which he is the efficient head. The entire
management of the affairs is now cen
tered in his hands and those of the New
York board of directors.
l^kat, after the adjournment, they became
ON CAR0NDELET STREET.
Yesterday was comparatively quiet iu
Carondelet street. The principal trans
actions were in Slaughterhouse stock, of
which more than a thousand shares must
have changed hands in the course of the
day. The market opened a little stronger
than the closing on Saturday night, and
soon advanced to 2-5$, at which figure
twenty-five shares were sold. This point,
however, dfcld not be maintained. It
was a little too high up for the presqpt
condition of the market, and sellers came
forward so cheerfully that the stock
dropped back about a point, yet standing
pretty firm at 24,}. The sales during (he
day comprised several lots of 100 aud 50
at 25, 24] and 24}. The lowest point
reached was 24}, at which price fifty
shares were sold after the Board. At the
Board 545 shares were sold. On the first
call two lots of fifty each brought 21].
On the second call the price fell off to
24}. . So good a night's business as this
seemed to have a remarkably pleasant ef
fect on the gay aud festive brokers. Their
spirits rose, and they became so hilarious
as frisky as young kittens, and indulged
in the innocent and infantile-amusement
of -denuding each others' heads of their
covering, by means of a dextrous applica
tion of walking cahes, through which a
score of hats were wafted through the
room or rolled upon the floor. At this
exciting moment, the dignity and inde
pendence of the press, were not at all
respected, nor was the journalistic hat
treated with that deference which its
owner too fondly supposed to be iffi due.
The price of Slaughterhouse has not,
thus far, justified the ho^s of those who
imagined that the decision of the Supreme
Court could make it go op like a rocket.
Its weakness as yet is, ^lowever, perfectly
natural, trod easily explicable., Large
quantities are held by small speculators,
many of whom had bought on a margin,
and who were compelled to sell, or were
satisfied to get out whole, at present
prices. Until this kind of stock is cleared
away or falls into strong hands not much
of a rise can be anticipated. Whether or
not it will become, event here depend
upon circumstances which can not be
foreseen or controlled. In addition to this,
a silly rumor was circulated that the de
cision of the Supreme Court was in
formal, and therefore invalid; but it is not
to t>e supposed that this statement had
any material effect on intelligent persons.
In the doming Lottery stock sold
(100 shares'! at 821. After this there was
some demand for it, but no more was to
be had at that figure.
We trust that at the next sale of gov
ernment gold some agreement will be
arrived at between Mr. Clinton and the
bidders. We can not understand why he
has heretofore declined to accept bids
made by strong and responsible houses,
when the bids were within three-eighths
of N.pw York prices, and within a fraction
of what small lots can be obtained for.
Mr. Clinton should remember that New
York prices can not be paid here, as long
fts domestic exchange remains in its
present situation. We presume that the
government does not desire to become a
gold speculator, but that, on the contrary,
the object of the sale# is to accommodate
the merchants, and to raise funds for the
purchase of bonds. But neither object
can be accomplished if rational and legiti
mate bids be persistently refused:

bids at the Board last night:

If the Varieties Club intends to buili^a
new theatre, as is said to be the intention,
let two important suggestions be ac
cepted as important, if not imperative,
First, the location should be central, con
spicuous and respectable. Second, the
theatre should be comfortable, capaeious
and elegant. If the site which has been
mentioned in this connection could be
secured, the club need not purchase the
Three Sisters entirely, as the theatre can
be built iu the rear, with only a grand
entrance on Canal street. Suppose that
the front of the square was occupied by
stores, or by a large and splendid restau
rant*, as is the ease with the Teatro Xacional,
in the City of Mexico, the rent from this
would pay a very handsome interest on
the ground. It would, moreover, insure
a lively and prepossessing entrance to the
theatre. There is no reason why the
main front should be devoted to the ac
commodation of the audience. What the
people desire is a goqd theatre, well lo
cated, easy of access, and free from the
swell mob which now assembles on St.
Charles street to watch the attendance as
it enters and exits.
Mr. IV. H. Henning, the well known and
popular grocer. No. 75 Camp street, lias
received in addition to liis huge and
fine stock of staple groceries some
invoices of extra goods of peculiar excel
lence. Mr. Henning is well known to keep
on hand tiie very choicest articles in his line
of trade and now the various additions to
to his splendid stock doubles the induce
ments to give him a call. He has the finest
aud most reliable brands of wines and
liquors, canned fruits aud vegetables, Sha.
ker preserves, English pickles, sauces and
table delicacies, Atmore'i celebrated mince
meat, and choice teas, tli<#best in the mar
ket. None who try the groceries at No. 75
Camp street will go unsatisfied away.
The charge recently made, ou affidavit,
by Dr. It. K. Smith, against Reynand. Bra
dy, Marks and others, with intimidating
Milton Morris, a commissioner of election,
and attempting to interfere with him in the
discharge of his duties, came up for exam
ination yesterday morning before Commis
sioner Weller. Mr. Cutler, for the defense,
excepted to the jurisdiction of the court,
and after considerable argument with Mr.
Gurley, acting for the government, the ex
ception was overruled and the case gone
into ou its merits. Some ten witnesses were
examined, and the accused were discharged,
Yesterday, Judge Shannon, counsel for
David Fisher and the two Oliviers, sued out
a writ of habeas corpus in their behalf be
fore Judge Unroll, iu the United States
District Court, the writ being returnable on
Thursday next, at ten o'clock. The two
Oliviers were examined at Donaldsonville
and committed for trial by Commissioner
Weller, on a charge of complicity with the
murder of Messrs. Sclionberg anil Lawes,
aud Fisher was committed in New Orleans
by the same Commissioner on the same
charge. _
The Secretary of the Calcasieu Sulphur

books of subscription will be opened from

titled to subscribe. See advertisement.
Wo understand that General D. T. Kirby
has been transferred from the warehouse
department to another department of
the New Orleans Custom house, and that
Joseph L. Her wig. who resigned some
months ago. has been re-appointed superin

excellent officer in that position.
Under the head of "Facet!a*," the New

a great admirer of Shakespeare, pointing to

The man who strained the point to perpe

' BANKRUPTCY.
A serious misunderstanding seems to ob
tain that by the recent amendment to the
bankrupt act. the liabilities contracted
after January 1, 1869, enjoy an undue pref
erence over those contracted prior to that
date. Such is not the ease. To publish
long judicial decisions to this effect, how
ever, serve the general reader less than
a plain statement. The only difference be
tween the creditor, whose claim antedates
January, 1869, and the creditor, whoso
claim ensues January, 1869, is that the
'latter is invested with a consent to the
bankrupt's d^sbarge, in case the assets sur
rendered arenot equivalent to fifty per rent
of such of the liabilities, contracted after
January, 1869, as are duly verified or
proved. Should the assets, however, equal
such proved claims—that is, on liabilities
after January, 1869—the creditors bidding
them are disarmed of their option as to the
bankrupt's discharge. But this right ot
consent, afforded those who became cred
itors afterfJauuary, 1869, secures them no
advantage, in which earlier creditors may
not equally share. If the assets suffice in
measure to cover fifty per cent of the proved
claims of the former class, the legal pro
vision is answered, but the proved claims
of the latter class command a proportionate
dividend upon this very fifty per cent
That the claims of the former class should
exhaust everything, to the prejudice of all
others, would be an injustice never eontem
plated by Congress.
Aud should the assets fall short of fifty per
cent of the proved claims arising after
January, 1869, and the creditors holdin;
such claims should thereupon refuse the
bankrupt a discharge, the earlier creditors,
whose claims arc proven, are no less en
titled to whatever equal rate the assets
warrant, while the bankrupt is not estopped
from a discharge from all liabilities con
tracted before January, 1869.
It will therefore he seen that whether the
power of consent* granted to one class of
creditors be put in exercise or by reason of
ample assets to meet fifty per cent of after
January, 1869, claims, he suspended, the
other class on the other side of January,
1869, is in no wise prejudiced in the distri
bution.
It may be proper to add iu this connec
tion that a creditor, who holds a'-preferred
claim, arising since January, 1869, can not
participate in the refusal or consent to a
discharge, unless he relinquishes his secur
ity, and in common with others, files his de
position in proof.
And also, that the renewal after January,
1S69. of an obligation made prior to Jan
uary, 1869, does not bring the obligation
within the compass of the fifty per cent
provision. The law remits the claim back
to the date of the original Consideration.
It will be observed that stress is laid upon
"'proved claims." The distribution of a
bankrupt's effects is not determined by the
list of creditors' names and the ^pioimts set
there against upon his schedule. The cred
itor must put himself before the court iu
bankruptcy by deposing to his claim and
filing the evidences thereof. Then and then
only is he an affirmative party, and can
participate iu the meetings of creditors as
to the administration Mf the estate, etc.
If. as often occurs, no creditors apjiear
at any stage of the Cause, so much
the better for the bankrupt, who. iu such a
contingency, if possessed of no assets what
ever. i-< impeded from a discharge by no
proofsof claims, fot he can readily pay fifty
per cent of nothing.
It may not be amiss to state, by way of
conclusion, that the apprehension enter
tained by many as to the amount of deposit
upon filing a petition in bankruptcy, is
quite needless. That the officers of the
court in bankruptcy should be reasouably
requited is quite patent, but if there be
assets, to which they may look for eventual
compensation, the full umoiuit of the cus
tomary initial deposit will not be exacted.
Nor will such a disbursement from the
estate of a bankrupt impair his chances for
a discharge, inasmuch as the assets must,
before needful outlays iu costs, simply be
commensurate with, not pay fifty per cent ol
the proved debts contracted after January,
1869. J. K. G. PITKIN,
