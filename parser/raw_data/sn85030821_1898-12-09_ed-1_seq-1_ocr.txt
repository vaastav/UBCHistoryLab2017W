"Washington, Dec 5. President Mc
Kinley sent the following1 message to
the Fifty-fifth congress after he had
teen, informed by committees that the
seriate and house awaited any com
munication he wished to make to
them:
To tbe Senate an House of Representatives:
Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered
necessary by the war, our people rejoice la a
very satisfactory and s'eadily Increasing de
cree of prosperity evidenced by the largest
volume of business ever recorded. Every man
ufacture has been productive, agricultural pur
suits ha' e yielded abundant returns, labor in
the fields of industry Is better rewarded, rev
enue legislation passed by the present congress
tas increased the treasury's receipts to the
amount estimated by Its authorities, tbe
Eaaaces of the government have been suc
cessfully administrated and its credit advanced
to the first rank, while Its currency has been
maintained at the world's highest standard.
Military service under a common flag and lor a
righteous cause has strengthened the national
spirit and served to cement more closely than
ever the fraternal bonds between every section
CiX tfce country.
The president here takes ap the his
tory of the Cuban insurrection, the
failure of Spain to successfully cope
with affairs in the island and the un
successful efforts of this country for a
peaceful solution of the matter. lie
refers to the destruction of the battle
ship Maine, "a catastrophe the sus--picious
nature and horror of which
- stirred this nation's heart profoundly."
The initiatory steps leading up to the
war are recounted, the unanimity of
congress in passing1 needed legislation
to strengthen the executive is praised
and the facts regarding the declara
tion of war are told auew. The presi
dent then recites the salient features
of the war. paying a glowing- tribute
to America's heroes cn land and sea;
refers to Dewey's remarkable victory
at Manila, to the military movements
in Cuba and finally to the destruction
of Cervera's fleet and the capitulation
xjf Santiago. Continuing-, he says:
Spanish Overtures for Peace.
The annihilation of Admiral Cervera's ?et,
followed by the capitulation of Santiago, hav
ing orousrht to the Spanish rovernment a real
taint sense of the hopelessness of continuing a
struggle now becoming wholly unequal, it
made overtures of peacj through the French
ambassador. Accordingly, on the afternoon of
An?ust 12, M. Cambon. ,-.s the plenipotentiary
cf Spain, and the secretary of state, as tbe
plenipotentiary of the United States, signed a
protocol.
Immediately upon the conclusion of the pro
tocol, I Issued a proclamation or August 12,
suspending hostilities on the part of the United
States. The necessary orders to that end were
6t once given by telezraph. Tha blockade of
the ports of Cuba and San Juan tie Porto Kico
was in like manner raised. On August 1. the
muster out of 1 xj.-.-O.) volunteers, or as ceir that
number as was found to b practicable, was
ordered. The military cummittees to superin
tend the evacuation of Cuba. Porto Kico and
the adjacent islands were forthwith appointed.
The heat I'uiumtulun.
Pursuant to the fifth article of the protocol.
I appointed William Ii. Lav. lately secretary
cf state; Cash man K. Divii. William P. Frye
and George Grav. senators, the United States,
aadWhiiclaw Reid. to ho the piace commis
sioners on the part of the United States. Pro
ceeding in lu3 w?asoa to Paris thy there
met on the 1st of October five commissioners
similarly appointed on the part of Spain. The
negotiations have made hopeful progress, so
that I irusr soon to be abl2 to lay a dehnite
treaty of peace before the senate, with a re
view of the steps l?adin-j to its signature
Mllttarv Government for Time.
I do not discuss at th:s time the government
r the future of the new possessions which will
come to us the result of war with Spain. Such
a discussion will be appropriate after the
treaty of peace shall be ratified. In the mean
time and until conzress has lcrisla'ed other
wise, it will be, my duty to continue the mili
tary governments which have existed since our
occupation anl give its people security in life
and property and encouragement under a just
and be-ie fluent rule.

Lllm Arainit Turkey,
The newly accredited envoy of the United
States to the Ottoman port carries instruc
tions looking to the disposal of matters in con
troversy with Turkey for a number of years.
He i3 especially charged to press for a just set
tlement of our claims for indemnity by reason
of the destruction of property of American
missionaries resident in that country during
the Armenian troubles of 135 as well as for
the recognition of older claims of equal just
ness. Mttra Concerning the Traory.
The secretary of the treasury reports that
the receipts of the government from all sources
during the fiscal year ended June 30. lS2i. In
cluding .84. To l.?J3 received from sale of Pacifio
railroads, amounted to t435.3H.33i and Its ex
penditures to 144 t3"55.r81 There was obtained
from customs M43.573.C4I and from internal
revenue I170.W0.541. Our dutiable imports
amounted to 134.733,475. a decrease of S3,15fl,
6 over the preceding year, and importations
free of duty amounted to SI.4ltl73. a de
crease from the preceding year of i!J,524.Ca.
Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of
the preceding year by t24.213.0CS.
The total tax collected on distilled spirits was
192 519.99. on manufactured tobacco t39.23.52
and on fermented liquors SJJ.S15.411. We ex
ported merchandise during the year amount
ing to $1,2-31. .3r, an increase of tls0,4Si,774
from the preceding year.
It Is estimated upon the basis of preset
revenue laws that the receipts of the govern
ment for the year ending June 30. will be
i577.S71,507, and its expenditures 1589.874,617, re
sulting in a deficiency of tI12,rJ.001
On the 1st of December. 1S.-S, there was held
in the treasury gold cola amounting to fl3?,
411,547. pold bullion amounting to 134.502,545,
silver bullion amounting to IS3.3o3.iV) and
other forms of money amounting to 541.-63.9SL
On the same date the amount of money of all
kinds in circulation, or not included in treas
ury holdings, was 1.836.8.'9.5.4. an increase for
the year cf 1151.754. Estimating our popu
lation at 75. 1G4.00J at the time mentioned, the
per capita circulation was !2o.t9. On the name
date there was in the treasury fold bullion
amounting to il3i,50i.5;3.
The provisions for strengthening the re
sources of the treasury in connection with the
war has given Increased confidence In the pur
pose and power of the government to maintain
the present standard, and has established more
firmly than ever the national credit at home
and abroad,
I renew so much of my recommendation of
December. 1?37. as follows: 'That when any
of the United States notes are presentel for
redemption in gold such notes shall b3 kept
and set apart and only paid out in exchange for
cold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder
of the United States note prefers the gold and
gets it from the government, he should not
receive back from the government a United
States note without paying gold in exchange for
it. The rcasoi for thU Is made all the more
apparent when the government issues an issue
bearing debt to provide pold for the redemp
tion of United States notes a non-interest-bearindebt.
Surely it should not pay them
out .-.gain except on demand and for gold. If
they are put out in any other way they may re
turn again, to be followed by another bond is
sue to redeem them, another interesting-bearing
debt to redeem a non-interest bearing debt.
This recommendation was made In the belief
that such provisions of law would insure to a
greater degree the safety of the present stand
ard and Letter protect our currency from the
dangers to which it is subjected from a dis
turbance in the general business conditions of
the country.
In my judgment the present condition of the
treasury ampiy justifies the immediate enact
ment oi the legislation recommenied one year
ago, under wnich a portion of the gold hold
ings should bj placed in a trust fund from
which greenbacks should be redeemed upon
presentation, but when once redeemed should
not thereafter be paid out except for gold.
It is not to be inferred that oiher legislation
relating to our currency is not required. On
the contrary, there is an obvious demand for
it. The importance of adequate provision
which wiil insure to our future a money stand
ard related as our money standard now and to
that of our commercial rivals is generally
recognized.
The companion proposition that our domes
tic paper currency shall be kept safe and yet
be so related to the need3 of our industries and
internal commerce as to b adequate and re
sponsive to such needs is a proposition scarce
ly less important The su'-j let. In all its parts,
is commended te tha wise consideration of the
congress.
Investigation of Yellow Fever.
In mv last annual message I recommended
that congress authorize the appointment of a
commission for the purpose of making syste
matic investigations with reference to the
cause and provocation cf yellow fever. This
matter has acquired an increased importance
as a result of th military occupation of the
island of Cuba and the commircial intercourse
between this island and the United States
which we havo every reason to expect. The
sanitary problems connected with our new re
lations with th ; island of Cuba and the acquisi
tion of Porto Kijo are no lesi important than
those relating to finance, commerce and
administration.
locrrair of th Army.
Under the act of congress approved April 25,
1?V. authorizing the president in his discretion,
upon a declaration or war by congress, or a
declaration by congress that war exists. I di
rected the increase of the regular army to the
maximum cf authorized in s-Id act
There are now la the regular army 5".S5 offi
cers and men. Ja said act it was provided "that
at the end of any war in which the United
States may become involved the army shall be
reduced to a p? ace basis by the tranter in the
same arm of the servic j or absorption by promo
tion or honorable discaare under such regula
tions as the secretary of war may establish of su
pernumerary commissioned oncers and the hon
orable d:scfcarge or transfer cf su :ernumernry
enlisted me a. and nothinz contained in this act
shall be construed as authorizing the perma
nent increase of the command or enlisted force
cf the rvgular army beyond that now provided
by the law in forc; prior to the passage of this
act except as to the increase of 2i majors pro
vided for in section 1 hereof.
The importance of legislation for the per
manent increase of the armv is therefore mani
fest, and the recommendation of the secretary
of war for that purpose has my unqualiSed ap
proval There can t-e no question that at this
time and probably for some time in the future,
IOO.iXW men will be nons too many to meet the
necessities of the situation. At all events,
whether that number shall be required per
manently or not, the power should be given to
the president to enlist that force if. in his dis
cretion. I: should b-; neces-ary: and the further
discretion should be given him to recruit with
in the; above limit from the inhabitants of the
islands with the government of which we are
charged.
It is my purpose to muster out the entire vol
unteer army as soon as the congress shall pro
vide for the Increase of the regular establish
ment. This will be only an act of justice and
will be much appreciated by the brave men who
left their homes and employments to help the
country in its emergency.
1'acific Railroad.
In my last annual message I stated: "The
Union Pacific railway, main line, was sold
under the decree of the United States court for
the district of Nebraska the 1st and 2d of No
vember cf this yer. The amount due the
government consisted of the principal of the
subsidy bonds. 27,2.5.512 and the accrued in
terest thereon, '31. 211. 511.07. making the total
indebtedness 5c. 4 i5.2A75L Tht bid at the sale
covsred the first mortgage lien and the entire
mortgage claim of the covemment, principal
and interest."

stance of the government was postponed first
to December 15, 1397, and later, upon the appli
cation of the United States was postponed to
February 11 l-Si
It is a gratifying fact that the result of these
proceedings against the Union Pacific system
and the Kansas Pacific line is that the govern
ment has received on account of its subsidy
claim the sum of 164.75 1.223. 75. aa increase of
113. 997.163. 75 over the sum which the reorgan
ization committee originally agreed to bid for
the Joint property, the government receiving
Its whole claim, principal and Interest, in
Union Pacific and the principal of its debt on
the Kansas Pacific railroad.
department of Jostle Bolldloc-
I deem It my duty to call to the attention of
congress the condition of the present building
occupied by the department of Justica. Th
business of that department has Increased
greatly since it was established In its present
quarters. The building now occupied by It Is
neither large enough nor of suitable arrange
ment for the proper accommodation of the
business of the department. The su
pervising architect has pronounced It
unsafe and unsuited for the use
to which it Is put. I may likewise
refer to the inadequate accommodations pro
vided for the supreme court in the capitol and
suggest the wisdom of making provision for the
erection of a separate building for the court
and Its officers and library upon available
ground near the capitoL
The Font! Service.
The postal service of the country advances
with extraordinary growth. Within 20 years
both the revenues and the expenditures or t"c
post office department have multiplied three
fold. In the last ten years they have nearly
doubled. Our postal business grows much more
rapidly than our population. Jt now involves aa
expenditure of 1D0.000,X a year, numbers
73. i.O) post offices and enrolls 200,00 J employes.
This remarkable extension of a service which
U an accurate index cf the public conditions
presents pratifviag evidence of the advance
ment of education, of the increase of corn Enu
cleation and business activity and of the Im
provement of mail facilities, leading to their
constantly-augmenting use.
It Is pleasing to be able to say that the scrv
ice in the territory which has come under ouf
control is already materially improved.

I join with the secretary of the navy In reo
ommecding that the grades of admiral and
vice-admiral be temporarily revived, to b
fliled bv officers who have specially distin
guished themselves In the war with Spain.
The. Pension Roll.
There were on the pension rolls on June 31,
l?9i 915.714 names, an increase of nearly 13.010
over the number on the roll on the same day
of the preceding year. The amount appropri
ated by the act of December 2A 181-6. for th
payment of pensions for the fiscal year 1Sv8
was 14J.00J.( 0 . Eight million, seventy thou

Fabilc Land.
The public lands dispose! of by the govern

mations of February 2 ' 197. creating
thm. which adled an estimated amount of
13,9rd ."vOi a?res to the area embraced in the re

two new reserves were created during the year
the 1'inc Mountain an 1 Zara Lake reserves in
California, embracing 1.G4 '..& I acres, and the
Prcscott reserve in Arizona, embracing J '.243
acres, while the Peeos river la New Mexico has
be :n changed and enlarged to inciudi 120,000
additional acres.
The Indians.
The special attention of th- congr?ss is called
to that part of the report of tho secretary of
the interior in relation tj the five civilized
tribes. It is noteworthy that the general con
dition of the Indians shows marked progress.
But one outbreak of a serious character oc
curred during the year and that among the
Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, who happily
have been suppressed. While it has not yet
been practicable to enforce all the provisions of
the act of June SS, I8. 'Tor the protection of
the peop'e of tha Indian territory and for
other purposes," it is having a salutary efJect
upon the nations composing the fire tribes.
The Dawes commission reports that the most
gratify ing results and rreatcr advance toward
the attainment of the objects of the govern
ment have been secured in the past year thaa
in any previous year. I cannot too strongly In
dorse the recommen latioa cf the commission
and of the secretary of the interior for the
necessity of providing for the education cf the
30.J white children resident ia the Indiaa
territory.
The department of Acrlcalture.
The department of agriculture has been
active la the past year. Explorers have been
sent to many of the countries of the eastern
and western hemispheres for seeds and plants
that may be useful to the United Stales and
with the further view cf opening up markets
for our surplus products. The foresiry division
of the department is civing special at
tention to the treeless repions of our country
and Is introducing species specially adapted to
semi-arid regions.

The Secretary of the Treasiiry
Hakes His Annual Report.
H05EY CIRCULATING 15 PORTO RICO.
(secretary Gage Condemns the Present
Financial System of tbe United State
and Advocate a. Itank !tote
Currency to Ita Flaee.
Washington, Dec. 7. The report of
the secretary of the treasury to the
speaker of the house of representatives
was made public yesterday. In the
report Secretary Gag-e says: The rev
enues of the government from all
sources for the fiscal year ended June
SO, 1S33, were S434,S33,3o3.75. The ex
penditures for the same period were
S532,31,20LS.
Ia discussing the question of in
creasing the American merchant ma
rine the secretary says:
War with Spain and the annexation of the
Hawaiian archipelago, which have changed
the political and commercial relations of the
United States not only with Cuba. Porto Kico,
Hawaii and the Phil ipplnes, but also with the
continents between which and North America
those Islands are stepping stones, require the
prompt adoption of an affirmative maritime
policy by the United States.
The subject of money in Porto Rico
is discussed at length. The secretary
says.
The existing currency cf that Island consists
of silTer coifi3 known as peso and centavos.
The coins bar no fixed relation to gold, not
being anywhere redeemable in the yeilow coin
It Is unnecessary here to point out at any
lensth the general evil results upon industry
and commerce of a currency medium so out of
harmony with the world's money as to induce
a widely-fluctuating rate of exchange. It is
highly important that American capital should
find no obstacles in its transfer to and from
Porto Rica
It Is, therefore, suggested that, at the proper
time, action be taken by congress to assimilate
the currency of Porto Rico to that of the
United Slates, so far and so rapidly as this can
be done without unduly disturbing existing
conditions and contract relations in Porto
Rico. This, it is believed, can be accomplished
by making customs dues in the Island payable
in American money, yet receiving the silver
pesos and centavos at a fixed relation to our
dollar.
The subject of currency and bank
ing is treated at length. The secretary
says:
In submitting my report. I feel it my duty to
impress upon congress as best I may. the im
portant subject of currency and banking re
form. With a financial svstem condemned by
the Judgment cf the most experienced and wise,
botn at home and abroad, its evils illustrated
In daily business and emphasized In recurring
panics, we faiL with an obtuse timidity, to face
the questions which must be met and rightly
solved before Industry and commerce can be
established upon enduring conditions of secu
rltv. The arguments against povernment issues of
paper money as a medium for commercial ex-
chanpes have been full- iade and need not be
repeated in detail. Its rigidity, its failure to
meet demands where demand Is most urgent,
the dependency of the whole industrial struc
ture upon the state of the revenue and public
expenditure these are important links in. that
chain of argument The menace to our domes
tic aSairs, several times recurring from a
threatened change in the standard under which
they are carried on. and our foreign trade set
tled, has been a companion evil perhaps the
greater of the two.
The proposal to substitute bank issues for
government notes Is opposed with many honest
prejudices and assailed by bitter denunciations.
The first arise from a failure to comprehend
the true philosophy of a paper currency and
must ba patiently considered. The latter ob
scure the question by reckless statements.
charging that all propositions for currency re
form arc bank conspiracies to exploit the peo
ple.
I shall not be outside of my duty if I venture
to point out. in at least one important respect,
the advantages to the poorer districts of the
country of a properly constituted bank curren
cy. It may be done by fairly -describing the
course of the financial movement as It now
goes on. and by presenting in contrast the
movement as it would go on under the condi
tions advocated. It is a familiar fact that.
In the period of harvesting and crop moving.
the currency Is strongly drawn from the
centers to the country districts When this
movement is over, the currency again tends to
ward the centers. The currency flows to the
Center to pay loans occasioned bylisusaand
other general indebtedness, and also to secure
the benefit of the country banker for a portion
of his funds which in a dull period would other
wise lie unemployed in his hands. At present.
the currency so sent consists almost entirely
of legal-tender notes and treasury notes that
is to say. In the money which the law recog
nizes as lawful reserve.' Thus received by th'
bankers In the money centers, it becomes a
reserve for deposits in the relation of
one to four. Now, deposi's may
be increased by loans as well as bv the deposit
of cash. A loan for 110,000 or ll'jO.OOU goes to
the borrower's credit upon the bank's books
and swelis the deposit account by so much.
True, the borrower may check against this
fund, but his check may also be deposited In
the same bank. In which case it Is a mere trans
fer to another account: or. If it be deposited in
another bank and paid in money by the lending
bank, it is still a transfer. The total deposits
cf all the banks are swelled by this original
loan.
In confirmation thit this expansive move
ment is fairly described I quote from the New
York Herald of November 13 as follows: "Com
paring yesterday's (clearing house) statement
with that of five weeks ago. it appears that the
banks hold 13.0i.OOO more money and have
expanded their loans by the surprising
amount of I51.VX.0JJ. the increase in de
posits' resulting from these two items being no
less thaa IC-5.U-C.0XL" It can be easily per
ceived that thi possibility of Increasing loans
aralnst an inflow of reserve funds la the pro
portion of four to one is a temptation to which
the city bank is likely to yield. It must be re
membered that this inward movement of cur
rency from the country "occurs at the time cf
year when commercial activities are the least
and the general requirements for the use of
loan3 In the Interior are the smallest.
The efforts of the banks at the cen
tors to increase their loans cause in
terest to falL The fall ia the rate
of interest causes interest and divi
dend paying securities to rise. The rise in se
curities induces speculative buying- The spec
ulative buyer becomes the banks borrowing
customer. The banker is thus enabled to "put
out his funds." as he is apt to term it, though
he really does no such thing. He ke.ps his
funds, but, ia the way described, he swells his
deposit liability until his funds on hand are
mace answerable to the rule of one cash to four
liabilities, or 5 per cent against his de
posits. It is in the condition above described, with
varying degrees of regularity and Intensity,
that the financial status is found when the
crops in the west and south approach harvest
that is to say. a maximum of loans and
deposits; a minimum in cash reserves
During the season until then the
country banker ha3 found that his
drafts and checks on his eastern correspond
ents, distributed to his customers, supplied
their needs for instruments of exchange and
payment; but he fin-is that foathe payment of
farm wages, the purchase &-d transfer of farm
prodsrts, such instruments arw not adequate;
cah is required for these purposes, e;th;r la
rretall'.c money cr paper currency. This forces
hij to jUS-a. rfi'r':'!-- !n the fom cf
money by express on his eastern ba'snces.
Nay. more: if the crops be large and prices
good, he Is forced to supplement his own
resources by borrowing for period at the
centers. Els correspondent at the center, la
meeting his requisition for the money flue hla
country, is obliged to take It from what had
before constituted his legal reserve. This dis
turbs the equilibrium of relationship. To re
cover his position he turns npon the street and
calls in a portion of his loans. If the inter! of
banker, after thus calling for the balances doe
him, asks In addition for a loan, the city bank
er is often obliged to inform him that "money
Is very close" and he cannot accommodate him.
Gradually, after more or less strain and anx
iety, sometimes bordering on panic, sometimes
resulting in panic, a readjustment is secured.
Crops from the Interior not seldom forced
from the producer's hands, with little regard
to price, because of his Inability to borrow
from his local bankers move to the seaboard.
The strain on the country Is relaxed. Again
currency in the form of reserve funds" moves
to the center. Again one dollar thus received
becomes effective as reserve for four dollars of
liability. Money is quoted easy, as the pros
pect for summer dullness becomes as sured.
Whoever has followed this delineation of cuf
financial movement, and those who are familiar
with the facts which are thus portrayed, ought
not to have trouble in perceiving that the bot
tom cause of the irregular and deranging ef
fects described is to be found in a fixed
volume of paper money clothed with
full powers of a legal tender. Upon
this money itself a credit obllpatioa
other credit obligations, la the form of
bank deposits through bank loans, may be
built up in the proportion of four to one. With
the volume of paper money thus fixed with no
natural movement toward its retirement when
not needed In legitimate trade the tendency to
build the four-story structure upon it as a per-
marent base Is irresistible. The withdrawal
of the base by those who really own it causes
the structure to vibrate and threatens it with a
faiL
Consider now. as briefly as may be, the prac
tical working of a bank note currency non
legal tender if substituted for the paper money
Issued by the government Verification may
be found by those who will look for It In sys
tems now current in France, Germany. Scot
land and Canada; or. if our own records be pre
ferred, the New England system of 4) years
ago. or those then in vogue in Indiana, Iowa
and Louisiana, will be equally good examples.
When, with the recurring needs of the in
terior to handle Its products of the farm, the
factory, and the mine, the power to issue cir
culating notes may be summoned into use,
then the needs of industry will coincide with
the" profit-moving motives of the banker, and
the full value of this latent power wi l be ex
perienced, not ia the centers, where bank
notes are not n?eded and will not circulate, but
in the interior, where raw products are raised,
and where the busy wheels of shop and factory
certify that labor wages are to be paid.
The power of the bank note, so temporarily
suspended, will always be restored in full upon
the call of industry. The power of our present
currency, on the contrary, is not suspended. It
is. as pointed out. inevitably misdirected. It
artificially stimulates speculative activity in
securities at the center It practically ab
sorbs the credit powers at times when they
should bo made serviceable to the .whole coun
try. It ministers to the speculator, it preju
dices the producer, the merchant and the man
ufacturer, though, at last, all suffer from
its deranging influences. These are the rea
sons, the more important reasons, why our
banking system should be reformed and made
effective to commercial and industrial needs;
and these same reasons, with others not here
set forth, call for the elimination, in a safe and
proper way, of the injurious interference In our
t urrency system by the legal tender paper
money of the government.
If it be conceded that the legal tender money
issued by the government does not possess the
qualifications to make it a proper factor in the
country's exchanges of products and manufac
tures; if the fact also be admitted that It is a
deranging and disturbing factor In its relation
to industry and commerce, then the time has
come to substitute for it a currency which will
adequately, economically and safely meet the
ever growing needs of the country, rapidly de
veloping, as it is. in the power of production.
in the number cf its people and the importance
of its domestic and foreign trade.
In the nature of things the banker is the
proper agency for operating this important
function. He must have motive for his action
or he will not exercise it. Given this motive.
he will, like the laborer, the merchant or the
prcfessional man. be diligent In the employ
ment of his powers.

their leisure Speaker Reed received a warm
welcome from bo'h sides when he ascended the

THE GILLETT FAILURE.
Thousands or Cattle Hart Been Taken
from the Kanch Jiear Woodbine Stories
of Cattle Dying Sot Exaggerated.
Woodbine, Kan., Dec L The
frantic ellorts of the creditors of Grant
G. Gillett to seize all the property of
the ex-cattle king are now complete as
far as Woodbine is concerned Thou
sands of head of cattle have been
taken away since Gillett threw up the
sponge, and what property that the
sheriff of Dickinson county has not
seized has been taken by the men who
hold Gillett's notes. Not more
than GOO cattle remain on the
ranch which drew buyers from all
parts of the west and which in its day
has supported 25,030 head. The stories
told of cattle dying here of exposure
and hunger are not in the least exag
gerated. The banks of Lyons creek,
alonj? which the 11 corrals are located,
are strewn with dead stock worth
from S20 to S-53 per head.
The animals have not been fed regu
larly since last Friday, and, being con
fined by heavy barb-wire fences, have
died in the cold like sheep with the
murrain. Cows are so weak that the
drovers knock them down with the
lash of the whip, and the poor brutes
are so far gone that they never rise
again.

with the Wichita & WeEtern, amounts

Washington, Dec T. The measure
which will serve as the basis for the
consideration of congress thi3 session,
looking to the increase and remodel
ing of the regular army, has been
completed by Gen. Miles and yester
day was handed by him to Secretary
Alger, who will transmit it to con
gress after he has had an opportunity
to make any changes that he may
deem desirable. The explanation of
the broad general principles of the
bill (one feature of which provides for
the creation of three new offices, a
general and two lieutenant generals
of the army, in accordant with the
practice of modern military nations)
is d:sclosed in a letter from Gen- Miles
to Secretary Alger, ia which the
writer says:
I have the honor to submit herewith the
draft of a bill for the reorganization of the
United States armv, based on a strength of one
soldier to l.utO of the population of th2 United
States, and 100 soldiers to 1.00J of the popula
tion In the dependent colonies approximately,
100,0 -0 men. My recommendations are for
what I believe to be the be-t interests of the

The proportion of artillery, cavalry and In
fantry Is in accordance with the immediate
necessities of the United SJatcs. We have
4.0JJ miles of coast, with -7 principal harbors,
where are located millions of people and prop
erty of almost inestimable value. That they
should be properly defended is demanded by
every consideration of prudence and good ad
ministration. In addition to this we have the
important harbors in Porto Kico, Cuba and the
Philippines to defend, requiring a large force
of artillery.
The organization recommended is such as to
give rank in proportion to the Important duties
and great responsibilities required of the dif
ferent ofScers In our service, and is similar to
the organization which his been found most
emcient in the armies of all other civilized na
tions, and also to that which was found to be
most effective in the confederate army between
the years 1551 and ISG'j. A similar organiza
tion has been recommended by Gam Sherman
and Lieut. Gen. Scohcld.
CONGRESSIONAL I'ltOCKE DINGS.
Washington, Dec 7. The first note
of the anti-expansionists was sounded
in the senate yesterday by Senator
Vest, of Missouri, who introduced the
following joint resolution:
That under the constitution of the United
States no power is given to the federal govern
ment to a-uire territory to be held and gov
erned permanently as colonies.
The colonial system of Kuropean nations
cannot be established under our present con
stitution, bat all territory acquired by this
government, except such small amount as may
be necessary fur coaling stations, correction ol
boundaries and similar governmental purposes,
must be acquired and governed with the pur
pose of ultimately organizing such territory
into states suitable for admission into the union.
Senator Hale, of Maine, introduced a
joint resolution to erect a monument
in Havana to the battlestiip Maine
victims.
A brief discussion of the navigation
laws was precipitated by the consider
ation of a bill amending those laws by
the addition of a provision that foreign-built
vessels, wrecked in the
United States, purchased by citizens
of this country and repaired to the ex
tent of three-fourths of their value,
shall be subject to forfeiture if they
engage subsequently in the coastwiso
trade of the United States. Finally it
was made a special order for next Mon
day. At 1:30 p. m. the senate ad
journed. The house was in session les3 than
half an hour yesterday, when tbe
deaths of Representatives iorthway,
of Ohio, and Love, of Mississippi, were
