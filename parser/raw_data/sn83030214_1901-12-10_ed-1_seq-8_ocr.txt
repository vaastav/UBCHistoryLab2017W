Without striving for literary effect, but seem
ingly with the purpose of sharing a multitude
of pleasant recollection? with his friends and
musical peop> generally. Mr. William Mason
■wrote down his observations made during an
active musical career of over fifty years, and
pi II III them in the pages of "The Century
Magazine." They have now been brought to
pether In a tasteful manner between binder's
boards, illustrated with portraits and reproduc
tiens in fa'- simile from th* author's autograph
album, provided with a handy index, and thus
m=de a nortion of the musical history of the
nineteenth century to which future writers will
turn v.ith much pleasure and some profit.
The work of the reproductive musician, like
th^t of the actor, is fleeting. Compositions re
n-.^in. ard. despite changes in tastes and ideals.
ttey retain something of their validity for the
historian who is what the word implies. Musi
<Li r- finances are creative activities in a
F.r.Pi". but ,1 is only the story of their effect
v^-n the people who hear them and record their
i:np:t:sions that remains after the performer
lias passed away. Memoirs, like those » of Mr.
Jlasni are therefore welcome to those who
would Slke to look at the heroes of a period
fTiVxr than :;.cir own. He lived his youth in
what be hirrr'if. though not given to hyperbole,
c£hs .."t ■•£<>lden ■ ■- ■•• ..f music in Weimar,
v ..en the cOd srand duke dreamed of perpetu
a:int, in music glories like those which Goethe,
Scbftler. Kfrd«-r and Wieland had given to the
lit:!? city's literary life It was the period when

raving spent the preceding; four years in Leip
sic. Dresden, Prague and elsewhere, studying
•with Mosehelefi, Mi II I. Hauptmann 'and Alex
ander Preysrh^ck. He also meets Chopin, Wag
ner. rhalberg End other lights.
Himself l^ng ■ concert pianist (it is interest
ing to note that he claims to have been the first
pianist to have given concerts exclusively of
pianoforte anisic and alone in America), and
one whose *-=rly artistic days were spent in such
distinguished presences, it is not surprising to
find Mr. Ma* filling many pages with descrip
tions of the manner it. which the pianists of
fifty years ago played. Such recollections are
of the kingdom of heaven in the eyes of the later
historical writer. Mr. Mason also carries his
observations down to the young artists of to
day, but here he contents himself, as a rule,
-with amiable peneralizings. He believes, evi
dently, that there is a saving virtue in growing
old gracefully and with a cheery view of th
•world as it stands, and a pleasant opinion of the
generation that has come to take the places of
the people who were the heroes of his early
pages. It is an amiable disposition; and we
should not quarrel "with it even if it made for
mischievous notions in criticism. There is. how
ever, more instruction in what he says about
old style players and old style playing than in
what he says about the new. He studied with
Moscheles, and it is plain from his description
that in that egotistical old master there still
lived some of the traditions which dated back
to the early days of the nineteenth century.
Moscheles, says Mr. Mason, was in a direct
line of descent from dementi and Hummel, and
the immediate predecessor of Thalberg. He was
fond of quoting the older authorities, of holding
them up as excellent examples for his pupils.
Be advocated a very quiet hand position, con
fining, as far as possible, whatever motion was
necessary to finger and hand muscles: and by
way of illustration, he said that dementi's
hands -were so level in position and quiet in
motion that he could easily keep a crown piece
on the back of his hand while playing the most
rapid passages. This is a clear reminder of the
old harpsichord days when fleetness of finger
and clearness of execution were the first requi
sites of playing, and strength of wrist was not
at all called for. Thalberg's playing was char
acterised by grace, elegance and finish in de
tail, and he played the arabesque scale passages
end arpeggios with which he was fond of orna
menting his melodies with rapidity, clearness
and brilliancy. Mr. Mason accepts the old story*
that the inventor of the manner of "writing
which became identified with Thalberg's name
was the harpist. Parish-Alvars, forgetful of the
lact which Dehn established long ago that
Giuseppe Francesco Pollini used the device long
■before either Parish-Alvars or Thalberg in his
"Metodo pel Clavicembalo."
Mr. Mason did not hear Chopin, but Drey
schoek Uf««*4 to describe his playing as extremely
delicate and exquisite, 'hese qualities being cul
tivated because of Chopin's lack of physical
ftrength. Two anecdotee are told in illustra
tion. The nrßi was told by L-reyschock, who
said that he had once attended a Chopin concert
in Pari6 in company with Thalberg. They
listened with delight throughout the perform
ancp. but on reaching the street Thalberg began
shouting at the top of his voice.
What' 6 the matter?" askrd Dreyschock. in
astonishment.
"Oh." said Thalberg. "I've been listening to
piano al! evening, and now, for the sake of con
trast. ~i want a little forte."
The other story was vouched for by Mr. Fran
cis Korbay: A young and robust pianist had
been playing Chopin's "Polonaise Militaire" to
th? composer, and had broken a string. When,
in confusion, he began to apologize, Chopin said
to him: "You Tig man. if I had ynur strength
and played that polonaise as it should be played,
there wouldn't *»c a sound string left in the in
strument by the time I got through.'
Henselt s playing was specially characterized
toy a warm emotional touch and a delicious
legato, causing '.he tones to melt one into th"
other, but without confusion or lack of clear
rt .<t: Preyschook was especially famous for his
wonderful left hand and his octave playing, and
accomplished the feat of piayir.g the left hand
part of Chopin's study in C minor in octaves,
though it cost him twelve hours of study a day
Jor six wt-eks to prepare himself for the feat,
which he attempted under the stimulus of a
r»rr.ark rr.ade l>y TY.maschek. his teacher. Of
Lift's i>ying we must permit Mr. Mason to
Fj.eak ir. 'rrs own words:
Time and again at Weimar I heard Liszt play.
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that
he was the greatest pianist of the nineteenth
century. Liszt was what the Germans call an
•Erscheinupg" — ah epoch-making genius. Taus
tt:ic is reported to have said of him: "Liszt
dwells alcne up'"n a solitary mountain top. and
none of us can approach him." Rubinstein said
to Mr. William Steinway in the year 1573: "Put
all the rest of us together and we would not
make one Liszt. " This was doubtless hyperbole.
• but nevertheless significant as expressing the
enthusiasm of pianists universally conceded to
"be of the highest rank. There have been other
great pianists, some of whom are now living,
but I must dissent from those writers who
affirm that any of these car. be placed on a level
■with Liszt. Those who make this assertion are
too young to have heard Liszt *ther than in
his declining years, and it is unjust to compare
the playing of one who had icng since passed
: hie prime with that of one who is still in it.
In the year 1873; Rubinstein told Theodore
Thomas that it was fully worth while to make
a trip to Europe to bear Liszt play, but he
added: "Make haste and go at once; he Is al
ready beginning" to % break up. and his playing
is not up 10 the standard of former years, al
though his personality is as attractive as ever."
." . . The difference between Liszt's playing
anC that of others was the difference between
creative genius and interpretation. Hi« genius
flashed through every pianistlc phrase, it illu
minated a composition to its innermost recesses,
i and yet his wonderful effects, strange as it must
«<«. «n proved without tte aav.ijw^o!
muscles: hence a lack of econoraj in the ex
penditure of his energies. »
Mr. Mason knew Oottschalk well, and «*»£s
dnated by his playing, which was full of brill
iancy and bravura. "His strong, rhythmic ac
cent, his vigor and dash, were exciting and al
ways around enthusiasm. He was the pe.fec
tion of his school, and his efforts had the , spark c
and effervescence of champagne." Kubinstein
had transcendent ability, but he was too im
pulsive, and lost self-control and self-possession.
He was. therefore, an uneven player, but a thor
oughly conscientious artist. Yon Biilow s Chopin
playing impressed Mr. Mason as dry. and his
Beethoven interpretations lacked warmth and
fervency. But he had an extraordinary memorj.
remarkable technic. was invariably accurate
and precise in his careful observation of rhythm,
accentuation and phrasing. m^-i,;
Mr. Mason touches lightly but interesting
on the domestic affairs of Yon Bulow and Wag
ner. The general impression has long been that
when the latter won the love of his wife away
from his friend the shock came near shattering
Yon Bfllow's mental as well as physical heath.
Mr. Mason says that he knew that Yon Bulow
had accepted the matter philosophically, and
in proof relates the following anecdote:
V r n ir r^ h x 2sr^£sii&|S
and I thought it just as well to arrive imme
diately at a clear understanding.
"Bulow- I said, "you will excuse me if I
touch on' a rather delicate subject Of course,

she naturally inherits from her father I was
entirely too small a personality for her. She
required a colossal genius like Wagners, and
he needed the sympathy and Inspiration. of an
intellectual and artistic "-Oman Wee <;0™;; 0 ™;
That they should have come together eventuall>
was inevitable."
Here, finally, are two contributions to what
the Germans would call the "characteristik" of
Mr. Mason's most admired master:
Deep beneath the surface there was in Liszt's
organization a religious trend which manifested
itself openly now and then, and there were oc
casions upon which his contrition displayed
itself to an inordinate degree. Joachim Raft
long his intimate friend and associate, told me
that these periods were sometimes of consider
able duration, and while they lasted he would
«eek solitude, and. going frequently to church,
would throw himself upon the flagstones be.ore
a Muttergottesbild. and remain for hours, as
Raff expressed it. so deeply absorbed as to oe
utterly unconscious of events occurring in his
presence.
Rubinstein also told me that on one occasion
he had been a witness of such an act on the
part of Liszt. One afternoon at dusk they were
walking together in the cathedral at Cologne,
and quite suddenly Rubinstein missed Liszt,
who had disappeared in a mysterious way. lie
searched for quite a while through the many
deluded nooks and corners of the immense
building, and finally found Liszt kneeling b< fore
a prie-dieu. so deeply engrossed that Rubinstein
had not the heart to disturb him. and so left the
building alone.
I have mentioned that Liszt was careful in
his dress He was also particular nhout the ap
pearanoe of his pupils. 1 remember tw"o in
stances which show how particular he was in
litt'e matters. I have been nearsighted all my
life and when I went to Weimar 1 wore eye
giasses, much preferring them to spectacles.
Eyeglasses were not much worn in Germany at
that time and were considered about as affected
as the mode of wearing a monocle. The Ger
mans wor" spectacles. I had not been in Weimar
long when Liszt said to me: "Mason. I don't lik^
to see you wearing those g'.asso?. T shall pond
my optician to tit your eyes with spectacles.
hardly thought that he was serious, and so pai.l
no attention to him. But sure enough, about a
week later there was a knock at my door, and
the optician presented himself, saying he had
come at the command of Dr. Liszt to examine
my eyes and fit a pair of spectacle? t'> them.
As 1 was evidently to have no say in the matter,
I submitted, and a few flays later 1 received two
pairs, one in a green and ono in a red case. I
thought them extremely unbecoming, but 1 was
very particular to put them on whenever I went
to see Liszt.
Not long afterward Liszt went to Pnr:=, and
when we called to see him after his return, and
h" was talking about his experiences there, he
said casually: "By th» way. Mason! 1 find thai
the gentlemen in Paris are wearing eyeglasses
now. In fact, they are considered quite comme
il faut, so I have no objection to your wearing
yours." As he did not ask me to ?pn! him the

day.
"YAWLBTG."
THE NARRATIVE OF A GLORIOUS VOY
AGE.
A YEAR IN A YAWT.. A True Tale of the Ad
ventures of Four Boys in a Thirty Foot Yawl.
By Russell Douhi^dav. From the Log of Cap
tain Ransom. Illustrated. Octavo, pp. viii, 353.
(Doubleday. Page & Co.)
This is the story of a trip that was in many
ways unique. The travellers were four boys.
and their boat, which they built themselves,
■wsp only thirty feet in length. Yet in her
they sailed from Lake Michigan, by way of
canals and rivers, to the mouth of the Missis
sippi; csasted thence along the shore of the Gulf,
rounded the end of Florida, and made their way
up the Atlantic Coast to Norfolk. Philadelphia
and New-York, by way of the Karitan Canal.
Continuing up the Hudson and through the
Erie Canal and the lakes, they finally reached
home, after a journey of more than seven
thousand miles. The motives of the chief en
gineer of this ambitious undertaking are set
forth in the following somewhat obvious but
most enthusiastic speech:
Listen. I've studied this thing out and I know
it can be done. You know what I want to be
and what I want to do. and there is no way of
seeing all kinds of boats and experiencing all
kindte of weather and conditions of water anil
climate except by seeing and experiencing them.
The best and most, thorough way of doing it,
it seems to me, is to go in a small boat you
have built yourself and see everything at first
hand.
Po the four boys went, and they saw most of
the things they wanted to see and experienced
more kinds and conditions of water and wind
than seemed to them at the time at all desir
able. The Gazelle, as they named their yawl,
had numerous narrow escapes from various
kinds of disaster. She was bumped by other
boats, ran into bridge piers because the wind
failed them and the draw would not open, ran
rapids and dodged reefs. Off Baton Rouge the
yawl encountered a terrific ice storm, which
forced her to lie to for several days, and nearly
sunk her into the bargain, with the weight of
ic* it deposited upon her. Her youthful crew
had to*turn out in lively style with axes and
chop the ice off her decks, or she would doubt
less have gone to the bottom. It was not a
grateful task, for the thermometer stood at "1
degrees below zero, and the yawl pitched and
rolled like a crazy thing in the force of the gale.
"And this in the Sunny South!' wrote the weary
captain sarcastically in his log.
Off Pt. Josephs Bay the wind failed the Ga
xelle. and one of her wmsw put off in the yawl's
tender and went fishing. He caught the biggest
fish he had ever seen. It was nothing less than
a 12-foot shark, and for a time it looked as if
the shark was fflhing for boy and not the boy
BMr shark. However, the crew got the fish after
a long fight. Not long afterward, the young
voyagers passed a fleet of sponge fishing boats,
had a ride on a monster turtle, and performed
other feats all of which are veraciously recorded.
The Gazelle proved a stanch boat, and her crew
a courageous and skilful one. When the age and
inexperience of the young sailors are taken into

consideration, the Gazelle's voyage seems scarce
ly lese noteworthy than any one of the voyages
tcroaa the ocean made in an open boat by older
sailors.
