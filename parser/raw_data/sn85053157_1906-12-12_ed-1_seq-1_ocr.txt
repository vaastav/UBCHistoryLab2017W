EQUAL RATES FOR ALL.
Senator Ueyburn Introduces Olli To Com
pel Square Freight Rates
Washington , Dec. 6.—Senator
Heyburn, of Idaho, today introduced
a bill in the senate amendatory of the
interstate commerce acts, under which
transportation companies are per
mitted to charge more for a short in
land haul than for a long distance
water terminal haul. The object of
the bill is to afford relief to the cities
of the northwest against which the
railroad companies have been discrim
inating, such as Spokane, Butte,
Boise and other non-terminal inland
cities.
Under the existing law, as inter
preted by the courts, interstate com
merce carrying roads charge a greater
freight rate from Chicago to Butte,
Spokane, and other inland^citles than
they do to Seattle. Nearly all of the
railway companies [of the northwest
are today charging to {inlandjipoints
the through rate, plus the ^local rate,
from the Pacific coast backjto these
places. It is done under^the pretense
of the necessities arising from the wa
ter competition to coast points, com
pelling the railroads to)«give those
points cheaper rates than they would
otherwise be able to do.
There is no real substance in this
point acd Senator Heyburn's bill pro
vides: "That it shall beZunlawful for
any common carrier, subject to the
provisions of this act to charge or re
ceive any greater compensation for
the transportation of passengers or of
like kinds of property for a shorter
than for a longer distance over the
same line in the same direction, the
shorter being included within the
longer distance, but this shall not be
construed as authorizing any common
carrier within the terms of this act to
charge or receive a greater compensa
tion for a shorter than for a longer
distance
The m asure is of vast importance
to all interior business in the United
States, particularly to Spokane and
other northwestern non-terminal rail
road cities.
The result of .the present system is
centrifugal in its action, throwing the
business from the center to the rim of
the country under conditions unjust
to the producing centers of the United
States which deprives them of the ad
vantages of their location relative to
the products of the country surround
ing them and compels them in many
instances to ship the raw products
which they produce to the manufac
turers and ship the manufactured pro
ducts back at the through rate to the
coast, plus the local rate back from
the coast to such point and also de
prives the central portions of the
country from the benefit of proximity
to the field of production. Senator
Heyburn will press his bill vigor
ously before congress this winter and
hopes to secure its enactment into law.
Small Bills Are Searee.
Washington , Dec. «.—The secre
tary of the treasury today issued the
following open letter to all banking
institutions of the United States:
"A very marked scarcity of small
bills is noticeable everywhere and the
treasury is powerless to relieve the
situation. In the absence of legisla
tion allowing national banks io issue
a larger proportion of their circula
tion in denominations of $5, the banks
themselves must be relied upon to al
leviate the strain as far as possible.
"There are in circulation nearly
815,000,000 in silver certificates of the
denomination packed away in the
vaults of the various banking institu
tions and held as reserve. Permit me
respectifully to ask that each institu
tion, state and national, search the
money in its vaults and send these
ten-dollar certificates to the treasury.
They will promptly be converted in
ones and twos, to the very great re
lief of the country. It is the only
remedy. Let no bank complain of
conditions until it has literally
searched its own vaults and contrib
uted as far as possible to the relief of
the situation."
To Return Tainted Money
Washington , Dec. 6.—Before he
retires from office President Roosevelt
intends to have refunded to the policy
holders of the "Big Three" insurance
companies, the money contributed to
the republican national committee by
the three big insurance companies,
the Equitable Life, the Mutual Life
and the New York Life Insurance com
panies.
The aggregate of their contribu
tions, made out of the "yellow doi
funds of the companies, was $158,000.
The fact that be was elected with the
help of money taken illegally from the
policy-holders of the three companies
has nettled the president sorely for
many months. He feels that it has
placed a taint upon his administra
tion, as well as upon his public ca
reer, and he means to have the stain
wiped out.
It leaked out today for the first time
that the president has already taken
steps to have the money refunded and
that this would have been done long
ago but for the obstinacy of Post
master General George B. Cortelyou
and Cornelius Bliss of New York.
Cortelyou was chairman of the na
tional committee during the campaign
of 1904, and stills holds the position.
Bliss was, and is, treasurer of the re
publican national committee. It is
known positively that President
Roosevelt sent for both Cortelyou and
Bliss several months ago and directed
them to pay back, with interest, what
ever sums the Mutual, Equitable and
New York Life contributed to his
campaign fund.

Money Wanted For Waterways.
Washington , Dec. 6.—Nearly a
thousand delegates are in Washing
ton in attendance on today's opening
of the national rivers and harbors
congress. Speaker Cannon and Rep

our purpose to appeal to politicians:
in fact we don t want them. It is to
be a matter which is to come directly
from the people, and or myself 11
don care whether President Roose
velt likes it or not. To my mind he
has nothing to say about it. The
people have absolute and implicit con
fidence in him and we're going to see
that they elect him a third term.

COAL I1AKONS INDICTED.
1'tuh Grand Jnry Makes Accusations
Against Railroads and Others.
Salt Lake Dec. ~.—The federal
grand jury which has been investigat
ing coal land frauds in Utah and
charges that railroad corporations
have discriminated against certain
shippers made a partial report this
afternoon in the United States court
to Judge John A. Marshall.
Indictments were returned against the
Union Pacific Railway company, the
Oregon Short Line Railway company,
the Union Pacific Coal company, the

tion of the interstate commerce law,
alleging discrimination against D. J.
Sharp, a coal dealer in Salt Lake
City, who was forced out of business
after he had cut prices below the prices
charged by the other dealers in coal.

turned, bench warrants had been is
sued and the grand jury had ad
journed until the first Monday in Jan
uary, Assistant Attorney General
Maynard stated that when the grand
jury reconvenes after the holidays, the
inquisition will be resumed. The in
dictments returned today, he said,
mark only the beginning of the gov
ernment's probing operations in Utah
and Wyoming, and that violations of
the law alleged in these indictments
are only incidents of a gigantic sys
tem of fraud that have been in opera
tion in the west for many years.
The indictments against the Utah
Fuel company and the six agents of
the company is based on the methods
used in acquiring about 1,400 acres of
coal land in Sevier county, Utah.
The lauds were filed ou in March,
1905.
In a statement made this afternoon,
Attorney Maynard outlined the meth
ods alleged to have been pursued, as
stated by wituesses called before the
grand jury.

Millions Need Food
Washington , Dec. 7.—A serious
famine affecting millions of people
prevails throughout Central China,
according to a cablegram received at
the state department today from
Shanghai. This is the first informa
tion the government here has received
that such a serious condition exists.

For A lüg Game Preserve.
Washington . Dec. 7.—The sov
ereignty of state was the subject of an
earnest debate in the house today,
growing out of the consideration of a
bill to establish a preserve in the
Olympia forest reserve ln the 8tate f
Washington. The bill was passed
without diljCUä , i0U . Mr . Monde«, of
Wyoming, insisted that the supreme
court had ruled that Btate , s fiOVereI „ n
of a sovereign state. Lacey, of Iowa, I
in charge of the measure, told of the!
president's interest in the matter, and i
said that the creation of a game pre-:
serve meant the protection of the last !
over its birds, game and fish, and that
to create such a game preserve and
place it under national supervision
was clearly an invasion of the rights

.Make Artificial hiainonJs
London , Dec. 7
the members of thu
—At a meeting of
Royal society to
day. Herbert Wood described his pro
iking diamonds artificially
cess for la:
Wood 's artificial stones have de
ceived the best known experts, who

take place in the diamond trade.
Women Fight Butchers.
New York , Dec. 7. —The women of
the east side are winning their fight
agaist the butchers who recently
raised the price of meat. The packers
it is stated have capitulated to the re
tailers upon the threat of the latter to
close 5,000 shops that cater to the ten
ements of the congested districts.
The price of meat was formerly 14
cents a pound. A week or two ago it
was raised to 10 cents because, as the
shopkeepers said, the wholesaler had
increased the price to them. It is the
extra two cents that has caused the
so-called "strike"' of the women of
the tenements. The news that the
wholesale meat dealers had lowered
the price a cent a pound to the re
tailers came late yesterday and caused
rejoicing among the women.
Denatured Alcohol In Demand.
Peokia, 111., Dec. 7.—The Atlas
distillery, a property of the American
Spirits Manufacturing company, in
all probability will open today for the
manufacture of denatured alcohol at
its full capacity of 8,000 barrels a

new product have been received far in
advance of its initial denaturing pro
cess and that the distillery will be
kept working the year round produc
ing this class of goods.
Pay Fine of llnlf Million.
Philadelphia , Dec. 7. —Announce

had made a settlement at a cost of
about half a million dollars of all
cases brought in Pennsylvania by Dr.
13. II. Warren, dairy and food com
missioner, against persons selling
candies containing glucose.

for b.euching purposes io us manu
facture.
A number of cases were settled by
payment of fines and cost* by the
dealers arrested, but E. Bedford,
president of the Corn Products com
pany, in a letter sent to Dr. Warren,
agreed to pay all costs in the remain
ing cases with the understanding thai
they be dismissed. He said the cru
sade would cost his company half a
million dollars.
Ilryan Comments On Message.
Lincoln , Neb., Dec. 7.—Comment
ing on President Roosevelt's message
W. j. Bryan says there is much in it
that is good. Mr. Bryan says:
"The message contains much that is
democratic and for which the general
public may well thank him. It con
tains some things that ought to arouse
severe criticism.
"The president boldly appropriates
some doctrines which the democrats
have been advocating, but on the other
hand he announces doctrines which
are so absurd as to excite amusement
if the suggestion came from a loss
prominent source. In some cases he
takes advanced ground; in some cases
he appropriates ground already tak
en."
Mr. Bryan complains that what the
president says on the subject of gov
ernment by injunction will not be sat
isfactory to the laboring man or to
those who respect the right of trial by
jury. [
Half of Town Damaged.
Morenci , Ariz., Dec. 7.—The Clif
ton fiood was the most disastrous
ever known there, over half the town
being damaged, about 12 houses and
10 other buildings swept away and be
tween 15 and 20 people drowned, most
ly Mexicans. The water in the river
is still very high. The high water
mark was two feet higher than ever
before. The people left their homes
and slept on the hillsides around
campfires. The Chase creek district
was almost wiped out. Great damage
was done by the breaking of the con
centrator dam in Morenci. TheC'oro
nado railroad between Clifton and
Metcalf was almost entirely washed i
out, and it will take four weeks to re
pair the damage to the track.
The damage is estimated close to $1,
000.WO. The town will probably now
be moved to higher ground.
The rain lasted four days, melting
the snow in the mountains. It is said
»ha*. fifteen houses have been destroyed
in Metcalf but no one drowned. Mo
retici was not damaged. The < ; i 1 a :
river now is booming, and it is feared
that more damage will be done along
t*.' railroads.
TIIE OFFICIAL OCTOPI S HINTER.
Commissioner Garfield Makes Roport l"p
on Result of His Campaign.
Washington , Dec. 9.—The annual
report of Commissioner of Corpora
tions Jas. R. Garfield, made public to
day, devotes special attention to the
investigations of transportation of
oil and the operations of the Stan
dard Oil company.
"During the investigation," says
the report, "It was discovered that a
very widespread system of railway
discrimination existed, in favor of the
Standard Oil company, affecting a
very large proportion of the country
and resulting substantially in giving
the Standard Oil company an over
whelming advantage in almost all
sections of the country. The system
has been in existence for a number of
years, and by virtue of it the Stand
ard has been able to restrict or ell
minate competition throughout many
parts of the country, and thereafter
enjoy the benefits of monopoly. These
discriminations took various forms,
often different in their nature, and so
skilfully concealed that their existence
was rarely suspected, even by the ac<
tive competitors of the Standard, al
though such competitors knew that, in
general, they were doing business at a
disadvantage.
"Duri ng the fiscal year indictments,
containing 8,193 counts, were returned
by the various grand juries as the re
sult of this investigation.
"A most striking and important re
sult of the investigation of the bureau
is that tho roads canceled nearly |all
the secret rates or improper discrim
inations and, in many cases, the dis
criminations in open rates. The ship
pers of oil advise the bureau that, for
the first time in many years, they are
now rapidly obtaining equality of
trade treatment from tho different
transportation companies.
"The work iu other phases of the
oil industry and the investigations of
the tobacco, steel, sugar and coal in
dustries are well advanced. Special
reports thereon will be made in due
course. An inquiry into canal and
water transportation has been
started."
Commissioner Garfield urges again
the necessity of the establishment of
federal inspection and supervision of
the greater industrial corporations
engaged in interstate and foreign com
merce. He says it will not interfere
with the power and authority of the
state uudcr which the corporations
are created under the state laws, but
will merely restore individual respon
sibility and prevent the corporations
from being tho hiding places of irra
sponsible or corrupt mergers.

Shot By Desperate Woman.
Washington , Dec. 8. — Former
Lnited States Senator Arthur Brown,
of Utah, tonight lies In a critical con*
dition in the Emergency hospital with
a pistol shot wound in the abdomen
inflicted by Mrs. Anna M. Bradley,
of Salt Lake, who arrived here today
from that city. The shooting occurred
in Senator Brown's apartment ln the
Raleigh hotel, where Mrs. Bradley
also had registered under the name of
"A. B. Brown." She was arrested.
According to her statement tonight
at the police station, where she talked
freely with the newspaper men, Mrs.
Bradley came to Washington to de*
mand that Senator Brown marry her.
She said that their relations were well
known in Salt Lake.
Congressmen Must Pay Fare
Washington , Dec. 8.— The new
railroad rate law is affecting the poli
ticians as much as any other class of
"shippers." In the past, members of
congress have either been able to
secure free transportation to and from
Washington or half rates at least.
They wore also able to secure half
rates for their clerks. But it is differ
ent now. Most of the congressmen
are paying full fare and all of their
clerks are. Since the new order of
things has become effective many
clerks who come here simply for the
session of congress and return home
during the vacation period, threaten
to quit the game on March 4 and en
gage in other pursuits. They were
not able to save much money out of
their jobs and the ear fare, especially
from western states, now eats up
everything.
TYauk privileges have also been cur
tailed. The express companies called
iu their franks some time ago. A
western senator, who had been out of
reach since then, didn't know of the
matter and he boxed up a lot of stuff
and sent it to Washington, under his
frank. When his truck reached here
it cost him $59 for express charges.
Another western senator ordered his
clerks to send their two typewriting
machines back for the session. They
took them to the express company but
found that the franks were no good.
"There are more ways than one of
skinuing a cat," said one of the
clerks. Whereupon he pasted a postal
frank on eaeh machine and sent it
through the mails. The postofiice de
partment at this end of the line
wouldn't stand for it, and the senator
was required to pay $i>0 postage on his
two typewriters.
