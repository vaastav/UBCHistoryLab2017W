DILLS HELAT1XO TO TRVS1S.
Itepreientative Llttlt-fldd of Maine,
one of the bet constitutional lawyers In
conjfresg and an earnest advocate of
trmt regulation, ha lutrryiuced In the
houso of representatives two bills relat
ing to trusts. One of thews measures
pmriden for publicity, reiulrln; all cor
porations engaged lu Interstate com
rnerc to file returns with the secretary
of the treasnry declarlnf? their true
llnanclal condition and capital Mock and
Imposes a tax upon such ax have out
standing capital u.k unpaid In whole
or In part. The meanure sjeclfles the
fact that shall be annually returned by
the corporations to which It applies. In
cluding organization and constituent
companies authorized capital stock with
the amount Issued, outstanding and paid
in, total Indebtedness and nature of
Fame, with purpose for which It was
Incurred, aw.-ts and liabilities, totai
earnings and Income, operating ex
penses, salaries of ofilrial and wages of
employes. This appears to be mitilciently
comprehensive to meet the recommenda
tion of President Itoosevelt that the
public should bo given full knowledge of
the condition of the great Industrial cor
porations. Whoever swearu to a return
falsely la to be deemed guilty of per
jury and" punished according to the fed
eral Iuwh governing that offense.
The other bill proposes amendments to
the Sherman anti-trust law along the
samo general lines ax those adopted by the
houso of representatives last winter, but
they go notnewhat farther. The most
Important of them provides tiiat no per
son shall be excused from attending or
testifying In proceediugs-agalnst u trust
or monojwly, or from producing In court
books, pain.-, contracts, agreements and
documents, on the ground that bucIi ae-
tlou might Incriminate him. Any person
who furnishes evidence of this kind Is
made exempt from prosecution. It is a
juestion, of course, whether legislation
of tills kind would be sustained by tiie
courts, but it uppears to bo obviously
necessary If the iintl-trust law Is to be
made fully effective. Another proposed
amendment provides that any civil or
criminal proceeding authorized under
he act may be begun by any person,
firm or corjwration in the name of and
lu behalf of the United State.
This proposed legislation Is In general
ccord with the suggestions of the presl
ent, who said In his message: "It Is no
limitation upon property rights or free
dom of contract to require that when
men receive from government the privi
lege of doing business under corporate
form, which frees them from Individual
resiMjnslblllty, and enables them to call
Into their enterprises the capital of the
public, they shall do so upon absolutely
truthful representations as to the value
of the property In which the capital Is
to be Invested. Corporations enguged lu
Interstate commerce should be regulated
if they are found to exercise a license
working to the public Injury. Great
corporations exist only because they are
created and safeguarded by our Institu
tions and It is therefore our right and
our duty to see that they work lu har
mony with these Institutions."

What Is spoken of as perhaps tho
greatest parliamentary struggle that
Germany has ever faced was Inaugu
rated In the Itclchstag last Monday,
when the Imperial chancellor opened the
debate on the new tariff bill. No coun
try has a greater Interest In the result
of this struggle thnn tho United Slates,
since If the proposed measure becomes
law our agricultural products will suffer
from it more than those of any other
country. It Is distinctively designed to
protect tho agricultural Interests of Ger
many, for which purpose It provides for
a general advance on foodstuffs of from
50 to .'100 per cent. Such an Increase
In duties must Inevitably have a very
serious effect upon our trade with Ger
many lu foodstuffs, for although the
secretary of the Imperial treasury said
that In spite of higher duties on cereals
the government honed to come to an
understanding with the United States,
It Is not easy to see what sort of under
standing could bo reached that would
be of any advantage to our trade and
at the same time give German agri
culture the protection the agrarians de-
maud.
There Is a very strong opposition to
tho bill, which Is said U be more power
ful outside than Inside the German Par
liament, but It appears Improbable that
It can compass the defeat of the meas
ure, notwithstanding the fact that ex
isting Industrial conditions In Germany
are most unfavorable to legislation that
will raise the cost of food. One llcrlln
paper declares: that the proposed tariff
will drive n largo proportion of tho
working classes back to a diet of black
bread and potatoes.
A HAUUIKH TO TIlAnn.
Senntor Depew, lu his address nt tho
opening of the Charleston exposition,
said that our lalltlrc to cunturo or hold
trudo with the countries to the south of
us Is due to the fact that we have aban
loiied tho sea. He declared that until
ships under the American flag are carry
lug American merchandise and estub
llshlng routes and ports and bunking fa
cilities for American commerce, we can
not possess and enjoy our Inheritance
that Is, the southern trade which
should bo ours. Tho Now York senator
expressed tin.' opinion tliat when tho
Isthmian canal lu built and opened by
the United States our poverty on tho,
ocean will make It the opportunity of
our .rivals. That, however, will be at
least ten years hence and perhaps a con
siderably longer time, and In tho mean
time It Is to be expected that we shall
Improve our position on thu ocean.
There Is no doubt as to tho correct
ness of Senator Uepow's view that tho
lack of American ships under our own
llag In the oceau-carrylug trade Is
largely responsible for our failure to
obtuln more of (ho trade of tho countries
of South and, Central America. That
was pointed out years ago by representa
tives of those countries who attended
the first pau-Amerlcau conference and
some of thu delegates to tho conference
now In session In tho City of Mexico
hnvo referred to tho fact lu explanation
of our slow progress lu gululug trudo lu
the southern countries. It ought to be
apparent to any one who will give in
telligent attention to tho matter that in
order to get our proper share of the
commerce of the 63.0OJ.000 people In the
Spanish-American republics we must
bare closer relations with them, particu
larly In the matter of communication.
No sentimental considerations will bring
us this trade. It can be had only
through the application of business principles.

The decision rendered by the supreme
court In the Itedell case Is one of the
anomalies of Nebraska Jurisprudence
that would puzzle and perplex a Phila
delphia lawyer. The only Issue made In
the Itedell cao was as to whether the
police board appointed by the mayor and
council could remove an officer filling a
position created by the charter.
The district court, through Judge Es
telle, had held that the Iward of police
commissioners had no right to try and
remove the chief of the Are department,
because the charter provided other meth
ods of removing charter o'fllcerg. In
other words, Judge Kstelle held that the
mayor and council ulone had authority
to depose Itedell or appoint his succes
sor and that power could not be dele
gated to the police board.
The supreme court has reversed Judge
Estello's decision, holding that the ex
isting police (ward has the right to ap
point, discipline and remove all officers
of the fire and police departments. Inci
dentally the supreme court has gone out
of Its way to express the opinion that
the charter provision that authorizes the
appointment of members of the tire and
jwllce commission by the governor Is
not unconstitutional. In taking this po
sition the majority of the court declares
that Its former decision on this question
was erroneous and Is therefore reversed.
Willie the supreme court doubtless has
the right to change its mind concerning
any principle or construction of the law.
the right of the court to reopen nny
case on which a final decision has been
rendered and rehearing denied by any
Isjsslble substitution of parties to the
suit cannot be exercised without revolu
tionizing the whole system of Judicial
government. Curried to Its natural se
quence, no Judgment rendered by a court
of lust resort could ever be considered
final. The death, resignation or removal
of a single Judge might reopen the most
vital decisions, destroy vested rights lu
property and Jeopardize the stability of
government. There certainly could be
no stability of our Institutions if they
were subject to change with every
change in the personnel of supreme
courts.
This was the position taken by Tho
Hoe at the time Governor Poynter under
took to appoint n lire and ollce com
mission for Omaha In spite of the final
Judgment rendered by the supreme court
establishing the tight of the mayor and
council to appoint the board and ntllrm
lug the titles of the present commission
ers. While the supreme court consid
ered the discussion of the case sought to
be brought by the late attorney general
as an attempt to Influence Its final ac
tion and Imposed a Hue upon this paper
for alleged contempt, It nevertheless re
allirmed Its former decision and upheld
the position of The Uee that to reoien
the case and set aside the original Judg
ment would be Judicial anarchy.
The view expressed lu tho Itedell case
relating to the validity of the charter
provisions granting the appointing pow
ers to the governor must, therefore, bo
considered In the light of the former
ruling of the court and not necessarily
as affecting the rights of the present
commission to continue In ofllce.
According to the World-Herald "tho
acknowledged lender of the moro repu
table element of republicans lu Douglas
county" was closeted for three hours
with Governor Snvuge a week ago to Im
press upon his excellency the udvantngo
that would accrue to the party and tho
state by the selection of a -new pollco
board from the so-called "moro reputa
ble" faction of tho party, as distinguished
from the less reputable faction. It Is a
most significant commentary upon tho
brand of republicans that love to style
themselves "reputable" that Its leaders
have been actively Identified within thu
past twenty years with crooked statu
house ol!lc!als, treasury embezzlers and
parly wreckers who made It a four years'
tusk for honest republicans to redeem
Nebraska and bring It back Into tho re
publican column. It Is also very signifi
cant that this self-styled "reputublo"
faction of the republican party always
finds a champlou lu tho dcmo-iiopullst
organ that has stood lu with recreant
republican olllclals whom the party has
been compelled to repudiate.
Tho Missouri supremo court has Just

A year ago the Texas authorities suc

represented tho Standard Oil company. It
has now defeated a brewers' combine. Thcso
are Indeed victories. No other stato can
show such a record. This Is not so much
that Texas has a rigid anti-trust law as It
Is because state officials think It can bo
and ought to bo enforced. Hut whllo these
two browing companies cannot do business
In Texas, tho Texans who Ilko their beer
can send to St. Louis or Milwaukee for It.
Its shipment to them cannot bo prevented.
Nor Is it likely that beer will be any
chcapor In Texas because of tho expulsion
of those two companies. In this enso it
will be difficult to see what Texas will have
gained by this "famous victory." Somo
foreign capital which has been Invested In
tho stato will bo withdrawn, but there will
be no gain. Texas needs all tho capital it
can get.

IIIIUGATIOX SEXTIME.Vr.
Eattrrn Cnn-rfiiram Vnriericn a
Change- for the Hetter.
A marked feature of the trend of public
sentiment observed at the opening of con
gress Is the change of front of eastern
representatives on the subject of reclaiming
the arid lands of the west. During the
closing days of the preceding congress
eastern representatives were united In
opposition to all Irrigation plans carrying
appropriations. Now they are ready to hear
argument and to assist In perfecting a
measure that will best conserve the Inter
ests of the nation In the west. The Wash
ington correspondent of the New York
Evening Post reflects the prevailing senti
ment and discusses the subject as follows;
"Today a feeling is creeping over former
opponents of this project that It is one of
those Inevitable things which It is useless
to resist, and that perhaps the best coun
sel for thoughtful representatives of the
sections not directly Interested Is to try to
control Irrigation expenditures, keeping
them in the right direction and along hon
est and Intelligent lines, rather than to
oppose them altogether. This view Is
cropping out very widely In personal con
versations, and will doubtless make Itself
felt In legislative action.
"Few subject have ever summoned the
attention of the American people In which
there was so distinctly a right way and a
wrong way, an honest policy and what
would probably be a dishonest one. as In
the alternatives offered over irrigation. For
years the battle has been raging In the
west, in the country to be affected by the
development of Irrigation, and the cast ha
assumed that In the quarrel it had no part
This view, too, Is changing and many
eastern members now feel that they can
afford to have some share in the Irrigation
project In order to participate In the de
cision as to tte methods, and so Join the
better element of the west In Its warfare
against the lower. One phase of the con
test Is that between state control of Irri
gation and national control. For many
years an effort has been making to bring
about the ceeslon of the public lands by the
national government to the states, but this
has raised such an earnest protest on the
part of those who have realized how un
fitted the Rocky mountain legislatures were
for dealing with large property Interests
that tho old demand has been obliged to
assume a new and disguised form. What
tho polltlco-epeculatlve Interests now want
fe a "stato engineer system," by which tho
federal government, while nominally con
trolling Irrigation for which It would pay,
In reality would bo turning tho actual man
agement upon which local land values de
pend, over to the stato politicians.
"In the arid west, to control the water Is
to control the land, and hence room Is
afforded for unlimited scandal If the ex
penditure of government money be turned
over to what is called tho state engineers.
Thero Is no use mincing words. Tho Rocky
mountain legislatures aro not honest
enough to handle such matters; the nause
ating revelations concerning the Montana
legislature aro fresh in the public mind,
and yet In spite of them and the finding:
of the eenato committeo, that state has
promptly re-elected W. A. Clark to the
senate. The Arizona territorial legislature
Is said to be more reasonable In its terms
than that in Montana; a gentleman In this
city who Is familiar with the local situa
tion, asserts that he has been told In Ari
zona that a majority vote could be pro
cured for any measure for an expenditure
of 14,000. Other tales abound of the low
standard of public morality In these newer
states, and so far as Montana Ib concerned
they aro of very open and notorious record.
It le evident that it will not do to turn the
irrigation project over to these states In
any form.
"The United States Geological survey Is
tho body which ought to do this work; it
is a scientific, non-partisan body, adminis
tered on strict civil service reform princi
ples, and it would bo ablo to employ such
outside talent In tbo way of skilled en
gineers as occasion may warrant. Were
tho Irrigation plans to bo carried out by
tho survey It Ib safe to say that very little
money will bo wasted. If It be dono by pre
tentious commissions, mado up of defeated
and discredited politicians, with a lot of
high salaried retainers, or If Irrigation
money bo turned over to tho states, tho
very word will come to be synonymous of
wastefulness and scandal. Between such

'The moro conservative lrrlgatlonlsts
maintain that $3,000,000 a year with tho ac
cumulations from the profits of Irrigation,
cither assessed on the beneficiaries or col
lected as rents, would be sufficient to set
tbo enterprise Into motion. This is about
the sum for tho first year which the specific
proJectB recommended by Secrotary Hitch
cock call for. This would accord with tho
recommendations of tho president's mes
sage and with tho announced policy of the
republican party. When It la considered
how small a part the expenses of our army
or of tho navy, $3,000,000 a year, with the
accumulation thereon would be, many peo
ple think that tho demand of the arid west
should no longer bo disregarded. In time,
an this bnelB, lrrlgatlonlsts maintain that
they could reclaim 100,000,000 acres of the
public domain, or about one-sixth of the
arid region.
"There wns an Irrigation attachment to
flvo bills in tho last congress, and Senator
Carter's death-dealing speech agalnBt tho
river Und harbor bill was ostensibly
charged to its disregard of Irrigation. Its

a membership, particularly among makers
of agricultural Implements and other arti

It looks as If the Irrigation project was
about ready for tho enacting clause If so
It Is to be hoped that this will be done
In a distinct bill and not ob n ridor to the
river und harbor appropriations; In tho
latter case the sums would i be liable to
partake of the "glvo and takV system of
tho rest of tho bill, which would bo dis
astrous to any far-reaching scientific plans."

then were may be open to question. But It
seems plain that the grt-at majority of
them favor the change, and It is impossible
to doubt that it will be found to be to their
practical advantage.
The incident will be of some little Interest
as a precedent, or rather as a corrobora
tion of the principle which was enunciated
tn the cose of Cuba long ago before the
memory of the present generation namely,
that while islands thus lying off our coast
might without the least offense to us remain
in European possession forever, they were
not to be regarded a object of barter
and sale among European powers, but when
disposed of by their present owners should
become Independent states or else pass
under our own control. There Is no reason
to suppose that any power Is inclined to
challenge the propriety of that principle.
The United States has' no desire to oust Its
European friends from their West India
holdings. It Is not soliciting the sale of
their possessions. And there is no Indica
tion that any of them want to sell out.
nut If In the future any of them should de
sire to get rid of such possessions the
precedent now set by Denmark will doubt
less commend itself to their friendly con
sideration. COMMK.NT OX Till MESSAGE.
St. Louts Globe-Democrat (rep.): The
message is comprehensive, vigorous,
pointed and eminently satisfactory. It Is
the expression of a sane, public-spirited and
vlrilo American.
St. Louie Republic (dem.): Its tone Indi
cates that Mr. Roosevelt has already come
under tho restraining Influence of the party
leaders and is largely surrendering himself
to their views.
Hoston "Globe (dem.'): Vigorous Is a good
word to apply to the message. No one will
deny that President Roosevelt makes a
strong argument In favor of national irri
gation In the arid regions of the west.
Chicago Tribune (rep.): President Roose
velt's message is like tho man practical,
buslnets-llke, straightforward, earnest and
strenuous. Though a literary man as well
as statesman, there Is no attempt at fine
writing In It.
Chicago Inter-Ocean (rep.): The message
is like Roosevelt. It Is thoughtful, vigorous,
well written and markedly Individual. It
has the charm of his personality, tho
strength of his character, the falr-minded-nees
of a trained intelligence.
Philadelphia Ledger (Ind.): It Is a formi
dable state document, but It Is readable
throughout. The messago Is thoroughly
American. It departs altogether from the
stereotyped form and one looks in vain for
the ordinary arrangement of topics. Every
American ought to read it.
Minneapolis Journal (rep.): It Is the
message of a man so intent upon the affairs
which tradition compels him to discuss In a
formal manner, that he has little time to
consider the literary form of the state
ment. To put It In homely fashion: He
says what ho has to say and quits.
New York Post (Ind.): Except in a few
features President Roosevelt's messago is
lacking In definite recommendations, but
those few are of flrBt-rato importance. As
Instances of vagueness In the message we
may mention the paragraph which relates
to reciprocity and tho ono In reference to
ship subsidies.
Chicago Nows (Ind.): President Roose
velt's messago to congress will strengthen
tho public confidence In him as a man of
broad outlook, high purposo and common
senso. Ilia languago Is notably clear and
direct. It has tho accont of personal con
viction, but it Is everywhoro temperute
and restrained.
Minneapolis Times (Ind.): As to the re
coptton of tho messago with the people
thero need bo no doubt. It will not suit
the billionaire, nor tho radical popullBt. It
will please, unrcsorvedly, almost, that vast
majority of citizens who occupy the planeo
between thoso of the mighty rich and the
discontented ngltator.
Kansas City Star (Ind.): No document
over put forth by a chief oxccutlve of the
United States has been more thoroughly
balanced or conservative. Tho president In
Blsta upon tho most absolute efficiency In
tho conduct of public affairs and tho firm
repudiation of everything In tho shapo of
doubtful policies as expedients to tho end
of partisan success.
Indianapolis Journal (rep.): Tho Ameri
can citizen who cannot feel pride, oven
exultation, In the utterances of tho presi
dent must olther bo a very dull man or
lacking In that patriotism that is the foun
dation stone of nil good and lasting gov
ernment. It will be read with keenest In
terest and approval by millions of Ameri
cans, and la certain to attract much atten
tion abroad.
Now York Tribune (rep.)i If there are
persons who havo been sympathetically
awaiting an Impassioned denunciation of
trusts addressed to a low order of Intelli
gence and mischevlous propensities, they
will bo greatly disappointed In tho presi
dent's uttcrancos on that subject. He dis
cusses It In a thoroughly temperate man
nor, with clear discernment of the natural
causes which have mado combination the
most conspicuous featuro of modern Indus
trial development.
Chicago Chronlclo (dem.): It wo were to
select the beat Bcntenccs In tho ruessnge
they would be thoso In answer to the In
tolerable popullstlo cry that tbo country
and the pcoplo aro worso olf now than thoy
over woro before. "It Is not true," ho
say's, "that as tho rich havo grown rlchor
tho poor havo grown pooror. On tho con
trary, never boforo has tho avorage man,
the wageworkcr, tho farmer, tho small
trader been so well off as In this country
and at tho present time." It Ib an answer
to the calamltyltes which Is truthful and
conclusive.
