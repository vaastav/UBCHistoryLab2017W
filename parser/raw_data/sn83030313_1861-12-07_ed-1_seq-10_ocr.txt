Sterling having been freely taken at 126 a 120. We are

MESSAGE OF GOVERNOR LETCHER OF VIR
GINIA.
The Norfolk Day Book of the 6th Instant publishes In
part the Message of Governor Letcher to the Legislature
?f Virginia. The document Is a very lengthy one, and, as
the journal above mentioned is very limited In its space,
R is unable to publish it entire, and gives the first half as
follows:?
Exsetmvs Pepaetment, Dec. 9,1861.
Gsvtiemen or the Senate and House or Deucoatks?
Since tho adjournment of the General Assembly, on
the' 4th day of April last, Virginia has withdrawn from
the federal Union, and has resumed her sovereignty as
an independent State. The reasons which Impelled her
to the adoption of this course are numerous, and arc
aaarto to lustify her action. It is sufficient to state that
the government which our forefathers established was a
government of froodom and of equality ? that it has been
subverted, and its alms and objects defeated. Freewill
sad the consent of the governed were tho great princi
ples lying at its foundation. They never entertained the
idea that one section of the country was to be h -Id by
subjugation under the dominion of the other. Their own
history has shown that they had freed themselves from
unwise and unjust legislation, from coercion and subju
gation by their revolutionary struggle ? the noblest und
most glorious in its results that has adorned the annals of
history. They founded a government for tho protection
Of all which commended itself to popular approval, and
around which the affections of tho i*oplo wero closely
?ntwined, giving to it strength, power and influenoo. In
the pure days of Its existence It enjoyed tlio confidence of
the people and commanded the respect of tho nations of
the earth. So long as it gave protection all were into
restod in maintaining and perpetuating its existence, but
when it ceRsed to afTord protection, and the attempt was
Bade to coerce and subjugate States, tho government of
our forefathers was overthrown.
We arc In no sense responsible for the present condition
?f the public affairs. The Northern masses, madden d
by passion and inflamed by prejudice, have pushed tfave
aggressions upon us until evory consideration of duty and
patriotism requires us to separate from them. We do.
Sired to separate in peace. We wanted no war, but yet
we had made upour minds to vindicate our conduct on
the battle Held, if need be, and trust to that God who di
rects the destinies of men and nations, toguidous into
the puthway to success and independence, go far, he has
watched over us, guarded and protected ub in our right
eous resistance to tyranny; has presided In tho councils
Of our bravo generals; has stimulated our officers and
men to deeds of noblo daring, and has crowned our efforts
with the wreath of victory.
It would be an Idle consumption of time to present all
the reasons which influenced our actions In this commu
nication. They arefamlltar to the public mind, and un
der their iniluenco the people of Virginia havo pronounced
their judgment at the polls, and by a majority un parallel
od have declared for separation. The events that havo
transpired sinco the I7th day of April fully attest the
Sincerity of their convictions. I am content to leave
their vindication with posterity , assured that their aetion
will be fully Justified.
The purpose of the federal President to subjugate ua
and coerce us to remain in a Union the great aims and
Objects of which have failed, has involved us in a war of
resistance to defeat his unholy designs. We have met
his movements with a firmness, resolution and courage
that become freemen ia the maintenance of their honor,
their rights and their institutions. We have defeated his
beet troops aud driven them in oonfuskm and dismay
from his own selected battle fiolds. Bethel and Haynes
?ille, Uull'run and Manassas, Rich Mountain and Gauloy,
Harper's Ferry and Leeeburg, all attest the spirit, the
heroism . the patriotism and courage of the volunteers of
the Southern confederacy. They have proved themseivos
equal to any emergency, and have demonstrated that
they are worthy sons of illustrious ancestors, who struck
the first blow for freedom io the Western world.
It is not with us to determine whether this war shall
be of long or short duration. We have decided, bow
over, that it cannot terminate until our enemies shall re
cognise fully and unconditionally the independence of the
Southern confederacy. Whatever of meu or money is
needed to work out this result will be cheerfully furnish
od. There can be and there will be u? compromise.
We can never again live in harmony and peace umlrr lh'
tame government. We can never entertain friendly frAiruit
far a people who have rutidessly shed Southern Uood upon
Southern toil in so execrable a war. They have shown
themselves our worst enemies, and such we hold them to
be. Tho separation that has taken place has been signal
lied in blood, and it ought to be, and I trust will be, a
permanent separation. Recont truction is not desirabU,
and even if it were, it is now an impouxLildy.
It la our duty, therefore, to devote all our energies to a
vigorous prosecution of tho war. Everything mum be
done that vigllaoce and fidelity require, aud nothing left
undone that patriotism and prudence suggest m necessary
for our protection against actual aud contemplated aggres
sions aud encroachments upon our rights. No hesitating or
doubtful policy will answer when armies are in the field.
Nor will it do to act alone on the defensive. The Susque
Kannah is a better fighting line for us than the Potomac, and
the sooner the war is pushed forward to that line Ihr. better fur
Virginia and the Southern confederal y. To thit line it
must go ir we would savo Maryland. I Ait our actions
show to her poodle that we feel for their condition, aud
that we intend to aid them in effecting their deliverance
from the tyranny that now oppresses them, and thou
aamlR will welcome us to their 8t ite and flock to tlie
standard ot the Southern confedeiacy, with a resolution
to plant that flag firmly upon her soil, or die in the at
tempt. This war will not end until wo show tho Northern
people the difierenco between invading and being in
vaded. "
.In lb la connection I must not omit to notice the noble
Spirit and promptitude exhibited by the gallant sons of
that State in coining forward Immediately after our ordi
nance of secession was passed, aud making tenders of
service to aid in the struggle which was then seen to bo
unavoidable A more gallant set of men never graced a
battle Held, and soldiers more true, more courageous and
more faithful never struck blows for freedom aud inde
pendence. Wh' ti their State was subjugated tboy left
their homes, families and friends, came to Virginia eu
tsred her service, and have exhibited a devotion aud
fidelity to the cause worthy of all admiration.
Very shortly after the secession of Virginia, In the full
bsllef that Governor Hicks, of Maryland, would be dis
posed to units with me m tho adoption of some line of
policy that would be calculated to give mutual protection
to our respective States against the encroachments of the
Lincoln government, I sent Judge William W. Crump of
this city, one of my aids-de camp, a gentleman of fine
Intelligence and good prudence, to confer with him, and
ascertain what would be his course of action in the tben
existing condition of public affairs. On calling upon Gov.
Hicks Judge Crump very soon became satisfied that the
Governor intended to go with the North, and would use
bis influence, personal and official, to prevent Maryland
from connecting herself with ber Southern sisters. The
confereaue, therefore, soon termiftatsdi Judge Crump's
report Is herewith traevnitted.

teries arc injured, and among the buildings destroyed aro
the St. John's and the Catholic churches. The houses
occupied by the officers aro only slightly damaged. As
to tho injury done tho enemy, any report made is all
speculation , and no reliable or truilifiil statements have
come from there yet. All our batteries have been worked
witii great crodii to thoso in ch iri;o ol them. On yester
day tncro were thirteen of Abe's vessels im sight, hut
from their tardiness In commencing the light this morn
ing wc aro led to believe that "Somebody is hnrt." A
gent Ionian just from Warrington conlkms tho report that
tho flrmg of the enemy is very bad and of very llttlo
effect. He says lie counted over twenty shells lying th?ru
on a street, none of them having exploited.
Tho correspondent of the Columbus (Ga.) Sun says:?
General Bragg says he cannot make cut what old lirown
is after. He has been tiring for eighteen hours cc.ns< en
tirely, and has done us no injury. Not a soul was hurt
yesterday, and no damage was done to our works. Gen.
Bragg thinks Brown's Unrig yesterday was ridiculous.
One-half of their shells would not explode, and tho Navy
Yard Is piled with them. You can wa it over them they
are so thick. Wo cannot ascertain what damage wo have
done. Our aim was deliberate and our Ore slow. Every
gun did execution, and our shells hurst always just over
Fort Pickens. Our boys would fire a liig gun and tl>on
jump on it and give cheers. They are perfectly delighted
at the fun. The force engaged has been McCrac's, and
Wheat's and another battery, all from Louisiana and Mis
sissippi. Ibe enemy attempted a landing nt i'erdide
river on Sunday night, but were mo. t signally repulsed
by our gallant troops there. A negro wagon driver w.s.u
M?Hao tiki* morn in# when the flruig commenced, and said
he would drive hla teaoi to headquarter* If Pickens killed
j i in and every mulo be had. A shot levied one of his
mules, tie cut it looaa and drove the remainder safely
through. Geti. Bragg suy* ho intends to montion him iu
his reiort to the government.
Another corroHpondeut writes: ? The bombardment was
kept up nearly all last night, ami, from all the informa
tion I oan gather, with very little damage to our side. It
is said that there are three breaches In Pickens, and the
Niagara attempted to run in yesterday, bat received a
heavy shot in her bow, and turned round, when she was
raked In the stern, and it is supposed she is disabled. Tbn
general Impression is that Bragg Is fighting slowly, but
safely and surely ? not wasting a shot, and holding batte
ries iu reserve that they know nothing of.
[From the Richmond Despatch, Deo. 2.1
Caibo, Nov. 80, 1801.
General Polk yesterday received a d'-spateh from Gene
ral Bragg, at Pensacola, stating that Tlckens had ceased
tiring, and the result so fur has been eight robelsfkillcd
and several bouses destroyed. No breach bad beeu made,
as reported, in the walls of the fort. The United IStutu*
fleet, he said, had been injured. Bragg slated that he
hourly expected a renewal of tho tiring.
[From the Charleston Courier, Nov. 29.1
PSNtUCOLA, Nov. 23 ? 8 A. II.
Both parties are silent this morning. 1 walked down
to the beach this morning and looked at Pickens. She
seems considerably battered. A long dark place upon her
side, which tho men say is shot marks, was plainly visi
ble. Poor Fort Mcltae sullered yesterday far mora than
we thought. Six men were killed by the falling of the
cover of a rest, and ten others wounded. They say five
hundred shot and shell fell into the fort. The damage
was done by the ships, which took position southwest of
tho fort, where the guns could not be very effective, and
fired broadside after broadside upon her. A battery lo
cated Just back of her aided in repelling the attack, and,
it is said, struck them 16 times. Only two ships are off
the harbor this morning. 1 foar noither party will renew
the fight this morning. If they do McRaa will probably
be abandoned during the day , and the battery behind her
worked. But if sho was levelled to the sand, nothing
would bo accomplished towards tbe reduction of our bat
teries. We have never counted her aa anything la the
light.
REPORTED EVACUATION OP TYBEE ISLAND
BY THE FEDERAL TROOPS.
[From the Norfolk Day Book, Dec. 6.]
Savannah, Dec. 4, 1801.
Tho News of to-day says that the federals have entirely
evacuated Tv boo Island. Captain Read visited the Island
on Saturday and saw nothing; no works.
[From the Norfolk Day Book, Dec. 8.]
Savannah, Dec. 2, 1881.
The XepuNican of this morning says that the federals
have evacuated Tybeo Island. One ship load left on Sat
urday for the northward.
On Saturday*afternoon a large ship stood In for Warsaw
Inlet. Coramodoro Tatnall's fleet went after her, but she
disappeared. There were six federal vessels offTybeo
Island yestorday.
The schooner Waterman , Ruronn, for Charleston, waa
wrocked off Tybee on Friday morning. She fell into the
hands of tho blockadersoff Charleston.
The cotton and provisions on Hutchenson, Fenwick and
adjoining islands, wero destroyed by fire on Thursday

REBEL ACCOUNTS OF THE TYBEE ISLAND
AFFAIR.
[From the Savannah News, Nov. 28.]
Captain Clrcopely, who came up yesterday, reports six
federal vessels still Inside the bar. Five moro vessels,
supiiosed to be transports, arrived yesterday noon, and
can be seen outside the bar ? making eloven vessels in all
now In sight of Fort Pulaski. From their movements it
was thought the vessels outside would come in over the
bar last evening. The vessels Inside lie at anchor about
four miles from the fort, and out of the reach of our
guns. One, a large frigate, can be seen from the Ex
change and tho balconies of the stores on the bluff. Be
tween ten and eleven o'clock yesterday morning a party
of Yankee troops , armed with muskets, wero observed
from tho fort advancing along tho beach towards King's
landing. Two or three round shot and a shell were
fired at them from the fort. Wheu the first shell
was fired the Yankees prostrated themselves on tho
ground; after the second shell burst over them they
arose and fled to the oovor of the woods. They
afterwards appeared on the beach, out of reach of tho
guns of the fort. It is not known whether any of them
were hit by our shot and shell, but those who saw the
bursting of the sliells, which made the sand fly In their
immediate vicinity, are under the impression that they
woru not entirely harmless. It Is said the Yankees made
Bull run speed to the woods. Up to five o'clock yester
day afternoon there were eight vessels lying iu the roads,
tho frigato Macedonian, several gunboats, and tho rest
transports. They were all escorted in by one gunboat,
which is said to be armed most heavily.
[From the Savannah Republican, Nov. 28.]
Fort Pclamu, Nov. 25, 1881.
I suppose you havo hoard of aflhlrs down here before
this. The enemy appeared around Tybee point about
eleven o'clock A. H. yesterday. The sentinel reported
them, and the assembly wax heat; we were ordered to
the guns; thero we awaited them. The enemy, composed
of a frigate and one gunboat, rounded the point and com
menced throwing shot and shells on T>boo. Not having
received a reply, thoy despatched the gunboat for
moro vessels. About four o'clock the gunboat came back
with two more very large vessels; soon after a long train
of small boats was seen to leave the vessels and hoad for
the sh >re. About six o'clock the federal flag was seen fly
ing on Ty boe Island. About seven o'clock at night Captain
Read, of the Irish Volunteers, took a squad of his men
and went over to the island . and got in sight of tho Yan
kees. He could see them all around tho fire; but finding
that ho cmild not effect his object, which was to burn the
large hospital, thero being too many men around the
house, he reUimed and burnt all the houses on his way,
Inoludlng Captain King's large house, also the platform
where the boat lands. They also brought off an aid
negro, the property of Mr. King, which tbe picket had
left. He Is now at the fort. This morning tho federal flag
could be seen flying on the lighthouse. Ihere are three
largo vessels off tbe point now, and another gunboat has
Just arrivod. The Island is naturally protected by large
sand hills, which could have protected our men from th<j
s!iolls of the enemy. I think a thousand men could whip
them off the Island in two hours. Tho enemy have a
foothold on all tho Southern States bordering on the
Atlantic, but I think they have gained very little by
taking Tybeo Wand. I do not think they can get onough
rice and cottou on Tybee to pay the cost of the expe
dition, as they say they did at Port Royal. We have
plenty of ammunition and men , and we dofy them to
come In range of our guns ? we will show them the differ
ence between taking Port Royal and Fort Pulaski.
Port Pl-lami, Nov. 26.
Nothing from the enemy. We can see them constantly
communicating with the shore by small boats. Thero
are two propellers and one large side wheel steamer,
which lay off the point in full sight of the fort, and a
smaller one that comes and goes constantly between
them and a squadron or three vessel* lying outside. The
United States flag is flying from tho lighthouse, and also
from a flagstaff lu the old parade ground formerly used
by our troops. Commodore Tatnall, with a portion of tbe
mosquito fleet, Is lying about tho fort, no doubt chafing
uqdor the restraint bis limited means impose.
The enemy have established their pickets all arouqjl
Tybee, as far up as King's landing. Tue general impres
sion below Is that the Yankees are concentrating thoir
forces, and that as soon as they get a few more vessels
over the bar they intend making an attack on Fort l'u
laskl. The movement*, of the enemy during the past fow
days Indicate a purpose on their part to get control of
this port.
[From the Savannah Republican, Nov. 29.]
Up te a late hour last night not a word of interest had
boenreolnved from below, at least in unofficial circles.
Tbe enemy are still on Tybee, and will, doubtless, greatly
strengthen their force and position in,tne course of a few
days. General Lee is in town, and movements are under
stood to be regulated, in great part, In acoordanoe with
his own excellent Judgment.
TBE SLIDELL AND HASON AFFAIR.
[From the Charleston Mereury, Nov. 23.1
Long before anything which may bo said on inis side
of the Atlantic on the seizure of our commissioners on tbe
high seas, from the British packet, shall reach England,
the British government will have taken its positiou as to
the rights it involves. If the cottou famine shall have
loomed up with those terrific proportions', which will in
evitably bo developed by time, the British government
will find, in tbe laws of nations, quite sufficient ground
for a very impressive demand for reparation frotA the
government of the United Statos. If, on the contrary,
the sufferers, prospective and immediate, of a deficiency
of ootton, shall have been stupidly indifferent to their
fate, and iqoet destitution and starvation with a passive
resignation, the government of Great Britain may treat the
teimre of our commissioners at only an indelicate affair, re
quiring no item demand/or reparation. A gentle complaint,
eliciting a polite disclaimer qf any intention tooffena, will
clou the matter. Which course Great Britain will
pursue, It is difficult to anticipate. That she has ac
quiesced in a blockade, cloarly illegal, according to tho
declarations of her Ministers in Parliament, is beyond
dispute. How much further she will be prepared to ac
quiesce in the insolent illegalities of tbe United States,
will be shown by time; but we are satisfied that one re
sult will take place from the seizure of our comtrMssiouers
tyom the deck of a British packet ? an imm<nse im
jndte will be given to the cause of the Confederate States
in Great Britain. Let tho British government construe
the laws of nations as It pleases with respect to this act,
the people of England will feci that it is a moral out
rage ? a national Insult and indignity. A man may
have a guest in his house, who may be amenable
to some government inquisition, yet if he is seized
at Ills table, before his family, and forcibly carriod
from his house, he must be Indignant. His sympa
thies will be with his guest. Our commissioners were
under tho British flsg. Their errand was an errand of
peace aud good will towards the people of Eugland. They
were the bearers of probably the most magnificent offers
of friendly and lucrative intercourse whn.h have over
parsed from another peopk) to the people of England.
Passing fr< tn one neutral port to another neutral port, In
n British packet, the packet is made to come to, under
the guns of a United States frigate, the packet is
searched , and tho commissioners are seized, and forci
bly carried off. Such an act every true Rriton will re
sent. With or without law, he will feel that it Is an in
sult which 110 convenient law of nations, ever varying
to suit the pretentions of the strong, ran allay or palli
ate. In its offect.in promoting the cause of tho Confede
rate States iu Europe it will bo equal to a battle gained,
ami tur Mnidiwri will do tu better service as captives
than as H mister t at the Courts to which they were ac
credited.
[From tho New Orleans Delta.]
It Is idle for our Journals to assume the vicarious
province of expressing indignation at this insult to tbe
British flag, and this outrage upon British neutrality. If
Great Britain were a weak Power, struggling against odds
to maintain her rightful position among tho community
ol' nations, wu might well l>o indignant at this blow to
her rights and her honor, and would bo called upon to
offer her our sympathy. But Great Britain is perfectly
ablo to take care of herself. She is strong enough in
a< tual power to resent this insult effectually and summa
rily it' she chooses, snd she may tlilnk she is strong
euough in prestige and character to be able to submit to
it, if temporary policy dictates such a course, without
detriment to her honor or her interests. It is time that
the. South ihould leave England and other Eurojiean Powers
to utile their own questwns with the Worth, and thall proceed
to fgkt out this war an though Europe, t? a diplomatic point
of mew, u xrt erased from IAe map of tke world.
THE REBELS OUT OF TEMPER WITH ENG
LAND BECAUSE SHE REFUSES RECOGNI
TION.
[From the New Orleans Cretcent "]
7V government if England has expressed neither sympathy
nor extended any encouragement or support , express or im
plied, to us since our declaration of indrpetnlence. On the
contrary , the weight of her Influence, when exercised at
all, liua been thrown In favor of the North. She has de
parted from ? fixed, well entubllshed rule, in one ease.
When a party in some beggarly, Ignorant South or Central
American State, of two or three hundred thousand miser
able inhabitant!), established a Je facto government, Eng
land at once recognizes it. Such lias been the invariable
cuHtom for more than oue-third of a century, llut when
millions of united, Intelligent, brave and wealthy
Southerners declare their independence with one
accord, establish a free government, and main
tain their position victoriously for months, giv
ing unmistakeable assurance of ability to do it
for all time to come, this English government, for some
cause or other, cannot, or at least, will not, do unto us as
she has frequently done unto othors, who had no claims
either to respectability, intelligence, strength or com
mercial importance.
We shall never achieve our Independence of the North
by foreign aid. Norought we to expect It. Our own strong
arms and nnquaillng hearts must accomplish that object.
We have no other Bafe, earthly reliance. Of course we
would be delighted If John Bull would take it Into his head
to make the insult offered his. flag a pretext for inflicting
condign punishment upon Lincoln's ooeau fhordee. But
John will not do anything of the sort, unless ho Is forced
to It, or soes that be can make a great deal of money by
It. Just now the cotton famine in Manchester, 4c. , is
becoming oppressive, and in a few weeks will becomo
terrible. The long manufacturing pole may stir up the
old fellow to do a good act once in ni& life. We shall see.
THE MEXICAN COTTON TRADE.
[From the Richmond Examiner, Dec. 2.]
We are informed that the Mexican cotton factors, and
agents employed by them, have been purchasing cotton
or the people of Yeias at the low prloe of nine oents per
liound. It Is ascertained that the wants of the cotton
factors of Mexico amount to about 40,000 bales, which
they must, of necessity, purchase of Texas, and which
they have been getting on their own terms In consequence
of the blockading of our ports and the want of a com
peting market for our ootton. The establishment of con
cert and a fixed minimum of prices among the planters
are uecessary to put an end to this chaffering and specu
lative trade. If such a oourso should be pursued and
carried out we would see the purchasers of ootton that
are now otlerlng the pitiful sum of eight and niue cents,
willingly paying twelve and a half cents for all good arti
cles or cotton.

THE REBELLION IN TENNESSEE.
A letter from Kentucky hi a Cincinnati paper gives
later news from Nashville.
Governor Harris had begun to draft from the Tennes
see militia, and in apprehension that he would adopt
such a course, six or eight able-bodied Unionists had left
Nashville within a week, some for East Tennessee and
some in other directions. The State Bank in Nashville
had been filled with arms wrenched from the hands of
citizens, in obedience to Harris' threatening circular.
All the firearms in the hardware stores had been seized.
The City Hotel, with its beds and bedding, had been
taken for a hospital, and several large warehouses had
been taken for the same purpose.
DESPERATE FIGHT IN WIRT COUNTY, VA.
We learn by a letter received last eveningfrom Parkers
burg, that a desperate fight took place a day or two since
in Wirt county, between Captain Simpson's company.
Eleventh Virginia regiment, and a much larger number or
Moccasin Rangers. Captain Simpson's men were in a
bouse, getting something to sat. and the house was sur
rounded by the Moccasins, who demanded a surrender.
Captain Simpson declined, and a fight ensued. Some
eight or ten of the Moccasins were killed, and they
were driven back into the woods. Among tbe num
ber killed of tbe Moocaslns Is the notorious Pat. Con
noly, who has boasted of having In his possession thirty
one scalps of Union men. The fight lasted about one
hoar.? WKetling Intelligencer, Dee. S.
