ST. PAUL. MONDAY. DECEMBER 2, 1878.
DELEGATE CANNON was visited by an inter
viewer recently and shot off a few opinions.
These were to the effect t.iat he did not ex
pect any legislation at this session hostile to
polygamy. Ho is, however, fearful that the
protest of the non-Mormon women of Utah
will have some effeot. He knows how it is
himself. "When a woman will she will, you
may depend on't."
HE New York World computes the State*
municipal and railroad debts of the whole
country at the enormous sum of $20,000,-
000,000. Estimating the average rate of in
terest at six per cent., we find that a sum
equal to the entire national debt is paid out
for interest every year and a half. A pretty
round sum, to be sure bnt then, debts are
sometimes blessings in disguise.
AFIEB a long-continued and adroit manip
ulation of the Austrian chambers, Count
Andrassy has finally succeeded in overcom
ing the opposition to his policy in occupy
ing Bosnia, and securing the adoption of his
estimates by the committee on budget. The
ohange of ministry, therefore, which has
been so long impending, will not take place,
and for a time, at least, Andrassy is monarch
of all he surveys.
THEY, were "only negro roustabouts," and
therefore were only worth a single line in the
dispatch chronicling the loss of the steam
er Cotton Valley near Donaldsonville, on the
Mississippi river. There were twelve or
fifteen of them, but a line in the newspapers
was all they were worth. It makes no dif
ference that they may have had wives and
children, who would feel their loss as keenly
aa.if they wore while akins. But that is the
way of the world.
E. SCHUHZ is determined to make a vigor
ous fight against the army officers who have,
he claims, maligned the administration of
the Indian bureau. He again comes to th
charge and demands of Gens. Sherman and
Sheridan full proofs of the charges they
have made, and alleges that they have grossly
perverted the facts in the oase. It is very
evident that the army officers will not have
such an easy job of effecting the transfer of
the Indian bureau to the war department as
they supposed they would have.
HB American newspapers are abusing our
Canadian brethren for the flunkeyism, mani
fested by the reception of the Marquis of
Lome and the Princess Louise. People who
live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
It may be within the recollection of some of
the writers that there was considerable toady
ism, and that of the most despicable sort,
when the Prince of Wales made a tour on
this side of the border a few years ago.
Mankind in general seem to lose their wits in
the presence of royalty.
IT is very evident that Mr. Linderman's
official career is about at an end. The Re
publicans have determined that he must
step down and out of the United States
mint to make room for some one more de
voted to the interepts of the party. They
hint at grave charges to be preferred against
him, but this is only an excuse for his re
moval, his real sin being that he appointed
good Democrats to positions in his gilt.
That, in the eyes of Eepublicans, is an un
pardonable sin, and the Senate, at least, does
not propose to condone it.
W E are glad to see that the. Princess
Louise has taken the advice of the GLOBE,
and gone to the rescue of her husband.
We pointed out the fact that the marquis
was likely to be overtaxed being called
upon to respond to so many addresses, and
suggested that the Princess, who is noted
lor her fine mental acquirements, ought to
take a part of the burden from his shoul
ders. She has accepted the suggestion in
good part, and on Saturday acted upon it by
responding in a very graceful manner to an
address from the ladies of the Montreal Ed
ucational society.
THERE is promise of concerted action be
tween the governments of Italy, Russia and
Germany looking towards the suppression
of the International societies, that now so
seriously threaten the governments. Act
ing together they can, no doubt, make it de
cidedly uncomfortable for these malcontents,
who will be glad to escape from out the bor
ders of the countries. Spain, too, is taking
active measures iu the same direction, and
soon there will be no spot on which the
weary International can rest his foot. It
will be a good riddance to bad rubbish.
IN a speech at Paris on Sunday, at a meet
ing attended by distinguished Frenchmen
and Americans, Senator Fourcher de Cariel
said: "Americans are our seniors in liberty
but they lack one of the most precious
boons, namely, the liberty of commerce."
The senator spoke a truth which we on this
side of the Atlantic can fully appreciate. In
a country whioh ought to command the
commerce of the world, our trade is re
stricted by reason of the high protective
tariff imposed on imports, while France and
England, with almost absolute free trade,
have substantially taken possession of the
commerce of the whole world. The most
precious of boons is truly the liberty of com
merce. 1
THE TBTJE OBJECT OF THE CONTEST.
The Republican papers endeavor to con
vey the impression that the contest for
Washburn's seat is a mere question whether
it shall be held by Washburn or Donnelly.
It is perhaps natural that this view should
be taken in that quarter, but we are sur
prised that so intelligent a Demooratio jour
nal as the Faribault Democrat should fall
into the same train.
Though Donnelly and Washburn are the
agencies used, the real contest is for a free,
honest, untrammeled ballot. The corrup
tion in this district was shameless and noto
rious. It began months before the nomina
tion and extended to the election. Republicans
and Democrats-were bought and sold like
sheep in the shambles. There is no con
cealment of this fact among Republicans.
The lowest estimate which well informed
Republicans place upon Mr. Washburn's ex
penditure is twenty-five thousand dollars,
and many Republicans declare that it ex
ceeded thirty thousand dollars. Every one
understands that there was no legitimate ex
penditure of any such sum.
In addition to absolute bribery and pur
chase, there were the most glaring frauds
perpetrated in colonizing men from Wiscon
sin, Dakota, and also from the Second Dis
trict. There were the infamous frauds
in Kittson county where 183 votes
were returned for Washburn, and two
for Donnelly, not one of which were legal.
Railroad men, half-breeds and Canadians
were voted, the election being held in a box
car on the track, and the polls moved about
at will. If it had been necessary, 500 votes
would have been, returned instead of 183.
Iu fact, there is no limit to this' unblushing
rascality and never will be until some ex
ample is made of the perpetrators.
For, at least, the second time the
nomination and election in this district
has been secured by the shameless
means we have indicated. If this is al
lowed to continue unrebuked, it will
always be done, and it will be the utmost
farce for the Democrats to attempt a cam
paign for any one. They may put forth all
the honest efforts possible, they may convert
men by the thousand, but when the returns
come in they will find the record against
them regardless of the vote. Mr. Donnelly
is rendering a public service by making a
contest which will expose and break up these
iniquities. He is justly entitled to the seat.
Whether Mr. Donnelly is liked personally, or
politically, all honest men, of whatever po
litical faith should rejoice to see Washburn
unseated and disgraced. In no other way
can the rotten system which he relies on for
political renown be rebuked.
It is not necessary to prove three thou
sand individual illegal votes to unseat Wash
burn. "Fraud vitiates the contract," and
that can be proven overwhelmingly. Those
who imagine that there is something strange
or peculiar in this contest are mistaken.
There is an almost exactly similar contest
in Pennsylvania, and in New York a contest
is being made on the ground that a man
bought his nomination, though he is not
charged with the improper use of money in
securing the election. It is claimed that a
man can be unseated for bribery in the
nominating convention, as well as at the
polls. If this rule was applied to Wash
burn, how long does any one suppose he
could hold his seat? If the people of this
district tamely submit to such outrages as
the recent election showed were perpetrated
on the ballot box, it is a farce to attempt
any more elections. There i3 every reason
why Mr. Washburn should be exposed, dis
graced and driven into private life.
MR. *AYES' MESSAGE.
Mr. R. B. Hayes, a citizen of Ohio who,
by sufferance of the people of the United
States, holds the office of President, yester
day submitted his annual message to Con
gress. It is not a document of exceptional
length, nor yet of exceptional brilliancy, and
were it not for the fact that it emanates from
a person holding a high official position, it
would command little attention.
The portion that, probably, will attract
the most notice and provoke the most dis
cussion is that which relates to the recent
elections in the South. The public has been
informed time and again for the past three
months that Mr. Hayes had taken, or was
about to take, a new departureto flaunt
anew the bloody shirt let slip the dogs of
warand again fan the flames of
sectional strife. This expectation has
not been realized as far as the message
goes. It is true he alludes to rumors to the
effect that in some parts of the Union
colored men have been deprived of the full
liberty of the franchise, but he does not
state it as a fact of his own personal knowl
edge or even as a matter substantiated by
trustworthy information. He merely alludes
to the matter to urge upon Congress, which
is the exclusive judge of the qualifications
and election of its own members, such ex
amination into the conduct of the elections
"as may be appropriate to determine the
validity of the claims of members to their
seats." At the same time he says he con
ceives it to be his duty, as President of the
United States, to inquire into any violations
of law that may be committed, and to
punish the perpetrators, on conviction, in an
exemplary manner. With these suggestions
and this determination no reasonable man
can find fault. The GLOBE will certainly
give Mr. Hayes credit for far more wisdom
and moderation than his party associates
have credited him with.
The only portion of the message in whioh
the cloven foot of the Chandler-Sherman
political idea manifests itself is his reference
to the insufficieny of the appropriation at
the command of the department of justice
for the prosecution of political offendeis.
Here a covert threat is made of extensive
prosecutions in contemplation, but this is
conveyed in a mild and half-hearted manner
that will probably inspire the "stalwarts" of
his party with uncontrollable rage and dis
appointment.
On the question of resumption Mr. Hayes
adheres to his previously expressed opin
ions. He is confident that, if no unfriendly
legislation is consummated or attempted at
the present session of Congress, Bpeoie re
sumption can be commenced on the date
fixed by the act of 1875, and trusts to the
natural development of the resources of the
country and the innate honesty of purpose
of the people to maintain it.
On the silver question he again takes an
&K%^^k*fc'i**'*s
unexpected ground. We have been given to
understand by Mr. Sherman and other of
the cabinet officers that if he did not go so
far as to recommend the demonetization of
the silver dollar, he would, at least, advo
cate an increase of its weight so as to make
it intrinsically of an equal value with gold.
But Mr. Hayes has done neither of these
things. While hinting that he is still of the
opinion that the remonetization act was
unwise, he admits that the silver
dollar has its uses and recom
mends that no new legislation
on that subject be undertaken. This will be
a sad blow to the secretary of the treasury
and to the New York Clearing House asso
ciation, who expeoted substantial aid from
Mr. Hayes in their crusade upon the dollar
of our dads.
There are other features of the message
that call for oomment, but we defer remarks
till another time. The message as a whole
will be an agreeable surprise to the more
moderate members of the party of which
Mr. Hayes is President, but a sad disap
pointment to. the stalwarts who have ex
pected so much from the spine-stiffening
labors of Zaek Chandler a few weeks ago.
RAILROAD DEVELOPMENT.
If any have had doubts of the future
destiny of the State of Minnesota and the
city of St. Paul, those doubts will have been
removed by a perusal of th9 article in yes
terday's GLOBE on our railroad development
during the past year. There is no better
gauge of the natural advantages of a country
than the progress of railroad enterprises.
Capitalists do not invest their money in the
construction of lines of railway through a
barren territory that promises little develop
ment for the future. They first seek those
regions that are fertile in natural productions
and inhabited by a frugal, industrious and
enterprising people. While in a measure
they seek to develop the country, they take
good care to insure themselves that it is
capable of development, and that there is
promise in the future that their investment
will pay. No higher compliment could
therefore be paid to the natural resources of
Minnesota than the fact that during the
year that is about to close, the capitalists of
this country and Europe have sought invest
ment for their surplus means in the con
struction of new lines of railroad within our
borders, and are yet ready to still further
add to the extent of our iron arteries.
During the year 1878 there have been con
structed within the limits of Minnesota a
total of three hundred and forty-three miles
of new road, connecting with the lines
previously constructed, and centering almost
exclusively in St. Paul. These additions
make the total mileage of railroads within
the State up to the present time two thousand
five hundred and thirty-three miles, which
shows an investment in these enterprises,
including equipments, of over one hundred
and thirty-five millions of dollars!
This development is extraordinary when
we consider the short time that has elapsed
since the first introduction of the iron horse
into the State and the many disadvantages
we have been obliged to encounter and over
come. The panic of 1873 and the depres
sion of business that succeeded it, put a
stop to all railway enterprises in
every part of the country. Then the
grasshopper plague visited us, and repelled
investment. But the elements of prosperity
inherent in the State could not be balked by
such untoward events, and at the first
symptom of returning stability in our finan
ces, capital crowded forward, eager to avail
itself of the splendid opportunities for prof
itable employment presented by our rapidly
developing industries. The ball was set in
motion early in 1877, and 1878 gave it an
impetus that has been most gratifying, while
the year 1879 promises to show a still great
er degree of progressa progress that will
no doubt assist materially in adding to the
population and wealth of the State, and
make of St. Paul the great commercial em
porium of the Northwest, commanding a
trade magnificent in its proportions, far
reaching in extent, and profitable alike to
our business men and manufacturers and to
the transportation companies that have
stretched their arms out toward the frontier
of civilization.
Minnesota has now a greater length of
railroad than any conntry in South America,
and in Europe it is exceeded only by Great
Britain, Russia,Germany, France, Spain and
Italy. Our roads are all thoroughly equipped,
and capable of transporting all the products
of our remarkably fertile soil to market, be
sides returning to the producers the mer
chandise and manufactures they may re
quire. They have connections extending
far into the adjoining territories of Dakota
and Manitoba, and before the next year shall
have closed their ramifications will extend
into the mining districts of Montana and the
Black Hills. To supply the population that
is now and will hereafter be gathered in the
vast territory traversed by these railroads
will be the privilege of the merchants of St.
Paul, and if they but wisely use then- ad-
vantage, the future of our city will be bright
with prosperity and commercial greatness.
Fort SnelHng Bridge.
At the regular weekly meeting of the
bridge commissioners yesterday morning,
all members were present except Mr. Thorn
ton. Instructions were given to County At
torney Rogers to notify owners of property
along Fort Snelling avenue of the action of
the board in condemning the property nec
essary to widen the avenue to a hundred feet.
H. J. Horn's account for legal services, $35,
was passed. The board waited till 11 o'clock
for Engineer Sewall, who had been notified
to attend, and as he did not then make his
appearance, an adjournment was made till
this morning. Commissioner Lindeke ex
pressed the opinion that it could not be ex
pected that four business men should be
kept waiting an hour for one man. He
thought the gentlemen on the board had
quite as much business to attend to as Mr.
Sewall possibly could have.
A. Small Fire.
An alarm was turned in from box 23, cor
ner of Robert and Tweltth streets, yester
day, at 9:45 o'clock, caused by the discovery
of a fire at the corner of Jackson and Viola
streets. The engines came promptly to the
alarm, and soon had out 2,400 feet of hose,
and commenced to play on the building.
The property was a two-story frame,
owned and occupied as a dwelling
by Mr. John Purvis. The fire
originated in the roof of the from a de
fective chimney. Fortunately, the flre de
partment got the flames under control, be
fore very extensive damage was done. The
roof was completely burnt up, and sdme
damage occurred from the water. Loss esti
mated at $ 150 insured for $1,000, in the
Fire and Marine Insurance company, of St.
Paul.
The Winona & St. Peter railroad, with its
branches, has 405 miles of track. .1"

ant conversation about going to the lodge.
Witness, deceased, and Mr. Levy went
together to the lodge. Deceased
did not play cards. Decased
did not appear disturbed he appeared as usu
al. Witness did not see deceased after 4 o'clock
did not see him have any money.
By Mr. WimbishDid he ever play cards
AnswerYes -but not for large sums. Mr
Bergman then continued, that he had reoeived
a postal card got it on his desk next morning,
Monday. That was the first intimation he had
of Battler's death. The postal card, heretofore
published in the GLOBE, was placed in evidence,
as follows:
FEIEND BEBGMAN: Please tell brother Henry
and Jake that they will find me in or near the
Mississippi river by the bridge, where I shall
probably fight a duel. Your friend,
DAVID C. BATTLES.
By Mr. GibbonsIs that Battler's hand
writing aud signature?
AnswerIt is. I recognize both handwrit
ing and signature. It is his usual handwriting.
JACOB SATTLEB'S STOBV CONTINUED.
Mr. Jacob B. Sattler was recalled. Witness
said he had papers to exhibit to the jury.
Thereupon witness submitted the following
postal cards which were read to the jury by the
coroner, (and which have been exclusively pub
lished in the GLOBE heretofore:)
NOVEMBEE 24.
BROTHER JAKE Take care of Joe and every
body of our folks. And dear parents. It is
nonsense for me to have this fight, but I must.
Nobody knows why, only him and me. Your
brother, DAVE.
Regards to all. Be sure to find my body.
BBOTHEBHENBY: Collect of I. Heiman $11,
cash loaned. Take care of all the business.
Pay dollar for dollar we owe to respect me. I
Bhall have a duel and may get killed should I,
find my body in the Mississippi river. Your
brother, DAVID C. SATTLEB.
By Mr. MontfortDo you recognize the hand
writing on these cards and signature as your
brother's?
AnswerYes. Witness also identified the Bergman card as
his brother's.
By the CoronerYou testified last Saturday
that your brother had balanced his books be
fore he committed suicide, the Saturday be
fore or Sunday of his death. When was he in
the habit of balancing his books?
Weekly. The last balance showed $284 cash
on hand. What he did with that money I don't
know we have not found it.
By Mr. GibbonsWhen did your brother
make the last deposit?
AnswerI don't know.
Mr. GibbonsWhat were your sales Friday?
AnswerI don't remember.
Mr. GibbonsWhat were the sales Saturday
AnswerAbout 85.
Mr. GibbonsWhat Sunday morning?
AnswerI don't know I didn't figure up I
went out of town that Sunday night.
Mr. GibbonsHave you looked in hia bank
book since?
AnswerI have not. When I got back the
sheriff had charge.
Mr. GibbonsWhere would you have looked
for the money, knowing for instance that your
sales had been the above amount?
AnswerI would have looked in his pocket
book, in his pocket.
The Coroner Mr. Sattler ,you will produce
your brother's bank book, etc.
It was finally concluded not to introduce
them.
Mr. GibbonsYou stated that Friday's salcB
were $25, Saturday's $85 and Sunday's $20,
and you stated that he must have had about
$200 with him
AnswerYes, I learned it from his books, the
balance,
Mr. MonfortAs I understand it, Mr. Sat
tler says these sales were only made known to
him by looking at the balance since his broth
er's death, I don't think his evidence can be
material in the matter.
Mr. WimbiBhAs brother of deceased, do
you think he has been the victim of foul play?
AnswerI can't say. I left here on Sunday
nisjht, and knew nothing of it until I returned
Tuesday morning.

Mrs. France was next summoned and called,

and resided at No. Cedar street. She knew
D. C. Sattler had become acquainted with him
as she had with other gentlemen. He was a

Mr. OrschelMrs. France has stated that I
was in the parlor, and that Kitty was there.
She was not there, I did not see her that night.
Mrs. France, Mr. Heiman. Sattler and myself

never saw the women at all, and was never

Mr. WimbishYou asked for beer, who
brought it in?
AnswerThe old woman, Mrs. France.
HE "GLOBE'S" ACCOUNT MADE OFFICIAL.
A GLOBE reporter, who saw Sattler in the
water, heard his cries for assistance, and saw
his struggles to repair his error, was next
called and sworn. Thereupon the account of
the "Midnight Tragedy" was made a part of
the official proceedings of the inquest.
The reporter was then questioned as to his
knowledge about "the trouble" and "words"
which had happened at Mrs. France's, when
Sattler was there-Sunday night. Again the
GLOBE'S account of what did occurr at Mrs.
France's was made official. [This proved that a
quarrel did occur, and that another was present
on whom Kitty lavished her affections.
"Where did you learn this?" was the next
question.
In the course of my professional business,
from parties who were there, heard and saw
the whole thing."
"Who were they?"
Thereupon the GLOBE man threw himself
back upon the constitutional privilege guaran
teed by Our Fathers and enjoined iu the Dec
laration of Independance, that a newspaper
must know everything, and give nothing
away.
The coroner's jury sagaciously recognized the
privilege.
The reporter didn't tell.
THE MAN WHO FOUND THE BODY.
G- C. Loiseau -was recalled. He repeated
how he had found the body. He, Charles St.
John, Joe Ebert and John Gillineau had formed
a partnership to search for the body. They be
gan the search last Wednesday. Friday night
they searched by torchlight up to 10 o'clock.
Saturday morning did not look. But were go
ing te work when they found the body. They
did find it Saturday, not before. Did not
search it left the body as they found it. No
body examined the pockets. They had looked
over the spot, and dragged the river where the
body was found, but the grappling hooks had
caught hold of nothing. Never had heard that
anybody else had touched anything they
thought was the body.
OTHEBS OF THE SEAECUING PABTY.
Charles St. John was oalled and sworn. He
stated substantially the samo a3 submitted by
the above witness. The search had been made
two by two, in boats. He and Gillineau had
searched Friday night. The first seen of the
body was when it was found Saturday about
noon.
Joseph Ebert was sworn. He testified to all
that was said above. He thought he had had
hold of the body once before, near the same
spot where found, but didn't succeed in find
ing it.
Valentine Sherman re-callelHe related
graphically how he first caught sight of the
body. Others said it was a stump. He in
sisted to the contrary, and the boat was brought
up and the body found. He had talked with
one of deceased's brothers about the reward.
The very morning the body was found he had
entered into a partnership with the other four,
Loiseau, Gillineau, St. John and Ebert. When
found the body was on its face, and was not
touched, or turned, or searched until the coroner
gave orders.
This ended the testimony. The jury declared
its readiness to arrive at a verdict, and there
upon, after a brief discussion, tho following
verdict was found:

Hokah Blade: John Evenkorf, the man
prrested on suspicion as the murderer of
Nicholas Ponselet, was again brought into
court, but nothing of importance was brought
out that would aid in any way to convict
him of the crime. It is a hard matter to
prove that there has actnally been a murder
committed, and as there is no such proof in
this case, Evendorf will be discharged until
the body of the missing man is found, and
it now seems probable that it never will be,
as the man's friends have given up the hunt
after making a thorough scouring of the
country between Hokah and La Crescent.

Fergus Falls Journal: Information waa
received by the returning witnesses from
Deer Creek that Mrs. Miilke's new born in
fant was dead and the mother lay danger
ously sick. As this woman's husband was
held at Fergus Falls to answer an indictment
for shooting J. B. Hompe, and also held as
a witness against Hompe i the ox stealing
case, both these cases were put ovsr to the
next term of court, and Millke was allowed
to go home to hia suffering family. It is a
sad reflection in this case that it is possible
that the death of the infant (and perchance
the mother) is the result of the injuries the
mother claims to have received some months
ago from violence inflicted by an officer of
the law.
