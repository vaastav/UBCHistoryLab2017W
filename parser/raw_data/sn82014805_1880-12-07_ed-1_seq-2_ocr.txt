Wfl art Indebted to our old friend
Kev. James Mclutlre, internal Revenue
Collector for this district, for au early
pamphlet copy of th« Annual Keport of
tbe Secretary of the Treaaury, for which
th« efficient and obliging Collector will
accept oar thanks.
Tint President's Message es we stated
yesterday, in a brief reference to It, is a
very long document presenting little
that is qew or entertaining to tbe gen
eral reader, its publication in full there
fore, haa not been thought necessary by
a great number of newspapers. Tbe
pressure upon the columns of the
OazxTTfl precludes our publishing more
than a synopsis. Tbe docament is a
very creditable state paper, aud shows
that tbe President desires the prosperity
of tbs whole country although lie may
not favor the way of bringiug this about
wbicb tbe Democrats commend.
Mr. Hayes' administration has on the
whole been a better oue than hia op
ponents bal been led lo expect
he went Into office over the great w .ong
that bad been perpetrated upon the
voters of tke country whose voice was
overridden and set at defiance by his
installation.
The Messages of tbe Pn - i lents of late
years have not the influeuc. they formerly
possessed, aud are, tbeielore, given very
little aUeutiou. Nothing could illustrate
tins more fully tliau the disregard which
Cougresa paid to the recommendation ot
the policy of Civil Service Kefoitn by
Mr. Hayes, in hia tirât annual message.
That policy was wholly disregarded by
hia party, aud dually set a.iJo by him
self; aud yet he returns to it aud urges
Ils adoption with as much force in this
his last annual message as though it bad
not been made the scoff of such men as
CoDkling, Devens, Edmunds, and Sher
man, and the ablest men of his party.
The Message recommends Mr. Sher
man's financial policy for issuing nl trea
sury notes not lesa denomination than
$10, bearing a low rate of interest, to take
up the per cent, bonds coming due
during the next ten years, ihe first ot
which, lo the amount of $*2,Stfl,64b, are
due and payable on the 30th of June
next. These boude amount to tf>-0,
004,708.48, and fall due each year, in
amounts fiom forty-three millions next
June to sixty-one millions iu June 1801,
The argumeut advanced for this is tliai
tbe sbundsnee of money will enable the
people to take these treasury notes or
small bonds as an investment, and they
can be redeemed through the sinking
fund as they become due, while tlieii
Issue would save the government frern
buying the 4^ per cent, bonds at a pre
mium. What effect the issue of these
notes will have upon the money market
will doubtless form a theme for news
paper discussion. The large amount of
coined mofley now coming into the
country has not served to inflate the
market; but whether forty-three mil
lions ol treasury motes can he added
without doing so will depend much
upon circumstances at thu time of Ibeii
issue.

Secrmtaby Bhibhak in his kiinual
report gives tho ordinary revenues of
the government for the fiscal yeai

turet $267,642,957.78.
$73,904,617.41 was applied to the sink

The total receipts, actual
and estimated, for tlie current fiscal
year were set down at $3-50,000,000,and

during the rtfcess is recommended by
the Secretary.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
From the M. Y. Herald.
Ah tu finance» also tlie President
intimates that in bis oninion a
double monetary standard is not
merely permitted but is required by
the constitution of tbe United States.
Though his language on this subject
is somewhat hazy that seems to be
its fairest construction, and it cer
tainly is an interpretation < f the
constitution wbicb cannot be accept
ed. Both as to tbe disposition of
the greenback currency and aH to
the light weighted »ilver dollar liier«
is some discrepancy of views be
tween the President and the Secre
tary of the Treasury. The Presi
dent recommends not merely tbs
withdrawal of tbe legal tender
quality from Treasury notes, but
their total withdrawal from circula
tion, while the Secretary would keep
them in circulation shorn of the
legal tender quality. The President
also retrain* from recommending the
absolute cessation of a silver dollar
coinage, which the Secretary pre
sents as one of his alternative modes
for the treatment of the silver ques
tion.
In respect to civil service reform
President advises a multitude of
remedial statutes. But he makes
uo allusion to his celebrated "Civil
Service Order, No. 1," dated June
22, 1877, which forbade all civil
officers "to take part in the manage
ment of political organizations,
caucuses, conventions or election
campaigns," and declared that "uo
assessment for political purposes on
officers or subordinates should b«
allowed."
With regard to wliatused tobe call
ed the "Southern question," inasmuch
as President Hayes' course concerning
it has been signalized by more up
rightness and consistency than his con
duct touching the' c.vil service, so bis
recommendations will carry greater
weight. No just exception can bo
taken to his appual to Congress to see
"that every case of violation of the
letter or spirit of tbe fifteenth amend
ment of the constitution is thoroughly
investigated, and that no benefit from
such violation shall accrue to any per
son or party." As to his proposition
for liberal grants of public lauds and
appropriations from the federal Treas
ury to assist popular education in the
.Southern Sta'es, it is premature to
give assent lo .t. The idea was first
broached in a speech of President
Hayes in Ohio only a few months ago,
and a'though Congressional land
grant* to all the btales proportionally
for educational purposes are not novel
yet the sectional character of the gifts
wbicli arc now proposed and the vast
scale on which they arc suggested, as
the relations of the project to
tho federal homestead laws, all lorbid
a hasty acquiescence in such a plan
without sight of the details by
it is proposed to be carried into execu
tion. The same may be said with te
gard to the President's vague outline
sketch of an immense scheme of inter
nal improvements in the Valley of rhe
Mississippi, comprising not only that
stream but all its tributaries.
U is sstisfacrory to know that the
President heartily approves the new In
ti an policy which contemplates as its
ultimate purpose the dissolution of tn
nal relations and transite matlon of the
ludians Into citizens. The too brief
approval of legislation to institute postal
savings banks also is auislaclory. The
maintenance of the army alitsfull legal
strength is exhorted and large appropri
ations are advised for sea coast defences
