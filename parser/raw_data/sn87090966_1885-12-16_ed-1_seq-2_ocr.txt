THIS PAPER ffA.!KMJil?P
Wednesday. December 16. 1885.
TiiE'revlral metlni: continue to draw
crowded homes, but converts nr. only
of the nrgatlre character.
Tkxub towns subscribed $02,033.08 of
the $12.1,519.57 donnted to the iufTerrn
of the Galveston lire, which li a glonlng
pig. In the hlitory of the State.
Tin wnter-worli question la rapidly
t'ecomleg an laaue, In which the few era
hare been loat alght of. Candldatea
whoae platform la city water-works next
winter, will be overwhelmingly elected.
Tnit llaaonNewa aaya that the people
of that aeotlnn ar. ready to atart the
railroad enterprise, from San Antonio up
through the northwest, provided the
people of San Antonio put up $150,000 ot
the amount.
Tub Waco Day aaya ; "Boycotting has
taken a new turn In Philadelphia, where
merchants and dealera hare been warned
not to aell to or deal with non-union
men. If thla thing goea on, we shall
aoon have to brand men as we do cattle
to know who la who."
The Ulategue Hospital, Just completed
In the City of Mexico, cost $100,000, and
accommodates only 100 patients, while
the new City Hospital In this city, In
course of conatructlon, will cost only
$32,000, with every modern appliance,
and It will accommodate E0 patients.
A okkat many papers have b.sn
wasting time and space discussing tbelr
candidates for Governor and other State
olllccs, which considering the fact that
the election Is about a year on, Is a lit
tle premature. An energetic number of
"kids" may be able to capture the con
vention before the "wah bosses" get
Into line.
CntTiiN cOl.lous defead.rs or the
Water-works speak of the generosity of
that company In furnishing the city
with sparkling water. Some people
might put considerable stress upon the
statement, If It were not known that th.
water supply belongs to the city, as one
of the vested rights of years ago. Mr.
Ilrackenrldge simply pumps It up and
puts about three prices upon It as his
charge for furnishing It.
ItKntESKNTATIVB WallXKK SSJS Of that
part of the President's message relating
to the silver question : "I do not agree
with the President's views upon the sil
ver question. There are some things
possible and some things Impossible. It
Is Impossible to have a oontractlon of the
ourrenoy to the extent of one-third of It
by taking gold out or olroulatlon and at
the same time have what Is left depre
ciated by 20 per cent., as It Is asserted
will be the case. Such a thing never
took place In any country In the world
In any age, and It never can."
"Commmicul bodies throughout the
country," says the Cincinnati Times
Star, "are pleased with the silver sug
gestions or the President and Secretary
Manning. Many or them will have
something to say to Congress before th.
end orthe session In favor of susuendlnir
coinage till there shall have been an ad
Justment of relations between the two
money metala. Among eagaclous men
ofaflalrslt Is the common orlnlon thst
the danger of depreciated silver haa
more to do Just now In preventing the
revival and expansion of business the
threatened tariff agitation."
Tim deolded stand taken by Mr. W,
D. Cleveland and several others In
Houston regarding the boycott of the
Age by the Knights of Labor, will serve
as an example In future rackets of that
kind, and reduce In some respects the
natural inconvenience created by a boy-
oott. Mr. Cleveland aet an example
which was quickly followed by a num-
birof people In Houston, who without
sjcIi a leader would have aooeded to
the demands of the boycotters. It Is
noticeable, too, that the tone of the State
papers has changed In the past few
weeks from a weak remonstrance with
the Knights to an out and out opposition
totbe general polloy of the boycotters.
The lloerne Advance says: "The San
Antonio I.ioiit is waging a savage war
upon the Water-worka monopoly. The
Liciiit appears to have Justice on lis
side."
"The paper wad tired at the free grass
harnna tiv ilovrrnnr Ir lanu liss not vet
hit to hurt much. Not a single convic
tion and none likely to ie, unless me
fierce State executive follows President
Cleveland's example by giving them a
certain time In which to vacate or h.
wilt bounce them bodily. He has six
companies of rangers at hla command,
but lacka the bsck bone of the Demo
cratic President for which the bourbons
have been praying so long. When
nrnver sari "irlt" thev sit and don't
you forget It. When John, of Seguln,
says go, they answer, "not ir we anow
ourselves, and you dare not put us out."
That's the difference of the Democratic
President and the Demooratlo Ooveraor
of th. banner Democratic State.
The New York Sun In an article hint
ing that Miss Cleveland wrote part of
ii. ir..i!flnt'. uipasacAsafs: "If Miss
Cleveland did, as appears to be the case,
lurnlsh her Droiner wnn tue mosi in.
.ml ener.eils oassace In bis dis
cussion or the Mormon problem, the tact
Is certainly very interesting, is is per
Inn. the first time in the history or the
United States that a woman hns con
trlbuted so Important a part or so Ito
.iiiii mi. i. tim.r. The Incident Is
equally creditable to the President and
to Ulss Cleveland, and we need mat. no
...nlrnrf for vIl.UllllLT. fuf tbls UnC. tbf
taolt convention which treats the annual
If ihev Here the product lull
of a single pen and necessarily the work
of the President himself throughout."
To the l.ionr: The Times was never
"toady" enough to leave Its own party,
betray Its political friends and sell nut,
lock, stock and barrel, for a stipulated
price, to another polllloal party. Ibis
iha l.imiT did. bv lis own conlesslnn, In
the last municipal election,"
In the last municipal election there
wero three Democrats, and no Ilepubll-
can running for Mayor, therefore the
Light had to choose rrom what politi
cally would be considered on Its part, as
three evils. Mr. Ilryan Laiiagnan was
nlnated on the following platrorm:
n..r,w,.flT That the vital Interests
orthe city Imperatively require that the
POIICy OI tne incoming lllj aumiuiaiin-
lion bo a prudent and progressive one,
.,i ih.fiir demand that there
shall be Inaugurated and completed a
thorough system OI urainagoioriue ouy
ami maeailamlilnir or oavlniT or the
streets and plazas, the laying or side-
aixs and crossings.
"Thai aa anno as it can MIBllblV be
done, we are In ravor or the acquisi
tion by the city ol a complete system oi
ntcr-woras, oy ixm.ua '"
WISE.
"'I hat all the Improvements eo far as
nrarllxal.il. .hall be made t)V the cltV It-
s.ir under proper supervision or compe
tent persons, and by the labor of our
wn people.
"That a favor the Issuance and Bale
orth. necessary amount or bonds with
in the limns prescnoeu oy iu. gunner,
as it may be amended, to raise funds to
carry out theae measures."
This being tbo I.iaiiT eenumenis 11
would have given it a good support,
but the managers or the Callaghan cam
paign wishing to make It more or a
personal light, and asking more
apace than the Light waa willing to
give (re ..for audi purposes, as It had no
special Interest In advocating Mr. Cal
laghan'e personal claim they ofleied to
pay for It, the same as any business man
pays ror his advertisement. They did
nay, aad won. If the Light Is ot no use
or Influence, why did these men pay ror
what the Toady Times claims to have
given for nothing? The Lioht had no
especial Interest In Mr. Callaghan, but it
did have In publlo Improvements, and
that the city should own the water
worka. Although the Toady Tlmea
claims to have stood upon thst platform,
and the Mayor was elected upon It,
hat have they done to redeem their
pledges to the people? Any reader of
the Light can plainly see that It has
ralthrully pursued the policy It advo
cated with Mr. Callaghan, but . bile this
paper has been outspoken at all times,
the Mayor's position on the water-works
question la unknown and can only be
judged rrom the utterauces of his organ,
the Toady Times, when it takes the pnrt
nJ advocates the Interest or tbo n ater-
works Company as against the Interest
of the people. The Light is not afraid
or Its course at any time.
MEXICAN ITEMS.
Coni.lll's Japanese Troupe haa made

The Datrlotlc subscription raised in

The pirate LaOtte Is still remembered
