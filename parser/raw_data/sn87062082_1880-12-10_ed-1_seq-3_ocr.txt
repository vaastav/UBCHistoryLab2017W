PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
"Washington, December 5th. The
President's annual message is the
largest stale paper ever sent to Con
gress by Present Llaj-cs. - It st.irls
With a review of the present condi
tion of the country, and dwells at
some length upon the rapid growth
of our national prosperity, our beau
tiful crops and souml financial sys
tem, and predicts still greater pros
perity for the future. Th; Prcsidaut
Incidentally alludes to the jrrowth of
education throughout the country
and 10 the necessity of fostering it
by proper legislation, and gives
some details of a plan approved by
him for the I'urrWr development of
educational facilities.
THB SOUTHERN QCES1ICK !
Is treated at considerable length.
The President expresses satisfaction
with the outlook of affairs in the
South, lie believes that the South
is steadily advancing in the direction
of political frucdom and toleration,
and that before long the ballot in
section will be as tree ns in the
North. The nxt stage in southern
develiiiments will soon come in.
' This will happen through division
m th; while ruling elements, and
When these divisions come the negro
will be an object of protection and
interest to all political pasties.
Upon tlie
MORMON QUESTION
The President uses plain language
and urges Congress to adopt meas
ures as will secure the speedy bol
ishment of evil. The President says
Ihc fact so large a community has
been been permi.ted to lire in open
defiance of the laws ot the United
States and of morality, is a national
disgrace and ong that should here
moved without delay. The Presi
dent sazsests to Contrress that if
there is no way of reaching polyga
mists under the present organization
of territory, its entire system should
be reorganised with a view of pro
viding a speedy method of prosecu
ting and pur ishing all who pefeisl
in practicing polygamy.
CIVIL SERVICE.
The President believes in appoint
ing: good men to ofllce and continu.
ins them during sood behavior. lie
also believes in the theory of sepa
rating government service from pol
itics, and elaborated his well known
ideas upon these subjects and points
in illustration to the improvement
made in the New York Custom
House and New York Pct Ofiice.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
He takes up the subject or foreign
relations as presented by the Stale
Department and reviews the condi
tion of affairs existing between this
government and ihe leading foreign
government, part relating to Eng
land; gives current history of North
American fisheries question, and
repeats the views expressed in the
tp-cial message which he sent to
Congress last spring, which in effect
recommends the restoration of duty
on Canadian fish.
SUBSIDIES.
The President does not believe in
subsidies but he does approve of
giving liberal mail contracts to
pioneer merchant marine enterprises
as one means of encouraging an in
dustry which, he thinks.through ut
wise policy, is ntedlessly languish
ing.
The next subjr-ct of interest is the
CHINESE QUESTION
Anil consists of a recital of the ap
pointment of the Chinese Commis
sion and of its works. The Presi
dent promises to sen 1 a special mes
sage upon the subject when the full
text of the treaty is received. lie
says that the first treaty Is a modifi
cation of the Burlingame treaty and
, solves satisfactorily His Chinese
question in politics in this country.
The Chinese government is not at
all anxious to bave its subjects emi
grate and was willing lo meet the
Commissioners more than half way
on all restrictions against Chinese
immigration to this country sug
gested by the commission. Second
trenty relates to commerce entirely.
He takes up the history of the
TREASURY DEPARTMENT
During his administration and em
bodies in his message Secretary
Sherman's review of the history of
specie resumption, lie calls upon
Congress to take tome steps to re
tund 7,000,000,000 of boDds that fall
due next year. There is no recom
mendation to Congress for the with
drawal of the legal tender of green
hacks nor is there any recommenda
tion for the stoppage of the coinage
of silver dollars.
The President mp.kes a strong rec
ommendation on the necessity of
strengthening our
COAST DEFENCES
At the present time all the great
commercial porta of the United
States arc in an absolutely defence
less condition and in the event of
foreign trouble, incalculable damage
would iusue to our commercial in
terests before Ihe first steps of real
defence could be made. The Presi
dent calls on Congress to tafeo this
subject into eodsiderat ion and pro.
vide for a system of liberal appro-
priations lo remedy this great weak
ncss.
JUDICIAL.
Jie rccom meeds Congress to p iss
a bill nu'horizing the establishment
of an intermediate Court between
Circuit and Supreme Court for the
purpose of ruling, on account of the
ordinary pressure of business under
which the latter is struggling.
Indian Affairs.
He reviews Secretary Schurtz" pol
icy towards Indians with approval,
and thinks his plan for educating
tho Indian so that he can take care
ef him3elf is the 0UI3' true solution
of the Indian question- He calls
upon Congress lo give aid in the way
of appropriations to encourage this
plan which looks to the establish
ment of the Indion upon land of his
o-n, breaking of tribal relations and
the gradual 'withdrawal of financial
support on part r.f the Government.
EDUCATION.
The President alludes lo the He-
port of the Commissioner of Educa
tion. The chief point of this para
graph of the messace is the Presi
dent's recommendation that the
remainder of the public limits of
the country be set aside lor the edu-
cstion of the illiterate 01 all sec
tions. This Would it-suit, the Presi
dent says, in giving it most to the
South where most illiteracy ex:.-Cs.
The education of this class, both
white and black, would have a ten
dency to place the two sections on
close intellectual level and conse
quently in closer bonds.
CONGRESS.
Washington, D. C, December 7.
The reassembling of Congress to-day-
was quiet and ordurly and without
incident worthy of note. In the
House, the man probably - receiving
the most congratulations was Gen.
Weaver, the Greenback candidate
for President. Tho usual formality
ot calling the roll was gone through
with in the Senate and House, fol
lowed by the appointment of a joint
committee lo wait upon the Presi
dent and inform him that Congress
Was ready lo receive any coinmuni
catien he might desire to make. Re
cess was then taken.
Gene.-al William B. Hazen has
been appointed Chief Signal Officer.
General Ord is put up on the re
tired list and General Auger takes
the department of Texas, vice Ord.
SILVER KING.
San FuANCisto, December 7.
Silver King has declared a dividend
of twenty-five cents per share.
CHINESE UOI5IJED.
LoRBSHLRG, N. M-, December 7.
This mo: nijg about half past eight
the pay car paid off a gang of China
men working 0:1 the track east of
this place. Shortly afterward two of
the Chinamen started for camp
about half a mile distant with 1,13
with them. They were met on the
road by two meu in disguise who
demand d the money. Upon being
refused one of the robbers shot twice
and wounded odc of the -Chinamen
in the back and head and all the
money was taken from him. The
other Chinaman fled lo camp and
gave the alarm, when about twenty
of the gang startej out iu pursuit
but without avail. The robbers left
souttiwaid for Ihe mountains and
the prospect is thai they will escape
with their booty.

Vulture Mine, Dec. 2, 1S80.
Ed. Herald: The howl of the
cayote and the yell of tlis Indian,
formerly the only music that re
sounded on the Yullure air, was a
few days back superseded by the
welcome shrieks of the whistles of
the various engines in connection
with Ihe C. A. Mining Company's
works. They were gay founds let
me tell you to many a broken work
man in tho camp, as they betckefie'd i
work in a few days for all. If noth
ing occurs to delay tho starting of
the mill in all probability it will be
running before this reaches the eves
of vour readers and it is the belief of
the mining experts of the camp that
the company will reap large profits
every month.
RICH GOLD DISCOVEICIE3.
Some new gold discoveries arc
causing quite an excitement here;
one iu particular, the find of two
French miners is really rich and
looking better and assaying higher
as they sink it. .
If these new claims continue to
improve as they go down on them,
the Vulture Camp is destined to be
one of the richest and liveliest on the
Pacific slope and that at no distant
day.
Business ftt prerent is a little dull
but there are hones and justly so
that a bri.sk turn iu affairs will be
the result when the mine and mill
are in full bla-t. The notable events
of the camp since my last letter are
like angel visits few and far be
tween. A birthday party resulting
in a ball at night at the Barnes
Hotel was quite a nice, if not aristo
cratic, little affair.

But for a timely alarm, a fire which
broke out iu Mr. B. Kirkland's store
would have laid the Vulture Camp
111 ashes in a few hours. The burst
ing of a lamp was the cause of the
flame.

There is a good reason for the be
ief lhat. the mines of Arizona and
Sonora will, in a few years, says the
San Francisco News Letter, develop
intoafull compensation for the decay
of the Comslock lode in Nevada,
Until the Southern Pacific railroad
penetrated the region beyond the
Colorado river, mining operations ia
Arizona were conducted with ex
treme difficulty and at enormous ex
pense. The use of heavy machinery
was almost impossible. Now that
the railroad can be employed for the
transportation of machinery, to with
in a few miles of the best mines, a
sudden impulse is given to mining
industry iu that quarter, aud il is
not rasli to predict lhat. within live
years trom this date, there will he
.nore mills and stamps in Arizona,
anil along the Sonora line aud just
over the b rder than wre at any

examine the Tun baton ti district, has
returned nd informs the News Let
ter that there are iu that district four
or five ot the best silver mines in the
world. Altogether they are operating
over 100 stamps anil the OiC crushed

entire rock of the ledges. These are

Tombstone is within thirty miles of
Benson, a railway gtovrn. A good

It is a very lively town of nearly
3,003, having polled over 800 votes at
the late election. Just across the
line, in the State of Sonora, prospect
ing has developed what are supposrd
to be mines equal to those of 'lomb
stone; and they will be supplied
with machinery as soon as capital
verifies the prospect. There are pay
ing mini s at intervals all along (he
entire course of the S. P. Railroad, us
far as it has gone. The Atchison,
Topeka aud San'.a Fe roud will
penetrate Arizona from the East, and
tap what is believed to be a first-class
mining region, more than 100 miles

Editor Herald The following
is a nut for scientists to crack:. On
the night of November 4, John Mot";
ton, a miner working on the 200 foot
level of the Tip-Top, was suddenly
startled by a sharp report occurring
a lew feet 1:1 his rear and upon in
vestigation discovered his wood
en tamping stick shattered into a
thousand pieces. There being no
caps nor powder near, the only reus;
enable explanation and on; gener
ally concurred in by miners cogni
zant of the facts Is that the explosion
was caused by a rock filling on the
tamping bar which was an old ou
and bad been thoroughly saturated
with glycerine. May not this explain
the cause of many premature ex
plosions occurring while holes are
being tamped and would it not be
wise to substitute something else for
wood for thai purpose.

It is hard to outdo Texas and New
Mexico on centipede stories, but for
once Utah his taken the lead. There
wers several Mexicans in camp in
the southern part ttf the territory ihe
other day, and were laying about the
fire when one of them, Telestoro
Crucase, saw a large centipede, fully
uine inches long traveling slowly
over his leg. Kuowing that the least
motion would make it skin its deadly
claws into his sink, without moving
his leg he got his revolver and wailed
until the beast had almost reached
his knee, when, slowly putting Ihe
mouth of the pistol to its head, he
pulled and the centipede was gone.
But a ceaiipedu's claws are quicker
than guupowdcr, and Crucase began
to have cramps in a few minutes.
The track of the reptile alonir his
leg turned a brownish yellow, and
ihc place where it was killed swelled
frightfully. He rapidly grew worse,
and in a little over four hours died
in great agony. The most singular
part of the story is that the bullet
from C'rusase's pistol cut a small
nick in the foreleg of a mule that
was tethered near by, and at daylight
next morning the' mule was also
dead, wilh its leg so swollen lhat the
skin had burst in several places.
About twenty of the Texas cow
