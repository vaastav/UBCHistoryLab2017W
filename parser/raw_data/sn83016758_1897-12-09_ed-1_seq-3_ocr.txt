"Still Hopes That International Bi
metallism May Be Ac
complished.
Washington, Dec. 7President McKin
ley yesterday sent his annual message to
congress. He congratulated it upon as
sembling under felicitous conditions.
.Peace and good will with all the nations
of the earth continue unbroken, he says,
and we should feel genuine satisfaction
at the growing spirit of fraternal regard
and unification in all sections of our
country and the lifting of great public
questions above party prejudice.
The work of putting our finances upon
a sound basis, difficult as it may seem,
will appear easier when we recall the
financial operations of the government
-*ince 1866. On the 30th of June of that
y3ar we had outstanding demand liabili
ties in the sum of $72S,SlS,447.41 On the
first of January, 1879, these liabilities had
been reduced to $443,889,493.S8 Of our
interest bearing obligations, the figures
are even mere striking. On July 1, 1866,
the principal of the interest bearing debt
of the government was #2,332.331,208. On
the first day of July, 1893, this sum had
been reduced to $583,037,100, or an aggre
gate reduction of $1,747,294,108. The in
terest bearing debt oi the United States
on the first day of December, 1897, was
$847,365,620. The government money now
outbtanding (Dec. 1) consists of $346,681,-
016 of United States notes, $107,793,280 of
treasury notes issued by authority of the
law of 1890. $384,963,303 of silver certif
icates, and $G1,230, (61 of standard silver
dollars.
With the great resources of the gov
ernment, and with the honorable example
of the past before us, we ought not to
hesitate to enter upon a currency revision
which will make our demand obligations
less onerous to the government and re
lieve our financial laws from ambiguity
and doubt. The brief review of what
was accomplished from the close of
the war to 1893, makes unreasonable
and groundless any distrust either of our
financial ability or soundness while the
situation from 1893 to 1897 must admonish
congress of the immediate necessity of so
legislating as to make the return of the
conditions then prevailing impossible.
There are many plans proposed as a
remedy for the evil. Before we can find
the true remedy we must appreciate the
real evil. It is not that our currency of
every kind is mot good, for every dollar
of it is good, good because the govern
ment's pledge is out to keep it so and that
the pledge will not be broken. However
the guaranty of our purpose to keep the
pledge will be best shown by advancing
toward its fulfillment.
The evil of the present system is found
in the great cost to the government of
maintaining the parity of our different
forms of money, that is, keeping all of
them at par with gold. We surely can
not be longer heedless of the burden this
imposes upon the people, even under fair
ly prosperous conditions, while the past
four years have demonstrated that it is
not only an expensive charge upon the
government, but a dangerous menace to
the National Credit.
It is manifest that we must devise some
plan to protect the government against
bond issues for repeated redemptions.
We must either curtail the opportunity
for speculation, made 'easy by the multi
plied redemptions of our demand obliga
tionf, or increase the gold reserve for
their redemption. We have $900,000,000
of currency which the government by
solemn enactment has undertaken to keep
at par with gold. Nobody is obliged to
redeem in gold but the government. The
banks are not required to redeem in gold.
The government is obliged to keep equal
with gold all its outstanding currency
and coin obligations, while its receipts
are not required to be paid in gold. They
are paid in every kind of money but' gold,
and the only means by which the govern
ment can with certainty get gold is by
borrowing, It can get it in no other way
when it most needs it. The government
without any fixed gold revenue is pledged
to maintain gold redemptions which it
has steadily and faithfully done, and
which under the authority now given it
will continue to do.
The law which requires the govern
ment after having redeemed its United
States notes to pay them out again as
current funds demands a constant re
plenishment of the gold reserve. This is
especially so times of business panic,
and when the Revenues are insufficient to
meet the expenses of the government.
At such times the government has no
other way to supply its deficit and main
tain redeption but through the increase
of its bonded debt, as during the admin
istration of my predecessor, when $262,
315,400 of 4% per cent bonds were issued
and sold, and the proceeds used to pay
the expenses of the government in ex
cess of the revenues, and sustain the gold
reserve. While it is true that the greater
part of the proceed of these bonds were
used to supply deficient revenues, a con
siderable portion was required to main
tain the gold reserve.
Low-Pricefl Bonds.
With our revenues equal to our ex
penses, there would be no deficit requir-,
'ing the issuance of bonds. But if the
.gold reserve falls below $100,000,000, how
will it be replenished, except by selling
.more bonds? Is there any other way
practicable under existing law? The seri
ous question then is, shall we continue
the policy that has been pursued in the
past that is, when the gold reserve
areaches the point of danger, issue more
"bonds and supply the needed gold, or
shall we provide other means to prevent
these recurring drains upon the gold re
serve?
If no other legislation is had, and the
policy of selling bonds is to be continued
then congress should give the secretary
of the treasury authority to sell bonds
at long or short periods, bearing a less
rate of interest than is now authorized by
I earnestly recommend, as soon as the
ireceipts of the government are quite suffi
cient to pay all the expenses of the gov
ernment, that when any of the United
States notes are presented for redemption
in gold and are redeemea in gold, such
motes shall be kept and set apart and only
paid out in exchange for gold. This is an
-obvious duty. If the holder of the United
'States notes prefers the gold and gets it
from the government, he .should not re-
i^ ceive back from the government a United
States note without paying gold in ex
change for it. The reason for this is
made all the more apparent when the
government issues an interest bearing
-debt to provide gold for the redemption of
United States notesa non-interest bear-
[|j-]ing debt. Surely it should not pay them
|Ki$t*u again except on demand for gold. If
V^-they are put out in any other way, they
may return again to be followed by an
other bond issue to redeem, themanother
interest bearing debt to redeem a non-in
terest bearing debt.
Stop the Drain.
In my view, it is of the utmost impor
tance that the government should be re
lieved from the burden of providing all
the gold required for exchange and ex
port. This responsibility is alone borne by
the government, without any of the usual
and necessary banking powers to help
itself. The banks do not feel the strain of
gold redemption. The whole strain rests
upon the government, and the size of the
gold reserve in the treasury has come to
be. with or without reason, the signal of
danger or of security. This ought to be
stopped.
If we are to have an era of prosperity
in the country, with sufficient receipts for
the expenses of the government, we may
feel no immediate embarrassment from
our present curx'ency, but the danger still
exists "and will be ever present menacing
us so long as the existing system contin
ues. And besides, it is in times of ade
quate revenues and business tranquility
that the government should prepare for
the worst. We cannot avoid, without se
rious consequences, the wise consideration
and prompt solution of this question.
The secretary of the treasury has out
lined a plan in great detail for the pur
pose of removing the threatened recur
rence of a depleted gold reserve and save
us from future embarrassment on that
account. To this plan I invite your care
ful consideration.
I concur with the secretary of the treas
ury in his recommendation that na
tional banks be allowed to issue notes to
the face value of the bonds which they
have deposited for circulation, and that
the tax on circulating notes secured by
deposit of such bonds be reduced to one
half of 1 per cent per annum. I also join
him in recommending that authority be
given for the establishment of national
banks with a minimum capital of $25,000.
This will enable the smaller villages and
agricultural regions of the country to be
supplied with currency to meet their
needs.
I recommend that the issue of national
bank notes be restricted to the denomi
nation of $10 and upwards. If the sugges
tions I have herein made shall have the
approval of congress, then I would recom
mend that national banks be required to
redeem the notes in gold.
GIVE SPAIN A CHANCE.
RenMonuhle Time for the Enforce
ment of Autonomy Is Urged.
The most important problem with which
the government is now called upon to
deal pertaining to its foreign relations
concerns its duty toward Spain and the
Cuban insurrection, problems and condi
tions more or less in common with those
now existing have confronted this govern
ment at various times in the past. The
story of Cuba for many years has been
one of unrest and growing discontent
an effort toward a larger enjoyment of
liberty and self-control of organized re
sistance to the mother country of de
pression after distress and warfare, and
of ineffectual settlements to be followed
by renewed revolt. For no enduring pe
riod since the enfranchisement of the con
tinental possessions of Spain in the West
ern continent has the condition of Cuba
or the policy of Spain toward Cuba not
caused concern in the United States.
The prospect from time to time that the
weakness of Spain's hold upon the island
and the political vicissitudes and em
barrassments of the home government
might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a
continental power called forth, between*
1823 and I860, various emphatic declara
tions of the policy of the United States
to peimit no disturbance of Cuba's con
nection with Spain unless in the direction
of independence or acquisition by the
United States througn purchase nor has
there been any change of this declared
policy since upon the part of the govern
ment.
The revolution which began in 1868 lasted
for ten years despite the strenuous efforts
of the successive peninsular governments
to suppress it. Then, as now, the govern
ment of the United States testified its
grave concern and offered its aid to put
an end to bloodshed in Cuba. The
overtures made by Gen. Grant were re
fused and the war dragged on, entailing
great loss of life and treasure and in
creased injurj to American interests, be
sides throwing enhanced burdens on
neutrality on the government. In 1878
peace was brought about by the truce
of Zanjon, obtained by negotiations be
tween the Spanish commander. Martinez
de Campos, and the insurgent leaders.
The present insurrection broke out in
February, 1895. It is not my purpose at
this time to recall its remarkable increase
or to characterize its tenacious resistance
against the enormous force massed
against it by Spain. The revolt and the
ettorts to subdue it carried destruction
to every quarter of the island, developing
v/ide proportions and defying the eftorts
of Spam for its suppression. The civilized
code of war has been disregarded, no
less so by the, Spaniards than by the
Cubans.
The existing conditions cannot but fill
this government and the American peo
ple with gravest apprehension. There is
no desire on the part of the people to
profit by the misf01 tunes ot Spain. We
have only the desire to see the Cubans
prosperous and contented, enjoying that
meat-ure of self-control which is the in
aliable right of man protected in their
right to reap the benefit of the exhaust
less treasures of their country.
Vigorous Protests.
The offer made by my predecessor in
April, 1896, tendering the friendly offices
of this government failed. Any media
tion on our part was not accepted. In
brief the answer was: "There is mo
effectual way to pacify Cuba, unless
it begins with the actual -submission
of the rebels to the mother country."
Then only could Spain act in the prom
ised direction of her own motion and
after her own plan. The cruel policy of
concentration was initiated Feb. 16, 1896.
The districts controlled by the Spanish
armies were depopulated. The agricultur
al inhabitants were herded in and about
the garrison towns, their lands laid waste
and their dwellings destroyed. This pol
icy the late cabinet of Spain justified as
a necessary measure of war and as a
means of cutting off supplies from the in
surgents. It has utterly failed as a war
measure. J.t- was not civilized warfare.
It was ext/rmination.
Against this abuse of rights of war I
have felt constrained on repeated occa
sions to enter the firm and earnest pro
test of this government. There was much
of public condemnation of the treatment
of American citizens by alleged illegal
arrests and long imprisonment awaiting
trial or pending protracted judicial pro
ceedings. I felt it my first duty to make
instant demand for the release or speedy
trial of all American citizens under ar
rest. Before the change of the Spanish
cabinet in October last twenty-two pris
oners, citizens of the United States, had
been given their freedom. For the relief
of our own citizens suffering because of
the conflict the aid of congress was
sought in a special message and un,der
the appropriation of April 4. 1897, effect
ive aid has been given to American citi
zens in Cuba, many of them at their own
request having been returned to the
United States.
The instructions given to our new min
ister to Spain before this departure for his
post directed him to impress it upon that
government the sincere wish of the
United States to lend its aid toward the
ending of the war in Cuba by reaching
a peaceful and lasting result just and
honorable alike to Spain and to the "Cu-
ban people. These instructions recited the
character and duration of the contest, the
widespread losses it entails, the burdens
and restraints it imposes upon us, with
constant disturbance of national interests
and the injury resulting from an indefi
nite continuance of this state of things.
It was stated that at this juncture our
government was constrained to strenu
ously inquire if the time was not ripe
when Spain of her own volition, moved
by her own interests and every sentiment
of humanity, should put a stop to this
destructive war and make proposals o.f
settlement honorable to herself and just
to her Cuban colony. It was urged that
we as a neighboring nation with large
interests in Cuba could be required to
wait only a reasonable time for the
mother country 'to establish its authority
and restore order within the borders of
the island, that we could not contemplate
as indefinite period for the accomplish
ment of this result.
Embarrnsment Avoided.
No solution was proposed to which 'the
slightest idea of humiliation to Spain
could attach, and, indeed, precise pro
posals were withheld to avoid embarras
ment to that government. All that was
asked or expected was that some safe
way might be speedily provided and per
manent peace restored. It so chanced
that the cpnsideration of this offer, ad
dressed to the same Spanish administra-
tion which had declined the tenders of
my predecessor, and which for more than
two years had poured men and treasore
Into Cuba in the fruitless effort to 'sup
press the revolt, fell to others. Between
the departure of Gen. Woodford, the new
envoy, and his arrival in Spain, the
statesman who has shaped the policy of
his country, fell by the hand of an as
sassin, and, although the cabinet of the
late premier still held office and received
from our envoy the proposals he bore,
the cabinet gave place within a few days
thereafter to a new administration under
the leadershin of Sagasta.
Spain's Reply.
The reply to our note was received on
the 23d day of October. It is in the direc
tion of a better understanding. It appre
ciates the friendly proposals of this gov
ernment. It admits that our country is
deeply affected by the war in Cuba, ana
that its desires for peace are just. It de
clares that the present Spanish govern
ment is bound by every consideration to
a change of policy that should satisfy the
United States and pacify Cuba within a
'reasonable time. To this end Spain has
decided to put into effect the political re
forms heretofore advocated by the pres
ent premier, without halting for any con
sideration in the path which in its judg
ment leads to peace. The military
preparations will continue, it is said, but
will be humane, and will be conducted
with all regard for private rights, being
accompanied by political action leading
to the autonomy of Cuba, while guarding
Spanish sovereignty. This, it- is claimed,
will result in investing Cuba with a dis
tinct personality the island to be gov
erned by an executive and by a local
council or chamber, reserving to Spain
the control of the foreign relations, the
army and navy, and the judicial adminis
tration. To accomplish this the present
government proposes to modify existing
legislation by decree, leaving the Spanish
cortes with the aid of Cuban senators
and deputies to solve the economic prob
lem and properly distribute the existing
debt. In the absence of a declaration of
the measures that this government pro
poses to take in carrying out its tfroffer
of good offices it suggests that Spain be
left free to conduct military ^operations
and grant political reforms, while the
United States for its part shall enforce its
neutral obligations and cut off the as
sistance which, it is asserted, the in
surgents receive from this country. The
supposition ot an indefinite prolongation
of the war is denied. It is asserted that
the western provinces are already well
nigh reclaimed that the planting of
cane and tobacco therein has been re
sumed, and that by force of arms and
new and ample reforms very early and
complete pacification is hoped for.
The immediate amelioration of existing
conditions under the new administration
of Cuban affairs is predicted and there
withal the disturbance and all occasion
for any change of attitude on the part of
the United States. Discussion of this ques
tion of the international iuties and re
sponsibilities of the United States as
Spiin understands them is presented with
an apparent disposition to charge us with
failure in this regard. This charge is
without any basis in fact. It could not
have been made if Spain had been cog
nizant of the constant efforts this govern
ment has made at the cost of millions and
by the employment of the administrative
machinery of the nation at command to
perform its full duty according to the law
of nations. That it has successfully pre
vented the departure of a single military
expedition or armed vessel from our
shores in violation if our laws would
seem to be a sufficient answer. But ot
this aspect of the Spanish note it is not
necessary to speak further now. Firm in
the conviction of a wholly perform 3d ob
ligation due response to this charge has
been made in diplomatic course.
Rational Compromise.
Throughout alt these horrors and dan
gers to our own peace this government
has never broken, even in any way abro
gated its sovereign prerogatives of reserv
ing to itself the determination of its pol
icy and course according to its own high
sense of right and in consequence with
the dearest interests and convictions of
our cwn people should the prolongation
of ths strife so demand.
Of the untried measures there remain
only: Recognition of the insurgents as
belligerents, recognition of the independ
ence of Cuba, neutral intervention^ to end
the war by imposing a rational compro
mise between the contestants and inter
vention in favor of one or the other pa*rty.
I speak not of forcible annexation, for
that cannot be thought of. That by our
code of morality would be criminal ag
gression.
Recognition of the belligerency of
the Cuban insurgents has oten been
canvassed as the possible if not in
evitable step both in regard to the pre
vious ten years' struggle and durine? the
present war. I am not unmindful that
the two houses of congress in the --pring
of 189b expressed the opinion by concur
lent resolution that a condition of public
war existed requiring or justifying the
recognition of the state of belligerency in
Cuba, and during the extra session the
.senate voted a joint resolution of like m.
port, which, however, was not brought to
a vote in the house ot the representatives
In the presence of the significant expres
sions of the legislative branch, it behooves
the executive to soberly consider the con
ditions under which such an important
measure must needs rest for justification
It is to be seriously considered whether
the Cuban insurrection possesses beyond
dispute the Attributes of statehood which
alone can demand the recognition of bel
ligerency in its favor. Possession, in short,
of the essential qualifications of sover
eignty by the insurgents and the conduct
of the war by them according to the re
served code of war are no less important
factors toward the determination of the
problem of belligerency than are the in
fluences and consequences of the struggle
upon the international policy of the rec
ognizing state.
The utterances of President Grant in his
memorable message of Dec. 7, 1875, are
signally relevant to the present situation
in Cuba and it may be wholesome now to
recall them. At that time a ruinous con
flict had for seven years wasted the neigh
boring island. During all those years an
utter disregard of the laws of civilized
warfare and of the just demands of hu
manity, which called forth expressions of
condemnation from the nations of Chris
tendom continued unabated. Desolation
and ruin pervaded that productive region,
enormously affecting the commerce of all
commercial nations, but that of the United
States more than any other by reason of
proximity and larger trade and inter
course. At that juncture Grant uttered
these woids, which now, as then, sum up
the elements of the problem:
Recognition Impracticable.
A recognition of the independence of
Cuba being, in my opinion, impracticable
and indefensible, the question which next
presents itself is that of the recognition
of belligerent rights in the parties to the
contest. In a former message to con
gress I had occasion to consider this
question, and reached the conclusion that
the conflict in Cuba, dreadful and devas
tating as were its incidents, did not rise
to the fearful dignity of war. It is pos
sible that the act of foreign powers, and
even acts of Spain herself, of this very
nature might be pointed to in defense
of such recognition. But now. as in past
history, the United States should care
fully avoid the false rights which might
lead it into the masses of doubtful law
and of questionable propriety, and ad
here rigidly and sternly to the rule which
has been its guide, of doing only that
which is right and 'honest and of good
report. The question of according or of
withholding rights of belligerency must
be judged in every case iin view of the
particular attending facts. Unless justi
fied by necessity it is always and justly
regarded as an unfriendly act and a
gratuitous demonstration of moral sup
port to the rebellion. It |s necessary and
it is required when the interests and
rights of another government of its peo
ple are so far affected by a pending civil
conflict as to require a definition of its
relations to the parties thereto. But this
conflict must be one which is recognized
in the sense of international law as war."
Belligerency, too, is a factor. The mere
existence of contending armed bodies and
their occasion conflicts does not constitute
war in the sense referred to. Applying
to the existing conditions of affairs in
Cuba the tests recognized by publicists
and writers on international law, and
which have been observed by nations of
d{gnity, honesty and power, who free
from sensitive or selfish and unworthy
motives, I fail to find in the insurrection
the existence of such a substantial po
litical organization, real, palpable and
manifest to the world, having the forms
and capable of thejirdmary functions of
government towarda its own neople and
to other,states with courts for the ad
ministration of justice with a local habi
tation, possessing such organization of
force, such material,, ^ueh occupation,of
territory, as to take the contest out of the
category of a nv
tion or occasional skirmishes and place it
oa the terrible footing of war, to which tion arising between the different munici
a recosrhltion of belligerency
Would Aim to Elevate It.
The contest, moreover, is solely on land
the insurrection has not possessed itself
of a single seaport, whence it may send
forth its flag nor has it any means of
communication with foreign powers, ex
cept through the military lines of its ad
versaries. No apprehension of any of
those sudden and difficult complications
which a war upon the ocean is apt to pre
cipitate upon the vessels, both commercial
and national, and upon the consular offi
cers of other powers, calls for the defini
tion of their relations to the parties to
the contest. Considered as a question of
expediency, I regard the accordance of
belligerent rights still to be as unwise and
premature, as I regard to be, at present,
indefensible in a measure of right.
Such recognition entafls upon the coun
try according the rights which flow from
it difficult and complicated duties and re
quire the exaction from the contending
parties of the strict observance of their
rights and obligations. It confers the
right of search upon the high seas by
vessels of both parties it would subject
the carrying of arms and munitions of
war, which now may be transported free
ly and without interruption, in vessels of
the United States to detention and to
possible seizure it would give rise to
countless vexations questions would re
lease the parent government from re
sponsibility for acts done by the insurg
ents, and would invest Spain with the
right to exercise the supervision recog
nized by our treaty of 1795 over our com
merce on the seas, a very large part of
which in its traffic between the Atlantic
and the Gulf States and between all of
them and the states on the Pacific,
passes through the waters which wash
the shores of Cuba. The existence of this
supervision could scarce fail to lead, if
not to abuses, certainly to collisions per
ilous to the peaceful relations of the two
states. There can be little doubt as to
what result supervision would before long
draw this nation. It would be unworthy
of the United States to inaugurate the
possibilities of such result by measures
of questionable right or expediency or by
any indirection."
Turning to the practical aspects of a
recognition of beligerancy, and reviewing
its inconveniences and positive dangers,
still further pertinent considerations ap
pear. In the code of nations there is no
such thing as a naked recognition of
belligerancy unaccompanied by the as
sumption of
International Neutrality.
Such recognition without more will
not confer uaon either oarty to
a domestic conflict a status not
theretofore actually possessed or af
fect the relation of either party to other
states. The act of recognition usually
takes the form of solemn proclamation of
neutrality which recites the de facto con
dition of belligerancy as its motive. It
announces a domestic law on neutrality
in the declaring state. It assumes inter
national obligations of a neutral in the
presence of a public state of war. It
warns all citizens and others within the
jurisdiction of the proclaimant that they
violate those righteous obligations at
their own peril and cannot expect to be
shielded from the consequence. The
right of visit and search on the seas and
seizure of vessels and cargos and contra
band of war and good prize under admir
alty law must under international law be
admitted as a legitimate consequence of a
proclamation of belligerancy. While ac
cording the equal belligerant rights de
fined by public law to each party in our
ports disfavors would- be imposed on
both, which, while nominally equal would
weigh heavily in behalf of Spam herself.
Possessing a navy and controlling the
ports of Cuba, her maratime rights could
be asserted not only for the military in
vestment of the island, but up to the
margin of our own territorial waters,
and a condition of things would exist for
which the Cubans within their own do
main could not hope to create a parallel
while its creation through the aid or sym
pathy from within our domain would be
even more impossible than now with the
additional oblibations of international
neutrality we would perforce assume.
The enforcement of this enlarged and
onerous code of neutrality would only be
influential within our jurisdiction by land
and sea, and applicable by our own
instrumentalities, it could impart to the
United States no jurisdiction between
Spain and the insurgents. It would give
the United States no right of intervention
to enforce the conduct of the strife within
the paramount authority of Spain accord
ing to the international code of war. For
these reasons, I regard the recognition of
the belligerency ot the Cuban insurgents
a now unwise and, therefore, inadmissi
ble. Should that step hereafter be
deemed wise as a measure of right and
duty the executive will take it.
Intervention upon
Humanitarian Grounds
has been frequently suggested and has
not failed to receive my most a,uxious
and earnest consideration. But should
such a step be now taken when it is ap
parent that a hopeful change has super
vened in the policy of Spain toward Cuba?
A new government has taken office in
the mother country. It is pledeged in ad
vance to the declaration that all the
effort in the world cannjt suffice to main
tain peace in Cuba by the bayonet that
vague promisee of reform after subjuga
tion afford no solution of the insular
problem that with a substitution of
commanders must come a change of the
past system of warfare for one in har
mony with a new policy which shall no
longer aim to drive the Cubans to the
"horrible alternative of taking to the
thicket or succumbing in misery that
reforms must be instituted in accordance
with the needs and circumstances of the
time and that these refor.nS, while de
signed to give full autonomy to the col
ony and create a virtual entity and self
controlled administration, shall yet con
serve and affirm the sovereignty of Spain
by a distribution of powers and burdens
upon a basis of mutual interest untainted
bv methods of selfish expediency.
The first acts of the new government
lie in these honorable paths. The policy
of cruel rapine and extermination^ that
so long shocked the universal sentiment
of humanity has been reversed. Under
the new military commander a broad
clemency is proffered. Measures have
alread% been set on foot to relieve the
horrors of starvation. The pow^r of the
Spanish armies it is asserted is to be
us-d not to spread ruin and desolation
but to protect the resumption of peaceful
agr cultural pursuits and productive in
dustries. That past methods are futile

ters of state, war and the navy, as to
which the governor general acts by his

dive Spain a Cbance.
That the govern tnent of Sagasta has en
tered upon a course from which recession
with honor is impossible, can hardly be
questioned that in the few weeks it has
existed it has made earnest of the sincer
ity of its professions is undeniable. I
shall not impugn its sincerity, nor should
impatience be suffered to embarrass it in
the task it has undertaken. It is honest
ly due to Spain and to our friendly rela
tions with Spain, that she should be given
a reasonable chance to realize her expec
tations and to prove the asserted effi
ciency of the new order things- to which
she stands irrevocably committed. She
has recalled the commander whose brutal
orders inflamed the American mind' and
shocked the civilized world. She has mod
ified the horrible order of concentration,
and has undertaken to care for the help
less and permit those who desire to re
sume the cultivation of their fields to do
so, and assures them the protection of the
Spanish government in their lawful occu
pations. She has just released the Com
petitor prisoners, heretofore sentenced to
death, and whi have been the subject o
repeated diplomatic correspondence dur
ing this and the preceding administra
tion. Not a single American citizen is
now in arrest .or' confinement in Cuba of
whom this government has any knowl
edge.
The near future would demonstrate
whether the indispensable condition of a
righteous peace, just alike to the Cubans
and to Spain, as well as equitable to all
our interests so intimately involved in the
welfare of Cuba, is likely to be attained.
If not, the exigency of further and other
action by the United States will remain
to be taken. When that time comes that
action will be determined in the line of
indisputable right and duty. It will be
faced without misgiving or hesitating in
the light of the obligation this govern-,
ment owes to itself, to the people who
have confided to it the protection of their
interests and honor, and to humanity.
Sure of the right, keeping free from all
offense ourselves, acting only from up
right and patriotic considerations, moved
neither by passion nor selfishness, the
government will continue its watchful
care over the rights and property of
American citizens, and will abate none of
its efforts to bring about by peaceful
agencies a peace which shall be honora
ble and enduring. If it shall hereafter
appear to be a duty imposed by our obli
gations to ourselves, to civilization and
to humanity to intervene with torce, it
shall be without fault on our part, and
only because the necessity for such action
will be so clear as to command the sup
port and approval of the civilized world.
AN1VEX HAWAII.
Tnis Is Strongly Urged by President
McKinley.
By a special mesbage, dated the 16th of
June last, I laid before the senate a treaty
signed that day by the plenipotentiaries of
the United States and of the Republic of
Hawaii, having for its purpose the incor
poration of the Hawaiian islands as an
integral part of the United States and
under its sovereignty. The senate having
removed the injunction of secrecy, al
though the treaty is still pending before
that body, the subject may be properly
referred to in this message, because the
necessary action of the congress is re
quired to determine by legislation many
details of the eventual union should the
fact of annexation be accomplished, as I
believe it should be.
While consistently disavowing from a
very early period any aggressive policy
of absorption in regard to the Hawaiian
group, a" long series of declarations
through three-quarters of a century has
proclaimed the vital interest of the Unite'd
States in the independent life of the isl
ands and their intimate commercial de
pendence upon this country. At the same
time it has been repeatedly asserted that
in no event could the entity of Hawaiian
statehood cease by the passage of the
islands under the domination or influence
of another power than the United States.
Under these circumstances the logic of
events required tnat annexation, hereto
fore offered, but declined, should in the
ripeness of time come about as the nat
ural result of the strengthening ties that
bind us to those islands, and be realized
by the free will of the Hawaiian state.
That treaty was unanimously ratified
without amendment bv the senate and
president of the republic of Hawaii on
on the 10th of September last, and only
awaits the favorable action of the Amer
ican senate to effect the complete absorp
tion of the islands into the domain of
the United States. What the conditions
of such a union shall be, the political
relation thereof to the United States, the
character of the local administration,
the quality and degree of the elective
franchise of the inhabitants, the exten
sion of the federal laws to the territory,
or the enactment of .special laws to fit
the peculiar condition thereof, the regula
tion, if need be, of the labor svkJm
therein, are all matters which the treaty
has wifely relegated to congress.
If the treaty is confirmed as every con
sideration of dignity and honor requires,
the wisdom of congress will see to it,
avoiding abrupt assimilation of elements
perhaps hardly yet fitted to share in the
highest franchises of citizenship and hav
ing due regard to the geographical condi
tions, the most just provisions for self
rule in local matters with the largest
political liberties as an integral part of
our nation will be accorded to the
Hawaiians. No less is due to a people,
who. after nearly five years of demon
strated capacity to fulfil the obligations
of self-governing statehood come of their
own free will to merge their destinies in
our body politic.
The questions which have arisen be
tween Japan and Hawaii by reason of
the treatment of Japanese laborers em
igrating to the islands under the
Hawaiian-Japanese convention of 1888 are
in a satisfactory stage of settlement by
negotiation. This government has not
been invited to mediate and on the other
ha id has sought no intervention in that
matter further than to evince its kind
liest disposition toward such a speedy
and direct adjustment by the two sov
ereign states in interest as shall com
port with equity and honor. It is gratify
ing to learn that the apprehensions at
first displayed on the part of Japan lest
the cessation of Hawaii national life
through annexation might impair priv
ileges to which Japan honorably laid
claim have given place to confidence in
the uprightness of this government and
in the sincerity of its purpose to deal
with all possible ulterior questions in the
broadest spirit of friendliness.

IX CENTRAL AMERICA.
Sicarngva Canal and Some Diplo
matic Complications.
As to the representations of this gov
ernment to Nicaragua, Salvador and
Costa Rica, I have concluded that Mr.
William Li. Merry, confirmed as minister
of the United States to the states -of
Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Salvador,
shall proceed to San Jose, Costa Rica,
and there temporarily establish the head
quarters of the United States to those
three states. I took this action for what
I regarded as the panKhount interests
of this country. It was developed upon
an investigation by the secretary of state
that the government of Nicaragua, while
not unwilling to' receive Mr. Merry in
his diplomatic quality, was unable to do
so because of the compact concluded June
20, 1895, whereby that republic and those
of Salvador and Honduras, forming what
is known as the Greater Republic of Cen
tral America, had surrendered to the rep
resentative diet their right to receive
and send diplomatic agents. The diet was
not willing to accept him, because he
was not accredited to that boay. I could
not accredit him to that body because
the appropriation law of congress did
not permit it. Mr. Baker, the present
minister to Managua, has been directed
to present his letters of recall.
Mr. Godfrey Hunter has likewise been
accredited to the governments of Guate
mala and Honduras, the same as his pre
decessor. Guatemala is not a member of
the greater Republic of Central America,
but Honduras is. Should this latter gov
ernment decline to receive him he has
been instructed to report this fact to his
government and await its further in
structions.
A subject ot large importance to our
country and increasing appreciation on
the part of the people is the completion
of the great highway of trade between
the Atlantic and Pacific known as the
Nicaraguan canal. Its -utility and value
to American commerce is universally ad
mitted. The commission appointed under
date of July 24 last, "to continue the
1- *&?
act approved March 2, 1895" in regard txr
"the proper route, feasibility, and cost
of construction of the Nicaragua canal,
with a view of making complete plans
for the entire work of construction of
such canal" is now employed in the
undertaking. In the future I shall take
occasion to transmit to congress the re
port of this commission, making at the
same time such further suggestions as
may then seem advisable.
INTERNATIONAiTlBiMETAMilSM.
The President Hopes to Seeare F
erable Actio,
Under the provisions of the act of con
gress approved March 3, 1897. for the pro
motion of an international agreement re^
spectlng bimetallism, I appointed ei the
14th day of April, 1897, Hon. Edward O. 33
Wolcott of Colorado Hon. AdtlaA E
Stevenson of Illinois, and Hon. Charles J. 'Jjj
Paine of Massachusetts, as special eJSBvoys
to represent the United States-. They .*J
have been diligent in their efforts- to se
cure the co-operation of European coun- 4.
tries in the international settlement of the -j
question, but up to this time have not
been able to secure an agreement eon
templated by their mission.
The gratifying action of our grea* sister
republic of France in joining this, country
in the attempt to bring about am agree
ment among the principal commercial na
tions of Europe whereby a fixed and rela
tive value between gold and silver shall
be secured furnishes assurance that we
are not alone among the larger nations
of the world in realizing the international
character of the problem, and in the de
sire of reaching some wise and practical
solution of it. The British government
has published a resume of the steps taken
jointly by the French ambassador in
London and the special envoys of the
United States, with whom our ambas
sador at London actively co-operated in
the presentation of this subject to her
majesty's government. This will be laid
before congress. Our special envoys have
not made their final report, as further
negotiations between the representa
tives of this government and the
governments of other countries are
pending and contemplation. They be
lieve that doubts which have been
raised in certain quarters respecting the
position of maintaining the stability of
the parity between the metals and kin
dred questions may yet be solved by fur
ther negotiations.
Meanwhile, it gives me satisfaction to
state that the special envoys have already
demonstrated their ability and fitness to
deal with the subject, and it is to be
hoped that their labors may result in an
international agreement which will bring
about recognition of both gold and silver
as money upon such terms and with such
safeguards as will secure the use of both
metals upon a basis which shall work no
injury to any class of our citizens.
Reciprocity Negotiations.
Mr. Kasson ot Iowa is said to be now
conducting negotiations with several gov
ernments for reciprocity arrangements
under the tariff act, and it is believed
that by a careful exercise of the powers
conferred by the act, some grievance of
our own and other countries in our mu
tual trade relations may be i-emoved or
alleviated, and the volume of our com
mercial exchanges enlarged.
The president earnestly u-ges the im
provement of our merchant manne, the
inferiority of which, ",e sa^s, is htmiliat
ing to the national ri*ide
Reference is made to -he reeent confer
ences at Washington on the ?ubject of
protection of seal hfe, the ro=jlt .f which
place beyond controversy, ic is said the
duty of the government's concern to
adopt measures without delay for the
protection of the herds. Negotiations to
this end are now in progress.
International arbitration is declared by
the president to represent the best sen
timent of the civilized world, t'lid treat
ies embodying these humane principles
on broad lines without in -iny war im
periling our interests or honor will have
its constant encouragement.
A liberal appropriation is bespoken in
order that the United States may make
a creditable exhibit at the approaching
Paris exposition in which the people have
shown an unprecedented interest.
Under the head of the navy, the presi
dent points to the riKses-sity for speedy
legislation to procure he mpor tor trree
battleships now building, wn-n v^ould be
otherwise useless. He speaks in terms or
praise of the quality of our ships, and
thinks that the time h-is now arrived
when the increase to which the courtry is
committed should for a lime take the
form of increased facilities commer.sur
at with the increase of our naval ves
sels. He refers to the 'ack ...f docks and
urges that three or four t! lu=e
locks be provided on the Atlintic, rnd at
least one on tlie Pacine wist and a
floaAivn'- r'.rok in 111" mil'"
Enlargement of the Navy.
There snooia also bo ample provision
for munitions i war and an increase of
officers and enlisted men. Additions are
also nenesbdry to naw yards, and, as
the^e are now on the stocks five large
battleships, it is recommended that an
appropriation be made but for one more
battleship on the Pacific coast. Several
torpedo boats arc also necessary.
Attention is called to the need for
prompt legislation as to Alaska and the
extension of civil authority within the
territory. Thtre is need for surveys and
for the estaoiisoment of another land
office at some point in the Yukon valley
for which an appropriation is asked. Mil
itar- torce is also ne^essa-ry. and the es
tablishment of some sort of flexible gov
ernment. If the startling reports as to the
Erobable shortage of food for the miners
fully verified, every effort should be
made, at any cost, to carry them relief.
The, message deals at some length witb,
the unsatisfactory condition of affairs in.
the Indian Territory. The large white
element is said to be without protection
and without schools or other rights of
citizens leading Indians have absorbed
great tracts of lands and created an
aristocracy, and the friends of the In
dians believe that the best interests of
the five civilized^tribes would found
in American citizenship. Reference is
made to the failure, so far, of the Dawes
commission to secure the consent of the
tribes to an extinguishment of the tribal
titles and a division of the lands. It is
said that should the tribes still fail to
ratify the agreement, then some legisla
tion should be had by congress.
The president approves the recommen
dation of the secretary of the treasury
for an extension of the quarantine laws,
and also suggests the appointment of a
special commission to ascertain the cause
of yellow fever
Sale of the Kansas Pacific.
Speaking of the pending sale of the
Kansas Pacific railroad, it is said that if
no better bid is received than the upset
price fixed by the court, the government
would receive only $2,500,000 on its claim
of nearly $13,000,000. He believes that the
government has the authority to bid i
on the road and has directed the sec- -3
retarv of the treasury to make the &
deposit of $900,000 required to qualify
as a bidder, and to bid at the sale a sum.
at least equal to the principal of the debt
to the government. He suggests, how
ever, that in a matter so Important aa*|
the government becoming a possible own
er of the railroad, congress should enact
some legislation to define its views. It
is clear to him, however, that the govern
ment should not permit the property to
be sold at a price less than one-half the
principal of its debt, and less than one
fifth of its entire debt, principal and inter
est.
The president devotes the last chapter
of his message to the civil service, the
practical improvement of which he says
has long been a subject of earnest dis
cussion and which has of late years' re
ceived increased legislative and executive
approval. During the past few month*
the service his been placed upon a still
firmer bt sis of business methods and per
sonal merit. While the right of deserving
veteran soldiers to reinstatement has
been asserted, dismissals for merely po
litical reasons have been carefully guard
ed against the examinations improved,
and made practical and a distinct ad
vance has be-sn made by giving a hearing
before dismissal upon all cases where
incon etency is charged or demand made
for the removal of officials. This last
has been done without impairing the
power of removal, one of the vital safe
guards of the system. Much remains to
be done before the system can be per--2
fected, and the president says that he
shall not hesitate to exempt cases which.
he thinks,have been improperly included.,
in the classified service or include those
which in his judgment will best promote
the public service. The system has the
approval 0/ the people and it whl be his
endea\ or to uphold and extei it.
In conclusion the president admonishes
congress not to encourage the increase
