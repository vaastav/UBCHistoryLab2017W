IWOSEVELrS TIU1WTC TO LAUUlt,
Tho American Federation of Labor
throiiRh Its nntlonnl convention 1ms ex
tended n votu of thnnks to President
Hoosovelt for his reconimendntlon em
bodied In his message to congress urg
ing the early re-ouuctnient of the Chi
nese exclusion act. lit view of tho In
tense Interest manifested by American
worklngmeu lu the continued exclusion
of Chinese lunnlcratits. this token of.i
appreciation of tho stand taken In be
half of American labor by President
Hoosovelt was but natural. ,
It Is passing strange, however, that
this greatest representative body of
skilled mechanics should linve seem
ingly Ignored tho splendid tribute which
tho president has paid to American
worklngmeu and the courageous plea
on their behalf for the concession of
every rational demand mndo by organ
ized labor. No other' president has
been so outspoken In discussing the
rights and wrongs of wage-workers nnd
no other president has ever ventured to
champion tho cause of the tollers lu
mine, mill or factory.
First nnd foremost President Roose
velt's message takes positive ground In
the right of worklugmcn to organize
for mutual protection and the promo
tion of their mutual welfare. Recog
nizing the difference between the stand
ards of living of American and foreign
worklngmeu, tho president Insists that
"evory effort of legislator nnd adminis
trator should be bent to secure the per
manency of the present prosperous con
ditions. Not only must our labor be
protected by the tariff, but It should
also be protected as far as possible
from tho presence In this country of any
laborers brought over by contract."
The president, however, does not stop
with this declaration against contract
labor, but also couples his recommen
dation with the demand thnt the pro
ducts of convict labor bo as far
as possible excluded from competition
with tho products of free labor through
congressional legislation.
For many years organized labor has
endeavored to bring about n uniform
eight-hour working day, but up to this
time congress has gone only so far as
to establish tho eight-hour day for men
and women on the payroll of the gov
ernment Repeated efforts to lnduco
former presidents to recommend the ex-
f0,,H,, f n. ,.ll.f.i... ..,i, ,i..

works had been unsuccessful. The ac
tion of President Roosevelt in incorpo
rating Into his message a recommenda
tion for such legislation entitles him
to the gratitude not only of members of
trades uulous represented lu the Fed
oration of Labor, but also of working
men of every class.
Tho concluding portion of the mcs
sago relating to tho lnbor problem
should Impress Itself Indelibly upon tho
mind of every brcndwlnuer In America
American wago-workers work with their
heads as well as tbclr hands. Moreover.
they tako a keen prldo la what they uro
doing; bo that, Independent of tho reward,
thoy wish to turn out a perfect Job. This
is tue great secret of our success In com'
petition with tho labor of foreign countries,
Tho most vital problem with which this
country, and for that matter the wholo
civilized world, boa to deal, is the problem
which has for ono sido the betterment of
social conditions, moral and physical, In
largo cities, and for another sldo tho effort
to deal with that tangle of far-reaching
questions which wo group together when
wo speak of "labor." Tho chief factor In
tho success of each man wage-worker,
farmer und capitalist alike must ever ibo
tho sura total of his own Individual quali
ties and abilities, Second only to this
comes tho power of acting in combination
or association with others. Very great
good has been and will be accomplished by
associations or unions of wage-workers,
when mauaged with forethought, and when
they combine Insistence upon their own
rights with law-abiding respect for tha
rights of others. Tho display of tlicso
qualities In such bodies Is a duty to the
nation no less than to the associations
themselves. Finally, there must also in
many cases bo action by tho government In
order to safeguard tho rights and Interests
of all. Under our constitution thero Is
much mora scopo for such action by tho
state and tho municipality than by the na
tion. Hut on points such as thoso touched
on above tuo national government can act
when all is said and done, the rulo of
brotherhood remains as tho Indlspensablo
prerequisite to success In tho kind of na
tional life tor which wo strive. Each roan
must work for himself, and unless he so
works no outsldo help can avail hlra; but
each man must romembcr also that bo Is
Indeed his brother's keeper, and that whllo
no man who refuses to walk can be carried
with ndvantngo to himself or anyone clso,
yet that each at times stumbles or halts
that each at times needs to havo tho help
Ing hand outstretched to him. To be
permanently effective aid must always tako
tho form of helping a man to holp himself.
and wo can all best help ourselves by
Joining together In the work that Is of
common Interest to all
VOIWSTS AND UilllUATlON.
In his annual report the secretary of
tho Interior said that water conservation
cannot bo successfully maintained with'
out a thorough system of forest protec
tlou and he urged that to give to tho
people of tho west tho full beneilts
which tho forest reserves arc capable
of yielding two things nro necessary
Tho demand for more reserves should
be met by the careful extension of tho
reserved area In accordance with tho
results of careful study ou the grouud
and thero should bo n thoroughly prac
tlcal and cfllclent administration of the
reserves und tho resources they contain,
Tho secretary expressed tho oplulon
that the time for tho Introduction of
practical forestry on tho forest reserves
has fully como and said: "Tho utility
of tho reserves to tho agricultural, uiln
lug, grazing ami lumber Interests of tho
regions lu which they llo Is so great, so
generally recognized and so rapidly ou
tho Increase, that to give them any form
of management but tho best available
Is a most serious blow to the prosperity
of tho west."
this matter received lu tno president s
message tho attention which Its linpor
tuuco merits, being more thoroughly con
is hie red than In the report of the secrc
tnry of tho Ulterior. Tho president said
that forest protection Is not an end o
Itself; It Is a menus to Increase nud sus
tain tho resources of our country and
tho Industries which depend upon them
"Tho preservation of our forests Is an
Imperative business necessity. Wo hay
como to see clearly that whatever de
stroys the forest, except to make way
for agriculture, threatens our well-being."
He said that the forests are nnt-
ural reservoirs. Hy restraining the
streams lu Hood and replenishing them
In drouth they make possible the tine of
waters otherwise wasted. "Forest con
servation Is therefore an essential con
dition of water conservation." In the
pinion of tho president the forest re
serves should be set apart forever for
tho use and benefit of our people ns a
Whole and not sacrificed to the short
sighted greed of a few. He further
urged that wise forest protection does
not menu the withdrawal of forest re
sources, whether of wood, water or
grass, from contributing their full share
to tho welfare of the people, but, on the
contrary, gives the assurance of lurger
and more certain supplies.
This auestlou of the conservation of
the forests, as everybody Is aware who
has given Intelligent attention to the
subject, has a direct relation to the
question of Irrigation and it Is therefore
most essential that congress shall pro-
lde whatever additional legislation
may bo necessary to the udemmto pro
tection of tho forests and to the carrying
on of tho work of reforestation. Tho
recommendations of the president and
f tho secretary of the Interior lu regard
to this should receive tho careful and
earnest attention of congress and they
will doubtless be urged by the advo
cates of Irrigation. Thero being mani
festly need of n more thorough policy
espectlng the protection and preserva
tion of the forests on the public lands
no sound reason can bu found for delay
ing to provide for this.
HESVOXSWLE OOVEHA'MEXT F1UST.
Whatever congress shnll finally de
termine to do In the matter of granting
tnrlff concessions to Gubn, It seems a
perfectly sound contention that noth
ing lu tho way of u reciprocity arrange
ment cau be entered Into until Cuba
has n responsible government, capable
of making treaties. This view Is held
by members of congress who are not
.unfavorable to making concessions on
Cuban products, but who are unwilling
that anything of this kind shall be
done until an agreement or treaty cau
bo negotiated that will give something
In return for such concessions, which
there Is no authority In the Island for
doing at present.
Secretnry Root, In urging prompt ac
tion by congress, Implied a belief that
It Is not necessary to wait until a gov
ernment Is established In Cuba, that
congress has full authority to reduce or
remove tariff duties ou Cuban
sugar nnu tobacco at once, it
this be ndmltted, yet on the
Bcoro of expediency and in order to ob
vlato possible dllUeulty lu the future It
seems to us to bo wise to allow exist
ing conditions to remain until Cuba has
government that can negotiate re
garding commercial relations. Very
likely delay will cause some loss to the
Cuban planters, but It is a matter of
so much Importance to American Inter
ests that it should be treated with de
liberation and properly determined.
PHILIPPINE PHOULEMS.
Tho report of General Chaffee on
conditions lu tho Philippines cor
roborates what has been said by other
military olllccrs regarding tho unreli
able and treacherous character of the
natives, to which Is largely duo tho
prolongation of tho guerrilla warfare.
11 who havo visited the lskuids aud
ifiado careful Investigation agreo lu
saying that no dependence can be
placed upon tho professions of friend
ship for Amerlcnus on the part of Fili
pinos generally, though doubtless some
of them are sincere. Tho largo ma
Jorlty of them, It seoins, have no con
ception of Amerlcau principles, which
Is not at all surprising In view of the
political system under which they
liavo always lived, while very gen
erally they regard the humane meth
ods of American administration us an
evidence of weakness.
President Roosevelt said lu his mes
sago that lu our anxiety for tho wel
fare aud progress of the Philippines "It
may bo that here and there we have
gouo too rapidly lu giving them local
self-government It Is on this side
that our error, if any, has been com
mltted. No competent observer, sin
cerely desirous of lludlug oht the facts
and Intluenced only by a desire for the
welfare of the natives, cau assert that
wo have not gouo far enough. Wo
havo gono to the very verge of safety
In hastening tho process. To have
taken a slugle step further or faster
in advance would havo been folly aud
weakness, aud might ,well havo beeu
crime." Thero Is reason to think
that tho advance In this respect has
been too rapid. Tho Judge advocate
geuernl of tho urmy In tho Philippines
says tho suppression of brlguuduge will
most probably bo ouo of tho tryln
problems of tho future, adding that If
tho military arm were left to deal
with tho marauders thero would be no
doubt of their Until suppression, "but
tho Incoming of civil government com
pllcutcs tho situation very consider
ably." This is doubtless a much more
moderato und conservative statement of
tho matter than would have beeu made
were not military olllccrs under con
stralnt to observe moderation In tho
expressions of their opinions.
Perhaps tho situation In tho Philip
pines has somewhat Improved since
these reports were written, but It Is
a fnct that complete paclllcatlou seems
to be still remote and before It Is nc
compllshcd somo decided changes lu
policy may bo necessary. Representn
tlvo Cooper of Wisconsin, chairman of
tho house committee on Insular affairs
lu tho last congress and who will prob
ably bo reappointed to that position, Is
of tho opinion that tho controversy be
tween tho ecclesiastical orders and the
natives Is at tho seat of all tho trou
bles between the United States and
tho Filipinos and that If tho friars can
bo eliminated from tho situation peuc
and submission to tho authority of th
United states will speedily follow, lie
approves tho suggestion of Secretary
Root that tho government should buy
tho property, of the friars und bell It
to settlers. Another thing urged Is a
general frnuchlse law which will pro
mote the Industrial development of the
Islands.
Tho Philippine problem still presents
grave dllllcultles and there Is an urgent
demand upon congress to meet them.
Meanwhile It Is manifestly necessary to
maintain the strength of the military
force now lu the uchlpelago. ,
THE COXSVLAll SEHVWE.
The lnfltlenco of the administration
will be exerted lu behalf of legislation
looklug to tho Improvement of the con
sular service. This Is plainly .Indicated
in tho reference to the subject lu the
president's message. While ackuowl-
dglng that the service at present Is
etllciont, the president rightly says
that a standard of excellence cannot bo
permanently mnlntnlncd until the prlu-
iiiles set forth lu the bills heretofore
submitted to congress on the subject
are enacted into law. Theso ineusures
propose to eliminate politics from tho
consular service aud to place tlte serv-
co on a basis of merit, which every
body will ndmlt Is the only proper
basis.
Tho president points out tho great
lmportauco of tho consular serv
ice In connection with our foreign
commerce und therefore the neces
sity of having lu tho service men of
haractcr, knowledge and enterprise.
Doubtless a majority of our cousuls
meet this requirement There are
among them men of ,llno ability, who
faithfully perforin their duties. Some
of them havo been long In the service
nud arc thoroughly familiar with Its
equlrenients. Thero are others, how-
over, who are uelther capable nor faith
ful ineu, who could not.have gotten Into
tho service If a practical tost of iltuess
hud been applied. Of course such men
are not only useless, but do tho coun
try uu Injury und bring reproach upon
tho wholo service. It (ls hardly possi
ble to prevent men of this kind secur
ing consular positions under existing
conditions aud congress should apply
the remedy by making appointments to
tho consular service depend upon Iltuess.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN PHACTWE.
Tho best test of tho arguments ad
vanced In support of and against
woman suffrage Is naturally to be found
In tho actual results of practical ex
periment. Whllo the suffrage has been
extended to woman in a number of the
western states, Colorado, with Its varie
gated population living in cities, mining
camps and ranches, presents conditions
that enable the student of political sci
ence to formulate a rational estimate.
What seems to bo nn entirely Impar
tial and disinterested survey of the prog
ress and achievements of woman suf
frage has been contributed to the cur
rent nnnnls of tho Amerlcnan Academy
of Political nud Social Sclenco by Prof.
E. Le Rosslgnol of the University of
Denver, in which lie reviews briefly the
history of tho movement up to tho con
summation of Its purpose In 1S94 nud
gives the women credit for some re
forms accomplished wholly or lu part
through woman's lulluence. Ho hesi
tates to form an estimate ns to the value
of woman suffrage to Colorado "because
of tho diversity of opinion on tho sub
ject and because It Is not yet possible to
prove either the success or failure of tho
system from the polut of view of social
expediency." Tho most interesting part
of tho paper, however, Is the conclusions
as to Its effect renched by tho writer
and expressed as follows:
People who expected that socloty would
bo utterly and immediately regenerated
through tho lnlluenco of woman suffrage
havo been grievously disappointed and
many of them, both men aud women, con
sider tho experiment a total falluro and
would bo glad to see tho old system re
stored. Woman suffrage has not purified
politics to any great extent. Corrupt prac
tices aro as common In Colorado as In any
other state, nnd it Is a question whether
thero Is less political corruption at the
present tlmo than thoro was boforo 1891.
Whllo saloons havo been abolished In many
small towns and country districts, largoly
through the lnlluenco of women, in tho city
of Denver nud lu other largo towns tho sa
loon flourishes under tho protection of fa
voring laws and in open deflanco of such
restrictions ns aro by law established. The
political character of tho Flro and Follco
board Is held to bo responsible for this con
dition of affairs In tho city of Denvor, and
It must bo said that tho Civic federation
and other women's organizations havo tried
to securo homo rulo for Denver without
success. Tho social evil has not been
obated through tho lnlluenco of woman suf
frage, and In general It may be said that no
marked social or political transformation
has yet been accomplished by this racaiis
For all that, it is safe to say that woman
tiuffrago has dono no harm, whllo It has
dono somo cood and that It has been
adopted by Colorado for hotter, for worse.
When a man viewing tho whole ques
tlou from a purely objective standpoint
draws this picture of woman suffrage In
practlco tho experiment of Colorado can
hardly bo held up as an exumplo for
other states to emulate.
A striking fact seems to bo revealed
by the recent reports for several Insane
asylums In the marked change in tno
character of Insanity disclosed by the
statistics of the patients in into years
It Is shown that tho ratio of maniacal
Inmates or those with symptoms of ex
citement to those exhibiting melancholia
or depression, which was formerly
to 1. has been reversed so that tho
number classed with melancholia now
far exceeds tho maniacs. Of course
various explanations nre already stig
gestcd lu the changed Industrial condl
tlons, although tho subject will require
longer und moro careful study beforo it
can bo thoroughly understood. If
should develop that the change is also
In the direction of a form of mental dls
ease that Is temiiorary and curnblo
rather than permanent and Incurable, an
ultimate civilization lu which manlucnl
insnnlti Is almost wholly eradicated
may possibly bo anticipated.

A HOME SO.VfJ.
Baltlmoro American.
Tho heart is singing homo again tho heart
Is singing home,
Wherover up and down tho world tho rest
less feet may roam.
When comes tho tlmo of holly leaves, of
fellowship und mirth,
That marks tha glory of tho day tho Christ
child enmo to earth
Then all about nnd all around, on moun
tain, plain and foam,
Tho heart Is singing homo again tho heart
Is singing home.
Tho wnnder-lovot It leads us on beneath
thu dreaming star;
It bitckons us with tempting hands from
many lands nfar;
It lures us where tho lotos dream Is tilted
with rare delight:
It guides us whore the Bllcnt snows gleam
through tho endless night;
Hut now, to all who wander fur beneath
the Bky's broad dome,
Tho heart Is singing homo again tho heart
Is singing home.
To every man lu evory placo thero comes
tha haunting song;
It rises llko a glory chant, In cadenco full
and strong.
To him who sleeps upon his arms beforo
tho tireless foe;
And ho who bends above his desk tha coax
ing strains must know;
For, sweeter than tho clover-tang that
drips from honeycomb,
Tho heart Is singing homo again tho heart
Is singing home.
It brings a picture of the past a picture
falr'and freo
A plcturo of tho good old home wherever
It muy bo;
And o'er tho waves It sings to us; across
the hill nnd plain;
Until the soul within us seems to echo tho
refrain,
Wherover up nnd down tho world tho rest
less foot may roam,
Tho heart Is winging homd again tho heart
Is Hinging home.
