OUR DUAL GOVERNMENT
The Wall Street Summary, speaking of President
Roosevelt, recently Raid: "Two passnses In the presi
dent's message to congress afford food for thought to all
wuie and sober-minded riUgens. In one, he asked con
gress to amend the revised statutes 'to enable the presi
dent to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties.' In
the other, he sought authority to summarily dismiss
naval officers In his discretion. The personal element
is so conspicuously present In each case that It leaves us
no room to doubt the Importance of Mr. Roosevelt In his
own estimation, and reluctantly, albeit, to conclude that
he believes he Is our whole government."
The Citizen thinks the Summary misjudges the presi
dent. It Is not the personal element which Influences
the president. It Is not for himself, hut for his office
that the president asks concessions. The fact is that
lie Is r federalist of the deepest dye. Not even Alex
ander Hamilton went further In that direction thnn
JYsklent Roosevelt would now go. He wants to spelt
this nation with not only a capital N, but would have
the N of the most enormous size known even to wood
type. He would scorn to use the language of the con
stitution and nay, "the United States are," but glories in
the expression "the United States Is."
The president has shown his personal preference for
the national government over the state governments h
every possible way and during his entire administration
thus far. If there were any doubt in this matter, that
doubt was set at rest Inst Wiednesday night by Secretary
Root, In an address In New York city. In which address
the secretary took the position that our dual government
might have been all right when this more perfect union
was first formed, but that the country has now outgrown
the possibility of continued usefulness by so cumbersome
and antiquated an arrangement.
This tendency of the president Is fully realized by
: other countries, as Is clearly set forth In the following
extract from a recent issue of the London Standard.
Commenting on the president's message, that paper said:
"The most curious feature Is that its author cou
stantlty finds himself up against the American constitu
tion. That famous' venerated Instrument seems to pre
sent Itself to him as a real obstacle to progress. At
every turn he Is conscious that the Inability of the na-
tlonal government to enforce Its will upon the govern
ments of the states is a source of weakness and danger.
Thus, In the difficulty of the Japanese Immigrants, in
the outbreaks of mob violence, In education, which is the
, prerogative of the separate states. In the laws of mar
riage nqV divorce, It is the amendment of the constitu-
: tion that the president seems to be hinting at.
i "His whole policy involves the placing of more power
In the bands of the central executive, derogating to some
xtnt from the privilege and separate Jurisdiction of
the states.
"Far-sighted, observers have long seen that the
; United States has outgrown Its cradle and is face to face
! with Insistent modern problems. It moves uneasily un
der the fetters of federalism laid upon It at Its birth in
deference to the historical necessities of the moment.
"Yet the conservative sentiment of the most con
servative people on earth clusters heavily around the
; constitution and the doctrine of states' rights, and If the
' economic and social reforms that Mr. Roosevelt desider
ates depend upon the drastic reconstruction of the con
stitution the political aspect of their realization appears
. somewhat remote."
OUR POSTAL SERVICE
A comparison of the psstofQce department with the
privately owned and conducted express- companies brings
out some facts. The express companies have no deficit.
They are about the biggest money-makers In the country.
One of them increased Its surplus iu three years from
$3,300,00 to $12,000,000. after paying large dividends.
Not long ago another of these companies gave Its share
holders a gilt In the way of 100 per cent stock dividend,
and this stock, and the old as well, Is quoted today at
265, and still going up. These quotations and facta are
taken from the New York Financier an authority.
Can you fancy by any stretch of Imagination that
if the postofllce department were capitalized and con
ducted according to present methods its stock would sell
for 265, or 165, or even 100T Or that itB stockholders
would receive 100 per cent, or even 10 per cent stock
dividends, out of surplus? To ask such a question seri
ously is to provoke ridicule. Yet, a few days ago a com
pany of Chicago capitalists offered to purchase at a big
price the privilege of running the department. These
capitalists estimate that the privilege of handling the
mails at the present postage rates is easily worth a
nunared million dollars or more than all the express
companies put together. And they would undertake to
pay larger dividends than any express company has ever
paid.
The narrow-minded complaint of Assistant Postmas
ter General Madden that the deficit of the department is
caused by the carrying of second-class matter news
papers and periodicals at a low price, Is scarcely
worth notice. The express companies do not consider
the rate of one cent a pound a low rate. They pre only
too glad to compete with the department for the business
whenever they can get it. The reasons for the deficit
are many. The excessive suras paid to railroads under
an unbusiness like "average" contract is one. And there
are niasy others; but the main reason is this: The de
partment is run according to politics and with all the
extravagance and waste that goes with politics. The
impress coniuacles are conducted as business concerns.
1:1 tll9 lflfcantlme everyone lQ'j two cents for carrying
a letter when the price fchould" be only" one cent. We
have no parcels post for the cheap carrying of packages,
as other countrkB have. The express companies see to
that. Finally, congTess appropriates money at every
session to make up for the deficit.
POiNT FOR SECRETARY SHAW
The uuhappiness east of the Mississippi river over
the lack of small bills Is rather amusing 0 westerners
and we here decline express sorrow.
There Is. a. great scartity of $l.and $2 bills und the
fcecretary Of the treasury has issued allMhat he has
power to is.uo and he implores the banks to search their
vaults for $10 silver certificates and semi them to the
treasury to be exchanged for smaller bills).
There Is a very simple solution of this problem, and
we respectfully commend it to the stricken east. Instead
of Insisting upon getting $1 and $2 bills, which sue most
of the time ureasy, dirty and Kerui-lmlen. why nt takt
nice c!ean. bright s'lver do'lars in change, for anything
up (o $5.
T Tbtt people of the west, even to the Pacific coast,
ruaVe a practice or doing this, anil they do not find that
it is a burden or a hardship. Hut the people of the east
seem determined to make a fetish of these small bills,
and cry aloud and spare not if they are asked to take a
silver dollar in change. The United States treasury ha3
many millions of these silver dollars In its vaults, bright,
new. clean United States money, the coin of the realm,
worth 100 cents on the dollar.
How much better to take a few of these In change,
how much cleaner, and thus do away with all this wall
alsMit small bills, most of which need to be handled with
a pair of tongs.
We commend to Secretary Shaw that he send a
second epistle to the people of the nation, calling atten
tion to this simple solution of the greut problem. Colo

GOOD LESSON PROPOSED '
g FOR ALL NEW MEXICO LAND $
00X0XXXXXXX0XSKCOC0XCiC
Professor J. D. Tinsley, soil expert, who has been
delegated by the A. and M. college to spend the year
In the territory organizing farmers' Institutes and car
rylng on co-operative experiment work among tho farm
ers, is highly enthusiastic regarding the outlook for ag
ricultural prosperity in this part of the territory;
"I wish you hnd 100,000 acres of winter wheat plant
ed," he remarked to The Optic last night. "With the
amount of moisture that has already been precipitated,
with the condition that the soil Is in now, If the prop
er cultivation Is done, winter wheat will come to perfec
tion this year, If not another drop of rain or snow falls
before the harvest. And of course you are certain to
get considerable moisture.
"I believe firmly that winter wheat will become one
of your most certain dry land crops In this vicinity.
You are curtain of winter moisture and your summer
rains never' fail. W3th summer crops, some of your rainy
seasons may be short enough to pinch them, but there
Is little danger of such lack with the winter crops.
"There is no doubt about the fertility of your mesa
lands. No land In New Mexico Is more entirely suited
to dry farming than what you have hereabout, peo
ple are crowding into Quay and Torrance and Union
counties to take up the government lands. I believe
the fact that you are golg to sell your lands at a moder
ate price will mean you will weed out the floaters nnd
get a more desirable class of people who have means
enough to last them for a year or two.
"I have been fairly astounded In traveling both over
the east and over the territory to realize the size and
force of the demand for cheap western lands. The
cause I believe Is two fold. First, there are many peo
ple In the crowded farming sections of the east who
have one or two hundrd acres of good land which will
sell at $100 an acre. The temptation to sell this land
kl a good figure and Invest a smal part of the money In
western land that will probably produce almost as heav
ily, Is too great to be withstood.
"Then there is a decidedly pronounced desire on the
part of hundreds of thousands of city tollers wiio have
saved a competence for a home. Some of these are
ready to snap up eastern high priced lands, while others
want to come directly to the west.
"Whatever the reason, the demand for lands Is here.
I lielleve that 50.000 people will come into Quay county
within the next two years. Every available acre of the
Las Vegas grant ought to be sold easily at good prices
during the next two or three years. And I do not believe
It will be found necessary to employ high priced east
ern agents to sell It. The important thing, of course,
is to get good people on your lands as soon as possible,
and while the demand for lands keeps up.
"The result of one harvest on fifty thousand acre3 of
land will mean, of course, more than doubling the selling
price of lands a year later.
"But it will be found advantageous not to let lnnd
men push the prices of land up too much. The man who
comes here and buys land for four to six dollars an
acre has to go to a great deal of expense and while there
Is probably no more element of chance here than In
many parts of the east, still the profits per acre can not
be as high as tihder irrigation for instance.
"I believe the grant, through local agents acting di
rectly in its behalf, con easily dispose of its spare land
at four to six dollars an acre. The money will remain
lir the community and you do away with the danger of
lands being forced on people through highly colored
stories, when the prices paid will not cnablu farmers to
quickly place their holdings on a paying basis.
. "It will be a fatal mistake If your farmers cannot
prosper on their lands. Of course I don't know any
thing of conditions, but am Just giving my views as you
ask for them. The present selling price of your lands
appears to me to' be entirely reasonable, but I r doubt i
It. would be safe to allow your mesa lands to be sold
for more than six dollars, and 1 don't see why the
board shouldn't get the greater part of the six dollars.
' '1 am organizing farmers' institutes in the territory
and will bo here next Wednesday. A week from tomor
row, at 2 o'clock, I want to meet San 'Miguel county farm
ers at the city hall for the purpose of organizing an In
stitute here. Great good will come from this movement
and from the kindred movement of carrying on co-operative
experimental work. I hope the legislature will make
an appropriation to further this important work."
Professor Tinsley went to Itaton 1I1I3 afternoon nnd
will return next Wednesday at noon. Dally Optic.

INDICTMENT OF NATIONAL '
POSTOFFICE MANAGEMENT
8COCX71 OOOOOOOOOOTXXXXXCXXXXXXJ' 3
In his annual report that has just appeared. Post
master General Cortelyou recommends that provision
be made "for the carriage by rural carriers, at a fair
rate of postage, of small parcels on rural routes, such
privilege to be restricted in each case to the HmiU
of the particular route on which the parcel originates,
or, if found feasible, to all the routes emanating from
a single postoffice." This Is a guarded concession and
represents about the least that could bo asked in tho
management of the parcels post of the United States,
whoso chief purpose at present is to be of as little ser
vice to the people ns notiflble. On every weekday over
SS.VOy rural delivery cnrrieia gj over their routes, eacli
wita a horse and wagOn. "Each conveys in his wi""11,
on the average, a few pounds of letters, newspapers,
periodicals and advertising circulars, and collects a few
letters to be forwarded. If any resident ulong tho rotitu
wants to receive or send a parcel by mall its weight
must not. exced four pounds, and on a parcel of that
size 64 cents in postage stamps must be affixed or the
equivalent exacted by the government for currying the
V.trc;l, On precis of merchandise the rale is one cmt
in ounce, ltt cents a pound, or M cents foj the four
pounds maximum weight allowed.
This system bi.yracii"-! prohibitory aud is Intend
ed" to prevent the ending of many parcels through the
mails. Why this policy of how-not-to-do-it has been es
tablished In not. entirely clear to the people, but they
are able to see, when paying charges on parcels for
warded, that the matter Is not regulated in the interest
of the public. A citizen of the United Sates can mall
a 4-pound package to several foreign countries by pre
paying lit eeiits postage, lie can mt send the samo
package to the nearest domestic ost office for less than
ii4 cents postage prepaid. How I this astounding fact
to be accounted for The reason is that ine doniet'C
rale on parcels has long been absurdly high and that
pt.nl adjustments with foreign countries are necessar
ily affected by their greatly lower rates. One branch
of the lobby engaged in fighting parcels post reductions
in this country will's up the, idea that lower ralei would
concentrate business toy much In the large cits aid
hurl, tho country stores. Every Inveinloa and Improve
ment ever made has met with fallacious resistance of
this kind. Progress hus added to business, not destroy
ed it. Country stores will have the enterprise to get
their share of trade as facilitated by fair charges on
parcels sent by mail.
Parcels post charges in the United States are more
than five times as high as in Europe and the restrictions
as to weight are much narrower. A Herman can mall
an 11-pound parcel to any part of his country on the
payment of 12 cents postage. The English und French
charges are comparatively low. But the American who
malls 11 pounds of merchandise must divide it Into three
parcels and pay postage thereon of $1.70. At the same
time, on each business day of the week, more than 35,
01111 rural carriers, each with horse and wagon, go their
rounds with a few pounds of mail each and occasionally
a few packages on which exorbitant charges have been
paid. Last years itostal deficit in the United States
was $10,000,000, and the year before It was $14,0OO,0o0.
The postal departments of derma ny, England and France
invariably report a surplus. These are the plulu facts
in the case, and It is more than likely thut the uttentlon
;f congressmen will be culled to iheni by constituent . -'5
lobe-Democrat.
