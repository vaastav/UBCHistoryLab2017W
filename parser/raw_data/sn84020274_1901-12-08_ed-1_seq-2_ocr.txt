NEW TRUST FORMING
1 ON REALTY ROW.
ISeveral of the Larger Firms May
( Merge Into Xeuclns for Two
Million-Dollar Concern.
j The phenomenal success of the promoters
.of trust companies In 8L Louis has in-.
jduced many prominent real estate men to
become interested In these ventures, and
(within the past week an entirely new cora
ipany, with a capital stock of t2.O00.O), has
'been forming along Beal Estate Bow.
which, according to the plans of the organ
"Irers, shall Include in Its directors only
active real estate agents of an established
character. ,
Tbe plans now on foot are similar to a
project which failed to mature three
months ago. for the reason that not enough
outside capital could be enlisted to buy out
those agents for whom there would be no
official poFitlon'In'thejiew company, which,
nevertheless, needed their business and
clients. That deficiency is 'no longer an ob
stacle.. --
The scheme to consolidate the business of
several of the larger real estate firms was
again1- taken up two weeks ago. Among
those approached, and who -stprepsed a
willingness to enter Into a trust company,
were the .Xlcholls-Rltter Realty and In
vestment Company, the Kutltdge & Kil
palrlck Realty Companj. Cornet & Zeihig.
Adam Boeck. -Henry Hlemenz. Jr., and
Charles F. ogel are also mentioned in
connection with the deal.
The only hitch in the proceedings at
present is the difficulty1 to find a Just value
for the business, the resources and the
goodwill of th different companies, as a
. pressed in cash or in the har.s of the
company being organized. F. G. Zeiblg said
esterday that he had set a price on the
business of Comet & Zeiblg last week, but
had heard nothing further of the consolida
tion since.
"Everything we have here is for sale."
said Mr. Zeiblg. "If the new trust company
gives us our price, we will sell gladly. But
when It comes to figuring out how much
a safe business which we know for the
stock of a. new business, or which we know
little, that is a more difficult matter to
reckon with. Some people may think that
j the shares of the new company are worth
at the outset more than par. Others may
I have an opposite opinion. It will be a. vwek

GER0NIM0 MAY BE SET FREE.
I'lau to .(.Jive Apache Chief and
Followers Allotment of Land.
m:i'uni.if speciau
Washington. JJec. 7. It Is likely that Ger
onlmo. the famous Apache warrior, and his
loilontrs, who'h.ive for years been prison
rs of war at the Fort SiU Military lieser
ation in Oklahoma, will scon b removtd
from the suivelllnrce of the War Depait
mi nt.
-Mr. Root, Secretary of War, has addressed
:i letter- to the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs In which he suggests that Geronlmo
and his band be given allotments on the
land contiguous to iort sill on nnicii
Ihey are now located, and-that they b
discharged as prisoners "of war and placed
on an equal footing with their red brothers.
The tract of land on which the Apachs are
now living comprises more than 'Si.'M acres.
The proposition to allot this land to Ger
onlmo and his followers Is n. to be acted
upon at osce, although the ugge-stion of
the Secretary of War thnt.thp Indians now
may be trusted is. gratllilng to Commis
sioner Jones. He has recommended to Sec
retary Hitchcock that before action bo
taken an inspector of the department be
sent to Oklahoma to make an Investigation
and report. It Is stated at the department
that the members of.Geronimo's inmd are
not unanimous for remaining at Fort Sill
and that many of them would pref-r to
return to their old stamping grounds in
Arizona. A proposition of this kind would
not be received with favor by the Indian
ofiiciaLs.
From present Indications the visit of the
department Inspector to Oklahoma will he
followed by authority for the allotment or
land to the Apaches and the withdrawal of
the surveillance that has been for years ex
ercised over them.
EXONERATED THE CAR CREW.
Coroner's Jury Declared Fender

A coroner's Jury j estcrday exonerated the
crew of the- car which killed the man sup
posed to be M. McTierney at Fifteenth
street and Washington avenue. Friday
morning, but found that the fender was de
fective and the brake Inefficient. C. H.
Kolker was the motorman and Fred L..
Stoll, the conductor.
None of McTierney's relatives have been
found, so the St. Louis Transit Company
claimed the body for burial. McTierney
came to St. Louis from Milwaukee, Wis.,
where he was emplojed as a tanner.

Washington. Dec 7. The Commissioner
of the General l.ind Office has received let
ter:, from the Land Olfice at I-iwton. Ok..
Mating that numerous notices of mineral
locations have been filed with the Register
of Deeds of Comanche fount. covering
lauds within ill- city of Law ton, which
hive ben rurciiascd from the Government
by lot owners in the city, and that the en
tire city It practically covered by these
mineral location?, and clouds upon the
title? of lot owners have thus been created,
v.lilch have become a source of great an
noyance, and are calculated to injuriou-ly
affect the busine"" interests of the city.
The Register of the Lawton Land Ofllee
asks what effect. If any. the mineral claims
thus aserted have upon the property rights
of lot owners in that city. The Commis
sioner has referred the question to Secre
tary Hitchcock, who, in turn, has secured
the opinion of Judge Vandeventer, Assist
ant Attorney General for the department.
The department this evening isud Im
portant regulations governing mintral en
trifs in the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache
country. Oklahoma.
The Secretary quotes the act providing
for extension of the mineral laws over this
reservation, and sajs:
ot Subject tf. Mining Lnsrs.
In an opinion by the Assistant Attorney
General, wherein this provision rai con
strued, it was held, in substance, first, that
lands which have been allotted to tbe In
dians or lands to which a homestead entry
man lias acquired fixed and vested rights
by reason of his compliance with the home
stead law are not subject to the mining
laws, or to mintral exploration and entry;
second, that from the time of the passage
of the act the body of the lands which were
to be allotted or opened to settlement, un
der the act. were subjected to the raining
laws, and to mineral exploration and n
try. so far as the same should be found
to contain valuable mineral deposits; third,
that such lands were not alwavs to be sub
ject to the mining laws or to mineral ex
ploration and entry, but that, like other
lands, only so long as they should remain
free from any vested rights of ownership
in an individual, Indian or white; fourth,
that upon their allotment in severalty, or
upon title thereto being earned by a home
stead entry-nan by compliance with the
homestead law, the lands allotted or em
braced in a homestead entry tease to be
subject to said mineral provision.
Applicable to Towmlte Lands.
There can be no question that the prin
ciples stated in said opinion are appicable
to lands to whijh vested rights of owner
ship have bten acquired, under the.townsite
law, as well "asito lands which nave been
allotted to Indians or which' have been
earned by entrymen under the homestead
'inese' principles ""are in entire harmony
with ' those recognized and uniformly ap
plied hy the Land Department in the ad
nJnistratlon of 'the public land laws gen
erallv. In view of the oDinion of the As
sistant Attorney General tt Is clear that the-'
mtntrnl msstrfalnn et th. apf of Jlin. Ii 190O-
was not intended to operate as an exception
to tne settled principles appuea ny meuuia
Department in the administration of tlra
public land laws generally. Controversies.
ilw,s'n mineral and agricultural or town-t-ite
ilalmaitts, as to any of the lands-over
which th;, miring laws were extenJed by
s-aid provision, are to be determined by the
,-anie principle-, which apply to like con
trovers'es with respect to tne publlclands
situated e'sr. here.
Mi on Id Apt Receive Applications.
Applfcttlon lor patents to mining claims
s-hould not be received by local omcers for
any of the linds referred to which may. at
the tim be embraced In an Indian allot
ment or in any existing entry under; the
ho.nestead or townsite law. and no protest
by a mineral claimant the object of which
- to have the land claimed, determined to
be subjtct to entry under mining liws,
si culil be accepted f against my Indian
allotment, or as against any entry under
the homestead or townsite laws, where the
cntr1 man has compiled witli all of
the terms and conditions necessary to en
i.I e him to a 'patent, unless the process is
accompanied by an averment that the land
"was known to contain valuable mineral
deposits at the time when the Indian allot
mmi was approved or. as the caae may be,
v J-en the terms and conditions necessary to
cttaln title under the homestead or town
site laws were ,compIId with. Lands not
Known to contain valuable mineral deposits
at the time when. In the absence of such
knowledge, the rights of the allottee, or of
the homestead or townsite entrman. be
come fixed and vested, are not thereafter
M.bjcct to exploration or entry by other
ps riles under the mining laws.
Itllilits Cannot He Affected.
Right? once vested In an allottee or In an
entrvman under the homestead or town
site laws or in a town lot purchaser, can-,
not be affected by the subsequent explora
tion or 'location of the lands for minerals.
No mining location of land within the coun
ty seat townsitcs of Lawton. Anadarko or
Hobnrt. made after the special reservation
of those townsitcs on June 24. 1901. Is of any
HISCHIEF MAKER.
A Surprise In Ilroofclr""-
vnlidity or effect whatever. Where lands
in -these three townsites were so reserved
they became appropriated and set apart
for a specific purpoe under the law and
were thenceforth withdrawn from the op
eration of the mining and other public land
laws.
In the matter of the survevlng of min
ing claims with the view to obtaining pat
ents therefor, the mining laws prov ide that
such survejs, excepting as to placer claims
located upon surveyed land and which con
form to legal subdivision, where no further
survey or plat-is required, shall be made by
or under the direction of the United States
Survej or General.
It is further provided that at the time of
filing of application for patent to a mining
claim or at any time thereafter, within the
sixty-day period of publication, the claimant
shall file with the Register a certificate of
the United States Surve or General that Saw
worth of labor has been expended or im
provements made upon the claim by him
self or grnnton-, anl that the plat Is cor
rect, with such further description as may
be necessary to identify the claim and fur
nish an accurate description tc be Incor
porated In the patent, and that the United
States Surveyor General shall appoint in
each raining land district as many compe
tent survejors as shall apply for appoint
ment to survey mining claims.
..Stt Provision for a Sarveyor.
The Congress lias made no provision for
a United States Surveyor General for Okla
homa, nor Is' there any provision in the
statutes extending the mining laws over
the aforesaid ceded lands or in any other,
which speclallv directs or authorizes the
duties to be performed by the United States;
Surveyor General In the administration of
the mining laws generally, to be performed
in said Territory by any other officer. The
que-rtlon arises as to now saiu ia-r uc
be executed Tvith respect to the lands In
said Territory, over which thev we-c ex
tended by the act of June 8: 1300. In the
absence of special legislation giving full
and complete direction, resort must be had
to the general laws conferring upon the
Land Department power In matters relating
to the survey and sale of the public lands.
Sections 433 and 247S of the Revised Stat
utes are then quoted and the Supreme
Court decision in the case of Knight vs. the
United States Land Association, and also
Bishop of Xesquaily vs. Gibbons.
Dntira of Land Commissioner.
Continuing, the Secretary states in view
er these general statutory provisions, and
or the decisions of the Supreme Court
esses ar- referred to. it is clearly tho dutv
