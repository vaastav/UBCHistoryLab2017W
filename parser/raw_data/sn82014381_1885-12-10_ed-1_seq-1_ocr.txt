Further Tress Comment* upon Cleve- ;
land's Message.
Km Yor.K. December Oth.—The editorial
comments of the Xew York papers on the
President's message are thus condensed :
The Tribune says: The message is a
creditable paper on some of the more im
portant questions of which it treats and j
deserves hearty praise. Much to his credit
tUat portion is best and most worthy of :
commendation just where bis party is worst
and its influence is tbe most to bj feared. I
In the main, what the President says ofthe !
treatment of Chinese laborers, at the West,
deserves high praise, but it is not creditable I
to him to say that the outrages aie trace- j
able to the lawlessness of men not citizens !
ofthe Doited States and engaged in com
petition with Chinese laborers. The Presi
dent certainly knows the hostility to Chi
nese immigration is not confined to
unnatoralized persons, or even to foreign
born citizens.
The Sun says : The first thing that strikes
you in Cleveland's message is the Indefati- |
gable industry with which he has studied,
assimilated and assorted tbe vast multiplic- ;
ity of facts brought to his attention in" the
course of his official experience. The result
h a very long document, encyclopedic in j
its presentation of details, full "of iiilunrri- j
tion and of interest to every citizen.written I
with admirable clearness and with the |
same variety of stye. but containing no j
pregnant though! of statesmanship, nocon- |
Bpicuonsly original idea, no new issue, to |
inspire discussion in Congress and among
the people.
The World says: Cleveland's message is
of unusual length, but tbe space it occupies
is not wasted. Jt is seldom that a docu- j
iin.tit baa issued from an Executive so ■full '<
of information and instruction forthepeo
pie. Free from verbiage.written in a plain,
business-like manner, it treats <>:' a large
number '.!' subjects, and is positive and
outspoken in its expression '•: opinion on j
the important issues ofthe hour.
The Tim 1 ■■:-:;;■ •> : The confidence of the
country in Cleveland's sound jndtment. in
his practical good sense, and in his ;!rm :
grasp of great public questions, will b ■
Qrmed and increased by his first message
to Congress. It is something mure and
higher tnan a business message. Its com- I
merits and suggestions are many. Itsprin
ciples are few and of the highest. It is a
complex sentiment of patriot! sm rednc ■! to
practical expression and applied t 1 the
mess of State.

New York Stock Market.
Nkk Yoes, December 9th—H a. m.—
Wall-street brokers and directors arrived at
their offices at an unusually early hour this
morning, and there was anxiety every
where to know what the stock market
would do at the opening, but confidence
was observable in nearly every instance
where opinions were expressed, and Lon-1
don quotations, which were here nearly
hal Tan hour before the opening of the
Xew York Mock Exchange, were reassm-
Hi.r. !■) the Board a dense crowd of brokers
Stood in the Lake Shore corner awaiting
tbe fall of the Chairman's gavel. When it
.fame it was followed by wild excitement
j for a few minutes, and a struggle between |
who had orders to close out their
I account at the opening and others who
j were there to support the market or buy
I npon the assumption that the opening
figures would be the lowest. In other parts
oi the room the crowd was less pushing,
and the excitement was no greater than is
; often witnessed at the opening of the
I Board. The opening quotations for Lake ;
Shore were 85, but tbe nest sale !
reported was at Bsfc and tbe next!
V.i 83$. The dealings were in large
lots mi 500 to 1,000 shares, and for a short
time different prices were ruling. At tbe
I same time the opening figure reported for
i Lake I bore marked a decline of 3 from last
evening's closing Qgurea. New YorkCen

the list showed declines ranging
: from : to :.. E ccitement in the Lake
crowd soon subsided, and the whole
market advanced from l«to IJ. The gains
I were mostly lost later in the honr, and at
111 o'clock the market was active and

CaUfvrnla Fralta in n>e K»st.
Kbw York, December lgth —A. M. — The
; Tribune, in an editorial on California fruits.
s lys : " The organization of California fruit
growers is of recent date, but has already
removed some grave obstacles to com
merce. TheCalilornia theory of the extent
of the Eastern market requires important
modification. The fact is that bnt for the
blind greed of tbe middlemen this market
would be supplied copiously from rieigh
boring sources. The rapacity of deal
ers. n-..t _ content with reasonable
profits, h.us practically killed the
popular demand for fruit. Should Cali
fornia competition, operating through an
exchange controlled by the fruit-growers
Of that, compel local dealers fo lower their
rates of commission, the result would be
not to give a market to the Pacific cast.
but to demonstrate tbe abundance and ex
cellence of borne produce. California can
beat Sicily in (.ranges, and may Som«
day compete on equal terms with
I Florida. It will not do for the
'California fruit-growers to place too
I much faith in the immutability of the.
I Eastern market, and all hopes of a
I ling this market for pears, grapes and small
fruits are simply illusory. California
fruit-growers have a great future before
them, perhaps, bot they must unden
thoroughly that before they can 1
o'.ir markets they mast conquer them, and
that a victory in all such entcrjiri
simply a question of tbe survival of the
fittest? 1

LoHDOH, December Oth.—Seven Parlia

A report, which is believed in the Lib

Gladstone has decided to seize the first
chance to oust the Conservatives, lie is
said to be eajrer for ollico, proposing to con
clude his public life with the production of
a home rule measure for Ireland.
Mr. Bradlautfh has entered into negotia

What is Thought Abroad of the Presi

Loitdoh, December 9th.—The Dmly Stun
editorially says: President Cleveland's
message seems to place hini in the true
sion to greater men, who have occu
pied the Pn iidential < hair, i rther than to
late Democratic Hues, it i- conceived in
the most joat and frti . t. toward all
foreign powers, and c :r.:.:ns no word to

Tbc message ex| itimeui of in
ternationalg l-will. El is equally wise
an ! prudent on i .;'.:.-~
The I'-,-t. says: Some of the Old World
men might ponder with benefit over
some oi Mr. Clevelan I's reasons toncbing
t!.<- Nicaragua treaty.
The Standard says: Xh< message is
temperate and di*cnin>d, and goes far
towards justifying Mr. Cleveland's reputa
tion. Tin' message contrasts very favor
ably with some of the mild dispatches oi
Mr. Frelinghuysen and Mr. Bloine. Mr.
Cleveland's policy, on the whole, is worthy
of adoption. Austria's action i:i refusing
to receive Mr. Keily aocords with well
nnderstood precedents in the ri<;ht to re
fnse an exequatur, which conflicts with
the American Constitution. The :•■
the republic's laws are put in keeping with
