TUESDAY EVENING. DEC. 6, 1898.
Even if it were true that Spain blew
up and sunt the Maine, now that she
has beeD utterly crushed nod has sub?
mitted to all the grievous demand?
that have been exacted of her, it would
have been in exceeding bad taste on
President McKinley's part to have re?
iterated that charge, but when there is
great doubt about it, when a Spanish
commission reported that it was untrue
when foreign naval officers in Ha?
vana harbor at the time agreed with
that commission, when even American
wreckers said the explosion came from
the inside, and when American naval
officers asked the Spanish authorities
to let them blow up the wreck with
dynamite so thai the cause of the ex?
plosion should never be known, and
when the American government,
though it has raised other sunken
vessels, has positively refused to allow
the Maine to be raised, though wreck
era have offered to do so at small cost,
for him to repeat that cnarge iu au offi?
cial paper, is disgraceful to the country
of which he is the chief executive offi?
cer. But the influence old associations
cannot be eradicated, and a silk purte
can't be made out of a siw's ear.
President McKinley favors the
Nicaraguso canal scheme, and would
have Congress appropriate hundreds oi
millions of dollars of the county's
money for the benefit of the Northern
promoters of that scheme. But if be
be at all qualified for the position he
holds, or auy of the members of his cab?
inet are for theirs, he must know
that such a canal would necessarily en?
gender and incite dangerous foreij;
complications, as, by the terms of an ex?
isting treaty with England,this country,
though it should supply all the money
that may be required to build the ca?
nal, could not have exclusive jurisdic?
tion over i:. If there must be a canru
to connect the Atlantic and Pacific
I oceans, let the Panama Company com?
plete the one they have commenced, at
their own expense, aud through which
all American vessels will be allowed to
pass on payment of a small toll.
Though a large number of the peo
pie of this country are Irish or c:
Irish descent, especially in the North, it
is seriously proposed, in that section, to
appoint Mr. Choate ambassador to
England, though that pronounced re?
publican recently made a speech in
which he advised all American Irish?
men to go back to Ireland and stay
there. If they should take his advice
this country would lose a large uumr er
of its most prosperous, best and re
spected citizens. But that is of no
consequence to Mr. Choate and his
political admirers. It is observed that
Mr. Choate does not advise the negroes
to go back to Africa and stay there.
The American gushers who have sud
denly become bent on a "union of beatrs
and hands," with England, are meet?
ing with some opposition at home. It
i3 only what might have been expect?
ed that the Irish, who compose so
large a portion of the American people,
should not go into ecstacies over any
such union, nor is it at all strange tht?t
the immense German element of the
country's population fails to mauiftst
delight at the proposition. General
Washington was opposed to all foreign
alliances, but, according to- the gushers
and jingoes, he was an "old fogy."
Though it is proposed that an
"open door," that is, free trade, be
afforded the cocquered provinces in tbe
Pacific ocean, no such favor will be con?
ferred upon those two thousand miles
nearer Porto Rico and Cuba, or to the
tax ridden people of this country. And
this, too, though all right thinking peo
look after their own households first.
No wonder England, which supplies
nearly all the imports of the Phiiippiues,
has developed a s-rong affection for the
United States. The affeation of one
nation for another is always founded
upon interest.
A pronounced jingo journal says
this country must now have "peace
and expansion." .It could have both,
but hardly at the same time, though, as
in thecase of Alaska, its limits have been
extended without war. But territorial
expansion is usuaily the effect as well
as the cause of war. The suffering en?
dured by Americans in the late war
was not sufficient to teach them the les
son that war is the worst of all evi s,
because it is the natural producer of ah
the others.
Frank Gould Gsire'^io.ooo.OOO.?
Ten millions came into possession of
Frank Jay Gould yesterday. He is the
youngest child of the late Jay Gould
and this was his twenty-first birthday!
His birthday present came from his
father's estate. He is probably the
most popular of Jay Gould's sons. He
is s modest, hard-working, studious
young man, who thoroughly under?
stands the railroad business, and is
found any day plodding away at the of?
fices of the Missouri Pacific Railroad
Company, in New York. Frank Gould's
fortune is mainly "invested in railroad
and telegraph stocks and bonds. There
i? very little of it in real estate. '

[Correspondence of the Alexandria Gasotte.1
Washikgton, Dec. 5. ,
Congressman Wise of Virginia says |
there was more cheating in his district
at the late election than ever before, ;
and that Holland, his republican op- ,
ponent, didn't receive more than six
hundred fair votes. He says that Sen
tor Daniel once led a white man and a
black one to the front of a etage aud said
"when the best of the two races are
working together the right must suc?
ceed"; but that now as the worst of
the two are working together it looks
very much as if the wrong was suc?
cessful. Mr. Wise presented to the
Secretary of the Navy yesterday a pe?
tition of "the employees of the Norfolk
navy yard for pay for over work during
;he Spauish war. A communication

committee, to which all bills for bridges

this morning, in the interest ot
the bill for a bridge across the Po?
tomac at Arlington. Tne reasons
in favor of the bridge were ably
presented by Messrs. Perry and Clem?
ents and ex-Senator Henderson, and
the committee seemed very favorably
impressed with them. There was some
talk about allowing a street railroad
to build tue bridge and use it, but the
itloa didn't seem to take, and a
member of the committee asking
why Alexandria county shouldn't
build the bridge, Mr. Clements
replied that, having taken care
of the large number of negroes in
the county and educated them for
thirty-odd years, aad as the chief pur
pose of the bridge was to afford a cheap
and convenient road to the govern?
ment's hospital at Fort Mver and the
government's cemetery at Arlington,
he thought it was as little as the gov?
ernment could do to bnild it.
As Minister Clayton has been pro?

- Gen. Lee not a Candidate.?A
dispatch from Richmond says: Gen.
Fitzbugh Lee does not expect to re
enter political life, and will not make
the contest with Senator Thomas S.
Martin for a seat in the United States
Senate. He made this statement, when
iu Bichmond recently, to a few gentle
[ men who enjoy his confidence, bat had
j good reasons theu for not making a
: public announcement of his withdrawal
' from the race. His duties in Cuba, he
? thinks; will keep him there for a good
! while, when they end he will devote
i bis time to literary work, and, possibly,
J will go on the lecture platform.
In reference to the above the Rich?
mond Dispa'ch of to day says: General
Lee bas in no way changed his mind
regarding his announced determination
to be a candidate for the United States
Senate from Virginia next year. A

deal of interest. The Dispatch wired
Gen. Lee, at Savannah, last night the
substance of the atticle referred to, and
inquired if the statement it contained
were correct. Tho answer was prompt
and emphatic. General Lee said:

TO-DAY'S TELEGRAPHIC NEWS
Esterhuzy and Henry the Traitors.
Paeis, Dec. 6?The Radical makes :
the statement that as the result of the j
inquiries made by the Court of Cassa- j
tion it appears that the traitor who j
communicated documents containing i
military secrets to a foreign power wa3
Col. Henry, and not. Dreyfus. The fact
that Henry had been liviDg bevond bifi
means attracted attention and invest
gution aa to the source of the money he
was spending revealed part of the
truth, confirming the stories about tho
relations between him and Esterhazy.
Henry, who was spending $6,000 a
year, while his stilary was only ?2.500,
received money from abroad through
an intermediary who proves to have
been Esterbazy. Henry seems to have
made the Dreyfus dozier from all sorts
of documents as soon as the leaka&e
was discovered; thus it came that Es
terhazy wrote the bordereau at Henry's
dictation.

May Postpone the Exposition.
Paris, Dt-c. 0 ?The question of post?
poning the Paris Exposition to 1901 is

tho best tonics known, combined with the

mucous surfaces. The perfect combinat'on of
the two ingredients is what produces su^h ?
wonderful results in curing catarrh tend
