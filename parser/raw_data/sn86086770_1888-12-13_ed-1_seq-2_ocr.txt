The royal baby of Spain has all to
himself a great retinae of servants, but
nowhere near so large as that of tne
present emperor of China. From his
early infancy he had in his personal ser
vice more than 600 people. Ihe list in
eluding 80 nurses and i)0 physicians, and
nobody but a member of the Chinese
court could tell the functions of all of the
people.
Oeemanv haa had three emperors this
year, bnt not one of them has celebrated
his birthday as emperor in 1888. Kaiser
Wilhelm died 12 days before his Dial
birthday, the late monarch within some
four months of the completion of hi
67th year, while the present emperor cel
ebrated his 20 h birthday on January 27
when he was yet Prince William of Prus
sia.
The London board of trade haa b*(-n
collecting statistics regarding trade
unions in England. It appears that there
has been a steady decline in the member
ship! and influence of the unions since
1885, which ended the most prosperous
period of labor organisation covering
four years. It was during this time tnat
the Knights of Libor in America m"de
their chief gain, altb.'ttgh (he decline did
not set in until the latter part of 1880.
And this loss of prestige has come in
spite of unusual t (forts by leaders to
maintain and increase Mis power and in
fluence of the unions.
The controller of the currency recom
mends in his annual report that the oat
standing plaited Htntea note'* or preen
hacks (amount dug to about :|;!, r >(),000,000)
b<' funded into bonds bearing interest a!
a l ,, per cent., to be used as the bnni ol n
national bank note circulation, the bank?
Mi be allowed to issue notes to the par
value of the bond*, instead of !' * pe.roonl
a* at present. Such a plan wonld a low
ef <i considerable ex pension of the bank
note circulation, which now amounts to
•nly about |250,000,00; but its favorable
consideration in Congress 18 probably
out of question, * it proposes the sub
stitntion of an interest bearing liability
for one bearing no interest. Greenback
isrn is not so dead as to give oau*o for
expecting another result. Mor over, any
legislation designed to modify or perpet
uate present conditions surrounding the
hank < will bo bitterly opposed by a fao
tion from the West iu the present Oou
grt sa, and probably iu the next. The
controller reports the number of national
banks in operation to th > ii 140, a not
increase of 90 during llio year; lint the
note circulation has sntfered a net de
crease of ft 7,000,000.
fill incident of ihs long conlliot be
tween the King and the Parliament in
Denmark is the recent refusal of the
lower bouse, iu that body, tc’present the
sovereign with an address on the occasion
of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his no
cession. 11 it this is not sorp-idog in
view of the persistent refusal of the king
to dismiss the Esrai'i- ministry, which has
long been obnoxious to a powerful nia
jority of the popular chamber. The
uiau.tenai.ee of this ministry, under inch
circumstances, is a dircc' violation of the
sentiment, of the kingdom, although it. i
not, ns the dispatches state, a violation
of the constitution of 18GG. Ily that doc
umrnt the legislative power is conjointly
vested in the king ami the Rigsdag,
which consists of two chambers, the
Landsthing and Folkething. The dead
lock between the king and the Lands
thing, on one side, and the Folkething,
on the other, has made progressive legis
lation well-nigh impossible, and twice
since XH77 even the iluur.e -of (he king
dotu hive been administered by a pro
visional budget promulgated by the king
For this the Kstnne ministry, waj re,.res
eut reactionary tendencies of g ivarnui. i.t
are largely responsible; and so long ar
the king consents to be ruled almost
wholly by their uclvior so long w.ll tin
nsiwos.ty between him and the hotly of
the Danish people continue.

What a wholesome, hopeful, cheerful

thoughts came trooping as we content
plate the splendid worn which is being
don ' by the stve through the institution
at Columbus. Young men thrown on
spun the wor’d. may make their way to
fame and fortune through a thou, and
avenues. Young women, left alone to
struggle for their daily bread, find the j
paths which are open to them d:ui and i
atony. Willing and strong though they ,
may be, they are deprived of the oppor
tunitiea which are thrust upon m n. The
fault lire to a large extent m the fact
that the training of boys, as a rale, is
with a distinct purpose of ft l -ting them

orally superficial aud too often frivolous.
There is nothing earnest about it. T >ey

ffoii.se. —Long before the hour for the
meeting of the second session of the 50:h
congress the galleries of the house w. re
tiilei* with spectators, and the bright dr. -
re of 'he ladies formed a brill nut frame
to the picture presented on the floor below.
I here hand shaking ww indulged iu and
congratulations on re election or oonou
etiees in defeat were exchanged anionsr
the members, jocose raillery on the part
of the republicans and patient resigna
tion on the part of the rb moorats being
every whero evident. The republic**
numbers who are prominently mentioned
i in connection with the speakership
the 51s* congress, came in for an ix'jn
hare of felicitations, U being generally
i conceded on the door that the nex*_ house
will be republtcnu wi'h from *to * "“h
--■ jority. At precisely 1-' o’clock the fall of
i .he gavel Settled the tumult which ex
m'rd in the hali, and silence reigmd.
while Dr. Milburn, the chaplain, offer..,
~rater. The rcll of members was then
called, and th hum dt conversation bn e
on' afresh. During the progress of hr
'cal Mr. Cleveland entered the ex-> .r. •'*
•'allery and became aa attractive *pe° a
f, r Ihe call developed the presence of
;f, members, there being ft* absentees.
On mourn oi Mr. Mills (Texas.) a teeo
lotion was adopted directing the clerk
to inform the senate tha. a quorum of
♦he house had appeared, and that the
house wa* read; to proceed to business.
In accordance with the resolution the
speaker appointed Messrs. Eolraan (Ind.),
l amer ;Ga.), and O'Neill (Pa.) as a com
mittee to jo a a similar committee to
wait upon the president and inform him
that congress was ready to receive any
ct uitnunication that ho might desire to
transmit. The house then, at 12:30, took
a recess for an hour. After the recess :
Mr. Holman anuonnoed that the com-1
mitlee appointed to wait upon the proi- |
dent had performed its duty, and that the
president would communicate with con
gress forthwith. The president’s annuel
message was then read by the clerk. The
portion of the message in which the
president treats of the tariff question was
listened to attentively by the members
0:1 both sidea of the house. Now
then a smile more of triumph than of
derision would appear on the fane of an
enthusiastic republican, tut tins silence
was not broken until the clerk read, "the
cause for which the battle is waged is
comprised within Huts clearly and dis
tiucliy defined. It should never be
compromised. It is the people’s cause.”
Then the democrats could no longer re
tain their feelings and broke into B round
of applause, which we . answered by the
republicans with derisive laughter. The
president’s reference to the Saokville
\Vest incident provoked laughter from
the republican side of the house, bu r no
and Yionstration was made by the demo
era g. From this point interest in the
message slackened. Mr. Mills was the
only member who paid the slightest at
tention to its further reading, and the
noise of conversation was so g eat that
this was no easy task. When, at 3:15 p.
m.. the reading was completed, Mr. Mills
offered a resolution, which wa agreed to,
referring the message to the committee
of the whole and providing for its print
ing. Adjourned.
St nnte. —It wan n unusually full sen
ate that responded to President Ingall’s
call to ordt at 12 o’clock to-day. A;
that time the public galleries were crowd
ed. The and isk of the presiding officer
whs decorated by a very handsome pyra
mid boquet. Exactly at 12 o'clock Sen.
Ingalls called the senate to order, and
Chaplain Butler opened the proceed
ings with prayer. He returned
hanks for the bountiful blessings
tooohsavtd tho laud in its material
interests, and remembered Presi
ceut-eleot Harrison In his petition.
A few minutes were spent in greeting
senators, and then Senator Sherman of
fered tho usual resolutions, that the sec
rotary notify the house that the senate is
ready to proceed to business. A resolu
tion was offered by S' n. Morrill for the
appointment of a committee to notify the
president that the senate is ready to re
oeive any corn men tea lion he may have to
make. Senators Morrill and Salisbury
composed this committee. Sen. Cameron
offered a resolution that tho senate meet
each day until further ordered at 12
o’clock, which resolution was adopted.
At 12:17 on motion of Mr. Sherman,
the senate took a itoess for half an hour.
At the conclusion of tlie rtoess, which
bad been extended to 1:30, the usual
message from the house, announcing the
facts of its being in session and of its
Uav ing appointed a committee to wait up
on the president was delivered. That was
followed by a report from the committee
to wait on the president to th) t ffeet that
it bad performed what duty and that the
president would communicate in writing
immediately. The president's message
was then delivered, and Mr, McCook, s o
relary of the senate, proceeded to read
it. The reading of the message occupied
an hour and twenty minutes. The por
tions of it which disou-s-d the question
of tariff revision, treasury surplus, fishery
troubles and the West incident were
listened to with very close attention by
tho fourteen republican senators and
about an equal number of democrats.
Tt-eolher portions of the message seemed
to have tint few, if any listeners, and
the reading had the t ffeot of gradually
clearing* the galleria* of the numerous
spectators. When the reading was finish
ed, the message was laid on the ta>le and
ordered to bo printed. The presiding
officer announced that, the unfinished
business for tomorrow wa* the bill to re
duce taxation (the tariff bill.) Sen. Frye
i gave notice that he would call up for con
I sideration to morrow morning, the bill
