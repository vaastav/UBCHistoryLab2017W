FIGHTISG HOUSE RULES.
"Insurgents" to Organize To-day-
Three Changes Suggested.
[From Th» Tribune Bureau.]
Washington. Dec. 10.— Twenty-five Representa
tives will meet at the Capito' to-morrow night to
perfect an organisation ><' "insurgents- who are
Intent on making a fight against the present rules
of the House. The leaders of the movement are
Representatives Gardner, of Massachusetts; Mur
dock. of Kansas: TownsenA. of Michigan: Hub
bard, of West Virginia; Norris. of Nebraska;
Cooper, of Wisconsin, and Hayes, of California.
These men have been paticularly active plnce
Plan met in enlisting recruits for an onslaught
on the rules, which they predict will he made at
the next session.
Three invariant BuggesUona as to effective
changes will be made at the meeting. Representa
tive Murdoch believes that the election of the
Rule* Committee by 'he members of the House
would improve the situation, and also thinks that
the committee should be increased from five to
fifteen members. Representatives Townsend and
Hayes are in favor of the election of a committee
on committee*, which shall operate similarly to
that body in the Senate. Representative Gardners
chief suggestion will be that two Thursdays In
each month be set apart for consideration of bills
on the House calendar, and the remaining Thurs
days for bills on the union calendar. In this way.
he eves, the Speaker's power of recognition
will be greatly curtailed, and that it will be In tne
power of every member to' secure prompt consid
eration of a bill when 11 has been favorably re
ported by a committee.
The "•insurgents" «re in earnest, an.l will con
sider their fight practically won as soon as their
number is Increased to forty-seven, which Is the
size of the Republican majority In the next Con
press. If this number Is obtained they feel that
they will be able to prevent the reflection of
Speaker Cannon unless he agrees to a material
modification of the rules. They will under no cir
rumnanm join v itli the Democrats in the elec
tion of a Bpeaker. but they believe that if they
can bring about a deadlock public sentiment will
demand that the rules be changed.

sion is to be composed of men especially qualified
In make the Investigation, and cannot exist for a
longer t«rm than three month* After the investi
gation la completed the commission Is to deter
mine the cause of the difficulty, locate the re
sponsibility and recommend a remedy, such recom
mendation to be transmitted to Congress by the
President.
The Mil has the Indorsement of the President, and
'.• thought by many Representatives to be the most
equitable method of assisting in ; the settlement of
labor disputes; In to-day's debate the bill was at
tacked ny a number of Democrats, amons them
representatives of labor organization?, on the
ground that it meant compulsory arbitration. This
was denied by Representatives Townsend and
Cockran. who said thai there would be no attempt
at arbitration of any sort, and that provision Is
made only for a thorough investigation, on which
public sentiment can be based
The bill was favorably reported by the Republican
members of Hie Interstate Commerce Committee,

Chutetts who joined with the Democrats, If the

XEW-YORK DAILY TRIBUTE. FRTDAY. DECEMBER 11. 19<W.
TEMPEST IN CONGRESS
REPLY TO PRESIDEXT IS
PREPARATIOS.
Committees to Consider Remarks on
Secret Service— White House
Accumulating Ammunition.
[From The Tribune Bureau.]
Washington. Dec. 10.— A tempest which may
burst with RT*at fury or break up in cirrous
clouds is brewing over the President's remarks
in his message regarding Congressmen and the
Secret Service. The Republican leaders in both
bouses of Congress have decided to permit the
adoption of resolutions providing for the refer
ence of that portion Of the President's message
dealing with the Secret Service to committees,
with lnntructiona that an investigation of the
working of the clause limiting the duties of the
Secret Service and the reasons for its adoption
he conducted and a report m*de. Representative
Perkins, of New York, will Introduce The resolu
tion in the House to-morrow. His resolution
will provide for the appointment of a select com
mittee to consider the message, and It is expect
ed that after all other portions of the document
are disposed of the committee will report that
the portion dealing with the Secret Service
should be expunged from the record. It Is prob
able that Representative Tawney. chairman of
the Appropriations Committee, will be appointed
chairman of the select committee.
.V.i decision has been reached as to who <=hal
introduce the resolution in the Senate, but the
plans of the leaders are to have a Republican
do so. It will not provide for a select commit
tee, but the Committee on Appropriations win
be charged with the responsibility of conducting
the Inv -stigation and preparing the report.
The Senate leaders were not disposed to take
any action, but the Democrats and certain Re
puoilcans who antagonize :iie President insist
-■>. that they would Introduce resolutions of cen
sure an.l would endeavor to have that portion
of the President's message expunged from the
record Conferences between the Kepub'icnn
leaders, the Republicans and the Democrat*.
and finally between the Republican leaders <•
th" Senate and the Speaker, marked the day.
and as a result it was decided that it would
be wiser for the Republicans to introduce th
resoluiiona and take entire charge of the affair
than to permit the Democrats and anti-adminls
tration Republicans to cause action of -a far
more radical character and a debate which
would be sensational and acrimonious.
The Democrats in the Senate have agree 1. in
consideration of the Republican.. promising to
take the initiative, to permit the adoption cf
the resolution without debate. This will pre
vent certain Republicans who are anxious f < r
an opportunity to attack the President, from
speaking, as they will be governed by the tie
cision of the leaders.
Th leaders maintain that reference of this
auction of the message to a committee will give
an opportunity for the bitterness which now
etiats to disappear, and that it is probable
that the report of the committee, when it finally
reaches the Senate, will be of an innocuous
character. ,
The President is keenly aUve to 'he sentiment
and the purposes of the leaders in Congress, and
is diligently accumulating a mass of material
which will serve as ammunition for a bombard
ment of Congress should any affront be given
to him through the action of either committee.
If he should be forced to take this step the re
sult would be most sensational, and the conse
quences to more than one m-mbrr of Congress
might prove disastrous.

Mr. Cannon BaM he agreed with the Rivers and

that if th« Rivers and Harbors Committee should
report a bill at this session providing for the Issue
of $l.<VK>.noo.OOO worth of bonds in the next ton years
he would vote against it. because, he said, such a
course would beset that kind of a combination
which would put great quantities of 111-advised proj

accounting therefor later on.

Are You Puzzling Over the
Problem of What Piano to Buy?
There it scarcely another Christmas question that is so perplexing ai the
one that faies the purchaser of a piano-espeaally to one who » not fanuh*
with pianos and piano-selling methods.
ii is vital that the large sum of money reqmred shall be invested m the
best instrument that it will secure.
All grades of pmncs look very much alike on the outside-except that
pianos with no tone quality to speak of usually have very showy cases^
As few people can have the advice of their own musical expert, they
should weigh well all arguments they hear, accepting only those that appeal
to their own common sense. .
There is nothing mysterious about a piano. Quality is quite as dennite
as it is in a piece of broadcloth, except to people who are tcne-blmd. and tftmj
are few.
The important thing is to COMPARE.
If ycu are going to buy a CHICKERING Piano, your problem :s easy
Same with the KNABE. The musical world has recognized their unques
tioned merits.
But perhaps you want to soend less than they cost.
You still have the SCHOMACKER. the VOSE and the EMERSON
each of varying tone-color, appealing to slightly differing tastes: but each of
undisputed artistic excellence— a piano of lifelong satisfaction.
Perhaps you think you should get a good piano for $250. And ye
But it is a price on the' border-line of danger. A great many "commercial"
pianos are sold at this figure, or near it— some claiming valuations as high as
the regular price of a Vose or a Checkering.
We advise your seeing the KURTZMANN at $250. and then
know the BEST that $250 can buy. COMPARE IT.
Perhaps you have a little daughter, who is just about to begin her rr
and you don't think that she needs an expensive piano for her early practice.
That is true.
Yet it is most important that her ear should be educated la CORRECT
TONE.
We searched the market two years before deciding upon the piano that
would rightly fill this important niche ; and after six years' experience wit!
the J. C. CAMPBELL at $190 we have never seen its equal at its price
never had a dissatisfied purchaser.
IF YOU CANNOT PLAY THE PIANO, here is the ANGELUS. which
plays any piano, and here are the EMERSON-ANGELUS and the AUTO
PIANO, which anybody can play.
