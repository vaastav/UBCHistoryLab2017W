The Bismarck Tribune Is the oldes«
newspaper In the state—established June
11, 1873. It has a wide circulation and is
desirable advertising medium. Being
published at the capital of the state It
makes a feature of state news, of a semi­
official character, and Is therefore particu­
larly interesting to all who desire to keen
the run of state affairs—political, social
and bnsiness.
The Tribune presents its readers to­
day with the full text of President
Roosevelt's first message to congress.
The message discusses many matters
of interest to the whole country in the
president's vigorous style. It will be
read with absorbing interest, and will
well repay earnest perusal. Conser­
vative, dignified and able, it reflects
the president's strenuous disposition
and his anxiety lor the best good to
the whole country. It is a long mes­
sage yet full of interest ad value. Tha
Tribune commends the message to the
careful consideration of its thoughtful
readers.
A regrettable shooting affray at
Grand Forks proves that the small man
with the gun is infinitely more dan­
gerous than the large man with the
fist. It is a sad commentary on 20th
century civilization that personal dif­
ficulties have still sometimes to be set­
tled with fists and guns. We preach
arbitration for the settlement of na­
tional quarrels and practice warfare in
the settlement of personal difficulties.

THAT APPORTIONMENT.
An item in the Tribune of yesterday
stated that owing to the rush of bus­
iness in the state auditor's and treas­
urer's departments no apportionment
would be made which was due in No­
vember. Regarding the matter Dep­
uty Auditor Harris and Deputy Treas­
urer Cook today said: "The amount
of the apportionment was given the
superintendent of public instruction
at the time by law sta/ted, but the land
department had certified the amount
belonging to the several institutions
which -was a part of this apportion­
ment and which must be transferred
fam the interest and income fund and
credited to the several institutions.
On the same day that notice of appor­
tionment was filed, the auditor recalled
it by reason of the fact that the amount
belonging to the several institutions
would reduce the amount as certified
and .made it,too small for the superin­
tendent to base an apportionment up­
on. to which the department of public
instruction agreed. We are not rushed
to an extent to stop an apportionment
and have been ready at all times to
make it."
The tax levy for the year in Walsh
county is $218,000 or about $10 per

City Council Meeting Last Night One
of the Most Interesting Since
First of Term.
Committee on Water Works Presents
Resolution Regarding City
Water Supply.
Electric Light Matter Settled and
Main Street will be LightedN
with Four Arcs.
Large Amount of Other Business
Transacted by the Council at
the Session.
There was a long and interesting
session of the city council last night—
prolific of much discussion and bring­
ing out many matters of interest. All
of the aldermen were present but Al­
derman Bajtbron, and Mayor Register
presided.
A communication from the writer
works committee, embodying a com­
munication addressed to the water
works company asking for the reasons
of the recent stoppage of water supply,
and the answer of the water company
thereto, giving the reasons already pub­
lished, was presented and filed.
The report of the chief of police stat­
ing that $14 in fees for impounded
stock for the month of November, was
filed, and referred to the claims com­
mittee.
A report was received from City At­
torney Gage stating that the aldermen
could not charge compensation for
their services as members of the board
of equalization, aside from their com­
pensation as aldermen. The report
was accepted and filed. Another re­
port from the city attorney stated -that
the chief of police was entitled to fees
for impounding stock under the ordin3
ance.
The committee on claims reported
several bills correct. The committee
on ways and means reported on the
bill of the police magistrate, stating
that in their opinion all fines and fees
should be paid to the city treasurer
and that bills should be presented for
the fees. It was also recommended
that the chief of police keep a record
of all arrests made and the disposition
of each case. The report was adopted
and the auditor directed to notify each
official of the portion of the report per­
taining to him.
The committee on ordinances re­
ported on a bill of W. P. Moffet for
publishing the telephone ordinance
last April, stating that as far as the

committee had been able 'to ascertain
the Sebtler was not at that time the
official paper of the city. The matter
was finally referred to the claims com­
mittee.
The committee on ways and means
reported on the matter of sewer ease­
ment with the Northern Pacific rail­
way recommending 'that the license,
presented by the railway company be
not signed, for the reason thait there
was no record that a sewer had ever
been constructed beneath the N. P.
tracks by the city in any regular fash­
ion. The report sta/ted that there
was no desire to prejudice the case of
the Northern Pacific or to prevent
suitable action should a sewer be con­
structed under the law and by proper
action on the part of the council in
the future. The report with the pa­
pers attached was ordered returned to
the Northern Pacific attorney, Mr.
•Allen, and a copy sent to Superintend­
ent Wilson.
The committee on streets and grades
feponted on the complaint of E. S.
Pierce, regarding the use of wire guys
by the telephone company. The com­
mittee (reported that the wire guys were
a nuisance and recommended that Mr.
Allen be requested to remove the same
within a reasonable time, the street
commissioner to remove them if the
telephone company failed to do so.
The committee reported hack a copy
of a letter sent to Mr. Allen, to which
no reply had been received. Alder­
man Smyth called attention to some
places where he said the streets for
some distance were practically fenced
in by these guys. If the streets be­
longed to the telephone company he
thought It would be well to know it.
Alderman Jackson agreed with Alder­
man Smyth, and said the committee
was willing to do what was right and
reasonable in the matter, but that he
(thought the wire guys a nuisance,
The report of the committee was
adopted and it was left to the mayor
to say what was a reasonable time for
the company to remove the guy wires
The committee on streets and grades
also reported a resolution stating that
the Bismarck, Washburn & Great
Falls railway had erectted a barbed wire
fence on some otf its property in the
city limits, which the committee cotv
sidered to be dangerous and recom
DTendjed that thie company be notified
to remove the wire cover lt.V The
report was adopted.

and repudiate a certain contract at
that daite said to exist between the city
of Bismarck and the Bismajrck Water
company, assigning as reasons for said
act of rescission that said contract
was ultra viras and void, having been
procured from the city for an amount
beyond the constitutional limit to
which the ciity could contract, and for
the further reason ithat the sum
agreed to be paid, by the city, under
the provisions cf said contract was
^grossly inequitable, unfair and uncon
conscionable, being far in excess of a
reasonable compensation for the city
to pay for the services rendered by said
Bismarpk Water company, and for the
further reason thai said contract was
procured from the city through fraud,
deception and misrepresentation, and
further that said Bismarck Water com­
pany liad failed to furnish the city and
its inhabitants a good and adequaite
protection against fire and a sufflfeient
supply of good and pure water for con­
sumption by the inhabitants of the
city which act of rescission and annul
ing of contract on the part of the city
seems to have been accepted and ac­
quiesced in by said Bismarck Water
company as said resolution by the city
council never has been set aside or re­
pealed but remains in full force and
virtue '. v'.,
And whereas, the plant and appli­
ances for the delivery of water to the
ciity ^nd its inhabitants is ait this time
operated, by a concern styling: ite^tf the
"Bismarck Water Supply Company"
with which concern or company this
city council believes the city of Bis­
marck ,to have no contract for the de­
livery of water for protection against
fire or consumption by the Inhabitants,
and, of whose constituent membership
the council has no knowledge
And whereas, the so-called Bismairck
Water Supply Company has repeatedly
refused to make connection with the
main water pipe and exteiid said con­
nection pipe to within twelve feet from
the lot or premises where water was
to be furnished, at its own expense,
when requested soi to do by private in­
dividuals and inhabitants of the city
and has further refused Or neglected
to furnish and locate fire hydrants or
plugs when and where requested by the
city council of the city of Bismarck
and has descriminated against resi­
dents and taxpayers of the city in
charges for waiter supplied
And whereas for three days/from
November 12th to November 15th,
1901, the water supply for the city was
entirely cut off, both tot fire protection
and consumption by the Inhabitants,
and for more than iten days, from No­
vember 12th, 1001, the city was with­
out a prosper supply of water for fire
protection and the inhabitants for con­
sumption, through the inefficiency at
th£ said water plant and the parties
operating 14 to furnish the water nec­
essary for the protection of Qie city
health of its inhabitants
thereby putting the city for a great
of timie in gresi peril from Are
juMi its inhabitants in much danger of

use water from corrupted sources and
the officials or parties in charge of the
water plant having given no notice to
the inhabitants/ city officials or fire de^
pajrtbment before shutting off the water
nor made any arrangement for tem­
porarily supplying water, whilst the
plant was shut down—all against the
public welfare and contrary to the
sense of fair dealing
Therefore from and after this date
the city of Bismarck will not take or
receive any water from said plant nor
pay or honor any bills presented for
the same by the so-called Bismarck
Water Supply Company, or any other
person, corporation or company oper­
ating said plant, under the contract
said to have been entered into between
the city of Bismarck and the Bismarck
Water Supply company, nor until a
fair, just and equitable contract shall
have been entered into with the city
by a person or company legally compe­
tent to so contract and financially able
to give sufficient guaranty of the
proper compliance with the provisions
of said contract to be entered into, to
the end that the city shall have good
and sufficient protection against fire
as welT as a supply for sanitary pur­
poses, and its inhabitants a proper
supply for consumption in their houses,
and all at a fair and equitable raite of
compensation.

Alderman Smyth,' in explaining this
resolution, stalted that several com­
munications
5had.
been sent to' the
water company, and information re­
quested, arid that no replies had been
received and no information had been
furnished. Members of the council
could get no information as to who
were officials of the company. There
was nothing personal in the matter
with him, but he thought that as the
city was paying over $4,000 a year for
waiter, the council was entitled to know
who the officials of the company were,'
and -to some consideration at the hands
of the company. At least they were
entitled to courteous treatment. As a
general, rule the city was furnished
a good: Gupply of water, and that was
appreciated but he did not think the
city should be forced to surrender alln
its rights to the water company, in"
the recent stoppage of water neither
the council nor the chief of fire depart­
ment had been notified.
