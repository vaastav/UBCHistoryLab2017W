The President's Message
-v RESIDENT WILSON delivered his first an
r nual message to congress on Tuesday last.
It was ver brief, dealing with but few
topics. It might bo called a curtain raiser. The
real play will begin later. Ho mentioned the
present pending legislation on the currency ques
tion and the present status of affairs with Mex
ico, and especially recommended that provision
bo made for nominating Presidents through di
rect primaries the Roosevelt-LaFollette idea
which we are satisfied will prove a misfortune
when tried. It will give politicians a magnificent
J1 chance by tho use of a little money and a few
mouthy orators to gather the rough scuff to
j ' the primaries, while the good men who have a
horror of Buch things will remain at homo, and
we shall have some President nominated that
wo will not bo very proud of.
It Is on tho same score as tho recall of
judges, which wo think Is deplorable, not only
because it handicaps judges in their positions,
but makes them dread the work of agitators,
knowing as they must know that there is no
trait in human nature so strong as the de
sire to pull someone down who has reached a
position, and to such people the harangue of a
blatherskite is sufficient proof of tho Incompe
tency of a Judge. The still more serious fea
ture Is that they cannot help but break down
I tho rospoct which is necessary to feel for the
courts, and when that is done then we will have
tho preliminary agitation which culminates some
times In riot and all manner of excesses.
When the people of Athens wero called upon
to docldo whether their greatest man should
be banished or not and they wrote their bal-
lots on sholls, one mnft gave as a reason for
voting for his banishment, that he was tired of
hearing him referred to as "tho good." That
spirit still rules in human nature. That men
obey laws at all Is bocauso the wise mon In the
past found that society was not safe for a mo
ment unless there wore laws and those laws
could bo enforced. But the old rebellious, preju
diced feeling is still an active germ In the souls
of thousands of men.
President Wilson read his address to con
gress. Many people think that it is an inno
vation, hut Washington and Adams did tho same
thing. Jefferson, when he became President,
changed tho program and his motives were two
fold. He wanted to show his scorn for tho aris
tocratic methods of Washington, for down deep
he hated Washington and deeper still he hated
Alexander Hamilton, and one of his hates for
Washington was because he knew that Wash
ington respected Hamilton and loved him and
that he did not have much respect or lovo for
Jefferson. Then he had another object. Ho
wanted to give the people an Idea that he was
wonderfully Interested in them and desired s
peclally to make the government the govern
ment of the people, when in truth he was the
most domineering President that there over was
In the United States with the possible exception
of Mr. Wilson.
The delivery of the message direct from the
President to congress Is not a bad idea. It has a
double significance. While it makes clear that
the President means business, It gives congress
men the Idea that he Is still considerate of
them. Of course, they are entirely different
branches of the government. One Is the law-making
power and the other Is tho executive, whoso
business it is to see that the laws are on
forced. But the executive in this case Intends
that before he enforces laws he should have
such laws passed as he is willing to enforce,
which makes It a peculiar situation. With a
smile tho President says, figuratively: "Wo
are co-workers for tho good of the country, but
keep in mind that I am boss," while congress
men, with a smile, answer back, figuratively:
"You can bully us, Mr. President, up to a cer
tain point, but it is us that have the say," and
so the play goes on.
The message was beautifully written. There
Is no doubt about tho scholarship or the style
of -President Wilson. His state paper on Tues
day was perfectly enough prepared to bo road
before the graduating olass at Princeton.
What of Fort Douglas
JUST before the Twentieth Infantry started for
the border one of the officers told a friend In
this city that he helieved the removal meant
the abandonment of Fort Douglas. If that is in tho
program it would bo better, It seems to us, for
the government to frankly announce It, gather up
Its property, sell what it pleases to and give
tho people of this city notice theroby that the
government Is through with us so far as a
military post is concerned. It Is said that Gen
eral Wood, chief-of-staff of the army, Is In favor
of abandoning Fort Douglas.
Tho peoplo of Utah have given tho govern
ment tho reasons why they think theirs Is tho
'best and most needed Inland post in tho United
States. It is but a day's journey from it to any
port on tho Pacific from Port Townsond to San
Diego. It is the best point in tho land for de
bilitated soldlors who 'have beon long in tho
tropics to recuperate in.
General McCook when hero prepared a paper
and sent It to the war dopartmont pointing out
that it was a vastly bettor place for a military
school than Leavenworth, and yet If with these
facts before It, tho government Is determined to
do away with the post, all right, only it ought
to notify us, because tho real estate men In Salt
Lake City would in three years make that a very
much moro attractive place than it ever has 1
(been, and maybe some multimillionaire who ob- m
talned his money from tho hills of Utah might M
decide that it was a good place to establish a M
college or a school of fine arts, or a full-fledged
university. That is, In our judgment tho gov-
ornment of the United States needs Fort Doug fM
las vastly moro than tho people of Salt Lake M
need the government garrison. fl
For the last ton years the post has beon only iH
half provided for; the appropriations which H
would have made it a rather pretty place and M
which would have beon the beginning of real M
improvements up there were stolen away by H
Senator Warren of Wyoming and expended at M
Cheyenne, which as a military post is a fail- 1
ure and always must be bocauso it does not fl
open to any place, it is an uncomfortable place, H
just such a post as soldiers hate, while no regl- M
ment ever came to Fort Douglas that did not M
leave it with vast regrets. H
Needed An Arbitration Law AH
A SINGLE trade union in Now York City, H
with only 360 membership, has had the .H
power to throw 150,000 garment workers M
out of employment just as the winter is upon
them and they need their wages every week. H
That ought to emphasize the fact that the law H
should forbid tho calling of a strike and to pass IjH
an arbitration law that both employers and om- jH
ployces should yield to. H
Poor laborers are entitled to such a law, and H
the great public has some rights which all class- JH
es, Including labor unions, should bo made to re- lH
spect. Strikes have to be settled some time and 11
a hotter way would be to settle without strikes 11
Making a Record tiM
AMBASSADOR PAGE at tho Court of St. M
James is making a little such reputation as H
Ambassador Choato did. Tho dispatches H
say that ho Is establishing a roputatlon In Lon- H
don as an after-dinner speaker gifted with caus- ;
tic wit lie fires now and thon a sly hit at 41
the English, which the Englishmen scorn to ap-
predate. At a recent banquet ho dolivored a H
beautiful eulogy on the close rolations between Jl
England and America, and worked tho "blood iH
th'cker than water" business to a finish. He lH
admitted, too, that tho charge that Amoricans M
wero provincial was true, but added that Eng- H
lishmen might be improvod, too, if tJioy had their H
Insularity sand-papered off. H
Ho referred to a conversation ho had with H
a member of parliament who cald to him, "Now ' H
that Now York has gotten rid of Its governor,
who is going to bo vlco-prosldont?" Ho told, too, I
of asking an Englishman what ho thought tho
one groat thing that tho Americans could loam
from tho English and was answorod, "You are YJH
sure yoi will not bo offended If I tell you." Ho jgH
said, "No. "Well, ho said, "Americans could mk
learn modesty from us." H
This is a reminder that when Choato was M
over there he was asked by a Scotch lord to M
go up to -his country estate in Scotland and the i
lord gave a great banquet In honor of the Ameri- Ifl
can ambassador. Choato was seated to the right IH
