Good times or hard times, no protec
tion, measure ever passed has failed to
produce sufficient revenue to meet gov
ernment expenditures.
The "comfortable surplus" of which
the treasury officials speak with so much
assurance was a deficit of J2.000.000 dur
ing the first nine days of December.
That which la making life a burden
to Congrensmen at present Is that there
are so many high-priced applicants for
ofHce and so many low-salaried places.
Controller Johnson will please taxpay
ers by declaring that no larger levy Is
needed for the city, but the taxeaters.
who have visions of larger expenditures,
will be angry.
The presence of Henry Villard among
the clvll-service reformers is calculated
to provoke cynical comment on the part
of those who have been victimized by
his railroad schemes.
Having abused his own country In
England, the only way for Mr. Bayard
to even matters up is to come home and
abuse England in this country. But
that he will never do.
The retail price of whisky In Chicago
has been reduced to 5 cents a drink, or
three for a dime. This will probably
secure the Democratic national conven
tion against all other bidders.;
It Is proposed to increasethe license
fee for saloons in Kentucky in order to
pay off the State debt. If such a meas
ure shall increase the price of a drink
of "sour mash" there will, be trouble.
The New York Herald: Fays that Mr.
Cleveland has recommended a , popular
loan. If that loan Is intended to be
used in. retiring all the greenbacks
within a brief period It will not be popu
lar. "
If the majority in the House show as
much Intelligence, alertness. Industry,
zeal' and energy in looking after the
public Interests as they have In divid
ing the House patronage they will make
a fine record.
It was not that the late Judge Thur
man was usually on the right side of
public questions that he won public re
spect, for such was not the case, but it
was because of his high integrity In the
discharge of public duties.
Senator Peffer's effort to abolish con
gressional funeral junketing excursions
ought to be successful, but it will fail,
as would an effort to cut off mileage,
stationery allowance or any other con
gressional abuse. Congress never re
forms Itself.
When Mr. Mawdsley. an English dele
gate to the American Federation of La
bor meeting, said he felt pretty sure
that If he were a capitalist he would be
as wicked as the other capitalists, he
showed he had a good deal of common
sense and honesty.
Several Chicago papers have figured
it out that St. Louts cannot take care
of the Republican national convention;
nevertheless, those who know that city
and its people will not worry lest those
who go to the convention will be com
pelled to sleep out doors.
When Minister Thurston, of Hawaii,
permitted himself to be Interviewed and
In that interview criticised the adminis
tration, he was sent home; why should
not Embassador Bayard be recalled for
slandering a large part of the American
people before a British audience?
A Washington special to the Louisville
Courier-Journal says the President's at
tention will be called to the Flemings
burg postoffcee case as soon as he re
turns from his ducking expedition. So
the British-Venezuelan controversy and
the Cuban question must still give way.
The report that the President had re
turned from duck hunting was prema
ture, and, so long as he is having luck,
of -what consequence can It be to him
that the American people are anxious to
know the contents of the Salisbury let
ter, which will not be made public until
he returns?
The Republicans in Washington must
do something besides attacking the Pres
ident. As a rule, the Representative
Barretts must be held in check. No
party ever won confidence by simply as
sailing their opponents. To retain an
advantage they must do something
worthy of It.
It la said & bill will be Introduced pro
viding that fourth-class postmasters
that fa. those at small offices, shall be
elected by the people. Such a law would
probably result in more frequent changes
of postmasters than occur now, whereas
public Interests would be served by less
frequent changes.
It will be noticed that the price of
Trheat dropped because of foreign ad
vices regarding the supply. It was not
ccorcity of gold, the noncolnage of silver
or anything of that sort, but the fact
that rather more wheat was seeking the
European markets than is needed by
consumers.
GOV. 3IATTIIEVSS FOOL FRIENDS.
Every prominent public man has
among his followers and supporters
some who possess zeal without knowl
edge, and who, through ignorance or
recklessness, are apt to do him more
harm than good. They belong to the
class of people who "didn't know it was
loaded." In common parlance, they are
styled "fool friends."
As Governor Matthews has reached
the dignity of being a presidential can
didate, or aspirant, it would be strange
If he did not have fool friends. In fact,
they are a necessary adjunct of any
presidential boom, a sort, of badge of
genuineness and guaranty of good faith.
All the same they require watching.
Just now the Governor's fool friends are
pointing the silver gun at him without
knowing it is loaded. Of course, they
do not mean to hurt him, and they will
not believe it possible for him to receive
any injury from an unloaded weapon
until It shall go off and kill him. Then
they will be very sorry, and wonder how
they could ever have been so foolish.
The conference of Wednesday showed
beyond any doubt that the free silvet
Democrats of Indiana Intend to press
the issue and Insist on a free silver
plank in the next State platform. In
the rough-and-tumble discussion of the
question which was accidentally precipi
tated' in the conference they showed a
.numerical majority and decided ag
gressiveness. They talked like men who
had knives In their boots and would
use them If necessary. Unless some
thing Is done to head them off they will
capture the next. State convention and
adopt a free silver platform.
All these free silver Democrats are In
favor of Governor, Matthews for Presi
dent, as they ought' to be. As a Demo
crat in good standing and the only possi
ble Democratic candidate In Indiana, he
should, of course, have the united sup
port of his party in this State. There is
no reason to doubt the sincerity of these
free silver Democrats In-their friendship
for Governor Matthews, but there is
much reason to doubt their, wisdom.
They forget that Indiana alone cannot
nominate a candidate for President, and
that the Democracy of the Eastern
States will have nothing to do with a
free silver candidate. They could not
do Governor Matthews a greater dis
service than to have it go out that the
Indiana Democracy are for free silver.
The adoption of a free silver plank in
the State plitform would kill him; not
merely embarrass or. injure him, but
kill him. Politically speaking, the Gov
ernor's fool friends might as well pre
sent him with a loving cup of Rough on
Rats as Identify the Democracy of his
State with free silver. They should
learn wisdom from the Governor him
self. He discovered some time ago that
the free silver gun was loaded, and he
promptly laid It down. Ills fool friends
should do the same if. they wish to
avoid a fatal accident.
A CIVll. PENSION 11 ST.
In his report the Commissioner ot
Pensions recommends that clerks in that
bureau who have become unable to5 ren
der any service through age should be
pensioned. In an address before the Na
tional Civil Service Association, Mr.
Foulke' recommended that a fund be
raised for the maintenance of super
annuated -clerks and other -employes by'
an assessment upon their salaries while
they are able to do duty. If anything
is to be done In the way of providing
for clerks in the departments and pre
venting their retention on the pay rolls
when they are unable to render any
service, Mr. Foulke's suggestion is the
best that can be made. But why make
these clerks special beneficiaries? They
receive as much compensation, as a rule,
as do men and women performing a
service . requiring as much intelligence
as one must possess to get a clerkship.
For the work they actually . perform
they receive higher compensation than
clerks In private employment, yet there
has hot as yet In this country been any
proposition made to care for persons in
private employment after they are un
able to labor. Why discriminate? And
Ithis leads to an inquiry as to the neces
sity of retaining men and women In
government clerkships until they be
come old. Unless they become so ex
pert as to be more useful than ordi
nary clerks, would it not be better to
limit their years of service to eight or
twelve? In that time, if they are pru
dent, they could find employment which
would be better; for them than a life in
the routine work of a department. An
exception should.be made In favor of
railway postal clerks, who cannot be
said to be clerks in the ordinary sense
of the word,' biit officials whose duties
require efficiency and alertness. The
higher skill and the risk which their
work Involves should lead Congress to
either increase their compensation or
provide a fund for their support when
they - are disabled. It requires three
times as mucn capacity, If the phrase Is
allowable, to make a competent postal
clerk as to discharge the routine duties
required of a $1,200 department clerk;
yet, all things considered, the compen
sation of the clerk is higher than that
of the postal railway official.
IIISTOHV REPEATING ITSELF.
Hon." Galusha A. Grow, of Pennsyl
vania, In his criticism of Mr. Cleveland's
money borrowing, debt-making policy,
said: "The present administration seems
to have begun where the Buchanan ad
ministration left off." The statement la
historically true as well as neatly put.
During 'the administration of Bu
chanan, the last Democratic President
before Cleveland, the public debt in
creased from $31,972,000 In 1S36 to $64,
812,000 In 1860, and this In time of peace.
During the last year of the administra
tion money was borrowed at a ruinous
rate of Interest to meet the necessary
expenses of the government. On the
14th of December, 1S33, Congress passed
a law authorizing the Issue of 110,000,000
In treasury notes, payable in one year,
at the lowest rates offered. The Secre
tary of the Treasury offered $3,000,000 of
the notes, bids to be opened Dec 2S,
and when the time came only $100,000
had been offered as low as 12 per cent.
There were some offers at 24 per cent.
and some as high as 26 per cent. The
Secretary rejected all over 12 per cent.
As the government needed money at
once, it borrowed $1,500,000 of the banks
at 12 per cenL A month later It offered
$3,000,000 more of treasury notes, payable
in one year, and they were taken at an
average rate of 10 per cent. This
shows the condition of the national
finances In the last year of Buchanan's
administration. Thanks to the Repub
lican party, the public credit is a great
.deal better now, but owing' to Demo
cratic legislation the revenues of the
government are not equal, to Its expendi
tures, and the deficit has to be made up
by borrowing money. Thus It may be
fairly said that "the present adminis
tration seems to have begun where the
Buchanan administration left off."
There was a sort of historic propriety
In this statement coming from Mr. Grow.
He was a member of Congress from 1S31
to 1S63, and personally cognizant of the
disgraceful events during Buchanan's
administration. Now, after more than
thirty years, he is In Congress again and
able to testify from personal knowledge
that this administration seems to have
begun where that of Buchanan left off.
Mr. Grow is a very wid9-awake man,
but If he had been asleep thirty odd
years and had wakened up In the Treas
ury Department he would be Justified
in thinking that it was still the admin
istration of James Buchanan.
DEADLOCK OF THE STATE IIOAUD
OF HEALTH.
If the State Board of Health is of any
practical use to the people of Indiana it
should be efficiently organized. When
the flr3t attempt was made last spring
to elect a secretary qualified for the
position, it is said that Dr. Ilurty would
have been elected had not the Governor
called In the two Democratic members
of the board and insisted that they
should vote for a Democrat. This state
ment was made at the time, and it has
never been' denied. As a result the
matter has dragged along from March,
and now there is no adequate organiza
tion. The present secretary is said to
be unfitted for the position. That the
other four members of the board, two
Republicans and two Democrats, do not
vote for him indicates that they believe
he is not the man for the position. So
the usefulness of this board, if it has
any, Is destroyed by continuing as its
executive officer a man for, whom no
member of it will vote, and who cannot
be expected to do as well as he might
under men who have expressed a lack
of confidence In him. The deadlock
arises over ihe question whether the
secretary shall be a" Republican or a
Democrat, not over the vastly more. im
portant question of the man best quali
fied for the position. Now, if this board
is of any consequence whatever, its use
fulness is being destroyed by this child
ish contention as to whether the secre
tary shall be a Republican or a Demo
crat. He holds an office which cannot
affect a public question upon which par
ties divide. Consequently, if he Is a
skillful and energetic man It matters
not whether he Is a Republican or , Dem
ocrat. An Inefficient Republican could
be no more effective in efforts to check
smallpox or other epidemics than an
inefficient Democrat.
It may be that the State Board of
Health is not needed. The course pur
sued by its members Is certainly cal
culated to give that impression. The
alleged action of the Governor in advis
ing Democratic members of the board
to refuse to vote for any man for secre
tary, even so able a man as Dr. Hurty,
indicates that he cannot lelieve that its
mission is an important one. If he does,
If such a board Is necessary In his Judg
ment to look after the sanitary condi
tions of the State, and he prevents its
organization until a member of his staff
can be elected secretary, he shows how
Immeasurably more Important he re
gards the appointment of a Democrat
for a nonpartisan position than the
efficient management of a board which
deals with the public health.
If this board cannot be organized at
a very early day with an efficient secre
tary, the Legislature should abolish it
when it meets or so change the law
creating it that its executive officer shall
not continue to be a bone of contention
between spoils mongers.
The bill of Senator Davis, of Minne
sota, does not establish the rank of lieutenant-general
on the active list or add
another officer to the list, but simply
provides that the senior major general,
while commanding the army, shall have
the rank, pay and emoluments of a lieu
tenant general. After the honor be
stowed upon General Schofleld It should
not be denied to such officers as Miles
and Merritt.
It would be much better for the Re
publicans In the Senate to let the finance
committee stand Instead of reorganizing
It so that the free coinage Senators
shall control It; but the Democratic pa
pers have no chance to make objection
so long as all of their members on that
committee are in favor of free coinage.
The County Commissioners have done the
proper thing In the manner of their adver
tising for bids for county printing In that
they have reserved the right to reject any
and all bids, in whole or in part. This will
tend to prevent bidders from following the
too prevalent custom of making low prices
on the class of goods of vhich but little
is bought, and making up the loss and a
large profit by putting high prices on such
items as are used in large quantities. The
so-called "cute" bid .will not avail under
such a rule. The State officers recently
effected a large saving to the State by fol
lowing this plan, but under the rule adopted
by the commissioners they will be able to
do relatively as well with much less labor
in carrying out the figures.

CVIirtEXT PERIODICALS.
Among the features of Donahoe's Maga
zine for December are Illustrated papers on
the holy childhood In art, the mound-bulld-ers
of America, dramatics In Catholic col
lege3 and papal Avignon.
Frank Leslie's Pleasant Hours for Boys
and Girls Is a well illustrated and typo
graphically attractive monthly containing
a' good variety of stories and other juvenllb
literature. The current Issue will commend
itself to Boys particularly, because it tells
them "how to win at football."
The Christmas number of the Book Buyer
(Scribner's) gives enticing glimpses into all
the new books cf the season, being at one
a guide to those undecided what to buy
and a source of entertainment to the busy
people who must content themselves with
mere gllmpres Into current literature.
The third quarterly issue of the Cyclo
pedic Review of Current History (Buffalo)
covers the events of the year from July
1 to Sept. SO. and is a most convenient
book of reference. It comes in pamphlet
form, and its matter is so carefully edited
and condensed that It Is contained in ISO
pages.
The Monthly Illustrator Is filled with re
productions of the work of well-known
artists, with especial attention given to
pictures relating to the Christmas season.
It has a varied table of contents, the lit
crary features rince the union of the maga
zine with Home and Country having takeu
a wider scope.
The Strand Magazine is one of the cheaper
English periodicals, each number being
complete In itself and selling at 10 cents
a copy. It is well printed and illusfated,
and strictly English in -till its characteris
tics. Like American magazines, however,
it Is affected by the Napoleon craze, and
in the current issue offers facsimiles of his
signatures.
Tho Christmas number of the Pali Mall
Magazine numbers among its contributors
Arthur Symons, Lord Ernst Hamilton,
Grant Allen, Christian Burke, Sara Jean
nette Duncan, the Duchess of Cleveland
and I. Zangwlll. The pictorial features of
this magazine are far superior to those
of any other English periodical outside of
the art publications.
A variety of subjects which thinking
people talk about are discussed In the De
cember Eclectic Among them may be
mentioned "The New Spirit , In History."
"The Ethical Solution of One Social Prob

"Pasteur and His Work," the last named
being the contribution of a biologist. From
the Nineteenth Century is taken ?a Medi
cal View of Miracles at Lourues."
The Philistine discourses at some length
on "The Charity that Paul Forgot." "He
has given us," it says,' "the charity that
suffers and is kind, that forgets self, that
Is superior even to , martyrdom and the
giving of all to the poor; and that is chief
of all virtues, the very' spirit of goodness.
But Paul of Damascus lived eighteen hun
dred years ago. He knew all the kinds
of charity that were In vogue In the first
century. He did not know, or he forgot,
organized charity."
Rev. Edward Everett Hale says in Book
News: "I would trust a boy in any gen
tleman's library to choose for himself; ob
serving that it must be a gentleman's IN
brary, and not a blackguard's. If I were
buying books for presents for him I would
in all cases buy books of action, of ad
venture, of natural science or of the open
air. Boys have a strong sense of honor,
but excepting that I do. not think they care
about sentiment in. any of its forms. If
they were introspective, as, thank God, they
are not, I would never tempt them into the
dangerous line of looking in rather than
looking out." . .1,

FINANCIAL CONCERN.
The President Criticised by Bankers
for Ills Inuction.
New York Letter in Philadelphia Press.
Since Saturday many expressions of sur
prise and anxiety have been heard from
local bankers and financiers because of
the delay in sending to Congress the re
port of the Secretary of the Treasury.
The surprise is occasioned because it has
been presumed that Mr. Carlisle would in
detail report upon those subjects which
the President treated in a general way in
his message. The anxiety Is due to the
fear that Mr. Carlisle may have held back
his report so long that he might elaborate
certain recommendations not suggested by
the President's message.
"I am very anxious about Mr. Carlisle's
report," said an ex-Controller of the Cur
rency this morning. "If I could be sure
that ho would go no further than the
President did, then I should have no ap
prehensions," and this comment suggests
what many other bankers have been say
ing. The wonder has been whether Mr. Car
lisle would suggest,' as he ha3 before, that
the law requiring national banks to keep
a reserve be repealed. It has not escaped
notice here that the President, while recom
mending the cancellation of the legal tend
ers. Bald nothing about the embarrass
ment such action would cause the banks,
unless some other provision was made
for the reserve. That Mr. Cleveland did
not mention this has caused the Impression
to become general that he agrees with Mr.
Carlisle and would favor the abolishment
of the reserve feature of the national
banking system.
Aside from the fact that if the green
backs were to be retired without also
repealing the bank reserve law complica
tions would arise, bankers speak of an
other and greater objection. Not one of
them with whom the Press correspondent
has spoken has failed to express the
opinion that to abolish the reserve would
be a very dangerous step. Mr. Hepburn
says that it should not be for an instant
thought of, unless the banking laws are
so changed as to permit the national banks
to establish branches, as is done in Scot
land. Another thing Is being more and more
talked of here, and that Is the lnacuracy,
not to say disingenuousness, of that part
of the President's message which Intimates
that the sale of bonds was not made neces
sary In order to get funds to meit the
treasury obligations. Every clearing house
banker in this city remembers that in the
first twelve months of Mr. Cleveland's
administration $73.00.000 In gold was paid
Into the New York clearing house by the
subtreasury here because the government
had nothing but gold with which to meat
these obligations upon It.
Chicago's Disappointment.
Washington Special.
With one accord tho Chicago crowd holds
S. W. Allerton responsible for the lake
city's falldown, but insiders do not believe
Chicago would have secured the prize in
any event. The game was set up against
her from the start. Still, a scapegoat Is
necessary, and Mr. Allerton has won that
unhappy distinction. If he had joined the
others of the delegation in pledging the
hundred-thousand-dollar fund they think
the committee would have named Chicago.
He defen3ed himself on the ground that
if he signed the pledge he would be put
ting himself in the attltud of an indorser
on $100,000 of unscrutlnliei papers, which
was, to his shrewd and careful mind, a
most unbuslness-llke proceeding. It was a
risk he did not feel like assuming. This
view was not wholly complimentary to the
other gentlemen cf the delegation, but Mr.
Allerton was a free agent and of legal age.
When he quit the delegation had nothing
to do but throw ujt Its hands and stand
pat on a guarantee of some $50,000, which
the richest man among them had stamped
'undoubtful."
WHAT ME. UAYACD SAID.
The Text of Ills Remarks Shows that
He Was Not Misrepresented.
Embassador Bayard Is said to have ex
pressed the opinion that those who were
criticising his recent speech had read only
a synopsis, and not the speech itself. The
full text of the speech, which was received
yesterday by Hen. W. H. English, of this
city, by mall, and printed in the News,
shows that his denunciation of protection
and Its corrupting and demoralizing Influ
ence on American politics and public men
was much more sweeping, severe and ill
tempered than the telegraphic synopsis
made it. A portion of his remarks is ap
pended: Justice enthroned on law is tho only pro
tection of the humble and defenseless. How
shal justice be enthroned but by a united
public opinion demanding it? And the de
mand must originate in the articulate in
dividual conscience, which must be listened
to and respected, or we shall be ground
down by the despotism of numbers, or mili
tary autocracy, or aggregated wealth, en
acting and compelling obedience to laws,
not to establish justice and Insure domestic
tranquillity, but to secure unjust privUeges
and unequal advantage. In my own coun
try I have witnessed the Insatiable growth
of that form of State socialism styled "pro
tection," which I believe has done more to
foster class legislation and create inequality
of fortune, to corrupt public life, to banish
men of independent mind and character
from the public councils, to lower tho tone
of national representation, blunt public con
science, create false standards in the popu
lar mind, to familiarize it with reliance
upon state aid and guardianship in private
affairs, divorce ethics from politics, and
place politics upon the low level of a mer
cenary scramble, than any other single
cause.
Step by step, and largely 'owing to the
confusion of civil strife, it has-succeeded
in obtaining control of. the sovereign power
of taxation, never hesitating at any alli
ance, or the resort to any combination
that promised to assist its purpose of
perverting public taxation from its only
true Justification and function, of creating
revenue for the support or the govern
ment of the whole people into an engine
ior. tne seinsn ana private pront or allied
beneficiaries and combinations, called
"trusts." Under Its dictation individual
enterprise and Independence have been
opressed, and the energy of discovery
and Invention debilitated and discouraged.
It has unhesitatingly allied Itself with ev
ery policy which tends to commercial isola
tion, dangerously depletes the treasury, a ad
saps the popular conscience by schemes of
corrupilng favor and largesse to special
classes, whose support is thereby attracted.
Thus it has done so much to throw leg
islation into the political market where job
bers and chatterers take the place of states
men. The words of Lowell's warning well
apply:
"Rough are the steps, slow-hewn In flint
iest rock.
States climb to power by; slippery those
with gold
Down which they stumble to eternal mock;
No chafferer's hand shall long the scepter
hold.
Who. given a fate to shape, would sell the
block."
It is incorrect to speak of "protec
tion" as a national policy, for that It can
never be, because it can never be other than
the fostering of special Interests at the
expense of the rest, and this overthrows
the great principle of equality before tho
law, and that resultant sense of Justice
and equity in the administration of sov
ereign powers which is the true cause ot
domestic tranquUlity and human content
ment. The value of "protective" taxation
to its beneficiaries consits in its inequality,
for without discrimination in favor of some
one there is no advantage to anyone, and it
the tax is equally laid on 'all, all will be
kept upon the relative level from which
they started; and this simply means a high
scale of living to all. high cost of produc
tion of everything and consequent Inability
to compete anywhere outside the orbtt of
such restrictive laws.
But the enfeeblement of individual en
ergies and the impairment of manly self
reliance are necessarily Involved, and the
belief In mysterious powers of the state
and a reliance upon them to take the place
of Individual exertion fosters the growth
of state socialism, and personal liberty ceas
es to be the great end of government.
How can we fall to perceive that it is
fatal to hopes of advancement or even of
retention of what has been gained by civiliz
ation when Individual freedom and idiosyn
crasies of personal character are impeded
or cramped in their free expansion by the
stupid interference of inflexible labor laws,
which may be reasonably applicable to one
description of human exertion and yet whol
ly unadapted for others; beneficial to on
man. hurtful to another; a benefit to on
class, a curse to another; repressing activ
ity, discouraging energy and enterprise, and
tending only to establish a standard of dull
and hopeless mediocrity? I can imagine no
more unhappy fate than for a man to be
chained to an occupation below the natural
level of his capacities-cruelly cramped in
his aspirations and forbidden to rise to his
full intellectual and moral stature. And
vain and irreverent are all such attempts
to establish a dead level in human faculties
of body or mlnd-a bod of Procrustes on
which the bodies and minds of men are
to be stretched or maimed, but never to
rest hi peace. v -

This is a Democratic party sweep at an
election where national politics should not
haVe intruded. It has been won by a party
which makes no pretension of nonpartisan
ship in local affairs, but believes in divid
ing a 1 the offices among the active work
er? Wc shall see in due time with what
urres Mr. Quincy meets the pressure
which he is certain to encounter, ft. how
ever can be said with considerable confi
dence, and without awaiting the results of
Mr Quincs struggles with the spoilsmen
of his own party, that the result of placing
thU year's municipal election an the party
line of national politics has set back the
caSso of partisanship in Boston local
affairs many years. If this elect loo i is any
test it will only be necessary to raise the
party warwhoop hereafter to overwhelm
all attempts at electing municipal officers
on any other than political grounds. It can
not b? regarded in any other light than a
retrograde step towards unalloyed partisan

ELUCIDATION AND REVIEW OF IN
TERNATIONAL LESSON, DEC. 13.
David and Jonalhnn, as Related In
First Samuel xx. Verses 32-42 The
Power of the Divine Grace.
By REV. JAMES E. GILBERT, D. D.,
Secretary of the American Society of Re
ligious Education.
(These lessons constitute the Sunday
school extension department of the above
named society. All who study them are re-
Suested to send their names, poitoffice ad
ress and denomination, mentioning this
paper, to the author at Washington, D. C,
for enrollment.)
CONTEXT. Lost lesson closed with David
standing on the dead body of Goliath,
whose head he held in one hani. whose
sword he grasped with the other hand.
Pleased with this exhibition of braver-,
Saul took him Into his service. David's
manner and spirit won the heart of Jona
than, Saul's son, and the affection was re
turned end a covenant made. (Ch. xviii, S.)
Jonathan , gave his garments, sword, bow
and girdle to hi new-made friend, who
went out afterward at the King's direction
and gained victories. Oa returning, he was
greeted with shouts by the women. These
demonstrations awakened the Jealousy of
Saul who, on several occasions, attempted
David's life. Even the King's daughter was
given in Vnarriage, after a snare had been
laid. (Ch. xvlil, 21.) Matters came at last
into a desperate state, and David felt that
there "was but a step between him and
death. (Ch. xx, 3.) He opened his heart to
Jonathan, who remained steadfast, not
withstanding his father's eramlty, and they
devised a plan by which to .test the 'real
purpose of the King and to determine
what course to pursue. -l
MEDIATOR. It was agreed that on" a
certain feast occasion David should return
to hi3 father's house with Jonathan's ap
proval. As it was customary for the King's
family to assemble at such, times, Saul's
deposition might be judged as he noticed
the absence." It occurred as was anticipated.
Jonathan answered his father's questions.
Saul's anger was Instantly kindled against
his son. auhougn previously they had been
on terms of great intimacy and affection,
which fact had given ground for hope of
successful intercession. (Ch. xx, 2.) He em
ployed highly abualve language accused
Jonathan of duplicity, declared that the
friendship for David would result in his
ruin and keep htxn from the throae. It is
evident that he had knowledge of the tact
that the ton of Jess had oetn anointed by
Samuel. He then demanded that David be
brought and put to death. "Wherefore
should he be slain?" Interposed Jonathan
(Prov. xxlv, 11, 12), like a trus mediator.
What hath he doner By asnlng lor the
nature of David's offense tJohn vii, 51), be
made an appeal to the sense of Justice,
which is, to some extent, in every heart,
hoplug to turn aside the wrath ot vhe
Kiag, as he had previously done. (i'h.
xlx. 4.)
PASSION. The questions had Just the
opposite effect. (Prov. xxli, 24.) Saul per
ceived that his son had conndence in David,
that lie desired to shield him. and would
even prevent his father's designs. The
evil spirit that had controlled him since
his rejection now wrought mightily, and
Hwept across bis soul with tremendous
force. (Luke ix, 39.) A storm of ungov
ernable passion raged. Seizing a javelin,
the King cast it with muraerous force
to sanlte Jonathan. The atrocity of such
an attempt seems to some persons totally
incredible, and yet it bears no proportion
to his buosequent Impious and most bar
barous murder of the priests, their wives
and children (Ch. xxll. 11-19). because the
latter was deliberate, while the former web
the result of sudden and furious rage.
Rising quickly from the table, Jonathan
escaped, his heart beating with indignation
and grief. (Mark ill. 6.) He not only saw
what was in store for his friend, but also
the deplorable state into which his father
had fallen, a kind of desperate madnefs,
endangering the. lives of his household,
destined to end in his destruction. (Ch.
xxxl, 6.)
SIGNAL. Jonathan did not fall to keep
his pledge with David. At the . appointed !
time next morning, having absented him
self from his father meanwhile, he went
out to the field, accompanied by a lad.
Shooting an arrow, he sent the lad to
bring it, crying, "Is it not beyond thee?
Make speed, haste, stay not." This was
the agreed signal by which David, who had
concealed himself in the field, might know
of Saul's evil purpoje and secure himself
by retirement. The people of the East, as
best suited their ardent nature, were ac
customed to express many things . by ac
tions, sometimes by actions accompanied
by words. (Job 11. 12.) This procedure, how
ever, was not wholly because of such cus
tom. When Jonathan and David made this
arrangement, three days before (Ch. xx,
20, 21), they did not know that they could
meet alone in the field, and they desired a
method of communication which might be
understood by them, but be unintelligible
to any others who might be within hear
ing distance. When two hearts are Joined
in friendship, they frequently have secrets
and seek modes of confidential intercourse.
GREETING. It so occurred that no one
was in the field. Delivering his bow and
arrows to the lad (who understood not the
significance of what had transpired), and
dismissing him, Jonathan advanced, and
David came out of his biding place. The
greeting was prolonged and cordial.
David's conduct united all the respect and
honor due to Jonathan's rank with the
most endeared affection and glowing grati
tude. He fell on his face to the ground,
an act of respect bestowed upon a
superior or benefactor In Oriental countries.
(Gen. xllll, 26. And this he did thrice, com-
Cletlng the duty of reverence, as the rab
Is claim, although Jacob exceeded this.
(Gen xxxiil, 3.) When the two met they
embraced and kissed each other. This was
no unusual practice in those days (Gen.
xlvill, 10), the simplicity of manner among
men leading them to conduct now common
sonly among women. Whether the people
of the West have gained by maintaining
more reserve is a matter of some uncer
tainty. In this instance, looking back
ward and considering all the circumstances,
no one can fall to admire the unrestrained
expression of David and Jonathan, each
for the other.
SORROW. There was more than love In
that greeting. Mingled with it and intensi
fying it was sorrow. There Is no affection
so deep, so beautiful, as that of adversity
(Prov. xvll, 17), and grief makes one hungry
for that which love has to bestow. Jon
athan's sorrow was partly for his father,
but chiefly for David, whom he admired
and loved for his excellent qualities and for
his undoubted future as the servant of God.
But David's sorrow, while It may have been
tinged by regret for the King, was chiefly
due to his own misfortunes. He considered
himself an exile, destined to wander from
place to place, at every moment exposed to
the King's wrath. He must leave his wife
and children, and he must be excluded from
the ordinances cf religion. It was. Indeed,
an hour of sore trial to one who for a few
years before had been anointed King.' How
strange .to him must have appeared th
ways of Providence. And so the two. In
sorrowful affection, folded in each other's
embrace, weeping together (Acts xx, 37)
"until David exceeded."
COMFORT. Jonathan first gained control
of his emotions and sought to strengthen
the. heart of his friend. When the fountain
of tears has been opened the mind Is clearer
and the speech is sweeter. After such ex
Changes the son of the King may uttei
what the trembing heart of the persecuted
will receive like cordial. "For as much as
we have sworn, both of us. in the name of
the Lord." Jonathan began, recalling that
covenant which they had made at their
first acquaintance, explaining and renew
ing it. By this It appeared that they were
bound together because of their loyalty tc
God. Their friendship was rooted in piety.
(I Pet. i. 22.) No other would have endured
the strain. Jonathan proceeded: "The Lord
be between me and thee and between my
seed and thy saed forever." In the most
solemn manner he assumes and enjoins a
perpetual obligation, he to be David s friend,
David to be his friend, that relation to be
extended to their posterity, witnessed and
approved and blessed by the God of Israel.
SEl,AKAT10X.-"Go in peace " said Jon
athan, a dismissal with Player-keep a good
ieart. trust in the I-ord. all will toe w11,
ha intended to say encourangly. David In
tears needed such parting blessing, for his
heart clung to his benefactor like the
storm-shaken vine to the oak. (Prov. xxvll,
17.) They separated, never to meet again in
this world. tave once to reassure each
other's hearts and reaffirm their vows.
(Ch. xxlll, IS.) Jonathan returned to the
city, to hia home, to share the fortunes of
hia father, ultimately with that father to
die on the field of battle (Ch. xxxi. J), at
the hand of a Philistine. And David went
forth to Nob (Ch. xxi. 1). a prlesta' city in
Benjamin, and thence a wanderer from
place to place, a fugitive from the wrathful
king. Sustained by his faith In God. and
by the last words of Jonathan, he waited
patiently while the weary years passed,
never doubting that the day of his hopes
would dawn and he should find Jits ap
pointed place and mission, learning mean

(II Cor. lv, 17.)
CONCLUSION. Friendship contract?!
with the wicked decreases from hour to
hour. like the early shadow of the momlnc:
but friendship with the virtuous will in
crease like th shadow of the evening, till
the sun of lifo shall set. Historian anl
poets have delighted to recount the in
stances In which men have Wen made to
love and trust each other. The school chil
dren have read the story of Epsminondas
and Pellpldas, of the Greeks; of Orestes
and Prlades, of the Scythians; of Damon
and Pythias, two celebrated Syracusan.
Bat these, the brightest examples of what
Is possible to unrenewed hearts, are rot
worthy to be compared with the exhibition
of mutual regard between David and Jon
athan. This shows what divine grace can
do, and what a world of blessdnes wouil
be ushered in if all hearts were subject to
that grac. What the heathen world has
admired. Christianity Is designed to pro
duce. (Acts iv. 32.) What every heart
nods. the gospel will supply. (Prov. xviii,
21.) This is part of the feast to which all
are invited. (I John I. 3.)

Oft losing sight of the heavenly goal.
Yet faltering courage and hope renew
As the beautiful words on the air Hill roll.

the treaty with Great Britain prohibiting
the building of war ships on the great
