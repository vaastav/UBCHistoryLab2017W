the cringing politicians at Washington,
coupled with tbe desire of our brave
naval officers to have trouble some

We bave not heard that a Gaitteai

equally as bad are among immigrm i

"Mafia" among Japanese, and there
are no Herr Musts or Emma (ioldmans

anese seem to lacs such valuable citi
zens, such welcome immigrants, aud as
compared with our negro citizens,tbey
are, as individuals, aud as a nation, as
far above tbem in honesty, virtue and
patriotism, as the mountain above tbe
plain. It bas not been thought neces
sary to buru any Japanese for un
speakable crimes, as is the case with
our colored citizens. They are indus
trious, thrifty and sober, and their
conduct as a class is irreproachable.
But they work. A horrible crime to
be sure, and since they do this they
must not come iv bere lest tbey spoil a
good thing, lest they break up a mo
nopoly emigrants from other coun
tries hope to establish, or rather bave
established. Some day these Sand
Lotters of California will force Uncle

■ So i'.ng as negroes can roll in
from Attica, and Dagos from
Italy, and Europe's offdcouriugs cm
swarm to our shores uuhindered and

which we can exclude Japanese. But
if we undertake it we should bave more
reason to do so than the vaporings of
Sand Lotters, California politicians
and some labor unions on tbe Pacific
coast. Certainly it seems ironical
wheu we know that Mayor Schmitz
and Solicitor Reaf of San Francisco,
both foreigners and both now in the
penitentiary, were foremost at one
time in advocating Japanese exclusion
because it is claimed they are "a dis
honest people."

CONSERVATIVE STATESMAN.
Editor Dispatch:
By spontaneous approximation, the
two great American leaders of radical
ism, Roosevelt and Bryan, seem to
have coalesced. At least, their recent
apparently prearranged meeting at
the White House, in Washington, aud
Kthen occurred between them,
irs to indicate it. Should these
gentlemen happen to be at tbe
head of the tickets of the two domi
t political parties at tbe next
eoiUI election, it would be of
concern to the voter wbich he
They appear to be in full ac
n all live and vital political ques
tions. The American people never
meant to declare either of them dic
tator. They have twice In a most
emphatic way notified Mr. Bryan tbat
they did not need bim for any purpose.
At tbe last November elections, in bis
own state, Nebraska, and the state of j
Kentucky, where he made himself and
nis political views most conspicuous
during tbe campaign, the suffragans I
made tbeir desire manifest that Mr.
tiryan should retire to private life.
Nothing, however, seems to daunt
bim. In tbe light of all these facts be
continues, unsolicited, to decide to,
and force bis views upon, the demo
cratic, party, a party founded and
existing today, upon principles and
policies utterly variance with those ad
vocated by bim. Not only this but hi
X further, and dares to dictate to
chief executive of our national
rnment, whose power was made
ble by tbe political heresies of
v, and pledges democratic aid in
.. . consummation of tbe radical views
of the executive. What democratic
congressman does Mr. Bryan own? If
there be any such sboddj goods among
tbe democratic representatives in
congress, the party should now com
mence preparation to rid itself of all
such at the next election.
However much Mr. Bryan's friends
may admire bim personally they are
doing him and themselves an injustice,
and are rendering tbe democratic par
ty and the country bad service by con
tinuing to urge his nomination. There
now exist doubled and quadrupled
reasons for declining to support him
tbat existed in 1896 and 1900. Demo
cratic principles cannot be eliminated
except by a destruction of our republi
can form of government, bat, another
nomination of Bryan would most
probably result in the elimination of
Bryan from public life, and a total de
struction ot tbe democratic party.
Nothing, perhaps, more thoroughly
disgusts tbe American people, than
persistent arrogance, egotism and self
importance in a public man, and witb
such, patience finally ceases to be a
virtue. Hence, if tbe democratic
■' again nominates Bryan, there
ict be enough of men remaining
b ranks to make it at all form id
v a national political contest,
c adiiering to the cardinal princi
ples of democracy will be compelled to
secede from the party calling itself
democratic, ally themselves with those
adhering to the old creed and thus
form a new party under another name,
in order tc perpetuate the principles
upon which the government was found
ed and must exist.
The problem is narrowed to this:
Will those American citizens who call
themselves democrats, permit one
political heretio to manufacture a new
creed, force it upon their party, and
then force his nomination?
A West Virginia Democrat.
—Staunton Dispatch and News, 5.v
inst.
By "spontaneous approximation"
we have arrived at the conclusion tbat
tbe above styled West Virginia Demo
crat "coalesced" with Mark Hanna
in 1896 and 1900 and voted straight for
McKinley, or worse yet for Palmer
and Buckner. The same "spontaneous
approximation*' brings as to tbe con
clusion that he is sick of bis job, for
judging from the grimmaces he makes
he would not be in more torment had
he "coalesced" with some rat poison.
The same "spontaneous approxima
tion" to bis Democratic tendencies
leads as further to believe that in 1904
be beheld the "consummation" of his
political desires in tbe "elimination"
of Mr. Bryan and tbe elevation of Mr.
Parker, on wbicb occasion he came
back as a lost speep, and allied himself
with other "suffragans'' under the
the barner made of that ''shoddy
goods," with a "formidable determi
nation to perpetuate the persistent ar
rogance, egotism and self importance"
of tbe fence jumpers, malcontents,
renegades, campaign fund grabbers,
and corruptiocists, who had along
witb Mark Hanna and other election
bribers in previous elections, made
politics in American a stench in the
nostrels of civilization, the fruits of
which we are now enjoying, for we
know positively now tbat this putridi
ty and rottenness surrounding us was
given its caste and impetus in the cor
rupt politics of 1896, when voters were
bought as sheep and the presidency !
was stolen. Even then the hated
Bryan got one million more votes than
B beloved McKinley, and as between
bated Bryan and tbe beloved Par-!
ker as a vote gatherer we feel ashamed
tospeak,it Is sosaddeuiug if not humil
iating a subject. Inasmuch,howevre, as
West Virginia Democrats of like ten
dencies as the above writer, have so
effectually handed their State over to
the Republicans, these "spontaneous
approximations" of opi ion as to what
real Democrats should do,or witb whom
Mr. Biyan aud his suffragans should
coalesr, aie of too little importance to
be seriously considered. Tbey will no
doubt, therefore, leave this West Vir
ginia adviser and those wbo think as
he does to tbeir own meditation.*.
Since no matter bow clean tbey may
be washed, at tbe first opportunity
they will return again to their wal
lowing iv the mire.

PREACHES ONE THING, PR AC HUES
ANOTHER
Tbe government, at least tbe bead of
it, is counseling tje people to have
confidence in the banks and put tbeir
money in tbem. Tbe government,
however, does not let any of its money
go into banks in tbis country. It sup
plies tbe New York banks abundantly
—bat here even a bank of National
deposit is not allowed to bave money
collected by the Poßtofnse or tbe In
ternal Revenue department. All such
money must go to Washington. Thus
our country is drained in that way
witb no returning relief. It is a poor
rule tbat does not work: both ways.
Tbe government preaches to the peo
ple a doctrine it will not practice

WASHINGTON LETTER.
(from our Hezuiar uorre.pondeni )
Washington, D. C., December 7. —
Quite a sensation was created in tbe
political world on Friday wbeu the
President stated to a pro nirient bank
er of Pennsylvania, who told bim that
the people of that State wanted bim
for another term. "That cannot be.
I cannot serve beyoDd my present
term. lam grateful to the American
people for tbeir kindly feeling toward
me, but somebody else must carry on
tbe work." Tbe conviction is grow
ing among the national committeemen
of tbe Republican party, iv session in
Washington this week, tbat this state
ment is final and the belief is current
tbat an official statement will be made,
to tbisrffecr, before many more weeks.
This conviction as it spreads leaves
some of the eommitteemen without
anchorage. Few aie willing to risk
the chance of falling out witb tbe ad.
ministration, and some have recourse
to tbe entirely safe coarse of declaring
for Mr. Roosevelt despite his personal j
attitude. But this conviotion is causa
for infinite relief among those politic
ians who at heart wish some other
candidate, but who fear the conse
quences of aligning themselves with
the faction which opposes Mr. Roose
velt. Thus it will be seen clearly that
the Republican brethren do not dwell
together in peace aod harmony.
Evidence has already been given
tbat tbe army nominations snot to
tie Senate by the President are not to
be permitted to go through without
question by that body. Protests have
been filed against confirmation of
Brig. Gen. J. B. Aleshire, to be quar
termaster general, and against Brig.
Gen. William W. Witherspoon, of the
War College, on the ground that they
have been advanced over the heads of
officers ahead of tbem in rank. The
real facts in tbe case are that Senator
Hopkins, of Illinois, has a constituent
in Chisago who is endeavoring to palm
off on the government a batch of
horses pronounced unfit by Gen. Ale
shire wbo is an expert in these matters.
Hence the bold up of his promotion by
the Illinois Senator.
The recall of Viscount Aoki and the'
information received at the State De
partment from our. Ambassador at
Tokyo that Baron Kogoro Tskahira
will in all probability succeed Viscoant
Aoki as Japanese Ambassador at
Washington, have created no little
sensation in diplomatic and adminis
tration circles. Baron Takahiras
appointment would undoubtedly be
acceptable to this government, and he
is on very good terms with President
j Roosevelt. Some effort has been
made to make it appear that Ambassa
dor Aoki's return to Japan is a symp
tom of friction in the relations between
the United States and Japan but this
is treated as absurd by tbe adminis
tration. While tbe real reasons for
tbe recall are not as yet perfectly un
derstood, it ie quite certain this coun
ty has bad no hand in the matter.
Tne recall is an affair of tbe Japanese
[ diplomatic service, and its motlt c mast
!be sought for in tbe purposes and
1 methods of Japanese diplomacy.
! The President's message to Congress
excited little interest or comment, but
; one opinion seems to be universal and
.' that is that it was entirely too long
and it is considered somewhat signifi
cant that but one newspaper in the
city of New York carried the message
in fall.
Announcement was made in Wash-!
ington on Thursday nigbt k that the
citizens of Cleveland, Ohio, are more
than anxious to have tbe Democrat.c
convention meet there, and when the
Democratic National Committee
meets in Washington on Thursday
next, it is whispered that Mayor Tom
Johnson of that city will be on hand
witb tbe promise of a fund of $100,000,
all of which bas been raised, and
much by popular subscription, to bave
tbe next convention beld in tbe Forett
City. So far as is known, no other
city will submit a proposition promis
ing as much money as Cleveland < ffere,
and it is understood tbat its citizei s
are inspired not alone by tbe desire to
eet big conventions in the babit of
meeting there, but that the condition
of Republican affairs in tbe State aug
ments tbeir desire. The advance
guard of t c committeemen, Tom Tag
gart of Indiana, tbe National Chair
man, is expected to arrive in Wash
ington either Saturday of this, or San
day of next week.
The three sessions held by tbe Na
tional Rivers and Harbors Congress
convention in this city, were marked
by addresses by men of prominence
who represented every section of the
Uuited (States. The speakers included
governors of States, presidents of large
railroad companies, and others wbo
bave the cause at heart.
Local Option for Washlng'ai.
Although tbe temperance fight in
the District of Columbia bas not act
ually opened, it is promised tbat it
shall be inaugurated the first week in
January, at the latest.
Several organizations will have
charge of the fight before Congress.
It is claimed that if the Committee on
the District of Columbia, of the House
of Representatives, is constituted as
expected, a majority of its members
will vote to prohibit the sale of liquor
in the capital, or to allow the citizens
of tbe District to vote upon tbe ques
tion, in accordance with tbe provisions
of a bill introduced by Representative
John Lamb, of the Third Virginia
District. Tbe spectacle of residents of
tbe national capital casting ballots on
election day would be novel in tbe ex
treme, since few of tbem, comparative"
ly, have ever witnessed such a thing.
It bas been nearly forty years since
the right of suffrage was taken from
tbe District of Columbia, the national
government disfranchising many
thousands of white citizens in order to
prevent practical domination of the
negro in the government of the capital
of the nation.
Tbe local option idea is thought to be
popular in the District of Columbia.

prospect for the nomination of Bryan,
the advantages of Chicago as a place
of residence, Bill Nye, James Whit

a variety of other subjects, say the
Richmond News Leader.
