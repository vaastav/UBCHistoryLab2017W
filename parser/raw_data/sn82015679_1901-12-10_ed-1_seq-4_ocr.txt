Senator I"re"s ship-subsidy bill which

Sugar is cheap because the American

competitors in the field, which have com
pelled a cutting of prices. An -xchange

A POLITICAL VISION.
The Raltimore Sun is the victim of tne
of those correspondents In this city who are
t known as purveyors of political pipe
dreams, in that it has assumed that such
writers sometimes deal with fact. Thus de
ceived, the Hun tells its readers editorially
that "iiewjj of an interesting political move
ment tomes from Indiana," the news being
that the colored leaders in the State are
about to draw the color line politically. The
Hun goes on to say that Indiana is a close
State, and that "without the O0"0 colored
voters the Republican party would be in a
hopeless minority." The Sun is further in
formed that the colored leaders propose to
put a colored ticket in the Held next fall.
The .Sun is a conservative Democratic Ta
per which has usually fought ex-Senator
o'orman, and it predicts at the outset that
the movement in behalf of a colored ticket
will fail and the mass of the colored voters
will continue to vote the Republican ticket.
The Sun's ilrt anel fatal mistake is in thi
declaration that thero are 3',0nO colored
voters in Indiana. It has been led into
making such a declaration by takln? the
statements of a correspondent who proba
bly knows better. Once in six years, for
the purpose of apportioning members cf the
Legislature, a careful enumeration of the
voters Is made. This was done within the
past few month?, and the ofllcial report by
counties was published about two months
;igo. This enumeration shows tho number
of colored voters in Indiana to be 15,272.
Now, if every one of these 13.272 colored
voters bad voted an independent ticket in
ivd, lSfHj, lSf'S and 1300 the Republicans
would have hael a plurality. If no one of
the colored voters in Indiana had voted for
Mr. McKinley in 1&"0 the Republican plural
ity would havo been 11,570. These two
facts that of the number of colored voters
and the Republican plurality destroy nil
the interest in the alleged political move
ment in Indiana.
A3 for the movement of colored political
leaders to form an independent party, the
Journal has never heard of it. Kvery year
there are such report?, and often quite a
number of colored men have voted the
Democratic tieket, but in the last two elec
tions, particularly the municipal election,
the colored voters were with tho Republic
ans. The Sun itself has little hope of an in
dependent movement by colored voters,
sayinp that only a limited number of col
ored voters recognize the leadership of a
lew men in their own party. The action of
the (Inrman Democracy in Maryland and
of th Democrats in other State where
tlif y h :ive the political power in' disfran
chising colored voters by tens of thousands
is not likely to win the colored voter to the
Democratic party or drive him from the
Republican party in States where he is al
lowed to vote and his rights as a citizen are
not only irotected by law, but respected.

The. decision of Judge Stubbs to consider
juvenile offenders apart from the other al
leged offenders who are brought into the
Police Court must meet the approval uf all
who give the subject consideration. The
massing of mere boys with tho hardened
men and women who appear with more or
less irregularity in the city court brands
them as being of the criminal class at the
outse t. Those who see them in that court
so classify these boys, and the boys theni
seives fcl that they have been assigned
to the criminal classes because of their
conduct. The object of modern treatment
of oung offenders is to cure them of their
lawless tendencies rather than to punish
them. Putting a boy in jail for some slight
offense may bo punishment, and It m?y be
regarded by the victim as conferring upon
him the distinction of being a tough. It
Is known that in associating with hard
ened rn n in jails boys sion learn to take
a pride in being known hs toughs. Such
experience as here tated has led those
who are dealing with crime and pauperism
to make special efforts to rescue boys
whose environment and association tend
to make them recruits to tho army which
makes war on society. Judge Stubbs pro
poses to have boys arraigned in a private
oom, and. with the officers who have
charge of neglected children, make an ef
fort to induce responsible persons to look
after them. The plan may not work, but
it is well to try it, and to try it thoroughly.
If boys do not yield to such treatment the
Reform School Is the place for them. As
was stated a few days ago, this treatment
of wandering boys who are arrested in Chi
"Cgo has resulted in turning into other
ways hundreds of boys of the character
that were formerly sent to jail. It is be
lieved that if the curfew ordinance and tho
compulsory education law were rigidly en
forced good result would follow. It is un
derstood that the curfew ordinance will be
strictly enforced bj the present police
authorities. The chief purpose of all this
effort is to break up the primary schools
of vice and crime.

The real cause of th alleged fear of the
competition of the United States by Ger
man manufacturers is one which no tariff
regulation can remedy. Germany has tech
nical skill and much cheaper labor than
has the United States, and while it cannot
compete with us in the production of the
cruder form of iron and steel and ma
chinery protected by patents. It can under
sell us in finished goods requiring much
manual labor. The same is also true of
Great Rritain. With simply a revenue tar
ift. the two countries would take the
most of our market for fine woolens, in
cluding hosiery, cutlery and other finished
goods. Very naturally both countries, bu;
particularly Germany, are hostile to a
j lr,fC hich keeps them out of our markets.
As a matter of fact it is Germany's di
vided interests between its manufacturers
and its agriculture, and rot America, that
is German) 's peril. Her agriculture e an
r.ot sustain hr people. While the limit of
agricultural production seems to have bee.:
j reached in Germany, its consumption of
the uroducts of axricuiture is increasing.
Nevertheless, the farmers demand a tariff j
that will materially Increase the cost of
food. Such a tariff the manufacturers op
pose because it will increase the cost of
liing and must either force an increase
In wages or a lower scale of living. The
inability to adjust these conflicting ele
ments and the increasing; Inability of Ger
many to raise Its foel are its perils.
Years ago, when Great Britain, with the
control of the world's manufactures, was
confronted with the conflicting interest of
an agriculture which could not feed its
people and manufacturers demanding free
trade because L'ncland had a hundred years
lead in manufacturing, she sacrificed her
rgriculture, and It has been declining ever
since, until Kngland depends upon America
lor a large part of her food. At the same
time she has lost her monopoly in manu
factures. The United States has no such disadvan
tages. Whatever has stimulated manufac
turing has helped agriculture. There is
more probability now than ever that the
United States will hold its supremacy as
a producer of food. Do what they will,
both Oermany and Great Rritain must de
pend upon the United States more or less
for food. Kngland has ruined her agricul
ture by her free-trade policy, and now
that tame policy is losing the home market
to competitors in all parts of the world.
With anxiety, if not alarm, Kngland's
practical men contemplate the invasion of
Per competitors and ask what can bo done.
If Germany listens to its land owners and
makes food dear, her growing prominence
in the world of manufactures will be
threatened.
It appears in the statement of Treasurer
of State Levy that Secretary of State Hunt
paid into tho treasury during the fiscal
year which ended Oct. CI, $10-S.3L as fees
collected from corporations. This is a large
cum of money when it is considered that it
comes from fees paid by business and man
ufacturing associations seeking incorpora
tion. That the amount is as largo as it is
is duo very largely to Secretary of State
Hunt, who urged upon the Legislature the
passage of the law which has made it pos
sible to assess these associations. The
change which has given tho State $103,909.31
has been of no advantage to Secretary
Hunt, as he receives no part of the fees
and is not a candidate for re-election. Mr.
Hunt has done a great deal of .work for the
State for which he ge ts no extra compensa
tion. It is some satisfaction, however, t
feel that one has rendered the State a good
service.

SOME OF THE NEW BOOKS
"WeliRter'a International Dictionary.
A new edition of this standard and indis
pensable work has just been issued by the
publishers, George Merriam Company,
of Springfield, Mass. The latest edi
tion previous to this wa? published
in lSf3, but the rapid growth of the lan
guage necessitates frequent revision and
emendation of a book which serves a vast
number of persons as a guide to the Eng
lish tongue and which undertakes to be
thorough and complete. It has been found
by the editors that no less than 2Ö.() words
have become such a fixed part of the vocab
ulary since the preparation of the edition of
lürö that they properly belong in the pages
of the new work. Accordingly a supple
ment containing this number has been add
ed to the book. It seems a tremendous
growth for so short a period, but even a
casual glance over the new pages shows the
character and sources of the additional
vocabulary anel fully accounts for them.
The great majority are of scientific origin.
liotany. astronomy, meteorology, geology
and chemistry have each added many
terms. Medicine is responsible for a long
list, electricity for another, mechanics and
engineering for another, and so they go.
The crowded columns are a striking testi
mony to the rapid progress and develop
ment in all the arts and sciences. A great
number of these words are so technical as
to be beyond the ordinary comprehension,
but the popularization of science in all its
forms and the adaptation of many scientific
discoveries to practical use has, on the
other hand, made another large proportion
of them a part of the common speech. Even
those not now familiar may become so at
any time, and words which now convey lit
tle or no meaning except to experts iri a
special line, may by reason of application
to a new invention or appliance be Incor
porated in everyday speech. But there are
other causes than the energy of scientists
for the expnnsion of the current vocabu
lary. The Spanish-American war brought
soma new ones to the front, as "mono," a
castle or fortification. There is "moros," of
Philippine origin, and "mono," a Hawaiian
bird. Tho South African war brought
"commando." "veldt" and othr unfamiliar
terms into common us "I'u," meaning a
department of a Chinese province, has its
place. Golf, having been Americanized,
jias brought all its queer Scotch lingo along
tor adoption, and this has been incorpor
ated in the new dictionary. Fashion does
its share, "Tuxedo-coat," for instance, be
ing given recognition. There is the word
"rookie." defined as "soldier's slang from
Kliding;" "dope." expressive word, is at
last dignified with a place among respecta
ble associates. The word "age," as used in
the gamo of poker, creeps in. Among old
words with new meaning is "veteran." used
in forestry to signify a tree over two feet
in diameter. Tho verb "to spell." signify
ing to supply a place for a time, is, curious
ly enough, set down as an Australasian
colloquialism. It is a common Americanism.
Who has not hearel the expression, "spell
me for an hour," meaning, "act as my sub
stitute." "do my work?" "Morris-chair"
finds a place among; the K.hj new words.
It is comparatively so short a time since
that now familiar piece of furniture was
designed by tho late William Morris, in
the course? of his efforts to bring simple,
jet artistic, household furnishings into use.
that it would seem that no well-in formed
person, least of all a word student, could
fail to associate his identity with the name;
yet. t-o transitory is fame, it is said by the
lexicographer to be "probably so-called
lioni the proper name, 'Morris!' "
A dictionary is always a fascinating work
and to have all the newer words to them
selves affords an especial chance for one
who liks to delve into such columns. The
elastic character en" tho language is well
demonstrated by this bulky addition. The
new edition lias been prepared under the
special editorial supervision of W. T. Har
ris, United Slates commissioner of educa
tion. He has been aided by specialists in
the several technical lines and accuracy
may, therefore, bo regarded as assured.
JnrriN of llarvnrel.
This, as the title leads one to expect, is
a stery of the. life of a college student. It
develops, however, that the life of this
particular student has comparatively little
to do with the classroom and the routine
which unsuspecting and confiding parents
picture their sons as enjoying. It is, on
the contrary, mainly a tale of his proceed
ings outside that institution and of his
amatory experiences. Jatvis, Jt appears,
has had just before his introduction as a
freshman the experience, meore common
perhaps in real life than is often admitted,
of being led morally astray ley a young
woman of his own select social circle. Of
pure mind and clean life up to that time,
tho experience makes him reckless and he
drifts into association with chorus girls
and other women of the lowest type and
spends much time in dissipation to the
neglect of his studies. In the course of tim.
he partially recovers his mental and moral
balance and falls in love with a gcod girl,
only to coine once more within the tolls
of the original siren. Eventually he casts
her off and his true love becomes recon
ciled to him. Incidentally some glimpses
of cedlcge life are given, one or two ani
mated chapters relating to athletics being
introduced. The author explains In a
preface that ho had no other purpose in
writing the book than to tell a story, but
this explanatimi does not really justify and
account for the story, which is not worth
the? labor the author has put upon it. The
fact that, as he says, the college freshman
is neither man nor boy, hut is in the transi
tion stage loes not make interesting a
record of tho vulgar amours of one such
youth who happens to be of especially weak
fiber. No moral is taught by the narrative
except that a man given over to dissipation
cannot hope to succeed in the legitimate
pursuits of the college a lesson that it
hardly needs stich a novel to teach. And
though Jarvls at the end is put suddenly
int the path of reform there Is no assur-une-e
that he will continue in it or that h
will not fall when the charmer beckons him
again.
it must be said for the author, Mr. Regi
nald Wright KaufTmaii, that he hau han
dled a rather risky subject with delicacy
and that he tells a story well. It seems
probable that he is yo;;ng and that if hc
were older he would not f:el moved to
write precisely this sort of book. L. C.

The Secret Orchard.
The scene of this novel is laid in France,
with an intermingling of pathos and
comedy and with a tragic- ending. The
central character, Helen, Duchess of Clu
ny, was mentally undeveloped, her affec
tions having taken precedence of her In
tcllect. Without the glamour of wealth and
position she would have been conFidered
insufferably dull. Her husband, the Duke
of Cluny, was apparently devoted to her,
but was Trequentiy aosent. ostensibly "on
business." The men among her friends
were faithful to her and were united in
the effort to keep all unpleasantness from
her knowledge. But her women friends
and relathes found her extreme amiabilitv
and sweetness a cause of exasperation.
and they, having their eyes and earn wide
open, sought, but vainly, to arouse in her
ordinary insight and observation. Helen
and her Cluny had been married twelve
years and were childless. Helen, think
ing to do a charitable deed and to please
her husband, adopteet a "child of eight
een and brought her home to the dismay
of her friends, who read the yourig woman
at sight, and to the horror of the duke.
who saw in her the companion of his lat
est escapade.
The situation was tragic, but Helen per
eeived nothing except that Clunv seemed

Flovrcrs from Persian Poets.
A curious proof of the cosmopolitanism
of literature and the individuality of poetic
sentiment is furnished by a publication is
sue d by T. Y. Crowell & Co.. of Xew York,
entitled "Flowers from Persian Poets."
It U remarkable that the modern taste for
poetry should be suli as to demand, or
to be thought by publishers to demand, a
.large compilation of the works of Persian
poets who livid, wrote and died hundreds
of years ago. But true poetry never dies,
and these volumes contain many fine pass
ages and thoughts clothed In poetic lan
guage which, making ullowance for Orien
tal imagery, is much the same as the poetic
language of to-day. Those who know- my
that Oriental languages are very dilticult
to translate into English because their
thought and spirit as well as fine form
are so alien and opposed to the practical,
direct and unimaginative mind e.f the
Westerner that the translator's attempted
interpretation is often a mere guess. How
ever this may be. the editors of these
works, Nathan II. Dole and Belle M. Walk
er, seem to have used excellent judgment
in utilizing the work of translators w no
have been verv sucecssfui in embodying
too Oriental soirit in English. The two
volumes contain selections from the seven
principal poets of Persia, beginning warn
Firdausi, who has been called the Homer
of Persia and who wreite the longest poem
that was ever put on record, finishing it in
the year VW, and ending with Jami, who
was born in 1114 and whose "Yafa and
Zulaikba" has been pronounced by a com
petent English critic the lines t room he
ever read. It is -a dramatic love pnem
founde.l em tin? scriptural story of josepn
and Potiphar's wite. The collection aiso
includes copious extracts from Sadi s
"Gulistan. or Rose Garden." from Omar
Khayyam's "Kubalyat," and other cele
brated Persian poems. They aro accom
panied by critical sketches and copious
rotes, and there is an introduction by Mr.
Dole which conveys much information re
gRreling Persian literature. The two vol
umes are a mine of Oriental lore.
Sister Teresa.
"Evelyn Innes," an earlier story ,. by-
George Moore, is a prelude to this book.
"Sister Teresa." Evelyn, the leading char
acter of both books, became weary of her
life as a public singer and also decided
that she had been living an immoral life
as the mistress of Owen Asher, though she
positively refused to marry him; she went
each week to "retreat" in a convent, where
a contemplative order of nuns spent their
time in meditation anel adoration and in
keeping in order the paraphernalia for the
altar and the vestments for the visiting
priests. Tho order was in debt 8,0 and
in dancer of being turned out of the heme
at any time. Evelyn paid the debt and left
herself penniless, though counting on her
voice as a sure source of income should
she return to the world. The nuns seemed
to her extremely silly, and the rough fare
and rigid rules almost unbearable. But
sho finally took the veil and was named
Sister Teresa. Foubts as to her belief and
misgivings as to her call to a "vocation"
beset her before and after, and the ques
tion. "Does anotheruest lie before mo?
agitated her thoughts. The prioress died,
and Sister Teresa promised before lur
death to complete a history of the order
which they had begun together. Fiior to
this she had lost her voice through singing
for the prioress when her throat was af
fected and requited absolute rest. She fin
ished the history in six months and deter
mined then to escape from tho convent,
but when she had opened the outer door
she found that she no longer desired to re
turn to the world. Sho closed tho door and
took up her convent life. It is A sad and
unsatisfactory tdory. as Sister Teresa's
soul development Feems rather . soul
crushed and a life improved only a life
icriflced. The J. B. Lippincott Company,

Another pretty juvenile story added to
the "Cozy Corner" series is "Peggy's
Trial,' which tells of tho three motherless
children of a busy doctor. They get into
all kinds of scrapes, as motherless children
are apt to do, and are finally made very
hippy by the appearance of a "new step
mother," who turns out to be their beloved
Sunday-school teacher. The author is May

are by Etheland li. Barry.

The au-
riond-Tidr.
Sarah P. McL. Greene has produced a
new novel which ib even superior to "Vesty
of the Basins," strong praise for the first
named volume. It is a vigorous dramatic
story of primitive life in a fishing village
on the coast of Maine; a story not easy to
describe, a stery as full of wit as "Vesty."
There are strong contrasts drawn between
the simple, brave, beautiful native women
of the place and the fashionable, ladies of
the world who come to summer among
them. It is not a book to hurry through
to get at the ttory, but one to read delib
erately. The writer is a keen observer of
life, and she must have lived a long time
among the people of whom she writes to
be able to portray them ho well, ami so to
saturate her book with the atmosphere of
the place. Ono can almost feel "the wind
a-breezin' " and see the fisher people han
dling their boats, and. as they sail down
the bay, hear them call back their univer
sal watchword, which is, indeed, the key
note of the book: "Here's hopin' I" Har

A Ilook l- Mis Dasknm.
"The Imp and the Angel" contains seven
ttories in which the Imp is the hero. The
Imp id more a pet name than one of in
vective, as the leading traits of the little
boy thus nick-named are truth and fear
lessness joined to considerable self-assertion.
For - boy of less than eight years, he
is somewhat remarkable, but none tho less
agreeable. Indeed, he is lovable. The au
thor must havo met him in real life or
she could not havo pictured him so de
lightfully. It is a juvenile book, which
grown xeople will road to the little ones.

Robert Louis Stevenson' Accomplish

That Robert Louis Stevenson did not re
gard himself as born to his high calling,
but rather considered his achievements du
! to unceasing labor seems to follow from
the following bit of autobiography from his
life by Graham Balfour:
"All through my boyhood a.vl youth I
was known and pointed out for'the pattern
of an idler, and yet I was alwrys busy o.i
my own private end. which wa to learn to
write. 1 kept always two byoks in my
pocket one to read, one to write in. As I
walkeel my mind was busy fitting what I
saw with appropriate words; when 1 sat
by the roadsid" I would either read or
pencil and a penny version book would be
in my hand to note down the features of
the scene or commemorate some halting
stanzas.
"Thus I lived with words. And what I
thus wrote was. for no ulterior use; it was
written consciously for practice. It w;.s
iut so much that I wished to be an author
(though I wished that, toe) as that I ba4
vowed that I would learn to w?lte.
