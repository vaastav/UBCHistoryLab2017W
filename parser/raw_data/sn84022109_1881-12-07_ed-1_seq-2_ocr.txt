TDE PKLSIDuNTb MESSAGE
President Arthurs first message
to congress is presented to the
readers of the Examinkh this morn
ing Kead to the senate and house
yesterday afternoon it was after
ward transmitted to the press of the
country by wire and it was not
until a late hour last night that the
closing sheets of the rather lengthy
document were received Tele
graphic transmission may have im
paired the literal accuracy of a few
passages hut as a wholo wo feel con
fldent It appears in our columns
precisely as read in congress yester
day The message is a long ono J t
treats of every conceivable subject
within the fccope of presidential
purview Uomiug at the hour it
did we have found it im
practicable to accord it more than
the brielest consideration too brief
to he candid to attempt anything
in the nature ol a leview It merits
more leisurely and critical reading
We leel assured it will icpay perusal
President Arthuis English i at
once forcible ami graceful and to
die thoughtful and intelligent cit zen
this message will not prove weari
oine or insipid The circumstances
under which its author came to be
the head of the union no lens than
the earlier incidents of his nolitical
lile all combine to invent
his initial utterances and views
with a degree of interest
that has not attached to the state
papeis of many of his predecessors

A Washington special to the Coiu
lerJoiinnil says there aie seventeen
contests tiled lot seils in thu Mouse

these the republicans have deter
mined to press lor a speedy dccLiou
These are Lynch against Chalmers
in thu sixth Mississippi district
Lowe against Wheeler iu the eighth
Alabama and Jluckcy against
OConnor second South Caioliua
The southern republican members
in dickering with the various candi
diuates lor speaker hie made a
point of who slnll be on the com
mittee on elections They demand a
thoroughgoing radical partisan
for chaiiman ami at least
two of their own number and a
grecuhackcrfor members They have
nad no dilliculiy in getting promises
Irom each o the candidate that
si ccial attention will be paid to the
composition of this committee The
three cases mentioned will be taken
up at once and will bo reported to
get her It is expected that all the
greenback members will assist the
republican majority in rushing the
report through tdus adding two re
publicans anil one greenbacker to
the house rolls in the places ot three

Ollicial returns of the ccusus ot
Xew York city as regards popul i
tiou did dwellings havo been re
ceived The population 1200507
was known before The most in
structive item next to this is the
number of persons to a dwelling
10 37 which is not so large as might
have hecu supposed when we con
sider the multiplication of tenement
houses and of large apartment build
ings that has taken place duriug the
last decade The average number of
persons to a lamily 1 95 has re
mained about stationary being a
tiille greater than this iii 1870 and a
trille less iu 1875 The increase in
the number ot dwellings in ten years
is a little under 10000 and the in
crease in population a little more
than 250000 It appears thcrclore
whereas the dwellings of ten year
ago contained on the average less
than fifteen persons each those
which havo since beou added cer
tainly contain nearly twentylive
persons each supposing the old
ones to ho no more crowded now
than then raising the average tor all
the dwellings old and now to the
figure given above
