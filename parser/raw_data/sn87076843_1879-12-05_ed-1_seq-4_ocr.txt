Mepartmentsin Washington and in nnmlwr of
the cnsit.m-hoiiaea nil post-ollipea of the princi

preleoeinr, I think the rannomy, purity, and
efficiency of the pnblio service would he greatly
promoted bv their systematic introrliictiori.
wherever practicable, thmiiKhont the entire mvil
aerviee of the (toTcrnmcnt. together with ample
timviaion for their general snis-rviaion, in order
to secure conaietcnoy and uniform luetics.
Hcpnrta from ho Hc'rciary of the Interior,
from the Postmaster-Ov-noral. from the J'oat
maater in the eitv of New York, where ench ex
aminations have lecn Home time on trial, and also
from the Collector of the Port, the Naval Officer,
and the Surveyor in that city, and from the Post
masters and Collector in several of the other
large eitlea. how that the comctitive system,
where applied, nan. in various waya, contribu
ted to improve the public acrvico.
The reports show that the results have been
aalntarv in marked d.-irreo, ntl that the general
application of aimilar rules cannot fall to be ol
decided benefit to the acrvice. ...
The report of the Oovcrnment officers in the
city of New York especially, bear decided teati
monytothentility of open competitive rxamina
tiona in their rciective nllicea, showing that
" thcac cxaminations.'nnd thcexcellciitciualihca
tiona of thoao admitted to the service through
them, have had a marked incidental effect upon
the ieraona previmialy in the aervico, and par
ticularly fipnn those aspiring to promotion.
There has been, on the part of theae latter, an 111
nreaacd in tercet in the work, and a dcaire to ex
tend acquaintance with it beyond the particular
dw.lt orenpied, and thua the moral nf the entire
force haa been raised. The everninay
tiona have been attended by many citizens who
have bad an opportunity to thoroniihly inveeti
irnte the aeope and character of the tests and the
mcthnda of determining the results, and those
visitors have, without exception, approved the
mcthoda emploveil, and aeveral of tbcm have
publicly attcatel their favorable opinion.
Upon auchoonaidcrationa, 1 deem it ruy duty
to renew the recommendation contained in my
annual message, of December, 1877. ropiesting
Congress to make the necessary appropriation
for the resumption of the work of the Civil Ser
vice Commission. Kconomy will bo pnimoted by
snlhorisitig a moderate compensation to persons
in the publio acrvico who may perform extra la
bor nimn or under tho Commianion, aa the Kxec
ntivo may direct. . , . ...
I am convinced that if a Jnat and Bileojnatc teat
of merit ia enforced for admission to the public
aervicc and in making promotion, such etiiisea
aa rcmovala without good cauae and imrtiaan
and official interference with tho proper exer
cise of the appointing power, will in largo mcas
ure rliaapiiear. . . ,. .
There are other adminiatrativeabuaoa to which
the attention of Congraaa ahould be aaked in thia
connection. Mere partiaan appointmenta.and the
constant peril of removal without caiiac. very
naturally lead to an abaorlnng and mischievous
political activity, on the part of thoHO thua ap
pointed, which not only interfere with the due
.liecliargo of official duty, but la incompatible;
with the freedom of elections. Not without war
rant, in the vicwa of several of my pteileccaaora
in tho Presidential office, and directly within tho
law of ltfll.alrcady cited, I endcavon-d. by regula
tion, mado on tho Kit day of June, 1877. to put
some reasonable limits to such anuacs. It may
not bo easy, and it may never perhaps be necea
aary, to define with precision the proiajr limit of
political action on tho part of Federal officers.
Put while their right to hold and freely express
thoir opinions can not be ciuostioned, it is very
plain that thoy should neither lie allowed to do
vote to other subject the time needed for the
proper discharge of their official duties, nor to
nse the authority of their office to enforce their
own opinions, or to eoerco the Kilitical action of
those who hold ditTerentopinions.
Iteasons of justice and public policy, finite
analogous to those which forbid the use ot offi
cial power for the oppression of tho private citi
zen, impose upon tho t.ovcrnmcnt the duty of
protecting its officers and agenta from arbitrary
exactions. Iri whatever aspect considered, tho
practice of making levies, for 'party punoes.
iiiwn tho salaries of officers is highly doinoraliit
ing to the public service and discreditable to the
country. Though an officer should be as free as
any other citizen to give his own money 111 aid
of his opinion or his party, ho should also be aa
free aa any other citizen to refuse to make such
gifts. If'salariea are but a fair comjionsation
for the time and labor of the officer, it is a gross
injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are
made excessive in order that they may bear the
taxj the excess iB an indirect robbery of the pub-
'"1 recommend, therefore, anob. a revision and
extension of present Btatutes aa shall secure to
those in every grade of official life or public em
nl.tvmant the orotection with which a great and
enlightened Nation should guard those who are
taithtul in lta service.
OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREION COUNTRIES
With (I rout. ISriljuii there are still unsettled
questions, growing ont of the local lawa of the
msritime nrovincca and the action of provincial
authorities, deemed to be in derogation of right
seen red by treaty to American fishermen. The
United State Minister in London has been in
structed to present a demand for ifrlOo.WKi.OJ, in
view of the damages received Dy American citi
zens at Fortune Jiay on the (ith of January, lt78.
The subject has been taken into consideration
by the Uritish Government, and an early reply
in stil.iniiutted.
Upon iho completion of the necessary pre-
lllllllinry tJJtttl.l.llUHW.lt,, nui.jt.i-, tri. wiai -
tii'ioation in the provincial naheriea.a rtgiilatini
by treaty, will at once be brought to the atten
tion of the British Government with a view to
an early and permanent acttlemcnt ot the whole
iiuestion, which was only temporarily adjusted
by the Treaty of Washington. ,
Kifort have been made to obtain the rrnioval
of restrictions found injurious to theexporUtion
of cattle to the linitcu Kingdom.
Home eorrennondence has also occurred with
regard to the rescue and saving of life and prop
erty upon the lake, which has resulted in im
portant modifications ol the previous rivulatlons
ol the dominion uovrrniucni on toe sunject,
the intenwt of humanitv and commerce.
In accordance with the joint resolution of the
last session of Congress, Commissioners were
appointed to represent the United Mates at the
two International Exhibitions in Australia, one
of which is now in progress nt H.vdne.v, and the
other to be held next year ut Alelliouriie. A de
sire has been expressed by our merchants and
manufacturers interested in the inisirtant and
growing trade with Australia, that an increased
provision should be made by Congress for the
representation of our industries at the Mel
bourne Exhibition of next year, anil thesiihject
ia respectfully submitted to your favorable con
sideration.
The assent of the Government has been
given to the landing, on the coast of Massachu
setts, of a new and
INDEPENDENT THANH ATLANTIC CAHI.E
between France, by way of the French island of
Ht. Pierre, and this country, subject to any
future legislation of Congress on the subject.
The conditions imposed, Defore allowing this
connection with our sborea to be established, are
such as to secure it competition with any exist
ing or future lines of marine cable, and preclude
amalgamation therewith, to provide for entire
duality of right to our Government and peopl
with those of France in the use of the cable, and
prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege
aa accorded by Franoe to the disadvantage of any
future cable communication between Franceana
the United tttatea which mav be tirotnctAH
accomplished by our citizens. An important re-
nucuon or im present race or caoie communi
cation with Europe, felt to be too burdensome
to the interests of our commerce, must necessa
rily flow from the establishment of this compet
ing line.
The attention of Congress was drawn to the
propriety of some general regulation by Congress
of the whole subject of transmarine cable by my
predecessor in hia message of December 7, 1875,
and 1 respectfully submit to your consideration
the importance of Congressional action in this
matter.
The ijneations of grave importance with Spain
crowing out of the incident of
THE t't'BAN INHt'HUEtTION,
have been, for the most iart, happily and honor
ably aettled. It may reasonably be anticipated
that the Commission now sitting in Washington
for the decision of private cases, in thia connec
tion, will soon bo able to bring its labors to a
conclusion.
The long-standing question of East Florida
claims baa lately been renewed as a subject of
correspondence, and may possibly require Con
gressional action for its filial disposition.
A treaty with the Netherlands with resucct to
Consular right and privileges, similar to thoio
with other powers, has been aigned and rati-
ull1d. H"r ,rVm,t"m" """ exchanged
on i theaistof July aat. Negotiation for extra
dition treaties with the Netherlands and with
Denmark are now in progress.
Home iioestions with Switzerland, in regard to
pauper and convict emigrant, have ariacn. but
it is not doubted that they will be arranged upon
a Juat and satisfactory Wis. A question Vas
also occurred with respect to an asserted claim
by hwiaa municipal authorities to exercise tute
lage over persons and property of Bwiss citizens
naturalised in this country. It is possible this
may require adjustment by treaty.
With the German Empiro freiiuent questions
arise in connection with the subject of natur
alisation and expatriation! but the Imiatrial
Government haa constantly manifested a desire
to strictly maintain and comply with all treaty
stipulations in regard to theiu. J
Jn epiueuuenee of the omission of Congresa to
provide for a diplomatio representative at
Athena, the legation to Greece haa been with
drawn. 1 here is now no channel of diplomatio

It Is a gratification to be able to announce that,
through the Judicious and energetic action of the
military commanders of the two Nations on
eseh aide of the Hio Grande, nnder the inatrne
tiona of their reaiiective Governments, raids and
depredationa have greatly decreased, and, in the
localities where formerly miwt destructive, have
now almost wholly eeaaed. In view of this re
sult, 1 entertain a confident expectation that the
prevalence of ipiiet on the border will soon le
come so assured as to Justify a modification of
the present orders to our military commanders
as to creasing the border, without encouraging
such diatiirhaucca aa would endanger the peace
of the two countries.
The third installment of the sward airainat
Mexico nnder the Claima Commission of July 4,
lHirt, was duly paid, and haa been put in oourso
of distribution in pnrsuance of the act of Con
grcaa providing for the same. Thia aatiafactory
situation between the two countries leads me to
auticiimte an expansion of our trade with Mexi
co and an increased contribution of capital and
industry by our people to the development of
the great resources of that country. I earnestly
commend to the wiadom of t!ongres the provis
ion of suitable legislation hsiking to this result.
Diplomatic intereourae withOjonihia ia again
fully reatored bv the arrival of a Miniater from
that country to the United Htatea. Thia is es
pecially fortunate in view of the fact that tho
qmation of an intena'cBnie canal has recently
assumed a new and important aspect, and is now
nnder diacuasion with the Ontral American
countries through whiwo territory the canal, by
the Nicnragua route, would have to (was. It ia
trusted that enlightened atatesmanahip on their
part will see that the early prosecution of
such a work will Isrgely inure to tho benefit
not only of their own citizens and those of
the United State, but tho commerce of the civ
ilised world. It is not doubti-d that should the
work be undertaken nnder the protective aus
pice of the United States, and upon satisfactory
concessions for the right of way .and its security,
by theCentral American governments, tho cap
ital for it completion would be readily furnished
from this country and Europe, which might,
falling such guarantees, provo inaccessible.
Diplomatic relations with Chili have also been
atrengtnened by the reception of ajMinister from
that country.
The war between Tern. Bolivia and Chili atill
continues. The United States have not deemed
it projer to interpose in the matter, further than
to convey to all the Governments concerned the
assurance that the friendly offices of tli Govern
ment of the United States for tho restoration of
peace upon an honorahle basis will be extended,
in esse the beligcrenta shall exhibit a readiness
to accept them.
Cordial relations eontinne with Brazil and the
Argentine Hepublic, and trade with these coun
tries ia improving. A provision for regular and
moro f reiiiieut mail communication, in our own
ships, between the isirt of this country and the
Nations of South America seems to me to deserve
the attention of Congress, ss an essential pro
cursor of an enlargement of our commerce with
thm, and an extension of our carrying trade.
A recent revolution in Venezuela has been fol
lowed by tho establishment of provisional
Government. This Government hBS not yet
been formally recognized, and it i s deemed do
sirablo to await the procd action of the peo
ple, which is exjiected to give it the sanction of
constitutional forms.
A naval vessel has been sent to the Hamoan
Islands to make surveys and take possession of
the privilegea ceded to the United States by
Samoa, in the harbor of Pago Pago. A coal
ing atation is to ho established there, which
wul be convenient and useful to United States
vessels.
The subject of opening diplomatic relations
with lloumania and Scrvia. now become inde
pendent sovereignties, is at present under con
iderntion, and is the subject of diplomatic correspondence.
There ia a
(HlATlFVINf! INCREASE Or TRADE
with nenrly all European and American eoun
trica and it ia believed that with judicious ac
tion in regard to its development it can and will
be still more enhanced, and tLat American prod
ucts and manufacturers will find new and ex
panding markets. The reports of diplomatic and
consular officers uimn this subject, under the
system now adopted, have resulted in obtaining
much valuable information, which has been and
will continue to be laid before Coiigrca and tho
public from time to time.
The third article of the treaty with Hnsaia, of
March 80. 1807, by which Aluska was ceiled to the
United States, provides that tho inhabitant of
tho ceded territory, with the excoption of the un
civilized native trine, shall be admitted to the
enjoyment of all the rights of citizena of the
United States, and shall be maintained ami pro
tected in the free enjoyment of their liberty,
proierty and religion. The uncivilized tribea
are subject to such laws and regulations as the
u i-. i Ktotc mnw. fr4"? .ti.H'e d.-.k lu
regard to the aboriginal tribes of that country.
Both the obligation of this treaty and the
necenfliiie or me ieopie, require mat some or
ganized form of Government over the Territory
of Alnaka lieadontcd.
Thereappcar to be no law for the arrest of
persons chsrged with common-law offences, such
as assault, robbery and murder, and no magis
trate authorized to isniie or execute process in
auch cases. Serious difficulties have already
arisen from offence of thia character, not only
among the original inhabitants, but among citi
zens of the United States and other countries
who have engaged in mining, fishing and other
business nnerationa within the Territory. A
bill authorizing the appointment of Justice ot
the pence and constables, and the arrest and de
tention of persons charged with criminal of
fences, and providing lor an appeal to United
Statca Courts for the District of Oregon, in suita
ble easm, will, at a proper time, be submitted to
Congress.
The attention of Congress is called to the an-
nnai

The large amount exjiended for arrenrs of pen
sions during the Inst and the present fiscal year
amounting to 21.747,WJ.fi(), has prevented the
application ot tne tun amount required by law
to the sinking fund for the current year; but
these arrears having been substantially paid, it
is believed that the sinking fund can hereafter
be maintained without any change of existing
law.
The Secretary of War report that
THE WAR
estimstes for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881,
are 40m4.i, tne same being for a less sum
of money than any annual estimate rendered
Umgreaa from that department during a period
of at least twelve years.
He concurs with the General of the Army in
recommending such legislation aa will authorize
the enlistment of the full number of 2S.KKJ men
for the line of tht Army, exclusive of the 3.403
men required for detached duty, and, therefore,
not available for service in the field,
lie also recommends that Congress be asked to
provide bv law for the disposition of a large
number of abandoned military posts and reser
vations, which, though very valuable in them
selves, have been rendered uaelesa for military
purpose by the advance of civilization and set
tlement. He unites with the Quartermaster-General in
recommending that an appropriation be mado
for the construction of a cheap and perfectly
tire-proof building for tho aafe atorage of a vast
amount of money accounts, vouchers, claima
and other valuable reoords now in the Quartermaster-General's
office, and exposed to gn at risk
of total destruction by fire.
.He also recommends, in conformity with the
views of the Judge-AdviH-ato General, aomo
declaratory legislation in reference to the mili
tary statute of limitations as applied to the crime
of desertion
In these several recommendations I concur.
Iho Secretary of War further report that tho
WL,,rr, tl!e "npro'oment of the South Pass of
the Mississippi River, under contract with Mr.
James 11. EadB, made in pursuance of an act of
Congress, has been prosecuted during the past
year with a greater measure of success in tho at
tainment of result than during any previous
year, ihe channel through the South Pass,
which, at the beginning of operations in
June, 1875, had a depth of only seven
and one-half feet of water, had. on the
8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth of
twcnty-ai feet, having a width of not less
than two hundred feet and a central depth
of thirty feet. Payment have been made in ac
cordance with the statute, aa the work prog
ressed, amouuting in the aggregate to 4,250,000:
and further payment will become due. as pro
vided by the statute, in the event of success in
maintaining the channel now secured.

of the current appropriation. The report of the
Secretary show the gratifying fact that among
all the disbursing officer of tho pay corps of the
Navy there is not one who i a defaulter to the
extent of a single dollar. I unite with him in
recommending the removal of the Observatory
to a more healthful location. That institution
reflects credit uian the Nation, and has obtained
the approbation of scientific men in all part of
the world. It removal from it present location
would not only be conducive to the neaitn oi it

THE APPROPRIATION FOR JUDICIAL EXPENSES.
which h heretofore ment
of Justice, in grosa, was sub-divided at the

whatever was maxle for the istymcnt of the fece
of Marahal and their Deputiea, either in the

continued tho performance of their dutiea,
without compensation from the Govern
ment, taking upon themselves the necessary in
cidental outlays, aa well aa rendering their own
nervier. In only few unavoidable instances
haa the proer execution of the process of the
United State failed by reason of the absence of
the requisite appropriation. This course of
official conduct on tho imrt of thoe officer,
highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by
the Attorney General, who informed them, how
ever, that they would necessarily have to rely for
their oomiienaation uisin the prospect of future
legiaiatlon ny tjongreaa. i toereioro i-ssf -isiiy

No nnnroorintion wns made for this Plirixmc for

wns a matter of little practical iinisirtaiice.
Such election will, however, tako placo during

The exnendit.ures during the vcar were $801

compensation of postmasters from a commis

The relations of the Deoartment with railroad
cninitanica have been harmonized, notwithstand
ing the general reduction by Congress of their
compensation, by the appropriation for special
facilities, and the railway lmst-oftice lines have
been greatly extended, especially in the South
ern States. The interest of the railwnv-niail
service and of the public would be greatly pro
moted, and the exitcnditures could be more
readily controlled by tho classification of the
employes of the railway-mail service sb recom
mcnilcd by the Pontmaster General, the appro
priation for salaries, with reaiect to which the
maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be
mado in cross.
The Postmaster General recommends an
amendment ot the law regulating the in
crease of compensation for increased service
and increased speed on star routes, so as
to enahlo bim to advertise for proposal for
Mich increased service and speed. Ho also
suggests tho advantages to accrue to the com
merce of thecountrv from the enactment of
f:encral law authorizing contracts with American
illilt steamer, carrying the American Mag, for
trniiHiKirting the mail between porta of the
tinted States anil isirts ot the West Indies and
South America, unda fixed maximum price per
mile, the amount to bo eMndcd being regu
lated by annual apprnpriation, in like manner
with the amount paid for the domestic star serv
ice. The arrangement made by the l'otmaster
General and the Secretary ot the Treasury for
the collection of duty uim bmiks received in the
mail from foreign countries, has proved so satis
factory in its practical osration that the recom
mendation is now made that Congress shall ex
tend the provisions of the act of March 3, 1879,
under which this arrangement waa made, so as
to apply to all other dutiable articles received in
the mails from foreign countries.
The report of tho Secretary of the Interior
and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, set
ting forth the present state of our relations with
the Indian tribea of our territory, the measures
taken to advance their civilization and nronjx'ri
ty, and the progress already achieved by them,
will be found of more than ordinary interest.
The general conduct of the Indian isipulation
haa been ao satisfactory that the occurrence of
two disturbances, which resulted jn bloodshed
and destruction of property, is all the more to
be lamented.
The history of
THE Oin uitEAK ON THE WHITE RIVER t)TE RESERVA
TION in Western Colorado has become so familiar by
elaborate reisirta in the public press that its re
markable incident nci-d not be stated here in
detail. It is exiiected that the settlement of this
difficulty will lead tosuch arrangements will
prevent further hostile contact between the In
dians and the border settlements in Western
Colorado.
The other disturbance occurred at the Mea
calero Agenoy, in New Mexico, where Victono,
the head of a small band of marauder, after
committing many atrocities, being vigorously
chased by a military force, made his way acrosa
the Mexican border and is now on foreign soil,
, While those occurrences, in which a comiiara
tively amull number of Indians were engaged,
are most deplorable, a vast majority of
our Indian population have fully justi
fied the expectations of those who believe
that by humane and peaceful iutlu
etices the Indian can hu led lo abandon the
habits of savage life and to develop a capacity for
useful and civilized occupations. Wind they
have already accomplished in the pursuit of
agricultural and mechanical work, the remarkable
success which has alttnded the experiment of
employing as freighters a class of Indians hitherto
counted among the wildest and most intractable,
and the general and urgent desire expressed by
them for Ihe education of their children, may hu
taken aa eiillidont proof that they will bo found
capable uf accomplishing. much more
they euiitiniiu to be wisely and fairly
guided. The "Indian policy'' sketched in
the report of the Secretary of the Interior,
the object of which is to make liberal provision
for the education of Indian youth, to settle tin In
dians iihju farm-lots In severalty, to give Ihein
title In fee to their faru.s. inalienable for a certain
number of years, and when their wants are thus
provided for, to dispose by sale of the lands ou
their reservations uot occupied ami used by them,
a fund to be formed out of the proceeds for the
heuerlt of the Indians, which will gradually re
lieve the Government of Ihe expenses now provid
ed for by annual sppropriatious, must counneud
itself ss just aud beuencial to the Indians, and as
also calculated to leiuove those obstructions
which the existence of lare reservations preseuts
to the settlement and development of the country.
I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of
a law cuablliig the Government to give Indians
title in fee, lualieiiable for twenty-live years, to
the farm lands assigned to them by allotment.
also repeat the recomiueudatlun made lu uiy first
annual message, that a law be passed admitting
Indians who cau give satisfactory proof of having
by their own labor, supported their families fora
uumber of years, and who are w illing lo detach
themselves from their tribal relatlous. lo the benefit
uf the homestead act, aud to grant theiupateuts
containing the same provision of Inalienability
for a certain period.
The experiment of sending a number of Indian
children, of both sexes, to the Hampton Normal
aud Agricultural institute, lu Virginia, to receive
au elementary Bngllsb educatiou and practical In
struction In farming and other useful Industries,
has led to results so prumlslug that It was thought
expedient to turu over the i avail y barracks at
Carlisle, In Pennsylvania, to the Interior Depart
nieut for the establishment of an Iudiau school ou
a larger scale. Ibis school has now oue hundred
aud Afty-elght pupils, selected from various tribes,
aud Is in full operation. Arrangements are also
made for the educatiou of a number of ludian
boys snd girls belouglug to tribes ou the Pscille

Oregon. These iuslitiitioui will commend them
selves to the liberality of Congress, aud lo the

promote their progrena In civilization and pros

present state of thing In the Territory.
1 lie question wntjincr huiihiikd "..
the Indian aervlee should be nwrte waa lu the
Knrtv llflh Tenures referred to a joint Committee
of both House for Inquiry and roiwirt. In my
last annual message I expressed the hoM) that the
derision of that question. the In prospect,
"would arrest runner agitation mo snuieci,
auch agitation being apt to produce a disturbing
effect upon the service a well as the Indians
themselves." Since then, the committee having
reported, the question has heifl decided In the
negstive by a vote In the Ibpse of Kepresonta-
Kor the reason here stated Rd In view of the
fact that further uncertnlnt on this point will be
ralnilated to obstruct olhe much-needed legisla
tion, to weaken the dlsoplliie of Ihe service, and
to unsettle suliitary men-urea now in progress ior
the government snd lmrovement of the Indians,
1 respectfully recomiiKiid that the decision arrived
nt by Congress at Itr last session be permitted to
stand.
The efforts ninrte by

lo arrest Ihe diprcihitlone on limber bind of the

with consldirnblo aucceea. A lnrgu number of

purpose. A nore Important result, however, con
sist in ine tan inntino destruction oi our puiiiic
forests bv denudation, although such ciisea still
occur, haa heel greatly reduced In extent, and It
is probable that If the present policy is vigorously
pursued Biid sufficient provision to that
end I mado y Congnss, such trespasses,
at least tluxe on a large scale,
can be entirely suppressed, ixccpt In tho Terri
tories where timber for the diily requirement of
Ihe population cannot, under tie present state of
the law, lie otherwise ohluiicn. I therefore
earnestly Invite the attention o congress to tno
recommendation made by the Secretary of the
Interior, that a Inw be enacted einhlliig tho Gov
ern nieut to sell timber from the uibllcland with
out conveying the fee, where such lands ore
nrincloallv valuable for the timber thereon, such
sales lo be so regulated ns to cosortn to domestic
wnnt and business reiititrumeils, while at tho
snine time guarding against a sweeping destruc

appears to become a mure yrossjif; necessity

My recommendations In former messages are re

we have enjoyed In recent year, that we are
mainly Indebted for our present prosperity as a

is no branch of Industry in which hbor, directed
by scientific knowledge, yields suchincreascd pro

port of the Commissioner, with a viw to placing
the Department upon a footing whld will enable
It to prosecute more effectively te.objects for
which it is established.
Appropriations are needed for a rrire complete

division, and a division of forestry, .nd for au in

The requirements for these and nper purposes.
Indicated in the report of IheConisvsslouer under
