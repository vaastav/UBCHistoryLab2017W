Musical Comedy Success.
'Paupu- naturully suppose that the!
secret ot a successful musical comedy," j
said Vattl Valli, who takes the title;
-oio in the "Dollar Princess**, is that !
he music be catchy and the comedy j
caPy funny. Of course a musical com- j
r»ly to be successful must be funny, {
it must well acted and well sung, j
bvi even if it be very funny and well,
acted and sung besides, it will not be j
g success of the first class without one'
thing that is not generally understood •
It niu*.t have a plaintive, appealing. I
sweet note in it. It is an old saying)
Unit laughter and tears are very close!
to one another That saying is true
In ;• musical comedy we cannot have
situations or lines that appeal tn
■ertotu feelings, but we can have
melodies that touch the finer, deeper
notes and every great musical comedy J
success tha f I can remember had just!
this feature. Consider the lullaby in
'I'lrniine,' the plaintive minor, waltz
in 'The Merry YVlidow,' and again the
waltz that I atng in the 'Dollar Prin
cess.' These are all proofs of my
theory." *

rule at:d she abides by it. She really
believes that her opinions do not in

of the great New York dailies called at
li Prohmac offices and asked where

wished to devote the entire front page'
of the Christmas number to an inter-J

Not an Eleventh Hour Surprise, But Facts Taken From the
City Tax Rolls and Sworn to by the City Clerk
The statement of the "Drys" in Sunday's Bulletin is misleading and reflects on the honesty of the present city administration. In that statement they make claim that the business is net
handled in a business manner, and that the city needs a larger body of its ablest business men in charge of its administration.
The condition of the business affairs of the City of Walla Walla prove beyond question that its affairs are now being administered in an economical way, and from a purely business stand
point by men who were schooled in the business world and have been successful in their private undertakings.
The business men's committee is composed of those citizens of Walla Walla who have likewise been successful in their private affairs. They have studied conditions of the west and know
how to meet them. Their financial standing proves their wortli to the community as being among the most desirable of any class of citizens a municipality can boast of. They are the men
who have made Walla Walla and are interested in its advancement. Today one member alone of that committee is paying five times more taxes into the city treasury than are all the members
composing the Prohibition committee. His property interests represent five times that of all the members of the said "Dry" committee.
The men who are fighting for a greater Walla Walla are the men who have made it what it is and they are going to make it bigger and better yet. Your interests are identical with theirs
for as Walla Walla grows so does the interests of every one of its inhabitants improve.
The following comparison taken from the Tax Roll of 1909 is authentic as shown by the affidavit of the city clerk and demonstrates the business worth of the men who have taken opposite
views of the Prohibition question:
The Five Members of the Prohibition Committee Pay the Fol- Three Members of the Business Men's Committee Pay the
lowing Respective Amounts: Following Respective Amounts:
Real Estate Personal Real Estate Personal
Dr. J. W. Summers . None $5.75 Robert H. Johnson $143.50 $135.50
S3 iZ *»■*> •
Dr. C. E. Montgomery None $1.13 (delinquent) • Geo. Ludwigs $726.53
Harvey McDonald $27.00 $1.12 <
Total $136.12 $6.00 Total $968.73 $141.90
The above statement shows the worth of the men. The business men representing the "Wets" are for business on sound business principles. They would have the city's affairs administ
ered on the same business basis as they conduct their private affairs.
That the conditions of the city are on a sound financial basis is proven by the annual report of the city clerk which shows that the assets amount to $1,816,064.65 while the liabilities are
$1,136,768.84, excess of assets over liabilities $679,295.81.
The affairs have been administered in an economical and satisfactory manner. Why try the untried for that which has been tried and not found wanting? Vote for License and Regula
tion in preference to no license and an untried policy.

SUGAR FREIGHT WAR
HAS BEEN PREDICTED
NEV7 YORK. Dec. 20.—A freight rate
war of far-reaching effect is predicted
in some quarters as a result of the
reudcetion of sugar rates put intr
effect today by the Eastern Trunk
Liino association, as an answer to the
challenge of Southern roads. Under
the r.( w schedule the eastern roads
reduce the rates on sugar destined for
St. la' vis, Mississippi and Missouri
river places west to 20 cents a hun
dred pounds, a reduction of eight
cents a hundred from the previous
schedule. Rates to .#itermediate des
tinations will not bo affected.
This action on the part of the east
ern trunk lines follows a 4 cent re
duction by roads out of New Orleans or
sugar consigned to places in the Cen
tral Freight Association territory.
This territory, roughly, comprises the
quadrangle between Buffalo, Pitts
burg, the Ohio river, St. Louis and
Chicago.
Hitherto rates have been so adjust
ed that this central country was j
served by the trunk lines running!
from the Atlantic seaboard, while
places south and west were appor
tioned to the roads out of New j
Orleans. The Centra! Freight asso- |

?arded as geographically belonging to
the eastern roads, as the haul thither
Is a?*nrt one-third Jess in distance
than from Ww Orleans.
The assertion has been made that
the southern lines, headed by the
Illinois Central, are reaching out for
business to which they are not en
titled for the sake of developing the
refineries along their lines at the ex
pense of the New York refineries
The eastern trunk lines have there
fore drawn up a schedule designed
to encroach on the territors' of the
New Orleans roads for the doe'
pose of carrying the war into Africa
and of opening new markets for the
eastern refiners, to compensate them
for the markets lost by the introduc
tion of New Orleans sugar.
Sugar forms a very important part
of the westbound freight traffic of the
trunk lines, its volume being esti
mated at from 27 to 40 per cent of
the total freight sent inland. This
tonnage is virtually unaffected, as the
8-eent reduction applies only to sugar
sent into territory which has pre-;
viously been closed to eastern pro
ducers. •' " '' !-T j
The idea takes its rise in the con
vention of Massachusetts ministers, an
organization which includes both or
thodox and liberal ministers. It is al
most the only organic survival of the
period previous to the Unitarian de
parture. This venerable organization
holds two slimly attended meetings on
anniversary week and also cares for
a small fund which inues to the. ad
vantage of certain needy, clergymen.

SPIRITUAL BOQUET
FOR JOHN GLENNON
ST LOUIS, Dec. 20.—Arehbisnop
John J. G'.er.non received a "spiritual
bouquet" of prayers and masses today,
in commemoration of the silver anni
versary of his ordination. He was or
dained to the priesthood just 25 years
ago today, and in a quarter of a cen
tury has become one of the most fa
mous Catholic churchmen in the Unit
ed States, while his fame extends
throughout the world. The clergy of
Missouri had planned for an elaborate
celebration cf the occasion, but tne
archbishop declared that he desired
no public demonstration in his honor.
Desirous of following the arch
bishop's wishes and yet not wishing
to let the anniversary pass entirely
unheeded, the committee has asked the
clergy and laity o? the diocese to pre
sent a spiritual bouquet of prayers
and masses in honor of the arch
bishop's silver jubilee. This will be
similar to the "spiritual bouquet"
which St. Louis made up at the time
of the Pope's jubilee. Schools and con
vent communities, individuals and
prfests, all can take part in the exer
cises, all doing their part to make up
the whole.
INSURGENTS GIVEN
THE CHILLY MITT
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 20.—
An Arctic frigidness pervades the
White House these days toward the
c.ass of representatives and senators
commonly termed insurgents. Wamn
and balmy as the air may be outside
a genuine Cook-Peary atmoppherf is
in evidence in the executive mansion
likely to tax the accommodations of
the hall. It was designedly put on the
day before Forefathers' with the pur
pose of emphasizing the part which a
free church-, has had in the making of
JCew England. I
Dr. Arthur Little is to preside and
the speakers will be Samuel A. Elliot,
president of the American Unitarian
association, and Professor Williston
Walker, whose address on "Changes
In Theological Thought in the Last
Half Century" was one of the re
markable features of the celebration
it the Old South church last April of
Or. Gordon's quarter centennial.

Besides this, the committee will
present to the archbishop an illumin
ated address commemorial of the oc
casion, and also a Latin ode written
by Father Holweck and an English
poem by Rev. John Rothensteiner.
'Then will follow a gift of an elaborate
silver service. This gift is in full
keeping with the dignity of the occa
sion. These remembrances will be
presented to the archbishop at his
house during the afternoon. This
morning, following the ordinations at
Kendrick Seminary, the seminary pre
sented a small entertainment in the
archbishop's honor, presenting him
also with an address.
Archbishop Glennon was ordained
to the priesthood December 20, 1884.
in Kansas City by Bishop Hogan. As
a young priest he served at the cathe
dral in Kansas City and afterward
became vicar general and then coad
jutor bishop to Bishop Hogan in Kan
sas City. He was transferred to St.
Louis, April 27, 1903, as coadjutor
to Archbishop Kfkir., and became arch
bishop of St. Louis, October 13, 1903,
that being the date. of Archbishop
Kain's death.
when the avowed opponents of the
"organization" show up.
One of the first of the insurgents to
experience the cold storage treatment
was Senator LaFolkaie of Wisconsin,
who, upon his arrival for the opening
of the session of congress called at the
'White House to pay his respects to
the president. LaFollette sat in th(
congressional waiting room some hours
Finally one of the president's secre
taries left the sanctum sanctorum ant
thus br ke the news to the Wisconsin
man: "The president is very, verj
busy, and he will not be able to sec
you today. In fact he won't be able tr
see you this week. He may bo aoif
to talk to you some day next week."
The little Wisconsin senator arose
with becoming dignity and departed
remarking calmly that he would see
the president—when the president saw
fit to send for him.
Senator Dol'ivor, of lowa, another
insurgent leader, met a similar recep
tion, and he left with the observation
that when he called again if would
only be on the invitation of the presi
dent. Several other opponents of the
Aldrich-Cannon regime have been sim
ilarly turned down at the executive of
fices, and they are much chagrined.
But the frigility of the White House
atmosphere is not the only thing thai
troubles the insurgents. There s th* 1
all important matter of federal patron
age.
Before Senator Dolliver became
prominent in the insurgent movement,
one of his constituents, for years a fed
eral office holder in Washington, was
promised a reappointment. Recently
it was announced that the Dolliver
man is to go. LaFollette has had sim
ilar experiences.
Preparations for the coming insur
gent struggle at the Capitol continue
Regulars and insurgents are girding
up their loins for the big fight, and
soon the battle will be on. Postal
franks to the right of 'em, franks iv
the left of 'em, franks to the whole
country vyill soon be carrying broad
cast the ammunition for merry wr«r
without cost to the congressmen on
the opposing sides. The first assau't
of the regulars has already been made
and the progressives are planning to
return the attack.
The policy of the machine republi
cans was outlined in Speaker Can
non's speech in- Kansas City, in which
he declared war on the insurgents.
