The a£senililirtg of the Irst regular session

At noon the clerk of the house, Adams,

service.
the srEAKcn'a abdiiess.
Speaker Keifer, when the applause had
subsided which grattc-d his appearance at the
speaker's desk, spoke as follows:
Gentlemen of the house of representatives, I
thank you with heartfelt gratitude, for the
distinguished honor conferred on me by my
election as your sneaker. I will assume the
powers of this high'offiee with, I trust, a due
share of diffidence and distrust of my own
ability to meet them acceptably to yon and to
the country. I believe that you,' as a body
and as individuals, will give me hearty sup
port in vhe discharge of my duties. I promise
to dev»te myself faithfully and assiduously
to the work before me. I invoke you
and the country's charitable judgment
on all my official acts. I will strive to be
just to all, regardless of party or section.
Where party principle is involved I will be
found to be a Republican, but in all other re
spects I hope to bo able to act free from party
ties. It b a singular fact, that at this most
prosperous time in our national history, no
party in either b.-anch of congress has an
absolute majority over all otner parties,
and it is therefore peculiarly fortunate that at
no other time since, and for many years prior
to the accession of Abraham Lincoln to the
executive chair, has there been so few unset
tled vital questions of a national chararcter,in
relation to which party lines have been closely
drawn. The national prosperity of the people
is in advance of any other period in the his
tory of our government. Violence of party
spirit has" subsided, and many of
the reasons for its existence are gone. "While
the universal tendency of the people is to
sustain and continne to build upon this un
paralelled prosperity, it should De our highest
aim t* permanently promote and not cripple
it. This congress should be, and I profoundly
hope will be, marked peculiarly as a business
congress. It may be true that additional laws
are jet necessary to cive to every citizen the
complete and peaceable exercise of all his
political rights, but with evenly balanced
party power, with few grounds for party
strife, aod with no impending presidential
election to distract us from purely legislative
duties, I venture to suggest the preseut as an
auspicious time to enact laws to guard against
a recurrence of the dangers to our institutions
and insure tranqnility at perilous times in the
future. Again thanking you for tbe honor
conferred, ard again invoking your aid and
generous judgment, lam ready to take the
oath prescribed by the law and the constitu
tion, and forthwith proceed, with my best
ability, guided by a sincere and honest pur
pose, to discharge tlie duties belonging to the
office to which you have elected me. (Great
applause.)
The work of swearing in members was com
menced, Alabama being the first state called.
Jones (Texas) objected to the oath being ad
ministered to Jas. Wheeler, of Alabama, and
asked that I o be compelled to stand aside.
Mr. Randail asked the reason for this ac
tion. The speaker stated that the matter
would be postponed until the oath had been
administered to the other members. Mr. Ran
dall contended that the eentleman could not
be compelled to stand aside, but might do so
if he desired, and it was fin&lly decided he
should stand aside until the members to whom
there was no objection were sworn.
Mr. Sprineer objected to the swearing in of
Catts, of Iowa; Van Vorhes, of New York;
King, of Louisiana, and Moore, of Tennessee,
which caused a good deal of laughter. All of
these gentlemen stood aside. Objections were
further made to the qualifying of Wadsworth,
Van Vorhes, Dibbles and Moore, of Tennessee.
After the work of swearing members to whom
there was no objection had been con
cluded, the case of Wheeler was taken
up but as he had prima facie right to the seat
there was no strenuous objection made and he
was finally allowed to qualify. All o. jections
with the exception of that against Chalmers
and against Dibbles, having been withdrawn,
the gentlemen were sworn in.
Mr. Moore offered a resolution referring
Chalmer's case to the committees on elections,
when appointed, but on motion of Townsend,
of Illinois, the resolution was laid on the table
and the oath of office administered to Chalmers.
The oath of office was also administered to
Dibble, and Speaker Keifer announced the roll
of the house completed. All the Republican
caucus nominees for house offices were then
elected and sworn in, Chaplain Powers by
special vote. Hiscock, Orth and Reagan were
appointed a committee to wait on the presi
dent. Adjourned.

MRS LINCOLN.
A Reporter Describes Her Style of living.
[New York Dramatic News.]
The widow of Abrham Lincoln is lead
ing a lonely and almost neglected life in
this city. In the two-pair back room of
a combined Turko-Russo-Electro bath es
tablishment and hotel on West Twenty
sixth street, she passes a dull and suffer
ing existence on a sofa, supported with
pillows. Her room is plainly furnished.
Her wants are ministered to by hired ser
vants, and these even she cannot choose,
or have always with her, because of the
expense. In* fact, the loved and honored
wife of the man who, more than all oth
ers, since Washington, the country has
pretended to delight in honoring, is seem
ingly sunk in oblivion, and is permitted
to be poor.
Mrs. Lincoln was recently visited -by a
reporter of the Dramatic Neics. He was
presented to a lady, who, but for the
traces of suffering on her face, would
seem not above fifty years of age. She
was attired in the deep mourning that
she donned-af ter the 15 th of April, 1865.
She possesses an excellent memory, and
her ideas were clearly and unmistakably
expressed. Various accounts of \ Mrs.
Lincoln's mental condition, some going
to the extreme of alleging insanity, have
been current in different newspapers
throughout the land, and the continuous
reprint has gained credence through con
stant reiteration. Whatever may
have been, there was nothing in the
Mrs. Lincoln that the Dramatic News re
porter met to cause a suspicion of aught
but a mind well balanced, together with
occasional flashes of a native spirit that
adversity and physical affliction have not
succeeded in breaking, and a keen con
sciousness of being left studiously alone.
Mrs. Lincoln remembers the quondam
friends to her once puissant, husband and
herself, and she does not forget that they
have shamefully forgotton both her and
the martyr's memory.
Mrs. Lincoln related many interesting
reminiscences of their once happy home
life.
"After that terrible calamity in Wash
ington," she said, "my health was seri
ously affected. Then .afterward came
the affliction of my son's health. This
was bad enough, but, by some strange
fatality, I was maligned, and made an
object for bitter sayings. It was to escape
this unmerited and incomprehensible
abuse that I went abroad. Misfortune
had not ceased to follow me, for one day
I had a fall, striking my spine upon a
sofa, sustaining a terrible, and I am
convinced almost beyond hope, a lasting
injury. I have nevfcr felt well for a
day. Since my return 1 have made a
visit to Springfield, 111., and I never ex
pect to make another. The rest of the
time I have spent in New York. My son,
Robert, who is in the cabinet, and his
wife, Mary, visit me as often as possible,
once every two or three weeks. It is
true they have asked me time and agais,
to go to Washington, but, much as 1
would like to be with them and their
three dear little children, I do not think
1 can ever wish to go to Washington
again. Besides, the tenure of official
position is uncertain. They do not
know themselves whether they will re
main there or not, and I know they have
not more than they need for themselves,
living on the scale they are obliged to.
He has, besides his salary, only the result
of his practice, and he is a young man
yet."
"He has his father's name," said the
reporter softly, feeling that the thought
inspired him with reverence.
"1 am here under the care of Dr. Lewis
A. Sayre, and of ht3 kindness 1 cannot
say enough. He is truly one of my oldest
friends. We were children together at
school in Lexington, Ky. My life has
little to lighten it, Avere it not for a few
of the ladies in the house who sometimes
kindly come in to see me, and Dr. Miller,
who has this establishment,and does all he
can to make me comfortable. I feel as
if my life depended upon these electric
baths. On Sunday I cannot take the
treatment, and 1 get very weak and low
spirited because of it. lam entirely de
pendent upon others to move about. I
cannot walk without the support of a
strong arm to my back. I am daily
borne down the staircase to the baths,
and up to my room again by a colored
boy who works here. He does his task
cheerfully, and is my main reliance. I
cannot get fresh air, which in this sea
board climate would do me good."
"I should think that you would make
the most of this bracing weather in
riding?" suggested the reporter.
"I cannot, because I feel it is beyond
my means. Everything is so expensive
here, and yet I cannot live elsewhere and
have the advantages of these baths. I
do not feel that I can have a waiting
maid entirely for my own service. This
room and the baths together cost me $200
per month. Then my meals, which must
be brought to me, since I cannot go to
them, are proportionately expensive.
First class medical treatment in New
York costs a large sum, so that you can
easily believe my income, although it
may seem large to those who are not
acquainted with the expenses of living
in large cities, and especially of what it
costs a helpless invalid, gives me cause
for anxiety. If my husband had lived I
would have never been obliged to- think
of money. I have said to him in the days
when he was in office, and when he would
spend money with others with unlimited
generosity, 'Husband, have a care, or you
will go out of this office in debt*' He
would answer that when his term ex
pired he would resume his law
practice, and could in a few years provide '
for our old age. And he would, too; my
husband could never live without work
ing." Mrs. Lincoln's existing income, all
told, cannot exceed $3,500 or $4,000. Any
one having knowledge of the cost of
living as she is living now, even with the
economy of inhabiting a "two-pair back"
room, together with the constant attend
ance of a first-class and fashionable M.
D., will know that the invalid widow of
the martyred president has need to worry
for the future.
In Mankato the other day while thrash
ing wheat, two young men by the name of
Thorstad and Samuel Cookson, were cut
ting apart with axes outside tiers of
frozen bundles, when the ax of Cookson
accidentally glanced and struck Thorstad
in the side "of the head, making an ugl,
gash. The blow rendering him uncon
scious, briefly, and was thought to be
fatal, and would have been, had the blow
been received on the top of the head.

WASHINGTON.
Text of Sherman'* Funding Bill and the
Garland Tariff Windom to be In
vestlgated—Republican Caucus— Another
" Crank," Claiming to he the "True
Messiah "—Miscellaneous.
' ALL A MISTAKE.
Washington, Dec. s.— Martinez, the Chil
ian minister here, received to-day a cable dis
patch from Vienna, secretary of the Chilian
legation at Paris, calling his attention to a
paragraph published in the London Standard,
December Ist, and republished In the United
States, in which Secretary Vicuna is reported
to have said the Chilians had suppressed Cal
deron's government, to which the United
States had extended special patronage. Secre
tary Vicuna, in his dispatch, asserts he said
nothing whatever about patronage of the
United States.and intimates that the Standard
purposely misquoted him or put words in his
mouth which he never used. He also declares
that his language in the correspondence al
luded to in the Standard was most respectful
toward the United States. Martinez believes
the circulation in | England and the United
States of the expression erroneously attributed
to Vicuna, was promoted by persons who de
sire to create a prejudice in both : countries
against Chili and ' thus unsettle the present
friendly relations between Chili and the United
States. .-'>, -;.;v ' ~~i :-Z\
SHERMAN'S FUNDING BILL.
The following is the text of the 3 per cent,
funding bill introduced in the senate by Sena
tor Sherman:
Be it enacted, etc.: Section 1, That the
secretary of the treasury is hereby authorized
to receive at the treasury of the United States
lawful money or the United States
to the amount of $50, or any
multiple of that sum, and to issue in ex
change therefor an equal amount of registered
or coupon bonds of the United States, of the
denomination of $50, $100, $500, $1,000 and
$10,000, of such form as he may prescribe,
bearing interest at the rate of 3 per cent, per
annum, payable at the pleasure of the United
States alter the first day of January, 1887; the
order of their payment to be determined by
law, or in the absence of such legislation, by
laws and regulations to be prescribed by the
secretary of the treasury. The money de
posited under this act shall be promptly ap
plied solely to the redemption of the bonds of
the United States bearing 3>£ per cent, inter
est, and the aggregate amount of deposits
under this act shall not exceed the sum of
$300,000,000.
ANOTHER "CRANK." t:^ '
Prof. J. W. Shevely, who calls himself the
"True Messiah," arrived in this city Thurs
day, and took rooms on Sixth street. He at
once aderessed letters to Judge Cox, Judge
Porter and others connected with the Guiteau
trial, to convince them of the fallacy of Gui
teau's inspiration. In his letter to Judge Cox
he desired to be put .upon the stand to con
front Guiteau, and to tell the court where and
how to find the lawful deity of the Republican
pijrty. The police were notified, and this
morning arrested him. lie will be sent to the
insane asylum.
GOING FOR WINDOM.
Representative Carlisle says with reference
to a published report that he will soon intro
duce a resolution to investigate Secretary
Windom's financial policy, that he does not
contemplate introducing any such resolution,
althougn when financial topics] come up for
action in the house, Windom's policy will
doubtless be fully discussed.
THE TARIFF.
Senator Garland's bill, for a commission to
examine into the subject of the tariff, with a
view of facilitating legislation in reference
thereto, is proposed as a substitute for the
Eaton bill of 1880, and provides for
nine commissioners, namely, three
senators, three representatives and three
civilians, who are to enquire into the relative
effects of the tariff upon the industries of the
country, upon the consumer and producer;
into the relative merits of the specific' and ad
valorem systems; and'Tvhat, If any, improper
discriminations exist; what changes are neces
sary, and whether the law cannot be simplified.
V ; BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.
Latham's bill for the punishment of at
tempts to take the life of the president of the
United States or others charged with the du
ties of the office of president of the United
States, prefers punishment upon conviction by
imprisonment for life; such imprisonment to
be by solitary confinement or hard labor, in the
discretion of the court.
CONFEDERATE CURRENCY. v-£££
United States Treasurer Gillfillan informed
a correspondent, who had applied to him for
information on the subject of confederate
state notes, that the United States government
had never made an offer for such currency and
does not desire any.
During the week ending ©ecember 3, 531,
--500 standard silver dollars were put into cir
culation, against 352,429 for the correspond
ing week in 1880.
THE CHAIRMANSHIPS.
Concerning the chairmanships of the various
committees of the house the impression pre
vails that Judge Kelly, of Pennsylvania, will
be appointed chairman of committee on appro
priations; Kasson, chairman of committee on
foreign affairs; Robeson, chairman of com
mittee on naval affairs, and either Crapo, of
Massachusetts, or Townsend, of Ohio, chair
man of committee on banking and currency.
Dunnell is mentioned as the probable chair
man of committee on public lands.
DEMOCRATS UNHAPPT.
There is some dissatisfaction among the
Democratic senators with the sergeant-at
arms Bright. He discharged several Demo
cratic employees and appointed Republicans
for Republican senators and the Democrats
protest against this. Rev. Dr. Power, pastor
of the church the late President Garfield at
tended was elected chaplain of the house.
But there was Republican oppo
sition. This alarmed him. Last sum
mer he preached a sermon which
was telegraphed to the western associated
press, in wfeich he referred to political influ
ences and alluded to the assassination of Gar
field, and said: "Had there been no stalwart
contest against the prerogative of the
executive, there would have been
no such assault on the president's
life. Guiteau's crime is but the terrible prod
uct of the bitter, shameless, inflamma
tory attacks indulged in persistently by those
who have only personal ends to serve, and
who were dissatisfied with the executive ac
tion, not because it affected the interest of the
country, but because it interfered with private
schemes.
Republican Caucus.
The Republican senators, soon after ad
journment, held a brief caucus and unani
mously agreed to support Edmund's resolution
which provides for continuing the senate com
mittees as they existed last year. It was pointed
out during interchange of views that Pugh's
amendment proposing to confer authority
upon the president of the senate to divide the
committees equally between the two political
parties, cannot be adopted if Judge Davis
should be willing to vote on the question, and
vote affirmatively, for the Republicans, rein
forced by Senator Mahone, consist of 38 votes
against it, and the Democrats will have only
38 if the presldeat of the senate votes with
them. A general confidence was also ex
pressed that Judge Davis will not vote against
the adoption of Edmunds' resolution, and
unless he does so vote, or unless
the Democrats prevent action upon
It by dilatory proceedings, It will be adopted,
and the work of the committees may be com
menced within the next few days. Tbe ques
tion of attempting to procure a new election
of senate officers was not mentioned in the
1 caucus.
WHT IT WAS HELD.
Senator Pugh introduced a resolution this
afternoon to divide the committees between
the Republicans and Democrats. This induced
the Republican senators to hold a caucus at
which they decided to insist upon having all
the committees. The talk in the caucus was
to the effect that the Democrats have the sec
retary and sergeant-at-arms with subordinate
officers, and the Republicans are entitled to
the committees. These who assumed to have
information stated that President Davis, of the
senate, had indicated he would not
vote for any change of organization, that his
vote would not assist to turn out the present
officers, and from this it was concluded he in
tends to vote to give the Republicans the
committees. This talk indicates that the
Republicans do not expect to be able to elect
officers at this session.
According to the returns of the late
election in Le Sueur county, there are
eight Republican and eight Democratic
towns. Honors are lost in Le Sueur
county.

Sauk Centre Herald, Dec. 2: A sad and
distressing accident resulting in the
death of George B. Virgcn, an old and
esteemed citizen of West Union, occurred
Tuesday evening. It seems that he was
sitting on the iron railing around the
basement of the Sank Centre
house, when suddenly losing his
balance, he fell over backward, and
down to the foot of the stairs, a distance
of about ten feet. He was picked up at
once and carried into the room, and med
ical aid summoned, but of no avail. He
lingered along in an unconscious state
until Wednesday morning, when death
ensued.
ACTING HIS PART.
GUITEAU PLAYING THE CRANK TO
PERFECTION.
Would Bather be Huns as a Han Than
Acquitted as a Fool— Number of Medi
cal Experts on the Stand Yesterday—
. President Arthur Subpoenaed—Testi
mony for the Defense About All Id. '
ARTHUR SVBPCENAED. -
Washington, Dec. s.— The opening of the
Guiteau trial was delayed till 11 o'clock. The
court room was crowded a3 usual. Speaker
Randall appeared in answer to a subpoena. He
was quite at a loss to know why he had been
summoned or what he was expected to testify
to. - Defense , also subpoenaed President Ar
thur, but will not summon him to appear un
til after Scoyllle has gained his assent. Sco
ville has an appointment to call upon him at 4
o'clock this afternoon. Guiteau has stated
that he had interviews with President Arthur
during the late canvass, and it is known that
he has written several letters to the president,
which letters he still has in his possession.
The defense wish them to go before the Jury.
' THE ASSASSIN FRIGHTENED.
Guiteau was late in arriving ;at the court
house. An immense crowd lined the sidewalks,
and upon alighting from the van the assassin
evinced unusual trepidation, and begged the
officers to take him around to the^luck en
trance, lie was assured the escort was ample,
and with trembling steps and cringing gait
he quickly shuffled through the angry, crowd.
RANDALL EXCUSED. -
.". Randall desired to be excused till Wednes
day. ScoviDe stated to Randall that all he
desired proved by him was that in his opinion
the success of the Democratic party ; would
not have disrupted the country. Inasmuch as
Senator Davis had alieadv given his views on
this point, Scoville said he would excuse Ran
dall from further service. '■'. ;_ r ; '.-■■ , ;
MOKE FRANKS.
 Dr. Eennan, managing editor of the Chicago
Medical Review, was called upon to give his
opinion, but before he could testify, Guiteau
made a little speech in which he said he want
ed experts to pass upon the question whether
he, being impelled by the deity to shoot Presi
dent Gar tie Id, was insane? The testimony
then went on, Dr. Kennan giving it as his
opinion that the prisoner was insane. The
prosecution entered into a lengthy cross-exam
ination of the witness.
During the testimony Davidge maintained
that John W. Guiteau had sworn positively
that the prisoner's father was not insane.
, Guiteau— "We will show by all Freeportthat
he was insane." ' * - * *-'■".
Davidge— "Never mind, we will take care
of that." . . v
Guiteau— "Everybody knows that my father
was badly cracked. He was a good man, but
badly cracked on religion."
The witness believed in . moral insanity, in
certain rare cases, rendering a man irresponsi
ble . Witness based his judgment of Guiteau's
insanity upon hereditary taint, upon impar
tial judgment*- exaltation of emotions, and
upon inspiration, which also includes the mo
tive. Witness admitted that when a man
committed crime while acting under the de
lusion of divine inspiration, and then con
ducted himself precisely as a criminal would
do, it would be presumptive against his in
sanity.'
Guiteau, who was quietly but intently fol
lowing witness, here broke in excitedly, say
ing: » "Nothing of that is the case."
, Judge Davidge—' w« will see." ; "
Guiteau, (angrily)— " You are going , too
fas\, ; *his matter. •We want facts, not your
judgment. The ! witness had stated the thing
right. The Lord injects into the spirit, and
then lets a man use his own judgment to work
it out. That's just my case. That's the way
I get my inspiration. The Lord don't employ
fools to do his work. He gets the best
material." -. •
Davidge then put in a hypothetical term
like "a common, vulgar criminal." Guiteau
turned to Davidge, and wit an air of immense
superiority, said : "There's nothing vulgar
about the case. It's all high-toned." (laugh
ter, quickly suppressed by the court.) .'. •' •
DENOUNCING HIS WIPE.
Guiteau suddenly interrupted the examina
tion, and, despite Scoville's efforts to restrain
him, broke out in a severe denunciation of his
wife, saying he had ju6t noticed a
discourse from her which : was full
of misstatements, and if she came into court
to testify against him he would show her up.
He rattled on for several minutes but quickly
kept still. <
Witness was about to be dismissed when
Guiteau detained him and said, with an air of
great seriousness, "Doctor, I want to ask you
where herreditary nimbus of the brain exists,
wont a man show it whenever there is cause?"
The witness responded in the ; affirmative.
"That will do," said Guiteau. Recess.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
Richard I. Henton, editor of the Washing
ton Gazette, had seen the prisoner at the Re
publican headquarters in New York and
formed the opinion that he was exceedingly
111-balanced and egotistic. The witness was
asked what he , thought of the prisoner's
speech, Garfield and Hancock, and replied
that in his opinion it was a ridiculous, dis
jointed affair. Guiteau became very much in
censed and shouted out: "Well, it wasn't
nothing of the kind. You don't know what
you are talking about. My speech received
the indorsement of the best men. In the coun
try." ." ..■-...-:". ...-■ .:.- ■..:.•■-
The witness resumed by saying the prisoner
seemed to bra perfect nuisance about the
rooms, but was interrupted by Guiteau, who
retorted: "You were ; the nuisance yourself.
I'd rather be hung as a man than acquitted as
a fool, and I won't have any more of this kind
of evidence." -Witness akded: "He was a
laughing-stock, as far as I could see." Gui
teau became greatly enraged, ttnd turning to
Scoville, said: "If you put any more of
these cranky fellows on the stand I'll square
you again. 'Twas a great piece of imperti
nence on your part to put Judge Davis on the
stand without '. consulting . me. I'm no fool,
and I won't allow you to make me out one."
EXPERTS ON INSANITY.
Dr. Chas. A. Nicholas, of Bloomdale asylum,
replied to a hypothetical question proposed
by Scoville : "If the evidence to which I have
listened is correct, I should say the prisoner
is insane."
Some discussion arose in relation to the
foam of questions proposed touching on the
responsibility of the prisoner, and the witness
was allowed to retire for the present.
Dr. JFolsom, of Boston, thought if the hy
pothetical proposition put by Scoville wa9
correct in all particulars, tbe prisoner was in
sane when he shot President Garfield.
Dr. Samuel Worcester, of Salem, declined to
express an opinion until counsel explained
what he meant by the term "inspirational."
Guiteau, impatiently— "When it is an in
spiration by the Deity on my mind of a
thought and power foreign to my own will
and mind. That's what's meant. I've told
you a dozen times."
Witness was finally told by Scoville to stand
aside.
Dr. Wm. W. Godding, of the government
asylumn for the insane at Washington,
thought that at the time set forth in the hy
pothetical question, if it were true, the pris
oner was undoubtedly insane.
Dr. James H. Me Bride, of Milwaukee, and
Dr. Charming, of Brookline, Mass., also
thought, taking all tbe hypothetical proposi
tions to be true, that the prisoner was insane.
Dr. W. T. Fisher, of Boston, would dislike
to be confined to to the statement of facts
contained in the hypothetical questions, but if
compelled to answer would say he should
judge the prisoner was insane. Witness was
informed by the prosecution they would want
him as a witness.
ScovJle announced he had no more witness
es present and would introduce bat two or
three more before closing the case.
Guiteau interrupted and demanded that
subpoenas be issued for Gen. Grant, Senator
Conkling, Gov. Jewitt and others he men
tioned Saturday. Finding no objection was
made to Ms interruption, Guiteau proceeded
to make an incoherent harangue, while his
counsel smiled complacently, as feeling that
the prisoner was making more headway with
the jury than any expert testimony could com
pass. He was finally silenced by Judge Cox,
and Scoville read from Guiteau's book
"Truth" until the hour of adjournment.
FOREIGN COMMENT.
London, Dec. s.— The Daily Telegraph,
discussing the question of Guiteau's madness,
says: In such cases the verdict of mankind at
large is more to be trusted tnan the jury, and
individually tbe general voice demand* that
Guiteau shall pay the penalty of his crime.

A WATBBY GRAVE.
Total* Loss of the Steamer Jane Miller,
With Passenger* and Grew.
Wiabton, Ont, Dec. s.— The tug towing
Wright left Owens Saturday morning to look
around the island in Georgian Bay for some
trace of the missing steamer, Jane Miller. She
arrived here to-night, having on board three
bedsteads, three oars, some pins out of the
life boat, a piece of a mast, a steamer's gang
plank and a pail rack. All were identified
as having belonged to the Jane Miller. She
also had some kegs of butter, with Capt.
Port's brand on them. All of these articles
were found on White Cloud island, and are
ominous of the fate of the missing steamer.
The Jane Miller left Meaford on the 23d of
November with a heavy load of freight, on
her last trip to Michael's Bay, Manitoulin
island. Her last port of sail was at Big hay,
where she took on freight,and left for Spencer's
dock, a short distance off, for fuel, after
which she intended going to Lion's Head, for
which place she had some ten tons of freight.
It was blowing a strong gale from the south
west at the time, and as ehe never made this
last port it is supposed that she foundered
near White Cloud island and went down sud
denly with all on board.
Some twentv-flve persons mado up the crew
and passengers, but it is impossible as yet to
to ascertain the exact number. So far as can
be learned the following were on board: An
drew Port, captain; Richard Port,
mate; Fred Port> purser; J. Christison,
engineer; Alexander Scales, wheelsman;
and four deck hands whose names cannot be
ascertained— all from the village of Wiarton.
Passengers: James Walker, Janesville; Lyman
Vader and a man and wife, all from Medford
and bound for Michaels Bay. A nnmber of
passengers, also, from here for Lions Head,
to work at Walls Mills, were on board, but
their names are not given.
The Jane Miller was built at Little Current,
Manitoulin island, in 1879. She was pur
chased in the spring of 1880 by Capt. Port, and
has been running between here and
ports of the South side of Manitoulin Island,
she was classed by the L'.oyds "A, 2m ," val
ued at $80,000, add insured in tbe Phoenix
insurance company for $50,000. The Miller
was considered a staunch little propeller, and
has weathered a number of severe gales. Capt.
Port was recognized as a most skillful officer
and a man of superior judgment in handling
his craft. He leaves a wife and family of
grown-up children. The engineer, Christison,'
also leaves a family.
FOILED BY A. FEMALE.
Desperate Attempt to Escape by a Colora
do Stage Robbsr— The Escape Prevented
by the Brave Action of a Lady.
Detroit, Dec. s.— On Saturday, on the day
express from Chicago over the Michigan Cen
tral, a desperate struggle took place between
Henry White, alias Burton, a stage robber,
bandit, and desperado, enroute to the Detroit
house of correction, and United States Mar
shall, P. P. Wilcox, of Denver, Colorado, who
had him In custody. White, who had been ap
parently engaged in reading a paper, suddenly
rose in his seat and furiously attacked the
officer with his hand cuffs, the lock
of which he had picked wijh a tooth
pick, thus releasing his hands,
his feet being shackled, which alone prevent
ed his escape. The passengers all fled from
the car, except a plucky woman, Mrs. Smith
son, of Denver, who rendered valuable aid by
throwing her arms about the neck of the des
perado, hampering him in his struggle. The
marshal was at first somewhat stunned by the
blows from the hnndcuffs, which came thick
and fast, while he also succeeded in wrenching
his revolver from him, which he attempted to
fire, but failed to discharge. Two guards in
the baggage car smoking, were finally apprais
ed of what was going on, and hastened to the
rescue of their chief. The villain was soon
brought under subjection.
White is a notorious murderer, who has
been the terror of Texas, Arkansas and Colo
rado for several years, and is now under a sen
tence for life. He was sentenced during the
administration of President Hayes, to ten
years in the Wheeling, W. Va., penitentiary,
for robbing a stage, but was subsequently
pardoned.
Yesterday, Marshal Wilcox, was suffer
ing quite severely from the terrible
snuggle he passed through, though
he made few complaints. His head,
face and hips were badly bruised. The hearing
of the left ear was slightly impaired by the
blow which he received on the left side of the
head, making him partially deaf. He leaves
for Washington to day.

advices and bad weather, and then, weaken
ing, dropped life, rallied % c, but again suf
fered a decline, and closed % c above Satur
day's last price. Exports were bought freely.
Sales wery made at $1.29%@1.31x January,
and $1.80@1.32 February.
Corn was In demand early, with fair de
mand, and prices %@}ic above Saturday's

strong on all grades.
In provisions there was a weak market from
the start to the finish, but prices were irreg

The Newark Bank Failure.
Philadelphia, Dec. s.— On motion of
counsel for the receiver of t lie suspended
Mechanics bank of Newark, the court of com
mon pleas to-day dissolved the attachment
issued to the Farmers and Mechanics bank of
this city against the money and securities de
posited in the Philadelphia National bank, be
lieved to belong, to the Newark bank. The
attachment ia dissolved on the principal of
law that funds of institutions in the hands of
a receiver are not liable to attachment, and
that, although the receiver's appointment
may not have been made till some time after
the suspension of the institution, it dates
back to the time of its suspension.

GENERAL FOREIGN.
THE ATTACK ON BERNHAEDT.
St. Petersburg, Dec. s.— Authentic news
of the late Jewish raids at Odessa has only
just reached here. The report of the attack
on Sarah Bernhardt went without comment
until the Sunday issue of the leading journals,
which make remarKs on the affair that are a
disgrace to Journalism. A correspondent says
he can state on good authority that a fresh
outbreak of the anti-Jewish agitation in Rus
sia ia considered imminent. ,».-
Paris, Dec. s.— The chamber of deputies
has annulled the elections of Ladancette and
Amagat, on the ground that the elections were

wounded. The Dhow escaped.
ARTHUR'S APPOINTMENTS.
London, Dec. 4.— The Times says : Pres
dent Arthur's message to congress to-day will
probably not contain any striking disclosures.
Civil service reform can bo treated so as to
commit - neither; President Arthur nor his
party to any definite plan. The real center of
interest in the political situation is not, how
ever, the president's message, but his appoint
ments to office.
918 GAHNET WOLSET.
London, Dec. s.— The official announce
ment is inada trom the war office that when
Sir Garnet Wol&ey succeeds to the adjutant
generalship appointment, he will, like his
predecessors, transact official business under
the authority and responsibility of the com
mander-in-chief, who is the military ad
viser of the secretary of state. The above
apparently put forth to fettle the rumors that
the duke of Cambridge is hostile to Gen. Wol
sey?s appoiutmenl, and that the government
intends Gen. Wolsey shall enforce changes in
the army to which the duke of Cambridge is
opposed.
The lord mayor of London writes that he
has consented to try to raise the fund originat
ed by the duchess of Abercom, and seconded
by Countess Cowper, in aid of the association
for the relief of ladies in distress, through
non-payment of rent in Ireland.

"■" ' A Successful Dog Trap.
[Lynchburg Virginian.]
A Virginia farmer, having suffered
severely from the depredations of dogs
upon his sheep fold, built around a num
ber of sheep that dogs had killed an en
closure of rails twelve feet high and fcen
feet square at the ground, the sides of the
trap sloping inward until an
opening was left about five
feet square. Any dog ! could
easily climb such a sloping fence and en
ter the pen, but not even a greyhound
could jump out of it. In three nights the
farmer captured forty-six dogs, includ
ing fifteen or twenty that had never been
in that neighborhood. This after there
had been a public slaughter of all dogs
suspected of sheep stealing, save one,
whose master could not be convinced of
his guilt. The trap was set for his espec
ial benefit, and it caught him the first
night.
A Tip for Murderers.
[New York Tribune.]
Guiteau has established a precedent in
Judge Cox's remarkable court which per
mits every murderer on trial for his life
not only to conduct his own trial, but to
blackguard every witness who is to ap
pear against him, and every man, witness
or otherwise, who presumes to speak un
favorably of him. The judge did not
even threaten when it was established on
Saturday. "Mr. Prisoner'' seems to have
both the court and the counsel for the
prosecution in willing subjection. Tbe
country is in a very different frame of
mind.
