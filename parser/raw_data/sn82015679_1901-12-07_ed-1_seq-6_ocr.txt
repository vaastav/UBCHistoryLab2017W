IV THE FEDERAL COURT.
Flke County .Man Get Imprisonment
Inntrnd of i Prmlon.
John V'. Glover, of Ayrshire, Pike coun
ty, pleaded guilty In the United States
Court yesterday to making a fraudulent
statement In order to get a pension, and
was sentenced to seventy days In the work
house and fined $10 and costs. It appears
that a veteran soldier named Willis Glover,
living In Kentucky, applied for a pension,
and while John W. Glover was in Ken
tucky in the same neighborhood a letter to
Willis Glover fell Into his hands, and he
decided to impersonate the other man and
get "the pension. Willis Glover died while
his application was pending. The depart
ment found two claims for pension for the
same service, and an investigation was
started. The result was that John W.
Glover was arrested.
William Dibble, charged with sending ob
jectionable literature through the malls,
was fined J3 and costs, a jury having
found him guilty.
W. H. Williams, charged with sending a
vile and anonymous letter to his wife,
from whom he had separated, was acquit
ted. There was no direct evidence that
Williams had written the letter.
William R. Harnett, charged with using
the malls for the furtherance of a fraudu
lent scheme, was sentenced to a year and
one day in the Columbus, O., prison.
AFRICAN M. E. CHI RCII THOUI1LE.
Iliillrilnfg anil Loan Company Sues to
Foreclose 3IortKHKC.
The African Methodist Episcopal Zion
Church is in a hard row financially, and a
struggle for four years or more to keep
pace with creditors culminated yesterday
In the filing of a suit by the Fidelity Rulld
ing and Savings Union to foreclose a mort
gage on the property. The plaintiff avers
that the board of trustees of the church
subscribed for five shares of stock of $10
each In the Fidelity Ruilding and Savings
Union and secured a '-an of $42.". giving
the certificates of stock and mortgage as
collateral security. It is charged in the
complaint ihat the trustees have failed to
pay dues on the stock for twenty-six
months, and Interest on the mortgage
he'ld on thf property has not been paid
for thirty months. In addition to these
delinquencies it Is charged that fines have
accrued amounting to $1X for the nonpay
ment of dues and interest, all amounting to
Fonrth Wnnl Liquor Contest.
The temperance side Introduced one of
the canvassers who circulated the power of
attorney remonstrance In the Fourth ward
in the hearing before the County Commls
hloners yesterday. He declared that he had
made no misrepresentations In getting the
names and that he read the introduction at
the head of the remonstrance to every per
son who signed. One of the witnesses for
the liquor element said that he signed the
petition, but that if any solicitor ever came
to him with another paper like it again
he would hit him with a club. He ad
dressed this remark to T. P. KIser. who is
at the head of the temperance movement.
Frees C Jury Still Ont.
The jury In the Martin Freeze murder
case is still out and the indications are
that a disagreement is probable. The jury
retired at 3 o'clock Thursday afternoon,
and at no time since then has there been an
Intimation that an agreement would be
reached. Judge Alford will keep the jury
out as long as he thinks advisable.

SHORTRIDGE HIGH SCHOOL.
Tnylor-FInlejr Measure Argued In the
S n a to.
The senate of Shortridge High School
yesterday discussed the Taylor-Finley
measure. After Catherine McCoy, Mary
Class. Hehn Spain and Edwin Lewis were
sworn in the bill imposing a sentence on a
Governor for refusing to honor a requisi
tion was read. The minority report of the
committee in favor of the bill was passed
and the author of the bill. Senator Lodge
(Edwin Friend), took the floor. In an earn
est manner the senator asked the body to
pass the bill. Senator Fairbanks followed
against the question, and then the gentle
man from Vermont (Herbert Wagner) be
gan a speech against the bill. The diminu
tive Senator Gear (Luther Benson) de
manded recognition from the chair, who
at last succeeded in Retting those on the
floor to sit down. Senator Gear made a
short speech in favor of the measure, after
which Senator Deboe delivered a strong
speech against the bill, 'n which he scored
he Kentucky courts in spite of the fact
that he is supposed to be from the Blue
grass State.
The scene which followed the argument
of the Kentucky senator was exciting. A
large part of the body immediately ob
jected to the honor of Kentucky's courts
'being questioned, but quiet was finally re
stored by the presiding officer. The deep
voice of Senator Prltchard (Earl Pritchard)
was heard, and that tall and stately gen
tleman proceeded to tell the senate about
a "certain State that was strongly parti
san and the courts decidedly corrupt." He
was not Interrupted until he came to the
mention of ex-Governor Taylor's name,
when the chamber was filled with cries of
"I object." "Point of order" and similar
declarations. The chair then decided that
the Carolina gentleman was not "personal,"
because he had not said anything against
any of the body.
Senator Lodge gained the floor and
answered many of the opposition's argu
ments. After a short parliamentary tan
gle the meeting adjourned. This was the
most enjoyable and interesting session this
term, and the senate is fast gaining the
popularity that characterized the meetings
a few years ago when Pettljohn, Cohen,
Crossland and others were the "stars."

The civil government classes under Miss
Donnan will hold debates next week on
the President's message. One side will
argue that it Is perfect in every detail,
while the opposition will try to prove that
it is lacking in many phases, including
grammatical construction. The history
classes, under Mr. Dunn, will also study
President Roosevelt's message to Congress
on Monday.

There is a possibility that the High
School cadet company may get a new lease
on life and continue to be an organization.
Richard Langsdale, a member of the com
pany, has received a letter from Merrill
Moores in which he strongly encouraged
a military organization for several reasons.
Another effort will bo made to form a com
pany and. it is thought, will be success
ful. A number of boys from a cavalry
company under Captain Sumner Clancy
have agreed to Join the Shortridge boys,
and Clancy will be a lieutenant. If this
plan Is carried out the company's success
is assured.

Thoso interested in forming a debating:
club met yesterday afternoon. The boys
present were Ed Eitle, Fred Appel, Al
fred Darlow. Bartlett Williams, Albert
Euchanan and James Hoag. A committee
composed of Albert Buchanan, Bartlett
Williams and Paul Edwards will frame a
constitution. Mr. Scott, of the faculty,
will be the critic, and the first debate will
be held a week from next Thursday on the
question, "Should Manual Training be
Taught in the Shortridee High School?"
Ed Eitle and Bartlett Williams will lead
the affirmative and Paul Edwards and Al
Buchanan will speak on the negative side
of the question.
xxx
The question of oratory continues to be
prominent in the school. A committee com
posed of James Glpe. Gladys Nehrbas, Ed
win Friend and George Posey recently in
terviewed the principal, but when they
were asked regarding the outcome of their
talk "they knew nothing about the ques
tion." The committee held the interview
with the idea of obtaining a change in the
method of passing on the orations and
also regarding an out-of-town contest. The
students are eager to have the next contest
away from here, but whether or not the
authorities would approve of this is a ques
tion. However, it Is believed that the in
terview above mentioned was entirely satis
factory and that a change in passing on the
manuscripts will be made, and that the
content will in all probability take place
out of the city.

IN THE EIGHTH DISTRICT
MAYOR mLAI OF AMJEIlSOX, MAY
TRY FOR CONGRESS.
Col. W. W HnfTtnnn Talks Politic
nt the Columbia CIu1 Gos
sip of Hotel Lobbies.
Col. W. W. Huffman, of Anderson, who
was chief clerk of the State Senate at the
last session, was at the Columbia Club yes
terday. Colonel Huffman is still in politics
and is making an active canvass for the
nomination for county clerk of Madison
county. Ex-Senator A. E. Harlan, of Alex
andila, is also a candidate for the nomi
nation. Colonel Huffman lives in the Eighth
district, where the congressional situation
is becoming decidedly interesting to poli
ticians. Anderson has a candidate for congres
sional honors in the person of Mayor Dun
lap. In discussing the situation yesterday
Colonel Huffman said: "Is is my judg
ment that Madison county will be solid
for Mayor Dunlap. I consider him one of
the most eloquent men of Indiana and a
man who would make his mark in Con
gress. The question of who will go back to
Congress, I think, rests with Delaware
county. If Mr. Cromer loses that county
he will probably be defeated. If success
ful in that county, I think no one can beat
him. There will probably be two candi
dates; from Delaware county. Judge Iefler
is being talked of. but l as never announced
his candidacy. A good many of Senator
Walter Ralls friends are urging him to
make the race. It Is probable that cither
Ball or Dunlap will make the race against
Cromer. The Republican party in Madison
county is in excellent condition and is in
perfect harmony. All of the cities in our
county will undoubtedly elect full Repub
lican tickets next spring. George Nlchol,
one of our old-time Republicans, and a
man who stands high in business, will prob
ably be the candidate for mayor to succeed
Dunlap.
There is no trouble with organized labor
In Madison county and all our factories are
running full time. In conversation with
one of our principal contractors the other
day he said there had been more building
In Anderson during the past year than dur
ing any year In its history. He said the in
dications for the year 1902 are greater than
in the past year. All of our merchants say
they have had the best year's business in
their history."

A LOCOMOTIVE EXPERT.
W. J. Hartman, of the Monon. Chats
About Modern Enslnes.
W. J. Hartman, traveling engineer for
the Monon system, is at the Denlson Ho
tel. Mr. Hartman has charge of the en
gineers and firemen employed by the Mo
non. lie is here to examine four firemen
for promotion. Mr. Hartman was for sev
eral years connected with the Westing
house Air Brake Company as mechanical
expert. "The competition for traffic is
commanded by equipment, comfort and
speed," he said last night. "In view of
these facts the railroads are designing lo
comotives and-trains of unusually large
dimensions and weights and especially with
reference to the ability of locomotive boil
ers for generating steam. They have
reached a proportion of one square foot
of heating surface for every six and one
half inches of total piston displacement
for engines having 73 to TS-inch diameter
four-coupled tlriving wheels. The boilers
on the engines known as the Chatauqua
type, plying between Indianapolis and Chi
cago on our lines, are designed to safely
carry two hundred pounds pressure per
square inch. On this account special
valves for handling the pressure have been
designed. On our road we have two new
engines of the above type. They are haul
ing opr heaviest passenger trains on sched
ule time with perfect ease and when be
hind time they attain a gait of from sixty
five to seventy miles an hour.
"The indications are that steam locomo
tives will yet be designed to run at a ninety-mile
speed. The modern locomotive is
supplied with an 800-candle power are
headlight and about fourteen eight-candle
power incandescent lights so arranged that
when the train takes the side track the
arc headlight Is switched out and the in
candescents lit up so that the engineer
can Inspect all the parts of his machinery
without the aid of fiambeau or torch. An
opposing train can discover an electric
headlight five to eight miles distant on a
straight track."
3IADISOX NO SLOW TOWN'.
School Superintendent McDanlel lie-
Henta the Imputation.
"People over the State are sometimes In
clined to sneer at the city of Madison and
call it a slow town," said Superintendent
C. M. McDanlel, of the Madison city
schools, at the Hotel English last nlfht.
"I resent the insinuation that Madison is
a slow town, because I have lived there
long enough to rind out better. In the last
few years a number o factories have lo
cated there, and deals are on as a result
of which others will locate there. The
County Commissioners a few days ago de
cided to buy the toll roads of the county,
thus doing away with the last relic of early
days, and opening a free communication
with the surroifndirg towns. The people
generally are united in advancing the best
interests of Madison.
"There is great interest being shown In
the schools of Madison, which are doing
substantial work. A free Industrial organ
ization is being, organized for the purpose
of Introducing certain lines of manual
training in the grades. The work will start
in a modest way by the introduction of
sewing and domestic economy. The ex
penses will be met by free contributions of
the .organization, and no expense will be
added to the taxes of the patrons. Next
year a complete commercial department
will be added to the High School. Short
hand, typewriting, bookKeeping and com
mercial geography and commercial arith
metic will form a part of the course. In
this way the schools will not only prepare
the boys and girls for college, but give
them preparation for the more active pur
suits of business."

Executive Committee of the Associa

The executive committee of the Asso
ciated Dailies of Indiana held a meeting at
the Denlson Hotel last night to devise
plans by which an interest among the pro
prietors and managers of the daily news
papers of the State outside of this city
can be aroused. The members present
were V. T. Singleton, of the Martinsville
Reporter, president; W. Bent Wilson, of
the Lafayette Journal, vice president;
Harry M. Smith, of the Grcencastle Ban
ner, secretary; R. S. Truitt, of the Noblts
ville Ledger, and W. S. Montgomery, of the
Greenfield Republican. There are about 140
I dally newspapers in the State, it is said.
and thirty-five of them are included in the
organization. One of the purposes of the
organization is to protect publishers from
advertisers that fall to pay their bills. The
committee last night fixed the date for the
annual meeting of the organization. It will

V. Bent Wilson, editor of the Journal, a
Democratic newspaper of Itfayette, wis
in the city last night. He said that La
fayette is to have a Y. M. C. A.
building. Mr. Wilson says the plan to
build an electric railroad from Lafayette
to Indianapolis has probably fallen through
on account of an objection interposed by
Iifayette merchants. Several thousand
dollars whs pledged to the scheme, prin
cipally by farmers In that locality who
wanted the road. However, the business
men of th' city declined to put up their
money, believing it would be an injury to
their business. They were willing to assist

SUNDAY-SCHOOL LESSON AND CHRISTIAN
ENDEAVOR WORK.
THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL LESSON.
Dec. ltOlt 3!oes and Pharaoh
Exoduw II, 1-1.
Michael Angelo' s Moses has been called the
crown of modern sculpture. If so. it Is an Iron
crown. Paradoxical? Yes! But the marvel is
that marble could be wrought into sucn a shape-,
terrible in Its unyieldingness. Angelo's Moses
is a veritable thundering Jupiter. Or.cc seen,
the awesome Impression cannot be shaken off.
The artist's gnlu triumphed when he cut out
of the block this ileal of imperious leadership,
whose glance Is as if it "passed over an entire
Plain full of people and ruled them." Pope
Julius II exrected to hitch this statue to his
triumphal tomb, which was to stand four square
in the nave of St. Teter's Cathedral. Instead
he trot only a slab in the floor. The gigantic
Plan, as often happens in mortuary matters,
dwindled into merely a commemorative tomb in
S. Pietro in Vincoll. It seems almost Irony to
see the pitiful flKure of the Pope looking down
from the lid of his empty sarcophagus upon thi
superb statue, which makes everything about it
fade into nothingless. In that presence one
can think only of Moses. Tope and eVen artist
are forgotten for the while. The statue is in
every respect worthy of the "greatest, mightiest
popular leader who ever raised a nation from
servitude to reliance on its own strength.
The eye does not know where to rest in this
masterpiece of sculpture since the time of the
Greeks. The figure is seated in the central niche,
with long, flowing beard descending to the
waist, with horned head and deep-sunk eyes,
which blaze, as It were, with the light of the
burning bush, with a majesty of anger which
makes one tremble, as of a passionate being
drunken with fire.. All that is positive, and all
that Is negative In him Is equally dreadful. If
he were to rise up it seems as if he would shout
forth laws which no human intellect could
fathom. His voice, like that of the gods of
Homer, would thunder forth in tones too awful
for the ear of man to support. Yes! there is
something infinite which lies In the Moses of
Michael Angelo. Nor is his countenance soft
ened by the twilight of sadness which Is steal
ing from his forehead over his eyes. The Greeks
could not have endured a glance from such a
Moses, and the artist would certainly have been
blamed, because he has thrown no softening
touch over his gigantic picture. That which we
have- is the archetype of a terrible and quite un
approachable sublimity. (Gregorovlus.)
As one stands in the religious light, unusually
dim. of St. Teter in chains, another statue
seems to rise out ef the gloom. Over against
the Moses of Angelo ona sees the Tharaoh of
Egypt, the proud, untimely monarch of the
mightiest empire of that age. Invincible
legions, trained councilors, high executives,
great viziers, an innumerable retinue all are
at his beck. The wisdom and powet of the
world are concentrated In him. Moses and
Pharaoh! One pitted against the other. A bat
tle of giants is impending. The duel of the
centuries! How uneven! One is the spokesman
of a racs of slaves, without political affiliation,
arms, or resources of any kind. It is enough to
say the other is Tharaoh. What made
Moses dauntless and omnipotent was that he
felr" he had a divine vocation. Ills cry was the
same which Peter the Hermit raised centuries
afterward In slumbering Europe: "The Lord
wills it!" Moses had what all genuine world
leaders have inspiration. That was what nerved
him to toss his gauntlet at Pharaoh's feet.
Pharaoh's refusal was inevitable and
inveterate. Consent would involve humiliation
in the eyes of his subjects, and, what was more,
in the eyes of rival and envious monarchs. As
a matter of statecraft it seemed out of the
question. Emancipation of those million slaves
would also be the destruction at one blow of
both capital and revenue Incredible.
Cnder tho circumstances nothing but such a
series of terrible, attllctive provisions as are
here described, "signs and wonders." could
have broken the Iron will of Rameses. As it
was, he had the hardihood to stout It out
against them for ten months and on an aver
age one a month. Hut at last heart and flesh
failed him. It seems he v. as of such a decisive
charaeter that he couli not be negative in any
thing, even In the form of his submission to the
Inevitable. In the language of quaint Scripture,
"He thrust them out hence altogether." The
battle of giants was over. The tyrant was de
feated; and again, fn archaic IJlble phrase,
"Moses was very great."
THE TEACHER'S LANTERN.
The gains of good leadership are incalculable.
A captain In thought, industry, or government
is above all price. National leaders, like na
tional songs, cannot be bought; tiey are God's
gifts born, not made. These make the suc
cession of truest royalty. Moses stands bril
liantly among the foremost. The bor
rowing" of gold and silver jewels from the
Egyptians by the Jews presents a problem in
casuistry. To say that "borrow" is a mistrans
lation for "ask" hardly gives loophole enough.
Rack of this the question should be asked. Was
this a direct, supernatural command of God, of
which we hav literal record, or did the people
feel it to be right to make reprisals upon their
towns with Lafayette, but they drew the
line at connecting- Indianapolis and giving
people an extra opportunity of going out
of town to do their buying. A Greenfield
citizen who overheard Mr. Wilson's re
marks said the electric line connecting that
place with Indianapolis is a benefit to
Greenfield. He related instances where In
dianapolis people have gone to the smaller
town to do their buying because they could
make purchases cheaper.
Mr. Wilson says he knows of no Demo
cratic candidates for Congress in the Tenth
district. "Running for Congress in the
Tenth district is a sad and forlorn hope,"
he remarked. He says he had a conversa
tion some time ago with J. Frank llanly,
who Is talked of as a candidate for Con
gress again, and the latter declared he was
"out of politics."

The State Teachers' and Young People's
Reading Circle board is holding its final
session of the year at the Hotel English.
The board met yesterday afternoon and
selected the books for teachers to use dur

w Court house In tJreencnstle.
Harry M. Smith, editor of the Green
castle Panner, who was in the city last
night, said that the people of Putnam
county are bound to have a new court
house. He thinks the m:tter will be put
to a vote of the ieople about the first of
the year, if a new courthouse is built it
will likely cost in the neighborhood of
$l".o.0ö0. Mr. Smith says that Grcencastle
expects to add a tin-plate mill to its man

On the ethical plane on which they were stand
ing at that early day, it may have seemed right
in their eyes, and thus to have been the Lord's
will. On the higher ethical plan of to-day the
suggestion would not be tolerated. We err in
applying the ethical standards of to-day to a
race living four thousand years ago. The
same reasoning applies to the request to go Into
the wilderness to worship, made with the im
plication that a return was intended.
We perhaps entertain too mechanical views of
the plagues: that they were altogether destitute
of a natural basis or element; that their severity
was upon a literally graduated geometric scale;
that they were purposely leveled at objects of
Egyptian worship, ascending in the ratio of
sanctity. The plagues of Egypt are not
without modern parallel. Massachusetts has a
"plague," on the checking of which It has spent
J5OJ.0C0 unsuccessfully; all said to have come
from a domestlo throwing out of the window of
an entomologist the cocoons of the gypsy moth.
Russia had its "plague" when, in one year last
century, two mllllou died of smallpox. Iceland
had its "plague" when, in the year 1707, 60 per
cent, of the population were swept away by dis
ease. The "black . death" of London was as
terrible as anything that visited Egypt.
The new science of bacteriology makes us won
der we are not "plagued" Incessantly. It fright
ens us when we are told that a bacillus divid
ing itself, as it does under favorable conditions,
without ceasing, would have produced an in
calculable number of billions n ttiree days,
whose, weight would be nearly 7,500 tons. In
point of fact, civilization is always "plaguing"
Itself fouling its livers and air, propagating
parasitical life. In point of fact the
steady advance of medical science and sanita
tion, and the self-purging powers which Inhere
in nature, are all that keeps, not one nation, but
all. from being swept, not with ten plagues, but
by hundreds.
CHRISTIAN' ENDEAVOR.
Topic for Deo. 8: The Rieht Use of
Ablllty-Matt. v, 13-1(1.
First, get the ability. Many talk about th
use of ability who have no ability to use. They
have the seeds of It Implanted in them by their
Maker, who never formed a man without a
destiny; but they are letting the seeds decay.
The first use of ability any ability Is to get
more ability. A man who Is not growing can
not help others to grow. As Bayard Taylor
finely sings:
He who would lead must first himself be led;
Who would be loved, be capable of love
Heyond the utmost be-receives, who claims
The rod of power must first have bowed his
head.
And. being honored, honor what's above.
This know the men who leave the world their
names.
First, get the ability; then, consecrate it. To
consecrate one's ab'lity is to devote it to the
highest uses God opens before it. For instance,
to quote Rev. Clarence A. Vincent, "Henry
Ward Reecher would have made a splendid
auctioneer. Ills keen wit, his commanding
voice, his great body, his striking face and
head, his power over men, would have made him
a prince at the block. The sale of the young
slave-woman from his pulpit one Sunday morn
ing proves what he could have been, but it
would have been a crime for him to do it. His
wit was to illuminate great themes; his voice
to tiummon men to God and noble action; his
face to shine with great emotion, and his brain
to think world-shaping thoughts; and his power
over men to be exerted for man and not for
money."
Use your ability as a trust. Get to thinking
of it as something apart from yourself. You
are an underworkcr of the Master Carpenter,
and your abilities are the tools He lends you to
work with.
I'se your ability boldly. It- is more than a
dead tool. If It has been dedicated to God it is
like the tools In the fairy story, which guide the
band that uses them.
Use your ability freely. Freely you received
it. Did the artist buy his talent in any store,
or the musician pay so many dollars for her
genius? Freely give it.
Use your ability happily. Man's power is the
only iHjwer in the universe that mopeB. Elec
tricity never sulks. Gravitation la always
briskly ready. Sunlight laughs as it runs on Ha
errands. Good cheer multiplies talent many
fold.
Listen to the stirring words of a young man,
all too early taken from us, who used his great
abilities for God and man, as a trust, boldly,
freely, and happily, Maltbie D. Babcock:
He strong!
We are not here to play, to dream, to drift.
We have hard work to do. and loads to lift;
Shun not the struggle face It; 'tis God's gift.
Be strong!
Say not the days are evil. Who's to blame?
And fold the hands and acquiesce oh, shame!
Stand up, fpeak out, and bravely, in God's
name.
Be strong!
It matters not how deep intrenched the wrong.
How hard the battles goes, the day how long;
Faint not fight on! To-morrow comes the song.

A prominent'Italian critic speaks editorially of the Starr Grand
piano as follows:
"But It waa an accepted fact by all persons composing this distinguished
assembly that the real feature of the Concert-Soiree waa the new piano of
American make. Mr. and Mrs. Bruneiii, proprietors of the Grand Hotel at
Varese, bo well known for their refined taste and Judgment, had made a
choice of this manufacture. This piano 1 made by the Starr Piano Company
of Richmond, U. S. A. It is simply admirable by its excellence of aoun I, lta
superior mechanism and structure and Its divine accords and sweetness of
natural round, charming appearance, etc., etc., and was on this occasion the
'hlc' In everybody's mouth. In ffact, the accompaniment of violins and
songs, although so brilliant by themselves, were entirely subdued to the
Imposing magnitude of the Starr Piano, which was in breve the REAL
LIFE of the party. For this reason we think it will be a matter of but a
short time before this excellent and superior make will be introduced and
appreciated all over the kingdom of Italy."
