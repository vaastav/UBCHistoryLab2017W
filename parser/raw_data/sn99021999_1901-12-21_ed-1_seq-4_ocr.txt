Joseph Zunlc, badly cut and Injured

The Injured at tho hospitals are all doing
well, except Stelnbaugh, whoso Injuries may
yet prove fatal. Keubcn Mlllor, Jr., su
perintendent of tho plant, states that the
boilers wore examined last week nnd pro
nounced In excellent condition. No known
causo can be given for tho explosion, but
a thorough Investigation Is now In progress.
It was nbout 4:15 o'clock as tho night
crow was ubout to turn over the mill to tho
day force that four hollers In the ten-Inch
bar mill No, 3 exploded with terrific force,
scattering death nnd destruction In all di
rections. Tho mill was completely wrecked
and tho debris Is piled from fifty to seventy-five
feet high. Tho boiler worka of
James McNeil, adjoining the niack Diamond
mill, wcro also destroyed. A force of men
wont to work as quickly as possible after
tho explosion, searching In the debris for
bodies. Flvo dend and twelve Injured have
already been removed. The dead havo not
been Identified and tho bodies arc now at
tho morgue.
From what can be learned tho four boil
ers exploded at ono time, reducing the mill
to a henp of burned and charred timbers
and twisted Iron. Thero Is not a straight
piece of iron or steel left in tho entire
building. Even the bolts In tho benms and
strlngern arc twisted llko screw nails.
Tho mill had sixty men on each turn am)
It Is thought that almost 1Z0 men, comprl
Ing both crews, wero In tho plant at the
tlmo of tho explosion.. A few minutes after
tho' boilers let go the big mill was a heap
of ruins. The Injured and dead wcro found
under wreckage and In tho mill yard, where
they had fallen In their raco for life. The
No. 3 ten-Inch mill was a big Iron-clad
structure, built on a steel frame. In the
rear of the plant, on Twenty-ninth street,
Is the big boiler works of James McNeil.
One of tho hollers went through the Park
nro.' mill and crashed Into tho McNeil
plant, almost completely demolishing It.
Tho only man at work in the McNeil plant
was Rudolph KorfT, the night watchman,
lie wan found In tho plant nnd taken to tho
West I'enu hospital, badly injured.
One of tho boilers went through the roof
of tho bar mill, soared through the air
across Thirtieth street and crashed Into the
residence of, Robert Prlco at 8 Thirtieth
street. It went through the front wall nnd
fell Into tho cellar, completely wrecking tho
bouso. Prlco and his family wcro asleep at
tho time and had to rush to the street In
their nlghtclothea. The othor two bollcr
wero blown to pieces and It was these that
caused tho complete destruction of the
mill. Tho biting cold winds from the river
mado tho rescuo work slow nnd painful.
A meotlng of the officials of tho plant Is
now In session and a thorough Investigation
Is to bo made.

DOWIE IS HIS OWN COUNSEL

CHICAGO. Dec. 20. "Ur." John Alex
ander Dowle talked to his heart's content
today In defending the suit against him
self for a receivership for his Zlon lace
Industries. Ho Intimated to Attorney
Ilccves, who was cross-examining htm, that
he liked to talk, and he was granted per
mission to lay bare his heart. "Dowle"
was the main topic of his story and with
much show of higher education, Latin quo
tations and attempts at witticisms ha
brought smiles and merriment to his many
admirers who thronged the courtroom until
they had to be quieted by ono of his dea
cons, In substanco he declared with much em
phasis that ho was no tyrant, surrounded
by hordes of willing slaves, Ilather, ho ex
plained how ho worked tirelessly for tho
good of his community, somctlmcA as much
as twenty-seven hours at a stretch. Ho
said he abhorred slaves and would allow
none to work for him who did not come to
him voluntarily. Ho gave Stevenson's tes
timony riaf. denial nnd said that bis brother-
in-law lied when he quoted Dowle's sister
as saying: "Thank God, we arc free from
that tyrannical rule now."
Admissions were drawn out that Dowlo
had' paid Stevenson JSo.OOO on account, but
that (30,000 of this was at onco turned
over to Dowle's sister, Mrs. Stevenson, who
at once gave It to Dowle, It is said, for
stock In tho lace Industries; $30,000 also
was given to Frank Woodward, but Dowle
insisted that was for debts Stevenson had
contracted.
The attornoy then drew from Dowle that
after parting with his entire business, in
cluding laco machinery, patterns and stock,
Stevenson got out of the bargain only
$3,000. Then Attorney Heoves tried to show
that tho entire liabilities of Zluu laco
industries were $1,108,000, Including stock,
dividends, etc., but Dowle said tho con
Jecturo was foolish.
Tho direct question was then put to
Dowlo whether ho believed that ho was
Elijah, tho prophet, to which ho replied
that he was willing to express hit views,
but that they wero nlrcady on record.

CHICAGO, Dec. 20. "I bellevo there Is
not a railroad or street railway In Illinois
that docs not bribe Jurlc.i. It looks to mo
as If thero was a trust of theso corpora
tionsa club nnd that Lynch wns their
clearing houso for such corruption."
Theso sentences figured In one of the
climaxes of Attorney C. M. Hardy's speech
tonight In thu trial of Alexander Sullivan
on tho chnrgo of conspiracy to keep J. J.
Lynch out of tho Jurisdiction of Cook county
courts. Tho testimony In tho case had
been concluded during the dny and the
opening nrgumcnt for tho state was made
In the afternoon. A night session wns hold
and Mr. Hardy mado an argument for the
defense.
It Is hoped tho enso will go to tho Jury
tomorow night. Attornoy Hardy declaimed
persistently against tho bribery of Juries,
but ho contended that the practice was
without tho knowledge of the defendant nnd
that Alexander Sullivan was used as a
cloak to conceal the culprits.
This was nftcr some tlmo had been de
voted to nrgumcnt showing that Lynch
had no connection with Sullivan In tho
matter of bribing Juries and little com
munication with htm In n'uy wny. The
statutory definition ' nf conspiracy, Mr.
Hardy said, required the, engagement of
two or moro persons, This, he Insisted,
the stnto had yet to prove In tho case of
Alexander Sullivan.

CONDITIONS GOOD FOR BIG BUSINESS
Collector Tell of Ills Iteeent Hsperl

on Whnt He linn I'.n
cou titered.
"If tho spring of 1902 opens as well as
now seems probable, Omaha will havo such
a business In 'implements and hardware as
It nover experienced before," was the posi
tive statement of a collector for ono of
tho largest farm supply firms In the west
as, he talked with a former salesman at tho
Murray hotel last night.
"No wagons or buggies or corn shollcrs
or grinders wero sold last fall because
everybody had been made economical by
tho partial crop failure, and the result will
be a double demand In tho spring that will
literally overwhelm the wholesalers and
factories. This last snow was a real bles
sing to the many Nebrnskans who had sown
winter wheat and tho condition of tho lat
ter Is now most; promising, for the ground
was originally well saturated with (be nec
essary moisture. It Is, 1 have learned, a
fact that the rainfall In the western part
of this state nftcr last summer's hot stcgo
was finally broken, amounted to about
forty-one Inches, which Is at least ono Inch
more than the totnl of tho fall of tho av-
ago year. It took tho life out of the buffalo
grass on which many cattle .arc usually
wintered, but otherwise It was wholly ben
eficial and wo will all reap tho benefit In
tho spring.
Collector, linn n Snnp
"Another pleasant thing to report now
at the close of the year Is tho slnecuro that
tho collector for Implement bouses has.
Never slnco 131)2, whon I first went Into the
business, havo I known money to be as easy
In Ncbraskn, with tho exception of the
heavy crop years of 18!8 nnd 1899. Origi
nally my firm had seven collectors on the
road for months nt a time. Now It has
Just one. Iast July wo, llko everybody
else, felt that conditions wcro going to bo
very bad and took precaution to fortify our
selves, but It has proved wholly unneces
sary. Our collector simply goes to our
country customer and gets his money at the
promised time. Indeed, It Is a fact that the
principal complaint of my Arm Is that too
many of the country dealers are availing
themselves of the discount for cash. And
this Is true of nearly tho whole territory
tributary to Omaha, Including South Da
kota.
"As for tho partial crop failure, I am In
clined to believe that It was something of
a blessing, It reduced tho volume of sales
some at tho time, but those people who
patched up their old Implements and wag
ons last fall will have to buy now ones In
tho spring nnd In the meantlmo they have
learned the over useful lesson of frugality
and thrift, while tho grain they did raise
sold at better prices than If the crop bad
been larger.
Hxcrptlon to Prove Itnte.
"Of course my statement that all a col
lector has to do Is to go call for his money
is not applicable In all cases. Last October,
a retailor in a small town in tho westcru
part of tbo state who had established good
credit by paying cash for many bills of
'goods,' got a largo consignment from us and
$3,000 worth from an Omaha hardware Arm.
One afternoon he hold an Impromptu clos
, lag out salo and all that was left of !iis
stock vanished after dark. We found ve
hicles and Implements strangely like our
own at tho homes, of somo of bis, friends
afterward, but the only satisfaction we
could over get from him was an offer to
thrash any man that tho company sent to
seo him, and though wo know where he Is
today wo hcstltatc to prosecute became of
tho peculiar leniency of Nebraska laws
toward thoso who dlsposo of goods bought
under contract."

MOTHERHOOD
la a natural instinct which shows itself
in the girl as soon as she Is big enough
to play the mother to her doll. Unfor
tunately the womanly health does not
always keep pace with the motherly in
stinct, and when
.IvJ., real motherhood
-Vf J comes it often
comes to mothers
.who suffer intol-
Icrably during ma
Iteruity and who
'are unable to
nurse the weak
ling child which
frets and moans
in their arms.
Motherhood is
prepared for and
prbvided for by
I the use of Dr.
en
I Pierce's Favorite
Prescription. It
cures nausea,
nerves, gives a
healthy nppetite
and promotes rest
V ful sleep. It
makes the baby's
