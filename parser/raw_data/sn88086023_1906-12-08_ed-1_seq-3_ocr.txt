Club Notes
T. A. C.
Mrs. C. F. Colesworthy and Mrs.
Fred Locklcy entertained the mem
bers of the Thursday Afternoon club
this week. On account of the near
approach of the holiday season it was
wisely decided not to huve a study
program.
The diversion of the afternoon was
a unique guessing contest, consisting
of attractive little pictures represent
ing questions and their answers, sus
pended about the walls. The test lay
In the ability of the contestants to
find the correct answer, which was
often an enigma or a robus. The re
sult was a tie for the first honors, but
In the draw which followed, the first
prize, a batidsome souvenir spoon, was
awarded to Mrs. B. Huffman, nnd to
Mrs. Prideun the second.
Delicious refreshments were served
In the dining room, Mrs. T. C. Taylor
presiding at the coffee, assisted by
Mrr. Lnntz and Miss Adnah Raley.
The next meeting will he January
J. 1907. nt the home of Mrs. John
Halley, Jr. The subject Is "Our Com
mon Birds."
History Class.
The history department of the
Thursday Afternoon club has been or
ganized and consists of about 20 mem
bers. The time will be devoted to a
thorough and systematic study of the
history, literature and present con
dition of France, and a study of nrt
In general. The Bay View course has
been adopted. Those who are famil
iar with this course know what a de-
Mny Not Rebuild Xumpu Foundry,'.
It rill! remains undecided as to
whether the Nampa foundry and ma
chine shops which were destroyed by
fire here lost week are to be rebuilt,
or whether the local business men are
going to allow the chance of a lifetime
to slip through their fingers to some
ne'-ghfcoilng locnllty. The Insurance
adjusters are on the ground, but not
a word has leaked out In regard to the
rebuilding of the plant.
Between $8000 and $9000 worth of
work Is available should the plant be
rehullt at once. The question Is, can
Nimpa of.'ord to lose an Institution'
employing between 25 and 30 men nnd
doing close to JfiOOO worth of business
through the local banks each month.
Now that the question has been put to
the Commercial club It Is to be hoped
the cluh will take Immediate and ag
gressive action, that will Insure the
rebuilding of the plant. Nampa Record.
