The bill to incorporate the Cumber?
land Valley Unaka Railway passed its
third and final reading in the Senate
Friday and was sent to the House, where
its successful passage is a matter of
course. Considerable local interest at?
taches to the fortune of the bill, as the
- in corpora tors only await its enactment
to give out contracts for the extension of
their road from the northwestern boun?
dary of Ocooee County, on through
South Carolina, on a line to Charleston.
The contracts for the building of the road
have already been given out on the route
through North Carolina and Tennessee,
and the probability is that as soon as the
bill passes work will be simultaneously
prosecuted from this end of the ronte
also. The incorporators and" builders of
the road are wealthy owners of mining
lands in North Carolina and Tennessee
who are seeking an outlet for their ores,
which they will bring here by rail and
export to foreign countries per steamship.
It is noteworthy that the road is being
built upon- their own responsibility and
without the usual county aid, for which
.*. they do not propose to ask. The route
proposed is as follows: From Nashville,
via Knoxville, striking the South Carolina
line at the northwest boundary of Oconee
County, Ga., thence in a southeasterly
. direction through the counties of Oconee,
Anderson, Abbeville, Edgefield, Aiken
Barnwell, Colleton and Berkely into
Charleston.

the usuky law.
The following is a summary of the
speech of Representative Brown in the
House of Representative on the Usuiy
Law, delivered Nov. 29,1887, on the Bill
introduced by Representative Hudgens
of Anderson:
That in 1777 the Act was first passed
reducing the rate of interest to 7 per
cent. This continued until 1866, through
a period of nearly ninety years, well
evincing the wisdom of this ancient law.
It is well for us some times to look back
and see what those who have gone before
us have done and said. It may not be
amiss to read tbe preamble to this Act
and see if what these legislators said was
true:
"Whereas, by the constant and uni?
form experience of all States and nations
for all ages past, it has been found that a
moderate and reasonable interest or
annual premium for monies lent on con?
tracts is productive of the most beneficial
effects to a State, by promoting the circu?
lation of specie as a medium of com?
merce, and rendering the attainment of
money easy to the poor and industrious,
whereby the honest and laborious, being
furnished with the means of labor and
industry, are encouraged to pursue their
respective employments and arts with
diligence and appreciation, thereby giv?
ing rise and progression to tbe arts,
extending and diffusing trade and com?
merce, advancing and improving
agriculture and good husbandry, every
occupation becomes flourishing and suc?
cessful, tbe strength, wealth, credit, and
power of a people is supported and
increased, and peace, plenty, liberty and
happiness become firmly established
amongst them; in order, therefore, to
promote ends so beneficial and desirable
"? it enacted * * * * That no
person from and after the third day of
January one thousand seven hundred
and Beventy-seven, upon any contract,
shall take above the value of seven
pounds for the forbearance of one hun?
dred pounds for one year," &c.
The results which followed proved
them to be true, and the progress and
prosperity during that long period proved
the wisdom of the law. In 1866 when
there was a common struggle for exis?
tence, when the country was in the
depths of poverty, the law was changed
with the view of bringing capital into the
country and the door opened wide allow?
ing any rate of interest. In 1877 the
war and Radicalism being things of the
past, our Democratic Legislature restored
the Usury law, making, as it were, a
centennial restoration of this ancient and
wise law under which many of the mem?
bers of this House have lived. It was
thought by many at tbat time to be
unwise, but it is submitted that the surest
test of the wisdom of any law are the
reBults which follow its passage. The
good results following the passage of the
Ar.L_.of -.1317- -TVBre established, and its
wisdora^iovln by keeping of force dur?
ing nearly /a century. It wa3 only
changed from the force of circumstances
growing out of a disastrous war. Now,
what good results followed the Act of
1877? Very soon the country began to
prosper; thrift and enterprise prevailed;
money began to be plentiful; money was
advertised in the newspapers to loan at 7
per cent.; land in the country was selling
at prices never before known; ordinary
farming lauds, uplands, sold at fifteen
dollars per acre; every branch of indus?
try prospered in a degree hitherto
unknown. It was, indeed, the golden
era of cur country's prosperity. Now, in
the midst of all this prosperity, this law
for some reason was changed, and the
limit raised to 10 per cent. A brief
period of live years, and on tbe 22nd day
of December, 1882, without any apparent
good reason, it became one of the things
of the past. It is urged upon every
member of this House to look back upon
these times and see if these things are so.
It is said that the law was changed to
allow foreign corporations to lend money
in this State; tbat they would bring in
capital, make money cheap and develop
the country. Now to pay interest to
foreign loan companies makes the coun?
try so much poorer for every dollar of
interest bo paid. But when paid to our
own people tbe country is just as rich as
it was the morning before it is paid.
Results prove what rate is good and what
is not. Good results followed the usury
law of 1877 up to the period of its repeal
in December, 1882. Since then the re?
sults have been evil and the conntry has
languished?lands have fallen to half
their former worth, and every material
interest of the country has-been suffering.
When interest was low the country pros?
pered ; when it was high it languished.
The members of this House, who. have
been observers of these results are asked
to support this bill and by their votes
call a halt in this age of progress and
adopt at least one of the ancient land
marks handed down to us by tbe fathers
of the republic.
Ye Olden Times.
From the Hartwell Sun.
Bbo. Magill : On reading an item in
your Shoal Creek correspondence, about
wagoning cotton from Pendleton, S. O,
to Charleston, I remember H. N. Bishop
well.- We called him "Uncle Nickey."
He, D. K. Hamilton, William Walker,
and others, bauled cotton to Charleston
and goods back at $1.50 per hundred
each way1 and sometimes my father, paid
$2.00 per hundred on goods. There
were no railroads in those days, and no
banks except in large cities. Merchants
had to haul their money, and rode on
horseback to Charleston. On one occa?
sion my father bad a large amount of
I silver coin. He took a strong barrel, put
some beeswax in, then poured the silver
in, then melted wax and poured into the
barrel to keep it from gingling. When
he got to Charleston he had to melt the
wax off the coin. The wagoner said he
thought it was tbe heaviest barrel ot wax
he ever saw.
People were happy in those days; had
plenty to eat, made at home; wore
homespun clothes; and many a healthy,
beautiful girl spun and wove her wedding
dress. Every farmer had his tan-vat,
his own leather, and had the boys' hats
made from his own sheep; tbe bats
would last ten years or longer, if the
boys' heads did not get too big for them,
and the hats were about as heavy as a
cast-iron not. Such a bat would now
break a dude's neck to wear it. The
girls rode horseback to church, and
churches were not so plentiful as now.
Eight to ten miles was thought conven?
ient. People bad religion in a milder
form then than now, but it stuck to them
longer.
Ia 1812, Jesse Cleveland and my
father did business in Spartanburg, S. C.
Jesse did the wagoning for the concern.
On one occasion Jesse drove a four-horse
wagon loaded with rabbit skins and gin?
seng to the city of Philadelphia. He
wrote back that on a certain Sunday at 3
p. m. they would see him coming down
the hill at Dick Thompson's mill, a short
distance out of town. At tbe time
appointed tbe boys heard his whip crack
at the top of the hill. "Old B."
Penning Cattlo With Electricity.
Chicago, December 8.?Gen. Martin
Beem, as attorney for a Chicago firm, to?
day completed a contract to apply a
patent which possesses many elements of
novelty to the barb-wire fence of the K.
I. T. Cattle Company, in tbe Pan Handle,
Texas. Tbe patent is a process by which
a constant current of electricity is passed
either through barb wire or through a
plain galvanized wire. The first contact
is enough to prove to any animal that
tbe fence is loaded. At present a barb
wire fence surrounds tbe range in ques?
tion, and tbe current will be passed
through the top wire. Telephonic com?
munication can also be made from any
point to headquarters by attaching a
ground wire and a small telephone, one
of which will be carried by each cowboy.
Any break in the fence will also be noted
at headquarters by the ringing of a bell.
The range is that received by Senator
Farwell, his brother, J. V. Farwell, and
Abner Taylor for building the Texas
Statehouse. The company owns the
120,000 cattle enclosed in this vast range.
Senator Murray's School District Bill.
Mr. Editor : One of the most itnpor
I tant measures claiming the attention of
the present session of the Legislature, is
the Bill of our Senator providiug for the
re-districting of the entire County of
Anderson into School Districts of four
miles square, or as near that as practica?
ble. So far as the Educational interests
of the State are involved, the Bill of Mr.
Murray is the sine qua non of the future
success of the public school system. It
would hardly be possible to enlist the
whole State at once into the support of
tbe measure, hence it is altogether
proper to initiate the measure in Ander
| son County, where the public sentiment
is so largely in favor of it. We do not
propose now to discuss the Bill on its
merits, but only to express our hearty
appreciation of its provisions generally,
hoping that it will receive the unani?
mous approval of our entire delegation,
and thus ensure its adoption by the Leg?
islature. T. H. R.
Blalnc on the Message.
New York, December 8.?The 7W6
line's Paris correspondent gabled to that
paper a report giving the views of Blaine
on tbe President's message. Blaine said
to the Tribune's representative:
"I have been reading an abstract of
tbe President's message, and have been
especially interested in tbe comments of
the London papers. These papers all
assume to declare tbat tbe message is a
free trade manifesto, and evidently are
anticipating an enlarged market for
English fabrics in tbe United States as a
consequence of the President's recom?
mendations. Perhaps thuit fact stamped
the character of the message more clearly
than any words of mine can."
"You don't mean actual free trade
without duty ?" queried tbe reporter.
"No," replied Blaine. "Nor do the
London papers mean that. They sim?
ply mean that the President has recom?
mended what in the United States is
known as a revenue tariff, rejecting the
protective feature as an object, and not
even permitting protection to result
freely as an incident to revenue duties."
"I don't know that I quite comprehend
tbat last point," said the reporter.
"I mean," said Blaine, "that for the
first time in the history of the United
States the President recommends retain?
ing an internal tax in order that the
tariff may be forced down even below a
fair revenue standard. He recommends
that tbe tax on tobacco be retained, and
thus that many millions annually should
be levied on a domestic product which
wou'd far better come from the tariff on
foreign fabrics."
? Blaine favors the repeal of the tobacco
tax.
He said: "I should urge that it be
done at once, even before tbe Christmas
holidays. It would, in the first place,
bring great relief to the growers of
tobacco all over the country, and would
materially lower the price of tbe article
to the consumer. Tobacco to millions of
men is a necessity. The President calls
it a luxury in no other sense than tea or
coffee are luxuries. The only excuse for
such a tax is tbe actual necessity under
which the Government found itself
during tbe war and the years immedi?
ately following. To retain the tax now
in order to destroy protection, which
would incidentally flow from raising the
same amount of money on foreign
imports, is certainly a most extraordinary
policy for our government."
"Well, then, Mr. Blaine, would you
advise the repeal of the whiskey tax
also?"
"No, I would not. Other considera?
tions than those of financial administra?
tion are to be taken in account with
regard to whiskey. There is a moral
Bide to it. To cheapen the price of
whiskey is to increase consumption enor?
mously. There would be no sense in
urging the reform wrought by high
license in many Slates if tbe National
Government neutralizes the good effect
by making whiskey within tbe reach of
overy one at 25 cents a gallon. Whiskey
would be everywhere distilled if the sur
veilance of the Government were with?
drawn by the remission of the tax, and
illicit sales could not then be prevented
even by a policy as rigorous aod search?
ing as that with which Russia pursues
the Nihilists. It would destroy high
license at once in all tbe States. Whis?
key has done a vast deal of harm in the
United States. I would try to make it
do Borne good. I would use the tax to
fortify our cities and seaboard. In view
of the powerful letter addressed to tbe
Democratic party on the subject of forti?
fication by the late Samuel J. Tilden in
'1885,1 am amazed that no attention has
been paid to the subject by the Demo?
cratic Administration. Never before in
the history of the world has any Govern?
ment allowed great cities on the seaboard,
like Philadelphia, New York, Boston,
Baltimore, New Orleans and San Fran?
cisco, to remain defenceless."
MoviDg on tha Solid South,
Washington, December 9.?There is
no doubt that the Republicans will make
a vigorous effort next year to carry sev?
eral of the Southern States. Virginia,
West Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee and
North Carolina are cousidered by them
debatable ground.
J. Hale Sypher, who formerly as a
Republican represented one of tbe Louis?
iana districts in Congress, and who is
prominently identified with the National
Republican League, said to a Herald cor
I respondent last night tbat the canvass in
tbe foregoing States would be actively
prosecuted.
"We shall flood eveiy Congressional
district in the South with tariff docu?
ments. We shall send there some of our
strongest and most prominent men.
John Sherman, Joe Hawley, Tom Reed,
of Maine, Charley Grosvenor, of Ohio,
and others of like character will invade
the Democratic strongholds of the South
and preach the doctrine of protection
versus free trade as we construe the Dem?
ocratic policy."
It appears, however, that "Joe" Man
ley, Blaine's Augusta lieutenant, is not
so sauguine of immediate success in tbe
Southern States a3 Gen. Sypher and some
of the other Republicans affect to be.
He says he believes in making a fight for
everything.
"Eventually," he says, "I think we
shall carry some Southern States and kc
may lose Northern ones. There are
some States of the South that are just as
strongly protection as Pennsylvania.
Virginia is one of them, and Tennessee
is a State where there is good fighting
ground, though I hardly expect we can
carry that State in 1888. West Virgiuia
is also good fighting ground. I do Dot
look to see much break up in the South,
however, until we have won tbe National
Administration. I tbink if we had won
in 1884 we Bhould have had a divided
South to day."

Holland, Mich., December 9.?D.
B. Liesman came from Washington Ter?
ritory early in April last, and settled
seven miles south of New Richmond.
Besides furniture, clothing and the like,
be had a cow and a pig. Tbe cow took
to grazing away from home. Liesman
soon noticed that she was in tbe habit of
drinking from a spring some distance
from the house, though there was an
abundance of good fresh water nearer by.
Soon after the animal's hair began to
grow rapidly and the milk changed to a
dark color and was offensive to the taste.
The milk was fed to the pig and cat. The
hair of these animals also began to grow.
All three are now covered with a heavy
growth of hair. It is evidently due to
the water, which resembles that of Blue
Lick Springs, but is of a more unpleasant
smell.
? In Tiplon County, Tenn, there is a
young woman who is attracting attention
on account of her remarkable power over
horses and other animals. She can ride
and drive at a moment's notice horses
and mules that no one else can handle.
Invasion of the White House.
Washington", December 9.?The
White House this afternoon was invaded
by nearly 2,000 members of the Evan?
gelical Alliance who called in a body
about one o'clock to pay their respects to
the President and Mrs. Cleveland. They
were received in the East room and were
individually presented to the President
and Mrs. Cleveland by Wm. E. Dodge,
President of the Alliance and Col. John
M. Wilson.
Mr. Dodge made a brief address, ex?
pressing the great pleasure it gave the
Alliance as a body to show their appre?
ciation of the President and his wife,
who was especially loved and respected
by them all. He closed by urging the
President to cn operate with the Alliance
in the cause of Christianity. The Presi?
dent replied as follows:
"I am glad to meet so large a. delega?
tion from the Evangelical Alliance of
the United States. I understand the
purpose of this Alliance to be the ap?
plication of Christian rules of conduct
to the problems and exigencies of social
and political life. Such a movement
cannot fail to produce most valuable
results. All must admit that iBe recep?
tion of the teachings of Christianity
results in the purest patriotism, in the
most scrupulous fidelity to public trust,
and in the besl type of citizenship.
Those who manage the affairs of Gov?
ernment are by this means reminded that
the law of God demands that tbey should
be courageously true to the interests of
the people, and thac the Ruler of the
Universe will require of them a strict
account of their stewardship. The peo?
ple, too, arc thus taught that their hap?
piness and welfare will be best promoted
by conscientious regard for the interest
of the common brotherhood, and that
the success of government by the people
depends upon the morality, justice and
honesty of the people. I am especially
pleased to know that your efforts are not
cramped and limited by denominational
lines and that your credentials are found
in broad Christian fellowship. Manifest?
ly, if you seek to teach your countrymen
toleration, you yourselves must be toler?
ant. If you would teach them a liberal
regard for the opinions of each, you
yourselves must be liberal, and if you
would teach them unselfish patriotism,
you yourselves must be unselfish and
patriotic. There is enough of work in
the field you have entered to enlist the
hearty co-operation of all who believe in
the value and efficacy of Christian teach?
ing and practice.
Your noble mission, if undertaken in a
broad and generous spirit, will surely
arrest the attention and respectful con?
sideration of your fellow-citizens, and
your endeavors, consecrated by benevo?
lence and patriotic love, must exert a
powerful influence in the enlightenment
and improvement of our people, in illus?
trating the strength and stability of our
institutions and in advancing the pros?
perity and greatness of our beloved
land."
The Rev. Dr. Burchard, of New York,
(of "three R's" fame,) was among those
presented. The President recognized
him at ooce, and, advancing towards
him; said, with considerable earnestness
and fervor, that he was very glad to see
him. Whereupon the crowd of delegates
broke into hearty laughter.
The Evangelical Alliance has closed
its sessions, holding three crowded meet?
ings to-day. Bishop Samuel Harris, of
Michigan, was the principal speaker of
the morning session, at which he deliv?
ered an address upon the necessity of
substituting co-operation for competition
betweeu denominations.
Fun on the Track.
Augusta, Ga., "December 11.?Prob?
ably the most exciting race ever seen in
this section, was run on the South Caro?
lina road, a few evenings ago, and a
peculiar race it was.
An engine and train of cars chasing a
buck on the track made the race.
It was a bright moonlight night, in
fact, almost as bright as day. Tho up
South Carolina passenger train had just
crossed the Edisto River bridge, shortly
after eight o'clock, when Engineer
Roberts and bis fireman spied a large
deer on the track, some three or four
hundred yards ahead. The train moved
on, but the buck stood with head erect,
gazing at the approaching locomotive
until it seemed that the cowcatcher would
strike it. At that moment, with a quick
movement, it wheeled and started off up
the track at lightning speed. The engi?
neer was in for a race, having a straight
track ahead, and quickly opened bis
throttle. The ponderous machinebouud
ed forward and then the race commenced
in earnest. Down the track, at lightning
speed, ran the deer, closely pursued by
the engine, the engineer at the throttle
and the fireman shoveling in coal, both
doing their utmost to outrun the deer.
The conductor and passengers, wonder?
ing at the rapidity of the train, quickly
raised the windows and popped their
beads out to sec a sight never witnessed
by any one of them before. No one was
afraid, but all excited ; in fact, excite?
ment reigned supreme. All could see
the beautifnl buck ahead and in breath?
less anxiety were awaiting the termina?
tion of the race. Men cheered and ladies
clapped their hands, but on, on, like the
wind sped the deer, clearing ten to twelve
cross-ties at a bound and keeping from
twenty to thirty yards ahead of the
swiftly speeding train. The engineer
and conductor were even all excitement.
But "look 1 look I" cried everyone,
"the deer is losing ground." True it
was. The engine commenced to gain
slowly, but perceptibly, and in the next
halt mile the deer was only a few feet in
front, when suddenly it bounded off the
track and into the woods.
The deer was pursued two miles and
the race was probably the most exciting
of the kind ever witnessed.
A Sleep of Death.
Several weeks ago an incident was
chronicled in the Daily News of a some?
what novel nature. Mrs. Clark, the wife
of the Rev. W. A. Clark, the Methodist
minister in charge of tho Tumbling
Shoals circuit, who lives just beyond the
Laurens line, was kicked by a horse and
very severely injured. Her injuries were
not considered serious, however, and
after being confined to her room for a
week or two, she was able to get up and
walk around. She had apparently
recovered from her injuries.
On Tuesday of this week, Mrs. Clark
experienced sudden and unexpected
symptoms. On that day, she went to
sleep, and slept soundly through the
night. On the morning, she did not
awake. As the day wore on her slum?
ber was unbroken, and the fears of her
family were aroused. Three physicians
were called in, but they were unable to
.break the heavy stupor into which the
patient seemed to have fallen. And the
slumber was unbroken, until after contin
uingforniorethan twenty-four hours, Mrs.
Clark died. She had slept for 24 hours
without waking and unto death.
The physicians who attended Mrs.
Clark pronounce the case an anomalous
one. Her sudden and peculiar death
after an apparent recovery was a source
of deep sorrow to her family and friends.

Bcnth Caused by a Girl's Bile.
Baltimore, Dec. 8.?Dorothy Wil?
liams, a young nnmarried woman, was
tried to-day on an indictment charging
her with manslaughter, in causing the
death of Charles H. Small. She had
bitten the young man on the thumb,
which resulted in erysipelas and death.
There had been a love affair between the
two some two years ago, but they bad
since been estranged. Dorothy occupied
a room in tbe same house in which Small
and his mother lived. A rumor was
started derogatory to the character of
Dorothy, and she accused Small of being
the author of it. An altercation arose
between the two, the woman attacking
Small with a base ball bat. He took it
from her, and in tbe scuffle she caught
his thumb between her teeth and bit it,
which the post morion physician testified
whs the cause of his death. The jury
brought in a verdict of guilty, and Judge
Duffy sentenced her to two years in jail.
A Bold Train Robbery,
Little Rock, Ark., Dec. 10.?-The
north bound passenger train on the St.
Louis, Arkansas and Texas railroad was
boarded last night by three masked men
at Genoa, a small station ten miles from
Texarkana. They mounted the engine
and compelled the engineer to stop at a
dense wood two miles from the station.
The robbers then broke in the express,
car door, over powered the messenger
and forced him to unlock his safe from
which it is stated they secured $40,000,
and escaped into the forest without dis?
turbing the passengers or the mail agent.
Conductor Nicols made several attempts
to get out and protect tbe express mat ter,
but tbe robber's Winchester soon drove
him back. Tbe Governor has offered
$200 reward, and the Express Company
$500 for the capture of tbe men. The
whole country surrounding the scene of
the robbery has been alive to day with
posses bunting for them. The authori?
ties feel confident of capturing them.
? J. G. Meyers, a youug inventor of
Washington, has invented a plan which
he believes to be superior to cremation,
burial, or any other ancient or modern
method of treating dead bodies. The new
Mausoleum and Safe Deposit for the
Dead is the name of this new contrivance.
Mr. Meyers's plan may be regarded'as a
compromise between the two extremes of
interment and cremation. In a fire-proof
building, spaces will be provided just
large enough to hold a single coffin.
When a dead body is placed in one of these
tbe door of tbe apartment is hermetically
sealed. Ruuning from these apartments
are tubes which bring air into tbe dead
rooms and also carry it downward by a
forced draft to a central furnace below,
where are consumed all gases and fluids
escaping from the bodies. Dead bodies
treated in this manner will, in a short
time, it is claimed, become naturally
preserved or dried, and so remain.
? There is a curious well of water at
the Kelly place, near Mr. Tyler Gaskin's
in this county. The well is about twenty
feet deep, and the water on one side of it
is all the time bubbling up like water
when it is boiling. On the opposite side
of the well the water is in a constant
state of agitatioD, sizzing and popping
as though it was confined in a hot vessel.
The noise can be heard some distance
from the well. The water is cold and
fine for use. This information is obtain?
ed from a gentleman who has recently
seen the well, and who says it is a great
curiosity. This phenomenon has been
going on for some time.? Williamsburg
County Record.
? John Slillman, tbe conductor on the
fated train which carried seventy-eight
souls to death at Chatsworth, HI., on tbe
night of the 11th ult., is visiting a broth?
er in Giinnell. ?Since the frightful oc?
currence Conductor Stillman has lost
forty-three pounds of flesh, his sleep is
filled with dreams of the terrible wreck,
and he has not known a night of restful
slumber since the accident. He is off on
a leave of absence from the road. They
have sent him off to go where he pleases
and stay as long as he wishes, with orders
to look to the company for anything he
wants, no matter what it is.
? Rev. W. C. Lindsay, pastor of the
Baptist church, of Columbia, at the be?
ginning of services Sunday morning said
be wanted to make a statement concern?
ing his recent attack on the Columbia
club. He then related tbe particulars of
what bad transpired between him and
the club committee several days ago, and
read the written denial of the committee
that the club allowed gambling, either
for pastime or money, on Sundays or any
other time. The doctor said he was glad
to have this statement from the club, and
expressed regret that he had in this par?
ticular done an injustice to the club.
? The rifleman of the future will
neatly perforate the enemy with a 30
calibre steel-covered bullet, the wounds
from which, it has been pointed out, wdl
heal much more rapidly than the gunshot
wounds made by the big and ragged 43
calibre bullets now in use. It is un?
doubtedly a point favor of the little bullet
that it wouldn't muss up the people
whom it might be sent out to slay. What
the man who should be killed would
thiuk about it is not likely to be known.
? Marion County has three brag far?
mers whose work is bard to beat. Mr.
Duncan McLaurin with one mule made
twenty-six bales of cotton, and a bounti-'
ful supply of com, fodder, potatoes and
peas. The cotton was made on twenty
five acres. Nelson Billings, a negro ten?
ant living on Capt W. H. Steed's planta?
tion, made sixteen bales of cotton and
plenty of provisions. A negro tenant on
Col E. T. Stackhouse's place has now to
bis credit $950 made tbe year.
? Reports from tbe Southern cotlou
mills show an important improvement,
the consumption of cotton having in?
creased 12,000 bales, or nerly 6* per cent
in tbe last six months. In the last three
months thirty-two cotton factories have
been established in the South. What is
more, many of tbe products of these cot?
ton mills are finding their way into fore?
ign markets.
? A Kentucky justice, in order to
decide the ownership of a hog Claimed
by two persons, released the porker, and
it* made a break for the sty in which it
bad been reared. The other claimant has
appealed from the judgment of the court
and the hog.
? A man being requested by a frieud
to buy him some books, forgot all about
tbe matter till he accidentally met him ;
then, in his confusion, he endeavored to
"set matters straight" by nonchalantly
remarking: "By the way, I never got the
letter you wrote about those books."

A Grateful Correspondent.
When a recipient of a bottle writes as
enthusiastically of the virtues of Calisaya
Tonic as did a daughter in a letter to her
father recently, it can only mean that the
Tonic is the best on the market. The let?
ter came from Wilmington, N. C. Tho
writer, after referring to the extraordinary
and wearing nature of her household
duties recently, snys: "I am confident
that I never should have held out had it
not been lor the bracing effects of the
admirable Tonic." Again the writer says:
"I am proud of Greenville's sons. Long
live Dr. Westmoreland, and may his name
be wido famed for tho preparation of so
excellent and palatable a medicine." * *
Several other highly complimentary refer?
ences are made in the letter to the splendid
effects of the Tonic. Westmoreland Bros,
only ask any one who is sufibring from
debility, loss of appetite or malaria, to try
their medicine. It is sure to revive and
strengthen. "And all itc03t is a dollar a
bottle."
Use Dr. Dukes' Anti-Bilious Wafers in
connection with the Tonic if your liver is
out of order.

.A.ND while it brings us many joya, it generally forestalls them with innumerable
perplexities. When one gives a Present the natural desire is to have it appreciated,
not only as a token of regard, but also for its beauty and utility as well, and so the
generous and judicious gift-maker finds himself or herself in a sea of troubled
doubts over other people's tastes and preferences, and has a realizing sense that
there is more depth to a loving heart than there is to the purses of ordinary mortals.
