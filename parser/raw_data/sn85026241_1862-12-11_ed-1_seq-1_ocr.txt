Everybody who knew John Gordon, knew
him to be the meanest aud moat contempti
ble man that was ever permitted to walk the
earth. Hik brother Peter was but little bet
ter, n it would appear that, meanness ran in
tlid blond of tho family. John was pretty
well off, fo faraa this world's good arc con
cerned. His property was all invested in
huildirifrs, which hud cost him thirty thous
and dollars. He did not marry til he was
forty, probably from the fear of incurring
unnecessary expense; and when finally he
did take a wife, it was as he would have ta
ken a l ouse keeper. a servant.
Mrs. Gordon was a poor young woman.
and had been obliged to work for a living,

have loved such an abortion of a man as
John Gordon. She took good care ofhiiu.
better than he deserved, and was in cvnty
.espect an obedient and tuithful wife. All
she received in roturn was tho meager sup
port her husband's home afforded.
When they had been marriod about three
.months, John was taken sick, and lingered
along for a year, during which time his wife,
was an excellent, novoiea wire, ner wnnie
aim seemed to be to discharge her duty to
him with fidelity. She had made a bargain
with him, and she purforiued her part of
the contract with scrupulous exactness.
One day I heard that John Gordon was
dead. It was a small loss to the communi
ty; nud 1 did not think of pitying his wifu.
for her lot would certainly be ameliorated
by hisdepurtiire. She would be entitled to
one third of the income of the reul estate,
which for a poor woman as she had been,
mid having no luxurious tastes to gratify,
would be a prince's stipend.

"It seem- that I tun not to have this,"
she replied, gloomily.
'Not to have it?"
"Peter Gordon has taken possession of

lie says that my husband sold it to him,
two weeks before ho died."
"How could that he?"
'Peter showed me the duud; lie says it

Does he? So much the better for you,
madam. Tho law gives you one half of his
personal estate-

He could not sell it without your con
currence. Uid you release your right ot

"Did you sign ur

"Then it's a forgery.

"No: I never told him."
I dismissed her, with the request that
she should eall next day, I wont at once to
the Registry ot Deeds, and tound that Mrs.
Gordon had told a straiuht storv. Her mis
arable contemptible husband had given his
property to bis brother, in his last days, so
as to eheat hia wife who cared for his health
and nursed him, in sickness, out of her just
olaima upon his estate.
He was a villain, but 1 need not say

be proved that Mrs. Unrdon oould uot write
her name; who had seen her make her mark,
often, within a short time. i
The persod'Who professed to have wit

was to arrest Him on a charge ot fraud, and

"But tho wife had one-third interna on

"It was sold to ma, and she ligoed away

"Did she?" v . f

Thoughts Essential to Health.
If wo would have our bodies healthy, our
brains must be used, and used in orderly and
vigorous ways, that the life-giving streams
of force may flow from them into the expec
tant organs, which can minister but as they
are ministered unto. We admire the vigor
ous animal life of the Greeks, and with jus
tice we recognize and partly seek to imitate
the various gymnastic and other means
which they employed to secure it. But,
probably, we should make a fatal error if we
omitted from our calculations the hearty and
generous earnestness with which the high
est subjects of art, speculation and polities
were perused by thorn. Surely in their
oase the beautiful and energetic lite was
expressed in the athletic and graceful frame.
And were it a more extravaga nee to ask
whether some part of the lassi tudo and wear
iness of life, of which we hear so much iu
our day, might bo due to lack of mental oc
cupation on worthy .-subjects, exciting and
ropavinir a aenernus enthusiasm, as well as
to an over-exeroisa on lower ones, whether
an ongtossment on matters which have not
substance enough to justify or satisfy the
mental grasp, be not at the root of some of
the maladies which altecl our montal con
valescence? Any one who tries it soon finds
out how wearying, how disproportionately
exliaustinir is an overdose of "liitht litera
ture" compared with an equal amount of
time spent on real work. Ut this we may
be euro, that due exercise of brain of
thought is one of the essential elements
of human life. The perfect hcnli h of a man
is' not the same as that of an ox or a horse.
The preponderating cupucity of his nervous
part demands a corresponding lite. Lorl

It's Dark.
The following beautiful sentiment is taken

"It is dark when the honest and honorable

Dark when the light, patteiingfeet no more

were neither creditable nor excusable. O
The soldiers actually engagea in tnese
battles fought with great bravery, but many
thousands straggled away from their com
mands, and it is said not a few voluntarily
surrendered to the enemy, so as to be purol
od as prisoners of war. It isaddod that hud
the army of the Potomac arrived a few days
earlier, the rebel army could have been easily
defeated, and nerhans destroved.
The losses at South Mountain and Antie-
tam are put at 1,742 killed. 8,066 wounded.
and JI3 missing; a total or iu.uuu.
Tho report states that the army rested on
the North bank of tho Potomac, near
Sharpsburg, from the 17th of September
until the 26th of Ootobor, and says that the
long inactivity of so large an army in the
lace of a defeated toe, and during the most
favorable season for rapid 7narobes- and
vigorous campaign, was a matter of great
disappointment and regret.
Gen. Hal lock states that he telegraphed
to Gen. McCiellan, October 6th, to cross
tho river. Gen. MeClellun disapproved of
the plan of crossing South of tho Blue Hidgo.
but proposed to cross at Harper sv evry ana

passage occupying till November 3d.
During this period Gen. McCiellan stop

rebel troops in that vicinity are pretending
to be mas.ing for battle, but are in reality
guarding the retreating trains. Chattanooga
is the only outlet for grain and supplies to

A fanner of this County concluded a few
weeks since that he would get along without

wanted a1age EastefnPaperr He' diseoh
tinned the paper. A few days since ho call
ed at our offije and told us that he was sat
isfied that he had already lost fifty dollars
by the operation. He desired to buy a lot
ol lumber, just such us was sold nt ('amp
Harlan, but not having the Journal, did not
see the notice nf the tale, and heard noth
ing of it until tho day was passed and the
lumber all sold. He is satisfied that he
will have to pay fifty dollars more for lum

than what he could have bought at the above

hat wo are doing with tha proprietor of

not intentionally, but by sheer carelessness.
I toll you, sir, you must change all this.
I see it clearly. You must insist upon pay

Modern Democrats.
When modern Democrats are tested by
the facts of the record, and when a fair
comparison otthoiracts with their profession
is made, we discover at once the ical au
thors of our present national embarrass
ments. A western cstemporary has enumer
ated these tacts, whicn we commend to the
perusal and remembrauce of every loyal
man in the land:
It is a fact the only persons from the
North, who have been found by us in the
rebel army, aud tuken prisoners, are Dem
ocrats. It is a fsnt that the only parties at tho
North who justify or apologize for the rebels
are Democrats.
It is a tact that the only party in tbe
North supported by tba disloyal, is the
Democratic.
It is a faot that the only men elected tn
office at the North about whose loyalty
there is any question, are elected by Dem
ocrats.
It is a tact th it the only disloyal uowspa-
ners at the North are Ddinocratio.
it is a tact tnai me nniy pairrra wnirn
havo been suppressed for their treasonable
utterances are Democralio.
It is a tnot that the only northern apolo
imts and oetenders ot tue institution ot
slavery are Democrats.
It is a faot that the only pantos who la
ment over the abolition ot slavery tu the
District ot Columbia are Democrats.
It is a fact that the only parly which op
poses the complete prostration of tho rebel
lion by the foree of arms is the Democratic.
It is a tact that all the opposition to a tun
and complete vindication of the majesty of
the Uovernment, in this unholy wat upon
it. comes from the Democrats.
Let our Republican readers make a note
Of these fact, and when assailed by a Dem
ocrat, quietly ask lor a comparison ot reo

SEVERAL Democratic papers have already
hmatd tha name ot Vallandigham as the
