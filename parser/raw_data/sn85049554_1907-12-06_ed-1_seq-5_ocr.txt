JOHN BROADHEAD DEAD-
End of Pioneer Business Man of This
City Comes Peacefully.
Within twenty-four days of his 82
birthday, John Broadhead died at the
home of his daughter, Mrs. H. V.
Speers, at 5 o'clock this morning. The
end came to him quietly without pain
and without a struggle. He was at
tended by his daughter, Miss Martha
Broadhead, who, while attempting to
assist him to rise from the bed, felt
him relax in death in her arms.
Mr. Broadhead had been troubled
with asthma all of his life, the afflic
tion disqualifying him for military
service in the civil war times. Some
ten years ago he suffered a stroke of
paralysis, from which he only parti
ally recovered, and which l£?ft his vo
cal chords badly paralyzed ever since,
altho he has been able to be about the
house and on the streets.
Mr. Broadhead leaves four daughters
and one son, Charles Broadhead, of

larger and more influential of the
two, would probably have a bigger
voice in the selection of the pastor of
the consolidated church.
Iowa Churches Wanted Him.
Had not the committee from this
city heard of Rev. Mr. McGee and
decided to recommend him as pastor at
Marshalltown, the chances are Mr. Mc
Gee would have come to Iowa anyway.
The Iowa City church had extended
him a call, as had also the church at
Shenandoah. The Fourth church at
Minneapolis, had invited Mr. McGee to
visit them and preach next Sunday,
with a view of considering extending
him a call.
McGee a Young Man.
Mr. McGee is a young man, 35 years
old. His family consists of a wife and
•little daughter of 4. Mr. McGee was
educated at Kalamazoo College, a
Baptist school at Kalamazoo, Mich.
Colgate University, Hamilton, I£. Y\,
and at the University of Chicago, talc
ing his theology in the divinity school
of the latter university.

most three years.

tention by Expelling Internal
The Interest created in leading cities
during the. past year by young Mr.
Cooper with his new preparation, is
largely accounted for by a peculiar
quality possessed by this medicine,
which he calls his New Discovery.
Mr. Cooper believes that internal
parasites, or tapeworms, are respon
sible for much ill health, and it is an
undoubted fact that his medicine has
expelled immense numbers of these
creatures in various citics visited by
him. The young man also believes
that stomach trouble is the main cause
of all ill health. Ho claims that few
can have poor health with a good di
gestion. He further claims that his
New Discovery medicine does nothing
ljut tone up the stomach, yet :it not
only expels the parasites, but relieves
many other ailments not as a rule as
sociated with stomach trouble.
Little Jessie Birdsall, daughter of
Mrs. Ida Birdsall, living at 2138 Car
roll Avenue, Chicago, is among many
relieved of a large parasite by Mr.
Cooper's preparation during his stay
in that city. In speaking of the mat

Judge Bradshaw's Dccrce Dis
misses Dr. Cantomvine's Case
at Plaintiff's Cost
HELD HE CANNOT RECOVER
Judge Bradshaw, in- His Ruling, Held
That Not Sufficient Duress Had
Been Shown to Warrant Dr. Canton­
wine Recovering Money Turned Over
to Bosch Bros.
J-ty the decree of Judge C. B. Brad
shaw, in the district court tins morn
ing, the cause brought by Dr. K. A.
Cantonwine against Bosch Bros., of
Vanc'leve, to recover $6,165.74, claimed
to liavo been extorted from him by
threats, was dismissed at Dr. Canton
wine's cost. Judge Bradshaw held in
•tile remarks, with which he preluded
his decision, that sufficient duress had
not been shown to warrant Dr. Can
tonwine recovering.
The case was tried before Judge
Bradshaw several weeks ago, and fol
lowed ugly rumors and much talk in
Yancleve and its vicinity, where all of
the parties to the case arc well known.
Cantonwine's Guilt Not Shown.
In prefacing his decision Judge
Bradshaw said that if his decision
carried with it an Imputation of guilt
on the part of Dr. Cantonwine it was
not gathered from the evidence that
anv great amount had been stolen.
"The doctor's conduct:," hf: said, "is in
dicative and of far stronger evidence of
his guilt than any other evidence."
Threats Not Shewn.
Touching on the point of threats,
duress and threatened .prosecution.
which were among the strong points of
I Cantonwine's case. Judge Bradshaw
said that further than the statement
i.made by one of the members of the
firm' that tht-v would put Cantonwine
"where the dogs would not bite him
if lie did not refund to them, there
had been no other threats proved,
Taking up tfiis point' Judge Bradshaw
said, "So much depends, not on the
threats, but on the surroundings,
fViesp men knew each other for years,
'"'•e doctor was no weakling. He was
ihieated and was prospering in busi
ness. I think it was something else
tlvt induced him to turn over the
property more than the mere threat."
Thinks Arrangement Was Made.
Judge Bradshaw held that all ar
rn ivnents to turn over the notes,
cer': ,'ic \tes of deposit and other prop
erty is made in the machinery ha.l I
of I'le store early of the morning of
the tr 'ii .action. There seemed to be,
Judn'f idshaw said, no negotiating,
and .'. dickering about the amount,
and Ci it when Bosch Bros, afterwards
wtnt to cantonwine's home, the doc
tor is there and had gotten ready the
notes and certificates of deposit, ready
to make settlement.
He held that the fact that Bosch
Bros, called Cantonwine to the rear of
the store and broached the matter of
the shortage and settlement to him,
that it was what the average employ
er would have done with an employe
under similar circumstances.
Brief History of Case.
Dr. Cantonwine is a physician of
Vancleve. For two or more years he
had worked at different times in the
Bosch Bros, store. Shortages were in
creasing in the business, and ono
morning last April Bosch Bros, called
Cantonwine to account, and demanded
that he pay them $7,000. Cantonwine
claimed that they fhreatened to pros
ecute and imprison him. At any rate
Cantonwine turned over to the firm
and its members notes and certificates
of deposit totaling $6,165.74. It was this
amount Cantonwine sought to recover
by this suit.

PECULIAR PROPERTIES
OF NEW MEDICINE
Cooper Preparation Attracts Widespread At­
Parasites.
the trouble was. She was extremely
nervous the least little thing would
upset her her tongue was coated, and
at times she would have a good ap
petite, then again could not bear the
sight of food she was restless at
night, had a bad breath, especially
when she got up of mornings. We
tried everything to relieve her, but
met with no success. We were just
on the point of giving up trying any
thing else, when we began to read of
Cooper's New Discovery. Several days
ago we purchased this medicine. Jes
sie has been using it regularly, and
this morning this parasite left her
system, I don't wonder that she has
always felt bad, and nothing we would
give her seemed to relieve her. Now
that she is relieved of this tapeworm
I feci sure that she will grow better
each day, and enjoy perfect health.
Mr. Cooper, your mecjicire is worth a
thousand times more than you charge
for it. I know of a number of people
troubled the same way as Jessie has
been, and I certainly expect to tell
them personally to try your medicine."
Wo would advise anyone who has
been troubled for some time with gen
eral poor health to try this great med
icine. We are agents for it in this city.
