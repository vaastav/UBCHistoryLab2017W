When the $10,000 general damage

of Daniel C. Herring against the
United Verde Copper Company were
called from the calendar on Mon
day in the Superior Court, Robert
K. Morrison, attorney for the plain-

be set for trial later.

tM-tiitive to open new markets for
American industries these arc the
more striking features of President
Tail's fourth annual message sent
to Congress today.
The message is the first of a
mu-s of such communications which
hr will make to Congress in the
early days of the session, and deals
entirely with the foreign relations
if the United States. Beginning
with the usual reference to the ex
ultiig good relations with foreign America. He also adds that the di

"How strikingly erroneous is such
an impression may be seen from a
study of the results by which the
diplomacy of the United States can
be judged," says the President.
He mentions the arbitration trea
ties with France and Great Britain,
which failed of confirmation in the
Senate; the successful tripartite me

Brazil, and the United States, be

between Mail! and the Dominican
Republic on the verge of war, the

celebrated Tacna-Arica dispute be

(From Wednesday V Dally)
The arrival in Prescott of F. M.

the most noteworthy judicial event
coming to an em) in the history of
the nation pertaining to railroad in
stitutions.
From Mr. Murphy's prominent re
lations to the railroad world in re
cent years, and his close association
with the Santa Fc system, he was
asked by a representative of the
Journal-Miner if anything was likely

The other fuss is about the or-
ganizatiou n tnc legislature, mere
re two candidates, Hon. Sam H.
IlradiKT. who was speaker of the
home- during the first and special
session, anil Hon. H. Ii. Linncy,
chairman of several important com
mittees and a prominent member of
the Yavapai delegation in the house.
Some of the democrats claim that
they will nominate Linncy in the
democrat caucus as they claim to
tavc twenty two votes pledged to
them, while according to the count
of the other fellows Linncy can have
but thirteen votes in the caucus.
Then a wise democrat comes along
and says: "There need not be any
louse organization. It is not neccs-
sary. i lie coming session oi me
house and senate will be a special
session and the organization of the
regular session by all parliamentary
rules holds over until the new legis
lature is elected. Sam II. llradncr
was elected speaker of the first state
house of representatives and the first
state house of representatives will be
n special session when they come
together. Hon. Sam. 11. llradncr can
therefore if he wants to walk into
the house of representatives call it
together and preside. He will be in
the chair and a two thirds majority
is necessary to remove him. I can't
see where H. II. Linncy comes in on
this arrangement to save my life."
According to this arrangement the
same thing holds true for the Senate.
Senator Cunniff, who Is incidentally

sudden change in his favor at the
first examination held in this city

vague manner intimated that he had

acting on the cue given, Robert M

subpoena from the federal court at

claims of the Chinaman.

CONCENTRATING PLANT

Arrivals from Humboldt during
the past few days are pronounced iu
expressing themselves favorably over
the future of that smelting center.
A large amount of custom ores is
being received, and shows marked
increase each week.
The Consolidated is practically
passing through a regeneration In
its methods of handling outside
ores, and has completed one of the
biggest concentrating mills in the
state of a capacity that Insures any
tonnage to be readily and economi
cally handled. It will be started up
on the 10th or 15th of this month,
contingent on the arrival of lesser
utilities to make the plan perfect.

with the oilier concentrating ores

general opinion of mining men Is
that the Consolidated is entering on

much assistance In having a home
