Lawyers Subject to Indictment for
Negligent Management of Offices
By ROGER SHERMAN, VlcePres't 111. State Bar Ass'n.
After making a most careful and painstaking
study of the subject of business systems in law offices,
the committee on office management of the Illinois
State Bar association reports that in its opinion law
yers generally are stibject to indictment for criminally
negligent management of their offices. Such an indict
ment would charge them with failure to install modern
methods, systems and appliances failure to respond
to the demand for practical lawyers and practical
methods failure to transact their client*' business
along business lines and to dispatch it as a business
proposition and failure to appreciate that they have a business of their
own, distinct from that of their clients.
Today, more than ever before, the public demands ''service." It must
have results, not delays, not excuses, not explanations, hut results. The
man who carries the message to Gatcia gets his reward. The business
man or lawyer who cannot "deliver the goods," will not succeed in the
long run. Business systems and business devices in the law offices are
merely a means to an end they enable the lawyer to give the public what
it wantsquick results. While "honesty is the best policy," system is
a necessity to the progressive lawyer. If a lawyer has not developed a
system that will enable him to give quick and satisfactory service, his
clients will go to another lawyer who is better equipped.
Wild Animals Loose on Ship.
Wild animals across the sea some
times get loose on the vo.vage. An
English dealer who came over from
India to England with $10,000 worth
of animals aboard a sailing ship hud
such an experience.
An Indian badger was loose for two
weeks and a specimen of the sacred
monkey of northern India was out of
Its cage for nearly the whole voyage.
Where the badger concealed itself dur
ing the day nobody knew, but the meat
and boiled rice that were put out for
it at night always disappeared before
morning.
The monkey lived up in the rigging
comfortably enough, notwithstanding
five feet of chain hanging to its neck.
Food was put out for ir every night,
and by day It satisfied Its hunger by
ratching and eating the potatoes that
the sailors amused themselves by
throwing up to it.
It is a simple proposition and whether it is approached from the point
of view of the lawyer or his client, the conclusion is the samethe lawyer's
best interest. From the client's point of view it means quick and effective
results and profit or at least a saviDg to him hence satisfaction with the
lawyer, willingness to pay a fair fee, to recommend the lawyer to others,
and himself, to take future business to him. From the lawyer's point of
-view it means time saved, results accomplished, an intelligent charge to
the client, saving of wear and tear on the lawyer and ability to do more
business, to make more money and to get and keep more clients.
Today the lawyer who is experienced in business matters has the call.
Every lawyer should have a business training in and out of college. He
constantly advises on busine.-s policies and frequently becomes the execu-
tive head of great enterprises. It may seriously be argued that the law-
yers would better serve the public and themselves if they would abolish
the old traditions of the profession and become business men with knowl-
edge of the law.

THE BEMiDJl DAILY PIONEER
Almost Any Belie" Which One May
Fancy Can Be Found in Journey
Throuflh Italy.
If you ask an Italian about the su
perstitions of Italy he will sayif
he is well traveledthat Italy is rife
with superstition, and that one has
but to journey 15 miles in any direc
tion to find an entirely new supersti
tion, writes Temple Maiming iu the
Cleveland Plain Dealer.
A \illage at the toot of a mountain
may vary in its belief in certain su
perstitions from a town in the plains
or a village halfway up the mountain
side. Indeed, there is a tendency in
old countries for one little community
to vie with another community
in its belief in or scorn of signs, por
tents, omens and charms. Ir is a sort
of competition in superstition.

Tuesday is frowned on because it is
supposed to be de\oted to witches,
e-vil upells and all thcti attendant sor
rows.
Wednesday is a fast day, and, there

ered unlucky. It it happens to be
Friday the thirteenth, woe betide the
Neapolitan youth who c\er breathes
the name and date of this day to the
woman he loves.
Saturday is the day reserved for
widows, and so is out of the ques
tion from a maiden.
Thursday might do, but Sunday
the day of rest and of sacred offices
usually is the day of the week
chosen to celebrate weddings in Italy.
