Supposing our readers have a curiosity to
sec the late message of President Lincoln to
his Congress, ana presuming that Lincoln
wants our people to see how gracious he is,
and what a loving proclamation he has is
sued to us ail in Dixie, wc publish both in
our issue to-day. Whenever the British en
voys wished to tempt our lathers in the Rev
olution, by their proffers of amnesty, the
Continental Congress always assisted in giv
ing their proclamations a wide circulation;
for not only did Congress confide In the loy
alty of the people, but they considered those
1 apers as calculated to animate the popular
patriotism.
A hundred times stronger are our reasons
for. expecting this result now. Never did
British Commissiojicr or General, in all his
arrogance, put forth so impudent a message
as the Washington man has sent down to us.
He is goiug to forgive us something, itseems,
on certain terms.. To the most liberal, un
qualified and all embracing offer of forgive
ness to our fathers, Dr. iranklin replied:—
“We, who have committed no offence, need
no forgiveness.” Our answer would be the
same, even if Lincoln’s offer imitated the hu
manity ol Britain’s. Forgive us for what?
Forgive us because he has invaded our States
with armed multitudes, to overthrow our
laws, destroy our liberties and compass oar
destruction? Forgive us because he has
plundered our seas and ravaged our coasts ?
Foigive us for having burned our towns and
desolated our homes? Forgive us for the
many thousands of our brothers, and sons,
and dear friends whom he has slain upon our
own soil, and while repelling his invasion ?
Forgive us for the many dear mutilated ones
who will remain the legacy of the war when
the war shall be over?“Foiglve us for having
outraged even the sensibilities of Eurone by
his attempt to excite servile revolt ? Forgive
us for his Beast Butler, and for the thonsand
atrocities which he has let loose against us*
| iHe may forgive us for these, his crimes, but
so long as wc have hearts to feel aud hands
to strike we shall never forgive him. How
impudent it is to come, with onr brothers’
blood upon his accursed hands, and ask us
■to accept his forgiveness! But he goes fur
ther. He makes his forgiveness dependent
upon terms. Wc have only to swear obedi
ence to his will. Wc have to swear that the
•proclamation of emancipation which he Is
sued hist year, and which we received with
mocking, and which had since been a general
derision, shall be submitted to bv ns. Our
society is to be upturned. Instead of that
distinction between the races necessary for
the happiness of both, he asks us to swear
that we will have none at all, until his Con
gress of fanatics or his packed • bench of
judges shall say that his proclamation was
wind. But all this will not do. We must
abandon to that demon thirst for their blood,
which has been indecently exhibited from
the first, all the men who have rendered our
annals conspicuous, and under whose lead
we Lave won a fame, if.not a name, among
the nations. We must leave the President to
Abraham’s tender mercies. The army of the
Potomac must offer up their glorious .deader,
under whom both have become illustrious.
Beauregard must be bung. In short, every
officer down to colonel, and every civil func
tionary from Congressman to messenger, and
from Governor to constable, are to be retain
ed for Lincoln’s malignity. How he and
Seward and Sumner would gloat over the
hanging bodies of the '‘dead rebels I”
Is even Lincoln base enough to imagine
that a brave people such as the confederates
have proven themselves, would, under any
stress of fortune, prove traitors to the men
whom they have called to lead them, in camp
or council?
Tliis miserable attempt to divide and cor*
nipt ns wUi be contemptuous!? resented as

LONGING FOR HOME,
ET JEAN INOELOW,
A song of a boat:
There was once a host on a billow.
Lightly eh crocked to her port remote.
And the foam was white in her wake like anOw,
And her trail mast bowed when the breeze wonld
And bent like wand and willow. (blow,
I shaded mine eyes one dav when a boat
Went courtesying overa'billow,
1 marked her course till a daTiHmr mote
She faded out on the moonlit foam.
Audi staid behind in the dear loved home;
And my thoughts all day wereabont the boat,
And my dreams upon a pillow.
I pray yon bear my song of a boat,
„ For It is but abort:
My boat, yon shall find none fairer afloat,
_ In river or port.
Long I looked out for the lad she bore, '
. On the open desolate sea,
And I think he saQed to tbc heavenly shore.
For he came not back to me— ■ .
Alt me!
A song of a cost:
There was once n nest In a hollow,
Down in the mosses and knot-grass pressed.
Soft and warm, and fall to the brim:
Velchca leaned over in purple and dim
With bnttercup tmd& to follow.
I pray yon hear my song of a nest.
For it is not long;
Ton shall never light in a summer quest
The boshes among
Shall never light on a prouder sitter,
. A fairer nefitfhl, nor ever know
A softer sonnd than their tender twitter.
That wind-like did come and go.
I-hadanestfnl once of my own,
Ah happy, happy, IJ
Bight dearly I loved them; but when they were

They spread out thetrwingsandfly— ■
On, one after one, they flew away

To the better country, the upper day.
And—l wish I was going too.
I pray yon, what !a the nest to me—
My empty nest?
And what is toe chore, where I stood to see

IIALLECK’S KEPOKT.
TVbat Be Thinks of Oar Gcnejfels—
Takes to Himself all tlio credit of
Success.
General Rallcclt’s official history of the
military operations of the past year occupies
ten columns, and gives a complete survey of
the field. Beginning with the sopersedure
of McClellan by Burnside, the report epito
mizes the movements of the different depart
ments, from November of the last to Novem
ber of the present year. It does not contain
many facts that are new to the oonntry, but
it contains some versions of well known
events, which arc, to say the least, surpris
ing. It is a very belligerent document. Wo
reckon not less than eight Generals who arc
directly or Indirectly censured for miscon
duct-all of them commanders of depart
ments or corps. There is not a single disas
ter or failure for which the General-in-Chief
seems to consider himself responsible; not
one for which he is not able to account by
tho dereliction in duty of some subordinate
commander. On the other hand, it is made
to appear that the operations which were
successful were conducted strictly In 'ac
cordance with the orders or suggestions is
sued from Washington. He censures Gen.
Meade la the following mild terms, for per
mitting tue escape of Gen. Lee from Penn
sylvania:
Halting a day at Middletown, Gen. Meade
crossed the South Mountain, and on the 13th
(of July) found the enemy occupying a
strong position on the heights of Marsh Run
in front of Williamsport. Instead of attack
ing Lee in this position, with the swollen
waters of the Potomac in Ms rear, without
any means of crossing his artillery, and
when a defeat must have caused tho surren
der of his entire army, he was allowed time
to construct a pontoon bridge with Inmbcr
collected from canal boats and the ruins Of
wooden houses, and on the morula" of the
14th his army had crossed to the south side
of the river.
During Lee’s invasion of Pennsylvania,
orders were given for a movement upon
Eidimond, but the effort lulled for reasons
Urns stited by Gen. Halleck: *
When the rebel army was moving north
npon Maryland and Pennsylvania, Gen. Dlx
sent all of bis available force from Norfolk
and I ortress Monroe np the York Kivcr for
the purpose of cutting off Lee’s communion
lions tvilh Richmond and ofattackine that
place, -which was then defended by onlr a
handful of militia. The expedition, how
° a single object for
■which it had been fitted out, the failure rc
sultmg, it was alleged, from the inefficiency
of one of the Generals commanding Gen
Dix therefore ordered Us return, and sent the
troops of which it was composed to reinforce
the army of Gen. Meade, north of the Poto
mac.
Gen. Gilmore is praised in the report for
his operations against Charleston, and a
brief summary is given of the operations of
Gen. Banka in Louisiana and Texas. The
exploits of Granite army in the siege of
Vicksburg, and the battles which preceded
the capitulation, are warmly extolled.
One half of the report is devoted to a re
view of the Chattanooga campaign:
“While Gen. Grant was operating before
Vicksburg, information deemed reliable was
received Irom captured rebel correspondence
that large detachments were being drawn
from Bragg’s army to reinforce Johnson in
Mississippi. Reinforcements were sent to
Grant from other armies in the West but
Gen. Rosccranste was left intact, in order that
he might take advantage of Bragg’s diminish
ed numbers and drive him backinto Georgia,
and thus secure loyal East Tennessee from
the hands of the rebels—an object which the
Government has kept constantly In view
from the beginning ol the war. I therefore
urged npon General Kosecrans to take advan
tage of this opportunity to cany out bis lon
projccted movement, informing him that
Gen. Burnside would. co-onerate with his
force, moving from Kentucky to East Ten
nessee. For various reasons he preferred to
postpone his movement until the termination
ofthc siege of Yicksbmg.”
In order to avoid any. misunderstanding of
the orders given to Gen. Boseerans on this
subject, Gen. Halleck gives the full corres
pondence which passed between them In
June last. On the 11th of that month Gen.
Boseerans wrote as follows:

• MraPßEEseoao, Juno 31,1883. , f
General : In yonr favor of the ]2th Instant yon
say yon cannot see how the marim of not flghtin"
two great battles at the same time appllesto the
cases of this army and Grant’s, Looking at the
matter practically, we and our opoalng forces are
so widely separated that for Bragg to materially
aid Johnston, he mnst abandon onr front substan
tially, and then we can move to onr ultimate work
with more rapidity and less waste of material on
natural obstacles. If Grant is defeated both forces
will come here, and then we ought to. be near onr
base. The same maxim that forbids, as you take
it, a single army fighting two great battles at the
same time—by the way, a very awkward thing to
do—would forbid this nation's engaging all Its
forces In the great West at the same time, so as to
leave It without a single reserve to stem the cur
rent of possible disaster. This is. I think sustain
tainedbv high military and political considera
tions. We ought to fight here if we have a strong
prospect of winning a declsve battle:ovcr the op

LETTER FROM ROBERT DALE
OWEN.
Kditore New York Tribune: ,
. Now that the President has resorted, as a
measure of reconstruction, to the pardonln*
power on conditions, and has Issued to the
inhabitants of the insurgent States a Procla
mation of Amnesty, a lew historical fVcts in
connection with the employment of thht
power in times past will probably Interest
your readers.
The heeds of nations have been wont, in
contingencies similar to-that before us to
exercise the power of pardon, with the appro
bation of mankind. So Charles 11, about to
return to England after the death of Crom
well, in 1660. So George 11, at. the close of
the Jacobite rebellion of 1715.
In both these noted examples, partlon was
granted on conditions to be formally accept
ed; and it was granted, of course, without
reference to sentences of condemnation ob
tained against individuals for the offense par
doned. .. : *
In the case of Charles n, it was issued, .un
der date April 16,1CC0, from - Bcrda, and was
entitled: ‘‘An act of free, and general par
don, indemnity and oblivion, 7 ’ of which the
essential portion is in these words; ‘
We do grant a free and general pardon, which
we are ready, upon demand, to pass under our
great seal ofEugland, to all our subjects, of what
degree or quality soever, who within forty dars
alter the publishing thereof, shall lay hold upon
Hub our grace and favor, and shall by any public

about eighty exceptions, recited by name,
some of whom were condemned to death, but
the greater part were pardoned on condition
of banishment.
Cap. 40,20 Geo, 11. A. D. 1747, is entitled:

(hem going into the enemies’ country.—
[“Statutes at Large,” VoL VL p. 385; see
also “ Mahon’s History of England. VoL IH
p. 470.] o ,
In our own history but a single insurrection
or rebellion deserving the name has occurred,
previously to that which is now in progress
namely, the insurrection of 1704, in certain
western counties comprising the Fourth Sur
vey of Pennsylvania, caused by an attempt
to obstruct the execution of the acts for rais
ing a revenue on distilled spirits and stills.
Although this outbreak, lasting about four
months, created m the minds of the timid
fears as to the stability of the Government.
■jet.it is doubtfn if the rebels had, at any
tune, at their dislposal. over 15,000 men; and
it docs not appear that the Union was ever
seriously threatened.
On the 10th of July, 1795, the President,
George Washington, issued a Proclamation,
granting pardon to the Western Insur
gents;” fn which, after reciting that certain
Commissioners appointed by him “tocon
fer with the citizens in the Western conntles
of I exmsylvania ” had promised In his name
that if assurances of submission to the laws
should be subscribed by the citizens concern
ed in the insurrection, a general pardon
should be granted for aU offences against the
United States committed by these persons
Previous to the 22d of August, 1704, he pro
“ Therefore ho it known, that I, George Wash
ington, President of the United States, have grant
ed, and by these presents do grant a mil, frro and
entire pardon to all persons (exceptingas Ishere
inallcr excepted) of all treasons, misprisions of i
treason, and other indictable offences against the
United States, committed within the Fourth Sor- 1
vey of Pennsylvania before the said 22d day of
August last past, excepting and excluding there
from, nevertheless, every person who refused or
neglected to give and subscribe the saldassnrances
in the manner aforesaid, (or, bavin* aubMcrlheri
hath violated the same) ami nowatiSdeth^lndlctS
or convicted of any treason, misprision of treason
or other offence against the United States, hereby
remitting all penalties Incurred, or ennpoied to be
Incurred, for or on account of the promises ”
This insurrection broke out in the summer
ofl ™*- J n of that year, 500 armed idea
resisted the oflicers of the law and burned the
Inspector’s house. By the Ist of August the
number of insurgents under arms had swol
len to from 5,000 to 7,000 men, who assem
bled, on that day, at Bruddock’s Field, on the
Monongahela. At a later period they are said
to have had the control of 16,000 men.
The President issued a Proclamation warn
ing the insurgents of the pains and penalties
of treason, and commanding them to dis
perse. Afterward he appointed three Com
missioners to confer with the leadin'* rebels
who at first evaded all satisfactory terms, but
finally, after the President had called oaf 15 -
COO militia to supprees the Insurrection, gave
way and agreed to the signature bv the in
habitants of the insurgent district o*f articles
of submission to the laws of the. United
States, the Commissioners covenanting that
on such conditions they should be pardoned
This restored tranquility; but 2,500 troops
remained, throughout the winter of 1794-5
encamped In the insurrectionary district!
(“Histoir of the United States,” by George
Tucker, VoL L, pp. 531 to 558. Also, “His
tory of the United States of America.” bv
Richard Hildreth, Vol. IV., pp. 403 to sio) J
The final pardon by President Washington
it will be observed, is granted conditionally'
the condition being the signing of certain ar
ticles of submission. All indicted or con
victed rebels who refused or neglected to
subscribe, or haring subscribed and after ward
violated tbs conditions, are excepted*
Notwithstanding such precedents, there
will he found many objections to this pro-,
posed exercise of clemency, and to the pru
dent and necessary conditions attending it
as an arbitrary exercise of the one-man pow
er. These objections will come from men
who are in the habit of lauding, as the only
bulwark of liberty, the Constitution of the
United Stales, as often as it suits their pur
pose of the hour, and condemning the very
carrying oat of its clearest provisions, when
ever these run counter to partisan aims and
sordid intrigues.
These men seem to take pleasure in for
getting what many of ua thouglitlcjsly fail to
bear in mind—that when a. Government
fonuded on the popular will has shown itself
to be just, forbearing, free from tyranny or
oppression, resorting to force only at the
last moment, and no to the time it was as
sailed productive to millions of freemen of a
security and a prosperity scarcely matched
in aU history, treason against it is one of the
ulackest of human crimes. Can any man es
timate. can the imagination adequately pic
ture, the misery in countless shapes that has
already been the result of that ‘stupendous
crime? Far more than this, can any man
even imagine what might have been the dire
ful consequences for generations to come,
had treason succeeded In its parricidal
tempt—had Gettysburg and half a dozen
more such fields each witnessed the over
whelming defeat of the Union arms? Who
can tell, in such a contingency, into how
many petty sovereignties this American
L moa would have dwarfed down ? what end
less Jealousies, what countless wax*, mi*ht
have sprung up between these rival frag
ments—fragments never more, it may be, In
Our day, or In the days perhaps of onr child
ren s children, again to be united into one
great nation commanding and deserving the
respect of mankind?
Docs such a crime as that nced'no pardon 9
Its authors once subdued, do they become
innocent in virtue of that subjugation? Is
no purgation required? The prodigal son
was received again to his paternal home. But
not until he had abjured his riotous life: not
until his humility and repentance had found
words: “Father, Thave sinned against Hea
ven, and before thee,' and am no more worthy
to be called thy son: moke me as one of thy
hired servants.” Uurepented crime cannot,
consistently with public order, be passed by
unnoticed and unpunished. Why, else, onr
criminal courts and our penitentiaries ?
. It is a solemn thing to admit once more
within the peaceful precincts of the Union,
insurgents who for years have been aiming
deadly blows at its existence. We forgive
much, if we receive again to full fellowship
all who exhibit a contrition, and if we respect
the lives and the personal liberty even of the
uncoctrite and contumacious.' *Xf, In the fu
ture, the peaceful conduct of these latter
should commend their case to favor, it Trill
he lime enough to remit any portion of their
political disabilities. To go farther at pre
sent, would. be to proclaim Immunity to
mime and to hand dawn to posterity the
teaching that, in these United States, treason
may stalk abroad with impunity, and assault,
without fear of punishment, the life of the
nation itself!

A Vessel Carried Over Niagara Falls.
An obliging correspondent at Cnlppcwa
sends ns nn account of a melancholy occur
rence which took place on the Niagara River
on Monday last, which resulted In tho death
of one man by being carried over the falls, and
caused imminent peril to fire others, as well
as the loss of a small vessel. About U o’clock
in the morning, the steam tug A. D. Griffin,
of Buffalo, reached Chippewa, having in tow
two scows, the Ahby and tho A. Murray, of
Port Robinson.; The captain of the steamer,
not knowing the depth o*f water, kept too for
into the river, with not sufficient steam to
keep headway on the scows. One of the lat
ter. the A. Murray, striking against thespiles
at the entrance of the'haroor, swung around
with the current almost Into tho jaws of the
mighty cataract The Captain and lour men
who were on board, seeing tho helpless posi
tion into which the vessel bad got, and the
great peril with which they were threatened
—being within less than five minutes’ dis
tance of the great fall—leaped from the ves
sel, and boldly, struck for shore. Four of
them, the Captain included, succeeded by
great exertions in maintaining themselves
above the surface; but, sad to relate, the fifth
sank amid the leaping and boiling waters, and
was carried over the cataract. In the mean
time a boat, manned by two-brave men, shot
out from the mouth of Welland River to the
assistance of the helpless beings in the scow.
The oarsmen, Messrs. F. Lausan, Jr., and
George Mone, pulled bravely out, rescued
the men from their perilous position, and
succeeded in reaching the shore jnst above
the first rapid. One minute more, and; they
would have been carried over the Falls to the
freat gulf below. Too much praise cannot
c given to the men by. whose presence of
mind and courage four humau beings were
thus rescued from certain destruction. The
scow glided along the stream tm it reached a
rock almost on tbe brink of the cataract,
where its course was stopped, and where it
will probably remain till broken up by tbe
ice in tho spring. —Toronto Leader, Dec, IC.

CONSTITUTION WATER
Tbe Great Remedy for tbe
CONSTITUTION!
AND THE ONLY KNOWN REMEDY FOR
Diabetes, and Diseases of
the Kidneys and Bladder.
Constitution Water
Bubeeo pronounced by the Medical Faculty, and
tbo Public, to bo tbe most wonderful remedy tor tho
gennauent cure of all diseases of the Stomach, Liver.
Jdoeys, Bladder and Womb, that has ever been
offered.
It Is not » Medical water. It Is from experience
that Constitution Water has emanated, and wo now
say let no man doubt when a single bottle has been
known to core diseases which the best medical talent
In tbis country Las failed to relieve.
A. remedy possessing the virtues of Constitution
water cannot be classed under “ quack” preparations
down popular remedies, while the better skilled make
use of every means to accomplish a cure: and tho
success ox tbe physician Increases as bis knowledge of
different remedies enables him to produce a cure,
while others fall In tbo attempt. Scleuco is satisfied
with the truth.
Give Constitution Water a fair trial—we mean yon
who are under some specialist's care from year to
year, and we particularly oilnde to ladles who are
constantly resorting to local treatmaot and all sorts
of local applications for diseases, with as much chance
oi success as there wonld be from local applications
to the throat for diseases of the brain.
We have always been careful to nse language in onr
clrcnlarthat could not shock the most delicate organ!-
ration, out we receive so many communications from
persons for which Conatllntlon Water is adapted, and
of whose disease no mention baa been made, that we
iivO Come to the conclusion that If the remedv is ca
pable of producing a core, no matter what tbe disease
may he. It should be made known. Tho medicine is
pat np for the pnbllc, and there should be no excep
tions.
We would say, Constitution Wator is not like a gild
ed pill, made to salt the eye and taste; It Is a medi
cine in every sense of the term, placed in the hands of
the people for their relief, and U taken according to
the directions, U will In every cose produce a radical
core. We would say that the directions in regard to
diet, etc., relate only to the disease under which they
occur.
DIABETES
Is a disease of the Stomach and Liver, actlnelthrongh
the Kidneys, and is, without doubt, the moet obstinate
disease, except Consumption, that affects the human
constitution. We have no space for discussing causes,
hut will state that tbe effect of the disease Is the coo*
version of the starchy principle (or vegetable portion
of the food) Into sngar, which stimulates tho kidneys
to on excessive secretion of water. Many persons
suffer from this disease who are ignorant of It: that
is, they pass large quantities daring the day.’and arc
obliged to get cp from one to fifteen or twenty times
oaring tbe night. No notice Is taken of it until their
attention is called to the large discharge of water, and
often when It is co far advanced as to be beyond the
control of ordinary remedies. Another symntou li
the great thirst which, when the disease U tally estab
lished, is intolerable—tne patient drinks constantly,
without being satisfied; aTco dryness of thomoai.li.
cracking of the llns, a sweet breath. In the more ad
ranccd cases, and finally loss of appetite, emaciation,
and the patient gradually winks from exhaustion.
CONSTITUTION WATER
Is without doubt tho only known remedy fo—or xbbtxs
ana we have os much couSdcnce that lv la a specific as
wc have that o.uom will produce sleep, and trutulolly
sayihatttuaa cured every coze In wnlch Ulias been
used.
Stone in jiie Bladder, Calculus,
Gravel. Brick Dost Deposit,
and Mucous or Milky
Discharges after
Drinating.
Disease occurring from one and the same cause will
be eatb'cly cured by the Constitution Water, If taken
for any length of time. *
In Dysmenorrhea, or Painful Menstruation,
ani Jlenorrhdgln, or Profuse Flowing.
Bothdiseases arising from a faulty secretion of the
menstrual fluid—ln the one case being too little, and
accompanied by a severe pain, and the other a too oro-
JUse secretion, which will be speedily cured by the
Constitution Water. _ J
That disease known av PALLING OF THE WOMB
which Is the result of a relaxation of the ligaments of
that organ, end is known by a sense of heaviness and
dragging pains in the back and sides, and at times ac
companied by sharp lancinating or 6hooUn» nalns
through the parts, will la all cases, be remov 'd by the
medicine.
There Is another class of symptoms arlslnu from
IRRITATION OF THE WOMB. which
Nervousness, which word covers up much ignorance
and In mne out often, the doctor does not really
know whether the symptoms are the disease, or the
disease the symptoms, We can only enumerate them
here.. 1 speak more particularly of Coin Feet.Palol ta
tlon of the Hear., Impaired Memory, Wakefulness.
Hashes of Heat,Lunguor, Lassitude, and Dimness or
Vision.
SUPPRESSED MEMSTETTATIOU,
Which in the unmarried female is a constant recur
ring disease, and through neglect the seeds of moro
grave and dangerous maladies nro tho result; and as
month after month passes without an effort being
made to assist nature, the suppression becomes chron
ic, the patient gradually loses her appetite, the bowels
are constipated, night sweats come on, and Cokboxp
tiox finally ends her career.
Irritation of the Sort of tho Bladder, Inflam
mation of the Kidneys, Catarrh of
the Bladder, Stnngnary and
Burning, or Painful
Urinating.
For these diseases It is truly remedv.
and too much cannot be said In Its praise. A slnclo
dose has been known to relieve the moat urgent symp-
Arc you troubled with that distressing pain In tho
small of the back and through the hips? 'A teasaoon
fu! a day of Constitution Water will relievo you llko
magic.
PHTSICUJVS
Have long since given up the use ofbncbn, cuhebs,
and juniper lu the treatment of these diseases and
only use them for the want of a better remedy.
