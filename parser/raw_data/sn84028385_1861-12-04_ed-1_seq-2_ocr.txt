PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow Citizens of the &na!s and House
rtf Representatives ;
In tb.c tulclst of unprecedented political
troubles tro bare cause of great gratitude
lo Cod for unasual good Leakh aud most
abundant harvests. You will not lc sur
prised to learn that in the peculiar exigen
cies of the times our intercourse with for
eign cations Las been attended with pro
found solicitude, chiefly turning upon cur
m domestic affairs.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. THE REBELLION AND FOREIGN INTERFERENCE
A disloyal portion of the American peo
ple Have, during the Vls year, been en
gaged in hb attempt t'j divide and destroy
the Ltnon. A ration which endures fac
tions domestic divisions Is exposed to dis
fespect abroad, and one party, or both, is
feUre, Bonrer or later, to invoke foreign in
tervention. Nations thus temfted to inter
fere are not always able to resist the coun
sels of eeeming expediency and ungenerous
ambition, although measures aJoptcd un
der such influences ecldoni fail to be unfor
tunato and injurious to those adoption
them.
Tlw disloyal citizens cf the United
States who have offered the ruin of our
country In reward for the aid and comfort,
which theyr Lave invoked abroad, have re
ceived less patronage and cnconractucnt
than they probably expected. . If it were
just to suppose, as the insurgents have
Bccmea w assume, that foreign nations ,n
this case, disregarding all moral, socj and
treaty obligations, wou'd act sob',y anj ge
ssnij ior the most ppeedy restoration of
commerce, including spirally, the acquisi
tion of cotton, thost nations appear as yet
Hot to have ece their way to their object
aore directly or clearly through the des
truction than through ,the preservation cf
the Union. If we could dare to believe
that foreign nations ore cctuatcd by no
higher principle than this. I am quite 6nre
a second argument could be made to 6how
that they could reach their aim more read
ily and easily by aiding to crush this re
bellion than by giving enccuragement to
the principle lever relied on by itfj 1 he
exciting of foreign nations to .hostility a
jjainst us, as already intimated, is the em
barrassment of commerce. These nation;,
however, not improbably saw from the first
that it was the Union which made as well
or foreign as our domtstic commerce.
ITrey can scarcely fail to perceive that the
effort for disunion, produces the existing
difficulty, and that one strong nation p ;wm
ises more durable peace, and a more, exten
sive, valuable and reliable commerce than
the same nation broken into hostile frag
ments. It is not my purpose to review
our discussions with foreign States, because
whatever might be their wishes, or disposi
tions, the integrity of our countrv and the
stability of our Government mainly depends
not upon them, "but upon the loyalty, patri
otism, virtue and intelligence of the Amer
ican people. The correspondence itself,
"with the 3ual reservation, is herewith
submitted. I venture to hope that it will
appear that we have practiced prudence
and liberality towards foreign powers avert
ing causes of irritation, an J with firmness
maintaining our own rights and bonor.
Since, however, it is apparent that here, as
in every other State, foreign dangers nec
essarily attend domestic ' difficulties, I rec
ommend that adequate and ample measures
be adopted for maintaining the public de
fences on cvery de; while under this gen
eral recommendation provision for defend
ing our coast line readily occurs to the
mind.
OUR DEFENCES.
I also, in the tama conueclioa, act the
attention of Congress to our great lakes
ad rivers. . It is believed that some for
tifications and depots of arms and muta
tions, with harbor and navica ion improve
ments, at well selected points upon these,
would be of great importanceto the nation
al defensb and preservation. I ask atten
tion to the views of the Sccretaryf Yar,
expressed in bis report upon the 6acic gen
eral subject I deem it of importance that
the loyal regions of Hast Tc'nuessee and
v estern Aortn Carolina should be connect
ed with Kentucky and other faithful parts
01 tne union Dy railroad. 1 tlicrctorc rcc-'each
as a military measure, that Con-!
gross provide for the construction ofsuch
road as speedily as possible. Kentuckv
will no doubt co-operate, and through her
- - -
Legislature make the most judicious selec
tion of the line. The northern terminus
most connect with some existing railroad,
and wbetber.thc route shall be from Lex
ington or Xicholaeville to Cumberland Gap,
or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in
tbe direction of KnoxvilUe, or -some still
different line, can easily be determined.
Kentucky and the General Government co
operating, the woik can be completed in a
Tery ebort time, and when dous, it will.be
not Only ef vast present usefulness, but
also an available permanent improvement,
worth its cost in all the future,
FOREIGN TREATIES.
Some treaties designed chiefly for the in-
tercsts of commerce, and having no grave
political importance, have been negotiated,
and will be submitted to the benate for
their consideration. Although we have
failed to induce soma of the commercial
rowers to adopt a desirable melioration for
the rigor cf maritime war, we have far
removed all the obstacles from the way of
their buraane reform, f xcept such as are
merely of temporary and accidental occur
rence. I invite your attention to the cor
respondence between her Britauic Majesty's
Minister, accredited lo this Government.
and die Secretary of State, relative to the

ot the persons aud at the dates re

I respectfully refer to the report of the
and for recommendation's having iu view
an increase of its u-icncv. and the well
being of the various branches of the ser-
vice entrusted to his care. It is gratify
ing to know that the patriotism of the peo
ple is equal'to the occasion, and tbat the
number of troops tendered greatly exceed
the force which Congress authorized me to
call into the field. 1 refer with pleasure
to those portions of bis report which make
allusion to the creditable degree of disci
pline already attained by our troops, and
to the txcelleut sanitary condition of the
entire army.
The recommendation by the Secretary
for an organization of the militia upon a
Piriform basis, is a subject of vital impor
tsncc to the future safety of the country,
and is commended to the serieu attention
of Congress.
A large addition to the regular army, in
connection with the defection that has so
onsiderably diminished the number cf its
oEccrs, gives peculiar importance to bis
recommfndation for incressing the corps of
cadets to tLc greatest capacity of the Mil
itary Academy.
l'y mere emission, 1 presume. Congress
has tailed to provide Chaplains for the Hos
pitals occupied by volunteers. '1 his sub
ject was brought to my notice, and I was
induced to draw up the form cf a letter,
one copy of
which properly addressed to
gentlemen I understand entered npon the
dutic3 designated at the times resectively
stated in the schedule, and have labored
faithfully therein ever sicca I therefore
recommend that they be compensated at
the same rate as Chaplains iu the army.;
I further suggest that general previsions
be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals
" cll as with regiments.

NORTHERN CLAIMS IN SOUTHERN STATES.
One of the unfavorable consequences of
tne present insurrection is the entire sup
pression in many 1 laces of all ordinary
means of administering civil justice by the
officers, and iu the forms of existing law.
This is the case in whole or in part in all
the insurgent States, and as our armies
advance upon and take possession of parts
of those States, tbe practical evil becomes
more apparent. There arc no courts or
officers to whom the citizens of other States
may apply for the enforcement of their
lawful claims against citizens of the insur
gent States, and there is a vast amouut of
debt constituting such claims. Some have
estimated it as high as 200,000,000 dol
lars, due ia large part from insurgents in
opu rebellion to loyal citizens, who are
even now making great sacrifices in the
discharge of their patriotic duty to support
the Government Undjr these circum
stances I Lave been urgently solicited to
establish, by miliary power, courts to ad
minister summary justice in such cases.
I have thus far declined to do it, not be
cause I had auy doubt that the end propo
sed, the collection of debt, was just and
right in itself, but because i have been un
willing to go beyond the pressure of ne
cessity in the unusual exercise of power.
But the powers of Congress, I suppose, are
equal to the anamolous occasion; and there
fore, I rclcr the whole matter to Congress,
with the hope tbat a plan may be devised
for the admiiistration of justice iu all such
parts of the insurgent States and Territo
ries as may be under control of this Gov
ernment, whether by a voluntary return to
allegianca and order, or by the power of
our anus. This, however, is not to be a
re maueiit institution, but a temporary
substitute, and to cease as soon as the or-
dic3,'J c:urts ciu lc "-estsHiJicd in peace.
CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.
It is important that some more ccnvoi
energy icnt means should be provided, if possible,
adjustment of claims against the
Government, especially in view of their in-
citizens, as it is to administer the
:same between private individuals. The
investigation aud adjudication of all the
diims in their nature belong to tbe Jndi
whieh chl department; Wsides it is apparent that
the atlention-of Congress will be more than
usually engaged for some time to come with
creased number by reason of the war. It

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Thc present insurrection shows. I think,
that the extension of

the Potomac river at the time of cstablish-
ing the capital here, was eminently wise,
and consequently, that the rcl
of that portion of it which lies

and the restoring of the original bounda

THE INTERIOR.
TLc report of the Secretary of the Inte
rior, with the accompanying documents, ex
hibit the condition of the several branches
of the public lusiucss reituiuing to that
Department The depressing infi'j'.nccs of
the iusurrectiou have been especially felt
in the operations of the Baton t and Gene
ral Land Office 'i he cash receipts from
the sales of public lauds during the past
year, have exceeded the expenses of cur
land system only about two thousand dol
lar, 'llic sales have lecn entirely suspen
ded in the Southern States, while the in
terruptions to the business of the country,
and the diversion of large numhers of men
from labor to military service, have ob
structed settlements iu the new Statc3 and
Territories of ihe Xorthwest
'J he receipts of the Batcut Ofiiee have
declined in nine mouths, about 100,000
dollars, rcnderii g a large reduction cf the
force employed necessary to nuke it self-tu-;taininij.
The demand upon the Bension
Office will be largely increased by the iu
suirection. - Numerous - applications for
pensions, based up n the casualties cf the
existiug war, havo already been made.
There is reason to believe tbat manv who
are now upon the Tension Boll and in re
ceipt of the bounty of the Government, arc
iu tho rauks of the iusurgcut army or giv
ing them aid and comfort. The Secretary
of tbe Interior has directed tho suspension
of the payment of the pensions of such per
sons, upon proof of their disloyalty. 1 re
commend that Congress authorize that offi
cer to cause the names of such persons to
be stricken from tbe pension rolls.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The relations of the Government with
tho Indian tribes have been lattly disturb
ed by the insurrection, especially iu the
northern superintency, and in that of Xew
-Mexico. Ihe Indian country south of
Kansas is in possession of insurgents from
Texas and Arkansas. The agents of the
United States, appointed siuce the 4 th of
March for this sujierintendeccy. have been
unable to-rcach their posts, while the most
of those who were in office before that time,
have espoused the insurrectionary cause,
and assumed to exercise the powers cf a
gents by virtue of commissions from the in
suirectiouists. It has been Btated in the
public press that a portion of these Indians
have been organized as a military force,
and arc attached to the army of the insur
gents, although the Government has no of
ficial information upon the subject. Let
ters have been written to the Commission
er of Indian Affairs by several prominent
chiefs, giving assurance cf their loyalty to
the United States, aud expressing the wish
for the presence of federal troops to pro
tect them. It is believed that ou the re
possession of the couutry by the Federal
forces, the Indians will readily cease all
hostile demonstrations and resume their
former relations to the Government
AGRICULTURE.
Agriculture, confessedly tho largest in
terest of the nation, has not a department
or a bureau, but a clerkship only assigned
to it in the Gouernnicnt While it is for-'
tunate that this great interest is so inde
pendent in its nature as net to have de
manded and extorted more from the Gov
ernment I respectfully ask Congress to
consider whether something more cannot
be given voluntarily with general advan
tage. Annual reports exhibiting the con
dition cf our agriculture, commerce aud
manufactures, would present a fund of in
formation of great practical value to tbe
country. While I make no suggestions as
to details, I venture the opiniou that an
agricultural and statistical bureau might
profitably be organized. ;
THE SLAVE TRADE.
The excution of the law3 for the sup
pression of the African slave trade has been
confined to the Department of the Interior.
It is a subject of congratulation that the
efforts which have been made for the sup
pression of this inhuman traffic have recent
ly been attended with unusual euccc3s.
r'ive vessels king fitted out for the slave
trade, have been seized and condemned ;
two masters engaged in the trade, and one
person equipping the vessel as a slaver has
been convicted and subjected to the penal
ty of fine and imprisonment, and one cap
tain taking up a cargo of Africans on board
bis vessel has been convicted of the highest
grade ef offence under our laws, tbc'puu
iiiTucut of which is death.
THE TERRITORIES.
The Territories of Colorado, Dakotah
and Nevada, created by the last Congress,
have been organized, and civil administra
tion has been inaugurated therein, under
auspices especially gratifying, when it is
considered that the leaven of treason was

tries when the Federal officers arrived
there. The abundant natural resources of
these Territories, with the security and
protection afforded by organized Govern
ment, will doubtless invite to them a large
immigration when peace shall restore the
business of the country to its accustomed
channels. I submit the resolutions of tbe
legislature of Colorado, which evince the

States has been upheld in all the territo- j

ever, in the purchase of Louisiana yielded
his scruples on the plea of great expediency.
It has been said that the only legitimate
object of acquiring territory is tournish
homes for white men, This measure effects
that object, for the emigration of colored
men leaves additional room for white men
remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson,
however, placed the importance of procur
ing Louisiana more on political and com
mercial grounds than en providing room
for population. On this whole proposition,

the acquisition of territory, does not the ex

THE SUPPRESSION OF THE REBELLION.
In considering the policy to be adopted
for suppressing the insurrection, I have
been anxious and careful that the inevita
ble conflict for this purpose shall not de
generate into a violent and remorseless rev
olutionary EtniMla. I have, therefore, in
every case, thought it proper to keep the
integrity of the Union prominent as the
primary object of the contest on our part,
leaving all questions which are not of vital
military importance to the more deliberate
action of the legislature.
In tbe exercise of mv best discretion. I
have adhered to the blockade of the ports
lilt ., . . - r
ueiu iy me insurgents, instead of putting
in force by proclamation, the law of Con
gress enacted at tha late session, for clos
ing those ports, also obevine the dictates
of prudence as well as the obligations of
taw. ,
Instead of transcending, I have adhered
to tbe act of Congress to con5scate proper
ty usot for insurrectionary purposes. If
a new law upon the same subject should
be proposed, its propriety will be duly con
sidered. The L'uiou must be preserved,
and hence all dispensable means must be
tmtlojcd.
We should not be ia haste to determine
what radical and extreme measures which
may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal,
are indispensable.
The Inaugural address at the beginning
of the administration, and the Message to
Congress at the late special session, were
both mainly devoted to the domestic contro
versy, out of which the insurrection and
onsequent war have sprung. Nothing
now occurs to add or subtract to or from
the principles or general purposes stated
and expressed in thosa documents.
A REVIEW.
The last ray of hope for preserving the
Union peaceably expired at the assault up
on Fort Sumter, and a general review of
what has occurred since may not l un
profitable. What was painfully uncertain
th-?n, is much better defiued and more dis
tinct now, and the progress of events is
plainly in the right direction. The insur
gents confidently claimed a strong support
from north of Mason & Dixon's line, and
the friends of the Union were not free from
apprehension on this point This, howev
er, was soon settled definitely and on the
right 6idc. South of the Line noble little
Delaware led eff right from tbe first
Maryland was made to setm against the
Union. Our soldiers were assaulted,
bridges were burned and Railroads torn up
within her limits, and we were many days
at one time without the ability to bring a
single Iiegimcnt over the soil to the Capi
tal. Now her bridges and llailroads are
repaired and opened to the Government
She already gives seven Regiments to the
cause of the Union, and none to the ene
my, and her people at a regular election
have sustained the Union by a large major
ity, and a larger aggregate vote than they
ever .before gave to any candidate or any
question. Kentucky too, for sometime in
doubt, is now decidedly, and I thiuk un
changeably ranged on the side of the Union.
Missouri is comparatively quiet, and I be
lieve cannot again be overrun by the insur
gents. These three States, Maryland,
Kentucky and Missouri, neither of which
would promise a single soldier at first.havo
now an aggregate of not less than 40,000
ia the field for the Union, while of their
citizens not more than a third in number
are among the insurgents, and they of
doubtful whereabouts and cxisteuce.
After a somewhat bloody struggle of
months winter closes on the Union people
of Western Virginia, leaving them masters
of their own country. An insurgent force
of about 1-jOO, for months dominating the
uayow pcnicsular region constituting the
counties of Acconiac and Northampton and
known as the Eastern Shorn of Virginia.

GEN. MCCLELLAN.
itu the retirement of (Jen. Scott came
the Executive duty of appointing in his
place a Ueneral-m-utiiet ot the army. It
U a f.ituinto ciroumstaace that neither in
without which be cannot with so full efii-
cieney serve the couutry. It ha been said
that one bad General is bctt-r than two :
good ones, and the saying is true, if takn !
to mean no more than that an army is bet-
ter directed by a single mind though in-!
ferior. than by two sVerior ones at? vari-
:ance and cross purposes, and the same is '
true in all joint operations wherein tha !
engaged can have none but a common end ;
in view, and can differ only as to th choice '
of means. In a storm at sea no one on !
board can wish the ship to sink, and yet
council nor country was there, so far as I
know, any difference of opinion as to the1
proper person to be selected. The retiring1
chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in ;
favor of Gen. SIcCIellan for the position,
and in this the nation seemed to trive an

first principles cf a popular Government'
and the rights of the to;i!o. Conclusive
evidence of this is fouud in the most grave !
and maturely considered public documents j
as well as in the general tone of the insur-'
gents. In these documents we find the a-1
bridgraent of the existing right of suffrage !
and the denial to the people of all right to
participate in the selection of public offi
cers, except the legislative body, advoca
ted with labored arguments t9 prove that
large control of the government in the peo
ple is the source of all political evil. Mon
archy itself is sometimes hiutcd at as a
possible refuge from the error of the peo
ple. Iu my present position I could scarce
ly be justified, were I to omit raising a
warning voice against this approach of rc
turningdespotisra. .
CAPITAL AND LABOR.
It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a
general argument should be made iu favor
of popular institutions, but there i3 oue
point with its connections, not so hackney
ed as most others, to which I a:k a brief
attention. It is the effort to place capital
on an equal footing with, if not above, la
bor, in the structure of government. It is
assumed tbat labor is available only in con
nection with capital; that nobody labors
unless somebody, owning capital, somehow
by the use of it induces thera to labor.
This assumed it is next considered whether
it ia best that capital shall hire laborers,
and thus induce them to work by their own
consent or levy them and drive thera to it
without their consent Having proceeded
so far it is naturally concluded that all la
borers are cither hired labors or what we
call slaves, and further, it is assumed that
whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in
that condition for life.
Now there is no such relation betweeh
capital and labor as assumed, nor is there
aDy such thing as a freeman being fixed
for life in the condition of a hired laborer.
Both of these assumptions are false, and
all inferences from thera are groundless.
Labor is prior to and independent of capi
tal. Capital is only the fruit of labor,
and could never have existed if labor had
not first existed. Labor i3 the superior of
capital, and deserves much the higher con
sideration. Capital has its rights which
are a3 worthy of protection a3 any other
rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and
probably always will be a relation between
labor and capital producing mutual bene
fits. The error is ia assuming that the
whole labor of community exists within
tbat relation. A few men own capital, and
that few avoid labor, and with their capi
tal hire or buy a few to labor for them.
A large majority belonging to neither class
neither work for others, uor have others
working for them. In most of the South
ern States a majorty of the vholc people
of all colors are neither slaves nor masters,
while in the Northern States a large ma
jority arc neither hirers nor hired men.
Men with their famines, wives, sons and
daughters, work for themselves on their
farms, in their houses, and in their shops
taking the whole product to themselves,
and asking no favors of capital on the one
hand, nor of hired laborers or slaves on the
other. It is not forgotten that a consider
able number of pcrssus miDglc their own
labor with capital ; that is, they labor with
their own hands and also buy or hire eth
ers to labor for them ; but this is only a
mixed and not a distinct class. No prin
ciple stated is disturbed by the existence of
this mixed class. Again, as has already
S?en said, there is not of necessity any such
thing as the free hired laborer being fixed
for that condition for life. Many independ
ent men everywhere in these States a few
years back in their lives were hired labor
ers. 1 he prudent, penniless begsar in the
world labors for wastes a while and saves a !
