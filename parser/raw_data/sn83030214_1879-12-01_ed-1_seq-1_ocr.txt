W.c-iiiMiTi x, Nov. ;io.-Opinions, among Dcnvn
rratic Repieaciitatives as to the wisest course to
pursue regarding the election luws dittrr widely.
Suite mi the Southern Democrat*, like Alexander
H. BaBTBBB, and Mr. Walton, of (.Yorgia, think that
Hie Demoerata ought to abai'don the programme
)ui<! down at the Extra Session.
Other Southern Democrats like Mr. Singleton ami
Mr. Chalmers think it wiao t<> OOnlllllll the struggle.
Mr. Manning, of Mississippi, nut.' BO regarded bj
imhliiignpuiious about midway between the two ex?
tremes He .mid to a Titim nk correspondent to?
night that while B? considers the ground lukeii by
the DeniooralH at the Extra Session an a pure and
high one, it was not either bb pure or bo high that
the party was fund to assume it by considerations
of patriotism. He said that lust spring tin- question
was snl.mitte l to the Northern Democratic Repre?
sentative* a* to whether it would he policy to make
a tight against the election laws. Their judgment
was in its favor, and the Southern Democrats ac?
quiesced.
Mr. Manning continued, "I am in favor, now. of
leaving the question of continuing the struggle to
the Northern Democratic Representative*. So far
as the Snulh is concerned, we cue very little about
it. Although the policy i* very popular there, Ido
not cutisti ne the result of the Fall elections as a re?
buke to the Democratic Congress for what it did at
tbo Extra Seasion. In Ohio, the Republican ma?
jority was init a small percentage of the entire vote,
it is the judgment of the best informed D. mot-ruts
now thr.t it Jinlire Thurman had h. eii at the head
of the ticket the Demou nts would have won. In
Nca-Y-.-rk, the split in the Democrat ic ranks alone
lieat ns. It was best that this should bo ao fur now
Mr. Tilden is out of the lace, and all dpsensioue will
BO healed la-fore n. xt year."
Mr. Manning continued l?v saying that he does
rot see how ilie Demo, rats call avoid a reni wal of
Ihesfrugirfe lor the repeal the election laws if
they would ; anil he should consul.-i it a very criti?
cal thing to r? treat now. He thinks the coming
m ssion ol Congo s* will he a long one, ami li ? %i- of
the opinion t hut the discussion u| financial questions
will consume a great deal of fine He thinks that
it would Is- ii good plan lo nuttatitiito greenbacks
for the National hank notes, ami keep the supply
of money up to the "demands of business," hut
?v it hout undue inflation.
Representative Atkins, ol Tennesxee, chairman of
the Horn*' Committee on .Vipo printnuis. sa\s that
be is in favor of passing at an early day a hill to
appropriate money to pay f t s of mrshals which
tin- House fadotl to pass at tbo Extra Session. Mr.
Atkins qualified this statement by using the words
" legitmia'e fees. ' He lepeatcd the .same winds
wla u asked about the regular imiuiarv appropria?
tion for the next fiscal year. When inked whether
Iiis roust ruction ot the words " legitimate fees"
would not require that the appropriation bill
ebould con t.tii 11 e Hall hit We clause which occa?
sioned the vetia?? last Spring. Mr. Atkins at lirst
hesitated, and then repicd that he eutild Dot si-o?k
lor the pa it v. and did not like to express an indi?
vidual opinion.
On lina ?ial subjects UM views of Mr. \tkins
?"?in to huvi BadBtgOIH some chaiigc. Last Spiing
he was very anxious for the Warner Silver Intl. j
Now he appears to care very liitle aboul it. I hen
he was fierce lor the repi-.il ot tin- National Hanking I
law; now he seems satisfied to let the National i
banks staid. This chunge is pml. .l.Iy due |o the
luct that Tennessee, lik< tin- ri st ol Ihe country, in
leeling tin return tide ol pros|k-rit.\. Mr. Atkins
says Tennessee lias not been so prosperous since the
w ar as she is to-dav. I he crop* thi*yeai wen mag?
nificent and brought good prices. Real estate is ap?
preciating tanidly in value, and In nil the towns
many new huthiitins me being erected. To show
th.it the " pood times " are not coufined to any one
loc?lity in the Booth, Mr. Atkina related the follow*
inn: I own a j.in-? of loud in rexas, a f w miles
from a growing tow n. A lew we< ago I received
a lelti-r l'om a person in 1*0X00woo uttered .f7 an ;

WaBMIM kin, Nov. 80.? I.'epn'seiitntive Cannon,
of Illinois, says he is not In sympathy with Mr.
Sherman's suggestions as to the liuaneial legisla?
tion which ought to he undertaken this Winter.
He bus all along Ik- hi raiiieal on the silver ques?
tion. He thinks that the BBOPM ol the whole
country, hot Bailtoalailj bI the IfiajthuM, aanatl
view with alarm any new attempts to tinker the
currency. Mr. Cannon is in favor of the Warner
lull.
Mr. Krank Html, of Ohio, says he is not prepared
to give any opinion. He his not hail time to read
the report. Generally sneaking, however, he is in
accord with beer? tary Sin "in ni's; financial views,
although he noes not favor the substitution of
National hank notes for greiii backs. Mr. Hurd
believes that Cio session wll ho long and interest?
ing, politlrabv.
Mr. Chitien.leii, of New-York, thinks that the
question of moat importance before the country Is
that of On constitutionality of the legal-tenders.
He has str.mglv advised Ihn Secretary to assist him
in hin ging the question of their legality to a de?
cision hy Ihe Supreme Conn. He does nut lielicve,

The policy of the minority, he thought, should lie
watchful and conservative, rather than aggressive.
What might or might not he done is a oiiesliiMi here?
after to be il t erminod. Heiini not think the Dcm
oerata thenia ilvas had del rn?ned upon a policy as
to the length ol the aesMon. Auv trivial incident
might make it longer than the majority anticipates.
Any attempt, however,on the part of the majority
to raise toe laenea of the Extra Session will be
promptly niel by the umimiiy with the utmost
v got of opposition.
Senator CokO,of Texas, still wants the Warner
hill to pass. He e.\|Kcts the Southern and Western

mnia en long aa tbo preaoBt rulers of Greel Britain
remain in power, Afortnight ago, for example, yoii
would have said it was iiieredilde that the sit lilen at
teiupt to enforce tha Aagte-Tarkiah Convention with
reference, to Asia Minor, racked as it washy menace,
should ho as taddaoly abandoned. Yet this, if wo
may trust Ministerial oiyans, is what lias happened,
A fortnight since all Luropo was ringing with
the report that England had peremptorily
Msnennoad to Tin key lint tiie tine- had BOBM to put
Bar house in atdar, she must enter upoa tha path
of inform She must give Asia Minor an honest and
nffieieni aorerameat. >Sho must set up a poliea
i. te- with Baker Paeha, ex-convict, to protect the
unprotected females of Armenia. She must d.snii>.s
htabmoad, she must btnak aff her negotiations
witlt Bussia. It wan not known then and is not
known now that each one cf those specific demands
was presented in a definite form to the .sultan. Dot
they were all pilldlclv d i sc iisse.l. liolhon the Cult
ttneat and iti Eaudand these annonBeenente were
accepted as MbateBtiaBy true. It was universally
be!tared that the British GoYernmeat bad gtrea the
Porte to nn.h i stand th.it large lacasurcR ef reform
iiiusf, ba entered upon at once. Tho Forte
having dallied with this ns with every previous
demand, m order wen! to Malta to pot tha licet in
motion for Turkish waters. This v.as not only uni?
versally believed ; it was directly BOBBTtad by tha
UlllliltOflal papers in LoitdOB, nml for days the
whole question involved in this start ling proced?
ure was di luted with gn at vivacity. At last, on
I hursday, Xoveiiihcr Ii, BBBM B nncl; aniiniinei p ent
that Muslims I'acha.Turkish Ambassador in London,
had Riven satisfactory BSBtmnCeO to Lord Salisbury
that Tin key pledged herself to i n.tr upon the w
nuireil reforms at once, and that, the movement of
the geal had IM IB fBTB been countermanded. In
mentioning tins announcement in a letter of that
date 1 spoke of it as all but incredible. It certainly
ma net generally credited. One Mwa agency oon tra?
il ioted it on offletal aatbority, Bnt there was a
general diapoeitien to wall ior Lord EfeneonaflehPi
GnUdbeB apaeobt then due four days off. When
tha' speech bad been heard, and the stop, f iction
produced hy ita oontemptaoite silence on tbo ntaat
Blearing toph i of KM day had passed off, curiosity
al> ait t his I urkish business revived. Hints were
thrown out from day lo day (ha:, after nil, nothing
had oeenrn 1 te w arrant such excitement. And to
day 11 seems ch ar fmm semi- fti i; I declarations
that the iin rcdible news uiusl. be credited. Sir
Henry Layanl has certainly been blustering und
threatening at the Porto nml the Palace. Hut his
chief in London has once more allowed himself tu
BO pacified by a Turkish promise.
All tliis would ho amusing enough if it were tint
hutiulialinir. It appeals from the s rinoii preached
this moniintr by one Combiratira organ that tho
faul I lies with that loag-euffBring crcture, ll;e
public. 'I he public expected loo iniich. Ihe foible
of the epoch 'ii which we live is i MggOtwtiOB, and
thin baft incident has been exar-crated. That is
what are are new asked ta beliaea. The mmon
?traneea addreeaed to the sultan by Lord BaaeoM*
field's oriler were of far less fonti'dailo .?haractcr
than our hasty imagination conjeetuicd. I'erhaps
the Porteitaelf made tha story woree,orerstating
tin demands made upon it, seeking; to ex:'ite preju?
dice afiiu^t the Power that counselled reform,
so ns to bide ita own BhOftBOBUngi under (he
alum of Barege at the supposed ambition
of which it was tho victim. BnMiB, of course,
helped. She always does help in whatever mischief
ia plotting for tbo moment. No patriotic English
man can dorhi that when a Paeha plutideis a prov?
ince the Muscovite Ie eariebed.er that when the Turk
makes n promise it is PriBOO LobaOOtl who helps
him to break il. The ( zuV minimi ut PrniltBBtl
BOpla is the niilhor of all the dispatches whtoh rcp
reeeat Bir Heary Laraid in a laenaeiiig attttada i
loeiadlag, 1 suppose, Sir Henry's own telegrams.
And Huts, we are smilinidv told, "tints 'be more
(ri dalona pottlon of the public h ive Dome to olieve
thai Lord BeaOOBafteki is ineditatiiiif a series of pro?
ceedings iu tho East wbieli intist MOeOBBail"
yaopard our goad relations with lurkey, and max
possibly involvo us in a ffeeh controversy with
Kas-ia." Upen which ch li.like biiircesiion I will
nnly remark that nmoiiK BM muro crcitulous por?
tion of the pahlte must be included not only the
whole Cunt iin tital press, but the journal from which
ths ehildlika enggoatian hi now quoted. Tbo aaam
eoBWhariOM must be drawn trom an inspired ohset \ a
tion in another Ifinfarterlal orgBB that the BM ral
duties imposed upon England bf her relations with
Teihey may he discharged by steatly and, at the
same tiiin>, i autiotis pressure upon the Porte, "re
BMBlberiiio that our duties are not necessarily i o
eitensive with our nuiit-*. and that we need only
enforce tho latter when it stems expedient to
do so.''
Acvcjitinir thoBO Inspired utterances as true or us

to bctriend. There is no lack of explanations fnr
this lust collapse. Some of these 1 have
Bin Bdy given. The nin.it ingenious of the

is not a collapse at all. A fresh iclegrani from Con?
stantinople appeals this morning. Coming aa it
doee throogb a*aalm*i Aganey, it mnai ba ragardad
asast itcinent which the Portedoatred made public.
It is the characteristic of Keuter'a political tele
gxame that they huvo usually an "offleloua" origin,
and tell not always the tiuih# still leas oflou tbo
whole truth, hut for the most paitaoajtttl of the
truth as the nflical minil thinks it deniable to i aP>
niunicate to the outside, world. This comment nmy

November II, and the rcpuhlication ut it can only be
due t? a desire to repossess the public mind with
the iioiion of nil accord belWOBR England and Tur?
key which did not exist then and cannot exist now.
It is even thought worth while to reprint the old
statement (with a new date* that the I'orle will
carry out the reforms demanded by England,
that the Sultan has ratified a scheme and
ordered it to he curried into execution- one scheme
for Eiiiopcan Turkey nnd another for A?ia Minor,

says he htm never thought Ibe Atigln-Turkish Con?

ercd it. It is nu undertaking by England to defend
the whole tetritorv of Asia Minor against Fussi;
on eondition, however, that Tin key exci utcs the
required reforms in In r nlui ir-trutton. Il lias at
last become evident to Lord II aeouaileld thiit tho

with risk to he allowed to hang over DM

to the Suit an : " We have pressed you to refotm j
we have done everything we can to make vou re?

may bo the true explanation, bnl it is certainly in
