TOOK THEIR LIVES
gnicide of Mrs. Cooper and Her
Daughter Causes a Sensation
at San Francisco.
Mrs. Cooper Had a National Rep­
utation in Educational
Affairs.
Prominence in the Brown Trial
Thought to fie an Indirect
Cause.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 12.—Mrs. Sarah
H. Cooper and her daughter, Harriet
Cooper, were fonnd dead in their home
in this city, with the gas turned on and
every evidence of suicide.
Mrs. Cooper was president of the
Kindergarten association, and her
daughter was deputy superintendent.
JVIrs. Cooper had lived here 30 years
and was widely known as an educator,
philanthropist and writer. She was
president of the Woman's Press asso­
ciation president of the Woman's
Suffrage association, and prominent as
an officer of the W. C. T. U. For
many years she taught the largest
Bible class in the city in the First Con*
gregational church, her class number*
ing several hundred adults. She was
also assistant pastor of the church, un*
der the pastorate of Rev. Dr. C. O.
Brown.
By her will, written Thursday, she
requests that the bodies of herself and
daughter be not taken to the morgue.
The Coopers had lived entirely alone,
except for a Chinese cook, who had
been in their employ for 20 years. He
has not yet been found. It is expected
he can throw some light on the trag­
edy.
Were Prominent in the Brown Caae.
When the scandal concerning Mr.
Brown was first talked about Mrs.
Cooper stood by the pastor and ex­
pressed confidence in him. Later de­
velopments caused her to change her
mind, and she and her daughter were
his most prominent opponents and ac­
cusers after Mrs. Davidson.
Much bitterness in church circles was
engendered by Mrs.
Cooper's statements
on the witness stand at the church
trial. Miss Cooper was even more pro
nounced than her mother in opposition
to Dr. Brown.
This action estranged mahy other
friends and the suicide of the mother
«nd daughter is ascribed to the brood­
ing over coldness and snubs from for*
vier friends.
Mrs. Cooper was supersensitive, and
of late has been much worried over the
illness of her daughter, who has been
suffering from nervous prostration
caused by the outcome of the church
troubles.
No Woman More Prominent.
No woman on the Pacific coast has
been so prominent for a generation as
Mrs. Cooper, who lias often preached
in Congregational pulpits, and has been
engaged in all departments of Christian
work. She formerly resided in New
Orleans, and acted as a nurse during
the war. Her husband and other chil­
dren died in New Orleans. Her tragic
end and has caused an immense sensa­
tion in this city.
Tfre room in which the bodies were
found was full of escaping gas, which
the physicians say had undoubtedly
caused asphyxiation. It is said that on
.several prior occasions Harriet Cooper
had tried to take her life, but this time
the mother seems to have joined her
daughrer in the effort to end their
liven. It is said Mr. Cooper also ended
his own life.
In her will, Mrs. Cooper says her
stated intention of committing suicide
would afford sufficient proof to render
unnecessary a coroner's investigation.
Many influential friends tried to have
her wishes carried out, but Coroner
Hawkins ordered both bodies taken to
the morgue. The bodies were discov­
ered at 9 :30 a. m., aiid the doctors who
were summoned, declared the women
had been dead several hours.
Had Money Bat No Papers.
COLUMBIA, MO., Dec. 12.—An un­
known man jumped from the east
bound train 011 the Missouri, Kansas
and Texas, while going at the rate of
40 miles an hour and was instantly
killed. He had $8,000 in his possession,
but nothing tending to his identifica­
tion, except a ticket reading from
Denison, Tex., to St. Louis.
Civil Service Reform Officers.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 12.—The Civil
Service Reform association re-elected
the following officers President, Carl
Schurz vice presidents, Charles Francis
Adams, Augustus R, McDonough, J.
Hall Pleasants, Henry Hitchcock,
Franklin MacYeagh, William Potts
and Rev. Henry E. Potter. Archbishop
P. J. Ryan was elected a vice president
to fill the vacancy caised by the death
of Rt. Rev. Stephven N. Ryan.

Indian­
apolis Bimetallic league has decided to

MADRID, Dec. 12.—A dispatch from

fohn F. Elliott, Urotlier of Peer* and Gov­
ernors, Arrested For Forgery.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 13.—John F.
Elliott, a man with a remarkable his­
tory, whose brother is a peer of the
English realm, li^s been arrested in
Pendleton for forgiug a check for $30.
Elliott was found almost nude and suf­
fering from delirium tremens, and
while in jail tried repeatedly to com­
mit suicide. His brother, Sir Henry
Elliott, is now governor of one of the
British possessions in Africa where are
located enormously rich gold mines,
recently developed. He was formerly
English ambassador in Madrid, Berlin,
Vienna, and was ambassador in Con­
stantinople when the Turko-Bussian
war broke out. Elliott's brother-in-law
is now lieutenant governor of Mani­
toba. His ancle, Sir Gilbert Elliott,
was many years ago speaker of the
British house of commons.
AGAINST THE READING.
Attorney General of Pennsylvania May
Bring Action.
HARRISBURO, Pa., Dec. 13.—Attorney
General McCormick may bring suit
against the reorganized Beading rail­
road to determine whether it is a bona
fide corporation. The Reading com­
pany claims to act under a charter
granted by special act of the assembly
in 1871, with large and unlimited pow­
ers. By the constitution, which be­
came operative Jan. 1, 1874, all private
charters under which bona fide organ­
izations had not been effected and busi­
ness commenced at that time, were de
clared void.
The attorney general has been led to
believe that the charter of the Reading
company fell under that provision of
the constitution and that possibly an
attempt was being made to avoid an­
other provision forbidding joint owner­
ship or control of mining corporations
and railroad corporations.
THE EX-QUEEN SILENT.
Liiltnokalani Gives No Keaaon for Her
Unexpected Viait to America*
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. la.—The unex­
pected arrival of ex-Queen Liliuokalani
from Honolulu evoked much interest
and gave rise to no little speculation as
to the object of her trip. Her only at­
tendants were a man and woman serv­
ant, and even her San Francisco agent
and former chamberlain, Colonel Mac
Farlane, did not know of the ex
queen's arrival until he received a sum­
mons from her on the arrival of the
steamer.
Liliuokalani declines to be inter­
viewed and will give no information
regarding the length of her visit here,
nor her future plans. Her fellow pas­
sengers on the steamer gathered the
idea that she will go to Washington
anf call upon President Cleveland in
the hope that the United States will
take some steps looking to the restora­
tion of the Hawaiian monarchy.
Ice Gorge 31 ay Cause Suits.
WABASHA, Minn., Dec. 12.—There is
a prospect of much war in the courts
over the ice gorge in the Mississippi
river below Reeds Landing. It is
claimed that when the Mississippi Log­
ging company saw the logs going down
the river it immediately closed the
boom at West Newton, and that was
the whole cause of the ice gorge. This
matter is being looked up, and if it is
found %hat the company boomed the
river and thus formed the gorge there
is no question as to the suits.
Did Not Indict Spute.
DENVER, Dec. 12.—The grand jury
has unanimously voted not to present a
bill for an indictment against Andrew
J. Spute, who had been accused of the
murder of his wife and four children,
who were drowned several weeks ago
in Smiths lake, where they were boat­
ing. Spute will now take the necessary
steps to collect the §10,000 insurance on
his wife's life.

Disaster In the Queen Mine at Hedges,
Cal.—Cnveiii the Cause.
Los ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 12.—A spe­
cial dispatch from Yuma says that
news has reached there from Hedges,
15 miles distant, in San Diego county,
of a terrible disaster in the Queen mine
at that place, owned by the Gold Cross

time daring the night a cavein oc­
curred in the main shaft and as a re­
sult several miners have lost their lives
and more are injured. Hearts alc

ally accepted one is that four miliars
are entombed at the bottom of the .shaft

five have been rescued, badly injured.
'••resident Will ltest.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1?.—President

waters. After the hard work and ciose
attention incident to the Venezuelan

i'AST FINDING OUT

Vehemence.
BOSTOS, Dec. 11.—A special to
The

"It is learned positively that the re
port of the death of Maceo and youug
Gomez is false. Both are believed to

HAVANA, Dec. 11.—Dr. Maxim Zer
tucha, who was the personal physician

Brava, in an engagement between tho
insurgents and a Spanish column com­

UNDERCURRENT OF DOUBT.
Identification of Maceo Not Considered
Complete £ren in Havana.
HAVANA, Dec. 11—The confident
claims of the Spanish officials that they
have abundant proof of the death of
Antonio Maceo and his young aid,
Francisco Gomez, son of Maximo Go­
mez, continue without abatement. The
details which are announced, however,
of the facts relied upon for the identi­
fication of the two Cubans l^ave caused
an undercurrent of doubt in this city.
There has been no actual identification
of the bodies themselves, the conviction
as to identity resting upon the evidence
of documents and articles found upon
