The president is excoriated for his
threat to use troops and he openly is
harged with deliberately misstating
position taken by the authorities
lof this city and the state.
Should force be used the Califor
tuians declare they will not weaken
land while they may have to bow for
the time being to federal dictation
they will withdraw all the white chil­
dren from the public schools and leave
them in sole possession of the Japa­
nese.
Californians Reseat His Dehumciatioo of Their Anti-Jap­
anese Attitude-Deciare They Will Not Weaken
San Francisco, Dec. 6.—President?
tloosevelt's denunciation of Califor­
nia's anti-Japanese attitude has
aroused bitter resentment here.
Open threats are made that Califor­
nia will be turned to the Democratic
column in the next election, the cam
aign slogan to be, "The Democratic
arty Is a white man's party."
There also has arisen another fea­
ture—bitter, open resentment against
Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of
the ^University of California. In Pres­
ident Roosevelt's message Californians
declare they recognize the words and
sentiments of the head of the state
university and against him, rather
than against either Roosevelt or the
federal government, is directed the
greater part of the wrath of San Fran­
cisco.
Angry men declared Wheeler had
taken upanhimself to dictate the pol­
icy of California and from his stand­
point to tell the rest of the nation hoyr
'California stands. Threats are open­
ly made to cut the appropriation of the
university one-half in the next' legis­
lature to teach Its. head. ha cannot run

Federal Officials Will HaVe Court*
Pass on California 8tatute.
San Francisco, Dec. 6.—Under direct
*v orders from Washington the represen
tatives of the department of justice in
California have been Instructed to be
jgin an action in the courts to test the
legality of the state statute which

descent shall attend a separate school.
President Allman of the board ~ot
education has received a communlca
jtlon from United States Attorney Dev­
lin requesting a conference that ar­
rangements might be made to insti­
tute a suit.
When the attention of President All
man was called to that portion of the
president's message referring to sep
arate schools he said that the utter
ance of the president on the Japanese
question would have no effect on the
action of the board.
"We have simply put Into effect a
|aw passed by the lawmaking body of
this state," he said. "Individually
land collectively each and every mem-
iier of the board believes that It is a
«, good law. We will not recede from
:1 the position which we have taken and
"believe that our action will be sus
-,,Yk jtalned by .public sentiment throughout
/tKt jthe state even If the courts should de
clare it to be uncoh8titutio^ OT a
violation of treaty rights."
BRITONS HAVE RACE TBOUBLE8.

of Roosevelt's Message.
London, Dec. 6.—President Boose
velt's declaration In his message to
congress on the treatment aocorded to

British Indians, even those long resl»
Sent to the country, while quite -ro-.
jitiy the government refused to a®-

eittlal tariff "provided the goods were
khipped in vessels not employing
tew seamen."
Tfce newspapers here point out that
Weitern states of Amerloa have
no

Laying that the president's remarks
"conrey a lesson whichmlght well be
laid to heart In other Quarters than
Uut to which It is directly address^"

KAN8AS LAND FRAUD8.
Charges Filed Against Ranchmen and
Speculators.
Topeka, Kan.. Dec. 6.—Speculators
and ranchmen have committed fraud­
ulent practices in entering school
lands in Western Kansas, according to
records filed, here with the land com­
missioner. The alleged fraud has, it
Is said, been in the exorbitant ap­
praisement of lessees' improvements.
It appears that speculators and ranch­
ers. have leased lands, built small
shanties or dugouts on them and then
fenced the. property. When it came
time' to sell the land appraisers rec­
ommended by the lessee would then
bid and get the land. No outside bid­
der would try to make'an offer since
'he ,would have to pay for the im­
provements which were not on the
land. It has been found that the
fences around a 10,000-acre tract of
ranch land was charged as improve­
ments on one forty-acre tract of school
land which had been leased.

KILLED PROMINENT PHYSICIAN.
Mississippi Young Woman Placed on
Trial for Murder.
Hazlehurst, Miss., Dec. 6.—The trial
on a charge of murder of Mrs. Angie
Blrdsong, a young member of one of
the most prominent families in Mis­
sissippi, began during the day.
Mrs. Birdsong shot and killed Dr. T.
H. Butler, also a member of a prom­
inent family and nephew of former
Governor Longino of Mississippi, on
Nov. 25, 1905. The shooting occurred
in Dr. Butler's office in Monticello,
Miss., where Mrs. Birdsong resided.
The young woman went to the office,
waited until a patient had completed
his interview with the physician and
then, entering Dr. Butler's presence,
fired five shots. Going to the street
she remarked to a gathering crowd
that they would find the result of her
work up stairs in the doctor's, office.
She then surrendered herself to the
sheriff. Although admitting the shoot­
ing she has not let her line of defense
become public.
A few days before the shooting Mrs.
Birdsong attempted to commit suicide.
At her preliminary hearing her
brother-in-law testified that the pris­
oner had experienced extreme mental
troubles oyer rumors concerning her
character.
The- prominence of both families in
the case and intense feeling in Monti
cello caused a change of venue to be
granted. Mrs. Birdsong is about
twenty-two years of age.
SEEKS INCREASE OF POWER
PRESIDENT WOULD DISMISS ANY
OFFICER WHOM HE THINKS
IS UNWORTHY.
Washington, Dec. 6.—The president
has sent a special message to congress
urging legislation giving the executive
authority upon his own initiative and
responsibility to dismiss any officer
whom he thinks unworthy to remain
in the service. The law at present
provides that in time of peace no offi­
cer .shali.be dismissed exceptJn pur­
suance of a.co'urtmartial or In mitiga­
tion thereof. "This provision the" pres­
ident wants repealed.
Illustrating the necessity for the
legislation desired the president cites
the case of a naval officer whose name
is not given, but who was accused of
"indecent and disgusting behavior."
He was convicted, but the court, to his
surprise, the president says, did not
sentence him to dismissal.

The senate committee on foreign re­
lations considered the treaty and or­
dered that it be favorably reported to
the senate. This action was taken,
however, after a committee consisting
of Senators Spooner, Lodge and Bacon
tion which would declare that the
TJnited States had no intention of in­
terfering in the regulation of Euro­
pean internal affairs.
The contest in the senate over the
treaty will be close in the event that
a disclaimer of the character outlined
is not adopted. The United States is
exempted from the responsibility of
enforcing the treaty through a reser­
vation made by Ambassador White,
the American delegate, in signing the
act.
BILLS, PETITIONS, ETC.

ance In Senate.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Morning busi­
ness was heavy in the senate. It was

fore the senate a number of communi­
cations from the executive depart­
ments, which were ordered printed as
documents.
No Action on Resolutions.
Washington, Dec. 6.—After debate
the senate postponed for a day the
consideration of the resolutions call­
ing for information relative to the dis­
charge cf the negro troops of the
Twenty-fifth infantry, formerly sta­

under arrest here since Nov. 7

warrant Hau's extradition, bat to make
the caft complete It was necessary to
have proof of the cause of the death
of Frau Molittor, which the German
authorities had omitted to obtain.
Hau, although laboring under a
great mental strata, which has entirely
changed, his appearance, was quite
calm during tfee brief proceedings and
at the close, whan asked by his coun
ml whether he understood' what bad
occurred, he replied affirmatively.

tion-Urges General Republican Caucus
Washington, Dec. 6.—Congressman
Butler Ames of Massachusetts has be­
gun a prppaganda for an immediate
movement in the interest of tariff re­
vision. He says he is not undertak­
ing to secure action at the present
session of congress, but Is urging upon
Republican members the advisability
of a general caucus to "give concrete
expression of their determination to
immediately revise the inequalities
present in our tariff laws so that all
possible notice to the country at large
may be given as to the time of re­
vision." He thinks that the subject
should be taken up immediately after
March 4 and would have the caucus
determine the best method of proce­
dure and whether the whole tariff laws
should be revised or only particular
schedules amended.

and In the interest of its commercial
relations with Morocco.
