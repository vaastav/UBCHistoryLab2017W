Indianapolis can get along without an
arsenal or a garrison, but as Baltimore
has asked for grounds of Fort Henry, con
cerning which "The Star-spangled Banner"
was written, for a park, Indianapolis might
ask for the arsenal grounds for a like pur
pose. The proposition of the Federation of La
bor to unionize the school teachers of the
country presents some interesting features.
If the leaders shall be able to organize a
school teachers union in a city like In
dianapolis, will they assume to be the
judges of the qualifications of teachers and

"Will they also fix the compensation?
By the death of Mr. W. D. Mlnshall,
which occurred at hia home in Terre
Haute yesterday, Indiana loses a public
spirited citizen who, during a long and
successful business career, was honorably
Identified with many public enterprises and

before the public of late years, but he
leaves behind him an enviable record of
Eood citizenship and good works.
Hardly any person would plead guilty to
fever mailing a letter or package that was
improperly or Illegibly addressed or with
out postage prepaid, yet the annual re
port of the operations of the dead letter of
fice at Washington shows that 8,507,257
pieces of mail matter were received there
during' last year, and a large proportion
of them were due to the causes named.
The list Included 33.SC7 letters and 22,172
parcels without any address whatever, and
a curious feature of the case is that these
causes operate with a kind of regularity
from year to year.
Now that it Is known that the gift of
Mr. Carnegie proposing to establish a
national university Is in the form of
bonds of the United States Steel Corpora
tion. It Is reported that the President hesi
tates to accept the donation In that form.
One newspaper declares that acceptance
would bo an indorsement of trusts. An
other, the Pittsburg Dispatch, says that
If the stock of the company were ofCered
there might be cause for hesitation, but
when the gift Is in bonds, which have
value Independent of the commercial for
tunes of the company, there can be noth
ing of the kind. Nevertheless, it would
raise a howl.
President Castro, of Venezuela, is at
tracting come attention by his threats to
prevent Germany from collecting $2,000,000
of Interest due Germans for railroad con
struction. Castro says that if the Germans
eelze the port of La Guayra to collect cus
toms to liquidate the obligation he will de
claro free trade, so that there will be no
duties to collect. He says that if Germany
thall attempt to approach Caracar. its
troops will be exterminated. Again, he asks
why he should bo held responsible for
debts Incurred by his predecessor. Castro
will probably yield when the demand Is
made, but his tall; shows how unfit he is
for the position. v

ernor to fill a vacancy, and who has led in
the prorrcutlon of Tammany offenders, an
uouncas fcinjshatlc opposition to the propo
sition to open the saloons of New York
part of Sunday. He says the demand for
an ojen saloon on Sunday does not come
from workingmen, as has been stated, since
any one who will visit the Sunday saloons
finds that those who visit them are men
more or less committed to a life of dissipa
tion. He believes there is less temptation
to go Into a saloon under the present sys
tem, under which the law is violated, than
there would be if Sunday opening were le
galized. The district attorney is a close
friend of Archbishop Corrigan, and it is
Intimated that Mr. Fhilbln has spoken the

CS 12 II 31 AX Y AXD THE MOMIOE
DOCTRIXK.
A dispatch from Berlin says that some J
commotion has been caused in the press
there by cablegrams from New York to
the effect that the United States govern
ment "considers Incorrect the German of
ficial view of that passage In President
Roosevelt's message containing his defi
nition of the Monroe doctrine, which Is
here construed as permitting of the col
lection of private claims against South
American countries by force." The dis
patch quotes a leading Berlin paper as
saying: "Ifx Germany found it necessary
to occupy a Venezuelan port she would not
ask Uncle Sam's permission to do so."
Some allowance must be made for Jingoism
In all countries, and it does not follow that
the German government is excited because
the German press Is. Allowance must also
be made for the often erroneous and some
times mischievous statements of corre
spondents who seem to find particular
Xleasure in trying to foment bad feeling
between different countries.
There is no occasion for misunderstand
ing President Itoosevelt's definition of the
Monroe doctrine. He said It was a decla
ration that there "must be no territorial
aggrandizement by any European power at
the expense of any American power cn
American Eoil." He said further that the
doctrine had nothing to do with the com
mercial relations of any American state,
and finally that "the United States does
not guarantee any state against punish
ment if it misconducts itself, provided
that punishment does not take the form
of the acquisition of territory by any non
American power." This is the most ex
plicit definition of the Monroe doctrine ever
made by any President. The definition
confines the doctrine strictly to opposing
and preventing any new territorial estab
lishment or territorial extension by any Eu
ropean power on American soil. It ex
pressly disclaims any purpose to meddle
with the commercial relations of any Amer
ican state or to guarantee any state against
punishment if it misconducts itself, "pro
vided that punishment does not take the
form of the acquisition of territory by any
non-American power." Under this defi
nition a European power may enforce its
right3 and claims against an American
state In any manner and to any extent
short of despoiling Its territory or acquir
ing a new foothold on American soil. It
follows, of course, that Germany or any
other European power could adopt any
measures deemed necessary to enforce the
payment by an American state of Just
claims, either public or private, or to com
pel reparation for an insult to its flag or
injury to its citizens, short of acquiring
American territory. Sending warships to
enforce payment of a claim or to demand
an apology, seizing a customhouse to col
lect a debt, even declaring war for good
cause would be no violation of the Monroe
doctrine unles It resulted or was evidently
intended to result In the acquisition of
American territory. The German govern
ment has a right to construe President
Roosevelt's statements in this way, and
there is not the least reason to suppose
that such a construction would be objected
to by this government.
NEW ENGLAND'S ANNIVERSARY.
During this week, in the larger cities of
the country, New England societies will
celebrate the landing of the Pilgrims in
Massachusetts by speech and banquet. That
euch celebrations are held annually in many
cities bears evidence to the enterprising
spirit of the decendants of the early set
tlers of New England in seeking homes
elsewhere, while their annual celebration
of the anniversary Indicates that wherever
they roam the New Englander who traces
his ancestry back to Pilgrim or Puritan is
pioud of his origin and of the achievements
of his ancestors. Time and circumstance
often make strange combinations. Dec. 20,
or some day near it, is celebrated as the
Puritan anniversary, when, as a matter
of fact, they did not call themselves Puri
tans, but were known as Pilgrims.
The subsequent Immigrants who were
known as the colony of Massachusetts Bay
and were much more numerous than those
who constituted the Plymouth colony, were
called Furitans. So it has come about that
in common speech the Puritan stands as
the typical early New Engländer, while the
date of the landing of the Pilgrim fathers
is the anniversary on which the Puritan
is chiefly talked about.
A class of speakers who are Invited to
New England dinners because they have
tho reputation of being orators seem to
take delight In ridiculing and misrepre
senting the early New Englander. They
are charged with burning witches and per
secuting Friends and Baptists at a time
when persecution was the method of the
Christian world in dealing with unbelievers.
They are charged with austerity In religion
! and morals at a time when in all the world
the right of freedom of thought was gen
erally denied. Such critics have always
tjsumed that the Puritan should have been
much more liberal and much better than
were other men of his times. That he was
morally a better man and Intellectually a
j stronger man than those who persecuted
I him. there is little ground to doubt. He
had so good an opinion of himself that he
j was of sufficient consequence In the sight
j of God to be the object of His special care.
That conviction had much to do with the
; rart he took, in the world's affairs. Some
J of his laws for the regulation of his neigh
bors' conduct may seem ridiculous, but
many laws attributed to him were not his
but the work of his slanderers.
Hut when his detractors have done their
utmost. Impartial history accords to him
development of popular government the
establishment of a Puritan republic of the
New England colonies, founded upon a
basla of suffrage, before the contest for
independence began. It cannot be denied
that In the struggle for independence the
New England colonies furnished the largest
number of men to bear arms and had the
maltest number of Tories at home to
watch. They gave the country in the town
meeting the Ideal form of popular loenl
government. They conceived and estab
lished the public school. While It is true
that the descendants of the Puritans have
lost their distinctive features in the larg-r
New England cities, they are scattered
throughout the land and are such a vital
and positive element that In every city of
100.000 Inhabitants they have vigorous so
cieties which In intelligence and influence
bear evidence of the strenuous character
of the people who settled New England.
CHILDREN RESCUE WORK.
Those who take an interest in social re
forms or who note the development of pub
lic sentiment on current questions must
have observed how rapidly different kinds
of children-saving work have come to the
front in recent years. Originally the treat
ment of crime contemplated nothing but
the punishment of criminals, with scarcely
any thought of reform. The punishment
was almost purely vindictive. It was a
long time before the idea of trying to re
form criminals was developed, and another
long interval elapsed before this was fol
lowed by efforts to prevent crime. It is
now generally conceded that prevention is
better than cure because it is cheaper, more
effective and more humane. It is easier to
save a child than it is to reform a man, and
society as well as the individual gains more
by the former process than it does by the
latter. Thin conviction has given rise to
many organizations and plans of work for
rescuing children from bad environments,
from ways that tend Inevitably toward
crime, and bringing them under good in
fluences during the plastic years of life.
There cannot be too much such work done.
Truant schools, compulsory education laws,
reform schools, curfew laws, children's
guardian laws and other similar measures
are all the outgrowth of the child-saving
idea. It Is surprising that it took so long
for this Idea to develop, and yet it is too
plain for argument that to remove exposed
children from surroundings which threaten
to lead them Into careers of crime is better
than to await the commencement of such
a career. Involving additional difficulties
and responsibilities for those who under
take to save them. Even compulsory edu
cation and truancy laws are of compara
tively recent origin. Massachusetts was
the only State that had them before the
civil war. During the decade from 1S70 to
1SS0 they were adopted by Michigan, New
Hampshire, Connecticut, California, Kan
sas, New York, Maine, New Jersey, Wyom
ing, Ohio and Wisconsin. Between 1SS0 and
1890 nine additional States enacted such
laws, and since 1S30 several others. Includ
ing Indiana, have done so. Compulsory ed
ucation is now considered as much a duty
incumbent on the State as the maintenance
of free schools. This is only one phase of
children-rescue work, though probably the
most important. The field is a large one
and there is ample room for the operation
of all the plans and methods that can be
devised for carrying on the work. In spite
of all that Is being done crime seems to be
on the increase, and how to arrest or pre
vent it Is one of the most difficult problems
society has to deal with.
CHILDREN AND THE LAW.
The disposition toward a reform in the
methods of dealing with children who of
fend against the law 13 manifesting itself
simultaneously In many places. That a re
form was needed has long been recognized
by persons familiar with the ordinary
course of procedure in such cases, and
to none has the need been more clear than
to Judges and court attaches, and even
policemen upon whom devolves the duty
of taking the unruly youngsters into cus
tody. Often, Indeed, It Is to these policemen
that the evils of the old plan of bringing
toys Into contact with older criminals and
of haling them before a magistrate along
with the hardened wretches, thus classify
ing them together, have presented them
selves most strongly. Various plans have
been devised for preventing this contact
and avoiding unnecessary humiliation and
disgrace to boys who have committed mis
demeanors, not crimes. In this city the
matter has been taken in hand by the po
lice Judges themselves. Judge Stubbs's pre
decessor tried the plan of calling in tho
parents of the young offenders and having
them administer punishment to their re
spective sons in the shape of a sound
trouncing. The system seems to have
worked fairly well. Judge Stubbs has ar
ranged for a special session of his court
on Friday of each week, in which he will
hear the cases of boys and girls who have
been placed under arrest. Meanwhile, the
children are tolbe given into the custody
of their parents, who are held responsible
for their isolation and for their appearance
In court. Thi3 does away with imprison
ment in the police station and a conse
quent stigma upon the youngsters, which
in itself is encouragement to recklessness
and future lawlessness. The new charter
of Greater New York, soon to go into effect,
provides for a special court for the hearing
of charges against children. Chicago has
such a court in operation, and an account
of its workings, given In another column,
shows the importance of having a man
in charge who has a wise and fatherly
sympathy for boys, an insight into their
natures, and infinite patience. Judge Tut
hill, of Chicago, seems to have all these
qualities, and it is safe to say that the
boys with whom he deals do not leave his
presence with resentment in their hearts
and an ill opinion of the law, but with
gratitude and a resolve to behave better in
future. The entire movement looks to the
guidance and reform rather than the pun
ishment of children, and will undoubtedly
result in great good. The youngsters, most
of them, have in them the potentialities of
good citizens, and wise treatment at ths
critical time Is likely to turn them per
manently in the right direction.
NEWSPAPERS AS POPULAR EDU
CATORS. The annual report of the commissioner of
education discusses at considerable length
educational extension In the United States
and classes newspapers among the potent
agencies. Other agencies recognized are
public schools, the lecture platform, free
libraries and museums, the Influence of
travel and pilgrimage, university extension
work, etc., but newspapers are ranked
among the best of all. This classification,
of course, embraces only clean and good
newspapers, though probably It will have
to be admitted that bad ones also have an
educational Influence in wrong directions.
The report characterizes the rise of great
newspapers as "one of the most striking
educational phenomena of the nineteenth
century," and concedes that the press has
probably had more to do than any other
ageocr in shaping public opinion and in de-
veloplng the democratic spirit In politics
and culture. "Newspapers," it says, "ac
complish for adults what public schools
do for the young. They liberate and In
form the mind. They inspire the will and
train the human spirit for useful action.
In one sense the public prints are the
schoolbooks of the Nation, educating citi
zens and voters to a knowledge of their
duty." This Is undoubtedly true. What
ever the general imperfections of the Amer
ican press may be, or however much It may
be discredited by individual instances, the
net influence of the press as a whole has
been and is of incalculable value to the
country and the people and to the cause oi
civilization and progress. Admitting all
that its critics may say, and more, it must
still be recognized as among the foremost
of popular educators. The commissioner
of education does this in the most ungrudg
ing manner. "Of far-reaching educational
influence upon the American people," he
says, "is the dally newspaper. It comes
morning and evening Into almost every
household in large towns, and is read by
every adult citizen of ordinary Intelligence.
The affairs of the town, city, State, Nation
and the world are subjects of familiar con
versation at breakfast and dinner in every
household." The commissioner admits that
many persons give too much attention to
mere "news" and to editorial opinions of the
daily press and too little to good books and
the best periodical literature, but he sees in
the American passion for newspaper read
ing evidence that the people are vitally in
terested in contemporary progress and liv
ing truth. "Beyond all question," the re
port concludes, "the dally newspaper 13 the
most potent educational power in the
United States. Some critics affect to de
spise newspaper reading, but it is the bread
of Intellectual life for the common people,
and some of the best and most cultivated
writers in America are regular contributors
to the press." The truth of this can be
best appreciated by those who have the
best means of observing the activities of
the press in every field of progress and in
every branch of education and who are
capable of discriminating between newspa
pers like the Journal and those of a dif
ferent class and type.
The annual report of the Board of Edu
cation of Washington, of which Gen. II. V.
Boynton is president, shows the public
schools of the national capital to be In line
with the most progressive in the country.
In noticing the good results of a military
organization among the pupils of the high
school the board suggests that every boy
should learn how to cook rations proper
ly. "If this invaluable knowledge for a
soldier," says the report, "should be
coupled with training In the cadet corps,
such young men could enter the field able
to render most efficient service to the coun
try, and assured of certain and rapid pro
motion." The board makes other sugges
tions on the same line which it thinks "are
in no sense visionary, but, on the contrary,
reaching down to the foundations upon
which the strength and safety and peace
of the Republic rest." Such suggestions
would certainly have been regarded as
visionary a generation or two ago, but they
are not out of keeping with modern ideas
of education.
Chicago has a society whose purpose is to
teach people that they sleep too much, and
that it is a wicked waste of time to spend
eight hours a day, or one-third of their ex
istence. In slumber. Four hours' sleep, the
society asserts, is quite enough for any
grown person. The members of the club
are pledged to sleep but four hours In the
twenty-four. The theory will, no doubt,
work well for a time, Just as It did in the
case of the thrifty man of tradition who
gradually reduced the rations of his horse
to one straw a day. Unfortunately, Just as
this desirable end was attained the horse
died. The members of this fool club may
not die, but when nature gets tired of their
nonsense they will lay their heads on their
respective pillows some night and not wake
till next week.
The best thing Mrs. Roosevelt can do is
to buy out a handkerchief bargain counter.
Some enterprising ladies of a Pennsylvania
town who were getting up a church fair
asked the President's wife for a contribu
tion. She sent them an embroidered hand
kerchief. They sold it to the highest
bidder, thereby adding ten dollars to their
treasury. Another church fair committee,
hearing of this, also asked for a handker
chief, and. getting it, sold it for thirty
dollars. Now, the proper thing in all that
region is to beg a handkerchief from the
White House and sell it. Great are the
financiering capacities of women working
for a sacred cause.
A Kansas woman has been driven to
suicide through brooding over a poem
treating of the woes of life and the bliss
of death. Most of the poetry written is
dismal erough to drive its readers to
crime, but there is no use in taking it se
riously. All young poets, for some un
accountable reason, prefer to write in a
lugubrious strain, and probably the author
of the lines that led the Kansas woman
to the grave were written by some lively
young creature who knew nothing of death
and little of life.
A Paterson (N. J.) woman having aban
doned her husband and nine children, a
New York writer rises to remark that it is
another case of "Nora" in Ibsen's "Doll's
House." Nora walked out of her husband's
house, it will be remembered, because in
side of it her soul did not have room to ex
pand. A house big enough for the old man
and nine children ought to afford room for
the mother's soul. The Paterson man might
have added a mansard.
Frank A. Munsey, of Munsey's Magazine,
who has been amusing himself by buying a
number of newspaper establishments, is go
ing further and buying a string of grocer
ies. Some people aie expressing surprise at
this latest fad, but there is no cause for
wonder, literature, like potatoes, being a
mere matter of coiamerce in these days.
The Virginia Legislature will adjourn
this week for sixty days, but it does not
mean to celebrate Christmas for that
length of time, as some light-minded per
sons might suppose. It is going to spend
the weeks in considering the new Consti
tution. The Muucie man who swallowed a quart
of kerosene with intent to touch it off
with a match and so commit suicide, neg
lected to swallow a wick, and the oil re
fused to Ignite. It is well to gp about these
things with system and intelligence.
Whenever society grows dull people at
the national capital can turn their atten
tion to a murder mystery. The Bonine case
is over, but another unaccountable killing
is provided for their consideration during
the congressional vacation.
The St. Iouls world's fair people have a
Pogue's run to dispose of. They do not call
it a "run;" they call it a river, but it is
about of the tize. disposition and general
conduct of our own erratic tream and is
giving them a good deal of trouble. They
now plan to run it underground for a mile
or so, but the nearer it resembles Pogue's
historic watercourse the less likely it is to
stay where it Is put.
It is to be inferred from Judge D. P.
Baldwin's address to the Purdue students,
printed in another column, that he does not
believe in the doctrine of reincarnation.
Just "one chance and no more" is what he
allows the young man.

it. They were often expressing an acute-
ness of emotion which the man himself
had seldom felt; and women read in them
the sign of an ineffable sympathy. Mar

LITERARY NOTES.
Mr. Hall Calne's son is to edit House
hold Words, and the novelist is writing
for that periodical an article on Rome and
the Pope as he saw them.
Mr. W. D. Nesbit, known to his friends
as the author of the humorous department
of the Baltimore American, now signs his
initials to that column, the preposterous
name, "Josh Wink," which he inherited
with the department, having wisely been
dropped. Mr. Nesbit's witty quips and con
celts are widely copied.
Gilbert Parker, the novelist, dramatist,
and member of Parliament, who has come
over from England, accompanied by his
wife, looks to be in vigorous health. He
fell from his horse last summer and broke
an arm and dislocated an elbow. He re
turned to his work in Parliament too soon,
and was advised by hfs physician that he
needed rest and a change of air. While he
is here he says: "I expect to arrange for
the production of my play, 'The Right of
Way,' for which I have received eight ap
plications. I have not decided where the
play is to be produced, but I incline to the
opinion that Robert Mansfield is best fitted
to take the chief part in the play."
Here is a bit of gossip from Miss Gilder's
pen: "Mr. Howells is in New York, as
usual, thi3 winter, but not in the house
that he bought some months ago. You may
remember having Sven it announced that
Mr. Howells had bought a house up some
where near Riverside drive and waj. at last
going to have a home. Heretofore he had
lived in hotels and apartments in New
York, Eoston, anywhere and everywhere.
But finally he bought a house, with the
Intention of settling down for the rest of
his days. A friend of mine, looking for a
house to rent for the winter, was shown
over one which the agent said belonged to
Mr. Howells. You don't mean Mr. W. V.
Howells?' said my friend. 'Yes.' said the
agent, 'I do.' I thought that he had
bought his house to live in.' 'He thought
so, too,' answered the agent, 'but house
keeping on so large a scale was too much
for Mrs. Howells, who is an invalid, and
so he has put it on the market to rent.' "
This lends rather a pathetic personal in
terest to Mr. Howells's remarks about
stored furniture, in a recent number of
Harper's Magazine.

To the Editor of the Indianapolis Journal:
The "Neighborhood Circulating Library
Club," recently described in an Indianapo
lis newspaper as a novelty imported from
the East, was in successful operation in
New Albany about fifteen years ago, con
ducted by Dr. E. S. Crosier and others, be
fore the establishment of our public library.
At the end of each year the books were
sold at a parlor auction, to the amusement
and benefit of the members of the club.
Also "The Gossip," of Indianapolis Jour
nal, is somewhat in error in the idea that
George Eorrow's books are now neglected.
Public libraries report then ia constant
circulation, and they arc seldom, if ever, j
found in the second-hand book stores. An
admirer of Borrow Glorious George had
an order for "Rommany Rye" placed with
a Cincinnati old book shop more than a
year before the volume was reported from
the dealer.
Can any "Borrowite" inform me what
London publisher was referred to in "La
vengro" as "Glorious John?"
Apropos of George Borrow, his beautiful
description of the planet Jupiter in "La
vengro," Chapter LXX, is just now after
our lovely summer with Jupiter timely and
delightful reading. E. C.

thirty-seven years ago. It Is a red brick
mansion, screened from the road, and the
lease, which has forty-one years to run, is
held direct from the crown. Many persons
thought that Thackeray, when he decided
to build his own house in its own grounds,
was putting too great a strain on his pen.
But events have shown that the specula

sold for $75,000.

HIGH PRICES.
They Mean High Waftes and Fall Em
ployment of Labor.
American Economist.
As a matter of fact, it must be clear to
any man of intelligence that it is due to
the unprecedentedly high wages and full
employment of all labor that prices ad
vance. Commodities would not long show
a high level of values if no one purchased.
This point is clearly shown whenever a
"corner" Is attempted. With the inflated
price there comes restricted buying until
the normal position is regained. During
the years 1S03 to 1S97 prices fell to the low
est point on record because there was no
demand, and the articles unaffected by any
change in tariff were as badly depressed
as those from which the duty had been re
moved, since the buying power was weak
ened by idle workmen. The flood of im
ports that came in at that time has Just
been absorbed. Wool i3 conspicuous in this
class, for it Is only within a month that
revival from low prices has appeared.
To quote the nonpartisan Dun's Review
on Its own Index number:
"The cost of living has now reached the
highest point of the decade, notwithstand
ing the cheapening of many manufactured
goods through improved processes, and the
absence of undue inflation In various
classes of steel products of RX) and brought
about the subsequent severe reaction. No
artificial stimulus is responsible for the
present high level of manufactured food
products due to short crops, the present
position of the Index number may be at
tributed to sound business conditions and
full employment of labor at high wages. In
attaining the highest point for over ten
years, the Index number truly gives an in
dex of national conditions. The cost of the
necessities of life naturally Mends to ad
vance just in proportion to the ability of
the people to consume."
Moreover, in its detailed comparison of
prices, the same authority shows that boots
and shoes now sell at about I) per cent, of
the price of lsitf, finished products of iron
and steel at 73 per cent, of the prices pre
vailing in 1SS7. woolen goods 59 per cent, of
the prices of 1SH and cotton goods C2 per
cent, of the level forty-one years ago. In
other words, while the active demand sus
tains the general level of quotations at a
high point, the very products ot industries
that have been developed by the iniquitous
tariff are obtained at striking concessions.
The late William McKinley promised that
a protected Industry would not only provide
work at good wages for an army of men,
but that in a few years the prices of the
articles produced would be put below the
level prevailing before the enactment of
such helpful legislation. Records prove
that these predictions have been most won
derfully fulfilled, and with true American
energy not only the home market, but for
eign markets are now supplied. In some
cases the development has been slower tnan
in others, and In the weaker Industrie It
i
would bt easy to pretipitat lis.tf-r ! a1

;THE CURIOUS CARMACK.
Tennessee Congrenmnn Said to Be a
Queer (Immrtrr.
New; Orleans Times-Democrat.
Probably the most unique, most original
and ;mo?t picturesque character in the na
tional Congress to-day is the Hon. Edward
W. Carmack, the junior senator from the
Statü of Tennessee. With red. bushy hair,
with heavy well-drooped cyt brows, and
with kindly gray eyes, he looks the fierce
yet gentle character that he is, and there
Is a certain something in the general out
line of the man's jn-rsonal appearance
which will easily give one a clew t. the
character of the man. Carmack is a bundle
of surprises. While amply armed with the
precepts of the wise men who have gone
before, having pored over the sayings of
Jefferson and Jackson, and being a past
master of the science of economics, he is
yet no brooder over past differences, and
is more Inclined to the theory which will
fit the Instant and offer somewhat of
amelioration to those who may be suffering
fronl untoward conditions. Carmack is a
consistent changer of his views and fully
able at all times to justify nnd defend
whatever position ho may assume on a
publje issue. He began to make his Impress
on the political history of Tennesste from
the time he went to the legislature irom
Maury county, in lvi. He Is fiery, erratic,
andjthere ia not in all the woof and warp
of his makeup a single conciliatory element
whei it comes to dealing with men to
throw down the gase of battle. His ad
vent Into Memphis journalism in 1SJ0 intro
duced the South to an editorial hjvitacle
which it had not known cilice the davs at
reconstruction. He scorched the paper he
wro-e on, and the fellow who was game
enough to bristle up to him found :i man
whoj could receive a t-tlng with grat e and
fortitude, and who could and would return
it without mercy. During the present ses
sion of Congress, if he should happen to
unlcosen his tongue in the Senate, the
sleeky and sedate members of this dignified
body will probably snooze In less than their
wonted quiet, for when it comes to bristling
invective and sulphuric vituperation the
Junior senator from Tennessee will have no
equi'l in the national Congress.

Washington Post.
Ja'ines J. McMurray, who had for nearly
a quarter of a century been a familiar fig
ure jUpon the downtown streets of Wash
ington, and who was known to hundreds of
people simply as "Old Mack, the Dog Sell
er," died Thursday afternoon at the Emerg
ency Hospital, of exhaustion. He was sixty
years old, and had been a cripple during
his entire life. II was taken to the hospital
several weeks ago, suffering from the ef
fect of years of dissipation, physical pain,
exposure and disappointment, and he died
with reproaches upon his iips for tho
friends whom he had known :n his better
days, but who, he claimed, had deserted
him in adversity.
During racing weeks he for many years
frequented the lobbies of the hotels where
the horsemen were stopping and enter
tained them with the tricks of his favorito
dog, "Mack," an animal which In; had
trained to recognize figures drawn by him
upon a blackboard and to anmunce them
correctly by barking. In addition to this
pet .he raised terriers In numbers, and for
mary years made his living by celling them
to the racemen and to society people who
happened to fancy them as pots.
M.'Murray was formerly a clerk In the
Treasury Department and was a mathe
matical phenomenon. He was an expert
accountant and was known as the "Llht
enirg Calculator." His salary was per
ycaf, and he made as much more uts-ide
keeping private business accounts. His de
formity, which caused him great pain, and
later an additional burden . of family
troubles, led him to dissipation, and he lost
his position in the department. He con
tinued to keep private accounts and he
gavvj private lessons in bookkeeping. The
polire will try to locate his relatives, but
he has been so reticent about them that
few; persons know of his connections or his
early life. Among the many people who
knew him for years und who saw him day
after day no one remembered his Christian
nan-e. It was finally found in the polica
reccrds.

w'e trust our American wiie men will
uttcr a tremendous howl about the loss of
the contract for the transpacific cable. The
American firm that is to lay the cable has
let jthe contract for the rope itself to an
English concern. Whenever such a con
tract in Europe is let to American bidders,
the jwelkin rings with European protests.
W;e tako it that our Amcrlcin spirit of
fair play will assert itself at this trying
Juncture as at others. We tax German
sugar 2 cents a pound at our ports, but any
tax-Germany lays on our meats is unjusti
fiable. We sock it to French wines and
glofes, but tariffs on our flour going into
France can only be execrated. Russia may
levy indirect sugar bounties t her peril,
but as for her selling anything; here, there
Is the Dingley bill. We have Manila and
fleets to preserve our export trade into
Asia, but if Japan would sell u any tea or
silk or matting, there arc high duties. A
Chinaman may not enter here; on peril of
imprisonment or massacre, but the Pcl-Ho
shall run blood before the hair of an Amer
ican interloper in China shall te harmed.
The same wire that tells that the Eng
lish; are to build an Amerleari cable also
givis news of a million-dollar bridge con
tract in British Africa going to an Ameri
can: firm. It is well. Each transaction Is
for our good as well as for Britain's good.
We shall get the cable sooner than the
American builders could have made it. and
the'; American bridges will beTtady earlier,
and perhaps be better into the bargain,
trail the British could have delivered them.
There are those, alas, who stlli fancy that
we are out and injured by the cable award,
andithat the Africans who buy our bridges
are' tho hapless victim? of cur superior
proivess, to be pitied, perhaps, but certain
ly contemned. So also there are mlmN of

A Man "Without n Conn try.
Washington Post. '
It is no longer "Philip Nolan, but George
L. Wellington, who is tho man without a
country. Wellington is a senator from
Maryland who left the Republican pr.rty
bcciuse he was opposed to the Philippine
policy and because he believed that Presi
dent McKinley had not acted toward him
with proper fidelity. He occupies, however,
the'i peculiar position of being out of the
Republican pirty and yet not fa any dlu r
party. Men liko Senator TelWr and Sena
tor Dubois, who could not agree lth the
Republican policy concerning -silver, have
iKome full-fledged Democrat.". They hit
e.n the Democratic side of the Senate, they
attend tho Demo ratio caucus, they vote
with the Democratic side. Wellington, on
the other hand, sits among the Republicans
but- is not of them. They would not have
hini lit their caucus and they do not enjoy
his 'company. The Democrats are not. ap
parently, making any love to him, o that
it looks" as if lie would have to wand- r all
aloxie to flock by himself, t-o to spvak u.3
lon as he is in the Senate.
In this connection It is interesting to
knew that Senator Wellington nilht b
afforded some new cxpericr.ccs were it not
for the fact that he is to go out of th
Senate. If there were any possibility by
which his re-electlen could be accomplished,
he certainly would be called to task for his
utterances upen the death of President Mc
Kinley. Already quite a number of promi
nent Republican senators have received
copies vt resolutions passed by various
organizations demanding that some action
be Jtaken In Wellington's case, but as his
end! Is In sight, no attention will bo paid to
thete requests.
