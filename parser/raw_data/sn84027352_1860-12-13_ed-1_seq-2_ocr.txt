The ratifications of the treaty with Japan,
concluded at Yeddo on the 2iith of July, 18."8
were exchanged at Washington, on the *2'id of
May last, and th" treaty itself was proclaim
ed in the succeeding day. There is good rea
son to expect that under its protection and
influence our trade and intercourse with that
distant and interesting people, will rapidly in
crease. The ratifications of the treaty were
exchanged with u i usual solemnity. For this
purpose the Tycoon had nccrelited three
ofhis most distinguished Ministers Plenipo
tentiary, who were received nnd treated wtth
markrd distinction and kindness, both by the
Government and people of the U. S. There is
every reason t# believe that they have return

commit their outrages upon American citizens
ith absolute impuniiy. Thus wrote our Min-
isterin )8oH, and expressed the opinion that
nothing but a manifestation of the powers of
the Government and of its purpose to punish
these wrongs would avail. Afterwards, in
1857, came in the adoption of a newconft.tu
tion for Mexico, the union of a President and
a Congress under its provisions, and
auguralionof a President within one short
month, llawever the Presidet I was expelled
from the capital by a rebellion in the army,
and the supreme power of the Republic was
assigned to Gen. Zuloaga. This usurper was
in his turn ieon compelled to retire from the i
place by Gefteral Mirnmon. Under the Con-j
*tituLion which had thu«been adopted, Gen.
Juaret, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
became the lawful President of the Republic,
and it was for the maintenance of the Con«ti- i
tion, and his authority derive I from it, that
the civil war commenced and still continues to
be prosecuted. Throughout the j-ear lHoSthe
Constitutional party grew stronger and stron-|
per. In the previous history of Mexico a sue
xessful military revolution at the capital had I
most universally been the signal forsubmis
eion throughout the Republic.
Not so on the present a majority of the
citizens peisiatent'y rustained the constitu

The temptations which ad valorem duties pre
ient to a dishonest importer are irresistible.

ble nnd energetic efforts of the heads of the purchased the articles abroad. Not so with
fact the operation of this system has already
driven from the pursuits of honorable com
merce many of that class of regular and con
scientious merchants whose character through
out the world is the pride of our country.
The remedy for these evils is to be found in
specific duties, so far as this may be practica
ble. They dispense with any inquiry at the
custom hou?e into the actual cost or value of
the article, and it pays the precise amount of
duty previously fixed by lair. They present
no temptations to the appraisers of foreign
goods, who receive bnt small salaries, and
might, by undervaluation in a few cases, ren
der themselves independent.
Besides, specific duties bett eevform to tfce
reqnisition in the Constitution that "no pre
ference shall be given by any regulation of
commerce or revenue to the ports of one State
over those otanoiher." Under our mittalorem
system such prefcreaces are to same extent
inevitable, and complain s have often bee*
made that the spirit of this provision has beep
violated by a lower appraisement of the aatM
articles at one port than at another.
An impression strangely enough prevails
some extent that specific duties are neceasari*
ly protective duties. Nothing can be more
fallacious. Great Britain glories in free trade
and yet her whele revenue from imports is at
the present moment collected under a system
of specific duties Itisa striking fact in this
because a much larger amount of revenue
would be collected by merely converting the
ad valorem duties of a tariff into equivalent
specific duties. To this extent the revenue
would be increased, and in the same propor
tion the specific duty might be diminished.
Specific duties would secure to the Ameri
can manufacturer the incidental protection to
which he is fairly entitled, under a revenue
tariff, nnd to this surely no one would object.
The framers of the existing tariff have gone
further, nnd, in a liberal spirit, have discrim-
of duty upon the importation of similar arti
cles from abroad, but what is the same in ef
fect, by admitting articles free of duty, which

Had

least for a season. The Postmaster General
had no power to make him any other compen

which he might carry. It was known at the
time, that, these postages would fall far short
of an adequate compensation, as well as of
the sum which the same service had previous

a commendable spirit, was willing to rely
upon the justice of Congress to make up the

an appropriation may be granted for this

—Chicago, already
the largest grain mnrkct in the world, is
steadily adding to its facilities for carrying
on this trade. We notice with pleasure that
Munger & Armour, and Smith and Sturges,
who are among our most experienced and
enterprising houses in this line, are each
building a new Elevator on the
South Branch.
Thesj are to be of the larget class, built in
thc most substantia! manner, and furnish
ed with lli-j best and most approved machin
ery, and are to be completed early in the
spring. Some idea of the immense amount
of grain which may be handled in them,
may be gathered from the fact that they an
to be furnished with near thirty of Fair
banks' 400 bushel and 500 bushel Hopper
Scales, which are by universal consent the
best in use, and that each of these scales, so
perfect will be the machinery, can be loided
to its full capacity, and the grain discharged
again from the IIop{er, in lass than ten min
utes. In view of the immense and fertile
country lyin^ back of us traversed in all di
rections by numerous railroads, having their
centre here, and of our present nnd increas
ing facilities for receiving and shipping grain,
and the experience anil enterprise of our
business men, it is reasonable to expect
Chicago will be in future, now, the great
grain market of the world.
