CAUSES ADVANCE IN
STOCK MARKET LEVEL
Motors and Oils Lead Move
ment. While Transportation
Shares Are Conspicuous.
By BROAD\N WAU
NCW YORK. Dec. S.?President
Harding's message to Congress wan
received with favor In Wall Street
today, hence improvement In the
general 'stock market. His views
t concerning the railroads injected
life Into the transportation shares
for the first time In weeks. Gains
In the general list ranged from 1
to 2 points. Shorts were again
prominent on the buying side, but
Commission houses reported in
creased interest by people who have
been waiting for a reaction on
Which to make purchase*. Motors
and oils were prominent all dayy
Studehaker headed the former group
and Texas Company the latter. In
dustrials were featured with a sharp
upward movement in American Can
that carried it to a new high fig
ure and more than 2 points over
the previous closing.
Commodities were also higher,
both cotton and wheat advancing.
Call money eased off 1 per cent
to where it closed. Sterling ex
change hung a shade under 14.57 s*.
which foreign exchange experts de
cided was the actual high price for
Thursday.
* emanating from semU
Official sources declared that the
tttutz Motors would shortly be ab
sorbed by the Studehaker. The
reports of the proposed amalgama
ti^n ^muTa'cd artivitv in Stutz on
the Curb which has been dormant
lor weeks.
MOTORS.
Motor shares in general did bet
ter on the Stock Exchange. Stude
baker being the leader and ad
vancing about 3 points. A good
ii i.r ???loped for Chandler Mo
ton. although some shorts insist
on sa.wng tnere is some uncer
tainty regarding the next dividend.
Insiders sov the next payment will
bo the regular one.
TOBACCOKS ARE FIRM.
, For the first time in weeks
American Tobacco shares were
prominent for their strength. Al
though companies like Liggett and
Myers and P. Lorillard are expected !
to announce stock dividends people'
Absorbing American Tobacco have}
been doing so with a-view to re
ceiving an extra cash dividend. A
rise of one point occurred in To
bacco Products on announcement
that the sales of cigarettes in the
fjrvt oioven months of this vear in
creased about 65 per cent over the
saitiv petuxt in Current ship
ments are showing further expan
sk>n. The corporation is expected
to report a surplus of about $3,500.
000 for the current year. Tobacco
Products will at the end of this
?lonth receive $3,200,000 in liquid
assets as a result of payment of
the United Retail Stores dividend
and distribution of 342.000 founders'
shares of the 1'nited Retail Candy
stores. Sugar su? ks came forward
because of the cons ant absorption j
of those shares by insiders who j
are unusually optimistic relative to
the outlook for th?* indust-v ? ? r j
year. This speculation Is spreading
to the bond mark-t where *?n ?n-1
ereased inquirv a'?n<-ared for the
ten-vear convert ilile 7 per cent
bonds which are convertible into
stock at 50.
Pullman Company stock acted as
though it Is ready to give a good
account of itself.

XRW YORK, De< x ? A tavorable
in'erpretation of Pre?:dent Handing's
add~? ?s to Concress. In which he
IOcot " "nended aid to agr*e?ilt ur??*s.
together with bullish weeklv statis
tics and better advices on the snot
article f:om the South led to fur
ther gains in cotton todav, but
dealings remained light and gen
erally featureless The C~^??ii?? *>m
. reau's report, which put the quan
tity ginned prior to Decernl*.. 1
this season at 9,318,144 bales, had
little effect. Print cloths at Fall
River, Mass.. were dull, sales for
the week being estimated at less
than 100.000 pieces. The world's
visible supply is 5,460.000 bales, a
decrease of 12,000 bales for the
week. Tie American supply is 3,
9S0.000 bales, a decrease of 46,000
bales for the week.
The supply of contracts was lim
ited throughout the afternoon and
prices made new high ground for
the session and the present re
covery. January rose to 24.87 and
March to 25.05 or 21 to 27 points
net higher and about 70 to 75 points
above the low level touched on the
break of Wednesday morning. Buy
ing. while not broad, was sufficient
to maintain the market dose to the
best levels late in the day. Final
prices showed net gains of 10 to 16
points.

$900,000,000 Spent in
Fraudulent Oil Stocks
ST. LOUIS. Deo. 8.?This year
alone, $?00.<HiO.OOO was spent in 1
drilling. ."Wild-cattin*" and similar!
activities in oil fields and next year
.at least as much will be sp. nl for
similar purposes. J. C. Donnell, pres
dent of the Ohio Oil Company, said
tonight.
He said that while there is un
doubtedly too much oil being pro
duced for current needs, consutnp
tlon continues to expand and the
character of a large part of the
current production makes It un
wrtain the present big yield will
continue for a grrat length of time.
Flush flowing wells, he said, con
stituted the bulk of crude oil sup
plied.

What do you think of this?
Yesterday I received tbe follow
in* from a leading manufactu
rer in the south, who vouchea for
. the truth of the story:
"Here is a good one: The Bap
tiata of Sooth Carolina are hold
ing their annual- convention in
Sock Hill this week. One of the
preachers is stopping at J. C.
Hardin's. He has one of your
booka, Torbea' Programs.' The
preacher has been reading it re
llgiouely. and yesterday Mr.
Hardin asked him how he liked
it. His reply waa: 'Fine. It la
the beat hook I ever read. I al
ways aaid old Henry Ford had
aome sense.'"
Sewetary Mellon continues to
function aa noiselessly and a^
effectively as a Rolls-Ro>ce. He
carries through gigantic financial
operations, running into the hun
dreds of millions of dollars, with
out causing a ripple in the
money market and without dis
turbing the even flow of business
in the slightest degree.
His language in his annual re
port to Congress, iaaued thi?
week, is just aa quiet aa be is
himself?and goaa equally to the
point. The country is doing
quite well, thank you, he de
clares. And what is equally
cheering to over-burdened tax
payers, he declares that there is
no need for imposing a single
new tax levy. Not only an. btr.
he atrongly urges that the maxi
mum surtax be reduced from 60
per cent to 26 per cent on the
ground that this lower rate
would actually bring in larger
revenue because the present e*
ceaaive surtaxes have driver
wealthy people into investing
their funds in tax-exempt secur
ties.
In these days of unbalanced
budgets all over the face of the
earth, it is encouraging to knov
that the Treasury figures that
America will have a surplus in
come next year equal to the de
ficit of the current rear.
The United States is still sol
vent, make no mistake abou
thit.

Are you modern and progressive
enough to know that it is considered k
disgrace to be a spendthrift? There is
nothing picturesque in wasting one's
money?only foolishness and lack of
character. The modern man saves his
extra dollars, invests them, reinvests the
interest and further savings, and is ulti
mately a man of position and stability.

ment for hard-earned savings. Unfluc
