THE COLUHBIAN, HOLIDAY EDITION.
WASHINGTON.
From our Keitular Correspondent.
Washington, Dec, loth, 1S97.
Secretary Gage is about the only
iiiumuLi ui me auministraiion who
would really like to see his recommen
dations for cinching the hold of the
Bingle gold standard on this country
Decome laws. mr. Mcrunley did not
dare to endorse the recommendations
of his Secretary of the Treasury, and
he has no real desire for the financial
legislation he half-heartedly suezested.
He knows that his roundabout sugges-
lion, 01 getting riu ot the greenbacks
by turning them into gold certificates
could not get through Congress, even
if only the republicans voted upon it.
He was afraid that the recommenda
tions for amending the National bank
ing laws, so as to reduce taxation on
National Bank currency, to allow cur
rency to be issued to the face value ol
the bonds deposited with the govern
ment, and to allow the establishment
of National banks with $25,000 capi
tal in small places, might get through,
so he added a proviso that he knew
would kill the whole to make all
National bank notes redeemable in
gold. The administration is simply
trying to bluff a portion of its own
party and 'he country. It doesn't
want any financial legislation. This
has already been made plain in the
House by the grab-game engineered
by Mr. Dingley by which his commit
teeWays and Means will take
charge of all financial bills and
smother them. Republicans have al
so plainly indicated by their talk that
they had received intimations from
the administration that no financial
legislation was wanted. If public
criticism of its attitude makes its
necessary to strengthen its bluff, the
administration will, through Mr. Ding
ley, fix up a bill and jam it through
the House, knowing that the Senate
would not act upon it. Of course,
the people ot this country are fools
enough not to know the difference
between this sort of thing and real
statesmanship, and they will be so
sorry that the administration isn't able
to get what it doesn't want so sorry
that they'll elect a democratic Con
gress next year.
The administration doesn't wish
the Nicaragua Canal question to be
acted upon by this Congress, and
when Mr. McKinley said in his mes
sage that he would have something
further to say on the subject when he
admitted the report of the Commis
sion which has just started for Nicar
agua to make a new survey and esti
mate of cost, under an act of Con
gress, he was fully aware that the com
mission was not likely to make a re
port before the death of 4he Fifty
fifth Congress. In fact, it is known
that members of the commission were
given a broad hint hefore their depart
ure that their report was not expect
ed before March 4, 1S99.
One Nebraska republican Mr.
Winfield S. Strawn, an Omaha lawyer
-has turned up in Washington who
is honest enough to publicly say that
the republicans have no chance to
carry that Stite, either at the Con
gressional elections next year or the
National election of 1900. Mr.
Strawn says the republicans have not
been able to get back the farmer
votes they lost on the silver question,
and that they are not likely to get
them back so long as that question is
unsettled.
With the exception of Senators
Morgan, of Ala., and Gorman, of Md.,
every democratic Senator is now lined
up against the annexation of Hawaii,
and the opposition among the repub
licans already includes Senators Hoar,
Morrill and Pettigrew. This makes
it impossible to procure the two-thirds
vote needed to ratify the treaty pro
viding for annexation, and the repub
licans are already seriously thinking of
abandoning the treaty and trying to
secure annexation by majority legisla
tion. It looks a little as though the
annexation question was going to be
used by the Reed machine to whack
McKinley over the head. The Czar
is understood to have privately an
nounced himself to be opposed to
annexation. In fact, present indica
tions are that before this session has
grown very old the line between Mc
Kinley republicans and Reed republi
cans will be sharply drawn.
If Spain isn't entirely pleased with
the situation at the Washington end
of the line she must be hard to please.
It was a new thing for a President of
the United States to devote nearly
half of his message to Congress to an
argument in favor of allowing a for
eign nation more time in which to try
to squeeze the life out of the people
residing in sight of our coast, and the
innovation was nauseous to many. A
dose equally nauseous followed, when
Secretary Gage presented several
columns of solid newspaper matter,
giving .in detail the extraordinary
efforts of this country to aid Spain by
suppressing filibustering. Senator
Allen offered a resolution in the Sen
ate for the recognition of Cuban inde
pendence, but it is feared that the
Committee on Foreign Relations, to
which it was referred, will pigeon-hole
it.

Speculative Markets Show More Strength
Bitter Demand For Iron and Steel Pro.
duett and Advance In Securities.
R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review
of trade says :
The opening of congress, with the
president's annual message and re
ports, has not discouraged business,
as some predicted, but all speculative
markets are stronger than a week ago.
The productive industries, even in the
season usually about the dullest of
the year as to new orders, meet a
definite improvement in demand for
important products, presumably the
fruit ot a prevailing conviction that
new business will begin to crowd the
works after the new year starts.
1 he outward movement of wheat
and other products continues so
heavy that foreign exchange has fallen
three-quarters of a cent, and instead
ol exports of gold which h.-ive marked
uecemDer in recent years, imports
would come if gold were wanted.
Securities are advancing by reason
of the increased earnings of railways,
$47,085,801 for November on report
ing roads in the United States, 16.8
per cent, larger than last year and 5.9
larger than in 1892.
A sudden rise in December wheat
at Chicago to $1.09 would do harm
were it not based on avowed contracts
to ship some millions of bushels to
Europe. That fact and the continu
ed foreign demand in spite of such
contracts, has helped a rise of
cents here. The report that western
supplies are running low is discredited
by receips from farms.
Cotton is a sixteenth stronger in
spite of estimates ranging from 10,-
100,000 to 11,009,000 bales by well
known authorities. A strike in En
glish mills' is no longer threatened,
and the possibility of one at Fall
Kiver nas nine weignt.
There is more demand tor iron and
steel products in preparation for rail
way work, bridges and buildings next
year and on contracts for export, in
cluding one for a government bridge
in Holland, others for bridges in
Japan, with large shipments of various
products to England and other conn
tries. Foreign contracts for 40,000
tons rails are pending, 15,000 for
Mexico.
In and about New York bridge and
building contracts call tor 25,000
tons, and Chicago works are figuring
on numerous contracts for 5,00a rail
way cars.
Ihe formation of the American
steel and wire company is expected to
strengthen prices and cause some
buying. While Bessemer at $10 and
gray forge at $9.15 are slightly lower
at Pittsburg, prices are stronger at
Chicago and in all quarters heavy busi
ness is expected after the new year.
Connellsville coke production is
1 5 1. 1 00 tons weekly against 149,000
in November and no advance is now
expected above $10.50 for furnace
coke early next year. Anthracite
coal is weaker and sells here at $3-75
to $3.85 for stove.
Failures in the first week of Decem
ber were but $2,617,240, manufactur
ing $379.40 and trading $i,79I57o
Failures for the week have been 3 1 2
in the United States against 380 last
. . i-
year and twenty-nine m uanaua
against forty-three last year.

STATE AP?KOFlATION.
The distribution of the State an
propriation for school purposes will
be on a new kisi next vear. Sunrrin
tendent Schaeu'or announces that it is
a matter that effects every school dis
trict in the State the new law gov
erning the distribution of the State an
propriation. The appropriation here
tofore was distributed on a basis of
the number of taxable residents. Com
mencing next year the appropriation
will be distributed on a basis of the
number of resident taxables and of
children between the uses of 6 and 16
years. Dr. Schaeffer, superintendent
of public instruction, admonishes
School directors to See that the rrf nrn
made to the county commissioners by
me assessors are correct, a3 after the
returns made bv assessors have heen
certified by the county commissioners
iu ute siaie department and the ca .
dilations for distribution of the appro
priations begun, it will be too late to
make corrections for the current ve.tr.
The new law provides that on and
after June 1, 1898, one third of the
money annually appropriated for the
common schools shall be distributed
on the basis of the number rf tiswl
teachers regularly employed ; that one
third of the appropriation shall be dis
tributed on the basis of the number
of children of school age, between
tne ace ol 6 and 16. the remaining
one-third of the appropriation shall be
uisinuuieo on tne basis of the num
ber of taxables as returned bv the
last bi-ennial assessment. The law
makes it the duty of the county or
ward assessor to make an enrollment
of the total number of children of
school age, between the age of 6 and
16 years, in addition to the duties
required of them under existing laws
and for the compensation rjer diem
now allowed by law. The returns or
assessments are to be filed m the
office of the county commissioners.

Blow at Fake Contests.
The postoffice department at Wash
ington is taking a firm stand against
the so-called "missing letter" and
"missing word" contests which are
being conducted by a number of pub
lishers to increase the subscriptions
to their papers. The lottery law di
rects that the postmaster eeneral.
upon evidence satisfactory to himself
that a concern or person is operating
through the mails a lottery or scheme
of regular prizes dependent upon lot
or chance, to prohibit the delivery of
all mail matter to it. Missing letter
contests are held to be such violations,
because many correct answers can be
given, but only one list is deemed to
be the "correct list by the promoters
of the scheme. The chance consists
in guessing what words compose the
so-called "correct list." Such schemes
are held to be especially obnoxious,
owing to the skillful wording of the
advertisements, which make the
chance for obtaining a prize more re
mote than in the deiunct Louisiana
lottery.
Glass Workers' Troubles.
Manufactures Demand Concessions on Shop
Rulos.
The window glass workers and
manufacturers of Pittsburg, are again
in conference over the shop rules. It
is difficult to predict the result, but
it is safe to say the workmen must
concede something, if an agreement
is reached. President Burns express
ed himself strongly respecting the
implied threat that if the concessions
demanded were not made the Ameri
can Window Glass Company would
cease to manufacture and import.
Burns threatens to appeal to Congress.
The cutters and ilatteners, having
already left the Window Glass Work
ers Association, will now leave the

selves with the American I ederation

An act which may be ol interest to
constables, as well as others, was
passed by the last legislature relative
to torest hres. It provides that town
ship constables shall become ex
otficio fire wardens, f-om Tan. i. 1808.
They are equipped to take the neces
sary measures for extinguishing forest
fires in their townships, and for this
purpose are authorized to call on anv
person or persons in the township for
aid. While thus engaged, they are to
receive fifteen cents an hour, one
half to be paid by the county and one-
half by the state ; but no county is re
quired to pay more than Icoo in anv
one year. The constables are to make
return, at each term of court, of any
Violations known to them, of any pro
vision of law for the protection of
forests from fire. For a neglect of
duty a constable mav be susnended
from office, or convicted and sen-
tenced to a fine not exceeding $50,
or an imprisonment not exceeding
three months, or both. Anv nerson
refusing to assist the constable, when
summoned, without reasonable cause,
is liable to a fine not exceeding $10.
or imprisonment not exceeding thirty
days, or both. The word "forest,"
for the purpose of the act, is to include
an area of timber or brush land of
not less than fifty acres, or a smaller
area which may, by proximity to
another tract of at least fifty acres,
be liable to communicate fire to it.
Carroll D. Wright, chief of the bu
reau of statistics, recently discussed
the question whether women are hurt
ing the chances of men in business.
"From tables based on the United
States Censuses of 1870, 1880, 1890."
says Wright, "it is found that the pro
portion of women laboreis, all the oc
cupations of the country being con
sidered, is gradually increasing, not to
an alarming extent, but yet steadily,
the gain being a little less than three
per cent. The census ot 1S70 record
ed but one architect among the women
of this country, while twenty-two were
found in 1890. There were no women
among the chemists, assayers, and
metallurgists in 1870, while the enu
meration in 1890 found forty six en
gaged in these occupations. There
were sixty-seven clercv women in
1870 and 1,235 in 1890. Dentistry
has also attracted women, and while
there were but twenty-four m 1870,
there were 337 in 1890. The fact is
absolutely demonstrated that the pro
portion ot females in all occupations
followed is gradually increasing. A
study of all the facts shows that women
are more generally taking the places
of children than of men. In 1870
the percentage of children of the whole
number of persons employed in manu
facturing was 5.58, while in 1890 the
percentage was only 2.68. There need
not be any alarm, therefore, as to the
encroachments of women upon the
occupations held by men, for, on the
whole, the encroachment is slicrht.
Very many reasons are given by em
ployers for their employment of women
in place ot men, the most common
being their greater adaptability for
the particular work for which they
are employed. Many employers also
consider them more reliable, more
easily controlled, cheaper, more tem
perate, more easily procured, neater.
more rapid, more industrious, more
careful, more polite, less liable to
strike, and more easily to learn. Of
course very many employers gives a
combination of two or more of these
reasons. The facts relative to woman's
compensation show that there is pro
gress in her favor, although the sta
tistics bring out a very great economic
injustice in this respect. In one in
vestigation it was shown that in 1871
instances in which men and women
worked at the same occupation, and
performed their work with the same
degree of efficiency, men received
greater pay in 595 cases and women
greater pay in only 129, which in only
fifty-seven instances out of the whole
number did they receive the same
pay for the same work, which is only
7.3 per cent, of the cases noted."
Wyoming and Utah have laws accord
ing to men and women equal wages
for equal work.

Several months ago two suck in
dividuals were in Milton soliciting
orders for a patent asbestos pot which
they said retailed at $1.00. Their
scheme was to get an advance of fifty

buyer never heard of them again. We
