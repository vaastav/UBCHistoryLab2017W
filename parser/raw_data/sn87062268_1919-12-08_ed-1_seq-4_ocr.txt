- THE NATION'S SIUPPIXG POLICY.
The government now owns something more than
i.200 ships. Some of these are splendid vessels;
others were- emergency craft, built because they
could be got quick, and these cannot be economically
operated, nor do they fit Into properly balanced
merchant marine, according to The Manufacturers'
Record, which In an article appearing In the current
Issue discusses the Nation's Shipping Policy, In its
relation to the south. - - ,
The Manufacturers Record says : "The government
fleet3 were brought Into being under war legisla
tion, which appeared as riders on appropriation bills,
and this legislation provides for the disposal or the
fleet within sis; months after the proclamation of
ppace by the president. But there is earlier legis
lation, that 'under which the shipping board was
created, which provides for a tenure of five years
after peace is declared, and there Is. nothing to pre
vent me presniem irom aisposmg" or me war
fleets by turning them over to. the shipping board.
The necessity for the sale of the vessels within six
months, therefore, is technical only and can be read
ily overcome.
The Green bill, which passed the house by an
overwhelming vote, is thought by some of the best
advised senators merely to restate an assignment
of power already existing in the president. It does
cot represent a solution of the problem.
In the senate a number of bills have been pre
sented by Mr. Jones of Washington. A feature of
the Jones program Is a lease of vessels to corpora
tions, such as those which have recently begun to
operate from southern ports, until such time, lim
ited, as these corporations have been able to develop
sufficient business to enable them to stand on their
own bottoms, when the vessels they have can be
purchased outright by them 'on liberal terms. .
What the southern ports are asking for, "as we
understand it, is not government ownership, but
the Incorporation , in any legislation of provisions
which will permit leasing -under terms- similar to
those now obtaining until such time as the new
routes being developed have strengthened.
We stand with them on such a proposition, and
we believe that congress will do so. likewise. It
would be sheer madness to throw away the rich
national asset which men of brains and vision,.not
only in the South, but all along the cost, are
manifesting In opening up new' trade" routes and
.reaching into new territory where American man
ufacturers can dispose of their products. And so
would it be madnessto formulate a shipping, policy
so stringent that the financial resources -of the
new companies would be unable to meet Jthe re
quirements. Sound business sense requires a policy
of construction, not a program of ruin. - '
It Is. unfortunately, true that the theory of pap
has long held sway In the South. Washington was
looked to as an Aladdin's lamp, which need only
be rubbed to bring prosperity to any-community.
That is a policy of subservience. It has only been
a few months since the. cotton growers discarded
their old havit of begging for decent prices, began
relying on themselves, and undertook to fight their
own battles. ' The taste of victory has come into
their mouths. ' - . :
The uses to which Liberty Bonds can be put are
legion. We do not know that it would require
considerable prestidigitation to make some of those
held in the South liquid capital for the promotion
; of enterprise. ; But not by an appeal to sentiment.
s We advise no man to give up a government bond for
a bond of some corporation for sentimental reasons.
But where great trade developments are under way
and a citizen may use the capital he has accumulated
in the form of Liberty , bonds to share in such de
velopment, helping not only his own locality, but
having more than a reasonable ..nance also to reap
reward for his faith and judgment, then there Is no
necessity for burying Liberty bonds in the cellar
and encasing them in cement.
The South needs great, aggregations of . capital.
"it needs to divert 4ts many tiny sireams of wealth
ulate in joyous enterprise of it3 own, a kind of spec
ulation which all men approve.
One of the great assets of the South la its ports.
They have ben too long neglected. They are their
hlnterland3 mouths of sustenance. We believe,
therefore, that if these ports will present their ease
to congress in a broad-minded but tenacious way,
not asking to be given anything, but urging the
formulation of a policy which will permit the. de
velopments they have begun, without undue bur
dens, they will find the national legislature to be
willing and ready to co-operate, Bui the goal al
ways should be ultimate purchase and complete
financial independence for the various companies
and corporations which now require some help In
their development work.
individuals, wish to take part In the campaign, the
Red Cross will heartily approve of their doing so.
A ST. PETERSBURG WAIL. -
Says the St. Petersburg Independent: . "Lard is
all right in Its place, but its place Is not a' trunk
that is sent as baggage on a railroad car. . Yet,
there are many persons coming to Florida with
lard and other semi-liquid and liqnld foods In their
trunks." . , j

understanding that may arise in the minds ' of the
public, it is necessary that a clear definition of the
Red Cross position should be made. It is - already
evident that such misunderstanding does exist.
People In the country see in 'tire newspapers and in
advertising the name: of . the Red Cross associated
with this campaign, and they inevitably jump to
the conclusion that the Red Cross has no sooner con
cluded one campaign than it is inaugurating another.
This is not the case. ,." ;
The National Tuberculosis association has'for some
years been carrying on this sale of Red Cross Christ-;
mas -seals with the consent of the American Red
Cross. When the question came up for considera
tion this year, the Red Cross felt that it was for the
advantage of both organizations that the right to
carry on the campaign this year should not be de
nied. It is clear that the American Red Cross is
vitally interested In 'the success of the National
Tuberculosis' association. It is the strongest or
ganization of its kind in" the country, and its work
has been of inestimable benefit in the efforts toward
a solution of a very, serious' health situation. That
being the case, the American Red Cross is eager that
the National Tuberculosis association shall be ; suf
ficiently financed, and as a consequence approves
of this campaign and hopes sincerely for its suc
cess. On the other , hand it should be made perfectly
clear that . the Red Cross Is . not officially conduct
