A FIERCE fight over the tariff seems
inevitable. Congress hasn't much else
to do.
REPUBLICANS and Democrats go to the
polls to vote the Mugs go there to
wump.
GEORGE WILLIAU CURTIS IS displeased
with the Benton affair, and intimates
that he will not "wump" for Cleveland
next time.
IF Mage Edwards would set his little
dash editorials in that new crazy tvpe
he uses in his ad columns, the lunacy
of the Argus would be completely estab
lished—or words to that effect.

PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S message will
be found in full in this issue. It is a
lengthy document full of interest to all.
The three principal topics now before
the country—the tariff, the cause of the
workingmen and civil service are
touched upon carefully and conscien
tiously.
Nor satisfied with the failure of his
original "hand bill" scheme in this city,
H, P. Hall has sent another printer
hero to revive the late defunct Star. A
Mr. Driebert is the victim this time, and
after looking the field over he has con
cluded-not to embark in Hall's "patent
foreclosure" scheme. We learn that
Mr. Hall has contracted to print the
foreclosure notices in over one hundred
mortgage sales in this region. At the
legal rate the printer's fee on these 100
notices will amount to over $2000. Mr,
Hall proposes t" compel the proprietors
of established newspapers to do the
work for a mere song or he will put his
"hand-bill patent" in operation. People
who are borrowing money upon their
farms should refuse to patronize the
brokers who make foreclosure contracts
with Hall. Tins new St. Paul method
of bleeding the people of the northwest
and robbing the local publishers should
be knocked on the head wherever it is
put into operation. The 375 publishers
of bona fide newspapers in Dakota are
especially interested.
THERE appears to be a premeditated
effort on the part of the newspaper
fiends at Washington to scare the post
master of this city to death one minute
and making him feci happy the next
something like a man being dipped al
ternately into hot and colli water. Ilcnr

Hansbrough, postmaster at Devils
Lake and proprietor of the INTER-OCEAN,
is likely to retire from office this week.
In wine way he has excited the ani
mosity of the Dakota Democrats to a
great degree, and they have been laying
for his scalp persistently.
Grand Forks Herald Telegram.
From all that can be learned in re
spect to the rumored changes contem
plated in the Dakota land offices and
principal postoffices, except perhaps
Mitchell, it is safe to say now that there
will be no changes during the session of
congress at least. This applies to
Grand Forks, Devils Lake, Redfield and
a few other places.
Fargo Argus Grapevine.
It is believed that a successor to Post
master Hansbrough will be appointed
this week.
THE GOVERNOR'S SUGGESTION.
Gov. Pierce, in his report to the sec
retary of the interior, suggests that con
gress should make an appropriation to
aid in the construction of the capitol
and other buildings. The governor
states that similar appropriations nave
been made for other states while they
were territories, and remarks that "Da
kota has expended a large sum in this
direction, for a young community, the
total outlay being upwards of a million
doilars."
While there is not the least danger of
congress making an appropriation such
as the governor suggests, it may not be
inappropriate to remind his excellency
that when congress does make an ap
propriation of the kind and for the pur
pose mentioned, it must be after the
people of Dakota have had an opportu
nity to say where their capital shall bS
located. The governor was not a Dako
tan when the monstrous fraud known
as the capital commission was organ
ized in the interest of a real estate spec
ulation. He was not in Dakota when
the corrupt job, to perform which this
commission was selected,.was consum
mated. He was not in Dakota when
the schemers and their ring organs re
peatedly promised—and called atten
tion to their "high political standing"
us an earnest of their pledges—that the
Bismarck capital should not cost the
people of Dakota a cent, but that these
political patriots, the schemers afore
said, would buy the site, put up the
building, and present it to the territory
free gratis. A great many things tran
spired in Dakota prior to the coming of
Gov. Pierce with which he should famil
iarize himself if he expects to remaiu in
Dakota and take part in politics. A
gieat many people who were in Dakota
when the capital commission egg was
laid and hatched remember these
things. A fearful "snow storm" over
took some of the old schemers early in
November last. Were they on earth
now (politically) they would be delight
ed to see a congressional or legislative
appropriation to finish the capitol they
would even undertake to superintend
the expenditure of that appropriation,
free gratis, the same way they agreed
to complete the Bismarck capitol and
present it to the people.
THE CHEERFUL CHINOOK.
Weather prophets, in predicting great
storms for the rest of the world, muft
make calculations for the Devils Lake,
Big Coulee, Turtle mountain and Mouse
river region, which will admit of proba
ble changes in the temperature and pos
sible surprises to the prophets. For in
stance, the prediction that a most ter
rific snow and wind siorm would occur
throughout the county early in Decem
ber, was fulfilled in the more frigid and
disagreeable latitudes (Minnesota, Wis
consin, Iowa, etc.). Indeed, the
ragged edge of what must have been a
inid-winter cyclone hung about this re
gion two or three days of last week, bu»
during the afternoon of Saturday the
ever-welcome cliinook wind com ni enced
blowing from the west, and upon our
snow banks it had the effect of the
breath of a blast furnace. The mercury
went up to 20° above by 6 p. m. Sun
day morning the clouds had disap
peared, the sun came out warm and the
snow melted away from the sidewalks.
These chinook zephyrs have continued
during most of the week, and there is a
fear expressed that the snow may en
tirely disappear. The man who will
invent a means of bottling our chinook
winds can make a fortune selling them
to the people of the frost-bitten east.
JOHN SMITH.
The Way He Looks at Tilings in
Washington.
WAshINGTON, Dec. 6.—The congres
sional windmill commenced to revolve
again today. There were many smil
ing faces in the house, and many sad
ones. The saddest of the sad, despite
his efforts to appear happy as the rest,
was Col. Morrison of Illinois. lie has
struck the downgrade and is on the ex
press. He is past sixty years of age, is
as gray as a badger, and seems to have
lost all ambition and soul. His defeat
was crushing. lie not only loses his
seat in congress, but he also loses his
chances for the vice-presidential nomi
nation of his party in'88. Col. Morri
son will never revise or tinker with the
tariff again. His days are numbered,
seemingly.
A. £. Stevenson, the first assistant
postmaster general, is an Illinois man,
and will be the vice-presidential nomi
nee on the Democratic ticket in 1888.
He is an exceedingly popular gentle
man, and is already almost unanimous
ly spoken of for that place.
Senator McMillan, of Minnesota, has
a Dale countenance, which seems just
now wreathed in thought of a personal
nature. It seems to be generally be
lieved that he will not be re-elected, but
that ex-Gov. Davis of that state will suc
ceed him. McMillan is one of the best
men in the world, and his retirement
will be in the nature of a great public
loss.
Delegate Gifford is one of the smiling
fellows in the l»nse. He has made his
calling and election sure for another
term, and ought to be happy, despite
the rcductiuu in his majority. Commit
teeman Day must have run over the
territory like a scared rabbit, he went
so fast and so far. He and Gifford are
the best of friends, and Gifford is said to
be urging Day's appointment to the gov
ernorship of the territory. Day doesn't
seem to be taking much interest in the
question of the governorship, but who
ever imagines that he is sleeping is aw
fully mistaken. Day is a tireless work
er. In the present fight he has the
president against him, and the president
has the giving of the office yet you
need not be surprised if you hear of the
appointment of Day at any time. But
the chances are against him almost
unanimously. There is no doubt that
the president has promised the office to
Judge Church, and there are many
people who say that the judge would
not only make a good governor but that
the people of the territory would he glad
to receive him in that position.
McManima, of Pierre, is here in the
interest of the Dawes bill for the open
ing of the Sioux reservation. He works
very hard for it, and works intelligently
and with a great measure of success
Concerning the governorship, he says
"I never believ in compromises of any
kind. Whenever tliere is a controversy
one of the men is right aDd the other is
wrong. The right ought to win. There
should be no compromise. The people
voted in a Democratic administration
Therefore the administration should be
Democratic. But if the president is
willing to have a Republican governor
hold on in Dakota that is his own busi
ness it is his own weakness. Pierce,
however,is neither Republican nor Dem
ocrat. I do not believe in compromis
ing on a mugwump, no matter how big
his mug or loud bis wump. If we can
not have a straight Republican governo
we should have a Democrat. Therefore
we should have a change speedily,
believe that Day would make us good
governor. He is a worser and is inter
ested in the territory. Everybody likes
him except a few kickers °in bis own
party."
Mr. Nave, of Woonsocket, came here
ostensibly to work for Day. But he has
been busy working up a case for his own
appointment to the special agency of
the Huron land district. Day says noth
ing except in praise of Nave. But you
and I know that Day is no fool. We
can only guess what he thinks. We
might gueBs wrong.
Ordway Johnson came here to work
for Day. It is alleged that he has been
working for Church or Orendorf. I do
not believe it. He has been with Day
nearly all the time, and has been cer
tainly sharing his confidence,
DOLLARS AND CENTS.
Treasurer Jordan Submits His Report to
the Secretary of the Treasury.
WASHINGTON CITY, Dec-, 6.—The United
States treasurer has submitted to the secre
cretary of the treasury his animal report,
from which it appears that the net receipts
of the government during the year ended
June Mi, were 1836,439,727, and the net ex
penditures 243,483, W8. The excess of rev
enue over expenditures were 93,950,589. The
net receipts for the last fiscal year over those
of 1885 are (30,493,817. The receipts on ac
count of the poatofflce department, not in
cluded in the above statement, amountei to
(52,997,13ft, an increase of (5,687,399 over
those of the preceding year the expenditures
increased from (50,$26,314 in 1885 to 150,682,
585 in 1886, or «&6,U71. Bonds of the United
States amounting to (44,531,350 were re
deemed and applied to the sinking fund.
Coupons from bonds of the United States
amounting to $7,557,4i2 were paid by the
assistant treasurers. Interest amounting to
43,498,687 was paid on registered bonds of
the United States, including the bonds issued
to the various Pacific railruad companies.
Coupons from 3.65 per cent bonds of the
District of Columbia amounting to (105,441
and registered interest amounting to $416,448
were paid.
Of bonds held in trust for national banks
(61,043,000 wore withdrawn, of which
a ount (56,925,30(1 was held to secure circu
lation, and (4,117,100 was held as security
for deposits of public moneys. The bonds de
posited to replace those withdrawn on ac
count of circulation amounted to (20,754,000,
and on account of deposits to $6,110.000, a
total decrease of (34,117,500. The total move
ment of bonds held for notional banks was
(87,967,300.
Worn and mutilated United States notes
amounting to (03,000,000 were redeemed dur
ing the year. The issue of silver certificates
was (4,800,000 and (28,523,071 were re
deemed. Gold certificates amounding to
$10,188,895 were redeemed.
The unavailable funds of the treasury
June 30, 1W6, were (39,521,397, a decrease of
(3,944 from last year. The balance in the
treasury at the close of the year ended Sept.
30, 1886, was (100,055,775, an increase over
that of 188.S af (16,815,636. The
avnilable balance was (73,9 S,l41 against
(58.922,191 last year, an increase of (13,990,
949. The treasurer suggests that the large
sumE held by mints and assay offices be
placed in the actual custody of the treasury,
and the duties of the mint officers be confined
to the assaying and coinage of the bullion
placed in their charge.
The total amount of United Statas notes
outstanding is (346,681,016. The amount of
silver certificates nominally outstanding a
the close of the fiscal year was (115,977,67A,
of which amount the treasury held (37,801,
450, leaving (88,116,325 in actual circulation,
a decrease of (13,414,721 during the year.
This amount has since been added to by tlie
demands of business so that the amount in
circulation Nov. 30 was £105,619,817. There
is now io circulation (bl ,761,448 in silver
dollars.
THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.
Report of the Commissioner of tli» Gen
eral Land Office.
WASHINGTON CITY, Dec. The area
of public lands disposed of during the last
fiscal year and the receipts from the same,
as compiled from the report of the commis
sioner of the general land office, aro as fol.
lows: At cash sales, 4,789,016 acres home
stead, timber culture, and other entries. 1*,
693,800 Indian lands disposed of 1,133,506.
Total absorptions, JM,614,419 acres. Deduct
from this previous entries not completed,
1,988,319 acres. Net absorption, 33,320,099
acres. The cash receipts from this were
(9,031,084, of which (1,607,729 belongs to the
Indian tribes.
The secretary reflects severely upon the
operations of the government survey of lands
and says:
The commissioner'3 report upon tbe public
surveys, though interesting, is a painlul ex
hibit. It appears from the document that
the available agricultural land, in most of the
{argely
mblic land states and territories has been
returned as surveyed, and the sur
veys paid for by the United States, but in
many instances the reported surveys aro so
defective and eironeous as to bo without
merit and misleading and that in otber
cases no actual surveys were made, but plats
were manufactured upon the basis of ficti
tious field-notes. Others in which the topo
graphy represented upon the plats was en
tirely out of correspondence with the feat
ures of the country, some streams being
represented where none exist and others as
flowing in tbe wrong direction.
The secretary renews bis suggestions as to
tlie repeal of the pre-emption and timber
culture laws, and modification of the present
desert land act.
The secretary also denounces at great
length the custom once prevalent of fencing
in the public lands for the benefit of the cat
tle men, and also the hocus pocus by which
certain grazers caa, by acquiring titlo to all
lands having streams or springs, bold posses
sion of .housands and thoasands of acivs,
rendered valueless to the settlers because tbe
water rights have been seized by the en
croacher.
Only Awaiting Appropriations.
WASHINGTON CITY, Dec. 0.—Die secretary
of war in his report referring to the matter
of defense against invasion says: "Wo have
no gun now which can stop the progress of
or do any material injury to a well-armored
ship The manufacture of a gun is a work
of time, and can not be extemporized when
wanted. Torpedoes may be quickly created,
but still time and money are needed for their
construction. It has been said by a well
informed writer on the subject that it is a
matter of doubt if we have on hand enough
cables and cases to control with torpedoes
the channels past Sandy Hook alone. The
work has been thoroughly considered and
laid out, and the engineer and ordnance
corps of the army are ready to begin, and
only wait for the appropriations from con-
The Sundry Civil BUI.
WASHINGTON CITY, Dec. 6.—Tbe sub
committee of the house committee on appro
priations having in charge the sundry civil
bill has completed the measure. It appro
priates (19,008,840 which is (12,523.000 less
than the estimates, (3,656,000 less than the
appropriation for the current year, and
(2,045,000 less than the aggregate of tho ap
propriations made by the bill as reported to
the house at the last session.
Without an Appropriation.
WASHINGTON CITY, Dec. N—It is likely
that tbe government printing office will be
without an appropriation for some timo yet,
although Public Printer Benedict has ap
peared before the committee oil appropria
tions and urged action on an emergency ap
propriation. The delay is owing to the sec
retary of the treasary not having transmitted
his estimates on the subject to tho com
mittee.

ASSEMBLING OF THE SECOND SESSION
OF THE FORTY-NINTH CONQRE83.
The President's Message Read to Both
Houses—Sew Members Sworn In—The
Report of Treasurer Jordan—The Pub
lic Domain—Miscellaneous Motes from
the National Capital.
WASHINGTON CITY, Dec. The scenes
usually incident to the assembling of congress
at the beginning of a session were early in
augurated at the capitol Monday morning.
By 10 o'clock people began to flock into the
galleries of the house, tbe favorite resort
whenever there are general and uniform
proceedings of interest in congress. At 11
o'clock the galleries were half full, and as the
intervening hour to the opening wore away,
they were filled to overflowing. Members
flocked into the hall of the house of represen
tatives very slowly and stood around with
their arms akimbo, explaining to friends and
correspondents, how they "made it" or "got
ieft" in tho recent campaign, and election.
The stories were interest.ng and sometimes
thrilling, as the narratives branched off into
"boodle," violence and romance. But good
humor abounded. Those who were defeated
for re-election declared that they were glad
to retire from public life, and thoso re-elected
were thanking friends for congratulations.
The senate chamber presented a sombre
appearance with its heavy crepe drapery
about the gallery railings in memory of the
late Senator Pike and ex-President Arthur.
A much smaller crowd of visitors lingered
here than the house, where the bluster
and amusement occurred.
One committee was in session Monday
4norning besides the house committee on ap
propriation, and that was tho joint confer
ence on the inter-state commerce bill. Tbe
conferees hope to get their bill ready to re
port by the middle of tho week. They ad
journed at 11:30 o'clock to Wednesday morn
ing, when tbo only point of importance not
determined will be settled—that of court
jurisdiction. If it is ascertained that suits
against inter-state roads can be brought in
stato courts they will be given jurisdiction.
Otherwise only federal courts will have
jurisdiction.
Senator John Sherman, of Ohio, called
the senate to order at noon and Rev.
J. J. Butler delivered the prayer. Annual
reports of departments were laid before the
senate. Committees were appointed to notify
the house that the senate was in session and
to wait upon the president. Messrs. Edmunds
and Saulsbury were designated to perform
this duty. Senator Williams' credentials
were presented by his colleague, Senator
Stanford, and ho was sworn in. Some bills
and petitions were introduced to forfeit land
giants, to authorize bridges across the Mis
souri and East rivers, etc. Recess was then
taken until 2 o'clock, when the message was
received and its reading begun.
The reading of the message was finished at
3:25, when it and accompanying documents
were ordered printed. Hoar said that the
senate Pacific railroad funding bill had been
set down as a special order for Tuesday, and
asked that its consideration bo deferred, in
the hope that the house would in the mean
time take some action that would relieve the
senate of trouble in regard to it. Blair an
nounced the death of his late colleague, Mr.
Pike, and on his motion tbo senate, as a
mark of respect to his memory, at 3:25 p. m.
adjourned.
The .speaker called tho house to order at
noon and Chaplain Milburn delivered the
prayer. The roll was called and S41 mem
bers responded. The senate was informed
that the house was ready for business.
Messrs. Reagan, Breckenridge of Kentucky,
and Reed, were designated a committee to
notify the president that the house awaited
his pleasure. Messrs. S. S. Cox and Henry
Bacon of New York, and Henry W. Rush of
Maryland, were sworn in as members. The
bouse took a recess until 3 o'clock when the
message was received and read.

COFFEE
SOLD ONLY IN ONE-POXJND PACKAGES.
5 to 8 Cents a Pound Saved.
Yon cannot get as good coffee loose for less than tbe above difference in
price. All enterprising merchants know this and offer it freely.
They consider the best interests of their customers, and know that its
drinking quality will increase their sales, and in the end make them more
money. Some dealers look only at immediate results and urge you to buy bulk
coffee or some other package coffee on which they can make large profits.
Do not be influenced by arguments of interested parties, but judge for
yourself. Give our coffee a chance on its merits and you will admit it is
better than any other package coffee, and as good as any bought at 25 cents
per pound in bulk. Sold by principal grocers everywhere.
