VIEWS OF SENATOR HOAR
MASSACHUSETTS STATESMAX WOULD
DANISM ALL AXAHCIIISTS.
He Would Send Erery One to Some
Spot Where There Is No Govern
ment, the Utopia of Their Desire.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. Senator Mc
Comas, of Maryland, made an extended
and carefully prepared speech in the Sen
ate to-day with anarchy for his theme,
and was followed by some brief remarks
by Mr. Hoar, of Massachusetts, on the
difficulties In the way of dealing with an
archist assassins. Mr. McComas's remarks
showed careful examination of the legal
authorities. He maintained that Congress
hud full power under the Constitution
to enact a law punishing with death any
person kilting a President, or assaulting
the President, with Intent to kill, or aid
ing, inciting, or procuring such an act.
lie favored rigid provisions In the immi
gration laws for the deportation of alien
Anarchists. Much of the speech was de
voted to an explanation of the dangerous
doctrines of anarchy and the extent to
which these doctrine had been propagated
within recent years.
"Within seven years," he said. "President
Carnct, Prime Minister Canovas del Cas
tillo, the Empress of Austria, King Hum
bert and President McKinley have been
foully assassinated by Anarchists. Our
homes are still under the shadow of na
tional grief for our best beloved President
and the heart of the-world Is with us in
our sorrow. It is humiliating to consider
how Impotent are - our , federal laws to
punish this fearful crime. These tragic
assassinations in five countries, widely
separated, in so short a time, show that
this hideous crime of anarchy Is increas
ing. To abnormal minds possessed with
this impulse to homicide envy and vanity
give a peculiar fascination to the Idea of
assassinating a King or President. Con
gress must legislate against this new
peril with courage, with firmness, but also
Tvith conservatism and prudence. The
Constitution permits Congress to enact a
law to punish such crimes against the
very existence of the government the
Constitution ordained."
After defining the terms of a prepared
statute fixing the death penalty for killing
a President, or assaulting him with intent
to kill, or advising, inciting or procuring
such acts, the senator preceded as fol
lows: "This sovereign Ntilcn is not so
weak that it must depend ur-jn the vary
ing laws of Its different States to punish
a criminal who assassinates or' attempts
to assassinate the President whom the
Constitution declares shall take care that
the laws be faithfully executed.
ALWAYS ON DUTY.
The President is within this peace of
the United States. A person assailing the
President while In the discharge of his
duties violates this peace. If the Presi
dent is receiving the people of our country
or representatives of foreign countries in
any city or any of our States he Is at the
time within the peace of the United States.
If, after he performs such function, he
Journeys to the White House and at night,
when asleep, the car wherein he sleeps be
assaulted with dynamite, such crime is
still a crime against the peace of the United
States In whatever State the President's
train may be. Can this be doubted? The
President's duties are continuous, not pre
termitted. He Is always on duty. He
cannot delegate his highest functions. Un
til lie dies, or resigns, or ends his term
he is ever taking care that the law be
faithfully executed. That the government
may not be pretermitted from necessity the
President is on duty always and every
where. The President is In the- peace of
the United States at all times and in
all placrs In the Union.
"Congress may go further it may enact
laws to protect the high executive offi
cers; it may even protect senators and
members of Congress. I am convinced it
is wise to legislate now to protect the
head of the state the President and the
Vice President and the officers on whom
the office of Resident shall devolve and
now go no further. It may be prudent
to declare that this statute Is not to be
construed to Impair the protection already
afforded by the law to other officials of
the United States.
'"Congress should enact a law to give
federal courts Jurisdiction to try and pun
ish by Imprisonment for a term of years
two or more who confederate and con
spire to murder the President or Vice
President or both, or any of the officers
In line of succession to the President, or
who advise or incite any person to over
throw the federal government or destroy
it by force and violence by willfully kill
ing or assaulting with Intent to kill the
Iresident or Vice President, or both, or
any of the officers In line of succession to
tiie President.
AIM KD AT SOCIETIES.
"This statute should make it a crime,
with penalty of imprisonment for a term of
years, for any person to knowingly become
or continue to be a member of any associa
tion, club or assembly where any person or
persons advise or Incite any of the offenses
before mentioned.
"Such statute should make It a crime
punishable by imprisonment for a term of
years for any person or persons to threaten
or to speak, write, print or publish any
works or declarations counseling, advising
or inciting other persons to willfully kill,
or to assault with Intent to kill, the Pres
ident. The prohibitions, crimes and penal
ties of the postal laws to suppress fraudu
lent and lottery schemes should be extend
ed to irclud the sending through the malls
of written or printed Anarchist doctrines or
newspaper counseling or advising the
crimes In this statute mentioned or coun
seling or advl.-lng the subversion or de
struction by force and violence of the gov
ernment of th United States.
"Hut thi statute would be Incomplete un
less it included one other feature. It should
make it a crime punishable with a term of
imprisonment for tt or more while In the
United States to conspire and confederate
to commit any one of the crimes mentioned
upon any resident, king or other had of a
state, or for any person to solicit, persuade
ct propose to any other person to murder
the head of a state or any republic, king
dom, empire c r other sovereign Mate. In
ternational comity require this. No one
doubts that a conspiracy In one nation to
kill the head of another state is an offense
against the law of nations.
"We should enact laws to expel and to
exclude alien Anarchists. We shall, at this
session, with unanimity re-enact the Chi
nese exclusion acts. I will cheerfully vote
to exclude the hordes of Chinese and pre
vent the competition of Chinese cheap la
bor. Far more readily will I vote to ex
clude alien Anarchists here now. We have
naturalized and even native Anarchists in
our midst. With these we must contend in
other fashion. Why should we not. as we
may. expel alien Anarchists for cause?"
The senator also urged numerous amend
ments of the Immigration laws with a view
to excluding Anarchists. In conclusion he
said: "At all times the body of the plain
people, whom Lincoln loved and upon
whom McKinley leaned, are its unfailing
defenders. This great people, facing the
hideous peril of anarchism, taught by their
sorrow to think straight and clear, now
rate more highly than ever the value of
their government, prize more than ever Its
benefits, which are theirs to enjoy and
theirs to transmit. More than ever before
are now revealed to them its blessings, its
glory and its power."
MR. HOAR'S REMARKS.
At the conclusion of Mr. McComas's re
marks Mr. Hoar spoke briefly along the
same lines. He said that while he heartily
agreed with much that had been said, yet
the great difficulty in all these cases of
assassination was that the assassin was
willing and anxious to give up his life. Fear
of consequences did not in any way deter
such an assassin. Such was the case with
the assassin of William of Orange, who
welcomed the torture Inflicted on him.
Every assassin of a foreign ruler had ex
pected early and certain death. The multi
plication of punishments for the act Itself
therefore would accomplish little. Much
good might be accomplished In limiting the
circulation of fanatical doctrines. But the
senator believed that a much more effective
remedy could be secured if by common con
sent of all civilized nations some tract of
land somewhere on the earth's surface,
hemmed in from the outer world, could be
set aside for the confinement of those who
counseled the killing of rulers or the over
throw of government. "Let the Anarchists
have an object lesson," the senator said,
"and let the world have an object les3on.
Let there be a little Inoculation of anarchy
Into the Anarchist himself and let him have
an anarchistic government among his fol
lowers." Mr. Hoar said banishment would be a
proper punishment under the Constitution,
and if all nations would agree that every
such person be sent to a spot, where there
was no government. It would be an effec
tive remedy. Certainly, the Anarchist
could not complain, for in being trans
ported to a place of no government, he
would have leached his Utopia.
-Mr. McComas's resolution was then laid
aside for discussion later.
The presiding officer announced the fol
lowing senators as the committee to act
with the committee from the House to con
sider by what token of respect Congress
may express Its deep sensibility at the
death of the late President McKinley:
Messrs. Foraker, of Ohio; Fairbanks, of In
diana: Allison, of Iowa; Kean, of New Jer
sey; Aldrich, of Rhode Island; Nelson, of
Minnesota; Perkins, of California; Jones,
of Arkansas; Morgan, of Alabama; Cock
rell. of Missouri, and McEnery, of Louis
iana. A message was received from the Presi
dent responsive to the Senate resolution
transmitting the letters of Jefferson to
Madison and Monroe on the subject of the
annexation of Cuba.
The Senate passed a bill extending the
life of the Industrial Commission until Feb.
13 next to complete work it now has In
hand. Adjournment was taken until next
Monday.

pers Campaign for Re-Enactment
of the Chinese Exclusion Act.
SCRANTON, Ta., Dec. 5. Two hundred
and eighty-five delegates, representing
more than a million and a half workmen,
responded to the roll call at the opening
session of the twenty-first annual conven
tion of the American Federation of Labor
which was called to order by President
Samuel Gompers in St. Thomas College
Hall this morning. The convention Is said
to be the largest congress of workmen ever
held in this country. Organization, set
tlement of questions Involving contested
seats and the reading of the annual reports
of the president, secretary and treasurer
took up the entire time of the convention.
During the day one surprise was sprung
on the delegates and one Important de
cision was made. The surprise came In
the form of an objection to the seating of
the United Mine Workers' delegates be
cause of an alleged arrearage In their per
capita tax. The objection was overruled
by an almost unanimous vote of the dele
gates. The important question decided re
lated to the contested seat from the Cen
tral Labor Union from Richmond, Va.,
which body refused to admit negro work
men to its organization. The dispute was
adjusted by seating the Central Labor
Union representative and instructing the
executive board of the American Federa
tion of Labor to form a separate central
union for colored men.
When the names of the delegates repre
senting the United Mine Workers of Amer
ica were reached in the roll call C. L.
Shamp, of Chicago, international secretary-treasurer
of the Brotherhood of Sta
tionary Firemen, objected to their being
seated. He maintained that the mine
workers were not entitled to representation
In the convention because the per capita
tax of 14,000 had not been paid to the
Federation.
President Mitchell, of the mine workers,
replied that his organization was not ask
ing for special privileges. Several thou
sand of Its members were on strike almost
continually for the past two years, and he
said he had asked the executive board to
remit the levy because the miners had paid
an assessment of $5.000 for the aid of the
machinists. He said if the convention de
cided that his organization was in arrears
he would immediately draw a check for
the amount due. The matter went no fur
ther, and by an almost unanimous vote the
coal miners' representatives were seated.
The contest between the American Fed
eration of Musicians and the Detroit
Central Labor Union over the sea ting of the
latter's delegate was settled by the Cen
tral Labor Union being recognized. The
decision In this case was accompanied by
recommendations looking toward an ami
cable adjustment of the differences between
the Central Labor Union and the Musi
cians' Union of Detroit.
PRESIDENT GOMPERS'S REPORT.
The reading of the annual report of Pres
ident Gompers consumed three hours. Sec
retary Morrison's report and that of Treas
urer John B. Lennon were also read. Mr.
Gompers's report showed a net Increase of
3U local unions for the year and a gain
of 364,410 members. From national a.nd in
ternational unions and the Federation di
rect there were Issued 4,056 charters for
newly-formed unions, and charters sur
rendered or unions disbanded numbered
1.150. On Oct. 31 last there were affiliated
with the Federation: National and Interna
tional unions, eighty-seven; city central la
bor unions, 327; state federations of labor,
twenty; local trades unions, having no na
tional or international, u0, and federated
labor unions, 3P9.
There were four strikes of a general
character during the year. About these
the report says that of the river and dock
workers of San Francisco was a distinct
victory.
The purpose for which the strike of the
Amalgamated Association of Steel and
Iron Workers was inaugurated was not
achieved and it was terminated upon con
ditions less advantageous than perhaps
could have been obtained. Owing to the
widespread interest this strike aroused
a large number of Iron and steel workers
employed by other than the corporation
against which the strike was Inaugurated
have been organized under the jurisdiction
of the Amalgamated Association. The
hope Is entertained, too, that the day is
near at hand when every one employed at
the various branches of the industry and
coming under the jurisdiction of the Amal
gamated Association may be enrolled as
a member prepared to defend and promote
the interests of the entire craft, and to
further the great cause for which we unite
and federate the case of human justice.
Officers of the International Association
of Machinists report that their strike has
very largely succeeded in establishing the
nine-hour rule In that trade. They claim
th settlements reached have given t0.(XQ
machinists a shorter workday, 15.000 others
are affected by compromises reached and
75.0X) machinists will receive an average of
25 cents a day increase in wages.
The report notes a growing tendency to
agreements In industry. To create a de
fense fund. It recommends changing th?
Federation's constitution so as to admit of
a larger assessment and the levy by the
executive council early In the year of a
postlon assessment, divided so that a tund
mav be at its disposition at any time in the
interest of any of affiliated organizations,
engaged In a protracted struggle which
they could not singly support. It also rec
ommend. authorizing a committee to meet
with representatives of the Western Fed
eration of Miners looking to their affllia-
i.on. The report denounces the employ
ment of young children and contends for
greater organization among women work
ers. Mr. Gompers says he has arranged an
active campaign for the re-enactment of
the Chinese exclusion act and expresses
surprise at the "patience of the Pacific
coast citizens In submitting to a state of
affairs so horrible and degrading." It ar
raigns Chinese immigrants as lowering
American standards.
Treasurer Lennon's report showed an in
come of $126.522: expenses, $118,708; total
funds at hand. KM 4.
Secretary Morrison's report shows the
total number of strikes of all kinds re
ported, aggregating 1.066, in which 153.56
members were benefited and 12,707 were not
benefited. Their total cost was $548,003.
Situation at Pittsburg.
PITTS DURG, Pa., Dec. 5. The closing
down of the Clinton furnaces on the South
Side to-day was one of the more recent
effects of the great freight congestion in
Pittsburg. Nearly all the principal mills
and furnaces in Pittsburg are now idle or
running at low ebb. Those that are able
to keep in operation are expecting to close
down in a few days. Officers of the Bes
semer Furnace Association stated to-day
that practically all the valley plants are
closed or else are working so lightly that
little was being gained.
Railroad officials promise that matters
will Improve after the first of next month,
Wiien some of the motive power that has
been engaged in the coal movement will be
released and sent to the Pittsburg district.

GUILTY OX FIVE COUNTS.
Unconfirmed neport that the Rear
Admiral Will De Charged vlth
Disobedience, Etc.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5. A special to the
Press from Washington says:
"Rear Admiral Schley has been found
at fault on five counts by the court of In
quiry. This comes from a person who Is In
a position to learn the opinion of the three
admirals on the different specifications of
the precept. It is understood, however,
that the court finds against Schley.
"First For the delay of the flying squad
ron off Clenfuegos.
"Second For misrepresentation of the
reasons for returning to Key West to coal.
"Third For disobedience of orders In
making the retrograde movement.
"Fourth For failure to destroy the Colon.
"Fifth For conduct unbecoming an offi
cer and gentleman in the Schlej'-Hodgson
controversy."
It is Impossible to-night for the Asso
ciated Press to confirm the report of the
Press's statements in regard to the find
ing of the Schley court.
DELAY IN NEELY CASE
PROSECUTIOX LACKS TESTIMONY
FROM TUE UNITED STATES.
Protest of the Defendant's Counsel
Against a One-Sided Hearing: Con
sidered by the Cabinet.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. The prosecution
In the case of Charles W. F. Neely, charged
with postal frauds In Cuba, has met with a
check, which may cause much delay In the
trial of this case. It appears that the
prosecution is of necessity relying largely
upon letters setting out testimony taken In
the United States. Such depositions may be
used lawfully, according to the Spanish
practice. But the question has been raised,
and has been discussed by the Cabinet: "Is
such a proceeding lawful under the statute
by means of which the extradition of Neely
to Cuba was secured?"
The extradition laws are held by Neely's
friends and counsel to demand for the ac
cused the opportunity to be confronted with
witnesses against himself, or have full op
portunity to cross-examine on depositions,
as he should have had under the American
practice. To admit this point would be to
greatly endanger the success of the prose
cution, in the opinion of the officials here,
but so far no decision has been reaohed.
RUN DOWN WITH DOGS
TWEXTY-TWO NEGROES CAPTURED
WITH AID OF IILOODIIOL'XDS. .
Arrests Followed a. FiRht In "Which
Two Whites nnd Two Illacks Were
Killed and Others AVounded.
ANDALUSIA, Ala., Dec. 5. Shelff Brad
shaw returned to Andalusia at 12 o'clock
to-day with twenty-two negroes who are
accused of complicity in the killing at
Opp, last evening, of J. W. Dorsey, a mer
chant, and Fate Atkins, city marshal at
Opp, so seriously wounded he died soon
afterward. The negroes brought in to
day were chased with bloodhounds and
captured by the sheriff and his posse.
There is great excitement here and there
are fears that the friends of the dead white
men will attempt a wholesale lynching.
The sheriff landed the negroes safely In
jail here and has taken precautions to re
sist the mob in case one is formed.
J. W. Dorsey and Marshal Fate Atkins
went to the turpentine quarters near Opp
yesterday to arrest a negro who was ac
cused of stealing a pistol from a white
man. The negro was barricaded in his
cabin and fired on the men as they ap
proached. It developed that the negro
had about fifty of his fellow-workmen in
the house with him. A general fight ensued
in which Dorsey was killed and Atkins
fatally wounded. A white man named
Fltzslmmons. who was with them, was
shot twice in the leg. Two negroes were
killed and several others wounded. The
attempt to capture the negroes at that
time was given up and Sheriff Bradshaw
was sent for. He left Andalusia at once
for Opp with deputies and dogs and re
turned to-day with twenty-two negroes.
J. W. Dorsey. one of the white men
killed, was one of the most prominent citi
zens of Opp. being a merchant, a member
of the Council and treasurer of the town.
SCHEME OF SHEEPMEN.
Plan to Keep Flockmasters Out of the
Sweetwater Valley.
CHEYENNE, Wyo.. Dec. 5. A combina
tion Is being formed at Rawlins by the
sheepmen of what Is known as the Sweet
water country, for the purpose of excluding
Utah flockmasters and local cattlemen
from encroaching on what Is known as
the Red Desert winter ranges in Sweet
water valley. It is proposed to lease and
buy from the Union Pacific every alter
nate section, which Is owned by the com
pany and thereby control approximately
1,500.000 acres of the finest winter feeding
ground in the West. By leasing all the
land, which will give them control of al
ternate government sections, the sheepmen
will hold full control, and range cor.tlicts,
which have been frequent, will come to
and end.
The sheepmen who propose to lease the
land have offered the railroad company a
rate of one cent per acre, or $4. per
year for the land. The proposition has
been wired to the Union Pacific general
land office at Omaha and it is expected
that the deal will be closed in a few days.

Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. Senator Fair
banks has introduced measures providing
for public buildings at Anderson and Mun
de, Ind. Each city, according to this
measure, is to have a $150,000 building.
That Mr. Fairbanks should introduce these
measures early in the session Is an Inti
mation that he means to urge their pass
age. He Is chairman of the committee on
public buildings and grounds, and is In
position to secure the appropriations if It
is possible to do so in the Senate. Repre
sentative Cromer will present the same
measures in the House, and after an In
terview with Mr. Mercer, the chairman of
the House committee on buildings and
grounds, he is encouraged to think he will
be able to secure this legislation and pro
vide these two rival towns of his district
with federal buildings commensurate with
their Importance.
Mr. Cromer also is moving towards se
curing rural free delivery for all the resi
dents of his district. Up to this time he
has secured rural delivery for all the
farmers of his own county (Delaware), and
he thinks he can break the record by being
the first to secure the rural carriers for all
the counties of his district. He has a
good start and has only one important
rival Mr. Fletcher, the representative
from Minneapolis.
XXX
Representative Crumpacker, of Indiana,
one of the original movers of the proposi
tion to reduce the representation of the
Southern States In the House of Repre
sentatives, Is urging the calling of a Re
publican caucus to determine whether the
dominant party In the House shall take up
as a definite policy some plan of action
against the alleged overrepresentatlon of
the Southern States. To-night Mr. Crum
packer Is confident he can secure over one
hundred signatures for the calling of a
caucus, only twenty-five signatures to a
petition being required. He thinks that
over two-thirds of the Republicans In the
House are in favor of the caucus. The
caucus, if called, will determine two
things: First, whether the reduction of
Southern representation Is-to be made a
Republican policy; second, what means
shall be adopted to reach the desired end
in the quickest and easiest manner. Mr.
Crumpacker received Information to-day
from influential Republicans in the Senate
of approval In the upper body of the cam
paign that Is being started In the House.
These senators urged the House Repub
licans to go ahead with the work and
push it to early completion. The reduction

Members of the House are showing some
opposition to the origination of Philippine
revenue legislation in the Senate, and In
particular to Senator Lodge's bill, which
deals with this subject. Representative
Tawney, of Minnesota, holds that the con
stitutional provision that "all bills for rais
ing revenue shall originate in the House of
Representatives" applies to the Philippine
measure, and the Minnesota member will
oppose any Senate bill on the subject as an
invasion of the prerogatives of the House.
Mr. Overstreet, of Indiana, and quite a
number of other influential members main
tain that the Senate Philippine bill in
volves no Invasion of House rights, as it
extends an existing law to the Philippines
and is not a revenue measure within the
meaning of the Constitution. In any event,
the question of the right of the House over
the subject is likel to be discussed on the
floor of the House.
