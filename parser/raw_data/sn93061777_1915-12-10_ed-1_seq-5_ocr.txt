To Literary and Debating
Societies
You, who think that your
literary and debating societies
are not beneficial should be
awakened to the fact that they
give the very fundemental
principals upon which the boys
and girls will have to perform
public duties by the time they
are men and women. Think of
the progress our country has
made within the last generation
and how much more we will ad
vance in the next generation.
I cannot give enough encour
agement to a society which
train the youths for their future
advancement. The best time
for training is in youth. Of
course boys and girls are more
easily discouraged than a man
or woman, but if thev have a
few "I will" com rads they are
soon ready to try again. We
can not expect to miss the dis
couragements for they are stive
to come and the best way to
treat them is to pass them up as
nothing, for the more you think
of them the larger they become
Those who have had no ex
perience in literary and debating
work should not start out think
ing they will exeeil the ir neigh
bors' exrcrieiiced debaters and
elecutionists in a few weeks or
months for if they do thy may
be sadlly disappointed and cause
the destruction of their society.
Those tint achieve greatness do
not do so on the very beginning
but instead they go forward step
by stop until their climax has
been reached, then comes their
just reward. Never feel as if
there is no room for your com
rads are striving to succeed; all
the seats of success shall never
be occupied.
Selfishness should never enter
into your society. Attend the
meetings of other societies for
there is always something new
to learn. An experienced per
son or any other person should
not laugh at mistakes made at
meetings in which they are not
concerned, but should always be
ready to speak an encouraging
word. It should be impressed
upon everybody's mind that,
whether you speak discouraging
ly or encouragingly, the words
will not be forgotten. Societies
should not boast over their vic
tory when contesting. If they
deserve praising others will
praise them.
