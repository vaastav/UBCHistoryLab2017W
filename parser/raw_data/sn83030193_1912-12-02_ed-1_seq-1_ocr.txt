Justice Likely to Demand Ex
planation from Heads of
Corrections Department.
It was repor'd to-day that Justice
Ooff had exprcss.l Indignation over the
special favors that were ehown to
Charles H. Hyde, convicted of bribery,
by the heads of the Department of Cor
rection. It was said by those who had
discussed the subject with the Supreme
''ourt Justice that he was likely to ca.i
upon both Commissioner Whitney and
his Deputy. Mr. Wright, for an ex
planation of why they were providing
the former City Chamberlain wrth de
luxe accommodations In the Tombe and
making public declarations of hia Inno
cence after a Jury bad founj Itlffl guilty.
In an alleged interview published to
dty Deputy Commissioner Wright wai
msde to say that he had catered to tho
c m;ort of Mr. Hyde becue he be
lieved In his Innocence. In a eupple
mental statement made to-day Mi
Wright revised the Interview.
"I did not say," he declared, "that i
was providing Mr. Hyde with the best
possible accommodations because I be
lieved In his innocence. I did say I be
lieved In Mr. Hyde's Innocence and I do
believe In his Innocrnre. But the rea
son Mr. Hyde was lodged In the War
den's room, so-called, was because the
Tombs physician urged that It woul tl
he a gieat hardship to Ur. Hyde I"
compel a man of his size to sltop on I
cell cot. Upon this recommendation I
provided Mr. Hyde with more commo
dious quarters This was entirely an.l
exclusively within the provlr. e of the
Department of Corrections, ami I sc.
no reason why 1 should be called upor.
to make explanation for what amour.. ...
to purely a humane action."
For the ftret time since hie conviction
for Urinary and his Imprisonment In
the Tombs Hyde appeared to-day to
have recovered from the despondency
that had maa kd hi.- beailng after he
heard the jury's eidlct.
The former City Chimberlain was re

that the former city official became a

The mystery was made out of the fact
that when Hyde was oonvlcted he oould
not recall the date of his naturalisation.
The records show that h reoelved his

YORK, MONDAY,
SWEEP BIG LINERS;
Carmania, Cameronia and the
New York Arrive, Bat
tered by Fierce Storm.
STATEROOMS FLOODED.
Passengers Panic Stricken as
Water Breaks Down Doors
and Pours Into Portholes.
A terrific storm which awept across
the Atlantic last week smashed and
battered three westbound liners which
Tea, he.l port to-day from twenty-four to
thirty-six hours behind their schedule.
The New York of the American line,
the Carmania of the Cunard line and
the Cameronia of the Anchor line are
the vessels which bore the full brunt
of the hurricane.
Passengers on all three ships were
kept below during most of the voyage.
Bent and twisted stanchions and rails,
crushed lifeboats and life rafts, broken
port lights, dented bulwarka, battered
bridges and funnels encrusted with salt
bore wltnesa to-day to the height and
power of the waves.
Passengers told stories of waking up
In the night to find their stateroom!
knee deep with water. On the New
York and Carmania, It became neces-
sary to abandon portions of the second
cabin, which were flooded by water
which swept through companlonwaya
from the main deck and through broken
ports.
PASSENGERS WERE WARNED
OF DANGER.
The three vessels ventured out Into
the Atlantic from the Irish coast
at about the same time, Nov. 21.
Nasty weather was encountered at
once. On Tuesday and Wednesday,
passengers were warnod ag.tlnst ventur
ing on deck. On Friday and Saturday
It would have been Impossible for any
of the passengers to venture out of the
section reserved for cabins an.l saloons.
I-'ew appeared at meals, and the stew
ards and stewardesses had one of the
busiest voyages of their experience
The promenade deck of the New York
was almost completely under water for
four hours last Friday.
The American liner fared worst. At
9 o'clock Friday morning she ran lnf
a hurricane which lasted for five hours.
The wind blew from 90 to 100 miles an
hour and waves, described by the
veteran Capt. Roberts as the highest
he ever saw, swept the vessel con
tinually. Capt. Roberts and his officers, fore
seeing the storm, had made their ship
snug and ordered all passengers below,
but their precautions did not save parts
of the vessel a good drenching. Three
lifeboats and five life rafts were
smashed and part of the starboard rail
aft on the main deck was carried away.
A great wave awept the after saloon
companion door from Its hinges. The
water swept In, broke down a partition
and deluged parts of the second cabin.
A few male passengers who had visited
the smoking room early were unable to
leave It while the storm was on. Pres
eott, the smoking room steward, eald
he aaw nothing but water rushing by
the porte for four hours.
PASSENGERS THOUGHT SHIP
WAS SINKING.
The Carmania ran into a terrific
storm last Tuesday afternoon. The
second cabin was flooded and some of
the paasengers, finding their staterooms
knee-deep In water, oecarns panic
stricken, thinking the ship waa sink
ing. On Friday and Saturday, the Car
majila ran through the worm that bat
tered the New York. The Cameronia
bucked a succession of hurricanes.
Mrs. Robert J. Wynne, wife of the
former Consul General in London, was
a passenger on ths New York. Sha

A bitter denunciation of Max I).
Steuer by Abraham L. Krlunger, In
which the attorney was called a per
jurer, blackmailer and Jurv flier
marked thla afternoon's trial of the
suit brought by Kdlth St. Clair, a mu
sical comedy actress, against Klaw A
Lrlangei. to recover $26,000 on a con- '
tract. Mr. Steuer la Miss St. Clair's
eouneel and drew up an agreement I
wheroby the theatrical managers were
to make ten annual payments of f 2.K00
each to supplant an oral agreement I
whereby she was to receive at least ,
76 a week for life.
Thla agreement presented by Mr.
Steuer, who, the defenee claims, threat
ened a "nasty scandal." was In nature
of blackmail, and waa so termed at the
time, Aug. T, 1909, acoordlng to Er
langer. ftdmond L. Mooney. trial lawyer for

Erlanger over dates and testimony given
at the flrat trial when tht explosion

The prominent theajtrl-al man had
been replying to questions In a low tone,
almost a whimper He was asked shout
Mr. Hteuer's attitude when he came to
K i Winger's office to discuss a settle
ment. "He was as gentle as a lamb," said
the witness. "Ho stsrted his talk quiet
ly and In smooth whispers told me
what I should do. He was suave and
gentle, the same way that he cornea
Into court, an.l he got me like he does
the Juries. Only he got a verdict quick
er." Mr. Mooney. when the witness had
flu. shed, ssked:
"So you made no bargain with Mr.
Steuer? You simply agreed to pay him
irS.ftOO Iae conditions meant nothing?"
The conditions represented by the
agreement meant everything. I would
have paid gSOO.OOO or IM.-00.000 Just as
ejulckljr."
The defense ejalme the money was
paid to prevent the breaking up f
I.'rlanger'e home.
Mr. Mooney started on a new t. Ii
and wound up by saying.
"So Mr. Steuer, then. Is a liar?"
"Yes, double-dyed!" snapped tha wit
ness. "And you are true?"
"Well, I guess you could collect more
on my reputation than on his Ask any
bank. Or on your.', too, Mr Mooney."
"You probably have more money,"
said the attorney with a smile.
"And more honor." broke In the the
atrical man.
"We'll see about that later."
There was a short lull when Mr
Mooney exclaimed:
"So your fight Is against Mr. Steuer
and not my client?"
