Ore of the latent society "fads" to fit
favor heroabouta this eeaaon, is an exca
clou to Bjnwood and a trip through t!
: oxtenelvo worka of tho Riverside Ir<
Company at that place; if theoo tripa ci
bo mado at night, they aro the thing in
auporlstive degroo. In tho past two weol
four large parties havo beon made up I
thla city and gone down to watc
a regiment of men work I
f aud about lire and molten metal. Or
of th mo parties consisted of tl
young ladios lrom Mieo Parr&a'a priva
Bchonl. Theira waa a daylight trip, hi
the others went down after nipht. Oi
party chartered tho Bollairoand thoothi
two wont down on the traiua; all thrt
wero quite large and overvone in the
waa delighted with tho trip. A. visit;
the rorka embrAcco u walk through tl
blast furnsco, tho ateel plant and tho ne
and oxteneivs pipe mill; the two la
named departments aro tho meat interee
ins: aid excite the moat wonder.

the pipo mill after dark, where tho la]
welders aro r.t work, and ibis is ouo rcaao
1 why tho night trine are preferred.
The trip through the works at any tira
is a wonderful ono and especially oo t
night. It will repay any ono to obtai
j the Liccsaary porruiraion to takoit, an
now that tho examples of the past tw

ew rules and tcalo of wages. Yoslerday
n Intklliohxcku man learned that Mr.

bo Exocnllvo Commlttoo of tho Glossforkora'
Union, had h?ld a brief conver*
atlon with JPrcildent Hcott, of tho (Jdatral

mil (hot ?Mu aorttbinnnt trim lilnilino Inr n

irhlch had granted tho increase, and pro)heeioil
that tho factoriea horo would not

to agroo to tho iucroaso asked (or
{atherero and lamp blowers, (or ho always
thought they should be boltor paid,
lie regarded tho arrangement tbon made,
tiowover, aa merely a temporary ono, or
be would not hnve joined tho minnfacturors
in formulating a now ecile. When
Mr. Cochrnn submitted tho workmen's
viow of it, Mr. ticott uald he wan willing
to submit the question ae to tho existence
of a contract to tho manufacturers' executive
committee, aud ifthatbody held that a
contract existod, ho would livo up to it
His very probable,however, that tho two
factorioo here und tho one named at Wellsburg
will stick to tho manufacturoro'
ultimatum, and that all three factories
will shut down not later than January 3,
and possibly sooner, if tho metal in tho
pots is Boonor exhausted. It la the understanding
that this is the 1 wit week of work

TRH TABIt'F QUESTION," \
RttoUed, That tbo most important and
preening duty of the present session of
Congress is to revise and to amend existing
internal tax and tariff laws as to reduce
tbe annual revenues to be collected
therefrom to tho necesiary wants of tbe
Federal Government and no raoro than it
neods to pay ita matarod dabia, nnd discharge
its obligations under the laws of
Congress without crippling or deranging
any American industries ol business or interest
connected with the subjects of tarifl
taxation or interfering with the just rights
of American working poople, intended to
bo secured to them by tho incidental ef
tecta of revenuo duties, to share in the
joint product of labor and capital employed
in Atnorican mining and rannufactunnz
induetrits, to the full moasure of
the difforonce In tbo coat of their labor
and tho labor of thosa engaged in similar
industries in Knrope.
lUtolted, That the Senate will concnr in
no joint resolution far tho Until adjournment
of the preaent sewiou of Congress
until aftor tho passage of ouch remedial
lawa aaBpecifisd in the foregoing resolution.
?
In tho course of hia argument Mr. Tugh
naked whether Congress would wipe out
ali internal rovenue taxes and allow the
necessary revenue bs raiasd on tarifT lmporta
alone.' He had never a clearer or
stronger conviction than the conviction
that the whieky tax was perfectly just and
wholly unobjectionable, except on the
ground that it was a direct tax. There
waa nothing produced, owned and consumed
that could Gupply tho government
with ninety millions of revenue with mero
propriety and leea injury to any human
being than whieky.
Ho had never heard any valid reason,
and did not bollevo there waa any valid
reacon, why the whisky drinkers ahould
bo relioved from tho payment of this tax
and why tho revonue which It yielded
Bhould bo extorted by tho tariff from tho
conaumera of necessaries of life. He
know of no hotter ubo to which whisky
could be applied than to tho production of
ninety millione of revenue, necoasary to
pay pensions and intercot on the war debt,
instead of extorting that amount from
tho harmless consumption of tho imported
articlo. Who insisted, he asked, that tho
luxury of whisky drinking should be
freed from the harden? Was it tho whisky
drinkers or tho whisky makers who declared
that thoro ahould bo no revision of
the tarifT until every internal rovenuo tax
waa repeated? Tho cry catno loudest and
fiercest from the manufacturers nnd their
representatives. Tho most jieQant and
uncompromising advocates of free whiBky
wero tho manufacturers of protected arti- 1
cleo.
a compromise. ' \ '
As a general compromiao.he would re* i
peal Iho intornal tax on tobacco, (or the
boIo reason that tobacco was an agricultural
product, anil let the tax on whioky '
Dtand for faturo consideration. lie do- '
clarod bo would vote for no duty on any
thins manufactured in tho United Statea
that would not ciipple any home industry,
or impair tho ability of home competition.
No people, lio said, had over submitted eo
long to robbery on tho part o? their own
government, and those who oppoeed a ro- ,
vision of tho tariff at tho rink of a financial .
panic nnd industrial parulyala became \
parties to thio robbery, and became |
political criminals. Both tho Republican (
and Democratic partleo had promised to
rednco tho income to tbo wantn of tho
zovornraent, and it wua trifling for'ltopublicana
to charge upon the Democratic .
party tbo blarao of tho failure to revise 1
:ha tariff. Thio Oongri'GO could not nd- !
journ until ouch a change was made in the
revenue lawo aa would atop tho flow of
aiOnoy from the people into the national
treasury beyond tho noeda of the 'governr
ment. He would put on the Ires list

nado these remarks to show \hat thore was '
lot the least danger to tho iron pro and

ho tariff, ('resident Cleveland had in
lia recent annual melange shown a
onrogo and patriotism never exhibited

is no mistake as to what the President
lelioved to be tho paramount duty of
