THE REBELLION AND EMANCIPATION.
When Congress assembled a year ego, t'
war had already lated Eearlv twerty miatb
and there bid been many oor fl otfl. both on lot I
and soa, with varying results. Tbe rebfllli
had been prersed btck into reduced limits; y
tbe tone of pobl 0 fee.Iog and opinion, at boo
end abroaJ, was not satisfactory. With oth
signs, tbe popular elecllms, then Inst past, I
dioa'ed nceasiness among ourselves, whi
amid much tbat was cold and menaoing, II
kindest words coming from England were p
tered in scoents oi pity tbat we were too bli I
to surrender. Our orumerce was tuffVrii
greatly by a few armed vessel?, bnilt npon S'
furnished from foreign shores, and we we
threatened with such additions from tbe sao '
quarter ae would sweep onr trade from the re
and rme onr blockade, w e nad railed to ell
from European Governments anything bope 1
npon theeutjeat. Tbe Emancipation Proclam
tion which waa Issued iu September was runnii -
its assigned period 10 tbe beginning of toe nr
year A moctn later, tne noai proclimatli
came, Inc'nding the announcement that oolor
men of suitable cotdltion wou'd be reoelv '
Into tbe war service. Tbe polioy of emanelp

gave to the future a new aspect, abont wbl.
bopea, fears, and doubts contended in nncerlai
oor 11 it, acoording to our political system, as
matter of clril almiuiatration. Tbe Gere
Government bad no lawful power o iffti

It bad been boped mat tne rebeilnn oould b

if it ebouid, tbe crisis of tie contest won'

bordere are pressed still farther back, and -the
complete opening of the Mississippi rivei

tested, it is difficult to say tbey are not a cot 1
soldiers as any. No servile insurreotion, c.
tendency to violence or cruelly, has marked th

PLAN TO RESTORE THE UNION—THE EMANCIPATION
PROCLAMATION TO STAND.
Looking now to the ptesent and future, and
with reference to tbe resumption of Ibe nation
antborlty within tbe Stales wherein that au
thority has beeo suspended. I have thought fil
issue a proclamation, a copy ol whioh la here
with traismitted. On elimination of this
proclamation, it will appear, ae Is bslieved, am
justified by tbe Constitution; True; tbe
form of an oath is given, but 00 man is ooeroed '
take it. A manisoily premised atardonln
oaae hi voluntarily takes the oatb. The Con-
Btiiution authorise the Execntive to granl it ,
sueb terms aa are fully established by Iu-
diolal snd otber authorities. I; is also proffered
tbat if, in man; ot the States named, a seat of
Government shall be, in the mode prescribed,
np, snob Government shall be recognised
guaranteed by tbe Uuited States, and tbat
nnder it tbe State shall, on subscribing to lbs
constitutional conditions, be protected sgaioat
invasion and domestic violence. Tbe constitu
tional obligation of tho United States to guar
antee to every Slate in the Union a republican
form of Government, and to protect the State
lha oasa as stated, - Is explbll and full ;
why tender tho benefits of this provision
to a State Government set np la this par
ticular wejl This section of the Constitution
contemplates a oaae where n the element with
in a State, favorable to Republican Government
tbo Union, may be too feeble (or an opposite
hostile element external lo, and even with
in, the Bute, and suoh are preolsely tbo oases
with which we are now dealing Aa attempt
guarantee and protect a isrlsei State) Gov
to
as
ernmeot, constructed In whole or In preponder -
atioff part from the very element rtgainee wbea
hostility and violenoe It Is to be pro ected, Is
simply absurd. There mnst be a test by which
to separate opposlrg elements, eo ss tn build
only from tbe sound, and tbat tost is a auffio ent
and liberal one, wt ioh aooepts a sound whoev
er will make a swern recantation of bis former
nnsoundnt'ss
But If it be prorer to require as a test of ad
mission to tbe political body, an oalh of alle
giance to the Constlintlon of the United States
and to tbe Union nnder II, wby not also lo tbe
lawe and proolama'ions in regard to il tverj ?
Those laws aod proclamations were eoaotrd
and put forth for tbe purpose of aiding In the
suppression of tbe rebellion. To give them
the fullest eQeot there bad to be a pledge for
their maintenance. In my juc'gment tbe; have
aided, sod will further aid, tbe cause for wbloh
ti-ey were enaoted. To give up tbla principle
wojld be not on'y to relirquish a lever of pow
er, but would also be a cm el snd astounding
breach of faltb. I may add, at tbi 1 point, that
while I remain In my present position, I shall
not artetrpt lo retraol ormodidytbe Euaocipa
tlon Proclamation, nor shall I return lo slavery
any person who Is made frse by the terms of
the ploolamatlon. or by any act of Congress.
For tbese, aod other reosoos, it Is tbonght belt
tbat the support oi these persons shall be in
cluded in tbe oalh, and it U believed tbe Exo
ntlve may lawfully claim it in return lor par
don, and tbe restoration of pro'eoted tights
wbloh be has a dear constitutional power to
withhold altogether, or giant upon the terms
whioh be shall deem wisest for the publio Inter
est. It should be ubif-ved, aleo. toil this part
of tbe oatb is subject to tbe modifying and ab
roeatine nowtir of If aisWtiou end supreme ia-
diclal decision. 'I he proposed sequiesceoce of
the National Executive in aoy boner b.e tem
porary State arrangement for tne freed people,
Is made with a view of possibly modifying tbe
OHifutlon and distressing destitution wdiod
must, at least, at eud all classes, by a total
revolution of labor throughout the wboit States.
It Is boped tbat the already dsrplj-t 111 cted
people In those Slates may be somewb moie
ready to give np tbe cause of their iffl otion,
and to this extent this vital matter is life to
themselves, while no power ol tbe Nst'ioaal
Executive to preveat an abuse Is abrldgod by
this p-c position
Tbe suggestion In the prcoltmatioa as to
maintaining the poii io-il frsmework of the

In tbo tope tbat It may do gnoi without harm
It will liivor labor, and avoid great oontualon
But wby any proclamation tow op n ttesu' jel?

proclamation, a plan Is presented which may be
aooepted by tnem as a ral jlog point, and which
will not be rejected here. This may bring tbe m
ti aet sooner tban they otherwise woull. Tbe
objection to a prematu-e presentation of a plan
by tbe National Exeoutiee, too'lsta In tbe
danger ol committals iu points wbich could be
more eafely left to lurther developments. Care
baa been taken to eo shape tbe document as to
avoid embarrassment from t lis source. Iu giv
ing that, on certain terms, certain classes will
be pardoned, witn tbeir runts rcrt.red, it Is 10
said tbat other cissies, on ether terms, will
never be included. 1.1 saying tbat a recooiiroo

way, l! Is not said tbat it will be eroepted In no
Other way. Toe movemenie by am 10 aotiflu
lor emai.olption, not Included la tbe Emtooi
pitioi Proclamation, are matters of profound
gratuiation; and, wbile I do not repeat whit I
have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this
subject, my general views and feel-njs retrain
ucooanged, and I trust that Congress will omit
no fair opportunity of aiding theae Important
steps to tbe great oc.nfuaimt.tion.
lo the midst of otber cares, however Impnr
tact, we most not lose eigbtot tbe fact thai the
war power Is still our main relianoe. To that
power alonsoan we lock ye , for a t me, to give
confidence to the people in cjd ested regttns,
that the Insurgent tower will not again over
run tbem. Until that confidence shall be es
tabliebed, little can be done anywhere for what
is called reconstruction, ilenoe, our cbietest
care must still be directed to our army and
cavj, who have thus far borne tbeir batd r
part so nobly and well; aod It msy be esteem
el fcr. unite that, in giving tbe greatest ef
ficiency to tbtlr iodiepensaiiie arms, we do aso
honorably encourage galliot mea, from oom
mander to sentinel, who compose tbem, and
to whom, more tban a:l o hers, tbe world

The President's Message.
Tbe rsader will find In this number of tte
Stats, mn the President's meisige infa'l.w th
tbe proclamation ascended. Tbeae docume Is
ocoupy so muoh of onr space that we have Ut
ile room lelt for omment This message
comss before the country at a most critical
period in its history at a time when the mu: t
impartial patriotism and tba wisest far seel eg
statesmanship are required in the Executive
bead of the Republic Bat whatever ths merit
or defsots ot tbe message In other reBpeots, iU
most be pilnfully apparent to every man ol
Intel igenoe and rifliotloa that It Is sadly want
ing in the great qulliiea alluiod to.
What the publio will most eagerly seek for
la the messige is Ibe President's exposition
of his policy In reference to slavery end
the leconetrnctlon cf the Unloj. Oo the fi.-at
paint, he admits Ibat under our political sys
tern, the General Government ha no lawful
power , to effjot emanolpa'lon In aay State, aad
thai it was reeottel to only as a military meas
ure, bavicg no warratt or authority In onr Na
tional Constitution Tbe plea of neoesgily only
Is set np in lis justification. Tbe same may bs
said of the employment of negro slaves as sol
diers. Tbe President teems to think that Ibe
result of the tale eleotions is an encourage
ment tt prooeed in carrying oat and perfecting
these measures.
Out the great and absorbing subjeol of Inter.
est In Ibe message le ibe President's plan for
the resumption of the national, authority In
States wherein that authority hie beeo suspend
ed; or In olhtr, wnds, for tha restoration of
tbe Union. To this end he proposes by proota
mail id a lest oath ti be taken by all oltissns of
euchStitse by the loyal aud disloyal alike
without exception j as a condition of being al-J
lowed tbe rl ,ht tj vote at eleotions and of bs- -
log isoognissd ss cltiiens, and entitled as suob
tbe prjlectlon of tbe United States Govern
meet. Tbe proclamation proffers a fall pardon
laklog ths prescribed oatb, Ic pirtlclptnisln
the rebellion, exoeptior officials and certain
other In the Confederate service. Bat no per
son oan, by tbe terms of the proclamation, be
allowed to vote or be tegardod as a oitiien with
oat tiklog the oath.
Tho President says no man If coercsl to
take the oath Il Is a voluntary aot on bis
part. Bat If bo refuses, be Is treated as
Irebsl, an enemy sni aa. outlaw. Ii
this be not ooerolon, we confess we do not
understand tbe meaning of that term. Tbe
odions feature of this portion of the message
tbat It treats all tbe people la Texas, Arkan
sas, Louisiana, Mississippi, lennessee, Aaj
bams, Georgia, Florida, South snd North
Carolina, without axoeplion, as ribeli or as
publio snsmles; none of whom oan be recog
nised as oltliens of thslr State or of tha Uoited
tales, unless they swear io abide by aod faith
fully support all ao's of Congress and all proc
lamations of tba Preeldenl for freeing negro
slarss and employing them In tho military and
naval servloo of tbo Uoited Slates, r ..
Herein Is foil recognition and recommenda
tion by Preatdent Lincoln of tht "Bute sul
tUc dor trine pf Senator Jumhii, Solid lor
WaitikO and the otber Jaoobin leaders- The
States namsd are treated asontcf tie UjIod
and lb sir people as having forfeited all rights
under tbeir respective State Constitutions and
under tbe Coos'ltotion of the Uolted States.
Tbe States are, by tbe piojlatnailoa, regarded
as merely territories or co quered provinces
wbich may be ereoted Into new free States,

oordaooe wltb Jasobin dlotatioo, aud swear al-
leglanos lo tha negro- reelcg and cegio-armiog

the plan proposed. Il Is a plan, not for the res
