A PMtwt for Kin* Willlma.
, Now that King William has a firm grasp
1011 France it does not seem likely that he will let
go If he oan help it. Although he came to the
jpar with only a bare hope of saving his aide of
$he Rhine frontier from French encroachment,
lie Is not very likely te be satisfied with that con
summation alone. He has tasted victory and
|he appetite of conquest is upon him, and It is
Ordinary human nature te satisfy it to the full.
Jt is German human nature especially. It is
one peculiarity of the national character to
ItoKi en with bnlldog tenacity to what they
get. With the rich empire of France in his
grasp; the palaces of Versailles ; the pleasures
of Paris ; the wine countries of Champagne,
Burgundy and Medoo ; the grand fortresses of
Strasbourg, Metz, Havre and Paris ; the rich
manufactories of Rouea, Lyons aad Bordeaux ;
the immense granaries of good things repre
sented by the name of France, and, besides all
these, with the entire military resources of Mie
only enemy he had to fear in his power, is it
likely that King William will put them all
away on the return of peace '( Will he give
up all France for Alsace and Lorraine, or will
he give back all the conquests he has mado for
an indemnity? Not if he his any pretext
whatever upon which to hold his spoils against
the outcrying voice of Christendom.
The pretext already presents itself. Louis
Napoleon Is in Germany a prisoner, at the
head of nearly three hundred thousand of the
flower of the old French army, all prisoners.
They love France, but they scorn the re
public. It may occur that King William
will insist upon the restoration of the Bona
parte dynasty, and Napoleon himself, or at
least his Empress and her son may march into
the capital of France, escorted by these three
hundred thousand soldiers and their marshals,
MacMahon, Bazaine, Canrobert, Lebceuf, and
re-establish the power and pageantries of
the emp're. With this restoration King
William can very reasonably insist upon
keeping at least one hundred thousand Ger
man troops in France, and tho Regency
Would very roadily accede to the proposi
tion? These hundred thousand Germans,
supported as they will be by tho whole military
power Of the German empire, within a day's
inarch of the French capital, would be the
arbiters of peace among tho French people.
They would protect the Regency, repress the
^'reds," curb any alarming growth of military
power, and, in a word, under pretence of pro
tecting Germany from another invasion and
reconstructing France, they would render
Crippled France merely a tributary of victo
rious Germany.
Furs and the fur Trade.
We publish to-day a very interesting account
of the regions from which come the coatly
furs which supply our market and decorate
the beautiful forms of our ladies. The rough
story of the trapper's life, the dangers and
hardships involved in procuring the skins of
those thousands of tiny animals like the mar
ten, for instance, a dozen of which is required
to make one muff, is well told. Tho hunter,
too, must follow the moose, the elk, the musk
ox, the bear, the wolf, the otter, tho ermine
and the black fox ; for the skins of all those
animals enter into the fur trade. Some of
them command large prices, and, as we know,
to clothe a lady in the most expensive suit of
these articles makes a hole in a respectable
fortune. Our fur trade has been very dull
this winter, owing to the pleasant temperature,
and the fur merchants are complaining sadly.
In fact, there has been up to this time no
retail trade at all in furs. But tho present
cold snap will probably brighten tho prospect
for the fur dealers. The history which we
give to-day of the Hudson Bay-Company and
the whole fur-produciug country of tho North
west will be read with interest, coming as it
does from our correspondent, who writes in
the midst of the snow and the haunts of the
wild animals and the lodges of tho trappers
who supply our market with thi3 indispensa
ble article.
The Coukt House Commissioners, it ap
pears, are in doubt as to whether fiey top off
the new, or now rather the old, Court House
building with a Mansard roof or tho dome as
originally designed. We hope that there is
good taste enough amoug the commissioners
not to barbarize this splendid public structure
of vast proportions by crowning it with a
French roof. If the Court House i3 ever to be
completed at all let it bo with a dome in kecpr
ing with the rest of tho architecture.

etfori will probably be made liy Mr. Sumner to have
it referred to tliu Coiumlttoe on Foreign Relations,
nut us ttio resolution contains nothing In Itself that

Kxirrtiiiiintioii of I irary in t liinc ho \V litem.
it appears from the diplomatic correspondence
recently transmitted to Congress that in February
last Baton (ierolt Bent to Secretary I'ish tho contents
of a conlldential note from Count Bismarck, wherein
he urged the importance of combined measures on
the part of the maritime Powers for tho extermina
tion of piracy in Chinese waters. The Baron also
stated that the British Admiralty had given orders
to the naval commaudcr in China to co-operate lor the
object mentioned, secretary l'ish, on March 31, in
formed Baron Cerolt that the President had taken
great pleasure m complying with tho request or
Count Bismarck, by directing Instructions to be
Issued from the Navy Department to Admiral
Rogers. The co-operation of Admiral Rogers and
tlie forces under Ills command won d, however, be
limited to cas s of re ogni/.ed piracy. He was In
structed to proceed In such a way us not to wound
tho Kcnsbliitiesof tho government of China or to in
terfere with the peaceful policy toward China in
which tho government of North Germany and that
ol' the I tilled states so happily agree, lu his letter
to the Secretary ol the Navy on this subject Secre
tary Fish says:?
Should, unhappily, any cause for hostilities occur
daring tho mission, it is hoped tlie Navy Depart
ment will instruct Admiral Ko^eis in such case to
ad vie with .sinister Low, and to leavo with this
derailment the responsibility of war or peuce.

Acting Secretary ol State Davis, November last,
in writing to Minister Bancroft, says:?
Mlni.i^v Low adheres to Ills ?rlglnal opinion that
the dl^ai banco at Tion-tsln, involving the massa
ci'd, was local and unpremeditated, and that the
government at I'ekln smeoiely de-ired to prevent a
repetition and to preserve tne peace: out tho Minis
ter apuears to have decidedly modified Ins opinion
us to the probability that lUcy will be able to do so.
Fearing that tlie Chinese government m gh? find
Itself too weak to resist the pressure of popular
opinion in the masses, acting in harmony with the
cherished wishes and purposes of the literati, and
that It may be lorced Into a war to prevent popular
outbreaks, Secretary Davis adds: ?

On the 29th ol November Secretary Fish wrote to
Minister Low:?
Although the general tenor of your note of tho 13th
September to I'riucc Kutu is regarded as judicious
unit proper, your assurance toward ctio clo e that u
iiagrant violation 01 liie rights and privileges of our
citizens by mo people, an?J the failure of tbe im
perial government to a^ply the proper remedy
promptly, ure tho only circumstances which will causa
a departure from the traditional policy of the United
States in their int . -a ou e with < lilaa, Is considered
to be loo strong an assurance of forbearance, and It
would bo perhaps well that Prince Kung should
understand that any violation of tho rights of our
Citizens and any fla/rant violation ot trea'y .stipula
tions of other Poweiri may cause a change.
, Tho Postal Telegraph a National ^eqalre
menu
It is said by one of the members or tho House
Select Committee on Postal Telegraph that tho
entire committee are of opinion that t e time has
come for the government to intervene in some form;
! but thero is a difference as to the method or
means by which this should bo done. General
Washburn, the chairman, who has obtained tho
unanimous consent of he committee, will report his
bill probably when that committee shall again be
called, but with some changes from the one ot last
session. The most essential alteration Is in regard
to the appraisement ot telegraph property, which, it
Is proposed, the government shall acquire from tho
re.spcctlvevcoinpanies.
More '1 reiible for tlio Parifle Railroad*.
In view of the decision of the Attorney General
with reference to the I'acillc Railroads the repre
sentatives of these roads who are now hero are pre
paring to bring tho matter before Congress, for tho
purpose of getting the laws now on the statute book
concerning these roads construed differently lrom
tho decision of the Attorney General and In favor
of tho railrouds. The Committee on Appropria
tions, which lias the Joint resolution intro
duced a few days ago by Judge Law.
rence, of Ohio, before it, has been waiting
for the promulgation of tbe opinion of the Attorney
General before talcing action. Tho committee will
probably report tlio resolution favorably, and should
it puss the railroad companies will be compelled
not only to pay tho interest on their bonds, but mako
provision for the redemption ol the bonds at ma
turity. The fooling In both houses Is that tho rail
roads should be made to pay tho interest on their
bonds promptly as it becomes due.
Uniform Gold Column*.
During last summer Secretary Fish addressed a
circular to tho Legations of the United States at
London, Paris, Ilerlln, Vienna, Madrid, Uru<sels,
Copenhagen, Florence, Tho Hague, Lisbon, stocK
holmo and Hern with a view to proiuoto the adop
tion by the legislatures of tho several Powers of a
common unit and standard of an International gold
coinage. The the Secretary concludes by saying:?
The government of the United States suggests for
the consideration or the sever d Powers wnether all
that is contemplated may not bo attained without
an abandonment ol the different mint systems. It
suggests, for consideration only and nor, as the
best theoretical solution of the question, that the in
ternational value of tho coins of th ? nations that
may become parties to any monetary con
, vcntlon, or who may in any other way arrange this
question between themselves, shall be determined
by the quantity of pure gold which it contains,
which measure shall be expressed In a common
standard of weight upon Its 'ace, and unless abso
lute unification can be obtained all other questions
of coinage will be left to local law and experience.
Tho French decigram is suggested us the most con
venient cemnon measure by which to determine
this quan itv, 2nd that it is desirable, if possible, to
avoid runnl ig this-cxprossion into .1 fraction.
Minister Bancroft, after presenting the subjoct to
the governments of Prus ;ta and of North Germany,
Informed Secretary Fis'.i tho tendency was toward
tho adoption or the live and twenty franc piece,
with decimal division, but nothing was decided.
Tiou-Rolllnv for the Shipping Interest*.
The shipping Interests are hero at work to get
some legislation at the present session. There will
be a sharp contest between those who are in favor
of importing foreign built shtp.i free of duty, and
those who lavor the bill reported last winter by Mr.
ijfuch, chairman ol tuq select Cvmuntteo on tlio
Decline or American Commerce, which Innm
to encouraging American shipnullder*. The hill
introduced by Mr. Ingeraoll, of Illtuhls, to encourage
shlpownlng and uhlpbulldlng in me United States
meets the approbation of those who are In favor of
importing foreign ships free of duty. The select
committee which liart charge of the subject does not
propose to take any action until after the holidays.
In the meantime a special message on the question
Is expected from the President.
Buruiuc of Centre Market? Two Men
Nil flora led.
Soon alter one A. M. to-day Centre Market, on
Pennsylvania avenue, was discovered to be on tire
In several places, and a few minutes later the en
tire structures, from Seventh to Ninth street, were
enveloped In flames. The adjoining sited t and de
positories of goods were also burned. Small dealers
will suiter severely by the Are. All combustible
materials in the market were consumed,
and the brick walls oulv are lelt
standing. Two men, engaged In removing
the stock of a feed house, were suffocated and their
bodies wero burned beyend recognition, the laillng of
the roof upon the men preventing their reseuo by
friends, firemen or police. One part or Centre Mar
kot was among the oldest buildings lti Washington.
Several weeks only Dave passed since the appraise*
ment of fixtures. Ac., was made, preliminary to the
erection of a building ornamental in style and ample

Presidential Vlnit to the District Reform
Nrbool.
President Grant, accompanied by Senator Ed

Mayor Emery, of Washington, and th<> Hoard of
Trustees of the Reform School of the District of Co
lumbia, and a number of other distinguished gen
tlemen, to-day visited the reformatory Institution
located In the western part of the District and
but quite recently established. Ttie object
of the visit was to acquaint the dlstlngui.sued visi
tors with a knowledge of the system ol' Instruction
and discipline. After listening to the exercises by
the scholars, addresses wero delivered by Senator
Edmunds, Judge Sargent and others commendatory
of the reformatory plan carried out at tills Institution.
The buildings and grounds were next Inspected, and
on leaving the President remarked that he was
most deeply Interested in the school, and wan sure
that Congress would appreciate the good use already
made ol the appropriations for establishing this re
formatory Institution, by increasing Its accommoda
tions and providing for a want long experienced in
the District. The authorities of this school desire
to make it a model alter which similar schools In
the state can copy.

ituuit i? tUo UaptlHt Church.
Ralkioh, Deo. is, 1870.
There was a large congregation present to-day at
the Uaptist church, where it was rumore<l Governor
Holden, who bccame a convert during a recent re
vival. would bo baptized. Under the lnlluenco of
the soul-stlrrlng eloquence of tho Kev. I)r. Karle
the Governor proressed religion, and when that
ciergymau left on Friday last lie made the folio wing
remarks: ?
Dr. Eable? Your visit to our city hns been of
great ami, I hope, of lasting benefit, mm I know
has been Intensely enjoyed. I am pleased with this
meeting to-uiffhi? am glad that It. has been held, and
am glad to see ao many happy face.*. Meetings of
this character are calculated to do Immense good,
and 1 thank you for Inaugurating them. As for my
self, I can assure you that I am very much bene
fited. I leel so and hope that the joyous effects of
your services may he lasting. I am particularly
gr allied at tue nianllestation of interest m iny be
half by very many of my fellow citizens. I
assure them that 1 appreciate it and will endeavor
to profit by it. Assuring you of my great pleasure
In meeting you, ol my deep regret that .you leave so
soon, and that my prayers and those of tills commu
nity will attend you through life for your spiritual
happiness, success and prosperity, 1 bid you adieu.
The text selected to-day by the Kev. Dr. Prltch
ard was from Taul's Epistle to the Ilomans, x? l,
iii the eloquent discourse that followed the cler
gyman seemed to have tho spiritual reconstruction
of the Executive penitent peculiarly at heart. In
deed, it seemed as if the rcmurks were
specially Intended for the Governor ami other
great sinners, in view of their earthly troubles. The
character of St. Paul was referred to as one of the
most beautiful In tte early history of Christianity,
aud I lie Belf-sacrlllcing efforts of the apostle to save
his worst enemies was made an illustration to prove
how essential It is to a true profession of the re
ligion of Christ to pray for these who needed,
whether friend, stranger, or enemy. He exnosted his
hearers to pray for each other, and to rejoice when
the r prayers wore successful in bringing an erring
brother to repentance; and so touching and feeling
were the remarks that many, and even the Gover
nor himself, shed tears. At the con, iiision of the
sermon several persons made a profession of re
ligion. a: id a number were admitted into full fellow
ship in the Church. it was expeoted the Governor
would ho baptized to-night, bui for some reason the
ceremony has been postponed. Dr. Barle's visit
here converted some live hundred persons, among
them the Governor, and this great revival Is still in
progress.
Every foot of available space. Including the aisles
of the church, was crowded, parti&liy in expectation
of witnessing the baptism of the Governor, to attend
the revival and see the Immersion of a number of
both sexes who lately joined tho Church. The cere
luon", which was very solemn and Interesting, was
performed by the pastor, Dr. Pritchard, who re
mained standing in the baptismal pool ncarlv half
an hour. Though the night was intensely* cold
eleven Icmales aud as many males wcie successively
immersed, tne audience all standing and e . cry eye
turn d upon tho prole %sed members of tho Church.
At the conclusion of the ceremony the pastor, still
In the water, pronounced the bencdictlon, when the
congregation broke up.
THE JEr.SFY CUT HOSPITAL FAIR.
The Hudson County Hospital Fair, now in pro
gress at Hoffman's Arcade, Jersey City, opened last
Tuesday under the most favorable auspices, and has

Certainly one of the greatest fairs ever held in Hud

Arcade, the rich and extensive display of goods,
eombinod with the energy and perseverance if tho
lair ladies of the county, liavo combined to cn-jct

A Catholic cemetkut for Sal*.? Considerabia
feeling has been excited among the Koman catholics

onier oi the executors ol the will or Hie Late Kev. A.

years a :o by money collected from his soclei r for a

perty, It was deerted to ihe bishop ol thedio e-eln
trust. In this case n is claimed lhat there was some
Informality in complying with the law, cult rby >1 r.
Roche or Bishop Fit&patrlck, of which the execu

ceedings havo been stayed through the instrumcn*
