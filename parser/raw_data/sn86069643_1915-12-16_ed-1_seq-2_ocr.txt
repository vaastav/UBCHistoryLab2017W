THE REASON WHY.
Has the Courier family ordered anything from a mail
order house or houses? Yes! Why? Because we could
not get all the articles we wanted from our advertisers,
and we are under no obligations to buy from those who
do not. patronize us. We are running a legitimate busi
ness and deserve the patronage of our home people. We
will come as near giving "value received" for every dol
lar spent with us as any merchant in West Liberty, and if
we don't trade with you you have no kick "a-comin.' " ,
PUTTING A PREMIUM ON CRIME.
It is rumored that J. E.
Court Clerk" of Carter county,
good his shortage and go free. If this is done it will not
speak well for the officers charged wilh the enforcement
of the law in that county. So long as men who steal pub
lie money are permitted to escape a term in prison by pay
ing a part or all of the money
will be held in disrepute and other potential thieves be en
couraged to commit like crimes.
A defaulter should not
ansehe coraes of a good family. ; It might be the cause
of somi other member of his family making a like mis
take. .
One of the last acts of Governor McCreary was to
grant unconditional pardons to a half-dozen men convict
ed of murder. We venture the prediction that before two
years have elapsed one or more of these pardoned men will
again be on trial for taking the life of a fellow-man, and
if this prediction comes . true the venerable ex-Governor
will be in a measure responsible for the crime.
When a man, who is mentally 'responsible, commits a
crime he ought to be convicted, and after this is done he
ought to stay convicted until he has paid the full penalty.
APPROVING THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The message which President Wilson delivered to
Congress last week has attracted more attention than any
other message to Congress during the last thirty years.
It is admitted by all that the state papers of President
Wilson rank very high, but none of the others equal the
last one in the epoch making events which it inaugurated.
From every location the great chorus of approval is
swelling wider and wider and louder and louder; for the
country realizes now ad never before that the vast and un
limited wealth of this great country is "no longer safe"
without adequate defense.
The American idea of preparedness is to be. a citizen
ry trained to arms so that if we are attacked, as some of
the nations of Europe have been attacked, we will be
ready to meet the aggressor with trained men. President
Wilson is acting on the same principle as any city, which
organizes a police and lire department for the protection
of life and property.
The part of President Wilson's message , which flays
the "disloyal citizens," that is, the hyphenated variety,
was most warmly applauded by Congress. There is an
urgent necessity for a law making it an "act of treason"
'for anyone to injure the industries of this country with a
view of conferring any kind of benefit on a foreign coun
try. Congress will undoubtedly pass a law so drastic that
that the "hyphenated animals" which have been abusing
' their privileges in this cduntry will be shot in the future
ani their property confiscated if any more activity is in
dulged in resulting in or aiming at violence of any sort,
for the benefit of a foreign nation.

! KENTUCKY'S STATE
DEPARTMENT OF
PUBLIC ROADS
(By Hon. James B. McCreary,
Governor of Kentucky.)
A State Department of Public
Roads was advocated by me when
I was a candidate for Governor of
Kentucky. After I was elected I
recommended In my message to ine
General Assembly the enactment of
a law providing for a Department
of Public toads, and an appropria
tion and a proper and comprehen
sive act was paused.
The people of Kentucky are in
favor of good roads. They' know
that good roads mean a decrease
In the expense of hnullng products
to market and in getting goods
home from the place of purchase.
They know that good roads in
crease the value of farms, mean
bettor access to ' schools and to
churches, and better and more at
tractive environments.
The Commissioner of Public
Iloads appointed by me has been
active and successful in his organ
ization, lie has sent bulletins and
literature and has furnished plans

and specifications and estimates of
cost for many bridges and made
many surveys for sites, assisted in
'road and bridge building, and the
sentiment in favor of good public
roads has been, greatly strength
ened. The law creating the department
sot aside from the license tax on
automobiles, which constitutes the
State Hoad Fund, the amount which
has been necessary to make the
road service efficient.
The new road law In Kentucky
has met but little opposition, and
whore it hns been given a fair and
Impartial trial by county officials,
and ihe-cuiili:i" 1'OUd eilglheersTuve"
bocn given an opportunity to per
form their duties unhampered, It
has been entiroly satisfactory.
The State of Kentucky no doubt,
will continue the progressive poli
cies so successfully instituted.
A system of good roads is the
basis of the country's progress and
upon this largely depends its ma
terial development nnil prosperity.
Pifblic roads have been compared
to the veins and aiteriea In the
human body, by which the circula
tion is carried on, and when they
are clogged, or are not In good con
dition, the ucuul functions are im
peded and vitally diminished. .
1 am in favor of the United States
Government aiding, to a proper ex
tent, in the building of roads.
Largo amounts of money are appro
priated annually by Congress for
rivers and harbors, for irrigation"
and for government buildings, and
in the samo line Congress should
appropriate money to aid in the
construction of public ropds.
ThiB can never bo an Ideal country
to live in until it Is Interlaced with a
network of highways and the high
ways so marked as to direct tlio trav
eler which road to take to reach his
destination.
' A man who is opposed to road Im

Never, can wo have excellent roads
until wo adopt a patrol system of re

course is purely a myth, fcr the
very good reason that snnle"
have no less. Strictly speakitip,
they walk on their ribs.
A snake's ribs are jointed at
the backbone, and extend down
over each side of the body. The
ends are connected . with plates
on the under side of tl c snake.
These plates have projecting
edges, which take hold of the
surface of objects beneath the
reptile. When the snake moves
his ribs, therefore, he can move
forward just as readily and as
swiftly as though ho had 1,000
legs.
Terha'ps you have tried the ex
periment of putting a snake on a
smooth plate of glass and watch
ing its vain attempts to run. The
reason that the . snake cannot
move is because the projecting
edges of these plates can find
nothing to take hold of on the
smooth surface. -Philadelphia
