I'll K MAYOR'S JJPVOim:MXX2S.
Mayor-elect Martin has on the whole
done well with the appointments
Which he Is obliged Under the charter
to make incidental to his taking of
fice. It Is practically Impossible for
any one, no matter how tactful and
careful, to distribute the favors of an
administration in such a way as to
give universal satisfaction. Mr. Martin
has been importuned by scores of ap
plicants for office to recognize their
claims to recognition. He could not
have gratified all of them had there
been twice the number of plums on
the tree. It Is therefore gratifying in
the highest degree to the community
at large that he has acted In such a
manner as to insure the intelligent
government of the city during the ap
proaching two years of his term.
Naturally the office of corporation
counsel has been most under specula
tive consideration by the people of the
city. With the growth of the city that
has become an office, of major import
ance. As the needs of the city multiply
and as restless souls undertake to solve
problems in an experimental and novel
way it has become necessary more
and more to rely upon a legal adviser
Of first rate ability. Mr. Daggett has
served vthe municipality during the
prolonged reign of Mayor Studley with
eal and fidelity, succeeding in that of
fice former Judge Robertson, who had
Bet a fast pace for any one to follow.
In selecting Mr. Rogers to succeed Mr.
Daggett Mayor-elect Martin has done
well. A former officer of the city gov
ernment and himself a lawyer by edu
cation arid experience, Mr. ' Martin
could Scarcely have gone wrong In the
selection of a' legal adviser. And It is
highly creditable to him that while
casting about for the Tight man he
paid only incidental attention to the
partisanship of his appointee. Mr.
Rogers is a Democrat in his view of
government and has retained his faith
In Democratic instruments of govern
ment, though claiming the right to act
t Independently when In his judgment
the public welfare demands It As
the counsel for the corporation he will
bring to bear upon the duties of his
office a trained mind and ' a broad
knowledge of the laws of the' State
and of the city charter. .We congratu
late both Mr. Martin and Mr. Rogers
upon the happy outcome of their con
sideration of the public.
" The appointments In other respects
are pral&eworthy.. Mr. Foley will make
a good director of public works and
Mr. crown will make a competent
superintendent of streets. In addition
to their capabilities both of these gen
tlemen have been hard and efficient
workers In the ranks of the party
which now controls the city. Mr.
O'Meara is another who deserves well
f the new administration and will as
assistant corporation counsel give ex
cellent service. Mr. Doughan will bring
'to bear upon his duty as assessor t
level head and good sense, The conv
mlsslojiers generally have been select
d with discrimination, though doubt
less those whose task it is not to fill
them may be able to show wherein'
a more comprehensive scheme of se
lection would have been better for the
r&rty. Their disappointment will, how
ever, live but a few weeks at the out
side. A period of efficiency will remove
whatever unpleasant Impression may
now be felt. The new mayor is to be
praised In particular for his appoint
ment of Benjamin R. English to the
library board. Mayor Studley made
mistake in Judgment when he removed
him. Mr. English's knowledge of
building will now come into useful
play in the construction of the new 11
',. brary. The reappointment of Colonel
Rutherford Trowbridge to the park
commission recognises one of the most
faithful public officials in the city. And
o if It were necessary or we had space
to give, we could find something com
plimentary to say of each appointee. It
would be a pleasure to do so, especially
as It would tend to allay a queer feel
Ing some people have that the re-es
, tftbltshment of the Democratic party
necessarily means the beginning of the
end of all things desk-able. It will now
be seen that men are pretty much the
same the world over, and that the
yeneer of partisanship when removed
discloses the same ambition to succeed j
underneath. In other words, there Is
every prospect that during the next
two years the city of New Haven will
have reason to be satisfied with Its
political government, and it will be the
pleasure, as it is the duty of The Jour
nal and Courier to support the admin
istration in every undertaking for the
public good.
It Is more of a Job than It used to
be to govern the city of New Haven,
and there are more ways for the gov
erning administration to commend It
self to the people. It is at the same
time a comparatively easy task if those
who are burdened with the cares of
office will at the outset of their career
regard their work as essentially a busi
ness undertaking. Not a single one of
the mayor's appointees is to be asked
to consider a political theory or prin
ciple any more than he would be so
asked had he been given a position In
e the large factories of the city.
No one would expect Mr. Rogers to
give a political opinion when asked to
interpret the laws, and no one should
expect the board of public works to be
managed In other than a business spir
it. If the incoming administration will
only accept the rule for Its guidance
which is tho rule of business it will
find before It Is through that It has
been clever as a political leader. There
are more votes in a business adminis
tration than in a political one, as his
tory shows.
The Georgia man who has just been
"pardoned" out of the penitentiary
because after being there twenty
years it has been discovered that he
wasn't guilty probably has about as
much respect for the written law as
some juries have and as much re
spect for the Jury system as some law
yers have.
A JtAPID COVMXY.
This Is a rapid country. Only one
short month ago we were In the
dumps, the doldrums, and, as some
went so far as to say, the devil's grip.
But we have squirmed out pretty well.
There has been a very cheering and
profitable rise in stocks and , bonds,
money is easier, the Secretary of the
Treasury has discovered . that only
25,000,000 of Panama bonds are
necessary, when he started out with
the notion that $50,060,000 were, and
he will issue only $15,000,000 of the
three per cent, certificates of Indebted
ness of which he originally offered
$100,000,000. Business Is much more
confident than It was, and the great
scare now looks about as ridiculous
as, In a sense, it was. Soon everything
will be quiet for awhile, and we shall
perhaps have a little peace until the
cry of the campaign orator is heard
in the land.
Of course it will not quite do to as
sume that nothing real has happened
in finance and business, but the per
formance was a good deal less real
than It seemed to be. The indications
are that the depression .which usually
follows such performances Is not going
to be serious and prolonged. That
it will not be every well-disposed per
son will hope.
WHO'Lli HE .34 St A ClAVS?
Christmas is coming. The bells will
soon be ringing both at the churches
and in the hands of the ' Salvation
Army lassies while they stand watch
at their contribution pots as they hang
from the familiar tripods at almost
every busy street corner in the big
cities of the country. We can probably
all agree that there is no legendary
hero of childhood, no good fairy, nor
spirit of goodness that can be compar
ed with Santa Claus. In him is a friend
of childhood that stands without com
parison. The. Hiawatha of the Indian
children, the Apollo and the Muses
that the Greeks were wont to lnvocate,
even the latter-day Peter Pan, hasten
into ' Insignificance when the spirit of
Santa Claus comes to mind. A sad day
of childhod it is, indeed, when there
come doubts of his existence; a sad
der one it is when we learn that he is
only "make believe."
At just about this time every year
the postofflces of the land are begin
ning te bebeseiged with hosts of let
ters that hail from young and tender
hearts, children blessed In their Ig
norance that Santa Claus is not a
reality but rather one of the younger
hearted pillars of the church, who has
consented to don the whiskers and the
red cloak and to carry the pack ot
toys and appear from within a papier
mache chimney Just so that the fire
at the altar of the dearest and most
lovable of saints may be kept burning
brightly in the hearts of the children
still.
Our news columns tell something of
the story of these Santa Claus letters
as they come to the New Haven post
office, each breathing a story of child
hood wants from church chimes and
automobiles to mittens. True philan
thropy is something not far short of a
fine art' We cannot but believe that
Nathan Straus' idea was an excellent
one last year when he conceived the
plan of getting from the New Tork
nostoffice at least some of the letters
sent in this way to Santa Qaus. The
writers of these letters were remem
bered when the great natal day rolled
around Just as If the gifts had come
from a living Santa. The spirit of the
genial saint was turned Into real flesh
and blood for just so many children.
Surely this was a true, well-conceived
philanthropy.
There seems to be no reason to think
a similar scheme could not be follow
ed out here In New Haven by some
lover or lovers of childhood. The New
Haven postofflce authorities have said
that they could make arrangements so
that any self-appointed Santa Clauses,
who wish to undertake the matter and
can prove to the postofflce that they
are in earnest, can have access to these
Santa Claus letters. Who will step for
ward to do his little to make Christ
mas morn a time of gladness In many
a New Haven home which would not
be &uch otherwise ?
One of the learned and distinguish
ed professors advises women to stop
getting their opinions from their hus
bands. When and where did they eo
get them?
ATTACKING THE JPHF.SIDBXT.
There Is a lack of sobriety in some
of the attacks being made upon Presi
dent Roosevelt by the Irritated news
papers. He is not the greatest man that
ever lived though he has enjoyed a
popularity very few men In history
enjoyed. He has a remarkable capacity
for work which shows itself best In the
multiplicity ot things he attends to. He
believes in himself and Is to that ex
tent self-centered In his judgments,
but he is not what one newspaper call
ed him the other day, "a conscience
less and reckless demagogue."
We have had occasion to criticise
the President and at times to ques
tion his judgment, but it has never en
tered our head to suspect the charac
ter of his motives or to attribute to
him undertakings which are selfish
and sordid In their character. We have
watched too many newspapers wink
incredulously with each fresh refer
ence to a possible third term to mis
understand thtir meaning, though not
one of them has the slightest ground
for believing that he did not mean ex
actly what he said when he declined to
be again a candidate for the presiden
cy. Our attention has been called to
the latest "Wutlerson outbreak In which
he sees the introduction of a third,
fourth and fifth term ending finally in
a life term, without or with heir pre
suniptlves, as the. conditions may war
rant. Says Mr. Watterson in the col
umns of his newspaper: "Give him a
third term, a fourth and a fifth and
In case he survived those life tenure
would, not only come easy,; but he a
matter of course."
We are led to resent these sharp as
saults upon President Roosevelt from
a sense of disturbed justice. His mis
takes are the mistakes of ah earnest
and impetuous man, riot those of a
schemer and conspirator. The Amerl
can people make no mistake in their
combined Judgment of their public
men and In this Instance they have
concluded that Theodore Roosevelt is
henest and sincere, whether able and
Indispensable or not, and while there
Is no reason to believe that they are
faithfully represented by the persistent
thlfd-termers the one th.ng that would
lead them to accept the proposition Is
the continued abuse of tho man film
slf. Of all agencies that of the news'
paper .should be careful not to oxng
gerate its opposition or Its support, for
the American public hna eyts and it
both sees and understands. The temper
amental fitness of Mr. Roosevelt for
executive office Is debatable as are his
political policies. These the people de
light in considering, but they draw a
thin, sharp iln st, slanur aid that h
Just what many editors are guilty of
to-day from an M-rormed judgment
of his destructive genius.
About one-half of Chicago Is now
forbidden territory for the liquor traf
fic, but business Is about twice as live
ly In the other half.
3 HE GOLFS ALL.
When England's House of Lords set
tles a legal question it may bi- regard
ed as settled. So the great felt-ball
controversy which has long been going
on is ended. The House of Ln'cln has
decided, as two lower couru had al
ready declared, that tho patent fflii't
fall for want of subject mattv All the
legal authorities are agreed that there
was never any ground for gran. let; tt
patent at all; that what was done In
this case had been done many times
before by different people, and that the
Haskell balj was merely the applica
tion to an old and conservative game
like golf of principles that had been
already adopted In other pastimes. The
decision will be good news to golfers,
for all the world Is set free to make
balls with a rubber core, and, in one
form or another, these have practical
ly superseded the "gutty" of other
days, as that had driven its predeces
sor of packed feathers out of the field.
Vast sums depended upon this decis
ion. The profits of golf-ball making
have been shown to be enormous. Now
that anybody can manufacture the
rubber-cored ball and no royalties
have to be paid, the golfer will be
certain to get just the article that he
finds best suited to himself at a merely
commercial profit.
So progress Justice and the inter
ests of a noble game.
JOY IS CHICAGO.
There is Joy In Chicago and woe in
Kansas City, St. Louis and a few other
ambitious towns. Chicago has been
chosen as the place of meeting of the
Republican National Convention next
June. And now that the choice has
been made all but the severely disap
pointed will feel that it Is on the
whole a wise one. Chicago is a center
of population. It is a railroad center.
It is near the center of the country,
and thus ' as convenient for all who
will attend the convention as any
place would be. It went into the con
test for the convention with the real
Chicago spirit,i and it deserves Its suc
cess. Perhaps Kansas City will be consol
ed by being chosen as the place for
the Democratic National' Convention.
It has been andmay be again; If it
Isn't it will have to wait another four
years, when It can Justly make more
"claims" than It can now.
JTOJB THlllVI, ZOWLY riXAXClEn.
A good many people in this big and
airy country are so ambitious to be
high financiers that they entirely Ig
nore the money there Is In being a
lowly financier and In the end they are
worse off than they would have been
with less ambition and more sense. The
other day the story was told of the
Massachusetts man who had become
Independent by saving twenty-five
thousand ten-cent pieces and buying a
farm with them. Now comes from Ta
coma the story of Joe Philipi, an Ital
ian bootblack who recently sold his
stand to the Bootblacks' Trust, formed
by Greeks to eliminate negroes and
Italians from the business, and retired
with a fortune of $60,000. Phllipl be
gan by earning nickels and dimes, and
saving them, His next step toward In
dependence was making small Invest
ments In real estate. Tacoma, and
Phlllpl's business, grew substantially.
His Investments brought good returns.
He retires with a fortune sufficient to
make him independent In this coun
try or wealthy In Italy.
These Incidents show what can be
and is done. They also show what is
not done by people who are much too
smart to come down to any such
trifling. . ' '.'
At last accounts Mr. Bryan hadn't
time to read the President's message

SOME or TB lTASBIireiOX XAIK
It Is a cold day, and also a warm
day when they don't find something
thrilling: to talk about in Washington.
Members of Congress are now asking
whether the;imUHary authorities fear
that this country will soon become "In
volved In a war." This questioning Is
based on the fact that the War depart
ment has asked for the enormous sum
of $38,400, 000( for fortifications land
other defensive,; military works, which
Is more' than fire times the amount ap
propflated for 'the current year. This
estimate, most1' of which Is for pro
posed defenses in the Philippines and
other insular possessions, has caused
no end of talk among the Republican
leaders In Congress. The various ie-
partment officers have asked for near
ly $100,000,000 more money next year
than was appropriated for the present
year, and a good part ot this sum is
represented In the demands f army
officers who build guns and forts. Jn
view of the generally known w'bh of
the leaders to economize the heavy
estimates for war purposes have cr
ated some apprehension. "If there is
real necessity for these enormous x
I'Cnditures for war purposes," gnys a
member of the House Committee
Appropriations, :'lt ought to ho stilted
In plain language. I don't bliew Con
cress will approve the estin uts for
$38, 400,000 for fortlflcationi and wa
supplies tins yfea,- In view of the fact
that we gave only $6,800,000 for 1 H'S
If this money ifc required, however, In
order to put the nation In a stato -if
defense agamst ti probable fo a sink
ment to thin iffect ought to be mnile
It will be necessary In order to bring
forth the money."

Six years ago he wrote a tale
Which had a most tremendous sale;
It brimmed with punfent epigrams,
'Twas called "The Marys and Their
Lambs."
The scene was laid in some domain
The search for which would be In
vain
Twas, said each bookish oracle,
Historical.
One year went by. 'twas dramatized
The critics all were muclj surprised
When public, plulplt and the press
Declared it was a huge success. 1
The author, too, was greatly moved
At seelnj what a hit It proved.
He took, though, with all loyalty
His royalty.
The second yar it whooped along,
Also In expurgated form
lit took the goodly folk by storm:
The third year added to his fame
.The tale was made a parlor game;
;The book, Instead of thinning out,
was winning out.
The fourth year it was lectured on
With slides In a stereopticon;
The fifth year he much cash derived ,
The first edition was revived.
And now a corps of brainy men
Are working on the thin? again
No doubt 'twill leave the hopper a
Grand opera.

Madison's Grave.
(Boston Transcript.)
Some years ago when congress, hav-
lng had Its attention called to the fact
that the grave of Madison was unmark
ed, appropriated a small sum for ft
shaft to be erected to his memory there
was a gathering of the Madison clan at
the old homestead that a suitable epl
taph might be seuotea. K&crt oi tne re
latives came with a verse or an In
scription, some of which were so long
that the base of the proposed monu
ment would have not been large enough
to. contain the lines. The last ef the
clan to speak was a aistant cougin or
Maillson. When he was called upon he
had this to say, and he said it in such
tone of finality mat ne carriea tne
day: "No epitaph Is , necessary. The
one wora Maaison is numciom. no
ws. the first of the line end we all
know he Is the Inst." There was ne
anclftusfi. but the suggestion was
mlont-rf. President Roosevelt in ms
pilgrimage to-day found the one wora
rWadUon" at the base of the shaft
which marks the ar&ve of a predecessor
in the White House.

Although the numerous bills which
will be Introduced In the corning ses
slon of congress to curb speculation are
not likely to meet with more success
than farmerly, they will serve as safety
valves for the escape ef much windy
debate. It is already pretty evident
that there will be little besides talk In
the coming aosslon, and marginal sales
of stocks, puts and calls and the like
devious of modern speculation will fur
nish 8 good a theme for discussion as
ny other, notwithstanding that it ha
been thoroughly thrashed out already.
This will be especially the case since
the stsnd-patters ln congress have both
