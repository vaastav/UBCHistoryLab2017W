j \\\, WASHINGTON. Dec. 3.— The most
I important piece of newt In the California
colony to-night Is that the Southern Pa
! dflc Company has on foot a plan to re-
J organize the California delegation. Word
, was received to-day from New York that
; some big banking institutions of that city
j are behind this proposed reorganization.
; and the Southern Pacific's legal depart
; ment In the Mills building. New York,
! with CharleB Tweed -X3 Its head, is now
j drawing up the papers in the matter. De
1 tails of the proposed reconstruction can
| not be disclosed at this time, but, in gen
eral. It may be said that the capital stock
will be divided into different classes. Tho
purpose of this is said to be to niako It
possible to pay dividends on parts of
stock without having to pay on other
parts.
The present capital stock is $250,000,000,
but all the stock Is of one kind. Thus far
it has not been found possible to make
dividend returns to shareholders, but four
per cent can be insured on at least $100,
000.000 by cutting the stock up into differ
ent classes.
The holders of a majority of the stock
have consented to this arrangement, and
of course this includes the Huntingtcn
holdings. It is not known Just what con
sideration will be shown stockholders for
accepting Junior securities, but unless
their Interests are caiefully looked after
the scheme will have no chance of being
adopted. There must and will be an
• equitable adjustment, according to one of
Honors for Roberts.

HOW goes the little "Fortune Tel
ler." frivolous, frothy, piquar.t
little fantaay, after a solid three
weeks of grand opera according
to Grau? -
By my halidome and by my troth, ex
ceeding well:
It is to laugh, the "Fortune Teller." and j
perhaps no prettier or happier contrast j
to the lart three weeks' musical pro- j
examine could have been put on than this
newly imported Victor Herbert success?.
The prolific and versatile composer, sym
phony writer, conductor of one of the |
l>eet symphony orchestras in the country,
composer of pome of the most popular
hght operas now being sung— has written
nothing more charming from the comic
op^ra standpoint than the "Fortune Tel
ler," and the "book" by Harry B. Smith
is c-ramraod with good things.
The opera takes a good company and a
hig company for its handling, and little
Alice Nielsen, late chorus girl of San
KranciPoo and a Oalifornlan. brings both
with her in Her first appearance as a star
in her native State. It is indeed a rarely
good company ¦which supports Miss Niel
sen, numbering among Its members three
excellent comedians — John C. Slavln, Jo
t-eph Cawthorn and Joseph Herbert;
Cowles. the eweet singer; Viola Gillette,
% large and well trained chorus with any
number of pretty girls and the piquant,
fetching, chic little prima donr.a herec-lf.
Miss Xlelsen has a dainty part in the
pretty opera, or. rather, a kaleidoscopic
collection of dainty parts as a gyp.sy girl,
ballet girl, soldier boy and what not. She
is th* 1 smartest, nattiest little wearer of
the shoulder straps and trews imagina
ble, taps the tambourine like a true Ro
many lass, brings down the house with
the inevitable Cakewalk, which only Grau
refuses us! She has pretty songs gaiore
throughout the opera and sings them in
sparkling fashion. One song in particu
lar will catch the larger crowd later, as
It did the audience last night, where Miss
Nielsen demurely explains that it is- al
v.-ays best "to do what one is told, for
grandma told me so." And a serenade of
nil countries, encored seven or eight
times, has a catchy melody that sticks.
Mi?s Nielsen has certainly naught to
oompJain of in her reception last evening.
<ir any other evening of her appearance
here, ar.d the little Californian star
to appreciate the very hearty ap
plause that greeted her efforts.
Eugene Co-wles has an excellent oppor
1 unity in the role, of the srypsy. Sandor.
\\f has many good songs. "My Gypsy
Sweetheart." "A Gypsy Bold," sung wi:h
that satisfying hass of his. Richie Line;
as the captain-lover sings a weak tenor,

ter; Cawthorn as a gypey with a Flie
gende Blatter accent, and Herbert as the
lanky Polish composer, kept the house In
roars cf laughter from start to finish.

Mr. Furst has furnished some appro
priate music and the opening tableaux of
Fujiyama by sunrise, at noon and by
moonlight help to give atmosphere to the
play. The setting of the piece Itself Is
both quaint and beautiful and the results
obtained in the New York and London
productions have evidently been carefully
utilized by the stage management. The
only objectionable feature last night was
the undue time consumed In making the
light changes— unless perhaps the most
prolonged of these was an attempt to con
vey to the audience an impression that
an entire night hail passed during some
five stage minute. If this effect was de
liberately aimed at it was a failure, as all
such attempts must be.
Miss Crosby played with ease ana
charm, though with &o pronounced an ac
cent that many of her words were indis
tinct. That is a mistake, I am sure. In
such a highly conventionalized produc
tion, if we grant that a Japanese char
acter may speak English at all. it should
be English Nipponized just enough to give
a mere suggestion of foreignness and no
more. If more is attempted we get an
often unintelligible and therefore obscur
ing dialect. L. DU PONT SYLE.
of the situations. Miss Convere had little
to <!o save to look pretty and intelligent;
that came to her without effort.
"Madame Butterfly," the little tragedy
that followed, was really a one-part piece
for Miss Crosby, who played the title role.
Humorous treatment of Japanese subjects
has long been common on our stage, but
this is the first play, within my knowledge
at least, where a tragic treatment has
been attempted — and successfully. Cho-
Cho-San's belief that her lover will re
turn, her inability to realize that men
were decivers ever, her joy at his sup
posed returning to her and her hopeless
grief when she learns he can never again
be hers— all these are of the essence of
universal tragedy, as true in Japan as in
London or in New York. The dramatic
setting in which Mr. Belasco ha3 placed
his theme lend% it enough of novelty to
make interesting what were otherwise a
merely ordinary repetition of a thousand
times-told tale.

of Havana at 12 noon on the first Monday of
November, in the year 1900, to frame and adopt
a constitution for the people of Cuba and as
a part" thereof to provide for and agree with
the Government of the United States upon the
relations to exist between that Government
and the Government of Cuba and to provide
for the election by the people of officers under
such constitution and the transfer of govern
ment to the officers so elected.
"The election wjll be held In the several vot
ing precincts of the Island under and pursuant
to the provisions of the electoral law of April
18. 1900, and the . amendenta thereof."
CUBAN CONVENTION.
The election was held on the 15th of Septem
ber and the convention assembled on the 6th
of November, 1900, and is now in session."
In calling the convention to order, the mili
tary Governor of Cuba . made the following
statement:
'.'As military Governor of the. Island, repre
senting the President of the United States, I
call this convention to order. It will be your
duty, first to frame and adopt- a constitution
for Cuba and when that has been done to for
mulate what. In your opinion, ought to be the
relations between Cuba and the United States.
"The constitution , must be adequate to secure
a stable, orderly and a free government.
"When you. have formulated the relations
which In your opinion ought to exist between
Cuba and th© United States, the Government
of the United States will doubtless take such
action on Its part as shall lead to a final and
authoritative agreement between the people
of the two countries. to the promotion of their
common interests.
"All friends of Cuba will follow your dellb-
I eratlona with the ¦ deepest Interest, earnestly
I desiring that you shall reach Just conclusions
| and that by the dignity, individual self-re-
Btraint and wise conservatism which shall
characterize your proceedings the capacity of
the Cuban people for representative govern
ment may be slgnall] Illustrated.
"The fundamental distinction between true
representative government and dictatorship is
that the former is representative of the peo
ple. In whatever position the official is he con
fine* himself strictly within the limits of his
j denned powers. Without such restraint there
can be no free constitutional government.
"Under the order pursuant to which you
have been elected and convened you have no
duty and no authority to take part in the
present government ot the Island. Your pow
ers are strictly limited by the terms of that
order.
"When the convention concludes Its labor
I will transmit to Congress the constitution as
framed by the convention for its consideration
and for such action as It may deem advisable."
I • renew the recommendation made in my
special message of February 10, 1S93, as to the
necessity for cable communication between
the United States and Hawaii, with extension
to Manila. Since then circumstances have
strikingly emphasised this need. Surveys have
shown the entire feasibility of a chain of
cables which at each stopping place shall touch
on American territory, so that the system shall
be under our own complete control. Manila,
once within telegraphic reach, connection with
the systems of the Asiatic coast would be in
creased and profitable opportunities for a more
direct cable route from our shores to the
Orient than Is now afforded by the trans-
Atlantic, continental and trans-Atlantic lines. I
urge attention to this Important matter.
ARMY AND FORTIFICATIONS.
The present strength of the army is. 100.000
men— 65,000 regulars and 35,000 volunteers. Un
der the act of March 2, 1S99, on the 30th of
June next the present volunteer force will be
discharged and the regular army reduced to
2447 officers and 29,025 enlisted men.
In 1S8S a board of officers convened by Presi
dent Cleveland adopted a comprehensive scheme
of coast defense fortifications, which involved
the out'.ay of something more than $100,000,000.
This plan received the general approval of
Congress, and since then regular appropriations
havo been made and the work of fortification
has steadily progressed.
More than $6^.000,000 haa been Invested in a
great number of forts and guns, with all the
complicated and scientific machinery and elec
trical appliances necessary for their use. The
proper care of this defensive machinery re
quires men trained In its use. The number of
men necessary to perform this duty alone is
ascertained by the War Department at a min
imum allowance to be 18,420.
There are fifty-eight or more military posts
in the United States other than the coast de
fense fortifications.
The number of these posts is being constantly
Increased by Congress. More than $22,000,000
has been expended In building and equipping
them and they can only be cared for by the
regular army. The pests now In existence and
others to be built provide accommodations for
and If fully garrisoned require 26.000 troops.
Many of these posts are along our frontier or
at important strategic points, the occupation
of which U necessary.
TROOPS IN {THE ISLANDS.
We have in Cuba between D0O0 and 6000
troope. For the present our troops In that isl
and cannot be withdrawn or materially dim
inished and certainly not until the conclusion
of the labors of the constitutional convention
now in session and a government provided by
the new constitution Bhall have been estab
lished and Its stability assured.
In Porto Rico. we have reduced the garrisons
to 1C36. which include S96 native troops. There
is no room for further reduction here. We will
be required to keep a considerable force In the
Philippine Islands for some time to come.
From the best Information obtainable we shall
m-eil there for the immediate future from 50,000
to eo.ox) men. I am sure the number may be
reduced as the- Insurgents shall come to ac
knowledge the authority of the United States,
of which there are assuring Indications.
It must be apparent that we will require an
army of about 60,000 and that during present
crndttlons in Cuba and the Philippines the
Piesldent should have authority to Increase the
fr.rce to the present number of 100,000. Included
in this number, authority should be given to
rclee native troops In the_ Philippines up to
15.000, which the Taft commission believe will
be more effective in detecting and suppressing
guerrillas, assassins and ladrones than our own
soldiers. ,•'''
The full,, discussion of this subject by the
Secretary of War in his annual report is called
to your earnest attention.
I renew the recommendation made In my last
annual message that 'Congress provide a spe - 1
clal medal of honor for the volunteers, regulars,
sollors and marines on duty in the Philippines
who voluntarily remained in the service after
their terms of enlistment had expired.
I favor the recommendation of the Secretary
of War for the detail of officers from the line
of the army when vacancies occur In the Adju
tant-General's Department, Inspector-General's
Department, Quartermaster-General's Depart
ment, Subsistence Department, Pay Depart
ment, Ordnance Department and Signal Corps.
The army cannot be too highly commended for
Its faithful and effective services in active mil
itary operations in the field and the difficult
work of Its able administration.
The continued and rapid growth of the postal
service' Is' a sure index of the great and In
creasing business activity of the country. Its
mest striking new development is the exten
sion of rural free delivery. This has come
almost wholly within the last year. At the be-
Clnning of the fiscal year 1893-1500, the number
of routes In operation was' only 391, and most
of these had been running less than twelve
months. On the 15th of November, 1900, tha
number had Increased to 2611, reaching into
forty-four States and Territories and serving a
population of j 1,801,624. The number of appli
cations now pending and awaiting action nearly
equals all those granted up to the present time,
and by the close of the current fiscal year about
4000 routes will have been established, providing
for the dally delivery of malls at the scattered
hemes of about three and a half millions of
rural population. This service ameliorates the
isolation of farm life, conduces to good roads
8nd quickens and extends the dissemination of
general Information. Experience thus far has
tended to allay the apprehension that It would
be so expensive as to forbid Its general adop
tion or make it a general burden. Its actual
application has shown that It increases postal
receipts and can be accompanied by reduc
t'ons in other branches of the service, so that
the augmented revenues and the accomplished
savings together naturally reduce the net cost.
The evidences which point to these conclusions
are presented In detail In the annual report of
the Postmaster-General, which, with Its rec
ommendations, is recommended to the consider
ation of the Congress. The full development
of this special service, however, requires such a
large outlay of money that it should be under
taken only after a careful study and thorough
understanding of all that it involves.

In my annual message of December 5, lS'Js.
I called attention to the necessity for some
amendment of the alien contract law. Ther-»
still remain Important features of the rightful
application of the eight hour law for the bene

and I again commend these subjects to the
careful attention of the- Congress.
That there may be secured the best servlc*
possible In the Philippines. I issued under date
of November 19. 1900. the following order:
"The United States Civil Service Commission
is directed to render sneh service as may bo
practicable to the Civil Service Board created
under the act of the United States Philippines
Commission for the establishment and main
tenance of an honest and efficient civil service
in the Philippine Islands, and for that purpose
to conduct examinations for the civil service
of the Philippine Islands, upon the request cf
the Civil Service Board of said islands, undor
such regulations as may be agreed upon by tha
said board and the said United States Civil
Service Commission," ~* » : :
CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION.
The Civil Service Commission is greatly em
barrassed In its work for want of an adequate
permanent force for clerical and other assist
ance. Its needs are fully set forth In Its re
port. I invite attention to the report, and
especially urge upon the Congress that this im
portant bureau of the public service, which
passes upon the qualifications and character
of so large a number of officers and employes
of the Government, should be supported by Ml
needed appropriations to secure promptness and
efficiency.
I am very much lmoressed with the state
ment made by the head* ot all departments of
the urgent necessity of a hall of public records.
In every departmental building In Washing
ton, so far as I am informed, the space for
official records is not only exhausted, but th-i
walls of rooms are lined with shelves, the
middle floor space of many rooms is filled with
file cases, and garrets and basements which
were never Intended and are unfitted for their
accommodation are crowded with them. Aside
from the Inconvenience there is great danger
not only from fire but from the weight of these
records upon timbers not intended for their
support. There should b«- a separate bulldln*
especially designed for the purpose of receiv
ing and preserving the annually accumulating
archleves of the several executive departments
Such a hall need not be a costly structure, but
should be so arranged as to admit of enlarge
ment ' from time to time. I urgently recom
mend that the Congress take early action In
this matter.

I commend to the favorable action of the

uance and increased appropriations by the Con
gress for the carrying on of the work. On Jure
30, 1900, there were thirty-seven forest reserves,
created by Presidential proclamations under

INCBEASE OF PENSION BOLL.
At the end of the fiscal year there were on
the pension roll 993,225 names, a net increase
of 2010 over the fiscal year 1899. The number
added to the rolls during the year was 45,344.
The amount disbursed for army pensions dur
ing this year was $134,700,594 24 and for navy
pensions $3,761,033 41, a total of $138,462,130 65,
leaving an unexpended balance of I5.S12.76S 25
to be conveyed Into the treasury, which shows
an Increase over the previous year's expenditure
of $107,077 70. There were 684 names added to
the rolls during the year by special acts passed
at the first session of the Fifty-sixth Congress.
The act of May, 1900, among other things,
provides for an extension of income to widows
pensioned under said act to $250 per annum.
The Secretary of the Interior believes that by
the operations of this act the number of per
sons pensioned under it will increase and the
increased annual payment for pensions will be
between $3,000,000 and $4.00O.0C0.
The Government Justly appreciates the serv
ices of its soldiers and sailors by making pen
sion payments liberal beyond precedent to the
men, their widows and orphans.
There were 26,540 letters patent granted. In
cluding reissues and designs, during the fiscal
year ended June 30, ibw, 18G0 trademarks, 6S2
Ubf'Is and ninety-three prints registered.
The number of patents which expired was
19.98S. The total receipts for patents were 11.
3IS.228 35. The expenditures were $1,247,527 68.
showing a surplus of $110,400 77.
The attention of Congress is called to the
report of the Secretary of the Interior touch
ing the necessity for the further establishment
of schools In the Territory of Alaska and favor
able action is Invited thereon.
Much interesting information is given in the
report of the Governor of Hawaii as to the
progress and developments of- the islands dur
ing, the period from July 7, 1893, the date of
the approval of the Joint resolution of Con
gress providing for their annexation, up to
April 80, 1900. the date of the approval of the
act providing a government for the territory
and thereafter.
The last Hawaiian census, taken in the year
1S96, gives a total population of 1C9.020, of
which 31,019 were native Hawaiian*. The num_
ber of Americans reported was 84S5. The re
sults of the Federal census taken this year
show the islands to have a total population of
1E4.001, showing an increase over that reported
In 1S36 of 44.9S1 or 41.2 per cent.
There has been marked progress In the edu
cational, agricultural and railroad development
of the Islands. *
In the territorial act of April 30, 1900. section
7 of said act repeats chapter 34 of the civil
laws of Hawaii, whereby the Government was
to assist in encouraging and developing the
agricultural resources of the republic, especial
ly irrigation. The Governor of Hawaii recom
mends legislation looking to the " development
of such water supply as may exist on the
public lands, with a view of promoting land
settlement. The earnest consideration of Con
gress Is Invited to this Important recommenda
tion and others, as embodied in the report of
the Secretary of the Interior.
The director of the census states that the
work In connection with the twelfth census Is
progressing favorably. This national under
taking, ordered by Congress each decade, has
finally resulted in the collection of an aggre
gation of statistical facts to determine the In
dustrial growth of the country, its manufactur
ing and mechanical resources. Its richness in
mines and forests, the numbers of Us agri
cultural districts, their farms and products.
Its educational and religious opportunities, as
well as questions pertaining to sociological
conditions.
COMPLETING THE CENSUS.
The labors of the officials in charge of the
bureau Indicate that the law of March 3, 1S99,
requiring the completion of the four important
and most desired subjects, namely, population,
agricultural, manufacturing and vital statis
tics, will be completed within the prescribed
limit.
The field work incident to the abov» in
quiries is now practically finished and as a
result the population of the States and Ter
ritories including the Hawaiian Islands and
Alaska has been announced. The growth of
population during the last decade amounts to
over 13.C00.000, a greater numerical increase
than in any previous census in the history of
the country.
Bulletins will be Issued as rapidly as possible,
giving the population by States and Territor
ies,- by minor civil divisions. Several announce
ments of this kind have already been adopted
and it is hoped that the list will be completed
by January 1. Other bulletins giving the re
sults of the manufacturing and agricultural
inquiries wlli be given to the public as rapidly
an circumstances will admit.
The director, while confident of his ability
to complete the different branches of the under
taking in the allotted time, finds himself em
barrassed by the lack of a trained force prop
erly equipped for statistical work, thus rais
ing the question whether in the interest of
economy and a thorough execution of the census
work there should not be retained In th» Gov
ernment employ a certain number of experts,
not only to aid In the preliminary organiza
tion prior to the taking of the decennial census,
but In addition to having the advantage in the
field and office work of the bureau of trained
assistants to facilitate the early completion of
this enormous undertaking.
I recommend that Congress at its present ses
sion apportion representation among the sev
eral States as provided by the constitution.
The Department of Agriculture has been ex
tending its work during the past year, reaching
farther for new varieties of seeds and plants;
co-operating more fully with the States and
Territories in research along useful lines; mak
ing progress in meteorological work relating to
lines of wireless telegraphy and forecasts for
ocean-going vessels; continuing Inquiry as to
animal disease: looking Into the extent and
character of food adulteration; outlining plans !
for the care, preservation . and intelligent har
vesting'of our wood lands; studying soils that
producers may cultivate with better knowledge
of conditions, and hoping to clothe desert
places with grasses suitable to our arid re
gions. Our Island possessions are being con
sidered, that their peoples may be helped to
produce the tropical products -now so exten
sively brought Into the United States. Inquiry
into methods of Improving our roads has been
active during the year; help has been given to
many localities and scientific Investigations of
material in the State and Territories have been
Inaugurated. Irrigation problems In our ecml-
