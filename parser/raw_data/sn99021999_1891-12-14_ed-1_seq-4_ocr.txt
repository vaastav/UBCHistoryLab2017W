When the legislature enacted the lav
that piovldosffor the inapcution of II
luminallng oiU the governor was em
powered to appoint u state inspcctoi
whoso duty It Is miilo. by himself nut
Ills tioputtoi , to carry on the Inspoctloi
nf tlio oils imported into this state am
placed on sale. The manifest object estate
state nil Inspection was Io have those oil ;
examined and chemically tested before
they passed from the hands of the tlotiloi
Into thoAo of the consumer. Thu
ilaniror to lifo and property fron
iho handling and use of explosive
20111 pounds cifn scarcely bo over
ratca , and , this danger confront !
Iho people of the smaller towns and vll
luges , and especially the farmer ant
worUlngman who are compelled to ust
ao.il oil , a great deal more than it douj
Iho business people of our larger olllo ;
ivhcro gas and electric lights are In gcii'
oral use.
Tlio duty of selecting competent and
conscientious inspectors was very prop ,
jrly placed in the hands of the chio
jxccutivo. It ia also thn duty ot the
jovornor to BOO to It that the oil Inspoe
Jon livw is strictly enforced. Ami
ivhon these inspectors fall to dc
Lhcir duty it is made the duty of the
jovornor ti remove any state inspcctoi
ivho shall provo himself to bo cither un
faithful or Incompetent.
The exposures recently undo by Tin
BKK afford abundant and eoneluslvt
l > roof that oil inspection under Stati
Inspector Cams and his deputies ha ;
Iwon a farce and a ft atid. It has boor
jhowti by our investigations ilrit In.
jpector C irna has permitted the oil
-ohotiso men to st-imp their oils with-
3ut inspection , and vast qu intitiea of oil
liavo boon sold in this stxtj , contrary to
law , without an inspector's stamp.
The inspection itself , whore it
lias been made , has boon a down
right imposture and worse than
no inspection whatever. Thus the livo-i
jf moil , women and children have beet
imperiled by the rocklosa neglect , in
soinpotoncy and collusion of faithlos ;
alllcials with the oil manufacturers ant !
loiilors. If this imposture merely in
volved the sale of inferior olla at prices
charged for oils of bettor quality , com
petition would perhaps eventually teni
to redress the grievances of tlio choatoi
- on-iunioi's. But when public ollicors
connive with conscienceless dealers , and
thousands of men , women and
children are exposed to the risk ol
bolng burned to death or horribly mu
tihitcd , there is 111 end to indulgence.
The selection of a disreputable politic il
lobbyist as chief inspector of oils .wi ;
n.uobtionablp , and Tim 13ii : : entered it :
earnest remonstrance against it when i
was announced. But ibis bid choice
might have boon condoned if the odicoi
and his deputies had shown any dispo i-
tion to enforce the law , or oven made i
respectable semblance of inspection.
It now devolves upon MS , in behalf o
the nooplo of this state , to call upot
Governor Thayer to do his
duty as the law directs
Ho should either compel State Inspcctoi
Ca'rns to hand in his resignation
or appoint a successor without furthoi
ceremony. The governor can scarcoli
pretend to bo ignorant of wh.it has boot
published as regards the inspection o
oils under Carna and his deputies I
ho has not informed himself in the mat
Lor it is certainly his duty to do so ,

Thoio is a good deal of talk regarding
posbiblo changes in the tarilT , and then
is considerable interest being manifested
fosted in the question whether Mr
Mills will bo made chairman of tin
ways and moans committee. It is
Intimated that the To\as congress ,
man. whoso defeat has not im
proved his Irascible temper , maj
iodine tlio position if it ie
ottered him , hut ho could make
no groalor mistake than tills if ho in
tends to lomain in the house. It would
bo a confession of weakness that woult
lose Mills whatever prestige lie now ha ;
and would probably cause bun to be
relegated to private lifo with the elo-u
of his present congressional term.
Tlio democrats in the house are divided
In opinion as to what legislation they
aught to attempt icgarding the tarlll ,
Some are > in favor of a general hill ,
which will fully sot forth the tarill
policy of the party and thus clearly do-
line the issue for the presidential cam
paign. This class urge that the
Jomocratic roproaontatlvoa will fall
short of their duty to con
stituents if they do not roporta measure
jf this Kind , that.having boon elected tn
secure tarilT reformthey will not respond
Lo the wishes of the electorate by a
piecemeal revision. Othora argue that
inasmuch as it would bo impossible to
jot a general tariff bill through the
senate , It is tlio part of wisdom to ut-
iompt only a few changes , some of which
; ho senate may accept. Among the
nero Inlluential member * who take thla
low is Mr. Springer , and it is quite
irobublo that ho n Hoots the opinion of
Speaker Crisp. In that event this view
vill doubtless prevail , and Instead ot u
rcnoral bill and u prolonged tariff dls-
ittsaion an attempt will bo made to
mango the lawonly as to comparatively
ow articles.
It is clearly the opinion of the proal-
lent that the la N ought to remain intact ,
indtho Inlluonco of the administration
nay bo exerted to this end , but it is
ory likely that some of the republican
onators will bo found fiworablo to sov-
mil changes that are demanded in the
ntorest of their constituents. Western
oiriton ) would consult the welfare of
heir people by putting lumber and salt
in the free list , and the president would
lardly refuse to approve those changes
f they received the endorsement
if uonators of hla party. The
rovornmont derives very little revenue
rom the duties on these articles , but
ho aggiogato gain to the people if they
iroro on the free list would bo large ,
'ho people of the west are oapoeially In-
orentod in having lumber free , and
hero ID no valid reason why It should
ml bo But In any event the changrvj
a the turitt law will bo few , so that it ij
really of Hinall conscquonco how Spoaltoi
Crisp makes up the ways and moan
committee , or whether Mr. Mills 01
somebody else la placed nt tlio head o
that committee. Tin business Interest' '
of the country may feel secure from nni
general interference with the tnrllT feint
nt least two years longer.

The charge that the solo tnollvo foi
enjoining the purchase of the lot noxl
to the Rood library lot was mori'onarj
la as bisoloss as the Intimation emanat
ing from the suno source Unit TIIK
Uii's : light on the Kotclrun furnltun
job was choked otT by u contribution
from the agents of the Kotchatn ( Join
puny. The suggestion that the library
building , if located on the corner o
IMghtconth and IJouglns , would BIIVO tin
city from $5,000 to * " ,000 n year for fuo
und engineers nnu protect the city bal
from tlio danger. , that might bo In
curred by the erection of a llro trnj
was made solely from u business aland' '
point. Wo do not contend that tlio build
ing should bo erected on that particulai
square , but wo do Insist that the city Inn
no business to construct a public build
ing On ground that will revert to tin
heirs of the donor
Nobody q.tcationa the integrity nut
disinterested motives of the librurj
board The only point involved in the
library Injunction is the right of the
bout dor the city council to incur a lia
bility above the amount at their dis
posal in the city treasury. If the
last election meant anything it moanl
that our citizens insist that our olllcial1
shall conduct the tiff lira of this city 01
businosa methods , and in strict conform
ity to the law. No class of olllcials ft on
the highest to the lowest is above law.
Quito apart from tlio overlap whicl
the council \oted in authori/ing the
nuichase of the lot adjacent to the Reoi
lot by the libiary board comes the question
tion whether this city shall on or upor
the erection of a public building undoi
conditions which no corporation or in
dividual would bo willing to accept
under similar circumstances It ia thi
province and duty of the city council
to endeavor to huva tlio heirs of the late
Bvron Reed waive all their rights to the
title of the proposed library silo before
the city undertakes to expend $100,00 (
or any ether sum in its impiovoment
nnu when a clear title is assured the
question will arise whether any part o ;
the $100,000 voted at the late elcctlor
can bo expended on the ground whicl
the board proposes to purchase. The
bond proposition and the will both ro.
quite the buildingto bo erected on the
Rcod lot. If this condition must bo car.
rleci out , the only use that can
possibly bo made of the adjoin ,
ing lot is fern giass plot
Is this the purpose for which the public
library tax was levied ? Is not that taji
levied for books and expenses incidental
tolnaintaining a public library ?
In view of nil those complications , is
it not eminently proper that every stef
taken in the direction of the proposed
library building should bo carefully considered -
sidorod instead of being ruahod through
in nofianco of law ?
This is the object of the injunction ,
and every disintotostod taxpayer it :
Omaha will concede that it ia in the in
terest of good government.
AtUllllIt
The report that another American
seaman has been subjected to a cruel
outrage at the hands of the Chilian
authorities will bo very likely to induce
a sentiment in this country that the gov.
01 nment should bo a little loss ind ulgonl
toward Chili. There is danger that the
disposition which the United States has
shown to wait upon the hnmor of the
Chilian irovornmont may bo miscon
strued , and that the outrages ol whicli
wo make just complaint will continue.
The latest net of cruelty appears to have
beenontlroly without excuse or justifica
tion , and was simply another exhibition
of the hatred ol Americans which is
manifestly general among- the Chilian
people. The victim was artosted for
being drunk and sentenced to the chain
ganir , and while working out the
penalty ho was brutally beaten by the
police. When the American consul laid
the matter before the intondonto that
olllcial refused to see the injured man ,
but promiaed that the affair should be
Investigated , which is probably only n
convenient way of dropping it out ol
consideration.
Tlio tone of the president's message
regarding the Chilian complication
very clearly implies that in the
event of Chili not making a satis"-
factory answer to the roqucata
of this government ho will recom
mend a declaration of war. There
ia some reason to apprehend that this
may become necessary. True , the ex
pressions of tlio Chilian minister on the
occasion of his proiontation to tlio pres
ident were of the moat friendly nature ,
and convoyed the Impression that it was
the earnest doairo of the Chilian gov
ernment to deal justly and to maintain
friendly rotations. But the course of
that government thus far has not justi
fied the impression. The response
to the request ot the government of the
United States for information was , ttio
president a < iya , couched in an olToiibivo
tone , and how offensive may bo surmised
from tlio fact that this government baa
made no reply to it. The people of the
United States do not deaire n war witli
Chili. They hope for a peaceful oottlo-
mont of the complications Hut will bo fair
nnd just , and which it ought to bo prac
ticable to ollect without any compromise
of the aolf respect of either nation. But
if Chill shall fall to appreciate our
piopor position in the matter , nnd shall
refuse to render the .satisfaction this
country has the undoubted right to ex
pect , wo will have to talvo the stops noc-
osaary to unfnrro our rights and
pursue them nt whatever cost
until wo hnvo demon fetrated to
tlin world that wo havu both the
will and the power to piotoctour oitl-
/ens. The government has taken a stand
In this matter from which It cannot
rucodo without the loss of dignity nnd
tospoct , and without in olToot haying to
ill the world that outrages upon Amor-
lean citizens may be committed with
Impunity. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Ing tetsely what ho wants to say.
Now York Herald ( Ind dom ) Mr. Har
rison's mess iio is a straightforwaid docu
ment which eives us a clear photographic
view of the events whli'h have absorbed the
conntiy's attention during the last twelve
months.
Now Yoik Recorder ( top. ) : President Harrison
risen has dlscluigcel liU constitutional duty
with ability , energy nnd complotonos ! , . The

llo Iniciost.
Philadelphia Lodger ( rep. ) : President
Harrison's mcssaco Is llko tuo man frank ,
plain and busincssllKo , nnd admirable in ex
pression Jutt such a presentation of the
"stite of the union" ns the constitution re
quires him to make to congress.
Now York World ( dem ) : The president
thinks the people of the United States ought
to "gtmranteo the ciedlt" of Iho Nicaragua
Canal company. If the credit of that com
pany isn't good that is reason enough vvhv
Lho government should not bccomo Its en-
.
New York AdvoitUer ( dem. ) : The presi
dent's message is a moio Important state
paper than anv ho has previously communi
cated to concress. * * * As a whole ,
It Is an able , and hero and there admirable ,
document , worthy of the president and well
woith rending.
Philadelphia North American ( rep. ) : The
mcsMico of the president is a gratifying exhibit -
hibit of tro state of the union. It is long ,
but the multitude of subjects necessarily
under observation and discussion demand
considerable spaco. It is conscientious.
Thoio is no attempt to dodge any public
[ .uostlon or to gloss over anything.
Philadelphia Pioss ( icp. ) : The many sub
jects discussed and impoitanb interests
treated in President Harilson's thlid annual
messapo trivo a icaluing sense to Iho rculur
af the gioatnoss of this country , and the
labor , talent , and vigllunco nosossary In the
harmonious administration of Its govern
ment. It is a serious , dicrnillod state papor.
Now York Tribune ( rep ) : The ono char.ic-
: pristic of Picaidcnt HariUon's annual message -
sago which moat impresses every candid
reader is Its absolute trcedom from paitisan-
ililp or prejudice. Thoio is in it no straining
'or olTiyt. It is n simple , clear and business-
Iko statement of public affairs , full of wise
mil maotical suggestions , and so dispass'on-
ito that Its poiusal , after the crazy factional
: on tests of dcmoci.its , is llko a breath of cool
nountain air.
Boston Advertiser ( rop. ) : Presidojit Har-
ison's third annual masitago is not only the
nest Important of thorn all , but is ono of the
.lilest and most valuable piosldontial mes-
ages Inld before congioss and the country
or many a long voir. It Is dlgnillod and
tatosminllko throughout ; in parts It is
'Xtiomelv ' sugRostivc , in other pai's It rises
o a stiain of genuine eloquence. The elocu-
nont as a whole will do much to increase
