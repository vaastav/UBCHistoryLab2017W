The Clarion continues to club with a

States. Under our reduced rate of subscrip

one year:

The State Grange.
This body is well KBrsaejfttd by solid
ami intelligent delegation?. In this list
will be found a number of the fair, public-spirited
daughters of the State who
have equal voice in the Grange, with
the "lords of creation." The address
of the Master of the Grange was schol

on rising ground. It has now 11)3 Sub
ordinate Granges in the State.
The National Grange.
The National Grange at it late session
in Ii.d'anapolis re e'e -ted the old officers,
including Capt. Put Darden of Missis
itppi, Overseer, and Mrs. Put Darden,
Pomona. The reports of Committees are
unusually interesting, and among the
most important was the one from the
Committee on Agriculture, of which
("apt. Harden was Chairman.
Ouf esteemed neighbor, the Comet,
differs with us about "the applicability
of the case of Oglesby vs. rSigmun."
The very fac, that two such fair ami
judicial minded journals as the Comet
and Cl.U'JON differ in 'heir construction
of the decision, shows the necessity of a
new one. But what is more needed is an
amendment to Sec. 140 of the Revised
Code, setting forth that "nothing here
in shall be construed to prevent the
Commissioners of Election after they
have transmitted to the Secretary of
State a statement of the votes, from
correcting clerical errors', or ;fn apparent
or real discrepancy in the said state
m?nt." And still another amendment
would lie exceedingly proper, re.iiiriii".
the prcenee of the Governor at the
canvassing of the returns by the Secre
tary of State. A3 the law now stands
the Governor is required to issue a com
mission on the certificate of that officer
without knowledge of the facts on
which il is liased.
OtJB able contemporary, the New
Orleans States, reminds The ClABKXS
that Kellogg is a very detestable char
acter in Louisiana. We know it, and
know there are sufficient reasons for it.
Bat this could not enter into the con
sideration of the question of issuiug his
itifieate after the people of the Dis
trict had elected him as their Represen
tative. A Democratic Legislature re
distrieted the State. The place to have
beaten him was in the District, and the
election was the time a job that might
have been easily accomplished if the
Democrats of the District had taken a
becoming interest in the election, inas
much tvs it contained a colored mnjorit
of but about 2,000.
The States reproves its for "arraign
ing" the Governor of Louisiana, for wha
seemed his intention to withhold a cer
tihcate from Kellogg, and remainin
silent, when by one or two Democratic
votes he was nermitted to usurp a seat
in the Senate as a pretended representa
tive of Louisiana. If the States hat
been informed of our course, it would
have spared us its reproof. It so hap
pens that The Clarion did expres
itself on that occasion. It held that
Kellogg ought to have been dismissed
not because he was not an "inhabitant
of Louisiana, but for the all -sufficient
reason that he was a usurper that he
was "elected'" by a mob, a bogus Legis
lature, which never had a legal exist
ence according to the known facts and
the decision of the Hayes administra
tion itself. e will venture to sir
that if Kellogg has no better claim to a
seat in the House of Representatives
than he had to the seat he now occupies
in the Senate, he will be hoisted.

We have shown that these lai

the 3 titles and powers of Congress fi
the beginning of the government dj
to 1870. During the late war, th
tbority of the general government
strained under pretence that it
necessary to put down what in
parlance was called " the rebellio
and though the pretended occasion
passed, with the return of peace,
party then and ever since in power,
insisted upon the same rule of admi
fei-in"- the government. The electi
laws are in accord with iu general
lev. Thev have been the agency
th grossest oppression and infringem
upon tbe rights of citizens.
Section 2021 ( Revised Statutes of
United States' provides that wberev
an election at which Representatives
Congress ars to be chosen, is held in an
citv of 20,000 inhabitants or tipwar
the United States marshal, who is
partizan of the President, may appoji
as many deputies as he pleases, all
his own party, with power to attend the
polls, oversee elections, and to arrest
with r without warrant any person
whom they may suspect of improper
design. These deputies are to serve
ten days ami are to be paid $5 a day
for their services. It will be readily
een how such a power lodged in the
hands of active and unscrupulous par
tizans may he eu. ployed to control elec
tions against the will of the voters. In
the city of Philadelphia, a few years
ago, as many as 700 marshals were ap
pointed for special service in elections.
These officials were proven before a
comrrittee of the United States Senate
to be moat desperate and debased
characters, bullies and rowdies, who
shamefully abused their trust and were
guilty of the most outrageous excesses.
In New York, it was worse. There,
2,500 deputies were appointed, of like
despicable character, with like results.
Among the wrongs which they perpetra
ted was to compel several thousand nat
uralized voters to surrender their certifi
cates, under threat of prosecution, and
n election day hundreds were arrested
and locked up like beasts upon charges
trumped up for the occasion. The ob
ject was to keep thousands of legal
voters away from the polls. These dep
uty marshals are appointed for the pur
pose of acting as a bulldozing force to
destroy free elections.
In Mississippi, previous to the late
election, a proclamation of an intimi
dating character was issued by authority
of the Attorney-General of the United
States, by the supervisor of elections for
the Northern District, and several
pretended deputy marshals attended the
voting polls in Marshall county and
were guilty of acts of interference in
the election wholly unwarranted by ttie
law itself such as seizing the ballot
box and terrorizing the voter. These
so-called deputies were usurpers, be
cause there is no city of 20,000 inhabi
tants in the 2d Congressional District,
and for cities or towns of a less number
the appointment of deputy marshals is
unauthorized. The persons who assumed
to act in that capacity are themselves
intimidaton and conspirators against
the right of the voter to enjoy his elec
tive franchise, and they are liable to
the severest penalty which the law pro
vides for such offences, as they are
guilty.
Section 2011 authorizes the Judje of
the District Court of the United States
to appoint two supervisors of election
for each voting place to witness the
proceedings, challenge voters, etc., and
though they have no right to make ar
rests, nor to perforin other duties than
to be in the immediate presence of the
officers holding the election, they are
really intended to act as spies and in
formers and to be witnesses in ca8 of
such prosecutions as thev inav be able
to instigate. The object of their ap
poiutment is to terrorize the voters, and
the service they are required to per
form is as violative of the spirit of the
free institutions which constitute the
basis of our government as if they were
armed with the power to make arbitrary
arrests.
Laws so entirely at variance with the
Constitution, and which arejthe conveui
cut instrument for interfering with free
elections, and the vindictive punish
ment of citizens for partizan ends,
should not be permitted to remain on
the statute bocks. They should be re
pealed. The government should be
brought back to first principles.

of Tennessee, who died at Clarksville.
Col. Henry, like his illustrious father,
possessed man v noble traits of charac

and was conspicuous for gallantry. He
was a nearrelative of Maj. Pat. Henry,

Resoi.ctkxs bave been introduced
into both Houses of Congress directing
inquiry whether at the recent Congres
sional election, money was raised by-
assessment or otherwise, from Federal
office-holders or employees, for election
purposes, and if so, by whom, and what
amount was so raised, and how the
same was collected and expended,
and whether such assessment was not
in violation of law ; also whether any
Federal office-bolder or employee has
been dismissed or threatened with dis
missal or deprivation of any right or
privilege by reason of his refusal to pay
any assessment made on him, or was
otherwise interfered with.
The subject of civii-service reform being
mentioned, Senator Voorhees said :
"I looks to me as if this issue was made
prominent by tlie Republican press and Re
publican leaders just at this lime from verj
interested and selfish motives. It is very
apparent to them, as it is to everybody else,
that they are on the rugged tdge of a preci
pice over which they will be drawn in ISSi.
It is absolutely certain that two years hence
the Democratic parly, if guided by conserva
tive common-sense, will take control oi the
executive department of the government.
There are now more than 100,000 Republi
cans iu office, and as Gov. Foster said a tew
davs ago, the proposed civil-service reform
if enacled nto law, would keep them il
office uud r a Democratic administration.
I am not in favor of this, nor anything like
it. I am in favor of reforming the civil
servicc, but the bet rerv.rmaliou I can
think of would be to make a thorough
change iu ihe service trom lop to bottom.
I do not thint the Democratic party will
Wallow tin hook prepared lor it, although
baited by the alluring is tie of ao-called civil
service reform."

The Message on the Supervision
Corporations.
Of
Not the least noteworthy feature of
the President's Message, is his dot ided
committal in favor of laws for the pro
tection of commerce between the States
by legislation controlling freights and
fares. He says :
The regulation of interstate commerce has
already beeu the tnhjeet o.' jour delibera
tions. Oue of ihe incidents oi" the marvellous
extension of the railway system of the coun
try has been the adoption of sasa m -asures by
the corporations which own or control the
roads as lias tender, d It impair the advan
tages of bea't'ifal c !ii;i"tii i ju and make
hurtful iliaarifaiaatiiMif in the adjustment of
treiglittie. Thase inequalities have been cor
rected iu several of the States by appropriate
tesdslaUoa, the effect of which i aeceaaarity
restricted to th-' limits of their own territiry.
Sj far as such measures affect commerce be
tween tbe states or between any one o! the
states an I a foreign count rj th ij hXi subjects
of national concern, ud congress alone can
afford relief.
It will be seen, that while the Pres
ident extols the regulations which have
been adopted by State Legislatures to
prohibit extortion and discrimination
within the States, he recommends need
ful legislation by Congress for t lie pro
tection of commerce bet ween the States.
The recommendation is a tjood one.

This is all that need be stated to an under

folllows :
ProviJtd, however, That in the central por
tion of the channel of llie Pearl river, of the
liayof Sr. L mis. of the B ly M I iloxi, and of

of not less than sixty feel in wid'h, and said

that said drawbridges shall be opeutd for the

It is contended by counsel for defendant
that the line of defendant's road having baen

vote of Gloucester. county gave to Gar
nson an unquestioned majority in the
listna ; but tbe State Board award
ed to Mayo tbe certificate of elec
tion on these grounds : Tbe objection
made to the Gloucester returns was that
the teal used was not the County Court's
seal, but the "seal of tbe Circuit Court"
with the word county substituted for
circuit ; then read "seal of the Coanty
Court." The Clerk of the Curt, Mr.
Cook, stated that the sesl of the County
Court had for some vears been broken, so
that sufficient leverage pressure could
not be easily obtained to make an im
pression, and that since that time the
Circuit Court seal was used by the
County Court, the word circuit being
always written over by the "County.''
In other words, that the seal used by
him on these returns is his official seal.
He brought the old seal to submit for
the inspection of the Board. Notwith
standing this, Mr. Edgar Allan moved
that the Gloucester returns be rejected,
not being, in his opinion, in conformity
with the law so far as the seal is con
cerned. The" case was elaboratelv ar
gued by Allan, for Mayo, and Gen.
Eppa Hunton, as counsel for Garrison,
the Democratic candidate. A sugges
tion that the returns be sent back to
the county for amendment as to seal, or
that the county clerk, then outside
waiting the command of the Board, be
called and permitted to set the old
county seal on the returns were all re
jected, and the returns were thrown out.
Gov. Cameron was the only member of
tbe Board who voted to accept the
returns from Gleucester. Attorney
General Blair and the others held that
the Gloucester seal was fatally defect
ive, and that it was not in the power of
the Board to do anything but pass upon
the identical paper before them. Gov.
Cameron declined to sign tbe certificate
awarded to ' Mayo. This sends him to
Washington with oue majority. Glou
cester gave Judge Garrison a majority
of 57, aud upon these facts there can
be no doubt but that the House of Rep
resentatives, which is the final judge,
will see that justice is done by seating

Ex-Senator Gibebt, late of Coving

It affronts common sense to assume
that the Supreme Court ever intended
bv anv decision it has rendered, to furn
ish ground for denying the power and
the duty of Election Commissioners to
correct a mere clerical error in .heir
certificate declaring the result of an
election, or in a memorandum accom
panying the same, or a discrepancy in
their statement. If under onr statutes
a pretext so flimsy is all sufficient to
overturn tbe fundamental law of the
right of the people to have their votes
returned to theJSecretary of State as cast
and actually eountcd by the inspectors, and
to absolutely annul them, our statutes are
wofully defective and our elective sys
tem a farce, rbe bupreme Court could
not have intended to promulgate such
monstrous doctrine.
The Supreme Court of Missouri has
rendered its decision in the case of Brod-
head vs. McLean. Brodhead (Dem
ocrat) petitioned for a mandamus to
compel the election managers to count
the votes of two disputed precincts in
the 9th Congressional District. The
Court has issued a peremptory order to
the managers to count the votes. The
execution of this order insures the elec
tion of Brodhead. The noteworthy fea
ture of the case is that the Court as
serted its jurisdiction over the case.
Indeed, where the duties of an officer
are ministerial and not judicial, we
have not heard the authority of the

in the construction of a bridge across
the chaunel of Pearl river, where it de
bouches into Lake Borgne, without the
draw of sixty feet as, it was alleged, the

entails an additional expense of 50 cts.

that positions of influence should k; hi led

who by their deeds honor God and elevate
His cause. Christian legislators should be
appreciated; the purity of the elective

thunder tones against all infringement! on
the right of a free ballot and a fair count.

The correspondent who sends tbe an
nouncement of Mr. Conn's candidacy
for District Attorney, accompanies it
with the request that we publish it,
with the following tribute from tbe Wes
son Herald:
Mr. Conn, at present, is the Chairman of
the Democratic Executive Committee of
Copiah County. He is a lawyer of abil
ity, and high standing, and represents
toe rising element at the bar, and from
personal knowledge and observation as
well aa the opinion of those competent to
jndge, we are convinced of his eminent fit
ness tor that office an office requiring dil
igence, learning, and thorough knowledge
of jurisprudence.
tention of the Lejrislnture, it is ur;ed bv
defendant's counsel that previous to and at
the time of the passage of the act of incorpora
tion ad the commerce upon Pe irl river made
its way to New Orleans through channels
west of the mouth o: the river, hut we must
presume that the Legislature looked lo the
luiure development of the country lying on
this stream, extending as it does fur into the
interiorof the State, and especially regarded
tiie immense forests of pine and other timbers
contiguous to the raver and its tributaries,
which constitute the chief lumber supply of
ihe State, and now findi its way not only to
New Orlems but to almost every pari of the
inhabitable globe; nor can it be presumed
ih it the Legi-luture was ignorant of the efforts
then being made and those in contempljtion
to deepen the passage for vessels landing on
the east s as to orin; aoout an interchange
01 commodities oetween us ana tne world.
I am stisried that the act of Congress in re
lation to defendant s road and the privileges
granted to it was not intended to interfere
with any of the relations between the State
and the company.
Congress required-the company to construct
drawbridges over East Pascagoula river and
the Bays of Biloxi and St. Louis sufficient for
the passage ot vessels eiehtv teet in width
These being navigable waters, Congress had
the right to impose any restrictions it saw
proper, and as a matter of facts the restrictions
imposed as regards these waters were more
stringent than those imposed by the State. It
might bave imposed the sane restrictions as
to Pearl river, but doubtless it deemed those
imposed by the State sufficient, or aa to this
river, waa willing to leave the question to the
Legislature ot the State
The act of Congress further provides that
the privilege?, thereby conferred, shall not eo
into effect until the road is constructed, com
pleted and in use in accordance with the laws
of the States through which the same passes.
I am satisfied that the answer presents no
defence to the petition. Therefore tbe de
murrer to tne answer most be sustained and
tbe relief be granted.
The Agricultural Department reports
a large shortage of hogs in the greatest
hoe producing States. This indicates
a hi ah nri -e for all kinds of meat for

for seven cents a pound eo toot.
The Tariff Commission, tailing in
with the current of sentiment, contrary
to expectation, have recommended a
reduction of the tariff on many articles.
The majority of the Commission is com
posed of original protectionists, and
their report is an admission that the
present tariff is what the National Dem
ocratic Convention pronounced it " A
masterpiece of injustice, inequality and
false pretence," which plunders many
industries and subsidizes a few.
The Commissioner of Internal Reve
nue goes out of his own bailiwick to
recommend the repeal of the tariff on
sugar which yields $45,000,000 of reve
nue annually. The suggestion that far
is well enough, but be proposes to let
tbe high duties on cotton and woolen
goods, iron, salt, cotton ties, clothing
and the like remain for the benefit of
the Eastern monopolists. Let us bave
a tariff strictly upon a revenue basis.
Tbe present systen by preventing
competition for the benefit of mo
nopolists, prohibits the importation of
many articles that would yield large
reveuues.

tally sheet annexed to the certificate of

retary of States's office, is in the form

Tobacco.
A, bill has beeu reported by tbe
House Committee to abolish all form of
internal taxes on tobacco. A good
measure. Tobacco is so commonly used
as to be regarded as a necessity, and can
not be classed as a luxury. Besides, it is
the only article of agricultural produc
tion that is taxed. There is no justice
in such discrimination. Mr. Morrison,
(Democrat of Illinois) of the committee
voted against reporting the bill. His
Democratic colleagues voted to report
it. The Republicans were about equal-
lv divided.
It is a surprise that Capt. W. H.
Hardy, who has beeu invaluable in get
ting the X. O. & N. E. railroad scheme
afoot, has not been re-elected Vice
President. The Meridian Observer voices
the sentiment of the friends of the road
in this State in saying :
Captain Hardy has been connected with
the road since its first organization, and iias
labored faithfully, earnestly and efficiently
to get this great enterprise in successful op
eration, and with liis many friends in this
state, we regret to see his connection with
it severed.

Epitors Clarion: Suppo-e a merchant
makes an absti let of A. B.'s account, and ac
companies it with an itemized account, ami
the two are different, which fion! :l be taien
as the true one ? Apply this to the decision of
the Secretary of State in reference to the le
turns of the Tute county Commissioners.
X V.
ANSWER.
The case you put cannot be applied
at all, because there is no similarity
between it and the Tate county affair.
In the Tate county returns the figure in
the certificate and in the "itemized
account" were precisely the same. The
abstract reads thus : V. H. Manning
1166; J. R. Chalmers 1472. The
"itemized account" which accompanied
it reads as follows : V. H. Manning
1166 ; J. R. Qiambless 1472. If a mer
chant makes an abstract of A. B.'s ac
count, and renders an itemized state
ment of it at the same time, with the
figures alike in both, it could not be
said that an error in writing the name
of A. B. in the latter, would warrant
the inference that it was intended fur
some other person besides A. B.

In the full enjoyment of the gifts of

try, economy, sad virtue, every man ia en
titled to equal protection by law. But
when the laws undertake to add to these
natural and just advantages artificial dis
tinctions, to grant titles, gratuities and ex
elusive privileges; to make the rich richer
and the potent more powerful; the humble
members of society, the farmers, laborers
and mechanics, who have neither the time
nor the means of securing like favors to
themselves, have a right to complain of the
injustice of their government There art
no necessary evils in the government. Its
evils exist only in abuses. If it would con
fine itself to equal protection, and aa Heaven
