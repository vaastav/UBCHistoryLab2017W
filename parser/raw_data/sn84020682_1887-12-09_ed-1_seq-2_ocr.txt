ASHEY1LLE CITIZEN.
JORDAN STONE, S-lMTOKi.
J. D. CAMERON, )
FRIDAY MORNING, DEC. 9, 1SS7.
It is said in the Washington po
litical circles that eleven of the Ran
dall following Iiavc been converted
to Carlisle, and that the opposition
to tariff leduction is decreasing
every day. Subsequently to this
report the President's message
comes out. It is a p'unner, and he
will be a headstrong bigot who re
sists its torce. Now let us rach the
internal revenue law. It seems
clear that Mr. Carlisle will not
again act as obstructionist to the
admission of th legislation looking
to the repeal or modification of a
law most generally offensive and
oppressive. The intimations are
that at least some of the most ob
jectionable features will be stricken
out.
'i
The prohibitionists have scored
oca victory.. The Supreme Court of
the United States has decided the
Iowa prohibition law as constitu
tion. The question came up
partly on the question raised by
the brewers that their property by
force of the prohibition law, had
been taken from them without com
pensation, in other words that build
ings erected for a speeial purpose
had lost their uses and became val
ueless. On this point the court
says :
'The State of Kansas had prohib
ited the liquor traffic. It did not
thereby take away the property o:
the breweries. It simply auated a
nuisance. Tho property is not ta
ken., from its owners. They are
only prohibited from vising it for the
specific purpose which to Legisla
ture declared to be injurious to the
community.
And it may be added that this
decision is another enunciation of
the doctrine of State sovereignty
assailed by Republicans in solid
column, the maintenance of which
is essential to the perpetuity of tree
institutions. We are happy to ?f e it
at last recognized by the highest
tribunal in the land.
STATE FINANCES.
From the Raleigh correspondence
of the Petersburg Index-Appeal, ve
obtain the followiug information :
The sensitiveness of capital has
recently Vsen demonstrated by the
sale in this citv, on Friday last, ol
812,000 four per cent. North Caro
lina bonds at ninety-five cents in
the dollar This is doubtless the
result of the recent decisions of
Judge Bond in the drummers' ii
sense case, but there really is no
cause for the least uneasines. A
plain statement of the finances ol
the State should be sufficient to
dispel any doubts whatever as to
the ability of the Treasurer to meet
all demands. The estimates of the
fiscal vearsl887-'SS were based upon
a total tar valuation of $202,000,000
at 23 cents on the hundred dollars.
This, with the various special taxes,
would have made the total resources
for the present fiscal year $792,997"
06. At the time the Treasurer made
his estimates it was supposed that
the Legislature would reduce tax
on land from 25 to 23 cent?, but it
was scaled down to 20 cents. On
this basis, the estimates would fall
short of meeting all libilities of the
State general and special. Fortu
nately, however, the tax valuation
of property in the State has increas
ed, accordiug to the last sssesment,
to $209,000,000, upon which at 2.)
cents per hundred dollars reduction,
a tax of $418,000 will be derd,
which by the various special taxos
will be increased to $773,627,OG.
the estimated expenses for the fiscal
year ending December 1, 1888, are
$697,050. This includes eyerything
for which the State will be liable
for the year, including all interest
on the public debt. Ihis wiil leave
a balance in the Treasury of $75,
977.09, at the close ot the year. Add
to this sum $95,000 on hand at the
close of the year 18S7, and there
will be at the close ot 1888, $170,
977.06. Deduct the $80,( 00 which
may probably be lost to the State
by reason of Judge rsond s decision
in the drummers tax case, there will
still still be a balance on hand of
$90,077.06. In addition to this fa
vorable outlook, the State has re
cently bought in $300,000 of her
bonds, and H there should appear
the most remote signs of a shortage
the public Treasurer has ample
artbority to sell them, which he
could easily do at first rate prices
There re but few, if any, ;f the
States ot the South on a soundsr fi
nancial basi3 than North Carolina,
and none that will meet all oi-iiga-i
i it m ra or.wnptly.
EFFECTS OF THE PRESI
DENT'S MESSAGE.
The following embrace some of
the opinions expressed on the mas
terly message of Mr. Cleveland :
All of the leading Democrats in
the Senate and House who were
spoken to on the subject expreised
themselves as being fully in accord
with the President's views on the
tariff. Senator Ransom pronounced
the message an admirable paper
worthy of the great man who pen
ned it. Although the President
does not go so far on the subject of
internal revenue as North Caroli
nians would have desired, yet they
are willing to accept the suggestions
he has made an evidence of good
faith and a brighter prospect in the
luture. lie has recommended no
radical reduction of taxation, but
he has placed the entire subject be
fore Congress and the people in such
a plain and unmistakable lorm
that he Icavm Congress no altera
tive but to reduce taxation.
The liepubiicans showed clearly
that the message made a profound
impression upon them by its frank
and maulv tone. They evidently
did not expect such a strong docu
ment, !o they immediately con
eluded to try and break the force
of the arcurrent it contained by
ridiculing it Senator Hawley, of
Connecticut..an aspirant for Presiden
tial honors, said : "If the Demo
cratic party wants to nuke its next
national light on the message the
Republicans will be pleased to meet
them on that i?sue. It is trashy
and weak and coutains only a mass
of stale and exploded ideas." Other
Republicans characterized it as a
rehash of old ideas without a now
feature or sug-estson. Others said
it was inferior to many free trade
speeches delivered in Congress and
on the stump. Some went so far
as to say lh . President begged the
question at issue, and treated a great
national issue as a schoolboy would
his first composition.

Senator Palmer, of Michigan, will
introduce in the Senate at the earlie
est possible opportunity a bill pre
pared by him for the.purpose of reg
ulating and restricting immigration
to the United States, by keeping
out persons who seem likely to be
undesirable citizens. The principal
feature of the bill is a provision
which, if it become law, will require
every psrson of foreign birth who
contemplates emigration to the
United Statss to provide himself
with a certificate from the United
States Consul for the district of his
residence "setting forth substantial
ly that the consul is satisfied upon
diligent inquiry that he is a suita
ble and desirabla person for resi
dence and citizenship in the United
States." Immigrants ot foreign birth
not provided with such certificates
shall not be allowed by the United
States immigration officers to land
in this country. The bill provides
that no certificate shall be granted
to any convict, except those con
victed of political offences, nor to
any lunatic, idiot, or any person unj
able to take care of himself or her
self without becoming a public
charge, nor to any Anarchist, Nihi
list, or any person hostile to the
principles of the Constitution or
form of government of the United
States, nor to any believer or pro
fessed believer in the Mormon re
ligion who fails to satisfy the Con
sul, upon examination, that he or
she will conform to and obey the
laws of tho United States, nor to any
person included in the prohibition
in the act to prohibit the imports
tion and immigration cf foreigners
and aliens under contract or agree
ment to perform labor in the United
States.
Io:it Experiment.
You cannot atljrd to waste time in
experimenting when yoar lungs are in
danger. Consumption always seeirs, at
firt, only a cold. Do not permit any
dealer to impose v.pon you with some
cheap imitation of Dr. King's New Dis
covery for Consumption, Coughs and
Colds, bat be sure you get the genuine.
Because he can make more profit he may
tell you ne has something just aa good,
or just the same. Don't be deceived, but
insist upon getting Dr. King's New Dis
covery which is guaranteed to give relief
in all Throat, Dung and Chest affections.
