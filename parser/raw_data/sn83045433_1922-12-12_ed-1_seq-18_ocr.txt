"He is mighty in hearty and mighty in strength, who hath hardened himself against Him, and hath prospered*9 -**.
Text aoggeatod by the Rev. James H. Taylor, pastor of Central Presbyterian Church.
Ku Klux Klan
Un-American
ONE of the elements of our
population frankly scheduled
for suppression and exclusion
by the self-exalte^ Ku Klux Klan
is the Jew.
The masked and sheeted warriors
generously admit that the Jew is
white, but of course he is neither
Gentile nor Anjjio-Saxon. Inci
dentally, the so-called Anglo-Saxon
is himself a mixed breed, as the
name tells.
The Jew is ever the best of
"Christians" ? knowing, on occa
sion, the wisdom of non resistance
and of drawing the wider circle
which .includes him and his mo
mentary enemy.
Read the comprehensive consti
tutional Americanism expressed last
Saturday in the sermon of Rabbi
de Sola Pool, of the Spanish and
Portuguese Synagogue:
As Jews, who have through
out all our history in America
served and loved America, we
scorn to defend ourselves from
the religious bigotry of the Ku
Klux Klan.
But as American citizens we
rally to a man to the defense
of our country against those
who would undermine the basic
principles of liberty, equality
and justice on which this re
public is reared. _
As citizens we hold fast to
our constitutional guarantees of
due process of law, public trial
by an impartial jury and the
prohibition of cruel and un
usual punishments.
It is as citizens and not as
Jews that we maintain the right
of all persons, born or natural
ized in the United States, to
their right of citizenship irre
spective of race or,color.
The self-deluded bigots of the
Ku Klux Klan should hear from
the mouth of this religiously
American Iiabbi the fundamental
teachings of that very American
ism which these misguided zealots
are sworn to uphold and defend
and which their very "Anglo-Sax
on Christianity" should really
cherish and illustrate.
If. as one result of Ku Klux stu
pidities, the Catholic, the Jew, the
Xegro? as good Americans ? will
acct-pt the fellowship of threatened
persecution and will come closer
together, with malice toward none
hut in greater mutual good will,
then the members of the Ku Klux
Klan must duly recognize them
selves as the only remaining men
ace to America and Americanism.
Advertising
THE advertising of American
business in American month
lies and weeklies amounts
to about $150,000,000 a year, and
newspaper advertising to about
$650,000,000 a year, $800,000,000
in all, which is about as high as
the bill for America's chewing
(rum. or lip sticks, rouge and
powder.
George \V. Ilinman asks whether
this is worth the money.
And he answers his question in
the affirmative.
For he says that the value of
what the Cnited States produces
amounts to about $40,000,000,000,
and this advertising bill of $800,
000,000 is therefore only about 2
per cent of the total amount of
goods produced. Advertising is an
important and essential element in
distribution. It is more than that;
it is the self-expression of business
enterprise, and keeps it wholesome.
Russia tried the abandonment of
advertising and found that adver
tising and business both departed
together. If you are going to cut
off all the blossoms from a plant,
you are going, after awhile, to have
no more plant.
The Unjust
Borland Law
THE Commissioners undoubtedly
represent a united public
sentiment in asking Congress
to repeat or amend the meanest
piece of legislation ever enacted for
the District of Columbia?the Bor
land law.
That law imposes indirect special
taxation in addition to an already
burdensome direct taxation. It
places upon property owners of the
District virtually the entire burden
of paying the cost of construction
of new roadways and streets, be
sides the requirement that they pay
the cost of sidewalk construction.
Property owners, under this law,
pay a special assessment of one
half the cost of paving new road
ways and, on top of that, pay the
general taxes from which 60 per
cent goes for highway maintenance.
Roadways and streets are for the
benefit of the whole community and
for Uncle Sam's many activities in
this, his own Federal Capital.
If Congress wishes to do the
square thing it will order an in
vestigation of the unjust workings
of the Borland act, calling in those
District officials who have been
compelled to make and collect the
assessments upon properties.
Congress will find that, in many
cases affecting poor people owning
small pieces of land, the assess
ments imposed under the Borland
act virtually amounted to confisca
tion and deprivation of the hope of
owning homes.
There are many instances where
the special assessments were larger
than the assessed values of the
properties.
This sort of thing is bad enough
for the rich, but for the poor it is
actual robbery.
Too Drastic Orders
Won't Help Efficiency
TWO recent executive orders
are calculated to arouse
some bitterness among clerks
in Washington.
The first, issued by Colonel
Forbes, of the Veterans' Bureau,
calls for the deduction of a day's
pay as punishment for tardiness in
punching the time clock mornings.
The second, put out by District
Commissioner Keller, takes away
from employes in the engineer de
partment the privilege of sick leave
?unless it is deducted from annual
leave.
Both orders, of course, were in
tended in the interest of efficiency,
which is a highly desirable end.
But the best sort of efficiency
often is not promoted by iron boot
methods.
United States Government clerks
are not chain-gang slaves from
whom the overseer can get more
work with a whip.
Their work is mental?and bitter
ness and hatred are not good oils
for the human mind.
Weakness as a Weapon
THE weak have their power.
Anyone has power over an
other who can in that other
one cause any sort of pain. The
strong man has power over the
weak, because he can punish him
with blows. But the weak man
has power over the strong, because
he can work upon his pity.
The crying baby has power over
its mother, and can make her do
its will simply by being a nui
sance. *
The beggar has power over the
rich by getting in his way and ex
posing his sores.
Many a little woman rules her
big husband by her tears and com
plaints.
Up in Maine the other day a
Mrs. Louis C. Britton, of Skowhe
gan, when her husband brought
suit for divorce, went on a hun
ger strike and declared that until
her wayward spouse returned to
her his affection she would not eat.
She also tried to freeze herself to
death by refusing to make a fire.
There are all sorts of ways to
govern people, and not the least
effective is Government by Nui
sance.
Stars and Stripes
timely epitaphs.
Here lies the body of Ezra Jones
Who said in no uncertain tones.
"I'll take one drink and that will do."
It did. The funeral's at 2.
? . ?
When financiers dine together they talk
about Art. When artists dine together
they talk about Money.
If you hear an owl hoot: "To Whom"
instead of "To Who," you can make up
your mind he was born and educated in
Boston.
? ?. ?
If that crusade to prevent the tipping
of hats during cold weather succeeds
it will be the first anti-tlpping campaign'
that ever did.

SCIENCE QUERIES AND
REPLIES
JJANK and Shank live far away,
They are both unknown to me;
They have trouble every day.
And grow poorer constantly;
Shank's religion worries Hank,
Who declares it all dead wrong;
Hank's convictions bother Shank;
They have squabbled hard and long.
T ET Shank step In Hank's back yard.
And the fight Is on for fair;
Neither has the least regard
For the other's hide or hair.
Brickbata never cease to fly;
Shank may have a bloody noes.
But he biffs Hsnk in the eye;
So their ceaseless quarrel goes.
fTHEY are thin and down at heels,
^ Each is foul with grime and grease;
Neither of the two reveals
Any wish to keep the pesce;
They have let their children droop.
Both are bigoted and dense;
Neither of them cares a whoop
For what's known as common sense.
T HAVE friends who chide me for
My refussl to engsgs
In the never-ceasing war
That those distant flat-heads wsgs;
I'iy accased of selfishness
For the course that I've pursaed.
Bat I'll keep right on, I guess;
I've no stomach for a feud.
THEY AftE ALWAYS MISTAKEN.
Bone men think they are successful as soon
as they begin to gel mora than they earn
KNOWLEDGE.

IfAST areas of land hare b??en
* above ater for ages and
then submerged. And the same
land has been elevated again
j and covered with vegetation and
large trees. Thus excavators
for the Now York Board of
Water Supply have dug down
Into forests of vsst antiquity?In
fact, the first large trees known.
Three epochs of growth hare
been discovered. Thus a forest
would grow and then the land
would sink and be covered dar
ing centuries by ocean sedi
ment. An upheaval came, new
forests grew during thousands
of years, and sank again. So
far, three huge forest areas have
been excavated?three submer
gences and three risings, all in
Devonian period and near Gil
boa. N. Y.
It Is not known when man
first appeared earth, but
from my reading I have arrived
at a date of about 1,500,000
years ago.
One of the most perplexing
things to explain Is the enor
mous amount of strange writ
ings appearing In many parts of
the world about two submerged
continents. Alantls und?r the
Atlantic Ocean, and one that
was far larger. Pan, now be
neath the Pacific. The ao
counts of Atlantis now so
strangely appearing add to the
historic account of Plato.
Bu*. greater in quantity Is the
immense serleB of writing about
the continent Pan and its 200,

ff^HAT grouchy Scotch philoe-4
-1- opher. Thomas Carlyle, did
not add particularly to hia
popularity by referring to the
masses as "them-aaeee."
Whereby, of course. he
meant in nowise to be cotnpli- |
mentarv to the average per
son.
The same braw Scotsman
once said that the population
of England is forty millions?
mainly fools.
It does not answer Oarlyle's
wholesale Indictment to recall
the genial Dr. Holmes' witty
diagnosis of him, that you
could not expect a man with a
pessimistic stomach to be an
optimist.
That Carlyle was a con
firmed dyspeptic does not, in
Itself, impair the value of his
judgments. Lawyers commonly
seek to lessen the Influence of
opposing testimony by Impugn
ing the character of the wit
ness.
OUTSIDE of courts, since we
are trying to arrive at
truth instead of merely win
ning a case, we should look to
the Intrinsic value of the state
ment rather than at the ap
pearance or health or charac
ter of Its maker.
Not who or what you are,
but how true is what you state
as truth?this alone should
really count. Abuse is no an
Character a Money Maker?By the spectator.
QNE of the most noxious weeds to he
rooted out of a young person's mind
la the notion that the reason he !s
unpopular or unsuccessful is that he la
right and that everybody else is wrong.
Haslng Is not to be defended. It is
cruel and brutal. And yet we should
learn to see that there la something of
truth in every custom, no matter how
evil It'has become. And the truth that
underlies haxlng Is that most boys have
been coddled too much, and have devel
oped their vanity too greatly, and are
Improved by having their freshness
salted ? bit
WB trust this will not be mlsunder
? stood. Consistency Is for the high
gods only. As for us mortals, while we
condemn corporal punishment, there are
certain ones we would enjoy to see
spanked.
The fact Is, that material suocess?
success In the business world, suocess
in making money?does not rest upon
selfishness nor any form of tmmorallty.
The general rule is that It rests upon
honor. Integrity, industry and the com
plex of all the other virtues.
fOHN G. SHEDD, president of Marshall
J Field & Co, of Chicago, stated the
other day that la answer to the question
4- aa to what Ideala contribute most to
success in life, he unhesitatingly put the
emphaala first of all upon the importance
of sound character?"that Innate and
acquired disposition to do the right
thing at the right time In the right way."
He added that there Is practically no
hope of balldlng a successful life upon
the foundation of a faulty character.
The more complex civilisation bacomea,
the more the need, and. Indeed, the
absolute eaaantlallty of the moral vir
tues is demonstrated.
In former days the unmoral man wag
condemned because he waa wicked; in
theee days he Is no leas condemned,
bat It la because he Is an aaa.
J
Is Carlyle. for Instance, cor
rect in intimating that the
masses are asaee? Is the av
erage of us asinine, stupid,
foolish?
You know that moet of the
rest of us are dolts. How
about yourself. Seriously, now
are you or are you not one of
the masses?leaving aside, for 1
the moment, Carlyle's play
with the words?
?What are the masses, any
how?
The word as such suggests
hulk, magnitude, the greater
part. Commonly, as applied to
human beings. It means the
undistinguished, undlstlngulsh
able. poorer, uninfluentlal body
of the human race.
DEMOCRACY refuses such a
characterisation. That
spiritual principle, for which
America still stands?at least
theoretically asserts the In
finite worth of each humble in
dividual.
On the other hand, this fine
faith must not, for practical
purposes, be taken too serious
ly?even while we hold firm
to our faith.
?
Latterly, a* part of the
economic struggle, we have
taken into our language the
foreign-sounding word "prole
tariat" to describe the masses
That word has a hitter sig
nificanoa, suggesting that such
persons have only a breeding
value to society, to supply chil
dren for work snd war.
?YTELL, then, do YOU belong
?? to the masses?
You- do. if you are undis
tinguishable from the mass, if
you are insensitive, unrespon
sive. unaspiring, unambitious,
a mere animal living materi
ally. looking down Vnd not up.
Contrariwise, you are not a
proletarian, not of the masses,
if you are upward-looking,
human. spiritual. ambitious,
aspiring, responsive, sensitive.
IT is not a question of pov
erty or work, of riches or
loafing
Many s poodle-petting, lux
ury-loving social dawdler is
actually one of the masses?
though not a proletarian, be
cause this kind is not even a
bearer of children.
Whereas millions of the so
called masses are the salt of
the earth, the hope of the hu
man race, alive and ambitious,
productive and creative).
These are the happily Com
mon People whom?according
to Lincoln?God must have
loved, since he msde so many
of them.
Something to Think About
-By Bruno Leasing
PESSIMISTIC.
VOU hear a great deal of
talk these days about "de
structive criticism." It cornea,'
as a rule, from amiable, opti
mistic, Immature minds whose
reasoning runs something like
this:
"Do not destroy people's be
liefs unless you can give them
something bettsr In return.
Do not tear down unless you
can build up. Do not poin^
out errors unless you can in
dicate the truth. Do not take
away unless you can restore."
It makes rather pleasant
reading. These apostles of
hope never have difficulty In
finding an audience. "Most
people would rather look
toward a rosy future than take
a cold-blooded Inventory of
the present. But It accom
plishes no good. The path of
learning and of Improvement
does not run In this direction.
rC shattering of Illusions
Is the beginning of wis
dom. If you want to learn you
have to pay. quite often. In
coin or disappointment.
If you are happy In the
belief that the earth is flat?
as so many millions of people
were for agee?you must put
up with the shock that comes
when you discover It is round.
The child gets Kis first les
son. as a rule, when It learns
that Santa Claus 1s a myth.
It would he nice, when you
shatter this delusion, if you
could substitute some other
fictitious character. But you
cant.
11TE are all groping for the
? truth. Thoee warts on
the mind that represent all our
cherished but erroneous be
liefs and convictions are an
obstacle to our progress.
Do not be afraid of pessi
mism. It challenges your mind
and helps you sift the tnit
from the false. It may tell to
replace what It has removed.
But the groping of your brain
to find something to take Its
place will exercise Chat organ.
And when the brain begins to
exercise, the real process of
thinking Is born.
