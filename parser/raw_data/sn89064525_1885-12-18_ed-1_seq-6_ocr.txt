Great difficulty was experienced with Gov.

station to moot it, consequently no
demonstration. A noparate engine was
hitched to the car at the station here and"
it was run across the river to St. Bonitace,
where Riel'ti brother, Alexander, and a
number of half-breeds were in waiting with
sleighs to racoivo the body. They placed it
on one sleigh and drove it to his mother's
home at St. Vital, where all the family
and relatives were in waiting to re­
ceive it. The grief of the mother and wife
knew no bonnds when the body was
carried in. The box was opened, disclosing
the face, somewhat blackened and slightly
disfigured. The body was washed and
dressed before being exposed. The old
home vrn? heavily draped in black. The
body will be brought to St. Boniface cathe­
dral and grand requiem mans celebrated.
The body will be then interred by the side
of his lather in the St. Boniface Catholic
cemetery.

purchased their jborqestiiatls honestly as
those who resorted to dishohest "methods.
A strong effort will probably be made to

late residence, and its contents, stables,
horses, pictu -es, etc. etc., and $200,000 a

wer and to public charities,
$1,000,000. All the rest, residue and re­
mainder of all property and estate, real,
personal and mixed of any description and
wheresoever situated, he gave unto his two
sons, Cornelius Vanderbilt and William K.
Vanderbilt, in equal shares, and to their
heirs and assins, for their use forever. The
amount is estimated at about $100,000,
000, which willgiveeacli$50,000,000, which
sum is doubtk's equal or nearly equal to the
holdings of any living individual in the

The Burial of Vanderbilt,
The Vanderbilt family desired the re­
mains of the husband and father to be
conveyed to the toinb with as little dis­
play as possible, and their wishes were re­
spected. Fifth avenne is not much given
to display, even when a million­
aire is carried to his tomb, and
when the hour for the funeral ol Will­
iam H. Vanderbilt arrived Friday morning
the 10th, there were but few indications,
even in the neighborhood of the Vanderbilt
home that anything unusual was goiDg on.
Just three flags fluttered at half mast among
a plenty of bare poles. No badge of crape
was seen anywhere except on the little
electric bell at the Vanderbilt mansion.
The ceremonies in the church were simple
Episcopal burial services. They were con­
ducted by Rev. Dr. Cooke, the pas­
tor, and Mr. Oapo. Bishop Potter
was present in his robes, but did
not participate. The priests met the pall
bearers at the door of the church and pro
ceded them down the center aisle, chanting
as they walked along. Preceding the coffin
walked the pall bearers, wearing white
sashes. They were:
Chauncey M. Depew, J. Pierrepont Mor
gau. Charles R-apallo, William Turnbnll,
William Bliss, George J. Magee. C. M. Berger,
Charles C. Clark, Judge John It. Brady, W.
L. Scott, D. O. Mills and S. W. Caldwell.
The remains were taken to a ferry boat
and thence to New York, Staten Island
where is located the Vanderbilt rnansoleum'
Final Buriel of Louis Riel.
Winnepeg Special: Riel's remains were
laid to rest beneath the Catholic cathedral
at St. Boniface, the authorities being afraid
to bury them in a grave as they might be
stolen. To show the esteem in which the de­
ceased rebel was held, his people bore his re­
mains upon their shoulders all the way from
St. Vital, almostBix miles. To seotliestal
wart, rugged forms of eight half-breeds with
beards covered with frost struggling under
their load was a sight never to be forgotten.
Two paces in front of the coffin walked
Riel's two brothers, Joseph and Alexandre,
both stalwart specimens of their race.
The first sleigh in the procession contained
Riel's mother, his two sisters and his wife.
The poor old woman on leaving the house in­
sisted on walking in the procession, and did
so as long aa lierfaiKngetrength would bear
her up. She was at last obliged to fide in
a sleigh. The ordinary rcquim mass was
celebrated by the clergy at the cathedral.
The poor mother was weeping piteously,
as were also other members of the family
and relatives, a large number of whom
were present.
The Des Moines Valley Lands.
Senator Wilson, of Iowa, has renewed his
proposition to settle the old and vexed
question of title in the Des Moines valley.
These lands are along the Des Moines above
Kacoon lork. Under a grant in aid of a
canal in 184J5, they were improperly certi­
fied by the department of the interior to the
state of Iowa, therefrom located lands
sold by the United States, the state re­
ceived indemnity lands for them, and the
Iowa legislature, in 1866, ratified the ac­
ceptance. By this act the state was stop­
ped from all claims to the grant in the Des
Moines valley. Settlers went on these
granted lands supposing they were part 61
the public domain, the state treated them
as trespassers, and sued them.
What a Fall Was There.
Chicago, Special.—Hon. Henry O'Connor"

ing witness against Fred Hart, for having,
ho alleged, robbed him of his pocket book
and a. railroad pass. Weaving yet cn hie
swollen and discolored face the imprint
of intellectualilty, his ineffectual at­
tempts to appear the man he had
been, were pitiful to behold. Henry O'Con­
nor was for years attorney general of Iowa.
Fie is sixty years of age and has held many,
positions of trust and honor. The man
Hart was discharged and the decree of the
court was endorsed by the ex-attorney gen­
eral. Justice Mee gave the once eminent
lawyer some advice, and Mr. O'Connor
said
he would follow it. The escort of an officer
was given him to his hotel.

jealousy and family disputes. Poggi was en­

were scattered in a suburban wood. The
blood was boiled into black puddings which
were sold ih Toazi-'s shop. The sonmadea
confession. He narrated the story ki court
with a cold-blooded cynicism that pro­
voked a howl of Wry, the audience yelling,
"Away with him to the scaffold!" In re­
ply the murderer tauntingly Dcreamed,
"Here I am—tear me to pieces!" The, ter­
rible sfory has created intense excitement
throughout the city.

AFTER SIX YEARS.
BY MARY C. PRESTON.
*'I am giving you a treasure, my son.
Why do you hesitate? Surely you
have no other love?"
The sick man lifted himself on his
pillow, and looked eargerly, fearfully
in the face above him.
It was a haughty, yet frank coun­
tenance—a face which mingled strength
of will with pride, and tenderness
with truth, yet had enough poetic fire
in it to make the request his father
made of Clarence Livingstone a very
hard one for him to grant.
For F.lmar Livingstone, dying, re­
membered the wrongs done'by him "in
the days of nature," and, recalling a
lucky venture, which,by enrichinghim,
had beggared another, asked his son
to take that other's orphan daughter
for his wife.
Clarence knew nothing of the hour
of temptation which saw his father's
fall—knew of no reason -more powerful
than Christian charity which had in­
duced his father to adopt the penni
iess girl, when she was left alone in the
world and, full of fair dreams for hia
future, he shrank from a marriage
with one whom he had rarely seen, in
his years of study and travel,and who
was to him only a shy, awkward child
—no more.
"I have no love," he answered.
"Why do you ask this of me, my dear
father? Make any provision j'ou wish
for Miss Munroe dower her as richly
as you choose. But leave her, as I
pray you to leave nip, free. I have no
love lor her, nor she for me we are
strangers. Let us remain so, lest in
mating us as you would you do both
lives injury."
"Stoop down, Clarence. She loves
7011 you have been her hero, her idol
iov years. I have fostered her idola­
try for I have wished to atone for the
wrong I did her and there is but one
way—to make her the wife of my only
3on. My boy, you will not refuse to
make my last hours easier?"
'•Father, I would purchase your
peace with my life, were it possible.
But there is surely some other way
than this, and I will find it. What is
the wrong of which you speak? I
must know it, since I am to atone
and trust me, my father, though it
take my life, I will not fail to make
the atonement a complete one."
"Ther is no other way," moaned
the sick man "and since you bid me
unseal my lips, I will tell "you how I
gained my wealth, and planted niy
life with aloes of remorse, my son.
My cordial! The story is not long, but
very hard to tell—very hard my boy
—for it will make ou biush for your
father."
And, while the summer night closed
in, uray and spectral, Clarence Living­
stone, listening to bis father's story,
of a credulous friend betrayed, and
wealth snatched from a too" trusting
hand, bent hia young head in a humil­
iation wholly new and whclly intoler­
able to him.
Without, in the clustering shadows
of the veranda, drooping like a lily on
its stem, stood Lena Munroe, drink­
ing in the tale, with pulses beating as
strongly as those in the breast of her
Clarence, in her own girlish bosom
pain as keen, regret as bitter for she
had loved Elmar Livingstone as a
second father, and felt the sin of the
dying as keenly as the wrong done the
dead.
Besides, another pang was hers—for
Clarence had begged his father not to
ask him to be more than a stranger to
her!
The story was told, and the old man
lay panting on his pillows, his face
d'amp with dews of coming death and
the girl, peering into the chamber with
wide, pain darkened eyes, saw Clarence
on hia knees beside the couch.
"Forgive, me, my son! I did the
wrong for you," came hoarsely to her
from the draw# lips of the.dying.
"Slake her your wife, and all will be
well. She fs pure as a flower un­
packed. She has grown dear to me
as a daughter—and, my boy, she loves
you."
A hot flush crept into her face at
the low, broken words, but it died in­
stantly, for Clarence was replying, and
she bent her face to her hands as she
listened.
"She may be all you say," carne in
the clear tones of the young man but
she is 110 more to me than a flower
which I have no wish t-o gather. If
she lo.ves me, it is with a childish love,
which will not linger. Rest content,
father, she shall not suffer through
your—your regard for me. I will give
back every ill-gotten dollar. But I
will keep my freedom I can not sell
it, father.*'
"What do jrou mean?"
"That I will make over to Miss
Munroe every acre that you leave me
—every farthing that is ner due. J^ay,
not one dissenting word," as the old
man strove to speak. "Let me keep
my honesty, ana make my own way
with clean bands, if empty ones. I
would not offer my hand to your
ward now, even ^though I loved her,
which I do not."
"Clarence, my son!"
"Fatner,
.JO
more, but trust to
me now you shall sleep."
The girl, shaken by- hushed' sobs,
turned from the silvery night, and
glided into the house like a shadow.*
Ere morning dawned, the soul of
Elmar Livingstone had gone, where
human eye could not follow its flight,
free of the clogging clay, to its judg­
ment.
And, as untraceable, it would seem,
as the spirit of the man who had
wronged her, yet guarded her youth,
Lena Munroe had also gone with the
night, leaving no token behind her,
bidding no farewell.
Six years later the accident occur­
red on the midnight train which filled
the hospital of G—with moaning life,
or crushed and shapeless bodies, in
which was left scarcely strength to
sigh.
The nurses went from pallet to pal­
let, holding bandages, aiding to bind
up great gaping wounds, shrinking
from the sight of severed arms, but
putting personal feeling away before
the great needs that met them.
One nurse, with sweet, blue eyes,
tender and pitiful, gave a low cry at
last, as the surgeon, whose assistant
she was, paused besirle a cot 011 which
a young man lay unconscious.
"You know him?" the surgeon asked
her, regarding her blanched face curi­
ously.
She bent her head in silence, a sob
bursting from her lips.
Half an hour later he lay there un­
der her eyes, cold and still, with strips
of linen across his bosom, a broken,
bandaged arm, and court plaster hold­
ing together the red edges of a gash
that ran perilously near the temple
and she knelt beside the cot with an
ashen pain in her young face, as she
stroked back the hair from his fore­
head.
"After six years!" sne whispered
softly. "Oh, my loye! after six years,
during which time I have striven to
forget your face, to see it so cold and
white! But you shall be more tender­
ly cared for than though you had a
sister near you and when you are well
enough to know me, we part again."
For the crushed and wounded man
was Clarence Livingstone, the. kneeling
nurse the girl to whom he had refused
his dying fat her to make offer of his
hand—Lena Munroe.
Long days and nights followed each
other, and Clarence waked from stu­
por to mad delirium, in which he told
his patient nurse all of which she al­
ready knew, and much besides—told
her of the wealth he had vowed never
to touch, lying in his solicitor's hands
for tliegirl he could not trace of strug­
gle and trial which he had gone through
which made her blue eyes dim.
But he said no word of any woman
whose love was his guerdon, and she
was glad that was spared her.
Once in a midnight hour, when the
ward wns silent and the lights low
about them, he suddenly put forth
his uninjured hand and took one of
hers his eyes, brilliant with fever,
were fastened 011 her face.
"My father loved you as a daugh­
ter," he
said softly, "and he told me
you loved me but I did not believe,
and I wanted him to leave me free.
Child, why did you fly from me? Did
you fear I would learn to love you?"
She bent her face, and tears flowed
silently down her cheeks.
It was delirium, she knew: but she,
who had been unable to forget, re­
membering that long hour in the ear­
ly night too vividly not to again feel
some of its pain as she heard him.
It was weeks later when, after a
long sleep, he wakvned to full con­
sciousness one morning at day-dawn.
The lights were low, the scene spec­
tral, as his languid eyes turned from
object to object.
At last they rested on the quiet fig­
ure of his nurse, asleep in her chair,
and there they lingered.
How sweet and girlish the weary
face was, under the stiff cap!—and sad,
too, as though this life was not such
as her heart yearned for. And the
hands lying idly in her lap were so fair
and white and slender, dainty enough

tearing of linen and lifting of dyiir
heads, he told himself.
Tlion a sort of memory came to him
of those soft fingers on his brow, when
it had seemed burning of that sweet
face bent over him in his delirium,
when he had taken it for the iace of
an angel.
He had seen it- before, but where?
Perhaps^-in one of his day dreams.
Now he would never forget, hetold him­
self, as. his own eyes closing, hedropped
off to sleep.
It was mid-day when he waked again
and found her bending over him, and
this time he x-ecognized her.
"Lena!" he cried, tr}ring to put out
his hand.

But he was too weak. It fell on the

"You know me?" she said softly,
turning paler.

glow in his eyes—"you are an heiress,

"I know it all," she broke in "and
that was why I left Lynn as I did.
Did you think I would beggar you?
And your father bad been kind tome.
I forgave him because he loved me. I.

"Then share it witb me," he said
Softly. "I would not ask you once,

because love has grown in my heart

nursed me back to life from what must
have been very nearly death. Will

"At day dawn, while I watched you
asleep in your chair, ere 1 knew who
you were. Lena, do not doubt me!"
"I do not." She knelt at thecotand
put back his hair, as he had dreamed
she did while he was unconscious.
"Arid I will own to you, Clarence,that
I have loved you always since I first
saw you. That was why I fled from
Lynn."
"And now you will come back?"
"For the same reason," she smiled,
although her lip3 were tremulous.
"Love sent me forth then love recalls
me now, and I will share the posses­
sions with you which were neither
honestly yours nor mine, but can be­
long fairly to us together. Yes, Clar­
ence, I will go back!"

By and by a young man went over
and sat down beside him. This young
man might have been directed by filial
affection, and hemieht not. "Which
way, uncle?" he softly asked.
"Me? Oh, I'm goin' to see my darter
in Connecticut."
"Ever travel much."
"This is the first time I was ever on
the keers. I've driv off seventeen miles
with the oxen to see my other darter,
but oxen haint no comparison to these
keers."
"I should siay not. It takes a lotol
money to go to Connecticut and back."
"Drefful lot, but I jist sold the farfe,
you know."
"I presume you could change a hun­
dred-dollar bill for me?"
"Oh, jist as well as not/'

This is good weather, eh?"
"Strordinary weather fur fall.
James has been worried about his
corn,.but I guess it's all safe."
Njjlhing further was said for sortie
time, the old man looking out of the
window and the youns man reading a
paper.. The train made a few stops,
and the car was so warm that after a
while the old man began to yawn
and nod. He fought it off for ten min­
utes, but at last his head fell back,
and his gentle snores mingled with the
roar of the wheels.
A slim white hand, with tapering
fingers, rented on his leg then it was
elevated to his biv.asL Its touch was
that of a feather. Its movement was
that of a serpent creeping forward to
strike. The fingers touched an old
fashioned wallet. The young man
continued to read, and the old man
slept 011. Inch by inch the wallet was
lifted from its snug resting place, and
the hand was almost ready to remove
it entirely, when something happened.
With a sudilen movement of his right
hand the old man pinned the interlop­
er fast, and hi-, voice was heard call­
ing:
"You blamed skunk! But I knowed
all the time what you were after!
W here's the conductor!"
There was a rush of passengers, and
they found a helpless, confused pick­
pocket, rind an indignant, but yet elat­
ed old man.
"Consarn hi.s picktur, but he took
me fur an ole haystack from aback
medder! Work roots on me will ye!
Sot a trap fur^hie and fell into it yer
self, eh?"
Even a professional pickpocket
hadn't cheek enough to urge a single
excuse. The fellow hadn't oneblessed
word to say, and was walked off to
the baggage, car to be kicked to the
platform at the next station.
"Y'e see," said the old man, as I10
turned to the inquiring passengers,
"I hadn't orter done it. W hen a man
has bin constable, Sheriff, or drover
all his days, travellin' all over and
meetiu' with all sorts of folks, he
hadn't orter play off greenhorn and
break a young man's heart like this,

French Novels.
Vernpn Lee in Contemporary Review'.
I tell you frankly that I can scarce­
ly think of a dozen modern French
novels in whi.-h 1 should not like to cut
out whole passages, sometimes wdiole
chapters, from Balzac to Dandet.
Let me explain myself, and recapitu­
late what I consider the sins of the
modern French novels. One of these
fortunately rare, but gaining giound
every day, can be dismissed at once I
mean the allusion to particular kinds
of evil which are so exceptional and ab-
1 11
derivable from knowledge of them
must inevitably be utterly outweighed
by the disadvantage of introducing
into the mind vague find diseased sus­
picions. The other principal sins ol
modern French novelists are," to my
mind, first, the presentation of re­
markable evil without any comment
011 the part oft he author, or without
any presentation of remarkable good
to counterbalance, by its moral and
resthet-ical stimulus, the enervating ef­
fects of familiarity with evil. The
sight of evil is not merely necessary il
evil is to diminish it is wholesome ii
it awakens indignation it is good for
us to maintain our power of taking
exception, of protesting, of hating it
is good for us, iu moral matters to
have the instinct of battle. But this
becomes impossible if evil is represent­
ed as the sole oocupant of this earth.
In that case we no longer have any
ono to fight for, and we run the risk
of forgetting how to light for ourselves.
So much for the demoralizing effects of
the pessimistic misrepresentation or,
at ali events, the representation of an
unfairly specimen of life. It distinct­
ly diminishes our energies for good.
The other, and I decidely think even
worse, great sin of French novelists is
their habit of describing the physical
sides of love, or of what people call
love, whether it be socially legitmatfl
or socially illegitmate. Such descrip­
tions are absolutely unnecessary for
the psychological completeness ol
their work, since they drag the mind
and the intellectual emotions into re­
gions below their cognizance, and cram
them with impressions they can never
digest, which remain as a mere foul
nuisance besides by stimulating in­
stincts which require not stimulation,
but repression, tbey entirely betray
the mission or a!! intellectual work
which is, to develop the higher sides
of our nature, at the expense of the
lower. There not a single^descrip­
tion oi this kind which might not
most advantageously be struck out,
and I could have gone 011 my knees to
Flaubert to supplicate him to sup­
press whole passages and pages oi
"Mme. Bovary," which I consider a
most moral and useful novel*
A scrupulous village physician was
the hero of a curious little scene in an
English court of petty sessions the
other day. He appeared as a witness,
but declined to take an oath on the
ground "that it was a very serious
thing to kiss a book that was handled
by all kinds of people." After some
argument the doctor offered, by way
of compromise, to kiss the book if
a
clean sheet of paper were placed over
the cover. This the bench declined to
accede to, nor would it allow the doc­
tor to make
an affirmation,
and even­
tually he consented, under |totest to
"run the risk of catching disease,"
