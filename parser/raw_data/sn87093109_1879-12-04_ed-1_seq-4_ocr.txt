insured.
The balance unexpended t>f the
Grant reception fund at Portland,

commendation.
The city assessment of Portland,
Oregon, just completed, shows an in
crease of taxable property over that
assessed last year to the amount of
$710,650, which is a creditable show
ing for the metropolis of the Colum

Xannanßuck, Ksq. U. >S. District]
Attorney for Idaho, states that there ,
is a strolls; probability that several j
of tlio Indians captured by Lieut.
Farrow and his command, will be j
given up to the civil authorities to be ;
tried for their crimes, as there is
ample testimony both to identity
of them and to prove their guilt.
Congress met 011 Monday in regular
session, and but little lias been done
aside from receiving the usual annual
message and reports of departments.
The message is a lengthy document,
but contains nothing startling,except
it be a proposition to retire all green
backs from circulation, which can
hardly be accomplished against the
j;i linneiit of nearly all parties.
The Columbia river country has
Wen surprised liy tho sudden death
of Mr. A. J. Gillikan of Cowlitz county,
who recently attained notoriety as a
party in a hotly contested divorce;
suit. He died at the Occidental hotel
in Portland, on Friday, and bv his
bedside was found a bottle labeled
laudanum. It is a fact beyond rionht
that whiskey was at the bottom of
most of his troubles.
Two of the Indians who murdered
the Perkins family a year ami a half
ago during the Bannack war, were
hung at Yakima city on the of
X 'Vemb r. The citizens present were
fully arnie 1, but there was no disturb

-tntes evidence, three being shot in
att inpts to capt ire them, one in ut
t. m ting to bn a 1; jail, and two hung.
Jay (iould is coming to the front
aL'iiin ia railroa i matters, in connec
tion wit!i a Pacific ocean route. Hav
ing control of a chain of routes to the
Missi.-sippi lie cannot be satisfied
until Jay (jould's railroads reach the
western oetan. He tried for years to
g -t control of tin' Central Pacific, hav
ing already the l*nion Pacific, but
failing on this, trod with ex-Senator
Mitchell and other* to gobble up the
Northern Paeific. That this failed
was n«t for the want of hard work
and the assistance of unscrupulous
men on this coast, but fail he d'd.
Xow he i- after the Atchison, Topeku
and Santa Fe road and its new line
now building to -an Diego, and a re

with the aid of Boston capitalists Jie

An act approved Nov. 14, pro
vides that all barrels, packages or cans
containing fish caught within this
Territory, and packed, barrelled or can
ned therein, shall be marked by lalnd
or otherwise in plain letters, with the
name of the place where said salmon
were caught, and also the name of the
Territory in full, and the name of the
party or parties putting up the same.
And for each package, barrel, part of
a barrel or can not so marked the per
son or persons whose duty it l» to mark
the saline, shall W subject to a penalty
of not less than ten dollars, to be re
covered by action brought by any per
son first informing in a court having
jurisdiction, and one-half of the sum
recovered shall go into tlie common

fjalf to the informer.
A London dispatch of Dec. Ist says
that the Queen of Kngland is reported
as suffering from a severe billions
attack, and although the court physi
cians seem to attach but little impor
tance to this illness, many persons
1 are inclined to look upon her niajes
; ty's sickness in a much more serious
| light. The queen is now 60 years of
age and has always enjoyed exception
ally good health, but has a constitu
tion liable to break down suddenly
under forms of illness to which she
may now be considered subject. Con
siderable solicitude is publicly ex
pressed over the matter both for per
sonal reasons and in view of the
j political effect which might attend
her possible demise at the present
time.
! At the last session of the county
' commissioners'court in the counties
of Pierce, Thurston, Lewis and Cow
' litz, an adjustment of the claims of
these several counties against the
Northern Pacific Railroad for delin
quent taxes was made. It was agreed
i that, if said Company would pay three
per centum upon its gross earnings in
this Territory for the past two years,
into the treasuries of the several coun
ties prior to I)cc. Ist 1879, such amount
should be accepted i;i lieu of or full
payment of, all the past taxes due
from the Company, including that of
the current year. This action was
ratified by the legislature, and the !
Company has already made the stipu
lated payment. The division of the
j amount was to be made upon the pro
| rata of road in each county. There :
| are 1 :>i> miles, in all, of road, in the |
j four counties , of which Thurston has
27 miles, and its share of the payment (
was SUiMi.2O. Til addition to this will
!be about more as its share of the
tax on the company's rolling stock.
It was further stipulated that the com
promise should not in any way affect
| future taxation of the Company's i
property in the several comities,—
| Olympici Conri< r.
According to the annual report of
the general land olliee, just issued,
the homestead entries for the past
year exceed those of any previous
i year for a long period. The area taken
in homesteads last year was .".Jim. 111
acres.
The Oregon Barrel Factory Co. have
' \ begun construciton of two additions
' to their buildings at St John's. One
addition will be ollx'il) feet and tile
i other 1Sx:!i), l>otii two stories high.
As soon a> .satisfactory arrangements
' are made they will commence tlie
manufacture of tubs and buckets.
The great rise in the value of Xorth
icm Pacific stock has brought the
I bankrupt estate of Jay Cook A Co.
, I clear out of debt and left It a surplus.
It is now shown that every creditor
1 will receive his money in full, and
that for every S limit of indebtedness
, there are cash resources to the amount
of >1,07J.:!7. This is an astonishing
result for an estate whose liabilities
once amounted to ss,oimi,(Wio.
There is a large-eopcof agricultlira
land lying along the banks of the Col
! umbia and Weiiaehie, upon which the
water for irrigation purposes could be
| easily brought. The Indians in this
neighborhood, a majority of them, are
securing their "Boston papers," and
locating on the most desirable por
tion-. They are making some sub
stantial improvements in the way of
building lou houses, the logs forwhieh
they haul about four miles. The com
ing season many will plant crops.
Wong Fook, wiio was convicted in
Portland in the circuit court of mur
der in tile first degree, his crime be
ing the killing of his mistress Hetjuai,
was sentenced by Judge Bellinger,
Saturday morning, to be hanged Tues
day, January Jo, ]ssn. Xoapplication
for a new trial was made, and in all
probability he will sutler the death
penalty at the appointedtillie. Fook's
attorney, however, has published a
notice t bat an application to <Jovernor
Thayer for a commutation of sen
tence will be made.
From dispatches recently received
it wouid appear that the new Cuban
insurrection was becoming a werious
affair. Tin* insurgents are mustering
by thousands, and carrying on the
\> ar in their jieculiarfash'ion of pillage
and burning, while the Spanish au
thorities are at their wits' ends and
look anxiously for reinforcement from
Europe. It would be interesting to
know whether the revolt has any
other motive than pillage. It has
been understood that Spain was intro
ducing the reforms demanded with all
convenient spetd.
The reports all indicate that there
is a very melancholy winter before
tlie people of France. The price of
bread is high, the )«>tato crop is ruined
by blight and many vineyards will
not yield sufficient to pay for gather
ing tile few m attered L'fopes. Add to
this that the people of Ijjrope gener
ally are in the same fix and cannot
therefore buy the thousand and one
nicknacks which form the bulk of
French good* exports, and the outlook
is seen to be gloomy indeed. Stone of
us in this country are still inclined
, to complain of the dullness of the
times, but we are now «t the bight
of prosperity compared to the people
across the water.
A Chicago telegram to tlie Milwau
kee Sentinel says that during the stay
of <»ratit in Chicago, large numbers of
politicians from many states were in
that city, taking observations of the
situation, most of whom expressed
their conviction that the effort to
make a third term boom was an ap
parent and even conspicuous failure.
Father Conrady, the Catholic Priest
in charge of the Missionary Depart
ment at the Umatilla Indian Reserva
tion, is reported by the East Oregonian
as stating that a census of the Indians
011 the reservation will soon be taken,
preparatory to their removal or their
settlement. The Priest is of the opin
ion that but few of the families 011 the
reservation will remain; most of them
being determined to lead a nomadic
life. He thinks that many of them
will go to Moses, and others to the
Xez Perce country.
A little daughter of James M. Lamb,
on Dry creek, above "Walla Walla,
died instantly last week, the circum
stances attending her death being
both remarkable and extraordinary.
A month or two previous she hail an
attack of diphtheria, from which she
had, apparently, entirely recovered.
On the morning of her death she
seemed unusually vivacious, ond after
playing around the house got up into
her sister's lap to partake of some
food from her hands. The little one
took one spoonful only when she fell
back and expired.
