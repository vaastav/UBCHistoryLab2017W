THE WILMINGTON" MESSENGEB. TUESDAY vDECEMBEK 11, 100.
-2JORrn Carolina mtjs X produce
ITS OTVX FOOD.
. One of the Important things for the
-'south is to make all the meat tt needs!
- and to cease to be so dependent upon
the northwest. Our great Vance once
ridiculed the Idea of keeping: our corn
cribs elsewhere than in North Carolina
and . our emoke-houses in the distan
west. He was wise in this as in all that
-concerned the welfare and prosperity
of the people of North Carolina. The
Messenger has many times essayed toj
stir the people In the matter of raising
their own horses, bogs, cows and sheep
It will be indeed a most useful and wise
act when this is done. Any agricultural
people are very Inconsiderate and sim
ple who fall to produce their own but
tier and milk, bread and meat. The
road to independence and general pros
perity for this state and the south.
does not lie along manufacturing half)
o much as in Judicious, common-sense
farming. The south Is capable of pro
ducing immensely in bread-stuffs and
pork and beef It Is sheer neglect when
it fails to crow all it needs. It has a
climate in which you can work eleven
months in the year. The soil Is. well
luiapted to a considerable variety of
products. Toil, Judgment, interprlse, a!
determination to accomplish great!
things and depend on no other state orj
people for bread and meat, butter and
lard, hog and hominy will In the end
make North Carolina all it should be.
-wholly dependent upon itself and not
upon others.
Housekeepers In "Wilmington, all
about the state and all through the
south are forced to Day some 3 of 4
cents a pound more for white meat,
lams, lard than they were paying e;
Tear or two ago. "Why so? Because of
a. failure to produce the meat necessary
Cor home consumption and the giant
trusts that In their greed put up the
prices to pluck and afflict the consum
era, the tollers, the hungry. If every
-Cannes produced extra meat for mar
ket, and every smoke house was well
filled with hams, sides, shoulders, back
bones, sparerlbs, sausage then the peo
ple would rejoice and contentment and
-live and let live prices would prevail.
The Jacksonville Times-Union has
'this and it Is applicable here:
"Now shall the south always buy Its
meal from the west? Is there any good
reason why we should not sell meat tO:
the west instead of buying from It?
Scientists have conclusively proved
that in a cold climate a large propor
tkm of the food furnished goes to the
manufacture of necessary heat only
farmers in the west are beginning' to
warm their stables with stoves, because
"it is cheaper to furnish heat without
taxing the stomach for digestion, and
-coal or wood is cheaper than forage.
"What Is the lesson for us? That our
climate should enable us to sell cheap-!
- er meat than the west, as soon as other
conditions are equal here little of the
'food need go for heat, and nearly all
vcan be changed Into flesh."
Wise farming, well directed energy.
a determination to be Independent on
the part of all producers will have a
great influence over the future of our
great state. The fisheries of North
Carolina are extensive and can be
srreatly developed. "Why not? Nature
does Its part, let man hold up his end
of the log. Lt all North Carolina unite
In the resolution that all necessary food
shall be produced within its borders.
'There can be no real independence
i short of that.
RUNMX; REVIEW OF TI1E
MESSAGE.
As we wrote yesterday there is so
'-very much In McKinley's message that
a mere reference to all the topics and
opinions thereon would require large
sraoeand many editorials. Governor
Russell or some one else has said that
-the people forget what has happened
in two years." It is certain that th
events of two years of much importance
disappear from the recollections of
many, and politicians are lauded for the
act of today wnile their baseness a little
while back. Is buried in the deep ocean!
-of oblivion. McKinley's record for ten
years should be carefully prepared for
the enlightenment and warning of the
jmerican people.
In the message you will find this;
"It will be the duty as I am sure It
will be the disposition of the congress to
ptovkle whatever further legislation is
needed to insure the continued parity
under all conditions between our two
forms of metallc money, silver and
sold."
The republican party is not only in
complete control now, but it looks as
if it might continue in power Indefinite
ly. The detestable, corrupting, com
pelling means resorted to In the Nov
ember election can perpetuate the grip
of the most venal of parties to the time
wnen the bottom will fall out. It has,
therefore, full power to fix and fasten

oot again disturb the country and au
rthorize the threats and clamor tor ai
ramie for a long time. Stability and!
. satisfaction are needed in this conn
try. It has been shown, there are nun
'rddsg of moneyed men who will create
au panic scare any time to save an elec
tion. Let the republican party so deal
-at once with the question as to shut out!

The president recognizes' the responsi-J
IsHirv of his -DartT. and says that it 'is
committed to such legislation as will
better make the currency responsive tt
the varying needs of business at all
Treasons and in an sections."
He urges the reduction of taxes, but
now this can be done Judiciously with:
iC&t schemes before cne congress does
not appear. "With a distant, costly war
on hand; with a huge pension roll, in
creasing constantly, requiring at least
J140.000.000; with a ship subsidy scheme
that will draw out from the people over
J 100,000,000; with the Nlcaraguan canal
to construct, how can there be a safe
reduction of the enormous taxes now
collected?
He wants the Hanna subsidy Job fa
vored and he is not particularly force
ful or earnest in his reference to the
gigantic trusts.
He Is not altogether satisfactory in
Ills dealing with Porto Rico and Cuba.
in the former there is a civil govern
ment. It belongs to the United States,
and yet there t3 a tariff against its pro
ducts coming into this country. What
would be said if Massachusetts' pro
ducts could npt be Introduced into New
York or North Carolina without paying
at the custom houses 15 per cent?
He favors free delivery for tne rural
districts. The Richmond Dispatch con
sidering this feature of the message in
dulges in this strain of rebuke and in-
formation:
"It appears that 2.614 routes are now
in operation In forty-four states and
territories, serving a population of 1,
01.424. How happy these people should
be! How much -more blessed than we
are! We wish to heavens we could see
a good 'rural postal system' In Virginia.
The thing the president discusses we
know very little about, but what we do
know is that the present mail service
in many parts of the Old Dominion Is
disgraceful to the United States gov
ernment, and Is a delusion and a snare
to the patrons of the post office depart
merit-"
Last year, we are informed. 45,000 new
pensioners were added to the already
greatly swollen list. He favors reap
portlohment of members of the house.
The president much Impressed us with
what he said In the way of dignified
caution against reckless, unseemly ex
travagance on the pant of his folks in
the congress. He said wisely:
"In our great prosperity we must
guard against the danger it invites of
extravagance in government expendi
tures and appropriations, and the
chosen representatives of the people
will, I doubt not, furnish an example
m itneir legislation of that wise econo
my which in a jeason of plenty hus
bands for the future. In this era of
great business activity and opportun
ity caution is not untimely. It will not
abate, but strengthen confidence. It
will not reitard, but promote legitimate,
industrial and commercial expansion."
.But who really expects the present
or the next congress to heed these most
timely and very needed words of cau
tion? "When was the republican party
ever moderate In expenditure? Since
it got into power Lt has rushed at im
mense speed and the increase of ex
penditure has been fearfully swift and
greaJt. The political editor on the
"Washington Post. Mr. H. S. "West, who
visited Wilmington In the time of the
"Revolution," and Is a very pleasant
and interesting gentleman. New York
state born, in a paper In The Forum for
December says this, and he is a repub
lican: "A thousand new rivulets combine to
swell the broad stream of congressional
appropriations. The republican party is
not a party of economy. It is always
liberal in providing for the government;
and though this liberality sometimes
approaches the danger line of extrava
gance, there is no doubt 'that it Is a
wiser policy than the cheese-paring of
the democrats. Sustained by the ver
dict of November 6. the republican
leaders In congress will feel Justified in
recommending large appropriations; I
look, therefore, for budgets of unequal
led magnitude."
The expectation will be met with
abounding gifts and expenditures. The
"broad stream" will become a great
bay. He says the "overflowing treasury
will Invite expenditures on a mammoth
scale, and the probability is that the in
vitation will be accepted." Yea, verily,
and the people will look on In stolid in
difference or in profound anxiety. The
first session of the present congress
the Fifty-sixth actually voted away of
the people's money J674.000.000. Mr.
West says of this tremendous sum
"nearly one quarter or J143.000.000, was
distributed In pensions." As to the In
creasing pension roll, he says that lit is
impossible to decrease 'the present sum
that "the pension list is being swollen
daily as the result of the war with
Spain and the continuing war In the
Philippines; and lt will require the
greatest amount of firmness on the part
of the republican leaders to withstand
the appeal of the pensioners for allow
ances even more liberal than they now
Teceive."
Well then may our esteemed Rich
mond contemporary, the Dispatch, tell
Its readers that "It Is (to be expected
, that McKinley's second administration
will Inaugurate an era of profuse ex-
.. travagance, from which favored inter
ests and
people will
grow rich."
Re
member that the pension roll of the
United States costs the tax-payers a
greater sum' than any European power
pays for; keeping up its stupendous
army, with probably the one exception
of Russia. As to an economic future
it must be admitted that the outlook
is somewhat lowering and tokening a
still greater down-pour.
EXCELLENT ADDRESS ON VANCE.
We had not read the address of Rich
ard H. Battle, LL.D.. on the late Sena
tor Vance, when we received it a few
days ago in pamphlet form containing
74 pages. The address occupies 68
4 pages. We have read It with very gen
uine pleasure and satisfaction. It is a
meritorious, well prepared and interest
ing discussion. It is in fact very much
of a biography and gives an excellent
presentation of the great statesman
and patriot, that we are now very
much inclined to accept as the greatest
man yet born In this great state.
Knowing Mm well for some thirty
years we read the address with una
bated rest from beginning to end. Any
one who would know much of the life
of the really great North, Carolinian
should read what Dr. Battle saya. It
brings out In clear light the massive.
noble character of the man of the peo
ple, by all odds the most popular of all
North Carolinians. It is an address to
treasure, for every citizen should be fa
miliar with the chief events of one of
the foremost men of the American
Union. Read and inwardly digest, and
you will find your heart much warmed
and your enthusiasm excited and your
admiration intensified at the story of
a life so patriotic; so upright,' so noble,
so generous, so fascinating, so "rich In
saving common sense."
We marked a few places for. com
ment, but pass them by with one ex
ception. iWe have understood for more
than a quarter of a dentury that the
late admirable and pure Justice
Joseph J. Davis, of the Supreme court.
was with. Senator Ransom when the
late Judge George W. Brooks was In
terviewed as to the Issuing of the ha
beas corpus. See page 64. The proof
reading is defective. Dr. Battle has per
formed his work very faithfully and
justly. He has written like a personal
friend and admirer, but has not been
extravagant or injudicious. Aside from
the usual narrative there are some fine
passages elevated and rhetorical. You
will find such an pages 10-11, 69-70, 72-73-74.
There are some noble passages
quoted from Vance. Read the address.
OPINIONS OF THE MESSAGE.
McKlnleys message is or course
lauded by the republican press. We
have noticed but one democratic paper
as praising it the Atlanta Constlution.
Most of the abler democratic papers
speak out without wool in the mouth.
The caution, the non-committalism of
the president Is apparent to many. The
Philadelphia Record says "he will enter
upon the last four years of his admin
istration with as few absolute commit
tals as possible." It Is In many re
spects devoid of decision and Is really
a "colorless" performance as the Co
lumbia State holds. That ably edited
paper In its review of it strikingly and
felicitously says:
"We give the president's message am
ple praise when we say that it might
have been written by the chief clerk of
his private secretary without undue
strain upon the mentality of that to us
unknown individual. It Is the most
colorless and perfunctory annual mes
sage which has emanated, from the
White House in this generation and it
is not easy to find in it a-point suffi
ciently salient to goad to controversy.
Throughout it is marked. In an excep
tional degree even for a production of
William McKinley, by a nerveless and
spineless incertitude, a flabby shrinking
from positive positions, it is little more
than a clerkly abstract of the reports of
sub-olffclals." x
That Is fair correct Judgment, incisive
and caustic. It Is the best written and
most pointed! discussion of the plati
tudinous and opaque document that we
have seen. While by no means compli
mentary, lt Is not partisan but Just and
applicable. One more extract we take
from the editorial. It says :
"The president Is non-committal about
China, non-committal about South
Africa, non-committal about the Alas
kan boundary, non-committal about
trusts, non-committal about Cuba and
Puerto Rico, and largely non-committal
about the Philippines. His words as to
th latter are as smooth as butter and
may serve as an unguent to the minds
of those who, like himself, would pre
fer to have red-handed spoliation ar
rayed in the white raiment of benevo
lence." ,
After reading the message the At
lanta Journal concludes that "it may be
accepted as a reliable program of re
publican conduct after the, fourth of
next March, when its radical element
will be in complete and Irresistible con
trol of the government." That is no
doubt the correct expectation fully
justified by all that has happened until
now. So certain is this that Hanna is
the engineer now running the republi
can train In the senate. He Is McKin
ley's chief cook In the congress as he
has been his controller and boss In the
last five years. -The Philadelphia Re
cord turns on a little light ait this point
In saying: :
"Therefore .he will not . tolerate the
idea that there can be any failure of
the ship subsidy scheme, which would
involve the government I nai expen
diture of J270.000.000. There Is reason to
think that the republican manager
pledged himself to oush this bill
through congress as a means of raising
his enormous campaign fund and for
the delivery of certain thousands of
votes."
CUTTING DOWN REPRESENTATION
Mr. Crumpbacker, of Indiana, intro
duced a bill in the house to reduce the
representation of Louisiana, Mississip
pi, North and South Carolina by
13 votes, upon a. basis of 198,000 popula
tion to a district. This Infamous bill
will deprive North Carolina of four
members of the congress. That it is an
outrage pjain, deliberate and malicious
no man of sense and honesty will deny.
The plan of this fanatic from Hoosier
dom is that all the negroes In the four
states are or will be disfranchised an
Idea that no sane or informed man can
hold. Force bills were tried by the Mc
Kinley crowd for years to give control
to the republicans. Now to humiliate
and rob and punish these states for un
doing the dangerous, unwise, and
stupid work of the .republicans in giv
ing the entire body of negroes over
twenty-one years old, including thou
sands who voted under that age, the
right of the ballot, but undoing it only
in part, by an educational test that the
supreme court and all sound lawyers
know to be constitutional, this fellow,
and those in sympathy .with him, un
dertakes to apply a drastic law of re
venge and to cut down representation.
Not according to the actually, disfran
chised, but according to the negro pop
ulation. Blindness, madness, meanness
are still factors among a class of re
publican politicians.
If the republican committee indorses
the Crumpbacker bill and recommends
its adoption it may pass the, house.
But as yet we are not prepared to be
lieve that the whole republican mem
bers are fanatics and fools. We must
hope that there are enough of moder
ate, reflecting, informed non-partisans
on the republican side to defeat this
outrage upon four states with the help
of the democratic members.
TOO FAR IN ADVANCE.
The Messenger Is not the paper to
praise MrA Bryan in a campaign, and
after a magnificent canvass and a sig
nal defeat. to turn upon him and re fid
him. He is the same able, honest, purs
resourceful, true man In defeat as he
was when bearing In his clean
hand the great banner of the
democracy. But we do not see wisdom
in his declaration in an article In the
North American Review that the elec
tion made no decision as to the money
question, or of any other question. We
have not seen his paper, but quotations
from it. He will be heard from later
he says, of "bow the money question
influenced the campaign." He appears
to think that money In the republican
hands and the prosperity did f the
thing. We do not know that the state
ment or deduction in the Atlanta Jour
nal is correct that Mr. Bryan really
still "considers himself the logical can.
didate for the presidency to 1904." A
great many things are sure to happen
before that year comes.' Greater for
eign wars than any this country has
ever encountered may be upon it. or
geat domestic, disturbances may have
occurred or be on hand in that year.
The rapldy growing expenditures, the
power of the trusts and the aggres
slves of a strong government may put
quite another aspect upon pubic affairs
and will demand new and Vigorous
means to meet them. It Is far too
soon now to speculate on 1904. As
"privaitLe" John Allen, of Mississippi,
the noted wit and humorist says of
the future of the democratic party;
"I'm like Gorman. Gorman says 'let's
wait several months before we think."
A "ROOT" OF PROMISED EVIL.
Secretary Root went to Cuba and lost
his notes for his report to the congress
of the doings of the war department.
It was perhaps fortunate as his hastily
prepared, condensed report is better
and clearer than ever before. This de
partment, be it remembered Is now a
very busy one, as It has many big
things on its hands, such as the war In
the Philippines, China, Cuba, Porto
Rico, Alaska, etc. The task set Is of
large size and will continue to try and
vex the department. But Mr. Root is
thoroughly pleased over his achieve
ments and expresses his feelings with
conscious pride and freedom. He brags
and promises and asks. For instance
he wants the congress to trust him
with enlarged powers and tells the re
publican members that all is well, the
country is safe, patriotism runs high
and glory Is ahead. He Is an optimist
of the expansive type. Well may the
Philadelphia Record says that "lt
costs a staggering amount of money,
this necessary Intrusion of our army
into the World Power sphere but that,
as Mr. Kipling might eay. Is another
story." Secretary Root Just back from
an inspection of Cuba is hilarious. His
plan for dealing with the island that
this country got into great trouble to
free it from the Spaniards, Is certainly
novel and startling. It is on a part
with the Porto Rican tariff of 15 per
cent. He favors allowing, if we under
stand his plan, tne Cubans the right
of domestic, home control, Dut the
United States will take charge of all
foreign affairs that concern the people
of Cuba. The cabinet Is .happy over
this remarkable arrangement thus be
stowing liberty and then putting it ...
Irons. The Atlanta Journal says of It:
"While apparently letting go, we keep
a string to Cuba while pacifying the
Impatient Cuban with apparent self
government we retain actual control of
the military fortresses of the Island and
of all the foreign affairs of Cuba.
Mr. Root went all the way to Cuba
and about over the Island for four days
to conceive his plan and reports say
that be is being hailed as an oracle
since he outlined it to the cabinet."
We find an editorial of remarkable
finish and excellence In the New York
Evening Post headed "War as It Is."
It Is written with the skill and force
that often distinguish the best work in
that old New York daily. While we of
ten see opinions by it we disagree with
Incontinently, we often see views pre
sented in the best English with which
we are tn hearty sympathy. Here is
an extract from 'the aforesaid editorial,
and Major McKinley might read it and
the whole editorial with profit:
"If Providence had determined once
more to teach forgetful men what war
really Is, the lesson could not have
been more forcibly set than in what we
now see going on in South Africa,
China, and the Philippines. The squalid
and ignoble warfare in which the lead
ing nations of Christendom are now
engaged is enough to remove the last
gleam of romance, the last illusion, the
last bit of glamour from what is at best
a horrid necessity, what at worst Is
hell let loose on earth.- War, as our
revival of young barbarians has pic
tured it, is a sort of glorified football
match." '
" The production of gold for some years
has been large. It fell off this year be
cause of the war In the Transvaal.
Mining was interrupted and the fel
lows who rushed into the lands of the
Boers for the precious metal were "es
topped," and gold dropped some J 30,000.-
000 or more in production. It was J2S7,-
000.000 in 1898. J306.000.000 in 1899. The
guessers make it more for next year.

The Teport as to growth of cotton

quite satisfactory for this last year of

cotton mills have been chartered and
ten knitting mills. The capital invest

opment continue. In 1901 the begin
ning of the twentieth century there
ought to be not less than J5.000.000 ready

not? Charlotte with thirteen already
