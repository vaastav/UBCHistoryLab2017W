REGULAR SESSION
OF CONGRESS GETS

V MORNINa JOURNAL fePCCtAL LSAfcCO WlHtl
Washington, Dec. 2. Congress got
into full swing today with receipt of
President Wilson's annual message
and Inauguration of actual legislation
in both senate and house.
The message was read separately to
each bodv with floors and galleries
crowded. When it was concluded, both
senate and house began on the months
or work ahead.
The senate took up the Cummins
railroad bill., hoping for its passage
before the Christmas holidays. House
leaders arranged for Immediate at
tack on the annual appropriation bills
carrying almost $5,000,000,000, as sub
mitted by the departments.
The house adopted during the day
the conference report on the Kdge
bill authorizing foreign trade finane
ing corporations and the measure
now goes to the president for approval,
In the senate no formal move to
ward final disposition of the German
peace treaty was made and the presi
dent's message made brief reference
to It, with a view to a special message
later.
Congress also will receive a special
message Inter on the railroads.
Cummins Hill ltofore Striate.
The Cummins bill was before the
senate most of the day with Senator
Cummins explaining its provisions and
answering scores of questions. It will
have right of way.
The senate may act tomorrow on
the resolutions authorizing investiga
tion of the Ford-Newberry election
contest from Michigan and of charges
by Senator Watson, republican, of In
diana, that federal trade commission
employes were engaged in socialistic
propaganda. Adoption of both was
predicted. An effort to broaden the
federal trade commission inquiry to
Include investigation of many general
activities was expected.
Republican house leaders, in confer
ence today, considered the legislative
program but without final decision.
Representative Mondell, majority
leader, said appropriations must be
"held down" as much as possible, and
conferences with the legislative steer
ing committee for further discussion
of a more definite program for the
supply bill, will be held later.
Pensions Kill Has lrefprn"
The pensions bill will be the first to
reach the house, preparation being
more or less perfunctory with the to
tal it carries fixed by other laws. Next
will come the legislative bill probably
and none of tho big appropriation
measures is expected to be disposed
of before Christmas. Leaders plan to
enact an army reorganization bill and.
a measure fixing the permanent per
sonnel of the navy before providing
the funds for the services.
Chairman flood of the house appro
priations committee said today the bill
providing funds for the railroad ad
ministration to wind up its affairs,
would be considered soon. He expects
that at least $400,000,000 would bo
asked of congress.
