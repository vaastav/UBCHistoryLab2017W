Complexion of Committee
Leads to the Belief that Fi
nancial Legislation Will Be
Pressed. .
By Associated Press.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. The annual 'message of President
Roosevelt was read today In both houses of congress. Practically
no business was attempted by either body beyond listening to the
message. The reading consumed about two and a half hours in
each house.
Speaker Cannon treated the house to a surprise in announcing
the' membership of committees, which led to the conclusion on
the part of many that it was his intention to press financial leg-
islation, but those who are closa to the speaker say that bis only
purpose was to afford a depository for petitions and letters bear-
ing upon the currency question. Both the senate and house ad-
journed almost Immediately after the conclusion of. the reading of
the message. The house adjourned until Thursday, when it Is
probable It will again adjourn for the week.
Excerpts From
President Roosevelt yesterday sent
his message to congress, excerpts of
which are here given. The president
answers the criticisms that have been
showered upon him by the trusts and
their friends in the opening para
graphs of the message, which are as
follows:
No nation has. greater resources
than ours, and I think it can be
truthfully said that the citizens of no
. nation possess greater energy and in
dustrial ability. In no nation are the
fundamental business conditions
founder than hi ours at this very mo
ment ; and it is foolish, when such is
Whe case, for people to hoard money
instead of keeping it in sound banks;
for it is such hoarding that is the
immediate occasion of "money string
ency. Moreover, as a rule, the busi
ness of our people is conducted with
honesty and probity, and this applies
alike to farms and factories, to rail
roads and banks, to all our legiti
mate commercial enterprises.
In any large body of men, how
ever, there are certain to be- some
who are dishonest, and if the condi
tions are such that these men pros
per or commit their misdeeds with
Impunity, their example is a very evil
thing for the community. Where
these men are business men of great
sagacity, and of temperament both
unscrupulous and- ' reckless, and
where the- conditions are such that
they act without supervision ; or con
trol and at first without effective
check from public opinion, they de
lude many innocent people into mak
ing investments or embarking in
kinds of business that are really un
. sound. When the misdeeds of these
successfully dishonest men are dis
covered, suffering conies not only
upon them, but upon the innocent
men whom they have misled. It is
a painful awakening, whenever it oc
curs; "and, naturally, when it does
occur those who suffer are apt to -forget
that the longer it was deferred
the more painful it would be. In the
effort to punish the guilty it is both
wise and proper to endeavor so far
as possible to minimize the distress
of those who have been misled by
the guilty. Yet it isnot possible to
refrain because of such distress from
striving to put an end to the mid
deeds that are the ultimate causes of
the suffering, and, as a means to this
end, where possible to punish those
responsible for them. There may bo
honest differences jof opinion as to
many governmental policies; but
surely there can be no such differ
ences as to the need of unflinching
perseverance In the war against suc
cessful dishonesty. --j- -
With regard ' to interstate com
merce, the message says in part:
The anti-trust law should not be
"repealed; but It should be made both

ith actual conditions. It should be
so amended as to forbid only the
,kind of combination which does harm
to the general public, such amend
ment to be accompanied by, or to be
an Incident of, a' grant of supervisory
power to the government over these
- big concerns engaged in interstate
business. This should be accompan
the Message.
ied by provision for the compulsory
publication of accounts and the sub
jection of books and papers to the
inspection vof the government offic
ials. A beginning has already been
made for such supervision by the es
tablishment of the bureau of corpor
ations. . Dwelling upon the subject of cur
rency, the president quotes from his
message of a year ago, and then goes
on to say:
I again urge on the congress the
immediate attention to this matter
We need a greater elasticity in o.ur
currency; provided, of course, that
we recognize the even greater need of
a safe and secure currency. There
must always bo the most rigid exam
ination by the national authorities
Provision should be made for an
emergency currency. The emergency
issue should, of course, be made with
an effective guaranty, and upon con
ditions carefully prescribed by the
government. Such emergency issue
must be based on adequate securities
approved by the government, and
must be issued under a heavy tax.
This would permit currency being Is
sued when the demand for It was ur
gent, while securing Its retirement a3
the .demand fell off. It is worth in
vestigating to determine whether of
ficers and directors of national banks
should ever be allowed to loan to
themselves. . Trust companies should
be subject to the same supervision as
banks: legislation to this effect
should be enacted for the District of
Columbia and the territories,
Yet we must also remember that
even the wisest legilsation on the
subject can only accomplish a certain
amount. No legislation can by any
possibility guarantee the business
community against the results of
speculative folly any more than it
can guarantee an individual against
the results of his extravagance
When an individual mortgages his
house to buy an automobile he in
yites disaster; and when wealthy
men, or men who pose assuch, or
are unscrupulously or foolishly eager
to become such, indulge In. reckless
speculation- especially if it is ac
companied by dishonesty they jeo
pardize not only their own future but
the future of all their Innocent fellow-citizens,
for they expose the
whole business community to, panic
and distress
The president favors a revision of
the system of revenue legislati6n
Regarding the tariff, he says that the
country is definitely committed to the
protective system, and any attempt
to uproot it would result in disaster.
He believes that the inheritance tax
should become a part of our system
of federal taxation. In the matter of
the enforcement of the law, he says
the course of the department of jus
tlce has been to proceed against the
wealthiest manufacturer whose crime
was one of greed and cunning as
against, the agitator who incites to
brutal violence. He refrains from
discussion of injunctions as the mat
ter is soon to receive the attention o
the supreme court.

IKES
ITS FINAL
REPORT
Ol.lVKIt (ilUMI JURY DISCHAKU
Kl) FROM Kl'RTHKR
SERVICF..
( By Associated Press. )
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 3. After
having met on 100 separate days on
which 115 sessions were held and
having returned 441 Indictments, In
volving forty-seven persons, the Oli
ver grand jury made its final report
to Superior Judge Coffey this after
noon, and was discharged from fur-,
ther service by the court. In all 597
witnesses were brought before the
Oliver grand jury during the time
between its first assembling on No
vember 9, 1900, and its final ad
journment today. Most of Its work
has been concerned with indictments
against grafters and bribers connect
ed with municipal affairs, and public
utility corporations of San Francisco.
The final report is a voluminous doc
ument and says: '"We cannot even
outline the vast amount of evidence
received by us showing corruption
and vice of the lowest kind and in
volving the greatest moral turpitude
such as the participation of the form
er mayor of our city in the profits
earned by the prostitution of lowest
of fallen women."
; "These abuses which we found to
exist In the more important depart
ments of the city government," con
tinues the report, "will continue to
exist in a measure until the honest
enforcement of the laws and ordin
ances continually prevail. Unlawful
and corrupt protection given by Ihe
police to vice for benefit pecuniarily
and politically of the heads of the
.administration and many of the rank
j ind file of the department, is unhe-
lievable. If it were not for the low
' character of the witnesses examined
, and a tangled mas.', of contradictory
; testimony submitted, much of it nn
I doubtedly perjured, but In a way
I that perjury could not be legally
I proven, indictments would have been
j found for extortion and conspiracy
in forming a house of ill-fame trust
Our 'crib houses' have no equal In
the world for vlleness."
The report scores the police courts
for not imposing more heavier pen
alties in the cases of strikers arrest
..Sdx for misdemeanors during the
street car strike and that many lives
were lost in consequence. The
United Railroad company is severely
scored for its negligence and the
criminal carelessness of the men in
charge of its cars and many accidents
in which people have been killed,
crippled or maimed. The report rec
ommends many changes in the con
duct of some theaters, which are
spoken of as fire traps and a recom
mendation is made that they be
closed. The city and county hospital
should be torn down, the report says,
as it is a nest of deadly germs.

being out all night. ,
The verdict was reached on the second ballot, which was taken
just after midnight, but there was not a hint of what it was In
court until it was read by the clerk. Mrs. Bradley had spent a
sleepless night, and looked it. She was pale, and tried to appear
calm, but "the tremor on her lips, the spasmodic action of her
eye and the heaving of her bo torn showed the tumult that was
raging within. . , -, , ,
The announcement of the verdict created a commotion in court,
which the bailiff was unable to suppress and the admonition of
the Judge was powerless to prevent. Women shrieked and clap-
ped their hands and cheered. Mrs. Bradle y gave a great gasp,
started forward and then fell back in her seat, overcome with
emotion. She left the -court with her lawyers.
