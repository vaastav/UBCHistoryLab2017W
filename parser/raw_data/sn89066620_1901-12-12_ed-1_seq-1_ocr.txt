A reduction in turiff duties on

The attention of congress is

The Monroe doctrine is defined

the world's universal peace.
A greater navy is recommended
as the best guaranty against war

President Roosevelt consider

The following from the Joplin
News-Herald is worth careful
perusal. The record of Stone Is
of great interest at this time,
for, while bo may nover be sena
tor, he may help make i republi
can senator, or rather bis candi
dacy may:
"We are interested in Stone's
candidacy for tbe senate. We
can't help it We foel we should
do all in our power to keep him
in tbe race, for his candidacy is a
greater handicap to his party than
that of any of tho other men
mentioned, and whenever we can
handicap the democratic party
we feel obligated to be on hand.
Whenever Stone ' has appeared
before tbe people as a candidate
ho has been an exceedingly weak
one. When he was a candidate
for congress this County gave a
majority to the republican slate
ticket of 423, while tho republi
can candidate carried it over
Stone by a majority of 9S7. The
records show these figures.
When Stone was the candidate
for governor he ran behind Cleve
land in the state by 11,000, or to
be strictly accurate, Stono carried
the state by 26,061. while Cleve
land carried it by 40,754.
"Stone's subsequent record has
not increased his popularity. Ho
Iium been a free silvcritu of the
most radical stripo ready to fol
low the sacred ratio as far and
faithfully as was Ruth to follow
Naomi, lie has also been willing
to shove the sacred ratio in the
background, to regard it a
secondary, llo has been an im
perialist. He has been an anti
imperialist. He has posed as tho
enemy of corporations. Ho has
made a fortune in the service of
the corporatious. Ho has howled
against the lobby at Jefferson
City. He has been one of the
most obnoxious and persistent of
lobbyist who ever visited the
capital. In short William J.
Stone has carried wator on both
shoulders and would have carried
it on a third had he-been so
anatomically constructed. Ho is
scold, calculating hypocrite and
recognized as such.
"That Stone is an ingrate is
also known. When he Tan for
congress and when 'he made tbe
race for governor he was callod a
corporation candidate, for it was
said that in both instances be
owed bij nomination to Dill
Phelps. Bo that as it may, the
following story by R. C. Friend,
who was democratic manager in
this coutny tboyear that Stone ran
for congress, shows Stone s in
debtedness to Phelps. Mr. Friend
states that .the county committee
assessed Stone HOC as his share
of the campaign expenses, which
Stone refused to pay, aud at the!
last meeting of tho county com
mittee held before tho election to
arrange for printing the ballots,
the committeo decided to lea ye
Stone's name off tho ticket. Ac
cording to Friend, Phelps paid
the assessment himself, and thus
saved Stone. If Stone's friends
would like to know whother or
not he ever paid Phelps, they can
easily ascertain the facts. We
all know, however, how Stone
returned those favors received in
tbe early days of the Stone
Phelps partnership by bis ulti
matum of a year ago that Phelps
should not bo a delogate at-large
to the national couvention. Sonio
of us heard that fatuous speech
of Pbelps' when he christened
btoue the shcll-hidcr, about as
appropriate an epithet as was
ever coined. And tbogh the
squubblo was none of ours, we
watched it. with a great deal of
curosity, and we realized that it
was the ingratitude of Stoue, as
much as the power of Phelps,
which enabled the latter to Carry
the east district of Jasper county
by a unanimous vote when tbe
issue was presented, Phil pa or
Stone. .
"So wo want to keep Stone in
the race. Ilia senatorial cam
paign is of vast service to us.
llu is one of the conditions neces
sary to keep the democratic
i trouble pot boiling, aud he's
I doing it."
