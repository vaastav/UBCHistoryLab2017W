I is proper t say that THE SUN hasventured

appear in surprising variety in tho official

taken this liberty of emendation notin
in any controversial spirit but simplybecause
because we believed it important thattiie
the minds of our readers should not bedistracted

HOOSEVEWWe
We are sure that the time will comewhen
when Mr ROOSEVELT will thank us forour
our arbitrary and unconstitutional suppression
pression of those superficial features ofhis
his message which are calculated to impair
pair its usefulness by provoking levityThe
The President and the JudiciaryThose
Those portions of tho Presidents message
sage which relate to the Judicial Department
ment of the United States Governmentcontain
contain several interesting and important
tant recommendations Many of thesenro
nro eminently sound but some of hisviews
views will require modification beforethey
they can wisely bo carried into effect bytho
the enactment of legislation upon thesubjects
subjects treatedWith
With the recommendation that thoGovernment
Government should be allowed a rightof
of appeal on questions of law in criminal
inal cases we heartily concur Of courseif
i tho defendant in a criminal prosecution
j ton ha been acquitted by a jury it isimpossible
impossible to establish any system of reviewing

to put him twice in jeopardy in violationof
of Article V of tho amendments to thoConstitution
Constitution of tho United States Thereis
Constuton
is every reason however why tho Government
eminent should have the right of appealin
in criminal eases in order to secure areview
C
review of the rulings of the court adverseto
I to the prosecution upon pure questionsof
of law wherever this can bo done without
c out interfering with a verdict of acquittalSuch
Such n review for example is permittedin
in this State where the defendant in acriminal
criminal eate has demurred to the indictment
ment and the demurrer has been sustained
tamed Such a decision i in effect ajudicial
judicial declaration that the indictmentdoes
does not state facts sufficient to constitute
tute a crime and therefore that thedefendant
tedefendant
defendant cannot bo called upon to standtrial
t trial thereunder So also in this Statethe
the people may appeal from an order ofthe
the trial court arresting the judgmentafter
after n conviction In neither of thesecases
cases can the decision upon the appealresult
result In putting the defendant in jeopardy
ardy a second time that is in submitting
4 mitting his case a second time to thoconsideration
consideration of a jury Where thodemurrer
demurrer is upheld in tho trial court itprvent
prevent any trial by jury and where thotrial
trial court arrests the judgment afterconviction
conviction the only result of a decisionin
in favor of the people upon tho appealholding
holding that the judgment was erroneously
holdi tat tte judgcnt
ously arrested a matter of law is toaffirm
q affirm the correctness of tho convictionIn
of Columbia tho codeenacted
In tho District Colubia coenact
enacted by Congress for the regulationof
of procedure in tho courts already provides
vides that in all criminal prosecutionsthe
the Government shall havo the sameright
right 6f appeal as that which is given tothe
k the defendant provided that i on suchappeal
appeal it shall b found that there waserror
error in the rulings of the court duringtho
tho trial a verdict In favor of the defendant
ant shall never be set aside The President
dent wants Congress t enact a similarlaw
law applicable t criminal prosecutionsin
in the Federal courts throughout thoUnion
Union Whether the form of thq enactment
ment designed to give tho Governmentthis
r this right of appeal is a good in tho District
trict of Columbia as that which is contained
lathed in the New York Code of CriminalProcedure
Procedure may bo doubted but that thoPresidents
Presidents idea on tho subject is substantially
stantially right and should b madoEffective
Effective by appropriate legislation theremn
mn be no doubt It is only by such anAmendment
Amendment to the existing law that theGovernment
Government can be enabled t reviewin
in criminal cases such decisions in tholower
lower courts as may adjudgo acts ofCongress
i Cong bo unconstitutionalA
A cognate topic of which the President
dent treat at considerable length is thotendency
tendency in the Federal courts of appealtb
tb f et aside the judgments of tho trialfiflurta
fiflurta technicalities unconnected wl ththe
the merits of tho case under consideration
tion That such a tendency exists insome
some State jurisdictions notably inthe
the South and Southwest cannot bodenied
denied but we were not aware that Itwas
was common in th Federal appellatetribunals
tribunals President ROOSETEUT wouldcounteract
counteract it by a law wore followsNo

natter ol pleadlnc or procedure unless In thoopinion
opinion of the cur to which the application Umade
I made after an examination ot the entire cause I
hall arnrrnaUvely appear that the error complained
of has resulted In a miscarriage of JusticeIn
In Now York our Code of CriminalProcedure
Procedure contains tho following provi
ion in regard to tho judgment to bo rendered
dered upon an appealAfter
After hearing the appeal the court must givejudgment
judgment without regard to technical errors ordefects
defects or to exceptions which do not affect thosubstantial
substantial rights ot the partiesWe
We like the Now York provision betterthan
than that proposed by President ROOSEVELT
VELT and for this reason I makes thotest
test to be applied upon the appeal thoquestion
question whether tho substantial rightsof
of the defendant havo or have not beendisregarded
disregarded upon tho trial whereas thoenactment
enactment recommended by the President
dent makes the test tho question whethertho
tho error under consideration han resulted
suited in a miscarriage of justice Thislast
last i not the proper test in a criminalcase
case The question whether 1 personaccused
accused of crime has been guilty or notis
is to bo determined under our system ofjurisprudence
jurisprudence derived from Englandnot
not by a bench of judges however upright
right wise or learned but by the verdictof
of a jury of twelve men Our views onthis
this subject cannot be better expressedthan
than by quoting tho language of ChiefJudge
Judge CULLEN of tho Court of Appealsin
in his opinion in tho Patrick case whichalthough
although it was a dissent expressed theundisputed
undisputed law applicable to this subject
ject
jectBy
By the expreu terms ot the Code ot CriminalProcedure
I Procedure Section Mz we an required to giveJudgment
Judgment without regard t technical errors orexceptions
exceptions which do not affect the substantialrights
rights of the parties Personally within a shorttime
time put I have written for the affirmance of ajudgment
judgment a capital case where there was a plainlegal
legal error la the admission of testimony becauseU
I seemed clear that the Improper testimony couldhave
have had no effect on the verdict Butthere
there I a limit t the extent t which we may disregard
regard errors even In a case where wo think thatthe
the verdict I warranted by the tacts The guiltof
of a prisoner must be found by the jury not bythis
this court and be found on a trial conducted Inaccordance
accordance with the rules of law I Is an errorwhich
which I not only technical but which doe notaffect
affect the substantial rights of the defendant thatwe
we are authorized to disregardThe
The President has wisely come to thoconclusion
conclusion that it Is doubtful whether alaw
law abolishing altogether the use of injunctions
junctions in labor cases would be deemedconstitutional
constitutional by the courts and he pointsout
out that under such circumstanbes legislation
lation designed to effect that object wouldprove
prove Ineffective Furthermore ho expresses
presses the belief that it would bo wrongto
t prohibit the use of injunctions altogether
gether I is criminal ho truly saysto
to permit sympathy for criminals toweaken
weaken our hands in upholding tho lawand
and if men seek to destroy Iif9 or prop
erty by mob violence there should be noimpairment
impairment of the power of tho court
to deal with them in the most summitryand
and effective way possiblo No doubtthere
there have been several instances inwhich
which the power t grant preliminaryinjunctions
injunctions before trial has been abusedby
by some members of the Federal judiciary
a in controversies between employersand
and their workingmen and perhaps Congress
gress might wisely lay down a series ofstatutory
Jrs I
statutory rules providing when suchpreliminary
orders boand
preliminary restraining ore may
and may not be properly granted Thishowever
however is a fa as Congress couldprobably
probably go in regulating tho exerciseof
of tho Federalcourts
equity jurisdiction by Federlcurt
courts Wo think tho President is rightin
in intimating as ho does that the powerof
of the courts t grant an injunction in thofinal
final judgment in an equity case Ls outside
side tho control of CongressIn
In connection with this matter of injunctions
junctions the President has a good dealto
to say about the right of the communityto
to criticise tho official action of thojudges
judges and he asserts what is perfect
true that tho best judges have ever beenforemost
foremost in disclaiming any immunityfrom
from public criticism This portion oftho
the message seems in reality to be rathera
a defence or extenuation of the severelanguage
language used by the President himself
self at tho last session of Congress in condemning
demning a decision rendered by JudgeIIUMPXHEYS
IIUMPXHEYS of tho Southern District ofIllinois
Illinois holding that certain witnessescalled
called by the Government in a prosecution
tion under tho Interstate Commercelaws
ton
laws could not be compelled to testifyAs
As we recollect tho message on this subject
ject it characterized Judge HoiiriiUKYSsdecision
decision as calculated to make 1 mockery
ery of the law We thought then and wostUl
still think that the denunciation in whichthe
the President indulged in respect to thisruling
ruling was unduly severeThe
The President next takes up the prevalence
lence of lynching throughout the country
try which he condemns as i deservesconcluding
concluding with tho exhortation Letjustice
justice bo both sure and swift but let itbe
be justice under the law and not the wildand
and crooked savagery of a mob Thissubject
subject Is one however of State ratherthan
than Federal cognizance for Congresshas
has no power to legislate for the purposoof
of restraining lynching except in reference
enco to territory which is exclusivelyunder
under the jurisdiction of the Govermen tof
of tho United States as distinguished fromStnto
State territory The President expressestho
tho opinion that tho crime of rape shouldalways
always bo punished with death as is thocaso
case with murder and assault with intent
tent t commit rape should bo made ncapital
capital crime at least in thodiscrotlonoftho
tho court In making this recommendation
dation he ignores the tendency of recentlegislation
legislation in Congress on this very subject
ject The AttorneyGeneral should havoadvised
avis with reference t this portionof
of the message that up t 1897 the crimeof
of rape i committed on the high seasor
or upon any territory within the exclusive
sivo jurisdiction of tbo United Suiteswas
was punishable by death but that inthat
that year Congress amended tho law ontho
tho subject by providing that in all caseswhere I
I where the accused was found guilty oftho i
the crime of rape the jury might qualifytheir I
their verdict by adding thereto thowords
words withoutcapital punishment andthat
that whenever the jury should returnsuch
such qualified verdict the person convicted
victed should bo sentenced to imprisonment
ment at hard labor for life instead ofbeing
being sentenced t death The late Senator
ator HOAR of Massachusetts was largelyInstrumental
Instrumental in securing the enactment j
k
of this ameadmest which applies tooae
casoa of murder as veil on cases of rapetriable
triable in the Federal courts and itseems
seems hardly likely that Congress willagain
again Change the law on thin subjectinasmuch
inasmuch as it still remains within thopower
power of the jury t render a verdictwhich
which will result in the infliction of thodeath
to ifctol todeth
death penaltyNotwithstanding
Notwithstanding tho difficulty involved
volved in to amend thoFederal
volo any attempt t tlOFeer
Federal Constitution the President declares
dares that in his judgment the wholoquestion
question of marriage and divorce shouldbo
b relegated t the authority of thenational
national Congress Wo cannot agreewith
with him in his assertion that the changewould
would bo Rood from
b goo frm every standpointAs
As was well pointed out by Chief JudgeCULLEN
CULLEN in on address last beforetho
CL i a adrs lt year bforote
the students of the Brooklyn Law Schoola
a uniform divorce law would bo a uniformly
formly b law from the standpoint ofNow
Now York for whereas in this Stat
absolute divorce i now permittedonly
only on tho ground of infidelity undera
a uniform law such as would be enact
by Congress at least half a dozen othercauses
causes would b added What is reallyneeded
needed is not 1 general law providingwhat
what shall bo tho causes for a absolutedivorce
divorce In all parts of the country buttho
the adoption by the several States of ageneral
general rule which shall prohibit thocourts
courts of tho State from granting anydivorce
divorce except in cases where tho defendant
fendant is an actual resident of tho Statoor
or has boon served with process withintho
the territorial limits of that Stat
With tho exceptions t which we havecalled
called attention that portion of thoPresidents
Presidents message which deals wit
matters concerning the judiciary Is substantially
stantially sound and worthy of commendation

Government Ownership of MineralsTo
To TUB EDITOR OF THE BUN Sir How dimcult
cult would It be to overestimate the value to thepeople
people of the United States of the reservation Inall
all future allotments of public lands of all rlghta t
coal that may lie therein It I already a provisionof
of law In this State and probably In all the Statesthat
that deposits of gold and silver that may exist evenIn
1 lad already owned privately are the propertyof
of the State and may be worked only subject to theStates
States terms and I would be no great extension ofthis
this claim which baa always been acquiesced laU
If all minerals should be declared the property ofthe
the State In order to protect rights already vettedfuture
future assertions of ownership by the state shouldbe
be restricted t future finds on any property eitherpubllo
publlo or private To encourage prospectors t
search for Iron and coal deposit a pension might beawarded
awarded t those 1 fortunate as t discover suchdeposits
depositsThe
The assertion ef State ownership In deposits ofthe
the precious metals dates back t time Immemorialwhen
when gold and silver along were precious but awiser
wiser generation now sees that the best way to giveall
all the people of a country a fair share In the mineral
eral deposits Is to declare all mineral deposits without
out exception to be public property This Is oneHooseveltldra
