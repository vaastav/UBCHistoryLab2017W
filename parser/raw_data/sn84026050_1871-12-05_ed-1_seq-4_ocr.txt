Tub sub-committee sent to Mississippi
- and Alabama to look into the operations of
the Ku-klux in those States, find that in
Mississippi the Ku-klux are operating chief
ly against the educational system, having
burned nearly all the school houses in the
Statu and driven the teachers off. In Ala
bama the same lawless band determined to
bfeak up all the Methodist Episcopal church
societies established since the close of tho
rebellion by northern missionaries, and
have succeeded pretty effectually in accom
plishing their object. Although tho com
mittee found a bad condition of affairs in
both States, they believe the law can be
vindicated without declaring martial law.
A Curious Ineldent.
A singular instance of premonition of
4vil is related by a correspondent of the
Bangor Whig. A certain musician residing
tu that city, after playing at a ball in a
town some miles distant, last Monday
night, retired to rest as usual, but was rest
less and unable to sleep, and a sensation of
dread of something wrong took hold of his
mind. He strove to shake it off, and court
ed sleep in vain. So strong did this un
Mirtess become that he at length arose
and took the first train to Augusta, and
immediately went to his home, where he
found his wife and little son of four years
Of age both nearly suffocated from coal gas.
It was a long time before they could be
revived. Had he been absent an hour
longor they would doubtless both have
been dead.
tar A young lady, with a number of
Others who were injured by a railroad ac
cident near Boston, was carried to a hos
pital. Tho surgeon came around and said
to the fashionable miss: "Well, madam,
syhat can I do for you ? " Doctor one of
my limbs is broken." "One of your limbs?"
aid he ; " well which limb is it ?" " Oh,
I can't toll you, doctor J but it's one of my
Hubs." "One of your limbs," thundered
the doctor, out of patience : " which limb
(a It the limb you thread a needle with?"
" No, sir," she answered with a sigh : " it's
the limb I wear a garter on." The doctor
attended to her, and thon said i " Young
woman, never say limbs again in a hospital ;
for when a woman gets a fastidious as
that, the quicker the dies the bolter."

Hew tho Tammany Thieves Did It,
There is no doubt that a large proportion
of the twenty millions which wo know to
have been stolen have been used in the
corruption of electors, and the payment of
managers of both parties all over the State.
We are only saying what all " the men in
side politics" know well, that there has for
the last few years been hardly a town or
county caucus, lietween this city and the
lakes, in which Tweed's hand has not been
felt. Ho has his agents everywhere some
stationary, some intinorant and they are
as numerous in the Republican as the Dem
ocratic ranks. To some he pays salaries,
to others he makes donations, and others
he holds by " taking care" of a son or
other relative or friend, in the city. In
this way he has influenced largely the re
turn of the members of the Legislature.
Under his manipulations, a considerable
number go to Albany ready to be seduced.
The virtue of the others does not stand very
long after he has arrived with his money
bags, and their return to their consti
tuents enriched, no longer excites shame on
the one side or indignation on tho other.
We believe it was the experience of the re
form Democrats at tho late convention at
Rochester that the country delegates wero
little if any superior in tone to the band of
jail birds which Tammany sent up from
the city. As regards tho ' Republicans, wo
shall only say that Tweed has a book in
which he has entered tho sums paid last
winter to the various Republican legislators
for their votes, nnd that it is expected and
believed that, if he flnds'that the game is
really up as far as he is concerned, he will
publish it. Let us hope and pray he will.
It will be tho most striking "literary
event" of the season. One entry in it at
least has been already revealed by him with
liis usual cynism, , and has been used
against a prominent politician in the west
ern part of tho State during tho lato can
vass. From tit Nation.
Turning the Tables.
The Madison (Wis.) Journal of the 15th
tilt., thus recounts how a tormentor be
came the tormented :
On Wednesday morning a boy ton years
old succeeded by strategy in getting four or
five live rats into a small upper room in
Falk's brewery on the south sido from the
apartments used for drying barley. He
closed tho door on them and unsuspecting
ly went at them with a stick, when they
turned upon him with the ferocity for which
this venn in is noted under such circum
stances. They made repeated leaps up
into his face with a rapidity and savage-
ness which he dcscritx? as terrible, nipping
him on tho cheeks and about the neck. For
a time he succeeded in pushing them away
from his shoulders, and many times they
bit his hands and fastened their teeth
through his trowsers into his legs. They
kept him so busily on the defensive as to
prevent him from seeking tho door, and
would have soon overpowered him with
their fierce, persistant warfare, had not
his shrieks for help brought the workmen
to his assistance, who found him badly
lacerated in many places ; he fainted from
fright on being rescued. Tho rats all
cleared the room tho instant the door was
opened.
The Colorado Marron linage Railroad.
The facts intimately connected with this
road are that it is 70 miles long, and will
soon be in regular running condition. It
is a three feet guage. The actual cost was
$12,1500, per mile. There were 85 miles of
rails laid in five weeks ; the rails weighing
80 lbs. per y Rid, against ISO on the Denver
& Pacific. The weight of a train complete,
carrying 200 passengers, is but 70 tons,
against MflJ tons for a broad guage train
carrying 213 passcngors. Each car weighs
but eight tons, against 20 tons on the old
system. The freight ears, weighing 4,000
lbs. will carry 10,000 lbs. weight, and
though tho engine and tender weigh but
15 tons they took the excursiou train along
25 miles an hour easily. The reduction of
running expenses, that is, after all the
great argument for the narrow guage
makes two-thirds of the whole weight trans
ported pay, whereas on the broad guage
system four-fifths are dead, unremuneratlve
and taken at a perceptible loss.
Thrilling Scene In a Catholic Church.
On Thursday morning last, during tho 0
o'clock service at the church of St. John
the Evangelist, in Now York, a scene took
place that struck terror into the heart of
every mother present. Father M'Mahon,
whilo earnestly addressing his congrega
tion, was interrupted by one of his assist
ants handing him a note. On perusing it
ho remarked: " If there is a lady present
by tho name of Curtis, sho will ploaso fol
low mo at once to the clergy-room, adding
'that something had occurred at her homo
Bince she left it one hour ago," There was
a general stir throughout the assembly, and
presently a lady arose and made her way
toward tho front of tho church, tho priest
following her out. Ho shortly returned,
however, saying the lady who had respond
ed to the summons was tho wrong person.
It was some other Mrs. Curtis whose atten
tion he desired to attract; but as no one
moved ho continued, that the child of the
woman whoso attention ho desired to at
tract had been burned to death since sho
left it that morning. An exclamation and
a woman's shriek of agony succeeded tho
announcement, aud the poor mother was
led through tho crowd. A nameless fear
had kept her from obeying the first sum
mons. A Nice Income.
Ono of the best paying ofllces in tho Uni-
setl States is the position of Sheriff of New
York City. A N. Y. paper in speaking of
the emoluments of the Sheriff aud his em
ployees makes the following assertions:
The Sheriff, in the year ending Juno 30th,
received f 79,810,10. For commitments ho
received during January, 1 0,774; February,
(0,773.50; March, $3,270.95; April, 1:1,21)7,
21); May, $0,843; June, $0,010; Julyr$0,077.
!)0; and at tho same time for services during
the quarter onding March, 81, $10,823.51;
and during tho quarter ending July 1, $19,-
705.00.
Tho satisfact ion of belonging to the Sher
iff's oflico even in a subordinate position
can be estimated when it is understood that
Judson Jarvis, Brennan's man Friday, was
allowed $1,500 by tho Board of Supervisors
for removing a prisoner from New York to
Owego. Correspondingly rich pickings are
allowed to all tho hirelings of this oppres
sive chief. There is scarcely a lawyer in
the city who could not tell instances of ex
tortion by tho employees of the Sheriff.
Two Husbands.
Twenty years ago John Carter and Mary
Johnson were married in Philadelphia.
John was a sailor not unfrequently shipped
for voyages to India and Japan. But in
in the spring of '01 Mary aud her children
were left without a protector.
In the beginning of the year John had
engaged on board the clipper Columbia for
Calcutta, and tho vessel was wrecked off
one of tho Islands of the East Indian archi
pelago and all her crew wore supposed to
have perished. After the lapse of years the
comely widow married Oeorge Wilson, and
after their manage they went to New York
and took rooms at 250 East Twenty-sixth
street. A month ago the first husband
turned up. Mary is in a quandary.
tW Among the effects of a poor fellow
named William Green, who died at St.
Louis hospital, lately, was found a policy
on his life, in favor of his sister, Johanna
Green, for, $1,000. The woman has been
found in great poverty, out of which the
gift of her dead brother will lift her to com
parative comfort. This man, dying poor
and friendless, among strangers, nn object
of public charity, in his denth blesses his
sister witli the fruits of his loving fore
thought years before.
We do not know whether tho policy was
in the Continental of New York, or net,
but very probably it was, as they pay their
losses promptly. The gondii agent for
this State, is J. F. Eaton, College Block
Harrisburg.
t3PA gentleman of Bethel, Vermont,
has made a discovery in tanning leather
which, he claims, will revolutionize the
business. The material he uses is dry
forest leaves, and his experiments are said
to have been entirely satisfactory. One ton
of loaves will tan as much leather as five
cords of hemlock bark, aud will do the
work in one-half the time By mixing tho
leaves and bark in equal proportions, one
fourth of the time is saved. Tho leather
tannod by this process is smoother, more
flexible, aud yet retains the strength of the
raw hide in a greater degree than that
tanned by bark. Specimens exhibited at
tho Vermont State Fair were awarded the
first premium, after being subjected to the
severest tests.

The Aldine"" for 1872.
Much curiosity has been nrousod to see
this new " Champion of American Art,"
and tho publishers to gain a fruitful har
vest by a timely gratilication of this very
natural feeling, have brought out tho initial
issue a month before the usual time.
The verdict, wliioh tliey havo so long been
anxiously working for, must be favorable.
The fulfillment is certainly up to the prom
ise which is saying a great deal.
Perhaps tho first feature to attract the
attention of old acquaintances is the change
from green to buff in tho color of the cover
hardly an improvement except so fur as
to prepare for the greater changes Inside.
On investigation we find that thu almost
extravagant excellence of last year's paper
has leen improved upon, the paper ot tins
number being nearly one hall Heavier,
The surface ulso seems better adapted to
the rendering of those lino tints and deli
cate grays which the printers of "The
Aldine" know how to render so exquisitely.
We also find that the advertisements
have been restricted to tho wrapper, and an
additional sheet inserted, giving seven more
pages to the paper space well improved
under the judicious care of the new poct-
euitor.
' As a first number the one now before us
sneaks well for the management of Mr,
Stoddard, who will well merit all that has
been conceded since tho announcement of
his assumption of the editorship.
Of the new American feature it is not
too much to say, that tho beginning is ull
that could be wished by the moHt enthusias
tic noting. Tho illustration on tho first
page, "Maud Midler," is one of sho hap
piest instances that has ever come to' our
notice of the power ot the pencil to rem
force the pen. The perfect harmony of
ideas between the quoted lines ot Whit-
tier s best production nnd the delicate,
graceful figure of Miss Davis' delineation
will bo grateful indeed to nil lovers of that
poetry which is not confined to words.
f or tho artist, who wo understand is
young lady of about twenty, wo predict an
enviable success in the path she has cho
sena path unvexed by questions of wo
man's rights. The full page picture from
a design by Darley, "Tho Nooning," Is in
itself a prize: Henry Linton, the engraver,
has produced, in relief, all the delicacy of
flue steel engravings, and tho picture is
wonderfully suggestivo ot the American
Bank Note Company, for whose vignettes
tho very best work ot tins artist lias been
produced.
"A Tropic Forest." bv Granville Perkins.
engraved by Weights, is a grand grouping
ot the characteristics ot boutli American
forest scenery, and tho rich verdure of trop
ical vegetation is given by both artist and
engraver in a stylo that few would believo
could 1)0 produced outside of Paris. Mr,
Perkins has all the strength of Pore in this
particular Held, and lias the merit ot being
much moro natural; tlie pago is certainly a
vindication of our homo talent, and must
be accepted as Inch art in any country.
Two views of Venice the frontispiece,
"A Venetian Festival," in all the rich glow
of firelight happily suirgohted by tho very
warm tint selected, and the dark melan
choly " Bridge of Sighs, with not a living
thing in sight aro remarkable lor the
strong contrast, marking two very distinct
aspects ot Venetian history.
The other pictures nro very good, and
wo do not hesitate to pronounoo this " new
departure" a decided success from the start
an artistic gain for tho periodical and a
triumph of American taste and enterprise.

every public spirited citizen, and we nope
