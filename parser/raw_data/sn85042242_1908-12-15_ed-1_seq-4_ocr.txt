This feature is expected to prove
very good object lesson, to the set­
tlers, who it is hoped, will in turn
ant windbreaks around their farms,
I "The forest is very open and for
:the most part contains a scattering
standi of western yellow pine timber.
%:ty4lang the creek bed fs found ash
'v,,'5i/-,box elder, cottonwood, elm and birch,
Cedar breaks are also found on pre
^^,|cipitous slopes bordering the streams
J&I Western yellow pine is the only mer
f|ehantable species, however, on the
•a forest and the average stand per acre
Is not over 2,000 feet. The repro­
duction of pine is fairly good wher­
ever mature trees occur, but owing to
tlte open condition of the forest and
the dense growth of grass it is for
the most part unsatisfactory.^!^*
There is but little timber that will
be sold from the forest at the pres
eat time since this area is very isolat
^ged, being surrounded on all sides by
vast plains. Many homesteaders 'hjave
fa the past come to this forest for
timber for logs to build their houses.
Since the completion of the St. Paul
R. R., Billings county is being rapid
gfSpalT settled and while stock grazing is
¥M at the present time the most import
rat Industry it is very probable that
farming will become the most im
rigrcportant Industry within the next few
P]'«years. It is very important, tiwere
^0fore, that the timber which now re^
§f|§|f mains should be conserved exclusive-'
for the use of the home builder.
At tie present time there are but
seven homesteaders within the boun
^,||^daries of the forest, but all of the
||.t| odd sections are alienated land, be
f&'ing owned by the Western Land Se
curities company. This company has
been .seilin portions of their holdings
daring the past few years. Very lit­
tle of the government land within
the boundaries of the forest is suit­
able for farming purposes, since it
:1» quite rough and broken and wa­
ter is very scarce. It is the country
outside of the forest which is now be­
ing taken up by settlers.
No sawmill operations have ever
been conducted on this area. When
the Northern Pacific railroad was
being built a large number of trees
were cut for railroad ties and al­
together with the logs whoch have
been procured for house building by
settlers this is the only use which
been made of the timber on the for
wtfc. It is understood that the logs

Roosevelt's cabin, which now stands

NEW FOREST RESERVE.
i. The setting apart of a toSreet re-'
serve in North Dakota is perhaps
more important than is generally ap­
preciated. North Dakota is a com­
paratively treeless state, and the gov­
ernment in addition'to reserving a
tract where forestry may toe practic­
ed, encourages the forestation of oth­
er areas over the state. A Washing­
ton correspondent of the Herald at
iGrand Forks, in speafcing of the new
s^reserve in this state, says:
"The new Dakota National Forest
||iconBists of 14,080 acres in the Bad
^|Lands region. It is located in Bii
.../^lings county and lies an equal dis
^I'^tance between tae Northern Pacific
l%railroad on the north? and the Chi­
cago, Milwaukee and St. Paul on the
south. It means that an experiment­
al field for forest planting has been
secured in North. Dakota, the least
forested state in the union, having
only one per cent of tree growth.
j^The forest service expects to estab
£q11sh forest nurseries with the hope
that in time to come the area may
be reforested by artificial means.

region where the forest is created.
Both of the new national forests,
the Ocala in Florida and the Dako­
ta, will be put .under administration

sible."

According to the editor of the
Northwestern Miller published at
Minneapolis, the millers of that sec­
tion will not abide the decision of
Secretary Wilson with respect to
bleachjed flour without testing in the
courts the legality of the order and
the authority of the secretary fin­
ally to pass upon the matter. It is
claimed, with respect to the process
of bleaching, that it is harmless, and
that the orper of the secretary is arb­
itrary and unwise. As to the whole
matter, it would seem that there
ought to be no great difficulty in ar­
riving at a just conclusion. The mil­
ling industry is one of prime import­
ance to the northwest, and it seems
hardly probable that an arbitrary or­
der would be entered' with a view
to embarrassing the millers, if such
an order could nqt be sustained by
reason, good judgment aWr consider­
ations of health. On the other hand
if millers are agreed! as to the Value
of the process, it would seem only
fair that they should have a day in
court to establish their claims. Sure­
ly the millers do not desire to con­
tinue a process that makes a harm­
ful product, and on the other 'hjand
there could be no desire to cripple
them in the carrying on of their law­
ful business.

The state bar association will meet
on December 28 to prepare recom
mendations for the appointment of
the two additional judges of the su­
preme court to be submitted to the
governor. Already there is a large
list of candidate for these import?
ant positions, and the number of
eligibles will be larger after the bar
association meeting. It is not likely
that the association will Indorse any
two candidates as preferable to any
other, but a list will, probably, be
submitted of attorneys deemed by the
association to be of supreme-judicial
calibre. No appointments will, prob­
ably, be made until after the recom­
mendations of the bar association are
received, although it has been held
that the appointments can be made
at any time now that the result of
the vote on the constitutional amend­
ment has been officially declared. It
is settled, however, that the nftxt
regular term of the supreme court,
which will be the one held in Janu­
ary, having been adjourned from the
September term, will see five judges
of the court sitting in the hearing of
cases.
Irrespective of any other consid­
eration but that of friendly sympathy
the people of the state will ergret
to learn of Senator Hansbrough's
serious condition, necessitating an
operation recently performed at Min­
neapolis. The senator has been in
poor health for a year or so, and hiB
condition was not improved by the
necessities of a strenuous primary
campaign lasting for a number of
months. ,.He underwent a mastoid
operation while In Washington in the
course of the last session of congress
and an aggravation of the trouble
from which he Suffered then has
made a second operation necessary.
The operation is at best dangerous
and exhausting and in the senator's
physical condition is more to be fear­
ed. It is to be hoped that he may
continue to improve and that rest
from his legislative activities may
restore him to complete health'

This attack was followed up by firing
on the police by both men and wo­

ting four bullets into an officer, who
permitted 'himself to be killed rather
than fire on a woman.
One of the Jittle girls, Lola Pratt,

it is positive that. 1916 play will en­

perennial popularity 4s due entirely tS
tihe equisite art, delicate feeling and
irresistable humor wltih which the

there is tenderness and love and all

affection which an audience is capable
