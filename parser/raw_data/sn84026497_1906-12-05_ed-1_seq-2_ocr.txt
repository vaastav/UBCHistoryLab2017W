T. D. COLLINS, Pbesiuisnt.
;e
President Roosevelt in his annual
messngo again urges the enactment of
a law prohibiting corporations from
contributing to campaign funds. lie
also urges the passage of the measure
conferring upon tlio1 government the
right of appeal In criminal cases on
questions of law. Continuing, the
president says:
I cannot too strongly urge the pas
sage of the bill In question. A failure
to pass it will result in seriously ham
pering the government In Its effort to
obtain Justice, especially against
wealthy Individuals or corporations
who do wrong, ud may also prevent
the government from obtaining Justice
for wage workers who are not them-
selves able effectively to contest a case
where the Judgiiieut of an inferior
court has been against them. I have
specifically In view a recent decision
by a district Judgo leaving railway
employees without remedy for viola
tion of a certain so called labor statute.
The Importance of enacting Into law
the particular bill In question Is fur
ther Increased by the fact that the gov
ernment has now definitely begun a
policy of resorting to the criminal law
In those trust and Interstate commerce
cases where such a course offers a rea
sonable chance of success.
Proper Vse of Injunctions.
In my last message I suggested the
enactment of a law in connection with
the Issuance of Injunctions, attention
having been sharply drawn to the mat
ter by the demand that the right of ap
plying Injunctions iu lubor cases
should be wholly abolished. It Is at
least doubtful whether a law abolish
lug altogether the use of Injunctions
In such cases would stand the test of
the courts, In which case, of course, the
legislation would be Ineffective. More
over, I believe It would be wrong alto
gether to prohibit the use of Injunc
tions. It Is criminal to permit sym
pathy for criminals to weaken our
hands In upholding the law, and if
men seek to destroy life or property
by mob violence there should be no Im
pairment of the power of the courts to
deal with them In the most summary
and effective way possible. But so
far as possible the abuse of the power
should be provided against by some
such law as I advocated last jear.
' Against Lynching.
I call your attention and the atten
tion of the nation to the prevalence of
crime among us and, above all, to the
epidemic' of lyuchlng and mob violence
that springs up now In one part of our
country, now In another. Each sec
tion, north, south, enst or west, has
IfV own faults. fo section can with
wisdom speud Its time Jeering at the
faults of another section. It should be
busy trying to amend Its own short
comings. To deal with the crime of
corruption It is necessary to have an
awakened public conscience and to
supplement this by whntever legisla
tion will add speed and certulnty in
the execution of the luw. When we
deal with lynching even more Is neces
sary. A great mauy white men are
lynched, but the crime Is peculiarly
frequent In respect to black men. The
greatest existing cause of lynching Is
the perpetration, especially by black
men, of the hideous crime of rape, the
most abominable In all the category
of crimes, even worse than murder.
Lawlessness grows by what it feeds
upon, and when mobs begin to lynch
for rape they speedily extend the
sphere of their operations and lynch
for mnny other kinds of crimes, so that
two-thirds of the lynchlngs are not
for rape- at all, while a considerable
proportion of the Individuals lynched
are Innocent of all crime.
There Is but one safe rule In dealing
with black men as with white men.
It Is the same rule that must be ap
plied In dealing with rich men and
poor men that is, to treat each man,
whatever his color, his creed or bis so
cial position, with even handed Justice
on his real worth ns a man. white
people owe It quite ns much to them
selves as to the colored race to treat
well the colored man who shows by
his life that he deserves such treatment
There is ho question of social equality
or negro domination Involved '
In my Judgment, the crime of rape
should always be punished with death,
as la the case with murder. Assault
with Intent to commit rape should be
made a capital crime, at least in the
discretion of the court, and provision
should be made by which the punish
ment may follow Immediately upon
the heels of the offense. ,
No more shortsighted policy can be
imagined than in the fancied interest
of one class to prevent the education
of another class. The white man, If
he is wise, will decline to allow the
negroes In a mass to grow to man
hood and womanhood without educa
tion.
"Preachers of Mere Discontent."
In dealing with both labor and cap
ital, with the questions affecting both
corporations and trades unions, there
Is one matter more Important to re
member than aught else, and that Is
the Infinite harm done by preachers of
mere discontent. These are the men
who seek to excite a violent class ha
tred against all men of wealth. They
seek to turn wise and proper move
ments for the better control of corpora
tions and for doing away with the
ouses connected with wealth into n
campaign of hysterical excitement nnd
falsehood in which the aim Is to in
flame 'to madness the brutal passions
of mankind. The sinister demagogues
and foolish visionaries who are always
eager to undertake such a campaign
of destruction sometimes seek to as
sociate themselves with those working
for a genuine reform In governmental
and social methods and sometimes mas-
quciadj as such reformers. In reality -
PRESIDENT j MESSAG
they are the worst enemies of the
cause they profess to advocate. Just as
the purveyors of sensational slander In
newspaper or magazine are the worst
enemies of all men who arc engaged In
an honest effort to better what Is bad
In our social and governmental condi
tions.
Corruption Is never so rife as In com
munities whero the demagogue and the
agitator bear full away, because In
such communities all moral bands be
come loosened, and hysteria and sensa
tionalism replace the spirit of sound
Judgment and fair dealing as between
man nnd man. In sheer revolt against
the squalid anarchy thus produced men
are sure In the end to turn toward any
leader who can restore order, and then
their relief at being free from the In
tolerable burdens of class hatred, vio
lence and demagogy Is such that they
cannot for some time be aroused to In
dignation against misdeeds by men of
wealth, so that they permit a new
growth of the very abuses which were
In part responsible for the original out-
break. The one hope for success for
our people lies In a resolute and fear
less but sane and cool bended advance
along the path marked out last year
by this very congress. There must be
a stern refusal to be misled Into fol
lowing either that base creature who
appeals and panders to the lowest In
stincts and passions In order to arouse
one set of Americans against their fel
lows or that other creature, equally
base, but no baser, who In a spirit of
greed or to accumulate or add to au
already huge fortune seeks to exploit
his fellow Americans with callous dis
regard to their welfare of soul and
body. The man who debauches others
In order to obtain a high office stands
on an evil equality of corruption with
the man who debauches others for
financial profit, and when hatred Is
sown the crop -which springs rip can
only be evil.
The plain people who think the me
chanics, fanners, merchants, workers
with head or hand, the men to whom
American traditions are dear, who love
their country and try to act decently
by their neighbors owe It to them
selves to retnemlwr that the most dam
nglng blow that can be glveti popular
government is to elect an unworthy
and sinister agitator on a platform of
violence and hypocrisy.
Railroad Employees' Hours.
I call your attention to the need of
passing the bill limiting the number of
hours of employment of railroad em
ployees. The measure Is a very moder
ate one, nnd I can conceive of no seri
ous objection to It. Indeed, so far as
it is In our power. It should be our aim
steadily to reduce the number of hours
of labor, with ns a goal the general in
troduction of au eight hour day. There
are industries In which It Is not pos
sible that the hours of labor should
be reduced, Just as there are communi
ties not far enough advanced for such
a movement to be for their good, or, If
in the tropics, so situated that there Is
no analogy between their needs and
outs In this matter. On the Isthmus
of Panama, for Instance, the condi
tions are In every way so different
from what they are here that an eight
hour day would be absurd, Just as It
Is absurd, so far as the Isthmus Is con
cerned, where white labor cannot be
employed, to bother ns to' whether the
necessary work Is done by alien black
men or by alien yellow men. But the
wageworkers of the United States are
of so high' a grade that alike from the
merely Industrial standpoint and from
the civic standpoint It should be our
object to do wbnt we can In the direc
tion of securing the general observance
of an eight hour day.
Let me again urge that the congress
provide for n thorough Investigation
of the conditions of child labor and of
the labor of women In the United
States. The horrors Incident to the
employment of young children In fac
tories or at work anywhere are a blot
on our civilization.
In spite of all precautions exercised
by employers there aro unavoidable ac
cidents and even deaths Involved in
nearly every line of business connect
ed with the mechanic arts. It is a
great social Injustice to compel the em
ployee, or, rather, the family of the
killed or disabled victim, to bear the
entire burden of such an Inevitable
sacrifice. In other words, society shirks
its duty by laying the whole cost on
the victim, whe'ens the Injury comes
from what m be jailed the legiti
mate risks of the trade. Compensation
for accidents or deaths duo In any line
of Industry to the actual conditions un
der which that Industry Is carried on
should be paid by that portion of the
community for the benefit of which
the industry Is carried on that Is, by
thoso who profit by the Industry. If
the entire trndo risk is placed upon the
employer, he will promptly and prop
erly add It to the legitimate cost of pro
duction nnd assess It proportionately
upon the consumers of his commodity.
It Is thereforo clear to my mind that
the law should place this entire "risk
of a trade" upon the employer.
Capital and Labor Disputes.
Records show that during the twen
ty years from Jan. 1. 1881, to Dec. 31,
1900, there were strikes affecting 117,
D00 establishments, and 0.105.G04 em
ployees were thrown out of employ
ment. During the same period there
were 1,003 lockouts, Involving nearly
10,000 establishments, throwing over
1,000,000 people out of employment.
These strikes and lockouts Involved an
estimated loss to employees of $307,
000,000 and to emplojers of $113,000,
000, a total of $ lo0.000.000. The public
suffered directly nnd Indirectly prob
ably as great additional loss.
Mnny of these strikes and lockouts
would not have occurred had the par
ties to the dispute been required to
appear before an miprcjudiced body
representing the nation and. face to
face, state the reasons tor their con
tention. The exercise of a Judicial
spirit by a disinterested body repre
senting tho federal government, suet
as would be provided by a commission
on conciliation nnd arbitration, would
tend to create an atmosphere of friend
liness and conciliation between con
tending parties.
Control of Corporations.
It cannot too often be repeated thai
experience has conclusively shown the
Impossibility of securing by the actions
of nearly half a hundred different state
legislatures anything but Ineffective
chaos In the way of dealing with th
great corporations which do not oper
ate exclusively within the limits ol
any one state. In some method, wheth
er by a national license law or In othei
fashion, we must exercise, and that al
an early date, a far more complete
control than at present over these greal
corporations a control that will, among
other things, prevent the evils of ex
cessive overcapitalization and that wlli
compel the disclosure by each big cor
poratiou of Its stockholders and of Its
properties and business, whether own
ed directly or through subsidiary oi
affiliated corporations. This will tend
to put n stop to the securing of Inor
dinate profits by favored Individuals at
the expense whether of the general
public, the stockholders or the wage
workers. Oflr effost should be not se
much to prevent consolidation as such
but so to supervise and control It ns
to see that It results In no barm to the
people.
Combination of capital, like comblua
tlon of labor, Is a necessary element ol
our present Industrial system. It It
not possible completely to prevent it,
and If It were possible such complete
prevention would do damage to the
body politic. What we need is not
vainly to try to prevent all combina
tion, but to secure such rigorous and
adequate control and supervision of
the combinations as to prevent .theli
injuring the public or existing In such
form as Inevitably to threaten Injury,
for the mere fact that a combination
has secured practically complete con
trol of a necessary of life would uudei
any circumstances show that such
combination was to be presumed to be
adverse to the public interest. It is
unfortunate that our present laws
should forbid all combinations instead
of sharply discriminating between
those combinations which do good and
those combinations which do evil. Re
bates, for Instance, are as often due to
the pressure of big shippers (as was
shown in the Investigation of the
Standard Oil company and as has been
shown since by the Investigation of
the tobacej nud sugar trusts) as to the
Initiative of big railroads. Often rail
roads would like to combine for the
purpose of preventing a big shipper
from maintaining Improper advantages
at the expense of small shippers and
of the general public. Such a combina
tion, Instead of being forbidden by law,
should be favored. In other words, it
should be permitted to railroads to
make agreements, provided these agree
ments were sanctioned by the inter
state commerce commission and were
published. With these two conditions
complied with it is impossible to see
what harm such a combination could
do to the public at large.
Inheritance and Income Tax.
The national government has long
derived its chief revenue from a tariff
on imports and from an internal or ex
cise tax. Iu addition to these, there is
every reason why, when next our sys
tem of taxation Is revised, the national
government should Impose a graduated
Inheritance tax and. If possible, a grad
uated Income tax.
I am well aware that such a subject
as this needs long and careful study In
order that the people may become fa
miliar with what is proposed to be
done, may clearly see the necessity of
proceeding with wisdom and self re
straint and may make up their minds
Just how far they are willing to go In
the matter, while only trained legisla
tors can work out the project in neces
sary detail. But I feel that Iu tho nenr
future our national legislators should
enact a law providing for a graduated
inheritance tax by which a steadily In
creasing rate of duty should be put
upon all moneys or other valuables
coming by gift, bequest or devise to
any Individual or corporation. There
can be no question of the ethical pro
priety of tho government thus deter
mining the conditions upon which any
gift or Inheritance should be received.
As the law now stands it is undoubt
edly difficult to devise a national In
come tax which shall be constitutional.
But whether It Is absolutely Impossible
Is another question, and if possible It
Is most certnlnly desirable. The first
purely Income tax law was passed by
the congress In 1801, but tho most Im
portant luw dealing with the subject
was that of 1804. This the court held j
to be unconstitutional.
The question is undoubtedly very In
tricate, delicate and troublesome. The
decision of the court was only reached
by one majority. It Is tho law of the
laud nnd of course Is accepted as such
and loyally obeyed by all good citizens.
Nevertheless tho hesitation evidently
felt by tho court ns a whole In coming
to a conclusion, when considered to
gether with previous decisions on tha
subject, may perhnps Indicate the pos
sibility of devising a constitutional ln
como tnx law which shall substantially
accomplish the results aimed lit. The
difficulty of amending the constitution
Is so great that only real necessity can
Justify n resort thereto. Every effort
should be made In dealing with this
subject, as with the subject of the
proper control by the national govern
ment over the use of corporate wealth
in Interstate business, to devise legis
lation which without such action shall
attain the desired end, but If this falls
there will ultimately be no alternative
to a constitutional amendment.
Industrial Training.
Our Industrial development depends
largely upon tee ,nM education, In
cluding In this term all Industrial edu
cation, from that which fits a man to
be a good mechanic, a good carpenter
or blacksmith to that which fits a man
to do the greatest engineering feat.
Tie skilled mechanic, the skilled work
mnn, can best become such by tech
nical Industrial education. The far
reaching usefulness of Institutes of
technology and schools of mines or of
engineering Is now universally ac
knowledged, and no less far reaching
is the effect of a good building or me
chanical trndes school, a textile or
watchmaking or engraving school.
In every possible way we should help
the wageworker who tolls with his
hands nnd who must (we hope In a
constantly Increasing measure) nlso
toll with his brnln. Under the constitu
tion the nntlonal legislature can do but
little of direct Importance for his wel
fare snve where he is engaged In work
which permits It to net under the In
terstate commerce clause of the consti
tution, and this Is one reason why I
so earnestly hope that both the legis
lative nnd Judicial branches of the gov-
eminent will construe this clause of
the constitution in the broadest possi
ble manner.
The Farmer.
The only other persons whose wel
fare is as vital to the welfare of the
whole country ns Is the welfare of the
wageworkers are the tillers of the soli.
the farmers.
Several factors must co-operate In
the improvement of the farmer's con
dltlon. He must have the chance to
be educated In the widest possible
sense, In the sense which keeps ever In
view the intimate relationship between
the theory of education nnd the facts
of life.
Organization has become necessary
In the business world, and it has ac
complished much for good In the world
of labor. It is no loss necessary for
farmers. Such a movement as the
grange movement is good In Itself and
is capable of a well nigh Infinite fur
ther extension for good bo long ns it Is
kept to its own legitimate business,
The benefits to be derived by the as
sociation of farmers for mutual ad
vantage are partly economic and part
ly sociological.
Irrigation and Forest Preservation.
Much is now being done for the
states of the Rocky mountains and
great plains through the development
of the national policy of Irrigation and
forest preservation. No government
policy for the betterment of our Inter
nal conditions has been more fruitful
of good than this.
Divorce Lesrlslatlon,
I am well aware of how difficult it is
to pass a constitutional amendment.
Nevertheless, In my judgment, the
whole question of marriage and di
vorce should be relegated to the au
thority of the national congress. The
change would be good from every
standpoint. In particular It would be
good because It would confer on the
congress the power at once to deal
radically and efficiently with polygamy,
and this should be done whether or
not marriage and divorce are dealt
with. It Is neither safe nor proper to
leave the question of polygamy to be
dealt with by the several states.
Merchant Marine.
Let me once again call the attention
of the congress to two subjects con
cerning which I have frequently be
fore communicated with them. One Is
the question of 'developing American
shipping. I trust that a law embody
ing In substance the views or a major
part of the views expressed In the re
port on this subject laid before the
house at Its last session will be passed.
It seems to me that the proposed meas
ure Is as nearly unobjectionable as any
can be.
The Currency.
I especially call your nttentlon to the
second subject, tho condition of our
currency laws. The national bank act
has ably served a great purpose In aid
ing the enormous business develop
ment of the country, and within ten
years thore has been an Increase In
circulation per capita from $21.41 to
$33.08. For several years evidence has
been accumulating that additional leg
islation Is needed. The recurrence of
each crop season emphasizes the de
fects of the present laws. There must
soon be "a revision of them, because
to leave them as they are means to In
cur liability of business disaster. Since
your body adjourned there has been a
fluctuation In the Interest on cnll
money from 2 per cent to 30 per cent.
and the fluctuation was even greater
during tho preceding six months. The
secretary of the treasury hud to step
In and by wise action put a stop to the
most violent period of oscillation.
I do not press any especial plan. Va
rious plans have recently been pro
posed by expert committees of bank
ers. Among the plans which are possi
bly fensiblo and which certainly should
receive your consideration is that re
peatedly brought to your attention by
tho present secretary of tho treasury,
the essential features of which have
been approved by many prominent
bankers and business men. According
to this plan, national banks should be
permitted to Issuo a specified' propor
tion of their cnpltal In notes of a given
kind, tho Issue to be tnxed at so high
a rate as to drive tho notes back when
not wanted In legitimate trade. This
plan would not penult tho Issue of
currency to give banks additional prof
Its, but to meet the emergency present
ed by times of stringency.
I do not say that this Is the right sys
tem. I only advnuco It to emphasize
my bellt?f that there Is need for the
adoption of some system which shall
bo nutornatlc and open to all sound
banks sa ns to avoid all possibility of
discrimination nnd favoritism.
Tho law should be amended so r.s
specifically to provide that the funds
derived from customs duties may be
treated by the secretary of the treui-
ury as he treats funds obtained under
tin Internal revenue laws. There
should bo a considerable Increase in
bills of small denominations. Permis
sion should be given banks, If necessa
ry under settled restrictions, to retire
their circulation to a larger amount
than three millions a month.
Our Outlying Possessions.
I most earnestly hope that the bill to
provide a lower tariff for or else abso
lute free trade in Philippine products
will become a law. No harm will come
to any American Industry, and, while
there will be some small but real mate
rial benefit to the Filipinos, the main
benefit will come by the showing made
as to our purpose to do all In our power
for their welfare.
Forto Rican Affairs.
American citizenship should be con
ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico.
The harbor of San Junn, In Porto Rico,
should be dredged and Improved. The
expenses of the federal court of Porto
Rico should be met from the federal
treasury.
Hawaii.
The needs of Hawaii are peculiar.
Every aid should be given the Islands,
and our efforts should be unceasing to
develop them along the lines of a com
munity of small freeholders, not of
great planters with cooly tilled es
tates.
Alaska.
Alaska's needs have been partially
met, but there must be a complete re
organization of the governmental sys
tem, as I have before Indicated to you,
I nsk your especial attention to this,
Our fellow citizens who dwell on the
shores of Pugct sound with character
istic energy are arranging to hold in
Seattle the Alasku-Yukon-Paclflc ex
position. This exposition In Its pur
poses and scope Bhould appeal not only
to the people of the rneltlc slope, but
to the people of the United States at
large.
Rlsxbts of Aliens.
Not only must we treat all nations
fairly, but we must treat with Justice
and good will all Immigrants who come
here under the law. Whether they are
Catholic or Protestant, Jew or gentile,
whether they come from England or
Germany. Russia, Japan or Italy, mat
ters nothing. All we have a right to
question is the man's conduct. If he
is honest and upright In his dealings
with his neighbor and with the state,
then he is entitled to respect and good
treatment. Especially do we need to
remember our duty to the stranger
within our gates. It Is the sure mark
of a low civilization, a low morality, to
abuse or discriminate against or In any
way humiliate such stranger who has
come here lawfully nud who Is con
ducting himself properly. To remem
ber this Is incumbent on every Amer
ican citizen, and It Is of course pecul
iarly Incumbent on every government
official, whether of the nation or of
tho several states.
I am prompted to say this by the
attitude of hostility here and there as
sumed toward tho Japanese in this
country. This hostility is sporadic and
is limited to a very few places. Never
theless It Is most discreditable to us
as a people, and It may be fraught
with the gravest consequences to the
nation.
I ask fair treatment for the Japanese
as I would ask fair treatment for Ger
mans or Englishmen, Frenchmen, Rus-
slnns or Italians. I nsk It as duo to
humanity and civilization. I ask It ns
due to ourselves, because we must act
uprightly toward all men. I recom
mend to the congress that an act be
passed specifically providing for tho
naturalization of Japanese who come
here Intending to become American cit
izens. One of the great embarrass
ments attending the performance of
our international obligations Is the
fact that the statutes of the United
States are entirely inadequate. They
fail to give to the national government
sufficiently ample power, through Unit
ed States counts and by the use of tho
army and navy, to protect aliens In th
rights secured to them under solemn
trentles which are tho law of the luud.
I therefore earnestly recommend that
the criminal and civil statutes of the
United States be so amended and add
ed to as to enable the president, nctlng
for the United States government,
which Is responsible In our interna
tional relations, to enforce the rights
of aliens under treaties.
The Cuban Matter.
Last August an Insurrection broke
out In Cuba which It speedily grew evi
dent that the existing Cuban govern
ment .was powerless to quell. Thanks
to tho preparedness of our navy, I
was able Immediately to send enough
ships to Cuba to prevent the sltuutlon
from becoming hopeless, and I fur
thermore dispatched to Cuba tho sec
retary of war aud tho assistant secre
tary of state In order that they might
gropplo with the situation on tho
ground.
Iu accordance with the so called
riatt ninendment, which was embod
ied in the constitution of Cuba, I there
upon proclaimed n provisional govern
ment for tho Island, the secretary of
war acting ns provisional governor un
til he could be replaced by Mr. Ma goon,
the late minister to I'aunmn and gov
ernor of the canal zone on the Isthmus.
Troops were sent to support them aud
to relieve the navy, the expedition be
ing handled with most satisfactory
Rpeed and chVleney. Pence has come
In the Island, and the harvesting of the
sugar cane crop, the great crop of tho
Island, Is about to proceed. When the
election has been held and the new
government Inaugurated In peaceful
nnd orderly fashion the provisional
government will come to au end.
The United States wishes nothing of
Cnba except that It shall prosper mor
ally and materially nud wishes nothing
of tho Cubans save that they shall be
able to preserve order among them- ,
selves and therefore to preserve their
Independence. If the elections become
a farce nnd if tho insurrectionary habit
becomes confirmed on the island it Is
absolutely out of the question that the
island should continue Independent,
and the United States, which has as
sumed the sponsorship before the civ
ilized world for Cuba's career as a na
tion, would again have to intervene
and to see that the government was
managed in such orderly fashion as to
secure the safety of life and property.
The Rio Conference.
The second International conference
of American republics, held In Mexi
co In the years 1901-02, provided for
the holding of the third conference
within five years and committed the
fixing of the time and pluce and the
arrangements for the conference to the
governing board of the bureau of
American republics, composed of the
representatives of all the American
nations In Washington. That board
discharged the duty Imposed upon
It with marked fidelity and pains
taking care, and . upon the courteous
Invitation of the United States of Bra
zil the conference was held at Rio de
Janeiro, continuing, from the 23d of
July to the 20th of August last. Many
subjects of common Interest to all the
American nations were discussed by
the conference, nnd the conclusions
reached, embodied In a scries of reso
lutions and proposed conventions, will
be laid before you upon the coming of
the final report of the American dele
gates. Panama Trip.
I have Just returned from a trip to
Panama and shall report to yon at
length Inter on the whole subject of the
Panama canal.
The Alo-eclras Convention.
The Algeclrns convention, which was
signed by the United States as well as .'
by most of tho powers of Europe, su
persedes the previous convention of
1SS0, which was also signed both by
the United States aud a majority of
tho European powers. This treaty
confers upon us equal commercial
rights with nil Europonn countries and
does not entnll a single obligation of
nny kind upon us, and I earnestly hope
It may be speedily ratified.
Sealing.
The destruction of the Pribllof is
land fur seals by pelagic sealing still
continues. The herd, which, according
to the surve y made In 1874 by direc
tion of the congress, numbered 4,700,
000, nnd which, according to the sur
vey of both American and Canadian
commissioners In 1891, nmounted to
1,000,000, has now been reduced to
about 180.000. This result has been
brought about by Canadian and some
other sealing vessels killing the female
seals while In the water during tbelr
annual pilgrimage to and from the
south or In search of food.
The process of destruction has been
accelerated during recent years by the
appearance of a number of Japanese
vessels engaged In pelagic scaling.
Suitable representations regarding
the Incident have been made to the
government of Japan, and we are as
sured that all practicable measures will
be taken by that country to prevent
any recurrence of the outrage.
We have not relaxed our efforts to
secure an agreement with Great Brit
ain for adequate protection of the Beat
herd, and negotiations with Japan for
the same purpose are In progress.
The laws for the protection of the
seals within tho jurisdiction of the
United States need revision and
amendment. ,
Second Ilairne Conference.
In my last message I advised you
that the emperor of Russia had taken .
the Initiative In bringing about a sec
ond peace conference at The Hague.
Umlor tho guidance of Russia the ar
rangement of the preliminaries for
Riich a conference has been progressing
during tho past year. Progress has
necessarily been slow, owing to tho
great number of countries to be con
sulted upon every question that has
arisen. It Is a mutter of satisfaction
that all of the American republics have
now, for the first time, been Invited to
join In the proposed conference.
Army and Navy.
It must ever be kept In mind that
war 13 not merely justifiable, but Im
perative upon honorable men, upon an
honorable nation, where peace can
only be obtained by the Bucrlflce of
conscientious conviction or of national
welfare.
Tho United States navy Is the surest
guarantor of pence which this country
possesses. I do not ask that we con
tiuuo to Increase our navy. I ask
merely that it be maintained at Its
present strength, and this car, be done
ouly If we replace tho obsolete aud out
worn ships by new and good ones, the
equals of any afloat In any navy. To
Hop building ships for one year means
that for that year the navy goes back
Instead of forward.
In both tho army and tho navy there-
Is urgent need that everything possible
should be done to maintain the hlgheat
standard for the personnel alike as re
gards tho otlicers and the enlisted men.
I do not believe that In any service
there Is a finer body of enlisted men
and of Junior otlicers than we have In
both the army and the navy. Including
the murine corps.
West Point and Annapolis already
turn out excellent otlicers. We do not
need to have these schools made more
scholastic. On tho contrary, we should
never lose sight of the fact that tho
aim of each school Is to turn out a
man who shall be above everything
else a fighting man.
There should soon bo an Increase In
the number of men for our coast de
fenses. These men should be of the
Ight typo and properly trained, and
there should therefore be au luercuse
f pay for certain skilled grades, espe-
iully hi the const artillery. Money
should he appropriated to penult trooiw
to be massed In body and exercised In
maneuvers, particularly Iu marching.
