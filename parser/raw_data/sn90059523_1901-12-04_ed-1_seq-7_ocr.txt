BUSINESS CONDITIONS.
•. During"the" last five years business con
fidence has been restored,; and the nation
is to be congratulated because of its
present abounding.prosperity. Such pros-.*,
perity can never be created by law alone,
t> al though' it is easy enough- to destroy it
''by mischievous laws. If the hand of the
Lord is heavy upon any country, if flood
or drought comes, human wisdom is pow
er! ess to avert the calamity. Moreover,
no law can guard against > the conse
quences of our own folly. The; men^who
are idle or credulous,- the men who- seek
gains not by genuine work with head.or
"'- hand, but by gambling in any form, are;
- always a source of menace not only to
I themselves, but to - others. -If .the'; busi
ness; world loses its head, it loses!'what
. legislation cannot supply. Fundamental-.
ly the welfare of each citizen and there
fore the welfare of the aggregate of cit-;
. ,izens which makes the nation must rest
upon individual thrift and energy, resolu
tion and intelligence. Nothing can take
the place of this individual capacity, but
wise legislation and honest and intelli-jf nt
administration can " give it the fullest
scope, the largest opportunity to work
to good effect. A"
The tremendous and highly complex
. industrial development jj which went on
with ever accelerated rapidity during the
' latter half of the nineteenth century
. ? brings us face to face at the beginning
of the twentieth with very serious social.
'problems.. The old laws and the old cus
toms which had almost the binding force
of law were once quite sufficient to. reg
ulate the accumulation and ■ distribution ;
of wealth:.. Since the industrial - changes
which have so enormously Increased the
frr'oductlve'nower. of mankind they are no
onger ; sufficient. ? : . 
:. The growth of. the cities has gone on
beyond A- comparison A faster than the
growth of ■ the country, and the upbuild
ing, of ; the great industrial centers nas
. .meant? a. startling increase not ".merely
* in I the aggregate of .wealth, but In the:
number of very large individual and es
pecially of very large corporate fortunes.
The creation of these 7 great corporate
fortunes has not been due to the tariff
nor to 'any other governmental action,
but to the natural causes in the business
world, operating in other : Countries as
: they operate in our own.. "
The process has aroused much antago
nism, a great part of which is wholly
.without warrant. It is not true that as
the rich? have grown richer, the poor have
.grown poorer. On the contrary, never be-'
fore has" the average man, the wage
worker, the I farmer, the small*- trader,
been, so well off as In this country and I
at the present time. There have been
abuses connected with the accumulation i
of wealth, yet it remains true that a for
tune* accumulated in legitimate business
can be accumulated by . the * person ' spe- j
Sdally benefited only; on condition of con
, ferring immense incidental benefits upon
" others. - Successful enterprise of the type
which benefits all mankind can only exist
' if the conditions are such; as-., to ; offer.
. great prizes as . the rewards? of 'success.:, '
.? REASONS FOR ACTION. ?.-?
The captains Of industry who have driv
en the railways systems across this conti
nent, - who have buiit up,, our -commerce,.
-who have developed our manufactures,
. have on the, whole done great good to our.
S people.-Without them the material devel
opment of which we ai*e so justly, proud,
could never have taken place. Moreover,
We should recognize the immense impor
tance to this material development bf
- leaving as unhampered as is compatible
« with the public good the "strong and
forceful men upon whom : the success
of business . operat , inevitably rests.
The slightest' study or "Business conditions
. will satisfy anyone capable of forming a
I judgment that the personal equation is
! the most important factor in a' business
I operation; that the . business % ability of
b s the man at the head of any business con-
X cern', big ' or little, is usually the factor
■• which fixes the gulf- between striking
a success - and . hopeless ; failure. "
9 An' j additional . reason for caution is
I: dealing with 'corporations is to be found
Rv In the international commercial condi
! tions of today. The same business condi
tions which have produced the great ag
gregations of -j corporate "and individual
" wealth have made them very y potent
factors in International commercial com
- petition. ' t Business concerns which have <
: the largest! means. at their' disposal and
y are managed by the ablest men are nat
-1 urally those which take the lead, In the
9 strife for commercial supremacy among
the nations of the world. America has
H only just begun, to assume that com-
B manding position In the international
 business world which we : believe will
A more and more be hers. It ls of the ut
- most importance that this, position be
j not jeoparded,? especially at a time when
the overflowing abundance of our own
natural resources and the skill, business
energy. and mechanical aptitude of our
people makO'' foreign .markets essential.
Under such conditidhs it would be most
, unwise to cramp, or to fetter the youthful
strength of; our nation.
EVILS OF OVERCAPITALIZATION.
There is a widespread conviction in the
ES minds of. the .American people that the
•- great corporations known as trusts are
.Am certain of their features and tenden-
H cies hurtful to the general welfare. This
y springs , from no spirit of envy: or un-.
V' ; charitableness nor lack of .pride in tha
»*.? great industrial achievements that have
placed this country at "the head of the
. nations : struggling for " commercial su
: premacy. It does not rest upon a lack
, of-intelligent appreciation of the neces
sity of meeting changing and* changed
• conditions of trade with new methods
: nor upon Ignorance of the fact that com-
S bination of capital -in the ; effort* to ac
complish great things is necessary when;
the world's progress demands that great
things be done. It is based upon sincere
conviction that combination and concen
tration should be not. prohibited, but
supervised and within reasonable limits
controlled, and' in my judgment -this
conviction is right. * :??*' -'
It is no limitation upon property rights
or freedom of contract to require that
" When men receive from government the
privilege .of doing * business under corpo
rate form which frees them from individ
. ual responsibility? and enables them ?to
call into their ; enterprises the . capital of
the public they shall; do so upon abso
lutely truthful representations as 4to the
value of the property : in ?,which the capi
tal -Is to be invested.. Corporations engag
ed In interstate commerce should be reg
ulated if. they t are found '■ to \ exercise a ; li
cense working to the r. public ' Injury. It
should be as much the aim of those .who
- seek for social betterment; to rid the busi
ness world of crimes of cunning as to rid
the entire body politic of crimes of. vio
lence. Great: corporations exist only be
cause they . are created % and j safeguarded
by our institutions, ; and .it '■-. is * therefore
our right and our duty to see that they
; Work in harmony with. these institutions.
PUBLICITY ? NEEDED.
; The first essential* in determining how
. to deal with the great industrial combina
tions is knowledge of the facts—public
- ity. In the interest of the public the gov
-1 ernment should have 1 the right ;to i inspect
;. and examine ? the | workings lof "* the i great
- corporations engaged in. interstate *. busi
ness. -t Publicity is the ? only . sure • remedy

WOULD FRAME A. FEDERAL LAW.
.'?' When the constitution.was adopted, at
the end of the eighteenth century, no hu-.
man wisdom could foretell the sweeping
changes,? alike in Industrial;and political:
coiditlons, which were to take ; place
by. the beginning' of the twentieth -. cen
tury. - "At that :. time it was - accepted as
a matter of course that. the several states

will enable the ? national government to

CHINESE EXCLUSION.
.-With the sole exception of the farming
.interest, no one matter.is of such-vital
moment to our whole people as: the wel
fare of the wageworkers. If the farmer
and the wageworker are well off, it is ab
solutely certain that all others will be
well off too. It is therefore a matter for.
hearty congratulation. that ,on the whole
wages are - higher today - in- the- United
States - than ever.:before'--- in - our history
and far higher than in any other country. 7
.The standard of living is also higher than
ever before. Every', effort* of legislator
"and administrator, shouldibe bent to se
cure the permanency' of * this condition of
things and its Improvement-i wherever
possible. Not only must our labor be
protected by the tariff, but it should also
be protected so far as, it is possible -from
the presence -m this country of any labor-
- ers brought over by contract or of those
who, coming "-- freely,"' yet ■'.". represent a
standard, of living so depressed that -they
can undersell cur men in -the labor mar
ket and drag them to a lower* level.-T. re
gard it as necessary, 7' with -this end in
view, to re-enact immediately the law ex
cluding Chinese, laborers, and to strength
en it wherever necessary in order to make
its enforcement'entirely"effective. ,- AA

The most-vital entirely effective, this
ist vital problem with which this
country, and for that matter, the. whole
civilized world, has to deal: is the.prob
lem which has for one side the betterment
of social conditions, moral - and physical, 7
in large cities and for another side the ef
fort to deal * with,. that .7 tangle of far
reaching questions-which 'we ".'group to
gether when we speak of ."labor." 7 The
chief .factor in the-success of each-inan—
■;f factor in the success of each alike-—-.
jeworker, farmer and capitalist alike-
must ever be the sum total of his own
individual- qualities and I abilities. Second
only jto this comes .the! power of acting
in combination or association with others.

bodies: is a? duty to the nation 7 no less
than to the associations themselves.^-.'-Fi

IMMIGRATION.
Our present immigration laws are un
satisfactory. We *need every honest and
efficient Immigrant fitted to become. an
American citizen, every immigrant who
comes here to stay, who brings here a
strong body, a' stout- who brings here
:ong body, a stout heart, a good head
, and a. resolute -: purpose to do his duty
well in every ; way and ;to ■ bring Sup his
children as law abiding and God fearing
members -of the •■ community. ** But there ?
• should Cc a comprehensive law enacted;
with the object .of working a -threefold"
Improvement over our -present system.
First we should aim to exclude abso- '
: lutely .:■ not only all persons who r are
known to be . believers r in anarchistic
principles or members of anarchistic
societies, but also.all",persons who are of
a low moral tendency, or of unsavory rep
utation. This. means that we should re
quire a more : thorough : system ;of I in- s
spection abroad | and a more rigid system!
of examination at our immigration ports,
the former being especially necessary. %m
The seeond^ot^ect of a proper Immigra
tion : law- ought 'tor be to secure by - a
: careful and not merely perfunctory edu
cational - test? some intelligent'"'capacity"
to - appreciate American 'institutions and
act sanely as ;American ; citizens. " This'
would -.not : keep - cut all v anarchists, for

arid region useful by engineering,; works j
'for; water storage \ as .to make useful the
rivers and harbors 7of the humid region by

regulate the flow of istreamsg the water
should ibe turned; freely. into the channels

under the j same : laws \as - the j natural - flow. 7
The pioneer settlers -on the arid . public
domain 1 chose ? their homes ; along 3 streams
from which they could,themselves divert
the water to reclaim their holdings. Such
opportunities are practically gone. There
remain, however, ■- vast areas %of % public"
land which can be made available ;. for

tribution of ; the water," the, division of the
streams among irrigators, should. be left
' to; the ; settlers ; themselves zln conform
ity : with " state laws i and without ; Interfer

the'only available means in many; cases
: for applying this system:;-' In ; other cases,,
as where laborers are employed, a system
of registration undoubtedly can be widely
; extended. There are,; of course, ; places
-where the written competitive - examina

offers by no means an ideal solution,

THE CONSULAR SERVICE.

; attention. Several bills providing for \ a
: new consular service "-.-; have in recent
years § been •_ submitted? to ' the 7 congress. -
? They are based upon ; the; just ? principle '
that appointments to "-. the - service ■ should
be mat!e only after a practical test of the
applicant's?^fitness;; that * promotions
should ge governed by trustworthiness,

A;ln- my judgment the time has arrived
- when we should i definitely" make *up -our
minds to 7 recognize the Indian as an in-?
dividual and not . as: a member of a - tribe. ;
; The ;general allotment z act 'i is '.a mighty
'■ pulverizing engine !to break up the tribal 1
mass. . It acts- directly upon..the family
and the Individual."- Under Its!provisions
some 60,000 'Indians have already become
I citizens jof the United States.- : We should.
? now break up the tribal funds," doing for
'. them ' what allotment does for the tribal
7 lands—that ?r is, the,- should 7; be -divided^
> Into;lndividual ? holdings There -will be a,
:transition ? period during : which : the funds ,
• will in many cases -. have ;to be "held in;
1 trust. -' This is the case also "with •;. the
-lands.?- A stop should be put upon the In-?
7 discriminate < permission to„* Indians -"*_to:
; lease their allotments. The effort should
2be steadily to j make the i Indian .work like '■_
• any other man; on : his ■ own - ground. The ?
; marriage - laws of 7 the -Indians; should ; be
; made tile same as those of the whites.

; ticular ; Indian. There is :no ; use iin ; ; at

also aroused the genuine' sympathy of* the
American-people, and this sympathy was ?
cordially • reciprocated -by Germany when •'■
the president was assassinated, a Indeed? .
from : every: quarter of the civilized world ".
we received," at. the time of the president's ' r
