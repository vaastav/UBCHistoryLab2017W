A Democratic family news
per devoted to the interests of
uouniy, itiiu 11tn.11". j uu
lished every Thursday at Boone,
Watauga County, N.C.
nmsday. Dec. 11th, 1800
According to the Treas
urer's report, the National
debt decreased $100,000,000
in a year.
Mr. Harrison's message
contains more than twelve
thousand words, but not one
of them favors one cent let
ter postage.
The city of Dulnth, Minn.,
which Proctor Kuott dis
coursed so eloquently and
funny in Congress several
years ago now claims 50,
000 population.
Nash county, N. C. elects a
J. B. Phillips to the Legisla
ture. He is Jike our J. B.
Phillips, a good democrat
and will vote for Senator
Vance.
There are few men who
could write twelve thousand
words without expressing a
single original idea, but Mr.
Benjamin Harrison has ac
complished the difficult, task.
Some efforts are being
made in the House to modify
the McKinley tariff bill in
some of its most objectional
features, but it can't be chan
ged enough to do the people
or the republican party much
good this Congress.
The legislature of North
Carolina has 43 democrats
and 7 republicans in the Sen
ate, and 106 democrats and
16 republicans in the House.
There are two colored mem
bers in the Senate, and three
in the House.
The outlook for a railroad
in Ashe county seems to im
prove. We hope that Ashe
with its great mineral wealth
will be developed, and that
sooner or later a railroad
will pass through both Ashe
and Watauga. Let us work
to this end.
Senator Vorhees, who usu
ally carries a level head, says
the way to end the Indian
troubles is to issue them
enough to eat instead of the
present scanty rations.
There's something in this
idea. It might also be well
enough for them to be paid
the money the government
owes them.
The Western Citizen draws
a sword on the Alliance in
Ashe county, and other
places in general. Notwith
standing the Alliance moves
on and its sway is westward.
Bro. Citizen did youhearany
thing"drap"Jast November?
It wag the Republican party
that came down with such a
thud.J
Mr. Harrison does not for.
get to say a good word in
his message for the notori
ous ship subsidy bills which
nave passed the Senate and
are now "hung up" in the
House because they were too
rank for Representative Can
non, chairman of the House
committee on Appropria
tions. To say that a thing
is too bad to meet the appro
val of Mr. Cannon is to fur
r:.;h very Btrong argument
--.tit.'
Here's a little conundrum :
Why were the Indians allow
ed to become the owners of
Springfield riflles and an un
limited supply of amunition?
It might also be in order to
ask, who sold them to the
Indians?
There is food for thought
in the suggestion of Mr. Har
rison that pension legisla
tion should be more carefully
scrutinized, and it is also a
tacit acknowledgment of the
charges that have from time
to time been made against
Congress of being careless in
regard to this particular
class of legislation.
The State papers speak of
a move on the part ofnlliance
members of the Legislature
plotting with other opposing
elements against Vance to
secure his defeat for Senator.
We do not believe there is
much in the report. The op
position to Senator Vance
Will turn out to bo a very
weak concern in our opinion
The radicals in the U. S.
Senate without fear of the
before their eves, have called
up the Lodge election bill
and are hammering away oi:
it as though there was no
political hereafter. It is
probably that there will, be
enough conservative republi
cans that will vote with the
democrats, to kill the bill.
The President's message is
u lengthy affair. Ho dings !ffJ1 w,Urity two and four
totheMjKinley monstrocity,! vo.,rs ag()) therein oUr com
the Force bill and v all the
other abominations of the
extreme radical wing of his
party. Instead of taking
the advice of Blaine, Plumb,
and other more consistent
men ef his party, he goes in
with Heed, McKinley, Lodge
&Co.
The Indian troubles are
expected to be serious at any
time. It is stated that the
SLoux Indians have about
twelve thousand men of
fighting age. Crazy Horse,
Call," Kain-in-t he-Face, and
Running Antelope, are all
great warriors. Crazy Horse
we believe was in command
when the lamented Gen. Cus
ter and his men were massa
cred. It is alleged that bad
treatment of the Indians by
the agents ef our govern
ment is the cause of the pres
ent uprising. These agents
are a merciless set. They
speculate on the supplies fur
nished by the government
for the Indians, and sell ana
use them for their own. U. S.
troops are stationed nt va
rious points to check any
movement of i,he Sioux war
riors. Mr, Harrison is certainly
doing his part to keep a re
publican quoruir. in Wash
ington for the purpose of
pushing political legislation
through the House. He is
reported to have said to ' a
Congressman:'-' "I shall not
appoint any Representative
to a Federal office during
this session and I am frank
enough to add that those
who expect Appointment at
the close of the session roust
prove their faithfulness to
the party and the adminis
tration by remainingin their
seats until Congress ad
journs." .'This sort of thing
seems a little undignified ac-
cording . to old fashioned
ideas of what it is proper for
the President of the United
States to do, but everything
seems to oe proper- in tue
eyes of republicans, provided
it helps their party. "
The National Alliance has
had a tremendous meeting
atOcnla Fla. A third par
ty movement is strongly ad
vocated by many of the ulli
ancemen, but there 'is a very
strong opposition to it by
others. The assembly pass
ed a resolution against the
Election bill, while the west
ern members ars urging the
third party movement. The
opposition cornea from the
suth , mainly.. The "Sub-treas
iiirypian is neing uiseusseu
pro and con. The silver ques
tion and many other things
including rnilroads'and tele
graphs came in and were
prominent subjects for dis
cussion. The Alliance, aecor
ding to tjie National secreta
ry, is increasing all over the
country, especially in West
Ya . , Col ora d o , 1 i i d i a n : i , M i ch -igan,
Va., 111., S. C, Ohio
and Pennsylvania. Gen. R.
P. Vance, of North Carolina,
is a. prominent member in
the convention. ' : '
There is no question but
the alliance is getting to be
a wonderful . organization,
and will be able to dictate
Xa t i o n a H egi si a t i o n a n d ac
complish many things in the
way of reform.
The Western Citizen in its
last issue, discourses; on the
fairness of the County, Com
missioners of Ashe county in
receiving the official bonds
of the newly elected ( county
officers and contrasts their
action with that of the coun
ty Commissioners of Watau-
missioners charged with the
crime of exacting from -the
sheriff the fallolficial and tax
bonds before he could " be in
ducted into his office; The
implied charge, is, that the
sheriff elect, being a republi
can, the commissioners took
special pride in worryinghiin,
and subjecting him to as
much ill-convenience ' as pos-
Ml j i . 1 I 1 '
suae in geuing up nis nonas.
This is not our fight, but
we think the Citizen has been
hard pressed for political cap
ita.1 to wade into the com
missioners of Watauga in
this way. Our commission
ers hold that a sheriff, be
he democrat, or republican,
must fill both his official
and tax bonds before he can
be inducted into his office.
Our newly elected democratic
sheriff, D. F. Baird,' had to
toe the mark in this way on
the first Monday, but if the
commissioners in Ashe hold
differently, it is all right, as
this if: all there is in it.

- When I returned from the
meeting at Howard's Creek,
there was a gloom oyer our
settlement caused , by the
death of Martha Holsclaw.
Sister Holsclaw was born
Aug. 14th, 18GG. She was
24 years, 3 months and 12
days old when she died. She
joined the Baptist church, at
Beech Mountain at the age
of 14, and lived a consistant
Christian life until her death.
She was married to Y W, II.
Holsclaw, Dec; 8th, ' 1889,-
and only, lived one short
par and died with the hope
pf meeting us in Heaven
where partings are no more.

Editor Democrat:
All is quiet, peaceful, and
happy in our valley to-day.
The rain has been falling per
se veringly for the last few
hours, the first in several
weeks, so we should not
grumble.
The writer had the exquis
ite pleasure of attending the
Debating Society of this place
last night, and must siy, i
that I enjoyed it very much, j
The subject, under discussion i
was: Resolved: "That we;
Shall Have a compulso-y
School Law in N. C." The
s lbjeet was well handled
by both sides. Both old and
young gentlemen taking an
active part. Perhaps the
best effort on the occasion
was made by our good friend,
Mr. W. H. Calloway, who
said that he didn't speak for
argument alone but meant
every word he said. Mr. C.
is' very enthusiastic on the
subject of education, llis
speech we think gave the de
cision in favor of the affirm
ative. One thing impresses
the writer as laudible, in
these debates. No one at
tempts to shirk hia duty.
When his name is called he
walks out promptly and does
his best. Young boys in
their teens advance splendid
ideas, and skillfully sustain
them. They are very much
in earnest and their .efforts
show that they have read
and studied the subject. We
hope that the good people of
this neighborhood will con
tinue the debate through the
winter as it is a power for
good in any community,
when carried on nicely 'and
quietly, as this one is. -
Well! Christmas," 'the day
that we always hail with
gladness is near at. had.
None, from the little prat
tling child to the ones whose
heads are hoary wiih .age,
but always feels a .thrill of
pleasure at the mere' mention
of the word. It is always a
season of merry-making and
esiivity. This is all right if
not carried too far. Tradi
tion has handed it down to
us, that Christ was born -on'
that day. In memory then
of that joyful morn, when
the light from "Bethlehem's
manger, sent its scintillating
beams, across a lost and
ruined world celebrate it in
a decent quiet manner! To
our boys, our own W atauga
boys, the pride of our .coun
try, don't drink. Celebrate
one Christmas by 'not touch
ing nor handling the intoxi
cating cup. It will-'weaken
your mind, lower you in the
estimation of your friends,
and will slowly wraparound
you link by link, fetters thlit
after a.wbile you will find it
impossible to break, and that
will surely drag you down-to
a drunkard s grave. Don
drink-boys. "X.

Don't Give Up
The us of Ayer's Sarsaparilla. One bottle ,
may not cure "right off" complaint of
years; persist until a cure is effected. As a
general rule, improvement follows shortly
after beginning the use of this medicine..
With many people, the effect is immediately
noticeable i but some constitutions are less
susceptible to medicinal influences than
others, and the curative process may, there
fore, lu such cases, be less prompt. Perse
verance in using tliis remedy Is sure of its
reward at last. Sooner or Inter, the most
stubborn blood diseases yield to
Ayer's
Sarsaparilla
"For several years, in the spring months,
1 used to be troubled with a drowsy,, tired
feeling, and a dull pain in the small of my
back, so bad, at times, as to prevent my
being able to walk, the least sudden motion
causing me severe distress. Frequently,
boils and rashes would break nut on various
parts of the body. Hy the advice of friends
and my family physician, I begun Hie use of
Ayer's Sarsaparilla and continued It till the
poison in my blood whs thoroughly eradicated."-!,.
W. English, Montgomery City, Mo.
"My system was nil run down; my skin
rough and of yellowish hue. I tried various
remedies, and while some of tlieni guve me
temporary relief, none of tlieni did any per
manent good. At lint I begnu to tnko
Ayer's Sarsaparilla, continuing it exvluhlve.
ly for a considerable time, and am pleased
to say that it completely
Cured F2g.
I presume my liver was Very much out of
order, and the Idood impure In consequence.
I feel that 1 cannot too l:i.l:ly recommend
Ayer's Sarsaparilla to any i nc ufllieled as 1
was." Mrs. N. A. Smith, (ilover, Vt.
"For years I suffered from scrofnln mid
blood diseases. The doctors' prescriptions
and several so-called bloi d-purifiers being of
no avail, 1 was at last nil vised I y a friend to
try Ayer's Sarsaparilla. I did so. mid mnv
feel like a new ninu. being fully restored to
