PRESIDENT ASKS CONGE
TO AID IN RECONSTRUCTION
E
r PEACE TREATY
NATIONAL BUDGET SYSTEM ONE
OF VITAL NEEDS TO PROPER
LY FINANCE GOVERNMENT
WILL DEAL WITH RAILROAD
QUESTION LATER.
(By United Press.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 President
Wilson today sent to congress his
message urging an extensive program
of reconstructive legislation. His
communication was devoted entirely
to meeting the domestic problems con
senting the nation.
Although the president several
times referred to the peace treaty
and the league of nations he did not
discuss the situation. He will do so
in a later message, it was stated on
reliable information. He also will
deal later with the railroad question.
Much of the message was devoted to
the labor problem and how to solve it.
HIS Ml
IS FREE FROM
- Vhe ' president said congress "must
,-now ielD.in the task of .finding' a
, method that will bring about a gen
ine democratization of industry."
The President also urged the es
tablishment Of a national budget sys
tem, so designed that it will reduce
expenditures and abolish necessity for
&o much red tape. He also recoil
rnitndecl the simplification of income
faxes, excess profit taxes; legislation
to secure employment and land for
returned service men; laws to encour-
age increased crop production; pro
tection of the American new chemical
eye stuffs industry; passage of Attor
ney General Palmer's anti-red legis
Ration; laws to make it possible to
really reduce the cost of living by the
extension of the Lever act; laws to
brine- about the democratization of
industry, including the participation
of workers in decisions effecting their
' welfare and the establishment of prin-
ciples regarding labor as laid down in
toe League of nations.
No better means of bringing about
the democratization of industi-y can
be found, the President declared than
my applying to their legislation the
,' principles set up in the League of Na
tions. To go back to the old stand
ards of labor and wage is impossible,
; he declared, as the ae long antago
nism bc-tween labor and capital must
; be ended before the real ork of sta
bility can be accomplished.
' Have Right to Strike.
The President declared unequivo
cally, against anti-strike legislation.
Tne "right of individuals to strike is
inviolate," he declared,"and ought not
to be interfered with by.any process
pf government.' 'But,' he added, 'the
government has the right to protect
' people against the challenging aggres
sion of any single class.
Blame for the unrest in the coun
' .try was placed partly upon the Sen
ate for its failure to ratify the Peace
Tieaty.
The President suggested the estab-
Jisliment of a tribunal before which
disputes between capital and labor can
be taken for settlement.
To encourage formers the President
pleaded for legislation that would
properly encourage farmers to m
production and provide that
' : .I., maWta oAmA return for

their labors. He said that if rural
life is made more attractive food pro
duction will be stimulated.

NEAR; NATION IS
ASKED TO ABIDE
GOVERNMENT WILL NOT TAR

WHILE EFFFORTS BEING
MADE TO OPERATE MINES.
(By United Press.)
WASHINGTON,. Dec. 2 Orders
went out today to regional fuel direc
tor to acquaint the people of the coun
try with the necessity of the hour in
minimizing fuel consumption. The
new orders are even more drastic than
they were during the actual fighting
period.
Moved by reports of diminishing
coal stocks and growing danger of
distress in numerous sections, the gov
ernment sought no compromise with
striking mine workers whose walk-ouc
forced the emergency, but asked for
national determination to endure pri-
vttion and discomfort until coal min-
ing was resumed on its terms.
Fuel Administrator -Garfield, acting
in conjunction wTOT the railroad 4
ministration, gave notice that hereaf
ter only the essential consumers in-
eluded in the first five classes of the
war priorities list would be supplied
with coal, and asked the help of all
state and municipal authorities to
make rationing effective.
The order, which made national
those restrictions already put into lo
cal effect by regional coal commit'
tees, where the pinch of fuel shortage
has been felt, cuts off supplies from
all but transportation agencies, which
include inland and coastwise shipping.
&s well as railroads; federal and lo
cal government institutions and es
tablishments including concerns work
ing on government contracts; public
.utilities, including newspapers and re
tail dealers. Railroad administration
officials conceded that it meant wide
spread cessation of industrial opera
tions only justified by the gravity of
the situation.
"It is necessary that coal shall be
used only for essential purposes," Dr.
Garfield said in giving public notifi
cation cf the step. "Public utilities
consuming coal should discontinue to
furnish power, heat, and light to non
essential industries and should con
sume only sufficient coal to produce
enough light, power and heat to meet
the actual urgent needs of the people.
Advertising signs and displays of va
rious kinds necessitating the use of
coal should be distributed for sucn
purposes."
Have Figured Best Plan Possible, j
Officials said that the terms of the
order as given were framed to allow
the greatest possible variation in lo
cal arrangements so that emergencies
could be met by action best suited to
that result. Industrial establish
ments operating their own power
plants will be forced to shut dtvn
when present supplies are exhausted,
while the operations of those whose
power is supplied from public utility
plants will be curtailed or continued
in the discretion of local agencies ana
officials. Dr. Garfield noted further
that the "government would be glad
to leave supervision and control of dis
tribution by retail dealers entirely tD
any state, county or municipality
which may make provision therefor."

That school children in the country

According to Miss Bard the percen
tage of absence among the children in
rural schools is one and a half per
cent while in the city schools the ab
sence for sickness runs up to five per
cent. Superintendent Price and Miss
Bird both believe this is due to the
fact that parents are not seeing that
their children attend school when they
really should:
According to Miss Bard's report the
greatest percentage of absentees is in
the lower grades, delow the fifth. Su-
perintedent Price points out that poor
attendance is always a great burden
to teachers, as it necessitates taking
special pains with the child who, was
absent, seeing that it catches up' with

INSTANCES OF LAXITY WITH
ANARCHISTS UNDER EX-COM-MISSIONES
HOWE AT ELLIS
ISLAND READ IN TO REPORT
OF HOUSE COMMITTEE.
, (By United Press)
NEW YORK, !Dec. 2 At yester
day's session of the House Commit
tee on Immigration's inquiry into
conditions on Ellis Island, Congress
man Isaac Siegel of this city read a
statement for the record, which said
that of 697 radicals sent to Ellis Is
land for deportation, between Feb. 5,
1917, and Nov. 1, 1919, according to a
report jtrom the Department of Labor
to the Speaker of the House, only six
ty were actually deported. The oth
ers, Mr. Siegel said, were either re
leased on their own recognizance or
bailed pending appeals.
He said that 557 were turned loose
in this-city of the 697 originally de
tained. : All these cases were under
the regime of Dr. Frederic C. Howe as
Commissioner of Immigration.
"Soecial privileges were shown to
aliens ff this character," charged Con
gresaman Siegel. "In ordinary cases
of immigrants refused admittance it
takes about three weeks to have them
deported. In the cases of these An
archists, however, the cases have
dragged on for months and many have
been turned loose, among them dan
gerous criminals."
Congressman Siegel read into the
record a score of cases of 1919 as in
stances of laxity in handling radical
aliens on Ellis Island. The aliens, it
was shown, have disappeared after be-
ng paroled.
ASK FRANCE TO GIVE
US DEAD FROM FIELDS
E!
PARIS, Dec. 2 Efforts to have the
bodies of American soldiers buried in
Fvacne returned soon are being con
tinued, regardless of the officially ex
pressed attitude of the French Gov
ernment against permitting American
exhumations before the same privi
lege is accorded to French families.
The American Embassy has presented
to the Foreign Office a note from
Washington setting forth the desire
of the American people to have cheir
dead in their own country as soon as
possible.
y BrUj. Gen. W. D. Connor, comman
der of the American troops in France,
-eeently held a meeting with the
French authorities to discuss the pro
cedure in exhaustions when the time
ccmes for removal of the bodies.
Despite the French official attitude
against allowing Americans to remove
Umir dead while the French must
wait, it is said to De tne ieeung m
some quarters that it would be diffi
cult to refuse the American if pres
sure were exerted.
It is pointed out that the French
have more than 1,000,000 bodies of
their own which would require much
time to remove, that the Americans
are far ahead of the French in group
ing and indentifying their bodies, and
that the number of American dead is
slight compared with either the Brit
ish or French. .

(By United Press.)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 2 How Am
erica's vast war machine traveling
at top speed toward its goal of vic
tory has reversed i$o gears and witn
the same speed traveled toward the
goal of peace conditions is shown in
Secretary of War Baker's annual re
port to the President, dealing with
the War Department's activities ii
1919.
Bending every effort to the task of
piling as many guns, men and muni
tions against the Kaiser's line in
France as possible the War Depart
ment was suddenly called on by the
armisi, ,.e to put these same men and
supplies back into the channels of
peace with even more speed.
The task of demobilization, the
largest job of the many following ths
armistice, isdone, the Secretary said.
The maximum size of the army was
close to 4,000,000 men. On Novem
ber 10, 1919, 10,266 officers and 2,
2S6.266 enlisted men had been de
mobilized. Involved in this work were prob
lems almost as complex as the work
itself. In returning this vast num
ber of men to the industries of peace
there arose first the matter of bring
ing back across the ocean in an even
shorter time than waa required to
send them the 2,(p000 men in
Fiance. Next arose-. , ; problem of
re-employment. This has been large
ly overcome, says the Secretary,
through government agencies and the
generous cooperations of the indus
tries themselves.
A summary of the War Depart
ments activities, as outlined by Sec
retary Baker, might include, besides
the job of demobilization, the estab
lishment of a permanent garrison
along',e Rhine, provision of troops
for exptditionary duty in conjunction
- T"
with the peace treaty, maintenance
of forces in Russia, and the readjust
ment of the War Department pro
gramme to the demands of peace.
In addition to this, the War De
partment has been called on to fur-r.is-h
troops to preserve law and ol
der virtually every month of the
j ear 1919. This has constituted no
small part of the general worn oi tne
tepartment, the secretary's report
shows.
Included in this work has been the
preservation of order in shipyard
strikes at Seattle and Tacoma, Wash,
mining strikes in Montana, the pres
ent steel strike at Gary, Ind., anti
riots, I. W. W. agitations, as well as
the guarding of Government plants
and property.
In connection with tha demobiliza
tion Secretary Baker devoted a por
tion of his report to the forces now
in Siberia, over which much controv-
eisy has arisen. Although the ar
mistice was signed in the West in
November, 1918, the Siberian force
has been in action in I9i9, the cs3U?.l
-is up to October 1, 19 .9, being 10J
men dead, of whom 28 were killed ir
action and 8 died of wounds.
During the summer of 1919, Se-re-
tarv Baker saia, eu"

vice and 3,315 men were sent ever
s placements for m who have
been discharged.

TO ADJUST DIFFERENCES BE
TWEEN TWO COUNTRIES. .
(By United Press)
NEW YORK, Dec. 2 Editors of six
of the leading daily newspapers of
Mexico have sent a blanket message
to the American press urging the ap
pointment of an American-Mexican
delegation to clear up any differences
that may exist between the two gov
ernments, thus avoided the conse
quences that "may fall upon our coun
tries as an outcome of enmity.
It is suggested that the delegation
consist of five from each country, and
' we earnestly jnvite you, involving a
world partnership of the press, to give
your support to the meeting, and that
you ask President Wilson to accept
the move we are proposing."

El Paso, Dec. 2 Further confirma
tion that the Eightieth regiment of
Mexican federal troops was massacred
by Villa and 1,000 followers last Fri
day morning was brought here today.
It is said that Villa took two officers

pated in the capture and execution of

reported that a provisional brigade
is also en route to Coblenz, Germany,
with a view to possible use in Silesia.
The forces on the Rhine are being
supplied from a base at Rotterdam
and Antwerp established by the Am
erican army.
As demobilization of the wartime
farces of the country practically
meant annihilation of .all our mili
tary forces, Secretary Baker said, en
listments for the army were author
ised and a recruiting campaign con
ducted. Since February 1, 1919, he
said, a total of 737,000 men have been
enlisted for one and three year peri
ods. In this connection, Secretary Ba
ker pomfifd out that the war has
shown the need of fundamental re
organization of our army and the War
Pepartment. He recommended as a
solution of the present problem the
War Department bill providing for a
regular army of 500,000 men, a re
soive provided by universal training
and a reorganization of the War De
partment to meet this changed plan
of defense.
Sp-rpterv Baker paid tribute to ths
genius of General Pershing in his cre
ation of the vast organization of war
in France, and also to General March,
Chief of Staff.
Included in the' reseating of plans
tfter the armistice has been the dis
position of the vast accumulation of
supplies in America and France. Of
this Rwrebarv Baker said that' fully-
half of that held in America has been
disposed of and $627,000,000 has been
realized through the sale of property
in France, of which $400,000,000 rep
resents sales to the French Government.
