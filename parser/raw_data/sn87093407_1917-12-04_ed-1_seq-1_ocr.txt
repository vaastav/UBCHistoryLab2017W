of police, who h.is consented to take the position it as
sured that following a thoro cleanup of the city under
his direction the quarantine imposed by («en. Greene

In the meantime. anti-Gill forces announced they
would continue their efforts to have the mayor im
peached by the city council in any event.
Other high spots in the vice-cleanup situation were
the arrest of 24 women by deputy sheriffs, and the an
nouncement by the police that men who live off the

Mackintosh for Chief-and Mayor
Judge Kenneth Mackintosh for
chief of police!
By all means, let lis have him.
The idea seems almost an in
spired one. It can very well be the
key to our whole distressing mu
nicipal-vice-mayoralty problem.
It will not only solve the imme
diate difficulty—the lifting of the
quarantine from Seattle by a thoro
cleanup of vice conditions —
but it will settle also the perplex
ing question of who the next mayor
should bo.
Let Judge Mackintosh take hold
of the police job and make good, as
he can and will do, and he should
be the next mayor of this city by
acclamation.
We need his type as mayor of
the city in these war times.
In ordinary times, Judge Mack
intosh would never think of accept
ing the job of chief of police.
But these are not ordinary
times —and Mackintosh is big
enough to recognize that fact, even
if he has to become a policeman for
the time being.
Mackintosh for chief —and for
mayor! A happy solution, indeed.
He's a refreshing type for this mo

WASHINGTON, Doc. 4.—President Wilson today called
upon congress to declare a state of war against Austria-
Hungary.
Pledging America to war to victory and declaring noth
ing shall turn us aside, he asked that Austria-Hungary be
formally listed among America's enemies to remove this
"embarrassing obstacle that stands in our way."
Any peace that America makes must include delivery
of the peoples of Austria-Hungary, Turkey and the Balkans
as well as northern France and Belgium from Prussian
domination, he said.
The president suggested remedial legislation to meet
the railroad and food-price situation. The latter, he said,
was based on "selfishness" at present ratner than on the
law of supply and demand. He urged legislation for full
use of natural resources and water power of the country,
more drastic laws to punish alien enemies and an amend
ment to include women as well as men under the alien
enemy act.
The president suggested that, instead of confining
enemy aliens in comfortable internment camps, they be put
in penitentiaries where they can be made to work "as
other criminals do."
