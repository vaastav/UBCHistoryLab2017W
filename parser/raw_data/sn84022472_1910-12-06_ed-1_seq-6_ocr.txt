PRESIDENT TAFTS MESSAGE.
President Tart's message to Con
gress Is unconscionably long1 so
lengthy in fact that those who read
its complete text, will probably be few
in number. It Is hardly possible
HnrJthln the ordinary editorial limits to
' summarize the entire message, but
only to cover those features of cur
rent Interest and general importance.
He recommends "the passage of a
measure by mall subsidy or other sub
vention adequate to guarantee the es
tablishment and rapid development of
an American merchant marine."
The estimates of expenditures pre
sent, he says, the smallest necessary
amounts, though this "does not apply
to the river and harbor estimates".
Bhould Congress decide to fortify the
Panama canal, at an estimated coat
of $19,000,000. there will be a probable
deficit of about $7,000,000. He recom
mends such fortification.
He commends the new tariff "as an
Income-producing measure", and de
clares that the corporate income tax
"has worked well". Of the regulations
for publicity of corporate returns, he
says:
I have made It possible for the pub
lic generaly to know from an exami
nation of the record, the returns of all
corporations, the stock of which is
listed on any public stock exchange
'or Is offered for sale to the general
public by advertisement or otherw'se.
The returns of those corporations
whose stock Is not ?o. listed or offered
for sale are directed to be "open to the
inspection and examination of credit
ors and stockholders of the corpora
tion whose record is sought. The re
turns of all corporations are subject
to the Inspection of any government
officer or to the examination of any
court. In wh'ch the return made by the
corporation Is relevant and competent
evidence.
He refers to the tar'ff question with
out exnrepsine his own opinion, and
rays he hopes "to be able at the open
ing of the new Congress, or at least
during the session of that Congress,
to bring to its attention the facts In
regard to those schedules in the pres
ent tariff that may prove to need
amendment", but urges that tariff
revision be limited to "one schedule
at a time". He suggests that the
present Tariff board be made "a per
manent tariff commission"'.
He commends the work of the Al
dr!ch Monetary Commission thus far,
but does not commit himself upon the
project of a great central bank.
'The Panama canal will, he says, be
completed within the estimate of cost,
$375,000,000. He favors a toll of $1 a
net ton for use of the canal when
opened, and suggests that the govern
ment should Include in Its management
of the canal the furnishing of dry
dock and repair-shop facilities and the
sale of coal, oil and other ship sup
plies. He also sueeests the enact
ment of a law "prohibiting Interstate
commerce railroads, from owning or
controlling ships engaged in the trade
through the Panama canal", as
"needed to save to the people of the
United tates the benefits of the com
petition in trade between the eastern
and western seaboards which this
canal was constructed to secure".
He renews his recommendation of
the enactment of "a general law pro
viding for the incorporation of indus
trial and other companies engaged in
Interstate commerce": He also re
news his recommendation of "the pass
age of a law which shall regulate the
isuing of injunctions In equity with
out notice in accordance with the best
practice now in vogue in the courts
of the United States", because it has
been promised and "because It will
deprive those who now complain of
certain alleged abuses in the improper
issuing of injunctions without notice
of any real ground for further amend
ment and will take away all sem
blance of support for the extremely
radical legislation they propose, which
will be most pernicious if adopted,
will sap the foundations of judicial
power, and legalize that cruel social
instrument, the secondary boycott".
Postal savings banks "will be opened
in some cities and towns on the 1st
of January, and there will be a grad
ual extension of the benefits of the
plan" to the rest of the country".
He states that "It would be wise to
put p the classified service the first,
second and third-class postmasters",
although th's would lessen the patron
age of Senators and Representatives.
The proposition of compellfng maga
zines to pay a higher rate of postage
on their advertising sections, he says,
may promote a reduction of letter post
age to one cent.
He recommends adoption of the par
cels post "on all rural-delivery routes,
and that 11 pounds the International
limit be made the limit of carriage in
such post, and this with a view to its
general extension when the Income of
the post office will permit it and the
postal savings banks shall have been
fully established".
Some of our navy-yards are "entire
ly useless for naval purposes" and the
President approves the Navy Depart
ment's recommendation that they be
abandoned. One of them is at New
London. He favors the establishment
of a naval station at Guantanomo,
Cuba,
He recommends that the coal depos
its of the government be leased upon
competitive bids, with royalties upon
the coal mined, with not more than
2.5C0 acres of surface leased to any one
lessee; that government phosphate
lands be similarly treated, but with
power retained to regulate or prohibit
exportation; that oil prospectors on
government lands be licensed for two
years, and leases granted upon rental
and royalties and under proper re
strictions as to husbanding the supply
and preventing monopolistic combina
tions; that water power sites be leased
upon bids, and suitable rentals, with
provisions against monopolistic combi
nations. Of pensions, the President states
that "care should be exercised not to
go to classes of persons who may, at
this late day, from a mere mercenary
motive, seek to obtain some legal re
lation with an old veteran now totter
ing on the brink of the grave."
Referring to the facts that one-half
of the privately-owned timber of the
country is held by 200 individuals and
corporations and that "there is a very
extensive interownership of stock", the
President says that this "might lead to
a combination for the maintenance of
a price that would be very detrimental
to the public interest, and would create
the necessity of removing ail tariff
obstacles to the free Importations of
lumber from other countries."
"With regard to the eight-hour law,
the President, recommends that "the
present act . be enlarged by providing
that public works be construed to
include not only buildings and work
upon public eround. but also ships.
armor, and large guns when manufac
tured in private yards or factories ,
but that the President be authorized
"to declare an emergency in special
cases" and in such cases "to permit
the payment by the Government of
extra compensation for the time work
ed each day in excess of elsht hours."
On "workmen's compensation", he
does not commit himself, but says: .
In view of the keen, widespread in
terest now felt in the United States
In a system of compensation for ln
dustr'al accidents to supplant our pres
ent thoroughly unsatisfactory system
of employers' HaMIity (a subject the
Importance of which Congress has al
ready recognized by the appointment
of a commission). I recommend that
the International Conereas on Indus
trial Insurance be invited to hold its
meeting in 1913 in Washington, and
that an appropriation of $10,000 be
Trade to cover the necessary expenses
of organizing and carrying on the
meeting. 1 .
With regard to public service cor
porations In the district of Columbia,
he expresses a hope that Congress
will entrust the Dstrict commission
ers "with powers similar to those of
the public utilities commission of New
York or similar boards in Massachu
setts." In the matter of civil service retire
ment, the President declares "that the
simplest and most Independent solution
of the problem for both employe , and
the Government la a compulsory sav
ings arrangement, the employe to set
aside from his salary a sum sufficient,
with the help of a liberal rate of in
terest from the Government, to pur
chase an adequate annuity for him on
retirement, this accumulation to be
Inalienably h's and claimable If he
leaves the service before reaching the
retirement age or by his heirs in case
of death." But he would further pro
vide that, in the cases of employes
"who are now so advanced in age that
their personal contributions will not

before reaching the retirement age",
the "annuities shall be paid out of the
salaries appropriated for the positions
vacated by retirement, and that the
difference between the annuities thus
granted and the salaries may be used
for the mploymnt of efflcint clerks at
the lower grades."
The President recommends fa rea
sonable appropriation to enable the
Interstate Commerce . Commission " to
proceed with due' dispatch to the val
uation of all railroads."
He does not recommend any amend
ment to the anti-trust law. because:
The existing legislation with refer
ence to the regulation of corporations
and the restraint of their business has
reached a point where we can stop
for a while and witness the effect of
the vigorous execution of the laws on
the statute books 'in restraining the
abuses which certainly did exist and
which roused the public to demand re
form. There will be some disappointment
over the non-committal character of
the President's references to several
important matters, notably the tariff,
and workmen's compensation.
DR. THOMPSON IS
KEEPING UP WAR
ON DEGENERATES
Addresses 'Associated Charities
Along Lines of the Far
mer's Interview
Further outlining her plans as
originally given in an interview pub
lished exclusively by The Farmer, I
H. Adeline Thompson addressed a
meeting of the Associated Charities
yesterday afternoon and impressed
upon the women present the need of
drastic legislation to protect woman
kind against waves of lust crimes,,
such as the epidemic disclosed in
Bridgeport at present.
From her viewpoint as a physician
Dr. Thompson outlined the deadly
menace which will always exist so
long as degenerates are allowed to
roam around the streets. The punish
ment for crimes such as the one
which have recently horrified and dis
gusted the city, Dr. Thompson be
'ieves should be unsexing, as a pro
tection to both the present and the
future generations. Such a law in
operation in the course of time would
effectually stamp out the breed of de
generate?. This law is now in opera
tion in the state of Illinois and is un
der consideration in many other
states.
It 13 suggested that a petition be
drawn up, to which signatures mav
be affixed. Dr. Thompson exonerates
most of mankind from the shame of
the crimes of which a few human
brutes are guilty.

AGED WOMAN IS
FATALLY BURNED
BY UPSET LAMP
Through the upsetting of a lamp in
her room at 114 Burroughs street. Mrs.
Ellen Robertson, a widow, aged 75. was
badly and perhaps fatally burned last
night. At the Bridgeport hospital,
whither she was taken in the ambu
lance, it was reported this morning
that her condition is very grave and
that her chances for recovery are
slight Indeed.
Mrs. Robertson occupied a little
room over the home of the Rev. Wil
liam Rltzman. pastor of the German
Baptist church. Last night about 10
o'clock, while moving about her room,
she overturned the kerosene lamp.
The lamp broke and the burning oil
ignited Mrs. Robertson's clothes and
spread the flames throughout the
room.
Hearing her screams. Pastor Ritz
man rushed upstairs and attempted to
smother the flames upon her. the en
tire room then being ablaze. He
finaly put out the fire and the ambu
lance corps was summoned. Mrs!
Robertson was bathed in carron oil
and removed to the Bridgeport hos
pital. Owing to the terrible nature
of her burns her chances for recovery
are practically nil.
SECRETARY MEYERSRLPORT
Favors Abandonment of 8 Navy
Yards as Nearly Ue.ess
Washington, Dec. 6. A shock such
as has seiuom been felt in naval cir
cles tollowed the publication of the
annual report of Secretary of the
.Navy Meyer, In which he proposed
the abolition of the navy yards at
XSiew Orleans, Pensacola, San Juan,
Port Royal, New London, Sackett's
Harbor, Culebra and Cavite. By the
elimination of these seven yards Mey
er said that he ' removed an averagu
annual expense for maintenance of
$1,672,675. He declared that during
the last five years very little useful
work had been done in any of the
yards named.
One new navy yard is indefinitely
suggested for San Francisco Bay.
Following a discussion of the limita
tions of the yards at Mare Island and
Bremerton, Meyer said:
"I conclude that it will be neces
sary to establish a docking and re
pair station on San Franciscd Bay n
some locality yet to be selected. Such
a repair station should include one or
more docks of the largest size, for
taking our largest existing and con
templated battleships."
On the other hand Meyer recom
mends the further development of
the Bremerton yards and enlarge
ment of the channel at Mare Island
"in view of the fact that a fleet at
some time after the opening of the
Panama Canal may be based in the
Pacific Ocean."
Discussing navy yards in general
the Secretary said:
"The- United States has over twice
as many first clas- home navy yards
as has Great Britain with a navy
at least double the size of ours and
we have one more navy yard of the
second class than Great Britain has.
In other word3 we have in all 11
first and second class navy yards In
the United States, while Great Brit
ain has but 6 of the same kind. Ger
many has 3 and France 5."
The Secretary recommends aband
onment of the yards at New -Orleans
and Rensacola on the ground that
they are strategically unnecessary.
The Key West station, however. ! o
be retained, owing to its geographi
cal situation as a base of supply and
the fact that it supplements the naval
base at Guanianamo. As to the yards
along the Atlantic coast Meyer de
clares the Port Royar. (S. C.) dry
dock unapproachable for battleships
or cruisers except at an unjustifiable
expense, and the Charleston, (S. C.)
dock useless for the same character
of vessels owing to the rapidity with
which it fills with debris. Since the
Porfmouth. Boston, , New York, Phil
odelphia and Norfolk yards have ac
cessible dry docks for battleships ami
efficient repair facilities. Meyer be
l'evps It hardly advisable to gie
them up.
Recommendation is made for. an
appropriation of $25,000 with which
to conduct experiments covering the
use of the aeroplane for naval re
connoissance. Commenting on the
fisrht mae by Eugene Ely from tho
deck of the .ecout cruiser Birming
ham Meyer said:
"This experiment and the advences
which have been made in aviation
seemed to demonstrate that the aero
plane is destined to perform some,
part in the naval war fare of the
future. It appears likely that this
will be limited to scouting. A scout
which is not strong enough to pierce
the enemy's line can get as near as
possible and then send an aeroplane
3 or 40 miles, obtain valuable in
formation and then return to the
scout.. Even i the aviator did not
land on the scout he could be brought
on board and deliver his information.
The loss of an aeroplane would oe
pf no moment, as the ship may easily
carry others. The distinct value of
service of this kind is easily seen.
"The department contemplates fur
ther experiments along these lines
with the belief that it will be neces
sary in the near future to equip all
scouts with one or more aeroplanes
to increase the distance at which in
formation can be secured."
A saving of $4,300,000 in the esti
mates for the next fiscal year for th
Navy Department is indicated by the
Secretary the second year of , cur
tailment. Notwithstanding this eco
nomy in the past, the Secretary de
clares there has been an Increase In
the sea-keeping ability of the fleet i
of 15 ner cent.: an Increase of 5 nr
cent, in the average speed, of20 per
cent, in the cruising speed and an
increase of 16 per cent, in machinery
horsepower. Despite this latter item
and the greater mileage of cruisins,
the cost of fuel used in the navy has
decreased $2,000,000. Singularly
enough this decrease is more appar
ent, during the latter half of last year
than during the former, notwith
standing it was in the second half
1hat most of the cruising occurred.
The coct of maintenance for each ship
?n commission has shown a decrease
over the year before of 2'0.ono.
The Secretary asks Congress for
legislation establishing the present
Meyer re-orea nidation scheme. Tils
recommendations in this respect how
ever occasioned surprise in naval cir- j
cles owing to their being less than ;
was expected. It was believed that
Meyer would reoueet that the naval
aides, who are line officers and ra-
olace the old civilian bureau chiefs ,
t : T7 i ' i
ue given luruier executive power.

It is with a breath of wonderment that visitors en
ter the store these days, and at every entrance it is the
same, a vision of reen depths like woods, with fes
toons and arches of sparking lights, and the tantaliz
ing frangrance of balsam, of which some persons
never can get enough. This woodsy smell comes
from the many little balsam trees which are mingled
with the decorations of Christmas greens. It is like
walking through forest paths to look at beautiful arti- .
cles of merchandise.
Red Christmas bells are amonar the hansrinsr green
