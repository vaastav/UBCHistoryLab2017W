8 largely , .not exclusively a v ,r upon the first
principle of popular government, the ri-hts of
Ttie people Conclusive evidence of tiiia is
tound m the most grave and maturely consider
ed public documents as well as in the general
tone of the insurgents. In these documents we
mid the abridgement of the existing right ofsuf
tragc and the denial to the people of all ri-ht
to participate in the selection of public officers
except the Legislative body advocated with hi
oored arguments to prove that the 1 arsrc control
01 a government by the people is the- source of
nil political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes
hinteu at as a possible refuge from the power
of the people.
In my present position, 1 could scarcely be
justified were I to omit raising a warning voice
against this approach of returning despotism.
n is not nccdtul nor fitting here that general
argument should be made in favor of popular
",,ou'uui out mere is one witn its connec
tions not so hackneyed as most others to which
I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to place
capital on an eaual footi ncr wit.ll. it" nnf tilinvn
wiiacapicu, uiat no!)ody labors unless some-
uouy else o
owmmr ca nital someb OW bv tht nun
of it, induces him to labor. This assumed, it
is next considered whether it is best that, rnrot-..
al shall hire laborers and thus induce them to
work by their own consent, or buy them and
drive them to it without their consent. Ilavins
proceeded so far it is naturally concluded that
all laborers are either hired laborers or what we
call slaves, and further it i.i ae.-iumed that who
ever is once a hired laborer is lixed in that con
dition for life. Now there is no such kbor as as
sumed, nor is there any such thing as a free man
being fixed for life in the condition of n slave
laborer. Both of these assumptions are false,
and all inferences from chem arc irroundlosw.
Labor is prior to and independent of capital.
Capital is only the fruit of labor and could nev
er have existed n labor had not first existed.
Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves
much the higher consideration. Capital has
its rights which are as worthy of protection as
any other rights. Nor is it denied that there ia
tnd probably always will be a relation between
labor and capital producing mutual benefits.
i lie error is m assuming that toe whole labor
for n few men owning capital, and that a few
avoid labor themselves and with their capital
hire another few to labor for them, and a large
majority belonging to another class neither
work for others nor have others vJtk for thorn.
In meet of the Southern States a majority of
the whole people of all colors are neither slaves
nor masters, while in the Nortii a largo majori
ty are neiifier hirelings nor hired. Men with
their families, wive, bons and daughters, work
for themselves on their farms, in their houses
and in their shops, taking the whole product lo
themselves, and asking no favors of capital on
the one baud, nor of fared labor on the other.
It is not forgotten that a considerable number
of persons mingle- their own labor with capital
that is, they labor with tneir own nanus, and
alco buy or hire otheis to labor for them, but
this Is OfiiV a mixed end not a distinct class.
No principle stated is (fifiiurbed by the existence
of this mixed class. Agulo, as had already been
aid. there is not of necessity. ioy Bnch thin";

dition for life. Many independent everywhere

trusted than those who toil up from poverty
none less inclined to take or touch aught wlueti

surely be used to close tne ooor oi auv.ti.co

From the first taking of our national census

ulation at the end of Uie period, eight limes us

Sbnatb. The President's mtwage was com;
munieated soon after the opening of the Senate, ! TT
through his private Secretary, Xiolay. i V
Tle usual number of the message and accom- !
panying documents, wore ordered to bo printed.
Mr. Grimes of Iowa introduced the follow-
ing :
Resolved, That tho thanks of Congress bs,
and hereby are, tendered to Capt. Samuel F.
Dupont, and through him to the officers, petty
officers, seamen and marines attached to the
squadron under his command, for their decisive
and splendid victory achieved at Port Royal, on
the 7th day of November last.
Mr Grimes had no doubt every Senator was
prepared to vote for the resolution now, but the
best course to pursue was, perhaps, to act in
accordance with precedent, and refer the reso
lution to the Committee on Naval Affairs.
The resolution was hid aside until the forma
tion of tho Standing Committees
Mr. Foster of Conn
gave notice of his inten-
tion to introduce a bill supplimentary to tho
act to autuorize protection to be given to citi
zens of the U. S. who may discover deposits of
guano, approved Aug. 2Gth.
On motion of Mr. Foster it was resolved that
the Vica President appoint two members to fill
the vacancies in the Smithsonian Institution,
occasioned by the death of Senator Douglas,
and the expulsion of James M. Mason, late Sen
ator from Virginia. Adjourned.
House. Mr. Mayuard of Tennessee, present
ed the credentials of Mr. Clemens, representa
ive elect from the 4th District of Tennessee.
He briefly related the circumstances under which
the election was held, saying that three mem
bers were elected in East Tennessee, men who
declare for the National Constitution, and for
tlvj flag under which they had lived and und
which they had hoped to die.
lie spoke of the difficulty attending travel
which prevents thnn from reaching Washing
ton, to attend the Extra. Session. On motion,
the credentials were referred to the Committee
on Elections.
The President's Message was received a few
minutes alter noon and read. On motion of
Mr. Washburn ol Illinois tho Message was re
ferred to tho Committee of tho Whole on the
State of tho Union, and his motion for printing
50,000 extra copies was referred to the Commit
tee on Printing.
Mr. Dunn of Indiana, offered tho follawing :
Whereas, Henry C. Burnett, a member of
this House froniKentncky, is in open rebellion
ianist the Government of tho United States,
therefore,
licsolrcd, That tho said Henry C. linnctt oo
and is hereby expelled from this House, and
that the Governor of Kentucky be notified of
bis expulsion.
lUsolvcd, That tho surgoaiit-at-iirms oe di

" in armed rebellion,'' but he heads a provision
al Government in Kentucky, a Revolutionary
Convention.
Not satisfied with tho treatment of this Gov
ernment to maintain the Union, nor satisaed
with the course of his own State, he (Burnett)
has assumed tho important duty ol organizing
another Government, for tho better protection
of the lives, property and liberties of the people
of Kentucky.
In this undertaking he lias employed ounon
Buckncr, who is not only somewhat assimilated
in name but in the deeds alio of another Simon,
who once headed the Indians in Kentucky.
Three times has tho gallant Statt declared by
overwhelming majorities that efoe would not
leave the United States to run after strango
gods, or for tho eo'ealled Southern Republic.
Notwitbrtafrdirri; her repeated declarations for
the Union, they bad! hien told tho objocts of tho
Convention and of tht so-called Southern Con
federacy Wfiro to relic trtertt from a despotism,
and to protect their rights, and that wo wero
deceived.
We were told by tho Executivo of tho so
called Southern Confederacy that it was intend
ed to respect tho condition of Ky., which it was
pretended would not be done by tho Government
of the United States.
The Union men of Kentucky never ;did deny
the right of the Federal Government to occupy
its soil for tho exorcise of tho purposes implied
by the Constitution.

to ilie Executive of the United States, and one
to tho President of tho Southern Government,
to

Kentucky. . !
The former said it was intended to maintain

The provisional governor of Kentucky was

A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT.
Foutbess Monroe, Dec. C.
A sharp cngngeiuent between the U. ti. gun
boats, Hetzcl, Seymour, Whitehall and Shaw
nee and a rebel steaavii',supposed to bo the York
town, took pltsco yesterday, about five miles
above Newport News.
The bombardment lusted about two hours,
comrnenciag at 5 o'clock in the morning. The
rebel steamer kept closn to tho shore, where a
powerful battery assisted it materially , but never
ventured within range of our guns. The en
gagement was kept up with great vigor, and tho
roar of artillery was plainly heard at Old Point.
By that means we learned that tho rebel vesssl
engaged in the action yesterday was tho steam
er Patrick Henry. The rebels claim that no
damage was done to them.
