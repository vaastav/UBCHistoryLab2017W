Irish Free State Is
Recognized By Great
. Britain; Ulster Only
. Remaining Obstacle
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
L. LONDON, Dec. 6. The centuries
old quarrel between England and Ire
land was ended in the small hours of
Tuesday morning by the signatures
In the premier's cabinet room of "a
treaty between Great Britain and
Ireland," t consisting? of eighteen
articles, giving Ireland the title of the
Irish Free State, and the same con
stitutional status as Canada. Aus
tralia and other overseas dominions.
The question of allegiance, which
had threatened to wreck the nego
tiations was surmounted by permit
ting members of the Irish parliament
to swear allegiance to the constitu
tion oft the Irish Free State and "be
faithful to His Majesty the King."
v The treaty has to run the gauntlet
of the Ulster government and of the
Imperial parliament, which has been
summoned to meet December 14.
Approval by parliament is a foregone
conclusion. The position of Ulster
is less certain. Evidence comes
from Belfast that the treaty will be
subjected to the most searching ex
amination, and many modifications
may be proposed.
The king hastened to send the pre
mier a telegram congratulating him
on the success of the negotiations.
The treaty was signed by all mem
bers of the Irish delegations partici
pating, the Irish delegates - signing
their Gaelic names.
Ireland is treated as a single entity
in the treaty, with special clauses
providing against the .possibility that
Ulster should refuse acquiescence in
the settlement, in which case the
government of Ireland act of 1920
will remain in force so far as the
northern parliament is concerned,
but with the stipulation that a special
commission shall determine new
boundaries for Northern Ireland.
Provisions also are made for the
eo-oteration of the two parliaments
in providing certain safeguards in the
event of Ulster remaining out of the
- free state. Neither parliament, how
ever will be permitted to make laws
endowing any particular religion, or
to impose any religious aisauiniy.
The treaty looks to Ireland in the
future of undertaking its own coastal
defense and provides that Ireland
shall during war give the British
forces necessary harbor and other
facilities. . It further recognizes the
Irish free state's right to maintain its
wn military defense force.
Premier Lloyd George is the recip
ient of universal congratulations for
having successfully rescued uie ne
gotiations. The general beiier. now
ever, is that Lord Birkenhead is re
sponsible' for the formula overcoming
tne allegiance uiiLiuutt.,
Austen Chamberlain, leader of the
government in the house of commons
and of -the Unionist party, speaking
at Birmingham tonight expressed the
conviction that before Christmas
peace and good will would be estab
ltKhed
Immediately after the signing, of
the treaty, which took place at :iu
a. m., a messenger was started post
haste lor Belfast, as Lloyd George
had promised Sir, James Crig, Ul-
tr nremier. that either new pro-
nnaals would be in his hands by
Tuesday or the negotiations would be
finished.
The signing took place in the his
oric cabinet room, the premier and
Arthur Griffith being the first to

" Own Defense Today
The Insanity defense which has
teen prepared In behalf of Roy G.
Gardner, mail bandit, who is being
tried in the federal court on a charge
of having robbed an Arizona Eastern
mail car at Maricopa on the morning
of Nov, 3, was uncovered yesterday
by his attorney, Carl A. Davis, who
followed a brief outline of the pro
posed defense to the jury with the
presentation of evidence which con
cerned Gardner's mental capacity
only, with no regard to the case
which had been built up against him
by Thomas A. Flynn, United States
district attorney, and the government
agents associated with him.
When, soon after the resumption of
the case yesterday afternoon, the
government rested its case, Davis
made a brief statement of the plan of
the defense to the jury. He said
that the nature of the defense would
be Gardner's mental unsoundness and
his inability to control his intentions,
a condition which is due, he said, to
an injury suffered by Gardner some
years ago at Bisbee. He declared
that Gardner is irresponsible, and is
unable to follow his own will and vo
lition in many ot the things he does.
This statement was followed by the
testimony of several witnesses who
had observed the defendant under va
rious circumstances testimony w fclch
lasted throughout the afternoon and
which will be continued today.
Government Opens Case
The government opened its case
yesterday with a continuance of the
testimony which has been a length
ening chain, built up link by link,
connecting Gardner with the Mari
copa robbery. The first witness was
K. D. Chance, United States postof-
fice inspector, who gave a summary
of the registered matter stolen by
Gardner from the mail car. He 101
lowed this by telling of the discovery
of a lady's wrist watch which had
been in the registered mail taken
from the car and which had been
given by Gardner to Mrs. C. E. Col
lins, proprietor of Kelly's Waffle
Kitchen, in return for meals there and
lodging at the Bachelors' Inn, First
and Monroe streets, which is owned
by Mr. Collins. Chance also told ot
finding a number of letters from the
mail car in the brush one mile north
of Maricopa. "
The next witnesss was Mrs. Louise
Gillespie, housekeeper at Bachelors
Inn. who declared that Gardner, un
der the name of "Nelson," had reg
istered there several times, beginning
with Oct. 22. He registered again on
Nov. 1, when he stayed one night
onlv. annearinor again on Nov. 4. the
lav after the Maricopa robbery.
From this date until Nov. 15, the date
of his arrest for the attempted rob
bery of the Santa Fe car in Phoenix
he lived at Bachelors' Inn, staying a
week in room 9 and the rest ot the
time In room S. It was in room 9
that Fred A. Weage. the witness said
found the key which Gardner had had
made for an alleged Pullman lock, but
which the Kovernment holds was
really obtained by him to open
Southern Pacific car at Maricopa.
Key Is Found
The next witness was Fred A
Weaee. United States deputy mar
shal, who found the key and who by
his discovery completed what has
been described as the most perfect
circumstantial evidence case ever
prepared in Arizona. He described
searching room 3 with Chance, post
iffice inspector .and J. B. Kelly, spe
c-ial a cent in charge for the Southern
Pacific company, and then figuring
that Gardner had left the key in room
9 after he had changed rooms in order
that the key might be safe. He found
the key. he testified, on a joist in
room 9.
The witness then testified to a con
versation he had with Gardner in th
county jail after the finding of th
key, including how Gardner told him
how to unfasten the chain across tn
end door of a mail car by lifting
eff the hook with a piece of wire, and
Gardners declaration that alter tn
Maricopa robbery he had walked all
the wav from Maricopa to Phoenix
C. E. Collins, proprietor ot isacn
elors' Inn. - testified that he knew
Gardner; that the latter had first be
come known to him tibout Nov. 1, an
that Gardner had showed him a lady
wrist watch afterward, asking for
two meal tickets on it as security
whereupon he was told to give it to
Mrs. Collins, who would take care
him. Collins also identified the key
and then told of a conversation be
tween himself and Gardner in whic
the latter had described his bein
hit on the head in Bisbee during
strike there several years ago.
Tell, of Wrist Watch
Mrs. Collins also identified Card
ner and told how he had come to her
with the watch after his conversatio
with her husband. Jose Lopez, a
Indian, who is a clerk in a store a
Maricopa, then testified that Gard
r.er. early in November, had pur
chased about 33 cents worth ot brca
and butter from him there. He fa
that Gardner was wearing a mus
tache then, which had been shaved
off when he saw him later as a pris
oner in the county jail.

RECOMMENDED IN
TEXT OF PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
The text of President - Harding's '
message to congress follows:
Mr. Speaker and Members . ot the
Congress:
"It is a very gratifying privilege to
come to the congress with the re
public at peace with all the nations
of the world. More, it is equally
gratifying to report that our coun
try isiiot only -free from every Im
pending menace of war, but there are
growing assurances of the perma
nency of the peace which we so deep
ly cherish.
"For approximately ten years no
have dwelt amid menaces of war or
as participants in war activities; and
the inevitable aftermath, with its dis
ordered conditions, has added to the
difficulties of government which ade
quately cannot be appraised except
by those who are in immediate con
tact and know .the responsibilities.
Our tasks would be less difficult if
we had only ourselves to consider,
but so much of the world was in
volved, the disordered conditions are
so well nigh universal, even among
nations not engaged in actual war
fare, that no permanent readjust
ments can be affected without con
sideration of our Inescapable rela
tionship to world affairs in finance
and trade. Indeed, we should be un
worthy of our best traditions if we
were unmindful of social, moral and
political conditions which are not of
direct concern to us but which do
appeal to the human sympathies and
the very becoming interest of. a peo f
pie blest with our national good for
tune. It is not my purpose to bring
to you a program of world restora
tion. In the main, such a program
must be worked out by the nations
most directly concerned. They must
themselves turn to. the heroic reme
dies for the menacing conditions un
der which they are struggling, then
we can help, and we mean to help,
We shall do so unselfishly because
there is compensation in the con
sciousness of assisting, selfishly be
cause the commerce and international
exchanges in trade which marked our
high tide of fortunate advancement
are possible only when the nations
of all continents are restored to
stable order and normal relationship.
"In the main, the contribution of
this republic to restore normalcy in
the world must come through the
initiative of the executive branch of
the government, but the best of in
tentions and most carefully consid
ered purposes would fail utterly If
the sanction and the co-operation or
congress were not cheerfully
corded.
DEPARTMENTAL CO-OPERATION
"I am very sure we shall have no
conflict of opinion about consutu
tional duties or authority. During
the anxieties of war, when necessity
seemed compelling, there were ex
cessive grants of authority and an
extra-ordinary concentration ot pow
crs in the chief executive. The re
jeal of wartime legislation and the
automatic expirations which attend
the peace proclamations have put an
end to thPse emergency excesses, but
I have the wish to go further than
that. I want to Join you in restoring,
in the most cordial way, the spirit
of co-ordination and co-operation.
and that mutuality of confidence and
respect which is necessary in repre
sentative popular government.
'Encroachment upon the functions
of congress or attempted dictation of
its policy are not to be thought of
much less attempted, but there is an
insistent call for harmony of pur
pose and concord of action to speed
the solution of the difficult problems
confronting both the legislative and
executive branches of the govern
ment.
"It is worth while to make allu
sion here to the character of our
government, mindful as one must be
that an address to you is no less
message to all our people for whom
you speak most intimately. Ours is
a nonular government through Politi
cal parties. We divide along political
lines and I would ever have it so.
do not mean that partisan prefer
ences should hinder any public serv
ant in the performance of a con
scious and patriotic official duty,
We saw partisan lines utterly oblit
erated when war imperiled, and our
faith in the republic was riveted
anew. We ought not find these par
tisan lines obstructing the expedi
tious solution of the urgent prob
lems of peace.
PARTY RESPONSIBILITY
"Granting that we are fundament
ally a representative popular gov
ernment, with political parties the
governing agencies, I believe the po
litical party in power should assume
responsibility, determine upon poli
cies In the conference which supple
ments conventions and election cam
paigns, and then strive for achieve
ment through adherence to the ac
cepted policy.
'There js vastly greater security,
immensely more of the national
viewpoint, much larger and prompter
accomplishment where our divisions
are along party lines, in the broad
and loftier sense than to divide geo
graphically, or according to pursuits,
or personal muowing. t or a cen
tury and a third parties have been
charged with responsibility and held
to strict accounting. When they fail,
they are relieved of authority; and
the system has brought us to a na
tional eminence no less than a world
example.
'-Necciiarily legislation is a mat-
ter of compromise. The full Ideal is
seldom attained. In that meeting of
minds necessary to insure results
here must and will be accommoda
tions and compromises, but in the es
timate of convictions and sincere pur
poses tne supreme responsibility to
national interest must not be ignored.
The shield to the high-minded pub
lic servant who adheres to party pol
ity is manifest, but the higher pur
pose is the good of the republic as a
whole.
It would be ungracious to -with
hold acknowledgment of the really
large volume and excellent quality of
work accomplished by the extraordi
nary session of congress which so
recently adjourned. I am not un
mindful of the very difficult tasks
with which you were called to deal.
and no one can ignore the insistent
conditions which, during recent years,
have called for the continued and al
most exclusive attention ot jour
memberships to public work.
TAX REDUCTIONS
It would suggest insincerity If I
expressed complete accord with every
expression recorded In your roll calls,
but we are all agreed about the dif
ficulties and the inevitable divergence
of opinion in seeking the reduction,
amelioration and readjustment of the
burdens of taxation. Later on, when
other problems are solved, I shall
make some recommendations about
renewed consideration of our tax
programs, but for the immediate time
before us, we must be content with
the billion dollar reduction in the tax
draft upon the people and diminished
Irritations, banished uncertainty and
Improved methods or collection. By
Lour sustainment ot the rigid econ
omies already inaugurated, with
hoped for extension of these econ
omles and added efficiencies in ad
ministration. I believe further re
ductions may be enacted and hinder
ing imrdens abolished.
BUDGET SYSTEM
"In these urgent economics we shall
be immensely assisted by the budget
system for which you made'provisions
in the extraordinary session. i ne
first budget is before you. Its prep- !
aration is a signal achievement and
ythe perfection of the system, a thing
impossible in tne rew monins avail
able for its initial trial, will maris its
enactment as the beginning of the
greatest reformation in governmental
practices since the beginning ot me
republic.
FUNDING FOREIGN DEBTS
There is pending a grant of au
thority to the authoritative branch of
the government for the lunaing ana
settlement of our vast foreign loans
growing out of our grant of war
crfdits. With the hands of the ex
ecutive branch held impotent to deal
with these debts, we are hindering
urgent readjustment among our debt
ors and accomplishing nothing for
ourselves. I think it is fair for the
congress to assume thai the executive
branch of the government wouia
adopt no major policy in dealing with
these matters, which would conflict
with the purpose of congress in au
thorizing the loans, certainly not
without asking congressional ap
proval, but there are minor problems
Incident to prudent loan transactions
and the safeguarding of our interests
which can not even be attempted
without tills authorization. It will be
helpful to ourselves, and It will im
prove conditions among our debtors,
if funding and the settlement of de
faulted interest may le negotiated.
ABROGATION OF TREATIES
'The previous congress, deeply con
cerned in behalf of our merchant ma
rine, in 1920 enacted the existing
shipping law. designed for the tip
building of the American merchant
marine. Among other things we pro
vided, to encourage our shipping on
the world's seas, your executive was
directed to give notice of the termi
nation of all existing commercial
treaties in order to admit of reduced
duties on imports carried in Ameri
can bottoms. During the life of the
act no executive has complied with
this order of the congress. When the
present administration came into
responsibility it began an early in
quiry into the failure to execute the

his address frequently, especially
from house members when he dis

especial volume- when he advanced
his plan for a tribunal to weigh dis

declared labor organizations should
not be permitted to "exact unfair
terms of employment or subject the
public to actual distress."

retary Hoover, as head of the Ameri
can relief administration, authoriz
ing donation to the administration of
surplus medical and other stores of

Legislation to meet the president's
recommendations for a flexible tariff
was also proposed Immediately by
Senator Smoot, Republican of Utah.
He introduced amendments to the
tariff bill which would authorize the
president, by proclamation to reduce
or increase tariff rates based on
American valuation. Hearings on the
tariff bill will be resumed tomorrow

The president also emphasized need
for agricultural relief. He urged im
proved methods of distribution and
