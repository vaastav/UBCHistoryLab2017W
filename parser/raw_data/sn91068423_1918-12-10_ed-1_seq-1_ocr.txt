The yards now have enough accu

Thursday.
Two representatives of the civil
service were here this week, presu
mably investigating with a view to
. recommending as to the postmaster
j of Hickory, the appointment of whom
I is expected to be sent to the senate
a. most any time. It the civil ser
vice men have been about the post
office, they have not indicated the
fact, but they have seen various
Hickory citizens and questioned them
in regard to Postmaster Bagby and
the candidates for the position.
If possession is ninetenths of the
law, and If possession and doing good
work amounts to anything, Mr. Bag
by has at least 99 per cent chance of
being the successful man. It is do
ing no injustice to the other aspir
ants to say that Mr. Bagby has ris
en to every occasion and his conduct
of the campaign for War Savings
Stamps admittedly has won the praise
of those who have helped or watched,
for that matter.
When the temporary appointment
was made along in the spring there
were three other candidates Mr.
Frank P. Abernethy, since promoted
to chief clerk in the railway mail of
fice at Greensboro. Mr. P. G. Kiser,
who has been placed in charge of the
Charlotte office of the internal reve
nue collector, and Mr. W,. X. Reid.
who has a position with the American
Trust Company in Charlotte. !
Assuming that Mr. Bagby has made
good and ,his friends s,ay he has
made good with emphases his
chances of being nominated and con
firmed should be a safe bet.

international law with whom he dis
cussed his personal position, accord
ing to an Amsterdam dispatcli to
the Express. The experts arrived
and left Amerongen in a rather
mysterious manner.
It is understood, according to the

autobiography and a history of his
reign. iHe will explain his attitude
before and jdmfing jthe war, it is

Amerongen, Holland, Saturday, Dec.
7 Since his formal adbication, Wil
liam Hohenzollern has shed his uni-
I form and appears regularly in civil
ian clothes, as do the members of
his suite. The enturage has been
reduced in number to 18 for himself
and the former empress.
The family life of the erstwhile
royal pair appears to flow as evenly
as that of any middle-aged couple
who might be enjoying a quiet coun
try holiday. They dlned with their
hosts, Count Benedict, being often
joined at the meal by the count's
brother, a nobleman, residing in a
neighboring castle, and spend much
of their time together strolling
through the castle grounds.
Yesterday Herr Hohenzollern went
into the country while his wife ex
plored the neighboring market town
of Wageningen. Today the ex
emperor visited Zulestein, Zentic fam
ily property where he indulged in
tree cutting for the sake of exercise.
ISNT jT THE TRUTH?
While the occasion may have called
for the white flag, the manner in
which the German navy celebrated
its "Tag" would seem to prove that
those persons were right who all the
t'me insisted that tne Hun's true na
