plored the wild speculation and fl
nancial piracy which has brought
the present crisis upon the country
and In the same breath he tells ot
the wondrous prosperity of the peo

nation which should have guaran
teed a continuation of the satlsfac
tory conditions of a few months ago
had not a few criminal financiers
manipulated the currency In such
manner as to cause an unfounded
and unjustifiable panic.
The opening subject of the presl
dent's message Is the money panic
and the result of dishonest specula
tion, and Is as follows:
TIhs President's Message.
No nation has greater resources
than ours, and I think It can be
truthfully said that the citizens of
no nation possess greater energy and
Industrial ability. In no nation afe
the fundamental business conditions
sounder than in ours at this very
moment, and it i foolish, when auch
Is the case, for people to hoard mon
ey Instead of keeping It In sound
banks; for It is such hoarding that
Is the Immediate occasion of money
stringency.
Moreover, as a rule, the business
of our people Is conducted with
honesty and probity, and this ap
plies alike to farms and factories, to
railroads and banks, to all our le
gltimute commercial enterprises.
In any large body of men, how
ever, mere are certain to be some
who are dishonest, and If the con
dltlons are such that these men pros
per or commit their misdeeds with
impunity, their example is a very
evil thing for the community
Where these men are business men
of great sagacity and of tempera
vnent, both unscrupulous and reck
less, and where the conditions are
such that they act without super
vision or control and at first without
effective check from public opln
ion. they delude many Innocent peo
pie Into making Investments or em
barking In kinds of business that are
leally unsound'.
w nen tne misdeeds of these suc
cessfully dishonest men are discov
ered, suffering comes not only upon
tem. but upon the Innocent men
whom they have misled. It Is a
painful awakening, whenever it oc
curs; and, naturally, when It does
occur those who suffer are apt to
forget that the longer it was defer
red the more painful It would be,
In the effort to punish the guilty
it is notn wise and proper to en
deavor so far as possible to niln
mlze tVte distress of those who have
bppn mlrled by the guilty.
Vet It Is not possible to refrain
because of such distress from striv
ing to put nn end to the misdeeds
that are the ultimate causes of the
suffering, and, as a means to this
end, where possible to punish those
responsible for them. There may be
honest d'fferences of opinion as to
ninny governmental policies; but
surely there can be no such differ
ences as to the need of unflinching
preserverance in the war against
successful dishonesty.

ARGUMENTS TO OUST HILL.
HOLIDAYS DEPEND ON EASTERN SITUATION
Judge S. A. Lowell returned home
last evening from Portland where he
attended the meeting called by the
commercial bodies of the state to
discuss the proposition of asking the
governor to 'call a special session of
the legislature. After debating the
subject at length the meeting de
cided not to make the request.
"When the meeting convened the
sentiment was generally favorable to
asking for a special session," said
Judge Lowell this morning. "But af
ter the matter had been d'seussed
thoroughly the meeting was almost
unanimously against the Idea and
when the committee went out to
draw the resolutions It was Instruct
ed to oppose the plan. The dele
gates present from the rural coun
ties were nil opposed to the special
session Idea, though previous to the
meeting the sentiment in Portland
was very favorable to tho Idea."
Accord:ng to Judge Lowell, it is
possible that the holidays may be
continued until the first of the year,
though such may not be necessary.
He says the matter is all dependent
upon when the eastern situation be
comes such that western banks may
draw their bnlances when needed.
However, the general banking situa
tion as far as Oregon alone Is con
cerned, he says was never better.
In the opinion of Judge Lowell the
holiday period has been entirely too
scrupulously observed by officials
and had such business been transact
ed as is possible much less hardship
would have been worked. 1
Impression Prevails That Judge Wol-
verton Will Order a New Keeelv
er.
Portland, Dec. 8. Arguments be
fore Judge Wolverton on the part
of the depositors' association, the
American Surety company and the
state of Oregon to oust George X,
Hill from the receivership of the
Title Guarantee & Trust Co., recent
ly suspended, were heard today.
Ex-United States Senator Simon
appeared fer the bank, while Covey
of attorneys, represented the allied
complainants.
In the argument Simon caused a
sensation by asserting that "the act
of the bank officials sin turning ovci
to the state, securities just prior to
the closing was most reprehensible
and certainly illegal."
It is the impression here that
Wolverton will order a new receiver.
The bank officials, however, be
lieve that Hill will be retained and
charge that tho fight against Hill
originated in a fight over business In
the suspended concern.
To Decide Salaries of Employes.
Winnipeg, Dec. 3. The arb;tation
board, acting under the Lemleux act.
went Into session today to decide the
salaries of 2000 employes of the
Canadian Pacific between the lakes
and the Pacific coast.
KEPT MONEY AT HOME.
Casteels Kept Several Thousand Dol--
lars In House.
Salem, Dec. 3. Fear of the stabil
ity of banks was the indirect but
fundamental cause of the death of
Mrs. Casteel, Martha, Casteel, Paul;
Casteel and Foreman Montgomery.
lightened by the bank collapses
in the recent panic, they kept sever
al thousand dollars In the house with
the intention of soon purchasing a
farm near here.
This fact became current gossip
among the country side, both here
and at the former home near Myrtle
Creek.
The officers are convinced that
some person knowing of the hidden
money committed the terrible mur
ders and secured the gold.
The Casteel family originally came
to Oregon from Oklahoma and while
in this state raised strawberries and
frluts, and did very well.
Montgomery had been in the fam
ily for 20 years. Miss Martha Cas
teel was to have been married In De
cember to Phil D. Rice of Myrtle
Creek.
Band Lender Here.
Sergeant Adams, leader of the Wal
la Walla Cavalry band, which play
ed here on the Fourth of July, came
over from Walla Walla last evening
to consult with local bandsmen re
garding the directorship of the band
here. He has secured his release
from the service and Is now seeking
a position as band director. It is
probable that a meeting of the Pen
dleton players will be held soon to
discuss the matter.
