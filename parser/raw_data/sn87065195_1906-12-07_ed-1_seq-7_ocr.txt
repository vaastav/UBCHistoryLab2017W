New and Important
Subjects.

He Believes Such Laws Would Curb
Growth of Fortunes to Dan
gerous Proportions.
His Views on Negro Question—Aeke
for Currency Reform, and Shipping
Bill—Would Make Citizens of Jape
—Many Other Important Subjects
Discussed.
Washington, Dec. 8.—The notable fea
tures of President Roosevelt's annual
message to congress are his appeal for
the enactment into law of several billB
Introduced into congress last winter and
spring; his views on the negro problem;
the scoring he gives those whom he
terms "preachers of discontent;" the
stand he takes for the control of corpor
ations by the federal government under
the interstate commerce clause of the
constitution, and his recommendation for
an inheritance and income tax law.
Many other subjects common to mes
sages of the chief executive are touched
upon, but the ones mentioned are by
far of the greatest importance. He es
pecially urges the passage of the bill
prohibiting corporations from contribut
ing to campaign funds, and also that one
which would give the government
right of appeal in criminal cases,
this he says:
"Another bill which has Just past one
house of the congress and which is ur
gently necessary
law is that conferring upon the govern
ment the right of appeal in criminal
cases on questions of law. This right
exists in many of the states; it exists in
the District of Columbia by act of the
congress. It is of course not proposed
that in any case a verdict for the de
fendant on the merits should be set
aside. Recently in one district where
the government had indicted certain per
sons for conspiracy in connection with
rebates, the court sustained the defend
ant's demurrer; while in another Juris
diction an indictment for conspiracy to
obtain rebates has been sustained by
the court, convictions obtained under It,
and two defendants sentenced to impris
onment The two cases referred to may
not be in real conflict with each other,

a conflict, when
it oecurs, to be solved by an appeal to
a higher court; and the wheels of justice
are blocked without any real decision ef
the question. I can not too strongly
urge the passage of the bill in question.
A failure to pass will result in seriously
hampering the government in its effort
to obtain justice, especially against
wealthy Individuals or corporations who
do wrong; and may also prevent ths
government from obtaining justice for
wageworkers who are not themselves
able effectively to contest a case where
the judgment of an inferior court has
been against them. I have specifically
in view a recent decision by a district
judge leaving railway employees with
out remedy for violation of a certain so
called labor statute. It seems an absurd
ity to permit a single district judge,
against what may be the judgment of
the immense majority of his colleagues
on the bench, to declare a law solemnly
enacted by the congress to be "uncon
stitutional," and then to deny to the
government the right to have the su
S reme court definitely decide the ques
on."
Injunction*.
On the subject of the abolition of In
junctions In labor disputes, he says;
"In my last message I suggested the en
actment of a law in connection with the
Issuance of Injunctions, attention hav
ing been sharply drawn to the matter
by the demand that the right of apply
ing injunctions in labor cases should be
wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful
whether a law abolishing altogether the
use of injunctions in such cases would
starid the test of the courts; In which
case of course the legislation would be
Ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would
be wrong altogether te prohibit the use
of injunctions. It is criminal to permit
sympathy with criminals to weaken our
hands in upholding the law; and if men
seek to destroy lire or property by mob
violence there should be no impairment
of the power of the courts to deal with
them in the most summary and effective
way possible. But so far as possible the
abuse of the power- should .be provided
against by some such law aa I advocated
last year.
The Negro Problem.
! The negro problem is given Considera
ble attention, after calling attention to
tb# fact that no section of toe country
Is free from faults, and that no section
has occasion to jeer at the shortcomings
of any other section, he turns to tbs sub
ject of lynchtags, and especially as ap
plied to the negro of toe south. He says
the greatest existing cause for mob law
Is toe perpetration .by the blacke of the
crlra* of rape, a crime which he, term#
even worse than murder. He quotes the
admonitions to the white people spoken
by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some years
ago, and by Gov. Jelks, of Alabama, re
cently. and then Says:
"Every colored man should realise
that the worst enemy of hi* r aoe I* the
negro criminal, and above all the ne
gro criminal who commits the dread
ful crime of rape; and It should
In the highest degree an, offense
against toe whole country, and against
the colored race In particular, to r a
oolored man to fall to help the officers
of the law In hunting down with all
possible earnestness and seal every
suoh infamous offender. Moreover, in
my Judgment, the crime of rape should
always be punished with death, as Is
the case with murder; assault with —
tent to commit rape should be made a
capital crime, at least in the discretion
of the court*,' and provision should be
ade by which the punishment may
.Jflow immediately upon the heels of
the offense; while the trial should be
so conducted that the victim need not
b« wantonly shamed while giving tes
timony. and that the least possible
publieuy shall be given to the details*
P The members Of the White race on

can take part in the torture of a hu
man being without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered.
Every lynching means just so much
moral deterioration in all the children
who have any knowledge of it, and
therefore just so much additional
trouble for the next generation of
Americans.
"Let Justice be both sure and swift;
but let it be justice under tile law,
and not the wild and crooked savagery
of a mob. '
Capital and Labor.
On the subject of capital and labor
the president takes the agitators of class
hatred to task and says "to preach
hatred to the rich man, as such, . . .
to seek to mislead and inflame to mad
ness honest men whose lives ara hard
and who have not the kind of mental
training which will permit them to ap
preciate the danger in the doctrines
preached is to commit a crime against
the body politic and to be false to every
worthy principle and tradition of Amer
ican national life." Continuing on this
subject he says:
"The plain people who think—the
mechanics, farmers, merchants, work
ers with head or hand, the men to
whom American traditions are dear,
who love their country and try to act
decently by their neighbors, owe it to
themselves to remember that the most
damaging blow that can be given pop
ular government is to elect an
worthy and sinister agitator on a
platform sif violence and hypocrisy.
Whenever such an issue is raised in
this country nothing can be gained by
flinching from it, for In such case dem
ocracy is itself on trial, popular self
government under republican forms is
itself on trial. The triumph of the
mob Is just as evil a thing as the tri
umph of the plutocracy, and to have
escaped one danger avails nothing
whatever if we sucuumb to the other.
In the end the honest man,whether rich
or poor, who earns his own living and
Justly by his fellows,
as much to fear from the JnBlncere
and unworthy demagog, promising
much and performing nothing, or else
performing nothing but evil, who
would set on the mob to plunder the
rich, as from the crafty corruptionist,
who, for his own ends, would permit
people
the very wealthy. If we ever let this
government fall into the hands of men
of either of these two classes, we shall
show ourselves false to America's past.
Moreover, the demagog and corrup
tionist often work hand in hand. There
are at this moment wealthy reaction
aries of such obtuse morality that they
regard the public servant who prose
cutes them when they violate the law,
or who seeks to make them bear their
proper share of the publio burdens, as
being even more objectionable than
the violent agitator who hounds on
the mob to plunder the rich. There is
nothing to choose between such a re
actionary and such an agitator; funda
mentally they are alike In their selfish
disregard of the rights of others; and
It is natural that they should join in
opposition to any movement of which
the aim Is fearlessly to do exact and
even justice to all."

Railroad Employees* Hours.
; of the bill lim
g the number of hours of
employment of railroad employes, and
classes the measure as a very moderate
one. He says the aim of all should be
to steadily reduce the number of hours
of labor, with as a goal the general In
troduction of an eight-hour day, but In
sists that on the Isthmus of Panama, the
conditions are so different from what
they are here that the introduction of an
eight-hour day on the canal would be
absurd, and continues, "just about as ab
surd as it is, so far as the isthmus Is
concerned, where white labor cannot be
employed, to bother as to whether the
work is done by alien black men or alien
yellow men.
He urges the enactment of a drastic
child labor law for the District of Co
lumbia and the territories, and a federal
investigation of the subject of child and
female labor throughout the country.
He reviews the work of the commission
appointed to Investigate labor conditions
in the coal fields of Pennsylvania ir. 1902,
and refers to the wish of the commission
"that the state and federal governments
should provide the machinery for what
may be called the compulsory Investiga
tion of controversies between employers
and employes when they arise."
He asks for the
itin
«r
Control of Corporation*.
A considerable portion of the measage
is devoted to the subject of federal con
trol of corporations In what he refers to
the passage at the last session of the
rate, meat Inspection and food laws, and
says that all of these have already justi
fied their enactment, but recommends
the amendment of the meat inspection
law so as to put dates on the labelS~_of
meat
cost
products, and also to place the
of inspection on the packers rather
than on the government. Continuing
this subject of the control of corporations
by the federal government he says:
"It cannot too often be repeated that
perlence has conclusively shown the im
possibility of securing by the actions of
nearly half a hundred different state
legislatures anything but ineffective
chaos in the way of dealing with the
great corporations which do not operate
exclusively within ths limits of any one
state. In some method, whether by a
national license law or in other fashion,
must exercise, and that at an early
date, a far more complete control than
at present over these great corpora
tions—a control that will among ether
things prevent the evils of excessive
overcapitalization, and that will compel
the disclosures by each big corporation
of ita stockholders and of Its properties
and business, whether owned directly or
thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations.
This will tend to put a stop to the secur
ing of inordinate profits by, favored
Individuals at the expense whether of
general public, the stoekholdeni, or
_wageworkers. Our effort .should be
not so much to prevent consolidation as
such, but so to supervise and control it
as to see that it results la no harpn to
the people. The reactionary Or ultracon
servative apologists for tne misuse of
wealth assail tee effort to secure such,
control as a step toward socialism. As a
matter of fact it Is these reactionaries
and ultraconservatives who are
selves most potent in increasing so
tic feeling. One of the most el
methods of averting ths consequen
a dangerous affitauon, which Is l
cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent,
of evil aa to which toe. agitation Is well
founded. The best way to avert the very
undesirable move for the governmSntal
ownership of railways is to secure by
the government on behalf ef the people
as a whole such adequate control and
regulation of too *f«at Interstate com
mon carriers as wni do away with the
evils which give rise to ths agitation
against them. Bo the* proper antidote
to the dangerous and wicked agitation
against the men of wealth as such Is to
secure by proper legislation and execu
tive action the abolition of the, grave
abuses which actually do obtain in con
nection with the business use of. wealth
under our present system—or rather no
system—of failure to exercise any ade
quate control at all Some persons speak
as if the exercise of suoh ^governmental
Control would do away with too freedom
of individual initiative and dwarf -*ndl r
vidual effort. This Is not a fact,
would be a veritable calamity, to fall
put a premium upon individual Initiative,
Individual capacity and effort: upon
energy, character and foresight which

individual. But as a,matter of fact
deadening and degrading effect of pure
socialism, and especially of Its extro

inheritance and Incoma Tax.
It was expected that the president
would refer In aome way to bis belief
In the necessity for ths curbing of enor
mous fortunes, and he has done so by
recommending legislation
come and an Inheritance
lieves the government should impose a
graduated inheritance tax, and, if possi
ble, a graduated Income tax. He says:
"I am well aware that such a subject
as this needs long and careful study in
order that the people may become famil
iar with what is proposed to be done,
may clearly see the necessity of proceed
ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and
may make up their minds just how far
they are wining to go in the matter;
while only trained legislators can work
out the project in necessary detail. But
I feel that in the near future our natlon
egtslators should enact a law provid
er a graduated inheritance tax by
which a steadily increasing rate of duty
should bo put upon all moneys or other
valuables coming br gift, bequest, or
deviso to any individual or corporation.
It may bo well to make the tax heavy
in proportion as the individual benefited
is remote of kin. In any event, in my
judgment the pro rata of the tax should
increase very heavily with the Increase
of the amount left to any one individual
after a certain point has been reached.
It is most desirable to encourage thrift
and ambition, and a potent source of
thrift and ambition is the desire on the
part of the breadwinner to leave his chil
dren well off. This object can be attained
by making the tax very small on moder
ate amounts of property left; because
the prime object should be to put a con
stantly increasing burden on tho Inher
itance of those swollen fortunes which
It is certainly of no benefit to this coun
try to perpetuate. ..
There can be no question of the eth
ical propriety of the government thus de
termining the conditions upon which any
gift or inheritance should be received.
Exactly how far the inheritance tax
would, as an incident, have the effect of
limiting the transmission by devise or
gift of the enormous fortunes In question
It Is not necessary at present to discuss.
It is wise that progress in this direction
should ba gradual. At first a permanent
national Inheritance tax, while It might
be more substantial than any such tax
has hitherto been, need not approximate,
either in amount or in the extent of the
increase by graduation, to what such a
tax should ultimately
Inheritance Tax Constitutional.
"This species of tax has again arid again
been imposed, altho only temporarily, by
the national government. It was first
imposed by the act of July 6, 1797, when
the makers of the Constitution were
alive and at the head" of affairs. It was
a graduated tax; tho small in amount,
the rate was increased with the amount
left to any individual, exceptions being
made in the case of certain close kin. A
similar tax was again imposed by the
act of July 1. 1862; a minimum sum or
$1,000 in personal property being excepted
from taxation, the tax then becoming
progressive according to tho remoteness
of kin. The war-revenue act of June 13,
1898, provided for an Inheritance tax on
any sum exceeding the value of $10,000,
the rate of tax increasing both in accord
ance with the amounts left and in ac
cordance with the legatee's remoteness
of kin. The supreme court has held that
the succession tax imposed at the time
of the civil war was not a direct tax but
an Impose of excise which was both con
stitutional and valid. More recently the
court. In an opinion delivered by Mr.
Justice White, which contained an ex

of the powers of the congress to Impose
death duties, sustained the constitution

Is Income Tax Constitutional?
"In Its incidents, and apart from the
main purpose of raising revenue, an
Income tax stands on an entirely differ
ent footing from an inheritance tax, be
cause It Involves no question of the per
petuation of fortunes swollen to an un
healthy size. The question is in its
essence a question of the proper adjust
ment of burdens to benefits. As the
law now stands it is undoubtedly diffi
cult to devise a national Income tax
which shall be constitutional. But
whether it is absolutely impossible'Is an
other question; and if possible it is most
certainly desirable. The first purely In
come tax law was past by the congress
In 1861, but the most Important law deal
ing with the subject was that of 1894.
This the court held to be unconstitu
tional.
"The question is undoubtedly very In
tricate, delicate, and troublesome. The
decision of the court was only reached
by one majority. It is the law of the
land, and, of course, Is excepted as suoh
and loyally obeyed by all good citizens.
Nevertheless, the hesitation evidently
felt by tho court as a whole in coming
to A conclusion, when considered to

tho subject, may perhaps Indicate the
possibility of devising a constitutional
income-tax law which shall substan

The difficulty of amending the con

Every effort should be made in dealing
with this subject, as with the subject

points to the good that is being done by

"Several factors must cooperate in the

He must have the chance to .be educated

Currency Reform.
Amendments to the present currency
laws are asked for, and after showing
that present laws arc inadequate because
of the wide fluctuation of interest
charges, he says:
"The mere statement of these facts
shows that our present system is seri
ously defective. There is need of a
change. Unfortunately, however, many
of the proposed changes must be rUlea
from consideration because they are
complicated, are not easy of compre
hension, and tend to disturb existing
rights and interests. We must also
rule out any plan which would ma
terially impair the value of the United
States two per cent, bonds now pledged
to secure circulation, the issue of
which was made under conditions pe
culiarly creditable to the treasury. I
do not press any special plan. Various
plans have recently been proposed by
expert committees of bankers. Among
the plans which are possibly feasible
and which Certainly should receive
your consideration is that repeatedly
brought to your attention by the pres
ent secretary of the treasury, the es
sential features of which have been
approved by many prominent bankers
and business men. According to this
plan national banks should be per
mitted to issue a specified proportion
of their capital in notes or a given
kind, the.issue to be taxed at so high
a rate as to drive the notes back when
not wanted In legitimate trade. This
plan would not permit the issuo of
currency to give banks additional
profits, but to meet the emergency pre
sented by times of stringency.
He again asks for free trade with this

THOSE HAPPY DAYS
WRITER RECALLS THE DELIGHTS
OF HIS BOYHOOD.
When Life Wee, More Or Lees, One
Continual Round of Joy—Particu
lar Pleasure In Teaching
the Calf to Drink.
Yes, sir! Boyhood's happy days, of
course. We know about that We
haven't forgotten the joy of sleeping
In an unfinished loft in winter, when
our breath froze to the bedding and
we had to thaw out with a hot flatiron
every morning.
Morning, too! We got up at foui a.
m., pitch dark, 84 below zero, and
still going down! We had to get up,
hustle out and feed and milk the low
ing herd, curry the rear elevation of
the family mule, wake the rooster up
to crow, thaw out the pump, chop four
cords of wood and shovel away the
snow to make room for the sun to
rise!
Sometimes we went to school In the
winter—not often. Only on the days
when it was too cold and stormy to
go outdoors. Then we sat on a nice,
cool board about 50 feet away from
the stove and gagly blew at our fin
gers and picked Icicles from oar hair.
And, as we sat, we listened to a wood
en image with a teacher's license as
he handed us misinformation and per
manently crippled our intellects.
Then came the merry springtime!
Rise at 2:30 a. m. More lowing herd!
The herd lowing owing to the supply
of fodder being low. Then the hired
man, who had hibernated In the for
est, came forth seeking whom he
might make happy with his presence.
And we, being in need of extra joy,
were allowed to sleep with this wool
ly hireling, who snored like th€> boom
of the sad sea waves. He was a good
fellow, this hired man. He taught us
to chew tobacco and swear. -These
gentle pastimes procured us more vlo
lerft lickings than any other joy In our
whole young life.
No memory Is more loaded with joy
germs than the spring crop-working.
Can we ever forget the plowing? How
we held the plow when we had to
reach up with a pike pole to get the
handles; how we drove the old plug
team, with the lines around our. neck;
how, when the clevis broke, the mares
walked away with our frail body drag
ging behind by the ears? When dark
ness came we stabled the plugs and
went forth to milk the brindle heifer.
The heifer kicked us across the barn
floor and an old oow obligingly kicked
us back again. Then, when the milk
ing was over, what fun to turn in and
teach a fool calf to drink! This act
ing as dry nurse to a bandy-legged
calf was one of the most unmixed joys
of all. We tied the calf short, set the
backet in front of him, got astraddle
of his neck, stuck two fingers In his
mouth, and with the other hand
flammed his head Into the pail. And
all the time we were emptying out
abuse on calves in general and this
lop-eared idiot in particular. This
went on until dad came in and with
loving patience horsewhipped us all
about the place.
Then, hrhen we had carried in the
wood, brought 40 gallons of water
From the spring and eaten about eight
pounds of solid food, we went Joyfully
upstairs—and came down again imme
diately to breakfast.
We often dream and wake to weep
for the days gone by when the hay
was ripe. We recall the old swamp
that always had to be cut by hand.
We recall little stones that we rasped
die edge of our blades on. We recall
the pretty snakes ire stepped on with
our bare feet We remember It all
with solemn gladness.
Well, well! How It all comes back
bo us!—Chicago Daily News,

A West Philadelphia youth was be
ipg taught the festive game of pokefr
the other night, and after the relative •
value of pairs, threes, flushes and
straights bad been explained to. him
play was started. After half an hour
or so he surprised the others in the
game by asking:. ''What is it when
all the cards are of the samp color?"
"A fidsK," was the reply. "Then Til
bet six dollars," and, euiting the action
to his words, he threw that amount
into the pot. The others, frightened
by the play, "wisely" laid down two
pairs and threes, which were held
against the novice, and he scooped in
the pot, laying' face up on the table
three hearts and two diamonds. Dis
may and further explanations from
his instructors naturally followed.—
