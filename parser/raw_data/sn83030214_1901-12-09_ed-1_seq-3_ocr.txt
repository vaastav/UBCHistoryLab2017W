TO OPPOSE CANAL TREATY.
;rFOET? TO UNITE DEMOCRATIC SEN
ATORS—BAILEY SAYS IT IS A ONE
SIDED BARGAIN IN FAVOR
OF ENGLAND.
[BY TEILEGBAPH TO tee TRIBtTXZ.]
Washington. Dec. 6. — Efforts are being made
to-night to hold to-morrow the first Senate
Democratic caucus of the session. One of the
2!aln objects of the caucus is to align the minor
ity solidly against ratification of the new Hay-
Pa uncef ore Canal Treaty, which will be re
ported favorably to the Senate the first thing to
morrow by the Committee on Foreign Relations.
•VThile it is a virtually foregone conclusion that
the attempt thus to array the minority as a
whole against the treaty will fail, still it is cer
tain that enough opposition will be developed to
prevent Immediate ratification, as nearly every
Senator opposed to it will insist upon his right
to debate the question thoroughly.
However, so many of the minority already
liave expressed themselves as favorable to rati
fying the convention without attempting to
BBCnd any of its features that the opposition.
realizing their task is a hopeless one, probably
-will be content merely to state their objections.
and will net, therefore, undertake to force ac
ceptance or their views by resorting to the old
and familiar filibustering tactics. Besides, the
entire discussion will be carried on in executive
session, so that the usual obstructive means
cannot be resorted to with any hope of success.
It is known positively that Senator Morgan, of
Alabama, and his colleague. Senator Pettus.
would refuse to be bound by caucus instructions
:o fight ratification, and there is good reason to
relieve, that both Senators Heitfeld and Dubois.
of Idaho, would also refuse to engage in any
effort to force amendments to the treaty or de
lay its ratification longer than some of their col
leagues may desire to discuss its salient feat
ures.
bl pcir.t o* fact. Messrs. Heitfeld and Dubois
sr<? i-bout as scrongly committed to the present
convention as are Messrs. Morgan and Pettus.
Herce. even if every other member of the minor
ity should vote against ratifying the treaty on
grounds of principle or party expediency, and
the fifty-five Republican Senators support the
measure, as it is understood they will do, there
will be nc possibility of defeating- it. There is
nc> longer any doubt, however, as to the firm and
immovable attitude of the Texas Senators. Both
jf^ccr? <~"ulberson and Bailey will do all they
car. in the caucus and in the executive session of
the Senate to force amendments or outright de
feat. Senator Bailey to-day said that he was
ur.hesitatir.gly ready to declare his position- and
yave his reasons. He said:
I shall never consent to the construction of an ]
isthmian canal until we can build and manage
that waterway as we see fit, ■ considering the
wishes of no other nation except the countries
through whose territory the canal will run. I
regard the so-called new treaty every whit as
objectionable as the old one, which was amended
by the Senate after it left the hands of Secre
tary Kay and Lord Pauncefote until it provided
for the construction of a strictly American canal. :
The new treaty takes Great Britain into partner- ;
ship with us. and that is something the Ameri
can people will not stand. It is worded a little
mere artfully Than the original Hay-Pauncefote
convention,. which the Senate knocked all out of
shape, but otherwise there is absolutely no dif
ference between the two efforts to bind us for
ever in a compact with England in the control
of this stupendous enterprise.
I am tempted to say that Mr. Hay or some
body is trying to trick the Senate and the Amer
ican people, but that probably is too harsh a
word to use until we get a fuller history of the
making of the new convention. I want to re
peat that. s<vfar as I am concerned, the treaty
shall not be ratified until It is amended to suit
the wishes and purposes of the United States.
If we construct the canal under the terms now
laid down it will not be an American canal,
though built with our money and having- its
neutrality guaranteed solely by us.r If that is - i
"not a one sided bargain in favor of England,
then I must confess that I do not know what a .
one sided bargain is. . " .
Hence I shall insist with all the earnestness
and vigor at my command that the treaty be so
amended as to confer upon us the right to fortify
the canal if we desire to fortify it at any time, ■
and also that every vestige of the old Clayton-
Bulwer Treaty be wiped out. The treaty we
are now considering is essentially as bad as the
Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, plus the added danger ,
of our forever getting bound up in an obnoxious
and repellant partnership with Great Britain in
a work of world-wide scope and permanent
character. The American people have made up :
their minds to have an isthmian canal,- and it
locks very much as if somebody was determined
to take advantage of this for the aggrandize
ment and glory of England instead of the United j
States.
Senator Cullom said to-night that an effort
weuld be made after the treaty was reported to
the Senate to-morrow to adopt a rule calling
I - i Baal vote on It at 3 o'clock Friday after-

SENATE TO TAKE UP NEW HAY-PA
FOTE TREATY TO-DAY—PHILIP
PINE TARIFF IN THE HOUSE.
<By The Associated Press.')
"Washington, Dec. S. — The only measure of im
portance which the Senate has on its calendar
tor the present week is the new Hay-Paunce-
Jots Treaty, making provision for the abrogation
* tie Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, and opening the
■*"«y for the unobstructed construction of an
isthmian canal by the United States. Acting
for the Committee on Foreign Relations. Senator
Lodge -will ask the Senate to go into executive
session to-morrow for the consideration of the
treaty, and in each day thereafter until the con
tention is disposed of.
It car. be said that at this time the prospect
* very strong that the treaty will be ratified.
■■I • row looks as if this result would be se
•*ed after comparatively little delay. There
■*iU b» some debate, and some features of the
*«cuinent will be criticised as undesirable, but
there :? no probability of captious opposition.
-!*icism will be aiong the ilnes indicated
fey Senators Money and Bacon m the Committee
r- y- r^: zr . Relations at its meeting on Friday
last.
The principal authors of the criticism of the
treaty are Southern Senators, who are. gener
ally, very anxious for the construction of the

tied up until action can be secured on the
Treaty, and they are. on this account, less liable

HOPEFUL VIEW
The hopeful view consump
tives take of their own cases is
strongly in their favor. Each
year is showing a larger percent
age of cures.
One of the best reasons for
good hope is the record of Scott's
Emulsion as a medicine for con
sumptives. So long as the sys
tem is strong enough to use med
icine of any kind it can use
Scott s Emulsion.
The reason for its helpfulness
in this disease is because of its
long tolerance by the patient;
one does not tire of it as quickly
as other medicines and that is
"fc'here the great benefit comes.

delay action upon the treaty itself. The most
active friends of the treaty now claim that rati
fication will be secured the present week, and the
opinion Is very general that ratification will be
obtained before the Christmas holidays.
Beyond the consideration of the treaty little
business will be undertaken before the holidays.
It is now generally agreed that the question of
reciprocity will go over until January, probably
wlthout so much as being mentioned, and it may
be added that from being for a time the subject
most likely to attract early attention, it has
taken a position among the matters which will
not be vigorously urged. When the reciproctty
treaties do <ome up for consideration, there will
be persistent opposition to the agreement with
France and to that \\ith Great Britain
covering the West Indies. There is not so
much feeling over the conventions with the
South American republics. The present outlook
also Is against any immediate action in the Sen
ate looking to tariff legislation for the Philip
pines, and there are some indications that the
Senate will wait upon the House of Representa
tives in this matter. Probably the Chinese ex
clusion action wiil be reported from committee
in course of the week.
The nomination of Attorney General Knox
will be reported at the first executive session,
but immediate confirmation probably will be an
tagonized by some Senators.
The House this week probably will pass a
measure to meet the situation created by the
Philippine decision of the Supreme Court last
Monday. T*p to the present time, however, the
Kepublican members of the Ways and Means
Committee have not decided upon the character
of th° measure which will be reported. A dif
ference of opinion exists as to whether there
should be a temporary enactment of the Ding
ley rates on goods entering the United States
from the Philippines, or whether a permanent
scheme of tariff legislation for the islands should
be prepared. It is understood That Mr. Payne,
chairman of the committee and Mr. Dalzell. of
Pennsylvania, favor the latter course. The Re
publican members of the committee will meet
again to-morrow. Of course, if it is decided to
enact a temporary measure, the proceedure will
be exceedingly simple, and it probably can be
passed :n a day If, on the other hand, an entire
■dteme of tariff legislation is to be enacted,
more time will be consumed both in the prepara
tion and passage of the measure.
VR.ETART* AXD THE FT TURE LIFE
KE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN PHILIPPINES.
BECAUSE HE WAS NOT GOING THERE.
[BY TELEIiRAPH TO THE TBIBCNE.]
"Washington, Dec. S — While in Washington last
week Ambassador Choate told a new story of
the late William Maxwell Evarts, who was for
many years his law partner. According to Mr.
Choate. Mr. Evarts for four years before he died
was nrmiy impressed with the belief that he was
liable to pass over to the great beyond at any
moment. So deeply was this thought embedded
in his mind that when his friends were around
him Mr. Evarts talked about nothing except the
great mystery, death, and what was to come
after breath left the body.
■While he was not afra:d to meet it. etill the
famous lawyer yearned constantly for light on
the questions propounded in Hamlet's soliloquy
He toid Mr. Choate and other close frier.ds who
called upon him regularly to cheer him up that,
of course, he believed in a future state . but at th»>
same time he had to acknowledge thnt this be
lief was wholiy based upon hope rather than
actual conviction. "For."' said Mr. Evarts. "no
traveller from that bourne has yet returned to
tell us about it."'
Toward the <md Mr. Evarts concerned himseif
largely with the quesnon as to what sort of a
place Heaven Is, and also what sort of place the
opposite to Heaven is. He felt safe enough that
the all wise Master would not send him to the
other place, as during h:s i'-ng career h* had
never intentionally or consciously done wrong.
But at the same time he was extremely anxious
to know what the mansion in the sky was lik^
and how the myriads there lived.
In the hope one day of diverting Mr Evarts'F
mind from this line of thought. Mr. Choate asked
him what he thought of the Philippines. "Th<»
Philippines?" inquired- Mr. Evarts. "What do
you mean?"
"Why," replied Ch^are. "you know that as a
result of the war with Spain wre have the Philip
pice Island? on our hands, and their acquisition
is furnishing a subject of world-wide discus
sion."
Mr. Evart3 was silent for a moment, and then,
his face brightening, he said: "Yes. I remember
to have heard of the Philippines, <~"hoat<=- ; but I
am not interested in th<-m. as I am sure not to
gn ther<»."
WORK OF UNITED STATE* MINTS.
SUGGESTION EV DIRECTOR THAT THE LIMIT
OF THE STOCK OF SUBSIDIARY
COIN BE INCREASED.
Washington. Dec. 8. — The report of George E.
Roberts, director of the mint, upon the opera
tions of the mint service for the fiscal year
ended June ."f>. 1901, has been completed. The
coinage of the mints in the fiscal year amounted
to 176.999.132 pieces, of the value of $134^40.
781. Of this $99,065 71"> was in gold, $24^96,850
was in silver dollars. $10.96fi.»>48 was in frac
tional silver, and $2,009,568 was in minor coin.
There also were coined at the Philadelphia mint
225.600 gold pieces, of the value of $349,014.
for the government of Costa Rica.
The coinage of silver dollars in the year was
w-holly from the stock of bullion accumulated
under the act of July 14. 1890. The amount of
this bullion en hand at the beginning of the
fiscal year was 53.265.054 standard ounces, and
at the end of the year 02.."»«52.927 standard
ounces. The coinage of this bullion has h»en
accelerated to enable the Treasury to retire the
Treasury notes issued in its purchase, and at
th' 1 same time supply the pressing demand which
has existed throughout the year for the small
denominations of money required in retail trade.
Coinage operations were conducted through
out the year in the mints at Philadelphia. Sin
Francisc« and New-Orleans. The Philadelphia
mint is now in its new quarters, and the old
site, including the structure, will be offered for
sale to the highest bidder on December 19. An
upset price of $2,<XK>,OOO has been placed upon
it. The original cost of the ground to the gov
ernment was 535.540. The cost of the new sire
and structure has been $2,680,000. and the ap
propriation for equipment $440,000. but a con
siderable portion of the latter is yet unexpended.
No pains have been spared to provide this mint
with the best machinery to b<» had. and it is
believed that in methods and equipment it v.-iil
be when completed a model institution of it^
kind.
Th* new mint under construction <tr Denver
has made slow progress in the year, and the
supervising architect finds an additional appro
priation necessary before the final contracts
can be let. The appropriation for site and
building was $500,000 and for equipment $130
(X)0. The new mints at Philadelphia and Den
ver, together with the old ones at San Fran
cisco and New-Orleans, will afford ample facil
ities for this country for many years to nine.
The original deposits of goid ai the mints and
assay offices amounted to $153,101,580, an in
crease of .*19.181.-V-j1 over th^ preceding y t -ar.
Of this 527.906.459 was in foreign coin. 5:7.
rt00.463 of Great^ Britain, nearly all being from
Australia, and 50.420.5»h» of Japan.
The estimated production of gold in the United
States m che calendar y*ar 1900 was of the
value of $TO.rn,ooo, and. notwithstanding the
fact that this country led the world in produc
tion, its imports exceeded its exports by $12.
568.010. The production of North America,
practically all of which comes to the United
States, was $116,051,500.
The world's coinage of gold in the calendar
year 1960 $354.'.)3f>.497 and of silver $177.
01L902.
The industrial consumption of gold in the
United States in the calendar year 1900 is esti
mateU at $16,067..i00 and of the world, approxi
iiMlrtx $73,000,000-
The stock of subsidiary coin in the country is
limited by law to (100,000.0001, and on November
1. I9BL the existing stock was $00,613,512.
The report says it is not improbable that be
fore another Congress shall have opportunity to
act the growing needs of the country will have
absorbed the entire amount authorized.
By the act of March 14, 1900. authority was
given to u«e silver bullion purchased under the
act of July 14. IS***, for this coinage, but it is
necessary "that the limit set upon the stock !n

■W'ashinzton. Dec. 8 (Special).— American commerce

the disturbances of last year than that of other
countries. It was well known that the exports from
the United States to China last year showed a
marked reduction, but it is only through the of

ceived by the Treasury Bureau of Statistics, that
a comparison of the depression in American Chinese
trade with that of other countries can be ob

TO TRY DIAMOND TO-MORROW
COMMISSIONER MURPHY WILL USE EVI
DENCE WHICH CONVICTED THE
CAPTAIN AT ALBANY.
Captain Thomas .1. Diamond, who was con
victed of neglect of duty and fined $1,000 by
Justice Herrick, at Albany, will be placed on
trial before Commissioner Murphy at Police
Headquarters to-morrow. It was Diamond's
wish to be tried by Deputy Commissioner Dev
ery, who i? his personal friend. The fact that
he will be obliged to face Commissioner Murphy
is taken to mean that he will not be dealt with
leniently, and will probably be dismissed fron»
the force. The captain has been under suspen
sion for some rime.
Chief inspector Oortright filed formal com
plaint against Captain Diamond on Saturday,
charging him with neglect of duty. Commis
sioner Murphy, who received the complaint, im
mediately informed Captain Diamond that he
should appear before him to-morrow morning at
10 o'clock. Frederick B. House will appear as
Diamonds counsel. The testimony taken in the
trial before SvmOee Herrick. on which Diamond
was' convicted, will be offered as evidence, and
the captain will be permitted to it. The
trial will be public. Commissioner M-rphy «v?
that he has consulted the best legal advfee, and
is certain that the proceedings before him will
be in accordance with law.
"There will be no witnesses called against the
captain." he said. "Only the testimony taken at
Albany win be read to him. If the captain de
sires to take the witness stand he will be heard.
If he thinks that his interests demand rhe pres
ence of witnesses, he may call as many as he de
sires. He will receive thoroughly fair treatment,
and if he is innocent I have no doubt that he will
be able to establish it. I am not prejudiced in
the case, and if Captain Diamond proves himself
innocent he will be returned to duty. If he is
proven guilty, my course will be determined
when the proper time comes."
Frederick K. House, when seen last night by ■
Tribune reporter, saii that he was thoroughly
prepared to go on wMa the triai on Tuesday. He
declined to outline the defence, but appeared to
be confident of a decision favorable to his I
client. *
