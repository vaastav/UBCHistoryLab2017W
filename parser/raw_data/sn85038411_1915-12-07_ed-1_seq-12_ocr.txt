like this before." declared the Presi
dent with deep feeling.
The President's outline of the plans '
for the national defense and the need I
for them was received with silence by j
the senators and representatives, but
with rapt attention. His declaration |
of a new Pan-American doctrine was |
received with the deepest interest.
Finishes in An Hour
When the President urged merchant
marine legislation he was loudly ap- I
plauded and was forced to stop when j
he said: "It is high time we resumed !
our commercial independence on the
high seas.'' Republicans clapped their
hands vigorously.
Finally, at 1.42 o'clock, after having
been reading steadily more than an
hour, the President finished, and an.
other outburst of cheering took place
aB he left, the chamber and started
back to the White House. The joint
session dissolved, the Senate filed back
to its chamber and the House resumed
work where it had heen left off.
The House galleries were packed
three hours before the time for Presi
dent Wilson to deliver his address and
hundreds of disappointed ones who
had failed to get tickets of admission
lined the corridors of the Capitol and
stood on the plaza outside to get a
glimpse of the President as he passed
In.
Mrs, Gait Present
When the galleries had been filled
with the usual visitors the official par
lies came in. Mrs. Gait, the Presi
dent's fiancee, and her party took the
executive gallery. Other reserved
places were occupied by government
officials and their wives. The diplo
matic gallery was unusually well filled,
the Latin-American members being
largely represented.

TUESDAY EVENING,
ACCUSE NEGRO WITH
MURDER OF WOMAN
(Continued from Page One.)
dow in Mrs. Albright's home was
broken and told William Herman, a
i night watchman, and Harry Klugh,
I 800 North Sixteenth street. The two
j men investigated and found the body
of the murdered woman on the bed.
| The house had been ransacked.
The First Clue
The first clue to the murderer was
given to Harry White and John Mur
naiie. the detectives, by Wilson Sim-
I mers. an employe of the Ilarrisburg
j Railways Company. He gave a de
j scription of a colored man answering
that of Thomas Smith. Shiith was
seen before the murder, wearing a
slouch hat similar to the hat found
back of a lounge at the Albright home.
While the police were hunting for
Smith the robbery at the Levin home
occurred. The colored man described
by Mrs. Levin left no doubt as to the
robber being Smith. He disappeared.
Smith was traced to Lebanon, Reading
and Philadelphia and then the police
lost track of him. On November 9
Smith turned up in Harrisburg and
was arrested. When brought to the
police station he growled to J. Edward
Warden, lieutenant of police:
"¥ Didn't Kill Anybody"
"I didn't kill anybody. If I did,
hang me lor it. What have you ar
rested me for?"
On the following day Detectives
Murnane and White took up the evi
dence which they had and began a
search for information as to where
Smith had been since the Albright
murder. The testimony of the Leb
anon witnesses and others with whom
Smith had come in contact was told to
I Michael E. Stroup. district attorney.
I and he instructed Detective White to
swear out a warrant .igainst Smith.
I Asked For (iotaway Money
Evidence in the lv uls of the police
show the whereabouts of Smith from
i the night of the murder up to his re
i turn to Harrisburg. On the night of
I the murder, Carrie Black, colored.
' now in Lebanon, met Smith at the
: Washington House ori Walnut street,
j The. colored man was drenched to the
skin, and covered with mud. It was
• raining hard that night. Smith asked
{ her for ten cents, saying he wanted to
| get away. When the woman asked
I Smith what he had been doing he re
i marked:
| "The old had nothing. She
lis either dead or will die soon." The
woman went to Lebanon to visit
Pauline Davis. Two days later the
• •olored woman heard of the murder.
Smith came to their home soon after.
, The Davis woman said:
"Did you hear of the murder of the
1 old woman on Allison.Hill?"
Smith answered: "I don't want to
j hear anything, I am going away."
Has I.ong Record
j Smith then went to Philadelphia
I where he was arrested on a petty'
j charge. Later he returned to Read
; ing, then visited Lebanon, and came
;to Harrisburg. Soon after reaching
this city Smith tried to return the
money he took from Mrs. Levin. Two
1 hours later he was arrested by
i Roundsman McCann, Patrolmen
'Brine. Owens and Balthaser.
! Smith hails from Savannah, Ga. He
; has a police record and is also known
jas Archie Smith, William Jones.
.! Courtney Smith and Henry Jackson.
I Soon after leaving Harrisburg he serv
| ed time in Philadelphia for larceny.
He has been known to the Philadel
phia police for sometime, having been
arrested five times in that city since
1910 for highway robbery, larceny
and robbery.
i Wilson Simmers, the Railways
! Company employe called at the jail
| several times and is certain Smith is
| the colored man who had been
prowling about the Albright home
prior to and on the night of the
murder.
| It is said that Mrs. Albright made
j frequent visits to the Harrisburg
| home of Carrie Black and sold her
j lace and other goods. Smith met' the
aged woman there a number of times
j and was of the opinion that she had
I money. One witness will tell of a re
j mark made by , Smith prior to the
i murder, during which he said: "That
I old has money. It might be
| worth going after some time."
DEMOCRATS MEETING
I 'By Associated Press
Washington. D. C.. Dec. 7. With the
meeting of the Democratic National
Committee to-day the contesting dele
gations from St. Louis, Dallas and Chi
cago continued vigorously to urge the ]
claims of their respective cities for the
honor of entertaining the Democratic I
national convention of 1916.
'SUFFRAGISTS WIN
! OUT OVER RIVALS
i "Will Get First Hearing Before
Congress on Susnn B. An
thony Amendment
I
Washington, D. Dev. 7. The
congressional committee of the Na
; tional American Woman Suffrage As
j sociation won out over its rivals, the
i 'ongressional Union, in the race for
the first hearing In the sixty-fourth
j congress on the Susan B. Anthony
j suffrage amendment.
Rival deputations from the two or
j ionizations called on Senator Charles
jS. Thomas, chairman of the Senate
committee on woman suffrage, to-day
jand asked for a hearing. The, Senator
j replied that he had conferred with his
j colleagues regarding the situation and
they had decided to grant the Na
! tional American Woman Suffrage As
! sociation a special hearing on the
[ Susan B. Anthony resolution for Wed
nesday. December 15. at 10 oclock
jit. m. This is during the week of the
j forty-seventh annual convention of the
\ National Association, in Washington.
I The Congressional Union deputation
I asked for a hearing during its own
! convention, which will be held the
I week preceding that of the National
American Woman Suffrage Associa-
I tion. Senator Thomas toyed with a
paper weight and replied blandly that
lit was impossible. Then the Union
asked to share the hearing granted to
the national association. Senator
Thomas replied that this, too. was im
possible.
Against Hearing
"Can we not then have a hearing
somewhat later?" desperately de
manded Miss Alice Paul, chairman of
the Congressional Cnion.
"We always like to accommodate
parties who are interested in measures
before the Senate." said the Senator,
"when we are satisfied that they have
any real light to throw upon the ques
tion. Some of us, however, would
have to be convinced that you have
anything new or to the point to add to
the discussion. Personally I do not
believe thct you have, and I should
not urge that a hearing be given you.
The committee is made up for the
most part of suffragists, but those of
us who are members of the Democra
tic party are not especially interested
in listening to a repetition of your
threats against that party if we do not
succeed in forcing the suffrage resolu
tion through the sixty-fourth con
gress."
With this plain statement the Sen
ator cloned the Interview/
Mr*. Helen H. Gardner headed the
deputation from the National Ameri
can Woman Suffrage Association,

READING READY
FOR NEW SCHOOLS
Model Continuation Schools
Will Be Established in That
City Say Officials
IT all the present plans go into ef
fect, Heading will have one of the
best continuation school systems in the
State, say State educational authori
ties. Dr. Charles S. Foos, the super
intendent of schools, has been an earn
est advocate of continuation schools
for many years. In his recent speeches
he commended Mie spirit of this new
feature of the Pennsylvania school
system. Since the passage of the
Child Labor act, he lias been very
busy working up a plan for their es
tablishment.
Ttecently the merchants of the city
held a meeting, where, at their re
quest, Dr. Foos outlined the purposes
and the scope of the continuation
schools. The result of this confer
ence was that every merchant em
ploying juvenile labor, heartily en
dorsed the idea and enthusiastically
began the work at once: one of the
leading business men said: "The otti
ciency of. ray store will be increased
by the hotter educated clerks and the
community us well will be greatly im
proved."
Nearly two hundred department
store boys and girls will be required
to attend schools. While it is not cer
tain that every store will pay them
regular wages, for the time spent in
the classroom, some managers of the
larger stores have said that the con
tents of the minors' pay envelopes will
not be decreased.
Dr. Foos said: "It was compara
tively easy lo compile a schedule for
the stores, as there are dull periods in
every day and soijie of the boys and
girls can be spared and each child
will go to the schools two days of four
hours each. The workers have been
placed in three grades according to
their previous schooling, and will be
sent to a nearby school building. Wes
sons will be given in industrial geog
raphy, industrial arithmetic, English,
hygiene, drawing and salesmanship."
Following the meeting of the Mer
chants' Association, the leading manu
facturers of Heading had a confer
ence with Dr. Foos at which all phases
of the Cox Child Labor Act was dis
cussed. Dr. Frederick Wilson, of the
T. A. Wilson Optical Works, the larg
est manufacturing plant of optical
goods in the world, announced that he
would not only retain all of his juven
ile workers, but would build a school
room in his factory and would endea
vor to have an ideal scliaal. Other
manufacturers , signified their inten
tion of Constructing similar school
rooms. For the hoys and girls, who
will not be accommodated in the fac
tories, the school authorities will main
tain continuation schools in various
I buildings in different parts of the
city. .
"The co-operation between the
school authorities and the merchants
and manufacturers is very encourag
ing: there has never before existed
the close relation between the schools
and the business world. This is true,
no doubt, in other cities of the State."
One of the. school men at the State
Kducational meeting in Reading on
December 4th. expressed an opinion
that "the plan of education as outlined
by the State Department of Public In
struction for the continuation schoolß,
will have a tendency to make the
work in the entire school system more
practical and that the contact with
successful businessmen will have an
wholesome influence over the school
men."
While all of the larger cities of the
State have made plans to open con
tinuation schools in January, Reading
Is the first city to definitely announce
a complete organization. Tt might he
interesting, to know that Reading also
was one of the first cities in the coun
try to open evening schools.
