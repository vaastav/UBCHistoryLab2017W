Harper ran like a scared coyote.
The wise man Is he who doesn't bet.

It'a 18 and carfare for Boss Parker.

The gold brick twins were "worked."

well for Bell.
You can tell the winning bettors by

Now stop scrapping and get down to

Anyhow, he's a Democrat, and that
helps a whole lot.
And now Boss Parker will sit down
to a large dish of crow.
Now we'll get one administration
without Boss Parker's interference.
Oood thing Thanksgiving day came
before election day and not afterward.
One time that Willie Hearst didn't
figure in the result one way or another.
"Non-partisanship in civic affairs" is
still the shibboleth of all good citizens.
There are a few Democrats and non
partisans In Los Angeles — thank God!
Nearly the whole non-partisan ticket
was elected with Harper. That'B some
thing.
Incidentally, the Republicans can
read tho president's message for con
solation.
Poor "Doj" Lindley was not In the
running at all. That's what It Is to
have bad advisers.
The non-partisans will have a ma
jority in the city council. That of It
self Is a great victory.
The rooster's tall feathers may be a
bit bedraggled from the mud hurled at
him, but his clarion crow is as lusty as
ever.
Wouldn't it Jar you, If you had made
every arrangement for the election of
your favorite, only to see the other
fellow get it?
The principle of non-partlsanism in
municipal politics has been establshed
in Los Angeles. Hereafter It will have
to be reckoned with.
The Herald's bulletins were prompt
and accurate, and were enjoyed by
hundreds of citizens In the comfortable
rooms of the Homeseekers' club.
The election of a non-partisan ma
jority in the city council was alone
worth all the effort made by citizens in
behalf of civic dtci-ncy and honesty.
Everybody is at least thankful this
morning that the strenuous political
campaigns of 1906 are over, and that
business can now be resumed at the
old stand.
The fact is demonstrated, at least,
that every voter in Los Angeles is not
a. Republican. It had seemed otherwise
for some time past.

Moreover, The Herald boltovps In the

a partial victory for non-partisanship.
Hence The Herald has double cause to
make merry and be glad.
JAPANESE AND THE SCHOOLS
In his message to congress President
Roosevelt has devoted considerable
space to .the question raised in San
Francisco as to the right of the school
board to refuse admission of Japanese
to the public schools.
The question is an important one,
but the president can see but one side
to It, which is that no state or city
has the power to make or enforce any
law that will be in contravention of
treaty rights with favored nations.
Every lawyer will concede that much.
Japan is a favored nation and our
treaty with her requires us to grant to
Japanese in this country all the "rights
of residence" which citizens of the
United States enjoy.
But what is a "right of residence?"
Does It include free education at the
expense of citizens? That's the ques
tion which must be determined.
In the southern states, for Instance,
negroes are refused admission to the
white public schools, but Instead build
ings are erected for them, teachers are
employed for their education and they
are given equal advantages In their
own schools. The president has not
found any law that will prevent this
arrangement. And yet these negroes
are native Americans and are guaran
teed by the constitution all the rights
of white citizens. In fact, nobody has
made objection to It: on the contrary,
it is everywhere regarded as the
proper solution of a difficult question.
In San Francisco, as -we understand
it, the right to a free education has
not been denied by the school board to
the Japanese, but only that the Jap
anese shall attend a free school main
tained for foreigners.
The Herald does not class Japanese
with negroes, but Is merely drawing an
illustration to show that if the Jap
anese are accorded public school facili
ties as a treaty right It Is not neces
sary, to meet such treaty provision, that
Japanese should be sent to the white
schools. Is it not sufficient that the
Japanese are given a free public school
education?
But it is a legal question whether
attendance upon the public schools is
a treaty right. It is not specifically
mentioned in any treaty and there are
able jurists who maintain that public
school attendance is a "privilege," gov
erned and restricted by state and local
laws. Hence It will be seen that K^n
Francisco has some argument on which
to base its decision — at least until the
supreme court of the United States
shall otherwise construe the subject.
THIRTY MILES OF BUILDING
A total of thirty miles of building
frontage will be the extraordinary
record of Los Angeles for the present
year. That will be a feature of the
building superintendent's annual re
port, now in preparation. It not only
dwarfs all previous records for this
city, but it probably has no parallel in
any city at any period of the world's
history.
And this marvelous record has been
made in the face of what would be re
garded elsewhere as two serious ob
stacles, one material and the other sen
timental. An example of the first kind
is seen In the comparative decrease In
building permits for homes, as disclosed
in the last two monthly statements of
the superintendent of buildings. That
decrease is attributable solely to th«
extortionate marking up of prices by
the lumber trust.
The other obstacle alluded to was the
ear.y ert«ct of the calamity at San
Francißco and its neighborhood. There
was a degree of uncertainty about its
Influence on realty values, even at the
distance of 500 miles which separates
Los Angeles from the northern city.
The momentum of progress In this city
was too powerful, however, to be more
than temporarily checked by that dis
aster.
Notwithstanding the recent drawback
ln building- caused by the outrageous
advance In lumber prices, the record
for lust month pauses the million mark
by a good margin. The shortage in
aggregate value caused by the smaller
number of permits, consequent upon
lncreased expense of home building, is
nearly equalized by the great activity
ln the erection of business structures.
Thin feature is especially noticeable in
the many costly lmpr< iiii-ntH on the
leading retail thoroughfares.
The building outlook, as we approach
the new year, never before looked so
bright. Capitalists are preparing for
vast expansion in business improve"

price*- of material. Contractors gener
ally believe that the "holdup" by tho
lumber trust cannot long continue, and
that a break will tome, causing a re
sumption of home building with Kroner
activity than ever before.
ILL-ADVISED MOVF.MfINT
lt In announced thnt "Ministers of
Los Angeles are about to begin a
movement which they Intend shall cul
minate In the reinstatement of ftlbic
reading In tha public schools." The
Los Angeles Church federation, as re
ported, will take up the subject for
discussion at a future meeting. In sup
port of this movement the declaration
ls made that "a knowledge of those
portions of the Scriptures which have
to do with Christian ethics are essen
tial to the proper education of the
child and that they should be read In
the schools."
From this proposition It Is inferrpd
that thp purpose Is to Introduce In the
public schools nn puppclal feature of
Bible rpadlng, nnmely, the New Tes
tament. That Is the only part of the
ScrlpturPs, of course, that has n direct
bearing on the Christian religion.
A thoughtful consideration of this
subject must lonrt to the conclusion
that the movpment in question Is 111
ndvispil. In the first place the reln
troduetlon of the Bible In our public
schools, with special reference to
Christian ethics, would necessarily be
displeasing 'to large and important ele
ments of the city's population.
Los Angeles is. a cosmopolitan city
and there Is great, variety of non-
Chrlstlan belief in Its citizenship. There
are several religious elements here that
are not Christian and there Is a large
percentage of our people who are non
religious. An attempt to reinstate the
Bible in the schools would surely create
a condition of discord and social rup
ture such as never has been witnessed
here. And It is obvious that such a
rupture would be highly detrimental
to every feature of public and private
Interests.
Religious instruction for the rlsVng
generation Is commendable, but It has
no proper place In the public schools.
Absolute freedom in religious matters
is a guaranteed principle of American
government. It is rooted in the fed
eral constitution and is respected by
every phase of legislation. It would
not be right and It certainly would
not be expedient to force Christian
ethics into schools having a large per
centage of non-Christian or non-re
ltglous pupils.
There are ample opportunities for in
culcating Christian ethics among the
children of Los Angeles without In
vading the public schools in such zeal
ous efforts. The home, the Sunday
school and the church afford all the
means essential for leading children
of Christian parentage into the de
sired religious path.
This question of Bible teaching in
public schools was threshed out in Los
Angeles long ago, as It haß been at
some period In the hlßtory of nearly
every American city. The threshing
of It always has caused harmful dis
turbance of friendly relations In com
munities, and the certainty of a repe
tition of such rupture should cause the
proposition in question to be discoun
tenanced now in Los Angeles.
WORLD'S CHEAPEST FUEL
•A reliable sign of the rapid expan
sion of manufacturing Industries in
Los Angeles is seen in the largely in
creased demand for crude oil within
the last year. That increase has
caused greater activity in production,
but the output seems not to have been
enlarged in keeping with the greater
demand. The doubling of the price
per barrel within a year proves that
proposition. At this period a year ago
oil was selling in the Los Angeles
market at from 30 to 35 cents a barrel
in bulk, and the present price is from
60 to 70 cents, with strong indications
that it will reach Jl before next spring.
But even at the dollar mark the
home oil product affords cheaper fuel
for manufacturing purposes than is
obtainable probably in any other large
city in the United States. In figuring
the cost of fuel for powtr purposes
the common estimate, or belief, is that
three barrels of our local crude oil is
equivalent to a ton of coal. Even in
the most favored manufacturing cities
of the east It is doubtful If coal is
btainable at so low a figure as |3
a ton. At the present quotations in
this city the oil pquivalent of a ton of
coal costs only about $2.
Practically all of the manufacturing
industries of this city are operated
with nil for power generating purposes.
Comparatively little coal Is used in
Los Angeles for any purpose aside
from the heating of dwelling houses.
Wherever considerable heat Is re
quired, as in hotels, office buildings
and big stores, oil Is the fuel used.
The advance in oil prices does not,
by any means, Indicate a decrease in
the available natural mipply. The
quantity heretofore marketed haa been
dependent on the demand, and when
that was light there was no profit in
large production. At the present time
wells that long were Idle are again in
operation, and many new ones are sure
to be "brought in," as the oil men say.
The area of oil deposits in this sec
tion of the state is so large that the
natural supply is practically inexhaust
ible. Only a comparatively small por
tion rif the state Is ho large that the
known to geologists, haa been ex
ploited, operations being confined gen
erally to points easily accessible by
railway.
Los Angeles has an unfailing supply
of the cheapest fuel in the world as
a bails for its future as one of the
uorld'H greatest manufacturing cen
ters.

JAPANESE TREATY RIGHTS AND STATE LAWS
Baal* for Action Agalrmt the San Francisco Behool Board a* It Appear*
to the Federal Government
Special to the, Now York Kvenlng Post.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.— Far from
satisfactory Is the report made to (ho
president by Secretary Metcalt about
the Japanese problem on the Pacific
coast. The mission of the secretary
of commerce and labor to San Francis-
CO had a twofold purpose; hp went to
find the facts and to bring the Callfor
nlans "to their senses," to tO speak. In
the latter object he has failed. San
Francisco's attitude, If allowed to pre
vail, would inevitably embarrass the
relations between this country and
Japan. it Is fortunate that the Wanh
lngton and Tokio governments have
enjoyed such cordial relations in the
past, for they .-ire confronted with a
knotty problem in the solution of
which each must deal with such 1111-
r easonable factors as race prejudice
and union labor.
Th*» return of the president to Wash
ington and his receipt of Secretary
Metcalfs report must soon bo followed
by an official announcement, outlining
this government's course. Delay In do
lng this will embarrass the Japanese
government, which has thus fnr given
every evidence of a sincere desire to
placate the people of Japan and con
vince them that the United States will
deal squarely with their fellow coun
trymen In the United States. This wai
accomplished In some degree by the
general circulation of Seoretary Hoot's
cable dispatch to the American am
bassador at Toklo, in which appears
this pledge:
"You may assure tho government of
Japan In the most positive tormn that
the governmpnt of the United States
will not for a moment entertain the Idea
of treatment toward the Japnnese peo
ple other than that accorded to the
people of tho most friendly European
nation, and that there is no reason to
suppose that thp. people of the United
States desire our government to take
any different courae."
This dispatch was sent before Vis
count Aokl, the Japanese ambassa
dor at Washington, had filed at thn
state department a protest against the
exclusion of Japanese children from
the public schools of San Francisco,
and a request that the United States
see that Japanese subjects are accord
ed their full rights under the treaty
of 1894. According to Japan's interpre
tation of that treaty these rights in
clude the right of Japanese to attend
public schools of San Francisco under
the same conditions prescribed for the
children of other countries. Tho people
of Japan were further quieted by the
announcement of Secretary Metcalf's
trip to San Francisco under orders from
the president.
What Secretary Metcalf Found
Secretary Metcalf reached Washing
ton last week. He refused to discuss
the results of his trip before submit
ting his report to the president. It Is
known that tho secretary found that
the agitation against the Japanese had
been started by labor organizations,
but he was impressed with the wide
spread sympathy of Callfornlans in this
movement to check Japanese Immigra
tion. The secretary found many who
are In favor of nippipg in the bud
what they term "the Japanese prob
lem," and who resent the Interference
of the federal government with the
operation of a state law which pro
vides for the establishment of separate
schools for orientals.
The people of San Francisco contend
that the majority of Japanese who at
tend the public schools in that city are
18 years of age or more; they call at
tention of the xindeslrabllity of chil
dren attending schools with half-grown
men and women. It is true that many
of the Japanese students In San Fran
cisco are paying their living expenses
by working after school hours and that
many arc older than the white students,
but this is not the primary objection
to the Japanese. If, it were the Call
fornlans could pass a law fixing the age
limit for all children desiring admis
sion to public schools. There are
strong Indications that California is
preparing to segregate, the Japanese in
all social relations. The first step has
been the exclusion of the Japanese from
the public schools. A Jim Crow car law
for Japanese, refusal of accommoda
tions at the first-class hotels — all of
these are possibilities of the future of
the Californlans are left to their own
devices in the treatment of the Jap
anese.
While Secretary Metcalf was Rath

state department looking up the law in

the cast% studying the treaties with
Japan and preparing to make good his
promise, made Ih the name of the
president, that the Japanese people
shall recplvo at the hands of the United
States the same treatment accorded the
people of the most friendly European
nation. He has found numerous de
cisions of the supreme court in which
ltI It la held that a treaty Is the supreme
law or the land. as early as 1798, five
years after the constitution took effect,
a decision was handed down which Is
especially Interesting In the light of
the fact that at that time the discus*
slon Incident to the adoption of the
constitution must have been still fresh
ln the minds of many. In the course
of that decision, which upheld the right
Of aliens to inherit property in a state,
the laws of that state to the contrary
notwithstanding, appeared this para
graph:
"If doubts could exist hpfore the
adoption of the present national gov
ernment, they must be entirely re
moved by thp sixth article of the con
stitution, which provides that all the
treaties made or which shall be made
under tho authority of tho United State!
shall be the Hupremo law of the land,
and the Judges In every stiite shall be
bound thereby, etc. There can be no
limitation on the powpr of the ppople
of the United Btattl. By their author
ity the state constitutions were made
and by their authority tho constitution
of tho United States was established,
and they had the power to change or
abolish the state conventions, or to
make thorn yield to the genera! gov
ernment and to treaties made by th«lr
authority. A treaty cannot be the su
preme law of the land if any act of
the Btato legislature can stand In Its
way. If the constitution of a state
(which is the fundamental law of the
state and paramount to its legislature)
must glvo way to a treaty and fall be
fore it, would it be questioned whether
the loss power, an act of the state
legislature, must not be prostrate? It
Is the declared will of the, people of the
United States that every treaty made
by the authority of the United States
shall be superior to the constitution
and law* of any individual state, and
their will alone Is to decide. If a law
of a state contrary to a treaty Is not
void, but voidable only by a repeal or
nullification by a state legislature, this
certain consequence follows— that the
will of a small part of the United
States may control or defeat the will
of the whole."
This extract is selected from many
decisions which have a bearing on the
Japanese case, because the decision
from which It was taken was handed
down so soon after the constitution
went into effect. The department of
state and the department of justice
officials are confident that they will
have no difficulty in defeating before
the courts the contention of the Cali
fornians that the law of the California
legislature can in any way interfere
with a right guaranteed to Japan by
treaty.
Scope of the Japanese Treaty
The .question then arises as to
whether the favored nation clause in
our treaty with Japan includes the
right to attend the public schools estab
lished by a state. Article 1 of our treaty
of commerce and navigation, concluded
in 1894, guarantees to the citizens or
subjects of each of the two countries
"full liberty to enter, travel, or reside
In any part of the territory of the other
contracting party," that they shall "en-
Joy full and perfect protection for their
persons and property. They shall have
free access to the courts of Justice In
the pursuit and defense of their right;
they shall be at liberty equally with
native citizens, or subjects, to choose
and employ lawyers, advocates and rep
resentatives to pursue and defend their
rights before such courts, and In all
other matters connected with the ad
ministration of Justice they shal\ enjoy
all the rights and privileges enjoyed by
native citizens or subjects."
Nowhere In this article, cither in the
clause quoted or In those which follow.
Is the right to attend schools specified in
so many words, but the officials of the
department of state contend, and they
have the support of the department of
justice, that the following clause car
ries with It the right to attend schools
on the same footing as th« citizens of
the most favored European nations,
although that right is not stated In so
many words:
"In whatever relates to rights of resi
dence and travel, to the possession of

Why Teat Caae Waa Abandoned
Unofficial advices from Han Francisco
bring the upws that the case which had
been lirought In the Circuit court thPre
by attornpyn reprpspntlng the .lapanpso

of thp atntp law prescribing separate,

that the question Involved a trpaty be
tween this country and Japan, and that
the Japanpse could more advantage
ously rest their case on the ground of
a trpaty right.
This was good ndvlcp. If thp prpsi
dent is convlncpfl from th* report made
to him by Secretary Metcnir that Jap
anese citizens have suffered a denial
of right guaranteed to them by treaty,
the course nf procedure open to him Is
this: Through the secretary of state
the president calls to the attpntlon of
the governor of California the reported
violation of the treaty right, and r<>
qupsts that Immediate steps bo taken
tO rpmedy the matter. Should the gov
ernor of California agree with the
president hp can call a special session
of the legislature tn repeal the law
under which Japanese are excluded
from the public schools. If, as Is the
more probnhle, the governor differs
from the president, and is disposed to
argue for the rights of California to
regulate h<?r own school system Inde
pendent of the federal government, the
alternative lpft the president Is to place
the case in the hands of the attorney
general, who through the district at
torney for San Francisco may bring
the cane into court.

OLD CAR DELAYS TRAFFIC
The entire Hollywood and Colegrove
car systems were tied up almost an
hour just at the busiest time, about
5 o'clock, last night because one of
the dinky little double-end arks which
the Los Angeles-Pacific company per
sists In running on this line could not
climb the Bellevue avenue hill west
of Buena Vista street. The car, which
is almost as old as the system, only
had a few passengers, but the tracks
were wet and it balked as soon as U
began the ascent. After much hauling
and building a mall car was run out
and pushed It up.
But no sooner was It started west
than It struck another slight grade,
and in trying to pull up thiß burned
out one of its two motors. This put H
out of commission again and another
long delay ensued. Finally the mall
car was attached again and the de
crepit old car was pushed out to Hol
lywood. Passengers on half a dozen
or more cars were delayed and the mail
was held more than half an hour.
A westbound Hollywood car ran Into
and utterly demolished a wagon be
longing to the Excelsior laundry In
Hollywood near the city limits
about noon yesterday. Te wagon was
a total wreck, and laundry was scat
tered all over that part of the map,
but strange to say neither horse nor
driver was hurt.
The accident seemingly was the fault
of the driver. He turned his horse
directly in front of the fast approach
ing car, It is reported, and the mo
torman was unable to do more than
check the car before the smash came.
