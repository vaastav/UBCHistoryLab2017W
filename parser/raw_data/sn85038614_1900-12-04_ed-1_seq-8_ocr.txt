y-MUng;, and the f is*sftel>v 1 A T irginia reel, and
.' ■ a:i Indian war 'dance, but never . before
, had he witnessed .the revels;. of- Terp
?' r sichore amonu the iimiatcs ot a lunatic
■asylum.
;. It-was a largo, liriliiantly illuminated
;i hall; the iJOor. was perfectly waxed, tho
..'-..- znusic <*xhi!arathi£, and . the nurses and
; invited guests made violent - efforts to
render the occasion a happy one. But
there, was a woefui lack ;'o* the gayety
: -and gJamour so insei>arably ■; connected
; with- such festivities. Half the pooiv
crazed souls sat against ine\ wail look
ing ■' indifferently at the jgi'rations of
; taose ..upon the Jloor. Occasionally there
would be a weird burst of laughter, but
they were- quiet for the most -part.
Farraut was "particularly attracted -by
; a- girl who sat across the room opposite
ills stand against the door. She was a
pretty young girl,, with; a delicate, ova)
; i~HC<i;and a -Madonna- softness of expres
s Son in her deep blue eyes and sensitive
.mouth.
- - "1 wonder if she's insane," said Far
/ rant to himself. : "Nothing- wild about
• ■-■Jter; rather a" melancholy face, however.
A nurse was leaning against the back
of her chair a moment ago, so I suppose
she must be a patient." By heaven, it's
The Pates must have
tangled their threads somehow, or they
would never have spun- a destiny so
horrible for such an' apotheosis, of lovely
Ayomanhood!"
. But Farrant had jumped to conclu
;sions too hastily; the Fates had by no
.means allotted so malignant a destiny
; to' "Kdiih Monroe, the girl 1 in question.
'Like himself, she was a guest.
Her eyes, travelling pitifully around
the room, fell upon Farrant, whose posi
tion was a. little isolated from the -other
; sheets.
"Look at that poor fellow -by r the
door," she said to . a lady seated next
s : to \er.
! "Do you think ha is a patient?"
asked the lady.
"Oh, yes, I "kr.ow he is," said Edith
positively. " "I saw Dr. Jackson bring
him in, and the Doctor keeps his <^s oii
him, and epeaks to him now and then.
"How despondent he looks! He's hand
tome. Isn't he? And -young; not more
than SO, I should think. How' tragic it
is!" And Edith's sweet blue' eyes sad
dened.
"I believe I will go over and ask him
to dance with me. There can't be any
danger, or he wouldn't be allowed to
come," said she, impulsively.
She crossed the room and etood before
Farrant. : /
• "Do you waltz?" she asked gently,
her color rising a little.
"I shall be delighted if you will give
me the pleasure of dancing -with you,"
said. "Farrant promptly and cordially.
"He could not have replied 'with more
praciousness if ,he had been sane,"
thought Edith.
: Mentally, . Farrant said: "JMy. surmise
is correct; of couree, if; her 'mind were
all right she wouldn't ask a man she
has not been introduced to, to dance.
It has been a good while," 'he reflected,
"since : I tripped the light fantastic, but
: I suppose I am enough in trim, to waltz
with a crazy eirl."
;' Edith was a perfect dancer, light and
graceful, so. they got along very well.
; "I ■am co glad my friend 'brought me
■''.'this evening," said Farrant to her.
; "Yes, so am I. Dr. Jackson Is the
friend you allude 1 to, -isn't he? He is so
Talented; we are all 'very prqud of him,"
said Edith. .
."'Farrant answered abstractedly; he
■ T.'as thinking: "Confound Jackson, . be
-iieve she's in. -love v."ithhim. He will
* cafe her, and orange blossoms,- best'
man,- etc., ,. will follow. Jackson was al
ways in luclw".- = ■ "J :
■i;.:'Do you come to these affairs often?"
;-lie asked aloud.., r • ..
'-'.VXo, this is'" the" first -I "have ever at
tended. I have often . wanted to come,
but have always beerf'Sisappointed."
si "Not allowed, 1 suppose," muttered
i'Farrant below "his breath.
"'"And, you, do -you come often?" Tlie
: question slipped- out, and Edith half re
/gretted it, fearing, to, touch a sensitive
"lioint. ...
. "Oh, I am only on a flying visit.- I
don't live here; I came on business and
to see Jackson, who is an old friend."
■'■- f; "How deceitful tliese maniacs are. As
if: I. didn't know lie was an -inmate,"
•thought Edith.
; ; : They glided around two" or three more
. times and then, the music changing for
the lancers, they promenaded slowly _up
land down the long- -hall. Farrant
paused at a door, .which opened upon
: the moonlit garden outside and which
looked very entrancing contrasted with
' the heat and glare of- the 1 ball-room.
:He was totally unprepared for the
effect his simple : - suggestion to stroll
■;. about outside produced. ...A frightened
look leaped into Edith's eyes and she
I faltered ner%*oui=ly.
V "The " de\il! Of- course, she .doesn't
dare leave the room without her keep
er," thought Farrant vexodly.
"After '-all, we had better not. We
T\-ould probably be missed," said he
hastily. And; Edith gave a relieved
sigh; not for a; fortune she 'have
trusted herself ' iii the ga'rde'h with a
lunatic. ■ ■ . ■ •
■ Farrant cast about for a safe topic of
.1. tanversation. His Jgaze chancing to fall
the slim, ungloved hand which
■rested upon his- arm, was arrested by a
; ;:-ins which circled her finger. A brilliant
'Crimson light*; "shot from - the heart of
tho gem. ,; which,- - surrounded by dia
monds, was set in a heavy, dull, gold
hand. The stone was a. curiously en-
jacinth. Farrant admired it, and
12dith explained -the of the jewel.
.. "It is said to 'have been one of the
: precious stones v plundered from the
;> raagniiicent ehrine-^at Cologne, which

Mit-s Howard; it is my one, hope to cure
her, and then .persuade .her -"..J0 'marry

Farrant. pulled himself together, and
wished, his. friend good luck, though his
heart belied his. words.
• .7 II.;
A few days later Egerton Farrant v:as
slowly, walking from the. asylum; -' he had
called upon Dr., Jackson, but had.missed
him. At a little "distance he paused and
looked -back. The brooding .softness and
glamour of a perfect Indian summer
afternoon hung over the building. Against
a great, background of purple and golden
hills It was sharply outlined. '.With its
glittering white dome and -.spires, its
massive proportions ; and architectural
finish, it might have stood for the palace
of' some mighty; duke or' earl; only the
lines '-jupon lines of'- ominous, iron-barred
windows told the" fale that- it was the
refuge for hundreds of wrecked minds.
In . front of the asylum were beds of
brilliant nowers, and the : sweetest
scented; air echoed to the music of fall
ing water from a fountain that played
in the centre- of the parterres. In a
miniature lake a trio of swans disported.
The emerald lawn swept away into a
grove of shade trees, with winding walks
and rustic seats.
"Xumbers of the patients, guarded by
their nurses, were strolling about the
•walks or sitting under the trees. Far
rant walked on," v carefully, scrutinizing
uvery group, 'with the : , vague hope of
seeing the girl who had" enthroned her
self a true Venus vlctrix in his heart.
As l«s turned a curve; of the path
which led to the gate,' he saw a woman
pass out of^the grounds. Zle was - too
great a distance to recognize her pos
itively, but something- familiar in her
appearance. -quickened-. his steps. As he
gained upon her, '"he"; saw the graceful,
girlish" carriage and '.linely-poised head
belonged to Edith Monroe— or Miss How
ard, as lie thought of her.- He was of
two "minds, whether to turn 'back and
give the alarm that she had escaped from
the asylum, or to join her and try to
persuade her : to return. He pursued the
latter '"course.' 1 "Meantime, oEdith, "who had
been to the - asj r lum -to carry some
llowers"to' a sick friend,' happened , to'
glance "over her shoulder' and saw Far
rant hurrying after her. She knew him
at once, and"~was ""terrified.
"An ; escaped lunatic!" she muttered,
as she glanced around despairingly. On
one side rose a. steep hill, on the other
a dense woou; a lonely country road,
stretched before her. It csvas quite' a
mile to the village, but it was possible
lite* she might meet some one, so she
broke, into a run.
Farrant "accelerated his pace. He had.
much ado to catch her up.'
."She's as fleet as Atalanta, poor girl!
I wish I had some apples to divert her."
But Edith could jiot hold out longer
against his great strides.
"Why did you run after me?" panted
Edith," hardly knowing what sne was
saying:
■■"1 wanted to beg you to return to the
asylum."
"I can't go back; I'm sorry, as you
wish it," she said.
"But you know in the end you will
be obliged to . go back, so why not" go
now?" '' •'--.'.
■ "Why will I be obliged to go back in
the end?" asked Edith, wonderingly.
They are now walking- forward side
by side, Edith's panic having subsided
somewhat.
"I hate to say this to you, but I know
you are one of the inmates," said Far
rant. *
■ Edith gazed at him compassionately.
"Poor fellow!" she thought. "I will
not refute his idea, he might become
dangerous."
So they talked, playing at cross pur
poses. They passed Use point where an
other road ran into the main one, but
no one was to be seen coming either
way. Presently, however, there was
the" beat of horses' hoofs and the ring
of wheels 'upon the other road. Edith
tried in vain' to' pierce the barrier of
trees and bushes between her and pos
sible release. She was afraid to scream.
Farrant, being taller, caught a glimpse
of the vehicle flashing by.
"Hello! Stop!" he called out suddenly.
"Please.wait for rue here a- moment," -lie
said to Edith, as he forced a way
through the undergrowth. She com
plied with his request, having no option,
as he could easily over fake -her a. second;
time.
"I say, Jackson, it's lucky I recognized
you. One, of :the patients at the asylum
has escaped; the girl you were telling
me about— Miss Howard," cried Farrant,
excitedly.
"Good heavens!" exclaimed Dr. Jack
son. "Where is she?"
"On the other side of the hedge."
" In a trice the; doctor had jumped from {
his buggy and was striding across the
road in Farraht's wake. Edith had sunk
down on the side of the road, worn out,
but when she caught sight of Dr. Jack
son she- ; sprang up and came flying
toward him, half laughing, half crying.
"Oh, Dr. Jackson! 1 am so-'ghuTto see
you," she cried, as she caught his hand.
"1 thought she loved him!" Farrant:
muttered.
The doctor looked at her amazedly.
"The escaped lunatic," she. whispered.
"The escaped maniac! Yes!' Where is
she?" cried : the doctor, looking -eagerly
up. and down the road.
•'Why/ Jackson, is your brain turn
ing?" said Farrant, stupefied. .
= "What on earth are,- you talking, about?
We are losing valuable time: "Where is
Miss Howard, Farrant?"
'.'Holding your coat-sleeves," said Far
rant. J3eneath his breath he muttered,
"He's daft, too!"
' VHo thinks I am crazy," said Edith in
a low tone.
' A- light broke, on Dr. Jackson, and he
flung back his head, bursting into, violent
laughter. Edith and Farrant watched
him anxiously.
. "It'siall a mistake," he cried, between
I convulsive gasps. \ ,
Farrant saw it next, but he did not find
it so amusing 1 , .v ;•'',
■ "Do you mean. to say?", he began.
. *'I mean .to say," interrupted the doc-;
tor. "that while all tWs party, of three
havo hitherto been considered level-head
ed, clever people, I think recent events
make it. desi rable that they should- be put

Jwiped his "stream ing; eyes. .-'•■•'•• ■
"Miss - Monroe, let me ."introduce my

'December Critic. "
Mr. Warner was a. fine representative
of thesecond generation of New England
writers; the generation of Mr. Stedman,
Mr. Aldrich; and Colonel Higgirison.
Older "than the two poets who shared
with him the traditions of the literary
movement which began with Hawthorne
and ended with Holmes, he stood with
them as well as with Colonel Higginson
in the line of literary succession.
• If to this group are added the names of
Mr. Clemens, Mr. H dwells, and Mr.
Stoddard, the list of the senior practi
tioners of the art of writing in this coun
try'is fairly complete. It is to be noted
of. this group, as of its predecessors, that
there is no discord between the men "ana
their work; there -is that fine harmony
between craft ancV craftsman which has,
so for, almost without a break, been the
tradition of American literature.
Froni the beginning the- art of writing
in this country has been identified with
dignity of character, generous' culture,
and vital- interest in the higher life of
the nation. MJr. Wairner's generation
has 'not' felt the stress-of a great nation
al crisis '"; as the writers of the earlier
period felt and were stirred by it; but,
hot less than Lowell, Emerson, and Whit
tier, though in different ways, they have
definitely stood for the highest ideals of
civic life.
Apropos Antoinc "YVntteaxi.
(December Critic.)
There is in the whole province of art,
no more appealing figure than that of
Antoine .Watteau, nor anything quite so
full of tender joy as his glimpses of
love's comedy, little impromptus and im
provisations which colored the art of a
century, which gave it distinction and
imperishable cachet. Eager, restive, he
came early to Paris, where he drifted
from petty lodging- to palace. At the
Hotel Crozat he tasted, for a time, peace,
and there; and in ' his patron's villa at
Montmorency, he touched sleeves with el
egance. But. concerts, routs, and garden
fetes left him reticent, indifferent, though
he must have noted, the while, , an inva
sive profile, the sheen of satin or taffeta,
the' rhym. of dancers, dark trees over
head, and, in the distance, ambient haze
or the sparkle of imprisioned waters. His
art, at first mere genteel Tenters, became
transfigured, Venetianized, Rubenian. He
found life full of empty pretence; lie
added a touch of Arcady, bathed It in
new, alluring beauty.
Praised His "Worlc and Vanished.
(Baltimore Sun.)
Jingle, jangle, jingle went the doorbell
of a residence on east Twenty-first. street
last Tuesday, and the ' mistress ' of the
house quietly peeped from an upper win
dow.
It was a peddler of a polishing paste,
who was making good use of his time
while awaiting an answer to his ring by
polishing the brass knob of the rail as a
sample of ..what his great paste would do.
Nobody opened the door, and the ped
dler gave another pull on the bell, "some
thing louder than before," and got to
wqrk on the opposite knob.
' "Everybody \ -dead in this house," he
muttered, "or deaf, perhaps." Another
tug at the bell and more polishing, and
everything in sight was shining like bur
nished gold.
.'.'No go," said the paste vendor. "I'll
move on."
"Thank you. It's very nicely done,"
came a woman's voice from the upper
window, but when the vendor loolced up
there was nobodj? in sight.
Aroused Her Curiosity After All.
(Baltimore Sun.)
"Don't want any,"- said a north Broad
way housekeeper from her second-story
window to a street vendon whose wagon
was standing 'a few steps away, and who
had just pulled the bell.
"Don't want any what?" gruffly asks
the Arab, who hasn't had even a chance
to tell what his wares are.
"What have you got?" asks the house
keeper, whose curiosity is getting the
better of her annoyance.
"Oh, never mind, you don't N want* any
Git up, Bob."
"Now, I wonder what that exasperating
man is' selling, anyhow?" she exclaimed,
as the wagon disappeared around the cor
ner.

In China even the writer of rejected lit

tion iv Great Success.
BERLIN, December 3.— A dispatch
from Field Marshal Count yon Walder
see, commander-in-chief of the interna
tional forces in China, sent from Pekin
under date of" Saturday," December- Ist,
says that after hoisting the German flag
at the Ming tombs, and punishing seve
ral neighboring villages for the murder
of Christians, the late Colonel Yorck's
detachment, commanded by General
Gayl, returned to Pekin in four columns,
by way of Yang Fang, Chen Pien Tsheng,
Than Shan, and Nlu Lan Shan, each
about a day's march northward of Pekin.
The Kalgan expedition, the dispatch
also says, was very successful. Several
thousand Chinese regulars, under the
command of two generals, were driven
in wild flight from the province of Chi
Li to Shan Si.
The remains of the late. Colonel Yorck
have arrived at Pekin.

"« r ASHINGTON, December 3.— (Special.)
Tlie North Carolina Station,. in connection
with some of its recent poultry experi
ments, recorded the weight of eggs per
dozen, as well as the number of eggs
produced by pullets and old hens of a
number of well-known breeds and by
Pekin ducks during six months.
Generally speaking, larger eggs were
laid ,by hens than by pullets of the same
breed. The eggs laid by the Pekin ducks
(old and young) were heavier than those
laid by any breed of hens, weighing- 35.6
ounces per dozen. Of the different breeds
of hens tested the largest eggs were laid
by the Light Brahmas, weighing 28 ounces,
per dozen. The Black Langshan and
Barred Plymouth Rock hens' eggs weigh
ed a little over 26. ounces per dozen, .while
those laid by Single Comb Brown Leg
horns, lato hatched Plymouth Rock,
White Wyandotte, and Buff Cochin hens
ranged from 2-1.7 to 23.7 ounces per dozen.
Of the pullets, the heaviest eggs were
laid by the Black Mlnorcas, weighing 2G.5
ounces, the lightest by the Single Comb
Brown Leghorn and Silver-Laced Wyan
dottes, weighing 17.5 and 22.1 ounces per
dozen respectively. The Barred Plymouth
Rock", White Plymouth Rock, White Wy
andotte, Black Langshan, and Buff
Cochin pullets' eggs all weighed not far
from 24 ounces per dozen. As will be
seen, the variation in the weight of 'the
eggs were considerable. Rating the light
est eggs (those from ; Single Comb Brown
Leghorn pullets) at 13 1-2 cents per dozen,
the prevailing market price in North Car
olina when these tests were . made, the
relative value of eggs from other breeds
on the basis of their, weight and
real-value, in proportion to the market,
price, was calculated as follows:

On the basis of the results obtained the
station believes that selling eggs by the
1 pound, would, be more rational than by
the dozen.. "On what other article of food
: will * people be content to pay the same
price for what may vary/ over 50 per cent,
in value? , Or; .what producer -.of ■■> mer
chantable produce of any other kind will
consent to supply, all the. wayup to-55
per. cent, more ... than -. market value and
not think to add to ;the standard prico
for additional value?" An apparent ob
jection.to selling eggs by weight; is that
they are not generally 'used in the house
hold in this way. " Most .recipes call-' for
eggs by number and' not; by .weight. There
■i3: no I ' question;. that weighing' -the '. eggs
would be more accurate. » -

We ; take the. folio winy" from th'o'.ltlch
/mond Dispatch:'
_ "In- answer to the ' crltlclam of some of
our Yankee friends anent ilui-coii'hiflt of
the war in South Africa upon the jlart of
■the British, Mx. T. C. Smith addresses
at -letter to the New York Sun, In which
he; takes issue v/ith those critics. After
showing what various European Powers
.have done in the way. of modern warfare,
he cites an instance nearer home. Vln so
_doing he quotes the following copy of an
official report," which we hope will be
widely read up North:
" 'Woodstock, W. Va., Octoberr 7, 1864;
" 'Lieutenant-General U.- S. Grant: .
" 'I have" the honor, to report my com
mand at this point .to-night. I com
menced moving • back from Port Repub
lic, Mount Crawford,' Bridgewater, and
Harrisonburg yesterday morning. '■-'- ' .
.. .." 'The grain and forage in advance of
these points had been previously de
stroyed. In moving back to thisspoint
•the whole country, from the Blue Ridge
to the North Mountain/ has been rendered
untenable for a rebel army. ■
" "I have destroyed over. 2,000 barns
filled Ith wheat, and ha>vand farming im
plements; over seventy mills,, filled with
flour and- wheat;, have driven in front of
this army four herds of stock, and have
killed and issued to the troops not less
than 3,C00 sheep.
" ..'This destruction embraces the Luray
Valley and Little Fort Valley, as well as
the Main Valley.
.-" 'A large number of horses have been
obtained."
"'Lieutenant John E. Meigs, my en
gineer officer, was murdered beyond Har
risonburg, near Dayton. For this atro
cious act all the houses within an area
of five miles were .burned.
.'.' 'P. H. SHERIDAN, .
1 . '.' 'Major-General.'
"If we rightly recall the facts, Lieu
tenant - Meigs was not 'murdered,' but
was killed in an encounter with Confed
erate soldiers. But, alas! Mr. Smith has
not put before the public; a title of the
atrocities of which General Sheridan was
guilty."
The. South has no respect for the mem
ory of either Generals Sherman or Sheri
dan, dead, and but little more, if any, for
General Miles, living..-. The conduct of
Weyler in Cuba, all things considered,
was no worse, no more dastardly, or. more
unbecoming the soldier than that of Sher
man in Georgia, and South. Carolina, and
Sheridan in' the Valley of Virginia. No
other officers of the army were so cruel
ly -wanton, or so unnecessarily vicious in
their treatment of helpless men and wo
men. - - '
And Miles's treatment of Mr. Davis while
the latter was a prisoner at Fort Monroe,
was as coarsely and vulgarly brutal as
it was unnecessary, unsoldierly, and cow
ardly.
■We can lift our- hats in sincere respect
in memory of Grant, or Thomas, or Mc-
Clellan.-or Meade, or Burnside, and those
who distinguished ' themselves as brave,
honorable soldiers, but ..the sooner the
names of the others may be allowed to
be forgotten the better. /;.!
And Miles, tofday,; commander though
he be, is pointed to more frequently 'with
contempt by his own people than" other
.wise. ' blob 1 o be it. 
/. -. ' East African Ruljlier.
(London Standard.)
Mr. -Vice-Consul Marsden's report to the
Foreign Office on the trade of the East
African Protectorate for. the year ending
March 31st iast shows that the restoration
of order in Uganda has had a good effect
upon the trade of the region. The in
crease of consumption of rubber, which
has had so marked an effect on some of
our tropical possessions, and is likely to
lead to a revival of prosperity in others
suitable for its cultivation, gives interest
to the following passage from the report:
"Rubber shows as advance^of .40 per cent,
on the previous year, but is still far be
low what" it should be, and what the
country is capable of producing. This is
due in a large measure to this Industry
being left to take care of itself, and no
properly disciplined or organized effort
made to assist it. In times of drought
and bad harvests, the natives fall back
on the rubber-collecting harvest to keep
themselves from 'starvation,-. 'but' in- times
of plenty the'e industry is more or less
neglected, and only vines which grow In
those places easiest oi| approach are
tapped, and in many cases ruined by'
being cut to the groundinstead of tapped.
I can only refer to fife remarks made last
year on this. subject, and which. l again
repeat with, if possible, greater emphasUiL
under tho conviction that there is money
for the private individual and for govern
ment if the industry were more systema
tically worked."
liOndou Press on tlie Message.
LONDON, December 4.— Comment here
upon President McKinley's message to
Congress is chiefly devoted to the refer
ences ;to America's Chinese policy;
The Daily Graphic says: ."The policy
of the -United States regarding" China
is not heroic, but' it is certainly practi
cal, and there is ample reason to believe
that it will prevail."
. The Times says: "The message makes
it clear that on the vital point" of insist
ing upon punishment for the outrages,
Mr. .McKinley remains firm. We are glad
to see that 'on the subject of guarantees
for Christian converts' the President
makes a new "proposal, in advance of
any put ■ forward elsewhere. T In regard
to the indemnity question, he is in agree
ment with; some of : the: best -opinion in
England."/ • '■  ..
The. 'Times's editorial concludes with
the expression of a- hope that, Mr. Mc-
Kinley's second term may ; be marked by
a "satisfactory settlement of all . out
standing questions between Great Britain
and America."- >..
■■ ' The Daily News says: "The message
contains nothing-new, and; nothing very
illuminating on matters: that are .old. It
will be - very" closely scanned for its. re
ferences to " China. : It Uooks as though
the /American" -formula -were that the
Powers are to speeffy the. culprits, and
the Chinese-Government is to specify the
punishment. ; On .: such terms, a speedy
settlement would' undoubtedly ; be possible,
but -would it -be; effective .for durable?"
