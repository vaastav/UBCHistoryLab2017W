On the eighth page of the Repub
lican will be found the message of
President Roosevelt to the Sixtieth
4 Congress It appears in an abridged
form which makes it more compre
pensive than the entire message which
o consists of about 29000 words would
be The message is worthy of study
and our readers can well spare the
time to read It
Our report of the Saunders suit to
recover money bet on Hager in the reI
cent election has gone the rounds of c
the dally press It appeared as special
i dispatches from Hartford In four Lou
isville two Owensboro and two Cin
cinnati dailies to say nothing of the t

would do well to adopt the same lau I

readers informed of current events J

EVERETT TO j
RULE OR RUIN
Continued from first page
put up to the Kentucky delegates to
select a man to be nominated Mr C
iiI Barnett was selectedwas nominal
and elected by 199 votes to 8 for his
opponent Mr H E Wilson of Okla
homa who was one of Mr Everltts
special friends But when the vote
was announced he arose and moved to
make the election of Barnett unani
mous which was immediately carried
The oilier of leers were elected with
out opposition 4
Then Mr Everitt came to t pst fid
made a talk In which he promised to
support the newly elected officials and
do all ho could toVidvanco cite socie
ty Then upon reading of the con
tract that Mr Everitt had made wth
himself in 1903 by which Uptodate
Farming was made the official org n
ot the society for a period of PO years
A motion was made to disavow said
contract The result of the vote was
that only 15 votes were recorded in
favor of the contract Then couple to
this contract his proposed revision of
tho constitution and bylaws especial
ly section 4 Duties of oficcrs which
Is as follows The President shall
have general supervision of the so
cietys headquarters and Its activities
In the field Ho shall employ a com
petent secretary and other help as ne
cessary to give corect and efficient
service and he shall determine the
salaries paid He shall also select a
National Organizer and such assistant
as necessary and determine their sai
ary Ho shall plan or give his sanc
tion to all campaigns before they are
undertaken He shall also contract
for all expenses for the National Un
ion or delegate this authority to oth
ers under his supervision He shall
sign all charters and commissions with
the Secretary or delegate thus au t
thorizing and perform the duties that s
properly devolves on an executive ofJ
fice
t
There are specific charges against
the oxPresjdent not mentioned hero I
that would Salsfy the most exacting c
that canbe later If
can given necessary j
But this article is getting too long J
Now dear readers does it seem un
reasonable that a convention made I
up of the best and most earnest men
from the various State county and
local unions of twenty States sent to
this meeting to look after and protect
the Interests of the society would go
so far astray as Mr Everitt would have
you believe The facts are that while tJ
would not detract one particle rogt
life honor due Mr Everitt for giving I
us tho < plan of the A B of E ffet
wJion we consider the continued hpn
orf and praise he could have received
had he proved true to the trust re k
posed In him Then on the pthqr handu
when we consider that his has peen S
a career or crookedness and decep t
tlbh as matters appear now thon he
certainly deserves the greater aiaount
of contempt yg use of his > greater d
capacity for doing good Now to con = a
binds as you were represented by a I
good sized delegation from your own 0
State whq could not have been prompt
ed by any but the purest of moUyes 11
