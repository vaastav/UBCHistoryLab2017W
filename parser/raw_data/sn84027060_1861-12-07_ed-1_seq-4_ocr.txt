surrection against t.ie National government,
and that we respectfully advise that such order
of emancipation be issued whenever the same
will avail to weaken the power of the rebels in
arms or to strengthen the military power of the
loyal forces.
Mr. Dunn moved to lay the resolution o^i the

make the resolution apply to the slaves of dis

On motion of Mr. Stevens, the further consid

WHSRIAS, Slavery has caused the present re

there can lie no solid and permanent peace and
onion in this Republic so long as that Institution

used by the Rebels as an essential means of sup

by the law of nations it is right to liberate the
slaves of an enemy to weaken his powers.
Therefore, be it enacted by the Senate and

Resolved, That the said Henry 0. Burnett be

the Governor of Kentucky be notified of his
expulsion.
Resolved, That the Sergcant-at-Arms bo di
rected not to pay Mr. Burnett's salary which
baa accrued since the close of the extra Session.
Mr. Wickliffc said he had intended to prepare
and submit a proposition something like an
obituary notice of bia colleague (laughter).—
The latter was not, as the resolution asserted, in
aruied rebellion, but heads a provisional Gov
ernment in Kentucky. A revolutionary conven
tion, not satisfied with the treatment of this
Government to maintain the Union, nor satisfied
with the course of his own State, he, Burnett,
has assumed the important duty ot organizing
another Government for the better protection
of the lives, property, and liberty of the people
of Kentucky, and iu this undertaking employed
Simon Buckner, who is not only somewhat as
similated in name, but iu the deeds of Simon
Guetterez, who once headed the Indiana in Ken
tucky. Three times had the gallant people of
Kentucky declared by overwhelming majorities
6he would not leave the United States to run
af tor strange Gods, or for the so-called Southern
Republic-, notwithstanding her repeated declar
ations for the Union, and in violation of the
well known sentiment of Kentucky, they had
been told the object of the Convention and of
the so culled Southern Confederacy was to re
deem tbem from despotism, and lo protect their
rights, aud we wcredeceited. We were told by
tbe Executive of thia so culled Southern Con
federacy it was intended to respcct the condi
tion ot Kentucky, which it was pretended would
not be done by the Government of the United
States.
The Union men of Kentucky never did deny
the right of.the federal government to occupy
its aoil for the excrcise of the purposes implied
by the Constitution of Kentucky.—did acknowl
edge her obligations and expressed her inten
tion to jlliil them. Tbe proclamation of the
Governor of Kentucky deceived the people, but
tbe Legislature denounced him. Two messen
gers of p.'ace were sent to tbe executive of the
U. S. and one to the President of the Southern
government to know what they intended to be
done with Kentucky. The former said it intend
ed to maintain the laws and constitution of the
United States. That this was believed to be the
will of tin' peopta of Kentucky. The latter de
clared hi intended to respect tbe neutrality of
K^ntnrkv as unde stood by the secession psrty
of the State.
The Southern President did not tell them he
bad matured a pl.ui to assail at the different
points, nor did lie tell them there waa on the
statute bock of the Southern Government, n law
providing money and means not to sustain Ky
against oppression, but to carry her into tbe Sou
thern Confederacy against tbe majority of two
tliirds of the entire State. The provisional gov
ernor of Ky., was sent to see government at
Richmond, meanwhile Burnett ot the head ol
the new order of affairs in tbe discharge of his
duty, ind an armed force has been gathered
composed or' ^onng, desperate, reckless men,
commanded by Buckner. In conclusion, Mr.
Wicklifle said, with the blessing of God, I pre
dict that by 25th of Dec. no rebel foot will be
found on the soil of Ky. [Applause.]
The resolution for the expulsion of Burnett
was adopted. Adjourned.

The seats of Breckinridge and Burnett, of Ken

is thought bv some that Senator Powell will be
called upon for explanations.
Senator Polk, of Missouri, is in the city, and
will take his scat.
In reference to the disloyal members, it is pro
posed by many members of Congress to appoint
a Joint Commute of Investigation, to ascertain
wh.it have been the acts of the suspected par

Senator Bayard is here, but it remains to be
seen whether he will carry out his pledges to re

House.
Empire, and the other for poweh If it is in
tended by this that the United States are strug
gling to maintain the sovereignty of the Union
against a wicked rebellion, prompted by the as
pirations for power of certain disappointed
Southern politicians, (as affirmed by tho Confed
erate Vice-President a twelve month since,) tbe
remark iB just, but it is not the less true, that
those leaders have been able to raliy tbe South
mainly on the subject of slavery. Every other
subject of irritation, of which ther„o have been
several, (for it is ever the craft of demagogues
to turn everything into a grievance,) has been
and ia merely an auxiliary. Tbe rebellion has
been brought about by ambitious men aspiring
to power, who have succeeded by years of agita
tion, in inflaming the public mind on the sub
ject of slavery.
The English language could not express the
truth more clcirly or more tersely than it was
done by Gen. Jackson, in tlie words already
quoted: "The tariff was hut a pretext Dis
union and a Southern Confederacy arc the real
objects tbe next pretext will bo the negro sla
very question."
Such being the case, tlie Government and
loyal people of the United States expected, and
had a right to expect, the warm sympathy of
England. While our fathers were subjects of
the British crown, they were fortified in their
growing aversion to slavery, by the anti alavery
element which developed itsell with strength
and rapidity in England, in the last third of the
eighteenth century. When the slaves of the
Northern States before and during tbe revolu
tion, brought actions against their masters for
assault and battery, and for wages due for labor,
the greatest stress was laid by the counsel em
ployed to defend these actions, on ibe doctrines
inculcated by Lord Mansfield in Sommersett's
case. -In imitation of tbe scietiei formed in
England for the abolition of tbe lave trade,
Bimilar associations were formed liere. Gran
ville Sharp was in correspondence vith leading
men in this country. Mr. Jefferson wrote a let
ter to Dr. Price, thanking him for the publica
tion of an anti-slavery pamphlet
The speeches of Wilberforce fount their way
into our sclioot-Dooks the public opinion in
America, wbich began by following, wis notJong
behind that of England on this subject, and in
forming the Constitution of the Uoiteu States a
provision for the prospective of tho African
slave trade waa incorporated into the funda
mental law. The suppression of this traUc, with
the prohibition of slavery in the Territories of
tbe United States—a measure at that tine ap
proved by both sections of the country—would,
it is believed, at no distant period, Tesultin the
total abolition of slavery, to which the patriots
and statesmen of America, South as wdl as
North, looked forward as a coDsummatioi de
voutly to be wished for.
Notwithstanding these circumstances, eoujled
with the facta that slavery had been origindly
planted in tbe conntry under British authority,
and^that tbe colonial enactments against tie
African slave trade had beeu persistently nega
tived by the crown, the coutiuued existence ol
alavery in the United States was the theme of
never falling denunciation in England. On all
occasions for the discussion of tbe State ol so
ciety in tbis country in all the vehicles of pub
lie sentiment in all the literary and political
journals, alike tbe Liberal and thf Conservative,
much in tbe Edinburgh as in the Quirterly
Review in Parliament and in Exeter Rail, the
existence of slavery in the United States was
the favorite topic of censure, often bitter and
unsparing, especially after its abolition in the
British Colonies.
Not content witli the usual agencies by wbich
public opinion is influenced, ana' by layiutc tbe
entire literature of our common language under
contribution for this purpose, able speakers and
practical agitators were sent across the Atlantic
to carry the war againstshvery "into Africa
while domestic libels on public men in tbe Uni
ted States, guilty of conservative opinions, were
systematically trabsmitted and promulgated io
England, in ordrfr to be returned to this country,
as indications of publio opinion in Europe. So
uncompromising was the hostility of England to
American slavery, and ao unreserved and intol
erant in. its manifestations, that she was univer
sally regarded by tbe Southern Staten as the
most formidable of the enemies of tbeir social
system. A very leading Southern politician
now holding high offlco under the Confederacy'
Mid in my hearing, fa the Senctb of United
Statee, that there bad not been a time for ten
yeara, when ho would not have voted for a war
against Great Britain, as a great anti slavery
propagandist power. It waa the well known
opinion of Mr. Calhnun and his followets, that
among the motives wtyeh prompted the recent
colonial policy of Englacd, WM the hope that it
would tend indirectly but strongly to the sub
version of slavery fn tbe United Sbites.
Such are the antecedents on the part of Eng
land, with, which ahe approaches the existing ro
bellicn, tbe admitted consummation of proieeta
long entertained by ambltloua men, despairing
of the continued monopoly of the Government
sfthe Unfcn hitherto #psMaetd by the slave In

In the haste with which tbe British Govern
ment announced an entire absence of preference
between the two parties to the struggle, and an
intention to recognize the Confederacy as bellig
erents, tbe Americsn people have certainly been
disappointed. That tho rebellion had its origin
in slavary is just as certain as that the war of
the American Revolution had jts origin in the
claim of the Britii^ Ministry of a light to tax

Turks, and onr own conduct towards the iew

recognising them as belligerents, and u«ed the

the two countries, ss a circumstance requiring
prompt action. But tbe recognition oftbe
Greeks as belligerents, was, if I mistake not, de
layed two years, that of the South American
Republics, (between whose caw and onrs there
is but a alight analogy,) much longer and as to
any prattieal necessity for meeting the question,
no one can suppose that there WM ever a pos
sibility that the Confederate privateers would
capture British veaMls. One would have thought,
under these circumstances, that unless the for
eign governments really are entirely indifier
ent to the moral aspects of the struggle, their
decision of tbe question might have been de
layed till it WM forced upon them by eventa.
Meantime, by several of tbe lMding presses
of Frsnce and England, the utmost pains are
taken to prejudice the public mind of Europe
against the cause of the Government and of tbe
loyal people of therUnitcd States, in reference
to the war and the manner in which it is con
ducted. If the South bad been engaged in 1
crusade in favor of freedom, while the North
wu warring to perpetuate and extend slavery,
the cause of the South could not have been more
warmly pleaded by the presses that have been
denouncing slavery for the last thirty years.—

assertion that the South has the same right to

American Colonies had throw off the govern

with the South, tho war of the American Revo

of success, and which she refused to recognize

of lirope. If this relief is, st all hazards, to be
protred, it can only be by breaking the block
