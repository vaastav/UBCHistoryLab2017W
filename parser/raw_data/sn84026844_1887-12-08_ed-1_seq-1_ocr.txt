He tulU the President nomo Things the
1'ronlileut Ought to Know,
]Stbw Yobk, Dec. 7.?The Tribune of tomorrow
will contain a long interview with
Hoa. James G. Elaine, on President
Cleveland's message, It waa taken in
short-hand under tho direction of the
Tribune's Paris corre&poudont, and sent
by cable to-night. 'It is ae follows:
"I have been reading aa abstract of the
President's message, and have been especially
interested in tho comments of
tlxo London papers. Tnoae papers all a3same
to declare tho message ia a freo
trade manifesto, and ovidently are anticipating
an enlarged market for English
fabrics in tho United States aa a consaqnence
of the President's roconimonda'
tiona. Perhaps that fact stampa tho character
of the message more clearly -than
any words of mine."
A KHTKNUE TAKirF."You
don't mean actual free trade
without duty ?" queried the ropoiter.
"No," replied Mr. Blaine, "nor do the
, London papers mean that. They aimply
mean that the President has recommended
what in the United States is known as
1 a 10venue tariff, rejecting the protective
1 feature aa nn object, and not evon permit1
tine Droteclion to result fullv as an inci
dent to revenuo dntiee."
"I don't know that I quite comprehond
1 tb&t loot point," said tho reporter,
i UI mean," eaid Mr Blaino,"that for tbo
first timo in the history of the United
> States the President recommends retaining
the Internal Revenue tax in order that
the tariii may be forced down, r,von below
the fair revenue Btaudard. Ho recommends
tHM the tax on tobacco be retained,
and thua that many millions annually
shall bo levied on a coincotic product
which would far better come from a tariff
on foreign fabrics."

"Then do you mean to imply that you
would favor the repeal of the tobacco

"Certainly; I mean that," said Mr.
Blaine. I Bhould urge that it bo done at
once?even before the Christinas holidays.
It would, in the first place, bring great relief
to growers of tobacco all over the
conntry, and would lessen tho price of the
erticle to consumers. Tobicco to milliono
r, of men ia a necessity. The President calls
it a loxury, but it is a luxury in xie other
aenBO than tea and coffeo are luxuries.
NOT A LUXURY,
"It is well to remember that the luxury
"Q of yesterday becojne'a a necessity of to-day.
Watch, if you pleaso, the number of men
i at work on tho farm, in the coal mines,

"Bat after the fortifications had been

with the epecliiv object of lightening tite
tax on real estate. Tho houaea and
farms of tho wl^olo country pay too
large a proportion of the total
taxes. If, ultimately, relief could
be given in that direction it would in my
j udgment ba a wise and beneficent policy,
ciomo honest, but misguided frieud3 of
temperance have urged that the Government
should not uau tho money derived
from the tar on whioky. My reply is that
the tax on whisky by tho Federal Government
with its suppression of
all illicit distillation and cocoequont
enhancement of price, has
been a powerful agent in temperance
reform by putting it beyond tho reach of
bo many. Tho amount of whisky consumed
in the United States per capita today
is not.more than 40 p&r C8nt of that
consumed forty years ego." .
After a few moments silence, Mr. Elaino
added that in his judgment the
whisky tax should bo bo modifiod as to
permit all who use pure alcohol in the arta
or mechanical pursuits, to have it free of
tax. In all such caeca the tax could be
omitted without dauger of fraud, just as
now the tax on spirits exported is remitted.

"Besides your general and sweeping opposition
to the President's recommendations,
have you any further apecitic objaction
?"
14Yes,"answered Mr. Blaine; "Ishould
seriously object to the repeal of tho duty
on wool. To repeal that would work great
injnBtico to many interests and would boriously
discourage what we should
earnestly encourage, ' namely: the
aheep culture among tho farmers
thronghout tho Union. To breakdown
wool growing and ba dependent on foreign
countries for the blanket under which W6
sleep and the coat that covers our backs is
not vcieo policy for the National Government
to enforce."
"Do you think if the President's recommendations
were adopted it would increase
our export trade?"
"Possibly in some law articles of peculiar
construction it might, but it would increaee
onr import trade ten fold as much
in tho great staple fabrics, in woolen and
cotton goods, in iron, in steel, in all tho
thousand and one shapes in which they
are wrought."

And how are we to manufacture tbera
cheaper than they do in Europe, unless
we get cheaper labor than they have in
Europe 7"
"Then you think that the question of
labor underlies the wholA subject?"
' Of courEo it doeB," replied Mr. lilaine.
"It ia in fact the entire question. Whenever
we can forco csrpentera, maeorft,
iron workers and mechanics in every
department to work oa cheaply and live as
poorly in the United States as similar
workmen of Earope, we can, cf coarse,
manufacture just as cheaply as they do in
England and France. But I am totally
opposed to a policy that would entail such
results. To attempt it is equivalent to a
social and financial revolution, one that
would bring untold distil."
' Yob, bat might not tho great farming
i class be benefitted by importing articles
1 from Europe Instead of buying them at
higher prices at home."
i'hs moment," answered Mr. Blalno,
"you begin to import ireely from Europe
you drive our own workmen from mechanical
and manufacturing pursuits,
in the same proportion they become tillers
of soil, increasing steadily the agricultural
product and decreasing steadily the
largo Home demand, which' ia constantly
enlarging as home manufacturers enlarge.
That, of course, works great injury'to the
farmer, glutting the market witn nia products
and lending constantly to lower

"Yes, but the foreign demand for farm

questions which my dietinguishod predecessor
deomed to bo of mobt pressing importance,
and to them he devoted a lurge
part of his two annual reports, tie stated
honest convictions with a vigor and holdDees
which, together with tho ability and
fairness that he thowed in the Konural
management of thid department, hare
given him a high place among statesmen
and financiers.
I find tne eame subjects to bo fitill the
most important of all ihose to which it is
my duty to call your attention, and it is
not neceeaary to do otherwise than follow
the general lineslaiddownby him in treating
tbsrn. UiroumajanctB have heightened
the immediate urgency of tarntion reform
aa affecting tho turpluo revenues of the
Government. The urgency iu so groat that
the question cf eurplus revenues demania
tho earnest attention of both the
legislative and executive branches of the
Government."
T1IE REMEDY,
Ho gives tho following ways in which
tho receipts and expenditures of tffe Government
can be made about equal:
First?The purchase of the interest bearing
dubt of the Government.
tiecond?Largor expenditures by the
Government far other purposes than the
purchase of bonds, so that they shall each
year equal the taxation of that year..
Third?Induction of the revenue from
taxation to the amount actually required
to meet necessary expenses.
All of these expedients have in common
the one merit of preventing the derangement
to bneiiieea which muat follow hoarding
or locking up in the Treasury tho circulating
media of the people.
Ia regard to the tirat plan the Sccrotcry
agruoo: with what the President int his
mueuage said on the eamo cubject.
Ho tuen says: "I cannot believe that it
will adopt the eecond expedient, viz: tho
enlargement of the Government expenso
simply. to expend the money raised by
tax .Hon when tho public weal doca not
otherwise call for the expenditure."
TUX INTEUNAL KET?SDK.
Reduction of tho rovenue from taxation
i3 the only lit remedy for the ilia which
threaten tho country. This may be acplished
in various wayo.
Ono ia tocreduce or aboliah internal revenue
taxation. In favor of this ia tho fact
that in a small part of the Southern Statea
the internal tax on liquors and tobacco io
thought to b& oppreeeive and ia odious to
the people of tho-ae regioua; and the
further fact that by ita reduction the expenses
of its collection might be somewhat
reduced.;
Tho chief cause for theprfjudice against
this tax seetna to be that aa there was no
Buch tux belore the war lor tho (Jnion it
is looked upon as a reminder of tliu measures
adopted to raise money to carry on
the war, and which ought not to be continued
in time of peace, and aa interfering
in some way with tho natural rights of
mankind to grow grain and tobacco and
manufacture therefrom cig&ra, snuff and
the various forms of merchantable tobacco.
Of course taxation of whisky and tobacco
trespasses no mere upon the natural
rights of man than does tho taxation of
his clothing or his bedding or every implement
which ho uses in the cultivation
of his grain end tobacco and in the distillation
or manufacture of the same.
YOU TASKS YCUn CUOICE.
The burden of tho one tax is direct,
known as fixed; the whole of it goes into
the Government's treasury; tho burden
of tho other is indirect and unknown and
nnlv ft nortion of itnnmon
It reaches the farmer or distiller increased
by the profit upon itself,which overy iperchant
rnuBt take aa the clothing or tools
puss through his hands on their journey
to them from the foreign or domestic
manufacture. Taxation there must be;
the choice ia between tho kinds of tarntion;
each man can decide for himself, if
he will examine .the subject free from
prejudice which is the leaat business for
nim, for his family and for hia neighbora
and which ia in tho end better
for his wholo couutxy. That internal tax
ation of spirits and tobacco began during
the war ia not a reason it should be done
away with now, if it be in itself wise. So
also tho fact that the rates of custom taxation
raised during tho same war are
higher than ever before in our history,
and have been continued until now,
ought not to determine the manner of
their treatment; this should r ther depend
upon what ia just and expedient at
the present time.
HKOOCE THE TAItlFtf.
In the revenue from cuatomB taxation
is where the roduction ia to l)o made, and
while reducing, advantage should be
taken of the opportunity to reform the
abuses and inequalities of the tariff lawa,
Add to the free trado list as many articles
as possible. Reduco duties upon every
dutiablo article to the lowest point possible;
but in ascertaining these .possibilities
tho present situation of labor and business
mUBt always he kept in mind.
One argument ferged in favor of the
j continuance of the present highly profurtive
tariff wotlld. if admittm! tn Ko
establish tue claim that the ranjority of
the labor and people of this country have
made a compact with'the minority that
the majority will pay the minority more
for certain aiticlea, to be mado by' the
latter,'than the price at which tho people
of other countries are willing to Bull the
same; that the evidence of this ia found
in our tariff lawn which have kept duties
at a highly protective rate aince early in
the war, aud in the continued existence
of those laws for so long a time: and that
under these conditions many laboring
men have become bo employee! in certain
industries that it might be difficult for
thorn at once to get other work.
After paying due regard to all thoBe
equities, after providing for due observance
of every obligation, it will be found
that great reductions can be made in tariff
taxation. So many compensations will be
thereby given to this and that industry
that most of them will find themselves in

says: Judge Sabin, of tho United
States District Court yesterday rendered
his decision in tho noted habeas corpus
c&aeof RobortC. Stockston, the Kansas
City drnmmor who was arrested early in
November at Tyler, Tex., for a failure to
exhibit his receipt fc) the constable showing
that he had paid the Controller of the
State the annual occnpation tex of $35
levied on all traveling salesmen. The
case wasotkrongly contested by the S ato,
Attorney General Hogg appearing in person.
JudgeSabin'sopinion is exhaustive,
reviews the history ot the case in detail
and oustains Stocketon'e petition in every
particular. The language ef the court
ia declaring the law unconstitutional ia
very strong. It is doubtful if any fedoral
court in tbo country has so vigorously denounced
the attempt of tho States to tux
inter-State commerce by requiring drummers
to take out a license. The court
grounds its decision upon the ancient
piinc'plo of no taxation without representation,
and saya: "What representation
has the citizen of one State in the
laws of another affecting hia commerce
therein? Precisely none._ If a State can
make a tax at all upon inter-Stata commnviiA

The court employs the following IonRange
in conclusion: "The idea of a citizen
of the United 8tates being challenged
anywhere in thia nation, by any
power other than national, in the conduct
of his lawful busineeo, in States other thau
liis own, is dfridedly absurd and ridiculocs.
The law in question ia utterly void,
bo far as it aflVcta tne commerce of citizens

A RINGING ANSWER
FROM AMERICAN WOOL GROWERS
To the 1'reildent'fl Attack upon their Indus*
try-The E*al?ltjr of hli Premises and
Unsoundness of his Conclusions
Shawn?The Spirit of his Essay.
Wasuinutox, D. 0., Dcc. 7,?At to day's
session ct the conference at wool growers
and wool dealers of the United States,
called by the Frosldonl ol the National
Association ol Wool Growers, the following
was unanimously adopted:
The wool dealers and wool growers of
the United titates, representing a capital
of ovor live hundred millions of dollars,
and a constitnoncv of a million wn.tl
I growers unci wool dealers, aesemblod in
conference in tho city of Washington, the
7th day of December, 1887, having read
the first annual mecsago of the Prosident
| to the Fiftieth Oougross, declare that the
sentiments of the message are a direct attack
upon their industry, one of tho moat
I important of tho country, and in positive
violation of tho National Domocratic
platform of 1881, as interpreted by the
I party leaders, and accepted by the rank
and lite of the party: that the argument
made by tho President for the romoval
of our protection against foroign competition
is tho. old one, repeatedly made by
the oneroies of our industrial progress,
and effectively answered in nearly every
school district of our land, and bo thoroughly
disapproved by the logic of facts
and demonstration of expcrionce and history
ns to need no answer from us. We
acknowledge that our "small holdings,"
our scattered and unorganized condition,
make lib the prey of the free trader, but
we had a right to expect something different
from the Chief Executive oi the
nation at once the moet happy, prosperous
uutl contented of any of the world, made
so by a policy of protection and develop*
ment which he now seeks to destroy.
We had a right to expect our President
would lavor the wool growers of the
United States, and wo confess our deep
disappointment that instead, he favors the
IU101CDMJ Ol UU1 lUIDI^U
Justly alarmed at liio position, wa make
an appeal from iiis recommendation to
the people, to all the people, to the seven
and three-fourths millions ol onr fellow
citizens engaged in agriculture, to the millions
engaged in manufacturing, to the
Army of wage earners, whose wages ore
maintained by the protGctive system, to
the tradesmen and merchants whose pros*
perity depends upon ours, conlldent that
the judgment and decision will be based
upoa justice and patriotism, and therefore
for the maintainnacceof the American
policy of protection to which the country
to indebted for its uuexampled development
and prosperity.
To demonstrate the injustice of the
President's policy, and the fallacy of the
remedy he proposes for tho reduction of
the surplus, we point to the fact that if
the whole amount of tho revenue derived
from wool was abolished it would reduce
the sarplnB only about fivo million dollars,
or less than ten cents per capita of the
population, which ia paid by foreigners,
while the old war taxes he recommonds
retained yield over one hundred and
nineteen million dollars and are a direct tax
per capita of two dollars each, and what
makes up the great bulk of the ourplus of
ono hundred and lorty million dollars, and
which fosterB a most dangerous monopoly.
We would further add the following
siatistica in regard to the wool industry:
The annual revenue derived from imports
oi wool under tho tariff of 1867
was less than $1,700,000. Under the reduced
tariff of '83, the revenue last year
was over five millions.
The namher of sheoo in the country in
'S4, waa 50,026.020; in '87, 44,759,314, a
decrease of nearly six millions, and a diminution
of the annual wool product of
over 35.000,000 pounds, thus showing that
reducing the tariff by the act of '83 has increased
the revenue from imported wools
and diminished tho number of sheep in
the United States about 12 per cent, and
the annual product in tho same proportion.
The President's policy would bring
about the destruction of this industry,
and the Bame policy of reduction or abolition
of tho tarifl would end in disaster to
all other industrial productive enterprises
of the country.

ported that General Bragg, of Wisconsin,
ia booked for the Mexican Ministry.
Bragg is troublesome in Wisconsin politics,
unless ho haa a position, and PoBtmaater
General Vilas ia anxious to have him
cared for.
The only objection to the appointmont
ie said to be trie fiery temper of the old
man. The experience of the administration
with the Muxicaa MiniBtry has been
eo unpleasant that it is deairablo great
care should be exercised to select some
one who will not immediately get into
trouble with the greaaera.
Ho Think* Dan la Too Cautions,
Nkw Yobk, Dec. 7.?A. Washington ape*
cial to the World says, concerning the fore*
cast of the President's message published
in that paper, that in discussing tho mat* 1
ter with a prominent official yosterdoy the
President aaid: "I presume the World ob*
tained its information from orf& of the
leading public men with whom I have
diecueaeii the subject of the message. Por
my part, I do not aee what necessity there
is for keeping these meeaoges eo profoundly
secret, aside from the simple question ,
of caurteav to Con crew. I hnva tnlcl flnl.
Lamout that I don't understand why ho
should, take to much trouble with my messages.
If ho would let me have my way,"
continued the Presidont, "I presume I
would give the whole thing to the first
clever fellow who should ask for it."

Donelaon ia looking very palo and anxious,
and his friends are doing everything poesiblo
to prevent an investigation of hia accounta

Saturday night, it was charged will show
a large deficit. Tho Republicans seem determined
to have au investigation, but
the Democrats are equally determined to
prevent it. Those Democrats who have
been assaulting Mr. Donelson's character
and record say that they are satisfied with
defeating his re-election and do not-caro
to diacuea the subject any further. It ia

Key. Dr. A. J. Lyda, of Charleston,
formerly for a number of yoars a resident
of this city, arrived here yeaterday and
registered at the Stamm Houso. At tho
last meeting of the West Virginia Conference
of tho M. E. Church, and after it had
been finally decided to establish and
maintain a Conference Seminary at Buckhannon,
Itev. Dr. Lyda waachoeon to fill
the position of financial agent. Since then
he has been baaily engaged in working
for the Seminary. Ho ia hero at this
time on that business and proposes to remain
for two or threo weeka soliciting assistance
for tho new institution. Tnia is
the first vieit to this section of tho 8tate
on such an errand, and he is greatly en
uouragea over trie outioo*. Several good
subscriptions were made and promised in
the Bhort timo he spent circulating around
yesterday, boing secured without any
effort scarcely on his part. He was about
among hia frienda yesterday more for the
purpose of renewing old acquaintances
than for soliciting aid for the seminary.
Dr. Lyda has been about iu tho lower
part of the State considerably of late and
has had good success in securing subscriptions.
Up to date about $1.7,000 has beeu
given to the institution. The site for the
Seminary at Backbannon is said to be
admirably located. Men are engaged this
winter quarrying Btono for the foundations.
Wo plan for a building has yet been
selected by tbe committe having the matter
in charge, but they will attend to that
in time to have the building commenced
early in the spring. Tbe building will
probably cost about $25,000, and
thiB, it is thought, will be commodious
pnough to snffica for a number of years to
come. It ia hoped to have tho building
ready for occupancy early in the fall, bo
that students can be received for a regular
fall term. Ab yet no faculty has been
chosen, although thorn lias been received
a large number of applications. Br. Lyda

That 1b to Wlu tho Pennant for Wheeling
Completed.
President Seoley, of the Wheeling Base
Ball Association, received a letter yesterday
from Manager Buckenberger, announcing
that he bad completed the Wheeling
team for the Ohio Loague contest of '88 by
aigning as left fielder the efficient member
of last season's Kalamfjoo team who
played in that position, Brodie. This
makes a toacn that it will be hard to beat.
Buckenberger is evidently a jewel of a
manager; he is full of enthusiasm, and
confident of downing all competitors
next year. His selection was a happy one,
and the officers of the Association deserve
the thanks of all lovers of tho national
game for securing him.
The season will open early and brilliantly
on the home grounds. Buckenberger
writes that he has secured the
Buffalo nine for exhibition games on April
11 and 12, has booked two games with
Detroit for dates not yet fixed, and is negotiating
with Pittsburgh. He aleo has
offers from Cleveland and Toronto.

The 1'llnt Gtaaa Situation.
It is reported at Pittsburgh that there

The fact that the general atriko was

and his impudent dlareRflrd c( the

mending and furthering certain modifications
of Bulgaria's policy, Russia has long
remained aingularly passive; but it io now
believed that tho timo is near at hand
when tho Bulgarian question must bo
finally settled. Settlement of the question
In Russia's favor?aud it eeems impoHaU^-^.- .
ble that it can in tho ond be settled otherwise?involves
Prince Ferdinand's batty
exit irom Bulgaria, and, this being plainly
apparent to him, has led him to appoal to
Austria and Eugland to "preserve the
poace."
Austria would not for a moment think
of going to war with Rueeia single-handed,
and England haa no mind to bait the Ruseian
bear to uphold the questionable
right of one of Queen Victoria's pets to
rule a. DeODlfl With \chni?n intHTPotn thn
English people have nothing in common.
Nor is it belioved that Germany iaover
anxious to wage war against Russia on the
slight pretext afforded by the lattor's insiatance
upon her rights in the Balkans,
and especially in view of the almost abpolute
certainty that the assistance to the
Czar of the now greatly strengthened
French Republic can bo had lor the asking.
.The reopening of the Bulgarian question,
which now seems imminent, will
doubtless be accompanied by the bloat r
and shower of diplomatic notes that have
charactered the former attempts to ?Hbpoae
of the matter, but it iB reason* bly
safe to predict that there will be very
little blood spilled; that Bulgaria will in
the end be ruled by a Russian Governor,
or a Prince whose nominatiou secured
Russian approval, and that' Austria and
Germany will express themselves as satisfled
with the result whether they feel that

A Purely Defensive Movement.
Paris, Dec. 7.?According to private advices
from Warsaw the massing of Russian
troops on the frontier is attributable to information
received by Russia of a concerted
plan by Germany and Austiiafor
united action in the event of a war between
either of these powers and Asia.
In that contingency it was proposed that
Germany and Austria should suddenly
invade Russian Poland and occupy Warsaw
by using their greater facilities for
mobilizing. In consequence of the discovery
of this alleged proiect Russia re
solved to compensate for >lier Blow power
of mobilizing by a permanent increase of
ber frontier forces. The movement implies
no aggression, but iB a purely defensive
