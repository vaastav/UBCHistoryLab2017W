PRESIDENTS
MESSAGE READ
TO CONGRESS
Simplification of Tax Sys
tem is Strongly Recom
mended.
Peace Treaty With Germany
Is Not Discussed at
Length.
Washington, Dec.
2.—General
For the second time only, since the
president established the practice of
addressing congress in person, his
message today was read by the
clerks.
Wb Recommendations.
The president's principal recom
mendations were:
Establishment of a budget system
for the national finances.
Reorganization of the taxation sys
tem tprith simplification of the Income
and excess profits.
Readjustment of the tariff system,
if' necessary, to meet changed world
Conditions and make the system con
form with the fact that the United
8tates Is "the greatest capitalist in
the world."
Recognition and relief for., veteran
soldiers of .the world war, particularly
in the way of government farms aa
proposed by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dyeT
stuffs .^ndustipr built up during the
war. to keep rthe United States inde
pendent of foreign supply.
An .enlarged, progranj tov
Lxyura\
agitators. With the return
to normal conditions this unrest will
rapidly disappear."
The president renewed his recom
mendations for legislation* to deal ef
fectively with "those persons who by
violent methods would abrogate our
time-tested institutions."
Several recommendations, some re.
newals of previous ones, were made
by ther president to bring down the
cost of living. Among them were ex
tension of the' food control ilaw to
peace times for the emergency reg
ulations for transportation of foods
In Interstate commerce a cold stor
iii
to show, the length of time foods are
kept in storage-anjl' a law to '^secure
competitive selling and prevent -un
conscionable profits" by federal li
cense of corporations selling food in
interstate commerce.
Discusses l«bor Question.
A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the con
dition and rights of labor. "A defin
ite program to bring about an Im
provement in the conditions of labor"
and bring about a genuine 'demo
cratization of industry was recom
mended.
'The only way to keep men from
agitating against p-rievances is to re-
move the grievances," said the presi
dent's message. At another point it
declared "the seed of revolution is re
pression."
'The establishment at the prin
ciples regarding labor, laid down in
the covenant of the League of Na
tions," said the message, "offered us
the way. to industrial peace and con
ciliation.. No other road lies open to
us.
"The right of individuals to strike
is inviolate," continued the message,
"and ought not to be interfered with
by any process of government, but
there is a predominant right and that
