Tur scientilc world is going to have an
other nut to crack in the proposition of a
Smlthsonian Institute savant in the New

cradle of the primordial germ of life. It has
hitherto been alleged and the proposition
sustained by the fossils that life began In
the far North when It was a tropleal cotn
try. This, of course, onte-dated the catas
clyst which established the present zones,
but the nestitute scholar may have gone a
few thousand years back of that and discov
ered evidences that will substantiate his the

supplanting the use of gold with silver car
tificates, which would seriously disturb com
merce and impair the National credit. Thii
is a matter that very seriously effects Mon
I tens, and although a great deal of considers
lion appears to be bestowed upon the effect
It will have on the silver producing regions,
and it is argued that ultimate good will
come of the immediate depression, we ap
prehend that legislation adverse to the silvel
mining interests of Montana, with othel
communities, will result. Secretary Mc.
Cullough says :
After giving the subject ca.reful eonsideras
tien, i have been forced to the conclucioe
that, unless the coinage of silver dollars and
the issue of silver certallcates is suspended,
there is danger that silver, and not gold, way
become our metallic standard. The dauger
may not be imminent, but it in of so serio.LI
a character that there ought not to be any
delay in providing against it. Not only
would the national credit be seriously im
paired if the government should be under
the necessity of using silver dollars or certi
ficates in the a ment of gold certificates,
but business of all kinds would be greatly
disturbed; not only so, but gold would at
once cease to be a circulating medium, and a
severe oontraetion would be sure to result.
The United States is one of the most power
ful of natiens. Its credit is high, its resour
ces unlimited, but it cannot prevent a deore
elation of silver unless its efforts are alied
by the leading nations of Europe. If the
coinage of silver is'continued in spite of the
action of Germany demonetizing it, and the
limitation of its coinage by what are known
as the Latin nations, there can be but one
result-silver will practically become the
standard of value. Our mines produce large
amounts of silver, and it is important, there
fore, that there should be a good demand at
remunerative prices for the outlays in ob
tainin it. The suspension of its coinage
might depres the market price of silver for
a time, but the ultimate effect would doubt
less be to enhance it. The metal which Ori
ental nations and some Western nations use
exclusively for coin-and all ons to some
extent-which costs, in the lhebr and capital
required to extract it from the mines more
than its standard value as coin, cannot be
permanently degraded by artificial means.
The production of gold is diminishing; that
of silver has practically reached its maxi
mum, and there are strong indications that
from this time the yield ot both gold and sil
ver mines will speedily decline. At the same
time the demand for both for coinage and in
manufactures will increase. The very neces
sities of a commercial world will prevents
general and continued disuse of either as
money. The European natiens which hold
that large amounts of silver must sooner or
later come to its rescue, and the suspension
of coinage in the United States would de
much to bring about, on their part, action in
its favor. But whatever might be the effect
of the suspension of coinage upon the com
mercial value of silver, it is very clear that
the coinage cannot be continued without
detriment to general business and danger to
the nattenal credit.
These arguments, however faulty we
may regard them, will .undoubtedly be
urged in Congress with a view to securing
the immediate suspension of silver coinage
and the issuance of silver certificates, while
as a means of relieving the treasury of silver
now in the vaults, theSecretary recommends
that all present outstanding one dollar and
two dollar notes, amounting to about fifty
four million dollars, be withdrawn from cir
culation, oempelling the use of silver to a
large extent in their stead. He ever goes so
far as to sugges the gradual retirement of
all five dollar notes, and the coinage of bhrl
ad quarter eagles In their stead, so that
eventually all the circulating medium below
1l0 would be in cola. These measures
would not, however, help the silver produ
cing regions materially, as it is proposed to
stop the eoloage of slver, and the dollar
sent out to superede the small bills wouald
merely be a portion of the accumulation
now in thetreasury. It is true Lthe President
suggests reciprocal relations benlog estab
lished with the other countries of America,
which would lncrease the commercial tras
ectio of eab, and that as some of tlhem dc
not produce the noble metals, a uniform car
rency ad vtly lncreased transactions might
result in the remonetizrtion of silver and
evlval of the lidnstry; but even if that bis
co.smmated therew moust be a tedious laps

saturated with the various mineral substan

in any quantity. Even the best of this dan

IIIxroN, W. Va., Nov. 28.-The rumors
of a plague in the extreme southern part of

The center of the afflicted district is in the
center -"f Dickinson county, Virginia, in the
midst of the Cumberland Mountains, and
over 100 miles from the nearest railway sta

cold weather is sure to cause such mortality
as even the present state of affairs has not
begun to equal. The last rainfall was on
August 3d, unless It has fallen within a
week. The last person arriving here from
that section was a commercial traveler for a
Baltimore house, who left Leesburg one
week ago yesterday. He says business is at
a standstill, and crops a failure. Many fam

live stock left. Medicines are exhausted,
and physicians are nearly all dead from

* The Origin of Life.
NEW Yous, Nov. 28.-The TrIbune prints
a curlous and novel contribution to selentlsc
laquiryV, concerning the origin of life on this
planet, from an eminent writer connected
with theim Smlteonian Institute, of whichb it
says, editorially: "The writer locates the
primordial germ at the South pole. The
assumption is certainly entirely reasonable
that the begnninog of life would depend upon
chemical conditlons, and would appear wher
ever on the face of the earth the first suits
ble tempersature might occur. The lose of
beat at the poles would eventually drive it
toward the equator, but the primordial germs
were there, and the beginning Lat the South
pole rather than at the North pole. No in
telligeont reader can fail to perceive the Im
protant bearing which the letter ha, upon
cienttife investigation In the two polar
bemos. If this reasoning be valid, there is
no quarter of the earth where there is so
mech to be learned reepectlng the origin of
lif as the undiscovered verge of thbe arctic

relates to the sale and shipment of explo.
sives likely to be used against the peace and
welfare of a friendly power. The text is as
rillows:
S"I recommend that the scope of the neu
trality laws of the United States be so en
larged as to cover all patent acts of hostility
committed in our Terrntory and aimed
against the people of a friendly nation. Ex
lating statutes prohibit the fitting out of
armed expeditiens and restrict the shipment
of exploeives, though the enactments In the
latter respect were not framed in regard to
international obligations but simply for the
protection of passenger travel; and these
statutes were intended to meet special emer.
gencies that bad already arisen. Other
emergencies have arisen since and modern
ingenuity supplies means for the organiza
tion of hostilities without open resort to
armed vessels or to ilibustering parties. I
see no reason why the commission of crimi
nal acts such as are here under considera
tion, should not be alike punishable whether
such sets are intended to be committed in
our own country or in a foreign country
with which we are at peace. The prompt
and thorough treatment of this question is
one which intimately concerns the national
honer."
NATURALIZATION LAWS.
After referring to the aoeolute character of
some portions of the naturalization laws, the
President adds:
'"A uniform rule of naturalization, such as
the constitution contemplates, should among
other things clearly define the status of per
sons, born within the United States subject
to a foreign power and of minor children of
fathers who have declared their intention of
becoming citizens but have failed to perfect
their naturalization. It might be wise to
provide for a central bureau for registry
wherein should be filed authenticated trans
cripts of every record of naturalization in
the several federal and State courts, and to
make provisions also for the vacation or can
cellation of such record in case where fraud
had been practiced upon the court by the
applicant himself, or where he had removed
or forfeited his acquired citizenship. A just
and uniform law In this respect would
strengthen the hands of the government in
protecting its citizens abroad and would pave
the way for the conclusion of treaties of
naturalization with foreign countries."
FINANCIAL MATTZBI.
"The condition of our finances and the
operations of the various branches of the
public service which are connected with the
treasury department are very fully discussed
in the report of the secretary. It appears
that the ordinary revenues for the faeal-pear,
ended June 80, 1884, were: From customs,
$195,067,489.76; from internal revenue,
$121,586,072.51; from all other sources, $81,,
866,807.05; total ordinary revennes, $348,
419,OOU.02. The public expenditures during
tbe same period were: For civil expenses,
$22,812,907.71; for foreign intercourse, $1,
260,766.32; for Indians, $0,475 ,00999.29; for
pensions, $55,429,228.380; for t%~tbiliary e.
tabllshments, including river and harbor im
provements and arsenals, $39,429,608.36; for
the naval establishment, including vessels,
machinery and improvements at navy yards,
$17,292,001.44; for miscellaneous expendi
tures including public buildings, light
houses and collecting the revenue, $43,689,:
710; for expenditures on account of the Dis
trict of Columbia, $3,410,049.62; for interest
on the public debt, $54,578,378.48; for the
sinking fund, $46,790,229.50; total ordinary
expenditures, $290,910,488.83; leaving a sur
plus of $57,603,896.09. As compared with
the previous fiscal year, there was a net de
crease of over $21,000,000 in the amount of
b.penditures. The aggregate receipts were
less than those of the year previous by about
$64,000,000. The falling off of revenue for
customs made up nearly $20,000,000 of this
deeficlency and about $80,000,000 of the re
mainder was due to the dimishbed receipts
from internal taxatlon. The secretary estl
mates the total receipts for the fiscal year
which will end June 30th, 1885, at $330,600,
000, and the total expenditures at $290,620,
201.16, in which are included the interest on
the debt and the amount payable to the sink
Ing fund. This would leave a surplus for
the e.,tre year of $8,000,000. The value of
exports from the United States to foreign
countries during the year ending June 80th,
1884, was as follow: Domestic merchan
dise, $724964,852; foreign merchandise, $15,
548,727; total merchandise, $740,518,609;
specie, $67,1838,88; total exports of meran
dise and specie, $07,66,992. The cotton
and eotton manufaetures included in this
statement were valued at $206,000,415; the
breadatuffs as $18,544,715; the provisions at
$114,416,547 and the:mineral oils at $147,
108,748. During the same period the im
ports were as fllows: Merchandise, 9607,
007,68; gold and silver, $37,426,268; total,
$705,128,955. More than 68 per cent. of the
entire value of imported merchandise con
slsted of the following articles: sugar and
molasses, $10,844,214; wool and woolen
maeulaetures, $8,542,99; silk sad its

The expense of the War Depertment have
been decreased 18,000,000, principally In the
River and Harbor and Quartermaster's De
partments. The cost of supplylag draught
and pack anialls alone is $1,106.8 less than
In 1882. Thi removal of Oklahoma Payne's
Indian Territory Intrudes is referred to.
There have not been any indian outbreaks
during the past year.
PRJTOCTION OF 85ABABRD CITIES.
The President calls attention to the de
fenseless condition of our seaboard cities,
the destruction of which would be a national
humiliation. He believes the time has ar
rived in the perfection of methods of defense
when they can be made adequate, and ree
ommends the gradual oependiture of 860,
000,006 for that purpose, "a sum much less
than a victorious enemy could levy as a con
tribution." An appropriation of one-tenth
that sum is asked for immediate use. He
also renews his recommendations tbat pri
vate steel works with facilities adequate for
the production of cannon material be on
eeuraged, and that two government factories,
one for the army and one for the navy, be
established for the fabrication of guns from
such materials. The progress made on the
steel cruisers authorized in 1862-3 by acts of
Congress, is referred to, and attention called
to the lack of appropriation to um the
double-turreted monitors.
Considerable space is devoted tothe Gree
ly expedition, and the President says in
relation to
TER NAVY:
"In this, the last of the state messages
that I shall have the honor to transmit to
the Congress of the United States, 1 cannot
too strongly urge on their attention the duty
of restoring our navy as rapidly as possible
to the high state of efficiency which former
ly characterized it. As the long pea-e that
has lulled as into a sense of fancied security
may at any time be disturbed, it is plain
that the policy of strengthening this arm of
the service is dictated by considerations of
use, economy, of just regard for our future
tranquility, and of a true appreciation of the
digity and honor of the republic."
THE POSTAL SYSTNM.
The reduction in the revenue of the post
ofice department by the reduction of letter
postage from three cents to two cents, has
proved to be only $2,275,000 when it was
estimated It would be $3,000,000. It is now
recommended that the rate on "drop letters"
be reduced from two cents to one cent; that
the unit of weight be "one ounce" instead of
"one-half ounce" as at present; and that the
free delivery system, which is in force In
159 cities, be extended. He also suggests
that a means for enabling the exceptional
dispatch of letters at a higher rate of postage
be devised so as to shot off private express
companies.
WITNri. AND JURYf !r8.
The Attorney General renews the recom
mendation contained In his report of last
year touching the fees of witnesses and
Jurors. He favors radical changes in the
fee bill; the adoption of a system by' which
attorneys and marshals of the United States
should be compensated solely bIy salaries;
and the erection by the Government of a,
penitentiary for the confinement of offenders
against th i laws.
Of the varied Governmental concerns In
charge of the Interior Department, the re
ports of its Secretary present an Interesting
summary. Among the topics deserving par.
ticular attention, I refer you to his observa
tions respecting our Indian affairs, the pre
emption andl.amber culture acts, the failure
of railroad companies to take title to lands
granted by the government, anid the opera
tions of the pensl.o fice, the patent ofiee,
the eunsus bureau, and the bureau of educea
dion.
PUBLIC LANDS AND POLYGAMY.
The Secretary of Interior urges anew the
enactment of a statute for the punishment of
crimes committed on Indian reservations,
ansd recommends the passage of the bill now
pending in the House of Representatives for
the purchase of a tract of 1,800 square miles
from the Sioux reservation. Bth these
measures are worthy of approval. I concur
with blm also in advising the repeal of the
pre-emption law, the ensetment of statute
resolving the present legal complications
touching lapsed grants to ralroad companesio
and the funding of the debt of the several
Pacific railroads under such guaranty as
shall effectually Insure its ultimate pay.
ment.
The report of the Utah commission will
he read with interest. It discleses the re%
suits of recent legislation looking to the
presentat!on and punishment of polygamy in
that Territory. I still believe that that
abominable practice can e suppressed by
law, it can only be by the most radical legis
ration consistent with the restraints of tihe
constltution. I again recommenad, there
fore, that Congres eassume absolute political
control of the territory of Utah, and provide
for the appointment of a commission with
such governmental power as in Its judgment
may justify and wisely be put into their
hands.

Nearly all the plunder was found in his
