The report of the r-t ere tarv of the Interior
exhibits the transaction of the (ioverumeiit
with the Indian tribes Substantial prog
1 es-has been made in the education of the
childteit of -rhool age and in the allotment
of land-to adult Indians. It i to be ie
grrtted that the poluy ot breaking up the
tribal lelatum ami of dealing with the
Indian as an individual did not appear
earlier in our legislation. Large reserva
tions held in common, ami the ma in ten nice
of the authority of the chief and head men
have deprived the individual (if evcrv m
c ntive to the cxerciseof thrift, and tile an
unity has contributed an nffirmativ e impulse
toward a state of continued pauperism.
Our treat j -t'pulation should be highlj'ron
suleiate of the best interest of an ignorant
and helples- people. The re.-crvations are

in the pith day of Aprfl last I appointed

Warner, of Mis-ouri, and Major-ticneinl

commissioner under the last-named lavy.
Tiny were, how ever, authorized and directed

of Hon. Lucius Kairehild. of Wi'scom-in;
Hon. John K. H.irtranft.of Pennsjlvaina, ami

no definite results. Ccneral John F. Hart
rauft. of Pen 11 vi lvania, was jirevcnted by ill
health from taking part in the conference.
Hi deatii which occurred recently i justly
andgenerallv lamented by a people he hail
served with "conspicuous gallantrj- in war
and with great tidelity In peace. The va
cancy thus created was tilled b the appoint
ment of Hon. Warren C Sayre, of Indiana.
A second conference between the commis
sion and tho Cherokees was begun Novem
ber;, but no result- have yet been obtained,
nor 1 it believed that a conclusion can be
immediately expected. The cattle syndicate
now occupying the lands for grazing pur
poses is tlr.irlv one of theagcncie responsi
ble for the obstruction of our ne-utiations
with the Cherokee,. The large body of
agricultural lands, constituting what is
known as the "Cherokee outlet." ought not
tu be, and, indeed, can not long be, held for
grazing and for the advantage of a few
aainst the public interest ind the best
advantage of Ihe Indians them
selves. The Tnited States has under
tin treatie certain rights in the-e land.
These will not be Used oppresivelj but it
can not be allowed that those who bv suffer
anee occupy the-e lands -shall interpose to
