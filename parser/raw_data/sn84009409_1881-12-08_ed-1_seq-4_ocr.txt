HOCSE.
The aaaembling of the first regular

the effect of drawing to the capitol a
vast number of visitors. By 11 o'clock
every seat in the gallery of the bouse

Keifer stood for a short time in the
rear of the desk, and waa warmly con
gratulated by bis colleague* upon bia

At noon Clerk of the House Adams

Those voting for Ford were Br.imm,
Borrows (Missouri) Hasleton, Jones
(Texas,) Ladd, Mosgrove, Murch and
Rice (Missouri ) None of the candi
date* voted. Fulkersoo and Paul, Vir

Tho result having been announced,
Keifer was escorted to the speaker's
eh air by Messrs. Randall and Hiscock,
and took the oath of office, which was
administered by Mr. Kelly, of Penn
aylvania, as the oldest member in poiot
of servioe.
The speaker stated that the roll of
the house waa completed, and that the
next business in order was the election
of a clerk. Mr. Robeson, of New Jer
sey, nominated Edward McPherson, of
Pennsylvania; Mr. House, of Tennes
see, George M. Adams, of Kentucky,
and Mr. Murch, of Maine, Gilbert De-
Lam a tyr, of Indiana. Mr. McPherson
was elected by a vote of 148 against 129

Bingham did not vote, but on the second
they voted for McPberson.
Mr. Robeson then offered a resolution

; door keeper, W. P. Brown
ss i >■" j i • f
low, of Tennessee j postmaster, Henry

cluded in hie list the name of Fred 8.
Power* for chaplain, but Mr. Springer
demanded a separate rote upon that
officer, and that nomination waa with
drawn for the preeent,
Mr. House, of Tenneaaee, offered s

to a* to make it read : Sergeant-at
arm*. John O. Thompson ; doorkeejer,

Mr. Murch'a substitute was rejected
by a viw voce vote, and Mr. llouser by a
vote of yeas, 153 j nays, 157. The origi
nal resolution was then adopted and u!l
the officers sworn in.
On motion of Mr. Hiacock it was re
solved that a committee of three mem
bers be ap|>ointed to act with a similar
committee on part of tho Senate to
wait upon the president and inform
him that a quorum of both houses haa
assembled and is ready to receive any
communication he muy be pleased to'

gan were appointed as such committee.

proper. Pending action tho house at
5:25 adjourned. There is nothing now
to delay the reading of the president's
message when it i received except the
swearing in of territorial delegates,
which can le accomplished in a short
space of time.
The Htalwart Revel.
From lb* Philadelphia Time*.
Senator Cameron appears to have un
dertaken the somewhat human task of
getting even with all opponents of
stalwartism. He settled up some old
scores in this Stalest considerable cost
during the late campaign. He took
one of the Vhird term old guard at
Chicago, and with him laid out the
Blaine element in the State Convention
and over-ride the men who had bolted
Ihe stalwart candidate for Senator.
Hsving done that he transferred his
scene of activity to Washington and
haa been using his knife all along the
Blaine ranks.
The success of Keifer in the Repub
lican caucus was a loud notice that the
bosses have resumed control of the
government, and the further notice has
been given that only stalwarts need
apply. Kasson or Hiscock would have
been named for Speaker if the bosses
bad not interferred. But the bosses,
from Arthur down, did interfere, and
from that moment it was apparent that
not only would neither Hiscock nor
Kasson have any further chance of sue
cesa, but that no candidate from an ear
pbatically Blaine State could possibly*
hope for favor.
Kasson, with the Blaine legions of
lowa at his back ; Uncock, with bis
Independent following ; Burrows, from
the solid Blaine State of Michigan ;
Orth. from Indiana, which held a strong
force against Grantism, and Ihinnell, of
Minnesota, whose State held out till the
last; ail these were passed over for a
stalwart from Garfield's own State,
where neither Blaine nor Grant had
any support, but where a stalwart break
has finally been made. The bosses will
sweep Ohio in under the wing of the
administration, because Ohio has twice
in National Conventions led up to the
defeat of stalwart schemes. .
The bosses neglect nothing in the
midst of their revels. They are power
ful with all the patronage of the (Execu
tive, and they have shown their power
in forcing a stalwart Speaker upon a
caucus which did not want him. Keifer
in the chair will he a strength and help
to any stalwart plan for 1884, whether
it shall mean the nomination of Grant
or tba renomination of Arthur. It is
one part of the bosses' programme for
a complete restoration of stalwartism.
It is not the carrying out of Garfield's
policy exactly, but ooly the very inno
cent expected anything like that.
A Battle Between Bird*.
HOW A CRKBK RAW RID WITH TBI BLOOD
or AR lAOLI AMD A FLOCR or (lIMI.
UltW Bark LatUr to Um Atlnta Gu*tl lotto*.
A gentleman from Stone oounty, who
has jut reached the city, gave the par
ticular* of a remarkable incident which
he witnessed while crossing White
rirer on the ferry juat about the mouth
of Sycamore creek. When nearly half
way acroaa the dream an enormoua
eagle awooped down on a (look of geese,
which were swimming in the rirer aome
eighty roda below the boat. The fowls,
upon observing the eagle approaching,
inatinctirely dired under the water juat
aa the bird arruck the ware. Baffled in
the ft nil aa*ault the eagle flew alowly
upward, and when the geese came to
the surface darted downward again and
burying ita Uloona in one of tbetn at
tempted to bear it away. The gooae
struggled riolently, while ita compan
ions twain around it ottering shrill
cries and the persona on the ferry-boat
watched the atrange scene with keen
interest. Once the eagle lifted iu prey
clear out of the water and seemed on
the point of oonreying It to the moun
tain cliff that rose grandly in the air on
the other aide of the stream, but the
struggles of the goose forced the captor
downward. When water was again
reached the gooae made a supreme
pffbrt and plunged bejpw the surface,
dragging the eagle alter it and oausing
the Utter to loosen iu hold and rise
upward with a fierce scream.
The eagle next attacked another
goose, hut with the same result, being
compelled to relinquish iu hold when
ita intended victim plunged beneath
the wave*. This strange contest lasted
fully thirty minute*, at the end of which
time the eagle gave up the fight, and,
rising, soared away to the mountain
westward, while the flock of geese swam
further down the stream. None of the
flnok were killed, hut the water in the
vicinity was dyed with blood, anil the
surface of the stream was covered with
feathers for a considerable distance.
The Experts and Gulteuu.
From the Chicago lotor-Ocawu,
A committee of experts are in Wash
ington consulting as to the mental con
dition of Guiteau. It is understood
that they do not agree, and the pros
pects is that their evideuce will be quite
contradictory.
The sensible way to look at the cine
in not to weigh the question of the
man's mental derangement, but that of
his mental responsibility. All men who
commit flagrant crimes without seem
ing provocation, or indulge in unuHual
conduct regarding any of the ntlinr* of
life, are, to a greater or less extent, of
unbalanced minds. The question is,
are they sufficiently so to tie held re
sponsible for their acts T The difference
between insanity which becomes trre
sponsible and mere eccentricity of char
acter was pointed out a short time ago
in these column*, and may be properly
alluded lo again, showing, as it does,
the line which divides the two cases,
if Guiteau, for instance, believed him
self jierfectly competent to be the (ten
eral-inCbief of the army h* would un
douhledly be called an insufferable ego
list, or would be laughed si as a block
head, but would hardly be deemed in
sane in the sense of being mentallv ir
responsible for crime. Many persons
during our civil war imagined ibem
selves far more competent than Grant
or .Sherman lo carry on the war sue
cesalully, though without military ex
|ierience. Mr. Mo rat Ilalstead, of Cin
cignali, then a comi-arutively unknown
employe of the Commsrdal, actually
wrote a long letter toGenernl llalleck
detailing how the campaign in the
West should be prosecuted. Halleck,
used to such suggestions, merely in
dorsed the letter "'llalstead M-, tells
how the war should fie carried on." and
placed it on file. He didn't tend out
and have the Cincinnati editor arrested
as a crank for it was plainly a case ol
great self-confidence, and not of delir
ium. Hut if, instead of fancying that
he was ooro|ietent to be the command
er-in-chief of our forces, Mr. ilalstead
had actually conceived himself to It the
commander, then egotism would have
passed the boundary and have become
insanity ; and 11, while laboring under
ibis delirium, be had felt called up >n
lo shoot a man as a deserter, aud it had
been shown that no malice otherwise
existed for the deed, hi* place there
after would have been an asylum, not
ibe gallows. Precisely so with Guileati.
He thought himself competent to fill
my position, no matter how exalted,
but he never imagined that he actually
filled such position when he did not.
He was angry and revengeful because
the President did not set the value on
his services that he himself considered
them worth, and he fired the shot, not
liecau*e he imagined himself lo be Con
sul at Paris, but because be knew that
he was not Consul and bad no hope
to be.
Whatever bis vagaries, therefore, and
however much be rosy have overrated
his powers, he was plainly resjionsible
for tbe murder of tb President, be
cause lie knew, first, that it was assassi
nation, and secondly, because he do
liberately weighed bis grievance and
counted it sufficient for the commission
of ine crime/y' Tbe talk about being
com missioned by the Ihety is shown to
lie twaddle which Guiteau himself does
not crrait, otherwise be would not ex
hibit the craven fear of bodily barm
which be hs* constantly shown since
bis crime, and which he could not feel
were be deluded with the idea that
God directed bis aim and would shield
him from danger.
That the wiineaset should generally
agree that the man is of unbalanced
mind it not atrange. Indeed, it would
be strange if they thought otherwise;
nut tbe point ia bis mental responsibili
ty for tbe murder, and upon tbia the
facta seem strong and conclusive.
The Virginia Nenatorshlp.
Trouble is brewing in the Kesdiuster
ranks. Mabone has had several con
lerences recently with tbe Democratic
element of the Readjuater*. and last
nigbt another conference was held at
Mabone's rooms, at which there were
no Republicans present or invited.
Mabone, it ia understood, will insist
upon Riddleberger for Sergeant-at-Arm*
of the senate, without regard to what
the action of the Virginia Legislature
may be relative to Riddleberger's elec
tion aa Senator. Tbia be doe* because,
if elected, Riddleberger would not take
hia seat in the Senate until 1883.
Among the Republican Readjuatera
there ia much dissatisfaction at Ma
hone's stubbornness in this matter,
especially aa Riddleberger ia personally
obnoxious to many of them. Tbey
bave triad in vain to compromise with
Mahone by supporting for the
Senate from Virginia, and on Tuesday
neat they bold a council in Richmond
upon tbe subject. Gen. Groner, Ma
bone's lieutenant and moneyed man, ia
also dissatisfied, and says Riddleberger
cannot be elected to the Senate. The
Republicans of tbe Readjuatera were
considerably agitated last night over
the conference between Mebona and
the Democrats.
A Priest Shot la MaasarbasHt*.
Srmmariai.D, Mass., December 4.
Father MeCarty, perish priest at Green
field, wae shot and scriouslv wounded
last evening at the parochial >• idenr-e
there by David McMullen. McMul-
Sen's wile left him several years ago be
cause he treated her badly and bad re
cently been acting as housekeeper at
tbe priest's residence. He visited her
last Monday and urged her to live with
him, but she refused. Last night he
called upon her again and she still re
fused to go with him. He returned
three times to tbe priest's bouse, ring
ing the bell violently and kicking at
the door. Father MeCarty finally came
to the door himself and McMullen shot
him twice and then ran away. One
bell entered the priest's body near the
navel and was removed from tbe back.
This evening Father MeCarty i* in a
dangerous condition and ia reported to
be sinking.
