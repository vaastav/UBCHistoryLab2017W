WASHINGTON, 1). C„
Dec. It. —A political alliance
of ull nations on tho Ameri
can continent, an alliance
which n 'iilil |. M.l their mili
tiiry force!., im.ul anil lund,
for defense against niiiiiHr
clilal iigKr-'ssion, is what
■ 'resident Wilson meant by
what he suld when dealing
with pun-Americanism in his
annual message to congress.
<iw in ; to the fact that pnii-
Aniericanisni litis hitherto
Ix-en merely ;i stiiitiiiiental
drawing together for busi
ness ftttfrnaaa, the larger sig
nificiiiice of tho president's
remarks was generally lost.
1 ant inforim.d today on excel- 1
lent authority that steps have
been taken already toward the ne
gotiation of a treaty with the Ar
gentine which would be joined in
by Hrazil and Chili.
Ambassador Roinulo S. Naon of
Argentine has taken the Initiativel
in the matter, and 1 am told has!
made definite and authoritative j
proposals on uehalf of the gov
ernment to President Wilson and j
our state department.
These look to an arrangement
by which the three South Aiueri-1
can republics would pledge them-1
selves to furnish 800,000 men
properly trained, for any defen
sive measures necessary to the
maintenance of the republican
form of government in the west
ern hemisphere.
The United States in return for
the aid of this force would agree
to furnish munitions necessary to
arm and equip that number and
some arrangement would be
worked out by which the A. B. C.
countries would, if attacked, have
aid from the navy.
Have Splendid Armies.
The combined armies of the A.
B. C. countries are considerably
larger in numbers than the pres
ent standing army of the Cnlted
States, while their combined naval
forces muster four of the latesc
type (Ireadmiughts, six older bat
tle cruisers and a large flotilla of
destroyers and torpedo boats,
with a few submarines and auxi
liary crart.
If added to the United States
navy the combined forces would
be second only to the British navy
in size and strength.
Eventually the treaty agree
mi it;; which it is expected will be
worked out in the near future will
go to the senate for ratification,
and at that time the details would
naturally bo more fully discussed.
Tho president, meantime, wants
congress to be giving serious
thought to the matter.
New and More Vital Interest.
Almost ln the opening para
graph of his message President
Wilson struck the note of Interna
tionalism and pan-Americanism.
He reminded congress that ln
guiding our coarse since the Eu
ropean war broke out, "the states
of America have become con
scious of a new and more vital
community of interest and moral
partnership in affaire, more clear
ly conscious of the many commn.i
sympathies and Interests and du
ties which hid them stand togeth
er."

PORTLAND, Ore.—Hearing on
charges of incompetency of Dr.
Marius Marcellui., Portland health
officer, resumed today. Many wit
nesses called. Among other
things, It Is charged Dr. Marcel
lus failed to surround a leprous
patient with sufficient regula
tions.

NEW YORK—Lowest tempera
ture of the day in the east was at
Davenport, la., where mercury
went to 4 above. In New York
It was 28 above. Many deuths
reported.
AUIUJRN—WesIey Merchnnta,
20, and James Wahl, 19, broke
from the city jail last night while j
waiting for trial on charge of as- ■
saulting R. A. Hutchinson. They
wsre Auburn boys. Believed
friends helped them.
CHICAGO—Kdward Barry, his
wife, and Warren Barabro were
burned to death last night In
their bods ln the Bradley hotel,
Grand avenue and Rush streets.
Tho place was destroyed.
.OLYMPIA—-Campaign baa been
started to raise ILO.OOO for main
taining Washington building at
the B*n Diego exposition open tot j
another year.
He went an to point out that
for many years the motives of
this country wore somewhat ques
tioned but that loiiay more than
ever before tho republics of the
south feel that the United States
is not seeking territorial aggran
dizement and tnat an alliance of
a military nature would not mean
absorption or domination by the
United States over the other re
publics.
Alluding to the Monroe doo
trine, the president said:
Makes Common Cause.
"We still mean always to make
a common cau-e of national inde
pendence and of political liberty
ln America. Hut that purpose is
now better .understood so far as it
concerns ourselves. It Is known
not to be a selfish purpose. It Is
known to havo in it no thought
of taking advantage of any gov
ernment in tills hemisphere or ]
playing its political fortunes fori
our own benefit."
The president urged coiigresi
i men to rend the reports of the
| pan-American Congress. From
: these reports, said he, "you will
get a fresh conception of the ea..a
and Intelligeni'e and advantage
I with which Americans of boll
I continents may draw together in
I practical co-operation and of
what the material foundations ot
Uhis hopeful partnership of inter
est must consist—of how we
should build tiuin and of how
necessary It is that we should has
ten their building."
l'a,V T. It. & I». power pa
trons a premium for buying
their juice from the private
company instead of the city!
That's another of the
highly ingenious feature!* of
the new |M>uer franchise or
dinance, prepared by city
Attorney Stiles under super
vision of Munnger l_ouis
liean.
If the ordinance carries,
(he city will sell to the T. 11.
it I*, t'o.'s power customers
electricity for lighting pur
poses at the Nome rate that it
sells Juice for power to other
folks.
It would sell electric lighting
current to T. R. & p. customers
at a rate lower than It sells elec
tric lighting current to. any of
the 1 5,000 or more customers of
its own plant.
If the good taxpayers of Ta
coma need a vivid example of
how their confidence is being
juggled at the city hall, let them
study over this clause.
If they can see any reason why
the city of Tacoma should under
cut Its light rates to power cus
tomers of Stone-Webster, we'd
like the answer.
Here's the clause; read it for
yourself:
"Third: That the city will,
during the term of this agree
ment, sell and furnish to any pa
tron of the grantee using 25
horsepower of connected load and
upwards, current for lighting the
premises where such patron oper
ates, at the rates now provided
by the last clause of Ordinance
No. C 244 of said city."
The "last clause" Is the one
providing for the low rates.
Some city attorney, that Stiles!

may ask eagerly.
"Simply beciuse they shook the
wrong kind of n rag at the bull."
I quote from one of the democra
tic senators here.
On the great yellow banner
which stretched across the road
at the head of the procession were
the words "We Demand."
"Ladies! Ladies!" was the sad
cxi Ipunation of a western senator,
when he saw these words. "Don't
you know tlut even Cleopatra
was thrown down when she began
to make demands on Anthony?"
Uncle Joe Is still popular—on
the floor of congress. Even Art
Young seems to like Uncle Joe.
Notice the debonair swagger he
gives him. And Art, the artist,
you know, is much agin all pluto
crats, aristocrats and autocrats
and Uncle Joe was born an auto
crat, attained aristocracy and had
plutocracy thrust upon him.
The lu-riiiii of adulation that
floats about Washington Is the
breath of life to Uncle Joe, who
they say, can see "two small
pairs" with the same facility and
make a one-card draw fill his
hand with the same dispatch he
did when he first came to the
and a little higher if anything.
If you are a man you need not
expect to be spoken to unless you
ure a senator nor criticized nor
commended unless you are a sen
ator's wife.
"There is something about this
man's town," said Art Young,
"that early begins to make a sen
ator believe 'I am not as other
men are' —and if you ask me, I
would say he isn't."
By the way, there are two
Clarks ln congress; the one with
what Art Young calls "the Ham
let rings uudor his eyes and the
fretful drawl" is Champ Clark,
the speaker of (he house, and the
other, who spells his name with
an c (Clarke, just like that) is
the one who presides over the
senate "pro tern," or before time,
as It were. Both wear an old
man's collar, "which is one that
Is big enough to turtle one's head
in, when popular clamor shuts off
their wttid." 1 am quoting Art
| Young again. You see, he being
an artist, sees the picturesque -is

And l he most picturesque bit of
i ornamentation iibout Washington
Us the cuspidor. It masquerades
as a v-a-s-e (broad a, please). It i
shims with the molten splendor
thai suggests lluggenhelm, and
it mokes itself heard in tones Btl
tinkling brass. Said a woman in
the ladies' gallery yesterday, "1
believe this is the only place In
all public Washington where they
do not have a regular battalion of
cuspidors."
"And the only place they are
not needed," Hpntentlouslj' re
marked another wonian.who was
wearing, conspicuously, the pur
ple, yellow and while of the suf
fragists.
A certain southern congress
man who Is going to oppose the

lO#ne, yesterday, "Yes, of cose, I
retkon the president is sincere,
.but I don't think he has studied
the mattah as cloßely as neces

"You see, for the last six
months, the president has been
ce'tln', and I know when I was
co'tln' I didn't have time foh
much else -did you?"
Art Young r,bks the pertinent
question that Cupid is posting at
the end of this scheed.
Now all together give a guess.

Are the judges of Pierce county on

Or do they hold down a polished bench in the

the Home Cloak & Suit house,
and Vogelbaum had been arrested
for conducting a nuisance on the
complaint of the prosecuting at

suit was brought against him.
This suit was brought by 1 M.
Heilig, whom, it appeared on the
face of it, Vogelbaum happened
to owe 125,". in promissory notes.
Clifford Does It.
Heilig asked to have a receiver
appointed. Then Vogelbaum and
Heilig agreed that S. F. Hullard
would be just the man for the job
and that the law firm of Knight
& Muscek would be all right as
the receiver's attorneys.
So Judge Clifford, on Dec. 10;
appointed the whole friendly
bunch as requested. Now listen:
Heilig is the very man who
went on Vogetbauin's bond when
he was arrested.
Attorney Muscek ig one of the
lawyers who defended Vogelbaum
in the criminal trial in Judge
Card's court.
It's orto conglomeration of
friendliness, but do you get It?
Here's the man who brought a re

bondsman. And the attorney de

attorney for the receiver!
Impartial Officers!
And a receiver and his attorney,

court.
Judge Clifford is the one who
did the appointing.
"I didn't know that the attor
ney was defending Vogelbaum
until after I had appointed him,"
Clifford offered as an excuse to-
day.
"If there is any complaint or
protest about it I'll see if a
change can't be made."
And the folks are wondering
what he's on the Job for.
"It looks to me as if any of
those people who want to get back
the money they paid in on the suit
lottery will have to go some,"
said Deputy Prosecuting Attorney
Thompson. "It looks as If things
were fixed pretty nicely for Vogel
baum."
"You can draw your own con

the right to appoint anybody he
wants."
