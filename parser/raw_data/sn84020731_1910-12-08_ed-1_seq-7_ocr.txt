treasury for tbe year 1911. and Is 15.-
674.659.39 .less than the original esti

These figures do not Include tbe ap
propriations for the Tana ma canal, the
policy lu respect to which ought to be
and la to spend as mueb each year as
can be economically and effectively ex
pended in order to complete tbe canal
as promptly as possible, and there
fore tbe ordinary motive for cutting
down the expense of the government
does not apply to appropriations for
this purpose. It will be noted that tbo
estimates for the Panama eanat for
the ensuing year are, more than $50,
000,0001 jin increase : of 120,000.000
over the amount appropriated for this
year, a difference due to the fact that
the estimates for 1912 Include some
thing over $19,000,000 for tbe fortifica
tion of the canal.
Against tbe estimates of expendi
tures, $030,494,013.12, we have esti
mate receipts for next year $GS0,-
OuO.000, making a probable surplus of
ordinary receipts over ordinary i ex
penditures of about $50,000,000, or,
taking: Into account the estimates for
the l'auatna canal, which are $50,020,-
(H'.COj aud wbfcb will ultimately be
paid In bonds. It will leave a deficit
for vt lie next year of about $7,000,000
If congress shall conclude to fortify the
canaU Tbe coot of tbe fortiUt-utloua
Is about $19,000,000. Should there be
no appropriations this year for fort 10
cations then there would be, even in'
eluding the Panama canal appropria
tion, a surplus of about I12.0uu.000.
It la not essential to tbe preventing
of smuggling that customs district?
should be increased la number. The
violation of tbe customs laws can be
quite aa easily prevented and much
more economically by the revenue cut

As the treasury department la the
one through which the Income of the

pror place to 'consider the operation
of the exlxttng tariff bill, which be

Tariff Beard. ., .4V. J;-'
The time In which the'ta.rlff was pre
pared undoubtedly was so abort na to
make It impossible for tuo congress
and its experts to acquire the lii forma-1
tlOn necessary atrlctly to conform to
the declared measure. In order to avoid
criticism of this kind In tbo1 future and
for the purpose of more nearly coj)form
Ing to tbo party promise cougresa at Its
last session made provision at nij re
quest for the continuance of a board cre
ated under tbe authority of, the maxi
mum and minimum clause of tle tariff
bill and authorized tbla board toexpend
the money appropriated under my di
rection for tbe ascertainment of the
Cost of production' at home and abroad
of the various articles Included In tbe
schedules of tbe tariff. The tariff
board thus appointed and authorized
bas been diligent in preparing Itself for
"the necessary Investigations. Tbe hope
of those who- have advocated tbe use
of this board for tariff purposes Is tlmt
tbo question of tbe rate of a duty Im
posed sball become more of a business
question, and less of a political ques
tion, to be ascertained by experts of
long training, and accurate' knowledge.
The bait hi business and tbe shock to
business due to the announcement that
a new tariff bill Is to be prepared and
put In operation will bo avoided by
treating tbe schedules oue by one as
occasion shall arise for a change In the
rates of each and only after a report
upon the schedule by the tariff board
competent to make such report . .
It Is not likely that tbe board will be
able to make a report during tbe pres
ent session of congress on any of tbe
schedules, because a proper examina
tion Involves an enormoua amount of
detail and a great deal of care, but I
bope to be able at the opening of tbe
new congress, or at least during (be
session of that congress, bj bring to
its attention tbe facts In regard to
those schedules In the present tariff
that may prove to need amendment
The carrying out of this plan, of
course. Involves tbe -full co-operation'
of congress in limiting the considera
tion In tariff matters to one schedule
at a time, because If a proposed amend
ment to a tariff, bill Is to Involve a
complete consideration of all tbe
schedules and another revision then
we shall only repeat tbe evil front
wblcb the business of tbla country has
In times past suffered most grievously
by stagnation and uncertainty, pend
ing a resettlement of .a law effecting
all business directly or Indirectly, and
the effect of which no wise business
man would Ignore In new projects and
new Investments.
--ffbe-fcftrnhtaMw-hich the Members of
the tariff board made doting tbe last
suinnier Into tbe methods "pursued by
other governments with reference to
tbe fixing of tariffs, and the determina
tion of their effect upon trade show
that eacb government maintains an of
fice or bureau, tbe oOlccra aud em
ployees of which have made thcit life
work the, atudy of tariff matters, of
foreign and home prices and cost of
articles Imported and the effect of tbe
tariff upon trade, so that whenever a
change is thought to be necessary In
tbo tariff law this office Is the source
of tbe most reliable Information as to
the propriety of tbe change and its ef
fect i. am strongly convinced that we
need In tbia government Just such an
office and that It can be secured by
making tbe tariff board already ap
pointed a permanent tariff commission,
with such duties, powers and emolu
ments aa It may seem wise to congress
to give. It bas been proposed to en
largo the board from three to five. Tbe
present number. fa convenient, but I
do not know that an Incrcasy of two
nicmbcre would be oliJectloible.
I recommend that congre. establish
a commission to determine as early as
practicable a comprehensive policy for
the organization, modi; tent Ion and ad
ministration of tbe retrulnr army, the
organized militia aud tbe volunteer
forces In the event of war.
Need Per Additional Officers.
One of the great difficulties In the
prompt organisation and mobilization
of militia and volunteer forces Is tbe
absence of competent officers of tbe
rank of captain to teach the hew army,
by the unit of the conymny, the busi
ness of being soldiers and of tnklug
rare of themselves so as to render ef
fective service. This need of army
officers can only be supplied 'by pro
visions of law authorizing tha appoint
ment of a greater number of army of
ficers than are needed to supply the
commands of regular army troops now
enlisted In the service. '
In order that the mllltla of eacb
state should be properly drilled and
made more like the regular army, reg
ular army officers should be detailed
to assist the adjutant general of each
stale in the supervision of the stale
mllltla. Hut this Is Impossible unless
provision Is mnde by congress for a
wry- considerable Increase In the nnm-
bor.t .company ami field officers of
tue array.

;,. ',:'!"'",,'PanamaCanal.'. "
, At tlie Instance of Colonel Goo'bals,
the army engtneer officer In chnrge of
tbe work on tbo Panama canal, I have
Just made a visit to the Isthmus to In
spect the work done and to'1 consult
with him on the ground os to certain
'problems which are likely to arise In
'the near future. The!progrcsa of tbe
work is most satisfactory.! If no un
expected obstacle presents" itself" tbe
canal will be completed; well within the
time flsed by Colonel-fGoetuals to wit,
Jan., 1, !l915 and. within tbe estimate
ff tpst, $375,000,000. ?';, . ,
Among questions arising for present
tjo1ut!oii$ Is the decision -whether the
caiial shall be fortified. I have alrendv
stated !lo the con.ess that I strongly
.l-L.L m ...tin L i 1 L. .y. r . ...
layor iruui'iiuii,fuuu . uow ri!iit-rnu-this,
opinion and ess your consideration
of the subject In tbe light of tbe report
already before you made by a compe
tent board. -
If In our, discretion we believe mod
ern fortifications to be necessary to tbe
adequate protection and policing of tbe
canal, then It is our duty to construct
them. We have "built the canal. It Is
our property. By convention we have
indicated pur desire for and Indeed un
dertaken its. universal and equal use
It Is also well known that one of the
c,hiof objects In the construction of the
canal baa been to Increase tbe military
effectiveness of our pavy. -
..failure to fortify the. canal would
leave tbe attainment of both these
alms In tbe position 'of rights arid ob
ligations which we should be powerless
to enforce and which could never In
anyther way be absolutely safeguard
ed against a desperate and Irresponsi
ble enemy."! -" ' "'
j In ; determlningjvhat.the tolls In tbe
canal should be we certainly ought not
la Insist tost for a good many years
o come they sbould'amount to enough
to pay the- interest on the Investment
of - $400,000,000 which tbe United
States bas made' In tbe construction
of tlie -entail. We ought not to do tills,
tfiref. because the benefits to be derived
by the .United States from this ex
penditure are not to be measured solely
by a return uion tbe Investment
' My own Impression is that the tolls
ought not to exceed $1 per net ton. On
Jan. 1, 1911, the tolls In the Suez canal
are to be ? francs and 23 centimes fot
one net ton- by Suez canal meosure-
meat. ' which Isl a; modification of
Danube measurement. . A dollar a ton
wDI secure Under, the figures above a
gross annual Income from the raunma
canal of nearly $700.000. Tbe cost
of maintenance and operation is estl
snatefltfto exceed 3.000,000.
Th next question that arises Is as
to the maintenance, management and
general control of the canal after its
completion. Ik should be premised
that It Is an essential part of our navy
establishment to have the coal, oil aud
other skip supplies, -a drydock and
repulr abons,codvenlentTy located 'with
reference It naval-vessels, passing
tbrooea theanaL Now. If the govern
ment for naval purposes la to under
takt to furnish these conveniences to
the' navy, and they are couvenloaces
equally required by commercial ves
sels, there would seem to be strong
reasons why the government should
take over and Include In Its manage-
' ment tbe furnishing not only to tbe
navy, but to the public, drydock and
repair shop facilities and the sale of
coaL oil and other ship supplies.
Tbe maintenance of a hk'k canal of
this enormous size In a srely pepu
Intcd country and In the tropics, where
tbe danger from disease Is always
present require a large and complete
and well trained orcauisntjon wnn
full police powers, exercising the Ut
most care. -
I cannot close this ecfcren-e to the
canal without eu.ggcr.tlng as a wist
amendment to the Interstate commerce
law a provision prohibiting Interstate
commerce railroads from owning or
controlling ships engaged In the trade
through the Pansnia canaL I believe
such a provision may lie needed to
save to the people of the United States
the benefits of the competition in trade
between the eastern and western sea
boards which tbls canal was construct
ed to secure.
' Dc psrtmsnt ef Justice,
I am glad tq say that under the ap
propriation made for the department
of Justice the attorney general has so
Improved Its organization flint a vast
amount of litlcntlon of a civil and
criminal character ha been disposal
of durlug the current year. This will
explain the necessity for slightly In
creasing the estimates for the ei
penses ef the department tils report
shows the recoveries mnde on behalf
of the government, of duties frnudu
lently withheld public lands Itnprop
erly patented, flues and penalties for
trespass, prosecutions and convictions
under tbe anti trust law and proncca
tlons under Interstate commerce law.
I Invite especial attention to tbt

those schemes to defraud In wblcb thr

of the fraudulent conspiracy, prosecu

Judicial Prsesdurs.
One great crying need In the United
States Is cbenpetilug Ihe cost of litiga
tion by simplifying Judicial procedure
and expediting final Judgment, Under
present conditions the poor man is at
a Woeful disadvantage In a legal con
test with a corporation or a rich op
ponent. The necessity for tbe reform
exists Mb In United States courts
ami In all slate court. In order to
bring It alu'tif. however, It naturally
j falls to Ihe gvnfral government by lis
states. A. Icglslallrv commission up
pointed by Joint resolution of cougresa
to revise tbe procedure in the United
States courts baa as yet made no re
port,- "
I am strongly convinced that the
best method of Improving judicial pro
cedure at law is to empower tbe su
preme court to do It through the me
drum of tbe rules of tbe court as in
equity. Tbls Is the way lu which it
has been done in England. -
Relief of Supreme Court 'Prom Un-k-
- ' , necessary Appeals. ,
No man ought to have as' a matter of
right; a review, of his case by tbo su
preme court lie should bo satisfied
by one bearing before a court of first
instance aud one reviow by a court of
appeals. The proper and chief useful
ness of the supreme court and espe
cially the supreme court of tha United
States, la in the cases which come be
fore It so to expound the law and espe
cially tbe fundamental law the con
stitution aa to furaiah precedenta for
tbe Inferior courts in future litigation
and tot tbe executive officers In tbe
construction of statutes and the per
formance of their legal duties. There
fore any provisions for review of cases
by tbe supreme court that cast upon
that court tbe duty of passing on ques
tions of evidence and tbe construction
of particular forma of Instruments, like
indictments or wills or contracts, de
cisions not of general application or
Importance, merely clog and burden
the court and render more difficult its
higher function, which makes It so Im
portant a part of the framework of
our government Tbe supreme court Is
now carrying an unnecessary burden
of appeals of thia kind, and I earnestly
urge that It be removed.
Judicial Salaries.
I further recommend to congress tbe
passage of tbe bill now pending for
tbe Increase In tbe salaries of tbe fed
eral Judges, by which the chief Justice
of tho supreme court shall receive $17.
500 and tbe associate Justices $17,000.
tbe circuit Judges constituting the cir
cuit court of appeals shall receive $10.
000 and tbe district Judgea $9,000. Tbe
positions they occupy ought to be filled
by men who have shown tbe greatest
ability In their professional work at
the bar, and it la the poorest economy
possible for tbe government to pay
salaries so low for judicial sen-ice as
not to be able to command the best
talent of tbe legal profession In every
part of tbe country.
Wiping Out of Postal Deficit
for many years mere naa been a
deficit In tbe operations of tbe post-
office department which has been met
by appropriation1 from the treasury.
The appropriation estimated for last
year from the treasury over and above
the receipts of tbe department was
$17,500,000. I am glad to record the
fact that of that $17,500,000 estimated
for $11,500,000 were saved and return
ed to the treasury. It is gratifying
to report that the reduction tu the
deficit lias been accomplished without
any curtailment ut postal .facilities..
Upon the recommendation of the
postmaster general I bare included ha
the classified service all assistant post
masters, and 1 believe that this giving
a secure 'tenure to those who are tbe
most Important subordinates of post
masters will add much to tbe efficiency
of their offices and an economical ad
ministration. The Franking Privilege.
. Tbe unrestricted manner in which
the franking privilege is now being
nscd by tbe several federal, scrvk-es
and by congress bas laid It open 'to se
rious abuses.
Parcsla Post
With respect to the parcels post I
respectfully recouiuiend Its adoption
on all rural delivery routes and that
eleven pounds, the International limit
be made the limit of carriage In aucb
post The postoiDce department bas a
great plant and a great organization,
reaching Into tbe most remote hamlet
of the United States, and with this
machinery It Is able to do a great
many things economically that if a
new organization were necessary It
would be impossible to do without ex
travagant expenditure. That Is tbe
reason why tbe postal savings hank
can be carried on at a small additional
cost and why It U possible to Incor
porate at a very Inconsiderable ex
pense a parcels post la tbe rural de
livery system.
Peary. . .
I unite with the secretary In the rec
ommendation that an appropriation
be made to construct a anliable crypt
at Annapolis for the custody of the
remains of John Paul Jones.
Tbe unparalleled achievement of
Peary In reaching the north pole. April
0, 1909, approved br critical examina
tion of Ihe most expert scientists, has
added to the distinction of our navy,
to which be belong, and reflects credit
opoo bis country. Ills unique success
baa received generous acknowledgment
from scientific bodies and institution
of learning In Europe and America. 1
recommend fitting recognition by con
areas of the great. achievement bt Bob

ing of a negro exposition In celebra
tion of tho fiftieth anniversary of the
Issuing by Mr. Lincoln of tbe emanci
pation proclamation. r . '
.."T"';, Conservation.',' . '' -Nothing
can be more important In
the matter of conservation than the
treatment, of our forest lands. Speak
ing generally, tbe government has re
served of tbe existing forests about 70
per cent of all tbe timberlanda of the
government Within these forests (In
cluding 20,000,000 acres in two forests
In Alaska) are 192.000,000 acres, of
which ICC.000,000 acres are In the
United States proper and include with
in their boundaries something like 22.-
000,000 acres that belong to tbe states
or to private individuals. We have,
then, excluding Alaska forests, a total
of about 144,000,000 acres of forests
belonging to the government which
are being treated In accord with the
principles of scientific forestry.
Tbe law now prohibits tbe reserva
tion of any more forest lands in Ore
gon, Washington, Idaho, Montana,
Colorado, and Wyoming except by
act of congress. I am Informed by
the department of agriculture that the
government owns other tracts of tlm
berland in these states wblcb should
be Included in the forest nservea. 1
recommend to congress that the limi
tation herein Imposed be repealed. In
the present forest reserves there are
lands wblcb are not properly forest
land and wblcb ought to be subject to
homestead entry.
' Coal Landa,
The next subject, and one most Im
portant for your consideration, is the
disposition of the coal lands in tbe
Untied States and In Alaska. At tbe
beginning of this administration there
were claaslfled coal lands in tbe Unit
ed States amounting to 6,470.000 acres,
and there were withdrawn from entry
for purposes of classification 17307.000
acres. Since that time there have been
withdrawn' by my order from entry
for classification 78,977,745 acres, mak
ing a total withdrawal of 9C.844.745
acres. Meantime of tbe acres thus
withdrawn 10.001389 have been class!
fed and found not t. contain coal and
have been restored to agricultural en
try and 4,720,091 acres bave been clas
sified as coal lands, while 79,903239
acres remain withdrawn from enjry
aud await classification. In addition
337.000 acres have been classified as
coal lands without, prior withdrawal.
thus Increasing tbe classified coal lands
to 10.429.372 acres, , j
tdo question as to bow great an
area ought to be included in-a lease to
one Individual or corporation is not
free from difficulty, but In view of the
fact that tbe government retains con
trol as owner I think there might be
some liberality In the amount leased
and that 2.500 acres would not be too
great a maximum. The lease should
only be granted after advertisement
and public competition.
. That secretary of tbe Interior thinks
there' are difficulties In tbe way of
leasing public coal lands. I entirely
approved .ble stating at length In his
report tbe objections in order that the
whole subject may be presented to
congress, but after a full consideration
I favor a leasing system and recom
mend It
Tbe needed oil and gas law Is essen
tially a leasing law. In their natural
occurrence oil and gns cannot be
measured In terms of acre, like coal,
and It follows that exclusive title to
these products csn normally lie se
cured only aftr-r they reach the sur
face. iO a'houltr'be disposed of ns a
commodity fti terms of Imrfela of
transportable product rather than In
acres of real estate. v
. . t Water Power Ratos. ' t
Tbe. water bower sites subject H one
that calls for new legislation. It ha
been thought that there was danger
of combination to obtain possession of
ail tbe power sites and to unite tbctn
under one- coutroL Whatever the evi
dence of this or lack of It at present
we have bad enouch experience to
know that combination would be prof
itable, and tbe control of a great num
ber of power sites would enable the
holders or owners to raise the price
of power at will within certain sec
tions, and tho temptation would
promptly attract Investors, and the
danger of monopoly and extortion
would not be a remote one.
nowever this msy be. It U the plsla
July of the government to see to It
that In tbe utilisation and develop
ment of ait tbls immense amount of
watr power conditions shall lie Im
posed that, will prevent extortionate
charges, wblcb are tbe usual accompa
niment of monopoly.
