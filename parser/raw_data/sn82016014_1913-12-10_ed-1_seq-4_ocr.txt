' The house of representatives has gone

Difference In point of view Is again
ilustrated, says the Christian Science

Marshall, who want 1 to. see "the

lieve that the American dollar at times
has entirely too much courage.

MR. WILSON'S INCONSISTENCY.
' That was a neat little sidestep which
President Wilson executed when he ex
plained to the delegation of the Na
tional American Woman's Suffrage as
sociation why he deemed it impossi
ble and impolitic to urge their cause
in a message to congress. But it is
likely to rebound on his head with the
force of a hundred of brick.
He styled himself In the presidential
office as merely the spokesman of his
party. He insisted that be was not at
liberty to urge on congress in messages,
policies which have not had the organic
consideration of those for whom he is
spokesman. It was not his province to
"start anything," he said, and he add
ed: "I have to confine myself to those
things which have been embodied as
promises to the people at an election.
This is the strict rule I set .for my
self." " ""
It was only the other day. though,
that President Wilson in his annual
message to congress, which he deliv
ered In person, tossed out the sugges
tion that he favored legislation which
would do away the national party
conventions of the present variety.
Instead of the delegate system that
has been in vogue during the life, of
the political parties as they are now
constituted, he would have tbe national
conventions of the future made up of
the nominees for house of representa
tives, nominees for the vacancies In the
United States senate, the United States
senators holding office, the members of
the national committees, and the nomi
nees for the presidency and the vice
presidency. This is an exceedingly
revolutionary political suggestion, as
far as national politics is concerned.
Nor has it ever ---n considered or
ganically, so far as it is publicly
known, by the Democratic party. Cer
tainly it was not among the promises
of this party on whlcb the last cam
paign was waged. It may not be an
original Idea with Mr. Wilson himself,
but It hss been accepted as such the
country over, and will be attributed to
htm unless he makes a specific denial
or explanation to the contrary. This
much is positive, however. He cannot
hang the idea on tha Democratic
party, unless there has been a secret
meeting of the party at which this and
perhaps other reforms have been pro
jected. That is not likely.
Of course, most rules become noted
because of tbe exceptions taken to
them. But it doesn't savor much of a
consistency that Is desirable in a man
who holds the high office of president
of the United States to announce in
one breath a rule which he did not
follow in an immediately preceding
breath. He thus open himself to the
charge that he only invokes the rule
when It Is convenient.
SLAVE-DRIVE G FARMERS.
Warren F. Wilcox, writing , about
"The Baneful Rush on the Farm," In
the current issue of Farm and Fire
side, says:
"It doesn't pay altogether to rush
too much, to work too long hours, to
ignore the Sunday rest-day. I have
seen it tried out and noticed the re
sults. Here are the cases of two men
in Tork state, neighbors. On one farm,
at four or four-thirty every afternoon
during the summer and autumn, a
boy or man was sent for the cows. By
five o'clock all hands were milking.
By six the milking was ; practically
done so that at best there were not
more than one or two cows apiece af
ter supper. There was no evening
work. On the adjoining , farm the
haying help or harvesting hands work
ed in the field until seven o'clock.
Then ihey milked until nine or half
past. If by chance they happened to
get through milking before dark, the
boss would have them get another
load of hay, and often after I. have
been in bed I have heard them out in
the field. : k : ;
"These men almost met themselves
getting up when they went to bed. On
both farms early rising was in vogue.
I do not mind that. , I am always in
favor of getting the day's work started
early, but I do say, 'Quit when the day
is done.' So many farmers seem to
H xmM. Aunq rn.il sa'Aiap-eAuis eq
hay, for it looks like rain, and a day's
work is done In half a day. It's hur
ry with this and that. Always a pinch
somewhere to get a task finished in
half the time to ought to take.
"And then Sunday work. Man,
beast and machine need one day's rest
in seven. On the aforesaid farms
Sunday work was the rule on the
'drive farm. On the other nothing but
the necessary chores were performed
on Sunday. What was the result?
Hired men could not be kept on the
'drive' farm; neither could the boys.
Finally the farm was lost through the
mortgage. The other prospered, no
trouble to keep hired men, the boys
liked farming, success was written aU
over the ' place. Rush, push, hustle,
bustle, long hours, Sunday work and
all did not avail in the one case, for
the boss lost out."

That the habit of stealing is on the
increase ir the upper classes seems, in
London at least, to no an undeniable
fact, and one that Is causing a good
deal of consternation. Every one In
a creed that something must be done
to check this truly disgraceful state of
affairs, and no one can think what
It is a sad fact that it is not safe to
lose sight even for a moment of one's
property in any shop, crab, or hotel,
and things have got to such a pass that
even in private houses guests are un
comfortable if others leave their be
longings about.
Not long ago a young woman sat
down at a friend's club to write a let
ter, placing her chain bag beside her.
While she was writing tbe letter her
bag disappeared, was apparently spirit
ed away into thin air. Another, living
not 100 yards from the most faanJan
abie store in landoa, was amased to
receive -her account with 20 guineas
worth of underlinen she had not. had.
On Inquiry it came out that a lady
purporting to be herself had called for
the things with a cab on her way- to a
station, and had signed for thorn, she
ed with the owner of the account. It ,
would seem that not only are a few
. Ill-balanced t omen to be blamed, but
that tha aasna awlnui stale of affairs
reigns at certain men's clubs and
haunts as well. At a wen known reg
istry office kept by ladles it is an ac

about his father and his father's twin

"I'm attending to my end of the

and you choose, heaven knows why.
to grin everlastingly, why all right!
So shut up." Hurley began opening
a tot of letters, and Parsons shrugged
his shoulders, answered the telephone,
kicked he waste basket into position,
and straightened his tie at the same
time, which was like Parsons. As he
talked into tha 'phone, he laughed,
his blond young face alight. Hurley
watched him, half-turned in his chair,
but said nothing. . Evan then he was
scowling, his thin dark face .unhappy
.and 'cynical.
.-. "It wa Aggie. Hurley. - Wants me
to bring yon for dinner tonight. 'Want
to corns?" : Hurley was stiff. "
"Tour wife is very kind, but I can
not accept your invitation tonight.
Will you thank her for me?" -
The other man gave a keen look at
his friend and then turned deliber
ately upon him.
"I'm going to know what ails you,
Fred Hurley. Be mad if you like,
but answer my questions. Now, you
haven't lost money?" Hurley growled
a denial. "Nor any of your distant
-.but beloved family? No? Comxnlt
I ted any crimes - and brooding over
I them? Well. I didn't suppose you
' bad, but something is wrong. Say, is
(your health all right? Getting exer-

I Hurley nodded, then laughed In
. spite of himself.
I "Plague take you! I'm all right. I
tell you! What shall we do about
that De Mott contract"
"We're not talking bualn
I'm going to get at the bottom Of this
aberration of yours. By a process of
elimination I have discovered what Is
wrongs there's some girl at the bot
tom of this eternal grouch of. yours.
Come, out with it you haven't had
luck in love. That would put any fel
low to the bad. Now Aggie and I"
"Confound your married couples!"
interrupted Hurley fervently.1 "Ton
make me want to flee to the ends of
the earth! Because you're in the
matrimonial puddle yourself you want
everybody else to be! There's no
safety' among -you. Tou're- a secret
society bound to marry off your sin
gle friends. Go to dinner, and your
hostess sends you out with some girl
she wants you to marry. Perhaps the
girl is willing too willing perhaps
she hates the sight of you. In either
case, a man is up against It. - Luck

of luck in love I have gotten away
safely every time thus far. And you

Parsons regarded him with a wise
but maddening nod of complacency.
"So it went as deep as that, did It?
Well, Ethel Rose is a hard girl to- get
away from, old chap" Hurley's
eyes blazed.
"I didn't mention Miss Rose," he
said stiffly. "Will you mind your own
business?"
"I mentioned her. She is Aggie's
cousin and we introduced you, so I
think I shall mention her If 1 Uke.
So think we tried to throw her

"I said nothing about
her yon

I consider it rotten poor taste of you.

By now Hurley was furious. He
Jumped up and put on his hat and
overcoat.
"I'm out of thta van e look after
things. It's too personal for me around
here. If anyone wants me you can say
I'm dead. Confound you for a meddler,"
he stalked out, and Parsons chuckled
after him. -
"Ton surely have got it bad, my boy"
but Hurley was out of earshot.
Still scowling the young fellow strode
out upon the street, where was falling
softly the first real snow. It was late
In November and the Thanksgiving spirit
was in the sir. Shops displayed turkeys
and chickens and a certain air of plenty
and Jollity prevailed. Hurley walked
along, throwing his bead back aad breath
ing Tn tbe crisp air. He walked out of

BT ROTH CAMERON.
"Sweet Are the Uses."
On account of financial In as and
a much reduced income one of the
families in our neighborhood decided
last January to cut down its large
purchase of magazines to two of the
leading monthlies.
As they are very fond of reading I
supposed they would find this a keen
deprivation, but my neighbor tells me
that this cloud has so big a silver lin
ing that she is not sure that it is a
cloud at all. "When we had a dosen
magasines," she said, "wo used to
skim them over. Now we read our
two magasines carefully. Instead of
throwing them aside after we have
read tbe stories we read the essays
and serious articles, too. Then it has
driven us to make more use ' of our
fine public library, and the other day
we discovered we hadn't read half
the books on our own shelves. So
now I'm absorbed in 'Lea Mlaer
ables,' and Jack is reading one of
Thackeray's that he hadn't happened
to read: both books right off our own
bookshelves. So you see. by driving
us to make better use of our resources
our forced economy has been rather
a good thing after all."
How many times this happens!
That is, how many times some un
welcome necessity "by driving us to
make better use of our resources,"
.teaches us how much larger these re
sources were than we realized.
Another friend of mine who suf
fered a sudden reduction of income
had to give up buying the new clothes
she had planned last spring. But
when she came to look over the
wardrobe which she had in stock she
was surprised to nnd now many
tiungs sns naa ana how much a lit
tle taste and money -would do with
them. '"There were two or three thin
dresses " that Just : had some little
thing the matter with them." she told
me afterward. "If I had had as much
money as usual I would have thought
I couldn't do anything with them. As
Jt was I fixed them up and everybody
liked them. Then instead of buying
new grey suede shoes I dyed a soiled
white pair. I did a lot of things Uke
that and I felt that I had -almost as
much as usual. I certainly didn't
realise tbe possibilities of what I al
ready - had until I was driven into
really using them." .
Again, it is not alone in material
things that we must be driven into
using our full resources. I remember
a time in my life when I was pecu
liarly alone, when I had no one to
whom I could turn, no one to whom
I could shift my responsibilities if
they became too heavy. And Just be
cause I had no one to lean on I leaned
upon myself and developed more
character and self-reliance than I
ever would have under happier cir
cumstances. ,
Half the time we do not even
scratch the surface of our resources.
It takes necessity to drive ns in upon
them and teach us the full possibili
ties in our lives. . -

A FAMILT OF MANT RACES.
A wealthy woman of Chicago announces i
an intention to adopt and to raise to one
household as an equal family fifteen chil
dren chosen from aa many races. Ne
groes, Arabs. Chinese, Semites, Malaya,
are to be Included, as well as members of
the various Aryan peoples. It is the ex
pectation of the foster-mother that they
will grow up aa brothers and sisters sad
that she will have an Impartial love for
them all. The program Is tbe more at
tractive because of the extreme stress
that has been laid of late upon the prln
clple of heredity as the dominant element
In life. Eugeniats have discoursed of the
question aa if it were a conceded and es-:
tablished truth that to have a eugenic
child you. must provide eugenlo parents. -In
the face of the ten thousand men who :
have risen to eminence among their fel
lows from a parentage of want aad of
Ignorance, the advocates of "good birth" '
have been demanding state regulation of
marriage as a means of providing It. As ,:
the Chicago family is designed to test the -effect
of environment In shaping the char-;!
acters of children of different races. It is I
to be regretted It cannot be tried out un
der better conditions than are now possi
ble. The foster-mother may teach equal-'
Hy in the home, but when the young play
mates go out upon tbe streets and to the
