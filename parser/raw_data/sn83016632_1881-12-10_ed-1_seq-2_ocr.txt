and anti-Stalwart agencies were at
work to organize the caucus in fav

outside agencies. After a very
heated discussion Hon. T. T,
Ailaib, the Don (Cameron) of
Louisiana, a Stalwart of tbe Stal

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
-p . . ; .f> ; •
In our^coljims to-day will be
found a syoopsya of the President's
Message. It portray* the ability
and candor of the man who pre
sides over the destinies of fifty
millioas of people. It i* one of
the best state papers that ever
emenated from the White House.
No unnecessary gush or platitudes
over sections or individuals. No
crocodile tears over tbe Nations
wards nor vain polices or political
intriguée but a straight forward
business message treating every
man woman and child in the nation
upon the same'equality as citizens.
Colored Republicans of tbe South
can congratulated themselves that
for once they are not msde a dis
tinct class but will be treated as
all other citizens and will be pro
tected in their rights ii? common
with all others. Our foreign rela
tions are elaborately treated show
ing that the President is capable
of grappling with all subjects in
which the government are interest
ed. The South has nothing to
complain of by way of internal im
provements. Tue Mississippi river
the great commercial highway of
the South and West especially New
Orleana has received considerable
attention and no doubt with the
activity of our 'representatives in
Congress some wholesome legisla
tion will be passed in keeping with
tbe President's message that will
greatly benefit tbe South. Tbe
Indian question is a prominent
feature in the message. The broad
liberal and comprehensive views
expressed by tbe President upon
this vexed question should be duly
considered, the justice and practic
ability of which is plain to all.
There can be no doubt of tbe Pres
ident's position relative to mor
monism that great prostituting ele
ment which threatens tbe moral,
and soeial relations of tbe entire
naHon. Tbe President deals with
this subject with more ability and
decision then any of bis prodeces
sors, should Congress pass favora
bly npon his recommendation, tbe
great evil will be wiped out of exis
tence. The great variety of sub
jects treated in the message and
the able manner in wbieh they are
bandied shows a broad and com
prenbension mind,whilst tbe whole
paper his about it an orginality
seldom found in euch documents.
Tbe most important question to
us is that of education, which ia
prominently brought out iu the
message and to which we will give
special notice in another issne, we
trust that Congres* will pay special
beed to the President's suggestions
And legislate accordingly.
The Statutes of Civil Service re
form is practioally settled by tbe
wise suggestions of tbe President
which if aeted npon, cannot fail to
briog about happy results. In
competent and ignorant individuals
should not be appointed to promi
nent positions non should book
learning and tbe school boys npti
tude of answering questions be tbe
necessary tests as fitness for posi
tions : The views expressed in the
message explains themselves and
are tbe best suggestion that have
been made npon tbe subject. Space
will not allow an elaborate com
ment npon tbe able and dignified
paper but we present it to our peo
pie as one of tbe best indications of
a good and bappy administration
led by a bold able and truthful
President'

THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
Tbe Governor's Message ere this
have been read and spread all over
the State by those interested in
State affairs. It is an able docu
ment, setting forth the specisl
cannes for which tha session was
called. As tbe message is a special
one and not general, we cannot of
fer any criticisms is to the Govern
or's poliov. Treating npon tbe
prosperity of the State the Gov. says
that matters generally are in a
prosperous State» and that tha
relations between all classes are in
a happy condition. To a large ex
tent this is true at present, and we
hope that it is tbe determination
of the Governor to keep tfaem sa
We will be in a position to test the
sineerity of these remarks. Shortly
we will have Congressional elections
THE MEW UKLE iN S WEEKLY' LOblblANlAV
in thia Statj^whef the time nomas
if Rcpnblièana call appear upon
the hosting* in «ter; part of tbe
State without molestation, with
out violenoe, or interference of any
kind, if they will be allowed to goto
tbe polls on election day and cast
their votes in accordance with
their honest oonvictions and have
that that vote honestly counted,
then we will s«y that n new era will
have dawnedi n Louisiana. No one
ia better able to bring about this
state of afiairs than Gov. MoEnery.
Representing that section of the
eonntry where lawlessness predom
inates, his ediee will be rsspeeled if
they are iasued with that determi
nation which has characterized f II
of hie actione . in the past We
trust that the Governor will bring
about this result. We will await
patiently expecting-that all of our
rights will lie respected as -guaran
teed nndar tha Constitution of. tbe
United States.
A HANDSOME COMPLIMENT.
On Isst Thursday the House of
Representatives adopted the follow
ing resolutiod :
Resolved, That the chairman of
the Committee on Contingent Ex
Senses of the House, be, and is here
y autorized to pay at the close of
the session the sum of fifty dol ars
($50) to one representative of eaeh
of the fo'lowing journals who report
the Honse for their respeetive papers,
to wit ; City Item, Times-Democrat,
Bee, Picayune, Gecman Gazette and
States.
The next day Hon. T. T. Allain,
the worthy Representative of Iber
ville Parish, who is ever on the alert
to advance the interests of the whole
people discovered that the Loui
siamian had been overlooked and
emitted from the résolution and just
before adjournment suceeeded ia
obtaining a suspension of the rules of
tbe House, a reconsideration snd
amendment of the resolution so as
to include the Louisiania ^. and its
readoption as amended. It is an
achievement of whtoh Mr. Allain
may be justly proud and for which
we beleive né will be warmly com
mended by the colored people of tne
State in whose special interest the
Louisinian is published.
We take special notice of this com
pliment by the House, not on ar
count of the pecuniary aid exten
ded to our representative, but be
cause we regardait as the highest
kind of reeogaition of the represen
tative caracter of tbe Looisiiiux, and
indicative of the rapid groth of public
sentiment toward the recognition of
the manhood and citizenship of the
oolored element in the commonwealth.
In this respect it is both significant
and important It is the forerunner
of the happy era for which we have
labored earnestly and long—a mutual
respect for each other by the two
races composing the population of
the State. When this principle is
more firmly rooted among our
people the foundation of an enduricg
properity for Louisiana will be laid
so broad and deep that time itself
cannot disturb it. Irreeoncilables
may struggle against it hut'to this
complexion , it must come and . we
hail the action of the House as the
first atre^k of light of tbe dawning of
the glorious day.

Synopsis of the President's
Message.
To the Sonate and House of Ropresentatire*
of the United States :
An appalling calamity Mn's befallen the
Ainericuu peuple since their chosen re
présentatives l»st met in the halls where
you ato now assembled. We might also
recall with unalloyed content the rare
prosperity with which throughout the
year the nation bas been blessed. Its
harvests has been plenteous, its vitrions
industries have tb'iven, the health of its
people has been preserved, it has main
tained with foreign governments the un
disturbed relations of amity und peace.
For these manifestations of His tuvur we
owe to Him who holds our destiny ii:
His bands the tribute of onr grateful de
votion. To that mystarious extreme of
His will wbicb bai taken from us the b<
loved, and illustrious citizen who was but
lately the head of the nation, wo bow in
sorrow and submission. The memories
of bis exalteJ character, of his noble
achievements, aud of his patriotic lifo,
will be treasured torn ver as a sacrd pos
sesion of the whole people, the an
uouncenieu' of los death drew from for
eign KovermiK-iits and peoples tributes of
sympathy aud s rrow* which history will
rocoid a* a signal tikou of tli« kinship vl
nations und the federation of mankind
The feeling of goodwill b*tt#fcen our own
guvuinmunt aud that of Great Britain was
nevermore lunrked than at (resent. In
recognition of this pleasiug tact, I direct
ed, ou the occasion of the 1 »to centeuuial
celebration at Yerktown, that a salute Ira
giv»n to the liritish flag.
PUBLIC EDCCATIOS.
Although our system of gov*rnin<>nt
does not contemplate that the nation
should provide or support a system of
edncation of our people, no measures cal
culated to promote the gen«ral intellig
ence and virtue, upon which the perpet
uity of our institutions so greatly de
pends, have ever been regarded with in
difference by Congress or tbe Executive.
A large portion of the public domain has
been, from time to time, devoted to the
promotion of education. There is now a
special reason why, by setting apart the
roceeds of its sales of public iauds ot
Er«
roceeds of its sales of public iauds ot
Er«
y gome other course, the govern nient
should aid tbe work of education. Many
who now exercise the rlgbt of suffrage
are nnnble to >*ead the ballot which they
cast. Upon mauy who had just emerged
from a coudiriou of slavery wero sudd, u
ly devolved tbe responsibilities of citizen
ship in h portion of tbe country most im
poverished l>- war. I have been plo.tsed
to feari t front the report of the Commis
sioner of Education that there has lately
b«-eu a commendable increase of interest
aud effort fer their instruction, but all
that can be done by local legislation mid
private generosity ehouid be supplement
eil by such aid as can be constitutionally
afforded by the national government. I
would suggest that if any fund be dedic
stud to tiiis purpose it may be wisely dis
tributed in different States according to
the ratio of illitenry, as by this mi aus
such localities which are more iu neeil
of such assistance will roap its special be
nefits. 40
INTZHNAL IMPROVEMENTS.
I advise appropriations for snoh in
ternal improvements as the wisdim ot
Congress may deem to be of public im
portance. The necessity of improving
the navigation of the Mississippi river
justifies a special allusion to that subject.
1 suggest the adoption of soin« measure
for the removal of obstructions which
now impede the nxvigatiou of that grand
channel ot commence.
CIVIL SXBTICK mxrosM.
In my letter accepting the nomination
for the Vice-Pre «idency, I stated that in
mv judgment no man shonld be an in
cumbent of an office the duties of wbicb
he is from any eau e unfit to perform;
who is lacking in the ability, fidelity or
integrity which a proper administration
of such officé de.nauds. This sentiment,
would donbil-ss meet with gcueral ac
quiescence, but opinion bas been widely
divided upon the wisdom aud practicabi
lity of the various reformatory schemes
which have b?en suggested and of cer ain
proposed regulations has been distrusted
mainly because they have seemed to exact
more educational and abstract tests above
general business capacity, and even spe
cial fitness for the particular work in
hand. It seems to me that the rules
which should be applied to the manage
ment of the public service may properly
oonform ;n the maiu to such as regulate
tbe conduct of successful prvate busi
ness. Original appointments should be
based on ascertained fitness. The tenure
of office should, so far as practicable, be
filled l>y the promotion of worthy and
efficient officers. The investigation ot
all tomplainta and punishment of all of
ficial misconduct should be prompt and (
thorough.

CULLINGS FROM THE GOV
ERNOHS MESSAGE.
Executive Depibtmsmt. (
New Orleaus, December 5, 1881. )
Gentlemen of the Senate and House of
Representatives:
On the seventh day of November I it
sued a proclamation conventng the .Gen
eral Assembly in special session in the
city of New Orleans on the fifth day of
December. 1881. This proclamation was
not issued without mature consideration.
In my opinion the exigencies contemplat
ed in Article 72 of th« Constitution had
arisen, irtd I could not see any way to
avoid calling tbe extra session. I am fully
aware ot the responsibility which resu
upon the Executive in exercising the dis
cretionary power vested in him by Mid
article, and only tbe gravest considem
tioca of public duty controlled me in its
exercise. There was a demand for au
extra gestion in various portion« ot the
State, and in otber portions it was op
posed. All the matters alleged for aud
aga nst were taken under advisement,
and step by step the reasons for au early
aesdon of th* Legislature became more
ud more imperative, until I could no
Wnger hesitate to cull it. Whether it
shall prove a success or not, wether tbe
objects for which it is called shall meet
with approbation or not, depends opôn
tbe wisdom oi the General Assembly.
Tbe time for whioh it is called, the in
most limit fixed by the Constitution, is so
short the most energetic efforts of Sana
tors and Representatives to enact tbe
necct-SMary legislation embraced in the
call will b® required.
I have carefully avoided incorporating
any subject of legislation liable to canne
dissension or provoke opposition. The
matters embraced in the proclamation
are of vital importance to tha Stat«.
There can be but one object ifa each csm,
which is to grant the relief demanded.
There may be diversity of opinion ** to
the manner of granting such relief, bat
none as to the object. houœ I air fnlly
convinced that abort discusstoiis will re
sult in oorrect conclusions, and but little
delay will be experienced in perfecting
necessary legislation.
MUS OBJECTS Or THE 8PIGUI. SESSIOK,
The chief object for which ao extra ses
sion is called are : lo provide an ade
quate ravanne for mr to m ri*cii>
agent,
I respectfully call yonr attention to set
No. 73 of 1880, in relation to the indebt
edness of tbe Stat* to tbe Fiscal Agent,
and recommend that it be ao amended as
to make tbe appropriations pece*riary to
pay tbe intereat on aaid indebtedness ° ut
of theinteresMnnd instead of the general
fund. Tha debt to tha Fiscal Agent was
created by the payment of intereat eou
pons, and as there w now a surplus,
to the credit o: the interest fund, aud M
