THE MESSAGE.-We publish t6-day what purports to
be the message of President Grant. If the language
be not that used by the distinguished gentleman, he
must hold "the operator at the other end of the line's
responsible. It was impossible for us to eliminate sense
from some of his serpentinous sentences. It will be
seen that the government expenditures, including the
interest bonds, are put at $32,149,597 for the fiscal
year ending June 30th, 186;9. Now, little regard as
Grant has for truth, as evidenced in his controversy
with Johnson, he never could have said that-he prob
ably wrote it $321,149,597.

COMPLIMENTARY BENEFIT.--We are happy to an
nounce that, in response to the private wishes of a
numberof our citizens and our own publication of yes
terday, a complimentary benefit will be given to our
liberal manager, Capt. Crisp, on Thursday night. Thi,
benefit is intended as a publ!ic token of our apprecia
tion of a cultivated gentleman and his family, and as
an earnest of our wishes for his professionnal succes
among us. Few men properly appreciate the i flu
ence of the theatre. To a large class, who never enter
the doors ofachurch, the stage is, if we may so speak, a
sort of pulpit, preaching in the words of the poet-dr.,
matist to listening ears, that are beyond the reach of
the church. Shakespeare speaks to those to whom Til
lotson or Jeremy Taylor stand as did Paul on the hill
of Mars. And in addition to this consideration, as
mankind require amusement and will have it, as much
and even more than they demand preaching, the thea
tre, as compared with other entertainments, is as far
superior to them in its moral and social influences, as.
in the former respect, it is ininferior to the pulpit
And further, both because its moral and social infiu b
ence is better than that of any public mnode of instruc ae
tion, combining amusement, it in a commercial sense,
pays better than any other kind of exhibition. It pays
the patrons of a city, we are sorry to say, even better of
than it does the artist who has devoted his life and ti
talents to his profession. But we did not inttend tI
moralise. What was in our mind to say, is brief T
this: We are entitled, as a city, to a good theatre, and
the manager who furnishes what we need, is entitled hn
to our remembrance, our support and our gratitude I
Let us give Crisp a bumper on Thursday, and all bear
in mind, that we owe a patronatge to the theatre as a vi.
duty, to an institution every way wortlty of it, and con
tinue to give it the necessary encouragement for the e
season. The plays selected are Macbeth, and Robert qu
McCaire-a splendid bill.
DISTRICT Counr.-The jury in the case of Chas. A.
Gary, for the murder of W. G. Pickens, after being out
two nights and one day failed to agree upon a verdict
and were discharged. We understand that at one time
they stood eleven for acquittal and one for conviction
but at the close three swung around the circle and the
vote stood eight for acquittal and four for conviction.
P'RICE o REAL ESTATE.-If thle value of laud, as
many political economists contend is the measure of
financial prosperity, our section is in a healthy condi
tion. On Saturday last, P. II. Rosson, Auctioneer,
sold at public auction the Brack plantation, situated
near Keachi in this parish, to tile CrowderBro., for
$18 50 per acre. The plantation consists of 1120
acres, of which 500 or 600 acres were under cultivta
tion. The place brought the handsome sum of $20,
720. The terms were one-third cash and the balance
in one and two years, with eight per cent interest.
We were disposed to open our eyes at these figures,
but we learn that a place between Bellerieu and
Minden recently changed hands, at uuction, at very
near the same figures. The fact is, there is money to r
spare and to invest in this section, and, until marnu
factories are started, there is no margin iu anything t
xccept lands. We expect to see uplands go to $20 per
acre in DeSoto, Bossier and Caddo.
BURGLARY.-Sometime between Tuesda- night and s
Wednesday morning at dy-ligght, the dry goods store
of Martin Tally, on Milam street, was entered by bur
glars and robbed of about $200 00 in specie and
$150 00 in currency. The store was ransacked from C
one end to the other, and some articles of dry goods i
may have been taken. The money was in shot sacks
hid away under a pile of dry goods a.d tile thieves c
must have known all about it, or hlave been nnconm
monly lucky that night. They effected an entrance to t
the store by prying open the front door. As yet tirere cl
is no clue to the burglars. It stands our people to be cc
on the watch now, as our city, we are informed, is t
full of professional thieves. In the language of a New re
Orleans detective, " Your little city is full of d-d
scoundrels, and if you don't look out you will all be
robbed."
FATAL ACCIDELr.-.Last evening, as the freight H
train of the Southern Pacific lRailroad was passing at
under the bridge at Mugginsville, an employe acting mi
In the capacity of brakesman, and who was at the ttr
time standing on the roof of a car, was knocked off PP
and instantly ki W faill.d to learn the name of 1t
the deceased.
KILLED.--Last evening, about 9 o'clock, at the wi
corner of Texas and Market streets, Ed. Bird was
stabbed by a man named Harris and instantly killed. f
Harris was arrested and taken to jail.
THE INcaxr TA .-The Washingtoo correspondent th
of tile Courier-Journal, under date of the 22d, s.n.
that "notwithstanding the well ascertained tact, that de
neither Secretary Boutwell nor Commissioner Delano lat
will recommend any modification of the incometax, sib
the question will be brought directly before Congress Sot
at the coming session. This tax expires by lhmitation ed,
during next year and it rwill base to be renewed at this wa
session if it is to be continued beyond the timte named an
Judging from the well know views of Senators and ent
members it is more than probable that thie rate will be
reduced to the old figure of three per cent. or perhaps
to two per cent. A calculatioa has been made, show- " d
ing that an income tax, if properly .collected, can be, ion
made to yield twenty millions per annum at the rate of ant
two per cent. 1 Is t
Soew Orleans and the Country.
As we predicted some time ago, the merchants of
New Orleans and New York who sold large stocks of
goods on a credit to ccuntry merchants and planters
have commenced howling. The cry is a little sooner
than we anticipated, but not the less sharp and shrill.
The New Orleans Times claims to be in receipt of what
it terms extraordinary letters from the interior of thi:
State, in which the existence of fraudulent cotton rings
is referred to as an indisputable fact. As an ofset, or
antidote, it notices the receipt of letters from mer
chants of that city, charging the cotton producers with
a violation of good'faith bf keeping back their cotton
on the most unjustifiable pretexts, the result of which
is, that their debts to the merchants of New Orleans
are not paid, and a general scarcity of money is the
conseqtence. Our cotemporary, in behalf of the mer
chants of New Orleans, argues as follows as to the im
practicability of a ring:
The formation of a ring for the purpose of controll
ing the price of eotton is utterly impossible, in view of
g. the many conflicti,.g interests which would have to be
harmonised before such a result could be attained.
When it is remembered that India, Egypt and other
countries have something to say on the cotton ques
tion, and when a proper degree of faith is accorded
to the powers of demand and supply in regulating
prices, it will hardly be contended that any local 'ring"
can fix the price of a staple which is an object of such
universal desire. Our American cotton raisers must
remember that the cotton supply is not now, as it once
was, almost entirely in their hands. Of the 4,272,000
hales consumed in 1860, our cotton fields produced
3,4j7,000 bales, or more than three-fourths of the
a whole amouslt; whereas, in 1869, of the 4,503,000
hales raised and sold, America furnished but 1,432,000
bales, or but little more than one-fourth of the total
product. Such facts attest the insufficiency of local
rings to accomplish that which has been alleged against
them, without taking into consideration the constant
pressure of competition among purchasers in the varil
ous countries where cotton is consumed. If any proof
can be furnished by our country correspondents of the
actual existence of such rings as those of which they
complain, we would take great pleasure in assisting
theta to make the necessary exposure. Moreover, we
feel inclined to thiuk that the good weather we have
had for picking cotton has had more to do with the
keeping back of the staple from our market than any
desire on the part of platters to evade the payment of
their obligations.
Without entering into the controversy as to who is
in fault for the scarcity of money at this time, we must
say that the plalter or merchant who owes his factor
in New Orleans, or anywhere else, for goods or sup
plies furnished, and has the means at hand, as many of
them have, to pay, and will not do it, no matter what
may be the excuse, is a' disgrace to humanity anda fit
subject for the penitentiary. It was certainly a cute
idea on the part of the country people to accuse the
merchants of New Orleans of a dirty trick in order to
screen themselves from a similar charge. We hardly
think the Times' article has little if any reference to
this immediate community, but should the coat fit, we
suppose our cotemporary would not object to their
splurging in it.
One THE STEAMER RICHMOND ScNK.-On Thursday after
s, noon, the 2d inst., the low water packet Richmond,
to Capt. W. T. Boardman, from New Orleans for this port,
as when about twelve miles below here struck a sawyer
o and sunk. From the time she struck it was seven hours
Sbefore her officers gave up all hopes of saving her. In
, the meantime the steamer Travis Wright, Capt. Reeder,
bound down with a load of cotton, came along side and
was the means of saving part of the freight. The
an Richmond lays across the river, with the water over
her lower deck and is considered a total loss. She is
s- greatly in the way of passing steamers and will have
to be broken up or pulled out of the channel to facili
ii tate navigation. The officers of the Richmond de
' -serve c, edit for the efforts made to save the boat and
S gc;,go, and although the former is lost most of the lat
rer will be saved. The opportune appearance of the
n Travis Wright was a god-send. The manifest of the
; ost's trip will be found in another column. We are I
'"ot apprised of the value of the boat or whether she
was insured. The Richmond, though not quite so
'1 yoing as some of the new boats in the trade, was con- I
i sidered among the best. The Travis Wright returned i
il to this port with the officers, passengers and part of
5 the freight.
ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATEs.-The telegraph
r informs us that Motley has opened negotiations with
the English government on the subject of the Alabama
claims. The time which has elapsed since they were c
broken off has been sufficient for all parties to cool off,
and we see no reason why they should not be pushed ton e
final settlement at once, and have the matter out of the a
way. There is no doubt but that the existing ministry ii
of England is more in harmony with the United States
than in any time for years, and possibly it may not be
succeeded by one so liberal, should this be dissolved. e
The prime Minister, Mr. Gladstone, recently said that at
with Mr. Peabody's country England was not likely to
have a quarrel. Mr. Motley is no doubt conveniently it
located and has had time to make himself familliar o
with the Alabama question, and it will be hard to con
vince the people that the matter should be further de- h
layed. The claim should now be settled at once by F
either a fight or a foot race, so that old Sumner could TI
have a little time to spread himself on the Chinese dt
question.
TELEGRAPH COMPANIES NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ER- fU
RoRs.-An Atlanta (Ga.) dispatch, of the 17th ult., li
says the Supreme Court of that State, the day before, be
rendered the decision in the case of O'Neill vs. the
Western Union Telegraph Company. The damages fu
claimed were $2000, for an error in the transmission th
of a telegraph message. The court and jury decided
that telegraphic companies are not considered comn di.
mon carriers, and that they are not responsible for er. be
rors of atmospheric electricity, over which they have se,
no control; that the printed rules and regulations of So
the telegraph company are a special contract, binding thi
on the parties who use the telegraph lines; and that adm
the damages awarded the plaintiff were actual ex- adj
penses for the transmission of a message, and express nag
expenses on a money package mis-sent by the error of une
the telegraph. The court also decided that telegraph set
compaties are not responsible for errors, delays, etc., Ve
when their lines are under the control and supervision Ohi
of the military authority.
Id CHEROKEE INDIANS IN NORTH CAROLINA.-The New
y York Herald says that a delegation of the Cherokee
:o nation, still residing in North Carolina, arrived in Wash
t- ington a few days since with a view to arranging with
g the Indian Department some plan looking to their re
r moral to the Indian Territory, to which country the
bulk of their people transferred the seat of theircouncil
d some years ago. It is also stated that the delegation
will bring up some important matters in relation to
certain financlal transactions with thegovernment. It
appears that a fund of $80,848 was appropriated by
Congress to complete the removal of the North Caro
lina Cherokees west of the Mississippi. Until the re
moral of the Indians in question they were only to re
ceire the interest-six per cent per annum. During
the war this interest was necessarily not paid. During
the past season this amount was paid up. There are
charges, and it appears well founded, that gross mis
conduct has occurred in the payment of this amountto
the Indians; that Indians known to be dead are rep
resented as receivirg their share of the amount.
THEn FsrsEENTH AMENDMENT IN TEsNNEasa.-The
action of Tennessee in the matter of rejecting the
Fifteenth Amendment, is an earnest of better days.
Having for herself, as was her unquestionable prerog
ative, conferred the right of suffrage upon all races
within her borders, she concedes to her sister States
the privilege of regulating their own affairs in that re
spect in their own way. The members of the Legis
lature, in refusing to assist Radicalism in trampling
upon the equitable rights of others, have exhibited a
conscientious regard for the principles of comity,
which entitles them to the gratitude of all who would t
preserve what yet remains to ns of the government
founded by our patriotic fathers. t

THE NEW HATTIEN MINITaa.--ARadical paper sys i
that the new Haytien Minister, who presented his cre- p
dentials to the President the other day, is a light mu
latto in color, and has held several positionsof respon
sibility in Iis country, the last being that of Foreign
Secretary. He is a gentleman ? of ability and finished c
education, and made his little speech in French. He li
was in this country during the first year of our war, a
and offered his services to raise and command a regi- a
ment of colored troops.
The Washington Chronicle rays that the Democrats
"dog Gen. Grant." Prentice, however, is of theopi.
ion that those who give him so many pointes, ae
and hounds, are the fellows wbo "dog" hins.
Is right.
Resumption of Specie Payment.
aof This subject is now attracting the attention of not
s of only the press of the country, but the mass of the
ters people, and the matter is being discussed pro and con
mer with a good deal of vim. It is one of those subjects
rill. which the advocates of both sides adduce plausible ar
that guments and leave the innocent aspirant in search of
this " every thing for the best" as much in the dark as
ngs ever. One thing is very evident, from the tenor of
,or the dispatches, that many of the leading merchants
ner- and politicians of the North, to say nothing of the
cith bond-holders, are in favor of the movement being in
ston troduced at once.
rich Hon. E. G. Spaulding, the author of the Legal
ass Tender Act, who has lately put before the public a very
the valuable financial history of'the war, has furnished the
oer- Buffalo Commercial, for publication, the following
im- three letters-one of which, at least, foreshadows the
policy of the administration :
ooll PROM ATTORNEY.GENERAL HOAR.
v of WASHINGTON, Oct. 15, 1869.
Hon. E. G. Spaulding-
r. My Dear Sir: Im am one of those who believe
that it was the interest as well as the duty of the na
ded tion to return at once to the true and solid standard of
value as soon as active hostilities ceased; that we
1a should have treated the currency as we did our arm
mel ies, regarding the volunteers and the greenbacks alike
ust as necessities of war, to be dispensed with as fast as
possible on the return of peace. I think we made a
n0e great mistake in not doing so ; that the shortest method
ed was the safest and the best; that the only way to reach
the the object is by a steady and persistent contraction of
)00 the currency, a painful process whenever it comes, no
doubt, but harder anid worse for us the longer it is de
)00 layed.
t1 I hope that Congress will address itself with cour
nct age and constancy to the solution of the problem as
ant soon as it meets, and will feel assured that the Ameri
nri can people have intelligence enough to support those
rof who do it. My views on the subject are of little im
e portance to any body, but, as an American citizen, I
should be sorry and ashamed to find my country un
ey able and unwilling, in a time of peace and prosperity,
ag to provide for its over due paper.
we Very respectfully, E. R. Hfoa.
he FROM HORACE MAYNARD, OF TENNLSSEE.
iy KNOXVILLE, TENN., Nov. 3, 1869.
of Hon. E.G. Spaulding
Dear Sir: Thanks for the books, as well as the
i copy sent me. It is well timed and much needed.
So successful were the financial arrangements during
the war, that people incline to believe them as auto
or matic, self-accomplished, with no special credit to any
P. body. * * a *
of As a result, we now have the best currency ever
known in the nation. Let it now be made convertable
at into coin, at the pleasure of the holder, and nothing
fit would be left to be discussed. Why this has not been
te done, why it is not done, why it should not be done, I
confess, after all I have heard and read, I am not able
to see. One of these days some bold man will take
to the step, and then every body will wonder why it had
ly not been taken years before. Would that you were
to again at your old place in the House.
I am, very truly, yours, HORACE MAYNARD.
FROM CHARLES SUMNER.
ir BOSTON, August 8, 1869.
My Dear Sir: You have done a good service in
preparing your book; nor is their any body to whom
r- this duty belonged more than yourself. * * * *
I am not content with the long postponement of specie
payments. I believe that the time has come for this
blessing, and I begin to be impatient when I see how
r easily people find excuses for not accepting it.
a Believe me, dear sir, very faithfully you.s,
n CHARLES SUMNER.
There is no question but a serious draw-back to re
d sumption exists in the apprehension that debts con
e tracted in currency will be collected in specie, and that
r creditors will thereby gain and debtors lose the amount
s of the difference between the specie dollar and the C
specie value of the dollar at the time the contract was J
made. The Picayune argues as follows, in relation to D
this matter: 0o
I There is strong ground for the conclusion that the 24
supreme Court would carry out a decision that the le
gal tender act is void and unconstitutional, by decid
ing that contracts made in currency aresolvable in the
currency at its valuation in specie ; that a promise to
pay $100, when gold was at a premium of 25 per cent.,
shall be satisfied with $80 in specie.
This is a clear logical deduction from the opinion of or
the court recently delivered, in giving judgment in pt
the case of a contract made in Confederate money dur- tb
ing the war. The decision wis, that the notes were a
currency in fact, imposed by a paramount authority, Ci
which made them a circulation by a necessity, in which of
the dealers had no choice. The currency of the Con- de
federacy was not lawful money of the United States,
but it was the sole medium for exchange, and on its Se
disappearance the contracts made under it must be th
construed as representing only actual value, estimated wi
on the restored standard. re
The same state of circumstances exists in respect to sa
the greenback currency. It was created by the Gov- ye
ernment, and became, by force of law and legal pen- pa
alties, the only circulation. If it shall be decided that at
it was issued unlawfully, by a government that had no th
constitutional power to issue it, but had the executive wi
power to keep it in circulation-in short, that it is not the
" lawful money " at all-the consequence follows, in- he
evitably, that the same doctrine of adjustment exists, its
as to them, which existed as to Confederate notes. to

to ROLL OF THE FORTY-FIRST CONGREss.-The Wash
tly ington correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial,
iar under date of the 22d ultimo, in a gossiping way, says
n-" the Journal Clerk of the House of Representatives
de- has just prepared a roll of all the members of the
by Forty-First Congress who have taken the oath of office.
ld This last embraces exactly two hundred names, and
does not include the name of Covode nor of the con
testant, Foster; and all cases of like nature held for
R- further determination are sixteen, not embraced in the
t", list. The six members elected from Virginia will not
e, be sworn in, if at all, until the State is admitted, and
e so, also, with the Mississippi five dist cts. Alabama
es furnishes four members, but they have not yet taken
n the oath. Sheldon, of Louisiana, is the only member
yd yet entitled to his seat from that State, out of the five
"* districts. Texas, if admitted, will furnish two mem
r- bers, and when the case of Georgia is finally decided,
7e seven representatives will be furnished by that State.
3f So the roll will shorw-a list of about two hundred and
'g thirty-two or three members, when all the States are
it admitted, which it is believed will be done before the
I adjournment of the present session. Five members
'5 named Smith have already taken the oath, and it is
If uncertain how many more may be added when the ab
h sent thirty are admitted. Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee,
" Vermont and Iowa each furnish a Smith, but only
n Ohio furnishes a John Smith."
DEATH or BENJ. FITZPATRICK.-A Montgomery dis
v patch of the 23d, states that ex-Governor Fitzpatrick,
e of Alabama, died at his residence in Elmore county,
Alabama, about eight miles from Montgomery, the
day before, aged 70 years. This is another of the dis
tinguished veterans of better timesgone. He was one
of Alabama's most distinguished sons, and onle which
I she delighted to honor. He was a shrewd, sagacious
I man, and an experienced politician. He filled the
office of United States Senator when it required men
t of worth to fill such positions. He served as presi
r dent pro tem of the Senate during Pierce's administra.
tion, and was nominated as a candidate for Vice Pres
ident on the Douglass ticket, but declined. As Gov
ernor of Alabama he was held in high esteem by both
parties for his integrity and conservatism.
BLACK vs. WHITrrE.-Out of thirty deatks in one week ,
in the city of Mobile, twenty-one were of the black b
race. Yet the population is less than one-third blacks, i
less than 18,000 to 36,000. This dieproportion is very p
great, but we believe is not more so than in many tl
other portions of the Sonth. All the legislation in the
world will not prevent a diminution of their numbers.
Their changed condition has been the death blow to
them as a race, and the remnant that will remain must
become much changed in habits and thoughts. The
census of 1870 will tell a tale that will prove how rap.
idly the negro race in this country is losing in numbers. N

IMPOaTANT TO DEALERS IN ToBAcco.-The Courier- at
Journal of the 23d, says that the provisions of section 31
70 and 71 of the internal revenue law, all cigars and gi
tobacco, including stock on hand before the passage of Ir
the law, must be duly stamped before being offered 8C
for sale. A failure to comply with the law renders
the articles subject to seizure and confiscation. Several
selzusre have recently been made, and others will fol.
low, and our dealers should see that the law is com- p
plied with if they would prevent loss to themselves. s

WAlaSN xa Tfrx.-The New Orleans Republican of re
the 20th ultimo, says that B. F. Butler will visit that wi
city in a few weeks. This is very kind in the Repub- tic
iBan, and if the citizens of New Orleans lo6seall their en
ailver sware,:it wilt not be becaBhe they were not Ga

vidual who was published by the newspapers in the
city and country as having made a bold attempt to

should be retained in an office of trust under the Gov

nt., FROM WASHINGTON.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.-A vigorous fight is pending
o of over private claims, contestants holding that the re
in pudiation of these gives a cue to the repudiation of
or. the whole debt.
ea It is reiterated upon the very best authority that the
ity, Circuit Judgeship of the fifth district has never been
ich officially tendered to Durant. He has therefore never
on. declared his position.
,es, The President recommends the prompt admission of
its Senators and Representatives from Virginia, and hopes
be the results in Missiesippi and Texas have been such as
ted will meet the approval of Congress. He suggests the
removal of the tax on incomes, but at a reduced rite,
to say three per cent., and the tax to expire in three
ov- years. He says the immediate resumption of specie
an- payments is not desirable, though it should be reached
ant at the earliest moment consistent with a fair regard for
no the debtor class, and recommends such legislation as
ive will insure a gradual return to specie payment and end
tot the fluctuation in the value of currency. To this end
in- he recommends authority ti. the treasury to redeem
Its, its own paper at a fixed price whenever presented, and
to withhold from circulation all currency so redeemed
until sold again for gold. National resources, devel
sh- oped and undeveloped, should make our credit the
al, best in the world, and the debt could be paid in ten
years, but it is not desirable that the people should be
ys taxed to pay it in that time. The message says: As 1
'es the United States is the freest of all nations, its people
he sympathise with all people struggling for liberty and
self-government ; but while sympathizing it is due to
our honor that we should refrain from enforcing our
od views upon unwilling nations, and from taking an in
n. terested part without invitation in the quarrels be
or tween different nations, or between governments and
he their subjects. Our course should strictly conform
with strict justice and interantional and local laws. I
ot Such has been the policy of the administration in deal- o
ad ing with these questions.
a Regarding Cuba, it says notwithstanding the warm
sympathy entertained for her, the contest at no time
n assumed the condition which proved the existence of a
er de facto political organisation of the insurgents suffi- t
re cient to justify a recognition of belligerency. The 1
a- principle is maintained, however, that this nation is its a
own judge when to accord the rights of belligerency, I
either to a people struggling to free themselves from a
e. government they believe oppressive, or to indepen- t
d dent nations at war with each other. The United F
States have no disposition to interfere with the exist
ing relations ot Spain to her colonial possessions.

THE INDIAN PEACE CoMMIssION.-This body met at n

of the Western papers says the gist of the report is t
that the Commission came to the conclusion that their g
mission has proven a.great success, and is likely to c'
secure a more permanent peace among the Indian a
tribes than years of the military policy. They found Pl
that in many instances the Indians had been swindled at
out of their annuities; that treaties had been violated at
by the whites, and in two cases lands appropriated m
which had been conveyed to tribes by the United States tb
by express stipulation. This Commission are of opin- i
ion that the task can be successfully performed of C
placing all the tribes on the reservations and civilizing th
them. lo

President's Message.
[Telegraphed expressly for the South-Western.]
Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Bepreasntvves :
In coming before you for the first time as chief mag
istrate of this great nation, it is with gratitude to the
giver of all good for the many benefits we enjoy. We
are blessed with peace at home; without entangling al
liance abroad to,forbodetrouble. With a territory un
surpassed in fertility, and of area equal for an abundant
support of five hundred millions of people; abounding
in every variety of useful minerals, and in quantity suffi
cient to supply the world for generations; exuberant
crops, a variety of climate, and adapted to the produc
tion of every speciesTof the earth's riches, and suited to
the habits, and requirements of every living thing; a
population of forty millions of free people, speaking one
language, with facilities for every mortal to acquire an
education of its institutions, closing to none the ave
nues of fame or any blessing or fortune that may be
coveted, and the freedom of the pulpit, the press and
schools. Revenue is flowing into the national treasury
beyond the requirements of the Government. Hap
pily, harmony is being rapidly restored within our own
borders. Manufactories, hitherto unknown in our
country, are springing up in all sections, producing a
degree of national independence unequalled by any
other power. These blessings, and countless others,
are entrusted to your care and mine for sate keeping for
the brief period of our tenure of office. In this short
time we must each of us return to theranks of the peo
ple, who have confided in our honors, and account to
them for our stewardship. I earnestly desire that
neither you nor I may be condemned by the free and
enlightened constituency, nor by our own consciences.
Eleven States of the Union were, four years ago, left
without legal state governments; a national debt had
been contracted; American commerce was almost driven
from the seas; the industry of one-half of the country
had been taken from the control of capitalists and placed
where all labor rightfully belongs, in the keeping of
laborers. The work of restoring state governments,
loyal to the union, of protecting and fostering free
labor, providing means for paying the interest on the
public debt has received ample attention from Congress.
Although your efforts have net met with success in all
the particulars that might have been desired, yet on the
whole, they have been more successful than could have
been reasonably anticipated. Of eleven States which
passed ordinances of secession, seven have been fully
restored to their places in the Union. The eight, Geor
gia, held an election, at which she ratified a constitu
tion, Republican in form, elected a Governor, members
of Congress, a State Legislature, and other officers re
quired. The Governor was installed, the Legislature
met and passed all the acts then required of it by the
reconstruction acts of Congress. Subsequently, how
ever, in violation of the constitution which they had
just ratified, as since decided by the Supreme Court of
the State, they unseated colored members of the Legis
lature and admitted to seats some members who are dis
qualified by the third clause of the Fourteenth amend
ment, an article which they themselves had contributed
to ratify. Under these circumstances, I would submit
to you whether it would not be wise, without delay, to
enact a law authorising the Governor of Georgia to
convene the members originally elected to the legisla
ture, requiring each to take the oath prescribed by the
reconstruction acts, and none be admitted who are dis
qualified under third clause of the Fourteenth amend
ment.
The freedmen under the protection which they have
rceeived, are making rapid progress in learning, and no
complaints are heard of the lack of industry on their
part where they receive fair remuneration for their
labor.
r. The means provided for paying the interest on the
Spublic debt, with all other expenses ofthe government,
0" are more than ample. The loss of our commerce is
"- the only result of the late rebellion which has not re
il- ceived sufficient attention from you. To this subject I
call your earnest attention. I will not now suggest
, plans by which this object may be effected, but will, if
ie, necessary, make it the subject of a special message
during the session of Congress. At the March term,
d- Congress, by joint resolution, authorised theExecutive
to order elections in the States of Virginia, Mississippi
P- and Texas, to submit to them Constitutions which each
t- had previously framed, either entire or in separate
:o parts, to be voted upon at the discretion of the Execu
tive. Under this authority, an election was called in
Virginia, and the election took place on the 6th July.
SA Governor and Lieut. Governor have been elected and
n installed; Legislature met and did all that was required
of them by this resolution and by all the reconstruc
tion acts of Congress, and abstained from all doubtful
authority. I recommend that her Senators and Rep
resentatives be promptly admitted to theirieats, and
c- that State be fully restored to its place in the family of
States. Elections were called in Mississippi and Texas,
s to commence on 80th of November-two days in Mis
' sissippi and four days in Texas. The elections have
taken place, but the result is not known. It is hoped
° that the acts of the legislatures of these States, when
is they meet, will be such as to receive your approval, and
if thus close the work of reconstruiction.
Among the evils growing out of the rebellion, and
not yet referred to, isthat of an irredeemable currency.
It is an evil which I hope will receive your most earnest
attention. It is a duty, and one of the highest duties
of the Government, to secure to its citizens a medium
of exchange, of fixed, invariable value. This implies
ga return to a specie basis, and no substitute for it can
be devised. It should be commenced now, and reached
at the earliest practicale moment consistent with a fair
regard to the interests of the debtor class. An immedi
ate resumption, if practicable, would not be desirable.
It would compel the debtor class to pay.beyond their
contracts the premium on gold at the date of their pur
chase, and would bring bankruptcy and rnfi to thous
ands. Fluctuations in paper is detrimental to the in
terests of trade, it makes the man of business an inol
untary gambler, for in all sales where future payment
is to be ma!Li both parties speculate as to what will be
the value o.he currency to be paid and received. I
earnestly recommend to you, then, such legislation as
will insure a gradual return to specie payments, and
put an immediate stop to fluctuation in the value of
currency. The methods to secure the former of these
results, are as numerous as speculators on political t
economy. To secure the latter I see but one way, and t
that is, to authorise the Treasury to redeem its own
paper at a fixed price whenever presented, and to with- 0
hold from circulation all currency so redeemed until d
sold again for gold. The vast resources of the nation, t
both developed and undeveloped, ought to make our
credit the best on earth. With a less burdensome b
taxation than our citizens have endured for six years
past, the entire public debt could be paid in ten years ;
but it is not desirable that the people should be taxed
to pay it in that time. Year by year our ability to pay T
Increases in rapid ratio, but the burdef of the interest b
ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be without viola- tl
tion of contract. The public debt is represented in tl
great part by bonds, having from five to twenty, and
rom ten to forty years to run, bearing interest at the
rates of six and five per cent respectively-it is optional
whether the Goverument pay these bonds at any per °
cent after the expiratien ot the least time mentioned
upon their face. The time has already expired when a tt
great part may be taken up, and rapidly approaching E
when all may be. It is believed that all which are now y
due may be replaced by bonds bearing a rate of interest 01
not exceeding four and a half per cent, and as rapidly as
the remainder become due, they may be reduced in the ti
same way. To accomplish this it may be necessary to ec
authorise the interest to be paid, at either three at
or four of the money centres of Europe, or by any bl
Assistant Treasurer of the United States, at the option b,
of the holder of the bond. I suggest this subject for di
the consideration of Congress, and also simualtaneous- ai
ly with this, the propriety of redeeming our currency pe
as before suggested, at its market value at the time the
law went into effect, increasing the rate at which cur- se
rency will be bought and sold from day to day or week et
to week at same rate of interest as the Government th
pays upon its bonds. ca
The subject of tariff and internal tax will necessarily at
receive your attention. The revenues of the country U
are greater than the requirements, and may with safety of
be reduced, but as the funding of the debt in four or
fonr and a half per cent loan would reduce our annual UI
current expenses largely, thus after funding, jnstifling gi
a greater reduction of taxation than would be now ex
pedient. I suggest the postponment of this question lei
until the next meeting of Congress. It may be advisa- sit
ble to modify the tax and tariff in instances where un- fre
just and burdensome discriminations are made by the ml
present law, but a general revision of the laws regulat. Ut
ing this subject I recommend postponement for the SU
present. by
)r I also suggest the renewal of the tax on incomes,
a. but at a reduced rate-say three per cent., and this tax
e- to expire in three years. With the funding of the na
tional debt, as here suggested, I feel sale in saying that
taxes and revenue from imposts may be reduced safely
from sixty to eighty millions per annum at once, and
at may be still further reduced from year to year as the
s resources of the country are developed. The reports
of the Secretary of the Treasury show the receipts of
the government for the fiscal year ending June 30,
it 1869, to be $870,948,747, and the expenditures, includ
is ing the interest bonds, to be $82,149 597. The esti
mates for the ensuing year are more favorable to the
it government and will no doubt show a much larger de
crease of the public debt. The receipts of the Treas
ury beyond expenditures have exceeded the amount
n necessary to place to the credit of a sinking fund, as
d provided by law. To lock up the surplus in the treas
ury and withhold it from circulation, would lead to
such a contraction of currency as to cripple trade and
d seriously affect the prosperity of the nation. Under
d these circumstances the Secretary of the Treasury and
myself heartily concurred in the propriety of using all
s the surplus currency in the Treasury in the purchase
of government bonds, thus reducing the interest-bear
ing indebtedness of the country, and of submitting to
if Congress the question of the disposition to be made of
the bonds so purchased. The bonds now held by the
Treasury amount to $75,000,000, including those be
longing to the Sinking Fund. I recommend that the
whole be placed to the credit of the Sinking Fund.
Your attention is respectfully invited to the recom
mendations of the Secretary of the Treasury for the
creation of an office of commission of custom revenues,
for an increase of salaries of certain classes of officials
and the substitution of increased national bank circu
lation' to replace outstanding three per cent, certifi
cates, and more especially to the recommendation for
the repeal of laws allowing shares of fines, penalties,
I forfeitures, Ac., to officers of the government, or to in
formers. The office of Commissioner of Internal Rev
enues is one of the most arduous and responsible un
der the government. It falls little short of a Cabinet
position in its importance and responsibilities. I would
ask for it therefore such legislation as in your judge
ment will place the officer upon a footingof dignity
commensurate with its importance, and ith a arac
ter and qualification of class of men required to fill it
properly.
As the United States is the freest of all nations, so
too its people symipathize with all peoplestrugglingfor
liberty and self-government; but while so sympathiz
ing it js due to our honor that we should abstain from
enforcing our views upon unwilling nations, and from I
taking an interested part without invitation in quarrels I
between different nations, or between governments and 1
their subjects. Our course should be in conformity
with strict justice, international and local law. fBch I
has been the policy of the administration in dealing i
with these questions. For more than a year a valuable
province of Spain, and a near iinehbor of ours, in
whom all our people feel an initderest been straug
gling for indepandecee and freedom. The people and L
government of the United States entertain warm feel- 2
sag and sympathies for the people of Spain. But the o
oontestat no time has assumed a condition whiic p
amounts to war in the sense of internationai law, or
which woiuld show the ekistenee of ade hcto political a
gnisiation or insurrecsati saient to jusify area- of

cord rights of belligerency, either to a people strug
glini to free themselves from a government they be
hieve to be oppressive, or to independent nations at
war with each other. The United States have no dis
position to interfere with the existing relations of Spain
to her colonial possessions on this continent. They
believe that in due time Spain and other European
powers will find it to their advantage in terminating
these relations, and establishing their prJsent depen
dencies as independent powers. These dependencies
are not regarded as subject to transfer from one Euro
pean power to another. When their relation of col
onies ceases, they are to become independent powers,
exercising the right of choice and self-control in de
termining their future condition and relation with other
powers. The United States, in order to put a stop to
bloodshed in Cuba, and in the interest of a neighbor
ing people, proposed her good offices to bring the ex
isting contest to a close. The offer not being accepted
by Spain on a basis which we believed could be re
I ceived by Cuba, was withdrawn. It is hoped the good
offices tendered may yet prove advantageous for the
settlement of this strife. Meanwhile, a number of il
legal expeditions against Cuba have been broken up,
The administration has tried to execute the neutrality
laws, no matter how unpleasant the task. On the 26th
r of March last, the United States schooner Lizzie May
was arrested on the high seas by a Spanish frigate and
two passengers carried off prisoners to Cuba. These
facts were made known to the Spanish government as
official information reached Washington. Thepassen
gers were liberated, and the Spanish government as
sured us that the Captain of the frigate, in making the
capture, acted without law; that he had been repre
manded and that their authorities in Cuba would not
sanction any act that could restrain rights, or treat dis
respectfully the sovereignty of this nation.
The seizure of the brig Mary Lowell, at Bahama, by
the Spanish authorities, is now the subject of corres
pondence between this government, Spain and Eng
and. The Captain-General of Cuba. last May, issued
a proclamation authorizing the search of vessels on the
high seas. Immediate remonstrance was made against
this, and the Captain-General issued a new proclama
tion, limiting the search to vessels of the United States
authorized under the treaty of 1795. This was also
withdrawn.
I have always felt that the most intimate relations
should be cultivated between our government and the
independent nations on this continent. It is worth
considering whether new treaties between the United
States end them may not be profitably entered into, to
secure more intimate relations, friendly, commercial
and otherwise.
An inter-oceanic canal to connect the Atlantic and
Pacific, through the Isthmus of Darien, is one which
commerce is greatly interested in. Our Minister to
Columbia has been instructed to endeavor to obtain 1
authority for a survey to determine the practicability
of the undertaking. To comply with the agreement, I
our government is to appoint a mixed commission at
Lima, abd for the adjustment of claims it became
necessary to send a commissioner and secretary also. I
The good offices of the United States to bring about I
peace between Spain and the SouthAmerican Republics
having been accepted by Spain, Peru and Chili, a I
congress has been invited to be held in Washington I
during the present winter. A grant has been given to i
Europeans of an exclusive right of transit over the
territory of Nicaragua, to which Costa Rica has con
sented, and which, it is alleged, conflicts with the rights
of citizens of the United States. The Department of t
State has now this subject under consideration. t
The Minister from Peru having made representa- t
tions that there was a state of war between Peru and
Spain, and that Spain was constructing in New York t
thirty gunboats, which might be used by Spain toen- o
able the naval force at Cuba to operate against Peru, 1
orders were given to prevent their departure. No fur- fi
ther steps have been taken by the Peruvian Minister a
to prevent their departure. And not feeling author. d
ised to detain the property of a nation with which we g
are at peace on mere executive order, the matter was te
referred to the courts. ti
. The war between the allies and the Republic of Par
ie aguay made intercourse with that countrydiflfcult, and
i our representation was withdrawn.
ch Towards the close of the last administration a con
ite vention was signed at London for the settlement of the
. outstanding claims between Great Britain and the
n United States, which failed to receive the advice and
ly. consent of the Senate. The time and circumstances at
ud tending the negotiation of that treaty were not favor
ed able to its acceptance by the people of the United
. States, and its provisions were inadequate for the set
rutlement. Grave wrongs sustained by this government,
P. injuries resulting to us by reason of the course adopted
d by Great Britain during the war; increase of insur
of ance, diminution of exports and imports, and other re
4, strictions to domestic industry, could not be adjusted
s and satisfied as ordinary commercial claims which con
tinually arise with commercial nations. Yet the Con
'd vention treated them simply as such ordinary claims
n from which they differ more widely in the gravity of
d their character than in their magnitude. Great, even,
as is the difference, not a word was found is the treaty
ad nd not an inference could be drawn from it to remove
the sense of unfriendliness of the course of Great
y- Britain in our struggle for existence, which has so
st deeply and universally impressed itself upon the peo
e ple of this country. Believing that a Convention thus
m misconceived its course and inadequate in its provis
ions, would not have produced the hearty and cordial
settlement of the pending questions *hich alone is con- I
d sistent with the relations which I desire to have firmly i
established between the Uuited States and England.
I regard the action of the Senate in rejecting the
i treaty to have been wisely taken in the interest of
peace and as a necessary step in the direction of a per
fect and cordial friendship between the two countries.
A sensitive people, censorious oftheirpower, are more f
at ease under a great wrong, wholly mentioned, than
under the restraint which satisfies neither their ideas
ofjustice, nor their grave sense of the grieveance they
have sustained. The rejection of the treaty was fol
lowed by a state of public feeling, both sides of which i
Ithought not favorable to an immediate attempt to re
new negociations. Iaccordingly instructed the Min
ister of the United States to Great Britain, and found t
that my views in this regard were shared by her Majes- e
tys' Ministers. I hope that the time may soon arrive 0
when the two Governments can approach the solution ti
of this momentous question with an appreciation that is t
due to the rights, duty and honor of each, and with 0
the determination, not only to remove the causes of t
complaint in the past, but !to lay a foundation on aa
broad principleofpublic law, which will prevent future
differences, and tend to a firm and continued peace
and friendship. This is now the only grave question "
which the United States has with any foreign nations. ti
The question of renewingthe treaty for reciprocal trade ri
between the United States and British nrovinces on
this continent, favorably considered in confiormity with a
the recommendation of Congress.
A proposition to abolish mixed courts for the sup
pression of the slave trade, is under negociation. It
having come to my knowledge that a corporate compa- P
ny, organised under British laws, proposed to land a
upon the shores of the United States, and to operate C
there a submarine cable under a concession from the ti
Empire of the French an exclusive right for twenty di
years of telegraphic communication between the shores P
of France and the United States, with the very objec- to
tionable feature of subjecting all meassages conveyed ci
thereby to the scrutiny and control of the French gov- tr
ernment, I caused the French and British Legations
at Washington to be made acquainted with the proba- ti
ble policy of Congress on this subject, as foreshadowed it
by a bill which passed the Senate in March last. This to
drew trom the representatives of the company an ni
agreement to accept as a basis of their operations, the m
provisions of the bill, and such other enactments on a
this subject as might be passed during the approximate
session of Congress. Also to use their influence to se
cure from the French government a modification of in
their concession, so as to permit the landing of any d
cable belonging to any company, incorporated by the fo
authority of the United States or any State in the of
Union, and on their part notto oppose any negociation a
of any such cable. In consideration of this agreement wi
I instructed the withdrawal of all opposition of the
United States to the landing until the meeting of Con. -a
gress. I regret to say there has been no modification I'
made in the company a concession, nor, so far as I can mi
learn, have they attempted to secure one. The conces- co
sion excludes capital and citizens of the United States Pa
from competition upon the shores of France. I recom- ste
mend legislation to protect the rights of citizens of the
United Stater and the sovereignty of the nation against
such an assumption. I shall also endeavor to secure
by negociation the abandonment of the principles of
monopolies in Ocean telegraphic cables.
The unsettled political condition of other countries
sometimes induces their citizens to come to the United
t States for the purpose of becoming naturalised. Hav
Sing secured this boon, return to their country and re
side there without disclosing their change of allegiance.
They accept official positions of trust or honor, which
can only be held by citizens of their native lands. They
f journey under passports describing them as such citi
zens, and it is only when civil discord, after perhaps
years of quiet, threatens their persons or their property,
or when their native State drafts them into its military
service, that their change of allegiance is made known.
They reside permanently from the United States, con
tribute nothing to its revenues, avoid duties of cititen
t ship, and only make themselves known by a claim of
t protection. I have directed the diplomatic and consu
Iar officer to scrutinise carefully all such claims of pro
tection. Our manufactories are increasing with won
derful rapidity under the encouragement which they
now receive. With the improvements in machinery
I already effected and still increasing, causing machinery
I to take the place of skilled labor to a large extent, our
s imports of many articles must fall off largely within a
few years. Fortunately too, manufactories are not con
fined to a few localities as formerly, and it is to be hoped
I will become moreand more diffuse, making the interest
in them equal in all sections. They give employment
and support to hundreds and thousands of people at
home, and retain the means which otherwise would be
shipped abroad.
The extension of railroads in Europe and the east, is
bringing into competition with our agricultural pro.
ducts, hke products of other countries. Self interest
and self preservation, therefore, dictate caution against
disturbance of any industrial interest of the country.
It teaches us also the necessity of looking to other
maskets for the sale of our surplus.
Our old neighbors south of us and China and Japan
should receive our special attention. It will be the en

with all nations, as to entitle us to their confidence
and make it to their interest as well as to ours, to es
tablish better commercial relations. Through the
agency of a more enlightened policy than that here
tofore pursued towards China, largely due to the saga
city and effort of one of our distinguished citizens,
the world is about to largely increase her commerce with
that populus and hitherto uncommunicative nation.
As the United States have been the pioneer's in this
new policy, so they should be the most earnest in I
showing their good faith in making it a success. In t
this connection I advise such legislation as will forever 4
preclude the enslavement of Chinese ispom our soil;
under the name of coolies and also prevent American.
vessels from engaging in the transportation of cooliesI
to any country tolerating the system. I ilso recomr
mend that the mission to China be raised to one of the

I fitted for it they should be induced to take their lands
severally and to set up territorial governments for
their own protection. For full details on this subject
I call your special attention to the report of the Secre
tary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian
I Affairs.
The attention of Congress is called to the recommen.
dation of the General of the Army, that appropriations
be made for the forts at Boston, Portland, New York
Philadelphia, New Orleans and San Francisco. I call
special attention to the recommendation of the Chief
of Ordnance, for the sale of arsenals andlands no longer
of use to the Government. Also to the recommendation
of the Secretary of War, that the act prohibiting pro
motions in the staff corps of the army be repealed;
that the extent of country to be garisened and the num
ber of military posts to be occupied is the same with a
reduced army as with a large one, but he number of
staff officers required is more dependent upon the lat
ter than the former condition.
The report ofthe Secretary of the Navy, accompany.
ing this, shows the condition of the navy when this
administration came into office and the changes made
since. Strenuous efforts have been made, as many
vessels are in commission, to render them fit for ser
vice, if required, as soon as possible, and to substitute
sail for steam while cruising, thus materially reducing
the expenses of the navv and adding greatly to its effi
ciency. Looking to our future, I recommend a liberal
though not an extraordinary policy toward this branch
of the public service.
The report of the Postmaster General furnishes a
clear and comprehensive exhibit of the operations of
thepostal service and of the financial condition of the
Postoffice Department. The ordinary postal revenues
for the year ending the 30th of June, 1869, amounted
to $16,444,510 and the expenditures to $2,313,981 31.
Your attention is respectfully called to the recommen.
dations made by the Postmaster General for authority
'to change the rate of compensation to the main truno'..
tines for their services in carrying the-mai1 "Zir.h
ing post-route maps executed; for reorganisingand in
creasing the efficiency of the special agent service; for
the increase of the mail service on the Pacific, and for
establishing mail service, under the flag of tho.'nion,
on the Atlantic. Most especially do I call yo .atten
tlion to his recommendation for the total abolition of
the franking privilege. This is an abuse from which
no one receives a commensurate advantage. It reduces
the receipts of the postal service from 25 to 30 per cent.
and largely increases the service force.
During theyear ending the 30th of September, 1869,
the Patent Office issued 18,762 patents and its receipts
were $686,389, being $213,926 more than the expendi
tures. I would respectfully call your attention to the
recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior for
uniting the duties ofsupervisingthe education offreed
men with the other duties devolving upon the Commis
sioner of Education.
Swhich must be taken during the year 1870, more com
pa- plete and perfect than heretofore, I would suggestearly
ndaction upon any plan that may be agreed upon. As
ateCongress at the last session appointed a committee to
the ke into consideration such measures as might be
ty deemed proper in reference to the census, and to re

ec to your favorable consideration the claims of the Agri
red cultural Bureau for liberal appropriations. In a coun

the benefits that can be conferred by preporly fostering

a number of the most important officers of the Govern

of MADE His FonRTNE LATE IN LIFE.-It is said that
the late Mr. Peabody accumulated the greater portion

is now selling in England at from 45 to 51 cents p
pound. Wax candles are used extensively in the roy
of palaces of Europe, and in one palace alone it is stat
a. that ten thousand wax candles are burned every night
- The method- lighting this large number of candies
. instantaneouJ, is to connect the wicks by an inflam.

it required a banking capital of $200,000,000 to remov

the South "is not much over $10,000,000." H
. immense the disparity ! No wonder that cotton a

t South, this year footing up an aggregate of $400,000.
000, are subject to such influences as "rings" in Wall
street exercise over them--keeping prices down by
withholding the means to transport them to market.
The South must have more banking capital. If the
national bank system will not furnish it, she must seek
it abroad and at home from capitalists who only want
to know that such investments will be safe and profit.

Southern States becomes a fixed fact, we need not ex
