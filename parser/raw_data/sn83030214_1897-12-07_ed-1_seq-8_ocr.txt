THE HOLIDAY MAGAZINES.
THEIR NEW PLACE IN CURRENT LITERA?
TURE-HOW THEY HAVE CONQUERED
IT-THE PASSINO OF THE
OBVIOUS.
Or the outside, to begin with, they are better
than they ever were before. In fact, the maga?
zine cover nowaday? Is labored over aa If It were
a leather binding, to go permanently Into "every
gentleman's library," ar.d at Christmas time th?
artists do their rattiest. A few of '?!?
monthly periodicals. It is true. cling to their
familiar dress. "The Cosmopolitan" Is the Sams
In December as in June. "The Pall Mair
changeth not with the months. "The Atlantic"
Is as sedate as ever But "Harper's" has a new
design <>n Its front this month, ar.d a very
artistic one it le. too. drawn by Mr. Kenyon Cox.
The cover of "McClures" 1* embellished with a
itracvful figure, rendered by Mr. Klnton. In
nlag pale tints, and "Scribner's" carries off
the blue ribbon ?Uh a cover by Mr. Maxfleld
ParrlOB, which Is a little gem of quaint hum or,
quainter d.-slgn and quite IrresistiMe color. Yet
when we have enumerated all this bravery of
exiernat aspect and turn to the good things
?vith.n. we notice first that the latter are. even
more than the covers. admlrabK without refer?
ence to their apposlteness to the month. These
covers, full of the spirit of Christmas, are at
the same time well enough made, as we have
hinted, to be preserved on library ehelves. The
contents of the magazines wear largely a festal
air. but they have virtues Independent of the ,
season.
This Is. in fact, the most refreshing clreum- ;
stance to be noted In our holiday periodicals.
They are no longer the gaudy magazines that ?
were familiar a decade ago. when every editor :
seemed bound to fling holly berries on every
other page of the periodical under his charge.
They contain Christmas stories, but they con- ?
tain much else. Take "Harper's," for example,
the veteran of the lot. Bave for the cover, the .
December number might have been prepared ?
for any other month of the year. The reader |
who puts it aside now ..nd takes It up again
In May will find that It has not grown stale.
Mr. Davis will be as Interesting then as he Is
now In describing the Incidents of the Queen's
Jubilee. Mr. Owen Wister. delighting the reader
of his "Destiny at Drybone," ae the latter takes
it fresh from the press, will provide an equal
delight next summer. The profoundly Interest?
ing paper on George William Curtis at Concord, j
by Mr. Cooke. has a biographical significance
that will last. We doubt if the long poem by
General Lew Wallace. "The Wooing of Mal
katoon." will wear well. It is not edifying, it
le not musical or charming, now. But we have
eald enough to show that this number has been
made with an eye for intrinsic value; there Is
nothing adventitious about It. and we must
add that in so producing the periodical the Edi?
tor pays a compliment to his public He knows
that In its Innermost heart that public does not
relish being treated like a child. It wants a
Christmas number to be good, because it wants
a good magazine at all times of the year. Ac?
cordingly, we have a number that makes a suffi?
cient concession to the season in Its cover, and
then proceeds to Interest people In the usual
legitimate fashion. "Harper's" le typical of Its
contemporaries. They are all free from that
note of puerile straining after effect which used
to spoil the magazines with every anniversary
of a festal eort.
The reader who notices, however, that the
Christmas magazines are particularly rich on
the pictorial side may be reminded that this Is
osi** a seeming. The plain truth is that the art
departments of the great illustrated magazines
do uncommon work all the year round. "The
<"< r.tury" Is brilliant with its group of engrav?
ings by Timothy Cole after the paintings of
Thomas Gainsborough, but that group la, after
in, part of a series. The long article In this
number of "The Century" by Mr. Rlls, on "Merry
Christinas In the Tenements," has a sociological
? value impressive at any time. This article, by
the* way, haa some capital Illustrations by Mr.
Jay Hambidge. He is accurate and picturesque,
a companionable realist, like Mr. Riis himself,
who is always serious, but never too serious to
be readable. This number of "The Century"
contains some good biographical Matter, chiefly
relating to Edwin Booth and Tennyson, but It
has some good fiction also, notably the horse
stories by David Gray, a writer not hitherto
familiar to the publia Fiction, of course, 1b al?
ways to the front, and in this bundle of holiday
magazines there le ?nough of it to last a reader
for a week. We have noted Mr. Wister and Mr.
Gray. "McClure's" and "The Pall Mall" both
rejoice In the opening chapters of "Rupert of
Hentzau." Anthony Hope's sequel to his "Pris?
oner of Zenda," and both magazines, not content
with this entertaining fragment, surround It
with short stories. "McClure's" gives double
measure, the number opening with a new tale
of Indian life by Mr. Kipling, in which a young
Englishman figures picturesquely. "The Tomb
of His Ancestore" Is \ curious tale. In some ways
one of the oddest Mr. Kipling haa written. He,
It may be noted In passing. Is very much In evi?
dence at this time, contributing to "Scribner's"
and to "St. Nicholas" as well as to "McClure's."
We have already touched upon these various
performances of his. and may pass to other mat?
tere. In "Scribner's" there la a great deal else.
Mr. Monkhouse's paper on Sir Edward J. Poyn
ter gives a full and sympathetic account of an
important If not a brilliant figure in English
art. Mr. Taylor's poem, "The Posing of
Vlvette," is not of much consequence, but we
are grateful to it for having provided an excuse
for the Illustrations by Mr. Wenze.ll. These are
fascinating designs, and thi y have not only been
engraved with brilliancy by Florian, the French
engraver, but the printing of them. In tints, has
been accomplished with extraordinary effect.
This is an episode for the magazine to be proud
of. "A Guilty Conscience." one of a consider?
able group of good short ?tories, Is also some?
thing that calls for congratulations. The fort?
unes of Mrs. Buckingham's boarders?and piss
In thle tale, are calculated to make the realer
chuckle as long as memory holds. "The Coen* .
politan" has been printed In numbers better than
the December one It has some fairly Interest?
ing contributions, but nothing remarkable. "Th??
Bookman" provokes the same observation.
thtiugh as regards Its cover It makes an excel?
lent appearance.
"The Atlantic Monthly" brings up the end of
the proceneion with the same unobtrusive cover
It has always had, and Innocent of pictorial
adornment except for a photographer's adver?
tisement that serves aa a frontispiece |g really
rich in articles of a strictly literary significance.
Mr. Paul Leicester Ford, writing about "The
American Historical Novel ; Mr. Tunlson, mak?
ing surmises about "The Coming Literary !<?
vivai"; Dr. Blrkbeck Hill, setting forth hitherto
unpublished letters of Dean Swift, and Mr
Hlgglnson. discoursing of literary London as he
knew it twenty years ago, are all making for
pure culture. Save for the two serial stories
running in the magazine ;hore is not a pane
that does not concern Itself with more or WSH
bookish theme?. Looking back from these essays
to all tho other magazines which have beaa
touched upon In this brief survey, we are im?
pressed with the link of literary seriousness
that binds them all together. "The Atlantic" is
the only one that Is devoted to letters, pure and
simple. But look at the paper on Curtis In
"Harper's," at the essay on Poynter In "Scrib?
ner's." at the Tennyson, Booth and Gainsbor?
ough articles in "The Century." How Illustra?
tive they are of a taste that may be nourished
largoly on Action, but that Is Indubitably aware
at? other things, too The holiday magazine ia
doubtless an ephemeral thing. All thing? con

ELECTRICIANS TO CONFER.
THE CONTRACTORS AND THE WORKERS
UKSLT TO ADJUST TIIE SCALE AND
AVOID A RRIKB.
The Impending strike of the electrical workers
for an Increase of wages from $J to f> for a da**
: of eight hours ?a?? probably not take pini???, n? a
eonference baa been practically arranged between
; the contractors ani the workers wliicli. It i.
thought, will result In a prompt nnd satisfactory Bet?
' tlement of the d-.spuie.
The first d?:naml for the higher scale was made
fourteen months ago by the Hrotherliood of Elec?
trical Werken No. ? (K. of L?.. No. MBS). ar.d It
was subsequently a?,re? j :o insist on tu?. Inereaas on
Januar-- ?. IMS, ? nd notice to thai effect was served
upon the Electrical Contractors' Association.
When the demand ?\as reiterated recently (he em?
ployers showed no disposition to grant the Increase
and refuse?! to confer wiih the Conference Commit?
tee of the Brotherhood, on the ?round thai it con?
tained men who were not In their employ. To this
the workers replied that their men were not all em?
ployed by the contractors who hi longed :o the SS- !
soclatlan. that they were not employed continuously |
hy tiie same firms, and that It wa? practically Im?
possible to appoint a committee of their employee, ??
the men might be working for Independent con?
tractors when the lime ?.amo for the confluence.
There was a deadlock over this question of con- ?
ference, and It seemed that a strike was Inevitable,
and that It would Involve not only the one thousand
two hundred e> -trlcal workers who are member.?
of the Brotherhood, but over ten thousand workmen
In the Building Trades. This contingency brought
the matter before the Executive Committee of th??
Vnlted Building Trades, of which the Electrical Con?
tractors? Association forms a part, and that com?
mittee has practically arranged for a conference
with the workers.
Oeorge O. J'.nnev. chairman of the Conference
Committee and delegate of the Brotherhood of Elec?
trical Workers, said yesterday that there were some
details still to be arranged, but that euch s confer?
ence wouid be held, and that It looked as If there
would be a satisfactory settlement within a few
days. He Is confidi nt that the SI scale Will be ac?
cepted by the contractors. On the other hand, some
concessions of Importance may be male by tho work?
ers. Mr. Jenney said yesterday:
The pre.?e?n scale has been In force for seven or
eight ve.irs, without say changa ex e;>t that on
May ii, 1K?5, the hours of latmr were reduced t?
eight, the wages remaining si H s ? ? ?'?'? feel
that we ought to receive st least as much a?*, if not
more than is paid io other workers In the bul
trades, because considerable : ; ' ?? ??'? '?? ? Ige la
required of electrical workers, and the.? i;ave to
lit themselves for their work by ?1'? tarent study. The
steamiltters and plumber? receive $:> ?.? a ?lay, car?
penters, S3 f-o: stonecutters, masons ai.d brick
from ?4 to IS. The Brotherhood has .? boai I ol
expert electricians, which examine? every man ?>
applies for a union CSJ i. and so thorough Is this tes)
that the card Is accepted by employers as u cer?
tificate thai the man is qualified for w.irk In the
line specified on the card. v. he;Ik r It be fixture,
bei; ?G dynamo work, or sonerei wiring. There Is
h.ich activity in the trade that every electrical work?
er In the district Is employed, and some firms have
advertised for men to enable them ? ? carry out their
(ontracts. To meet this need the Examining Board
held an examination ?..' nesrly one hundred men

A contractor who Is not a member of the organiza?
tion said:
The workers do not want a strike, as every com?
petent eic-ctrical worker In the ?iistrirt I? now regu?
larly employed, ani a ?trlk?? would btlr.g ?n non?
union men from other cities. They would ur- ?
doubtedly win. but when the strike ende?l the rlty ,
would have twice as ??.??>? electrical workers as ll
could employ. The workers would have the support
of the rn.-r, in the building trades, ant they ?p? wi :
I nlsed, while only abc ? twi nty-flve of the Isrger ,
contractors ar- members of the Electrical Contrae
Association. There a;?? n? irlj ? l
firms in the business In New-Tork, many of wtio-n !
would pay the Increased s? ale ano go on with their '
work, and so there would not be anything like a
general lockout.
OftVers of the Contractors' Asso dation confirmed

THIS It<)Y WANTED A NICKEL.
"Tlsset. Mister, can you give m?i a nickel for
rive pennies?"
The Inquiry came from a spruce, well dre??..?.!
little schoolboy, ?ho with a .ipanloa wae wuik
mg up Six;???inth-Bt toward Broadway yesterday
morning The boys ?vere about ten years old.
They carried their s< hoolbooks. and were evidently
the children of nrell-to-do parents
Surprised si ti?? request, and wondering why a
nickel should be of more value to any one ?han
Uve separate pennies, eepe?dally to s scii.i..ii,,.y,
the person au.iiessed stopped ami aaked why the
coin was required. The ??newer was surprising.
"We want to ko uptown on ti.?? Broadway car,"
e.tlrt the boy, "anil wk heure only on?: nl? k?-l ,.i..|
these pennl
"Well, afe not the pennies good enough?" wan
esked.
"No, Th?:v wo;.': t.?;,. them on the cara," was
the r?-ply. "We gavs the conductor pennies yeeter
?].? . .un? lie said that ie hml a good mind to make

but If ne ever caught us irylng to give him cop- :

Ami, perhaps, we might hnve the same conductor

Jl'STIi-E DTstMAM GIVES A DECISION OF INTER?
EST TO OtMJMTBY PAPERS
Justice, rykmnn, of he Supreme Court, has
granted a writ of certlorarl In behalf of Richard
; P. Barnes against the aise.?ors of the town of
Kew-Cestle, In Westehester County. At the same
? time ihe Judge decided e question of Interest to
? newspaper men.
The geseseora Bled their roll several months ego
and proceeded, ar. they supposed, to give legal no?
tice of their action bv posting notices on trees,
lusts, barn d.-K.rs and other places, without regard
for the newspapers.
Mr. Barnes appeared before the Board on griev?
ance day and asked to have the $10,???0 persona,
property aeatlernen! aga.nst htm removed from
tho books. He made no ohj-ctlon as to his real
tate, snd went away, taking it for granted that
?, . personal assessment would be cancelled.
Consequently, he ?lid not pay any attention to
the no icee which were posted, and not until a
friend told I.irr. that he must pay taxes on $10.??)
, ? r ?? il ? r< p? rty did his temper change, lie then
BO -i.: i I il advice.
when th?? case came up. Mr. Barnes took the
ground that the assessors had noi corr.n?ed with
the law In properly publishing their notlcee. Th?
?ora r< ; iied that, as "Th?? ('happaqua Item,"
thi ol ? paper published In the town, wae printed
In New-York ?'.".?. thev were noi required to pub?
lish notice. The Justice de?-lded that, although
the paper was prln'e.i pn New-York, it was first
it for clr nation In Chsppscius, and there?
for?? it w..- ?'-per for legal advertisements to be
printed ther. :ti. ;w:d grai.te.l the writ of certlorarl
The !.-.irlt;g on the writ Is set for December 1*.
