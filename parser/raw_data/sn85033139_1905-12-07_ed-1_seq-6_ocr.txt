Both Houses of Congress Hear
Reading.
FIRM ON RATE LAW.
Corporations, Panama Canal end Many
Other Important Topics Are Thor
oughly Discussed.
♦
WASHINGTON, 1 >. C , I >ec, Pres
ident Roosevelt’s message was read to
Congress today. It is in substance us
follows:
The Nation.
The people of this country continue to
enjoy great prosperity. I mloiibtedly
there will be ebb and How.
Something can be done by legislation
to help the general prosperity on a pol
ler which shall insure to the advantage
of all people w ho act decently.
If the lass fortunate matt is moved j
to envy to strike at the conditions under ,
which they both live, the result will he j
that while damage may come to th> me
struck at, it will visit with nu even bc.iv
icr load the one who strikes the blow.
Taken as a whole we must all go up and
down together.
Corporations.
The corporation lias come to stay just ns
tho labor union bus conic to slay. Kach
should be favored us long ns it does good.
Experience has shown that it is use
less to try to get an adequate regulation
and supervision ol great corporations by
stale action, I believe that it can be ob
tained by the'enactment of law by the
Congress. If necessary the constitution
must he amended.
ft ban been a misfortune that national
laws on this subns t. have been of a pro
hibitive rather than an nllirmafive kind.
The successful prosecution of one device
to evade the law immediately develops
another devise. What is needed is not
sweeping prohibition but supervision mid
regulation.
<lf these abuses perhaps the chief is
overcapitalization.
Railway Rates Law.
It must include putting a complete
stop our rebates. The power should be
alllrnialive and ►honld be given to some
administrative body created by the Con
gress. The most important provision is
conferring on some administrative body
the power to decide whether a rate is
just • * • if unjust, to prescribe tie*
reasonable maximum rate, this to go Into
effect within n reasonable time, subject
to review by tie courts. A rebated rate
should he mad< the maximum on all
similar transportation. My proposal is
Hot to give the commission power to in
itiatc or originate rules, hut to regulate.
The I test possible regulation would be an
agreement among the railroads to carry
out the law. “ * • If would put a stop
to discriminations A system of exam
ination for railroad accounts similar to
that now conducted in national bulks
should l‘ pro- i led. I’resent laws have
been greatly destroyed by delay In the
courts. The question of transportation
lies at the root of all industrial success.
We must understand that the public
servants who are to do this work must
he of the highest type. They must be
well paid.
Safely Appliances.
The Congress should provide for the
Introduction of block signals on all rail
roads engaged in interstate commerce.
If tin re are any reasons for laws limit
Ing the hoars of labor they certainly np
ply to railroad workers with peculiar
force.
An employees’ liability law applicable
to all industries within the scope of the
federal government should be enacted.
Labor.

Army and Navy.
I do not believe there is any army in
the world that lias a better average than
, nrs • • * but previous should b*
made for maneuvers. The number of
iiostH in tliiH* *>f should
ished. Fmim tion by mere seniority cun
never result ic a thorough l ! efficient
corps. There should f>e niT increase in
the const artillery force, and increase and
reorganization in tin* medical department.
Our navy must always be of greater
size than our army. It does not seem to
me that the navy should he increased
js-yond the prcs.-nt number of units, but
cheieut should be substituted for in
efficient units. .
JTohably the r-sult would he obtained
by adding a single battleship each year.
Naturalization Laws.
\o a,ieu is to be naturalised until at
least ninety days after tiling his petition.
Criminal Laws.
The delays of the criminal low, no less
than of-the civil, now amount to a very
great evil, legislation should be enacted
to cover breach of trust in lb<‘ shape of
prematurely divulging secrets by an em
ploye or officer of the Lulled States. A
statute should tie provided for punish
ment of a United Slates attorney or oth
er officer who corruptly agrees to do
wrong, other than for money.
Public Land.
T he iniquitous method of monopolizing
public lands are becoming more generally
known, but existing laws do not furnish
effective remedies. U'e cannot afford to
substitute tenants for freeholders on pub
lic domain. All organized opposition to
the forest reserves of the west lias dis
nppen red
Merchant Marine.
If cannot but be a source of regret mid
uneasiness to ns that the lines of com
munication with our sister republics of
South America should be chiefly under
foreign control • • through the lib
eral aid bestowed by other governments
on their own steam lines.
Pensions.
That Congress take act inti toward care
for the graves of Confederate dead. The
first need is to take charge of the graves
of Confederate dead who died in the
northern prisons.
Immigration.
We should have none of llie wrong
sort We need more immigration for the
south. No emigrants should he allowed
to come from Canada nnd Mexico, tin
natives of the two countries themselves.
Keep immigrants away from the con
gested tenement house districts of tho
great cities..
In the effort to carry out the policy of
excluding Chinese laborers grave wrong
has been done to the people of China.
Chine e students, business and profes
sional men should he encouraged to
come. We cannot expect to receive
equity (from China) unless we do equity.
Civil Service.
Written competitive examinations do
not make the ideal method, but they rep
resent an iminensurenhly advance upon
the "spoils” system.
Copyright Laws.
Our copyright laws urgently need r
vision.
Adulteration of Foods.
Interstate traffic In foodstuffs which
have hern debased or adulterated so aa
to injure health or deceive purchasers
should he forbidden.
National Parks.
The grand canon of Colorado should
In- made into a national park. Nothing
should lie allowed to interfere with the
preservation of Niagara Falls. The
boundaries of Yellowstone park should
Is- extended to include forest preserve*
on the south.
Lifesaving Service. *
Give members of the service pensions
such as arc given to tin-men ami police
men in all onr great cities.
Indians.

cone laws to prosecute "liootleggera."

The Philippines.
If (here has Leen error as regards giv
ing self-government to the Philippines It
has Leen it 100 quickly. I earnestly rec
ommend that tin tariff now imposed
upon tin* products of tin* Philippines be
entirely removed except on sugar and to
liacco, that these lie reduced 25 per cent,

thid it will he many years before the
products of these islands will have any

BERLIN, l)c. s.—The Ost ITeus

“Upon information gained from Russian

the Russian Bailie provinces.”
WASHINGTON, l>. C., Dec. o. —A
resolution expressing sympathy for the

(ive (ioldfogle (New Vorki was read in
the House today. It requests the ITesi
deut to use his good olliees with the Rus
siun government l” prevent atrocities in
the future. The resolution was referred
to the committee on foreign affairs.
WARSAW. Dee. s.—The executive
committee of the railroad employes’
union has telegraphed to all stations of
the Russian railroads urging the men
to begin a general strike at midnight
unless the sentences of death passed by
the court martial at Samara on Sokoloft,
an engineer, and on other local leaders
of the recent railroad strike at Samara,
are reversed before that hour.
Agrarians in Big Revolt.

Many wealthy i fugee families from

Poland Is Now Free.
WARSAW. Dec. s.—The abolition of
the minor state of martial law was ga
zetted today and Poland is now com
pletely freed from military rule.
The authorities have prohibited a pro
poses! meeting of the striking post and
telegraph employes. The disorganiza
tion of business can be judged by the
fact that while before the strike the
Warsaw office handled 22.m5) telegrams
daily, the office now handles only 150 U.
Court Martial for Mutineers.
Advices from Sebastopol say that the
government has ordered the mutineers
to be tried hy court martial in accord
ance with the procedure in use in war
lime. Information from Moscow says
that a committee of the bourse is trying
to arrange a settlement of the telegraph
strike.
Czar Ready to Flee?
ST. I'ETKKSIM RE, via Eydtkulmen.,
Hast Prussia, Do . 5. It was reported
from fronstadt today that a German
squadron has been sighted in the Uallicj
seat near the Russian roast. Utinior nt-i
tribnted the appearance of the squadron,
as preparatory to the llight of the Kus-I
sian imperial family.
The city remained quiet, but extreme!
tension prevailed. The telegraph and
postal tieup remained complete. Soldiers'
and employes of other departments went
being used to deliver portions of the vast
accumulation of mail.
Defiance from Telegraphers.
The telegraph operators met yester
day’s threat to discharge them unless
they returned to work by resolving to
prosecute the strike until their demands
are satisfied.
The League of Leagues, which is issu
ing decrees like a veritable provisional
government, openly defied the prefect’s
warnings to walking delegates and agi
tators that any attempts to persuade em
ployes to leave their work would lead to
their arrest and the imposition of a fine
of .$2OO, and issued a counter proclama
tion warning not only the Russian but
the Danish operators to work at their
peril.
Dc Witte’s Last Card.
fount I >c Witte seemed convinced that
the Emperor. by acceding to the demand
for universal suffrage, it.ay still find a
common ground on which the govern
incut and the moderates and the extreme
elements can stand. If this failed to
stay the headlong march of events, the
proclamation of a ready made constitu
tion might hi' tried as the last card.
Then nothing would remain except tin
proclamation of a dictatorship.
Mutineers Fire Prison.
VERONESE, via Eydtknhnen, Dee.
—The local military prison in the suburb
of I‘ridatseha was set afire by the im
prisoned mutineers. A row of shops ad
joining the prison was also burned. The
mutineers then marched to the civil pris

prisoners. They were stopped by troops.
The firemen were hindered in their el'
forts to extinguish the fire by the prison
ers, who tired volleys from the windows.
