Speauso of the Thanksgiving Sermons
preached in New York, on Thursday last,
the World says: "They will amply repay
pern sal. Most of them contain allusions
to the present disturbed condition of po
litical affairs, and may be held to, in a
measure, represent the sentiments of the
Christian community. Every one must
rejoice at the conciliatory tone which per
vades them. Even the divines most con
spicaons for their uncompromising hos
tility to slavery have wisely abstained
from any expression calculated to deepen
the animosity between different sections of
the country. The clergy have set a wise
and beneficent example of conciliation
which can hardly fail to be productive
of a soothing influence upon the time.
Thx election of Mr. Jefferson as Presi
dent in the year 1800, frightened many
- very worthy people. A correspondent of
the Xational Intelligencer, who remembers
the excitement sixty years ago, says it was
then contended that Mr. Jefferson's elec
tion would dissolve the Union; our coun
try would bo overrun with paupers and
criminals from other countries; our reli
gion would be destroyed, our churches
closed and Bibles burnt. None of these
- occurred. Tht writer adds?"Mr; Jcffer
son proved to be one of our most popular
Presidents, the rights of each State pro
tected, no churches closed and no Bibles
tfarnt. Such, I dare believe, will be the
course of Mr. Lincoln; and if I do not
greatly err in my judgement, he will prove
to be one of the safest and best Presidents
we ever had."
Comobess meetB to-day, but there will
not, we presume, be anything of import
ance done beyond the appointment of a
committee to inform the President ot their
readiness to proceed with the public busi
ness. The President's Message, it is ex
pected, will be sent in to-morrow, and,
provided there is no unusual delay, will
reach us Wednesday forenoon. Kuowing
as we do, the great anxiety there is among
all classes to read the message, we will
spread it before our patrons as soon after
its reception as possible.

From Wuhtogton.
Washington, Thursday, Nov. 29.
Quite a large number of Western mem
bers of Congress eamc in, this evening,
and are already busily discussing the
prospects ahead. They all declare for
pacification, whatever may be the sacri
fice.
Tho tone of sentiment in Virginia has
ovidentl? taken another turn. In Mr.
Gnrnett's District, as well as several oth
ers, conservative resolutions have been
passed almost unanimously, and the ob
ect of those urging Gov. Letcher to fix an
early day for the assembling of the Legis
lature, was to have an expression ot con
servative sentiments before tbe meeting of
the South Carolina Convention. Gov.
Letcher refused, saying' '-Let South Caro
lina go?she will be no loss to tho Union."
After all the talk about members refus
ing.to take seats, it is understood that the
Soutli Carolina delegation will present
themselves, at least long enough to pocket
their back pay and mileage, provided
there bo any money in tbe Treasury with
wliich to pay them, which is now exceed
ingly doubtful.
Official information just received from
Utah represents the Saints in high glee
over the prospects of disunion and Mor
mon independence. BriglTam Young <!laims

of thiugs j that the Lord would overthrow

P'e. ^ t

[From the Richjnond Whig.]

closely engaged'for several days in ascer

ty points arising from -informalities in the
election returns. - The Governor- hns not

importance.
- "The" planter -desired to purchase^an ad
ditional "supply-"'of negroes - to pick bis
present .crop of cotton, but feai*d-to do so
on account of the gr/eat depreciation in
their value and the alarming excitement
which pervaded the Soatb. In order to
ascertain from bis own lips Mr. Lincoln's
policy, be visited him at bis residence in
Springfield. Mr. Lincoln inforined him
that he was opposed to any interference
with -slavery in the States, or with the
inter-State slave trade; that he was "op
posed to abolishing or interfering with ]
slavery in the District of Columbia; and :
that he was only opposed to its extension
in the Territories, but added "that was
only an opinion of his/' He was then
asked what would be do in the event
that Sonth "Carolina sccejled from the
Union? He replied that he would let her'
go if Congress did not pass a "force bill."
He stated that if no one would accept
office in that State, of conrse, they, could
receive no benefit from the Government,
and the whole expense for the distribution
of the mails would devolve on her own
citizens. He concluded by advising the
Mississippian to purchase rs many "negroes
as be needed; and expressed the opinion
that, in twelve months, slave property
wonld be worth more than it ever had been.
Upon these assurances the gentleman
was, on Satarday, making bis way to Vir
ginia to purchase more negroes. He says
that Lincoln is a man of profound acquire
ments, and that he doubts not will make
as good if not better President than Mr.
Buchanan has done.?Chattanooga Gazette.
Lord. Palmeriton on the Prince's
Visit.
At a public banquet in London, Lord .
Palmcrston thus alluded to the reception
of the Prince of Wales.iu America :* ?
"You have alluded to an event which
has awakened the deepest interest in the
mind of every Englishman. I mean the
visit of the Prince of Wales to the North
American Continent. It was to be ex
pected that when the future hope of Eng
land visited the subjects of Her Majesty in
our North American Provinces he would
be received with that enthusiastic affection
which becomes a loyal and attached peo
ple. Our anticipations have not been dis
appointed. The reception of the Prince
has been worthy of the people who gave
it, and honorable to the family of which
be is so distinguished a member; and we
may hope that that visit may cement more
closely those tics which, I trust, are long
destined to bind together that portion of
the Queen's dominions and the ? mother
country. [Hear, hear.] But Jre bad not
an equal right to expect that when his
Royal Highness visited the Uuited States
he would be received with anything more
than the courtesy which civilized nations
accord to distinguished members of the
reigning family of another country. But
I must say it has been most gratifying to
wituess the cordiality, the heartfelt kind
ness, the generous hospitality, and 1 may
say, the enthusiastic delight, with which
that illustrious Prince was welcomed by
our cousins in the United States. [Cheers.]
They have shown themselvas, indeed, to
be a noblo and gcuerous' people?they have
shown that thsy have not forgotten the
common stock from which they and we
have sprung; and, in spile of events which
if not buried in oblivion, might have pro
duced some slight alienation between us,
they received our future Sovereign?and
I trust that future may be long distant?
they received the eldest son of our gracious
Sovereign, not as if he were a stranger
belonging to another land, but as if be
had been born in their own country, and .
had been a citizen of their own Republic.
[Cheers.] I trust, gentlemen, that the
remembrance of the generous kiudness
thus exhibited br the people of the United
Slates will ever be cherished by the peo
ple of these kingdoms. I believe the
memory of the Prince's visit will long sur
vive in the breasts of the American na
tion, and that these mutual recollections
will tend more closely than ever to knit
together those two great branches of the
same noble and, I will say, illnstrious
stock. [Cheers.]
