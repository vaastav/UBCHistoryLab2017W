THE LEXINGTON INTJWLLIQiCNCEE, SATIFEDAY, DECEMBER S, 1883.
OFFICIAL COUNTY PAPER.
Carlisle ts all right.
"Rebel yell!" Stuff and nonsense.
Well, we are happy I Carlisle and
Clark.
The Intelligencer gives, in a supple
ment, to-day, the president's message,
in fall.
Fort Worth Gazette: "The bloody
shirt has become a signal of republican
distress. "
To the New York Sun : Take your
medicine like a good little boy. Don't
make any ugly faces.
The trial of Frank James for the
Blue Cut train robbery, will likelv
take place early in January.
'ihe only metropolitan newspaper
that keeps on its staff a negro reporter
is the New Yerk World, and it
democratic.
The Chicago Times wants to know
why any one should waut to shoot
Mr. Arthur, as "he hasn't been presi
dent any more than he could help."
Globe-Democrat : "The drift just
now Is toward Arthur, with Edmunds
as an alternative." Another case ot
the cart being in advance of the horse.
Post-Dispatch: "Republican oppo
sition to Carlisle will by materially
quieted by the reflection that when the
republicans had the choice of a speaker
they chose Keifer."
We print on the outside, to-day, Mr.
Henri Watterson's Cooper Institute
speech, in fall. We have not seen it in
any other Missouri newspaper. It has
the right ring about it.
The Intelligencer seems to be on top
all around this week Carlisle, Clark,
and the city nog ordinance. There is
nothing like a newspaper being sure it
is right and then driving ahead.
A German girl arrived in St. Louis
a few days ago to meet her affianced,
who left her in Westphalia three
months ago. She found him in jail
on a charge of having murdered his
partner in a saloon.
Farmers' Institute at Higginsville,
Tuesday and Wednesday, December
18 and 19. All farmers, their wives,
daughters and friends, should read the
fuller notice elsewhere under the title
of "Fanners' Meeting."
The- President has appointed Sur
geon Robert Murray, chief medical
officer at Qen. Hancock's headquarters,
to be surgeon general of the army, vice
Gen. Chas. H. Crane, deceased.
Another diabolical rebel outrage.
The new county judge fulfills his
duties with dignity and intelligence.
We are inclined to think that Mr.
Thomas K. Skinker will find him as
tough a customer as have the young
ladies of Lexington for the last ah I
for the past several years.
Judge Denny being a leading Ken
tucky republican is not censored by
the republican press very severely for
killing his man. It is always self-defense
when a republican kills somebody.
It seems that the command, "Thou
Shalt not kill," was written for dem
ocrats only.
The twenty-sixth annual meeting of
the Missouri State Horticultural Socie
ty will be held at Carthage, Jasper
county, Mo., December, 11th, 12th and
18th,1884,upon invitation of the Jasper
county Horticultural society. Dele
gates are earnestly desired from every
county and every horticultural society
in the state.
Washington Post: "The first 'rebel
yell' of the session Was heard at the
democratic caucus Saturday night,
when Gen. Slocum moved, and the
caucus unanimously resolved, that the
crippled and disabled Union soldiers on
the roll of the doorkeeper be retained.
The 'solid south' is getting its work
in promptly."
In a duel at Nyiregyhaza, Hungary,
on Monday, between Herr Hauptman,
one of the defending counsel in the
recent trial of Jews charged with
murdering a girl for ritual purposes,
and Herr Vay, police commissioner,
whom the former accused of torturing
Jewish ; prisoners, Herr Vay was
severely wounded.
As the county judges do not pay us a
cent for publishing the proceedings of
ineir court, and persist in economizing
in county printing from the $2,000 to
$4,000 per year that it used to cost,
down to about $500 per year now, we
have concluded to recoup, hence the
omission of the periods from the coun
ty court proceedings this week.
A correspondent in another column
suggests a means of retiring Mr.
Skinker from his position as reporter
of the supreme court, i. e., to make his
office elective. We have not given the
matter serious thought, but there are
forty counties in this state that are in
terested in his removal, and they may
be heard on the question in pretty plain
language before it is finally disposed of.
The glow which is seen in the west
about and just after sunset, and in
the morning before sunrise, is said
by scientists to be caused, either
be meteoric nebulae, or by the
fact that the world is passing
through the tail of a comet. Common
people can read the speculations and
take their choice. The effect is very
pretty sometimes, whatever the cause.
The organization ef the house of rep
resentatives was effected, Monday,
quietly, decently and in order. Mr.
Carlisle's speech on taking the chair
was a model of moderation and wis
dom. We should have given it this
week, but prefer to wait until we can
have the time to show that it was in
thorough accord with his past senti
ments. we have contended that he
never was an extremist, and we desire
10 prove this conclusively. Wc hope
he will appoint Morrison to ways and
means; liandall to appropriations;
Holman to public lands; Cox to for
eign affairs; Hurd to judiciary, and
Reagan to postoffices. If he does, he
will have the .ablest and strongest or
ganization ot the house that has been
effected since the war, and it will
mean genuine reform in every depart
ment of the government.
SPEAKER QAELISLE-
John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, was
nominated for speaker of the lower
house of congress, by the democratic
caucus, last Saturday night, on the first
ballot. The vote when officially an
nounced 6tood, Carlisle, 107; Randall,
45 ; Cox, 36. The Kentucky members
voted solidly for Carlisle ; the Pennsyl
vania members solidly for Randall ; 13
of the New York delegation voted for
Cox, and 7 for Randall. Of the New
Yorkers several of those who voted for
Cox would have voted for Carlisle
had there been a contest for the
place. Of the Missouri delegation, 1
was absent, Mr. Clardy, who is sick;
11 voted for Carlisle; and two, Messrs.
Burnes, of St. Joseph, and Graves, of
Lexington, voted for Mr. Cox.
We need not say what profound sat
isfaction the election of Mr. Carlisle
gives us. We have as best we could
for over a year been telling our readers
from week to week, the important is
sues which were involved in the selec
tion of a democratic speaker. The
battle was that of the people against the
monopolists. Thirteen months ago the
Intelligencer pointed out Mr. Carlisle
as the man lor the place. It is un
necessary now to tell our readers who
ha is. We have done that long ago
We may reiterate that he is a statesman
more than a politician ; a student of
political economy rather than of the
arts commonly used to further the suc
cess of a political aspirant. His election
means a purer political atmosphere.
A thorough parliamentarian; cool,
brave, honest; the Keifers and the
Kassons cannot bully him, and the
lobby cannot influence him. His rec
ord as a man and as a politician is with'
out a blemish.
The Intelligencer wanted to see him
speaker particularly because he repre
sents a great political principle. His elec
tion means that the democratic party is
true to itself ;that it is honest ; that it has
broken loose from the time-servers
and trimmers, and intends to defend
what it believes to be right. That
alone is worth thousands of votes to it.
Senator Logan was right when he said
he was for Randall, because his election
would divide the democratic party on
the tariff, while the election of Carlisle
would solidify it. The result will more
than fulfill his idea, for the vote which
Carlisle received means that the party
does not intend to be trifled with by the
men who are only half-heartedly in its
ranks. For every one such lost by an
honest, manly course, there will spring
up five recruits.
We regret exceedingly that in such a
crisis the congressman from this district
made a mistake. His inspiration was
not drawn from his constituents, for
they were overwhelmingly for Mr.
Carlisle. We knew this before, but it
has been unmistakably demonstrated
this week in the enthusiasm with which
they have received the news of his
election. Mr. Cox had no sunDort
worthy of the name in this congress
ional district or even in the state.
The vote for speaker was the
most important one to be cast this ses
sion. As we view it, it decided the
fate of the democratic party. There"
are occasions when the legislator know
ing that he is right and that his people
are wrong because of erroneous infor
mation, he should vote according to his
conviction and not theirs, but in this
case the people knew as much of the is
sues as did the politicians. Their
wishes, therefore, should have been
carried out. We should be doing Mr.
Graves but poor service were we to con
ceal from him that these are the views
and feelings of a large majority of his
democratic friends at heme. We re
gret that this untoward event should
have opened his congressional career.
We earnestly desire to see him succeed,
and we trust, as is often the case, that
a bad beginning will only presage a
good ending. With this hope we shall
always fairly lay his acts as a congress
man before the people of the district.
What is known as the "Flying Dutch
man," running from London to Bristol,
is the train which travels more rapidly
than any other in the world. It com
pletes a distance of 118$ miles, making
no stops in two hours, making an aver
age of 59 1-8 miles an hour. A train
which ruus between Paddington and
Swindon, England, takes second place.
The distance is 67 1-4 miles, and the
time 1 hour and 27 minutes, and stops
none, and the average speed 53 1-4
miles. Germany is also progressive in
this matter. On the railroad between
Berlin and Hanover, a train is run
which makes 152 1-2 miles in 3 hours
and 48 minutes,keeping up an average of
ver 51 miles an hour. The train from
London to Peterborough comes next
covering 74 1-4 miles in 1 hour and 29
minutes. This is on an average of 51
1-2 miles. Canada is ahead of the
United States as far as expeditious rail-
road transportation is concerned,
train on the Canada Atlantic, from Ce-
teau to Ottowa, making 78 4-10 miles
in 1 hour and 34 minutes, or 50 milet
an heur, including three stops. The
Pennsylvania Railroad runs the fastest
train in this country, between Jeraav
City and Philadelphia, a distance of 90
miles. It make one stop, and reaches
its destination m 1 hour and 52 minutes.
The average per honr is 48 3-10 miles.
The New York Advertiser is a verv
staunch republican newspaper, and one
oi the ablest in the country. It is au.
thority for the following : "A gentle
man who met ex-Secretarv Bristow in
New York a few days ago and con
versed with him about Justice Harlan's
course, says he smiled very knowingly
wnen ne saia: 'l suppose the man who
opposed the constitutional amendments
knows more about them than the per
sons who advocated them. Judge
Harlan's opinion is very singular, in
view of the fact that he made speeches
in Kentucky against the adoption of the
amendments at the time they were un
der consideration, but his course now
can be accounted for in many ways."
How ? We can see but one. Pure
demagogism.
We thoroughly agree with our
friend of the Herald that Lexington
business men should use their influence
with the county court to have the
roads made good. So far as they can
we believe they do this, but for the
last two years Providence has been
againit them. When the Master
sends us floods they will carry nt
bridges and tear up dirt roads faster
than ordinary resources can mend
them.
THAT PBEOIOPS HOG LAW AGAIN
. W. writes to us, this week, from
Dover:
"I know yon must be tired of the hog ques
tion, but let us hear from you onoe more. The
bogs are mil running at large an though there
wai no law for restraining ttwm. It is oonttnd
ed by some that nothing can be done to enforce
the law in any particular instance, until some
actual damage is done. Can that be true? If so,
how ia it with the man whose hogs are on the
highway when they are infeoted with a conta
gious disease 1 It may be of advantage to some
to know the truth."
Beside this, a learned doctor ot di
vinity has called to ascertain when the
hog law went into effect. The wife of
our besom, with whom we have lived
sixteen years without a quarrel, has
told us very emphatically that six little
pigs got into the front yard and rooted
her blue grass all to pieces, and that
she is in favor of the hog law, iu town
and in the country ; and' a half dozen
farmers have asked us to print the law.
So, we suppose, there is nothing else
for it. We should not object in the
least, but for the fact that we have
printed it iu full twice since it was
adopted, in January, 1883. However,
our paper is always at the service of
the people, so here goes.
Se it enacted by the General litMemtly
ike Slate ef Missouri, as fallows:
Skcuon 1. It shall be unlawful ler the own.
er of any animal or animals, of the species of
horse, mule, ass, cattle, awine, sheep or goats.
In this state, to permit the same to run at large
outside the inclosure ol the owner of such stock.
and if any of the species of domestic animals
aforesaid be found running at large outside the
inclosure ol the owner, it shall be lawful for
any person to restrain the same forthwith, and
such person shall, within three days, give notice
thereof to the owner, if known, in writing.
stating therein the amount of compensation for
feeding and keeping such animal or animals.
and damages claimed, and thereupon the owner
shall pay the person taking up such animal or
animals, a reasonable compensation for the
taking up, keeping and feeding such animal or
animals, and shall also pay all persons damaged
by reason of such animals running at large, the
actual damages sustained by him or them. If the
owner of such stock be not known, or if notified
and fails to make compensation for the taking
up, feeding and keeping ol animals taken up
under the provisions of this act, the same shall be
deemed lobe strays. and shall be dealt with in the
same manner as required by law with respect to
taking up such property as strays under the
stray law.
sue. 2. if the owner of suck stock so re
strained and the taker up, or the person dama.
ged by such stock and the owner thereof, cannot
agree upon the same, either party may apply to
any justice of the peace of the township where
said taker ap resides for the appointment of
three appraisers to assess the damages done, or
reasonable compensation tor the taking upjkeep-
ing and feeding such stock, and it shall be the
duty of the justice of the peace to issue a notice
to three disinterested householders of the town
ship to appear at such place in said township as
he may designate, and assess the damages or
compensation as herein required.
Sac. 3. Ihe persons so notiiled, or any two
oi them attending, shall take an oath that tbey
will fairly and impartially assess the damages
or compensation in controversy, and' tbey shall
make out, sign and deliver to each party, a
written statement of their assessment of dama
ges or compensation, and upon the payment of
the same and the expenses of said controversy.
the owner ol such stock shall be entitled to take
the same away, and li refused, he may main
tain an action therefor, aa in case of wrongful
taking or detention of property .
Sac. 4. Tbe justice ot the peace shall be al
lowed a fee of liny cents for issuing the notice
and swearing the appraisers, aiid the constable
or persons serving the notice shall be allowed a
fee ol thirty-five cents for each appraiser noti
fied and tbree cents per mile as mileage to and
from the place of service, and each appraiser
shall he allowed a fee of lllty oeitts, whiob shall
be paid by the owner of such stock before he
shall be eutitled to take such stock away; pro
vided, that if said appraisers uaai ss the amount
of damages and compensation for taking np,
keeping and teediug said animal or animals, at
a less amouut than the amount claimed by the
taker up on the written statement delivered to
the owner, it shall be tbe duty of the taker up of
sold animals to pay said coats.
Sao. S. It shall not be necessary for any per
son to fence against any oi Ihe species of domes
tic auiinuls enumerated in this chapter, and it
shall b no defense to any action or proceeding
nrougnt or Had, mat the party taking up such
stock did not have his lands inclosed with a
lawful fence, but nothing herein contained shall
be connrued to lessen or Interfere with the ob
ligations of tbe several railroads in this state to
fence the right of way of such railroads, as ia
now provided by law.
Sec. 6. Nothing contained in this chapter
shall be construed as to prevent owners or other
persons from driving any of the species of ani
mals enumerated in this chapter from one place
to another, or along any public highway, the
owner or owners being responsible lor all dam
ages that any person or persons may sustain iu
consequence ol the driving of such stock .
Sbc. 7. The provisions of this chanter are
hereby buapended in tbe several coantiea in this
state, until a majority of the legal voters oi anv
county voting at any general or special election
cauea for that purpose, shall decide to enforce
me same in such county; provided, that .miv
majority ot the legal voters voting on said ques-
uuu enau oe necessary to decide its adoption or
rejection.
The other sections relate to the man
ner of holding the election. In this
county the election was held on Satur
day, November 8. The voters decided
in favor of restraining swine from run
ning at large, ana the law went into
effect from and after Saturday .Novem
ber 10, when it was officially promul
gated by the legal publication made by
tne couuty clerk. It is now, therefore,
aua nas oeen, since Saturday, Noveui
ber 10, 1883, in Lafayette county, state
of Missouri, unlawful for swine to run
at large iu the public highways or any-
wnere outside oi enclosures belongin
to their owners. If swine are found
running at large it is lawful for any
person whatsoever to restrain such
swine, forthwith, without auy sort of
ceremony, as may be seen by sections
1. 2, 3 and 4, of the law. Now,friends
and brethren, please cut this out and
paste it up alongside of the clock, and
don't ask us to print the same law four
times in one year. However, you'll
have to hurry pretty well to do that, as
Anno Domini 1883 is in its last gasp.
Gov. Glick, of Kansas, sent the fol
lowing telegram of congratulation to
Mr. Carlisle: "Permit me on behalf
of myself and the democracy of Kan-
nan to congratulate you upon your
magnincent triumph, and hope that
your success as speaker of the house of
representatives will be as grand as
your nomination, triumphant and
significant as it is. A triumph of de
mocracy ewer the corporations and
monopolies of this country. It shows
to the world that the democratic parly
is free from the domination of the
corporations, and your election will
bring to the party thousands of votes
that hitherto have baen
through a want of knowledge of the
true principles of our party. I must
again congratulate you upon your
magnificent triumph."
Judge Juo. A. Lockhart desires his
friends and neighbors to know that he
is once more at his post in his shon at
Wellington, where he may always be
found in business hours, and where if
his muscles hold out and he ia reasona
bly well patronized, he proposes to try
i maKe up somewhat tor the time he
has lost under Mr. Skinker's man
dates. We hope all his old enstnrnnro
will return to him, and that lie will
make many new ones, which he ouo-i,t
to do, as his neglect of his business for
the past year was in the service of the
people of the county.
"SPEAKEB CARLISLE "
Crow Little Rooster Crow !
FIRST BALLOT.
John G. Carlisle, ...107.
Samuel J. Randall, 45.
Samuel S. Cox, 36.
Carlisle's majority over both, 26.
The New York Herald says of the
election of Mr. Carlisle: "It is one
of the cherished traditions of Mr.
Tildeu's friends that the sage of Grey-
stone said on an occasion, 'There will
never be a democratic victory until
there is a democratic party.' If Mr.
Tildeu said this he spoke a very true
word, and the choice of Mr. Carlisle to
be speaker of the house, by the demo
cratic caucus on Saturday night, ought
to rejoice the venerable philosopher's
heart. The accession of Air. Carlisle
will make a very great change in the
politics of the country. The political
trimmers who have so long ruled the
democratic party, and dragged it from
one defeat to another, have at last been
overthrown. For the first time in
many years no, for the second time
the party stands for something of its; !
own, for reform of abuses, and for the
rights of the people against monopo
lists of all kinds. We say for the sect
ond time, because in 1876 the demo.
crats stood also for wholesome anil
necessary reforms, and in that, year, as
almost everybody now freely admits ,
they carried the election."
We do not pretend at this distance ,
or with the light we have, to decidbe
the merits of the controversy betweeiu
the Concordia Post and Messrs. Coojk
and Duling, but so far as what has
been printed is concerned it looks this
way: The Post accused the inavor and
Mr. Duling in a certain case of having
collected illegal fees. Those srentle-
men by affidavit prove that, jio such
case as the one spoken of by tiiePost
was tried, and, otherwise, that they
nave tne right to collect certain fees.
To this the Post replies that the editor
knocked Mr. Duhng down. Mr. Du
ling says he knocked down the Post ; so
here honors are easy; but the Post
does not answer the allegations made
by Messrs. Cook and Duling as to the
alleged case and their rights as to fees,
As a mere spectator of the dispute we
pause to see it do so.
ihe election of Hon. John B. Clark
to be clerk of the lower house of con
gress is a compliment to a consistently
democratic state, and elevates a wor
thy gentleman to an honorable and res
ponsime position. His competitor.
Mr. Atkins, of Tennessee, was also a
deserving gentleman. Both were ex-
congressmen of long service and ex
perience. General Clark received, 95
votes ; Mr. Atkins, 92.

A HEW SUGGESTION REGARDING
MS- SKINKER-
E oitob Intelligencer: In your last issue
you show, I think, to the satisfaction of any
impartial miuu, that our state supreme court
has treated our people unfairly by not giving
tnem a hearing m regard to the remevul of Thos.
H. bkinker, their official reporter. We have the
best reasons to ask bis removal, which it is not
necessary to discuss at this writing, but it does
seem to me, Mr. Editor, that the oBce of su.
preme court reporter should be elective, as it is
salaried office, paid by the people of the state.
we ought to have tbe right to elect our state
officers.
Let us ask the next democratic convention to
pass a resolution to that effect; and the legisla
ture to so amend the law. The people of this
state win never elect tbe present reporter
and in this way will rid themselves of an ob
noxious man.

Katie was for some years a pupil of theE.
Aull Sen: luary, and while here was a favorite
of the entire school. Sbc was teaching at Creen

which settled upon ber lungs and resulted in
quick consumption. During ber long sickness
she was remarkably patient, and, when sbc
recognized tbe fact that she was incurably dis
eased, did not shrink from the inevitable result,
hut calmly awaited tbe coming of the messenger
who was to carry her home. Death had lost for
ber its venomed sting, and was
"But the voice which Jesus sends
To call her to His arms."
She was not only willing but desirous to de
part and join her mother, wbo bad preceded her
to tbe home above Just five weeks before.
Katie was one of the loveliest characters we
have ever known. Beautilul in face and ttVuie,

METHOD OP SHIPPING 0AEP FROM
FOREST PARK.
St. Louis, Dec. 1, 18S3.
Editou Kepubmcan For the informa
tion of all concerned, and especially iu reply
to the insinuation of favoritism, made by your
Brownsville, Saline county, correspondent,
H. H. Bradford, in the Republican of Novem
ber 27, against the lish commissioners in the
distribution of young carp, I give the follow
ing facts as to our method of shipment.
The last legislature gave us but one-half
the appropriation asked for and urgently
needed for the propagation of young lish, and
no appropriation for rebuilding our aquarium
car, burned up last January. Hence we have
no funds for transportation purposes and are
compelled to rely solely upon the express
companies and the charitable generosity of
the railroad companies. We have arranged
with the Pacific Express Company to receive
the cans of young tish at the ponds in Forest
Park and deliver them to the various express
companies in the city, at a cost or 20 cents per
can, tbe distance hauled being about four
miles. Here the water is changed and the
cans sent promptly to destination by morning
or evening trains as best suited to prompt de
livery, the consignee having been notified by
mail one week iu advance of shipment to be
ready to receive his fish. The fish are sup
plied free of charge to the applicant, but he
is required to pay the cost of the can, hauling
from the park and express charges. a"h
can holds five gallons of water aud weighs
about fifty pounds when shipped. The ex
press companies very properly request our
shipping agents not to ship more than teu
cans at the same time by any one train, as
more would encumber the express car and
interfere with prompt delivery at stations.
Under this limitation we can only ship about
forty cans a day as a maximum, and as our
employes are but few, this number is as many
as we can handle. In addition to the above
restrictions and difficulties we must be gov
erned by the conditions of tbe weather at the
time of shipment. Young carp must be kept
during transit below sixty degrees of Fahren
heit, forty is still better. If these conditions
cannot be secured on any given day selected
for shipping, this shipment must be abandon
ed and another day set.
Up to date (Dee. 1, 18S3) we have shipped
584 cans from Forest Park, each containing
about thirty tish. From the St. Joe hatchery
about 100 cans. Those cans have been sent
to all parts of the state without favoritism,
our employes being guided solely by the safe
ty of the young fish and tbe rules of the ex
press companies. The notices to applicants
in Saline county have beeu out nearly one
week, aud they will receive their cans in due
time, unless some unforeseen accident oc
curs But only a few cans will reach one
county on the same day, as only ten can go
in one train.
We have on onr books about 500 more ap
plicants, and think we have fish enough to
supply them, but of this we cannot be sure
until the last pond is drained. After the 1st
of January it will not be safe to ship.as f reez.
ing of the water in the cans will destroy the
fish. We hope to close out all shipments be
fore that date. In consequence of warm,
sultry weather during November, we have
lost a considerable number of young carp
during transit on the railroads. The fish ar
riving dead, the consignees have refused to
receive .and pay for the can and express
charges, thus entailing a considerable and
unexpected expense upou our small fund, as
we must pay all charges thus refused. If
such parties who have thus lost their fish will
have the can returned to Forest Park, free of
cost to us, we will ship them another cau on
the same conditions as all other shipments, if
the supply of tish does not give out in the
meantime.
The supply of young carp at St. Joe is al
ready exhausted, and applicants from that
section must forward their applications to
Phil. Kopplin, Jr., Forest Park, St. Louis.
Mr. H. H. Bradford could have received the
above information direct from us, had he ad
dressed us instead of the Republican. Re
spectfully, I. G. W. Stkedman,
Chairman Missouri Fish Commission.
MR. 00SGR0VE.
From the Sedalia Democrat.
Speaking after tbe manner of meu "ws
point with pride", to tbe flntf vote delivered
by our new congressman from this district.
Mr. Cox is a member from Mr. Cosgrove's
native state.and on personal grounds it would
have been a real pleasure to have given him
at least a complimentary vote, but it was
business before pleasure with Mr. Cosgrove,
and he occupies a seat iu congress to repre
sent his constituents. We regret as muck
cannot be said of our neighbor of the Lex
ington district, who did vote for Mr. Cox. It
was not a time to be jeoparding important
interests by throwing away complimentary
votes on Mr. Cox. Mr. Cox had no following
in this state. Missouri was virtually unani
mous for Carlisle.
Johri Cosgrove is a practical, sensible man
and we guarantee he will not be called to an
swer for any foolishness while in congress.
We know him.
DADE COUNTY.
Greenfield, Mo.. November 28th, lss3,
Editor Intelligencer: Your lavor has just
been received and Zach's effusion noted. Zach
is correct in oue particular, be did ask us to
help bim write an article on Dade county, and
we did refuse, on the grounds that at that time
we had not been over the county, and we were
afraid we would fall into tbe very error in which
Zaeb has lallen, expose our ignorance. We
also refused for tbe reason that until we knew
we were in the position to write Ihe truth about
any subject we will not write at all. Our thnnks
are due acu lor the inlonuatlon that we have
not kit Greendeld since our arrival in the couu
ty, but we withhold thanks for tbe reason that
the statement is not true, .ask in hid letter
seems to have two objects in view; Drat to make
us auknonlfdge the superiority ot Lalayejte
over Dade county. Tiiat Lafayette Is not ouly
superior to Dade, but tbat she is second to no
county in the state, we cheerfully acknowl
edge. We have been all over the state and we
know whereof we speak, and in our travels we
went not with Zach's view, that of simply
hunting out tbe defect, hut of learning the re
sources aud advantages of the country as well.
Zucb's second object in writing tbe letter was
not to publish a true account of Dade county,
but siniwly lo get rid of a few unmerchantable
wares 111 the shape of stale auecdotes. Trace
every step that he took iu Dade county, and a
line twenty miles long will be ample for your
purpose. Still he pretends 10 know all about
the country, and says, with the imperious air of
a man who knows he has settled all controversy,
I never saw ajy blue grass anywhere the
county." When we consider that the part of
tbe county Zach saw is to the whole county as
one is to one million, thu, verily, we cau ap
preciate the value of bis statements. We can
also very readily conceive how it is possible for
one who assumes to bare seen so much in so
short a spacs, to shoulder the respoiiaihil ity ol
tergetting what he actually did eee.
In spile of Zach's misstatements the fact still
remains that Dade county raised a better crop
both of wheat and corn this year limit Lafayette,
(this we know seldom occurs) : that Dade can
beat auy northern county raising fruit auy year.
That she is far richer in mineral of anv kind
tbat Zach chooses to mention ilian Lafayette.
Tea, and from where I now sit, I can sera
thousand acres of liner blue grass lliau was ever
seen in Lafayette. Z ich you know livvs in the
river bottom, auu consequently la not expected
to know how blue grae. looks, lytriher yet.
nobody denies that one-llith, almost, ol our
conaty Is composed of rock ribbed hills,
but they are Worth their weight iu iron, lead
and zinc.
Now, out oi kiiiducs to friends, Zach, we
propose (alter tbe mineral is taken out) to make
bim a present of one of these awlul hills so thai
he may tet it iu his farm in the boitoin tor a
place of refuge for himeelf and family next
June, when the high waters on the one side.
aud the malaria on the other begin their annual
struggle for tho mastery of bis home.
