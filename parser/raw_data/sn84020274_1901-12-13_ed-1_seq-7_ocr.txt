BONNE CASE MAY GO
TO THE JURY TO-DAY,
Defense Hns Completed Its Argu
ment, and the Government
Concludes This Morning.
CHARGE MAY BE A LONG ONE.
Mr. Fulton, in His Speech for the
Accused Woman, Declared
the Prosecution Had Not
Proved Its Charges.
The Republic B3rao.
lllh St. and Pennrtanla Ae.
Washington. Dec 12. The Bonlne case
Is expected to go to the jury to-morrow
afternoon. The argument for the defense
closed to-day. Jlr. Fulton concluded his
address just before the noon recess. This
afternoon Mr. Douglass spoke, and upon
conclulon the court adjourned until to
morrow morning; when United States At
torney Gould will close the argument.
The Judge's charge to the Jury will fol
low. This may take up as much time a
the address of Mr. Gould, for it is believed
that the Judge will treat exhaustively of
the law and the evidence In the case. Then
the fate of Mrs. Eonlne will rest with the
jun-.
Eery rent was occupied this morning
when the trial was resumed. Mr. Pulton
of couel for the defense, resumed his ar
gument. He made an Impassioned appeal
Tor tho acquittal of his client, asserting
that on the night of the Ayres tragedy
she acted as any woman would whos-e "hon
or was menaced by an armed nun.
So Conpromlie Wanted.
The lawyers fcr the defense had de
clared themselves, when Mr. Fulton told
the Jury Mrs. Bcnlne was guilty of murder
or nothing. They disdained the idea of any
compromise on manslaughter.
Mr. Fulton went into a lengthy descrip
tion of Arres's life and bis study of medi
cine. He spoke of the great interest evinced
by Mrs. Uonine in the social functions at
the Kenmnre. particularly the weekly
dance, and of bow she endeavored to at
tract to them the young men at the hotel,
who came from other cltlen. Her desire.
Mr. Fulton said, was to prevent them from
wandering into paths of vice.
The speaker said that out of the !"
guests in the house who had known her
for two years, not one said a word against
ber. ,
"Ar.d the Government has had six months
to find out their opinion of her," contin
ued Mr. Fulton. "Have any of the 1
i!i.lnr1 Mr Rnnlne the eold-blooded mon
ster the prosecution would make" her? No:
Xo! Nor' repented Mr. Fulton at the top
of bis voice. "She it was who first re
sponded to a sick call in that hotel, was
It her duty? No! But she was Impelled by
the mercy which has filled her whole life.
Mrs. Bon Ice was a ministering angel.
Too Quirk to Condemn.
We are sometimes too quick to condemn
women who go to men'a rooms. We stand
them In tho market place, branded with a
scarlet letter. If my boy should go from
home and some woman take an interest In
him. would I charge her with a lustful pur
pose? Gcd forbid. When a man is suffering
this thing called discretion cuts no figure.
And those who accuse her of Impure mo
tives forget him who said, 'Be kind to
those who are suffering.'
"Do you remember the Master meeting
the outcast woman at the well? The rab
ble who saw the meeting would hav cru
'cised Christ for his sympathy and met
with his noble rebuke."
As to the reported quarrel between
Ayres and Mrs. Bonlne. Mr. Fulton said
the defendant had spoken twice to Ayres
about his drinking, and on the last oc
casion the deceased became offended.
"The Government takes advantage of. this
misunderstanding to say. Then the rela
tions between Mrs. Bonlne and Ayres were
broken.' said Mr. Fulton. 'Her rela
tions with Ayres did not differ from her
attitude toward any ouier man in me "
and the Government has not produced a
scintilla of proof to the contrary-

In a vote of thanks tendered the city of
East St. Louis and the Mayor for courte
sies, it was stated that the meeting was
the most successful ever held. More in
teresting papers and subjects were dis
cussed at this than at any previous con
vention, and the farmers and their wives
and daughters departed last night for their
homes feeling1 that they had either gained
or disseminated knowledge.
One of the features of the convention
was the condemnation, of the State authori
ties In placing on the Board of Agriculture
men who are not practical and everyday
farmers. It Is asserted that there Is a pre
ponderance of members who know abso
lutely nothing about the practical Bide of
farming on this board.

BEDS FOR PATIENTS
ARRANGED IN TIERS.
Crowded Condition of Contusion
Hospital at Belleville Caust-s
Huddling of the Sick.
Double tiers of beds, designed to accomo
date four patients each, are to be installed
in tho St. Clair County Contagion Hospital.
This decision was determined at a meeting
of the Committee on Public Properties of
the SL Clair County Board of Supervisors
held in Belleville yesterday morning, and
as a result physicians of the city "vho
learned the decision of the board are greatly
exercised.
The beds which are to be installed are
of iron anil are double width. The lower
berth will be eighteen inches from the
floor and there will be a space of two feet
nine inches between It and the upper berth.
Twelve of the double-deckers have been or
dered and will accommodate forty-eight pa
tients, runennjr witn contagious diseases.
The action of the Committer on Pubic
Properties yesterday morning was the result
of the rending of the East St. Louis cases
of smallpox to Belleville as the Board of
Supervisors at its last meeting had prac
tically turned down bills for necessaries fur
nished the East St. Louis pesthouse. Tnc
original scheme in the new contagion hos
pital provided room for only twele per
sons at a lime, ineive single cots had been
placed in position, but tnese will bo re
moved to another part of the County Farm.
ueuevuie physicians no not tninic well
of tho double-decker bed scheme. As a
rule they say that it Is the worst thing pos
sible for the patlnts. They say that tt will
be almost Impossible to so arrange the pa
tients without either great discomfort or
even serious Interference. Several of she
Belleville physicians are thinking of making
a protest before the Board of Suprvisors at
its next meeting.
FED IROX TO THRASHING 3IACIIItK.
Indictment Changes Farm Hand With
Wrecking; the Device for ilerenge.
Charles Lutzier, a farm laborer, living in
the vicinity of Ivjbanon. was found guilty
by a Jury in the Circuit Court to a charse
of malicious detraction of property yester
day. The charge was the result of an in
dictment of the last Gr.ind Jury. It was al
leged that Lutzler mixed Iron and steel nr
ticles in bundles of wheat that y.ere fed
to a thrashing machine. The machine was
almost ruined, and several of the farm
hands narrowly escaped serious injur-.
Lutzler had been employed by John Ken
nlngton of Lebanon Township, but was dis
charged. Pennington was called to thrasn
wheat for Joseph Kieder. At the same time
Lutzler disappeared. The thrashing machina
was working nicely when a sudden crunch
was heard, and a moment later with a
crack and several sharp explosions, the ma
chine was burst asunder. Portions of the
machine were sent flying in all directions
and several of the farm hands who were
standing near narrowly escaped serious in-
i ...
I JUI
An examination revealed the fact that
several large monkey-wrenches and heavy
pieces of iron and steel had been placed in
side the bundles of wheat. These articles
had wrecked the machine. Lutzier was sus
pected, but it was several weeks before he
was arrested and charged with the offense.
He was held to the Grand Jury, and that
body returned an Indictment against him.
He will be sentenced this morning.
PRESENCE OP MIXD SATED HIM.
Gas Boebel Gnfdrd His Runaway
Team lato Telephone Pole.
Gus Roebel, a West End butcher of Belle
ville, was driving his team of spirited
horses In the West End yesterday when the
horses became unmanageable and ran away.
Roebel's efforts to check the horses were
unavailing.
As a last resort he decided to run the
team against a telegraph pole and take
chances. With great difficulty Roebel suid-U
the team into the pole. At the same time
he jumped out of the wagon.
Roebel's action was correctly timed, as he
lost the) shock of the fall and the horses
were stopped quickly. Jumping up. he
grabbed the reins at the horses' heads and
soon quieted the animals. The wagon was
wrecked, but the horss were not hurt.
