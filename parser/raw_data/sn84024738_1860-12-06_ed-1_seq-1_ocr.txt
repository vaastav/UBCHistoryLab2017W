they should fall due. To have negotiated th.

Woald have remained In the vaults of the
treasury uncalled for. There wa- no power
la the department to cull m thetreisury not***
until :hey became due. Besides the with
drawal of aacb an amuunt of spe-ie from the
public would have been attended with -he
most injorioua efbeta upon the financial
op-rations of the country. For tht__e rea
sons, ao negotiation of auy portion of the
loaa was attempted until the Mh day of
September, 1866, when proposals were in
vited for ten millions ol the loan, which
was ample to meet all the treasury note_
tbat would full due before January l" l«C! —
The rate of intereat was fixed at five per
.eiituru per annum, under the conviction that
the loan could be readily negotiated at that
rata for at that time the" live per cent, stock
Of tiiel'iiited States was selling in the mar
ket at a premium of three per cent The re
sult realised mis expectation, and the
Wbole amount .HVred was taken either at par
- r a small premium. Before, however ihe
fimoliad arrived lor payment on the part of
the bidders, the financial cii..is, to which I
have already reterred, came. .Some of the Md*
■TBts promptly complied with their proposals,
and others were willing to do so, it required
by the Department, though it would beat a
considerable sacrifice. Under trieee circum
stances, an additional term ot thirty days waa
i-'iten to all bidders who would deposit one-
Ball ot the amount oi their bids within the
time originally prescribed. Most of the bid
ders availed tbemselvesol this extension, ami
made iheir deposits accordingly on or betore
the 22d -November, 1860. A portion, however,
failed io Co so, ami to them 'he addr.ion.ii
thirty days has Been offered, on condition th it
they would increase their forfeit deposit of
one percent, to five pc; cent To this propo
sition no response ha.- as yet bi-en received.—
The amount of tbe loan awarded to this last
class i,t bidder- is * I,<-l.y it'll.
The question presents Itself, what action
shall be taken in reference to the stuck which
may be thus forfeited ! There la no power in
ti.e department, aa Uu law now stands, to meet
the case, li is recommended that Congress
■beald immediately auiborize tbe department
to dispose of tins stock upon the best possible
terms, holding tbe defaulting bidden responsi
ble tor the difference between their bids and
the amount tor which the stock can now be ne
gotiated. The necessities of the Treasury de
mand prompt action on thissubject. Notonly
are the treasury notes past due rapidly coming
in for redemption, but, a* already stated, those
not due are bem-; paid 111 for customs, tbereby
withdrawing from tbe regular operation ot
the government its principal source ol re
venue.
T.» m.,1,1 !•._.. _~«..;..:„ , i:_ _ .
lo meet tneremaiuingoutstardiag treasury
note* and interest thereon there is vet to be ne
gotiated eleven millions of the stock author
ized by the acl of June ■_'■_•. 1860. The state
ment just made ot t.._ difficulties attending
the payment for the stock already sold, in
connection with the tact mat capitalists,
in the present condition of th. country,
seem unwilling to invest in United Slatea
stock at par, render* it almost certain that
tiiis remaining eleven millions cannot now
be negotiated upon terms acceptable to the
government. The condition of the Treasury
is such that no serious delay can be indulged.
I recommend, therefore, a repeal ot so much
of the act of June -ii, 1840, as authorizes the
leaning of this additional eleven millions ot
stock, and that authority ba given for the is-
BUiagof treasury notes to the same amount,
to be negotiated tit such rates as will command
the confidence of the country. To create that
confidence, 1 recommend that the public lands
be unconditionally pledged for the ultimate
redemption of all the treasury auies which it
may become necessary to issue. 1 make this
recommendation ofsubstitutiugtreasury notes
I i-i. ck, the more readily trom the con victien
that there should always exist in the depai t
tnent power to issue treasury notes for a lim
it-'il amount, under the direction of the Presi
dent, to meet uuforeseen contingencies. It is
a power which can never be abnsed, as the
amount realized from such source can only be
used to meet lawful demands upon ihe Treas
ury. No, Secretary ot the Treasury or Presi
dent would ever exercise i% except compelled
to do so by the exigencies of the public service.
On the other hand, it would enable the gov
ernment to meet, without embarrassment,
those sudden revulsiona to which the country
is always liable, and which cannot always be
anticipated.
1 have already stated that provision should
be made at once to relieve the treasury from
its present embarrassments, produced by the
caus-s referred to. To do this. Congress should
authorize the issuing of an additional amount
Ol treasury notes, not less than ten millions of
dollars. With these meai-s ihe department
Will be enabled to meet all lawful demands
upon it for the- present- The extent of the ,
financial crisis through which the country is
no w passing cannot now be. determined, and j
until it is better known, no policy cau be re- i
commended of a permanent character.
No change in the revenue laws can be made .
iv time to meet theao difficulties; and if it .
could, the _u_e causes would produce the -
same restil-s under any laws that might be ,
passed. If Congress, however, _hould de-er- ,
mine upon such a policy—cither wuh a view
to met-1 existing difficulties or l_,r the purpose ]
ot providing for the payment of any portion .
ot the public debt—l c.n only refer them, for (
the views of tbe Department, to my former re- l
ports on that subject.
The Secretary again urges the attention of
Congress to the importance of the bill tor the
consolidation of the revenue laws; the im- i
provemenf of the murine service', substituting j
steam lor sailing vessels, and increasing the j
pay in that department; th.- progress of pub- ,
lie buildings and want of marine hospitals; '
and refers also to reports on the analysis of ,
iron ores, and on J T. Barclay's discovery for (
preven ting the abrasion and counterfeiting of (
United States coin. The fact that, in accord- |
ance with au act of Congress, commissioners t
were sent to the international Statistical Con- ,
gress in Loudon last July, is also referred to, "
with the further tact tbat the Hon. A. ti. Long- \
street, of South Carolina, withdrew therefrom s
oa the tlrs' day of the aeaaion, on account of t
tlu* presence of a negro as a member of the i
body. The report of the Judge on the subject j
is submitted, and Secretary Cobb adds : .'
"It is only necessary to say that the with- t
drawal of Judge L.ongstret-1 front the Cou- ,
greßß,nnd hi.- refusal to return to its delibera- t
tion*, received the entire approval ol bis Gov- .
eminent." i

Persevering efforts have been made, so far
as the limited number ol clerks would permit,
to find the 'rue causes for 'he non-delivery,
especially of valuable letters, and the result
hai been to confirm the former experience of
the department, as stated in mv annual re
port of last year, and my special report of 7th
May last. For example, out of 8,002 cases, iv
which the liititiiries ol the department have
b.-en answered, or where causes were patent
without inquiry, 3,983 letters were misdirect
ed, 621 illegally directed,sß3 directed to tran
sient persons, 338 to person* moved away, 657
not mailed for want of postage, 885 directed to
fictitious persons or firms, 54 without any ad
dress or direction, :i4 mis-sent—leaving, out of
r J ,ou*.,only 1,341 letters properly addressed, m.d
only 884 for the non-delivery of which the de
partment is blameable, 857 having become
dead because not prepaid.
The measures of reform proposed in my last
annual report, not having been adopted by
Congress, the anticipated improvement in the
financial stums of the department is not real
ized ; and although the estimated deficiency
for the year 1862 ia $i,683,83_.G3 less than the
deficiency for 1859, still the department is leti
very far irom that position of independence
which, iv my opinion, it should occupy.

Larger denominations of pos'age stamps
ha.c been adopted and introduced, .specially
for the purpose ef affording requisite facilities
to prepay tho postage on letters to foreign (
countries, and of removing all excuses hereto- ]
fore existing for paying such postages in ,
money. The new denominations are twenty- j
four cents, thirty cents, aud ninety cents.
The Secretary proceeds to argue in favor of
declaring city streets legal post routes. The
registration of lettors he regards as a failure.
The registered letters are no more carefully
attended to in the post-oflic's, or by the man ]
agents and the distinguishing mark ou tli-in '
only the more readily tells the dishonest which 1
letters are valuable. He recommends itsabol
ishmeut. The rate of postage between the East- '
eru States and any point west of the Rocky J
Mountains, and vice versa, should be raised to
lv centa per letter. '
HKPORT Ol THK BBCKETARY OF WAR.
The Indian outrages in New Mexico and 7
Utah laat year were very numerous, and not :
less than 5500,000 has been expended in mov
ing tbe troops against '.he savages. The Ka
periuteudence of tho Indians, the Secretary !
thinks, should be transferred to the War De
partment. Iv the (_tuarterma6tora bureau !
since became Into the Department over §24,.
000,000 has been di sbursed by about 230 dis- l
burning tlllcers, of which all has beeu ac- '
counted for except about _._4,.j00 which will J
yet be made good. J'
With regard to the facilities for sending ?
troops from the Atlantic to the Pacific, it is \
stated that at au early period last season the *
detachment of recruits, amountmg to threa J
hundred men, embarked at St. Louis ou the
Ud ol May on two steamboats ot light draught, *
a:;d with all the necessary appliances for such
a march, set out on the journey. The season ?
was the least propitious of any for some years
as the water was very low from fail
ure of rains in the spring and of the .
usual quantity of snow dunug the win-
ter amongst the Kooky Mountain range.—
But, notwithstanding this disadvantage, the '
expedition made good pragmas, reached Fort ?
Benton by the secoud day of July withont *
any material hindratice, aud took up their :
liny of march for the Pacific. Transportation
had been provided for them, and although *
there was some little delay in its reaching the
command, it caused no material detention and c
remlted in no inoouveuieuce. After a prospe- *•
rotis march of less than sixty days from F*rt *
Benton, the command arrived iv safety and a
quod couditior. at Fort Walla-Walla. This 1
march, covering a distance of three thousand t
miles by water and six hundred by land, has .
been made tv the space ot five mouths, (during tl
one of which the troops were halted,) through a
au unknown and wilderness country, with no 1
great additional expense beyond that ot an or- t
diuary march, and without any serious acci- a
dent. *•
Killing our present cannon, the establish- J
m_ut of a uational cannon foundry, the adop- ,
tion of breach-loading arms, and the equip- v,
inent of militia ol the country, are all urged.

The Oharleaton Mercury has the l.llowing
ediurisl on the propriety of delaying seces
sion to wait for Virginia :
We are to delay, "uutil Virginia can be
heard," according to the modeet proposal of
the Hon. Mr. Ganiett, at the late Kssex lneet-
Inr. We are to delay, until we shall «cc
whether their Personal Liberty Acta will not
be repealed by the Legislatures of Northern
States. We are to delay, until all the South
ern States shall meet 111 Convection fer con
ference. We are .0 delay, until Mr. Lincoln's
administration aliall show, by "overt acts"
its hostility to tbe South. We propose brielly
to ÜBe up theae several causes for delay :
I. We are to delay, that Virginia may be
heard." Why ahould the Southern States
delay any action of theirs, "that Virginia may
be heard V Hid not Mississippi and South
Carolina apeak to Virginia laat winter, through
their Commissioner!., formally tent to her
and did Virginia heed their counsels 1 No!
She rejected their propoaal, simply to hold a
conferenoe with them and the other Southern
States. Virginia declined counselling with
va, because her viewa of her interests differed
from ours. She act up an alienation and sep
aration from us, against our most earnest re
monstrances and efforts: and if she now
e.eka to be heard by va, what is her object .
Is it to aid va in our views of policy—to pre
serve our rights or save our institutions?—
Is ot at all. It ia to defeat our policy hy a
Southern Convention, and to drag us along in
aubserviency to her view* of her border in
terests If we respectfully decline to delay in
cure .arse, that she "maT be heard/ we only
treat her as she haa pw..__i;.ly tret.'etl va.
We will be very glad to hear her at all times ;
but to pauae in the vindication of our rights,
when, n*t nine months ago, she refused even
to counsel with us for their preservation,
would be the sheerest weakness and lolly.
2 But what does Virginia propose that we
ahould do I Why, that the Southern States
should make another begging appeal to tha
Northern States, " tOpr«serc« the guaranties of
the Constitution." Suppose one man should
deliberately violate a compact with another
man, every year, for thirty years, and the*
should give him notice that he intended to
kill him—what would be* thought of the man
hood or the wisdom of the poor oppressed
devil, should h_ go to his oppressor and beg
him •• once more " to observe '• the guaranties
of the Constitution " with him 7 Would not
any unbiased observer believe him to bean
Idiot? If auch a " method of redress '' was pro
posed by Virginia, Hit.r the Siutheru States
had seceded from the Union, there might be
some little reason in it, although the Northern
States have shown that they are utterly inca
pable of observing any c.mpact with any
people. They would then, aowerer, have a
motive to recede from theii aggressive and in
sulting course towards the South. But the
South Is to deiay—she is to do nothing—she is
not to secede—only be?. What does "delay"
mean, under such circumstances, but submis
sion, and the perpetuation of that " blessed
I'nioii " which Virginia would not venture
even to disturb last winter, by the poor expe
dient ol conference amongst the Southern
States •
1 U , . ~..•._.,_,, .1.1 ... _._-_.,_.__. ______~
3. But we are to delay action further, to *cc
If the Northern Legislatures will not repeal
their Pereonnl Liberty Laws. So far as the
Cotton States are concerned, these laws, ex
cepting in the insult they convey to the South,
and the faithiessneaa they indicate in the
_V rth, ara not of the slightest consequence.—
Few or none of oor slates are lost, by being
carried awtiy und protected from recapture in
the Northern Slates. Nor to the frontier
States are they of much consequence. Their
ala yea are stolen am! carried off I —not by the
agency of these Personal Liberty Law?, but
by the combination of individuals in the
Northern States. V. hat are these acts as in
dications of the hostility and faithlessness of
the Northern people towards the South (and
they are nothing more,) when compared with
the mighty sectional despotism they have set
up over the South, in the election of Messrs.
Lincoln and liamiiu to the Presidency and
Vice Presidency of the TJ. S. I Repeal that, and
th-re would be something to invite delay.—
The real cause-, of dissatisfaction iv the Smith
v.ih the Jfor tb, are ia the unjust taxation and
expenditure of the taxe-. by tbe tiuvernraeutof
the United States, and in tho revolution th*
North hss effected in this government, from a
c.iv!. derated republic, to a national sectional
despotism. To prevent these evils, the Soutti
has already delayt! thirty-five years. She is to
"delay longer, upuu the mere speculation,
that the Northern States, without any iuduce
tnen*. created by our action, may, in someeigh
teen months or two years, repeal their Per
sonal Liberty Lawa \Vhat does _uch a policy
mean, but submission 1
4. The last motive for delay goes beyond the
4th of March next. It is that the Abolition Ad
ministration to be Installed the 4ih of March
next,inW ashington.-ias notyetmadean "overt
act" in the way of Abolitionism against the
Southern States. Although you see your ene
my load his rifle with the declared purpose of
taking your lite,you are to wait, as a wiee ex
pedient of defence, until he makes the "overt
aci"—shoots you. This ia one of those glaring
absurdities, which only ..uich daring aubmis
aiouiats aa Botte and Crittenden are capa
ble of proposing. No ordinary mau can hope
to comprehend its mysterious sublimities.

We have been favored, says the Journal of
Commerce, with the following letter from
Hon. A. 11. Stephens, of Georgia, to a friend,
a resident of New York :
CBAWKORDSVILLB, CrA., Nov. 05, IS6O.
I) .tr Sir —Your kind aud esteemed ta.or ot
the 19th inst., is before me, lor which you will
please accept my thanks. I thoroughly agree
witn you as to the nature and extent of the
dangers by which we tire surrounded, and the
importance of united action on the part of our
people, in the line of polity to be pursued.
1 know, also, that there breathes noi ti man
In (J-eorgia who is more sensitively alive io
her rights, interest, safety, honor and glory
than myself, and whatever fate befalls us, 1
earnestly hope that we shall be saved from ihe
worst of an calamities, internal divisions,
contentions and strile. The great and lead
ing object aimed at hy me in Milledgeville was
to produce harmony on a right lii.c of policy.
If the worst comes to the worst, as it may,
and our State has to quit the Union, it la ef
the utmost importance that all our people
ahould be united cordially in this course —
Thia, I feel confident, can ouly be ehected oa
the line of policy I indicated. But candor
compels me to say that I am not without hopes
that our rights maybe maintained and our
wrongs be redressed, ia the Union. If this can
be done, it is my earnest wish. I think, alao
that it ie the wish of a majority of our people.
If, after making un etl'ort, we shall fail, then
all our people will be united iii making or
adopting the last resort, the " ETftisaa.ralio ,«
--|lllll."
Even in thatcaae, I ahould look with grea
apprehension aa to the ultimata result.—
When this Union is dissevered, it of necessity
it must be, 1 see at present but little prospect
of good government afterwards. At the North,
I feel confident, anarchy ivilt soon ensue. Aud
whether'we shall be better off at the Sjuui,
will depend upou many things ttiat I am not
now saustl-d that we have any assurance of.—
Kevolutiousaremuch easier started than con
trolled, aud the meu who begin them, eveu
for the peat purposes and objects, seldom end
them.
The American Revolution of 177(5 waa one
of the few exception* to this remark that the
history of the world furnishes. Human pas
lions are like the winds ; when aroused, they
sweep everything before them in their lury.—
The wise uud the good who attempt to control
them will themselves most likely become the
victims. This has been the histtry of the
downfall of all Republics. The selfish, the
ambitious aud the bad will generally take the
lead. When the moderate men, wlio are pat
riotic, have gone as far as ihey think right
and proper, and propose to reconstruct, then
will be found a class below them, governed by
no principle, but personal objects, who will be
for pushing matters further and further, until
those who sowed the wind wiil find that they
have reaped the whirlwind.
These ure my serious apprehensions. They
ire founded upon the experience of the world
and tbe philosophy ol human nature, auu no
wise mau should condemn tbem. To tear
down and build up again, are very different
things, and before tearing down even a bad
government we should first see a good pros
pect for building up a belter. These are my
views candidly given. If there is one senti
ment iv my breast stronger than all others, it
is an earnest desire for the peace, prosperity
and happiness which a wise and good govern
ment aioue cau secure. I have no objtyt, wish,
desire or ara ration beyond this; aud it 1 should
ln any respect err iv endeavoring ty attain tbia
object, It will be an error of the head aud not
the heart.
With great pergonal eateem and respect, 1
remaiu youra, truly, Ai.ix H. Stbi-übms.

THE JOHNBROWN MEETING IN BOSTON.
ITS BREAKING UP. j
The breaking up of a meeting in Boaton, on j
the 3d mat., held in memory of John Brown, -
haa been noticed in our telegraphic dispatches- '
A negro named J. Sella Martin was chosen
chairman of the meeting, and symptoms of a
row immediately followed. The Express

A call for a committee of one hundred to T
preserve order waa received with hisses
Three cheers were given fordo v. Packer of J
Pennej vania, ar.d his letter to the Committee _
was called for. *
Mr. Sanborn appealed to the audience to i
keep order, and was replied to with hisses and
groans, interspersed with cheers for the Con

The Chief of Police was present with a force
but made only a temporary lull of the storm'
martin commenced a speecn, which was bro

the blame of existing political troubles upon
the conservatism of the cities, and Stales and
W all atreets.

a large majority. r " J c
Fred Ilouglaa then rose again, and was ex- '"
ceedmgly severe iv his condemnation of the 8
proceedings. He made an allusion to Haniel .
Webs er. and three cheers were given for }
Webster and repealed. He wascontinually in- f
errupted with cries that be had exceeded hia ■

ticularly were uproarou*. «
Amotion to dissolve the meeting was car- 1

announced that a meeting would b_ held in ti
his church in the evening. In response to thia *■
announcement, the Baptist Church (colored i .
in Jay street, was filled at au early hour The
edifice was small,and v large proportion ot b
tue audience were black. Here Wendell Phil- h
lips, John Brown, Jr., Fred Dmglas* and 1
oilier leadiug John Bi own sympathizers yen- a
tilated their opinions freely with little inter- o
rnption. A woman, named Cnapman, appear- a

tioued in the church. Utitaide there waa an
immense crowd, and a strong force of police, c
f hedisturbauc. wa.conilned to noisy demon- l
strations, though the crowd Beamed very s
anxious to gethold of liedpath. li
The meeting broke up at ten o'clock, and t;
the audience dispersed quietly. Some of the a.

through the ouuitie crowd, but no violence ci
waa committed.

the meeting. In anticipation of a possible o

tired to know if a new book would be neces
sary iv whicb to record the proceediuga I ,
Mr Jackson hoped a new book would bo pur
chast-d. Ihe old one had fallen iuto the band- ti
9l tbe Phlllistluts aud might not be recovered
lie wanted a clean sheet for the picceediiiga
of tins College.
Mr. Johnson preferred the old one. He was a
for L'iiioti, and did not like to see a severance v
commenced here. He wished the proceedings U
to be recorded with those of better day.,, ao d
that the history might be continuous.
Mr. Jackson waa for Union. No mau ad- °
mired the history of the Republican* of oid i
m-re than himself. He had lak.u Madison as ,j
his guide, and wanted none better. If tha oh! a
book could be found, he did not object to the
continuance of the history, though he waa no I
admirer of Pierce aud Buchanan. 1
The Secretary was thereupon ordered to get
» new book iv which to record the proceed
ings, aud to transcribe them in the old oue, if l
that should be found.

The Panic and Benevolent Operations The
present excited state of tbe country is having
a very deleterious effect upon all benevolent
societies. The Sunday School and Oolportaga
Board of tbe Baptists of tbis Stats held espe
cial m*. ting a few evening* since, in tbis city
to consider wbat course to adopt. The Su
perintendent stated tbat there had been ol late
a marked diminution both in the amount of
sales of books and in donations. Tbe Board
diamissed twelve colporteura.and determined to
retrench as rapidly as possible. It i*agr*at
pity that a work which ia sending tbe ijibjs
into so many destitute families and g_tharinar
sucb multitudes of ignorant cbild;en into the
Sunday School, should be compelled to re
trench its operations se^argely.
