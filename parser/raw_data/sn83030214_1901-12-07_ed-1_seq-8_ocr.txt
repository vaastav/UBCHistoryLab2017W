• •T.jrrvsEinan Theodore E. Burton, of Cleve
land. Ohio, was in the city this week looking
over the proofs of his "Financial Crises and Pe
ri -is of Industrial and Commercial Dopres-
Bion." which will be brought out early in Janu
ary by I>. Appleton & Co. Mr. Burton is chair
man of the Rivers and Harbors Committee, has
had a long experience as a lawyer, and is con
nect« 1 with large business interests. His work
Blight l>e said to be a practical handbook on
the pathology of the body financial. One very
Interesting chapter will be that which treats of
export and import statistics, their varying rela
tion and their signillcance as an Index to pros
perity There is also a chapter on the indica
tions of the approach of a financial crisis or de
pression.
The long expected biography of Eugene Field.
riy Piason Thompson, of "The Chicago Record-
Herald." "Eugene Field: A Study in Heredity
and Contradictions," is published this week by
the Pcribners. Mr. Thompson was a personal
friend of the man whose life he has written, and
lias endeavored to follow Field's own ideas of
biography writing. He says in his preface:
Not as other memoirs are written would Eu
gene Field, were he alive, have this study of his
life. He would think more of making it reflect
the odd personality of the man than rehearse
the birth, development, daily life and works of
the author. If he had undertaken to write his
Ssjib life, as was once his intention, it would
probably have been the most remarkable work
•■ ' turn by an American author that ever
masqueraded in the Quaker garments of facts.
From title page to colophon — on which he would
hav<- insisted— the book would have been one
studied effort to quiz and queer (a favorite word
of his) the innocent and wi!ling-to-be-deluded
reader. Field's idea of perfect memoir was that
It BsMsM contain no facts that might interfere
wiih Ha lieing novel and interesting reading
both to the public and its subject. He set little
store by genius, as he tells us in one of his let
ters, and less by "that nonsense called useful
knowledge."
The latest contribution to tTie mass of Na
poleon literature is a collection of letters which
Napoleon wrote to Josephine between the years
E39S-M3L They have been collected and trans
lated by Henry Foljambe Hall, and will be pub
lished before the end of the treat* by E. P. Dut-
BSta & On. Most of the letters were written at
odd moments during Napoleon's campaigns, and
reflect the scenes of action with which the
writer was surrounded. His love for Josephine
is poured out in many passages. There are ex
tensive historical, social and chronological notes
from contemporary sourrt-s.
The output of the various publishing houses
for this year Is practically at an end. and only
a few volumes are yet to be brought out. mostly
those which have been delayed for various rea
sons. The circulation departments, of course,
are rushed with the work of distributing the
year's product of the presses, but the publishing
department is not Idle. "I expected to find you
doing nothing." said a man who called on a
publisher whose books for the year have all been
sent to the sales agents. It was the coldest and
ra.ist wintry day of the season, and the publish
er was surrounded with a half finished task of
some magnitude. "Spring is coming,"' said the
publisher in reply. The visitor looked out
through the snow spotted windows, and said
that he supposed it was, "You see now why I
am rushed," said the publisher. "Spring is
surely coming:, and we will have more books
than ever l>efore. Just because the Christmas
work has left the shop is no excuse for a holi
day. A publisher works all the time."
Mrs. Anne Besant, sometimes called "the
Prophet-ss of Theoscphy," is the author of a
new buck which Is about to be published by
John Lane, under the title "Esoteric Christian
ity; or. The Lesser Mysteries." The author
lakes up many questions on which there is a
vexed current discussion, from the marriage law
to the paradoxical influences of advancing civ
ilization. *
Ella Xoyes has put much' pood style into the
retelling: of old legends which surround the
"Saints of Italy." and E. P. Dutton & Co. have
produced an attractive book. There are Illus
trations In color from the works of old masters,
and although the book was made for young
people their elders will doubtless find It inter
esting.
Attorneys will be interested in R. Barry
O'Kri<-n's new book. "The Life of Lord Russell
of Kiliowen," which is brought out this week
by Longmans, Green & Co. It is the story of the
life of the famous Irish Jurist, by one who knew
him intimately, and not the least interesting
featur- is the wealth of anecdote which the
author has collected. Here is one which Mr.
O'Brien brings into his introduction as having
repeated it to Lord Russell -when they had offices
in the same court. The autnor says that he
went up to Lord Russell and told him he had
been hearing tuie.-< about him. Russell demanded
tliat he tell nim the stories forthwith.
It is a story of the Northern Circuit. You
were engaged in a case at Liverpool. It was an
uphill caae. The Judge and Jury were dead
against you. The trial had lasted for two days.
.You had failed to shake the witnesses ln cross
examination. You made no headway. Th*- case
a**-rred hopeless. You were horribly irritable,
and swore at every one. On the third day you
began your speech. You spoke for nearly an
bour without *pparenUy producing much effect.
Then the foreman- aaked a question which
•bowed that at lenpfh " you had staggered the
Jury, l'ou answered the question. The Judge
did not like- the answer, and interposed. You
faoed the Jury and stood by your guns. There
■was an altercation between you and the court.
It was the crisis of the case. After a hard fight
you had got hold of the Jury. The Judge Inter
fered to take them out of your, hands. "Who
would succeed? You were still arguing when
your solicitor— an eminently respectable and
ever, pious looking man. with a black frock coat,
black kid gloves and a white tie — he was io
licitor. I believe, for half the families in the dis
trict—arose, and. turning round, wnlepered with
great reserve: "Mr. Russeil. will : jron allow

\-o!ce quite audible to Jud^e an<s Jury. The f ffect

blazed away for another half hour, without in
terruption from any one. The Judge delivered a

went into second editions two day? after the
first editions were given to the public. The Rll9
autobiography has already 1 een published seri
ally, but the demand for the book does not seem
to have been lessened thereby.
Among the books imported by the MacmlHan
Company this week are two dainty volumes In
Bell's Mrtea of famous painters. Charles T.
Bateman tells about G. F. Watts and Rowley
Cleeve writes of the life and work of George
Romney.
Americans will be surprised at the prominence
given to American discover!ea and collections In
'Dragons of the Air." an English work by
H. G. Seeley. which has Just been brought out
by D. Appleton & Co. It describes that ex
traordinary mixture of bird, beast and reptile
known to science as the pterodactyl, and is
called by "The London Academy" "the last and
completest word on the flying dragons."
Historians have never been very energetic
about portraying the House of Hanover, and
Caroline of Anspach. Queen Consort of George
11, has been neglected with the rest. For
ten years before her death she practically
ruled Kngland with the aid of Walpole, and dur
ing these years the great principles of civil and
re'.:gious liberty were firmly established in Eng
land. Now comes the announcement that the
llf > of the Queen Is to be treated in a separate
work of some pretensions, which will b? pub
lished In New- York next week by Longmans,
Green & Co. It will be called "Caroline the Il
lustrious." and Is the work of W. BL Wllklns,
author of "The Love of an Uncrowned Queen."
Fifteen of the Scrlbr.ers' fall books are being
republished !n England by eleven different
hcu»es. Thr list is interesting as showing what
American books are n demand In England, and
includes "The Cavalier," by George W. Cable;
"The Ruling Passion," by Dr. Henry van Dyke;
'■Lives of the Hunted," by F.rneßt Thompson-
Seton: the Hapgood translation of Maxim
Gorky's "Foma Gordyeff"; "Fables for the
Fair," by Josephine Dodge Daekam, and several
works of travel.
"The Life of Sir William Wilson" will be in
teresting to all who have watched the develop
ment of England's colonial power. It has been
written by Francis Henry Skrlne, late of the
Indian Civil Service, and will be published next
week by Longmans, Green & Co. Sir William la
known to the world of literature by several
works on India, and Mr. Skrlne has this to say
about him in his preface to the forthcoming vol
ume:
Sir William Hunter's career exhibited three
•well defined phases. The first was one of prepa
ration for the stern business of life. The next era
embraced a quarter of a century"B work in the
Indian Civil Service, which he entered with the
high-bt honor by the straight gate of open com
petition. Hardly had it begun ere he formed the
lifelong resolve to Interpret India to his fellow
countrymen at home. Its first fruits were the
"Annals of Rural Bengal," which placed him
at twenty-eight in the foremost rank of English
literature. The third stage of Sir William Hun
ter's life included thirteen years spent in Eng
land after the close of his service unrter govern
ment. It was even richer in varied perforrriance
than the preceding period. He wrot»> and edited
histories ard biographies almost without num
ber. Then was commenced the "History of Brit
ish India," which he fondly hop^-d would set a
s?al to his literary fame. This ambition was de
feated by death, but the instalment which he
was able* to give the world has worked a revo
lution in all existing theories as to the rise of
English dominion ln the East.
One of the elaborate art publications of the
end of the year is "Ancient Royal Palaces ln
and Near London," by Thomas R, Way, with de
scriptive notes by Frederick Chapman. It Is
uniform with '"Architectural Remains of Old
Richmond," and the edition is limited to one
hundred copies. The book is published by John
Lane.
One of the most Interesting books of quota
tions for daily reading issued this year la "Liv
ing by the Day." which Is brought out by E. P.
Dutton & Co. The selections are from the writ
ings of Dr. Mlnot J. Savage, of the Church of the
Messiah, in this city.
Our appreciation of Silas G. Platt's "Lincoln
ln Story" seems to have been Justified by the
way in which the reading public has taken up
the work. The sale has been very large, and
there is another edition in prospect.
"The Confessions of a Caricaturist," the auto
biography of Harry Furnise, the English artist,
was published this week by Hnrper & Bros.
The author starts with his early struggles
to find a place ln crowded London. He describes
vividly his career in Parliament, and devotes
many pages to his tour of America. He seems
to have taken particular interest ln the Presi
dential election which was held while he was
here. The work is Illustrated with about 200
Furnlss drawings.
On Monday the Harpers published the last
volume of their very successful "American
Novel SerleF." one of which has appeared each
month since last January. The December in
stalment is "The Debatable Land." by Arthur
Colton. The series will not be continued next
year, although the publishers will bring out a
number of American novels.
An error of a new clerk ln the mailing depart
ment of Harper & Brothers was responsible the
other day for the mailing of a prospectus to a
world famous statesman who has been dead for
some years. The letter was returned the other
day with the following indorsement:
In Heiven, , 1901.
Gentlemen: As your publications are not per
mitted to circulate here, I believe it would be
useless for me to subscribe for them. Yours
respectfully,
and here followed the name of the famous
statesman.

IX Tilt: BLACK CELL
AN INCIDENT IN NEV'-CALEDONIA.
From The Scotsman.
♦ It «Xy US^ 1 \ lle Nou that Mr - Griffith saw the
terrible Cachot NoSr. or Black Cell— "that engine
of mental murder which th.- sentlmentalism of
French Deputies, some of them amnestied com
munards has substituted for the inflnltelv more
merciful lash." The Cachots Noirs were never
opened except at stated Intervals— once every
morning for Inspection, and once every thlrtv
days for exercise and a medical examination of
the prisoner. Mr. Griffith stopped at the doors
of two cases of "ten years' solitary confinement
ln the dark," and asked for the doors to be
opened. The commandant demurred for a mo
ment. Mr. Griffith's credentials were explicit
and the doors were opened. '
"Out of the corner in one came something In
human shape, crouching forward rubbing Us
eyes and blinking at the , unaccustomed light
It had been three and a half years in that horri "
ble hole, about three yards Jong, by one and a
half broad. I gave him a feast of sunshine and
outer air by taking his place for a few minutes
"After the first two or three the minutes length
ened out into hours. I. had absolutely no sense
of sight. I was as blind as though I had been
born without eyes. The blackness seemed to
come down on me like some solid thing and
drive my straining eyes back into mv head It
was literally darkness that could be felt for I
felt It, and the silence was like the silence of
upper space.
"When the double doors opened again the rays
of light seemed to strike mv eyes like daggers'
The criminal whose place I had taken had a
record of infamy which no printable words could
describe, and yet I confess that I pitied him as
he went back into that living death of darkness
and silence."
It is scarcely three years since Mr Griffith
witnessed this atrocity. It is a relief to know
as he informs us in a note, that since then— not'
however, by legislation, but on the authority
of the Mlnlßter of Coloni«?B— this terrible punish
ment has been made much leas aevere."
