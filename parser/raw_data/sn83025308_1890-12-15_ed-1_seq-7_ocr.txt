OUR LITTLE PRESIDENT.
Trying to Make the Next Nomina
tion Valueless to All Save
Himself.
The Story Originated by Some of
Harrison's Own Close
Friends.
He Entertains the Notion That His Pollcy
May be Vindicated in Course
of Time.
It is an unusual form of ambition, but
there are some of Mr. Harrieon's friends
who declare that the one object of his ef
forts just now is to make the nomination in
1892 so nearly worthless that no one but
himself will care, or dare, to take it, says
the New York Times. Men of ordinary
shrewdness in politics will reject this story
"on grounds." as the eminent subject of it
would remark, "of repugnancy." It might
be tempting to Mr. Harrison to make the
prize he covets undesirable to his rivals, but
what, may be asked, would he gain by that
if at the same time he made it equally un
desirable for himself? This line of reason
ing seems to uas so strong that we should
hesitate to give publicity to this story if, as
we have already remarked,ithad not origin
ated with Mr. Harrison's own frienids. And
they are not his false friends eitler. They
are not the Blaines and, be Ingalls
who really delight in the -discomfiture of
their party so far as it loads Mr.. Harrison's
puny shoulders with a heavier weight. They
are men like Mr. I.uston and Mr. Miller
and, we might add, Mr. Noble. Who may be
said to have been discovered, or invented,
by the president, who-ilok upon him with
all the admiration due to that surprising
achievement, and.who really believe that he
has a future, and a fine one.
Of course, these enthusiasts do not put
the facts in quite the bild fashion that, for
the sake of brevity and clearness, we have
adopted. But it amounts to very much the
same thing. What they do say in substance
is that, in the severe trial to which the
republican paity is being subjected, Mr.
Harrison will stand firmly by the policy
and principles of the party, will urge
upon congress, as he has already done, not
to abandon them, but to press them to still
greater lengths, will steadily grant the
prizes of executive patronage to men who
will stand by him in this course, and then,
when the time comes for choosing the next
candidate for president, he will be the
necessary choice, since the patty cannot re
nounce a policy thus forced upon it, and
since he will be the logical and practically I
the sole representative of that policy. It
may be inferred that these gentlemen, as
well as the president himself, must think
that the people will again change their
minds and accept and approve in 1892 what
they rejected and condemned in 1890, and
it is on this view that their amazing pro
gramme is based. The president's message
of this year fairly responds to this reason-.
ing. We submit that it also confirms the
description of the scheme that we have pro
posd.
No one, we suppose, imagined that Mr.
Harrison was capable, not only of seeing
the real meaning of the elections in Novem
ber. but of pointing.it out to his party, and
directing his party in the way that alone
could lead it toward any hope of success in
the presidential election. But it was not
wholly impossible that he might see the
propriety, the decency of taking the pun
ishment administered by the people in si
lence, of making his message a plain bus
iness document, and leaving the real lead
ers of his party free to do what they could'
to recover from this great disaster. That
would have been a course consistent with
self-respect and with the dignits of his
high office. The American people would
have so regarded it and would have recog
nized its merits. But, as the slang of the
day runs. Mr. Harrison is "not
built that way." His small mental
power is coupled with great vanity.
his narrowness of vision with unbounded
confidence in himself. He is quite equal to
entertaining the notion that the crushing
defeat of his party was due to a tactical
mistake of the party or to a hasty impulse
of the voters, that time alone is needed to
vindicate his policy and to bring the Amer
ican people to the conviction that he is the
wisest leader of the party and its only hope
for the future. And there is a certain num
er of men in public life-placed there by
him-who also cherish this notion. Prob
ably it is they who, as the latest Washing
ton story goes, have invited designs from
eminent sculptors for a "life-size statuette
of the president."
OF THE OLDEN TIME.
A Kentucky Minister of the Dare Old
Style.
A tall, thinnish man, with silky pale
brown hair, worn long and put back behind
his ears, the high tops of which bent for
ward a little under the weight, and thus
took on the most remarkable air of paying
incessant attention to everybody an1 every
thing; set far out in front of these ears, as
though it did not wish to be disturbed by
what was heard, a white, wind-splitting
face, calm, beardless, and seeming never to
have been cold, or to have dropped the
kindly dew of perspiration; under the se
rene peak of his forehead a pair of large
gray eyes, patient and dreamy, being hab
itually turned inward upon a mind toiling
with hard abstractions; having within him
a concience burning always like a planet;
a bachelor-being a logician; therefre
sweet-tempered, never having sipped the
sour cup of experience; gazing covertly at
womankind from behind the delicate
veil of unfamiliarity that lends en
chantment; being a bachelor and a book
worm, and therefore already old at 40, and
a little run down in his toilets, a little
frayed out at his elbows and knees, a little
seamy along the back, a little deficient at
the heels; in pooket poor always, and always
the poorer because of a spendthrift habit in
the matter of secret charities: kneeling
down by his small hard bed every
morning and praying that during the
day his logical faculty might discharge its
function morally, and that his moral fao
nlty might discharge its function logically,
and that over all the operations of all hia
other faculties he might find heavenly
grace to exereise both a logical and a moral
control; at night, kneeling down again to
ask forgiveness that, despite his prayer of
the morning, one or. more of these
same faculties-he knew and called
them all familiarly by name. be
ing a physician-had gone wrong
in a manner the most abnormal,

TEN PONIES FOE A WIFE.
Friends Arrauge the Ceremony mad a
Grand opree Followe
Among the fTibetans a man marries only
one wife, whom he purchases from her par
ents a belle often costing as much as ten
ponies and thirty yaks, says a writer in the
Century Magazine. The price to be paid
for the wife is arranged by a relative or a
friend, who acts an go-between, and the
only marriage ceremony is a grand spree,
lasting as lolg as the bridegroom can af
ford to keep It no.
The life of a Tibetan woman in this part
of the country cannot be deemed a hard
one. She makes the tea, it is true, but with
that the housekeeping ends; for no one ever
dreams of cleaning the kettle afterwards.
Sand everyone has to mix his own temba
and lick his bowl clean when he has fin
ished. Every four or five years she may
have to sew a new sheepskin gown
for herself or for some one of her family.
but certainly not oftener. She cannot herd
the cattle or sheep; men must do that, as
there is danger from marauders. She
pastes her time spinning yarn, weaving a
coarse kind of cloth out of which baegs are
made, turning a prayer wheel, and de
stroying too voracious vermin.
Her toilet requires rearranging only four
or five times a year-when she visits Kum
bum or some other fair; she never washes
herself or her garments, and her children
cannot outgrow their clothes. They have
only to let out a little the folds of the
gown, their unique garment, tucked up
around the waist, and it will fit them until
they are grown up.
