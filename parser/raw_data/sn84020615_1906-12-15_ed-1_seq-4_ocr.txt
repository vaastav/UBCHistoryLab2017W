AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY
It is astonishing how the automobile Industry has
niwn in this country. It has loen but a few years
since the automobile was first heard of, and now it is
said that the orders received by American automobile
makers for 1H07 nunilaer 45.000, this representing un In-rrc-ase
of 10, nut) over the output for the year now closing.
The factories are unable to meet the demands made upon
them, in some cases every machine being sold which ran
possibly be constructed during the coming year. At the
exhibit of automobile and automobile fixtures In New
York 224 different machines were displayed, rcprescent
ing a total Nile price or $1.11110,11011. Those figures only
partially indicate the tremendous hold which this method
of transportation is gaining in this country. The foreign
makes of machines must be added to the domestic ones
a Tully sliow thai.
Clearly, the automobile is here to stay, and is to be
calculated upon as a potential factor in the Industrial and
social life of the present and the future. Great steps in
social evolution have resulted from smaller causes.
What began as an expensive toy of the rich is rapidly
becoming a popular necessity. Constant attention to the
development of low-priced motors is steadily increasing
the field of usefulness. The automobile Is bound, like
the trolley car. to immeasurably extend the residence
dis-trieV of cities. Already a writer in a leading maga
zine thinks he foisees one mighty city, .loo miles long
and averaging U least five miles in width, extending
Troni IVrtland, Me., to Washington, as a result of fast
trains, trolleys and automobiles. This seems a dream,
but even dreams have been outdone by fact.
One Interesting and very important result of the
common use of the automobile is the popular Interest it
fxcrles in mechanism. Every automobile show is an ef
fective school In mechanics, and thousands eagerly be
come absorbed pupils. The "scoot cart" driven by a fool,
4o the menace of people's lives, is one thing. Hut the
aatoniubile as a factor in industry, pleasure, business and
social evolution, is quite a different thing. The one
shows the silliness of some individuals. The other dem
onstrates the general progress of the mass.
fortunately for the Oorman empire although unfortunate
ly for the cause of lilorty, one citizen Is not as good as
another when it comes to voting In Germany and the
men who vote the socialist ticket do not hapen to be
the property-owning class or the nobility.
Quite frequently one can see some of the irrigation
plans proposed by the government of this country
spoken of as the greatest irrigation enterprise in the
world. 1 1 Is well known, says the New Mexican, that
the British government has erected on the Nile the most
costly Irrigation works in the world. This river fur
nishes water for the irrigation of 5,000,000 acres, an area
-which though less than that of Chaves or of Socorro
county, yet it. is divided among landowners exceeding in
number I.imio.ooo. Of these, ti.OiMj are Europeans; the
others natives. There are 940,000 farms, less than five
acres in area, supporting their owners. Only 12,noo
fanners have holdings that exceed fifty acres in area,
while 21 per cent of the lands are owned by proprietors
having each between five and twenty acres. Intensive
cultivation is bringing alout marvelous results and New
Mexico may well look to Egypt as a nation that knows
how to husband its land and Its water and Is milking
both do many times the service they do In the arid
regions of the United StateB. What the Nile is to Egypt,
that the Rio Grande should be to New Mexico. No
doubt such will become the case in due time. If the
valley above as well as below this town wero settled
thickly, the farms being small as in Egypt, Albuquerque
would be a very different city from what it Is today.
The MpuliHt party in Kansas is going out of busi
ness. The party east less than 1,200 votts In the 'state
at the last election, and the state chairman says the or
ganisation is disbanded. At one time Kansas was a cha
ttel of populism, which grew until it captured the entire
oommon wealth. That era produced "SockleBs" Simpson,
eccentric and brainy; and Peffer, with his whiskers and
real ability; and Mrs. Elizabeth I-ase the btinglest fe
male platform orator America has produced. The popu
list was a prophet with a message which his generation
rejected. Today the chief things the populists urged are
to be found in the platforms of lioth the big political
parties. Ten years ago the populist was ridiculed for
Ills advocacy of governmental authority. The stone that
waa then rejected of the builders has become the head of
the corner. That vision of the populist, thought to be
hut a barren ideality the vision of federal power and in
tervention is now not only an accepted truism, but it Is
sought to extend It to its farthest limit. Surely Simpson
and Peffer ami Incase and Weller have been vindicated.
The degeneracy of the American people, no doubt en
oouraged and cultivated through yellow Journalism, is
Hadly illustrated by a telegram from Syracuse, N. Y.,
which tells that thousands of people crowded Un; depot
there to catch a glimpse of Chester Gillette, convicted
of the murder of Grace Brown. A conservative estimate
of the size of the crowd which struggled and scrambled
to see the condemned man can be placed at lu.ooo per
sons. And only a handful got the desired glimpse
These fortunate ones clambered on the car platform, and
peering through the window in the car door, saw the
criminal. Sheriff Klock had wired ahead f;r social po
lice arrangements, hut it. would have laken a squad of
New York reserves 200 strong to have roped with the
situation. Gillette would have been nulled to nieces if
hU keepers had been obliged to take him from the
Buffalo train to the one for Auburn In the regular way.
The special theatrical car was a godsend to the officers.
Comment is uun"cesHury.
Consul Malleu, representative of the Mexican gov
ernment at El Paso, was notified the other day by his
government that he treaty had been ratified with the
United States, ly which Mexico will accept a certain
proporion of water from the proposed Elephant Unite
reservoir in lieu of $20,imhi,ihih damages asked (,f this
country for deprivation of claimed water rights. It is
doubtful if Mexico had any just claim in the premises,
but the American government acted with its iisiihI lili
erality. Hut now that this contention has been ninmel
out of the way. the i'nited States should demand ol
Mexico reputation for the lininen.se damage inflicted upon
this country by the turning of the Colorado river iato
the Sulton sink. This was done through iinunipeieuee of
those whom the Mexican gowrntucnt allowed t,, i, the
river on Mexican t rritorv.

$ ABOUT GREAT TREASURES 8
g SUNK IN GREAT LAKES $
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXKXXXXXX
Those who live along their shores, but voyage on
their watets only In the way of summer holiday excur
sions, are wor.t to regard the American lakes as rather
commonplace affairs, with little of the romance or mys
tery of the salt seas about them. We sehlom think of
"vanished" ships, lost with none to tell the tale of tnelr
fate, In connection with the lakes, or of treasure ships
whose wreck ar- sought for years and tire well worth
the search.
Huron is sometimes called "The I-nke of Sunken Treas
ure," as there are believed to be more wrecks with valu
able cargoes In the neighborhood of Saginaw bay than
anywhere else. In the days when the Huron shore was
filled with lumber camps large sums of money were ship
ped in small vessels, and many of these were lost. And
In these waters lia-s the great prize of the lake treasure
seeker.
In ISC the steamer Pewabic, with nearly $500,000
in copper from the Lake Superior mines, simply vanish
ed In Lake Huron. For over thirty years expedition after
expedition sought the wreck in vain. Finally, In 1897, a
party from Milwaukee sttcceded In locating the hulk of
the Pewabic about six miles southeast of Thunder bay.
Owing to the depth of water only $7,000 worth of cop
lKr has as yet been recovered.
Nor is lake treasure seking without Its perils. In
raising, in r.toi, tne steamer William Home, sunk in
lS'i.'a with $20,000 worth of steel billets off Swlshwah
point. Lake Michigan, one diver was killed and another
paralyzed. And many men ha,ve been overtaken by sud
den storms ami drowned while treasure hunting in the
lakes.
In the twenty years bet wen 1878 and 1808, there
were n.S'.lil wrecks on the lanes, or wnicn l.uys were
total losses. The total cargo loss on the lakes is esti
mated at n it less than $12,000,000, much of It In indis
tructible form of property. These tales of sunken treasure
go clear back to lf80, when the Griffon, La Salle's ship,
disappeared in Lake Huron with $12,000 In gold coin.
Altogether there Is In the history of the American i
lakes no more lack of the materials of romance than
there Is lack of human daring and suffering in the daily
lives of those who contend with their stormy waters.

PRESIDENT'S DEMAND FOR 0
GREATER NATIONAL POWER
OOCXe oXJCOCiDCCXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX J
Are we on the eve of another great congressional
debate on the doctrine of states rights?
Is the president's message on admitting the Japs to
the public schools of San Francisco anal the threat to
use all the power he has as president to enforce the
rights of aliens under treaties, merely a lubrication ot
the ways preparatory to launching the Wilson aloct.-ine?
Has President Roosevelt put himself at the head ot
a movement to bridge over the blanks between the
limits of possible state jurisdiction and the limits of
actual national jurisdiction over the contrail of the great
business corporations, and to so broailly interpret the
powers of the national government that congress may go
beyond constitutional limitations and exercise general
rights and powers not derived from the particular stata-s,
but resulting from the union of the whole?
Who was James Wilson and what is the WHson
doctrine?
These are queset ions which statesmen, politicians and
constitutional lawyers will be asking on the heads of
the president's ma'ssage, when they coma' to put two and
two tagether.
An interesting light is thrown on the president'.
meaning when what he says in his nia-ssagaf concerning
governmental regulation of corporations anal the Jap
anese controversy Is consida'retl in connection with bis
speech at the dedication of Pennsylvania's new capitol
and a recent explanation of the so-called Wilson doctrine
as circulateal by Andrew Carnegie.
In the president's speech at tne dedication of I'enn
slyvania's new capitol ha said: "I cannot da better
than base my thetjry of governmental union upon the
wairals ami ilea-ais of one of Pennsylvania's gra-ata'st sons,
Justice James Wilson. e believed in the peo
ple with the faith aif Abraham Lincoln, and. coupled with
his faith in the people, he had what most of the men who
in his generation believed in the people dial not have
that is, the courage to recognize the faa-t mat faith In
the people amounted to nothing unless the representa
tives of the people assembled together In t he national
government were given full and complete power ta work
on behalf of the people. He developed even before Mar
shall the doctrine (absolutely essential not merely to
the efflia'ney but to the existence of this nation) that an
inherent power restasl in the nation, outside of the enu
merated powers conferred upon it by the constitution,
in all cases where the object Involved was beyond the
power of the several states and was a power ordinarily
exercised by saivereign nations."
JTesiitent Koohevclt then went am in the same
speech ta make the application ta existing governmental
difficult ia-s. "Certain judicial decisions have alone just
what Wilson feared." he saial. "They have as a matter
of fact. left. vacancies, left blanks between the limits
of possible state jurisdiction and ilia- limits of actual
natbmal jurisdiction over the control of the great busi
ness corporations. It Is tha- narrow construction of the
powers aif the national government which In our de
mocracy has prova-d the chief means aif limiting the nat
ional Kiwer to cut autt abuses, and which Is now that
chief bulwark of 1l1ai.se great moiieyeal interests which
oppaisa- and dread any atti-mpt to placa- tlit tn un.b r t f!i
cient go a rumeutal control."
This exploitation of the Wilson aloctrii:,. by I hi presl
ab tit himself may throw llgln a;n what h,. means when
hi' s.ns in thill part aif his mi-snagc relating to the super
vision a.f corporations:
"111 some method, whether by ll.ltinllal license law
or in on lia r fashion, we must a t rcise, and that at an
eariy ilan ;, far mmm,. complete cmlrol than at pra s
ettt ovat thesa. gnat corporal 'oiis a control that will,
among oilier ihings, pri vent 1 hi' evils of exra-ssiw aiva'i-
capualizai ton, and that will compel ihi' iliseltasuie of
each big c rpaiiation of its stockhoblers and of Its praip
arias and luisiiu ss. whether owni'd din-atly or through
subsidiary air atlilialeil companies "
It may throw light also on this i a-t'-i t-iu-- to the
Japanese situation in tha- message: "One ad' t It great
a iuli.it rassiiunl s ai landing tha- performance of our in
larnatinnal obligates is the tact that ilia- statutes of tha
Cui'i'd States are t n:ivl inaala apiaa- Tha y fail to give
tlia- national go a rn uia nt sufficiently ainpb' power,

ami navy, to protcat aliens in their rights M-cured to
th. in uinlir so!. 'iiin tietiths whiih an- the law of In

lion to emihle the president to enforce tin- rights aif
apt us iinih r tivalii'S. , At the satin' t i 1 1 1 - ha' says:
'I'hiie shauild. however. 1,,. no particle of aloilbl as to I lie
power of tin' it. uli n, i government complete ley to par
form and i'ii!tirce it s a.n obligation tai other nations. "
