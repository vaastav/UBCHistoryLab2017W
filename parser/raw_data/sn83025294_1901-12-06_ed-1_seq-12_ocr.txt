In view of recent events, the letter fol
lowing: by I. M. Taylor, one of the oldest
and most noted mining engineers and
metallurgists of the Pacific coast, also
celebrated in New York and Washington,
will be of peculiar interest to Colorado
and Montana miners and scientists, says
the Denver Post. As the facts stated
were matters with which he was officially
identified they may be accepted without
question. The letter was written to a
personal friend in this city, from whom
the Post obtained it.
New York. Nov. 24.—In 1SS0 a man by
the name of Tichenor appeared in Wash
ington, D. C., and claimed that he had
made the greatest discovery of the age.
one which would in a short time revolu
tionize the money system of the world.
He claimed that he had just discovered
nature's process for making gold, or, in
other words, he had discovered a process
which enabled him to extract from gold
ore $500 per ton. when the fire assay of
the same ore showed only from $3 to $10
per ton; and that he could do all this
without involving extra expense in ex
tracting the gold.
Had Nothing to Sell.
Strange as it may seem in the light of
subsequent events, Tichenor had no
trouble in finding many believers in his
process among the best classes of men
In Washington, who stood ready to put
up their money in exchange for an inter
est in his process—he all the time telling
them that he had nothing to sell, which,
of course, made them all the more anx
ious to buy.
The Smithsonian institute was called
upon to investigate the process. They
rendered a report which was non-com
mittal; evidently they 'had been "salted"
by Tichenor or one of his associates. This
report had a tendency to increase the
confidence of the public in the process.
Then a man named Schaffer, from New
York, got an option from Tichenor,
agreeing to pay $500,000 for the control.
He returned to New York and laid the
matter before some leading mining men.
These men agreed to take it subject to
an examination by their own expert. I
was selected to proceed to Washington
immediately and make a thorough exam
ination and report without delay.
It Was a Great Secret.
On my arrival in Washington I found
Tichenor and two confederates in a well
appointed laboratory. I handed my letter
of introduction to Mr. Tichenor, which
explained my business. He Inquired if I
wished to see a test made of the process.
I replied that what I wanted first of all
was his formula. To this he objected.
Baying it was a secret.
He finally told me that he used chloride
of gold as a re-agent; that the solvent;
gold which the ore contained which the
fire assay would not bring out had an

affinity for the chloride of gold. By
using it in the treatment he was able to
get out all the gold the ore contained.
I then asked him what amount of
chloride of gold he used. He replied,
about 700 milligrams to a pound of ore.
I then told him that was all I wanted to
know, and walked out of the laboratory.
The manner in which he practiced the
deception was by weighing out In your
presence a given number of milligrams
of the chloride of gold and this you
would see him put into the crucible. The
flux he used in. making the assay, how
ever, he would have charged with the
chloride, which enabled him to show any
increase he desired above the amount of
the fire assay.
Told Them It Was a Fraud.
I wrote a letter to the New York par
ties and without going into details, told
them that the whole thing was a fraud
from beginning to end; that their own
common sense would tell them it would
be impossible for theire to be anything in
gold ore that a chemical analysis would
not disclose, and that anyone who
claimed there was and tried to make
others believe it was a fraud, trying to
play on the credulity of the public for
the purpose of making money by a pre
meditated swindle.
From Washington I went to California,
thinking I had heard the last of the
Tichenor swindle. At the end of three
months I returned to New York and to
my surprise found that Tichenor had
succeeded in convincing my friends that
his process was all he claimed for it. and
that they had incorporated a company
with a capital of $25,000,000 and had ap
plied for a patent on the process. What
they claimed in their application for a
patent was so unreasonable the patent
office refused to grant a patent. Sher
man was at that time secretary of the
treasury and they applied to him to
have an investigation made.
Exhibits Gold Bricks.
I saved them ail this trouble. The
thing which troubled them most was the
fear that when the great discovery be
came generally known the value of gold
would depreciate. They determined to
keep the process secret as long as possi
ble, which would enable them to regulate
the output of gold. To this end they ap
pointed a committee to call on me at the
St. James hotel. They informed me that
I had made a grave mistake in my re
port on the Tichenor process, but they
wanted to give me one more chance to
change my report before it was too late.
They said they had demonstrated the
success of the process by working a num
' her of tons of ore, and that if I would
come to the office they would show me
the gold bricks. They also stated that
in no instance did they get less than $300
per ton more than the fire assay showed.
I went to their office the next morning,
where they opened the safe and showed
me a stack of gold bricks, ranging in
value from $10 to $500. The weight and
fineness was stamped on each brick, and
they were all nearly pure gold. I saw at
a glance that these bricks had all been
made from the chloride of gold. I then
asked them how and where they made
the gold. They took me to their labora
tory, which was located in a building on
John street. The outside of the building
looked very much like a prison, and it
was only after considerable delay that we
were admitted. I there found the same
three "alchemists" I had met in Wash
ington.
How the Work Was Done.
In the center of one of the rooms I
found a tank lined with porcelain, which
would hold about a ton of ore. It was
in this tank that the mixing was done.
They would first put the ore in the tank,
and then weigh out the amount of chlo
ride of gold which they claimed to be
necessary for the treatment and mix It
with the ore. A pipe was connected with
the tank from the outside of the build
ing. so arranged as to enable them to
force the chloride In solutions Into the
ore. In this way they were able to make
the ore assay whatever they wanted It to
go above the assay before treatment.
The ore, after being mixed In this man
ner, was sent to the Babcock Refining
works, where the gold was taken out and
the bricks put on exhibition.
The company offered to turn the labor
atory over to me In order that I might
make any test I desired. I told them
this was not necessary. I finally said to
the three "alchemists" that I would be
there the next morning at 10 o'clock In
company with two other parties, and they
would then be required to show up their
process to the satisfaction of all con
cerned, otherwise I would have them all
behind the bars before night.
Last of the Alchemists.
When we arrived the next morning the i
place was dosed, and that was the test
of the Tichenor process. The company
lost $208.000 in the venture, and all they
had to show for it was their experience.
Finally I will state as a general prin-,
ciple that a man who claims to have dis
covered a process that enables him to
take from a ton of gold ore from $100 to
$500 more than the fire assay shows does
not deserve any more consideration or
respect than one who may claim that he
lias discovered a chemical process where
by he can manufacture potatoes for 5
cents a bushel and put them on the mar
tlet In competition with the farmers. A
careful fire assay will bring out all gold
found in quartz, no matter in what form
the gold may be."
NEW COAii MINE.
It Is Being Opened by the Northern
Pacific Company.
The Northern Pacific Railroad com
pany is opening up some coal lands be
tween Bozeman and Livingston and is
making a good showing. The vein is 11
feet wide and has boen explored a dis
tance of 200 feet. Two carloads of the
fuel are now ready for shipment to the
East where It will be tested, as it is not
yet known how good it is although it
looks like a first-class article. It is the
intention of the company to make a mine
of the deposit if possible. The coal sup
ply for the Montana portion of the road
is now obtained from the mines at Red
Lodge, but the transportation charges
from Laurel to Muir are high, amounting
to about a third of the cost of mining it.

OVERLOOKED A BET
TWO HUNTERS DISCOVER GOLD
NEAR MISSOURI RIVER.
THEY DID NOT CARE FOR IT
Wolf Pelts Had the Call on Their Am
bition—Their Apathy Equals That
of Bill Rodgers, the Wyom
ing Cowboy.
Two wolf hunters from the Missouri
river dropped into Great Falls a few days
ago and reported that while knocking
about in the vicinity of Portage Coulee,
21 miles from Great Falls, they had
struck gold in the gravel there. They
expressed the belief that the ground con
tained the yellow metal in paying quan
tities, but as they wore after wolf hides
and knew more about them than mining
for gold they expected to continue the
hunting of hides and allow someone else
to sluice the gold.
The story jif these men is not unlike
the one told by Bill Rodgers in this city
about a year ago. Fifteen years ago
Rodgers was a cowboy in the vicinity of
the Black Hills of South Dakota. One
day while riding the range he ran across
a spring of oil. He st ipped and greased
his hoots with s >me of the oil and then
rode back to the home ranch, 25 miles
away.
"Where did y u got that shine?" ask
ed another cowboy as Bill waded into
the corral.
"Found it out on thp prairie," replied
Dodgers. "I was out looking for maver
icks and just sighted it accidentally."
At Intervals for several months after
that Rodgers and other cowboys visited
that "shine" spot and softened the
leather of their hoots with the oil, but
it never occurred to them that they were
overlooking a good thing by not locating
the ground for oil and coal purposes.
News of the discovery s on penetrated
the mining districts of the Black Hills
and one day when Rodgers dropped down
to get another shine tie found the spring
located. Since then wel's have been sunk
and oil struck in large quantities. A town
has sprung up near by and a coal mine
opened not half a mile from the wells.
But Rodgers was looking for maver
icks worth at that lime about $20 each
and did not care to be handicapped by
million dollar oil wells and coal mines
with a few choice town lots tn Rodgers
ville thrown dn on the side.
