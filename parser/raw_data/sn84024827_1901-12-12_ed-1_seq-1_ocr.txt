Final Testimony and Arguments
of Counsel. Both Sides
Satisfied.
MORNISO SESSION, WEDNESDAY.
W. H. Brophy, manager of the mer
cantile department of the Coppci
Queen company, was the first witnesii
called. Mr. Brophy testified that ho
bad not furnished the figures upoi
which the return to the assessor br.d
apparently been made, but the valua
tion, or cost, of the merchandise in the
Bisbee store on Feb. 1, of the current
year, was, as per an inventory taken'
commencing Jan. 23, as Mr. Douglas
had given it to the Board of Equalliza
tion in his personal statement to that
body when in session.
G. W. Swain, Wm. Herring and P.
B. Warnekros, were each examined as
to value of mining properties owned by
them, respectively, in this county.
Each of these gentlemen testified to
owning interests In mining property
which they consider valuable, but as
yet none of them has produced any
revenue, Bums expended in develop
ment having exceeded in amount the
proceeds from the ore extracted.
After plaintiff bad through counsel
announced their case as closed, appli
cation was made by counsel for the
introduction of the return for taxation
o! the Copper Queen company purport,
lag to have been "made by Walter
Douglas as superintendent, and to have
been signed and sworn to by him.
Col. Herring arose and stated that if
the document be admitted he would
ask to be permitted to show that Wal
ter Douglas was not in Cochise connty
at the time this document appeared to
have been signed by him, nor wu he
in this territory at this time or even
nearly so, either before or after the
date of the return. That he would ask
to be allowed to provethat the affixing
of names to such documents was mere
ly a form and understood to be so by
the assessing officers who returned
them.
The counsel for the county, through
Mr. English, asked that they be allow
ed thirty minutes for consultation,
stating that probably they would not
consider it necessary to introduce any
oral testimony. The court inquired
how mud. time the coansel expected
to occupy in argument, and an agree
ment was reached between counsel that
two hours on each side would be snffi
cient. This was satisfactory to the
court, by whom it was ordered that
two hours for each side be the limit to
which argument wonld be restricted
A recess was taken until 1:30 p. m.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
The court opened promptly at 1:30 p.
m. Mr. Reay was called and was asked
by Mr. 'English. "Did yon, hear the tes
timony of witness Ellison 'given last
evening to the effect that you remarked
on the street in Tombstone one even
ing last summer that you had the Cop
per Queen company crushed? Ys.
Did that or any similar conversation
occur? No, nor at any other time.
At this point the defendant rested
their case, stating, by counsel, they,
would introduce no testimony. Walter

by plaintiff. He was questioned by
Col. Herring concerning exhibit No. 1,
filed by coansel for the county, being
the return of the Copper Queen Com
pany to the assessor, of taxable prop
erty owned in Cochise county by that
company. Question to Mr. Fife was,
"Did Walter Douglas ever sign, swear
to or afSirm to this return?" Ans.
"Never in my presence. Never saw
Walter Douglas in connection with this
paper," Witness added "This paper
was sent to me by mail from the com
pany's office in BIsbee. '
Colonel Herring commenced his ar
gument at 2:20 p. m, and spoke for an
hour and ten minutes. He opened by
saying Impressively that the facts in
this case as brought out by the evi
dence are of great importance in de
termining the law governing it. Au
thorities have been numerously and
freely mentioned by both sides daring
the argument In this case on a demur
rer to the complaint. The duties of
county officials, said Col Herring, are
fully defined by territorial statute,
which he quoted. The assessor is pre
sumed to know and to follow the law.
The plaintiff listed their mining prop
erty by the acreage end necessarily
so as to be in conformity with the stat
utes. The patented mines of the Cop
per Queen Co. are listed and so desig
nated for the purpose of proper iden
tification only. He took occasion in
this connection to state that if a person
after securing a patent to land in ig
norance of such land containing within
its limits any mine or mines and after
ward discovers the mine or mines they
are his. As to value of mines the evi
dence of valuable ore having been ex
tracted therefrom, cannot of itself be
accepted as proof "of subsequent -value
and taken as a basis upon wnich to fix
their taxable value. To do this In con
formity with the statute diligent in
quiry or a careful examination of the
property should be made. Referring
to the duties of the Board of Equaliza
tion the counsel claimed that this
Board had not given his client notice
of intention to equalize the assessment
roll of the county although required to
do so by the the provision of the stat
nte. He read a resolution adopted by
tills Board of Equalization to the effect
that the returned assessment of the Cop
per Queen property wa3 too small. In
continuing the counsel claimed that
the return of the Copper Queen com
pany was made at a fair valuation and
in strict conformity with the require
merits of the territorial statutes gov
erning such returns. The raises In
valuation by the Board of Equalization
were made arbitrarily and not sup
ported by any evidence justifying such
increase. Referred to Mr. Reay's tes
timony that his estimates of the values
of the mines of the company were "as
sumptions although they were not
guesses." York and Delahanty based
their opinion of these values upon Mr.
Reay's "assumptions." The Board had
no right to exercise merely arbitrary
discretion unsupported by evidence up
on which to base their opinion.
Col. Herring termed the action of
the board "arbitrary exaction." He
referred to the raises made seriatim
and said the board intentionally stepped
aside to discriminate against the Cop
per Queen company and to its pecuniary
Injury, and claimed that their action
was oppressive and unjust.
Judge McFarland opened the argu
ment for the county at 330 p. m. with
the remark that this case and its de
termination is a matter of great im
portance not only to the citizens and
-
The Plumber.
THE JEWELER
taxpayers of this county alone but
those throughout the entire territory,
He went on to say, "So far as I am
concerned I think that after the com'
plaint has been stripped of its persl-
'age and the trash thrown away but
one or two questions remain for con
sideration by the court," The Judge
continued: "We are confronted by
the remarkable proproposition that
failure of the assessor to have perform
ed his duty is evidence of fraud." Be
fore an official can be deemed guilty of
neglect he should be given a hearing.
However, whatever derlliction of duty
may be charged against the assessor,
I no portion of it can in any degree be
fastened upon the board of equaliza
tion. The position assumed by Col.
Herring that mines and mining claims
must be assessed merely by their acre
age and at a uniform valuation is
clearly eroneous. The statute plainly
providing that all property shall be
assessed at its actual cash value. The
assumption that all mines are of equal
value per acre is simply absurd, and
uniformity In classification or valuation
of mines plainly Impossible and pre
posterous. The contention by opposing
counsel that boards .of equalization
most have evidence upon which to
base their valuations; that they must
not act capriciously is'not worthy of
argument, it cannot be denied. The
question is what is the nature of the
evidence that is required. This board
had clearly the right to form an opin
ion upon the information they had ac
quired and to act upon such an opin
ion. Judge McFarland has noted
authorities in suDport of this state
ment. The board can lawfully act
upon their own knowledge and infor
mation and their action upon it Is con
clusive and final and cannot be affected
excepting by proof of caprlciousness,
oppressiveness or unjust discrimina
tion to a degree constituting fraud.
Alien R. English, of counsel for the
county followed Judge McFarland Im
mediately. He first i ef erred to the clause in the
complaint filed by the Copper Queen
company in wnich they speak of
"hundreds, cf like claims patented
mines which were not assessed accord
ing to their value." Where were
these mining properties in Cochise
county like those of the Copper Queen
company.. Have they brought home
to the knowledge of the board of equal
ization or to the county assessor any
like properties? They have not in
troduced any testimony showing that
they bad any knowledge of any like
properties. No evidence of fraud in
the method pursued bv the board in
assessing the Copper Queen properties
has been introduced by them or of any
intent to oppress or discriminate against
that company. Mr. English said fur
ther that the Copper Queen company
ha3 very carefully omitted to intro
duce any testimony tending to show the
actual cash value of their mining prop
erties as a whole. The only point in
their contention really is that they
have for twenty-one years escaped in
this county their equal share of taxa
tion and think they should so continue.
COLONEL herkino closed the case.
He commenced by attacking the ar
gument of Mr. English and character
ized it as an "imbecile one." Referr
ing to his previous statement, claiming
that the board of equalization and the
county assessor had failed to faithfully
perform their duty, be now said that
such failure was through no fault of
his clients, but was the fault of the
voters of this county who had elected
these officials. The members of the
board of equalization and the county
assessor knew, of their own knowledge,
of many mining claims of value which
were not placed on the assessment rolls.
The board were evidently after the
Copper Queen company and had deter
mined to "cinch" them, as Mr.'Ueay
had expressed it Had it not been for
the capital cf that company and its
enterprise and liberality there might
not today have been any organized
Cochise connty, no money to pay offi
cials or to continue in operation the
official machinery of the county Col.
Herring then proceeded to review from
a legal standpoint the authorities
quoted by opposing counsel. In re
ferring to the valuation placed upon
the Copper Queen properties by the
boarl of equalization he denominated
them as mere guesses. No testimony
cacrbe referred to as supporting these
valuitions. The complainant concedes
that a positive and intentional discrim
tion against the Copper Qneen com
pany must be shown, and to.snch a de
gree that fraud can be at least reason
ably inferred, In order to secure the
relief prayed for in plaintiff's petition.
This we claim we havo done by uncon
tradicted testimony. The moment the
board found that the Lowell & Arizona
properties were not to be taxed to the
Copper Queen company they granted
Mr. Fenner's request for a reduction,
and the redaction was from $500,000 to
less than $100,000. Did not this show
intentional discrimination? They dug
a pit and fell Into it. Colonel Herring
referred to Thomas R. York as a wild
eyed butcher who had a feeling of mal
ice toward the -Copper Queen company
because, as he said, that company had
made a profit of (14,000,000 from their
mines in this county. Our opponents
say the board did all they could. It
that be so I sm sorry, since they did

ciein hands, having paid into the
county treasury over $14,000, which we
concede to be due the county for taxes
based upon a just valuation of the
property of the company. Colonel
Herring concluded by stating that
fraud upon the part of the board of
equalization had been clearly estab
lished. THURSDAY MORNING).
The court was in session promptly at
9:30. Previous to this hour quite a
