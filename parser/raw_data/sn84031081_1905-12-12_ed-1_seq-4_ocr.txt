Consent of the Governed
-
OME of the papers which oppose the admission of New Mexico and Ariz
ona as one state, pretend to base theia oppoHition upon the words of
the declaration, to the effect that all government derive their Just
powers from the consent of the governed. Those words proclaim a
fundamental fact which no believer In free Institutions will ever deny. But
when used by the enemies of statehood us un argument against the statehood
bill now before congress, they are used In exactly the same sense and for the
name purpose that the pickpocket raises the cry of "stop thief!" to divert at
tention from himself. The men who are striving to defeat the statehood bill
are the champions of government without the consent of the governed, by
trying to force upon New Mexico and Arizona the territorial form of govern
ment for another term of years, after the people of these territories believe
they have outgrown It, and are capable of exercising the full rights and privi
leges of American citizenship.
Those who advocate Joint statehood 'stand for the consent of the gov
erned, and Insist that it is wrong for congress to compel Arizona and New
Mexico to remain under the semi-despotic form of territorial government,
yithout giving the people a chance to say whether they consent or not.

IN AN" article In the December Issue of the American Illustrated Magazine,
Judse ivier S. (irosscup, of the United States circuit court of appeals,
propounds the above question, and says In proceeding to answer It:
"The government of the' United states collects and disburses every year
over one thousand million dollars. There are some of us who criticise this as
a flood of extravagance. There 'are others who look upon it as the high-water
mark of government success. Hut whatever we think of it as an Item of poll
tics, we nil agree that an annual normal llscal operation, involving one thou
sand million dollars, 1 a new great thing in the history of the nations. Within
the government the ( reatares of the government through one of lis forty
five states, and brought Into being, so f ir as the government Is concerned, by
n line or two found in th" state statute there are at least two corporations
whose fiscal operations exieeel even that vast sum. The fiscal operations of
other corporations, to a large number, approach that sum. And if we had any
way of disentangling the transactions that are strictly corporate, from the en
tire body (if the country's transactions, it would be found, I think, that the
corporate transac tions exceed In magnitude, perhaps nine to one, all the other
business transactions of our people put together that the difference In mag
nitude between the business transactions of a hundred years ago und the bus
iness transactions of today is almost exactly measured by what the corpora
tion has Injected Into the business activities of our people."
He reviews the effect of this condition at some length, and then turning
to a consideration of the remedies to be applied says: "The beginning of tho
way Is national Incorporation. Mr. Bryan, Commissioner Oailleld, hud pos
sibly Mr. Roosevelt, favor what is called federal license. The object of fed
eral licence Is to bit and curb the present corporation to the end that It travel
not ungoverned In the matter of prices. I am for national Incorporation ns
ngalnst federal license, not because the two are nearly alike, as some people
suppose, but because In tin- end to bo attained they are wholly unlike na
tional incorporation being the only method that will directly and effectively
go to the root of the disease, the- peopielzation of the ownership of the new
domain. I would have (he i orporation of the future deal fairly w ith tho pec),
pie In the matter of prices. But I set above that, as the supreme object to be
Attained, thin other thing: That the people of the country be brought back
Into the ownership of the property of the country."
The Judge suggests a number of general characteristics that ought to be
l-mbraccd tn a national incorporation ni t. and concludes as follows:
"The great fact of today Is the domain of private property under corpor
ate ownership. Widely and Individually oyned. In accordance with the lij
' Stlncis of a republican people, this new domain would be the pride of the re
public. Narrowly owned, under procesnes which, kept going, are bound to
narrow its ownership still more, this new domain Is the peril of the republic.
The prevailing temper of the flay is to tear It doyn. But the real problem Is,
tint how to tear It down, nor how to hamper this new great domain, but how
to honorably reclaim it from present conditions that, like the great landed do
main distributed by our fathers among the people, this new do
main may come likewise Into the proprietorship Individually of the people.
In the end some organization will give to this work the momentum of a po
litical movement. The practical question Is: When will some party set out
upon this movement? With the cloud that already liang.4 over tho horizon,
seamed and streaked w ith (lashes of a people's Impatienc e, that when becomes
a question full of significance."
