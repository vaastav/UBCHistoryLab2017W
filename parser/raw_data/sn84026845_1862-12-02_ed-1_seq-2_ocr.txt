Coatrarj to expectations we are without
the President's Message this morning: A
dispatch from the Agent of the Associated
Press in -\e?;Vork, yesterday, informed u=
that it bad been determined not to tele
graph it to the papers West, owing, as it
was said, to the bad condition of the lines.
We are not at all satisfied witb this ex
8aM' M we had made onr arrangements to
furnish it this morning. So macb delin
quency U laid to the account of the lines
thaw times that the excuse is about played |
oot. We shall publish it at the earliest
moment after its reception from Washing
ton.
P. 3.?Since writing the foregoing we
hare receired a co?.*iderabI* synopsis of
the Message, which will at least appease
In a tolerable degree the public anxiety to
know what the document contains.
Words that ought to be Remembered
by the People or Western Virginia.
Those men who so nobly stood by us it,
the V. 8. Senate last summer, when the
prospectsof West Virginia were all orer
cast, by the sudden nod unanticipated
treachery of Mr. Carlile, will deserve im
mortal honor and remembranre from our
people when the new State becomes one of
th<- Union, Chief among them vrjll for
ever stand brare old Ben. Wade of Ohio,
whose indignant rebuke of our betrayer is
a master piece of tcatbiog eloquence. His
words ought to be published and republish
ed in erery loyal paper throughout West
Virginia, until they become as familiar as
the hills tbemselres to our people. On
that memorable 14th of July, when Mr. Car
lile was straining every effort, in company
with Powell and S.iul?bury and others, to
accomplish tbe defeat ot tbe new State, to
which np to that hour be had professed
friendship, Old Ben Wade, a stranger,up
on whom we had no claims, rose and said:
"1 certainly did not intend to take any
time in debating this bill; but the rery
extraordinary course tbe Senator from
Virginia has seen tit to take has so entirely
disappointed me that I almost owe an
apology to the Senate itself for urging this
roe?sore with tbe xeal that I did upon its
consideration this morning. I did so at
the request of some of the beat meu of that
State, not only one bot raauy, almost sup
plicating that we should lake it up and get
through with it to day. When I saw a
Senator from the State Itself rise, so evi
dently with no other purpose than to talk
against time, and tbus defeat tbe bill, I
was disappointed beyond measure. We
hare bad a new proposition, a long argu
ment, and a recurrence to old speeches
that bad been made on former occasions,
that must be read here, all coming from h
man pretending to be a friend of this prop,
osition. Any man knnwi that if anything
was calculated under these circumstances
to defeat tbe measure, it was precisely
tbe course he has seen fit to take witb
it. lie tells us that be still is some shape a
friend to it; bnt what haa been the purport
of his speech, except to shake the eonfl.
dence of the Senate, itself in the Constitu
tional Convention that framed the Consti
tution which we have been asked to ratify?
He has gone back of their appointment;*be
has not only undertaken to fiod fault witb
what they bare done, tut he has undertaken
to lay that they were not really organized to
do anything! and it is the first I have beard
of any such thing. We hare eat in
committee with that gentleman; we have
heard hie arguments and illuitratione on the
subjectwe hare had many men of the pro
posed State before as, in council witb us
npon It; and here for the first time [mark
this] to-day tee hear that the Convention
who framed Ihu Constitution really did not
represent the people whom they professed to
represent. Alter all tbe discussions In com
mittee and oat of committee, and in (be
Senate, to-day, for tbe first time, we bear a
oklibkhati, rasNXDlTATSD attack npon the
convention that framed this constitution.
I do not believe that the people of Western
Virginia expected any such arguments from
that quarter. I do not believe they would
have Implored me almost to use what iuBu
?sea I might have to bring this matter be
fore Congress at this late period of the ses
sion, if they believed that one of their owu
representatives waa to riae here and talk by
tbe hour to endeavor to shake tbe confi
dence of the Senate In the competency of
the convention that had framed their con.
stitntion. Sir, thus is souithixo wroxq
sm this hatter. I do not profess to know
-where it is, but it is unnsual; it Is not
what we have heard before. It takes us
all by surprise, and it jeopardises the
measure. 1 hope from the perversity of any
man, tbe people of Western Virginia, who
?r? worthy of our favor, will not cease to re
ceive it because one of their own number
takes a very different view of this subject
from wbat It was expected be would take
I hops w? shall view it as we always have
before, that tbe people of Western Virginia
wars sincere and are sincere, and when
they have aeted in- tbeir Convention upon
this subject, that it Tu a Convention that
met the approbation of tbe people, that they
have been entirely satisfied with iff sctiooi
tbat the people are even more earnest than
the Convention thai what the/ have done
?ball be carried out. Of all this there is
oo doubt or qaestion, and here we are with-*
the ability to-day to trive tbem what they
anxiously demand, unlets we are prevented
by the interposition of new and unheard of
questions by one of their own represents- |
Uvea."

It fully reflects the sentiment of the officers
and soldiers of this division, and I hare no

loyal citizens throughout West Virginia.? .

General Order* So. 36 ]
In these times when our Xatioo is enga
ged in a deadly struggle for its existence :
a struggle involving the demonstration of
tbat great and mighty problem,?the capac
ity of man for self -government?and porten
tioos of consequences more vast to the
human race than any war which has taken
place since the dawn of creation, every
obstacle of succesa sbonld be promptly
and cnhesitatingly destroyed or removed,
cost what it may.
One great obstacle in the way of a com
plete success is the toleration in our midst !
of the publication and circclation of treas- j
ouable Xewpapera, which, not daring in j
the loyal States, to advocate open Treasou ?
and War against the General Government,
are covertly seeking the same end by fo
menting party prejudice against the Gov
ernment; endeavoring the excite alarm
abciUt a great National Debt and ruinous
taxation: to bring the Government paper
curreocy DOW In circulation into discredit
and disrepute; advocating Peace upon any
terms by a disgraceful compromise, and in
various ways exciting opposition to the War
and stealthily spreading a spirit of disaf
fection among the people and in the army,
and poiaoning the minds of both against the
Government; endeavoring to distract, di
| vide and weaken its efforts for the vigor
ous and united prosecution of th* War to a
successful termination. A corrupt au?l dis
loyal press or party may be tolerated in
time of peace with impunity, while reason
is left free to combat error, but, in time of
War, wLeo the voice of reason is drowned
amid the clangor of arms, when men form
'their opinions, however erroneous, and
rush to arms to maintain and enforce them;
no newspaper, or party should be tolerat
ed which dissimioates error and cultivates
hostility to the Government.
No newspaper circulated in Western Vir
ginia, has a more balefal intiu?-nce in this
respect, than the Wheeling Pre**, which is
generally taken by the Secessionists, feeds
and fans their prejudice and opposition to
the beat Government upon earth. Besides
this the poison and treasou which it stealth
ily aud ceaselessly disse ..inates, it has re
cently been endeavoring to excite and stir
up dissatisfaction, disobedience, aud mu
tiny in the army, by inveigLiog against
army orders, and endeavoring to excite
prejudice against them and their authors,
and to bring both into odium with the sol
diery.
It it therefore Ordered, That the Wheeling
Preen shall not anywhere be circulated or
brought within the lines of this commaud,
and all officers and soldiers of this com
tnaod are hereby ordered to immediately
arrest any aud all persons bringing said
paper within our lines or attempting to cir
culate the same therein, and to deliver all
peraous ao arrested to Copt. II. W. Hunter^

A subscriber at Weston writing under
d?te of the 26th nit., says:
Siuce the Kanawha Division passed
through this section we have felt more se
curity in relatiou to guerrilla warfare tbun
we have since the war began. A great
many who left this coumj to avoid the
draft are returning. One fellow who was
with Jenkins eight weeks, told me they
paid nothing, and that he got nothing to
wear and not half enough to eat. They
are all glad to gel home, eren if they have
to go to Camp Chase, preferring a prison
life to one in the Southern army.

"I have been taking the 1'rtw, but :t has
got to be too much secesh for me," is the
postscript to about half the subscription
letters we get, and the remark of fully one
half the people who call at the office to
subscribe. The Pre** has become so un
blushing in Its disloyalty that it Is disgust
ing decent people wherever it reaches.

Wxiwkotov, Nov. 30, '62.
The people of Richmond bare been bar- (
iog iooiberpaoic for the last two weeks.
The removal of Gen. McCtelUn and tbe
rapid movement of Gen. Buroside were ibe
first cause.-. At tbe time of Geo. Barn
aide's movement, Longitree* was in Rich
mond, on r is war to North Carolina, tbe .
campaign in Virginia being supposed to be
over for tbe winter. Part of bis corps =
were with him. They were pal io Ibe
works aroand Richmond at once, while he
took the cars for Fredericksburg, to bold
tbe Rappahannock line if possible, and if
not, to retard ourmorement til! Lee came
op
There are now from twentj to twenty-fire
thousand men in the works around Rich
mond, and but eight thousand north of
that Cirj, including Lee's and Jackson's
forces. Jackson has been recalled
with Hill aod Stuart trom the Shenan
doah Vallejr to form the left wing of
Lee's array. Jackson was opposed to i
coming, and wanted to keep up a divi
sion of our forces by raids into Maryland
and Pennsylvania. but was overruled by
Lee and Davis. Tbe Cabinet at Richmond
bare ordered Lee to throw bis whole army
on tbe Rappahannock, and dispute every
foot of the ground from thence to tbe rebel
Capital. Tbey bare plenty of raw provi
sions, and millions of pounds of beef, pork
and floor are accumulating at Richmond.
Vessels with clothing are running the
blockade erery week, but their army is still
suffering terribly. Numerous recent events
serve to infUme the Richmond panic, such
us Lee suddenly changing from the offen
sive to tbe defensive, bis telegraphing daily
for more men to save the capital, tbe pite
ous appeals of their army for clothes, Geo.
Dix'a capture of their pickets on tbe Chick
abominy, tbe discovery that they lost from
sixty to one hundred thousand men within
tbe last ninety days io battle and by sick
ness and desertion, and tbe indications of
a stave insurrection at the botlidays. Gen.

to have full acquaintance with there facts

8 peclal Washington Dispatches.
FROM FKEDBRICKSBCKG.
A dispatch trom tbe headquarters of
Gen. Sumner, dated Friday, November
20tb, says, tbe ladies from the North who
were visiting friends in Fredericksburg
come over the river yesterday under a
flag of truce. Tbey were taken to the head
quarters of Gen. Snmner, when they stated
their desire to be to return to their fami
lies iu 'the North. After remaining nepr
headquarters all night under guard aod
receiving a full examination of their cases
they were this morning given passes to
Washington.
They represvnttbe feeling in Fredericks
burg to be of tbe most hostile charac
ter ; tbe ladies especially are bitter and
malignant bevood expression. Upon the
approach of the National army they or
ganized meetings and appointed Commit
tees, who were instructed to visit the Kebel
Commanding General to implore bim, upon
their knees if necessary, not to surrender
the city. Tbey preferred having their
dwellings burned to tbe ground to having
them again occupied by Northern troops.
Tbe Rebel force now opposed to General
Bornside, they represent to be very large,
and say that General Bragg has beyond
donbt nuited bis army with that of General
Lee. They state also that General Jack
son will remain in the rear and continue to
menace Washington during the Winter.
More intrenchments on the bight* of
Fredericksburg have been biought to light
to-day by tbe Sigoal Corps. The entire
number which can now be seen with tbe
aid of the best glasses is nearly fifty. Ma
ny of tbem, however, are quite small, and
protect but one gnu. Our own Topograph
ical Engineers are very busy, and a thor
ough knowledge of all the approaches to
the river and the fords will soon be attain
ed. Our left intrenchments are being
thrown up similar to those of tbe rebels.?
Gen. Burntfide, apparently, is quite indif
morning, "Let them work, poor fellows! it
will keep thc-m warm." Two or three re
bel brigades were seen drilling this morn
ing in hd open field, in full sight to the
naked eye. The railroad from Acquia
Creek will be completed by the close of this
week.
THE FAILURE OP THE ARMY TO ADVAXCR.
Very general disposition is manifested
here to cast upon Gen. Meigs the responsi
bility for the failure of the Army of the
Potomac to tnake ?n advance. It is now
stated that when Gens. Halleck and Meigs
visited Gen. Buraside, it was promised that
certain ueceseary articles should be at
Falmouth on tbe arrival of the ttriny, and
tbat the want of these prevented tbe cross
ing of the river before the reinforcemeut
of the enemy. It is further stated, on good
authority, tbat, notwithstanding an nbun.
dance of supplies at Acquia Cieek, the
army is actually suffering for food, from
want of transportation for its conveyance.
For some reasons, many divisions are again
destitute of shoes and clothing.
TUB HEALTH OF THE AHMY.
The health of tlie army is remarkably
good. Contrary as it may be to the opin
ion generally entertained, there is much |
less sickness on the march than when the
troops are encamped. Tbe excitement
consequeut upon seeing new sights, and
participating in new scenes, dispels those j
camp ills (real or imaginary) so common!
among soldiers in a period of inaction.
TUE WHEREABOUTS OF JECKSO.H AXD STUART* ,
The information above referred to came |
from Gen. Sigel's scouts. Tbey report I
that Jackson has taken up his'beadquar- |
ters at Upperville, a little village between
Middleburg and Paris, on the road leading
to Asbty's Gap, and beiweeu forty and fif
ty miles from this place. The nnmber of
men with him or within supporting dis
tance, is not now known, but the bulk of
his force is doubtless near Ashby's Gap.-?
The return of Jacksoa to this vicinity is no
evidence whatever tbat the rebels intend to
attack this position, or to make an attempt
npon Washington, but rather that they
haYe not yei got over their bewilderment
at *he retrograde movement of this corps,
and did not dare to leave entirely exposed
the rear of tbe rebel army in its progress
toward Richmond.
THE WHEREABOUTS OP BTUAET.
From the same source we have informa
tion to the effect that Gen. 8tnart yester
day took np bis headquarters at Salem?
the little village or bamlet bearing tbat
name, three or tour miles west of Thorough
fare Gap. No more is known about his
force than there is of Jackson's. As for
that matter, Jackson's and Stuart's name
adopted by any two persons, with numer
our pickets, a reconnoitering party of 100
picked seen, and a reserve force of one
man, would be all-sufficient to keep tbe
Annt Pollys and all the quidnuncs at the
Capital under a constant excitement for an
indefinite period of time. The Generals
named, with tbe bulk of the troops at their
disposal, might as well and probably will
be?If they are not now?near Richmond,
in a position to aid Lfe in repelling Gen.
Buraside. Gould the press or any other
institution adopt some means to arouse
the authorities at Washington to aconsct- J
ousncss that our troops are expeeted to do |
some other duty than simply to protect the .
Capital by waiting to be attacked, this |
would not be so Tbe rotnmaaditg officer |
of this corps, I am toid, bas asked in Tain i
for permission to unme the offensive, and, j
as a"consequence of this refusal, the rebels
are still in oar front^and there is no cer
tain way of ascertaining in what force, on
less the'present policy is cbaoged.
THE IVDIAX COMTICTS.
Botb the Senators and Representatires ;
from Mionesota are urgent in requesting
tbe President to approve the sentence of
death upon tbe Indians in that State guilty
of the late outrages there. The President,
; however, as well as the Commissioner of
Indian affairs, is opposed to the iofiiction
j ot punishment of such sereritv.
(From the X. Y. Timee.)
The Pre J tide of Battle.
There if SO amazing degree of apathy
: on tbe part of tbe public in regard to the
present face to ;ace antagonism of the Na
\ tional aad rebel armies, on tbe Rappahan
j nock. We cannot account for it on tbe
? ground of unconsciousness of the position.
I Every citizen of the loyal North who reads
[ know *hat Gen. Burnside bas led bis grand
! army, by a sadden oblique movement.
I from tbe line of the Bine Ridge toward
Fredericksburgb, and that Gen. Lee, not
at all blinded by the strategy, immediately
began to concentrate bis whole army at
Fredericksburgb to oppose him. For ten
days tbe two armies have been confronting
each otber in force, only a narrow stream
dividing them,and tbe pickets indulging in
colloquies, not unfrequently within fifty
yards of each other.
Two such bodies cannot remain as these
i two are now situated, almest in actual con
I tact, without tbe early and inevitable con
sequence ot deadly conflict. Each army is
| charged to the muzzle with wrath, and the
j otber knows it. Burnside bolds command
of tbe National troops because McClellan
was too dilatory in offeriog fight. His very
presence at tbe bead of the army is tanta
mount to immediate wager of battle. Gen.
Lee's inclination for a decisive struggle is
the result equally ,of policy and necessity.
His army is larger than be can ever hope to
have it again, and bis men suffer more than
it is safe to make them suffer, from tbe lack
of suitable protection against tbe winter's
cold. Every consideration of policy, pres
sure, and duty is urgiug each bide to the
attack. And there they stand, face to fac*,
with only tbe uarrow river between.?
Burnside ought to have 150,000 meu. Lee
is believed by his Baltimore friends, who
keep communication with bim, to have
130.000, including Stonewall Jackson's
corps.
Vet, with the campaign in Virginia
brought to this imminent verge, there is
no emotion, uo excitement locatch tbe first
booming of canuon in the fight. There was
never so sereat a degree of popular uncon
cern on tbe eve of a gigantic battle. If
there were a universal superstition that tbe
converging of tbe two armies toward Fred
ericksburg were all n gbam. there could
hardly be a quieter lookout on their mena
cing positions in front of that venerable
town. We will not attempt to explain tbe
singular phenomenon we have described.
But certain Iy*a deeper public interest would
be more becoming at such a critical mo.
rnent. Buttles do not always nor oftenest
begin by premeditation. They frequently
commence most unexpectedly to botb com
batants. A stray shot?a misunderstood
movement?an erroneous order bf a subor
dinate?any trifling error, may precipitate
a conflict when opposing host* are placed
as tbe two armies are at Fredericksburg.
Any moment we may hear that blood is
flowing in torrents and tbe fate of tbe
Union hanging on tbe issue of the most
sanguinary battle of the war. No potriot
has excuse to forget the prayer, "God save
the Republic!"
Tike Coal Digger*' Strike?Letter Trora
John Kolau.
Editor4 Intelligencer :
Some evil disposed persons hare been
for several days past industriously circu
lating & malicious report, to the effect that
I was the occasion of originating the late
strike among the coal diggers, and a cor
respondent, who signs himself "One in
ueed of Coal," endeavors in to?day*a issue
of your paper to confirm the falsehood, by
usserling that a promiuent coal merchant
had urged hi? men to stand by their com
rades. and that no coal should be dug in
bis bank until their demands were satisfied.
It Is true thnt your correspondent does not
directly allude to me, as the prominent
mercbont who is said to have urged bis
men to strike, but bis remarks taken in
connection with rumors circulated on the
streets, induces me to be believe that I may
assume that I am the one to whom he has
reference. Now I assert, without fear of
contradiction, that I had uot the slightest
intimatioo that my men had any intention
of striking until they had laid down their
tools and come out on the platform, having
been persuaded to pursue that course by a
gang of miners tbat came from Fulton.?
When I discovered that they were deter
mined to strike, f advised and urged them,
as the following certificate will abundantly
testify, to resume their work, aod I would
pay them whatever price other merchants
cousented to pay. Johh ^?olav.
Whkblisu, Dec. 1st, 18&2.
We, the undersigned Miner* lately em
ployed in John Nolan's Coal Bank, do cer
tify thai Mr. Nolan was not cognizant of
our intention to strike for higher wages
j until the strike was actually accomplished.
We further aver that ho has never told us
to stand by our comrades?that no coal
should be dog in his bank until we got
j what we demanded?on the contrary be
I urged us to contiuue at our work, but we
| did not heed bis exhortation, as we consid
ered we were old enough to judge what
was best for our own interest.

for his comfort, how grateful! Thanks to
