The President's Message.
This document, for the first time, we"
believe, in a number of years, was tele
graphed to the press of the country ver
batim, and it will be found in our (fcl
umns this morning It has one merit, &
least, that of brevity, but candor compels
us to -say that, as a S ate paper, it will;
fall short of the public anticipation
While il is straightforward, business like
and unpr; t nding, it is far from being el
evated in sentiment, and is careless1 and
awkward in its construction and in its
style, and is hardly worthy of the Chief
Magistrate of the United States on this
great occasion in our history, it opens
with the question of our foreign relation?,
and its first recommendation it Mo foitify
the lake ports and Atlantic seabo&fcdH
This is significant that some danger is
apprehended by the President from that
quarter. The President's suggestions ia
regard to acknowledging the indepen
dence of negro ilayti aud negro Liberia,
and receiving tham into tha family of iM
tions, and, if necessary, buy a tract oT
territory for th'i colonization of lha free
uegroe3 of the United States, are evident!.
ly "tubi' thrown out to the Abolition
"whale." given him, perhaps, as slight
crumbs of comfort for neglecting to recom-
mand a general emancipation scheme, in
accordance with his d:3ire3.
The P.eaien.'s general dissertation
about capital and labor will strike the
reader as bsina? out of place ru tho inc
sage, and it Will doubtless, aud very just
ly, give rise to unfriendly criticism. He
takes a hipeful and chsering view of our
difficul Lie3, which, we tru3t, will bi real
ized in the futire. If be resists the
schemes of the Abolitionists to perrert
the war into one of emancipation, and
holds it to its original purpose of a strag
gle for the Uniou, he will continue to ha-re
the support of the great ma3s of the peo
ple, which ardently desires such a blessed
lionsumrjaiion. O 1 tne whole, while tho
message is not up to our expectations, ire
expect it will frttisfy us vtiiie as wftllJMf
not better, than it does the ultra meu of
the Republican pafiy Cin. Eng.

Ii is not a great, State paper. As ryr

that Mr, Lincoln certainly wrote it him-

The homely honesty of the President
never appeared in more rugged form thau
in this message; and there are not want
ing evidences of ihai sinu'rr combina
tion of straigH forward indifTerout obsti
nacy aud almost lim jious indecision which
marks his charae e. Hij customary
plainness of speech is not in important
passages identical with clearness of e.t
pressioa. U.ifortunate j, upon the very
poiut concerting which a distinctly pro
nounced policy is demanded, by the pop
ul. ar will aud the Natiouai emergency, he
is most, obscure
VViiile it is plain, that an houest man
whose intentions are excellent, is the oc
cupant of th3 Presidenliftl chair, it is
equally clear that he brings to the aid of
the country 110 such thing as first rate .Ex
ecutive ability. We may, however con
sole ourselves, and perhaps it would.be
profitable to do so, wiih the reflection tbat
while there is ao reason to expect-any
masterly and brilliant performance on'the
part of the President, there is no dauger
that he will place the country in peril, or
cause any considerable combustion in any
quarter, by any rash :ict
Wc cannot say that we ndmire particu
larly the style in woich our foreign rela
tions are discussed. A more dignified
stand point, and a more elevated tone,
might, we think, have been assumed, in
this part of the message, without incon
venience to the '. i.i-.'i; . letrimnt'to

The recommendation for the construc
tion of a railroad to Rast Tennessee, is a
curious one. It would be a good thjng
to have a railroad in that direction, bat.
Government has ao authority to build it.
save as a military road, and there is good;
reason lo believe the war will be over be

mend the ope;;injr of tho line of the pro

There is already a road betveen.Iewis
ville and Nashville. Would it not be ll
to ooen it before building another? How
ever, ihe Kentuckians will bo ploasod at
