Senato. fick,
of the .timore
city, will introau in the
General Assembly .posing an
amendment to the Constitution
to fix the compensation of mem
bers of the two houses at $lO per
diem. If the bill passes and the
proposal is approved at the elec
tion next year, the desired in
crease will be available for mem
bars of the General Assembly of
1920. The present compensation
is $5 per diem, mileage, which in
no case exceeds S9O per annum,
and $25 for postage. Doorkeep
er receive the same compensation.
During recent sessions efforts
have been made to secure an in
crease in salaries, but no result
has followed. Mr. Frick decares
that it is impossible for a mem
ber to live in Annapolis these
days on $5 a day, a salary which
was fixed by the Constitution in
1867. He said that because of
the excess of his living expenses
over his income during the legis
lative session he is disposed to
regret that he accepted a re-elec
tion.
ARBITRATION FOR LABOR
DISPUTES
The following extract is from
President Wilson’s late message
to Congress:
Labor not only is entitled to an
adequate wage, but capital should
receive a reasonable return upen
its investment and is entitled to
protection at the hands of the
government in every emergency.
No government worthy of the
name can “play” these elements
against each other, for there is a
mutuality of interest between
them which the government must
seek to express and to safeguard
at all cost.
The right of individuals to
strike is inviolate and ought not
to be interfered with by any
process of government, but there
is a predominant right, and that
is the right of a government to
protect all of its people and to
assert its power and majesty
against the challenge of any
class.
The government, when it as
serts that right, seeks not to an
tagonize a class, but simply to
defend the right of the whole
people as against the irreparable
harm and injury that might be
done by the attempt by any class
to usurp a power that only gov
ernment itself has a right to ex
ercise as a protection to all.
In the matter of international
disputes which have led to wan
statesmen have sought to set up
as a remedy arbitration for war.
/ Does this not point the way for
the settlement of industrial dis
putes, by the establishment of a
tribunal, fair and just alike to
all, which will settle industrial
disputes which in the past have
led to war and disaster? Ameri
ca, witnessing the evil conse
quences which* have followed out
of such disputes between these
contending forces, must not ad
mit itself impotent to deal with
these matters by means of peace
ful processes.
