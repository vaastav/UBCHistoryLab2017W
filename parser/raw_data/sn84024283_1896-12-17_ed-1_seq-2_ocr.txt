The Cuban Insurrection.
The Insurrection in Cuba still continues with
mil its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive
Chat any prcgresx has thus far been made to
vsiiiii the pacification of the island or that the
-xituutiou of aSairs as depicted in my last an
nua J message has in the least improved. If
S-pain still holds Havana and the seaports and
au the considerable towns, the insurgents still
rraiu at will over at least two-thirds of the
inland country. If the determination of Spain
So put down the insurrection seems but to
wtrenethen with the lapse of time, and is evl
tencj by her unhesitating devotion o! largely
lacreaMCd military and naval fortes to the
task. there is much reason to believe
Shal the insurgents have gained in
paint of numbers and character and
veMourcea, and are none the less Inflexible In
SXieir resolve not to succumb, without prac
aieally securing the great objects for which they
ook up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established
her authority, neither have the insur
gent yet made good their title to be regarded
-M an independent state. Indeed, as the con
gest goes on. the pretense that civil govern
ment exists on the island, except so far as
.Spain U able to maintain it, has been practical
ly abandoned. Spain does keep on foot

Im toe large towns and their Immediate sub

entire country is either given over to anarchy
or fs subject to the military occupation of one
or the other party.
It Is reported. Indeed, on reliable authority,
that, ac the demand of the commander-ln-chief
of the insurgent army, the reputative
Cubaa government has now given up all at

srovernment confessedly (what there is the best
reason for supposing It always to have been In
Car.) a government merely on paper.

and decisive results might be looked for, aud

Che time during which hostilities of this sort

of protracted civil strife, the passions of the
combatants grow more and more inflamed, and
excesses on both sides become more frequent

They also are participated In by bands of
marauders, who. now in the name of one party

cseory s the insurgents, iiiamely, that the
abreocles of the contest require the wholesale

It La to the same end that in pursuance of

sad considerations of philanthropy and hu
manlty in general, have led to a vehement de
mand in various quarters for some sort of
positive intervention on the part of the United
state.
H was at first proposed that belligerent
rights should be accorded to the insurgent a
proposition ao longer urged, because untimely
anu impractical in operation snd ciearly peril
ous and ia;unous to onr own inteiesta. it has
teen and now sometimes contenced that the
independence of the insurgents should be rec
ognized. i.t imperleet and restricted as the
Spanish government of the island may be. no
other exists there unless the will of the mili
tary officer In temporary command of a par
ticular district can be tilgnihed as a species of
government. It is now aiso suggested that the
United States should buy the island a sug
gestion possibly worthy of consideration IX
there were any evidence of a desire or will
ingness on the part of Spain to entertain such
s proposal. It is urged, finally, that all other
methods failing, the existing internecine strife
in Cuba should be terminated by our interven
tion, even at the cost of a war between the
United States and St ain a war which its ad
vocates conSdcntiy prophesy could be neither
large in its proportions nor doubtful in its is
sue. 1 he correctness cf this forecast need be
neither mimed nor denied. The United
States has. nevertheless, a character to main
tain as a nation, which plainly dictates that
right and not might should be the rule cf its
conduct.
Further, though the United States is not a
nation to which peace is a necessity, it Is in
truth the most pacific-of powers, and desire
nothing so much as' to live in amity witu.u.l
the world. lis own ample and diversified do
mains satisfy all possible longings for terri
tory, preclude all dreams of conquest, and pre
vent any casting of covetous eye upon neigh
boring regions however attractive. That our
conduct towards Spain and her dominions has
constituted no exception to this national dis
position is made manifest by the course of our
government, not only thos far during the pres
ent insurrection, but daring the ten years that
followed the rising at Yara in
No other great power, it may safely be said,
under circumstances of similar perplexity,
would have manifested the sarue restraint and
the same patient endurance. It may also be
said that this persistent attitude ot the United
States toward Spain tn connection with Cuba
will unquestionably evince no slight respect
and regard for Spain on the part of the Amer
ican people. They, in truth, do not forget her
connection with the discovery of the western
hemisphere, cor do they underestimate the
great qualities of the Spanish people, nor fail
to fully recognize their splendid patriotism and
their chivalrous devotion to the national honor.
They view with wonder and admiration the
cheerful resolution with which vast bodies of
men are sent across thousands of miles of
ocean and an enormous debt accumulated, that
the costly possession of the Gem of the An
tilles may still hold its place in the Spanish
crown, and yet neither the government nor the
people of the United States have shut their
eyes to the course of events in Cuba or have
failed to realize the existence of conceded
grievances, which have led to the present re
volt from the authority of Spala grievances
recognized by the queen regent and by
the cortes, voiced by tho mr.st patriotic and
enlightened of Spanish statesmen without
regard to party, and demonstrated by reforms
proposed by the executive and approved by the
legislative branch of the Spanish government.
It Is in the assumed teniner and disposition of
the Spanish government to remedy these griev
ances, fortitled by indications of influential
public opinion in Spain, that this government
has hoped to discover the most promising and
effective meansof composing the present strife,
with honor and advantage to Spain, with the
achievement of all the reasonable objects of
the insurrection.
It would seem that if Spain should offer to
Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home
role which, while preserving the sovereignty
of fipc in., would satisfy all rational require
ments of her Spanish subjects, there should bo
no just reason hj the pacification of the is
land might not be effected on that basis. Such
a result would nppeur to be in the Interest of
all concerned. It woul.i at once stop the con
flict, which is now consuming the resources of
the island and making it worthl-s-s for which
ever party mav ultimately prevail. It
would keep intact the possessions of
Spain without touching ber honor, which
will be consulted rather than impugned by
the adequate redress of admitted grievances.
It would put the prosperity of the island and
the fortunes of its inhabitants within their
own control without severing the natural and
ancient ties which bind them to the mother
country, and would yet enable them to test
their capacity for self-government under tho
most favorable conditions.
It has been objected, on the one side, that
Spain should not promise autonomy until her
insurgent subjects lay down their arms. On
the other side, that promised autonomy, how
ever liberal, is Insuftlcient. because without
assurance of the promise being fulfilled.
But the reasonableness of a requirement by
Spain of unconditional surrender on the part
of the insurgent Cubans before their autonomy
is conceded Is not altogether apparent
It Ignores Important features of the situation
the stability two years' duration has given
to the insurrection: the feasibility of its in
definite prolongation in the nature of things,
and as shown by past experience; the utter
snd Imminent ruin of the island, unless the
present strife Is speedily composed; above all,
the rank abuses which all parties in Spain, all
t ranches of her government and all her lead
ing public men concede to exist and profess s
desire to remove.
Facing such circumstances, to withhold the
profer of needed reforms until tho parties
demanding them put themselves at mercy by
throwing down their arms, has the appearance
of neglecting the gravest of perils and invit
ing suspicion as to the sincerity of any pro
fessed willingness to grant reforms.
The objection on behalf of the insurgents
that promised reforms cun not be relied upon
must, of course, be considered, though we
have no right to assume, and no reason lor as
suming, that anything that Spain undertakes
to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done ac
cording to both the spirit and the letter of the
undertaking.
Nevertheless, realizing thnt suspicions and
precautions on the part of the weaker of two
combatants are always natural and not alwavs
unjustifiable, and being sincerely desirous in
the interest of both as well as on Its own ac
count that the Cuban problem should be solved
with the least possible deiay. it was intin ated
by this government to the government of
Spain some months ago that, if a satisfactory
measure of home rule were tendered the Cu
ban insurgent and would be ucceptcd y
tbem upon a guaranty of its execution, tho
United States would endeavor to find a way
not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such
guaranty.
While no definite response to this Intimation
has yet been received iroin the Spanish gov
ernment, it Is beileved to be not altogether
welcome while, as a treaty is suggested, v.o
reason is perceived why it should not be ap
proved by the insurgents. Neither party can
fail to see the importance of eariy action, and
both must realize that to prolong the present
state of things for even a short period will add
enormously to the time and labor and expendi
ture necessary to bring about the industrial
recuperation of the island. It Is. there
fore, fervently hoped on all grounds
that earnest efforts for healing the
breach between Spain aud the insurgent Cu
bans, upon the lines above indicated, mnv be
at once Inaugurated and pushed to an imme
diate and successful issue. The friendly of
fices of the United states, either iu the man
ner above outlined, or in any other way con
sistent with our constitution and laws, will al
ways be at the disposal of either party.
Whatever circumstances may arise, our pol
icy and our interests would t onstraln us to ob
ject to the acquisition of the Island or the in
terference with its control by any other
power.
It shculd be added that it can not be reason
ablp assumed that the hitherto expectant at
titude of the United States will be indefinitely
maintained. While we are anxious to accord
all due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we
can not view the pending conflict in all its
features snd propeify apprehend our inevitable
relations to it. and possible results, without
considering that, by the course of events, we
msy be drawn into such an unusual and un
precedented condition as will 11 x a limit to our
patient wailing for Spain to end the contest,
either alone and in her own way, or with our
friendly co-operation.
When the inability of Spain to deal success
fully with the insurrection has become mani
fest, and it is demonstrated that ber sover
eignty is extinct In Cuba for all purposes of its
rightful existence, and when a hopeless strug
gle for its re-establishment has degenerated
lntos strife which means nothing more than
the useless sacrifice of humsn life and the ot
ter destruction of the very subject matter of
the conflict, a situation will be presented In
which our obligation to the sovereignty of
Spain will be superceded by higher obligations
by which we can hardly hesitate to recognize
and discharge.
Deterring the choice of ways and methods
until the time for action arrives, we should
make tbem depend upon the precise conditions
then existing; and they shoulJ not be deter
mined upon without giving careful heed to
eveiy consideration involving our honor and
interest, or the international duty we owe to
Spain. Until we face the contingencies sug
gested or the situation is by other incidents
imperatively changed, we should continue in
the line of conduct heretofore pursued, thus in
ail circumstances exhibiting our obedience to
the requirements of public law and our regard
for the duty enjoined upon us by the position
we cccupy iu the family of nations.
A contemplation of emergencies that may
arise should plainly lead us to avoid their
creation, either through a careless disregard of
present duty or even an undue .stimulation and
ili-iimed expre.-sion of feeling. Hut 1 bave
(termed it not amiss to remind the congress
mat u time may arrive wheu a coj reel policy
tnd care for our interests. .s well as a regard
for toe interests of tuer Ri.lic.tts and ineir
citizens, joined by considerations of humanity
and a desire to see a rich and fertile countrv In
timately related to us saved from
complete devastation, ' wili constrain
our government to such action as
will subserve the interests then involved, and
at the same time promise to Ctta and its In
habitants an opportunity to cejoy the bless
ings of teace.
Tha ''(nenrlao Boondary Question.
The Venezuelan boundary Question has
ceased to be a matter of difference between
Great Britain and the United states, their re
si ective governments having isjreeJ upon the
substantial provisivns of a :realy between
threat Britain and Venezuela submitting the
whole controversy to arbitration. The pro
visions ot ihe treaty art m aouncnUy Jual and
fair mat the assent of Venesuels thereto msy
confidently be anticipated.
Negotiations for a treaty of general arbitra
tion tor all differences between Great Britain
and the United States are far advanced and
promise to reach a successful consummation at
an early date.
Examination of Coaaalar Aspirants.
The scheme of examining applicants for cer
tain consular positions to test theit compe
tency snd fitness was adopted under an execu
tive order issued on the zvth'of September,
1SV5, has fully demonstrated the usefulness of
this innovation. In connection with this plan
of examination, promotions and transfers of
deserving incumbents hav? been quite ex
tensively made, with excellent results.
Irarlng the year thirty-nve appointments
have been made in the consular service,
twenty-seven of which were made to fill
vacancies caused by death or resignation or to
supply newly-created posts, two to succeed
incumbents removed for cause, two for the
purpose of displacing alien consular officials
by American citizens, and four merely chang
ing the official title of incumbent from com
mercial agent to consul. Twelve of these
appointments were transfers or promotions
from other positions under the department of
state, four of those appointed had ren
dered previous service under the de
partment, eight were made cf Per
sons who passed s satisfactory examination,
seven were appointed to places not Included in
the order of September 0. 1, and four ap
pointments, as above stated, involved no
change of incumbency.
Inspection of Consular Offices.
The inspection of consular offices, provided
for by an appropriation for that purpose at the
last session of the congress, has been produc
tive of much wholesome effects, that I hope
this important work will in the future be con
tinued. I know of nothing that can be done
with the same slight expense so improving to
the service. I desire to repeat the recommen
dation contained In my last annual message
in favor of providing, at public expense, official
residences for our ambassadors and ministers
at foreign capitals.
The reasons supporting this recommenda
tion are strongly stated in the report ot the
secretary of state, and the subject seems of
such importance that I hope it may receive the
early attention of the congress.
t-eal l.iro In Hehring Sea
We have clnrir g the last year labored faith
fully, and against unfavorable conditions, to
secure better preservation of seal life in the
Behring sea. Both the United States and
Great Britain have lately dispatched commis
sioners to these waters to study the habits and
condition of the seal herd and the causes of
their rapid decrease. Upon the reports of
these commissioner., soon to be submitted,
and with the exercise of patience and good
sense on the part of all interested parties, it is
earnestly hoped that hearty co-operation may
be secured for the protection against the
threatened extinction of seal life in the north
ern Pacific and Behring sea.

1S'J5, amounted to 8234.iK3,so7, Including unre
deemed but fully secured notes of banks insol
vent and in process of liquidation.
Foreign Immigration.
The number of immigrants arriving in the
United States during the fiscal year was 343,
267, of whom 3,0.48 were permitted to land,
and 3.799' were debarred on various grounds
prescribed by law. and returned to the coun
tries whence they came, at the expense of the
steamship companies by which ihey were
brought in.
There arrived from Japan during the year
only 1,110 immigrants, and It is the opinion of
the immigration authorities that the appre
hension heretofore existing to some extent of
s large immigration from Japan to the United
States is without any substantial foundation.
Tha Llfa-avlig Hervtce.
From the life-saving service it is reported
that the number of disasters to documented
eiels within the limits of Its operations dur
Irg tne year was 437. These vessels had on
board 4.608 persons, of whom 4,545 were saved
and 13 lost. The value of such vessels is esti
mated st 83.880,140. and of their cargoes $3,846,
380, making the total value of property Imper
iled $12,726,520. Of this amount $11. CV2.707 was
saved snd $1,432,750 was lost. Sixty-seven of
the vessels were totally wrecked. There were,
besides. 243 casualties to small undocumented
craft, on board of which there were 694 persons,
of which 587 were saved snd seven were lost.
The Marine Hospital Mervloe, Etc -
The operations of the marine hospital serv
ice, the revenue cutter service, the steamboat
Inspection service, the lighthouse service, the
bureau of navigation, snd other branches of
public work attached to the treasury depart
ment, together with various recommendations
concerning their support and improvements,
are fully stated in the report of the secretary
of the treasury, to which the attention of the
congress is especially invited.
THE WAR DEPARTMENT.
Satisfactory Conditions Shown.
The report of the secretary of war exhfblts
satisfactory conditions in the several branches
of the public servtee intrusted to his charge.
Ihe limit of our military force, as iixeo by
law. is consta- tly and readily maintained. The
present discipline and morale of our army are
excellent, and marked progress and efficiency
are apparent throughout its entire organiza
tion. With the exception ef eTeltcate duties in the
suppression t si gbt Jinlii-n disturbances
alung our souih'-vc-.ern boundary, in which
the Mexican troops co-operated, and the com.
pulsory but peaceful return, with the consent
of Great Britain, cf a band of Cree Indians
from Montana to the British possessions, no
active crperatUns have been required of the
army during the year past-
changes iu n-ethods of administration, the
abandonment f unnecessary posts and conse
quent concentration of troops, and the exer
cise of care and vigilance by the various offi
cers charged with the responsibility in the ex
penditure of tha appropriations have resulted
in reducing to u minimum the cost ot mainte
nance of our military establishment. During
the past year the work of construction of per
manent infantry and cavalry posts has been
continued at the places heretofore designated.
The secretary of war repeats his recommenda
tloa that syprsprlaUos far barracks sad a.aa
ters snonia more strictly conform to Che needs
of the service as jndged by the department
rather than respond to the wishes snd impor
tunities ot localities. .
It is imperative that much of the money pro
vided for such constructions should now be
allotted to the erection of necessary quarters
for the garrisons assigned to the coast de
fenses, where many men will be needed to
properly care for and cperate modern guns. It
is essential, too. that early provision be made
to supply the necessary force of artillery to
meet the demands of this service.
The entire army has now been equipped with
new magazine arms, snd wise policy demands
thst all available publio and private resources
should be so employed as to provide, within a
reasonable time, a sufficient number to supply
the state militia with these modern weapons
and provide an ample reserve for any emer
gency. The Organised Militha.
The organized militia numbers 112.879 men.
The appropriations for its support by the sev
eral states approximate s2.8U0.ti00 annually,
and f400.0o0 is contributed by the general gov
ernment. Investigation shows these troops
to be usually well drilled and inspired with
much military Interest, but in many instances
they are so deficient in proper arms and equip
ment that a sudden call to active duty would
find them inadequately prepared for field
service. I therefore recommend that prompt
measures be taken to remedy this condition,
and that every encouragement be given to this
oeserving body ot unpaid and voluntary citi
zen soldiers, upon whose assistance we must
largely rely In time of trouble.
Onr Coast Defenses.
During the past year rapid progress has been
made toward the completion of the scheme
adopted for the erection and armament of
fortifications along our sea coast, while equal
progress has been made in providing the ma
terial for submarine defense in connection
with these works.
This improved situation Is largely due to the
recent generous response ot congress to the
recommendations of the war department.
Thus we shall soon have complete about one
fifth of the comprehensive system, the first
step in which was noted in my message to the
contrress cf December 4, 189X
The experience and res,ult of the past year
demonstrate that with a continuation of pres
ent careful methods the cost of the remaining
work will be much less than the original esti
mate. We should always keep in mind that of
all forms of military preparation coast de
fense alone s essentially pacific in its nature.
While it gives the sense of security due to a
consciousness of strength, it is neither the
purpose nor the effect of such permanent forti
fication to involve us in complications, but
rather to guarantee us against them. They are
no temptation to war, but security against it.
Thus they are thoroughly in accord with all
the traditions of our national diplomacy.
D EPA HTM EN T OF JUSTICE.
Government Penitentiaries.
The attorney general presents a detailed and
interesting statement of the important work
done under his supervision during the last
fiscal year. The ownership and management
by the government of cenitentiaries for the
confinement of the convicted in United States
courts of violations of federal laws, which for
many years has been a subject ot executive
recommendation, has at last, to a slight ex
tent, been realized by the utilization of
the abandoned military prison at Fort
Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary.
This is certainly a movement in the right
direction; but it ought to be at once supple
mented by the rebuilding or extensive enlarge
ment of this improvished prison, and the con
struction of at least one more, to be located in
the southern states.
The New Salary System.
It is most gratifying to note the satisfactory
results that have followed the inauguration of
the new system provided for by the act of
May "8. 1890, under which certain federal offi
cials are compensated by salaries instead of
fees. The new plan was put in operation on
the first day of July. 1896, and already the
great economy it enforces, its prevention of
abuses and its tendency to a better enforce
ment of the laws are strikingly apparent. De
tailed evidence of the usefulness of this long
delayed but now happily-accomplished re
form will he found clearly &et forth in the at
torney general's report.
POST OFFICE DEPAKT3IENT.
Its Operations During the Past Tear.
Our post office department is in good condi
tion and the exhibit made of its operations
during the fiscal year, ended June 30, 1896. if
allowance is made for imperfections in the
laws applicable to it, is very satisfactory. The
total receipts during the year were $82.499.08.
40. The total expenditures were $90.626,i96.84,
exclusive of $l,.Va.K9!'.27. which was earned by
the Pacific railroad for transportation, and
credited on their debt to the government
There was an increase of receipts over the
previous year of $.i,516,io.21, or 7.1
per cent, and an increase of expendi
ture of $3,836,124.02. or 4.42 per cent.
The deficit was $1,679,956.19 less than that of
the preceding year.
Abase of the Service.
The transmission at the rate of one cent a
pound of serial libraries, advertising sheets,
"house organs" (periodicals advertising some
paitlcular "house" or Institution), sample
copies, and the like, ought certainly to be dis
continued. A glance at the revent es received
for the work done last year will show more
plainly than any other statement the gross
abuse of the postal service and the growing
waste of its earnings.
The free matter carried in the mails for the
departments, offices, etc., of the government
and for congress in pounds amount to 94.48J,
189. Corrective Legislation Recommended.
If such second-class matter paid merely the
cost of its handlingour deficit would disappear
and a surplus result, which might be used to
give the people still better mail facilities or
cheaper rates of letter postage. I recommend
that legislation be at once enacted to correct
these abuses and introduce better business
ideas in the regulation of our postal rates.
Universal Postal Union.
The Universal Postal union, which now em
braces all the civilized world, and whose dele
gates will represent l,0oo.CO0,ibO people, will
hold its fifth congress in the city of Washing
ton in May, 1897.
In view of the importance of this assem
bluge and of its deliberations, and of the hon
ors and hospitalities accorded to our repre
sentatives by other countries on similar occa
sions, I earnestly hope that such an appropri
ation will be made for the expenses necessa
rily attendant upon the coming meeting in our
capital city, as well be worthy of our na
tional hospitality and indicative ot our appre
ciation of the event.
THE NAVY DEPAETMENT.
Construction of Oar New Navy.
The work of the navy department and its
present conditions are fully exhibited in the
report of the secretary. Ihe construction of
vessels for our new navy has been energetic
ally prosecuted by the present administration
upon the general lines previously adopted, the
department having seen no necessity for radi
cal charges in prior methods under which the
work was found to be progressing in a manner
highly satisfactory. It has been decided, how
ever, to provide in every ship-building con
tract that the builder should pay all trial ex
penses, and it has also been determined to pay
no speed premiums in future contracts.
The premiums recently earned and some yet
to be decided are features of tne contracts
made before this conclusion was reached.
On March 4. 18911, there were iu commission
but two armored vessels, the double-turreted
monitors Wiantonomoh and Monterey. Since
that date, ot vessels .'theretofore authorized,
there have been placed In their first commis
sion three first-cioss and two second-class bat
tleships, two armored cruisers, one
harbor-defense ram. - and five double
turreted monitors, including the Maine
and the Puritan. just completed.
Eight new unarmored cruisers acd two new
gunboats have also been commissioned. The
Iowa, another battleship, will be completed
about March 1, and at least four more gunboats
will be ready for sea la the early spring.
Tha Mar College.
The war college has developed into an insti
tution which it is believed will be of great
value to the navy, in teaching the science of
war as well as in stimulating professional zeal
In the navy, and it will be especially useful la
the devising of plans for the utilization, in
case of necessity, of all the naval resources of
the United States. The secretary has 'per
sistently adhered to the plan be found in oper
ation for securing labor at navy yards, through
boards of labor employment, aud has done
much to make it more complete aad efficient.
Discipline In tn- Hervlce. '
Discipline among the ofi.ers and men of the
navy has been maintained to a high standard,
and the percentage of American c.tizens en
listed has been very much increased.
The secretary is considering, and will formu
late during the coming winter, a plan for lay
ing up ships In reserve, thereby largely reduc
ing the cost of maiutaimng our vessels aiioat.
Tli Naval Mllltla.

INTEKIOM DEPARTMENT.
ErmniM Dlobarvemen'a.
The report of the secretary of the Interior
presents a comprehensive and interesting ex
hibit of the numerous and important aliairs
committed to his supervision. It is impossible
in this communication to more than briefly
refer to a few of the sub
jects concerning which the secretary
gives full snd instructive information.
The money appropriated on account of this
department, aud for its disbursement for the
fiscal year ended Juita 10, s96, amounted to
dots than $1&7 OUO.uQu, or ft grcaajr sua than
was appropriated for the entire maintenance
of the government for the two fiscal years
ended June SO. lsei.
Tha Fablia Domain.
Oar public lands, originally amounting to
1 .840. COM acres, have been so reduced that only
about 60u.000.00vt acres still remain in govern
ment control, excluding Alaska. - The bal
ance, being by far the most valuable portion,
baa been given away to settlers, to new states
and to railroads, or sold at a comparatively
nominal sum.
National Fen try System.
The commission appointed from the mem
bership of the National academy of sciences,
provided for by an act of congress to formulate
plans for a national forestry system, will, it Is
bGped. soon be prepared to present the result
ot thorough and intelligent examination of this
important subject. -
Onr Indian Wards.
The total Indian population ot the United
States is 177.2&, according to a census made in
U95. exclusive of those within the state of
New York and those comprising the five civil
ized tribes. Of this number there are approx
imately 38 000 children of school age. During
the year 3.593 of these were enrolled and may
be in schools. The progress wnich has attend
ed recent efforts to extend Indian school facil
ities, snd the anticipation of continued liberal
sppropriatians to that end, can not fail to
afford the utmost satisfaction to those who be
lieve that the education of Indian children Is
a prime factor in the accomplishment of In
dian civilization.
Tbe Five Civilised Tribes.
The condition of affairs among the five civil
ized tribes, who cecupy large tracts of land in
the Indian territory, and who have govern
ments ot their own, has assumed such an as
pect as to render it almost indespensable that
there should be an entire change in the rela
tions of these Indians to the general govern
ment. This seems to be necessary in further
ance of their own interests, as well as for the
protection of non-Indian residents In their ter
ritory. A commission organized and em
powered under several recent laws is now
negotiating with these Indians for the
relinquishment of their courts and the di
vision of their common lands in severalty,
and are aiding in the settlement of the trouble
some question of tribal membership. The
reception of their first proSers of negotiation
was not encouraging, but through patience and
such conduct on their part as demonstrated
that their intentions were friendly, and in tne
interest of the tribes, the prospect of success
has become more promising.
Utah Gllsonlte Deposits.
It appears that a very valuable deposit of
gilsonite or asphaltum has been found on the
reservation in Utah occupied by the Uncom
paghre Ute Indians. Every consideration of
care for the public interest, and every sensible
business reason, dictate such management or
disposal of this important source of public
revenue as will except it from the general
rules and incidents attending the ordinary dis
position of public lands and secure to the gov
ernment a fair share, at least, of its advantages
in place of its transfer for a nominal sum to in
terested individualism.
A Permanent Indian Commission.
I indorse the recommendation made by the
present secretary of the interior, as well as
his predecessor, that a permanent commission,
consisting of three members, one of whom
shall be an army officer, be created to perform
the duties now devolving upon the commis
sioner and assistant commissioner of Indian
affairs.
The Pension Kolh
The diminution of our enormous pension roll
and the decrease of pension expenditure which
have been so often confidently foretold still fail
in material realization. The number of pen
sioners on tbe roll at the close of the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1896, was 970,678. This is
the largest number ever reported. The amount
paid exclusively for pensions during the year
was $138,214,761.94, a slight decrease from that
of the preceding year, while tho total expendi
tures on account of pensions, including the
cost of maintaining the department and
expenses attending pension distribution,
amounted to $142,2U6,tf.0.n, or within a very
small fraction of one-third of the entire ex
pense of supporting the government during
the same year. The number of new pension
certificates issued was 90.610. Ot these 40.374
represent original allowance of claims, and 15,
878 increases of exlsiting pensions. The num
ber of persons receiving pensions from the
United States.but residing in foreign countries
at the close of the last fiscal year, was 3,781,
and the amount paid to tbem during the year
was $-")82.735.38. The sum appropriated for the
payment of pensions for tho current fiscal
year, ending June ;0, 1897. is $140,000,000. and
for the succeeding year it is estimated that the
same amount will be necessary.
The commissioner of pensions reports that
during the last fiscal year 33j indictments were
found against violators of the pension laws.
Upon these indictments 167 couvictlons re
sulted. Pacific Ballroad Obligations.
The secretary calls attention to the public
Interests involved in an adjustment of the ob
ligations of the Pacific railroads to the govern
ment. I deem it to be an important duty to
especially present this subject to the consider
tlon of the congress.
Under section 4 of the act of congress passed
March 3. 1887, the president is charged with
the duty in the event that any mortgage or
other incumbrance paramount to the interest
of tne United States in the property of the
Pacific railroads shall cxist aud be lawfully
liable to be foreclosed, to direct the action of
the deoartments of the treasury snd of justice
In the protection of Abe Interest of the United
States by redemption or through judicial pro
ceedings, including foreclosures of the gov
ernment Hens. In view of the fact that the
congress has for a number of years almost
constantly had under consideration various
p.ans for dealing with the conditions existing
between these roads and tbe government. I
have thus far felt justified in withholding ac
tion under the statute above mentioned.
An Urgent Siluaiion.
In the case of the Union Pacific company,
however, the case has become especially and
Immediately urgent. Proceedings have been
instituted to foreclose a first mortgage upon
these aided parts cf the main lines upon
which the government holds a second and
subordinate mortgage lien. In consequence of
these proceedings and increasing complica
tions, added to the default occurring on the
first day ot January, 19", a condition will be
presented at that date, so far as this company
is concerned, that must emphasize the man
date ot the act of 1887 and give to executive
duty under its provisions a more important
aspect. I
'l here fore, unless congress shall otherwise
direct or shall have previously determined
upon a different solution of the problem there
will harcly appear to exist any reason for de
laying, beyond tbe date of the default above
mentioned, such executive action as will prom
ise to subserve tbe public interests and save
the government from the loss threatened by
further inaction.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
Worthy of Constant Care and Euconraga
znenc The department of agriculture is so inti
mately related to the welfare of our people and
the prosperity of our nation that it
should constantly receive the care
and encouragement of tbe government.
From a small beginning it has grown to be
the center ot agricultural intelligence and the
source of aid and encouragement to agricul
tural efforts. .Large sums of money are an
nually appropriated for the maintenance of
this department, and It must be confessed that
the legislation relating to it has always been
directea iu the interest of practical farming or
properly guarded against waste and extrava
gance. So far. however, as public money has
been appropriated fairly and sensibly to help
those who actually till the soil, no expenditure
has been more profitably made or more gener
ally approved by the people.
Exports of Farm Prodaeta.
The secretary reports that the value of our
exports of farm products during tbe last fiscal
year amounted to $57ii,00O,00O, an increase of
I7.'.00.(0 over those of the year immediately
preceding.
This statement is not the le? s welcome be
cause of the fact that.notwithstandingsucn in
crease, the proportion of exported agricultural
products to our total exports of all descrip
tions feil off during the year, 'ihe benefits of
an increase in agricultural products being as
sured, the decrease in its proportion to our
total export is the more gratifying when we
consider teat it is owing to the fact that such
total exports for the year increased more than
$75,0U).0uC.
ir ami tons Distribution of Beads.
In my opinion the gratuitous distribution of
seeds by tbe department, as st present con
ducted, ought to be discontinued. No one can
re d tbe statement of the secretary on this
subject snd doubt tbe extravagance and ques
tionable results of this practice, 'ihe pro
fessed friends of the farmer, and certainly the
farmers themselves. -re naturally expected to
be willing to rid a department devoted to the
promotion of farming interests of a feature
which tends so much to its discredit.
Tbe Weather Uartao, a
The weather bureau, now attached to the de
partment of agriculture, has continued to ex
tend its sphere of usefulness, and by an unin
terrupted improvement in the accuracy of its
forecasts has great- increased its efficiency
as an aid and protection to all whose occupa
tions are related to weather conditions.
CIVIU-SEKV1CK REFORM.
A Cause for Congratulation.
The progress made In civil-service reform

- xater-Htata count:
The inter-stat commerce commission eas
during the fast year, supplied abundant evi
dence of its usefulness aad the Importance of
the work committed to its charge. Pnblio
transportation is a universal necessity, and
the question of just and reasonable charges
therefor has become of vital importance, not
only to shippers and carriers, but also to tha
vast multitude of producers and consumers.
The justice and equity of the principles em
bodied in the existing law passed for the pur
pose of regulating these charges are every
where conceded, and there appears to be no
question that the policy, thus entered upon,
has a permanent place in our legislation. As
the present statute, wnen enacted, was, in the
nature of the case, more or less tentative and
experimental, it was hardly expected to apply
a complete and adequate system. While its
wholesome effects are manifest, and having
amply justified its enactment, it is evident
that all desired reforms in transportation
methods have not been fully accomplished, -a
In view of the judicial interDretation which
some provisions of this statute have received
and tbe defects disclosed by the efforts made
for its enforcement, its revision and amend
ment appear- to be essential, to the end that it
may more effectually reach the evils designed
to be corrected. I hope the recommendations
of the commission upon this subject will be
promptly and favorably considered by the con
gress. TDK TARIFF QUESTION.
Suggestions Touching the Present Lavs
and Its Operations.
I desire to recur to the statements elsewhere
made concerning the government's receipts
and expenditures for the purpose of venturing
upon some suggestions touching our present
tariff law and its operation.
This statute took effect on the 28th day of
August, 1894. Whatever may be its shortcom
ings as a complete measure of tariff reform, it
must be conceded that it has opened the way
to a freer and greater exchange of commodi
ties between the United States and other
countries, and thus furnished a wider market
for our produots and manufacturers. The only
entire fiscal year during which this law has
been enforced ended on the 30th day of June,
1896. In that year our imports increased over
those of the previous year more than $6,500,000,
while the value of domestic products we ex
ported, and which found markets abroad, was
nearly $70,000,000 more than during the pre
ceding year.
Those who insist that the cost to our people
of articles eoaiing to tbem from abroad for
their needful use should only be increased
through tariff charges to an extent necessary
to meet the expenses of the government, as
well as those who claim that tariff charges
may be laid upon such articles beyond the
necessities of government revenue.and with the
additional purpose of so increasing their price
in our markets as to give American manufac
turers and producers better and more profita
ble opportunities, must agree that our tariff
laws are only primarily justified as sources of
revenue to enable the government to meet the
necessary expenses of Its maintenance. Con
sidered as to its sufficiency in this aspect, the
present law can by no means fall under just
condemnation. During tbe only complete
fiscal year of its operation it has yielded near
ly t8,000,0i0 mere revenue than was received
from tariff duties in the preceding year. There
was, nevertheless, a deficit between our re
ceipts and expenditures of a little more than.
825,000.000. This, however, was not unexpected.
The situation was such in December last, seven
months before the close of the fiscal year, that
the secretary of the treasury foretold a defi
ciency of $17,000,000.
The great and increasing apprehension and
timidity in business circles, and the depression
in all activities intervening since that time, re
sulting from causes perfectly well understood
and entirely disconnected with our tariff law
or Its operation, seriously checked the imports
we would have otherwise received, and readily
account for the difference between this
estimate of the secretary and the actual
deficiency, as well as for a continued
deficit. Indeed, it must be confessed that we
could hardly have had a more unfavorable pe
riod than the last two years for the collection
of tariff revenue. We can not reasonably hope
that our recuperation from this business de
pression will be sudden, but it has already set
In with a promise of acceleration and continu
ance. I believe our present tariff law, if al
lowed a fair opportunity, win, in the near fu
ture, yield a revenue which, with reasonably
economical expenditures, will overcome all de
ficiencies. Need Not Excite or Disturb Us.
In the meantime no deficit that has occurred
or may occur need excite or disturb us. To
meet any such deficit In the treasury, in addi
tion to s gold reserve of $1 0,000,000, s surplus
ot more than $128,000,000 applicable to the pay
ment of the expenses of the government, and
which must, unless expended for that purpose,
remain a useless hoard; or. if not extravagant
ly wasted, must in any event be perverted from
the purpose of its exaction from our people.
The payment, therefore, of any deficiency in
the revenue from this fnnd is nothing more
than its proper and legitimate use.
A Matter of Supreme Importance.
I suppose it will not be denied that under
the present law our people obtain the neces
saries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper
rate than formerly. This is a matter of supreme
importance, since it is the palpable duty of
every just government to make the burdens of
taxation as light as possible. The people
should not be required to relinquish this
privilege of cheaper living except under tbe
stressor their government's necessity made
plainly manifest.
OCR FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
Weakness and Vices of Oar Present
Method.
This reference to the conditions snd pros
pects of our revenues naturally suggests an
allusion to the weakness and vices of our finan
cial method. They have been frequently
pressed upon tbe attention of congress in
previous communications and the inevitable
danger of their continued toleration pointed
out. Without now repeating these details, I
can not refrain from again earnestly present
ing the necessity of the prompt reform of a
system opposed to every rule of sound finance
and shown by experience to be fraught with
the gravest peril and perplexity.
Withdrawals -f Gold Obligations.
Because we may be enjoying a temporary re
lief from its depressing influence, this should
not lull us into a false security, nor lead us to
forget the suddenness of past visitations. I am
more convinced than ever that we can have
no assured financial pence and safety until tha
government currency n' .igations upon which
gold may be demanded i i oin the treasury are
withdrawn from c.i elation and cancelled.
This might be done, as has been heretofore
recommended, by their exchange for long
term bonds bearing a low rat; of interest or
by their redemption with the proceeds of such
bonds.
This plan of issuing bonds for the purpose of
redemption certainly appears to be tbe most
effective and direct path to tbe needed reform.
In default of this, however, it would be a step
in tbe right direction if currency obligations,
redeemable in gold whenever so redeopiod,
should be cancelled instead of reissued. Tills
operation would be a slow remedy, but it would
improve present conditions.
National Hank Notes.
National banks should redeem their own
notes. They should be allowed to Issue circu
lation to the par value of bonds deposited as
security for redemption, and tbe tax on their
circulation should be reduced to one-fourth of
one percent.
In considering projects for the retirement of
the United States notes and treasury notes is
sued under the new law of 1890.1 am of the
opinion we have placed too much stress upon
the danger of contracting the currency and
have calculated too little upon the gold that
would be added to our circul .tion if invited to
us by better and safer financial methods. It is
not so much contraction of our currency that
should be avoided as its unequal distribution.
The entire case may be presented by the
statement that the day of sensible and sound
financial methods will not dawn upon us until
our government absndons the banking busi
ness and the accumulation ot funds, and con
fines its monetary operations to the receipt of
the money contributed by the people for its
support, and the expenditure of such money
for the people's benerit:Our business interests
and all good citizens long for rest from fever
ish agitation, and the Inauguration by the
government of a reformed financial policy
which will encourage enterprise and make
certain the rewards of labor and Industry.
MONOPOLY.
Trust and Other Aggregations of Capital.
Another topic In which our people rightfully
take a deep interest may be here briefly con
sidered. I refer to tbe existence of trusts and
other huge aggregations of capital, the object
of which is to secure tbe monopoly of some
particular branch of trsde. Industry or com
merce, and to stifle wholesome competition.
When these are defended it is usually on the
ground that, though they increase prices, tbey
also reduce price, and thus may benefit the
public. It must be remembered, however, that
a reduction of prices to tbe people is not one of
the real objects ot these organizations, nor is
their tendency necessarily in that direction.
If it occurs in a particular case it Is only be
cause it accords with the purposes or interests
of those managing the scheme.
Though congress has attemped to deal with
this matter by legislation, the laws passed for
that purpose thus far have proved ineffective,
not because of any lack of disposition or at
tempt to enforce them, but simply because the
laws then-selves, as interpreted by tbe courts,
do not reach the difficulty, if tbe insufficiencies
of existing laws can be remedied by .further
legislation, it should be done.
An Appeal fr Kronomy.
In concluding this communication, its last
words sha,l be an appeal to the congress for
the most rid economy in the expenditure of
the money it holds in trust for the people.
The way to perplexing extravagance is easy,
but a return to frugality Is difficult. When,
however, it is considered that those who bear
the burdens of taxation have guaranty of
honest care save in the fidelity of their pub
lic servants, the duty of all possible retrerch
ment Is plainly manifest.
When our differences are forgotten, and cur
contests of political opinion, are no longer re
membered, nothing in the retrospect cf onr
public service will be as fortunate and comforting-
as the recollection of official duty well
performed, and the memory of a constant de
votion to the interests of our confiding fellow
countrymen. Gaovxa CLevs-JJitt.

Love is the sun
woman's life. Its
dawnins; is the
maiden's tender
sentiment: it bright-'
ens into the steady
affection of the con
tented wife, and
reaches its glorious noontide in the happy
mother. Happy motherhood is a true wo
man's loftiest ambition. Her highest pride
is in her fitness to fulfill this grand and
sacred destiny. Nothing so clouds and
darkens her existence as to be incapaci
tated for this noblest of womanly functions
Tby weakness or disease.
A woman who suffers from any ailment of
the delicate special organism of her sex,
feels something more than pain and physi
cal wretchedness. She is mortified with a
sense of womanly incompleteness.
But no woman need remain under this
cloud of misery and dissatisfaction. Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription positively
cures all diseased conditions and weak
nesses, and restores complete health and
strength to the feminine organs.
It is the only medicine ef its kind devised
for this one purpose by an educated and ex
perienced physician, snd eminent epecislist
in this particular field of practice.
It is the only medicine which can be relied
upon to make the ordeal of motherhood
absolutely safe and almost painless.
" I cannot say too much for Dr. Pierce's Favor
ite Prescription," writes Miss Clara Balrd, of
Bridgeport, Montgomery Co., Fenn'a. " I feel it
my duty to say to ail women who may be suffer
ing from any disease of the womb that it is tbe
best medicine on earth for them to use. I cannot
praise it too highly for the good it did me. If
any one doubts this give them my name and
address."
