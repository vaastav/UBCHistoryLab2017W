WHEELING, DECEMBER 0, 11)00.
Redistricting me Stato.
One of the most Important and, at
the same time, delicate duties that will
devolve upon the next legislature, will
be the redisricting of the state for legislative
and congressional purposes, and
the Intelligencer commends the sound
and conservative views of Senator-elect
Thomas E. Davis, of Grafton, publish
cd In another column, to the refloctlve
consideration of tho Republican membora
of the legislature. Mr. Davis'
ideas coincide In many features with
the Intelligencer In regard to the redisricting
of tho state, In this: that
we should not follow the precedent set
by the outrageous gerrymander made
by the Democrats. They sought by an
outlandish and wholly unconstitutional
method to make the state secure for the
Democratic party for years to come, by
forming delegate districts whereby they
disfranchised a number of citizens. How
well they wore punished for this partisan
legislation Is too well known. Any
reprisals of a similar character on the
part of the Republicans we believe will
meet the same fate.
air. Davi3' suggestion that each county
should be entitled to a member of
the house of delegates Is both rational
and Just, and while it would increase
the membership of the house thirteen
the state can well afford to stand It In
a spirit of fairness and equality. Inasmuch
as the membership of the house
has already been Increased seven and
the senate two since the formation of
the state, this Is not asking too much,
as the population now numbers close on
to 1,000,000. The Republican party in
the light of the last election, can afford
to be generous and fair without In any
manner weakening Its hold on the people.
To be rankly partisan would most
undoubtedly lessen the confidence of the
p topic.
As to the Congressional districts, Mr.
Davis is of the opinion that they should
be let alone. They were arranged by
the DemOP-rntR tn nurnnhinti* ?hf* nnu.nt.
of that party, but the results in November
show that the shrewdest politician
io prone to mistakes. The additional
member of Congress that West Virginia
will be entitled to under the reapportionment,
can veil be made, as Mr.
Davis intimates, a Congressman-atlarge.
France's Frenzy.
General Herder's incendiary speech in
the French senate, which virtually advocates
an Invasion of England by
France, was not only ill-timed but ridiculous.
The ancient enmity of that nation
against Great Britain seems to
liave been stirred up by the visit of
Kruger, and In remembering his sorrows
the Faahoda Incident was vividly
recalled. But it appears that General
Mercler desires more than anything
else to rehabilitate himself for his
shameful perjury in the Dreyfus case;
ho wants to accent his patriotism at the
expense of the happiness of France, for
his proposed invasion of Albion Is not
only preposterous but convulsively humorc'us.
Is it possible that Mcrcler has
forgotten Waterloo and Sedan? If he'
has, by what fatuity has he been led to
make an ass of himself?
Just now when Kurope Is making
every effort to compose Itself In peace
this bird of ill-omen Haps Its wings and
casts a shadow over the peaceful vista.
Mercler's flighty scheme Is not to be
wondered at. Feverish as the French
people are they are not wild cnuugh to
make such a dlsustrous plunge us Mercler
would lead them.
Heal Attitudo o* tho South.
The remarks of General John D. Gordon,
at tho Industrial convention, In
session at New Orleans, and chronicled
In yesterday's pr.-ss dispatches, Is a
verltablo voice crying nut from the wilderness.
General Gordon has done
more, perhaps, than any other south*erner,
asRoelated with the Lost Cause to
bring about a rcappronchment between
the north nnd the Houth. Ills lectures
In tho north woro educational, while his
voice lifted up In the south ha? been |
forever sinking a nong of peacc and
eternal urnlty between tho onco warring I
sections, and his expressions at New |
Orleans should be taken as representing
that vnst body la the southern
states that Ir gradually swinging around
to tho policies advocated by the ttepubllcan
party, but which Is deterred from
a practical demonstration of Us sympathy
by uniurtunato local conditions
No better nepubllcan npeech was over
mado than when General Gordon saldi
"Whatever the people of tho south liavn
been In favor of In tho past, they are
no longer In favor of a narrow or con*
tracted national policy. They are In
favor of the Nicaragua canal, of tho
open door In tho Orient, or carrying t
their blessings to the benighted brown 1
peoples or tho east, who, some day, will t
rise up and shout load hosannas to God
that tho ilng of the Star* and Stripes
bad been admitted among them." t
May thwe eloquent wonin foreshadow
tho day wjhen the south, rid of Its boso
and sectional politicians, will unite with r

the advantages this country enjoys,
and continuing the blessings vouch- B

The New York Times speaks very dls- j
couraglngly of the future utility of na- *
tural gas;.as fuel In place of coal, and 1
quotes daifQk gathered and compiled for j
the 1900 wjjort of the United States n
geographical survey, which show that, t
"while stllJ a factor of local Importance *
In a few industries, and a domestic convenience
wherever available, natural
gas is giving out. The amount utilized c
In 1899 Is estimated at about 108,000,000,- <j
000 oublc gect. In calorific value this J
wus equivalent to about 4,062,628 tons of f
coal. To inalntaln this supply longer \
than another year or two will Involve *
opening new fields and extending, shift- t
Ing, and enlarging thousands of miles t
of piping. There has been a necessary 1
Increase In the charge to consumers,
owing to diminishing pressure and the v
necessltyjfor pumping the gas through r,
long lines. Such increase tends to check s
lta consumption for industrial purposes. ?
With every advance beyond the very CR
low price at which it was originally fl
sold, a good many large consumers re- t
turned to coal, and found a substantial
economy In doing so." 3
While the supply may be giving out
In other states, West Virginia has c
plenty and some to spare, but should It
ever give out In this state we have the ?
coal in abundance, and the failure of 1
the gas supply would Increase tho activities
of the mine and add to the bet- [
torment of Industrial conditions. 3a
speaking of the comparative value of
gas with coal, the Times says: ?
It was never a chcap fuel, and at Its E
present average price It cannot be used 1
with economy In any operation for which
coal Is available. Natural pas In corn- ,
plcto combuBtlon give* off 1.053.274 hent 1
units per 1,000 cubic feet. A pound of c
bituminous coal oC average quality will t
liberate In completo combustion about 14,- 1
000 heat units. Wo may assume, therefore,
that 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas
nro theoretically equal In calorHlo val.ie
to about 75 pounds of coal. At ?2 W per
net ton, which Is considerably more than .
the average price of bituminous coal where 1
It comes Into competition with natural "J
gas, It costs one-eighth of a cent per n
pound. Consequently the coal to equal J
1,000 cubic feot of natural gas Is worth <j
less than 10 cents. In practice, however, t
natural gas has not maintained In com- 1
petition with coal Its theoretical compnr- a
ntlvo value. Tests made at Pittsburgh f
under perfectly fair conditions showed \
that, as compared with coal at $2 00 per
ton, natural Kaa in steam evaporation was c
worth only 0.8 cents per thousnnd. At T,
tho present average price of lSn.A cents per 1
thousand, It Is about on a parity with lil- 8
tumlnous coal at J5 per ton, or, nay, twicc t
the present average cost of the best steam 1
coal In the natural gas district. t

Tlio Gold Standard.
One of the menaces of Bryan's election
was the possibility of his destruction
of the gold standard through loop-holes (
In the present law. A secretary of the t
treasury Inimical to the present flnan- a
clal system of the government, It was I
found, coulJ negative all the benefits 1
accruing to the country to-day by sll- (
vcrlzlng the money. Secretary Gage, In
his annual report of the condition of the 1
treasury, points out these flaws and ^
there Is no doubt that Congress, at the
earliest moment, .will address Itself to 1
making the barrier to any Invasion of 1
the gold standard system by the sliver
men "pig tight."
The Louisville Courier Journal com- c
mentlng on the doubling of the gold sup- 'j
ply of the United States since 1S9G, In
wiuuauiK irura in uiai year c
to 31*100,000,000 December 1 of this year, ^
says:
"These figures, wonderful as they are, ~
are strikingly significant when taken in
connection with the predictions of the
free silver men in 1S98 that the operation
of the gold standard was depriving
the country of Its supplies of precious ^
metal. Mr. Altgeld made a speech In
September of that year in which he declared
that not $200,000,000 of gold could S
be found In the United States, and that
all of it would noon be on its way to j
Europe. This prediction was made In (
the same speech In which the governor
taunted the farmers with the fact that
there was a shortage in the world's
wheat crop, but the price could not advance
under the gold standard. The
same, or practically the same, asser- v
tlona were made by the other free silver n
leaders.in connection with the price of
cotton. As If to twit Governor AUgekl
and the other prophets of 111, the wheat j
market began to advance at once, and I
never stopped climbing until Letter sent *
It up to $2 a bushel while silver was at j1
the lowest point ever reached. Now we \
have ten-cent cotton."
\
It Is possible that Charles A. Townc,
candidate for vice president on the Pop- r
ullst ticket, and afterwards spurned by ^
the ratification convention at Kansas ^
City, may break Into the United States
senate by appointment of Governor
Llnd, of Minnesota. It will only be for
a few months, however.
The German press affect to believe
that ' President McKInley's message
gives evidence of a certain coolness to- H
wards that country. Cut out the meat c
inspection and wo may be happy yet. J
