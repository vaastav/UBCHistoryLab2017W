HIS IEIDESOENOB DOES HOT ADOBE
THE MILLION CLUB.
Snowbound Somewhere Up In Wisconsin
the Oration of the Evening Is Not
Heard where the Representatives or
Kansas Send Forth Her Praises Barton
U There, Hovrevcr Governor Morrill
Presents to the Chlcagoans the Unriv
aled Career of the Sunflower State and
Her Boundless Resources.
Chicago, Dec 2. Kansas greeted Chi
cago tonight. The speakers of the
evening displayed Kansas in all her
glory and showed Chlcagoan3 that
treasurers -were lying not far away in
the west waiting to "be garnered.
The one disappointment of the even
ing was the non-appearance of John J.
Tngalls. He was to have been the or
ator of the occasion. But John J. In
galls did not come. He telegraphed
that he was snowbound somewhere in
Wisconsin and that he could not pos
sibly reach Chicago in time for the
vnsas meeting.
Th Kansas meeting wa? arranged "by
the Kansas Million club, which was or
ganized with the sole idea of bringing
a. -million nf7vn? tn fhe Sunflower s.nto
Governor E. N, Morrill was on the
platform and he It was who led the
praises of his state. "With the governor
sn the platform 'were J. R. Burton,
and other Sunflower orators.whose tell
ing remarks were greeted with tre
mendous applause; ID, Stanley, the state
school superintendent, and J. W. Beek
man, W. C. Kdwards, the secretary of
the state of Kansas; W. T. Trice. J. S.
Emory, the irrigation lecturer, and E.
"Wilder the treasurer of the Santa Fe
road.
Frankl'n H. TTead introduced Govern
or Morrill briefly and the chief execu
tive of Kansas began to sound the
praises of the Sunflower state. He sa'd
that fertile lands were awaiting those
who wished to seek new homes Tvhere
they could be Independent and where
thev would not foe worried by the land
lord who always had an Insatiable ap
petite for rent.
MISTAKES ABOUT KANSAS.
"Many mistakes have been made
about the financial standing of Kansas
continued rthe governor, "which the
Million club wishes to overcome and
-et right, The club wishes to put be-
fore the npnnlo s tmo Imnoct -,t!for tn appointment Of a CaUCUS COm-
ment of facts and of resources of this
state and we are all united for the
same object.
"Kansas has suffered tremendously
on account of the panic of 1S93. Up to
that time immigration was brisk and
many secured homes in the state and
many were lookincr forward tn a. hnr
and prosperous career. The trouble
rame through the ease in borrowing
money. "We got monevtoo easily from
astern Investors and that was the rea
ron why there were so many homeless
Kansas people when the panic came.
"The financial nres;iir wa foif -mm-
severely in Kansas because the people
depend on the land and the land de-
psnds on the rainfall. Tho trftorn
nirt will not be available for miti.
lion unless under new methods of irri
gation. Then It will become the home
of thousands of happy and prosperous
people."
The governor told them of the growth
nd history of the state. He said that
It JS61, Kansas had no state institu
tions. Now it had a splendid state
house, a state university, hospital and
a home for old oldlers and old soldiers
orphans. The entire state indebted
ness, he declared, was but $759,000. of
which $438,000 was held as the school
fund. Kansas was not full of stifferinsr
and starvation, but full of wideawake
people, who wanted others to join them
In building up a great state.

REPUBLICAN SENATE CAUCUS.
"Washington, Dec 2 The Republican
senators were in caucus for half an
hour after the senate adjoarned today
but adjourned until "Wednesday with
out taking any action on. the re-organization
of the senate.
Mr. Sherman was elected chairman
of the caucus and Mr. Dubois secreta
ry. The discussion was info-mal and
centered around the question whether
the Republican senators, having a plu
rality but not a majority of the senate,
should .attempt a re-organization with
Republican officers and Republican
chairmen of committees. It was evi
dent that the prevailing sentiment fa
vored Republican organization aid
some strong speeches were made, no
tably by Mr. Davis of Minnesota and
Aldrich of Rhode Island, urging that
there would be no combination or com
promise with any element outside the
! Republican ranks,
This appeared ro
voice the general view of the senators
and no opposition speeches were made.
The question arose, however, as to
whether the test of strength should re
made on securing the committees or on
the choice of a president pro ten. In
order to present this issue, Mr. Hoar
moved the appointment of a commit
tee on committees, to have charge of a
move to secure committee re-organization
on Republican lines. Mr. Hale
offered an amendment for a test on the
choice of president pro tern. Jn the
formal discussion following. Mr. Fryes '
name was mentioned as the probable
candidate for president pro tem. Some
sonat, riAin ,. f J.
senators raised the point, however, tnat
the president protem could not be elect- '
ed while the presiding officer was pres- I
ent and acting under the senate rulfb.
It was Anally decided that no vote
should be taken at present and Messrs.
Hoar and Hale withdrew their motions.
The understanding was that a definite
line of action would be agreed on at the
meeting "Wednesday, following the ses
sion of that day. The principal reason
for the withdrawal of the resolution
mne b' the char was the discovery
of the fact tnat there was a lare ele-

Chicago, Dec 2. "Wheat had a hesitat
ing appearance for an hour today as to
Tvtfiidh course to pursue, up or down. It
decided finally upon the former and
closed strong at an advance for the day

The chief cause of the strength the
market displayed was to be found in
i&hea mount of spot wheat for shipment
here and for export from New York.
Ahout an hour from the opening May
had declined to 60 cents, of cent
below its closing value on Saturday.
After the reaction to 60s cents the po
sition of the bulls was forfeited from
time to time by a large number of tele
grams which came to hand, after that
belnig in their favor. For instance, the
second cables from Liverpool gave that
maket pence -higher, the rise, it was
said, being due to decreasing stocks
of -wheat and flour, and anxiety regard
ing (the political situation. The mar
ket after 'the first hour became very
firm and in the last thirty minutes of
the session it ruled strong. May getting
as high as 60 cents about five min
utes from the end and it closed at 67
cents against 60 bid at the close on
Saturday. December at, the wind up

Sir Morrill MacKenzie, Count

In Its medical fraternity Europe never
numbered two more eminent and respect

For years they have attended the most

passing interest in him on this account
made him 'his confidant, and imparted to
him the secrets of the remedies he Is now
using in this country with such wonderful
sucecss.
VENO'S CURATTVE SYRUP (30c. a

for nervousness, dyspepsia, liver, kidney,

dience at the auhltorium, last night,
listened to the eloquent periods of
Henry "Watterson without having ac
quired a 'better understanding of Lin
coln, a higher ideal of patriotism and a
more comprehensive knowledge of hu
manity. Few men could paint the pict
ure of Lincoln's life as the eloquent
panegyrist of last; night presented it.
Few eulogists have so rich a subject
upon which to discourse.
The eulogy was the tribute of a genius
to the memory of one inspired to a
grand work which was mastered In the
time allotted to its performance. It was
a narrative so simple and pathetic that
it became the subject it canonized. No
other man in the past or present has
spoken of Lincoln as he deserves to be
spoken of. Until "Watterson spoke of
him no one thoroughly understood a
nature that was as plain, simple and
sincere as the affections of a child.
In the work in which Henery "Water
son is engaged he is serving humanity.
He is opening the minds and hearts of
his countrymen to the reception of a
memory that deserves to be cherished.
He is teaching the people of this coun
try a lesson dn patriotism which will
survive and expand after he has joined
Lincoln in the Beyond, when posterity
will praise him as he now justly eulo
gizes the great character of the greatest
epoch In modern history.

Mrs.
Schnltzler, Upon Hearing that Ball
whs I.efuied Her !ou, I'alnt.
Mrs. Caroline Schneitzler fainted in
the police court yesterday and no small
share of excitement prevailed for some
time. Fritz, her husband, was present
and fanned her with an Eagle while
others procured water.
In a short time Mrs. Schneitzler came
to again and -was quite exhausted.
The cause of the accident to Mrs.
Schneitzler was that she found her son
"Will, injail. The young man was ar
rested a short tune before that and
taken to the police station. Usually
men of his class are kept in the clerk's
office to await hond, but on this occa
sion hetwas put behind the bars. Judge
Tucker having refused to accept bond
until the return of the warrant by the
officer who served it In due time this
formality was complied with and bonds
were given.
Immediately after the demands of the
police were satisfied "Will Schneitzler
was taken charge of by the sheriff and
taken to the county Jail for contempt of
the district court where a temporary
injunction Is hanging over the place
where he was found. He gave a 5500
hond for this also and was released.
At noon yesterday the chief of police
and Officer Henry Forby took a search
and seizure -warrant to the Citizens
club which is located on the second
floor of the building at U7 North Mar
ket street At the entrance to the club
room one of the secretaries Is always
found with tickets to sell to the mem
bers of the club. "With these tickets
they buy -whatever refreshments are
kept in the club room. The attending
secretary keeps the book of membership
and also the seal of the club. These
were at once seized by the chief of po
lice after which the two officers went
Into the club room proper to seize the
liquors.
While taking an Inventory of the
liquids the chief laid the hook of mem
bership down on the end of the counter
or bar and directed Constable Forby to
ro after an express wagon to take the
wet goods to the police station. While
the chief was busy looking after the
"bottles and jugs some ligbtftngered gen
tleman swipea tne precious dook or
membership and escaped. When the
chief missed the all Important record
he became much wrath and instead of
taking the book, seal and liquors as he
said he only intended to take he an
runced that he would take everything.
At the first effort the improvised bar
was torn from its anchorage and then
the marble top sideboard was dis
mantled section by section. He wnt
through that club room like a tornado
and when the wagon was loaded there
was nothing left
The trial of the case will probably be
heard this morning la the police court,

New York, Dec 2. Lively covering
of shorts Jn the industrials was the fea
ture of today's speculation and re
sulted ia a. strong market for that
group. The railway list was relatively
less active as a whole, and was ham
pered to an extent by an abatement of
the demand from the shorts, and by
foreign selling of the international
shares and especially St Paul.
The market showed no Improvement
as to its professional character. There
ner. but few developments bearing di
rectly upon the speculation. Denver

the Cripple Creek mining excitement
The statement of the company's opera

ert a sustaining 'influence on the stock
although substantial Increases in earn

It was aggressively strong throughout
and inspired a hurried march to cover
on the part of the -bears in that and
other oversold shares, and especially
Chicago Gas. The raise was attended
by allegations of foreknowledge by
powerful manipulators that no serious
legislative attacks upon the industrials
are impending in the near future. The
marke'. was strengthened too, by the
non-engagement of gold for shipment

premature argument A German-American
banking house is expected to
