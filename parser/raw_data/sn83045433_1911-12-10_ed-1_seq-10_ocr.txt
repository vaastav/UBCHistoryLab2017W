RANSDELL COMES
BACK AT WILLARD
By THOMAS C. SIIOTAVEI.L.
New York, Dec. 9 Short coverings
held the market firm to-day causing
some further advances. Dealings were
almost entirely professional. At the
close of the session the stce! corpora
tion announced nn Increase of 447,627
tons In the volume of unfilled orders on
Us books at the end of November as
compared with the end of October. This
Is double what the street expected The
banks showed a gain of $10,387,33) In ac
tual surplus at the close of business
Friday night. Deposits are reduced $38.-
281,000 and loans reduced J45,S53.O0O Great
Northern Ore certificates and Wabash
were the weak features.
Stocks have been disturbed the past
week by plans for reorganizing Wabash
and Allls-Chalmers The disturbance
was not caused so much by the Impor
tance of these reorganizations as b the
fact that they come at a time when
business failures In general are so nu
merous as to be startling The Novem
ber failures are about the worst since
1897, and December failures promise to
be fullj as bad both In number of firms
and in the volume of capital.
ClinnKc In Rnntl Control.
On the constructive side of the market
a deal was announced whereby New York
Central gets tontrol of Ontario and West
ern, taking It from the New Haven,
which will take control of the Rutland
Railroad from the New York Central
This deal gives New Haven a direct line
to Montreal and gives the New Yock
Central a greater control over the an
thracite business The deal cannot be
consummated until the public service
commission grants permission, and that
permission has been asked
Mone remained high, lending early in
the week at 5 per cent and touching a
high point of 5 per cent Friday. The
msterious loss of cash reported by the
banks the previous week was explained
by saying that gold engaged for export
to Canada had been subtracted from the
cash In advance on the same principle
that when a check is certified the certi
fication is subtracted from the account
against which it is drawn
President Taft's message was favorably
received by the street, particular! j so by
Insiders of the American Tobacco Corn
pan. The President's description ot the
settlement of the Tobacco case as the
best possible was heartily concurred In
by the Tobacco people.
Company Need Cnnli.
WInslow S Pierce was made chairman
of the reorganization committee for the
Wabash road, and the Equitable Trust
Company, as trustee of the mortgage, ex
ercised its privilege of appointing a ma
jority of the board ot dlreectors. The
company is understood to need $10,000,
000 spot cash Kuhn, I-oeb &. Co are
Interested In the reorganization plans.
While the most conservative people In
the street look for a further decline In
the stock market, they attach great Im
portance to the fact that there have
been heavv rains and snows recently
al' over the countrj. The government
reports i slightly smaller planting of
winter wheat but the dry weather pre
vented or discouraged farmers from put
ting In their usual acreage. This, how
ever, will be made up with spring wheat
and other crops, and the heavy rains,
if the continue, will within three
months wash out all trace of panic from
business and the stock market b that
time the radicals In Congress will have
disclosed their worst Intentions and the
conservatives will have had an oppor
tunltj to show what they can do In the
waj of settling the trust problem so as
to encourage the resumption of bust
ness

The -w arninc; which President Danfel
illard, of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
road, gne to the Western governors in
Baltimore Friday night, that the next
period of Rreat Industrial activit might
find the railroads, because bf laclc of
equipment and new mileage, utterly un
able to earn the greatly augumented
burden Imposed upon them, is the strong
est possible argument for Improving the
waterwajs of the United States. In the
opinion or Representative Joseph E.
Rnnsdell. president of the National Rivers
and Harbors Congress
"The return of the disastrous condi
tion!) of 19C6-7. which seems to me ab
solutclj certain if we depend solely on
the rallwajs to carr our freights, is
one of the main reasons why we are
urging the improvement of waterwijs. '
said Mr Ransdell before leaving Tor
Louisiana to take up again his campaign
for nomination to the United States Sen
ate In place of Senator Foster.
"The fleet of barges on the Ohio and
Mississlpi rivers carry coal from Pitts
burg to New Orleans In quantities and at
a speed which Is entlrel beond the
rowers of the rallwas The development
of the countrj Is being hindered b the
Inadequacy of Its transportation facili
ties, and can never go forward at full
speed until our rallwajs ure supplement
ed bj a great connected sjstem of water
wavs "Mr W Illard appeals for a better un
derstanding between the rallwas and
the people. I suggest that one thing that
would help toward this end would be for
railway men to stop their opposition to
the improvement of watertvay If there
was any one thing plainly manifest at
the great convention of the National
Rivers and Harbors Congress just closed
it wijsr a growing Impatience on the part
of the business men of the country with
the attitude of railways upon this ques-
u.ierna3 existed before rail

tion
was were heard of, and the charters
granted to railways were never meant to
give them a monopoly of all transporta
tion All experience shows that water
was do not Injure railways, but that
they share fully In the prosperity which
waterways create."
Athletes entering a race over a long
course frequently run on the first part
of the course at top speed in order to
take the heart out of their opponents.
Later, If the can hold out the speed
all well and good. If not, they have a
safe lead In which to loaf a little and
catch their breath before the other run
ner comes up.
This is the sjstem some of the con
testants for The Washington Herald's
tour contest have adopted. Apparently
their motto Is: 'Take the heart out of
the other fellow K ou possibly can,
otherwise the chances are they will try
to take the heart out of you." Votes are
going to come In by bushels In the next
six days. The farther jou get ahead of
the rush the easier sailing you will have.
But don't get discouraged because some
body hops ahead of you. Most of the
big contests are won In an eleventh hour
finish. A few thousand votes is a mere
bagatelle. They can be won In half day's
canvassing. It you have to start late,
you can still go up to the lead If you
work hard. Better start late than not
start at all.
There were many subscriptions taken
for fix. months each along toward the
beginning of the contest, which' are, .pros
pects now. In many cases tho contest-'
ants are renewing these subscriptions for
six months, one or two jears. In some
cases the subscribers are waiting to have
the contestant who took their subscrip
tions come back to them for longer-term
subscriptions When their subscriptions
have expired they do not want to miss
a copy of The Washington Herald.
Any person who subscribed for The
Washington Herald after September 19 is
a new subscriber. He Is privileged to
extend his subscription for six months,
or one or more jears. and still be a new
subscriber The distinction between a new
and an old subscriber Is that the "person
taking the paper when the tour contest
was announced. September 13. 1911, is an
old subscriber, and the one starting the
paper since that date Is a new sub
scriber. N
Extra Trip the Center.
The extra trip to Europe offered by
The Washington Herald to the losing
candidate who makes the largest gain
in votes between 10 p. m. November 23
and 10 p. m. December 16, Is the center
to which eyes are focused by most of
the contestants.
Totes count up so rapidly; rthat It does
not take a large number of subscriptions
to run up. Into big figures. One more
week of strenuous effort and thea U will
be all over hut the, shouting; v

Nov York Dec t -Dealings In cotton to-day
were quirt and represented evening up of contracts
preparatory to publication by the government Mon
day of Its estimate of the crop. Price fluctuations
were extremely narrow throughout the session, and
the close showed only trifling net changes.
Liverpool sent over better prices, but the New
xork market failed to resiond. Our market did
not follow Liverpool, because Lirennol purchased
only high grade cotton for spinning purpose, while
any grade of cotton can be delivered rn the New
York cotton contract. Aa this season's crop eon
tains a large amount of low grade cotton. New
leak interests are afiald tn advance the prion for
fear that they be swamrcd with a staple cf low
grade. Spot sales of 8,0O) hales were made in Liver
pool at 6 points decline, to CCSd for middling.
