A few «lays ag«» we had occasion to re
fer to a casein this city which illustrated
tlie glorious uncertainties of our system
of trial by jury, and now iu the case of
the people m Washington accused of an
infamous conspiracy to fasten an récusa

we l*i y»- a ettil more startling demonstra

juries are drawn and jury trials are held.
At the trial recently held the accused
escaped condemnation through u disa

dence that most pereonH who had no in
terest in the mutter except to see jus

and now it is stated that they will es
cape altogether through a decision of
the Court in banc that the Grand Jury
which indicted the conspiratora w
illegally drawn. A very serious question
now comes up, as to whether this par
ticular Grand Jury was not made up in
an illegal manner intentionally. One uf
the men indicted by it was the Assistant
District Attorney, and those most inter
terested in the success of the con.*r»iiui y
were intimately connected with
Washington Ring, the doings of which
have occupied so much of the attention
of the country for Heveral years past*

concessions to the demand for some in
crease of currency, and favor some of
the internal Improvement schemes, ei

to disappointment, and although the
fact that he is for specie resumption at

men in both houses, who are mainly
Democrats, very few agree with him
as to the means of bringing it about.
So far us his message was expected
by any one to aid in rallying the brok
eii column of the Republican party it
was a complete failure His specie
policy will be iyuored in both houses,
and the probability is that nothing will
be done w ith the Currency question
this session, and time will be wasted
as it was last winter, in fruitless en
deavors to harmonize conflicting view s
in both parties. Tiiere will, however,
