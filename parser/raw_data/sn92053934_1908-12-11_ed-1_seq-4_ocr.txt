will purchase hundreds of dollars'
worth of stamps from persons not con
nected with the postal service, and
without either asking questions or re
porting to the authorities. These
stamps are necessarily sold through a
"fence" and at a liberal discount, and
the government secret service men
contend, with some show of reason,
that merchants who buy their stamps
in large quantities from unknown men
are making it easy for the postofflce
burglars to go on with their work.
The loss in such cases falls on the
postmaster, who, while he may be re
imbursed by an act .of congress," is al
ways compelled to wait a long time for
the adjustment of his claim. Recent
ly congress has authorized the post
master general to settle minor losses,
where the facts are satisfactory to the
inspectors, but in cases of large loss,
like that in the Indiana town, the post
master must wait for his relief in spe
cial legislation.

Commerce Kxtension.
The fourth and last of the series of
commercial end industrial conferences
that have helped to make the present
week a notable one in the national
capital was held in Washington when
the National Council of Commerce met
to elect officers, adopt by-laws and to
perfect a plan to be followed by the
council in its futrrre work. The ses
sions were I tld in the offices of the
department of commerce and labor and
were attended by eminent representa
tives of commercial' organizations in
virtually every state in the union.
The National Council of Commerce,
which was inaugurated by Secretary
Straus a year ago has aroused consid
erable interest throughout the country,
about CO commercial bodies from the
leading cities of the United States hav
ing joined the council since its first
meeting. Secretary Straus has be
come more and more convinced of the
practical value of this progressive or
ganization, not only to the commer
cial activities throughout the country,
which can, through the council, be
constantly informed of trade oppor
tunities abroad, but to the various de
partments oi the government con
nected with the business world.
One of the features of the movement
is the establishment of a permanent
bureau of the council in Washington
it charge of a capable man who can
keep in close touch with the govern
ment departments that have to do
with commercial affairs and advise the
various commercial interests of im
lortant matters that arise from time
to time and, affect their welfare. Sim
ilar bureaus have existed for some
time in Germany, England, France and
other European countries and have
been found to lie of incalculable value

PRESIDENT'S VALEDICTORY.
Answers Question "What Shall We Do
For Our Ex-Presidents?"
rresident ..Roosevelt iu his office at
the White House recently gave what
may be considered his valedictory,
with permission to a correspondent to
use it. The president said:
"When the people of the country are
asking the question, 'What shall we do
for our ex-presidents? tell them that
they need do nothing for this ex-president.
He is going out to work and to
do for himself.
"I have had a first class" time as
president of the United States, and I
have enjoyed every minute of the time
I have been In the White House. When
I have finished the last stroke I am
going out contented and to work."
This statement came from the presl
dent after the close of a talk with one
of his friends, with whom he had
been discussing his approaching Afri
can trip.

The November Fire Ijoss.
The fire loss of the United States
and Canada for the month of Novem
ber, as compiled from carefully kept
records of the New York Journal of
Commerce and Commercial Bulletin,
shows a total of $15.S34,350. It is less
by $3,287,850 than for the correspond
ing month last year, and $114,000 less
than for November, lflOG. The fire loss
in the same territory for the 11 mouths
of the year is $224,503,100, which is
greater by $24,G33,700 than for the cor
responding period last year, and $216
205,450 less than for the 11 months in
lftOG. which included the San Fran
Cisco loss of $202,501,100. If the loss
for April, 1906, the month of that dis
aster, had been normal, the compari
son would be favorable to the 11
months of that year by about $55,50V
000.
During November there were S06 fires
which caused a loss of $10,000 or over
in each instance. There were nine
fires during the month which caused a
loss in each instance of $200,000 or
over. The Journal of Commerce says
that it is well known in insurance cir
cles that only the heavy increases in
security values has saved a number of
fire underwriting institutions from go
ing to the wall.
Robbing the PotstoffW-r.
The stealing of $18,000 worth of
stamps and currency from an Indiana
postofflce serves to call attention to
the report of the postal department
showing that this kind of thievery has
been growing rapidly for a number of
years, in spite of the most determined
efforts of the secret service to stamp
it out. During the lst year there
- were 1,802 such robberies, an increase
of 251 over the preceding year. The
government assumes losses by robbery
of postage stamps amounting to $72,
- 984: postal funds, $15,627; a total of
about $102,000.
In the course of the year 372 post
office burglars were arrested and all
but a half dozen were convicted. The
government never ceases its pursuit
of these thieves, who are mostly pro
fessionals and make a specialty of
robbing postofflces. One feature of
. the case, always puzzling to the gov-

KICKING A GOALBY LITTELL McCLUNG.
Copyrfghtcd, 190S, by Associated Literary Press.
Though it was only an hour before
the' great football game between Clin
ton and Darnall, their conversation
was not of the gridiron ns they walked
down Main street bound for Clluton
oval.
"There's only one thing that keeps
me from becoming engaged to you
right now. Thornton," said the girl
after a serious pause.
"You'll have to tell me. I.eta; I
can't guess it," answered the stalwart
quarterback of the Clinton eleven.
."Just this," she said. "I am not alto
gether sure that you really need me
in your life. You are a 6trong, self
reliant boy, capable of fighting your
own way over the obstacles that will
confront you.
"More than all else rmt together, I
want to know that without my en
couragement you would be - accom
plishing less that I will always be
an Inspiration to you.no matter what
your aims may be."
For a moment the young man did
not reply. Then he looked at his com
panion, his gaze sincere.
"Leta, you're right," he agreed quiet
ly. "That's the way I want you to
feel about It. Deep down in my heart
I know that you would always Inspire
ine to strive for the best In life. But
I must convince you of this, and I'll
do it, too, dear girl, " If I get the

'' "JIaybe you will, Thornton," she
replied, 'and I hope that you will

not, begin at tho game today?"

cause you are wearing oinion s col

pretty one. Isn't it?
"The gold and bro n stripes harmo

brown gown you are wearing. Your
ticket calls for a seat back on the
north goal, and I know I'll see' you
clearly despite the crowds."
"It certainly Is fine," she declared,
"that little Tne may be an inspiration
to a Clinton boy to play at his best!
But It seems almost a pity that you are
not one of the halfbacks or in the line,
though I know everything depends
on the quarterback. lie gives the sig
nals and delivers the ball, doesn't he?"
"I know what yon mean, Leta," he
said. "You would like to see me in a
position where I could run with the
ball instead of handing It out to some
body else?"
The girl nodded.
"Well, that's because I weigh only
143 Instead cf 200 pounds," he contin
ued. "After all. It takes sheer weight
In the line, and that naturally slides
me into the quarterback's place.
"But you mustn't forget that Clinton
depends upon me to kick the goals, and
a goal kicked or missed often wins or
loses a big game Hke this."
They were now on the college
grounds amid shouting hundreds and
fluttering fiag3 and pennants. Thorn
ton assisted Leta to her seat high up
In that part of the semicircular grand
stand that stretched around behind the
north goal.
. "I hope Clinton gets the 6outh end
of the field," be said as he started off
toward the clubhouse.

Soon the rlvcl elevens trotted out on
the Gc!d, r.r.d from the thousand

shout, while pennants, ribbons, hand

It was tho Treat wlnd-cp gan;e of
the year, and there was a chance for
any player to win a glery crown by
making the deriding touchdown. - Both

for the contest.
But. ns fate would have it, Clinton

for him.
But despite this disappointment be

and as the shrill whistle ' struck his
ears he leaped forward straight for
the ball that lay on the line twenty
yards in front of him. Biff! The oval

Three times the heavy backs charg
