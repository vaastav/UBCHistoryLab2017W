ELKTON, DECEMBER 0, 1893
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Cleveland’s annual mes
sage to Congress which appeared on
Monday, is a long and laborious
document, filled with an ample var
iety of information upon every
departmental subject, but noticeably
deficient in information upon sub
jects that the people of this country
~ naturally and properly for
information upon.
Indeed, the whole message is
marked by more generality than
exactness of statement, and is there
fore the more disappointing in its
failure to deal explicitly with import
ant questions of policy which inter
est all of Mr. Cleveland’s country
men.
For instance, since the repeal of
the Sherman Bill, the question of a
national currency is a problem
which interests everybody, but Mr.
Cleveland practically ignores the
the subject and substantially con
fesses that he does not know what
will happen as a result of the silver
purchase repeal. The only state
ment in the message approaching
explicitness on the financial situation
is contained in a few lines expressing
his belief that Congress ought to
make clearer the authority ol the
Secretary of the Treasury to issue
bonds, an intimation, that the admin
istration may avail itself of such
authority.
Upon the Hawaiian complication
Mr. Cleveland is positively sphinx
like, giving the country no indi
cation ol the important instructions
recently issued to Minister Willis,
and only indicating his desire to see
a monarchy restored at Honolulu.
While so vague and unsatisfactory
upon the subjects indicated, the
message shows Mr. Cleveland to be
as good a free trader as ever. He
seems to see no significance in the
recent verdict of the people and
the rehabilitation of Mr. McKin

finance and trade.
A LOflG SESSION Of OONGEESS
The session of Congress which
opened on Monday promises to be a
ong one. It also is certain to be a
busy one, else all signs fail .
One of tne most radical economic
~ preSented to Congress for
sometime is to be examined and
passed upon, and the issues which
are at stake will make this measure
e subject of searching attention
and much criticism before it is finally
cted upon, fhe path before the
Wilson tariff bill, which will engross
much of the attention of Congress, is
a stormy one.
~ ™ e COnsiderati °n °t the Wilson
bill will scarcely be over before April
or May. The bill already has aroused
a flood of criticism and objection and i
much of this opposition has come
from the party whose representatives
have it in their power to settle the
fate of the measure. The South has
raised a cry aid made upon

at this time to carry out to letter the
pledges contained in the Democratic
Presidential platform.
As a result of all these circum
stances, the discussion of the Tariff
bill will be lengthy. That bill will
certainly be much changed when it
finally becomes a law, and any agree
ment upon these changes, though
only the party in power be consider
ed, will lake several months. Kven
it_Cv>ngress confines itself strictly to
business it will be well info the
summer before it concludes its
labors.
THE PROPOSED ELKTON AND
SOUTHERN.
The result of the meeting held in
Elkton on Tuesday clearly indicates
that the residents of the First, Sec
ond and Third districts are strongly
advocating the building of the pro
posed Elkton and Southern railroad
from a point on the Baltimore and
Ohio, most probably either Childs
or Singerly, to Lambson’s, Kent
County, to there connect with the
Baltimore and Delaware Bay rail
road. The southern objective point
of the road at present however is the
Sassafras river, but the projectors of
the enterprise are confident that the
Cecil road would eventually develop
into the northern link of an Eastern
Shore road connecting the extreme
peninsula with the Baltimore and
Ohio trunk line, and following the
prospective route of the Lancaster,
Cecil and Southern railroad, pene
trate into the heart of the mining
districts of Pennsylvania. The
accomplishment of this scheme
through the uniting ol the various
county railroads of the eastern shore
would afford the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad system a competative line
with the Delaware railroad, and
which would connect the various
county seats of this ’ thrifty, fertile
and progressive section of Maryland
which is, as the conditions now exist,
in need of better and more direct
railroad facilities. Reports from
Kent and Queen Anne’s counties
in particular, urge Cecil to take
the initial and necessarily decisive
step in the consummation and
development of this project, by con
structing the Elkton and Southern
railroad. The matter has been
considered by the property owners
and the residents generally of the
three Cecil county districts through
which the railroad would pass, and
as far as can be ascertained the con
sensus of opinion is favorable toward
the construction of the road. At
the meeting on, Tuesday it was
stated that financial aid would be
forthcoming provided the initial and
necessarily successful steps are pre
viously taken by the citizens of the
county, who would be benefitted by
by theline. The amount ol $55,000
exists in the State treasury which is
applicable to this purpose, Cecil's
share of an appropriation of sB,coo,
000 made many years since by the
, Legislature for “The Internal Im
, provement” ol the Eastern Shore
, counties of Maryland. Upon the
, agitation of the Elkton and Massey’s
railroad, a comparatively recent
enterprise, this amount, which was
, formerly $58,000, was appropriated
to the purpose, and which, through
the proper legislation on the part ol
. our representatives, could be trans
ferred to the Elkton and Southern,
i This amount however we believe is
not available until an equal amount
of stock has been subscribed, which
would as far as possible be issued in
exchange for rights of way. The
, need of this line traversing such a
productive agricultural district is
t conceded when the transportation
L facilities now enjoyed are considered
, and the development of the country
; is materially hampered by this one
; important want. As reported in

>ts budding is partially dependent
upon the sources trom which it would
derive its mamtenance. Its building
depends on a sufficient amount of
s-tock being subscribed and upon the
ability of this section ot the county to
maintain a railroad. These are the
critical questions with which the
committee will have to deal in their
report, which will be influenced by
the manner in which they receive
the co-operation of those who would
be befitted by the propped road.

THE CECIL WHIG, ELKTOIsT, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9 1893.

ent argues for an income tax on
corporations now is valuable as
indicating how he will argue for a
tax on personal incomes when the
deficit is still seen to exist.

ant questions of policy which interest
all of his countrymen.
Philadelphia Evening Telegraph,

Philadelphia Call, Rep.—Those who

to Hawaii will be disappointed.
Philadelphia Record, Dem. —The

1 is disappointing. It is a budget of
: interesting recapitulations of matters
1 mainly within the public Knowledge;
, but it is exceedingly barren of original
recommendations.
Philadelphia North American, Rep.
—The message is a profound dis

5 universal attention.
• Philadelphia Ledger, Ind.—Presid

5 notable for its comprehensiveness.

1 New York Evening Post, Dem. —
1 The President’s message is mainly ol

• New York Press, Rep.—Not a

a sentence of hope in President Cleve
land’s message.

s atiou of President Cleveland,

f if th f y ask for i( wi| l not be
ndered to them—remove some of the
ruinous sections of the bill; but few
republicans are counting upon their
doing anything so sensible.
It is not yet certain when the
Cleveland tariff bill be reported to the
House, A resolution adopted by the
House just before the close of the
extra session provided that the repub
hcan members of the Ways and Means
committee should have ten days from
the time they wer e furnished a
complete copy of the bill to prepare
their report against it. If that resolu
ion is to be binding the bill will , 0 t
be reported to the House until well
>nto next week, as the republican
have not yet been furnished a com
plete bill—the internal revenue part of
it has not been finished bv the demo
crats, and the figures ol the Treasury
Department showing the estimated
effect of the proposed bill on the t
revenues of the country were only f
furnished them Monday. The as
tounding statement is, however,
unofficially made that the democrats
will make a separate bill of the internal t
revenue changes >n order that the ten (
days may date from last Monday, .
when the tariff schedule was first made -
public. To do such a thing would be c
manifestly unfair. f
The reason why the internal revenue
part of tire tariff bill has.not been ,
completed is that Mr. Cleveland and -
his heretofore willing tools, the demo- 1
crats on the Ways and Means com ‘
raittee, have locked horns over the (
proposition to include therein an in- j
come tax, to which Mr. Cleveland is
opposed. Up to this time all efforts
to reach a compromise have been .
unsuccessful, and some shrewd men
are predicting that the income tax will
be the rock upon which the Cleveland
and anti Cleveland democrats in Con
gress will split for good and all. We
shall see.
The administration men are talking
in a mysterious way about a new ,
treaty with China, which the adminis
tration is negotiating. They claim so
many things for this treaty it will per
haps be better to wail and ascertain
how much truth there is in their claims.
Many statesmen have tried to get the
best of the wily Chinese diplomats, -
but up to date none have succeeded
to any marked extent, and Mr. Gres
ham is hardly the man to make a .
good job, even if he had a good
foundation to build upon.
Mr. J. P. Blaize, an extensive real estate
dealer in Dee Moines, lowa, narrowly
escaped one of the severest attacks of
pneumonia while in the northern part of
that state during a recent blizzard, says
the Saturday Hcrieui. Mr. Blaize had
occasion lo drive several miles during the
storm aud was so thoroughly chilled that
he was unable to get warm, aud inside of
an hour after Ids return he was threatened
with a severe case of pneumonia or lung
fever. Mr. Blaize sent to the nearest drug
store and got a bottle of Chamberlain's
Congh Kemedy, of which he had often
. heard, and took a number of large doses,
. He says the effect was wonderful and in a
short time he was breathing quite easily.
He kept ou taking the medicine and the
next day was able to come to Das Moines

Regarding Eiiristrrias. v
stock is replete with beautiful and appropriate articles
suitable for the holiday season.
Ihe spirit of Christmas giving will be as universal as
ever this year, but a wise regard for the economies will
suggest useful and practical gifts.
Our plans for the Holiday Season have been made with
this in view, and we now invite inspection of a complete and
carefully provided stock, especially suited to the require
ments of purchasers at this season. Those buying promptly
will have the advantage of full assortments to select from,
and the augmented force of salespeople and increased room
provided for Christmas goods, will enable the purchaser to
make more satisfactory selections than later, when the full tide
of the Christmas trade wall set in and the choice lines of
articles now displayed will be broken.
Goods selected now will be reserved, if desired, until
just before Christmas, and delivered then, as directed.
