Washington, Dec 5. President Taft'a
message on the trusts was read in
both (ranches of congress today and
ss generally well received. The pres
ident's objection to a repeal of the
Sherman law was approved by some of
the leaders on both sides, although the
democrats held that his first message
should have dealt with the tariff.
"An Able Message," Says Democratic
Leader,
"The message is an able one from
the president's standpoint," said Mr.
Underwood, the democratic leader, "but
we feel that the leading message should
have dealt with the tariff. There seems
to be an effort on the part of Presi
dent Taft and the administration to
force trust issues ahead. I am op
posed to a repeal of the Sherman law,
but there may be supplemental legisla
tion to define it. I do not think the
house favors a federal incorporation
set."
-'Taft'ss Strongest Utterance," Says
Mann.
Republican Ieader Mann, who has
not always agreed with the president,
praised the message, saying It prob
ably was the strongest utterance Pres
ident Taft has ever made.
In the house the reading of the raes
sai was interrupted by applause from
the republican side. The senate read
ing of the message was heard with its
usual dignified attention. The senate
then adjourned until Thursday in re
spect to the memory of the late Repre
sentative Madison of Kansas and Latta
of Nebraska.

OLD "GENERAL S LOCUM"
AT BOTTOM OF THE SEA.
I II -Fated Steamer Pursued by III Luck
as a ' Barge.
Philadelphia, Dec. 5. The last vest
ige of the unfortunate steamboat Gen
eral Slocum, on which about" 1,000
lives were lost in the waters of New
Tork some years ago, now, lies at the
bottom of the sea. After the steam
boat wa burned to the water's edge
the hull was converted into a barge
and given the name of Maryland. To
day a report was received here that
the barge could not stand the gale that
blew oft the New Jersey coast yester
day, and eank somewhere in the vi
cinity of Sandy Hook. The crew of
five men were taken off by a tug. The
Maryland was valued at $20,000 and
there was no insurance.
Hard luck pursued the hull of the
General Slocum even after it had been
turned into a barge. Peter Hagan, the
onnjr of the ill fated hull, said she
was always getting into trouble. ""Ill
fortune always followed her," he said
today. "Even on this trip we had to
put in a new rudder before ohe went
to sea. I am glad she's gone. Of
course, I didn't like to throw $20,000
into the sea, but now that she's gone,
I have no regret."
The Maryland left the Delaware
Capes Sunday afternoon with a cargo
of coke residue from Philadelphia for

Report.
St. Johnflbury. Vt., Dec. 5. Tin, epi
demic of smallpox which has caused

sidered that the spread of the disease
has been checked. President Caverley

cases that required a jury or witness
es. Some of the court business that
can be accomplished without calling in
outside parties will be done and then I
the court will take a recess until the
danger passes.

of smallpox during the past few weeks.

Insurance Company Was Skeptical
Over Kellogg Durland's Death.
Boston, Dec. 5. A letter which was
found on the body of Kellogg Durland,
author and sociologist, who died from
poison taken at the South station In
this city on Nov. 19, was made public
by District Attorney Pelletier tonight,
ou account of an investigation of the
death which a life insurance company
is making. The letter, which is a part
oZ the official report of Medical Ex
aminer Magrath. was directed to a
friend of Durland's, W. D. Parmalee,
of Munroe, N. Y. It says:
"Dear Parmalee: This tragedy is a
terrible thing to have come into any
one's life. I deeply regret being the
cause of its having been brought into
yours. I deserve unmeasured and un
ending hell for having questioned one
who was so loyal and true as Genevieve-
I simply could not understand
nor comprehend so many things. I
have troubled you so infinitely already
that perhaps a little more will not
matter. In the attic home is a huge
iron trunk, painted red. In it are many
letters and papers of mine. Kindly
have these burned. On the little book
shelf in the S. E. corner of the library
is a brown pasteboard box filled with
pictures, postcards, letters, etc. Give
these to my mother. I think she would
treasure these. Also some of my books
which are In the library, and especial
ly the poets. Her address you can get
by telephoning Frank A. K. Boland, 34
A, Broadway (a lawyer), the rest of
the books in the library that are mine
please forward to Louis fiessa. Spring
Valley. N. Y., if it is not necessary to
sell them, in which event please write
him that it was my wish that he was
to have them, anyway. I have written
my letters and all is in readiness at
hand. I am wholly ready. I am only
pondering whether I should hold off
just long enousrh to see that no one
brings you in any way into that which
is nothing to you save the pain that
you must suffer as a friend. From my
heart I thank you for the noble way
you have stood by me."
The medical examiner's report says
that Durland committed suicide end
that he was in disguise at the time,
having shaved his full beard and put
on old clothing.
Durland left an insurance policy of
Sto.OOO to go to his wife. The policy
was not contestible because of suicide,
but the unusual circumstances of the
man'.s death by taking cyanide of no
tassium. in the presence of his wife,
while In her compartment on a train
at the South station, together with the
fact that the G'i of the death was
kept secret for nearly four days, led
the insurance company to investigate
before making payment.
MAGNIFICENT PROFITS OF
BEET SUGAR INTERESTS
Farmer Reaped No Benefit from Re
cent Advance in Sugar.
Washington, Dec. 5. Representative
Baker of California drew from W. T.
Willett, a sugar expert witness before
the house investigating committee, to
day, the magnitude of the profit made
by the beet sugar interests on the rise
in sugar to. the consumer, which be
gan in June of this year.
Mr. Willett said that when the New
York price of sugar advanced, a cor
responding rise was announced in the
west, notwithstanding the fact that the
beet sugar refineries of Colorado and
California had an enormous supply of
their product on hand. He said" the
farmer got no benefit mm mo rise
and that it was made "l... -. u ,as
good business."
If the manufacturers had not ad
vanced the price, he added, they
would have been called fools.
Mr. Willett denounced the gratuity
given the Hawaiian sugar planters bv
free entry to the United States and
expressed the opinion that free raw
sugar would "starve the beet sugar
men to death.

STATEMENT BY JUDGE.
Says James Is Willing to Take Death
Sentence to Save-His . Brother.
Los Angeles, Dec. 5. Judge Walter ;
Bordwell . issued a formal statement '
late todav giving his views as to the
McNamara trial and especially what
brought ab'.ut its termination. The
statement follows:
The Judge's Statement,
"In a spirit of indifference to every
thing in the McNamara cases, save
the facts and the law applicable there
to,I deem it due to. the court and to
this community that I should iViake a
brief public statement regarding the
circumstances, attending the abrupt
close of .thaee cases, together with
siffk-ient comment - to indicate my
views as to such circumstances. This
is done in the hope of correcting, if
possible, some misconceptions due to
erroneous publications, and particular
ly to an article which appeared in a
local newspaper on the 22d inst. over
the signature of Lincoln Steffen.
Not Due to Steffen.
"In the first place, the claim or sug
gestion that the termination of the
cases was due to the efforts of him
self and other outsiders, who under
took to influence the officers of the
court other than the judge is with
out justification in fact.
Did Not Influence Asreement.
"I also wish to denounce the claims
of that gentleman and of other per
sons for him. that the change of pleas
from 'not guilty' to 'guilty' was due
to his efforts as groundless and un
true. He is correct in the statement
that the coi'.rt was not a party to
any negotiations for what he terms a
'compiomise' of these cai?es, but there
is no grounl for any claim that he
induced the prosecution to come to an
agreement in the matter. The district
attorney acted entirely without regard
to Mr. ' Steffens and on lines decided
upon before the latter appeared on the
scene. "
Bribery Discovery Caused Change of
Pleas.
"As to the defense, the . public can
rely on it that the developments of
last week as to the bribery and at
tempted bribery of jurors 4n the James
IJ. McNamara case were the efficient
cause of the change cf pleas which
suddenlv brought these casts to an
end. The district attorney could have
had James B. McNamara's plea of
guilty long ago if he had been willing
to dismiss the cases against his broth
er, but he refused, insisting that the
latter was gui'ty and should suffer
punishment.
Propositions of Defense.
"The first proposition, from those in
terested in the defense were that
James B. Me.Varnara should change his
plea from 'not guilty to 'guilty on
condition that he should not be sen
tenced to death, and that his brother
should go free. The district attorney
would not agree. Afterwards emis
saries from the defensi brought to the
district attorney the proposition thai
.Tames B. McNamara would plead guil
ty and be sentenced to death if the
court so ordered, provided that his
brother should be saved. But the dis
trict attorney still would not agree.
ames Willinq to Die to Save John.
"Those Interested in the defense con
tinued to urge his acceptance of the
last proposition for ten days or more
atntil the bribery developments re- j
vealed the desperation of the defense :
and paralyzed the effort to save John 1
J. McNamara by sacrificing his broth
er. Then it was that the change of!
the pleas of these men was forthcom- I
lng. I
McNamaras Not "Two Heroes."
"The notion broached in the Steffens
article that the McNamaras in the
commission of the crimes as confess
ed by them, are. 'two heroes' Is offen
sive to common intelligence and re
pellant to the conscience of all just
men to s.iy nothing of the abiior
rence of the law for such sentiment,
end I am confident that the district
attorney was not influenced by any
such sentiment in considering the pro
1 osal that the defendants should with
draw their pleas of 'not guilty.'
Pleas Caused Mitigation of Sentence.
"Upon the entries of the ple"hs of
'guilty both defendants placed them
selves upon the- mercy -of the court,
and the responsibility sole and undi
videddevolved upon the court to de
termine the punishment. That some
mitigation of '.he extreme penalties
demandable by the outraged law mli'ht
be expected in consequence of the
change of pleas in these cases, is in
accordance with the principle com
monly accepted in the ndministration
of criminal jurisprudence.
Steffens a Professed Anarchist.
"That expectation has not been dis
appointed In these cases. At the same
time, the duty of the court in fixing
the penalties in these cases would
have been unperformed had It been
swayed, in any degree, by the hypo
thetical policy favored by Mr. Stef
fens (who, by the way, is a professed
anarchist), that the judgment of the
ourt should be diverted to the pro
motion of compromise in the contro
versy between "capital" and 'labor.'
The Lesson of the Cases.
"The lesson taught by the cases is
that the law must be rigorously en
forced against all offenders whether
they be rich or poor, high or low-, cap
italists or laborers and that only by
obedience to the law can society be
maintained or its blessings tnjoyed."

When we select our wheat
