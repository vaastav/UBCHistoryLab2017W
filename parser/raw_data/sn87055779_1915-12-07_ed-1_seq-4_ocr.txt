IT PAYS TO AUVKHTISir'
Wiseacre who decry the use of
printer's Ink ax a medium of public
ity are advised to j?o and se "It
Pays to Advertise." Cohan and Har
ris' latest play suecVs, which is to
be presented at th Oliver theater
this evening- and tomorrow matinee
and night. "It Pays to Advertise" Is
a farce that was the reigning langh
in ff hit at the (Jeorge M. Cohan the
ater in New York all last season. It
was written by Hoi Cooper Merue,
author of "Under Cover," and Walter
Hackett.
This Ingenious comedy will. It is
said, do more to boost the advertis
ing business than any argument the
smartest of advertising men could
think of. Indeed, this show con
tains about the best arguments that
a convention full of promoters could
think up in a month. Moreover, it
is full of laughs and, what is more to
the point, iris clean.
The story told in "It Pays to Ad
vertise" concerns an Idle youth whose
father, a captain of industry, casts
him a.side. He falls in with a young
man who Is full of ideas, the princi
pal one being publicity. "Say a thing
often enough and hard enough," says
this yountf promoter, "and the man
you are trying to convince will not
only fall for your argument, but will
shortly believe that he himself is the
originator of it."
The disowned son and his pal de
vise a scheme to boom a new brand
of wonder soap and by means of an
extraordinary advertising campaign
build up a tremendous business. Put,
unfortunately, they have no soap.
Father, astounded at his son's com
mercial coup, comes to the rescue
and all Is well, but not before count
less complications, sentimental and
otherwise, have transpired.
It would be a misfortune not to see
"It Pays to Advertise." It will give
you the laughing treatment, which
everybody needs and everyone is bet
ter for having, but It does more,
much more than that. It booms busi
ness, it Imparts the best business
spirit not the narrow, timid, cring
ing spirit of small business, but the
spirit bir, audacious, large-vision-ed,
which commands success.
ences. She finally brines herself up
to his standard, and then tells him j
what she had done, thus causing a ;
violent scene. His old girl tries to
win him back, hoping that he will
seek a divorce, but, in a thrilling
scene of dantrer and disaster the wife
proves herself the better woman,
and her sacrifice wins her husband's
love and forgiveness.
The drama is worked out to It.s
conclusion in a manner which capti
vates the minds and hearts of those
who see it. and leaves a comfortable
feelin of satisfaction over the fact
I that a Kirl. starting life under a
heavy handicap, has proven herself
worthy of the hlchest place in the
affections of an educated, high-bred
man.
A Vim comedy entitled "A Pair of
Pirds" is also to be shown. On to
morrow's bill are "The Tenderfoot's
Triumph," a Selig western comedy,
and "The House of Tear," a detec
tive story, with Arnold Daly in the
leading role.
ski.xi:k ix nhv oomi:iy itou:
Otis Skinner, who returns here on
next Thursday night. Dec. 9, it the
Oliver opera house for one time in
'Cock o the Walk," a new comedy
by Henry Arthur Jones, has a most
congenial role. Every now and then
the hardened playgoer comes across
a character study so perfect In de
tail and so convincing in effort that
one is bound to confess that acting
Is after all one of the arts. In the
new comedy from the brilliant pen
of Henry Arthur Jones, Mr. Skinner
has a hih comedy part that ought
to test the powers of any true com
edian. "Anthony Pellchamber," a
Rifted but unsuccessful actor, is a
perfect tornado of humor, wit and
good nature. He is the living em
bodiment of the "actor tempera
ment." His reverence for "The Im
mortal One," as he always terms
Shakespeare, is prodigious. His fac
ulty for quoting from the works of
the Hard of Avon and answering the
most commonplace and colloquial
questions in Shakespearean language
Js nothing short of marvelous. He Is,
in the fullest extent of the word,
"professional." Put he has. added
to his eccentricity of manner, a re
finement that is almost typically
aristocratic and not at all charac
teristic of many of the "good fel
lows" of the theatrical fraternity,
who carry conviviality to an excess.
members of the troupe. The open
ing number by Mine. Asoria and two
assistants is a scries of classic terp
sichorean whirls, seldom equalled
cn local vaudeville tills. Pice and
I'rancis follow with a talking act.
AT THE STII.WP.
The musical comedy company at
the Strand is presenting a farce,
"Thompson's Demise." Parry Hyatt
plays the leading comedy role, that
of a darky servant who has some
trying experiences with ghosts. The
plot is frequently interrupted by en
tertaining musical specialties, which
Include -Tilly Iee," sung by P.ob
Shaw; "You Will Have to jSwim
Pack to the Shore." by Mabelle Eil
er; "Celebration Day in Tennessee,"
I y Mamie Hertzell; "Don't Pe Angry
Mary," by Edna I.eNore; and "Dear
Little Girl." by Eunny Whitlock.
AT Till' COIiOMAIi.
"Satan Sanderson," as a novel,
sold' well into the million copies.
Later as a play, it attained a long
rrn on Proadway, and then en
joyed great vogue on tour. Now, in
its new form, a live part picture, it
bids fair to outdo either of the
others. "Satan Sanderson" is made
in 2 00 scenes, requires a cast of 4 0
players, and over $ 40,000 was spent
on the production.

On next Friday nik'ht, Dec. 10. the
Oliver Stock company will ajjain
take up a run of two bills a week
at the Oliver theater. The openinpr
play will be the much-heralded
drama. "The Devil." Thi has boon
a wonderful success in stock, owlntf
to its unusually strong story and the
many interesting parts. Mr. Finch
will be seen as Dr. Millar, "The
Devil," a part that is entirely dif
ferent from any he has played here.
Miss Aubrey will appear as Mrs.
Hoffman, the wife of the millionaire.
"The Devil" is a sreat play. There
are surprises and suspense In the
arrangement and the story has just
enough sensationalism to brintj the
play the popularity It deserves. "Kick
In," a new crook play, will be the
stock offering for the first half of
week starting Sunday, Dec. 12.
The LaSalle is planning an extra
photodrama program for next Tues

picture, "The Miracle of Life," will

KIDNEY DISORDERS
QUICKLY RELIEVED
Hundreds of people have "been re
lieved of the agonies caused by weak,
diseased or clogged-up kidneys by
usintr .Solvax. the now remedy that
(juickly reaches the source of all
kidney complaints.
If you suffer with pains in your
back "and sides or have any signs
of kidney or bladder trouble such
as rheumatic pains, puffy swellings
under the eyes or in tho feet and
ankles, if you are nervous, tired and
run-down, or bothered with urinary
disorders, Solvax will quickly and
surely relieve you of your misery.
Solvax is the most potent remedj
yet discovered for ridding the system
of uric acid and driving out all the
poisonous impurities which cause
such troubles. It neutralizes, dis
solves and makes the Sidneys sift
out all the uric acid and poisons left
by the blood, and renders the kidneys
and urinary organs clein, vigorous
and healthy.
Wettick's Original Cut Rate Medi
cine Store, the popular druggist, says
that no medicine ought to be paid
for unless it does the user some good.
He therefore sells Solvax under a
positive guarantee to quickly relieve
the worst case of kidney trouble or
refund the money. Try Solvax to
day and if you cannot see and feel
a decided change for the better
jest go to Wettick's Original Cut
Kate Medicine Store and tell him
you want your money back and he
will return it without question. This
Is the strongest argument that can
be offered in behalf of any medicine.
