It looks now like Huerta is holding
on from pure unadulterated cussed
ness.
The first parcel po>-t Christmas
will swell the already profitable experiment
of the postofflce department.
We need more small industries in
Lancaster. No matter how small the
beginning, they are sure to thrive
here.
"Huerta Fears Treachery," says a
headline. Just why, is not clear, unless
he fears to lose by treachery the
power he gained thereby.
The Cincinnati Knquirer well says
that "the under dog usually gets
$50,000,000 worth of sympathy and
two cents worth of assrstance."
And Mr. Mann, Republican tloor
leader of the house, has also joined
in the chorus of praise over the recent
message of President Wilson.
The "golden rule" plan for the
treatment of prisoners has been abandoned
in Cleveland, Ohio, but here
In South Carolina it is yet in force.
Governor Blease Is inconsistent in
advocating the lynching of negroes,
when he is continually turning them
out of the penitentiary after they
have been convicted in the courts.
November customs receipts disclose
a loss of $50,000,000 for the
year, but watch the United States ,
gain It all back with interest when
the income taxes have been paid.
That helpful County Conference
for the Common Good held recently
in Lancaster should be followed up
by community conferences throughout
Lancaster county, if the best results
are to be realized from the
movement.
Not to be counted among the least
fo our obligations are those we owe
to the community In which we live.
Are you doing your duty as a citizen
of Lancaster by giving of your best
eirort to the building of a city beautiful
and progressive?
If you are a knocker and a tightwad,
you have no right to complain
that your town is slow. Progressive,
public-spirited men make a live town
and if you do not answer this description
yourself, don't blame the town.
The failure or success of a community
life depends entirely upon the attitude
of its citizens.
There appeared a few days since
In The Columbia Record a cartoon
representing His Excellency, the governor,
opening the door of the penitentiary
and the convicts pouring out,
but nothing much is being said about
it. How different a few years ago
when the buzzard cartoon appeared
In The Columbia State.
In a recent interview with a reporter
of a Washington Republican
paper. Governor Blease censured
President Wilson for not going to war
with Mexico. We doubt very much
if our bellicose governor would be
ready to volunteer If war should
take place between the two countries.
And Henry Lane Wilson, ex-ambassador
to Mexico, recalled by President
Wilson, because he was too
thick with Huerta, is lecturing all
over the country for pay, the burden
of his song being a criticism of the
President for not recognizing Huerta
as rightful president of Mexico.
Henry Lane should show his faith by
his works and go over and fight for
Huerta.

President Wilson, in his annual
message to Congress, published in
full in this issue, makes it plain that
he is particularly interested in agriculture.
In speaking of the pending
currency bill, he says:
"It has, singularly enough, come to
pass that we have allowed the industry
of our farmers to lag behind the
other activities of the country in its
development. I need not stop to tell
you how fundamental to the life of
the nation is the production of its
food. Our thoughts may ordinarily
be concentrated upon the cities and
the hives of Industry, upon the cries
of the crowded market place and the
clamor of the factory, but it is front
the quiet interspaces of the open
valleys and the free hillsides that we
draw the resources of life and of prosperity,
front the farm and the ranch,
front the forest and the mine. Without
these every street would be silent,
every office desc" ed, every factory
fallen into dispa And yet the farmer
does not sta. upon the same
footing with the forester and the
I miner in the market of credit. He
lis the servant of the seasons. Nature
determines how long he must wait
for his crops and will not be hurried
in her processes. He may give his
note, but the season of its maturity
depends upon the season when his
crops mature, lies at the gates of the
market where his products arc sold.
And the security ho gives is of a
character not known in the broker's
office or as familiarly as it might he
on the counter of the banker."
A OOOI) SHI.Ft'TIOX.
The attorney general of the state,
we believe his name is Peeples,
in a communication to the
supreme court, declines, for reasons
satisfactory to himself, to represent
the state before that body in
the case now pending for the disbarment
of Sims, an attorney of the
Spartanburg bar. This is not surprising
in view of the fact that both
Sims and the attorney general kneel
at the shrine of ltlease. The supreme
court has, therefore, appointed
J. K. Henry, solicitor of the sixth
circuit, to represent the state's interests.
No better selection could
liae been made. Mr. Henry .s not
only a high-toned Christian gentleman,
but an able, upright lawyer,
who will discharge the duties devolving
upon him with fearless courage
and at the same time will safeguard
the rights of the accused.
THK CAUSE OF HOMICIDES.
The Augusta Chr 'cle of yester
day, in an editorial ariicle on "The
concealed deadly weapon," quotes as
follows from a charge of Judge
Parker to the grand jury at Waycross,
Ga:
"At least 7.r> per cent of the homicides
of the present day are the result
of violations of the law against
carrying concealed weapons.
"I know of nothing today that is
causing more crime than the cowardly
habit of carrying concealed
weapons. The moment a man sticks
a gun under his coat he puts society
on notice that he is prepared for
trouble. lie virtually says, "Don't
bother me. I am armed for you.'
In my opinion many of the crimes of
the present time would never be committed
if the pistol-toting habit could
be stopped. A man Hies off the handle,
and if he has a gun he'll use it.
Then he is sorry, as a rule, but it is
too late. A human life has been
t.aken."
We ask all gun-toters, both of high
and low degree, to consider and
it'oioh u-oll i ho oKrvvn InnO'lt'iPP Thft
man who carries a pistol in violation
of law concealed about his person,
no matter who he is, is a menace to
the peace and order of his community.
That was a neat Dodge the opponents
of woman's suffrage gave the
other crowd when they appeared yesterday
before the house rules committee
of Congress to argue against
the ballot being given to their se\
Hut the suffragettes will likely exclaim
Shaw.
Governor Hlease went out of his
way. as usual, in his speech at Anderson
to cast slurs at President Wilson,
charging hint with leaning too
much to negroes in his appointments
m i?iih-?-. i his [ mill's wiiii poor Rrsn1
from a governor who is turning them
out of the penitentiary by the wholesale.
And Blease is a candidate for
the United States senate. If elected,
what good could he hope to accomplish,
not being in harmony with the
Democratic President?
