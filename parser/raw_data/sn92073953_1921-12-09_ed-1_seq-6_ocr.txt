the special session of the 1921 Legis
lature which convenes here Tuesday,
December sixth, give publicity to the
stow that one of -the first bills will
be a proposal to lay the m ound work
for the abolishment of capital pun
ishment in North Carolina.
That the bill will be introduced at
the special session is an assured fact
1 . ..
f these first arrivals know what they
are talking about, and they say they
do. It is learned from an authorita
tive source that the bill is now in
the making will be ready when the
jseeskm opens next week so that there
will be no delay in getting it before
itne proper committee for eonsiib'ra-
tion.
While the name of the member
who will sponsor the bill has not
liotn made known at this time it will
re tell the newspapers soon. There is
some reason to believe that the bill
will be introduced in both houses of
the Legislature simultaneously. The
society tor consolidating opposition
to capital punishment, organized in
this State several years ago but
which never increased its member
ship to any great extent, is expected
to lend the influence of its member
ship to the proposed change in the
criminal code of the State.
The Legislature itself, of course,
cannot do away with capital punish
ment. It can only be changed by a
popular vote of all the people. And
the Legislature may authorize the
submission of an amendment which
will change the State constitution,
substituting life imprisonment for
capital punishment, . if it so desires.
This is what the abolitionists hope
to have the special session do.
Some legislators who are opposed
to amending the constitution are pre
paring to combat the argument of the
I abolitionists and have called upon
the legislative reference librarian,
Henry M. London, to compile data
regarding States which have rejected
a proposal to change that part of
the constitution relating to capital
punishment. This data will be avail
able when the legislators reach the
capital.
Two States, it is learned, which
did away with capital punishment
have since gone back to it. Tennessee
was one of these the record showing
that crime including lynchings in
creased under the change.
Warnings are now being sent out
by the State department of insurance
to beware of noticeable efforts to sell
securities of the town of Warsaw,
Poland, and other Polish municipal
ities, and also bonds of the Republic
of Poland. This "literature" has bee,n
seen by the insurance department ot-
ficials in Wilmington, Greensboro and
Morgantown and in Raleigh.
These Warsaw bonds, 10,000-mark
denominations, are offered for $19.85
ash. "The people offering the bonds,"
the department says, "very frankly
State that it is a gamble but they
produce signed statements from Po
lish consul-generals, etc., declaring
that the bonds are good and will be
redeemed at par and are trying to
make everybody believe that the
Polish mark, formerly worth about
20 cents, will eventually go to par
and thus make the holders very weal
thy. They figure it out that the in
vestor will make $119 for every dol
lar invested.
"Investors should not lose sight
of the fact that at present rates of
exchange the value of the mark is so
low that 10,000 of them are worth
only $2.85, instead of $19.85 and
there is not the slightest probability
that the mark will go higher. If any
investor is bent on acquiring securi
ties of this class there Is no reason
why he should pay the promoters of
this new 'skin game' a profit of 69$
percent on each bond. His certified
check for $19.85 should purchase ap
proximately 70,000 marks instead."

PRESIDENT DELIVERS
MESSAGE.
Washington, Dec. 5. The federal
budget for the fiscal year 1923 the
first to be compiled shows estimated
expenditures of $3,505,754,727, a
decrease of $462,167,639 as compar
ed to the estimated outgo for the fis
cal year 1922, ending next June 30,
and a reduction of $2,032,285,962
from the actual outlay in the fiscal
year 1921,
Estimated receipts for 1923 are
placed at $3,338,182,750, leaving an
apparent deficit of $167,571,977. In
transmitting the budget to Congress
today, President Harding says "ways
are provided r the relatively easj
adjustment" of the discrepancy be
.tween income and outgo "without
added taxation." As one means he re
commends legislation directing the
reduction of the naval supply account
by $100,000,000.
Actual appropriations asked of
Congress for the various federal de
partments and agencies fer 1923 to
tal $3,224,875,592, exclusive of
Postoffice Department. This repre
sents a reduction of $122,806,310
from the original estimated as pre
sented to the budget bureau, it is
stated, but is approximately $27,000,
000 more than the appropriations for
this fiscal year.
Explaining the $280,879,134 ex
cess of estimated expenditures in
1923 over the appropriations asked
for, Budget Bureau officials explain
that some of the funds actually to be
put out will be carried over in con
tinuing appropriations and by other
means. They say that appropriations
for a given year do not accurately
reflect actual expenses for that year,
pointing out that while the appropria
tions for this fiscal year were $3,
197,807,962, the estimated actual
outgo will exceed this sum by appro
ximately $770,000,000.
Of the total estimated expenditures
for, 1923, approximately $2,900,000,'
000 is to pay for past wars and to
keep up the fighting arms of the
government, leaving only about $600,
000,000 for the peace-time pursuits
of the federal establishment. The
estimate for the army and the navy
is. $801,636,107, a reduction of $66,-
305, 299 as compared with this fiscal
year, and $956,352,741 aa compared
with the fiscal year 1921.
The nary estimate of $431,754,000
it is explained, doea not take into ac
count any possible reductions ' that
might be brought about as a result
of the arms conference, the total in
cluding funds for continuing work on
the ships of the 1916 program, most
of which would be scrapped under
the proposal made to the conference
by the American government.
Accompanying the budget as sent
to Congress is a detailed report from
Director General Dawes as to the op-
eration of the budget bureau since its i can be imposed by the Chief Execu

General Dawes says he feels that

based "will not be increased except ana aeceniranzuuun.

Reiterating his recommendation
that Congress immediately repeal all
outstanding continuous appropria

Dawes says the method of appropriat
ing money heretofore followed "hasi
resulted in a condition of things un-

either the executive, Congress, or the their PrPer Preservation in their ap

condition of the government at anyi

"The whole habit of making con
tinuous appropriations to which the
government has been committed in
the past," he adds, "is only an en
couragement to a lack of scrutiny of
public work by the head of the de
partment under which it is carried
on, and an encouragement to Bhift

of the subordinates more directs

able Congress, with more intelligence,
to determine at any time both the
necessity for retrenchment and the
ability of the Government to engage
in additional projects to be initiated
by Congress outside of the budgetary
provisions."
Likening the federal government to
a business corporation, General
Dawes points to these "faults" which
he says existed:
The President of the corporation
(the President of the United States)
gave practically no attention to its
ordinary routine business.
The administrative vice-presidents
(members of the cabinet) were allow
ed to run their several departments
as if each separate department was
an independent authority in all mat
ters of routine business.
Because of a lack of any outlined
business plan, no system existed for
making purchases or in selling mater -
ial along business lines under a uni-
fled policy.
No balance sheet of the corporation
as a whole was ever nrenared.
The treasurer kept no accurate ac
count of the contingent obligations of
the various federal departments,
thus resulting in money being drawn
from him continuously in excess of
the estimated annual running ex

qualifications and were compelled to
rely largely upon the advice of sub -
ordinates "wedded to the theory, of
the right of independent operation of
the department."
Outlining the work of the various
coordinating agencies established by
Presidential order "to rectify faults
Jin the routine business of the goverr-
ment;, General Dawes says:
"They involve no transfer of auth
ority the location of which has been
fixed otherwise by statute.
"They involve the delegation of no
questions of policy save that of eco
nomy and efficiency.
"They are simply agents by which
