tion.a single postal territory embracing the world,
with complete uniformity of postal charges, and
conditions of international exchange, for all de
scriptions of correspondence. To enable the
United States to do its full share of this great
work, additional legislation is asked by the post
master-general, tc whose recommendations espe
cial attention is called.
The suggestion of the postmaster-general, that
it would be wise to encourage, by appropriate leg
islation. the establishment of American lines of
steamers by our own citizens, to carry the mails
between our own ports and those of Mexico, Cen
tral America. South America, and of trans-Pacifie
countries, is commended to the serious considera
tion of congress.
The attention ot congress is also invited to the
suggestions of the postmaster-general in regard to
postal savings.
SUPREME COURT.
The necessity for additional provision, to aid in
the transaction of the business of the federal
courts, becomes each year more apparent. The
dockets of the supreme court, and of the circuit
courts, in the greater number of the circuits, are
encumbered with the constant accession of cases
In the former court, and in many instances in the
circuit courts, years intervene before it is practi
cable to bring cases to hearing.
The attorney general recommends the establish
ment of an intermediate court of errors and ap
peals. It is recommended that the number of
judges of the circuit court in each circuit with the
exception of the second circuit, should be increased
by the addition of another judge; in the second
circuit that two should be added: and that an in
termediate appellate court should be formed in
each circuit, to consist of the circuit judges and
the circuit justice, and that in the event of the
absence of either of these judges the place of the
absent judge should be supplied by the judge of
one of the district courts in the circuit. Such an
appellate court could be safely invested with large
jurisdiction, and its decisions would satisfy suitors
in many cases where appeals would still be al
lowed to the supreme court. The expense in
curred for this intermediate court, will require a
very moderate increase of the approprations for
the expenses of the department of justice. Tliis
recommendation is commended to the careful
consideration of congress.
It is evident that a delay of justice, in many in
stances oppressive and disastrous to suitors, now
necessarily occurs iu the federal courts, which
will iu this way will be remedied.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The report of the secretary of the interior, pre
sents an elaborate account of the operations of
that department during the past year. It gives
me great pleasure to say that our Indian affairs
appear to he in a more hopeful condition now
than ever before. The Indians have made grati
fying progress in agriculture, herding, and me
chanical pursuits. Many who were a few years
ago in hostile conflict with the government arc
quietly settling down on farms where they hope
to make their permanent homes, building houses
and engaging in the occupations of civilized
life. The introduction of the freighting business
among them has been remarkably fruitful of good
results, in giving many of them congenial em
ployment, and in stimulating their ambition to
cam their own support. Their honesty, fidelity
and efficiency as carriers are highly praised. The
organization of a police force of Indians, lias
been equally successful in maintaining law and
order upon the reservations, and in exercising a
wholesome moral influence among the Indians
themselves. I concur with the secretary of the
interior in the recommendation that the pay of
this force be increased, as an inducement to the
best class of young men to enter it.
Much care and attention has boon devoted to
the enlargement of educational facilities for the
Indians. The moans available for this important
object have been very inadequate. A few addi
tional boarding schools at Indian agencies have
been established, and the erection of building has
been begun for several more, but an increase of
the appropriations for this interesting under
taking is greatly needed to accomoda te the large
number of Indian children of school-age. The
number offered by their parents from all parts of
the country for education in the government
schools is much larger than can be accommodated
with the means at present available for that pur
pose. The number of Indian pupils at the Nor
mal school at Hampton, Va., under the direction
of Gen. Armstrong, lias been considerably in
creased, and their progress is highly encouraging.
The Indian school established by the interior de
partment in 1879, at Carlisle, Pa., under the di
rection of Captain Pratt, has been equally suc
cessful. it has now nearly two hundred pupils of
both sexes, representing a great variety of the
tribes cast of the Rocky Mountains. The pupils
in both these institutions receive not only an ele
mentary English education; but arc also instructed
in housework, agriculture and useful mechanical
pursuits. A similar school was established this
year at Forest Grove, Ore., for the education of
Indian youth on the Pacific coast. Tu addition to
this, thirty-six Indian buys and girls were
selected from the eastern Cherokees and
placed in boarding-schools iu North Carolina,
where they are to receive an elementary English
education and training in industrial pursuits. The
interest shown by Indian parents, even among the
so-called wild tribes, in the education of their
children, is very gratifying, and gives promise
that the results accomplished by the efforts now
making will be of lasting benefit.
The expenses of Indian education have so far
been drawn from the permanent civilization-fund
at the disposal of the depa -tment of the interior;
but the fund is now so much reduced that the con
tinuance of this beneficial work will in future de
pend on specific appropriations by congress for
the purpose, and I venture to express the hope
that congress will not permit institutions so fruit
ful of good results to perish for want of mcaus
for their support. On the contrary, an increase
of the number of such schools appears to me
highly advisable.
The past year has been unusually free from dis
turbances among the Indian tribes. An agree
ment has been made with the Utes. by which they
surrender their large reservation in Colorado in
consideration of an annuity to be paid to them,
arid agree to settle in severalty ou certain lauds
designated for that purpose, as fanners, holding
individual title to their land in fee-simple,inalien
able for a certain period. In this way a costly
Indian war has been avoided, which, at one time,
seemed imminent, and, for the first time in the his
tory of the country, an Indian nation has given
up its tribal existence to be settled in severalty,
and to live as individuals under the common pro
tection of the laws of the country. The conduct
of the Indians throughout the country, during
the past year, with but few noteworthy exceptions,
has been orderly and peaceful. The guerilla war
fare carried on for two years by Victoria and his
band of southern Apaches, has virtually come to
an end by the death of that chief and most of his
followers, on Mexican soil. The disturbances
caused on our northern frontier by Sitting Bull
and bis men, who had taken refuge in the British
dominions, arc also likely to cease. A large ma
jority of his followers have surrendered to our
military forces, and the remainder are apparently
in progress of disintegration.
I concur with the secretary of the interior in
expressing the earnest hope that congress will at
this session take favorable action on the bill pro
viding for the allotment of lauds ou the different
reservations in severalty tu the Indians, with pat
ents conferring fee simple title inalienable for a
certain period, and the eventful disposition of the
residue of the reservations, for general settlement,
with the consent and for the benefit of the Indi
ans. placing the latter under the equal protection
of the laws of the country. This measure, to
gether with a vigorous prosecution of our educa
tional efforts will work the most important and
effective advance toward the solution of the Indi
an problem, in preparing for the gradual merging
of our Indian population in the great body ot
American citizenship.
5 |aobicultcke.
The commissioner of agriculture expresses the
confident belief that his efforts in the production
of our own sugar and tea have been encouraging
ly rewarded. The importance of the results at
tained have attracted marked attention at home,
Sind have received the special consideration of
foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our
own tea, and the manufacture of our own sugar,
would make a difference of many millions of dol
lars annually in the wealth of the nati ,n.
The report of the commissioner asks attention
particularly to the continued prevalence of an in
t’ectnous and contagious cattle-disease, known and
Jreadcdin Europe and Asia, as cattle-plague, or
pleuro-pneumonia. A mild type of this disease,
in certain sections of our country, is the occasion
of great loss to our farmers, and of serious dis
turbance to our trade with Great Britain, which
furnishes a market for most of our live-stock and
dressed meats. The value of neat-cattle export
ed from the United States for the eight months
ended August 31,1550, was more than twelve mil
lion dollars, and nearly double the value for the
same period in 1879, an unexampled increase of
export trade. Your early attention is solicited
to this important matter.
PUBUC LANDS.
A large increase is reported in the disnosal of
the public lands for settlement during the past
year, which marks the prosperous growth of our
agricultural industry, and a vigorous movement
of population toward our unoccupied lands. As
this movement proceeds, the codification of our
land laws, as well as proper legislation to regulate
the disposition of public lands, become of more
pressing necessity, and I therefore invite the con
sideration of congress to the report and the ac
companying draft ot a bill, made by the public
lands commission, which were communicated by
me to congress at the last session. Early action
upon this important subject is highly desirable.
The attention of congress is again asked to the
wasteful depredations committed on our public
timber lands, and the rapid and indiscriminate de
struction of our forests. The urgent necessity
for legislation to this end is now generally rec
ognized. In view of the lawless character of the
depredations committed, and the disastrous conse
quences which will inevitably follow their contin
uance, legislation has again and again been reo-
uauneiuleil to arrest tbo evil, and to preserve for
the people of our western states and territories,
the timber needed for domestic and other essential
uses.
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.
The report of the director of the geological sur
vey is a document of unusual interest. The con
solidation of the various geological and geograph
ical surveys and exporting enterprises, each of
which has heretofore operated on an independent
plan, without concert, cannot fail to be of great
benefit to all those industries o: the country
which depend upon the development of our min
eral resources. The labors of our scientific men.
of recognized merit, who compose the corps of
geological survey, during the first season of their
field operations and inquiries, seems to have been
very comprehensive, and will soon be communi
cated to congress in a number of volumes. The
director of the survey recommends that the in
vestigations carried on by his bureau, which, so
far. have been confined to the so-called public
land states and territories, be extended over the
entire count rj, and that the necessary appropria
tion be made for this purpose. This would be. par
ticularly beneficial to the iron, coal and other
mining interests of the Mississippi valley, and of
the eastern and southern states. The subject is
commended to the careful consideration of con
gress.
PUPLIC BUILDINGS.
The secretary of the interior asks attention to
the want of room in the public buildings of the
capital, now existing and in progress of construc
tion, for the accommodation of the clerical force
employed, and of the public records. Necessity
lias compelled the renting of private buildings in
differentjparts of the city for the location of pub
lic offices for which a large amount of rent is an
nually paid, while the separation of offices belong
ing to the same departments impedes the trans
action of current business. The secretary sug
gests that the blocks surrounding Lafayette
square, on the east, north and west, be purchased
as the sites for uew edifices, for the accommoda
tion of the government offices, leaving the square
itself intact; and that, if such buildings were con
structed upon a harmonious plan of architecture,
they would add much to the beauty of the na
tional capital, and would, together with the
treasury and the new state, navy, and war de
partmentbuilding, form one of the most imposing
groups of public edifices in the world.
EDUCATION.
The commissioner of education reports a con
tinued increase of public interest in educational
affairs, and that me public schools generally
throughout the country arc well sustained. In
dustrial training is attracting observed attention,
and colleges for instruction, theoretical and prac
tical, in agriculture and the mechanic arts, in
cluding the government schools recently establish
ed for the instruction of Indian youth, are gain
ing steadily in public estimation. The commis
sioner asks special attention to the depredations
committed on the, lands reserved for the future
support of public instruction, and to the very
great need of help from the nation for schools in
the territories and in the southern states. The
recommendation heretofore made, is repeated and
urged, that an educational fund be set apart from
the net proceeds of the sales of the public lands
annually, the income of which, and the remainder
of the net annual proceeds, to bo distributed ou
some satisfactory plan to the states and territories
and the District of Columbia.
The success of the public schools of the District
of Columbia, and the progress made, under *he
intelligent direction of the board of education and
the superintendent, iu supplying the educational
requirements of the District, with thoroughly
trained and efficient teachers, is very gratifying.
The acts of congress, from time to time, donating
public lands to the several states and territories
in aid <>f educational interests, have proved to be
wise measures of public policy, resulting in great
and lasting benefit. It would seem to be a matter
of simple justice to extend the benefits of this leg
islation, the wisdom of which has been so fully
vindicated by experience. t> the District of Colum
bia.
1 again commend the general interests of the
District of Columbia to the favorable considera
tion of congress. The affairs of the district, as
shown by the report of the commissioners, are in
a very satisfactory condition.
AOTOMAC MARSHES.
In my annual messages heretofore, and iu my
special message of December 19, 1879, I have
urged upon congress the necessity of reclaiming
the marshes of the Potomac adjacent to the
capital, and lam constrained by its importance
to advert again to the subject. These flats em
brace an area of several hundred acres. They
are an impedlent to the drainage of the city and
seriously impair its health. It is believed that,
with tliis substantial improvement of tis river
front, the capital w< aid be, in all respects, one of
the most attractive cities in the world. Aside
from its permanent population, this city is nec
essarily the place of residence of persons from
ever section of the country, engaged in the pub
lic service. Many others reside here temporarily,
for the transaction of business with the govern
ment.
It should not be forgotten that the land ac
quired will probably be worth the cost of redeem
ing it, and that the navigation of the river will be
greatly improved. I therefore again invite the at
tention of congress to the importance of prompt
provision for this much-needed and too-loug-de
iayed improvement.
The water supply of the city is inadequate. In
addition to the ordinary use throughout the city,
the consumption by government is necessarily
very great in the navy-yard, arsenal, and the va
rious departments, and a large quantity is re
quired for the proper preservation of the numer
ous parks and the cleansing of sewers. I recom
mend that this subject receive the early atten
tion of congress, and that, in * making
provision for an increased supply,
such means be adopted as will have
in view the future growth of the city. Tempor
ary expedients for such a purpose cannot but be
wasteful of money, and therefore unwise. A more
ample reservoir, with corresponding facilities for
keeping it filled, should, in my judgement, be
constructed. I commend again to the attention
of congress the subject of the removal, of their
present location, of the depots of the several rail
roads entering the city: and I renew the recom
mendations of my former messages in behalf o
the erection of a building for the congressiona
library, the completion of the Washington Mon
ument, and of liberal appropriations iii support
of the benevolent reformatory, and penal institu
tions of the district.
