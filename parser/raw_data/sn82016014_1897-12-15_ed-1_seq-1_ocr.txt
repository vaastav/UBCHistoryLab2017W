Topeka liable to See a Legal
Hanging
If J. S. Leach is Convicted of
Murder
IN THE FEDERALCOURT
lie Killed Corporal TbomasFen
nell With a Rat.
Likely to be Hanged in tho
County Jail Yard.
J. S. Leach was today held by United
States Commissioner George W. Clark
for murder in the first degree. He will
be tried in Topeka next April and if ho
is convicted there will be a legal hang
ing in Topeka.
Leach was a private at Fort Riley
and the story of the murder with which
lie is charged is revolting in its bru
tality. He killed Corporal Thomas
Kennell. The evidence is so conclusive
that there is little doubt of his convic
tion. Judge Clark said after the hear
ing that Leach would be held without
bail to answer before the federal grand
Jury which meets in Topeka on the sec
ond Monday in April. District Attor
ney Lambert said that he will be tried
in Topeka in April.
The crime was committed at Fort
Riley and consequently Leach must be
tried in the federal court. The penalty
for murder in the first degree in the
United States court is hanging and the
only thing that will save Topeka from
a legal hanging will be the conviction
of Leach of murder in some lower de
gree which is not likely.
While the I'nited States marshal would
have to preside at an execution here it
would probably take place in the coun
ty jail yard. It has been many years
since there has been a legal execution
in Topeka or Kansas because the law
punishing crime with death is inopera
tive. TOM TIRES OF TALK.
Says the Stories Abant His Ap
pointment Sound Flimsy.
Major T. J. Anderson today denied
the report that he had tendered his
resignation as assistant general pas
senger agent of the Rock Island,
which appeared in a Kansas City morn
ing paper. He said that he had not
tendered his resignation and did not in
tend to, and that there was absolutely
ro ground for the report.
"All this talk about me is getting
tiresome." said Major Anderson this
morning. "I have no more idea of get
ting the appointment as governor o?
the Soldiers' home or United States
marshal than I have of going to heaven
in a handbasket after the manner of
Klijah, and the nearest I come to such
a trip is the fact that both Elijah and
I belong to the baldheaded fraternity.
I'm not a fixer and consequently not
In it. and I don't expect to be struck
by any stray bolts of lightning."
STERNE IS CONFIDENT.
Does Not Belisvo Andarsoa Will b9
Used to Turn Him Down.
Senator W. K. Sterne is placidly
watching the contest for the office i f
United States marshal now going: on
In Washington but declines to accept
any opinion contrary to the belief that
he will secure the position.
Being asked today if he had received
any information from the national cap
ital. Mr. Sterne said:
"Not a word. I know nothing about
the fight except what I have seen print
ed in the various papers, but I believe
I will get the place. Everything is
encouraging at this time, despite thj
fact that a bitter fight is being made
against me. I think Senator Baker
will stand by his recommendations and
if he does that, there can be but one
result and that will be my confirma
tion upon the recommendation of the
president."

Xew York. Dec. 15. Before the two

legation at which the national airs
were played and speeches of a patriotic
character made.

The Tax on the Tickets is a Source cf

Berlin. Dec. 15. The magnitude of the
profits of Germany's five state lotteries
makes the anti-gamblers despair of suc
cess in their demands for their suppres
sion. The tax on each ticket sold will.
In 1ST. bring more than lS.W.OOO marks.
The private lotteries add several millions.

WON'T PAY THE PRICE.
Union Pacific Doesn't Care About the
Kansas Branch Anyhow.
Chicago, Dec. 15. The Post's Wash
ington special says: A report repre
sentative of the Union Pacific reorga
nization committee is given as author
ity for the statement that the Union
Pacific will not buy the Kansas Pacific
at the price the government will insist
on being paid. Asked if it would be
possible for the company to parallel
the Kansas Pacific the reply was given
that the scheme was practicable, but
that the paralleling would be done at
a cost less than one-third what it would
be required to buy the Kansas Pacific.
The additional information was fur
nished that it would only be necessary
to build three miles of the road from
Colby to the Denver Central and that
an advantageous contract couid be en
tered into with the Missouri Pacific for
the use of their tracks and Kansas City
terminals. It was very clear from the
Bentlerann's conversation that the Un
ion P'aciric combination is feeling inde
pendent in this matter and that it does
not care a great deal who gets the Kan
sas Pacific.
13 cities vote.

Boston, Dec. 15. Municipal elections
were held yesterday in 13 cities of the
state, thus completing the list with the
exception of Boston and Xorth Adams,
which do not choose their municipal of
ficers until next week. The contests in
several instances were sharp over local
matters but in many cases strict party
lines were ignored in making the nomi
nations. Xot one of the 13 cities reversed the
license vote of last year, seven of them
voting in favor of license and six
against. In Cambridge, which for
many years was the banner no license
city, the no license majority was re
duced from 1.SS1 last year to 375. The
total vote cast on the license question
this year in 30 of the 32 cities was 158,
120, divided as follows: Yeas 81,615;
noes 76.505.
Last year the same cities cast 159,841
votes, of which 84,076 were yeas and
75,765 noes.
ANOTHER FRAUD SHUT OUT
Trading Stamps Illegal Merchants
Preyed Oa Buyers Deceived.
Washington, Dec. 15. The court of
appeals in an opinion written by Mr.
Justice Shepherd, has affirmed the
judgment of the police court in what
is known as "the trading stamp case."
The opinion of the court, which was
an unanimous one, says that, although
most shrewdly planned, of the many
devices to obtain something for noth
ing, the trading stamp enterprise could
hardly have become more clearly with
in the scope of the statute prohibiting
gift enterprises, had it been well known
and expressly stated in the contempla
tion of congress at the time of its en
actment. Further on, the court says:
"The Washington Trading Stamp
company and its agents are not mer
chants engaged in business as that
term is commonly understood. They are
not dealers in ordinary merchandise
engaged in a legitimate attempt to ob
tain purchasers for their goods by of
fering fair and lawful inducements to
trade. Their business is the exploita
tion of nothing more or less than a cun
ning device.
"With no stock in trade but that de
vice and the necessary books and
stamps and so-called premiums with
which to operate it successfully, they
have intervened in the legitimate busi
ness carried on in the District of Co
lumbia between seller and buyer, not
for the advantage of either, but to prey
on both. They sell nothing to the per
son to whom they furnish the premi
ums. They pretend simply to act for
his benefit and advantage by forcing
their stamps on a perhaps unwilling
merchant who pays them in cash at the
rate of $5 a thousand. There is not a
shadow of rational foundation for the
stamp company's claim that it confers
a benefit upon buyers by procuring
for them an actual discount."
HANNA IS LIVELY.
Says He Will be Found So When
He Gets to Washington.
Xew York, Dec. 15. Senator Mark
A. Hanna today laughed at all reports
from Washington that his health would
compel him to go to Europe, even if he
should be re-elected to the senate.
"I am going to Washington and they
will find me pretty lively," said Mr.
Hanna.
"I have been ill for three weeks but I
feel much better now."
Mr. Hanna spoke confidently of the
outlook in Washington. He believes
that the tariff will yield sufficient reve
nue for the needs of the government. He
does not see why legislation allowing
national banks to increase their issues
in accordance with the suggestion in
the president's message cannot be en
acted. PUGILISTIC QUIBBLE.

SHAMEFUL ACT.
Thirty-four Beautiful Trees in
Garfield Park
Cut Down for Use as Firewood
by the Paramores.
Vandalism is Result of Spite
aud Hatred
BECAUSE OF THE SALE
Of a Three-fourths Interest in
the Park
To Marshall's Band a Few Days
Ago.
Garfield park is being shorn of the
natural beauty it possesses by the
work of a vandal. Thirty-four good
sized trees in various portions of the
park have been cut down and chopped
into fire wood, and the appearance of
the park has been greatly damaged.
This week the three-quarter interest
in the park property was purchased by
Marshall's band. The band intends
making a beautiful park of it and giv
ing summer concerts and entertain
ments. The public is to have the ben
efit of going there for picnics free of
charge. The remaining one-fourth in
terest in the property is held by G. "W.
Paramore, a Paramore heir and son
of A. J. Paramore. Mr. Paramore sev
eral months ago built a small unpaint
ed frame house in the west part of the
park, south of the main entrance, and
is occupying it. This he claims as his
"homestead," and he hopes to ward off
legal foreclosure proceedings which
will probably be instituted against him
soon. On this state of affairs the
band officers have decided to ask their
legal rights in the matter.
The trees in Garfield park are not
any too plentiful. Cutting them down
at random is not calculated to Im
prove the appearance or utility of it.
Not over 100 feet east of the Kansas
avenue fence the work of destruction
has been carried on. Especially in the
east part of the park near the water's
edge has the vandalism been practiced.
In the west half of the park ten good
sized trees were cut down. Most of
these have been cut very recently, as
the wood is not yet discolored by the
weather. Around the band stand with
in a radius of 100 feet, trees have been
taken out wherever two or more stood
near. One large tree, two feet in diam
eter at the base, which rose majestical
ly by the side of the band stand and
spread its limbs and branches over the
stand in a graceful umbrella shape, has
been brought low. Evidently the axe
used in this operation was a dull one,
and the one who' used it must have
been in a great hurry. The stump re
maining looks as if a huge animal had
gnawed it off.
South and west of the stand, and or.
a line toward the Paramore house, the
heaviest destruction has been dt-'Jie.
Clumps of trees in this part were taken
out, and only the rough stumps re
main to show what once were beauti
ful trees. Near the old boat house,
northeast of the band stand, an im
mense tree was cut down but very re
cently. However, all around the house
the trees are missing. In the north
part huge limbs were trimmed off and
cut into fire wood. On the creek bank
where trees are most needed and are
the prettiest the vandal has gotten in
his work of spite. In all, 34 trees, vary
ing in diameter from seven inches to
two feet, have been cut down. All the
wood thus obtained was cut up into fire
wood. A large log still lies in the
north part of the park which has been
used as a chopping block for the fall
en trees. Street car conductors say
they have seen Mr. Paramore storing
away green wood at his shanty. One
of them said today:
"For the last two or three days Par
amore has had a lot of green wood at
his back door. It was chopped up for
burning."
Marshall's band has filed a suit in the
district court asking that a receiver be
appointed for the park for the purpose
of preventing Mr. Paramore from de
stroying the trees in the park. The pe
tition sets forth that the defendant has
destroyed trees there without the per
mission of the present owners of a
three-fourths interest.
One of the band officers said today:
"We had to bring suit in order to
protect ourselves. We want to make
the park a beautiful place. It seems
that this man Paramore. for pure spite,
has been cutting down trees there and
taking the wood to burn. We want our
rights in the matter. Paramore will
probably lose his interest in the park
next spring, and I suppose he wanted
to get all he could out of it. It is a
shame and a disgrace to do such a
thing, for we want to give the people
of Topeka a first class park, where
they can enjoy our concerts and sum
mer entertainments. With trees cut
down all over the park, we cannot do it
and for this reason we will ask for
our legal rights of Judge Hazen."

through Pittsburg early this morning en
route from Canton, O., to Washington.
Twenty minutes after the train left Can

killed Louis Moinet, a laborer walking on
the track. His head was torn from his
body.
The president was much disturbed at
the distressing accident so soon after the
sad ordeal of the day. When the train
reached Pittsburg the curtains were all
closely drawn and everybody within was
asleep.

NEW YORK PRIMARIES.
20,000 Republican Voter3 Turn Oat
in Spite of the Storra.
New York, Dec. 15. Republican pri
maries were held in the various election
districts in this city last night and the
returns indicate that something like
20.000 people cast their ballots, notwith
standing the storm.
In the great majority of assembly
districts the regularly nominated tick
ets were returned, many of them with
out opposition.
Very few of the anti-regulars took
any part in the primaries. Some con
tests occurred, however, between the
conservatives and the radical factions
of the regular Republican organization
- the former favoring conciliation with
the Brookfleld faction and against the
return of L. E. Quigg to the county
committee and the latter favoring Mr.
Quigg's re-election.
In the sixth assembly district there
was a warm contest between the Wag
ner adherents and those of James E.
Marsh. Although the Wagner delega
tion voted against Quigg's election at
the last annual meeting of the county
committee, it is claimed that faction is
now with the organization, and Wag
ner won the fight. '. In the same way in
the 21st district the" supporters of Quigg
won.
In the 23d assembly district, however.
Justice M. Mayer won a signal victory
over Moses K. MeKee. who is recog
nized by Mr. Quigg as the caucus mem
ber. This district will send an anti
Quigg delegation to the county conven
tion, i

MILLION DOLLAR CARGO
Of Seal Skins and Arctic furs Secured
by a Russian Ship.
San Francisco. Dec. 15. One million dol
lars is the estimated value of the cargo
of the Russian barkentine Bering, which
arrived in port yesterday. The cargo
represents the major portion of the busi

By far the most important item shown on
the manifest is the consignment of seal
skins. Of these there are T.OiX). There are
several hundred bear skins, all of the
finest quality. and a large number of skins
of almost all the animals found in the
Arctic regions.

CAUGHT IN KANSAS.
Third of the Conway Kidnapers Cap
tured at Riley.
Albany, N. Y., Dec. 13. Chief Willard
has received a message from Detective
McCann, announcing the capture of Al
bert S.Warner at Riley, Kansas. War
ner was the chief conspirator in the
kidnaping of little Johnny Conway
last August. N. C. Blake and Joseph
M. Hardy are now serving terms of 15
years in Dannemora prison for complic
ity in the crime.
Kansas City, Dec. 15. Albert S. War
ner, the Albany, N. Y. lawyer, captured
at Riley, Kan., charged with complicity
in the kidnaping of young Conway at
Albany, N. Y., last August, was brought
to Kansas City this morning and will
remain at the city jail until requisition
papers shall arrive from New York.
Warner was found on a farm belong
ing to a man named Goodrich, three
miles from Riley. After a chase of
nearly four months in Georgia, Tennes
see, Minnesota and New Mexico, he was
run to earth by Joseph McCann, of the
Albany detective force, together with a
Pinkerton detective named Thomas.
When approached Warner gave his
name as George Johnson and protested
he had never worked at any other occu
pation than that of a farm hand. On
his way to Junction City, where he was
taken temporarily from Riley, Warner
broke down and admitted his identity.
At first he expressed a willingness to
go on to New York, without requisition
papers, but when he crossed the Mis
souri line this morning he changed his
mind and declined to go further with
out being forced to.
Warner's makeup as a farm hand is
an excellent one. He is dressed in a
suit of jeans with a yellow canvas
jumper and a thick woolen cap. His
face is covered with a thick growth of
red beard. In spite of his disguise,
however, certain lines of refinement in
his face betrayed him as a man of ed
ucation, and led to his arrest.
When questioned by a reporter after
his arrival in Kansas City. Warner
said: "1 expect to meet a lot of you
newspaper fellows, so I have made up
my mind to talk."
Later Warner told briefly how 'lie had
escaped from the east and eluded the
officers so long. He had been in hiding
in Jersey City for some time, he said,
and becoming tired of his concealment,
decided to give himself up. On the way
to the station the sight of a bicycle on
a curbing opened up an avenue of es
cape. He stole the wheel and rode to
Philadelphia. After a short time in
that city, he started west making his
way to Kansas on his wheel by easy
stages. He claims to have been at Ri
ley for seven weeks.
At Riley he passed as George John
son. Warner and two pals kidnaped the
6-year-old son of John Conway, a
wealthy Albany citizen, last August
and held him for $3,000 ransom. His
pals, Joseph Hardy, a brother-in-law of
John Conway and John Blake were
soon captured.
A JAIL DELIVERY.
A Green Populist in Old Rich
ard Boyd's Place Lets
Prisoners Escape.
Four city prisoners made a break for
liberty this marning as Watchman
Roberts was taking the stone pile gang
to work. They were successful. At
eight o'clock when the prisoners were
called for work. Watchman Roberts
started with them toward the jail yard.
When in the yard Harvey Enix, col
ored, James McGinnis, Ij. R. Smith and
Al Casey ran toward the patrol barn.
Roberts shouted to them to halt, but
they paid no attention to him. Being
with the other prisoners he could not
give chase. He blew his whistle which
called other officers. But the four pris
oners had run through the barn and
north in the alley. They maflie a rapid
escape and have not since been cap
tured. They were last heard from at
Shorey. Roberts was appointed a
short time ago by the police board.
He had never had experience in this
line of work and the prisoners watched
their chance for escape. He took the
position formerly held by Richard
Boyd, the faithful old guard who had
been on duty there so long, and who
was discharged for political reasons.
Sunday night burglars attempted to
get into the residence of Armin Fass
ler at 522 West Tenth street, but two
dogs which are allowed to sleep in the
house, frightened them away.
Last evening at six o'clock the lady
in charge of the Woman's exchange at
1003 Topeka avenue, noticed a colored
man loitering about the place. She
became alarmed and went across the
street to telephone to the police. While
she was out of the store the man en
tered it and ran out the back door with
$10 taken from the money drawer. The
lady did not think to lock the front
door.
Three men were seen walking rapidly
across the state house square Monday
night about 10:30 o'clock. They each
had large bundles in their arms. It is
sup' sed that they are the ones who
burglarized the Reel store at 825 Kan
sas avenue. No arrests have been made
by the police.
The marshal at Perry arrested two
men suspected of having burglarized
a Topeka mill office and after searching
them, locked them in a room and placed
a guard over them for the night. When
the men were brought to Topeka the
men each had a large revolver suspend
ed in "his trouser leg by strings. The
Perry marshal had searched only their
pockets.
There is no finer, fresher, " richer or

WHAT AJrVASTE !
Fate of the Bottle of 100 Year
Old Whisky
Which Miss Richardson Was to
Break Over the Kentucky,
HAS C03IE TO LIGHT.
President Cleveland and Secre
tary Herbert Drank It.
Everybody iu Kentucky is
Shocked and Mad,
Especially the Man Who Fur
nished the Liquor.
NOT FOR POLITICIANS.
It Wras Contributed For Purely
Patriotic Purposes.
Wants Uis Bottle Back as a
Memento.
"Washington, Dec. 15. Another Inter
esting phase of the row over the chris
tening of the battleship Kentucky was
brought out today, when Major B. G.
Thomas, the veteran Kentucky horse
man, who gave Miss Richardson a bot
tle of whisky over 100 years old, to be
broken over the prow, wired to ascer
tain what had become of the almost
priceless liquor.
It was shown that the bottle contain
ing the highly-prized corn juice had
been sent by Miss Richardson to Hilary
A. Herbert, then secretary of the navy,
to be kept until the ship was ready to
be christened.
It also developed that Secretp.ry Her
bert and Grover Cleveland, then presi
dent of the United States, had "sam
pled" the bourbon and found it of such
rich and rare "bead" that they hail
promptly drank it all, both agreeing
that such precious stuif should not be
wasted by being poured into the Atlan
tic ocean.
This is the story of the bottle that is
told by ex-Secretary Herbert to bis
friends. He adds with a smile that the
whisky was the best that lie ever tasted
and that the president was delighted
with the tlavor. The only regret expressed-
bv either was that the bottle
was a' sm-ill one.
When news of this disposal of the li
quor Intended for the christening of the
Kentucky gets back to Louisville, there
will be probably a "hot time in the old
town."
Lexington, Ky Dec. 15. Major B. G.
Thomas, who furnished Miss Harriette
Richardson the bottle of old whisky
with which to christen the battleship
Kentucky, is mad because the whisky
has been wasted on politicians, as he
declares. Today he gave out the follow
ing pointed interview:
"I did not intend that this whisky
should be guzzled by politicians. Miss
Richardson, whose father was one of
my neighbors, came to me and asked
me for a bottle of my old whisky with
which to christen the ship. I told her
she couid have two bottles, if she want
ed them, but she replied that one was
sufficient. I gave her the bottle, under
standing that it would be broken over
the prow of the Kentucky, and that its
choice aroma would blend with the sea
foam as it dashed over the prow of the
mighty vessel when she glided into the
ocean. I find, however, that the whisky
has met its fate long ago, and will nev
er be used for the purpose for which it
was intended. Yes: that bottle of
whisky has a remarkable history. It
was distilled in a little old-fashioned
still-house, erected nearly one hundred
years ago, by a man named Cole, who
was a contemporary of Jim Gray and
Old Oscar Pepper, the earliest distillers
in Kentucky. The house stood on the
Kentucky river at Frankfort. and about
a half mile from the state house. Here
old Dan Swigert distilled this whisky.
While I was in the Confederate army it
was hidden away in the cellar of my old
friend, the late Madison C. Johnson,
where it remained until 1S70. I then
bottled it, and it has remained in the
bottle ever since, and has been in my
cellars, carefully guarded from thirsty
politicians. I sometimes treat my
friends on this rare old whisky, several
bottles of which I still have left, but I
make it a point to never allow a poli
tician to taste it. and it grieves me deep
ly to think that the bottle I gave to
Miss Richardson for patriotic purposes
has been consumed by politicians like
Mr. Herbert and Mr. Cleveland. I think
Mr. Herbert might at least return the
bottle to me. so that I may have some
reminder of the vicissitudes through
which this old liquor has passed."
A LAND3IARK BURNED.
Boston & Maine Depot at Lowell 2e

Lowell, Mass., Dec. 15. The Merrimac
street depot of the Boston & Maine
road was gutted by fire last night. The
building was constructed in 1853 and
has been to Lowell what Fanueil hall is

in the halls above.
NEW BAPTIST CHURCH
To ba Built and WiH Cost Upwards of
$25,000
The First Baptist church of this city,
now located at Ninth and Jackson
streets, is now free from debt, and the
members are considering plans for a
new edifice. The present building is in
adequate for the uses of the church.
While no definite decision has been
made, the plans of a Chicago church
have been considered favorably, and
the new church will probably be model
ed after that structure. The erection
of a handsome edifice at the corner of
Ninth and Jackson streets will add ma
terially to the appearance of that corner
and to the state house square. While
no price has been fixed by the congre
gation, it is the general opinion among
members of the congregation that the
new church should cost from $25,000 to
$35,000.
