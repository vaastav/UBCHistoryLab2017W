New Barber Shop
a Dream of Beauty
Have you seen the new Rock Island
barber shop? It's in the same old
place and J. E. Hoiioway is still holding
down his job as proprietor but all else
is so changed that you wouldn't know
the place.
Improvements which have been un
der way for several weeks are now
nearly completed and the shop is In
deed a beauty. The room has been
enlarged to twice its original size and
mirrors extend entirely around it, the
reflections giving the impression of
almost unlimited distance, lne mir
rors are set in frames of the mission
style and the same style prevails in
the cases, leather upholstered settees
and Cher furniture. The 'walls and
ceiling have been beautifully papered
and a complete se-t of new fixtures of
the latest pattern have been installed.
A most attractive feature is the light
ing scheme, the numerous incandes
cents, reflected in nhe mirrors making
a, most brilliant appearance.
The shop now contains four chairs
and one more is 10 be Installed. The
bath room Is also being completely
overhauled. There Is probably no finer
barber shop in the southwest than the
Rock Island.

C. H.S. STILL HOLDS
THE CHAMPIONSHIP
The fact that the Chit-kasha High
school cancelled a game with the Y.
M. C. A. team at Wichita Falls, Texas,
in nwde the occasion for a sweeping
claim by the latter to non-collegiate
football championship of Texas and
Oklahoma.
When Andy Hamilton, manager of
the locttl team, fwas interviewed in re
gard to the matter he said:
"We were perfectly willing to play
them but our faculty objected to our
palying.them since they are not a High
school team. We told them, however,

bold yeggmen early today walked
into the bank at Martinsburg, a
small town 12 miles east of this
city, and blew open the safe, es-

TWO ALLEGED
SWINDLERS
ARE CAUGHT
Enid, OkVa., Dec. (i. With the ar
rest of Mrs. W. M. Black in San An
tonio, a soldier who was with her,
and information which will probably
result in the arrest of G. W. Wilker
son, a former vattl- buyer of Fair
view, the Oklahoma Bankers' associa
tion has been successful in, a general
search for Wilkerson for the last three
weeks and has saved the Farmers. &
Merchants' bank of Fairview fttnn
paying a forged certificate of deposit
for $2,300.
Wilkerson, it Is saitf, forged the cer
tificate of deposit and obtained $200 in
cash from the Fairview bank. The
certificate of deposit was made payable
to Mrs. W. M. Black. Almost imme
diately it was learned that the certi
ficate was a forgery. The general of
fice of the Oklahoma State Bankers'
association, "which is located ia this
city, was notified. Every bank on this
side of the Ohio river was immediately
notified of the forgery, with instruc
tions to cause the arrest of the per
son presenting the check.
Tba;. was three weeks ago. Nothing
more was heard of the certificate un
til Secretary Harrison received a tele
gram that Mrs. W. H. Black had pre
served the certificate at the Lockridge
National bank of San Aretonio for pay
ment. The disputch, which came from
J. W. Hoopes, secretary of the Texas
association, stated that both Mrs.
Black and a soldier who identified her !
had been arrested. j
Secretary Harrison immediately '
f wired to hold !them until the arrival
of an officer who could1 complete iden
tification, and in th meantime to at
tempt to secure from Mrs. Black some
clue as to the whereabouts of Wilker
son. From her 1t was learned that he
Is either In Drester Mo., or in Galves
ton, Texas.
Sheriff Geo. A. McArthur of Waton
ga, the original offense having taken
place in Canton, Blaine county, left
yesterday for San Antonio, where he
will take custody of Mrs. Black. It i
believed that Wilkerson will be cap
tured within ifwenty-four hours.

The musical fantasy, "A Night hi

program of the Italian Boys, at the M.
E. church tomorrow evening, Dee. 7,
at, 8:30 o'clock. These young men are j
trained musicians and Mrs. Foland.jf f
their leader, is a reader of high rank;)
as well as a singer. This attraction !
is the best of the course and the Y. j
M. C. A. knows it will delight aU who!;
attend. Get. ticket at Dnnlap's or of j
calling it the Chickasha Y. M. C. A.
team, and play them but they refused
to agree. to this arrangement and
therefore we cancel'ed the game.
"The cancelling of the game does
not affect he standing of our team
at all. Wichita Falls has a Y. M. C. A.
team and they don't figure in the con
test for the High school championship
which Chickasha has won. Had we
played the game and lost It, our
standing would have been the same.
We would have been glad to meet
them as a Y. M. C. A. team and we
regret that they declined to play 11s
under that name."
BROKE OPEN STORE
NOTHING MISSING
What was apparently an attempt to
rob Calvert's hardware store Sunday
night is puzzling tba proprietors as
nothing has been -found missing. Much
trouble was taken to gain an entrance,
augur hnlpo having been bored around
a panel of the rear door, the panel
then being kicked in. The tthieves were
probably small boys, as the hole would
not. permit the entrance of a large
man, but a careful survey ot pocket
knives, revolvers and1 articles liable to
attract the attention of juvenile 'burg
lars showed nothing missing.

Both houses convened at 2 o'clock
this afternoon. The house has prac
tically nothing before Jt, except to
take up the amendments which the
senate may add to the capital bill.
The Durant bill came before the
senate tills afternoon for final pass
age, A loop-hole for Guthrie to contest
the legality of the capital bill in the
courts was opened yesterday afternoon
when the senate adopted an- amend
ment to the bill conferring exclusive
jurisdiction upon (the state supremn
court in capital matters. The. amend
ment' provides that any suit, for the
purpose of testing the validity of the
measure must be filed within it en days
after its passage.

sists of Senators Vaonipson, Kggorm'an,
Echols, Newell,5 Barefoot, Anderson,
Vandeventer. Landrurn, Stewart, Hen

said to favor an expenditure upon the
part of the state in- erecting a eapitol.
They have contended that, if the city

people will not complain against a mod
erate expenditure for building pur
poses. 1
