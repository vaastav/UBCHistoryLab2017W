FOLLOWING is the message of
President Wilson delivered at a
rT joint session of the senate and
Louse at the beginning of the
Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress Since 1
last hud the privilege of addressing
you oa the state of the Union the war
of nations on the other side of the sea,
which had then only begun to disclose
its portentous proportions, has extend
ed it.s threatening and sinister scop
until it lias swept within its flame
some portion of every quarter of the
globe, not excepting our own hemi
sphere, has altered the whole face of
international affairs, and now presents
a prospect of reorganization and re
construction such as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
We have stood apart, studiously neu
tral. It was our manifest duty to da
so. Not only did we have no part or
interest In the policies which seem to
have brought the conflict on; it was
necessary, if a universal catastrophe
was to be avoided, that a limit sin mid
be set to the sweep of destructive war
and that some part of the great fam
ily of nations should keep the proeess
i's of peace alive, If only to prevent
collective economic ruin and the break
down throughout the world of the in
dustries b' which its populations nro
fed ami sustained. It ts manifestly
the duty of the self governed nations
of this homl-.pher to redress, if possi
ble, the balance of economic loss and
confusion in the other, if they could
do nothing more. In the day of read
justment and recuperation we earnest
ly hop nnd believe thr.t they can bo
ff infinite service.
In this neutrality, to which they
were bidden not only by their sep
arate life and their habitual detach
ment from the iwliticc of Kurope, but
also by a clear p'TCcptlou of interna
tional duty, the states of America havo
become conscious of a ikw and moro
vital community of interest and moral
partnership In affairs, more clearly
conscious of the man common sympa
thies and Interests and duties which
bid them stand together.
There was a time in the early days
of our own great nation and of the re
publics fighting their way to independ
ence In Central and South America
when the government of the United
States looked upon itself ns in some
sort the guardian the republics to
the south of her as again:t any en-
n nhments or efforts at political con
trol from the other side of the water;
felt it its duty to play the part even
without invitation from them, and I
think that we ran claim that the task
was undertaken with a true and disin
t erected enthusiasm for the freedom
of the Americas and the unmolested
self government of her independent
peoples. Hut it was always ditlicult to
maintain such a role without offense
to the pride of the peoples whose free
dom of a tion we sought to protect
and without provoking serious mis
ton -options, of our motives, and every
thoughtful man of affairs must wel
come th altered cireum-t.tneos of the
r.cw day i 1 whose lilii we now stand,
v. hon th 're is no claim of guardian
ship or thought of w an's. but instead
a full anu honoral le association as of
partners between ourselves and our
neighbors in the interest of all Amer
ica, north and .onth. Our i on- ern for
the independence an I prosperity of the
states of Central and South Ameri.w
Is not altered. We retain unabated the
spir'.t that has inspired r.s throughout
tho u-'ki!.. life of our L'ov,rn::;ent and
vnKn was so frankly put into word a
by 1 resident Monroe. We still mean
always to make a common cause of
rational Independence and of politic al
liberty in America. Hut that purpose
is now better understood so far as it
concerns ourselves. It N known not ti
be a se!tih purpose It is known to
hive In it no thought of taking advan
tage of any government in this hemi
sphere or playii g Its political fortunes
for our own I nefit. All the govern
ments of America stand, so far as wo
uro concerned, upon a footing of genu
ine equality and utnp:etIoned Inde
pendence. We have been put to the tot in the
case of Mexico, and we have tood thy
test. Whether we have benefited Mex
ico by the course we have pursued re
mains to be seen. Her fortunes are la
her own h inds. But we have at least
proved th.it we will r.ot tnke advan
tage of her in her distress nr.d under
take to In: pose upon her an ordc- an I
government of our own choosing. Lib

men's choosing ought ever to be set.
livery American who has drunk at
the true fountains of principle and tra
dition must subscribe without reserva
tion to the high doctrine of the Vir
ginia bill of rights, which in the great
days in which our government was set
tip was everywhere among us accept
ed as the creed of free men. That doc
trine is, '"That government is or ought
to be instituted for the common bene
fit, protection and security of the peo
ple, nation or community;" that "of
all the various modes and forms of
government, that is the best which is
capable of producing the greatest de
gree of happiness and safety nnd is
most effectually secured against tho
danger of maladministration, and that
when any government shall be found
inadequate or contrary to these pur
poses a majority of the community
hath an indubitable, inalienable and
indefeasible right to reform, alter or
abolish it in such manner as shall bo
judged most conducive to the public
weal." We have unhesitatingly ap
plied that heroic principle to the case
of Mexico and now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic,
which had so much of which to purge
itself and so little sympathy from any
outside quarter In the radical but nec
essary process. Wo will aid and be
friend Mexico, but we will not coerce
her. and our course with regard to her
ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer
ica that we seek no political suzerainty
or selfish control.
PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
Economic Adjustments Inevitable With
in the Next Generation.
The mora! is that the states f Amer
ica are not hostile rival-;, but io-cp-erating
friends, and that their grow
ing sense f community of intcre-t,
aliUe in matters political and in mat
ters econoiiii-. is liL.'ly to give them a
Lew signi!i--;i ie e as factors in interna

in a very t p and true sense a unit
in world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing togeth-u- l e'ause thinking to

and comuio-i ideals. Separated, they
are snhjeet ! ail the m-ss currents of

Greatest Danger to Country

Borders.
of how necessary it is that we should
hasten their building.
There is, I venture to point out, an
especial significance just now attach
ing to this whole matter of drawing
the Americas together In bonds of hon
orable partnership and mutual advan
tage because of the economic readjust
ments which the world must inevitably
witness within the next generation,
when peace shall have at last resumed
its healthful tasks. In the perform
ance of these tasks I believe the Amer
icas to be destined to play their parts
together. I am interested to fix your
attention on this prospect now because
unless you take It within your view
and permit the full significance of it to
command your thought I cannot find
the right light in which to set forth
the particular matter that lies at the
very front of my whole thought as I
address you today. I mean national
defense.
No one who really comprehends tho
spirit of the great people for whom we
are appointed to speak can fail to per
ceive that their passion is for peace,
their genius best displayed In the prac
tice of the arts of peace. Great democ
racies are not belligerent. They do not
seek or desire war. Their thought is
of Individual liberty and of the free
labor that supports life and the un
censored thought that quickens it.
Conquest and dominion are not in our
reckoning or npreoable to our princi
ples. Hut just because we demand un
molested development and the undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter it may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We Insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development.
We do more than that. We demand it
also for others. We do not confine cur
enthusiasm for Individual liberty nnd
free national development to the Inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wher
ever there is a people that tries to walk
in these difficult paths of Independence
and right. From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and havo
deemed it as important that our neigh
lors should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
be; Lave set America aside as a whole
for the uses of independent nations and
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple against aggression. And we are
as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within our own nation
as of aggression from withou'.. We
will not maintain n standing r'iny ex
cept for uses whi.'h are as cessary
iu times of peace as in tirr of war.
and we shall always e that our
military peace estabn -V Is no
larger than is actually i itlnuous
ly needed for the uses ol .n which
no enemies move again Hut wo
do believe in a body o e citizens
ready and sufficient to e care of
themselves and of the vfnments
which they have set up to serve them.
In our constitutions themselves we
have commanded that "the right of
the people to keep nnd bear arms shall
riot be infringed," and our confidence
has been that our safety in times of
danger would lie in the rising of the
nation to take care of itself, as tho
farmers rose at Lexington.
SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Increase Standing Regular Force Four
- Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers.
IUit war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It is a thing
of disciplined might If our citizens
are ever to fight effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves immediately avail
able and immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant
in this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves nnd of it The military
arm of their government which they
will not allow to direct them, they may
prorerly use to serve them and make
their independence secure, nnd not
their own independence merely, tut
the rights also of those with whom
they have made common cause, should
they alo be put In Jeopardy. They
must bo fitted to play the great role
!n the world, nnd particularly in this
hemisphere, for which they nre quali
fied by principle nnd by chn"tened nni
tltlon to play.
It Is with these Uenls in mind tLat
the plans of tlie department rf war for
more adequate :.:iti:ial delense were
conceived whl ii will be laid befcre
you. and whi h I uige you to sanction
and put into effect as soon as they can
be properly scrutinized and discussed.
They seem to me the essential first
steps, and 'hey seem to me for the
present sufiicieat
They contemplate an increase of the
standing foree of the regular army
from its present strength of .",023 offi
cers and lO-.OSr enlisted men of all
services to a strength of 7,1G officers
and 131,707 enlisted men. or 141.S43
all told, all services, rank and file, by
the addition of fifty-two companies of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four
regiments of field artillery and four
nero squadrons, besides 750 officers re
quired for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all important
duty of training the citizen force of
which I shall presently speak, 702 non
commissioned ofiicers for service in
drill, recruiting and the like and tho
necessary quota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps, the hospital
corps, the ordnance department and
other similar auxiliary services. These
are the additions necessary to render
the army adequate for its present du
ties, duties which it has to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our Interior
army posts, but also in the Philippines,
in the Hawaiian Islands, at the isth
mus and in Porto Rico.
Ily way of making the country ready
to assert some part of its real power
promptly and upon a larger scalo
should occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of 400.000 disciplined citi
zens, raised in increments of 133.000 a
year throughout a period of three
years. This it is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable men of the country would
be asked to bind themselves to servo
with the colors for purposes of train
ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to the colors at call
at any time throughout -n additional
'furlough" period of three years. This
force of 400.000 men would be pro
vided with personal accoutennents as
fast as enlisted nnd their equipment
for the field made ready to be supplied
at any time. They would be assem
bled for training at stated intervals at
convenient places in association with
suitable units of the regular army.
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months in
the year.
It would depend upon the patriotic
feeling of the younger men of the
country whether they responded to
such a call to service or not It
would depend upon the patriotic spirit
of the employers of the country wheth
er they made It possible for the j-oung-er
men in their employ to respond un
der favorable conditions or not. I for
one do not doubt the patriotic devotion
either of our young men or of thoso
who give them employment those for
whose benefit and protection they
would in fact enlist I would look
forward to the success of such an ex
periment with entire confidence.
At least so much by way of prepara
tion for defense seems to me to be ab
solutely Imperative now. We cannot
do less.
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
FOR GTR EATER NAVY.
Always Looked to It as Our First and
Chief Line of Defense.
The program which will be laid be
fore you by the secretary of the navy
is similarly conceived. It involves only
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out, but it docs make definite and ex
plicit a program which has heretofore
been only implicit, held in the minds of
the committees on naval affairs and
disclosed in the debates of the two
houses, but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seems to me very
clear that it will be to the advantage
of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency and to press that p'.an
to completion within the next five
years. We have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and
chief lin of defense; we have always
veeu it to be ur manifest course of
prudence to K strong on the seas.
Year by year we have been creating a
navy which now ranks very high in
deed among the navies of the maritime
nations. We should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
e h.ave Ijegua and how soon.
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
five years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, tea scout cruisers, fifty de
stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It is proposed that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
twenty-five coast submarines, two gun
loats anil one hospital ship: the second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser,
ten destroyers, four Ceet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat
and one fuel oil ship; the third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
Fcout cru!crs. five destroyers, two fleet
submarines nnd fifteen coast pubma
rines: the fourth year two battleships,
two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two Ceet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni
tion hlp nnd one fuel oil ship, nnd
the fifth year tTo battleships, one bat
tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de
f trovers, two Ceet submarines, fifteen
cv.st submarine, one gunboat one am
munition ship and one repair shla.
The secretary of the navy Is asking
also for the immediate addition to fje
personnel of the navy of 7,iX sailors.
U.oOO apprentice seamen and l.r00 ma
rines. This increase would be suffi
cient to care for the ships which are
to be completed within the fiscal year
1017 and also for the number of men
which must be put in training to man
the ships which will be completed
early in 101S. It is also necessary that
the number of midshipmen at the Na
val academy at Annapolis should be
increased by at least 300 iu order that
the force of officers should be more
rapidly added to, and authority is ask
ed to appoint, for enqrineering duties
only, approved graduates of engineer
ing colleges, and for service in the avi
ation corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE
FINE MERCHANT MARINE.
United States Should De Its Own'Car
rier on the Seas.
If this full program should be carried
out we should have built or building in
1021, according to the estimates of sur
rival and standards of classification
followed by the general board of tho
department an effective navy consist
ing of 27 battleships of the first line. G
battle cruisers, 25 battleships of the
second line, 10 armored cruisers. 13
scout cruisers, 5 first class cruisers, 3
second class cruisers, 10 third class
cruisers, 10S destroyers, IS fleet sub
marines, 157 coast submarines, G mon
itors, 20 gunboats, 4 supply 6hlps, 15
fuel ships, 4 transports, 3 tenders to
torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special
types and two ammunition ships. This
would bo a navy fitted to our needs
and worthy of our traditions.
But armies and instruments of war
are only part of what has to be con
sidered if we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self sufficien
cy and security in all its aspects.
There are other great matters which
will be thrust upon our attention
whether we will or not There is, for
example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping involved in this
great problem of national adequacy.
It is necessary for many weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that we should have a great
merchant marine. The great merchant
fleet we once used to make us rich,
that great body of sturdy sailors who
used to carry our flag Into every sea,
and who were tho pride and often the
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven out of existence by inexcusable
neglect and indifference and by a hope
lessly blind and provincial polley of
so called economic protection. It is
high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our commercial independence;
on the seas.
For it is a question of Independence.
If other nations go to war or seek to
hamper each other's commerce our
merchants, It seems, are at their mer
cy to do with as they please. We must
use their 6hips and use them as they
determine. We have not ships enough
of our own. We cannot handle our
own commerce on the seas. Our inde
pendence la provincial, and is only on
land and within our own borders. We
are not likely to be permitted to use
even the ships of other nations in ri
valry of their own trade and are with
out means to extend our commerce
even where the doors are wide open
and our goods desired. Such a situa
tion is not to ha endured. It is of capi
tal importance not only that the Unit
ed States should be its own carrier on
the seas and enjoy the economic inde
pendence whih only an adequate
merchant marine would give it, but
also that the American hemisphere as
a whole should enjoy a like ind -pend-ence
and self suiliclency, if it i not
to be drawn into the tangle of Euro
pean affairs. Without such Independ
ence the whole question of our polit
ical unity and self determination is
very seriously clouded and complicated
indeed.
Moreover, we can develop no true or
effective American policy without ships
of our own not ships of war, but
ships of peace, carrying goods and car
rying much more; creating friendships
and rendering iadispensable services to
all interests on this side the water.
They must move constantly back and
forth between the Americas. They are
the only shuttles that can weave tho
delicate fabric of sympathy, compre
hension, confidence and mutual de
pendence in which we wish to clothe
our policy of America for Americans.
The task of Lulldlng up an adequate
merchant marine for America private
capital must ultimately undertake and
achieve, as it has undertaken and
achieved every other like task among
us In the past with admirable enter
prise, intelligence and vigor, and it
seems to me a manifest dictate of wis
dom that we should promptly remove
every legal obstacle that may stand in
the way of this much to be desired re
vival of our old Independence and
should facilitate in every possible way
the building, purchase and American
registration of ships. But capital can
not accomplish this great task of a
sudden- It must embark upon it by
degrees, as the opportunities of trade
develop. Something must be done at
once, done to open routes and develop
opportunities where they are as yet
undeveloped, dene to open the arteries
of trade where the currents have not
yet learned to run, especially between
the two American continents, where
they are. singularly enough, yet to be
created and quickened, and it is evi
dent that only the government can un
dertake each beginnings and assume
the initial financial risks. When the
risk has passed and private capital be
gins to find lta way In sufficient abun
dance Into these new channels the gov
ernment may withdraw. But it can
not omit to begin. It should take the
first irteps, and should take them at
once. Our goods must not lie piled up
at our ports and stored upon slle
tracks in freight cars which are dally
needed o the roads. mut not be left
without n.Vaus of transport to any for
eljm quarter. We must not await the
permission of foreign shipowners and
foreign governments to send them
where we will.
With a view to meeting thee press
ing necessities of our commerce and
availing ourselves at the eariiest possi
ble moment of th" present unparalleled
opportunity of linking the two Ameri
cas together in bonds of mutual inter
est and service, an opportunity which
may never return acain if we miss it
now, proposals will be made to the
present congress for the purchase or
construction of ships to be owned and
directed by the government similar to
those made to the last consxes. but
modified in some essential particulars.
I recommend these proposals to you
for jour prompt acceptance with the
more confidence because every month
that has elapsed since the former pro
posals were made has made the ne
cessity for such action more and more
manifestly imperative. That need was
then foreseen. It is new acutely felt
end everywhere realized by those for
whom trade is waiting, but who can
find no conveyance for their poods. I
am not so much Interested In the par
ticulars of the program as I am in
taking immediate advantage of the
great opportunity which awaits us if
we will but act in this emergency. In
this matter, as in all others, a spirit of
common counsel should prevail, and
out of it should come an early solu
tion of this pressing problem.
SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY
IN THE PHILIPPINES.
Recommends Early Adoption of Meas
ures Giving Them Fuller Justice.
There is another matter which seems
to me to be very intimately associated
with the question of national safety
and preparation for defense. That Is
our policy toward the Philippines and
the people of Porto Rico. Our treat
ment of them and their attitude to
ward us are manifestly of the first con
sequence in the development of our
duties in the world and in getting a
free hand to perform those duties. Wo
must bo free from every unnecessary
burden or embarrassment, and there
is no better way to be clear of em
barrassment than to fulfill our prom
ises and promote the interests f thoso
dependent on us to the utmost Dills
for the alteration and reform of tho
government of tha Philippines and for
rendering fuller political justice to tho
people of Porto Itico were submitted
to the Sixty-third congress. They will
bo submitted also to you. I need not
particularize their details. You are
most of you already familiar with
them. But I do recommend them to
your early adoption with the sincere
conviction that there are few measures
you could adopt which would more
Ferviceably clear the way for the great
policies by which we wish to make
good, now and always, our right to lead
in enterprises of peace and good will
and economic and political freedom.
The plans for the armed forces of
the nation which I have outlined and
for the general policy of adequate prep
aration for mobilization and defense
Involve, of course, very large addition
al expenditure? of money, expenditures
which will considerably exceed the es
timated revenues of the government
It is made my duty by law whenever
the estimates of expenditure exceed
the estimates of revenue to call the
attention of the congress to the fact
and suggest any means of meeting tho
deficiency that it may be wise or pos
sible for me to suggest. I am ready
to believe that it would be my duty to
do so In any case, and I feel particu
larly bound to speak of the matter
when It appears that the deficiency will
arise directly out of the adoption by
the congress of measures which I my
self urge it to adopt Allow me there
fore to speak briefly of the present
state of the treasury and of the fiscal
problems which the next year will
probably disclose.
On the 30th of June last there was
an available balance In the general
fund of the treasury of $104.170.105.78.
The total estimated receipts for the
year 191G, on the assumption that the
emergency revenue measure passed by
the last congress will not be extended
beyond Its present limit, the 31st of
December, 1915, and that the present
duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will
be discontinued after the 1st of May,
1916. will be $070.305.500.-' The balance
of June last and these estimated rev
enues come therefore to a grand total
of $774.535.005.78. The total estimated
disbursements for the present fiscal
year, including twenty-five millions for
the Panama canal, twelve rnl!liins for
probable deficiency appropriations and
$50.000 for miscellaneous debt redemp
tions, will be $753.S91.00, and the bal
ance In the general fund of the treas
ury will be reduced to $'JO.014.G05.7S.
The emergency revenue act if contin
ued beyond its present time limitation
would prduce during the half year
then remaining about forty-one mil
lions. The duty of 1 cent per pound
on sugsr If continued would produce
during the two months of the fiscal
year remaining after the in of May
about fifteen millions. Thee two sums,
amounting together to fifty-six mil
lions, if a died to the revenues of the
second half of the fiscal year would
yield the treasury at the end of the
year an available balance of $70.044,
C05.73. The additional revenues required to
carry out the program of military and
naval preparation of which f have
spoken would, as at present estimated,
te for the fiscal year 1917 $frt.5O0.00O.
Thoe figures, taken with the figures
foe ttt present fiscal jear which I
have already driven, disclose our finan
cial probleu f r th- year 1917. A
sun.in that the taxes imped by the
emergency revenue act and the, pres

however, there v...uld bo a balance In
the treasury of some S70.5OUJ J at

r. de!;, it nt the end of the next year of
only some $5(mk.n, or, reckoning in
,02. humi for deficiency appropria
tions and a safe treasury balance at
the end of the year, a total deficit of
some . 11 2. .). The obvious moml
of the figures Is that it is a plain coun
sel of prudence to continue nil of tho
preM'iit t.'ues or their equivalents and
exuiflne ourselves to the problem of
providing $irj.vuN) of new revenue
rather than $L,97.m).nO.
How fchall we obtain the new rev
enue? We are frequently reminded
that then are many millions of londs
which the treasury is authorized under
existing law to sell to reimburse tho
sum paid out of current revenues for
the construction of the Panama canal,
and it U true that bonds for tho
amount of N J'J.iolV ) are now avail
able for that purj ose. Prior to 1913
$13s,C.OuO of these tmds had ac
tually been sold to recoup the expendi
tures at the Isthmus, nnd now con
stitute a considerable item of the pub
lic debt. Uut I for one do not believe
that the people of this country' approve
of postponing the payment of their
bills. Itorrowing money Is shortMght-
ed nnane. It can Pe justineu only
when permanent things are to be ac
complished which many generations
will certainly Nnefit by nnd which it
teems hardly fair that n single genera
tion should pay for. The objects wo
are now proposing to spend money for
cannot be so classified, except In the
sense that everything wisely done may
be said to be done in the interest of
posterity as well as in our own. It
seeing to me a clear dictate "f pru
dent statesmanship and frank finance
that in what we are now, I hope, about
to undertake we should pay as we go.
The people of the country are entitled
to know Just what burdens of taxation
they are to carry and to know from tho
outset now. The new bills should be
paid by internal taxation.
To what sources, then, shall wo
turn? This is so peculiarly a question
which the gentlemen of the house of
representatives are expected under the
constitution to propose an answer to
that you will hardly expect me to do
more than discuss it in very general
terms. We should Ik? following an al
most universal example of modern
governments if we were to draw tho
greater part or even the whole of the
revenues we need from the lncomo
taxes. liy somewhat lowering the pres
ent limits ot exemption and the figure
at which the surtax shall begin to bo
Imposed and by increasing step by step
throughout the present graduation tho
eurtax itself, the Income taxes ns at
present apportioned would yield sums
sufficient to balance the books of the
treasury at the end of the fiscal year
1917 without anywhere making tho
burden unreasonably or oppressively
heavy. The precise reckonings an
fully and accurately set out In the re
port of the secretary of the treasury
which will be Immediately laid before
you.
And there are many additional
sources of revenue which can Jutly be
resorted to without hampering the In
dustries of tho country or putting any
too great charge upon individual ex-I-nditure.
A 1 per cent tax pr gallon
on gasoline and naphtha would yield,
Pt the present estimated production,
f 10.("j0.00O, a tax of 50 cents ir horse
power on automobiles and Internal ex
plosion engines $15.M.000, a stamp
tax on bank chK-ks probably flS.OOO
OuO a tax of 25 cents i-r ton on pig
Iron 51000,000, a tax of 50 rcr.li per
ton on fabricated Iron and steel proba
bly SKMMO.OOO. in a country of preit
indu.-trles like this It ought to !e easy
to dUtribut" the burdens of taxation
without wn :Ing them any when; bear
too heavily or too exclusively upon any
one set of persons or undertaking".
