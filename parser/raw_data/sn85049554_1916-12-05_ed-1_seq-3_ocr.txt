GRANO FINALE REVIEW
OF 23,000 SOLDIERS
Delayed Order Gives lows Troops Ad-
vantage—Maneuver Regarded as Cli
max to Five Months Training on
Border Duty—Troops Resting snd
Recuperating From Strenuous Work.
Brownsville, Tex., Dec. 5.—The trn
day war between the Brown and White
armies having been concluded, the
Iowa brigade, a unit in the tirst men
tioned force is resting and recuperat
ing from the strenuous ordeal. And
the guardsmen need a rest. March
ing, counter inarching, (rench digging,
plunging thru mesqulte jungles, irriga
tion ditches the lowans traveled 150
les during the maneuver period.
Their experiences have coincided re
markably with that of General Sher
man.
Olmito First Objective.
Moving out of Brownsville the
Browns, led by General H. A. Allen of
the Iowa brigade, left for Olmito, ten
miles north Nov. 1*6. The second day
bi'ought them in contact with General
Lewis' white army cavalry. Prom then
oi there was constant skirmishing as
the Whites, at first outnumbered made
an orderly retreat thru San Benito to
Harlingen. This first place was the
first north reached by the Browns.
Making a stand on the Colorado Ar
royo, a salt water inlet, from the gulf,
the two armies battled all day. Find
ing the Arroyo too formidable to force,
protected as it was with eleveii bat
teries of three inch guns and' a dozen
machine gun companies. General Allen
ordered a retreat.
Plans Go Wrong.
The iretreat and every move in the
big war game with a single exception
wiys planned in advance by General
Parker, chief of umpires and his stafT.
The exception was the engagement
near Olmito on the sixth day. Colonel
Bullard with 3,000 'Whites had been
ordered to move to the main body en
trenched' four miles east of Browns
ville. For some reason the order was
delayed in transmission and the move
ment was started several hours later
than intended. General Allen, in
formed by his scout% of the error in
sisted on being allowed tp take ad
vantage of it. He was given the
privilege by General Parker.'' Allen
moved his entire army out of game at
3 o'clock in^the morning, some units
paving an hour aj^lier. By a forced
march of eight miles the Browns.,were
placed so as to surround the 3,000
Whites who were wiped out. This
was tha umpire's version. The Whites
taken by surprise while' moving in
column formation, had no opportunity
to defend themselves against the sud1
don attack and were theoretically de
stroyed.
Wire Wilson Result.
Two more battles both apparent
victories for the Browns and the
maneuver'concliiiled. Therfinale'was a
mcjtster review tf'23 000 men, repre
senting' all branches' of the service.
It is stated by General Parker who is
nearing the end of a lengthy military
career to be the greatest review of
trained troops held since the union
veterans marched thru Washington at
the end of the civil war. A message
was sent, to president Wilson by the
commanding officer of the district,
stating that the .state troops' were
fully trained and entirely capable of
upholding the nation's honor when
ever necessary.
The maneuver is regarded as a
climax to- the five months' training of
the guardsmen by regular army offi­
Vtllisca Dec. 5/—The accompanying
picture' is of the house which on Sun
day, June 9, 1912, was the happy home
of Joe Moore, a prominent implement
dealer of this place. Here he lived with
his wife and four young children. The

Lena and Ina StiUinger, daughters of
Mr. and Mrs. Joe Stilllnger, friends of
the family who lived In the country.
On the following morning this house
revealed one' of the^moat atrocious
crimes ever committed In the state of
Iowa. Joe (Moore had always been
known to be prompt In getting down to
his place of business and on this Mon
day morning when he failed to ehow up
an investigation was made. Soon all
Villisca was aghast at /the rtews that
that wholfe 'Moore family and the two
little StilUnger girls, eight In all, had
been .brutally murdered In their beds
hy a flehd who used ah ax to crush out
the lives 'of his victims. This Ux, still
fresh with human blood, was found in
the bed room in which slept the little
StiUinger girls. Those who went, thru
the house Immediately after the die
covery of the crime, found what had
been on the evening before the peaceful
and contented home of Joe 'Moore—a

milItia are equal in everj( resptfet to

•i'i
house of carnage and murder.
The three bed rooms in which the
axman found his victims presented
ghastly acene3. The walls and floors
were spattered with blood.
After the excitement of the murder
had quieted down, the interior of the
house was entirely renovated: It was
newly decorated and all traces of the
blood stains removed. The external a]^,
pearance, however, of the house waj
never changed and it Is today as It was
then., But after the murder, no one
could be found who was willing to
brave the superstition which surround
ed the house and occupy it. For more
that a year the "murder house" stood
silent and vacant. Fabulous sums of
mbney could not tempt a tenant, was
the sentiment of the community. Final
ly the executors of the Joe Moore es
tate gave six months free rent to a
family .who dared to brave the uncan
nlneas of the place and once more the
house became a home. About two years
afterwards, the. place was sold to John
Oessaman who moved his family there
and Is now making It his home.
For months after the Moore tragedy,
the house was' the mecca of every
stranger who happened to flng himself
in Villisca. The Ueinousness of the
crime made It a subject of interest all
over the country. All travelers who
stopped In Villisca were curious'to see
the place where the famous axman
had increased the list of his victims
by eight in one night. Especially on
Sundays did the crowds swarm to the
"murder house." And ak a matter of

HOME ECONOMICS SENIORS AT
'V
AMES PAY LEtSS THAN 40
CENTS FOR MEALS.
SIMPLY APPLYING
ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES
Other Girl Students Liv« on Little Mire
Than 53 Cents a Day—This Amount
Covers Not Only.Coat of Food But
of Preparation and Serving, Fuel and
Salary of Stewardess.
Special to Tlhies-Republlean.
Ames, Dep. \1.—The glory of the Chi
cago diet squad, living on 40 cents of
food a day, fades into the common
place when it Is considered that Iowa
state college home economics seniors
are not only taught how to, but actual
ly do live on less than that amount
daily, as far as food is concerned.
In the new practice house just estab
lished at Ames by the home economics
department,
(under
the direction of
Miss Polly Wltwer, to give the home
economics women practical experience
in running a home, these students arc
living on just 3!).3 cefits a day for their
meals, an average of but 13.3 cents a
meal. And they're not try/n# to break
a record either, but are simply apply
ing home economics principles of buy
ing, marketing, cooking and household
management learned In their work at
Ames. Here's how they do it:
Ideals Normal and Nutritious.
The1 senior home economics women
are divided Into groups of seven. I£ach
party of seven lives at the house foi a
period of two weeks, taking entire
charge. Because the house is so far
from the campus, they take but morn
ing and evening meals there, except on
Saturday and Sunday. They thus eat
thirty-two meals at the house during
the two weeks. They pay J5.50 apiece
for expenses, which pays also for the
incidentals of light 'and gas which
amount to 16 a month, telephone $1 a
month, and janitor service *10 a
month. One girl, therefore, pays $1.2.14
for the incidentals for the two weeks
and $4,286 for her thirty-two meals, or
13.3 cents a meal, or 39.3 cents a day.
And the girls thrive, for each meal is
perfectly normal and nutritious. Yes
terday, for instance they had for break
fast, fruit, an uncooked cereal, muffins,
butter and chocolate or cocoa: for
evening dinner they had roast beef, es
calloped potatoes, a relish, bread and
butter, jam 'and ice cteam and cake.
Living' Expenses of Others.
The home economics girls are not the
only ones at Ames who lower the 40
cents a day mark for food expenses
Girls living in the college dormitories,
and there kre some 300 of them, pay
but $3,75 a, Week for their board or
53.4 cents'k day, or '17.8 cents a meal.
This amount not only pays for the
food, but for the labor of preparation
and serving,' the fuel used in cooking
tho food, the salary of the stewardess
and the depreciation of cooking equip
ment used. On the other hand, the 40
cents a day paid by the Chicago diet
aquad covers cost of food alone.

while on the face of the returns his
republican opponent, Peter Rix, was
elected by one vote, a recount will
show that the result was either an ac
tual tie or that he defeated Rix by one
vote. Hagen, who served on the elec

understanding between himself and the
other clerk of that precinct, either
one or two votes for himself were not

a.so making rapid strides After only
four years' existence its assets total

it is the second largest financial in
