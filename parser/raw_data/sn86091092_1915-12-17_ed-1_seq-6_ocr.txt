LIBEL SUITS IN RETROSPECT.
Libel suits are an unsatisfying fruit to cultivate. They
rarely bear as the plaintiff desires. Arrival at the intent
and purpose of an article, alleged to be libelous, unless
the libel is apparent on the surface, requires an inquiry
into contemporaneous, and oft times into extraneous,
matters. The law allows considerable latitude, and this
applies particularly where the action of public officials
are involved, in criticism. The courts have held that the
public welfare may warrant severe arraignment of thofe
persons charged with the performance of public duties,
when a question of delinquency arises. The truth of the
charge of delinquency immediately arises and this is fol
lowed by an inquiry into the intent o£ the author of the
allegel libel. It appears at once that a suit for libel can,
and usually does, cover territory not immediately involved.
A few years ago President Roosevelt thought that the
government of the United States had been libeled by
criticisms aimed at the methods by which he and his as
sociates in office had acquired the Panama Canal zone.
Suits for libel were instituted by the government against
the Indianapolis Star. The suits held fire for quite a while
and finally resulted in the defeat of the government.
A little while ago William Barnes of New York insti
tuted a libel suit against Co. Roosevelt because the Colonel
had stated that Mr. Barnes was a political boss and was
in cahoots with the leader of Tammany Hall. The suit is
still fresh in the public mind and reference to the disaster
to Barnes is unnecessary at this time. We would call at
tention however to the fact that Col. Roosevelt was al
lowed to wander all over New York in his successful
effort to prove his allegations.
However the right to criticize public officials was es
tablished in the eighteenth century. No government of
ficial was ever more successfully or more bitterly attacked
than was the British government from 1767 „to 1773. At
that time a notoriously corrupt and incompetent ministry
conducted the government. Junius and kindred writers
not only attacked the ministry but aimed their shafts at
the king himself. Libel suits were instituted with such
pitiful results that ever since a free and untrammeled
press has existed throughout the British empire. In this
country public men have always been deemed subject to
criticism and many times with little or no provocation
Today a threat of libel is looked upon with hearty con
tempt by every decent newspaper publisher.
The Tribune has stated that the anti-nepotism law of
Idaho has been violated in Canyon county. The law has
been violated. Nepotism in government was considered
so inimical to the public welfare that the state legislature
passed a law prohibiting it and providing heavy punish
ment for violations of the law. We can understand why
the public officials, and especially the prosecuting attor
ney, should consider the charge a most grave and serious
one. The charge is grave and serious and it is truthful
Instead of talking of bringing suit against The Tribune
for libel the attorney for the county should proceed against
his associate in office who is guilty of the charge.
An honest effort to enforce the anti-nepotism law will
butter more parsnips for the county attorney than an ef
fort to throttle criticism of public officials.
\
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT MOORE?
The county commissioners have authorized the pro
secuting attorney *to collect some thirty-nine hundred
dollars from G. H. Moore, ex-assessor and tax collector
of Canyon county. We understand that the attorney has
made formal demand for the money. Mr. Moore states
that he is not short $3900 or any other sum, and, presum
ably, refuses to pungle up. We suppose that the county
attorney will now make demand upon Mr. Moore's bonds
men for the sum in question. It is not likely that the
bondsmen will pay without suit. Is the county attorney
going to try to force collection?
The Tribune knows nothing about the intentions of the
county attorney. The Tribune is not a prophet. W^e are
some guesser however. We guess that no serious at
tempt will be made to collect $3900.00 or any other sum
of money from G. H. Moore or his bondsmen.
WAVES, BE STILL.
The statesmen of Europe do not take Henry Ford and
his peace expedition very seriously. For that matter
neither does any one else except the members of the
party. The opinion of the world at large is very well ex
pressed by Lord Rosebery, former prime minister of the
British empire. In an address delivered at Edinburgh
Saturday, Lord Rosebery said:
"In this month there is coming over a vessel fraught
with peace. It is propelled apparently by a gentleman
named Ford, who makes, I think, prcambulators. He is
coming over to pour oil on troubled waters at the in
spiration of a Dr. Akcd, of whom we knew something
here, and by voice more potent than that of any mortal
heard in this world, is going to call the soldiers from the
trenches and bid the waves be still.
'*Thc expedition will fail, but that the mighty passengers
receiving free passages may enjoy themselves and do no
mischief is our earnest solicitation."
THE POLITICIANS AND THE PRIMARY.
A little while ago the politicians of southeast Idaho
met at Pocatello. Later the politicians of north Idaho
met at Lewiston. The purpose of both meetings, disguise it
as you will, was to hit upon a plan for knocking the direct
primary into a state of "innocuous desuetude." Of course
the politicians claim that the purpose was holy and patrio
tic, to-wit: to discuss party affairs with a view of settling
differences, explaining past actions, and promoting harm
ony in the future, without regard to candidates for office.
No one is deceived by the asservations of the politicians.
When Brady and Borah, Hart and Burrill, Davis and
Height, get together, politics as applied, is the purpose.
They are all "practical men of high ideals." We arc not
quite so well acquainted with the north Idaho politicians
but we imagine that they are men of like purposes and
similar aspirations. They too want to put something
across in the way of a few state officers.
The Tribune has no objection to shelving the direct
primary law. We would prefer that it be repealed. A
straightforward repeal of the law is not the way in which
policians work. They prefer to do by strategy that which
ordinary men do openly and naturally. If the direct pri
mary system is to be abandoned by the "Republican party,
as is now promised, it will abandoned in broad day
light so far as The Tribune is concerned. We will not
pretend that the party is acting in accord with the spirit
of the law when we know very well that it is doing noth
ing of the kind.. We will not shout the virtues of the di
rect primary law while bending our efforts to see that
the purpose of the law is nullified. If a slate is to be made
up; well and good. All that we ask is that the rules be
published that all may know them. We are willing to
take our chances with the slate that is made. We will
support a ticket, made in any manner whatsoever, provided
everybody knows the rules and has an equal chance be
fore it js made up. We will not support a ticket agreed
upon at clandestine meetings of patriots who have an axe
to grind. If the Republican state central committee will
call a state convention for the purpose of reeommending
candidates to be finally selected at the primary election,
and provide, under proper safeguards, for the election of
delegates to that convention, The Tribune will supp'ort
the tickct recommended. It will not support any ticket
made up in any other manner, and it will look with sus
picion upon any candidate for the Republican nomination
who is the beneficiary of any action taken by a clique of
the party in secret caucus.
A FEW FACTS AND FIGURES.
The Tribune time anij again has asked its readers to give
little attention to the forestry bureau of the government.
The timber on national forest reserves is conservatively
valued at from one to five billion dollars. This property
produces a revenue all told of $2,481,469.35—the figures
are for the year 1914. Of this sum $850,000 is divided
among the states which have forest reserves in propor
tion to the revenue produced by each state. The balance,
$1,631,469.35, goes for administration. There were
employed on July 1, 1915, 3,875 persons in the forestry
bureau. Of these, 3,275 were employed upon the national
forests as supervisors, deputy supervisors, rangers and
guards; and 600 were employed in administrative, scien
tific and clerical work at Washington and other points.
The forests certainly are not administered in a manner
that would meet with the approval of any business man.
An investment of three or four billion dollars should pro
duce a greater gross revenue than $2,481,469.35 per year.
The cost of administration should not be over 65 per cent
of the gross revenue. There is something radically wrong
with the United States Bureau of Forestry.
When Gifford Pinchot was chief forester he estimated
that the annual loss from fire in the forests of the United
States exceeded $50,000,000. In other words the annual
fire loss is twenty times the gross returns which would
again indicate that something is amiss. The government
engaged in conservation, like the government engaged in
business, leaves a great deal to be desired.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Wilson's message dealt mostly with military
preparation. It does not strike a responsive chord as such
a' message on such a si^>ject should have struck. Col.
Roosevelt pronounces several of the flighty passages ab
surd. The Democratic members of Congress who were
not in sympathy with the military program the admin
istration are still unconvinced. The Republicans of the
country are not enthusiastic because the president is too
indefinite and hazy in his recommendations. Mr. Wilson
evidently does not knöw what he is driving at nor the
road thither. We fear that President Wilson is still a
weak sister. The President is evidently groping in the
dark, as he in fact, admits.
At the outset of his message the President took up pan
Americanism. He has substituted pan-Americanism for
the Monroe doctrine which in the light of the results of
the A. B. C. conference will not set well with the Ameri
can people as a whole. Pan-Americanism means that
the republics T>f the western hemisphere will act in unity
in the preservation of their peace and prosperity.- This
goes double with Mexico and we have a splendid illus
tration of pan-Americanism in that benighted, forsaken
and war-ridden country.
The President again makes this country the champion of
the neutral countries of the world. He says:
"But just because we demand unmolested development
and the undisturbed government of our own lives, upon
our own principles of right and liberty, we
resent from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression
we ourselves will not practice. We insist upon security
in prosecuting our self-chosen lines of national develop
ment. We do more than that. We demand it also for
others. From the first we have made common cause with
partisans of liberty on this side of the sea and have deem
ed it as important that our neighbors should be free from
outside domination as that we ourselves should be; have
set America aside as a whole for the uses of independent
nations and political freedom."
The paragraph quoted above would meet with most
general and emphatic approval if it had not been observed
and generally admitted that David did not slay Goliah
with a word.
The points touched upon in President Wilson's mes
sage may be summarized:
Sounds guarded warning that United States may be,
called upon to fight some European nation at end of the
present war.
Emphasizes unity of governments of the Americans to
preserve their independence and prosperity.
Recommends immediate preparation for defense.
Proposes to raise money for defense by retention of
duty on sugar and emergency war tax, incrcased^ïncome
taxes and new taxes on gasoline, automobile engines,
checks and other articles.
Recommends legislation to stamp out enemies of this
government within its borders, including those who con
spire against its neutrality and preach and practice dis
loyalty.
Urges creation of administrative machinery to mobilize
transportation facilities and obtain co-operation of manu
facturers and technical experts in time of national
necessity.
Asks for commission of inqury to deal with question of
greater efficiency of railroads.
Recommend government purchase of merchant marine.
Recommends prompt passage of rural credits legislation.
Urges federal aid and stimulation to industrial and voca
tional education.
Calls on congress to fulfill this government's promise to
the Philippines.
THE FAVORITE SON IN POLITICS.
Descartes observed that "good sense is, of all things
among men, the most equally distributed; for every one
thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those
'even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything
else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality
than they already possess."
We often wonder why every one having good sense in
sufficient measure should not use a little of it in politics.
Men of the best judgment go daft when it comes to
questions of politics and especially politicians. The ups
and downs of any politician, be he ever so great,
is a matter of the utmost indifference to the world. The
rise or fall of the greatest politician in the country does
not matter a red herring's worth to the average man.
At the present time some seven or eight states in the
Union have favorite sons for the Republican nomination
for president. To this The Tribune has no objection.
Every state could have a favorite son without causing us
any great uneasiness. What we object to is that
many people in each state insist as a matter of state pride
that all the citizens of that state support the favorite son,
be he competent or incompetent, be he available or un
available, be he willing or unwilling. These people take it
as a personal affront if any one refuses to go hog wild
over the favorite.
Of all nonsense the favorite son nonsense has the least
justification. It is founded upon nothing more substan
tial, in any case, than a conviction upon the part of the
personal friends of some one that he would make a good
candidate. Too often favorite son candidacies are the
result of an itch for office on the part of a few politicians,
and, quite often, the favorite son is not the favorite candi
date even of those politicians, except for temporary pur
poses.
PITILESS PUBLICITY.
No one would accuse the Scientific American of partisan
ship. It is a journal devoted to the arts and sciences.
NOTHING OV CONSEQUENCE*,
JUST A LOVE JFEAST
(Grangeville Free Press, Democratic)
It is indeed difficult to determine
whether that "Get-together meeting"
of north Idaho Republicans at Lewis
ton last Friday was a get together
meeting, or a post-mortem gathering
of North Idaho Republicans mutually
extending condolence to one another
and conferring on the relative sen
sibleness of sticking to the southern
choice recently made in Pocatello. In
other words if it is impossible to ride
on the elephant or walk ahead, be
satisfied to bring up the rear with a
grip on the tail of the beast.
In forcasting the announced gath
ering, the Tribune correspondent was
very undecided in his expressions as
to the purposes and plans, the pur
pose being expressed as "generally
understood to be the formation of a
plan looking to the unification of de
mands from northern Idaho so that
northern counties shall not have a
dozen candidates for one position,
and thus practically compel^ the de
feat of the present understood dispo
sition of many in the southern Idaho
section to concede the governorship
to the North." And the accounts of
the meeting after it was held were no
more certain.
George E. Crum, Lewiston, Defen
bach, et al, are undecided as_ yet
whether they want to be primary
nominees. "There is a natural curios
ity as who is who in this little mat
ter," states the Tribune reporter, and
further that, "C. A. Branscombe, of
Grangeville, who is a member of the
state central committee, is to attend
the conference. But will "Bill" Lee
of Moscow, also a member of the
committee, come, or will the presence
of F. C. McGowan, not of the same
political faction, be regarded as suf
ficient political representation from
the strongly Republican county of
Latah—be regarded as binding the
county to any unity plans that may
be agreed on?" The question was
also asked as to probable assent or
dissent of Pete Orcutt of Clearwater
county. It seems all to be one un
answerable question.
It was really hard to determine
whether the above named, came as
conferers and counselors, or have as
piration to the gubernatorial nomina
tion, or other offices, or whether they
would come to promote the interests
of a friend. The whole account of
the conference was very enigmatic,
both as to the announcement and the
later account. It steered clear from
the danger of an assertion that any
of those present were there to defeat
the purposes of the primary law and
grab off a nomination for themselves
or thrust is upon some willing sup
plicant for favor.
Some North Idaho leaders of ac
knowledged importance and prestige
were to be present as found in the
announcement. These were Lieuten
ant Governor Taylor and Hon. A. H.
Connor, both of Sandpoint, and both
of whom have been mentioned for
high places on the ticket. Mr. Taylor
was first mentioned for the gover
norship and immediately after the ad
journment of the legislature it was
given out with some show of at least
quasi authority, that the "big four,"*
the Oregon Short Line. Mormon
church. Coeur d'Alene mining and
north Idaho timber interests, had cen
tered on him as the proper opponent
of Alexander in 1916.
In the list of those present at the
love feast some of these more import
ant names were missing contrary to
expectations. As no considerable re
presentation of Southern Idaho Re
publicans of note or importance were
present at the meeting, nor reprc
sentatives of Hart. Brady, Borah or
the real molders of Republican poli
cies in the state, it is to be considered
that the meeting was in complete
harmony with the recent Pocatello
conference, and a peaceful and meek
means of requesting a humble posi
tion and place to grasp the tail of the
G. O. P. elephant, and to swallow anv
dose prepared by the real leaders of
the partv in the state. As the Poca
tello Tribune remarks stop that talk
of the north getting together.
FORD'S TOYRIDE.
(Cambridge News.)
It looks now like the persons who
are going on that jitnev expedition
with Henry Ford are looking forward
to one great joyridc at the expense of
the philanthropist. Few persons of
reputation or influence have accepted
the invitation. Still, we must except
our own P. Monroe Smock, who, we
understand, is now on the wav. Anv
multi-miilionaire who would offer to
pay the expense of a trip to Europe
would not lack for guests, no matter
what the ostensible object in view
might be.
So far as now appears the greater
numbef ? f ,hc P ar, V wi " be composed
of individuals who are intent upon
getting a free trip across the ocean.
Just what the man really thinks lie

can accomplish is not clear to the
average thinking man. It requires
more than a little bit of enthusiasm
to stop a war of such gigantie pro
portions as this one. The following
quotation from Ford shows that he
hasn't the fainest conception of the
great question he is trying to solve:
"I hope the United States will be
the first one to disarm, to throw all
the guns into the creek and haul the
battleships up on land. The only wav
to prevent war is by diarmament. If
we can only once stop the war it will
never be started again."
There are those who sav that Ford
is animated not by the expectation of
accomplishing any substantial re
sults, but of advertising himself in
Europe in a way that will make An
drew Carnegie turn green with envy.
Foolishness or Advertising.
(Priest River Times.)
Hon. Henry Ford, having sold more
motor cars than anyone else, can
easily afford the little peace junket to
Europe, accompanied by governors,
silver-tongued orators, sob sisters
aiyi other fine old women who are
anxious to avail themselves of fret
transportation and a chance to plead
for peace.
The President is right in refusing
official sanction to the expedition. It
isn't the province of this government
to advertise motor cars, or need it
make an ass of itself to please the
busy bodies whose business is wav
ing the well-known olive branch, The
President knows, as any reasonable
person should, that no delegation
from this country is going to make
the_ British lion lie down in peace
beside the Prussian eagle, or tame the
Russian bear or otherwise influence
the wild menagerie of Europe.
This Ford expedition is certainly
foolishness or advertising, and pos
sibly a little of both. Jane Addams,
earlier in the war, tried the same plan
on a smaller scale, as her means are
less ample, and as was to be expect
ed, she made a joke of herself and
the cause she represented. Ford will
be a bigger joke and that is all. Un
less, perhaps, it would increase the
sales of his fastest growing industry.
So far as ending ihe war is con
cerned, that will happen only with
the defeat of one side or the other,
or when both become so exhausted
that they will be willing to call if a
draw, and neither contingency is an
immediate prospect.
Travel is a great educa.or and all
that, and one can't blame those who
take a tour to Europe at the expense
of the motor magnate, but they should
not expect sane people, informed of
events in Europe to a reasonable de
gree, to take their efforts seriously,
for there is such a thing as expecting
too much.
Colonel's Bitter Disappointment.
Butte Miner: At last the secret ot
Colonel Roosevelt's harsh criticism
of the administration's foreign policy
is out, for a few days ago he submit
ted to an interview with Mr. Sidney
Brooks, one of the best known for
eign newkspaper men in the United
States, and at present correspondent
for the London Daily Mail, in ti.e
course of which the former president
admitted that when the Lusitania was
sunk he considered American inter
vention in the war inevitable.
So sure was the colonel of this
that he made instant preparations for
raising a force of 12,000 men, to be
organized along rough rider lines,
and he even had gone so far as to
pick out the generals, colonels, ma
'«f s ,. an d some of the captains for
this little army.
Ihe colonel told Mr. Brooks that
he had figured upon being in Fland
ers within 90 days of the declaration
of war and the fact that through
1 resident Wilson's diplomacy this
terrible calamity has been averted
was "one of the bitterest disappoint
ments ' of his life,
This interview explains a whole lot
and» incidentally makes it apparent
w a ' ., c c °l9 nc ' never will forgive
President Wilson for blocking his
came of going to the front and dis
tinguishing himself upon the battle
fields of Europe.
David S. Barry writes thus to the
Providence "Journal." "Nohodv
knows better than the secretary of the
treasury how depleted the daily bul
ance fund is becoming; even the new
method of treasury bookkeeping, de
signed to lure the public into a false
sense of security until the danger
point shall have been passed, does
not fool him." And Mr. Barry might
have added truthfully that it doesn'i
tool many other people any more.
This journal complains in a recent editorial that th
t ional administration is suppressing the facts in re r / 3 '
the military èstablishments of the country. i t !°
effect that there is much information in the bureau"
departments at Washington which the people \\ oui d
to know, and which by the greatest stretch of the ' '•
ation could do no harm if they did know, it
the administration to give the public such
is consistent with its welfare.
"nagin
appeals to
intorraation a s
Newspapers generally have called to public attent'
the fact that the present administration is the " '° n
sectetiye in the history of the country. Uefore his 1 " 8 '
auguration President-elect Wilson stated that durin^ h"
administration public business would be conducted '*
public. Pitiless publicity were the watchword. Hard!"
had the President entered the White "Rouse than thev \
was drawn. It has never been drawn back. Matters
the gravest importance have been undertaken with 'th'
secrecy that is supposed to distinguish the chancelier" '
of Europe. The internal and foreign affairs of the
tion have been conducted in secret. Laws have been
pealed without apparent reason. Mexican affairs are
gulfed in Styxian darkness. Public business of all k'T
and all governmental affairs are handled behind closed
doors.
There is, undoubtedly, much to be ashamed of but
scant justice to the American people demands that' th
know the state of their affairs, and especially wher e h
concerns their peace and safety.
OBSERVATORY
The following from a recent num
ber of the Springfield (Mass.) Re
publican is very interesting and puts
the matter just right:
GERMANIZING AMERICA.—
Fran cis Lieber came to the United
States from Germany about 1827 a
political refugee.» His later fame as a
publicist, teacher of political science
and the writer of the "instructions"
for the United States armies in the
field during the civil war has been
equaled by the fame of no othei
American of German origin except
Carl Schurz. The collection of Lie
ber, letters in the library of Congress
reveals the fact that, as earlv as the
fourth and fifth decades of the 19th
ccntury, the idea of Germanizing
America was entertained in certain
Teutonic circles abroad. How Francis
Lieber viewed such projects appears
in a letter written by him in 1847:
"When they talk of Germanizing
America I spurn the idea. The Ger
man character furnishes stuff to make
a nation of that might be good enough
for the Lord's grenadiers: but what is
it? Germany has no institutions, has
no popular common law, no traditions
of liberty. What, Germanize America
and draw out of our country the An
glican institutions as the bones of a
turkey, and leave a lump, fit only to
be dispatched? No, no; modern
liberty— people may say what thev
like—is, after all, especially Anglican
liberty. Develop, modify, chance,
trim, improve, but keep to the back
bone. I wish I could send you the
translation of a letter, somewhat like
an essay, which 1 sent lately to a
German society, who called upon me
to aid in keeping up German nation
ality here. A nationality in a nation
ality, like a minnow in a pike! and
what nationality? Transplanted na
tionality can consist in institutions
only, and where are the German in
stitutions? The princes have knocked
every one on the head. Indeed. I
would like to found an Anglico-Ger
man college, but that would be onlv
for the twofold object of promoting
assimilation and helping bring over
German knowledge and education."
Lieber valued liberty, as he found
it in America. Modern Germans
would call him old fashioned, an ex
tinct specimen of the German liberal
ism which went for naught when Bis
marck founded the empire, dut he
had a true vision of a Germanized
America—if it were a possibility—as
being a mere lump, such as a turkev
makes when it loses its bones.

Briefly Put.
An English professor, traveling

expressions. For instance, after ai long
ride the professor sought provisions
at a mountain hut.
"What'd yo-all want?" called out a

"Madam," said the professor, "can
we get corn bread here? We'd like
to buy some of you." ,
"Corn bread? Corn bread, did yo
