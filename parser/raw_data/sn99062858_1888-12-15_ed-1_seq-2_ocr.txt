A "OENEBAL feeling" has been discover
ed by the Chicago Tribune that '*it is un
becoming, improper even, for one who
has swayed the destinies of the great re
publio" to afterward enter into business
competition with his fellow-citizens and
so that newspaper advices President
Cleveland to go upoa a farm when he
lays aside the robes
of office. Thus "Oin-
cinnatus went back to the plow, Washing
ton, Jefferson, Madison aDd Monroe re
tired to their Virginia plantations. Jack
son sought the peaceful shades of his
Heimitage farm. Van Bnreo withdrew
to the seolusion of Kinderhook, Buohanan
buried himself at Wheatland, liases is
breeding poultry on a farm. It would
have been far better for Grant had he,
instead of ploughing into the turbid water
of Wall street, gon* to his St. Louis
farm." There is nothing unbecoming
abont an ex-president's return to old
pnrsnits on the contrary, it is highly be
coming under democratic institutions
that he should do so. But the Tribune's
advice is cot very bad. The farm will do
for ex-presidents if they have money en
ough to buy one, and can extract com
fort therefrom. There is that in it, too,
that smacks of the homely and rugged
simplicity of earlier days that made the
republic possible. Besides, what might
not bo the influence so exerted to oheck
the exodus from the soil that hss become

congress
of the republicans and patient resigna
tion on the part of the democrats being
everywhere evident. The republican
members who are prominently mentioned
in connection with the speakership of
the 51«f. congress, came in for an extra
share of felicitations, it being generally
conceded ou the floor that the next house
will be republican with from to 7 ma
jority. At precisely 12 o'clock the fall of
.he gavel settled the tumult whioh ex
isted in the hall, and silence reigned,
while Dr. Milburti, the chaplaii, offered
prajer. The rcll of members was then
called, and the hum of conversation broke
out afresh. Daring the progress of the
call Mr. Cleveland entered the executive
gallery and became an attractive specta
tor. Th* call developed th« presence of
.'136 member*, there being 88 absentees.
Oa motion of Air. .Mills (Texas,) a reso
lution was adopted directing the clerk
to inform the senate tha a quorum of
the house had nppeared, and that th»
house wa-t ready to prcoeed to bn-iiness.
In accordance with the resolnli«'n the
speaker appointed Messrs. Holman (Ind.),
Turner (G.*.), and O'Neill (Pn.) as a com
mittee to join a similar committee to
wait upon the president and inform him
that congress was ready to receive any
communication that ho might desire to
transmit. The house then, at 12::H, took
a reoess for an hour. After tne recess
Mr. Holman announced that the com
mittee appointed to wait upon the presi
dent had performed its duty, aud that the
president would commuuioate with con
gress forthwith. The president's anuusl
message was then read by the clerk. The
portion of th» message in which the
president treats of the tariff question was
listened to attentively by the members
oa both sidea of the house. Now ao.d
e n a s i e o e o i u a n o
derision would appear on the face of an
enthusiastic republican, tut thw sileuce
was not broken until the olerk rend, "the
cause for whioh the battle is waged is
comprised within lines clearly and dis
tinctly defined. It should never be
compromised. It is the people's cause.''
Then the democrats could no longer re
tain their feelings and broke into around
of applause, which was answered by tho
republicans with derisive laughter. The
president's reference to the Saokville
West incident provoked laughter from
the republican side of the bouse, but no
demonstration was made by the demo
crats. From this point interest in the
message slackened. Mr. Mills was the
only member who paid the slightest a',
tention to its further reading, and the
noise of conversation was so ent that
this was no easy tank. When, at .1:15 p.
m., the reading was completed, Mr. Mills
offered a resolution, whioh was agreed to,
referring the message to the committee
of the whole nud providing for its print
ing. Adjourned.

CONGRESSIONAL-
MONDAY, Deo. ".
House.—Long before the hoar for the
meeting of the seoond session of the 50th
congress the g-illeries of the house were
fillec with spectators, and the bright dress
es of the ladies formed a brilliant frame
lo the picture presented on the floor below.
There hand shaking was indulged in and
congratulations on re-election or condol
ences in defeat were exchanged among
the members, jocose raillery on the part
Stone
the sei ate to order, and
Chaplain Butler opened the proceed
ings with prayer. He returned
hanks for the bountiful blessings
tonohsaved the land in its uaterial
interest#, and remembered Presi
dent-elect Harrison in his petition.
A few minntes were spent in greeting
senators, and then Senator Sherman of
fered the usual resolutions, that the seo
retary notify the house that the senate is
ready to proceed to business. A reoolu
tion was offered by Sen. Morrill for the
nppointment of a committee to notify the
president tha' the secate is roady to re
ceive any communication he may have to
ike. Sena'ors Morrill and Salisbury
composed this committee. Sen. Cameron
offered a resolution that the senate meet
each day until further ordered at 12
o'clock, which resolution was adopted.
At 12:47 on motion of Mr. Sherman,
the senate took a leoess for half an hour.
At the conclusion of the reoess, whioh
had been exunded to 1:30, the u*ual
message from the house, announcing the
facts uf it* bting in session and of its
aaving appointed a committee to wait up
on th* president was delivered. That was
followed by a report from the committee
to wait on the president to ths effect that
it had performed iha duty and that the
president would communicate in writing
immediately. The president's message
was then delivered, and Mr. McCook, s*o
retary of the senate, proceeded to read
it. The reading of the message ocoapied
an hour and twenty minutes. The por
tions of it which discussed the question
of tariff revision, treasury surplss, fishery
troubles and the West incideut were
listened to with very olose attention by
the fourteen republican senators and
abont an equal number of democrats.
Tte other portions of the message seemed
to have but- few, if any listeners, and
thu reading had the effect of gradually
clearings the gslleries of the nomuroni
spectators. When the reading was finish
ed, the message was laid on the ta-le and
ordered to bo printed. The presiding
oftioer announced that the unfinished
business for tomorrow was the bill to re
duce taxation (the tariff bill.) Hen. Frye
gave notice that he would call up for con
nidtration to morrow morning, tho bill
for settlements with the Union Pacific
railroad company, nnd the bill was made

Something- About the Helpmaeta ol
Literary Men.
l-'iigeiie L. Dlldier.
Balzac says that a great man should have
neither wife nor children that he belongs
to the wond, to all, not wife and family,
aud should tread alone the path of glory,
or of .sacrifice, as ihe case may be. From
this opinion of the gveat est French novel
ists I bvg leave to dissent, so far as auth
ors ore concerned, great or small. If
there is a ir.au iu the world who needs
tho love and sympathy of n wife it is the
author. Yet the annals of literature fur
nish the melancholy faot that, of all men
author* have been the least happy in
their domestic lives, and, if the truth
must be told, the wives have generally
ln-en the cause of this state of iiff iirs.
The story of Socrates' domestio diflicnlt
its is too familiar to be repeated here.
We all know that it required much phil
osophic patience to keep the family of
which Xan'ippo was the mistress. We
know that Cupar's wife was not "above hus
pioiori." and Ctct ro's home wife was not
the happiest. Milton sang of "Paradise
Lost," hut did not find paradise in his
own family, although he tried persistent
iy with three successive lives. Shako
soeare, from his own bitter experience,
amiounoed as a fsct for all time that "a
young man married is a nun that's mar
ried." Addison made a splendid match
with the dowager Countess of Warwick,
and was obliged to escape to Will'u oof
fee house from
#he
gilded misery of Hol­
land House, where my lady countess pre
sided in awful state, and ltctured her
gentle husbaud for associating with suoh
low fellows as Pope, S#ift, Steele, and
other wits of the golden age of Queen
Anne.
De Qnincey writing of the wives and
ohildren of literary men, says they it is
that, being man's chief blessings, create
also for him the deadliest of his anxieties
that stuff his pillow with thorns, and sur
rouud his daily life with snares and, he
adds, suppose the oas« of# man who has
helpless dependents of this class upon
himself, summoned to fao* some sudden
failure of his resources that he should
lose the power of of exertiug so delicate
HD organ as the creative intellect, when
dealing with subjecsso ooy as those of
the imagination- what a maddening
thought is this to a man of family who
has absolatly no^esouroes except what h»s
pen yield. De Quincey himself suffered
this terrible anxiety so did Burns, upon
whout moon^a' «1| the children of gtuius
ahe primeval curso had fallen heaviest
tnd sunk most deeply.
The wife of a literary man should be
either a plain-minded woman who should
oecupy herself exclusively with house
hold matters aud shield her husband's
peace by taking those cares upon her
self or else a woman capable of entering
into his literary life. Few authors wives
have been of tne latter kind. A notable
instance, however, is afforded in the wife
of Alphonse Daudet. She is an invalua
ble literary assistant to her husband.
She takes his rough, corrected manuscript
and makes a clear copy, correcting at
the same time eny slight errors that may
have escaped her husband's notice.
Daudei then takes the manuscript in
hand again for final revision and careful
polishing. Mme. Daudet afterward re
writes the whole manuscript and sends it
to the press.

OUH reality that his hopes of married
happinesn had taruod like dead saa fruit,
to a*her. The pretty bride oecame the
domestic fury. A separation *oon fol

Dickeus' domestic troubles have never
been satisfactorily explained, but he said
it was a case of incompatibility of tem
per. I think it was a uase« of egregious
p»-.'tonal vanity on the part of Charles
Dickens. The amazing success of his
works raised him far above h's original
sooial position he became the friend of
Lady Blessington, Walter Savage, Lan
dor, Tennyson, Bulwer. and others, whose
refined nnd cultivated society made him
seek for happiness abroad rather than at
home. His geuius made him a peer of
the highest laud, but his wife remained
the same plain person who had shared
and solaced his early poverty and ob
ecurity. He btcame a social lion, whom
princes and nobles delighted to honor
hir duties, as the mother of nine ohild
ren, kept her at home, and *he was thus
prevented from cultivating the graces
snd acquiring the manner* which would
have fitted her for the aristocratic society
in which her hiisbnnd found both his
taste nnd his vanity gratified.
Life has beeu said to be a comedy to
those who think aud a tragedy to tnose
who feel eurely when Byron's life was a
profound tragedy, for of all the sons of
man few have felt more deeply than the
author of "Manfred." His noble brow
Wrtfl often darkened by a scowl, his classic
mouth was often disfigured by a Hneer,
but his heart was never deaa to affection.
He never turred with cold indifference
from sorrow and suffering, whether that
of a nation or that of an tudividutl. In
au uufortuunte moment he married a
woman who*c ould heart never responded
to his love, find who«e mafhemn'ical mind
oould not appreciate hit* generous enthus
iasm. Iu this oue year of married life
ho endured a lifetime of misery and
then, without a warning, aud assigning
no reason foi* her conduot, his wife left
him, and not only refused to return, but
would not answer his letters, and declined
to listen to hi* attempts to effect a recon
ciliaMon. She was moraly responsible for
his subsequent i regularities and early
death. It wits a glorious death, nnd a
worthy tertninauou of the most dazzling
literary career tho world has ever known:
but Lady Byron was not the less guilty
for driving to au early grave one so gift
ed aud so unhappy.
I have merely glanced at a tew illus
trious literary men whose wives have uot
only not contributed to their happiness,
but have been lead to their feet. On tho
other hand, 'here are many wives of lit
erary men who are tho sweet,sympathetic
oempanions of their husbands, but whoso
loveliness is seldom known to the world,
beoausetheir sweetness, like the perfume
of the violet, is hiddvn from the sight of
men. I recall at this moment the devoted
wife of the southern poet, Paul H. Hayne.
