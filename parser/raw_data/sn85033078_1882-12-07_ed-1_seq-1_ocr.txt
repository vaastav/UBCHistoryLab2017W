delivered to both houses of the 47th
congress immediately upon their re
assembling on Monday.
The President’s Message.
INTRODUCTION.
I'o the Si..Me and Howe of Repreecntativen of ihi
United Staten'.
Washington, Dec. 4. —lt is provided by tic.
'ODstitmion that the president shall, from time'
to time, pivc congress infonnation of tbs s;a*o of
tie union and recommend to their con
such measi't-cs • i he shall judge m ec.-. *a. y and ex

OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
In re. .ow.ng tho even 3 of the year which has
clapped sir.ee the commencement of the present
-•■salon, I feel gratified in cnll’ng your attention tc
die condition of our foreign affairs. Our in
■-orcourso with other powers has continued to
be of the most friendly character
■Such slight differences as have arisen during
.heyear, have been already settled cr likely to
• each an early adjustment. Tho a est of
citizens of the United States in Ireland, under the
iceent laws which owed their origin to tho di’-
turbed condition of that country, has led to a
somewhat extended correspondence with the gov
ernment of Great Britain, and a disposition tc
re.-pect our rights has been practically manifest
ed by the release of tho arrested pr-ties.
THE ISTHMUS CANAL.
The_ claim of the nation in regard t* the su
pervision and control of any inter-oceanie canal
across the American isthmus has continued to be
tho subject of conference. It is likely that t’me
will bo more powerful than discussion in remov
ing tho divergence between the two nations
whoso friendship is so closely connected by the
intimacy of their relations and community of
their interest.
Our 'ong 'established friendliness with Russia
has remained unbroken. It has prompted me
to proffer tho earnest counsel of ihi* government
that measures bo adopted for suppressing the
proscription which the Hebrew race in that
cuntry has I lately suffered. It has not tran
spired that any American citizen lias been sub
jicted to injury, and our.cou' icoim remonstrance
has nevertheless boon courteously received.
There Ls reason in the belief that tho time is not
tar distant when Russia will bo able to secure
toleration of all faiths within her border.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE MARKS.
At an international convention held in Paiis
in 1830, and attended by representatives f the
United States, an agreement was reached in re
spect to the protection of trade marks on patent
ed articles and rights of manufacturing firms, and
tho 00-operation of scientists in the adoption of a
common meter to meamre electric force.
In view ef tho frequent occurrence of confer
ences for the consideration of important matters
of common in'erest to civilized nations, I re
spectfully sjggcst that tho executive be Invested
by congress with discretionary power to send
delegates to sue a conventions, and that pro
vision be made to del ray expenses incident thereto.
TROUBLE WITH iPAIN.
The difference between the United States and
Spain as to tho effect of a judgment and a cer
tificate of naturalization bos not yet been adjust
ed, but it is hoped and believed negotiations now
in progress will result in the establishment of a
position which seems to this government, reason
able and Just.
I have already called the attention of congress
to tho fact that in the porta of Spain and its col
onies fees have lately been imposed upon vessel*
of tho United States for trivial effenses against
loca' regulations. Effort! fo( the abatement of
these exaction* have thus far proved unsuccess
lul. I regret to inform you also that the fees de
manded by Spanish consuls in American ports ar
in some case* so Urge when compared with the
value of the cargo as to amount, in effect, to a
considerable export duty, and that our remon
strances in this regard have not os yet receive' l
attention where they deserved it.
GERMAN INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION.
The German government has invited the 1’...
States to participate in an international exhibi
tion of domestic cattle, to be held ic Hamburg,
in July, 1883. If th-'s country is to bo repre
.-ented, it is important that in the early days of
this session, congress should make an appropri
ation for that purpose.
IT ALT.
Tho death of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to
Italy, has evoked from that government ex
pressions of profound re*pect for his exalted
character and for his honorable care in the diplo
matic service of his country. The Ita’ian gov
rnment has raised a question a* to tho propriety
■it recognizing in his duel capacity the repre
sentative of tliis country recently accredited both
as secretary of legation and as consul-general at
Rome. He has been receii ed a* secretary, but
his exequatur as oonsul-generiu ha* thus fax been
withheld.
BECCfUM.
Tho extradition convention with Belgium,
which has been in operation since 1874, has been
•ately supplemented by another. The senate has
-ignified its approval and ratifications have been
luly exchanged between the contracting coun
tries. To the list of extraditable crimes has been
mldcd that of assaaslnation or attempted assassi
nation of the chief of state.
SWITZERLAND.
Negotiations have been opened with Switzer
land looking to a settlement by treaty of the
question whether its citizens can renounce their
allegiances and become citizens of the United
States. lam happy to inform yon that the im
migration of paupers and criminals from certain
of iheeantons of Switzerlard have substantially
ceased, aid is no longer sanctioned by the au
•boitie--.
*V The consideration of thu subject prompt* the
tj+ that the act of August Sd. ISS2, which
has t£or i^ 3 object the return of foreign convict's to
their v-qw a eountiy. should be so modified as not
to be opfcn to f 'aud. It affeco the extradition
of criorinals on prefe. .ed charge* of crime.
THE OTTOMAN PCRTE
has not jkt *nted to tho interpretation which,
ibis govtwVui’ent has put up n tho treaty of 1830.
eo'acive toats juHsdictionr' right* in Turkey. It
“W.** .-f ,a said, however, tha this difference
will be adjjustcd by a genera ; revision of the sys
tem of jurisdiction of the United States in the
coo the east, a subject to which yeu~ at
tention V&as be n already ca’led by the seoi'eta> , v of
state. .
I CHINESE INDEMNITY FUND.
In .the interest of justice toward China and
lapa.n. I trust that the question of the return of
chrt indemnity fund to the governments of those
■countries will bo reached at the present sea on.
and the satiifaetory solution made which I have
already recommended and which has recently
■been foieshadowed by congress.
COREA.
The treaty lately concluded with Corea awaits
the action of the senate.
EGYPT.
During the late disturbance in Egypt, tic
timely presence of American vessels served as a
protection to the persons and property of many
of our own citizens and of citizens of o'htr
countries whose governments hare expressed th..r
thanks for this assistance.
THE CHIKESE QUESTION.
The *oeent legislation restricting immigration
of laborers from China bus given rise to the
■question of whether Chinese proceeding to and
from another country may lawfully pass through
our own. In construing ' the act of May 6th.
fin connection with the treaty of Nov. ”th,
1880, the .estriction would seem to be limited to
■Chinese immigrants coming to the United States
as laborers, and should not forbid a mere transit
across our territory. I ask the attention of con
gress to the subject for such action, if any. as
may be deemed advisable.
LIBBBIA.
This government has recently had occasion to
manifest interest in the republic of Liberia by
seeking to aid the amicable settlement of the
boundary dispute now passing between that re
public and the British possesion of Sierro Leon.
HAWAII.
The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will be
come terminated after September 9, 1883, on two
months’ notice by either party. While certain
provisions of that ■ compact may have proved
only tnerous, its existence has fostered com
mercial relations which it is important to pre
serve. 1 suggest, therefore, that early considera
tion be given to such modification of the treaty
as soem to be demanded by the interests of our
people.
*HAYTI AND SAN DOMINGO.
In view of our increasing trade with both Hay
ti and San Domingo, I advise that provision U
made for diplomatic intercourse with the latter
by enlarging the scope of the mission at Port au
Prince. I regret that a certain class of Ameri
can citizens arrayed against the government of
Hayti. have thus far beeu urged unavailingly to
desist.
PERU, BOLIVIA AND CHIU.
The war between Peru abd Bolivia on the om
siue, and Chili on the other, began more than 1
iwo years ago by the eccupatioa by Chili in'
ISSO of all thelatteral territory of Bolivia. Ne
gotiations for peace were conducted under the
direction of the United States. The others re
fused to concede any territory, but Chili has
since become master of the whole coast
of both countries and of the capitol of
Peru. A year since, as you have already
been advised by correspondence transmitted,
to you in January lasi, this government sent a 4
special mission to the beliggerant powers to tx-.
press the hops that Chili would be disposed to ac-|
cept a money indemnity for the expenses of thi<
war and to relinquish her demand for a portion
of the territory fer her antagonist. This recom
mendation, which Chili declined to follow, this,
government did not assume to enforce nor
can it be enforced without resort to
measures which would be in keeping
neither with the temper of our people nor with,
the spirit of our institutions. The power of Peru
no longer extends over its whole territory, and
in the event of our interference to dictate peace,
it would need te be supplemented by the army
and navy of the United States. Such in
terference would almost inevitably lead
to the establishment of a protectorate,
a result utterly at odds with ou*- past policy,
injurious to our present interests, and lull ol
embarrassments for the future for the termina-,
tion of hostilities on towns, at once, just (o the
victorious nation, and generous to its adversaries.
This government has spared no effort s to save
such as might involve the complications which I
have indicated. It is gi-eatly to be deplored that
Chili seems resolved to exact such rigorous condi
tions of peace and is indisposed to submit to arbi
tration the terms of an amicable settlement. No
peace is likely to be lasting that is not sufficiently
equitable and just to command the approval of
other nations.
WASHINGTON PEACE CONFFJIENCE.
About a year rince invitations were extended
the nations of this continent to send representa
tives to a peace congress to assemble at Wash
ington in November, 1882. The time of meeting
was fixed at a period then remote in the hope, as
the invitation itself declared, that in the mean
time the disturbances between South American
republics would bo adjusted. As that expecta
tion seamed unlikely to bo realized, I asked
in April iast for an expression of opinion
from the two bosses of congress, as to the ad
visability of holding the convention at the time
appointed. This action was prompted in part by
doubts which matnre reflection had suggested,
whether diplomatic usage and the traditions of
the government did not make it fitting that the
executive should consult the representatives of
the people before pursuing a line of policy some
what novel in its character and far reaching in
its possible consequences. In view of the fact
that no action was taken by congress in the,
premises, and no provision had been made for;
necessary expenses, I subsequently decided to
postpone the and so notified the
several governments which had been Invited to
attend. lam unwilling to dismiss this subject
without assuring you of my support of any
measures congress may devise for the promotion
of peace on this continent, and throughout the
world, and I trust that the time is near, when
with the universal asent of civilized people, all
Intel-national differences will be determined with
out resort to arms by the benignant process of
arbitration.
DIPLOMATIC CHANGES.
Changes have occurred in the diploma ic repre
sentation of several foreign powers during
the past year. New ministers from the Argentine
Republic, Austria, Hungary, Brazil, Chili, China
France, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and
Prussia have presented their credentials. The
missions of Denmark and of Venezuela at this
capital have been raised in grade. Switzerland
has created a plenipotentiary mission to this
point, and an embassy from Madagascar and a
minister from Spain will shortly ar
rive. Our diplomatic intercourse has
been enlarged by the establishment of relations
with the new kingdom of Servia, by the creation
of a mission to Siam and by the restoration of
the mission to Greece. The Shah of Persia has
expressed hi* gratification that a charge d’ affairs
will shortly be sent to that country where tho
lights of of cur citizens have been courteously
gu*-ded by the representatives of Great Britain.
COLLISIONS AT SEA.
I renew my recommendation of such legisla
tion as will place the United States in harmony
with other powers In respect to international
rules far the prevention of collisions at sea. In
conformity with your joint re elation of the 3d
nf August last, I bare directed the secretary of
itate to address foreign governments in respect
\o a proposed conference tor considering the
subject of the universal adoption of a common
prime to be used in the reckoning of
longitude and the regulation of time throughout
iUo civilized world. Their replies will, in due
nine, bo laid before vou.
INTERCHANGE OE NATIONAL DOCUMENTS.
An agreement was reached at Paris, in 1875.
between the principal powers for the interchange
of official publications through the medium of
Jthoir respective foreign departments. This ad
mirable custom, which has been built up by
tke enterprise of the Smithsonian institute, offe-ed
practical bask for our co-operation in this
jbehome, and an arrangement has boon effected by
which that institution will perform tho necessary
labor by direction of the department of state.
,A reasonable comptnsation therefor should be
provided by law.
THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE.
A clause of the act making appropriations for the
diplomatic and consular service, contemplates
ithe reorganization of both branches of such ser
vice on a salaried basis, leaving fees to inure to
the benefit of the treasury. I cordially favor
such a project as likely to correct abuses in the
present system. The secretary of state will pre
sent to you at an early date, a plan for such or
ganization.
THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
A full and interesting-exhibit of the operations
of tho treasury department, is afforded by the re
port of the secretary.

1 recommend to your attention the secretary’s
views in respect to the likelihood of a serious e n
traction of this circulation, aud tho mode* bv
which that, result may be in bis judgment
averted,
SILVER CERTIFICATES AND COINAGE OF SILVER.
In respect to the coinage of silver dollars and
■die retirement of silver certificates, I have seen
nothing to alter, but much to confirm the senti
ments to which I gave expression last year. A
comparison between the respective amounts of
silver dollar circulation on November, 1881, aud
on November, 1882, shows a slight increase of a
million aad a half dollars, but daring the inter
val there bad been in the whole number coined
an increase of twenty-six millions of the one
hundred aad twenty-eight millions thus
far minted. A little more than thirty
five millions are in circulation. The
mass of accumulated coin has grown so great
that the vault room at preem available for stor
age is scarcely sufficient to contain it. It is not
apparent why it is desirable to continue the coin
age now so enormously in excess of public de
mand.
As to the silver certificates, in addition to the
grounds which seemed last year to justify their
retirement, may be mentioned the effect which is
likely to ensue from tho supply of gold certificates,
for the issuance of which congress recently made
provision, and which are new in active circulation.
THE REDUCTION OF REVENUE*.
You cannot fail to note with interest the dis
cussion by tho secretary as to the necessity of
providing by legislation soma mode of freeing
the treasury of an excess of assets in Tie event
that congress fails to reach an eaxly agreement
for the redaction of taxation. I hereby approve
the secretary’s recommendation f an imnediate
and extensive reduction la the annual revenues of
the government. It will be remembered that I
urged upon congress at it* last session the im-,
portanci of relieving the induitry and enterprise i
of the country from the pressure of unnecessary
taxation. It is one of the truest maxim* ef polit
ical economy that all taxes are burdensome,
however) wisely and prudently imposed, and
though there have always been among our peo
ple wide differences of sentiment as to the best
methods of raising the national revenue, and in
deed as to the principles upon which taxation
should be based there has been substantial accord
in the doctrine that only such taxes ought to bo
levied os are necessary ter the wise and economi
cal administration of government. Of late the
public revenues have exceeded that limit, aud un
less checked py appropriate legislation, such ex
cess will continue to increase from year to year
For the fiscal year ended June 30th, 1881, the
surplus was more than $145,000,000. The report
of the secretary shews whnt disposition has been
made of those moneys. They have not only an
swered the requirements of the sinking fund but
have afforded a large balance applicable to other
reductions of ths public debt. Bat I renew the
expression of the conviction that such rapid ex
tinguuhment of the national indebtedness as is
now taking place is by ae means a cause for con
gratulations. It is a cause rather for serious ap
prehension.
If it continues, it mast speedily be {followed by
on* of th >e evil resak* so clearly set forth in the
report of the secretary; either tho surplus must
b* idle in the treasury, or the government will be
forced to buy at market rate* its bonds not then
redeemable, and which, under such circum
stances, cannot fail to command an euormou*
premium; or the smaller revenues will be devoted
to extravagant expenditures which, as experi
ence has taught us, Is ever the bane of the over
flowing treasury.
It was made apparent in the ©curse of the an
imated discussion which this question s *ou*ed at
the las: session ef eongiess that the pahey •(
diminishing the revenue by reducing taxation
oemmanded general approval of the members ef
both houses. I regret that because of the conflict
ions as to the best methods by which that policy
should be made operative, more of its beneAts
hare not been reaped. In fulflUlment of what I
deem my constitutional duty, but with little hope
that I con make valuable contribution to this
vexed question, I shall proceed to intimate
briefly my own views in relation to It.
presided Arthur's plan for reducing
TAXATION.
Upon the showing of our j'ofiancial condition at
the close of the last fiscal year, I felt justified in
recommending to congress vhe abolition of inter
val rcvince, oiicpt yiia i po- luhavr* m .tr ia.
ru.us f i tu<* aid upon Jit. ti.cl B|in*.s an •• r
llo ted >*•. ami except in- ipsciui iu <
upon the manufacturer ana dealer* in such ar.i
clos. I '.inure bow lo suggest that unlcs* il
shall be a *ov rial a tod that the probable expendi
tures of the government ft r the coming year have
been under estimated, the interai taxes, save
those wtiieh relate to distilled spirits, can bo pru
dently abrogated.
Such a reduction, accompanied by a simplifica
tion of the machines of collection, which would
then beiasyof accomplishment, reason -
ably be expected to result in diminishing the cost
of such collection by at least two millions and a
half of dollars and in the retirement from office
from 1,500 to 2,000 persons. The system of ex
cise duties has never commended itself to the fa
vor of the American people, and has never been
resorted to except for supplying deficiencies in
the treasury, when, by‘reason of special exigen
cies, the duties on imports have proved inade
quate to the needs of the government.
The sentiment of the country doubtless com
mends the present excise law shaU be abolished
as soon as such course can safely be pursued. It
seems to me, however, for various reasons, so
sweeping a measure, as the total abolition oi in
to nil tax, would for the present be an unwise
step. Two of these reasons are deserving of
special mention:
First, it is by no means clear that even if the
existing system of duties on imports as contin
ued without modification, that those duties alone
will yield sufficient revenue for all the needs of
the government. It is estimated that one hun
dred millions of dollars will bo required for
pensions during the coming year, and it may wa 1
be doubted whether the maximum annual de
mand for that object has yet been reached. Un
certainty upon tats question would alone justify
is my judgment the retention for the present of
that portion of the system of internal revenue
which is least objectionable to the people.
Second, a total abolition of excise taxes
would almost prove a if not unaurmount
ab!e, objection to a thorough revision of the
tariff, and to any considerable reduction in im
port duties.
THE PRESENT TARIFF SYSTEM
is, in many respects unjust. It makes an une
qual distribution both of ita hardens and its
benefits. This fact was especially recognized by
a majority of each house of the pas
sage of the act creating the tariff commission.
The report of that commission will be placed be
fore you at the beginning of this session and will,
I trust, afford you such information m to the
condition and prospects of the various commer
cial, agricultural, mining, manufacturing and
other interests of the country, and contain such
suggestions lor statutory revision as will practi
cally aid your action upon this important subject.
The revenue from customs for the fiscal year
ending June SO, 1879, amounted to $137,000,000.
It has in the three succeeding years reached
first, $136,000,000, then $193,000,000, and final
ly, as has been already stated, $120,000,000.
The income from this service for the fiscal year
which will end on Juno 30th, ISB3, will doubtless
be considerably in excess of the sum last men
tioned. If the lax on domestic spirits is to be
retained, it is plain, therefore, that large reduc
tions from the customs revenue are entirely feasi
ble. "While recommending this reduction, lam
far fiom advising the abandonment of the policy
of discr.mmating in the adjustment of the detail* so
as to afford aid and protection to deraestio labor.
But the present system should bo so revised as to
equalize th& public’s burden among all classes
and occupations, and bring it into closer har
mony with the present me is of the public interest.
Without entering into minute details which,
undtr present circumstances, is quhe unnecessary,
I rteommend an en’argement of the free list so
as to include within it the numerous articles
which yield considerable revenue, a simplification
of the complex and inconsistent schedule of
duties upon certain manufactures, and particu
larly those upon cotton, ir-n and, steel, and a
iobstamial reduction of duties upon those ar
ticles, and upon sugar, molasses, elk, wool and
woolen good*. It a general revision of the
tariff shall bo found to le impracticable at this
session, I express the hope that at least some oi
the more conspicuous inequalities of the present
law may bo corrected before year final adjonro
aient. One of them is especially referred to hy
the secretary. la view of a recent decision of the
supreme oourt the necessity of amending the
law by which the duties on standard of o dor is
adopted as tbo teat of saccharine strimjch of
sugars, ie too obvious to require comment *
RETIREMENT OF ABMV OFFICERS.
The -ocrota-jy of war calls at eati.n to the fact
that an embarrassment growing of of the re
cent act of congress, making >h retirement of
officers of the army compulsory at the ago of 64,
with the act of IStS, is still in force, which limi's
to four hundred the number of those who can be
retired far disability or upon their own applica
tion. The two acts, when construed together,
seem to forbid tbo retiring, eren fur absolute in
capacity, of officers who do not fall within the
purview of the latter statute, at such times as
there chance to be less than 400 names on thr
retired list. There are now 420. It is not likely
that congress intended this result, and I concur
with the rccretary that the law ought to be
amended.
SUES ASi HARBOR BILLS.

harbors,” which became a law near the close of
your session, prompt me to express the opinion
that no similar measure will be deemed necessary
during the present session of ootigress. Indeed,
such a measure would now be open to a serious
objection in addition to that which was lately
urged on your attention. lam informed by the
secretary of war that the greater portion ol the
sum appropriated tor the various items specified
in that act remains unexpended. The new
works, for which authorized expenses have been
incurred, are only two, for which the total ap
propriation was $210,009. The prisont available
balance >e disclosed by the following tables:
Amount of apppropriatitra by
act of August 2,1882 $13,738,875
Amount of appropriation by act
of June 19, 1882 10,000
Amount of appropriation for
payments to J. B. Eads 304,000
Unexpended balance of former
appropriation 4,738,263
Total 23,791,138
L"ss amount drawn from treas
ury between Jaly 1,1882, and
November 30, 1882 6,058.194
Total 17,734,914
It is apparent br this exhibit that so fur ns
concerns most of tne items to which the act f
August 2nd, ISB2 relates, there can be no need ot
further appropriations until after the close of ti e
present session. If, however, any action should
bo necessary In respect* to particular objects it
would be entirely feasible to provide for those ob
jeets by appropriate legislation, It is possible.
lor example, that a deiay until the assembling ol
the next congress to make additional
provision) for the Mississippi river improve
ment might be attended with serious con
sequences. If such should appear to be the
case, a just bill relating to that subj ect would
command my approval. This leads me to offer
a suggestion whiah I trust will commend itself is
the w&dom of congress. Is it not advisable tb ht
the granis of large sums of money for divers and
independent schemes of internal improvement
should be made the subjects of separate and dis-.
tinct kgUiative enactments. It will hardly be
gainsaid even Wy those who favor the moat liberal
expenditures for such purposes as are sough to
be acotituplished by what is commonly called the
river and harbor biß, that the practice of group
ing in each a bill appropriations for a great di
versity of objects widely separated either in their
nature or the locality with which they are con
cerned, or in both, as one which is much to be
deprecated, as its inevitable tendeney is to secure
the success of the bSI as a whole, though many
of the items, if separately considered, ooula scarce
ly fail of rejection. By the adoption of the course
I have recommended, ever / member of congress
when an opportunity should arise j for giving his
influence and veto for meritorious appropriations,
would bo enabled so to do without being calico
upon to sanction others undeserving of nis ap
proval. So, aiao, would the executive be afforded
full opportunity to exercise his constitutional pre
rogative of opposing whatever appropriations
seemed to him objectionable, without imperilling
the success of others which commended themselvec
to hie judgment. It may be urged in opposition
to these sugjpstions that the namber of works of
internal improvement which are justly entitled to
governmental aid is so great as to render imprao
doable separate appr.priation bills therefor, and
even for such comparatively limited number as
make disposition of large sums of money. This
vbjeetioD may be well founded, and wbethe* it be
or not. the advantages that weald be likely te
ensue by the ad op lien of the course I have re
commended may perhaps be mere effectually at
tained by another which I respectfully submit to
congress as an alternative proposition.
It is provided by the constitutions of 14 of our
•tales that the executive may disapprove any
item or items of a bill appropriating money,
whereupon pan of the bill approved shall he Law
and the part disapproved shall fail to beesme
law, unless repaired, according to the provisoes
prescribed for the passage of bills ever the veto
of the executive. The states wherein some such
provisions, as the loregoing, is a fundamental
law, are Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia,
Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey
New York, Penes jlvania and West Virginia.
I commend to your careful c< nsideration tic
fjestiou whether the amendment of ihe fid r;si
• institution in the particular indicat and would not
• fiord the best remedy for wha is often a grave
•aibarrassment both to the memue of congrc-s
id to the executive, and is sometimes a serious
p sl>lic mischief.

THE JEANNETTE.
On the 12tof Decembo* ,1331, information was
revived :ha the exploring steame* Jeannette
had been crushed end abandoned in tho arctic
ccoan. The officers and crew, after a journey
• vor the ice, embarked in three boats for the'
Masts of Siberia. One of the parties under the
command of Chief Engineer George W. Melville,
reached the land and falling in with natives was
saved. Another under Lieutenant Commander
DiLong, landed in a banco egion near the
mouth of the Lena river. After six weeks had
elapsed, all but two of the number bad d*ed from
fatigue and starvation. No tidings have keen re
ceived from tho pa-ty in tho third boat under the
command of Lieut. Chipp, but a long and fruitless
investigation, leaves little doubt that all its num
b*r perished *n .he sea. Asa slight tribute to
their he r oism. I give in this communieateon the
names of the gallant men who sacrificed their
live# in the expedition:
Lieut. Com. Geo. W. Delong; Surgeon J. M.
Ambler; J. J. Collins, Hans 11. Erickson, Her

Wall. Shutbell, Albert C. Kulhne, Edwin Star.
Henry’Warren and Peter E. |Johnson. Lieut.
Giles B. Harbor and Master W. H. Schoutskisch
are now bringing home the remains of Lieut. Dj
Long and his comrades.
In pursuance of the dircciion of congress ihe
Rodgers, fitted out for the relief of the Jeanette
in accordance with the act of congress of March
3d, 1881, sailed from San Francisco Juno 16 un
der the command of Lieut. Robert M. Berry. Ou
Nov. 30th she was accidentally destroyed by ffr*'
while in winter quarters of St. Lawrence Bay, but*
lolficets and crew succeeded in escapingjto the land.
Lieutenant Berry and one of his officers after
making a search for the Jeannette along tho
coast of Siberia, fell in with Ch ef Engineer
Melville’s party, and returned home by way of
Europe. The other officers and crew of the
Rodgers were brought f.om St. Lawrence Bay bv
the whaling steamer North Star. Mr. CL'. A.
Hillman, who bad been placed in charge of a de
pot of supplies at Cape Zerdare, returning to his
post from St. Lawrence Bay in a blinding now
storm, was carried out to sea and lost, notwith
standing all efforts to rescue him.
It appears by the secretary’s report that the
AVAILABLE NAVAL FORCE
of the United States consists of thirty-seven
cruisers, four singlc-turrcted monitors built dur
ing the rebellion, a large number of smooth bore
guns and parrot rifles, and eighty-seven rifled
cannon. Tne v uising vessels th.uld be gradual
ly replaced by i -n or steel ships, the monitors by
modern armored vessels and the armament to high
power rifled guns. The reconstruction of our
navy which was recommended in the last mes
sage wa begun by congress authorizing, in a re
cent act, the construction of two large unarmor
ed steel vessels of the character recom
menced by the late navy advisory
board and subject to the final approval
of anew advisory board to be organized as pro
vided by that act. I call your attention to the
recommendation ot the secreta/ 7 and the board,
:hat authority bo given to construct two more
truisers of smalie dimensions, and one fleet dis
patch vessel, and that appropriations be ’'made for
nigh power rifled cannon for toipedo service and
for other haibor defenses. Pending consideration
by'congress of the policy hereafter to be adopted,
ia constructing tke eight large navy yards and
.lieir expensive establishments, the secretary ad
ocated a reduction of exceaduare therefor to
. ae lowest possible amount.*
TRANSFER OF THE LIGHT HOUSE SERVICE.
For the purpose of affording the officers and
ettmea of the navy opportunities of exercise and
lisoiplino in their profession, under appropriate
jontrol and directions, the secretary advises that
the light-house service and coast survey be trans
ferred, as now organized, from the treasury to
the navy department, and he also suggests, for
ihe reasons which he assigns, that a similar
tranfer may wisely be made of the cruising rev
enue vessels The secretary forcibly depicts the
intimate connection and interdependence of
THE NATV AND THE COMMERCIAL MARINE,
and invites attention to the continued decadence
of the latter and the corresponding transfer of
our growing commerce to foreign bottoms. This
•abject is one of the utmost importance to the
national welfare. Methods of reviving American
.•hip building and of restoring the United States
flag on the ocean carrying trade should receive
the Immediate attention of congress. We have
mechanical skill and abundant material for the
manufacture of modern iron steamships in fair,
competition with onr commercial rivals. Our dis
advantage in building ships is the greater cost of,
labor and sailing them, high tax and greater in
terest on capital. While the ocean highways are
already monopolized by cur formid
able competitors, these obstacles should
in some way be overcome, and for rapid commu
nication with foreign lands we should not continue
to depend wholly on vessels built ia the yards of
other countries and sailing under foreign flags.
With no United States steamer on the principal
' ocan linos, or for any foreign parts, our facili
ties for extending our commerce are greatly re
* meted, while the nations which build the ships
ind cafry the mail and passengers, obtain there
by conspicuous advantages in increasing their
trade.
REDUCTION OF LETTER POSTAGE.
At the last session of congress several bills
were introduced into the house of representa
tives for the reduction of letter postage to the
rate of two cents per one-halt ounce. I have
given much study and reflection to this subject,
and am thoroughly persuaded that such a re
daction would bo for the best interests of the
public. It has been the policy of the govern
ment, from its foundation, t defray, as far
as possible, the expense of carrying the mails by
a direct tax in the form of postage. It ha?
never been claimed, however, that this service
ought tto. be productive of a net revenue.
Ae has been stated already,The report of the post
master general shews there is now a very consid
erable surplus in his department, and that
henceforth receipts are likely to increase in a much
greater ratio than necessary expenditure. Un
less some change is made ia the existing laws, the
profits of the postal service will, in a very few
years, swell tire revenues of the government
many millions of dollars. The time seems
sc-omr auspicious, therefore, for some reduction
m rates or postage. In what shall that reduc
tion consist? A review oi the legislation wbioh
has been had upon this subject during the last
thirty years discloses that domestic letters consti
tute the only class of mail matter which has
never been favored with a substantial redaction
sf rates. I am convinced that the burden
of maintaining the services falls most unequally
on that class, and that more than any other it is
satitled to present relief. That such relief may
bo extended without detriment to other public in
terests will be discovered by reviewing the results
•f former reductions. Immediately prior to the
act of 1545, the postage on a letter composed ol
a angle sheet was. vie: If conveyed thirty miles
or less, six cents; between thirty and eighty mile?,
10 cents; between eighty and one hundred and
fifty miles, 12 % cents; between one hundred and,
fifty and lour hundred miles, 13 J£ cants: over four
hundred miles, 25 cents. By the act of 1845 the
postage en a single letter conveyed for any dis
tance under 300 miles, was fixed at five cents, and
for any greater distance 10 cents. By the act of
1851, it was provided that a single letter if pre-
Dai and. should be carried any distance not exceed
ing 300 miles for three cents, and any greater dis
tance six cents. It will be noticed that both
these reductions were of a radical character and
relatively quite as important as that now pro--
rused. in each case There ensued a temporary
loss of revenue, but a sudden aid large influx of
business which paid that loss in three years. Un
less the experience of past .egislakion in this
country and elsewhere goes for naught, it may be
safely predicted that a stimulus of a fifty per
cent, reduction tax for carriage would at once in
crease the number of letters consigned to the
mails. The advantages of secrecy would lead to
a very general substitution of scaled packets
for post cards and open circulars, and in divers
o.hcr ways tho volume of first class matter would
be enormously augmented. Such an increase
amounted in England the first year after the
aloptionof a penny postage to more than 125
per cent.
As the result of a careful estimate, the detals
of which cannot here be set out, I have become
convinced that the deficiency for the first year
liter the proposed reduction would not exceed
seven per cent, of expenditures, or $3,000,000,
while the deficiency after the reduction of 1845
was more than 14 per cent, and after that of 185]
*t was 27 per cent.
ANOTHER INTERESTING COMPARISON
i afforded by statistics furnished me by ihe post
ilfiee department; The act of 1845 was Dai> and
in the face of the fact that there existed a tK
fide icy of more than §30,000. That of 1851 was
encouraged b” the slight surplus of §132.000.
The excess of revenue in tho next fiscal yeai i?
littely fo he §3,500,000. If cengress should ap
prove .hese suggestions, it maybe deemed deshu,-
ble to supply to some extent the deficiency which
must for the lime result, by increasing i lie charge
for carrying merchandise, which is now only 16
cents per pound. But even without such an in
crease, I am confident the receip'3 under tho di
minished rates, would equal the expenditures after
the lapse of three or four years.
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
The report of the department of justice brings
anew to your notice the necessity of enlacing
the present system of federal jurisprudence so a*
to effectually answer the requirement of our in
creasing litigation with which it is called upon Uv
deal. The attorney general reviews the sugges
tions of his predecessor,that in the interest of jus
tice,bet;er provisions than the existing law affords
should be made in certain judicial districts for fix
ing the fees of witnesses and jurors.
THE STAR ROUTE CASES.
In my message of December last, I referred to
pending criminals proceedings growing out of the
alleged frauds in what is known as the star
route service of the postoifice department, and ad
vised you that I had enjoiaed upon the attor
ney general and associate counsel to whom the in
terests of the government were intrusted, the
duty of prosecuting with the utmost vigor
of the law, all persons who might be found
chargeable with those offences. A trial of one
of these cases has since occurred. It occupied for
many weeks the attention of the supreme court
of this district, and was conducted with great zeal
and ability. It resulted in a disagreement of the
jury, but the causes have again been placed upon
the calendar and will shortly bo retried, If any
guilty persons shall finally escape punishment for
their offences it will not be for lack of diligent
and urgent work of the prosecution.
A BANKRUPT LAW.
I trait that some agreement will be reached
which will speedily aid eongress, with the concur
rence of the executive, to afford the commercial
c*mmnnity the benefit of a national bankrupt
law.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The report of the secretary of the interior,
with its accompanying documents presents a full
statement of the varied operations of that depart
ment. In respect to Indian affairs nothing has
occurred whica has changed or seriously modified
the views to which I devoted much space in a
former eommmnication to congress. I renew the
recommendations therein contained as to ex
tending to the Indians the protection of law, al
lotting land in severa'ty to such,as deserved it,
and making suitable provision for the
education of the young. Such provision
the secretary forcibly maintains
will prove unavailing unless it is broad
enough to include all those who are able and
willing to make use of it, and should not solely
relate to intellectual training but also instruction
in such manual labor and simple industrial arts
as can bo made practically available.
Among other impoitant subjects which are in
cluded in the secretary’s report, and which will
doubtless furnish occasion lor congressional ac
tion, may be mentioned the neglect of railroad
companies, to which large grants ofland were
made by acts of 1562 and 1804, to take the title
thereto and their consequent equitable exemption
from local taxation.
AN ALARMING STATE OF ILLITERACY.
No survey of our material condition can fail
to suggest inquiries as to the moral and intellect
ual progress of the people. The census returns
disclose an alarming state of illiteracy in certain
portions of the country where the provisions for
•bhools are grossly inadequate. It is a mo
mentous question for the decision of congress
whether immediate substantial aid should be ex
tended by the general government for the sup
plementing efforts of private beneficiaries of
state and territorial legislation in behalf ot edu
cation.
REGULATION OF INTERNAL COMMERCE.
The regulation of internal commeica has al
ready been a subject of your deliberations. One
of the inoid nts of the extension of the tailw y
•ystem of the country has been the adoption <
such measures by corporations whic'-t own or co
- the roads as lias tended to impair the ah an
‘ages of healthful competition, and make hurtful
discriminations in the adjustment of freightage.
These inequalities have beea correcred in several
of the states by appropriate legislation, the effect
of which is necessarily rcs'r ictod to the limits cf
their own territory. So far as such mischiefs af
fect commerce between states as between any of
the states of a foreign couatry, they are subjects
of national concern, and congress alone can af
ford rc'ief.
THE POLYGAMY QUESTtON.
The results which have thus far attended the
mforcament of the recent statute for the surjnres
tion of polygamy in the territories, are
by the secretary of the interior. It is not prob
able that any additional legislation ni this regard
will be deemed desired until the effect of existing
laws can be more closely observed and studied. I
congratulate you that the commissioners under
whose supervision .‘those laws have been ‘put into
operation, are encouraged o believe the evil at
which they are aimed may bo suppressed without
reso-1o t-ueh radical measures as in some quart
■ij have been thought indispmsible for success.
The close’-elation of he general government to
icrritotie preparing to be great sta'es, may well
engage yonr special attention. It ii there In
dian disturbances mainly occur, and that polyga
my has found room for growih. I cannot doubt
?nt a caieful stuvey of territorial legislation
would be of the highest utility; that thereby life
and property would become more secure, the lia
bility of outbreaks between Indians and whites
would be lessened, the public domain would be
more securely governed, and better progress be
made on the instruction of the young.
ALASKA
Alaska i still without any form of civil gov
eminent. If means were provided for the educa
tion of is people and tor the protection of their
lives ana piopertv, ihe immense resources of that
region would invite peimanent settlement, and
opt i a field for industry and enterprise.
.THE A6RICULTURAL BUREAU.
The report of the commissioner of agriculture
presents an account of the labors of that depart
ment during the past year, and includes informa
tion of much interest to the general public. The
condition of the forests of the country and the
wasteful manner in which their destruction is
taking place, gives cause for serious
apprehension. Their action ia pro
tecting the earth’s surface in modifying
the extremes of climate and regulating and sus
taining tha -flow of springs and streams, is not
well understood and their importance in relation
to the growth and prosperity of the country can
not be safely disregarded. They' are fast uisap
peatjng before destructive fires and the legitimate
requirements of our increasing population and
their total extinction cannot be long delayed, un
less better methods than now prevail shall be
adopted for their protection and cultivation. The
attention of congress is called to the necessity
of additional legislation to preserve valuable
forests still remaining on the
public domain, especially in tne extreme western
states and territories, where the necessity for
their preservatson is greater than in less monn
tainous regions, and where the prevailing dry
ness of the climate renders restoration, it they
are once destroyed,'well nigh impossible.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
The communication which I made to congress
at ill first ression, in December last, had a some
what full statement of my sentiments in relation
to the principles and rules which ought to gov
ern appointments to public service. Referring to
the various plans which theretofore had been
subjected to discussion in the national
legislature, plans which were'' in the main
modeled upsn the system which has obtained in
Great Britain, but which lacked oer tain promi
nent features by which that system i: distin
guished, I felt bound to intimate my doubts
whether they or any of them would afford an
adequate remedy for the evils which they aimed
to create. I declared, nevertheless, that it this
proposed measure should prove acceptable to
congress they would receive the executive signa
ture to the suggestions submitted for your con
sideration. There has been no legislation upon
the subject to which they relate, but
there has, in the meantime, been an
increase in ihe public talk on that subject,
and the people of the country, apparently with
out distinction or party, bave in various ways
and upon frequent occasions, given expressions to
their earnest wish for prompt and definite action.
In my judgment such action should no longer bi
postponed. I may add that my own sense of it
pressing importance has been quickened by ob
seryation in a practical phase of the matter t.-
which attention has more than once been called
by my predecessor. Tho civil list now comprises
about one hundred thousand persons, the larger
part of whom must, under the terms of the con
stitution, be selected by the president either di
rectly or through his own appointees.
the early years of the administration of the
government the personal direction of appoint
ments in the civil service maj not have boon an
irksome task for the executive, but now that the
burden has increased fully a hundred-fold it has
become greater than lie ought to bear, and it
necessarily diverts his time and attention from
the proper discharge of other duties no less ccli
cate and responsible, and which, in the very na
ture of things, cannot be delegated to other
hands. In thejudgment of not a few who have
given study and iejection to this matter, the na
tion has outgrown tlie provisions which thocon-ti
tution has established tor fi ling the minor offices in
the public service. But, whatever may be thought
of the wisdom or expediency of chang ng the fun
damen al law in tnis regard, it is certain tba
much relict may be afforded, not only to the
president and to the heads of *be departments,
but to senau-ts and r presentatives in congress b>
discreet legislation. They wsuld bo protected in
a great measure by the bill now pending before
the senate, or by any other whioh should em
body its important features, from'tho pressure of
personal importunity and from the labor of ex
amining confiding claims and pretentions of candi
dates. I trust that before the close of the present
session some decisive action may be taken for the
correction of hills which inherit the prosen
methods of appointment, and I assure you of
my hearty co-operation in any measures which
are likely to conduce to that, end. As to the
most appropriate term and tenor of the official
subordinate employes of the government it seems
to be generally agreed that whatever their ex
tent or charecter, the one should be definite and
the other stable and that neither should bo regu
lated by the zeal in the service of the party or fi
delity to the fortunes of an individual.
It matters little to the people at largo wha
competent person is at the head of this depart
ment o> that bureau if they feel 'assu-ed that
the removal of one and the accession of another
will not involve the retirement of honet; and
faithful subordinates whose duties are purely
administrative and have no legitimate connection
with the triumph of any political party o fac
tion. It is to this latter caiss of officers that the
senate bill to which we have already re
fe ed exclusively applies, while neitht. thn
bill nor any other prominent scheme for
improving the civil service concern’ the
higher grade o officers who rra
appointed by the president and confirmed by the
senate.
THE PRESIDENT DEFENDS HIMSELF.
I feel bound to comet a prevalent mis
apprehension as to the frequency with which the
presen' executive has dispJaced the incumbent of
an office and appointed another in his-'Slead. it
has been repeat.dly alleged that ho has in this
particular tignally departed from the course
which .ias been pursued under recent administra
tions of the government. The facts are as fol
lows: The whole number of executive appoint
ments during the four years immediately pre
ceding Mr. Uarfiald’s accession to the presidency
wa-- ot this number 244, or 9 per cent., in
volved in the removal of previous incumbents.
The ratio of removals to the whole number of ap
pointments was much the same during each of
those four years. In the first year with 790 ap
pointments there were 74 removals, or 8.3 per
cent; in the second, with if 17 appointments there
were 85 rt uovals or 9.3 per cent; in the third,
with 480 appointments there were 48 removals,
or 10 per cent; in the fourth, with appoin'-
ments there were 47 removals or 8.6 per cent, i u
the four months of President Garfield’s admiuis-
Ut ration there were 390 appointments and 89 re
movals, or 22.7 per cent. Precisely
be ssme number of removals, 89, has
taken place in the fourteen months which have
inco elapsed, but they constitute only 7.8 per
cent, of the whole number of appointments (1,118)
within that period, and less than 2.6 per cent ot
the cm re list of officials (3,459), (exclusive of the
s- or and navy, which is filled by presidential
appointment),
POLITICAL ASSESSMENT*.
I declare my approval of such legislation a*
may be found necessary for supplanting the ex
isting provisions of the law in relation to politi
cal assessments. In July last I authorized a
public announcement that employes of the gov
ernment. should regard themselves as at liberty
to exercise their pleasure in making or refusing
to make political contributions, and that
their action in that regard would in no manner
affect their'official status. In this announcement
I acted upon the view which I had always main
tained and still maintain, that a public officer
should be absolutely free, as any other citizen, to
give or withhold a contribution for the aid of
the political party of his choice. It has, however,
been urged, and doubtless not without foundation,
that such contributions have at times been ob
tained from persons whose only motive for giving
has been the fear of what might befall them if
they relused. |lt goes without saying, that
such contributions are not voluntary .;In my judg
ment, their ,’collection .should be prohibited by
aw. A bill which will effectually suppress them
wrl receive my cordial approval,
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
I hope that, however numerous and urgent
may be the demands upon your attention, .he in
terests of this district will rot bc.forgotten. The
denial to its residents of the great right of suf
frage in all its relation to national, state and
municipal affairs imposes on congress the duty of
affording the best admiaistra'ion which its wis
dom can devise.
The report of the district eomm ssionc's indi
cates certain measures whose adoption would
seem to be very desirable. I instance in particu
lar those which relate to arrears of tax;s, to
steam railroads, and to the assessment o', real
property.
COUNTING THE VOTES FOR PRESIDENT.
Among the questions which have been the topic
of ixcc-n debate in the halls of congre.-i
none are of greater gravity than
those relating to the ascertainment ol
the vote for president and the intendment of the
constitution ia Its provisions for devolving func
tions upon the vice president when the president
suffers from inability to ti'.eeharge the powen and
duties of his office. I trust that no em
barrassment may result from a failure to deter
mine these questions before another national
election.
OUR NATIONAL BLESSINGS.
The closing year has been replete with bless
ings, for which which we owe to the Giver of all
uood cur reverent acknowledgments, for the un
interrupted harmony of our foreign relations, the
spread of intelligence and the conservation ol Hie
public c edit, for the growth of the country in
all elements ol national greatness, for
those an 1 countless other blessing we
shoal 1 rejoice and be glad. I trust that urn er
the inspiration ■ t this gre t prospe-jty our couu
’sels may be ha monions and that the dictates of
prudence, of patriotism, justice and economy may
lead :o the adoption ot measures in which con
cre.-s and the executive may heartily unite.
